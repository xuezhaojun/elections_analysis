1340537461718433793 2020-12-20 14:00:11 +0800 <frank754> It's my #Twitterversary! I have been on Twitter for 12 years, since 20 Dec 2008 (via @twi_age).
1334674737046450179 2020-12-04 09:43:49 +0800 <frank754> I think Twitter has changed the algorithm a bit. I get a lot fewer reactions to my tweets lately. Also, I'm #FBR and always looking for new followers.

1318713378563567616 2020-10-21 08:39:04 +0800 <frank754> As election approaches, I would like to connect with more #resisters, I follow back everyone with a Democratic or #progressive profile, I've been on here for years, but never could quite hit 20k. Please retweet so others can find me :)
