1340280408953548800 2020-12-19 20:58:45 +0800 <celtic_switch> @CornwallCouncil Are we allowed to take our friends from tier 2 to the pub for a pint over Xmas?
1338560999792783361 2020-12-15 03:06:26 +0800 <celtic_switch> People love a smile. It's a huge part of how we communicate with each other.
1337366586706055169 2020-12-11 20:00:15 +0800 <celtic_switch> @Rob_Kimbell I check it every now again to see what they're making the  "normies" believe. The propaganda stands out a mile once you know.
1337104744096075776 2020-12-11 02:39:47 +0800 <celtic_switch> Eventually, nobody complicit in human rights abuses and related matters will be excluded.

1336632338227343361 2020-12-09 19:22:37 +0800 <celtic_switch> I hope Cornwall's clean air strategy will consider looking in to the actions of this company. Clearly one of (if not THE) worst air/noise polluters currently in Cornwall.  https://t.co/1ior7GbDGD

1331654578094415877 2020-11-26 01:42:47 +0800 <celtic_switch> "Just doing my job" won't be an acceptable excuse in a court of law.
1331642005366190081 2020-11-26 00:52:49 +0800 <celtic_switch> @CornwallCouncil It would also be great to get a list of Cornwall's top Air/Noise polluters. Do we have any data on this?

1329698615460245504 2020-11-20 16:10:29 +0800 <celtic_switch> A massive and very serious news story emerged in Cornwall last week. Local news outlets who chose to ignore it and instead push continuous Covid propaganda have all been duly noted.
1329493468138369027 2020-11-20 02:35:18 +0800 <celtic_switch> @StFrancesco22 @CoryBooker It's an affirmation of love for the globalist overlords.
1329408483565965313 2020-11-19 20:57:36 +0800 <celtic_switch> Those with blood on their hands connected to these atrocities against humanity should ALL be held accountable.

1329338268580782080 2020-11-19 16:18:35 +0800 <celtic_switch> Less apologising, more Nuremberg style trials and punishment for these war mongers.

1326455443779166209 2020-11-11 17:23:16 +0800 <celtic_switch> @bet365 Why have you settled my bet on the next President of USA before the results have been officially announced? What are you basing the settlement result on?

1324287050397437952 2020-11-05 17:46:51 +0800 <celtic_switch> @FE_business @MattHancock That money was stolen from every tax payer in the UK and redistributed to the elite. THEFT!
1324069883383029760 2020-11-05 03:23:54 +0800 <celtic_switch> @WonrekCP Strange when I talk to my nurse friends they all say the hospitals are at NORMAL capacity. I'm afraid you are being lied to and all you have to do is look at the official data for confirmation.
1324068471471222785 2020-11-05 03:18:18 +0800 <celtic_switch> @WonrekCP The last 96 days we have had 2 Covid related deaths in Cornwall after what has been one of the busiest tourist seasons I can ever remember. TWO!
1324066240965521410 2020-11-05 03:09:26 +0800 <celtic_switch> @WonrekCP @stevedouble Then why are the hospitals quieter than average for this time of year? Not just in Cornwall, all over the UK.

1321053970262085634 2020-10-27 19:39:45 +0800 <celtic_switch> The worst is when you get served food and drinks by someone in a visibly grubby mask. Totally gross but they think they're keeping me safe?

1320784388263682049 2020-10-27 01:48:31 +0800 <celtic_switch> @Kimmy5D As per the rules, you do not need to wear a mask if it will cause you distress. Who wouldn't feel distressed being made to wear a mask at a wedding? I'd ask your guests, see how they feel about it.

1306262130384138240 2020-09-17 00:02:15 +0800 <celtic_switch> @IAMtheArtofSoul We create and shape the reality around us simply by the way we think and the actions we take. Start with a smile and see how it affects the people you meet.
1306183896585863168 2020-09-16 18:51:23 +0800 <celtic_switch> @anonpatriotq "They made a mistake" is really a polite understatement. They made war crimes!
1306181871907282945 2020-09-16 18:43:20 +0800 <celtic_switch> A superb project for all humanity and nature to enjoy
1306168186614755328 2020-09-16 17:48:57 +0800 <celtic_switch> @FinnBrownMusic It shouldn't matter which side you lean. Nobody should want a biased media outlet we are forced to pay for by law. That money could be used for projects that benefit many more people who can't even afford a TV.
1306165033265778689 2020-09-16 17:36:25 +0800 <celtic_switch> @DrolNacul @pistmink1 @KathyConWom @netflix Stop paying and stop watching. You can get plenty of info and entertainment for free off YouTube.

1305947657517649924 2020-09-16 03:12:39 +0800 <celtic_switch> @Curious_Chak Ban people or ban masks? Which would you prefer?
1305900894840655873 2020-09-16 00:06:50 +0800 <celtic_switch> @Curious_Chak Look around, see for yourself how people are using the masks touching them, putting them in pocket + reusing. Are you really happy about these people touching things in shops after handling phlegm infused cloth? This is basic hygiene 101.
1305898518872195072 2020-09-15 23:57:23 +0800 <celtic_switch> @Curious_Chak The people walking around shops wearing the same mask for days on end are not surgeons.

1305890328080248832 2020-09-15 23:24:51 +0800 <celtic_switch> @NME Good to see Noel didn't fall for the blatant propaganda and brainwashing.
1305862248909414407 2020-09-15 21:33:16 +0800 <celtic_switch> @BarrieDawes2 @Telegraph Are you sure you want to be funding Netflix?  https://t.co/HgsPNqIZsN
1305175153752649728 2020-09-14 00:03:00 +0800 <celtic_switch> Shocking. This is a form of child abuse and it's not acceptable.
1305173126448328711 2020-09-13 23:54:56 +0800 <celtic_switch> @GrayKlaw @IlluminateDark8 I totally agree the reaction was far too quick.
1305172792007110656 2020-09-13 23:53:37 +0800 <celtic_switch> @medverkande @IlluminateDark8 I agree, it was either a symbol or a picture/photo
1304780465149280256 2020-09-12 21:54:39 +0800 <celtic_switch> All clear, ready to do it again on the 19th?
1304464473911164931 2020-09-12 00:59:01 +0800 <celtic_switch> It started a war that cost at least a 1/2 million lives and disrupted the middle east for nearly 20 years. Most of us were fooled in to supporting that effort in the name of fighting terror. Justice still needs to be done for this.
1304462118595551233 2020-09-12 00:49:39 +0800 <celtic_switch> @shall_awaken @UN @antonioguterres any idea what that statue in the office represents?
1304423354821234696 2020-09-11 22:15:37 +0800 <celtic_switch> @prayingmedic @R59636581 Justice is sorely needed for the perpetrators of this heinous crime against humanity. Not only for Americans, but also the rest of the world.
1304074672326270976 2020-09-10 23:10:05 +0800 <celtic_switch> If you tolerate this....

1303303846098358277 2020-09-08 20:07:05 +0800 <celtic_switch> If you're working for the military industrial complex, you may need to re-evaluate your career path soon.
1303296524613570562 2020-09-08 19:38:00 +0800 <celtic_switch> Unless you're using a fresh medical mask each time you put one on, you're simply spreading germs and bacteria with your hands. If that notion causes you "extreme distress" then you are exempt from wearing a mask.
1303267546834112513 2020-09-08 17:42:51 +0800 <celtic_switch> @PaulAndersonNE6 @que_uk Because they are being used in an unhygienic way. It's really unbelievable people have been convinced to strap these disgusting coverings to their faces.  https://t.co/RHyioF3AMq

1303247397208961024 2020-09-08 16:22:47 +0800 <celtic_switch> Very relevant, how to understand doublespeak.  https://t.co/qNpfoT3yff
1303059423846428673 2020-09-08 03:55:50 +0800 <celtic_switch> Ask yourself, why are they making us wear masks when more people are dying from common flu? Because they are trying to dehumanize you. Don't fall for it. Take off your mask and walk proud and free.

1302985547372208128 2020-09-07 23:02:17 +0800 <celtic_switch> @CoronavirusFor I have not once put a mask on and you're right, it can be scary but really there's nothing to be afraid of. I've never had so many friendly conversations with shop owners.
1301989808450007042 2020-09-05 05:05:34 +0800 <celtic_switch> This is exactly correct

Unless you are exempt as laid out in section 3 of the Government guidelines.

They are going to be sued.
1301904743112093696 2020-09-04 23:27:33 +0800 <celtic_switch> @simondolan @JohnMappin Was hoping you'd get involved with this.

1301797069032697856 2020-09-04 16:19:42 +0800 <celtic_switch> @DontBuyTheSun8 @StopComplying @BTP And what if he was exempt as laid out in section 3 of the governments guidance on face coverings?
1301577496866050051 2020-09-04 01:47:12 +0800 <celtic_switch> @SydneyLWatson knows what to do.  https://t.co/7jopTT6Okl

1301223893382959106 2020-09-03 02:22:06 +0800 <celtic_switch> Why are you so aggressive with your replies? Do you not think declaring 30,000+ people to be fascist idiots makes you sound like a psychopath? My goodness.

1300810278788046849 2020-09-01 22:58:33 +0800 <celtic_switch> @MrErnestOwens The correct answer is Adele's hair belongs to Adele and she has the god given right to do with it as she pleases. The same goes for every other single being on Earth. Focus your attention on something worthwhile and you'll feel so much happier in life.
