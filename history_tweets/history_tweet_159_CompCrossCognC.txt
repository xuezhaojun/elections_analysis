1337449809700134913 2020-12-12 01:30:57 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> We brought this one back again for a second look -- specifically looking at how they deal with challenges to their argument. They dismiss consciousness in computers, but we wonder if it is due to the state of the art back in 2013, or if they just did not foresee advancements?
1334913294902112274 2020-12-05 01:31:45 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> This review covers a lot of ground, so we might spend two weeks discussing it! A lot of questions about its assumptions, like: Why not have consciousness in invertebrates? Why require isomorphic maps? Did eyes evolve before olfaction? ðŸ¤”
1334912819498803202 2020-12-05 01:29:52 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Today's journal club article was suggested by @BRigbyDames -- The evolutionary and genetic origins of consciousness in the Cambrian Period over 500 million years ago @FrontPsychol  https://t.co/AQPmt4mAxA
1332374019836940295 2020-11-28 01:21:35 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Music was rated for groove, enjoyment, and ease of tapping. The multisensory experience of hearing and feeling the music led to more forceful finger tapping, spontaneous body movement, and grooving.
1332373742606016519 2020-11-28 01:20:29 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Best apparatus ever: @subaruuk 2012 Outback with a subwoofer behind the passenger, er participant, playing the music with a mix of "old" 70s/80s and "new" 00s/10s on the playlist.
1332373210160128000 2020-11-28 01:18:22 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Music is multisensory -- we hear it, of course, but we FEEL it too. Here the participants felt it with either a subwoofer or a tactile-stimulating backpack.

1329852306465165313 2020-11-21 02:21:11 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Thanks to @AleAliSousa for recommending this with a HT to a tweet by @AMCELL on this music for monkeys paper.
1329851845079085056 2020-11-21 02:19:21 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> In the end we found it hard to conclude whether the monkeys necessarily liked any of the sounds, and if they did like them, why they did (experience? auditory properties?). But we know the challenges of zoo research, and think they did the best with the constraints presented!
1329851535925370882 2020-11-21 02:18:08 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> We noticed @Ilyena shares our interestes in #HCI and technology for visual impairments, so we have similar passions and approaches! In fact, some members of our team have work under review at @sig_chi including such design practices for our work on #a11y
1329851229158207488 2020-11-21 02:16:55 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> We really liked the "participatory design" approach, with the article giving a narrative of how they designed different aspects of the enrichment tunnels by working with the Saki monkeys and seeing what worked best for them by testing prototypes.
1329850720129003520 2020-11-21 02:14:53 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> This news release for the article has some nice, large images showing how they built tunnels for the monkeys to crawl through and trigger the different types of "music" or sounds that would be heard  https://t.co/8fTgPpOOoY
1329850493074628608 2020-11-21 02:13:59 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> This weeks journal club went to the zoo with a virtual trip to Helsinki's @Korkeasaari Zoo and a study on Music for (Saki) Monkeys  https://t.co/4Vmuf72P97 by @Ilyena and @RPiitulainen
1328410506139475968 2020-11-17 02:51:59 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Congratulations @KPakenaite !
1328339539916705793 2020-11-16 22:10:00 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Lab meeting today with @meike_scheller talking about her EEG research with a nice intro  https://t.co/nk3zDsyB00
1327302547149901826 2020-11-14 01:29:21 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Also a nice reminder of an earlier paper on visual illusions, finding that the statistics of image-source relations could explain those too, such as with the Mueller-Lyer illusion  https://t.co/BZPY7NaSUV
1327301402050355203 2020-11-14 01:24:48 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> This article was suggested by @meike_scheller  -- and we should have invited @Lancophone to join in as I think he'd find it intriguing. We had Cesare Parise give a talk about this @BathPsychology back when it came out so this was a nice refresher on it!
1327301064786399232 2020-11-14 01:23:28 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> So it looks like there is a statistical reason for the crossmodal correspondence between pitch/frequency and elevation -- though perhaps there are structural reasons behind it too, as such regularities are possibly something that can be adapted to on evolutionary timescales?
1327300513029890048 2020-11-14 01:21:17 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Parise et al put microphones on the side of a hat and walked around to record sounds in a way that they are received around a human head -- and there seemed to be a link between frequencies and elevation  https://t.co/8IxXVSS71e
1327299168667361286 2020-11-14 01:15:56 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Could the link between High Pitch and Elevation be semantic (metaphor), statistical (experience), or structural (neural or innate)? This table from Spence gives these possible explanations  https://t.co/TIX8rz5BlD
1327298643876044800 2020-11-14 01:13:51 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Spence covers a number of correspondences we have between the senses -- and one is between high-pitch sounds and high elevations  https://t.co/VDJFjImUl7
1327298193185533954 2020-11-14 01:12:03 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Parise has also collaborated with Spence, who more recently wrote a tutorial review about Crossmodal Correspondences that takes this work into account  https://t.co/IUnFpiIT9u
1327297066570280961 2020-11-14 01:07:35 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> This week for journal club we are looking back at this one:   Natural auditory scene statistics shapes human spatial hearing by Parise, Knorre &amp; Ernst (2014)   https://t.co/sRL7ghsb21

1325066766159142912 2020-11-07 21:25:10 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> This week's journal club took on the new preprint by Yael Niv -- link and a lot of commentary in this thread! Glad @hollywilsh recommended it, as it inspired some interesting debate on both sides!
1308750332651073536 2020-09-23 20:49:29 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Working at home? Please complete this questionnaire led by @MarvelousMike6
1307004974552014848 2020-09-19 01:14:03 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Thus, this new study's finding of "general" enhancement might be "specific" to the unisensory task that was used, but not to multisensory conditions or those where external and allocentric spatial information is important, such as in work by Monica Gori @UVip_iit. Interesting!
1307004358190682116 2020-09-19 01:11:36 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> These are valid differences, though perhaps there are different types of spatial hearing! Some tasks like pointing might be crucial for crossmodal transfer such as touching the noisy object.
1307003754550636545 2020-09-19 01:09:12 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> They thought this method was better than tasks that used pointing or spatial-bisection tasks as those involved some combination of sensorimotor or external / allocentric spatial reference frames.
1307003347799609353 2020-09-19 01:07:35 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Nice use of the minimum-audible angle task to examine how precisely participants could determine whether a sound was above/below or to the left/right of another sound at varying distances between them -- closer is harder! They found that those with early blindness did better.
1306979839476486144 2020-09-18 23:34:10 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> This week's journal club at the virtual pub will discuss this interesting new study by a research team working with @CollignonOlivi1  -- do you need visual experience for accurate spatial hearing?  https://t.co/cRIMBT0qxp   https://t.co/AKklA4Jhm7
1304473659562692616 2020-09-12 01:35:31 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> For more information follow @sebyosiere -- the lead researcher for this work!
1304466066987528192 2020-09-12 01:05:20 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Some of the studies used only one breed -- so that was controlled for -- like this cute one. But others had a mix of breeds. Might that lead to the apparent reversals, null effects, or human-like findings with such "individual" differences even though they are all one species?  https://t.co/tlUn7IHgl3
1304465590086762498 2020-09-12 01:03:27 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Why is that important? Prior work has found that visual cortex size predicts the magnitude of a size illusion  https://t.co/69qnyN4a2Y so breed might matter!
1304464740656254984 2020-09-12 01:00:04 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> Really interesting review! It left out some details that might be important for the mechanisms of it, such as the breeds of the participants. Dogs vary a lot in terms of their anatomy, including neuroanatomy:  https://t.co/bzMmWyLgrn
1304409008787394561 2020-09-11 21:18:37 +0800 <CompCrossCognC> We are back with our weekly "journal club at the virtual pub" -- this week looking at this paper on visual illusions in dogs!
