1318173335885328387 2020-10-19 20:53:08 +0800 <HodeyHoe> I see that trip to Russia on 9/11 educated @RandPaul on how to make friends w/the wealthy and score some points (money) by simply giving his loyalty to the almighty dollar and turning his loyalty away from the USA. Another of Putin’s puppets.
1317993758277992448 2020-10-19 08:59:33 +0800 <HodeyHoe> @DannyTempleton9 Vasectomies are reversible. Give all young men a vasectomy. When they prove themselves ready for a family, reverse it. What? Can’t because men have body autonomy? Can’t tell men what to do w/their body even if it ends abortion? You don’t care about abortion.
1317977587445043205 2020-10-19 07:55:18 +0800 <HodeyHoe> @DevinNunes you need to call the @FBI , get a plea deal. Save yourself, you know Trump will flip on you. Get your plea deal before Trump gets a deal. Trump’s crime family has no loyalty to you.

1301602405809876992 2020-09-04 03:26:10 +0800 <HodeyHoe> Donald Trump is currently fighting the release of his DNA in a rape case.  Evidence that would exonerate him if he were innocent. Q: Why would an innocent man put forth a legal battle in US courts against releasing proof of his innocence? A: He wouldn’t.

I think it must fill some kind of void in their lives. Insecurity, the worry that they will be replaced and one day they’ll be treated as second class citizens?

1300632189680463875 2020-09-01 11:10:53 +0800 <HodeyHoe> Just a few words from George W. Bush. A few words in support of Biden for POTUS. That’s all that’s needed to get decent republicans to vote Putin’s vulgar puppet out of the White House. 🙌  @laurawbush
