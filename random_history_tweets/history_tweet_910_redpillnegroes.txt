1324047179548426241 2020-11-05 01:53:41 +0800 <redpillnegroes> i assume they handed out these 'juicy' pens so the machines would misread or fail to read them. this delays things giving them time to harvest more ballots.  in all likelihood, we end in recounts and they end up being recounted by hand, unfortunately.

I have lost no confidence. Trump is a natural-born winner and if you think he's gonna stand by while they steal this from him, you were never MAGA ;p

1301366173523730432 2020-09-03 11:47:28 +0800 <redpillnegroes> @EricRWeinstein i think this is a moral mistake. you have a responsibility to your local community. the idea that you're responsibility to the global community or even national community i think is mistaken. one must be elected to such a position of authority.

1300968966551203840 2020-09-02 09:29:07 +0800 <redpillnegroes> I think the 2 shootings recently are a turning point. Rittenhouse was obvious self-defense. Danielson was obvious murder.  They've crossed the rubicon.  /END
1300968720232312832 2020-09-02 09:28:08 +0800 <redpillnegroes> Trump may have understood this instinctively from the beginning. He was right, and is still right, not to invoke the Insurrection Act.   People are beginning to understand that these riots are solely about hate and destruction. And as they continue, more people will realize.
1300968235379105793 2020-09-02 09:26:12 +0800 <redpillnegroes> So, as should come as no surprise, their tactics are fundamentally self-destructive. It's a blitzkrieg. If they don't win in a few weeks, they're fucked.  These tactics cannot win in a war of attrition. The riots have gone on too long now.
1300967753709486080 2020-09-02 09:24:17 +0800 <redpillnegroes> This animosity created by the destruction kills any sympathy they may generate by sticking grandma and disabled people in front of their shield wall.  People's sympathy is not infinite. It will run out eventually. And their destruction is what kills it.
1300967410044940290 2020-09-02 09:22:56 +0800 <redpillnegroes> The destruction is the fatal flaw. It just turns people off. A few times it can be written off as people getting out of hand in the heat of the moment.  But when the violence is sustained long-term it becomes obvious to people that it is destruction for its own sake.
1300967094192869376 2020-09-02 09:21:40 +0800 <redpillnegroes> And antifa's tactical 1-2 combo of optics to cover up destruction seems similar.  They can hit hard for a little bit. And it worked on Trump's poll numbers initially. But it can't go the distance.
1300966672258531329 2020-09-02 09:20:00 +0800 <redpillnegroes> Blitz didn't work without the combination of air and armor.  It was a short-sighted strategy. It worked for border wars against weaker opponents. And the French were simply outdated in their thinking and could not defend against it. They were not prepared for mobile war.
1300966348332445696 2020-09-02 09:18:42 +0800 <redpillnegroes> However when it came time to attack Britian without a direct land route or the USSR where they had to cover a massive distance it failed.  Their supply lines stretched too far and broke in the USSR. In Britian they could not make the attack work with air attacks only.
1300965803345547273 2020-09-02 09:16:32 +0800 <redpillnegroes> I was watching a lecture by Victor Davis Hanson recently about Nazi blitzkrieg in WWII. It revolved around fast strikes with stormtroopers and armor with close air support.  This worked very well over short distances for short durations.
1300965443310678026 2020-09-02 09:15:07 +0800 <redpillnegroes> I just wanted to add my two cents.  I think these tactics are short-sighted. That is it can be effective in the short-term, but can't go the distance.

1300944120379252737 2020-09-02 07:50:23 +0800 <redpillnegroes> What is going to happen is some states will allow this mail-in nonsense and a bunch of Biden votes will get thrown out while Republicans fill the zone at polling stations.   Trump will landslide and they'll try to play it off. Begging for a mail-in miracle. It won't come.  /END
1300943701510942720 2020-09-02 07:48:43 +0800 <redpillnegroes> How? How are they going to come up with millions of valid addresses and matching names on the voter rolls IN THE RIGHT COUNTIES?  As the great @COsweda has pointed out. Dems are not that competent. If they were Biden wouldn't be the candidate.
1300943410627518469 2020-09-02 07:47:34 +0800 <redpillnegroes> Presumably they also think enough Biden voters will do this to overcome the amount of votes that will be disqualified.  But won't they just cheat? Won't they send create millions of phony ballots and mail them in?
1300943139855896585 2020-09-02 07:46:29 +0800 <redpillnegroes> They want mail-in because they think that maybe voters won't show up to the polls for Biden. But maybe they'll be willing to vote for him if it's as simple as filling out and mailing in a ballot.
1300942961472090112 2020-09-02 07:45:47 +0800 <redpillnegroes> Trump voters can't wait to go vote for him. Biden voters are more apathetic on Biden personally and kind of just want Trump gone.   So who will drive more voters to the polls? Trump. How can the Dems make up for the enthusiasm gap?  Mail-in voting.
1300942667166167041 2020-09-02 07:44:36 +0800 <redpillnegroes> Well it's because of the enthusiasm gap between Trump and Biden voters.   https://t.co/ZHXQJeu24B
1300942525700677632 2020-09-02 07:44:03 +0800 <redpillnegroes> So whose votes are more likely to be thrown out? Bingo! Democrat votes. That is Biden votes.  But you might ask. Then why are the Dems pushing for mail-in voting so hard?
1300942340308205569 2020-09-02 07:43:18 +0800 <redpillnegroes> And who will mail-in vote the most? Democrats. Because Democrats are significantly more scared of coronavirus than Republicans. Republicans will show up at the polls largely. Democrats will see a significant number of their voters opt for mail-in.
1300942041241858048 2020-09-02 07:42:07 +0800 <redpillnegroes> We all know mail-in voting is error and fraud prone. Votes get disqualified because they're filled out wrong or postdated after the election or any other number of reasons.
1300941789537370112 2020-09-02 07:41:07 +0800 <redpillnegroes> THREAD  So I know a lot of people on the right are afraid that mail-in voting will be used to steal the election from Trump.  I think this is nothing to worry about. Let me explain.
