The least people could do is wear masks for the people around them and for front line workers. Unfortunately we do have a large percentage of entitled folks in this country.
1344003344910536704 2020-12-30 03:32:22 +0800 <Resisting_Rebel> @molaikowski @mertlewoodOre @McJesse To be clear I am Not selfish. I did not ask to lose my job. I was working 12-16 hour days 6 days. Now I am worried about losing my home. I was just trying to be positive and find the silver lining. Don't be so quick to judge when you don't know somebody's situation.
1344002790750736384 2020-12-30 03:30:10 +0800 <Resisting_Rebel> @mertlewoodOre @McJesse Thank you &amp; I am also sorry you never got a well deserved break. However I have lost my job &amp; live in a city with the highest unemplymt so i have had no luck in my 1000s of applications. I don't sleep anymore worried about losing my home. I wish i was working instead of a break.

I thought thw election would have motivated both sides to get something going. Bottom line they should have had a new package in July when the last one expired. As well as stimulus at the very least for frontline workers.

Not to mention its amusing to see Newt projecting that he, himself is clearly scared of Stacey Abrams' fight against voter suppression.

But he loses me when i read after all that he says he is still voting for Trump. Hopefully not. Hopefully you just say what you had to. Your vote is private. #VoteBiden   https://t.co/DvI5KLw1IC

"if we told them to wear masks no one would show up" The timeline works..since February. I saw him wear a mask once. It's not exactly surprising.

There are recordings of him saying exactly that. Let that rest on your conscience while you protest vote.
