1341423478705188864 2020-12-23 00:40:54 +0800 <TessaBD1> @DanCrenshawTX Btw Dan, how did YOU vote on the "Relief" bill?
1341422839770046466 2020-12-23 00:38:22 +0800 <TessaBD1> Now @PeteButtigieg, if you can just get those electric cars priced at $600, you might stand a chance if/when there's another "relief" bill.

1341259668077867010 2020-12-22 13:49:58 +0800 <TessaBD1> Don't do it, President @realDonaldTrump.  This is America last, unless you're in Congress.
1341258195810070528 2020-12-22 13:44:07 +0800 <TessaBD1> @SenSanders Yes, Bernie, it doubles funding (additional $5M) for the healthcare clinic used by member of Congress.  And you're right, $600 checks for those who "qualify" is not even a spit in this $900B pond.  It's a disgrace, and deserves NO praise at all.

1337751688770424835 2020-12-12 21:30:31 +0800 <TessaBD1> @DanOHerrin No true.  Twitter won't allow you to "like" it, but you can re-tweet w/ comment, as I did.

Are you suggesting you and most other in DC haven't known about this long before the news broke? What about Feinstein?  What about Pelosi's investment in China?

1336705672919052290 2020-12-10 00:14:01 +0800 <TessaBD1> @GReschenthaler @RealSaavedra Just how many in Congress, the media, Wall Street, have known for decades about @SpeakerPelosi's commitment to the CCP $$$ she and her husband have made? She is committed to her wealth and the destruction of this country.  "The swamp" is actually a septic tank.
1336703988427841536 2020-12-10 00:07:20 +0800 <TessaBD1> @GReschenthaler @RealSaavedra I disagree with you. The fact that @speakerpelosi knew about Swalwell's ties to Chinese spy (and don't think she didn't know about @SenFeinstein's) underscores her commitment to destroying this country and lining her own pockets. Btw... who else is complicit in this coverup?

There are some people you'd want to have with you if you to go into battle, and others you wouldn't.  It's about integrity.  This one loves to say, "No man left behind", but try to find him.  But yes, it's sad.  Moving right along....

1325837389596651521 2020-11-10 00:27:21 +0800 <TessaBD1> Let's remember that tens of millions of people rejected the status quo when they voted for @realdonaldtrump.  The lies, hate, chaos and division were what got Pres. Trump elected.  It's why he ran.

1324900349312905217 2020-11-07 10:23:53 +0800 <TessaBD1> @pushforward40 Not if Biden has Zeke Emmanual heading his Covid task force.  Dr. Death will drive a shut down of the country for 12-18 months.  Don't recall Zeke?  Obama's H1N1 czar. Dr. Death who had Medicare medical treatments cancelled for people over 75.
1324894365173551114 2020-11-07 10:00:06 +0800 <TessaBD1> You remember Zeke, don't you? Recall Medicare treatments no longer available to people 75 and older.  Obama's H1N1 flu czar. His book:  Why I Want to Die at 75.   Ooops... look out Joe.

1324741668688564225 2020-11-06 23:53:20 +0800 <TessaBD1> @megynkelly It is not clear at all.  It took Gore 35 days after the election he presumably won to avail himself of all his legal remedies. There are still votes being counted.  There are still lawsuits pending.  This is no time to concede and pass the torch.  "Gracious"?  Bless your heart.

1318835265285234688 2020-10-21 16:43:24 +0800 <TessaBD1> @joe_norte I hope you're right about winning. Bloomberg sunk $100M in FL, the media are clearly in the tank for the CCP/NWO. Joe can continue to say, do nothing. I don't know if I fear for our country, or is I'm mourning our country.  This won't end with this election.

1318833460719636480 2020-10-21 16:36:14 +0800 <TessaBD1> @joe_norte Does that 12 months include the 11 months the FBI sat on the Hunter Biden drive?  Rhetorical, because nothing about Hunter Biden... or Joe Biden for that matter... will effect this election.  The CCP has this in the bag.

1313956986120212481 2020-10-08 05:38:52 +0800 <TessaBD1> @GregRubini @GenFlynn Flynn's son also resigned from Trump's transition team, for different reasons.  He got cocky... his tweets weren't worth the political capital.  He was young, stupid, and drunk on his newfound status.  It happens.
1313956498553405441 2020-10-08 05:36:56 +0800 <TessaBD1> @GregRubini @GenFlynn I support Gen Flynn, donated to his defense fund. But I also recall he admitted to lying to Pence, said POTUS would be justified in firing him. Flynn resigned because he's an honorable man.

1313940586756550661 2020-10-08 04:33:42 +0800 <TessaBD1> @Norsu2 You know, I know we all saw this in 2016.  And I want... have... to believe these polls are missing the story.  But if Biden wins, I will kiss this country goodbye... figuratively. Just write it off as the shithole it will become.

1313938719779565570 2020-10-08 04:26:17 +0800 <TessaBD1> @DCjusticeseeker It's naive to think anything having to do with politics is "fair".  There's a good reason why politicians, generally, are held in such low regard. Channelling Churchill:  We've established what you are. Now we're just haggling over the price.

Interestingly, she's a Democrat and applauded Trump for the example he set.  You see, those of us who've lived a while have what's called perspective.  Do you call your mother often?

McCain heard about the dossier at the 2016 Halifax International Security Forum Cananda, knew it was BS, hated Trump so much he was willing to use it to take Trump down.  Don't anyone talk to me about McCain's "honor".

Gates, the prof, should have just shown his ID to prove, it you will, he was the home owner. Obama waited 7 days to opine that race was involved. He should have stayed out of it.
