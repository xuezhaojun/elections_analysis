1330802707444211713 2020-11-23 17:17:45 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @wilkerica_ @AusPainSoc Oh interesting! I will look it up.
1330795691183050752 2020-11-23 16:49:52 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @wilkerica_ @AusPainSoc I hope the talk lived up to your expectations!
1330795561306480640 2020-11-23 16:49:21 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @wilkerica_ @AusPainSoc Were you the person with the interesting question about interoception, perchance? ;)
1330795395648262145 2020-11-23 16:48:41 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @AusPainSoc I really enjoyed the questions. Thanks for having me!
1325746296704086016 2020-11-09 18:25:22 +0800 <JanetBultitude> I'm still not quite over the disappointment of not being able to attend the @AusPainSoc meeting in Hobart earlier this year (cancelled due to COVID), however I am looking forward to presenting as part of this webinar.
1314215863956856835 2020-10-08 22:47:33 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @sirileknes Voxel-based Lesion Symptom Mapping
1314203304352649218 2020-10-08 21:57:39 +0800 <JanetBultitude> Before someone yells at me, I know the dead salmon study wasn't VLSM.
1314202725911986177 2020-10-08 21:55:21 +0800 <JanetBultitude> My google-fu has failed me. About how many voxels would you be dealing with for your average VLSM study? I want to explain the importance of correction for multiple comparisons to my students. (Yes, dead salmons might come up). @NeleDemeyere @StephanieRossit, anyone else?
1313944647220236288 2020-10-08 04:49:50 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @DrGBuckingham That's probably how your students feel, too
1313944056897167360 2020-10-08 04:47:29 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @abbiejones86 @Hove Congratulations!
1313815065628475392 2020-10-07 20:14:55 +0800 <JanetBultitude> PS. Our results also call into question the sensorimotor incongruence theory, at least as an explanation for #CRPS, because we show that people are able to use to sources of information to improve their performance, even when one type (movement) is degraded.
1313814597850337280 2020-10-07 20:13:04 +0800 <JanetBultitude> We think that our results mean that it might be possible to take advantage of this intact cue combination to come up with new therapies.   /end
1313814361706688513 2020-10-07 20:12:07 +0800 <JanetBultitude> The differences between people with and without CRPS suggest that people with CRPS use different strategies.
1313814128318967813 2020-10-07 20:11:12 +0800 <JanetBultitude> This is interesting, because both movement and perception of limb location is often impaired in people with CRPS. So despite this degraded information, they were still able to use it together with visual information.
1313813728585035781 2020-10-07 20:09:37 +0800 <JanetBultitude> Overall, what is striking is that the people with #CRPS COULD use both vision and movement together, even when using their painful limbs. However, they appear to do this in different ways to the people without chronic pain.
1313813509751406592 2020-10-07 20:08:44 +0800 <JanetBultitude> The differences between the people with #crps and the control group were a bit complex: in one condition they even performed better than controls, which suggests that maybe the people with pain make use of additional information to compensate for their difficulties.
1313813280280981504 2020-10-07 20:07:50 +0800 <JanetBultitude> However, when the task involved the affected side of space and/or the body, they performed differently to controls.
1313813151654215682 2020-10-07 20:07:19 +0800 <JanetBultitude> We found that people with #CRPS performed normally when they located the flashes that appeared in the unaffected side of space using the hand of the unaffected side of the body.
1313812771008634880 2020-10-07 20:05:48 +0800 <JanetBultitude> We expect that everyone would be worse at doing this task when they used vision or movement alone. But pain-free people normally will be better at this when they can use both vision and movement, indicating that they benefit from using both cues at the same time.
1313812460072300546 2020-10-07 20:04:34 +0800 <JanetBultitude> We flashed points of light on the surface of a table and tested how accurately people with or without #CRPS could keep track of the locations of these flashes. They did this using vision alone, using movement alone, and using both vision and movement together.
1313812032660045825 2020-10-07 20:02:52 +0800 <JanetBultitude> What hasn't been extensively tested is whether there is any evidence that people with certain chronic pain conditions combine sensory and motor information differently to people without chronic pain. This is what we tested.
1313811293468532737 2020-10-07 19:59:56 +0800 <JanetBultitude> This 'sensorimotor incongruence' theory is supported by evidence that when you use illusions to induce this kind of conflict, pain increases. In fact, even people without chronic pain report unusual sensations when they are exposed to this kind of illusion.
1313810928073420800 2020-10-07 19:58:29 +0800 <JanetBultitude> One theory is that some conditions of unexplained pain happen because of conflict between sensory signals received in the brain and signals for movement or intended movement that are generated in the brain.
1313810620303769600 2020-10-07 19:57:15 +0800 <JanetBultitude> Very pleased to share my first research paper in collaboration with Dr Karin Petrini, my @BathPsychology colleague. Free to download to the first 50 people if yo use this link (which doesn't work on chrome for some reason)  https://t.co/8R2KeSB8yA
1313509676680650753 2020-10-07 00:01:25 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @MichaelProulx @StephanieRossit @hmorse8 I think part of the problem is that our trial was on a very niche topic, so they probably had trouble finding editors/reviewers. You might have more luck with a stroke rehab study.
1313509509990674432 2020-10-07 00:00:45 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @MichaelProulx @StephanieRossit @hmorse8 We also considered BMC Trials. I think both this and BMC Neurology is good, but don't count on getting the protocol reviewed before you start the trial. We had problems because we were almost finished data collection before the protocol was reviewed. Not ideal...
1310320524053172225 2020-09-28 04:48:52 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @benainsworth Well I don't see any answers yet ;-)
1310309861641641986 2020-09-28 04:06:30 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @chrisdc77 Wow - congratulations!
1309506211323285505 2020-09-25 22:53:04 +0800 <JanetBultitude> Is there a way to email everyone who was invited to attended an #msteams meeting that happened in the past? @msteamstips  @MicrosoftTeams
1309500005259128833 2020-09-25 22:28:25 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @ErrorgirlBlog Yes, I was going to say the same thing!
1309491196381859844 2020-09-25 21:53:25 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @DrGBuckingham Interested in sharing any of that content with me? ;)
1309484847468027905 2020-09-25 21:28:11 +0800 <JanetBultitude> Just spoke to my first year tutees and one asked if I had any advice for keeping track of all the information coming at them from different sources (email, moodle, teams). Good question! Can we streamline our communication channels?
1308719665875693578 2020-09-23 18:47:37 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @tomstafford I agree with everyone else - brilliant idea. One of my stats classes in undergrad was 'how to lie with graphs'. It was about how to make data look more convincing than they really are. Definitely very interesting
1308552373854523392 2020-09-23 07:42:52 +0800 <JanetBultitude> P.S. the letter is beind a paywall, but if you want to read it, you can contact first author, @TeuniTenBrink and she can send you a copy.
1308551371894001666 2020-09-23 07:38:53 +0800 <JanetBultitude> Just in time for Autumn, our letter about increased sensitivity to ambient temperature in #crps and #fibromyalgia is officially out.
1308551026472091650 2020-09-23 07:37:31 +0800 <JanetBultitude> It's very nice to have our research on bodily changes and sensory sensitivity in #crps and #fibromyalgia discussed in a clinical forum.
1308550098641715200 2020-09-23 07:33:49 +0800 <JanetBultitude> #preprint alert! Very pleased to be putting the finishing touches on this paper using prism adaptation to examine whether people with #CRPS have altered sensorimotor learning. This was part of @AVitterso's PhD, and we welcome any feedback.
1304442425654603782 2020-09-11 23:31:24 +0800 <JanetBultitude> I was looking up the "Little Albert" study for an ethics lecture and found a twitter account for his research assistant (later wife!), @rosalierayner, created by high school student Natalie Fedor. Now I can give more details about the previously anonymous RA in this picture.  https://t.co/Ml6PsDegRX
1304167391098744840 2020-09-11 05:18:30 +0800 <JanetBultitude> Do you have chronic pain? @DrJoDaniels has a short questionnaire and would be very grateful for responses.
1303285697189523457 2020-09-08 18:54:58 +0800 <JanetBultitude> @BlenheimTri - I haven't received my race pack yet. Tried emailing you but it bounced back saying the mailbox is unavailable. Please help
1300829499110686721 2020-09-02 00:14:55 +0800 <JanetBultitude> We're looking for #primarycare providers in the US for this important online study on patient care. Care for a retweet @YesonAB890 @mercy_health?
