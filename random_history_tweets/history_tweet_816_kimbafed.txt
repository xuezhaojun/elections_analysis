1338699287908163593 2020-12-15 12:15:56 +0800 <kimbafed> @rtmcclure I was finishing middle school and beginning high school.
1338696982118813697 2020-12-15 12:06:46 +0800 <kimbafed> @TrumpGoAway My husband is a server in a S.M. area restaurant that was closed, reopened after a few months at limited capacity &amp; strict Covid protocols, moved outside onto sidewalk for a few months, &amp; recently closed. The last time we ate in a restaurant was on my son's birthday last December

1338312071360860160 2020-12-14 10:37:17 +0800 <kimbafed> @calicoheartsoul I consider myself strategically indirect and often answer a question with a question. My father worked in defense intelligence at the Pentagon so we had to research &amp; make a case for everything. No wonder my sister &amp; I each had eating disorders.

1338272114231558146 2020-12-14 07:58:30 +0800 <kimbafed> @rtvmp I just reread it. What a love you shared. Suddenly I have a hankering for pie.🥧

1336073313014009857 2020-12-08 06:21:15 +0800 <kimbafed> @dansaltzstein I live in Los Angeles &amp; my husband was working at a Santa Monica restaurant that until recently permitted outdoor dining on the sidewalk. They were not allowed per Covid protocols to erect a tent let alone an enclosure around diners, to say nothing about accessibility.
1336072156208218113 2020-12-08 06:16:39 +0800 <kimbafed> @thomaskaine5 Why ask this question unless you want to perpetuate the president's unconstitutional fantasies?  "The president was also asked if his team could overturn the election results before the Electoral College meets to formally vote for a new president on Dec. 14."
1336033378542342144 2020-12-08 03:42:34 +0800 <kimbafed> @marceelias Thank you, Marc! Well done!

1336008318830055426 2020-12-08 02:02:59 +0800 <kimbafed> @CanadianShell I'm listening &amp; I won't try to talk you out of it. My sis &amp; I tried to talk our mother out of it since we were kids but she didn't listen, smoked for 60 years until she developed lung cancer &amp; CV disease. She passed in July from vascular dementia &amp; other diseases rel. to smoking.

1335723585999015937 2020-12-07 07:11:34 +0800 <kimbafed> @GayGuyKyle @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @AOC Sounds like a good plan.
1335707451878871042 2020-12-07 06:07:27 +0800 <kimbafed> @GabeDiLaurentis I couldn't be prouder of you, Gabriel. I don't know the circumstances but I'd say Chipotle failed you. As a parent &amp; former teacher, I'd say you were  tested and passed with flying colors. You have nothing to be ashamed of because it's clear you acted with integrity.

1335690231253671936 2020-12-07 04:59:01 +0800 <kimbafed> @HunterJCullen Yes, and for decades. I also think child sex trafficking is their primary focus.

I have been saying since T**** was elected that most of us are experiencing a collective, chronic PTSD, except the trauma is ongoing. I too look forward to the day we can let go of the hypervigilance &amp; hyperreactivity.

1326256623703056385 2020-11-11 04:13:14 +0800 <kimbafed> @GayGuyKyle No need to apologise, Kyle. You're among friends. It feels personal when people that followed you suddenly unfollow you, but if a group does this en-masse I think that reflects more on them then on you.
1326255344578781184 2020-11-11 04:08:09 +0800 <kimbafed> @KrisBCanadian @GayGuyKyle Only two that I know of...Kurt Eichenwald &amp; Brooklyn Dad Defiant each blocked me for some unknown reason. I had a private account then so I'm not sure why KE blocked me as I had tweeted 10 times total &amp; only my followers could see &amp; BDD DM'd me to screen me - guess I didn't pass
1326249284040224768 2020-11-11 03:44:04 +0800 <kimbafed> @KrisBCanadian @GayGuyKyle Same here. Only recently switched from a private account to a public one, so my voice (tweets)  could actually be heard/seen &amp; I could be part of the conversation.  I was surprised when a couple of big name accounts blocked me &amp; only care because it seemed so random &amp; unnecessary
1326247321235976193 2020-11-11 03:36:16 +0800 <kimbafed> @petersagal @WajahatAli McEnany went to Harvard!?

1326236326774022144 2020-11-11 02:52:35 +0800 <kimbafed> @jaketapper I generally respect your opinion but it does seem that you're attempting to "both sides" this issue after it came out that the Trump administration would fire anyone caught looking for a new job. You've drawn a false equivalence. Calling it a manifesto is a bit over the top, too.
1326232142657957888 2020-11-11 02:35:57 +0800 <kimbafed> @atrupar Maybe he's resting up because he'll soon be "at bat?"

1325905872434786304 2020-11-10 04:59:28 +0800 <kimbafed> @ddale8 If there was illegal voting, improper counting, or fraud in any of the states Biden won, shouldn't we consider the re-election of GOP Senators to be fraudulent as well?
1325899475148103680 2020-11-10 04:34:03 +0800 <kimbafed> @VZack4 @MSNBC My sentiments exactly! Moscow Mitch telling outrageous lies from the floor of the Senate requires a network to immediately cut away the same way it does when Trump does it from any location.
1325880138630746112 2020-11-10 03:17:13 +0800 <kimbafed> @ditzkoff I've been waiting for Trump's "A Face in the Crowd" moment since he was elected in 2016.

You assert @ProjectLincoln &amp; their ads didn't do what it intended because you have seen no evidence &amp; then ask them to prove you wrong.

1321956435308081154 2020-10-30 07:25:49 +0800 <kimbafed> @ddale8 This random refrain is a actually delayed response to his own inner critic. Trump looked in the mirror at some point &amp; was alarmed that his head looks like a worn leather medicine ball. When he thinks about how he looks he projects his insecurities onto his favorite target.
