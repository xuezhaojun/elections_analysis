1344064077061120002 2020-12-30 07:33:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford People are appreciative of what Drs and nurses do, but we’re not so keen on you blaming us for living and pushing for our lives to be shut down. The problem you have now in dealing with the expected rise in workload is down to the Govt and NHS management.
1344055097714757635 2020-12-30 06:58:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This article about the NHS winter crisis is from 2017.  Why are the public blaming each other and screaming for lockdown?  Most of the country is already on lockdown. Clearly, the Govt has failed to address the long-term problem of capacity.   https://t.co/2SquacyGTU
1344036989092442112 2020-12-30 05:46:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @munirawilson It’s an even bigger disgrace that most of the country is under house arrest, insufficient evidence has been presented - and there is virtually no noise about it from any of the opposition parties.
1344035349400592388 2020-12-30 05:39:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford You are a Dr and you know that’s a misuse of the word “cases”.
1344028063282171905 2020-12-30 05:10:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ThreeTunsHeddon I won’t get a response either but it adds to the pressure of the ridiculous situation they know we are in!! Makes me feel better to sound off anyway.
1344021318736474113 2020-12-30 04:43:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> As we inevitably approach yet more Covid restrictions I have written again to my MP, Theresa Villiers, to express my discontent as both a business owner and an individual. I urge people to do write to their MPs so they know the extent of our concerns.  https://t.co/VAAF2Pdiot
1343951823120572416 2020-12-30 00:07:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gordonbennetts1 @CampaignforPubs But we have got to survive the limbo.
1343941898076106752 2020-12-29 23:28:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Brumus49 @YvonneBurdett3 Lol, you just insulted me. I don’t have the ego that you presume. It seems to me that you and Yvonne are the ones fixed in your views on Covid and the EU - nothing else is worthy of your consideration. That is only a good place for your own personal contentment.
1343935686873935875 2020-12-29 23:03:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @YvonneBurdett3 @Brumus49 Not Yvonne, never Yvonne.
1343934402137645058 2020-12-29 22:58:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Brumus49 @YvonneBurdett3 I agree that it should have been widely. But that does not change the lack of depth to your powers of analysis. But as long as you are happy that’s all that matters.
1343932764370968582 2020-12-29 22:51:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Brumus49 @YvonneBurdett3 Well you aren’t reading wide enough if you do not have questions in your mind about it all.
1343925762748002305 2020-12-29 22:24:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Brumus49 @YvonneBurdett3 Pub is shut. I read widely. I think you clearly sit in and watch too much telly tbh.
1343919065212063747 2020-12-29 21:57:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NicolaSturgeon Ever thought that the virus is doing it’s thing regardless of what hell you put Scottish people and businesses through in the name of saving lives?
1343894850152910848 2020-12-29 20:21:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ponte_pele @lucyallan My thoughts on Covid do not just revolve around my pub. I want to@live my life too.
1343878563204915200 2020-12-29 19:16:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ponte_pele @lucyallan The point she makes is that there are questions around the danger level to the bulk of the population. Anyone who does not have doubts about what is happening is not sufficiently well read on the matter.
1343868330915074049 2020-12-29 18:35:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @YvonneBurdett3 Yes you are wrong and a bit silly tbh. Like many, they do not deny Covid. They just raise legitimate questions about whether Government’s response to it is proportionate and appropriate.
1343862027966676994 2020-12-29 18:10:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @52midnight1 @talkRADIO @nickdebois Tbh, I think it’s all just complete incompetence and panic. I spent many years in the Civil Service and the disconnect and stupidity is astounding.
1343859745204146176 2020-12-29 18:01:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @52midnight1 @talkRADIO @nickdebois Cheers. Time is running out for many pubs.  https://t.co/1khsV7rtln
1343859392035368960 2020-12-29 18:00:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lazyfayre @52midnight1 You are probably 60 Covid cases...
1343857482855280640 2020-12-29 17:52:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Zubhaque You only tell part of the story. There is very high absence in the NHS and it’s not as busy as previous years. The Nightengale Hospitals are being dismantled. There are major problems with the testing and number counting. It’s a Government/public sector mess. We are all suffering
1343856569876963330 2020-12-29 17:49:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO @nickdebois We are still in lockdown. My pub has been open for 2 weeks since beginning of November.
1343843310943805440 2020-12-29 16:56:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ClareCraigPath 111 will send an ambulance if certain key words are mentioned on the telephone call - happened to my household on Christmas Eve. Paramedics told me that it’s non-medics dealing with the call and the computer generates the response.
1343840224686845953 2020-12-29 16:44:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jeremy_Hunt I know someone who was in hospital for a non-Covid matter. Was tested positive several times. No Covid symptoms and no Covid treatment, but he is several Covid “cases” and a “Covid admission”. Something is seriously wrong with the number counting.
1343838916152012802 2020-12-29 16:38:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @52midnight1 These might not be new infections/cases - they might be people repeatedly tested once positive.
1343837887176077312 2020-12-29 16:34:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Covid numbers are looking increasingly odd. I know someone who was in hospital for something else, he had no Covid symptoms but tested positive and was re-tested positive repeatedly. On the Covid stats, he would be several Covid cases and a Covid hospital admission.
1343702489389031424 2020-12-29 07:36:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBCHughPym @destinyschild05 Covid patient = someone in hospital who tests positive with a PCR test that may or may not correctly identify live virus and the patient may or may not be admitted to hospital for Covid and may or may not have any Covid symptoms. There’s a problem with the definitions and numbers
1343686724719964161 2020-12-29 06:34:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gregoclinton @CampaignforPubs Hmmm, I think it will pass.
1343629577948704768 2020-12-29 02:47:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NeilDotObrien The pic shows headlines from previous years - this is not new. I’m not a denier, but I do think there is a lot more alarmist disinformation coming from the Govt and the press. £billions on failed track and trace, but not on the NHS. Only one of a few policy failures.  https://t.co/ACCVkT2MLz
1343548846765445121 2020-12-28 21:26:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> When will we see you again? @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/v5MZWHjbWm
1343506089594257408 2020-12-28 18:36:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @iansimpson1860 @CampaignforPubs @BarnsleyCAMRA @BorisJohnson @DanJarvisMP @ThePubChampion @Sacha_Lord @almurray Very true!! I so miss it and there is no sign we are re-opening any time soon.
1343295739443744773 2020-12-28 04:40:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tlm0511 @cricketwyvern Ok, so choice is to put all kids together in schools which is known to spread infection or try to manage safely without kids in schools.
1343294524639076354 2020-12-28 04:35:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tlm0511 @cricketwyvern Not everyone who runs a business has kids - and not everyone with kids who runs a business is totally dependant on school cover.
1343285523545264129 2020-12-28 04:00:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @joannev98321284 @cricketwyvern Only until the vulnerable are vaccinated. My preference throughout, however, has been to protect the vulnerable and let everyone else live their lives in a largely normal way, but we are where we are.
1343283490742284290 2020-12-28 03:51:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @cricketwyvern I usually agree with you, but schools do seem to be generating infections more than anything else so it might seem sensible to keep them closed for a couple of months until this is over. Open businesses instead.
1343180167368372224 2020-12-27 21:01:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mark_BeerArt I’ve answered that. It’s a mystery what is going on.
1343173639529754626 2020-12-27 20:35:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @wellycath But there are 30,000 medical volunteers and army medics who have not been utilised. Also begs the question as to why they were built.
1343172999822893057 2020-12-27 20:32:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Daniel_Grigg @thenctoo Where to start with this ridiculous tweet...
1343172452667555843 2020-12-27 20:30:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Just heard a NHS manager on the news say the Nightengales are a last resort. I would have thought that placing the country under house arrest and tanking the economy would be the last resort.  https://t.co/Zgf60UZFU8
1343165950632321025 2020-12-27 20:04:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DPJHodges Totally over shadowed by his failures on Covid and the ongoing house arrest of the whole population.
1343151086413209605 2020-12-27 19:05:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @charlottemilne0 Ending the house arrest of the population would seem to me to be the starting point.
1343017200010067970 2020-12-27 10:13:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Lerone17 @JuliaHB1 It’s a great opportunity for them to review and clear out their estates.
1343016290139721728 2020-12-27 10:10:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Lerone17 @JuliaHB1 Yes, our lot completely useless. Hopefully it will be over soon.
1343013199331930116 2020-12-27 09:57:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Lerone17 @JuliaHB1 Totally different countries and totally different strategies. Living normally but hamstrung if the virus sneaks in. GK been remarkably helpful if late after a slow start. I worry though that so many pubs are not going to make it through months of closure.
1343008761363968000 2020-12-27 09:40:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Lerone17 @JuliaHB1 The virus is going to spread forever like flu unless we lock ourselves away harder and forever. There’s a vaccine being rolled out for those who want it.
1343000278229000192 2020-12-27 09:06:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Lerone17 @JuliaHB1 I don’t get your thinking. Having choice is about whether we individually lockdown, live what we think is a safe life or behave like “an idiot” as you put it. I cannot see how the “idiots” affect those who decide to lockdown.
1342995695276597248 2020-12-27 08:48:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Lerone17 @JuliaHB1 No, she’s saying everyone should be allowed to make their own decisions like the old days pre-March 2020.
1342991525152747522 2020-12-27 08:31:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LPerrins You were 100% correct. It’s become the Govt’s only device. Honesty, pragmatism, common sense all out the window until the majority of the public catch on.
1342990384096555010 2020-12-27 08:27:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MrMcEnaney Really? I think she just wants a bit more balance than indefinite house arrest for 67 million people.
1342986575269998595 2020-12-27 08:12:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @FraserNelson Maybe testing of all patients in hospital is inflating occupancy - would explain why ICU is a lot lower. Just thoughts. Data is never straightforward.
1342982696310550528 2020-12-27 07:56:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @theydonoak It’s surreal to see inward cash just stop.
1342982092595015681 2020-12-27 07:54:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @theydonoak Damn!
1342975722990796800 2020-12-27 07:28:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OwenJones84 Jeez, do you really think that normal people think about the political views of people at health risk from Covid or any other disease?
1342970644078669824 2020-12-27 07:08:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @leoniedelt “Compliance has dropped” = patience has run out. The fools will keep pushing and then there will be an almighty kickback. January is not a pleasant month in normal times.
1342969894107799553 2020-12-27 07:05:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Patricia344130 I think the greater priority is to end house arrest for 67 million people in the country.
1342969501453844480 2020-12-27 07:04:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NeilDotObrien Why try to discredit people, the public have no interest in that. We want you lot to address the issues properly and strategically. Putting us all under house arrest for the foreseeable future does not  really make sense.
1342965569264480257 2020-12-27 06:48:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scullyp @BeanyMcBeanface You are “aware” Paul, I am living it Like tens of thousands of small businesses. No income since March. We’re facing closure for months. I’ve worked hard in my pub and paid high taxes for 12 years. Tarting up a high street should not be more important than supporting those on it.
1342962381215948800 2020-12-27 06:35:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scullyp @BeanyMcBeanface I used to live in Sutton prior to taking the pub so I know the area. I haven’t been there for 12 years. The point I am making is that we, the businesses your party has put on their knees, could do with that money. We really are desperate. Pearls before swine seems apt.
1342957167717048322 2020-12-27 06:15:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MarcusDeaves @CampaignforPubs @BorisJohnson Dreadful. The on and off and constant limbo is expensive in itself. I do not understand why they think it’s ok to treat an industry in this way.
1342956628136644608 2020-12-27 06:13:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RadicalBrewingM @CampaignforPubs Thanks Mike. I am becoming increasingly worried as the Govt seems intent on tighter and tighter controls and we are being completely ignored both in terms of support and that we can actually operate safely and help individual and community well being.
1342953777272414218 2020-12-27 06:01:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Either let us open and operate safely with reasonable restrictions - or give us proper financial support. Closing us without adequate support should not be an option. @CampaignforPubs
1342946399743320065 2020-12-27 05:32:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford Imagine caring so little about the millions of lives that lockdowns are decimating.
1342945976722616321 2020-12-27 05:30:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scullyp @BeanyMcBeanface This makes me sick to the stomach when you have decimated the small retail and hospitality businesses that occupy those spaces. Disgraceful beyond belief.
1342941751212986371 2020-12-27 05:13:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scoutnick ???
1342938583188054017 2020-12-27 05:01:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scoutnick I’m sorry for anyone affected as I am for all diseases. If your colleagues have locked themselves down since March and still got it then that is really unfortunate. But I’m afraid I and many others don’t want to lock ourselves away like that - we want to live our lives.
1342895035898077185 2020-12-27 02:08:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darklordbarnet @holly_kal Nah, no suggestion of irregularity. Just people feel the need to do things, when sometimes doing nothing is the better option. Indeed, that has been a problem with the Boris Govt during Covid, perpetually impatient and reactive resulting in no clarity and constant change.
1342894471193763840 2020-12-27 02:06:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @maizrapaz @Conservatives Every pub is different. I am as full as Covid restrictions allow when I am permitted to open and I can pay my bills.
1342870284676820992 2020-12-27 00:29:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scoutnick Hands, Face and Space more than enough. If this has proved anything you cannot manage public health by expecting well people to follow extensive rules, placing them under house arrest and by closing businesses.
1342864758287052800 2020-12-27 00:08:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> To me, lockdown and restriction after yesterday’s Christmas Day amnesty seems starkly ridiculous. We need to stop this and let individuals decide whether they want to isolate or not.
1342854716812881921 2020-12-26 23:28:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Nick_Pye Never.
1342824281265369088 2020-12-26 21:27:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Hunting on, pubs shut.                       I deleted my last tweet as it attached an old photo and I don’t want to be accused of misleading. The point I make is that the rules are shambolic. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/fzU15aFTpA
1342820834457563137 2020-12-26 21:13:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CApressoffice @CampaignforPubs The point illustrated here is that hunts are allowed to continue but pubs are required to be shut.
1342818738819760128 2020-12-26 21:05:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @maizrapaz @Conservatives Peter, I lose more being closed than I do when open given current derisory grants so it’s not all about making a profit - in these times it’s cutting losses.
1342818394152824832 2020-12-26 21:03:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jonboyes @EssexPR I didn’t have any from this year. The point remains valid that hunts may and are continuing but pubs are shut.
1342817429085425667 2020-12-26 20:59:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jonboyes @EssexPR How many participants typically?
1342816122886877187 2020-12-26 20:54:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jonboyes @EssexPR  https://t.co/N4EcnryjoU
1342813321804853248 2020-12-26 20:43:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @holly_kal There is no logic really. When opportunities arise for funding they create an idea and apply. The change inevitably upsets some people in the community. And the works take forever causing untold destruction to trade. Then the cycle continues again with the next project.
1342811656171225090 2020-12-26 20:37:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @holly_kal Why do you ask? I am a member, but I play more of an observer role. I have expressed these views before most notably when the daft pedestrianisation plan was proposed back in March.
1342809532876132358 2020-12-26 20:28:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> My experience in Barnet are that these projects comprise local dogooders with no trading experience dreaming up tree planting and pavement widening projects that cause controversy and many months of disruption whilst works are undertaken. Govt needs to go away for a while.
1342806055588397062 2020-12-26 20:14:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ryanstaceychef @CampaignforPubs The fact that the Govt are entrenched in a completely ridiculous and damaging policy of perpetual lockdown does not mean that we should not push for that to end.  We are in real danger of this situation never ending otherwise if vaccines don’t deliver fast impacts for example.
1342750922460581889 2020-12-26 16:35:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Businesses need to call for lockdown to end with the dawn of the New Year. It’s simply not sustainable; we are pivotal to well being and community; we need support to recover; restrictions need to be minimised to Hands, Face &amp; Space; choices restored. @campaignforpubs
1342661598117294080 2020-12-26 10:40:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford And the thousands of small business owners and self-employed who have paid for the NHS but are now closed down and bled dry because the Govt cannot resource/organise the NHS to cope. Nightingales built but left empty. The current strategy is neither fair nor sustainable.
1342660132434374656 2020-12-26 10:34:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Great point here about the Scottish Govt’s contempt for hospitality compared to their new obsession with seed potatoes. Hospitality in Scotland directly employs over 220,000 people. It accounts for £7.9bn in turnover and £4bn to the Scottish economy in wages and profits.
1342603176562864128 2020-12-26 06:48:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WhatIsL03139271 @WizzthatL @CampaignforPubs Dreadful, sorry and I hope all goes well with the baby and the future.
1342561939692646403 2020-12-26 04:04:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @staffsbrewery @Conservatives ...you clearly need more to drink as you are far too observant for this time on Christmas Day....😂😂😂
1342561334798516224 2020-12-26 04:02:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @staffsbrewery @Conservatives You caught me out picking random pics from the internet....😂😂😂
1342523086562856960 2020-12-26 01:30:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @Conservatives Too costly and risky.
1342521385780981765 2020-12-26 01:23:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @Conservatives I will enjoy the party when it’s over. We cannot close until Easter on existing grants. We need to be allowed to trade or we need to be fully compensated.
1342494148985810946 2020-12-25 23:35:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I probably shouldn’t have done this, but I have used some of my Government lockdown support grant for Christmas dinner.  https://t.co/VZD8NRuydB
1342455466933297153 2020-12-25 21:01:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Conservatives Please enjoy this beautiful scene illustrative of what you have done to High Streets across the country.  https://t.co/DPi2D858Q2
1342454265567186946 2020-12-25 20:56:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Joyous Christmas scenes from High Streets around the newly independent United Kingdom. Thank you for closing down our country @Conservatives  https://t.co/snDw3ClDny
1342449536468455426 2020-12-25 20:38:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LMCrankyPants Thank you...our only hope is that we are able to end it in 2021.

1342377414555533312 2020-12-25 15:51:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LordAshcroft How useless the second Chamber has been whilst the whole country has been stripped of its rights and freedoms and placed under house arrest.
1342375165041238016 2020-12-25 15:42:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @drphilhammond Health is holistic.
1342305019606032384 2020-12-25 11:03:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @woodsharp They have clearly decided that’s too much effort so they are going to disrupt our lives and destroy businesses instead.
1342291017442205697 2020-12-25 10:08:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @bobgranleese Small Business Minister is doing very little....
1342282829485506567 2020-12-25 09:35:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darrengrimes_ Covid is his Iraq War.
1342282619141160961 2020-12-25 09:34:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jamin2g You missed 2020: fucks Covid.
1342225938264821761 2020-12-25 05:49:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @matt_dathan @MrHarryCole His Covid Regs don’t leave much room for manoeuvre as everywhere is shut and we are under house arrest.
1342221515761344519 2020-12-25 05:32:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @r80923377 @talkRADIO @BorisJohnson @thejamesmax Nah, just living more normally with a clear understanding of our individual risk and a NHS able to cope as opposed to requiring the whole fckn country to be under house arrest because the NHS might get overloaded.
1342220678674702351 2020-12-25 05:28:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @r80923377 @talkRADIO @BorisJohnson @thejamesmax Yes. I would have got perspective on it long before now, I would never have sanctioned a fear driven authoritarian approach that has put the country on its knees.
1342216665145217024 2020-12-25 05:12:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO @BorisJohnson @thejamesmax He’s a twit. He could not have handled Covid worse. Dreading 2021.
1342214827503194113 2020-12-25 05:05:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson I would like you to release us from house arrest.
1342200909699362820 2020-12-25 04:10:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisMasonBBC It might be if we weren’t under house arrest.
1342198628274888705 2020-12-25 04:01:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MPIainDS What about everyone held under house arrest and persecuted in the U.K. by @Conservatives
1342198266205769731 2020-12-25 03:59:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer There ain’t nothing happy about being under house arrest and losing your livelihood since March.
1342191859041501185 2020-12-25 03:34:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jeremy_Hunt @BorisJohnson Yeah, jolly good. Can you end our house arrest now?
1342189142411784192 2020-12-25 03:23:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @clivemcca Great pic Clive!!
1342169775829626886 2020-12-25 02:06:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @drdagly I appreciate your hard work. The failure here is that the Govt doesn’t have enough of you. And I’ve had no income since March, people are being held under house arrest and we are required to follow lots of contradictory rules. So there is much more to it than your tweet.
1342157871014944773 2020-12-25 01:19:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Conservatives No good to a country that you have in perpetual lockdown.
1342156306254278656 2020-12-25 01:12:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NicolaSturgeon The loss of root potatoes and student holidays are going to make a huge difference to the country you have decimated this year for Covid 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1342145073895645184 2020-12-25 00:28:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jane_hoar Yes, I get that. I’ve lost some people very close over the years.
1342123474442182656 2020-12-24 23:02:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson Who cares...sort out Covid you twat...
1342120847490822144 2020-12-24 22:52:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> After a year of house arrest, ridiculous restrictions and intrusions upon our lives, loss of my livelihood and incompetent and corrupt political leadership I’m not celebrating Christmas and I’m not wishing anyone a Merry Christmas because it f@cken ain’t.
1342115459630387200 2020-12-24 22:30:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scullyp @diborhome Your party has spent the year destroying small business and there is no end in sight.
1342115223537377284 2020-12-24 22:29:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oldmudgie Idiotic rule.
1342113031376035840 2020-12-24 22:20:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CLHNews @murderersphil I share your pain...if we do not open in early January then I have £thousands of stock wasted. The soonest London be moved to tier 3 was supposed to be 18 December, we were closed on 14th. On top of no income since March and overheads far exceeding grant. It cannot continue.
1342104960952127488 2020-12-24 21:48:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AJPOnline @ProtectPubs @UKHospKate @CAMRA_Official @beerandpub @forpubs @CampaignforPubs @GBPubConfed Yes, we need to find commonality and more action to fight this existential threat...
1342104379621576706 2020-12-24 21:46:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RoseNorwich @CampaignforPubs @CityOfAle @labourlewis @BeehiveNorwich @thevinenorwich @murderersphil @EagleNorwich @RogerProtzBeer Good luck Dawn...we are all down the swanney...
1342099721607905281 2020-12-24 21:28:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AndyBurnhamGM All politicians have massively let us down this year.
1342096391477276675 2020-12-24 21:14:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @CampaignforPubs Not necessarily talking about normality in January - a proper support package will do.
1342084348804276232 2020-12-24 20:26:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IanJ21289455 I get it completely. The rebels need to do a lot more to get this Govt to stop. They will lose massive support if they don’t. How could anyone still vote for anything Conservative after what they have done.
1342083064319660032 2020-12-24 20:21:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IanJ21289455 @JamesCleverly But it is a Conservative Government imposing it upon us.
1342056002875760640 2020-12-24 18:34:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Thinkerist @JamesCleverly @Conservatives It won’t help you.  https://t.co/A8Y8gDer5f
1342055381783228416 2020-12-24 18:31:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Thinkerist @JamesCleverly Londoners, including your own supporters, will do whatever is necessary to keep @Conservatives from winning until you stop your destructive, lunatic policies and remove Johnson and Hancock.
1342053419339689987 2020-12-24 18:24:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JamesCleverly No-one bearing a Conservative badge should get anyone’s vote until you stop destroying viable businesses with lockdowns and restrictions without giving them adequate support.
1342051597518581761 2020-12-24 18:16:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher @UKHospKate @CAMRA_Official @beerandpub @forpubs @CampaignforPubs @GBPubConfed 100% agree. Appalling, how can that tenant possibly afford full rent. We need to move from a passive paper campaign to proactive protest. It’s just not acceptable for us to be treated in this way.
1342046869250338816 2020-12-24 17:58:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is the best hope for hospitality that I’ve seen - the Official Monster Raving Looney Party is proposing a Magic Money Tree for every home to combat @Conservatives lunatic perpetual lockdown policies.
1342044669245599752 2020-12-24 17:49:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @deladoggy @CampaignforPubs And 2021 will be exactly the same if we stand back and let it happen.
1342040451617087488 2020-12-24 17:32:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @debolu101 @thenctoo I’ve not been paid since March because my business has been closed and restricted to protect the NHS. The Govt has let us both down: you deserve fair pay and I deserve an NHS that doesn’t need me to close down in order for it to cope.
1342036163121602561 2020-12-24 17:15:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Hospitality is being treated appallingly. We have got to move from a passive paper campaign to a more pro-active physical campaign. Show our MPs that the communities they rely upon for their votes will not tolerate our sacrifice.
1342029176753311744 2020-12-24 16:47:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @stephenlfreeman @Conservatives We should be treated fairly and that is not happening. All the campaign groups need to engage with each other, business owners, supply chains, staff, communities and hospitality users to demand this. We need to be prepared to be more physical and visible as required.
1342026827129303041 2020-12-24 16:38:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Corinne78 We face a challenge for survival. My view is that all the campaign groups need to engage with each other, business owners, supply chains, staff, communities and hospitality users to form a more physical and visible resistance. Letters and talking is clearly not working.
1342020602320842752 2020-12-24 16:13:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We have tried hard, but I feel like all hospitality campaigns have failed in 2020. No solution on rents, derisory grants and most venues now closed indefinitely. We need to do it differently in 2021. @UKHospKate @CAMRA_Official @beerandpub @forpubs @CampaignforPubs @GBPubConfed
1342018395370364928 2020-12-24 16:04:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @sparkloaf26 @Conservatives I have little confidence tbh.
1342013379242848261 2020-12-24 15:44:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I feel so bad for the pub trade, but we have not suffered anywhere near as much as the nightclub industry. I am not celebrating Christmas as there really is nothing to celebrate. Shafted by a Govt and no end in sight. We cannot sit back and take this in 2021.
1342010555985494018 2020-12-24 15:33:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Wingers76 @UKHospKate @UKHofficial @beerandpub Regrettably they have been warning of this for 10 months and the Government turn the screws more and more. It is evident that they intend to sacrifice the current incumbents of hospitality venues.
1342000226379423751 2020-12-24 14:52:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @propertyedwin @CampaignforPubs It’s devastating to see and even more devastating to be part of.
1341953776798867462 2020-12-24 11:48:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I have to say that I have zero interest in Brexit whilst the country is in the current state due to @Conservatives handling of Covid. The priority needs to be to exit Covid lockdowns and restrictions and return us to normality.
1341949763374239744 2020-12-24 11:32:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ClaireCoutinho I think it’s the blatant lining of pockets that @Conservatives have been up to during Covid whilst at the same decimating industries such as hospitality. Your party will never recover from what you have done in 2020.
1341912951670919170 2020-12-24 09:05:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JackHodgson7 @CampaignforPubs @BorisJohnson @RishiSunak Thanks Jack. We cannot be ignored any longer. Happy Christmas to you too.
1341912695742857217 2020-12-24 09:04:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR Happy Christmas Adam, it certainly isn’t a normal one for us publicans and we all have great anxiety and frustration for the future.
1341910652798054401 2020-12-24 08:56:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BallWorrall @CampaignforPubs Agree. We must not be treated as badly by Govt in 2021.
1341900197073453062 2020-12-24 08:15:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Cruxy57 @CHistorians @BorisJohnson He didn’t say which Easter...
1341894157535735809 2020-12-24 07:51:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman @CampaignforPubs Totally relate to that. The two weeks open after the November lockdown was great, people so happy to be out and I was so happy to have them and do what I do. We ought to be part of the solution.
1341888654466306049 2020-12-24 07:29:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CHistorians Have a great Christmas Ruth, hopefully this will be over soon.
1341879652390985728 2020-12-24 06:53:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lord_forsyth @ethan_thoburn She has been vitriolic about pubs and pub goers and done much to destroy the whole industry in Scotland. She then breaks her own rules in a pub. It’s pubs that need a break from her.
1341876690914603009 2020-12-24 06:41:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Christmas Eve is the busiest night of the year at the Mitre, always with a great atmosphere. This year we are closed, the business is destroyed by a year of chaotic Govt and no clue when or if we will re-open. We need monumental change in January 2021. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/IRV4Y0Acpr
1341859238944120838 2020-12-24 05:32:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DPJHodges The problem is that both sides of the argument do not have the information to make the decision.  More needs to be known about those 750 deaths versus the impacts of lockdown to see how the two options balance.
1341857631703609344 2020-12-24 05:26:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavesWondering These things are never that simple. To even contemplate doing something like this we would need to commission an opinion probably at the cost of £10-£20k. We would then need to fund the Defence of those individually fined. If we lose we pay the fines and legal costs.
1341824672455864323 2020-12-24 03:15:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BenThomasLD It’s a minefield of dangers regardless.
1341823038573178882 2020-12-24 03:08:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BenThomasLD There’s a scientific view that trying to subdue it means it cannot naturally evolve to a less dangerous state. We are sort of living with it, but living under house arrest.
1341814997006036994 2020-12-24 02:36:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @kingstontoon Yes, difficult to fathom when millions are suffering from the current approach, £billions is being wasted and it’s going nowhere except the wrong direction. Data in Westminster is disconnected from reality.
1341808924186558466 2020-12-24 02:12:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Alternative strategy - live with it and manage it locally. 1) refocus resources to NHS capacity and protecting those most at risk; 2) delegate these matters to each community; 3) two levels of restriction - open or closed - managed by the community. No Govt tiers.
1341778066411048964 2020-12-24 00:09:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pub_that @RishiSunak Typical, he disappears the minute he owes us all money for his mates closing us down...
1341761866226429952 2020-12-23 23:05:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Amazing that the most well known pub landlord, @almurray , is an ambassador for @campaign for pubs. Join us to help preserve the best independently run pubs and breweries.
1341732203181580295 2020-12-23 21:07:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mmjblair And after the vitriol she has spouted about the irresponsible behaviour of pubs and pub goers - and the way she has treated the industry with utter contempt.
1341717741091364864 2020-12-23 20:10:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I managed to silence a Scottish Nationalist. 😂😂😂
1341707380162215937 2020-12-23 19:29:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Aibagawa You don’t answer the question. Takeaway is never going to pay for the overheads of an otherwise busy pub. Do you think it’s fair to bankrupt pub families?
1341704884530327552 2020-12-23 19:19:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @suecresswell01 @fmwales They have the highest amount of people who have been recorded as having died within 28 days of having received a PCR tests run at an unknown CT rate that could have picked up dead viral fragments that have no relevance whatsoever to the cause of death.
1341704089873297409 2020-12-23 19:15:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Aibagawa Of course you know it. You are a Scottish Nationalist!! Seriously, do you really think it’s reasonable to let these businesses go bankrupt? These are individuals with families too.
1341702255439974400 2020-12-23 19:08:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Aibagawa Fascism (/ˈfæʃɪzəm/) is a form of far-right, authoritarian ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of the economy which came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.
1341698969370583041 2020-12-23 18:55:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Aibagawa @DuncanBannatyne So it is acceptable to you that the Scottish Government does not save Publicans from going bankrupt? Fascist.
1341696906737676289 2020-12-23 18:47:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Aibagawa @DuncanBannatyne Highly debatable point there, but the morality to leave businesses to go bankrupt is not. Restrict for the public good, then fully pay from the public purse. Her position on pubs is indefensible. She will pay a terrible price at the ballot box for her authoritarianism &amp; contempt.
1341695567852949504 2020-12-23 18:42:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @twocitiesnickie @ShaunBaileyUK There is absolutely no reason why anyone should ever vote for anyone with any connection to @Conservatives - ruined the country in 2020. This is not the most dangerous virus in 100 years, it’s the most dangerous Govt in 100 years.
1341682820037697543 2020-12-23 17:51:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DuncanBannatyne Yes, but we haven’t all stigmatised and decimated the pub industry in Scotland.
1341674642864545793 2020-12-23 17:18:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 @CampaignforPubs She has been so vitriolic about pubs.
1341674470155702273 2020-12-23 17:18:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jocoxbrown @CampaignforPubs She has been so vitriolic about pubs.
1341569919117344770 2020-12-23 10:22:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OllyDeed @Gav56935031 @MarkkMcHugh Your assumption being Ollie that the PCR test is of high accuracy and is diagnosing “cases”, hospitalisations and “deaths with” correctly. But that is academic to a certain extent as the vaccination is available and that is a politically more palatable way out.
1341533832613380096 2020-12-23 07:59:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @albertdogman123 Bessie.
1341521905812189184 2020-12-23 07:12:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Sacha_Lord Notice. They pay no notice to anything. They have shafted us too many times. It’s time to accept none of it and tell them to big off unless they are going to show hospitality some consideration.
1341516142918180865 2020-12-23 06:49:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Some good news - Nicola Sturgeon has been caught on camera not wearing a mask whilst walking around a pub. @CampaignforPubs 😂😂😂😂  https://t.co/C2LV2JQl0R
1341514536164143106 2020-12-23 06:42:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OllyDeed @MarkkMcHugh You need a drink to chill Ollie....it’s the Covid ship that has sailed....
1341494702584041481 2020-12-23 05:23:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavesWondering It isn’t an option believe me.
1341488477590970373 2020-12-23 04:59:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavesWondering We have a lot to lose with even more debt on fines and legal costs.
1341485606162100230 2020-12-23 04:47:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gravydinner1 @CampaignforPubs You have made it about you - quite clearly you are just a bag of wind with not an ounce of empathy and quite happy to put the risk on others whilst you do bigger all but abuse them. Jog on.
1341482239947845637 2020-12-23 04:34:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gravydinner1 @CampaignforPubs Sounds like it.

1341479918895587332 2020-12-23 04:25:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gravydinner1 @CampaignforPubs It’s your freedom too. Happy to join up with everyone and take some concerted action. Not happy to be a patsy at your suggestion.
1341479503823052804 2020-12-23 04:23:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gravydinner1 @CampaignforPubs No, I’m just not foolish.
1341478775809339394 2020-12-23 04:20:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gravydinner1 @CampaignforPubs That’s not campaigning. And you shouldn’t expect me to take such action and to be personally destroyed by fines and closure. We need to unite against it.
1341474679744319488 2020-12-23 04:04:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Claire25938202 @AndrewP94145670 @CampaignforPubs We’ll all be individually shut down, heavily fined and have our licences revoked. We need to rise up as a nation, not expect Publicans or other individual business people to take a risk that will almost certainly result in disaster for them.
1341473439417307142 2020-12-23 03:59:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavesWondering It’s tough, only those unaffected will push lockdown with no support. One of the pubs in Barnet got fined £1,000 for some people drinking takeaway outside the front on Armisice Sunday...the nation needs to rise, not small groups of individuals.
1341471491918061569 2020-12-23 03:51:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gravydinner1 @CampaignforPubs I’ve answered this so many times on this thread. If you wanna lodge £250,000 on my account I might consider it.
1341461634389295108 2020-12-23 03:12:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavesWondering I know you mean well but no individual should take that risk which would most likely be personally ruinous. If we are going to resist then the nation needs to resist together, not sit back and let a poor publican take the flak.

1341233911758639107 2020-12-22 12:07:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I have no confidence in @BorisJohnson because he has no strategy, he does not question Sage and lacks detail, his rules don’t make sense, he has failed to compensate affected sectors/individuals, he blames, is divisive and authoritarian. Why do you have no confidence in him?

1341119571705671685 2020-12-22 04:33:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Galster2016 @CampaignforPubs Aside from rent which Is a legal liability, we have employer furlough costs, gas, electricity, water, insurance, maintenance of building and equipment, licensing, telecoms, refuse and stock losses which are generated from stop/start and will increase as closure continues.
1341117123024875523 2020-12-22 04:23:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Galster2016 @CampaignforPubs Who is guaranteed heavy subsidisation of rents? We are relying on the goodwill of our landlords because the govt has done nothing to sort commercial rents. Mine, Greene King, has been very good, but I cannot guarantee that. Other landlords have done nothing.
1341093114774233089 2020-12-22 02:48:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @joysoftechnolog @CampaignforPubs @greeneking has been very supportive to their tenants and their input will make a huge difference in terms of survival for many. Other landlords have not been so helpful. The Govt has the power to sort this out for all concerned through legislation on rents and support.
1341078784494235648 2020-12-22 01:51:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EstherMcVey1 How? Your boss has shut everything and will not let us leave our homes!!! We’d like him to bog off and put a Conservative in charge.
1341074811624304643 2020-12-22 01:35:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @smudge90210 @CampaignforPubs Yes, then they still wriggled put of it. Challenged at Court, now at Appeal stage.

1341018187933036544 2020-12-21 21:50:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It’s been 24 hours and tier 4 has failed so we’re moving to tier 5.

1341009500912889862 2020-12-21 21:15:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pitzwang @RobJoshua10 @CampaignforPubs Yes, the public needs to act or there needs to be a legal challenge sponsored by the large corporates. Small independent businesses on their knees cannot possibly take it on.

Businesses cannot take the risk of breaking the law as it will just give us more financial burden. The collective public needs to tell Govt that it is not acceptable to treat businesses in this way.
1341003809263390720 2020-12-21 20:53:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GyllKing @CampaignforPubs Dreadful. We cannot accept this any longer.

1341002191943950336 2020-12-21 20:46:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @crownbristol @CampaignforPubs Dreadful. I have been fortunate that @greeneking has been very good with rent support. This cannot go on for any of us though.

1340998517612027904 2020-12-21 20:32:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> My monthly overheads for being closed are probably going to be around £12,000. The Government grant is £2,000 a month. That’s £48,000 versus £8,000 Govt support if we are closed until spring. I’ve not earned anything since March. Now see the problem for business? @CampaignforPubs

1340971514020114432 2020-12-21 18:44:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The minutes of the Nervtag meeting clearly express a lot of uncertainty and the advice is of “moderate” reliability yet the PM’s Briefing was definitive and we are locked down. Gives a good insight into what is happening. It has to help unravel matters one way or another.
1340966389700587521 2020-12-21 18:24:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @s8mb @tomhfh I think he’s comparing what is said in the minutes of Nervetag to what was said to the nation at the Briefing.
1340962953760284672 2020-12-21 18:10:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CHistorians I cannot see people allowing it to continue like this so chin up for some sort of breakthrough. Either the new variant is the zombie apocalypse and we’ll all be glad of being locked up - or it will be absolutely clear that there is some unreasonable hype.

1340855842380410880 2020-12-21 11:05:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DominicRaab What about freedom to leave our homes? To see our families and friends? To trade? To shop? To go to a pub or restaurant? To travel? To protest?
1340821926978174978 2020-12-21 08:50:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @jedpc @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse I have given a methodology. There has been 9 months. There ought to have been a disaster deployment plan anyway. TBH you are the one with the type of civil service platitudes that I used to know “it takes 10 years...”. You are talking to someone who knows the internal workings.

I have little confidence, however, that it has been done to a great extent in dealing with increased hospital demand evidenced by the reliance on private sector track and trace that has cost £billions.
1340771455475322881 2020-12-21 05:29:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @jedpc @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse The issue is not just about ICU, the usage of which, and intubation as a treatment, has reduced as I understand. Not all parts of a job are highly skilled so there is undoubtedly significant scope to redefine the roles and organisation throughout the NHS.
1340763665071542273 2020-12-21 04:59:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @jedpc @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse It is easier for a lazy Civil Service to restrict the public or to spend £billions on failed projects with the private sector than it is for them to mobilise massive change within to meet a new and urgent challenge. Previous strong PMs have noted this. I worked in it for 21 years
1340760477287272449 2020-12-21 04:46:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @jedpc @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse 3. If you think that is the only solution then I am correct about a lack of lateral thinking and drive.

It should be in no way acceptable to let certain individuals go bankrupt.

Govt should be relying upon capturing hearts and minds, not division &amp; fines; 3. Govt should have focussed on building the NHS from March; 4. Businesses and individuals should be fully compensated

That is not happening in the U.K. It’s all random and legitimate questions and alternative strategies are being dismissed or ignored.

The Govt has lost a lot of hearts and minds through inaccurate info/lies, incompetence/lack of strategy and authoritarianism.

We cannot open our businesses and I have had no income since March. We are banned from protesting. We cannot meet our families or friends in our homes. We cannot leave certain areas like London.

Indeed, the average age of death is higher than life expectancy. No two ways about it, the handling has been crap.

Loads of people doing nothing on furlough. This is not the zombie apocalypse: Covid is survivable in over 99% of cases albeit with some requiring hospital treatment. Billions wasted on track and trace and isolation.

Let’s share it - everyone gives up 50% of their income until it’s sorted.
1340595326844080129 2020-12-20 17:50:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell Now that would be great!!
1340594073103720449 2020-12-20 17:45:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell Cool. It was a ridiculous rule anyway.
1340592083271376898 2020-12-20 17:37:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @johnwdady @educateyoself3 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse No, we’re not sharing it because you don’t mind me going bankrupt - what about you and everyone else paying equally for me being forced to close?  I’m happy to take a financial hit if it’s fair, but I’m not happy to go bankrupt if everyone else doesn’t.
1340591185589661698 2020-12-20 17:33:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell Yes, I think they changed the tier 3 too so there was no pre-order required and patrons could enter the premises.
1340588711201923073 2020-12-20 17:23:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell I think this was changed in the new Tier 3.
1340588447577346048 2020-12-20 17:22:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @4flipssake @JoannaMary56 @rupert_pearse Mate, things have to be said in many ways. Most of the responses are just silly emotion. The “experts” have said that Covid cannot be stopped - the sole reason we are causing untold damage in locking down is so the NHS does not get overloaded. We need a bigger and better NHS.
1340580358144835584 2020-12-20 16:50:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JoannaMary56 @rupert_pearse Now that’s not true, we all have our peaks and troughs.
1340531591555280896 2020-12-20 13:36:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @nurseybird1 @OldSwanBob @rupert_pearse Read what I wrote. I am supporting a better NHS that doesn’t fail in the way it is failing causing lots of different pains to lots of different people.

1340417545225064450 2020-12-20 06:03:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Great to visit another @CampaignforPubs NEC member @TheVickyMD at the fantastic @TheCellarHouse  https://t.co/T8pkZpphNF
1340377009621512193 2020-12-20 03:22:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Adnamscastleinn @eggylegs29 @MerlinFDC4 Nightmare. I’ve got loads of beer in the cellar that is best before in January. One thing that might save us is the schools being closed, rates will plummet as the schools are causing it.
1340373118230118400 2020-12-20 03:07:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Adnamscastleinn @MerlinFDC4 @eggylegs29 I’m guessing, but we’re going to have a very rocky ride, probably mostly closed, until Easter, maybe the summer. The Govt and their advisers are terrified of the speed of spread overwhelming the NHS which will be the ultimate failure.
1340372240009969664 2020-12-20 03:03:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ellinst @GeeWhistler @rupert_pearse It’s not that simple.

1340345307645816833 2020-12-20 01:16:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @gasdoc82 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse It’s not a month old, you have misread the graphs.
1340345173650399240 2020-12-20 01:16:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CCTV_etc It’s a shambles. The problem is them. Lack of investment in the NHS, everything they touch fails, crap tests, decision making based on crap data - they don’t want to end up with a situation where they run out of hospital space, an issue of their creation. So ultra risk averse.
1340344321887903744 2020-12-20 01:12:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @gasdoc82 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse Because it’s no busier than previous years.

1340335921745588225 2020-12-20 00:39:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gasdoc82 @educateyoself3 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse I have no anger at the NHS, though it undoubtedly needs a shake up too - all my anger is directed at the Government for getting us into this state.
1340333182189768704 2020-12-20 00:28:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @gasdoc82 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse The NHS has been under resourced for many years and bed numbers per population are lower than other similar countries. We should have had a Pandemic Plan. It is highly debatable whether this is a once in a 100 year pandemic. There is no debate that the Govt has made a mess of it.
1340330887066640385 2020-12-20 00:19:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gasdoc82 @educateyoself3 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse Going back to my original point, this is institutional failure. Never again should life be curtailed and ruined like this because we have an NHS that cannot cope.
1340322765803544578 2020-12-19 23:47:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ellinst @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse Get a grip.

1340321209700012032 2020-12-19 23:40:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OldSwanBob @rupert_pearse He stated he was busy. No-one is not questionable.

1340289678780542977 2020-12-19 21:35:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse Oh please stop the emotional crap which is at odds with your Twitter name. I did not say anyone is lying. I just gave a view on the bigger picture. Are we still allowed to express views or does that affect the virus and the NHS too?
1340286434998169600 2020-12-19 21:22:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @educateyoself3 @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse Emotions and hysteria aside, London is nowhere near the peak ICU reached earlier in the year. The principle that the NHS should protect us, not that we surrender our freedoms and limited wealth to its inadequacy is undoubtedly correct. These are the points I make.  https://t.co/KlCmjyuH4T
1340262722815070208 2020-12-19 19:48:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Marie35086471 @rupert_pearse Eeerm, and a nurse or Dr telling me I need to put my life on hold and potentially go bankrupt because they are busy is not condescending?
1340248345600811014 2020-12-19 18:51:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @rupert_pearse I don’t doubt that you are clearly feeling busy right now and you do a job that I could not do; but fundamentally that should not curtail normal life and ruin many people to the extent that it is. This is an institutional failure of Govt way beyond your perspective of being busy
1340169459202404354 2020-12-19 13:37:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> For owners and workers, people who visit daily or weekly who maybe live alone or have a routine from work or dropping off kids, even those visiting occasionally and the supply chain, the closure of pubs, cafes and restaurants is a devastating blow to mental health and well being.
1340063428875083778 2020-12-19 06:36:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @deladoggy @CampaignforPubs @greeneking That’s awful. We will all keep pushing. This is an unprecedented situation and it is difficult to fathom why Govt has sacrificed us in this way.

1340058886477373440 2020-12-19 06:18:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Juliest101 As others have said, it is an abdication of our adulthood and basic freedoms and rights to want a Govt that interferes in our social lives to the degree that it has since March.

1339978533804920838 2020-12-19 00:59:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Really fantastic that the most famous pub landlord, Al Murray, is supporting @CampaignforPubs .

1339951300184858628 2020-12-18 23:10:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’ve just sorted my rent for the whole of this year with Greene King and I have to say that they have been extraordinarily supportive. This is the difference between me really struggling and survival. The industry needs to follow their lead. Thanks @greeneking @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/15unkGVRUz
1339943030518935552 2020-12-18 22:38:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford In a free society we all have personal responsibility to assess our own risks and choose how we manage them. This is where Drs like you have got it wrong. You are blinded to the harm that your authoritarianism is causing. The prescribed cure is a lot worse than the disease.

Is there appetite amongst other campaigners @CampaignforPubs @UKHospKate @beerandpub
1339841352939565057 2020-12-18 15:54:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is spot on - as a wet pub we’ve been making 1,000 meals a week as a result of Government Order in tier 2 whilst UNICEF are feeding U.K. children. When will things make sense again?

1339621332456247296 2020-12-18 01:19:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gregsmith_uk Your party has made the mistake of giving them the powers of the Coronavirus Act for another 6 months and the response has been increasing levels of unreasonable lockdown. You now need to work with @SirGrahamBrady to depose them without delay. @Conservatives will not be forgiven.
1339607661638266880 2020-12-18 00:25:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DPJHodges a) get the data right. b) look at the wider picture c) restore our liberties.
1339603058800488454 2020-12-18 00:07:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MerlinFDC4 It’s devastating to have your business closed regardless of whether there is justification. And in this case there is no justification. We all share your pain. Anger, disbelief and completely lost all motivation.

1339553096737894400 2020-12-17 20:48:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @StephenKing In the U.K., the average age of death is 82, higher than life expectancy. Surely if Covid deaths were actually comparable to an atomic bomb on St. Louis then the average age of death would be much lower?
1339551483403128834 2020-12-17 20:42:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Tobias_Ellwood Liar. I know someone who goes to these events and it’s a party.
1339543914894794752 2020-12-17 20:12:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @wemustleave1 From what? I’m not safe. No income since March. 12 years work ruined.

1339539698860081154 2020-12-17 19:55:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> These decisions are remarkably naive to the exasperation within the nation. I fear that the Parliament is completely losing the consent and control of the population.

There was no viable alternative for many at the time - and I will clarify now that I supported EU change for the same left wing reasons that Jeremy Corbyn did before he became leader. I will never forgive either party.
1339521489226362880 2020-12-17 18:43:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’m paying for my business to be restricted and now closed by the likes of this twat ⁦⁦@Tobias_Ellwood⁩ who attends a Christmas party.

1339501288766234627 2020-12-17 17:22:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The ridiculousness of millions of people waiting to hear from the Govt as to whether they can go out to a restaurant or pub. What have we become?

So don’t take it out on people like me or people who work for people like me. Your anger needs to be directed at those making us do this.
1339346648825278464 2020-12-17 07:08:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ghost36hop9 That’s horrendous, almost as bad as the first lockdown. I’m at my home in Norfolk, tier 2, and it’s deserted, restaurants really suffering because no outdoor space and now people are not travelling from tier 3 areas. This nonsense has got to stop.

1339238438328012802 2020-12-16 23:58:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The twit doesn’t get that we should have retained our choices from the outset.

1339228897049780225 2020-12-16 23:20:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @baggins71 @BorisJohnson Not anymore. @Conservatives destroying business and hurting those who work hard. It’s a disgrace.
1339227899216408582 2020-12-16 23:16:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> And let’s not forget the staff. They get a 20% pay cut over Christmas - I simply cannot afford to top up - and one new and superb member of staff loses her job as she doesn’t qualify for furlough. @BorisJohnson you are hurting people who work hard and do not deserve it.
1339205191011332097 2020-12-16 21:46:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SadiqKhan You don’t know how hard it is to see a decade plus of hard work destroyed, to have no income since March, to spend money and work incredibly hard to make a premises safe and the. to be closed and further restricted at will, without evidence. Your position has chopped and changed.
1339200039026118659 2020-12-16 21:25:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher I had to lose the most brilliant new employee who had been with us for just a week. Doesn’t qualify for furlough and I cannot possibly afford to pay her.
1339192150555299842 2020-12-16 20:54:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> “5G is going to take Christmas to the next level” - yes, the lowest level that the Government bans us from going to pubs and restaurants!! The situation is ridiculousness beyond belief.  https://t.co/7CBqVh2Uk4
1339190278259789824 2020-12-16 20:46:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CHistorians It looks so dangerous doesn’t it!!
1339041329884631040 2020-12-16 10:55:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WhiteHorseDover @EiGroupplc @ThePubChampion @ProtectPubs @CampaignforPubs @DDSCAMRA Madness, looks so lovely.
1338981152393203714 2020-12-16 06:55:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR @CampaignforPubs Cheers, you too...hopefully we all make it to the other side whenever that may be...
1338980535968931845 2020-12-16 06:53:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> A great socially distanced and safe last night in tier 2...going to miss the buzz...we all need this to be completely over very soon...@CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/3C61PKRe03
1338836533223239691 2020-12-15 21:21:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Says it all....this is not science...
1338818534932148229 2020-12-15 20:09:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @YorkshireGrey @ProtectPubs This is awful. Big business wins the lease back on a pub that undoubtedly benefits from an independent operator. I wish you all the best.
1338808104532762624 2020-12-15 19:28:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher Great news!
1338795546211921921 2020-12-15 18:38:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Got my posters ready for the windows....  https://t.co/mjmclPvHCk
1338775038309396482 2020-12-15 17:16:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @barbiographer @CampaignforPubs Thanks Scott, you have had it a lot  https://t.co/M4tHEubyzU is ridiculousness beyond belief that you are restricted to no alcohol and closing at 6pm. Best luck to you.
1338771808141651968 2020-12-15 17:04:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We were busy last night with people who want a safe place to meet up and get some normality in these bizarre times. I suspect that tonight, our last night open for an indeterminate period, will be the same. Hospitality is part of the solution, not the problem. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/Aa7O94dTsy
1338761786523267074 2020-12-15 16:24:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @c_souch I get that it causes complications all round. My point is that closing pubs is not going to solve an infection taking place in schools.
1338613638446329857 2020-12-15 06:35:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @quarrygirl Thanks so much, really nice to hear amongst all the gloom today.  I hope the closure won’t be too long. Let me know when you are next in and I will come and have a chat.

1338609579610017793 2020-12-15 06:19:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @bftwni Maybe there’s a reason why we have never been able to stop flu....
1338609268036165635 2020-12-15 06:18:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darklordbarnet Or maybe we just have a virus that cannot be stopped in the ways the Government are trying to stop it - and the Government are doing more harm than good.
1338550094900162560 2020-12-15 02:23:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tefltheatre I fear that you may be right...
1338548051678552064 2020-12-15 02:14:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tefltheatre Thank you. Enough is enough!!
1338547741945950215 2020-12-15 02:13:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @_F1ken Thanks Ken, we desperately need this to end...
1338461467918602243 2020-12-14 20:30:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I couldn’t say this better.
1338460661458800643 2020-12-14 20:27:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’m really angry about the talk of London going into tier 3. Shut schools a few days early and move the whole country to tier 2. Better still, get rid of the tier system and let people use their common sense. I don’t want to live in an authoritarian state.
1338413733207531520 2020-12-14 17:21:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SelfHarmNotts @andyoval Surely the line is positive PCR tests are not cases.
1338398701316952065 2020-12-14 16:21:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> There is no need to have any part of England in tier 3 as from Friday schools are closed for a couple of weeks. That will ease infections massively.
1338238755845627906 2020-12-14 05:45:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Francis_Hoar Well said. These people are over-stepping their remit. They are public servants.
1338230616777764869 2020-12-14 05:13:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Bee42681881 I’d prefer to scrap Sage and live my life.
1338222182841929728 2020-12-14 04:40:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BallWorrall @Conservatives @_OliviaBlake Restricting us without evidence is bad enough, without adequate support is unforgivable. There is no justification for what is happening - they should be ashamed.
1338221778406174723 2020-12-14 04:38:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisHainestuns They have got it so, so wrong.
1338217579102539779 2020-12-14 04:21:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @neilparkinson74 @Conservatives @SharonHodgsonMP I feel for you. And even worse in Scotland and Wales with no alcohol and closing at 6pm. Who do these people think they are restricting us in this way without a full package of support? We deserve to be treated so much better.
1338206057366163456 2020-12-14 03:36:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> My Tory MP, Theresa Villiers, says sorry for letting my pub and 10s of thousands up and down the country slowly bleed to bankruptcy. I’m sure that makes us all feel a bit better. @Conservatives, the party sorry to destroy business.  https://t.co/nYJw32fJ5q
1338196669356183553 2020-12-14 02:58:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> My tiers based on people knowledgeable about their own risk:- Tier 1 - pubs operate normally; Tier 2 - pubs operate with distancing; Tier 3: pubs operate with distancing and masks. No forced curfew or meals or any other micro-management. @CampaignforPubs
1338140518589603841 2020-12-13 23:15:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I do think it’s time that we called out the curfew, mandatory meals and table service crap for what it is - the Government are taking the piss and destroying an industry for the sake of being seen to do something.
1338139566000189440 2020-12-13 23:11:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Of course @CampaignforPubs supports any broad initiative to save pubs especially during these difficult times. @CampaignforPubs is, however, different from all the organisations listed in that we are truly grass roots and we do not represent big company commercial interests.
1338133756079648768 2020-12-13 22:48:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CAMRA_Official @beerandpub @Britbeerwriters @BIIandBIIAB @SIBA01 @UKHofficial Eeerm, the BBPA in particular represents all the big Pubcos that have shafted landlords and landladies for a few decades.
1338094246751035392 2020-12-13 20:11:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Tier 2 infections increase whilst Tier 1 decreases. A bit of a mystery as the pubs are open to multi-household groups in tier 1...  https://t.co/kB1nduMNwK

1337789730294026240 2020-12-13 00:01:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @one_jason @CampaignforPubs And listen to the increasingly exasperated public...this level of Government interference in our lives will not be tolerated indefinitely...
1337788348484743168 2020-12-12 23:56:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I should be on Talk Radio at about 5.30pm tonight...
1337788071643910144 2020-12-12 23:55:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @one_jason @CampaignforPubs I very much see the vaccine, albeit developed quickly, as an option for those people who want it - and that can only help with the overall perspective.
1337772704766812161 2020-12-12 22:54:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CraigJones1966 Time will tell on the science, but there is a valid debate to the degree to which this pandemic is elongated and the accuracy of PCR tests which determine “cases”, “hospitalisations” and “deaths with Covid”. @ProfKarolSikora is highly acclaimed and doesn’t deserve to be debunked.
1337764889553670144 2020-12-12 22:22:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CampaignforPubs @WSJ @SaabiraC @AlokSharma_RDG We are being laughed at across the globe!!
1337764741306064899 2020-12-12 22:22:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This video reflects the usefulness of masks for going to the toilet in pubs. We are being ridiculous in so many ways. Everything needs reviewed especially now that the vaccine is being rolled out. #restorecommonsense @CampaignforPubs
1337733461419970562 2020-12-12 20:18:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We’ve got a mention in this article on the “substantial meal” in the Wall Street Journal. The handling of Covid by our politicians reaches a new height of international mockery...   https://t.co/nbGWlJJ7p0
1337493260349153280 2020-12-12 04:23:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JeffSmithetc @wearethentia It needs immediate action to save many pubs. Been closed 5 months this year, when open we have horrendously difficult restrictions, it’s just not sustainable, individual owners are paying a terrible price.

1337372864702525442 2020-12-11 20:25:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell I do want them and Greene King provided them free for 11 years. They decided they didn’t need to provide them for free through the lease, but somehow they had a right to charge me if I ordered them direct from breweries.
1337370231203893248 2020-12-11 20:14:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell Yes, this was a long outstanding dispute that was adjourned due to Covid. I’ve given Greene King lots of credit of late for what they have done on the rent.
1337318858596691969 2020-12-11 16:50:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Adnamscastleinn @ArmstrongKimbo I look forward to that!!
1337309161688850432 2020-12-11 16:12:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @edinburgharms Thank you. I’m doing ok when I’m open, the problem has been trying to open every day with a much reduced trade and a need to have someone in the kitchen all the time. Not profitable, but I raise some cash to pay bills that otherwise I wouldn’t.
1337143317595906049 2020-12-11 05:13:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This made me laugh...  https://t.co/LGD0tlkkR5

1337135370304184323 2020-12-11 04:41:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman I wouldn’t give them any ground - we can organise social distancing and make sure folk don’t get too drunk as we always do.

1337117615081336839 2020-12-11 03:30:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We’ve inputted to this article about how pointless and wasteful the “must eat” rule is...

1336971580463853568 2020-12-10 17:50:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WMPolice These comments should tell you that people think you should be concentrating your efforts into serious crime. We need hearts and minds to deal with Covid, not authoritarianism.
1336957254311026688 2020-12-10 16:53:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lesherring3 @ShelaghFogarty How do you know?
1336953839111598081 2020-12-10 16:40:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fairpint I know. Tbh, I didn’t think that the importance of branded glasses would be disputed in this way. As for lying, let’s see what the transcript says. Certainly a woeful understatement of the importance that brand owners put on branded glasses.
1336947523886313472 2020-12-10 16:15:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fairpint I’m going to get the transcript so there will be a written record of the position.
1336947090157658114 2020-12-10 16:13:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fairpint Not according to BDM Tim Sparrow. He speaks the whole truth as he was in Court. His experience of GK managed pubs is also that the use is patchy. It’s not important that branded glasses are used.

Cake and eat it.
1336945497337188352 2020-12-10 16:07:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fairpint Yesterday, GK presented a picture of the use and the free availability of branded glasses being patchy. They are not essential and not proactively promoted by the industry.

1336752460094992385 2020-12-10 03:19:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CHistorians It was great meeting you Ruth, thanks so much for this write up!! See you@again soon.
1336730621289357313 2020-12-10 01:53:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman @davegoodwin4 The original grant for here was just short of £2k a week - it’s now £2k a month. Things are a lot worse, not better.
1336730240966668290 2020-12-10 01:51:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LizHind3 @stephenkb I agree. I also think that the Govt communication strategy has been woeful, some of the rules are ridiculous and people are absolutely fed up to the back teeth of authoritarianism. The Govt has lost hearts and minds.
1336728748138389504 2020-12-10 01:45:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @davegoodwin4 @OliAshman Nightmare. They are talking about London going into tier 3 again. This cannot keep happening. As well as the money, it drives me mad.
1336727249752625157 2020-12-10 01:39:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman @davegoodwin4 Cheers Oli, I’ve got a few local contacts. Imagine trying to put a charge on something that someone else sends me for free...
1336726155144155140 2020-12-10 01:35:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CCTV_etc In fairness, this was an old dispute that was adjourned because of Covid. Such a stupid move by Greene King to try to charge for something like that. They have been very decent of late on the rent.
1336718959723339782 2020-12-10 01:06:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @davegoodwin4 I’m hoping the brewers will give me them - Greene King were proposing that, whilst not covered by the lease, they could put a charge on top for glasses I order from the brewers. Just silly.
1336714727876124673 2020-12-10 00:50:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GeneralBurk I should have got statements from people like you. Not sure it would have been enough to get an implied term, but would have at least countered some of the crap they peddled.
1336693309868281859 2020-12-09 23:24:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @angelwestbury Good way to put it!! I’m happy it wasn’t wasted effort. It is important that we don’t let them invent new charges which they are very good at doing.
1336692157772689408 2020-12-09 23:20:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @angelwestbury I didn’t win the issue of glasses being an implied term in the lease, I really ought to have gathered more evidence. But the Judge made clear that Greene King cannot charge me for branded glasses unless I agree to the charge. So claim lost, but I won on the erroneous charge.
1336667808604827651 2020-12-09 21:43:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JVerruca @GuidoFawkes Crikey, who would have thought it...
1336657798525018115 2020-12-09 21:03:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mark_BeerArt Cheers. Kicking myself a bit as I could have done a lot more evidence gathering for the money claim. But at least it is clear that they cannot intervene with a charge without consent. They had a solicitor and barrister handling it, a bit of overkill to say the least.
1336655264204943361 2020-12-09 20:53:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Greene King also proposed that I should pay costs due to it being an “unreasonable” claim - Judge rejected outright saying I had been receiving free glasses for 12 years and had good arguments to contest the change.
1336650838278893570 2020-12-09 20:36:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Just been to the Small Claims Court about Greene King’s new charges for branded glasses. I cannot be compelled to pay their new charges, but it is not an implied term in the lease to provide branded glasses. GK BDM told the Court using branded glasses was not pushed by breweries!
1336648819581325312 2020-12-09 20:28:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CHistorians Ask for me at the bar and I’ll come and say hello.

1336245884087119872 2020-12-08 17:46:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WillH3653 @EssexPR Yes.
1336244818121551873 2020-12-08 17:42:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HousesSilver I have been dubious about the danger of the virus since the outset as the WHO figures did not stack up. Cannot really question the first 3 weeks of the first lockdown for Sage/Govt to take stock, but beyond that it seems like complete risk aversion and mishandling.
1336214596428984320 2020-12-08 15:42:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I hope that the vaccine is what is needed to return proportionality, evidence-based and common sense decision making, personal responsibility, freedom and choice to our nation.
1336194373772582913 2020-12-08 14:22:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Next Monday I need to make my main orders for Christmas, but next Wednesday the Government could decide to shut us down by a move to tier 3. This is the impossible position many pubs and other businesses are in.  @CampaignforPubs

1335874274452762624 2020-12-07 17:10:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheRingOfBells1 Thank you. It’s not easy navigating this. I am taking someone on, but come the 19th we could be closed again if London is moved to Tier 3. It’s incredibly difficult to run our businesses in this way.
1335872193033596928 2020-12-07 17:02:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 Cheers, thank you for your support. It’s interesting what you say about the food because a lot of other people have also said that they like it. I don’t rule it out being an ongoing option, but I’d need to charge more.
1335870261141401600 2020-12-07 16:54:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We are having to close for a couple of days because the Government’s enforced closures and restrictions have depleted our staff resource to the point that I cannot give staff rest days if I open every day. We’re back open on Wednesday 9 December at 12 noon.  https://t.co/ZyV4qCXaRC

1335400024033947649 2020-12-06 09:45:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBradley_Mans @scullyp This is all a bit hypocritical in year that @Conservatives have closed and restricted hundreds of thousands of small businesses beyond viability and without adequate support. You cannot pretend anymore.
1335303680111890433 2020-12-06 03:23:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scullyp @SelaineSaxby The Government has closed non-essential retail and hospitality for 5 months in 2020 - and heavily restricted us since March with months to go. My business it’s on its knees having lost 50% of turnover. Support is wholly inadequate. This is, therefore, somewhat  galling.

1335232412352196608 2020-12-05 22:39:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The ridiculousness of the meal requirement and the insult of the Government’s £1,000 grant for wet led pubs are covered in this clip which I appear in. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/diOCif1TbQ
1335052609007349760 2020-12-05 10:45:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is a very emotional video made by a US hospitality owner. Her anguish is what we feel in the UK. Not able to trade whilst others around us, including big corporates, are allowed to do comparable activities. We feel crushed without reason and powerless. @CampaignforPubs

1334539116998963200 2020-12-04 00:44:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The evidence is not there to support what the Government is doing to hospitality.

1334492955265077254 2020-12-03 21:41:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CampaignforPubs @scullyp It’s not common sense, it’s a load of twaddle. Govt has zero credibility with these increasingly onerous rules. Can be in the same pub drinking soft drinks and no need for food. Can go to a much bigger ticketed event and no need for food. @Conservatives won’t be forgiven
1334483705709125633 2020-12-03 21:04:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AlistairHaimes Begs the question who is running the country. These blinkered so called health professionals or the people we have elected. We need a PM who is in charge.

1334439191158157314 2020-12-03 18:07:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChefTomKerridge @bbcquestiontime Tom, please emphasise the ridiculousness of the Tier 2 meal requirement. The Regs already required all customers to sit at tables, spacing, etc. It’s such a burden for customers and pubs to provide a meal for people who want a quiet couple of pints.
1334433333279907840 2020-12-03 17:44:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @cricketerskent @BorisJohnson @Conservatives I’ve got quite a few tips for the Govt, they all end with “off”...
1334422264549400578 2020-12-03 17:00:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @eaglealehouse Dave, its a wise decision. The meal requirement alongside table service is very difficult. Anyone would think that the rules are being made up by people who have no clue how wet led pubs operate. If only they’d engage and ask. @CampaignforPubs
1334421609344536579 2020-12-03 16:57:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NigelSommelier @doughtagnan @BorisJohnson @Conservatives Cask sales have broadly gone down in line with the proportion of the lost trade overall, maybe slightly more. I had 4 beers on: Landlord, Side Pocket, Cwtch and Rudgate Hop Through the Heart. All we’re selling.

The ridiculousness of the rules and trying to explain them to people. Come on 10 Downing Street you are becoming a comical parody with this micro management of our lives and businesses - time to step back!
1334403658184843264 2020-12-03 15:46:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UK_UNIFICATION Me too, subject to individual decision.

It’s micro-management beyond belief that Ministers are even discussing what people may eat in a pub. We had the sit down only rule from July and that’s easy to police. The public are very angry about this.

1334267421138563072 2020-12-03 06:45:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> First day in new tier 2 nearly over. Very busy, much harder work for the staff and I. Served 155 x £3 meals. 99% of customers think that the meal requirement and most of the other rules are bonkers. People want normal. @BorisJohnson @Conservatives you are a laughing stock.

1333942704166875139 2020-12-02 09:14:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Govt’s position that scotch eggs are a meal should hopefully enable more wet pubs to open, but it begs the question as to whether there is any point to the  meal rule at all. Govt needs to move away from micro-management of our lives and businesses. @CampaignforPubs

My staff and I are exasperated with the continuous and illogical changes. This is the case across the country. We’re not all in it together.

1333705639101657089 2020-12-01 17:32:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SMcPartland Well done. We need a rethink.
1333685071145000965 2020-12-01 16:11:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AleSettle @JulianSmithUK @Conservatives are now the party of business destruction. They will never be forgiven for their ineptitude and blatant disregard for so many businesses.
1333682598619582465 2020-12-01 16:01:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PubsAdvisory If they wanted to specify a time limit or must leave after food is eaten then they could have. They haven’t. It seems that a table meal just has to form part of the visit.
1333681998729244672 2020-12-01 15:59:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @edinburgharms  https://t.co/Pff2NmZDou
1333681861256761344 2020-12-01 15:58:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @YummyTim Looking at the wording as a whole there is no suggestion of time limits or drinks limited only to the period of eating. It simply says wet led pubs cannot sell alcohol unless to customers in for a table meal like in a restaurant.
1333680913713074176 2020-12-01 15:54:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Looking at the wording as a whole there is no suggestion of time limits or drinks limited only to the period of eating. It simply says wet led pubs cannot sell alcohol in isolation - the customer has got to have a table meal like in a restaurant.
1333680076563640320 2020-12-01 15:51:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AlokSharma_RDG Eeerm, you’re killing all hospitality and retail. Yes, you. @Conservatives will never be forgiven . Get rid of the Buffoons and return to rationality.
1333675652965396480 2020-12-01 15:33:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer Yes, I hope enough of them survive!
1333674798631821313 2020-12-01 15:30:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer We are definitely agreed on that!!
1333674680063045632 2020-12-01 15:29:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer I’d need to see the evidence for your first statement. The point is that there is a lot  between lockdown and let rip and the only way to look at that is by analysis of the destruction on both sides. None of us know because that is not being done.
1333666257774768128 2020-12-01 14:56:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer In the absence of the Government producing any meaningful analysis of the impacts of lockdowns or meaningful analysis on the impact of Covid I don’t know how anyone can be certain as to which is causing “greater devastation”.
1333659548817747969 2020-12-01 14:29:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer Does anyone ever use the “let it rip” phrase other than ardent lockdowners who completely ignore the adverse health and other impacts of lockdowns?
1333636962872389633 2020-12-01 13:00:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan @GettyImages It is an incredible story and there are many good people out there. It’s just a shame that people like you use that for your purposes.
1333631163597008899 2020-12-01 12:37:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Campaign for Pubs highlighted a few weeks ago that the new Covid restrictions are a valid trigger for a Market Rent Only (MRO) rent review - I have applied to Greene King. There is a limited timeframe to act - @PubsAdvisory can help you with the process.  https://t.co/DOMnoVvV61
1333588264511483905 2020-12-01 09:46:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyMPowell A consequence of the Coronavirus Act and the forced closure and restriction of businesses. Lots more to come. Parliament is responsible.
1333578830053838850 2020-12-01 09:09:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SiobhanEdwards1 I have to say that I feel similar, it needs to end.
1333560299945922560 2020-12-01 07:55:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BXcoalition @flxby93 @BrokenBarnet You interjected on my tweet. I just want to live my life and run my business. My patience has run out for nonsense on either extreme side of the argument - whether that’s fear driven Spanish flu comparisons or 5G conspiracies. I can now only deal with the rational.
1333556350064930817 2020-12-01 07:39:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @flxby93 @BrokenBarnet @BXcoalition I cannot see broken Barnet’s tweets as she blocked me in a fit of temper. Ironic that she still sees fit to intervene on my tweet. For that reason I will now block her.
1333555834891235331 2020-12-01 07:37:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BareReality In fairness to Labour, why should they take responsibility either way. This decision will now be owned 100% by @Conservatives and rightly so because they are our Govt. All our anger should go to them.
1333548626065432579 2020-12-01 07:09:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Cruxy57 Exactly what I’m doing!
1333547274148962309 2020-12-01 07:03:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Cruxy57 They say lots of things that contradict. My intention is to stick tmm on what is written in the law.
1333543033938337792 2020-12-01 06:46:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 With Labour abstaining, this is 100% on @Conservatives .
1333541506234413064 2020-12-01 06:40:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UK_4_Democracy @Conservatives @SirGrahamBrady @SteveBakerHW Where is this going and why?
1333538973147406339 2020-12-01 06:30:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The legislation says drinks “as part of” a meal. The meal is not “finished” if you haven’t eaten some of it that you intend to eat or you have not decided on whether to have dessert or coffee. In these circumstances any drinks would be “part of” as you haven’t “finished”.
1333531551712366592 2020-12-01 06:01:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GwespyrPH @CampaignforPubs That’s now been debunked by No 10....clarification is awaited on pickled eggs...
1333529367427899395 2020-12-01 05:52:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKLabour abstaining is not necessarily a bad thing. It means the responsibility for this whole mess is 100% with @Conservatives and they are going to feel 100% of the anger.  https://t.co/thR3Q6JJlx
1333514581029904385 2020-12-01 04:53:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @maltingsyork Yes, more inconsistent madness.
1333510255104372736 2020-12-01 04:36:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BXcoalition @flxby93 @BrokenBarnet Of course scale is part of the argument. You don’t remove liberties and wreck a country for a tummy bug for example. Please just go away because I have no time for irrational people like you who have not a thought about those dying from restriction. You need to get perspective.
1333508306925735937 2020-12-01 04:28:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BXcoalition @flxby93 @BrokenBarnet This is absolutely nothing like the 1919 pandemic. Get a bloody grip.  https://t.co/YUzaeYfEp7
1333505181615583235 2020-12-01 04:16:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CHistorians Just up the road from High Barnet tube, let me know when you are coming.
1333504284730789892 2020-12-01 04:12:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @flxby93 Cheers Felix, what has happened to our Government? They must be stopped.
1333501892962508801 2020-12-01 04:03:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CHistorians Be great to meet you!!

1333495924035907588 2020-12-01 03:39:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Ye Olde Mitre Inne Restaurant, High Barnet, opens at 12 noon on Wednesday 2 December. Welcome to Orwell’s England where the Government controls every part of your life including your social life. #thishastostop  https://t.co/8IF8ZS6OSy
1333483610276569091 2020-12-01 02:50:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan The Government has lost hearts and minds now. It’s all too ridiculous.
1333475046174695424 2020-12-01 02:16:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LizHind3 @DogmaDave Lol...I also feel uncomfortable about them introducing a political slogan, Build Back Better, into a health crisis. It’s all very perplexing. Hancock appears to me to be completely mad - I would be worried serving him a drink in my pub!
1333473838118604809 2020-12-01 02:11:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LizHind3 @DogmaDave I’m not anti-vaccine, but apprehensive as I don’t think the Govt has answered all the scientific questions around the virus and it all feels rather odd.
1333463118920474627 2020-12-01 01:29:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is disturbing - the new Vaccines Minister suggesting that pubs and other venues will require vaccination proof for entry. Not unless you mandate that whether directly or by coercion.
1333461344939626496 2020-12-01 01:22:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @libdemdaisy @CAMRA_Official @GBPubConfed @CampaignforPubs Now withdrawn by No10. We need you to vote against the tiers.
1333460939342012420 2020-12-01 01:20:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I find it incredibly uncomfortable that he uses the political slogan ‘Build Back Better’ in what is supposed to be a Health briefing. We must stop these rogue politicians because that is what they are.  https://t.co/oHZHX3lzPg
1333404685529718785 2020-11-30 21:37:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jocoxbrown Plus Scotch Eggs...
1333397026369921025 2020-11-30 21:06:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @totalcurtis We all are. It’s ridiculousness beyond belief.
1333396591399538689 2020-11-30 21:04:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @totalcurtis I don’t have anyone on a zero hours contract.
1333395966444138502 2020-11-30 21:02:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @totalcurtis The workers get 80%. The business owners have to pay some of that 80% and don’t get enough to do so and pay the other bills. It is now “especially” the businesses because the workers won’t get 80% when the businesses go under. I’ve not had an income since March.
1333393492861710337 2020-11-30 20:52:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HaynesGreyhound @MarkDrakeford They’re all nuts. Have they no wider perception? I just don’t get why they are so obsessed from protecting us from one risk, but oblivious to the chaos they are causing.
1333390790605860866 2020-11-30 20:41:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> They are not pubs if they don’t sell alcohol and they have to close at 6pm. Time to tell them all to feck orf!!   https://t.co/2BAtGj9nXd
1333390306025365504 2020-11-30 20:39:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @nikond300boy Feck knows. Don’t even have the rules in written form. It’s ridiculousness beyond belief.
1333382935018430467 2020-11-30 20:10:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @clynn561 There’s a gulf in perspective between us that’s not going to be resolved on Twitter. In 12 months time you will wonder why you were so fearful.
1333379439644844032 2020-11-30 19:56:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @clynn561 Yes, there has been tragedy; but lockdowns cause great tragedy too. Balance is the only way forward. We must look at the danger as it is now, not what it was.
1333375190764498948 2020-11-30 19:39:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @clynn561 You have a choice. Don’t go out. I don’t mind wearing a mask and keeping far away from you at a supermarket or on public transport. But don’t impose on my choices thank you very much.
1333371987150835712 2020-11-30 19:27:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Labour finally becomes an opposition with this Labour MP saying he will not vote for the tier system - instead, he wants lockdown to continue, god save us from all of these clowns...
1333351312159875072 2020-11-30 18:04:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Govt now says a Scotch egg is a “substantial meal”. What is the point to the restriction if that is the case? Why do we not know what we are supposed to be doing when we open in less than 48 hours? The Govt needs to feck off now with the whole bloody lot of it.
1333348497358266368 2020-11-30 17:53:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AndyBurnhamGM There’s no logic anywhere. Politicians have lost the consent of the people.
1333340518487560194 2020-11-30 17:22:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @geoffbanksbet Blinkered beyond belief.
1333339027408379906 2020-11-30 17:16:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher I felt that that was a limiting factor in the Civil Service.
1333338611584995328 2020-11-30 17:14:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mrjamesob It must be great to have a mind where  all the “experts” that you believe in are right on everything they say.
1333337493400391680 2020-11-30 17:10:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @edballs I think the problem is that the ever creeping control, without opposition from Labour, has lost hearts and minds.
1333336572696145921 2020-11-30 17:06:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Getting ready to open in the new tier 2. I think the difference between the restrictions now and those back in July is that they are just not reasonable and flexible enough - the Government has lost hearts and minds as a result. It all feels pretty pointless. @CampaignforPubs
1333307505158582279 2020-11-30 15:10:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Telegraph @SteveBakerHW All of these things too little too late.
1333217797011361794 2020-11-30 09:14:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Topov1981 @doctor_oxford Every Dr and scientist cannot be right or there would be no scientific debate or evolution ; every lawyer cannot be right or there would be no need for Courts. I don’t claim to be an expert, but I’ve read opinions on both sides.
1333171632639275018 2020-11-30 06:11:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @leftywoke @doctor_oxford I do not defend the Govt who appear to be listening to a very narrow medical opinion, like the Drs, that is not representative of the whole situation. Correct diagnosis and proper appraisal of side affects to treatments are critical to holistic care.
1333169970214281217 2020-11-30 06:04:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @leftywoke @doctor_oxford It’s not “your” Govt? I don’t defend the Govt, but I do defend the need to take a broader view of what’s happening - and you and thus Dr fail to do that.
1333167395335245834 2020-11-30 05:54:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @docbrown80 @doctor_oxford Please what?
1333156573133369344 2020-11-30 05:11:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LemonsTom @greeneking I think it will definitely help them try to avoid a significant crash in rental values. Pub companies have not been as forthcoming with reductions for free of tie tenants which I think is short sighted in this regard.
1333155579368452099 2020-11-30 05:07:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mark_BeerArt @CampaignforPubs Yes, they should be full compensated. And I agree people are sick of the nonsense now.
1333150971728437256 2020-11-30 04:48:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Nightclubs hung out to dry and it’s all but over for them; the rest of hospitality, retail, beauty, is following fast. This should be completely unacceptable. We are restricted for the public good so we should be compensated by the public purse. @CampaignforPubs
1333146477804269569 2020-11-30 04:31:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @StevenJGPerez @Sacha_Lord @AndyBurnhamGM @Keir_Starmer @AngelaRayner Return hospitality to the level of restriction when we re-open in July - sensible spaced out drinking and woth flexibility reflecting our unique businesses . End the curfew, table service, food and the no mixing indoors.
1333139080612286469 2020-11-30 04:01:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan You are telling me this as a publican who has had no income since March and no prospect of an income until Easter.
1333046684272758785 2020-11-29 21:54:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normian100 @Fox_Claire @greeneking @CampaignforPubs Some have at certain times, but it has by no means been uniform. There’s also a historic and ongoing problem with rent levels and tied beer charges. Credit where it’s due only.
1333041894268538882 2020-11-29 21:35:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Admiral_Taverns and @greeneking leading the way on rents for their tenants during this crisis. @CampaignforPubs
1333040123425005568 2020-11-29 21:28:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @charliegilkes True. I’m anything but quiet. My view is that we need now to physically get out there and protest en masse.
1333039474343874568 2020-11-29 21:25:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @C4Ciaran The country is being trashed by these fools leading us.
1333033949686325250 2020-11-29 21:03:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PubSandy @LetherSimon @greeneking @CampaignforPubs I’ve written to my MP, Theresa Villiers, Conservative, several times and so have many of my customers. Originally helpful, but now abandoned us. @Conservatives will pay the price heavily.
1333033337359839234 2020-11-29 21:01:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CottageOlde @greeneking @CampaignforPubs @greeneking - are you offering your free of tie tenants the same?
1333032955783106564 2020-11-29 20:59:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PubSandy @LetherSimon @greeneking @CampaignforPubs I agree too. What they are offering now is better than other pub companies.
1333012284910743552 2020-11-29 19:37:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tombowran @CampaignforPubs @EssexPR I hadn’t read the detail as I thought it would be waffle....that is pretty incendiary....@ThePubChampion we need to use that.
1333011051068186624 2020-11-29 19:32:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jon_statistics Bang pots and pans outside our front doors.
1333009650346827776 2020-11-29 19:27:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate Cool, I’m not trolling you by the way, your posts are continually on my feed and I do agree with everything normally!!
1332995797777080320 2020-11-29 18:32:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR @greeneking It’s a lot to find with increased staffing, reduced trade and all the other bills. I still don’t even have a chance of earning anything with zero rent. Had nothing since March!
1332994983079579649 2020-11-29 18:29:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR @greeneking Cheers, they have stepped up to plate, a huge worry that every pub tenants needs taking off their mind.
1332994009690742787 2020-11-29 18:25:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate I don’t think this is the route that we should be encouraging.
1332993754626666503 2020-11-29 18:24:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @charliegilkes I hate to say it but I’d be very surprised if any substantive change is made either to the policy or the support.
1332993276450910208 2020-11-29 18:22:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alan_evans1 @OliverDowden @TheSun He doesn’t care Alan, the Tories are killing every small business and working person’s pleasure. They’ll all get a backlash like no other sooner or later.
1332991905341333504 2020-11-29 18:16:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher @ManiPillai1886 So near to the truth...
1332929622925840387 2020-11-29 14:09:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I have to hand out huge praise and thanks again to @greeneking - they have confirmed that they will waive rent for all their Tier 2 and 3 tenants. They really are responding to and supporting their tenants exceptionally well. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/QeyLLuax3p
1332923090536460289 2020-11-29 13:43:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is an excellent summary of the complete inadequacy of the Sage evidence on the spread of Covid through hospitality. Surely, any analysis needs to look at the position in the UK and compare regulated environments with unregulated environments. @CampaignforPubs
1332902435845758976 2020-11-29 12:21:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GabrielScally And you talk about Covid and NHS as if they function separately from everything else. Time to join up all the thinking.
1332823214360236038 2020-11-29 07:06:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate Sorry Kate, it’s not even a “hint” of good news as it still means at least 2 months of hell. It all need to be changed. Hospitality must be allowed to open or FULLY compensated. There’s too much “compromise” and the compromise has shafted us hitherto.

1332733280282664961 2020-11-29 01:09:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The hospitality sector and all its supporters must now join these protests. The oppression of protest, debate, lives and businesses cannot continue in a democracy. It’s much more than Covid now.

1332714413980258306 2020-11-28 23:54:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer Vote against it then, do some real opposition.
1332646245320564738 2020-11-28 19:23:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jocoxbrown I’d like to see that defined in law - when is the meal finished? After the last chip, when you eventually decide not to have dessert?
1332641718227918849 2020-11-28 19:05:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @johnnymacDCFC @alanhowat72 Prep time, storage, hot holding all an issue. It really isn’t easy to do this in a mainly wet pub.
1332639931290759172 2020-11-28 18:58:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @johnnymacDCFC @alanhowat72 It’s easy doing microwave stuff from fresh or frozen for one at home - but it’s not so easy when it’s scaled up.
1332637830863065088 2020-11-28 18:49:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alanhowat72 Thank you, I’ve had lots of support from the community who desperately want the normality of the pub back in their lives.
1332636309979090950 2020-11-28 18:43:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alanhowat72 At the moment the fried food seems the easiest way to do it on the scale I need to do it. Storage, fresh or frozen, and cooking capacity is an issue with anything we do. We have a tiny kitchen and limited ambient storage.
1332607460876693504 2020-11-28 16:49:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher I’m doing Witless Whitty Apple Crumble so customers can have a drink whilst they decide upon dessert...

Woth co-operation with Tory rebels they are in a strong position to get significant changes made, like proper compensation for business owners or silly restrictions dropped. They are failing.
1332594711664730112 2020-11-28 15:58:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @14thefrog How many restaurants chuck their customers out as soon as they have finished eating...
1332593832177889280 2020-11-28 15:55:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @elogudbyegirl You obviously don’t frequent pubs.

They are choosing not to do so and are, therefore, complicit in what is happening to the pub industry.
1332591638212980737 2020-11-28 15:46:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Corinne78 Well said. They can’t have it both ways, we need to be allowed to operate safely or fully compensated.
1332579681078562818 2020-11-28 14:58:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> A little bit of coverage in the Mail..  https://t.co/kJdsLJB5sV
1332576217673953280 2020-11-28 14:45:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheHovinghamInn @CampaignforPubs I was a civil servant in Whitehall for many years and there are staggering levels of risk aversion, incompetence and disconnect with the public. The handling of Covid, even by those standards, seems extraordinary; but not beyond comprehension.
1332573163054649344 2020-11-28 14:32:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ThePubsOfKerry @CatrionaColllns @MichealMartinTD @fiannafailparty @VFIpubs They have absolutely no idea of either the financial or mental pain this has undoubtedly caused pub owners. It’s bad enough in England, but even I cannot imagine how bad it would be to have been closed for 9 months in Ireland. Best wishes for getting through it.

1332461924542541825 2020-11-28 07:10:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OwenJones84 “With Covid” = tested positive in the preceding 28 days using a test of questionable accuracy. Detail matters. Accurate and proper diagnosis and death recording matters. These are the questions the left should be asking to protect the vulnerable from Covid extremism. You fail.

1332337654566965248 2020-11-27 22:57:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> How ridiculous is this? Is it going to be written into the law? If not, it’s not enforceable. If so, just keep a chip on your plate. Why is Covid different in relation to alcohol? Do these people really know what pub are like?  This Govt really are twats.   https://t.co/peD8hkZma9
1332138424841670656 2020-11-27 09:45:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Please sign and retweet this petition for more financial support for hospitality. By way of example, my pub received £1,400 per week in grant during the first lockdown - I’m getting £2,000 for the whole month of this lockdown. It’s 8 months of restriction and no earnings.
1332130695968382976 2020-11-27 09:14:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @simonjamesjupp @UKHofficial Thank you. As an illustration, the support for my pub has reduced from £1,400 a week in March/April/June to just £2,000 a month. The expenses are the same and we are in a worse financial position having been restricted for 8 months now. It really is desperate.
1332128541157314565 2020-11-27 09:06:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MildAndStout @UKHospKate It’s absolutely ridiculous and characteristic of the totalitarian way this Govt is behaving. They do not trust their citizens or enforcement, and they have no ability to lead rather than rule their. Utter failure. The British public won’t put up with this nonsense until Easter.  https://t.co/2VILUpS3FB
1332123360248127488 2020-11-27 08:45:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MildAndStout @UKHospKate No, we are to operate like a restaurant. No restaurant I’ve ever been to limits my alcohol and chucks me out when I’ve finished eating. Here’s a useful legal link.  https://t.co/p1bAMJwWZ2
1332083492352569346 2020-11-27 06:07:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @slimwhiteduck @petersgate_tap All in it together unless you are one of the business owners affected - I’m south of Watford and I’ve had no income since March. This is the case across the whole country.
1332083055272529921 2020-11-27 06:05:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Chrisaparkin @TimothyTaylors It can be served alongside your meal. Covid, I’m afraid, does not like it when we drink it on its own.

1332066228572217350 2020-11-27 04:58:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Yes, it’s time to restore liberty and personal responsibility to a much more significant degree. Hospitality is a choice, let people make it. Nanny state needs to go.
1332063905535975425 2020-11-27 04:49:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher Exactly the approach I’m taking. Good luck, we’ll have a pint after this is over!!

1331990795780579328 2020-11-26 23:58:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The success of the two week circuit breaker which became a 4 week closure of hospitality and hairdressers is hardly encapsulated by increasing restrictions on virtually the whole country. Follow the science, I’d rather not...
1331981900664201216 2020-11-26 23:23:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @charlotte2153 @CAMRA_Official @CampaignforPubs @GBPubConfed @ProtectPubs @beerandpub I suspect that they will probably either ignore or give you some old flannel. Labour really needs to put conditions upon their agreement to the tier system as there are quite a lot of Tory rebels.
1331980090033532936 2020-11-26 23:16:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jillod4 Can’t watch or listen to him.
1331964001023045633 2020-11-26 22:12:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DamianGreen You should be asking for clarity on the PCR tests and deaths data. It is the PCR that determines Covid hospital admissions and Covid attributed deaths. If the PCR test has a large error rate, as many scientists propose, then that carries through to deaths.
1331945453273968642 2020-11-26 20:58:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheShiredale 2.

1331926448093995008 2020-11-26 19:43:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Keeping the country closed and bankrupting businesses in case the NHS gets busy is such a ridiculous concept of failure by the Government. @Conservatives you are useless.
1331923065282949120 2020-11-26 19:29:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tobyperkinsmp It’s all disastrous. The need for any of it is driven by the PCR tests which also give us the hospitalisation and death figures. The Govt refuse fully to explain the accuracy of PCR - or unravel the death figures, the average age of which at 82. Labour should be questioning this.
1331883132619005952 2020-11-26 16:50:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @andrewbusby @AngelaHartnett @Peston @UKHospKate I’ve not earned since March. Best I can possibly do in tier 1 would be to run at break even. Tier 2 and 3 a certain loss, it’s a matter of how many £10s of thousands of loss that builds up to between now and Easter and whether it ends then.
1331881889762856961 2020-11-26 16:46:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer Of course that’s a given; but what are you going to do about it? You have the option to make your support for the tier system conditional upon proper support for Publicans. It should simply not be an option to let us individually go bankrupt. That’s what is happening.
1331880570662629377 2020-11-26 16:40:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @twosawyersCT1 Yes, I’d be content to close if that is considered appropriate for the public good, BUT it must come with the right level of support, like 20% of takings as is being paid to hospitality business owners in France.
1331878294971686912 2020-11-26 16:31:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BareReality @ONS @UKStatsAuth I think that their collective lack of analytical ability has been exposed for all to see during 2020. All but a few Tories actually get the bigger picture.
1331877437223936000 2020-11-26 16:28:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @leoniedelt Add to that that the main diagnostic tool for the 50k is by a PCR test that picks up both dead and live fragments of virus that may or may not be the cause of death. The PCR issue affects everything and has not been given the attention it needs.
1331876548870352897 2020-11-26 16:24:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The problem with 3 tiers is that it’s easy for Civil Servants and Ministers, who are not affected financially, to stick areas into medium - that’s the “safe” option for them. If there was a tier zero, normal, the game would be different.
1331795133248000002 2020-11-26 11:01:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NeilDotObrien 696 people of the 1500 plus who died yesterday were tested within the last 28 days by a test that picks up dead or live viral fragments. You have to get your head around that if the test is inaccurate so are the reported hospital admissions and deaths. You then have an enigma.
1331766955695542272 2020-11-26 09:09:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate They are not listening - it’s sink or swim for each of us individually unless big pub companies or @UKLabour step in.
1331766557928808448 2020-11-26 09:07:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Absolutely spot on - @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer is not acting like an opposition. We are in dangerous territory as there are now a hell of a lot of disenfranchised people who can see the lunacy of what is happening. Democracy is lost without choice.
1331737190850834435 2020-11-26 07:11:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnnelieseDodds And your response? Are you going to join up with Tory rebels to oppose these restrictions that come with inadequate support for hospitality? We need @UKLabour to take action, not just moan.
1331721846627176450 2020-11-26 06:10:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @UKLabour When this is over we’ll have a pint!!
1331719351616024576 2020-11-26 06:00:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @UKLabour I rule nothing in or out. I deal with facts. I’ve seen huge mistakes and cover up when I worked in Govt. I see there are global moves to align policies and “reset” whatever that means. Everyone has an agenda even some scientists who speak out. I don’t know what’s going on.
1331717107063656450 2020-11-26 05:51:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @UKLabour It’s going to be a very long road to recovery. The political position is so entrenched in justifying what they have done hitherto. The landscape on Covid is so different and they don’t want the public to see the wood from the trees.
1331711871024586756 2020-11-26 05:30:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @UKLabour Believe me Peter I’d have been on the streets long before now, but there is little appetite or it would have happened. Too few are suffering too greatly and the media coverage of the virus is clouding judgements and splitting opinion.
1331709944190689281 2020-11-26 05:22:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @UKLabour Every pub is in a different position so we’re not going to get agreement for everyone to close unless we know that there is full financial support. My overhead is at least £12k a month. Making the staff redundant will be costly. We’re trapped and no-one is helping.
1331707215292616706 2020-11-26 05:11:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @UKLabour Never made a loss in any month since I started 12 years ago. My preference is always to trade - I don’t want handouts. But the point I make is that any restrictions need to be supported with adequate financial recompense so we are on the same page fundamentally.
1331683514736144386 2020-11-26 03:37:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer And publicans deserve not to be bankrupted. You have the power to stop this by refusing to support the tier system unless publicans are provided with adequate financial support. It should not be acceptable to anyone that we are restricted without adequate support.
1331679176596844544 2020-11-26 03:20:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AngelaRayner You have the power to stop another injustice with them imposing restrictions on hospitality without adequate financial support to Publicans. Please join with Tory rebels and vote against the new tier system unless adequate support is provided.
1331674896754208768 2020-11-26 03:03:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @diceperson @UKLabour I would love Labour to take a more questioning approach to Covid, but we are where we are. One way or the other, pubs should not be heavily restricted without adequate financial support. I do not understand how that can be acceptable to anyone.
1331672795953164293 2020-11-26 02:55:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Pubs being heavily restricted until at least Easter without adequate financial support is going to happen unless @UKLabour joins the Tory rebels and votes against the new tier arrangements - or the big pub companies make a legal challenge.
1331663917857329154 2020-11-26 02:19:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheShiredale @Sacha_Lord Brilliant news!!

1331534980791611392 2020-11-25 17:47:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Please sign and retweet this petition to get Pubs a much higher level of support as a result of these incredibly harsh measures being introduced by the Govt. my preference would be a u-turn on the whole Covid policy, but we need proper support if that does not happen.
1331511496585719810 2020-11-25 16:14:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This politician really eloquently puts the case forward for a different approach to Covid in Ireland. The same applies to the UK. The U.K. Christmas plan is absolutely bonkers. @Conservatives @UKLabour ...you have got to change tact...
1331461263419973632 2020-11-25 12:54:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @10DowningStreet If the virus was so deadly there would be no question of an amnesty. Do us all a favour and resign now.
1331398503067738117 2020-11-25 08:45:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO If the risk from this virus was high enough to warrant the damage done to our lives since March then there would be absolutely no scope for an amnesty. It doesn’t make any sense.
1331370575332257799 2020-11-25 06:54:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Another of the bigger pub owners coming out to state how destructive Government policy is. @Conservatives and @UKLabour cannot ignore all of our voices. The proposed approach must change.
1331356817914466304 2020-11-25 05:59:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NicolaSturgeon You have been steadfast in your belief that the danger of this virus is so much greater than the destruction and death than the extreme measures that you have been putting in place to manage it. Your credibility is shot to pieces with a 5 day Christmas amnesty. Foolish.
1331352774018273287 2020-11-25 05:43:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MerlinFDC4 My pub could be Covid full every night and it will still struggle to break even. We are finished as an industry and no-one can change that but the Govt.
1331351024834125826 2020-11-25 05:36:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> These big pub owners are the only ones in the sector who have the muscle for a serious challenge or protest. We stand ready to get involved and show a sector united in protest like never before. @CampaignforPubs
1331339979621076993 2020-11-25 04:52:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IvanBrennan6 @Gere79951979 @CampaignforPubs I want a logical and proportionate response to the risk. What we have is neither. My own personal view is that It is unwarranted for Govts to impose on our lives and businesses in this way.
1331336867921481731 2020-11-25 04:40:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Welcome to the Covid world of a publican.
1331320834061971458 2020-11-25 03:36:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheShiredale They have strung us along and then thrown us to the wolves....
1331319260568842240 2020-11-25 03:30:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheShiredale I’m gutted for you and your community. We’re all struggling. The Govt is not listening.
1331317274515562499 2020-11-25 03:22:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> MPs in this country are just waking up to the horror and disproportion of what is happening in our country in the name of disease control. An old lady arrested very roughly for protesting in a small group in Westminster. The law of unintended consequences on steroids.
1331295990905794561 2020-11-25 01:57:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> As a publican who has not earned anything since March and who faces restrictions through to next March, I find it incredible that “following the science” allows a Covid amnesty over Christmas in homes where the spread of Covid is known to be significant. @CampaignforPubs
1331068108216422400 2020-11-24 10:52:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Great article that touches on everything: the hard work we’ve put into making our pubs safe, the lack of evidence to close us, the opening up of other sectors and the betrayal by our politicians. All publicans are at their wits end. @CampaignforPubs
1331067184135761922 2020-11-24 10:48:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR @MailOnline Well done Adam, spot on article.
1331005207237554176 2020-11-24 06:42:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 @whiteharty @NicolaSturgeon She’s going to have to shut the Pubs at 5.30pm instead of 6pm to get that under control...
1331004658026950659 2020-11-24 06:40:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Noodle_2016UK @sy1_iol @tomparkerbowles It was sarcasm.
1331004516251152386 2020-11-24 06:39:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @drbfinch @tomparkerbowles Yes, my comment was sarcasm.
1330982091278921732 2020-11-24 05:10:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ed_Miliband Well the expectation from hospitality is that Labour MPs joint with the Tory backbench and vote against the measures.
1330979996157042690 2020-11-24 05:02:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Growley11 @tomparkerbowles I agree. I think it’s all daft as a bag of bats.
1330944115878617088 2020-11-24 02:39:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BallWorrall @EmmaMcClarkin @Admiral_Taverns @CampaignforPubs I am personally ready for some action and I am asking others on the NEC @CampaignforPubs. We need really to agree a plan industry-wide including the BBPA and the big pub owners.
1330927058239827971 2020-11-24 01:31:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @sy1_iol @cybersnurgle @tomparkerbowles I know. The situation is exasperating.
1330925609942388737 2020-11-24 01:26:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @cybersnurgle @tomparkerbowles Why not today? Either the risk exists and requires authoritarian laws on our social interactions - or it doesn’t. A Christmas amnesty makes no sense.
1330917637942108163 2020-11-24 00:54:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LordJustin12 @mediamacaque @VolvoMan17 @EmmaMcClarkin @BorisJohnson @CMO_England Mines is really friendly and reminiscent of the old days, but then I remove belligerents. I’m not sure you would last long so please don’t take this as an invite.
1330911133507743744 2020-11-24 00:28:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @barbiographer I agree, but probably big business didn’t want to cross the Govt and they probably didn’t think we would get this far with the ridiculousness.
1330910341291773954 2020-11-24 00:25:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tomparkerbowles You are correct - but you are allowed to play Russian Roulette with granny and grandad over Christmas so that’s good!
1330868221726089218 2020-11-23 21:38:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tobyperkinsmp @gageykev I hope you will joint the Tory backbenchers in voting it down. Govt providing a grant of £2k a month, my rent is £8k a month plus I’ve got to pay employer NI/pension/holiday for furlough and all other bills. I’ve not earned anything since March. My option is to make all redundant
1330866768299110400 2020-11-23 21:32:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Madz_Grant She was awful. Didn’t want to listen to him.
1330866571154165760 2020-11-23 21:31:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It seems incredible that we have been closed down for a month on the basis of estimates by Govt Health officials that were grossly incorrect - and now we are going to be restricted to oblivion by advice from the same officials. I’m angry.  https://t.co/sTPZridYlq
1330857035324383232 2020-11-23 20:53:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EmmaMcClarkin Your members, the big corporates, are in the best position to challenge or protest about this. Are you planning anything?
1330844638152962049 2020-11-23 20:04:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I have got a mention in this article.   https://t.co/MskKaf9bBJ
1330839358555951105 2020-11-23 19:43:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Individual pub operators like you and I are paying for it.
1330834101092364295 2020-11-23 19:22:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’ve had no income since March.
1330825231355834370 2020-11-23 18:47:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oldmudgie It’s not even scrapped.
1330816667774046211 2020-11-23 18:13:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @steve_hawkes A little prick?
1330815450276630529 2020-11-23 18:08:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The industry must respond together with a legal challenge or a  physical protest - or Govt must give us a better support package.  We know there is little evidence of spread in hospitality and Govt policy to have a Christmas amnesty is not rational and possibly challengeable.
1330805484220248064 2020-11-23 17:28:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @barbiographer @normandyps @UKHospKate I did not see it, but it is very hard to make counter arguments that question the very deep rooted assumption that Covid is the overriding threat.
1330649045291982848 2020-11-23 07:07:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This has to be a call to action. We must unite, be brave and take action for a proper and balanced consideration to take place.
1330636091108552705 2020-11-23 06:15:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate All the campaign groups and big pub industry need now to engage with customers and others to stage a protest. Rational negotiation has clearly failed. @CampaignforPubs
1330632313819041792 2020-11-23 06:00:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This will be a disaster for the pub trade.
1330588444398116864 2020-11-23 03:06:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SkyNewsBreak How ridiculous that it’s ok to kill your granny and grandad for a turkey dinner!!
1330587606485258245 2020-11-23 03:03:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @rrrichy So sorry, losing a dad, mum, husband, wife is incredibly hard.
1330577978322018310 2020-11-23 02:24:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EwanRCD @doughtagnan No, it’s an opinion in mainstream science.
1330576910091493388 2020-11-23 02:20:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 It’s ridiculous that we can play Russian Roulette with granny and grandad over Christmas. It’s either safe or it’s not.
1330576627814772745 2020-11-23 02:19:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate Russian roulette with your granny and grandad over Christmas including in the pub is absolutely ridiculous - it is either safe or it is not.
1330574640801083397 2020-11-23 02:11:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EwanRCD @doughtagnan 1. There is great scientific debate about whether we are actually “in the middle”; 2. Govt is not listening to one side of my he debate so protest is legitimate; 2. mass peaceful protest can be banging pots and pans at our doorsteps which is no risk to transmission.
1330486160603361280 2020-11-22 20:19:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Would you participate in a mass peaceful protest to request a change of strategy to protect the vulnerable and restore liberty? Please retweet for a wider view.
1330481905901445121 2020-11-22 20:03:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It saddens me that the Police are being undermined by being made to enforce ridiculous and irrational rules that do not make sense.
1330337161669914626 2020-11-22 10:27:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @infosuphighway @CampaignforPubs Yes, other articles say only in tier 3.
1330335648914550790 2020-11-22 10:21:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @infosuphighway @CampaignforPubs That is ambiguous in a number of these articles in that wet pubs and betting offices will only be closed in tier 3, but we will need to wait and see.
1330327850206056450 2020-11-22 09:50:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CampaignforPubs Licence to kill granny and grandpa during 22-28 December is utter lunacy. Either the risk is real or it is not.
1330327174830813185 2020-11-22 09:48:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The plan by all 4 UK nations to sanction killing your granny and grandpa between 22 - 28 December is utter madness. Either the risk is real or it is not. If we can live with the risk over Christmas then we should be living with it permanently.   https://t.co/ol5E8yOOfv
1330198300159512583 2020-11-22 01:16:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scoutnick A/ this is the democratic process we have and better to follow it than just moan on Twitter; B/ I don’t know where that forecast is coming from, but essentially have limited restriction and allow people to make their own decisions on their personal risk.
1330195659157331971 2020-11-22 01:05:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Parliament decide next week what happens after this lockdown ends on 2 December. I have written to my MP proposing that, with PHE admitting that prior immunity existed within the population and a vaccine around corner, liberty should be restored to individuals and businesses.  https://t.co/rm9PdSMIVi
1330153523284217862 2020-11-21 22:18:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SusieQinFrance @doctor_oxford I’m not “arguing” with anyone. Drs are not always right.
1330113390669406209 2020-11-21 19:38:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford Facts do matter. “Cases” are positive tests, not a diagnosis. This error carries through to hospital admissions and deaths. There needs to be a step back.
1330109837825495043 2020-11-21 19:24:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Scientists want tier 3 minimum “after lockdown”. That is effectively a continuation of lockdown. The direction we seem to be taking is just completely life and business destroying.   https://t.co/pmPlwftnBP
1329975940689096707 2020-11-21 10:32:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pcavin2 @SteveBakerHW But they are not responding to questions being raised, like the accuracy of the PCR tests, the grossly over-estimated data used by Whitty &amp; Vallance, the focus only on Covid. Then we get random and conflicting policies. They have got to engage properly. I don’t know who to trust.
1329971161220964352 2020-11-21 10:13:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MPIainDS Your party leadership has totally and utterly lost the plot. You and your colleagues need to save us as it’s 4 years to the next election.
1329871810209456133 2020-11-21 03:38:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SteveBakerHW It is shocking. What on earth is going on?
1329867569638105092 2020-11-21 03:21:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The very idea that we can take the risk with granny on Christmas Day is completely illogical. This is not science, it’s madness.
1329732133745815557 2020-11-20 18:23:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KaanthanJ @destinyschild05 The problem is that people are going to ignore restrictions anyway. The only way the Government can stay in control is to “grant” a concession. Despite the public concern and the path of the disease I can absolutely guarantee that all 4 UK nations will agree on this matter.
1329719718262022144 2020-11-20 17:34:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SteveBakerHW Fundamental to every model predicting infections, hospital capacity and deaths.
1329715404957245441 2020-11-20 17:17:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Matt_Dean1994 It’s the main annual celebration of the majority - I think you are over thinking and making irrelevant comparisons. Believe me, Johnson will get no credit from hospitality or retail for “saving Christmas” - it’s already shot to pieces.
1329709678926966785 2020-11-20 16:54:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Sage got the data wrong for the lockdown and now Matt Hancock says that the lockdown has brought the figures down when Sage said that the lockdown wouldn’t impact on the figures yet. This is why their credibility is shot to pieces. Steve Baker, pointing this out, is a Cons MP.
1329598507540500485 2020-11-20 09:32:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PHE_uk Are you on full pay? I haven’t had an income since March because you keep closing and restricting my pub. My pub has paid £millions in tax over the last 10 years. Now I need to close because of your dodgy data and inability to enable the NHS to cope.
1329585502845079553 2020-11-20 08:41:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Why indeed....
1329579430482677761 2020-11-20 08:16:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LukeJohnsonRCP I fear that it’s never going to end whilst Govt rely upon Sage - both are looking to prove they were right, but we all know they were wrong.
1329558035904274436 2020-11-20 06:51:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Another resounding vote. So Sage and No.10 binned, pubs opened.
1329556792662237188 2020-11-20 06:46:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon Everyone should pay a fair share including you. If you want lockdown it costs 50% of your income. It’s cost me 100% of mine since March and I’m sick to death of you and others restricting my life at my expense.
1329506753747279872 2020-11-20 03:28:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CKKelchnerBrew I’m paying now, not had an income since March - now paying to keep my business afloat.
1329502992278622208 2020-11-20 03:13:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBradley_Mans I think you are being more than a little naive and thinking about matters from your own perspective. Maybe try stepping into the shoes of those who rely on this legislation.
1329501731923890179 2020-11-20 03:08:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CKKelchnerBrew @ThePubChampion I agree. Easy to agree to restrictions if it doesn’t cost you anything.
1329458348161425415 2020-11-20 00:15:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Conservatives @BorisJohnson ...what are you doing?
1329452214117691399 2020-11-19 23:51:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Yeah, long-term social isolation never harms anyone and we cannot be trusted to make our own decisions based on our own assessment of risk. The best Christmas present would be if you and the Govt pissed off rather than telling people from your ivory towers what you think is best.
1329451073262784513 2020-11-19 23:46:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Supermarkets most common location for Covid exposure. They are going to ban shopping soon, get some toilet roll in...  https://t.co/eIyDkInKQi
1329439262845132804 2020-11-19 22:59:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This man has championed a wider all inclusive health approach to Covid throughout. Now he’s supporting Pubs. #legend
1329438762435293186 2020-11-19 22:57:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBradley_Mans You are all out the first chance we get. There is no coming back from the Covid mess.
1329417448337133569 2020-11-19 21:33:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LizHind3 @Labour_Business @darrenpjones @RebeccaSmithers @forpubs I blame Labour for not making their support for lockdown conditional on adequate support for businesses. I also blame Labour for not calling out on the errors in the data and for not questioning the overall narrative and lack of strategy. Tory backbench is the opposition.
1329413615695368192 2020-11-19 21:17:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LizHind3 @Labour_Business @darrenpjones @RebeccaSmithers @forpubs Yes, but Labour is complicit by supporting them in votes for this lockdown for example. I will be rescinding my membership and I won’t vote for either of them so long as I live.
1329411005882003456 2020-11-19 21:07:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LizHind3 @Labour_Business @darrenpjones @RebeccaSmithers @forpubs I spent £1200 just on Statutory gas and electrical safety inspections. It’s just not sustainable. I’m disappointed that the Labour Party are supporting the Government’s restrictions with the proviso of adequate support.
1329409810987687940 2020-11-19 21:02:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LizHind3 @Labour_Business @darrenpjones @RebeccaSmithers @forpubs They should. But the problem is now even bigger than pub rents. We cannot continue to be closed and restricted without adequate support to pay even the non-rent bills.
1329403512460111875 2020-11-19 20:37:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBradley_Mans @EMA_Airport Your party is killing businesses with this ridiculous policy of the whole nation hiding from a virus.
1329400218312450048 2020-11-19 20:24:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alexanderterry The point is that they are not and they are not supporting business owners enough. It should not be acceptable to close things for the public good but not to fully compensate those affected. That is a dereliction of duty.
1329397038660849665 2020-11-19 20:12:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavidLammy @CarolineLucas Why are you and your party supporting this incompetent Govt?
1329396637073088512 2020-11-19 20:10:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SashaToMyMates With a view should come accountability and the cost of that decision.
1329393131813543936 2020-11-19 19:56:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NelsonBrooks15 I will also pay long-term.
1329392108378206209 2020-11-19 19:52:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @nonamebandk Yes, and those supporting it all are not paying the price that we are.
1329391257060335616 2020-11-19 19:49:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon @unitetheunion @UniteNEYH Yet you support the Government in bankrupting small business owners like me who have had no income since March. You are a total hypocrite.
1329390734047399936 2020-11-19 19:47:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> As a business owner having had no income since March I think that I’ve sacrificed enough. It’s way overdue to level up and have a discussion about everyone contributing part of their income to fund the financial impact of further lockdowns and restrictions.
1329369808803143681 2020-11-19 18:23:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyCarragher @Mark_BeerArt @ProtectPubs I agree. We need to get on with life. People need to make their own decisions on whether to isolate.
1329368547110367235 2020-11-19 18:18:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JeremyVineOn5 So the message is ok to kill granny at Christmas, just be aware that you won’t be able to visit her in hospital in January and only 15 will be able to attend her funeral.
1329361971687337986 2020-11-19 17:52:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyCarragher @Mark_BeerArt @ProtectPubs I don’t understand the relevance of the question?
1329357054331510787 2020-11-19 17:33:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson No, the first duty is not to lock all 67 million of your citizens up.
1329261759119708160 2020-11-19 11:14:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JENFL23 @ProudSocialist Moderates market themselves as  progressives. They also market progressives as extremists.
1329247729109901313 2020-11-19 10:18:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AvonandsomerRob In other words, you can kill granny over a turkey dinner on Christmas Day but you won’t see her in hospital and only 15 will be allowed to her funeral during the January lockdown. None of it makes any sense.
1329232343593267202 2020-11-19 09:17:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon You need to research a bit more. Limited excess deaths. Average age of death 82. Flu almost disappeared. Tests inaccurate. People dying “with”. Untold deaths and damage caused by lockdowns. It needs a big brain politician to look it afresh and develop a proportionate strategy.
1329223479246417920 2020-11-19 08:42:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> He just wants to work to provide for his family.
1329222246729211906 2020-11-19 08:37:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> So, our scientists are saying that you can risk granny’s life over a turkey dinner at Christmas, but don’t expect to see her in intensive care or have more than 15 at her funeral in January because we will be locked down. For goodness sake, it’s either safe to see granny or not.
1329219993465139207 2020-11-19 08:28:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @themartinfish @GiloBabb Do you do humour?

PMQs is laughable with only meaningless platitudes exchanges. We are fed up with you all.
1329207124711378958 2020-11-19 07:37:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pub_that I have decided to close on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I just don’t have the staffing and, as Dave says, will be very difficult to manage.

1329189023437496321 2020-11-19 06:25:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darklordbarnet @scoutnick They have a lower death rate per million than the U.K. the demos would seem that they don’t want to “pay the price” with their freedom.
1329185851360894977 2020-11-19 06:12:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mark_BeerArt @ProtectPubs Thanks Mark...world has gone mad!!
1329175710548840452 2020-11-19 05:32:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman It’s gone already. With restrictions, the best any of us can hope for is to break even.
1329173779579342852 2020-11-19 05:24:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> No, No, No....  https://t.co/FxQRmYyvmh
1329157343729365002 2020-11-19 04:19:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Stayathomemum6 Eeerm, I think you have got lost somewhere in the Government telling you what to do. Even if they lift the restrictions, you don’t need to change what you do. Sort of breaking the rules in reverse. It’s what used to be called liberty.
1329155554388955139 2020-11-19 04:12:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ed_Miliband Thank god for that.
1329136061273018370 2020-11-19 02:55:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @erinnblackk Ok, do you wear a mask to protect others or protect yourself? If the former then you shouldn’t worry too much about noses not being covered because aerosol droplets mainly come from the mouth unless a person sneezes. If the latter, then it really is up to the wearer.
1329122803631710208 2020-11-19 02:02:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson @Conservatives relaunch for 2030....  https://t.co/JVx6mmwQkV

We cannot just reinvent our businesses especially after a year of losses. It takes investment and time to build a profit - for me it took 4 years to build a good strong business.
1329089398294515714 2020-11-18 23:49:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Love this quote by Lord Lawson on Boris Johnson’s Green Reset...  https://t.co/6CylioGYR5
1329076341036122113 2020-11-18 22:57:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Conservatives @BorisJohnson Listen, I’m going to be nice about this, but straight to the point. The majority of people in this country think that you are stark raving mad to announce a ban on cars in 2030 whilst you are making such a pigs ear of Covid and wrecking the country with restrictions and lockdown.
1329062940138475520 2020-11-18 22:04:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’m not convinced that now - whilst bankrupting a closed country, withdrawing basic human rights and causing untold damage to health and well-being - is the best time to announce a ban on cars in 2030. ⁦@Conservatives⁩ have lost the plot.   https://t.co/nMHAvfTrtW
1329050957414604802 2020-11-18 21:16:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 But, given the situation, I think we’d rather see a strategy that gets us out of this dystopian mess for good, not just for Christmas.
1329046784342192129 2020-11-18 21:00:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scoutnick @darklordbarnet Death by restriction?
1329046650111799298 2020-11-18 20:59:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson Not interested. Open up the country now.
1329045838413361152 2020-11-18 20:56:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> They are on about saving Christmas again. A strategy for the country that is destroying lives and businesses based on allowing one day of social contact. I cannot comprehend the stupidity of these people.
1329042121152749569 2020-11-18 20:41:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oldmudgie It’s all gone. I don’t even have the staff now to deal with the busy Christmas week so I’m closing for part of it regardless. Can’t stock up or plan.
1329041184652746752 2020-11-18 20:38:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darklordbarnet And still, by the looks of it, a huge number of people think that the restrictions are worse.
1328892087861993475 2020-11-18 10:45:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ClareCraigPath Could the likelihood that the Rapid tests represent individual persons and the PCR tests likely to involve multiple tests on individuals have an impact?
1328890037061226498 2020-11-18 10:37:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is what the UK needs to do. Mass peaceful protest.
1328889538362662913 2020-11-18 10:35:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Rules relaxed for 5 days from Christmas Eve.....Sage are worried any longer may “normalise” this behaviour....they have not a feckin clue...
1328882833318944772 2020-11-18 10:08:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MrHarryCole @BrexitAssembly @kateferguson4 It’s a ridiculous notion that, having sacrificed everything, for one day we can be normal, then immediately go back to this crap. It just serves to highlight the sheer pointlessness of it all.
1328861197723193351 2020-11-18 08:42:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @cjsnowdon “Save Christmas”....it’s already been wrecked for retail and hospitality. Her wilful ignorance and disregard of the carnage she has inflicted on these sectors is astounding.
1328848469944016897 2020-11-18 07:52:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @btharris93 @SuzanneEvans1 May I remind you of the garden bridge, the water canon and, most recently, the handling of Covid. He’s an imbecile, it’s not going to happen. @Conservatives are toast...
1328835736221708289 2020-11-18 07:01:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I actually felt very moved reading this Facebook status by one of my regular customers who lives alone and is desperately missing the company of the pub. We need to be looking at the whole picture of the role of hospitality to wellbeing. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/E5rlpXZmiv

1328827885256388608 2020-11-18 06:30:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MoodyBlues85 Even worse it’s positive tests. Not a Dr diagnosis, tests are known not to be accurate and each test does not necessarily equate to an individual person.

1328821646124326915 2020-11-18 06:05:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Sage suggests planting a Christmas tree in your garden and opening presents outdoors. It is because of a lack of understanding of the real world and political ineptitude that brings us here. There is no option but to tell them to get lost now.   https://t.co/nYUSbjq90J

1328810473769283586 2020-11-18 05:21:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SteveBakerHW Only it doesn’t end because we are back to restrictions, probably tighter ones and threats of more closure. Christmas is not happening for all the business affected. I don’t even have enough staff now to staff a busy week. The position we’re in is absolutely hopeless.
1328808164658130946 2020-11-18 05:12:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KinsonVictor @norfolkguy2 @GeorgeAylett I don’t think that’s true. The Covid fiasco will rumble on and will never be forgotten, the Green agenda will not go down well, those “borrowed” votes to get Brexit done will go elsewhere.
1328805775091830786 2020-11-18 05:02:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lesherring3 @coffeekate2 A publican from a tied pub may pay £120 for a 9 gallon which would otherwise be available on the open market for £70.

The only MPs doing making noise are Tory backbenchers. Create a fair playing field by losing the beer tie - people will choose where they want to drink like they choose supermarket.

1328738711513796608 2020-11-18 00:36:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Sacha_Lord @AndyBurnhamGM Can you let us - hospitality owners - know what you are talking about as the words of the saviours in your tweet neither match reality nor what you say in the video. There will be no hospitality sector in Manchester or anywhere else if Govt keeps locking down and restricting us.

1328659034942148608 2020-11-17 19:19:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Banning indoor socialising when “lockdown” ends is simply continuing lockdown. This is a ridiculous proposal. The Government and their advisers need to feck off now.   https://t.co/engUDXLwpv

Further, that we will still need masks and distance after vaccination. 9 months of chaos, no foreseeable solution and no appreciation of the adverse impact. There needs to be a balanced plan.

It’s not fair that the financial burden falls to individuals and business if we are doing this for the public good.

1328078211511693312 2020-11-16 04:51:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Well said @JuliaHB1 ....@CampaignforPubs

1328076914062483458 2020-11-16 04:46:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DawnHFoster I rejoined after Corbyn. About to terminate again after their pro-lockdown stance and their commitment to censorship on vaccines. Politically lost like most of the country.
1328076263119089683 2020-11-16 04:43:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tnewtondunn It’s the best thing for the nation.
1328076028103827456 2020-11-16 04:42:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer Hopefully that’s the end of the Green Recovery nonsense...
1328073420916068360 2020-11-16 04:32:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Quick, can we have a leadership contest @Conservatives
1328068735375126531 2020-11-16 04:13:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Maltmeister2 😂😂😂😂imagine relying on this lot if your car broke down...

1328063259849740289 2020-11-16 03:52:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan TV star who criticises Government handling and statistics on Covid supports Government Covid censorship campaign....you really do sound ridiculous now....
1328062533572366337 2020-11-16 03:49:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SteveBakerHW Denmark just got a Govt u-turn with a pots and pans demos. What about #endlockdowns doorstep protest Thursday 8pm? We all bang on our pots and pans.
1328060173831827456 2020-11-16 03:39:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The very notion that this shower of @Conservatives could organise a Green Recovery, Great Reset or Build Back Better is laughable - they can’t even sort PPE, Track and Trace and public clarity and support during a deadly pandemic!!  Sling ‘em out!!
1328057826716110853 2020-11-16 03:30:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @SteveBakerHW And @Conservatives are making a complete fool of themselves with this Green Revolution, Reset, Build Back Better - they can’t even organise PPE and track and trace 😂😂😂....laughing stock of incompetence...
1328056471888814084 2020-11-16 03:25:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @SteveBakerHW I agree. The nonsense that we can’t protect the vulnerable, but we can lock up the population has to stop.
1328055274243035138 2020-11-16 03:20:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @SteveBakerHW Ha, I don’t mean a long grass review. The only thing that this lockdown could possibly be useful for is a review of the virus, the measures and strategy  and a more sustainable plan from December. 11 days already wasted. What the public do if that doesn’t happen is anyone’s guess
1328049663770042368 2020-11-16 02:58:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Conservatives @BorisJohnson Where was all this in your manifesto? You are toast.
1328043459693961219 2020-11-16 02:33:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SteveBakerHW Then the misery of the tier instructions kick in. I’ve not had an income since March. We need a fundamental review.
1328033898199207937 2020-11-16 01:55:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NadineDorries And being over 82...
1328011074625564673 2020-11-16 00:24:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jessphillips And you are complicit in supporting them. Join the Tory rebels demanding a review of Covid and get this shower out.
1327999209300176897 2020-11-15 23:37:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HaynesGreyhound @joymorrissey @BorisJohnson She’s looking in the wrong direction.

1327993056054927361 2020-11-15 23:13:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darrengrimes_ It’s too late for @BorisJohnson ...we all know he’s an incompetent twit...@Conservatives need to get on with removing him ASAP or they are curtains too...
1327975295425667073 2020-11-15 22:02:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oldmudgie Meaningless hypocrisy whilst she wrecks the hospitality sector in Scotland with her ridiculous 6pm closure and no alcohol...
1327961810037829639 2020-11-15 21:09:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I object to this “pandemic” being used as an “opportunity for a reset”. This is the narrative that generates suspicion and mistrust. These politicians are all working together. They need to sell us any new direction, not force us into it.
1327958628356251651 2020-11-15 20:56:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mariacaulfield @Conservatives Nope, you’ve ruined millions of people with your lack of balance on Covid and obsessions with restriction and lockdowns. You have removed liberties. You have generated fear in people and you haven’t listened. You have shown disregard and incompetence. You will never be forgiven.
1327949008292245504 2020-11-15 20:18:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Our target should not be Christmas. It should be normality.
1327948598747787264 2020-11-15 20:16:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @johnredwood No, the country wants out of this permanently. Freedom is for life, not just for Christmas.
1327945780402016257 2020-11-15 20:05:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer I’m worried by your stance on all this. Covid needs review and perspective. That should be what an opposition should be doing. Instead we rely on Tory backbenchers. You are damaging the Labour Party.
1327926105660133376 2020-11-15 18:47:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TerryBedford10 All health needs to be taken seriously. People die young of lots of things. Lots of fear and myth around Covid - the use of ventilators now a much less used treatment for example. Average age of deaths is 82, higher than normal. It’s way overdue for a review and some perspective.
1327921952997171201 2020-11-15 18:30:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SteveBakerHW It’s great that you are speaking up. But the fear factor of the virus is what needs to be challenged. That is guiding public opinion and the Govt needs challenging to present a much more balanced picture.
1327917745636319234 2020-11-15 18:13:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LBC There will be plenty of the fearful lining up to get it so it will be a long time before they get round to challenging anyone who is unsure or would rather wait a bit to see how it goes.
1327748582322139136 2020-11-15 07:01:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TerryBedford10 Death and disease is very sad. I miss so many of my regulars who have died over the years and friends and family not least my dear old mum. I also enjoy the company of many of my older regulars, including some in their 80s, who know the risks and still want to live their lives.
1327741491624734725 2020-11-15 06:33:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mariaaggaire @JuliaHB1 Yes. And I’m sure it would be busy with people who can manage their own risks and who want to live their lives.
1327740705524109317 2020-11-15 06:30:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LONGPIG68 @JuliaHB1 It is. I’m allowed in it though.
1327738688542007302 2020-11-15 06:22:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 Same as my pub!  https://t.co/PkC4ET1Il5
1327737693149642752 2020-11-15 06:18:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BeardedAvenger1 @HaynesGreyhound It all needs reviewing. Sage should input, but we need alternative voices from science that have not been involved in decisions thus far. We also need to focus on the damage caused by lockdowns and restrictions.
1327728152257376257 2020-11-15 05:40:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Thurstonsbrew It’s incredibly painful and frustrating.
1327727590157717506 2020-11-15 05:38:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HaynesGreyhound I agree. I have no problem doing my bit for a convincing case. But the data and justification does not make sense and their incompetence is astounding. The authoritarianism is completely misplaced and is over-reach.
1327722101298647041 2020-11-15 05:16:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HaynesGreyhound Totally fed up with it like a lot of people. It’s a huge intrusion by an incoherent and incompetent bunch of politicians.
1327719103105294336 2020-11-15 05:04:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I am missing my pub. I am missing all normality. I don’t want a Government that scares people needlessly and tries to manage the minutia of our lives and businesses. I want our freedoms and choices back. I don’t want that just for Christmas Day.
1327685777694875648 2020-11-15 02:52:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan I don’t know anyone who supports Govt policy of deliberate fear, misinformation, incompetence and overreaching and inconsistent rules. We need a fundamental review of everything to do with Covid.
1327624085917093893 2020-11-14 22:47:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WMPolice West Midlands Prefects....
1327480320732622848 2020-11-14 13:15:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darrengrimes_ I often find that when I watch outlandish stuff like this it’s the reverse that I think is true. Having lived the response to Covid and seen the newfound co-operation on climate, I am more worried about the next 4 years than I have been about any other 4 years of my life.
1327416137315979267 2020-11-14 09:00:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @staffordgirl @weerestaurant @JoannaBlythman @Cafe_Mariana @scotgov @NicolaSturgeon No, you are the selfish one. The choice is there for the Scottish Government fully to compensate all hospitality businesses and then we would not have cause to complain. To let us individually pay for the so called public good should outrage everyone. You don’t care.
1327400454674903041 2020-11-14 07:58:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Independent car wash fined £1,000 for being open during lockdown, but Asda car wash ok. Madness.
1327380792612245505 2020-11-14 06:40:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MattHancock It really is disturbing watching this. He needs to be handcuffed and escorted from Departmental premises.  Some live-in time in a secure unit with some support and encouragement from the lovely Drs and nurses. I hope he gets the help he needs.
1327376522722877440 2020-11-14 06:23:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @grantshapps Behave? Eeerm, I’m 50 years old. I behave how I decide to behave.
1327310493233590273 2020-11-14 02:00:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> What does all this mean? Mark Sedwell, the Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service went a few months ago...now these two key advisers. 70 Tories including the Chair of the 1922 Committee set-up an alternative strategy Covid group. Labour lockdown hungry like the Govt.
1327304722194325504 2020-11-14 01:38:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darrengrimes_ Eeeerm, I thought that the Covid response has been responding to “woke”....
1327285669228654593 2020-11-14 00:22:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @robinmonotti I think that he’s autistic. He can only see Covid.
1327281603618410496 2020-11-14 00:06:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnthonyLDN2 That’s not a legitimate argument within the Conditions detailed in the Code. The exception is if all pubs in England Wales are affected - but clearly they are not with restrictions varied between England and Wales and within England as a result of the tier system.
1327276728557965312 2020-11-13 23:46:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR You have a right under the Code to trigger MRO if you have not had a rent review for 5 years regardless of whether your lease provides for a review. Until now, PCA has said Covid restrictions do not trigger because they apply to all pubs - but tiers impact locally.
1327275095027568640 2020-11-13 23:40:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR Thanks. I’ve gone through the process once before. It’s not easy, but worth doing. The Tier restrictions could enable you to trigger now, but if you have a rent review due it’s probably as well to wait.
1327271763231846402 2020-11-13 23:27:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’m pleased to be taking Campaign advice in triggering MRO. I won’t know for 28 days whether Greene King objects, but I’m hopeful they and the PCA will not stand in the way of a genuine need for a rent review due to restrictions. I encourage all tied tenants to do likewise.
1327270620221100032 2020-11-13 23:22:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AlastairPKerr @CampaignforPubs Thank you.
1327228602795094016 2020-11-13 20:35:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @cjsnowdon We all need the sanity of a fundamental review to reconcile the conflicting information everywhere and at every level. Only real facts that can be determined are that Covid numbers are nowhere near as bad as first thought  and lockdown is doing a lot of damage.
1327225498569744385 2020-11-13 20:23:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @dtaylor5633 @R777RAB @ScottishGroup Easy for you to say. I’m one of those who is paying for the closure. I’m happy to accept evidence with full financial recompense. But I’m not happy to accept this crap and not to be fully financially recompensed. This is where your position is easy - mine is incredibly difficult.
1327223505230979073 2020-11-13 20:15:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @dtaylor5633 @R777RAB @ScottishGroup Yes. It actually says on the page they asked the question if someone had been to hospitality that it is not evidence of transmission. I’d imagine the same or more people went to work, the shops, public transport, etc etc. You are mid-reading the data.
1327212389687758849 2020-11-13 19:31:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @dtaylor5633 @R777RAB @ScottishGroup That says that of those testing positing 26% had been in the pub or other hospitality setting within the previous week. Sounds pretty normal to me for pub/hospitality attendance. It’s not evidence of transmission.
1327211157250334720 2020-11-13 19:26:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @dtaylor5633 @R777RAB @ScottishGroup Where’s the source for that?
1327207852994387969 2020-11-13 19:13:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @dtaylor5633 @R777RAB @ScottishGroup Without evidence of hospitality being a major source of spread and/or certain measures like the 10pm curfew making any difference.
1327061334693916672 2020-11-13 09:30:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @R777RAB @ScottishGroup Nothing gets us shut down and nothing stops us getting shut down. In England we have been restricted and now shut down without evidence of spread in hospitality. The Government decides regardless and they also decide not to fully recompense us. Double whammy of abuse by Govt.
1327059519621505025 2020-11-13 09:23:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> All the U.K. Governments have failed to fully to justify their authoritarian actions to restrict hospitality and all of our lives and  to properly compensate businesses. This looks to me like a safe pub layout and a natural human response to football success. It’s going to happen
1327052995075461121 2020-11-13 08:57:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ScotGovFM @NicolaSturgeon @poppyscotland @LegionScotland Jeez, two minute silence must have been hard for her. They fought tyranny, she is tyranny.

1327000963966701572 2020-11-13 05:30:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’ve told the boys they must comply with Covid rules too as per The Sun article. They continued licking their bollocks.  https://t.co/6iS6aWMF7A

1326970045587746822 2020-11-13 03:28:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson @COP26 Oh get lost.
1326968485214351364 2020-11-13 03:21:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BeerEnGin1 😂😂😂 no chance!!
1326968333644738564 2020-11-13 03:21:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan @GMB Maybe you need to do some inward thinking and ask yourself if it’s you?
1326967827736256522 2020-11-13 03:19:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BeerEnGin1 Me too, got a tiny kitchen, wouldn’t be worth opening. Yes, the rationale of this lockdown, the dodgy figures, the text from the pavement for takeaway beer, 10pm curfew have all highlighted the ridiculousness of their handling of the matter.
1326963373326655493 2020-11-13 03:01:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BeerEnGin1 I’m waiting for an alcohol ban in pubs like in Scotland...it’s way beyond ridiculous, the public are increasingly turning and will never forgive them...
1326961071945641984 2020-11-13 02:52:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BeerEnGin1 These people don’t live in the real world...
1326944968225792000 2020-11-13 01:48:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan What is a Covidiot?
1326939729355558913 2020-11-13 01:27:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnthonyLDN2 I’m not even going to try to second guess what they will do as there is neither logic nor fairness in anything they do. There is no strategy. The evidence for this lockdown was wrong. There is no evidence for a 10pm curfew and table service puts staff at more risk. Led by donkeys
1326932543426482178 2020-11-13 00:59:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HTScotPol She has done a good job of staying behind the growing dissatisfaction curve that exists in England towards the authoritarian management of Covid at the expense of everything else. It is only a matter of time though.
1326927297581113345 2020-11-13 00:38:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyMPowell Are you going to join the group set-up by Tory backbenchers to re-think the whole Covid response?
1326926823901552643 2020-11-13 00:36:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I agree 100% with the sentiment, but I’m sure that  restrictions will continue to mean we operate without profit and make it very difficult to manage. I’ve already made the decision to close on certain days as I don’t have the staff. I expect we’ll get little notice of re-opening  https://t.co/MtnXb6IjQd
1326897266012139525 2020-11-12 22:38:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Decades of save the High Street and support small businesses replaced with mandatory use of supermarkets and Amazon, banning plastic bags and straws replaced with disposable masks and gloves. The irony.
1326679957582606337 2020-11-12 08:15:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TimTravis2 We are in the midsts of this in the UK, England currently closed for 4 weeks on data that was admitted to be wrong and after the peak had happened. A vast and growing scepticism now exists. Italy is a few weeks ahead and Ive seen video of civil unrest but I don’t know the extent.
1326665755459530752 2020-11-12 07:18:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TBluestoneinn Same conclusion I came to. Seems perverse to avoid the busiest days, but it’s not worth the meltdown of the current restrictions even if I had enough staff hours to cover the whole couple of weeks. So, I’ll just staff enough of the week to break even and pass on the big nights.
1326624743248826368 2020-11-12 04:36:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This review of the tier system would be very useful. Table service and the 10pm curfew mean that I will run at a loss over Christmas. I currently plan to close on the busiest days, like Christmas Eve, as I don’t have the staff for a sustained busy period and it’s not worth it.
1326622837893894151 2020-11-12 04:28:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBCNewsNI It would seem idiotic to think that whatever they decide for a week will have any significant impact on the course of the virus.
1326605753491271680 2020-11-12 03:20:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tomhfh How does this logic meet with herd immunity thresholds?

1326595025535442944 2020-11-12 02:37:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HaynesGreyhound @jebernstone The Government are acting with evidence, reason or real empathy/support. I could accept it better if even one of these were taken on board.
1326594112775200768 2020-11-12 02:34:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JMarkDodds I honestly don’t know how lots of these barely profitable pubs at the best of times are hanging on or, if they have borrowed money, how they will ever pay it back. We are in dire straights. There’s no end.
1326592361393229825 2020-11-12 02:27:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Fredthepublican Depends what figures you look at and what part of the country.
1326589258052870146 2020-11-12 02:15:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> In a lockdown that isn’t really a lockdown, justified by models that don’t model correctly, to stop an able and comparatively quiet NHS from getting overloaded, to reduce a dangerous virus that isn’t dangerous to the majority. Please stop this now. #endthelockdown
1326507372752359430 2020-11-11 20:49:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Reading that there is little likelihood of restrictions in any of the tiers being relaxed. This means the 10pm curfew and table service will result in a zero profit and operationally impossible Christmas.   https://t.co/H4LBUcRG7r
1326488472652222465 2020-11-11 19:34:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JennyAThatcher I’ve not had any income since March and I’ve had to contribute to the business since the curfew was introduced. Even furlough of staff raises costs the employer in NI, pensions and holiday pay. I’m lucky to have some savings, but won’t last forever. No sign of return to normal.
1326482362784493569 2020-11-11 19:10:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is an all too common scenario.

Where are you @UKLabour - I’m about to rescind my membership.
1326211211336294402 2020-11-11 01:12:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tobyperkinsmp @charlotte2153 You leave at an all time low with @UKLabour voting with the Government to close the sector - and I have not heard a peep since the Government admitted that the data used to inform the lockdown was grossly over-estimated.

1326000129065836545 2020-11-10 11:14:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Just pondering the PM’s assertion that we cannot rely upon the vaccine as a solution. So what does that mean for the strategy - if we had one? Does anyone know?

1325854054694723586 2020-11-10 01:33:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> More confirmation that he is completely out of touch with people in the country. You haven’t justified this lockdown and we are sick to death of your buffoonery...we want new and proportionate leadership...  https://t.co/bvxcKAzKHs

1325804756271566848 2020-11-09 22:17:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The restrictions in Wales for hospitality businesses are incredibly onerous and way beyond the point that a hospitality business could be run in a viable way. ⁦@CampaignforPubs⁩   https://t.co/UU2gPpCmrU

1325784273224392704 2020-11-09 20:56:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NelsonBrooks15 has written a fantastic poem about the modern day Battle of Barnet to save our pubs.  https://t.co/Yovj3MTr2n

1325465051042639874 2020-11-08 23:47:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson The irony. A Prime Minister speaks about remembering the fight against tyranny at a time when he has placed his nation of 67million people under house arrest based on incorrect data.

1325445459834531841 2020-11-08 22:29:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mrdudder Well said. Unbelievable. Where is the opposition now - @UKLabour
1325284209175523328 2020-11-08 11:49:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> First we have the Govt admit that the data used to justify lockdown was a gross over-estimation. Infection rates in 2/3 of London Boroughs, including Barnet, are downward. Now we have packed public places all over London. I don’t know why we’re closed.   https://t.co/NVx6mX6wNG
1325281946558230530 2020-11-08 11:40:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fact_covid @michaelgove @MattHancock Bit of a side issue. The question now is whether the lockdown is justified based upon the revised data.
1325173526324711424 2020-11-08 04:29:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tombowran @SadiqKhan Agree. Problem is Covid has shown that we have clowns on the left and clowns on the right. The whole two-party “democratic” system needs to be overhauled. That probably also applies to the US. We don’t have democracy.
1325168399295664128 2020-11-08 04:09:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LukeJohnsonRCP Having a Prime Minister that can be “bounced” into stuff is the worrying thing.

1325116197654974465 2020-11-08 00:41:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon Meanwhile in the U.K., for which you are elected to serve, you have banned parents from seeing their children and businesses to close based on data that is proved days later to be grossly incorrect. You need to concentrate on matters closer to home.
1325115532564189184 2020-11-08 00:38:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SeldomGruntled @darklordbarnet I’m not so sure. The exposure this has given to the institutional failure of our permanent public servants, to our party political system and our lack of democracy is quite profound. I have never questioned the loss of reason and balance to this degree.

We need her to take a reasoned view, reversing the suspension of the Code which she has no power to do. It’s clear that the divergence between England and Wales and the tier system creates a position where Conditions C and D are met.
1325091412594012160 2020-11-07 23:03:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan But is the mutated version of any real significance to the emerging picture of gross over-estimation of what the country is dealing with? @Conservatives and @UKLabour have locked down the country on data that is admitted days later to be wrong. Need a full &amp; evidenced review.
1325089127067508749 2020-11-07 22:54:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darklordbarnet Agree. But never in my lifetime has such incompetence and mid-use of data been so exposed. There will be backlash.
1325080404827787265 2020-11-07 22:19:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ian_Campbell_ @cjsnowdon Sounds easy if you are not waiting for treatment for another condition, you don’t have a business going bankrupt, you enjoy being under house arrest, we don’t mind bankrupting the country - and we stop international travel. You need to get out the lab and into the real world.
1325071204974272514 2020-11-07 21:42:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Incompetence. @Conservatives will never be trusted again.

How do you feel about being duped or getting caught out duping the public?
1325066316844326914 2020-11-07 21:23:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It’s absolutely clear now that the scientific advice being received by Govt is incorrect - so both ⁦@Conservatives⁩ and ⁦@UKLabour⁩ have agreed to lockdown on false information. There has to be a review of that decision.   https://t.co/XWd1wyHMJ6

1324858621520465923 2020-11-07 07:38:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> How on earth can the Govt say that massive over-estimations in hospitalisations and deaths by Sage do not affect their decision to lockdown to protect the NHS? This Is just gross incompetence. We need a fundamental review.   https://t.co/vS8FvjlCO4
1324781341712502785 2020-11-07 02:30:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @twosawyersCT1 I’m not sure as the rationale for the lockdown is shaky to say the least and indicators are already downward. There’s clearly a problem with Sage data and advice and a fundamental review of it all is long overdue.
1324780788160888833 2020-11-07 02:28:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pubscodepca does not appear to have the powers to suspend Statute and to do so for pubs in Wales as a result of lockdown in England is clearly wrong. Further, it seems clear that the tiered system and separate lockdowns provide a MRO trigger for all tied tenants in E&amp;W.
1324778885997842435 2020-11-07 02:21:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @twosawyersCT1 It’s more like “social-down”! Allowed to work and go to school/college, but not allowed to socialise.
1324735699753590784 2020-11-06 23:29:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Mitre and 3 other adjacent businesses closed - there are plenty more in this High Street and High Streets up and down the country.

1324730545406939136 2020-11-06 23:09:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pubscodepca It’s pretty clear that all tied Pubs in England and Wales may trigger MRO under Regulation 7.

1324559629540536320 2020-11-06 11:49:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> A consequence of incompetent authoritarian Government that creates blame for a virus that passes through the natural act of breathing and living. They cannot protect the vulnerable, but they can spend £billions locking up a whole population of 67 million people. Need a review.
1324547549315911680 2020-11-06 11:01:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TVKev The NHS is also obsessed by telling us to stop doing the things that pay for it. My business has paid £millions of tax in the last decade, now the NHS requires it to stop trading to protect it. The situation is perverse.
1324513667115864066 2020-11-06 08:47:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson A pointless Briefing with yet more contextless numbers about patients in hospital with a positive Covid test.

1324385764898209792 2020-11-06 00:19:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 My pub was (Covid-safe) packed last night with people of all ages up and into their 80s with no fear of the virus and no confidence in the Government. Maybe a poll has revealed the truth....
1324375217662267393 2020-11-05 23:37:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SuzanneEvans1 He knows his dodgy data and reasoning is crumbling. They are losing it. My (Covid safe) packed pub last night was in complete consensus had no fear of the virus, just anger and bewilderment for @Conservatives .  https://t.co/AL1oCztGvo
1324371971426209795 2020-11-05 23:24:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Office for Statistics expresses concerns about the data being presented by the Government to justify extreme lockdowns and restrictions. This is a serious intervention and should ring alarm bells. #endthelockdown
1324363540636065794 2020-11-05 22:50:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @leoniedelt Don’t think like you were in March. Despite what they tell us what the polls say, I had a packed pub last night, no fear of the virus, just anger and bewilderment at our politicians. This is totally different to March - and they know it. #endthelockdown
1324360615134220290 2020-11-05 22:39:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate The only possible use of this lockdown is a strategic review of the country’s response to Covid as a whole. We know more about the virus, it’s lesser danger to the wider population, that it’s not going away, and that the damage caused by lockdowns and restrictions is massive.
1324353738690174977 2020-11-05 22:11:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mrdudder @theresa_may Gross incompetence. @Conservatives @BorisJohnson will never be forgiven.
1324352778634989569 2020-11-05 22:08:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mrdudder The data does not support what is happening, exactly what @theresa_may said yesterday. #endthelockdown
1324346694583144449 2020-11-05 21:43:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We are a vibrant and profitable independent business that is enjoyed by the community and has contributed a few £million to the Exchequer in the past 10 years. We have been closed by the Government based on data proven to be incorrect and no strategic reasoning. #endthelockdown  https://t.co/oBqpMND5PP
1324336955426033664 2020-11-05 21:05:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Sacha_Lord @AndyBurnhamGM Not really. @UKLabour is failing to address the fundamental issues with the data. We need to push for a full review.
1324333885564604419 2020-11-05 20:52:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’ve asked the question of @pubscodepca whether MRO is now triggered by the Govt’s response to Covid now being regional and the Lockdown differences - and when she’s going to update her guidance. If so, it is unacceptable that she has suspended the Pubs Code. @CampaignforPubs
1324332677688942592 2020-11-05 20:48:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pubscodepca Can you confirm that the Tier system and the English lockdown are now a trigger for MRO particularly as these events meet Condition C. Please advise when you will be updating your guidance on MRO triggers. @CampaignforPubs
1324329288859078656 2020-11-05 20:34:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alexwoods82 @t0nit0ne There has to be a change somewhere.
1324325530431348737 2020-11-05 20:19:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Lockdown = go to work and school, but don’t socialise. #endthelockdown  https://t.co/Jhuq5mnH9U
1324324568916480001 2020-11-05 20:15:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate @RishiSunak It says to me that this lockdown and further restrictions are going to go on. We ought to be pushing for a fundamental review.
1324322307767259137 2020-11-05 20:06:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Sacha_Lord I fear that means a longer closure and/or more onerous restrictions. Meanwhile, many hospitality and associated owners have had no income since March. We need to be pushing for a fundamental review.
1324315557164961793 2020-11-05 19:40:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alexwoods82 @t0nit0ne Exactly why we need a fundamental review.

1324167953995223041 2020-11-05 09:53:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @StewartDunb @RichardBurgon No, it’s just a silly question if you cannot see that the Covid response denies fundamental freedoms, like seeing  families and friends, being at the bedside of old, ill and dying loved ones, children not being allowed to play, restricting business opening, etc, eye
1324167075166826496 2020-11-05 09:50:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alexwoods82 @t0nit0ne Less deadly than it was first thought to be. Back in Jan/Feb, death rate was thought to be 3%. Now 0.3 or thereabouts. Flu with a vaccine is 0.1. At what level warrants the utter destruction of the Covid response?
1324165042405806082 2020-11-05 09:42:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Very busy lockdown night. No fear of the virus like last lockdown, just frustration and utter bewilderment at the @Conservatives and @UKLabour response to it. #CancelTheLockdown  https://t.co/2xx9yG0dUb
1324047335513612292 2020-11-05 01:54:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @StewartDunb @RichardBurgon What a silly question.
1324028829896159233 2020-11-05 00:40:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @alexwoods82 @t0nit0ne 1. Re-evaluation of the risk and strategy (the virus is better understood, less deadly than first thought and there is not consensus amongst scientists on best course of action) 2. Persuasion, not authoritarianism; 3. restoring liberty and choice and protection for vulnerable.
1324019414996570118 2020-11-05 00:03:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Peston @infosuphighway But disgracefully @UKLabour will vote with the Govt. these politicians will never be forgiven.
1323995972377206786 2020-11-04 22:30:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is clearly an experienced and senior politician speaking - the Civil Service I knew would have done a full impact assessment and the politicians I knew would be asking for it and looking at it. @theresa_may  https://t.co/n6HwVesEKG
1323978122484682752 2020-11-04 21:19:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @lisanandy The explanation is simple: Covid has been a terrifying reminder to people of what more state intervention can mean in terms of freedoms and the economy.
1323975330743439360 2020-11-04 21:08:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKLabour @Conservatives voting for a poorly evidenced “lockdown”.  Banning social interaction, closing gyms and children’s sports, criminalising family get togethers, restricting what we buy, delaying healthcare, destroying businesses. This is actually surreal. #noforgiveness.
1323970676823367680 2020-11-04 20:49:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @t0nit0ne @alexwoods82 Because the alternative was offering more lockdown, restrictions and masks.
1323968470321647616 2020-11-04 20:40:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon How dare you support the oppression of our country on the basis of poor evidence.
1323953754446700544 2020-11-04 19:42:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TomBoadle “And then he will re-introduce the tier system with a further tightening of measures, more areas will be placed in the higher tiers to get through Christmas and new lockdowns and further restrictions in 2021”....he’s got to change the narrative completely and end this chaos.
1323952235047518208 2020-11-04 19:36:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CatharineHoey @BBCNews @afneil @piersmorgan I think Trump’s more pragmatic response to Covid has swung this - people are more threatened by authoritarian lockdowns, restrictions and new normal than they are of Covid.
1323932600986226688 2020-11-04 18:18:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Conservatives The Conservative Party - the party of State intervention - people control, business rules and regulation, public ownership and aid. Since 2020.  https://t.co/jla4DOxA2k
1323915442499604480 2020-11-04 17:10:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BeerNouveau This is illustrative of the disaster that the Government’s response has been throughout: over-specified, micro-managing authoritarianism.
1323913789281095680 2020-11-04 17:03:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @bernjcc @Manonthefence @SteveBakerHW Improving what though? The systematic destruction of our businesses?
1323912701207285760 2020-11-04 16:59:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell I’d disagree there. Why different rules for takeaway alcohol - and different rules between pubs and supermarkets? This is part of the whole problem of the Government’s reaction - over-complicated and prescriptive authoritarianism. This is not North Korea, but it feels like it.
1323904428508880901 2020-11-04 16:26:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell I’m just fed up with the pointlessness of the silliness of the rules.
1323799397168238594 2020-11-04 09:29:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @katman_999 My first estimate was that it would unravel 3 weeks after the first lockdown....obviously not to be....I find it hard to believe that we are where we are now...unravel it will though...
1323791870699409409 2020-11-04 08:59:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> So, last day of trading until 3 December at the earliest and then back to the tier system. We’ve already had 18 weeks closure, 40 plus pages of restrictions, 10pm curfew, table service only, and tier 2. I think we are all exasperated. We need this to end.
1323763547931873280 2020-11-04 07:06:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ArmstrongKimbo @CampaignforPubs Better. But got to order in advance and not enter the premises. Makes little sense as a disease control measure when any of us can walk into a supermarket.
1323762994535374848 2020-11-04 07:04:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @simondolan @JohnAALogan Astounding. This is part of the reason why we are in such a mess.
1323746460136050688 2020-11-04 05:58:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oldmudgie Absolutely ridiculous, they are stark raving mad...
1323712459035824128 2020-11-04 03:43:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This video is well worth a read.
1323685597064683522 2020-11-04 01:56:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jmcalder101 Common sense? Customers need to phone or text pubs an order for takeaway beers but can walk straight into Tesco and buy one in the normal way? And don’t get me started on Pubs closing and schools staying open...
1323679591282757637 2020-11-04 01:33:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Absolutely bizarre. The Government written the pub takeaway alcohol ban to allow people to phone or text a beer order to a pub, but not cross the threshold. This is bizarre to say the least when any of us can walk into any supermarket to buy alcohol. This is not disease control.  https://t.co/z2MKPbaaQD
1323678366231351296 2020-11-04 01:28:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Pieandapint @WBandBEER @RowanMolyneux It’s mighty odd that Tesco does not have those restrictions.

Even as a publican who has been treated appallingly by the Govt., I would accept a limited lockdown for the purposes of enabling the Government to get their act in order. But there is no visible strategy or plan or even intention. It’s just fear, restrictions and bluster.

1323644735429451776 2020-11-03 23:14:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BareReality Surely they can drive to their country retreat beforehand?

1323598860330192901 2020-11-03 20:12:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MPIainDS @MailOnline Why are they doing this? Is it just lazy Government to restrict people and businesses rather than build NHS capacity?
1323594612250988544 2020-11-03 19:55:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 @RobertJenrick Requiring business and people to be increasingly restricted is lazy and incompetent Government. They should be building the NHS which they say is the bottleneck.
1323592392327471105 2020-11-03 19:46:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DonnyBrewery Very worrying. There is no plan. They have committed to absolutely nothing in terms of building the NHS up to better cope with a peak. It is just incompetent and lazy Government to restrict the population and business without doing anything to end that restriction.
1323589661768503297 2020-11-03 19:35:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Johnson says lockdown 2 should end 2 December and we should have “beaten” the virus by March. I have serious worries about what happens in between, what triggers the end or not on 2 December and what they plan for beating it. We need to push for a fundamental review.
1323587890769788929 2020-11-03 19:28:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Powerful letter to @michaelgove by one of his own supporters about the terrible path @Conservatives are taking us that does not make sense and has not been impact assessed.
1323584725739544577 2020-11-03 19:16:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WinterburnSimon @CampaignforPubs Not a herd immunity plan....

1323393452789387270 2020-11-03 06:36:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @sbtyrrell @CampaignforPubs Look, too many times we hear of breaking or a slight bending of the rules by an odd individual and that will always happen. That’s not a reason to ban it for everyone. Besides, how many people eat a Greggs sausage roll and then go back for another?
1323392389210398721 2020-11-03 06:31:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @inalexworld @Conservatives Unfortunately there was no credible alternative so the majority who voted for them were not necessarily wrong. I think, however, we’ve all had a wake up call and it’s clear that this Conservative/Labour monopoly on our democracy is not good. There’s need to be complete change.

Now please can you and your Govt review the stats, develop a proportionate strategy, get track and trace working and build the NHS up so that it can cope.

1323373280577916930 2020-11-03 05:15:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Can you believe the audacity of this man to praise a desperate hospitality marketing campaign by Burger King pleading for business when him and his Government have wrecked the industry by their sheer incompetence. @Conservatives are finished. Will never be trusted.
1323372224200540167 2020-11-03 05:11:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @FlanOBriens I’m only supporting what he says about Covid, nothing more.
1323371957505634304 2020-11-03 05:10:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scullyp @KareemNaaman Eeerm, we’re all on our knees because of your Govt’s incompetence. Go and review the stats, develop a proper and proportionate strategy and communication plan, fix track and trace and, above all, build the NHS so it can cope. Stop blaming others and closing business.
1323370391843278868 2020-11-03 05:04:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @FlanOBriens I agree with what he’s saying here on Covid though.
1323347305387466752 2020-11-03 03:32:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheShiredale And furlough isn’t free to employers.
1323347089921892358 2020-11-03 03:31:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Douglas4Moray @robertsondcang1 Just to clarify that it is employers who protect Scottish and other U.K. jobs. The furlough scheme requires a contribution from employers of NI, pension and holiday amounting to 30%. You and other Govts have restricted/closed us beyond viability and jobs are and will be lost.

1323301068789501955 2020-11-03 00:28:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheGunnersPub @NicolaSturgeon It is well know that Scotland takes more - but squeal the loudest! I can say that as I’m a Scot, albeit a unionist one.
1323300323906248704 2020-11-03 00:25:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Not a single voice in Parliament gets that there is now an urgent need for a fundamental review of the virus versus the destruction of the measures Parliament is implementing to try to control it. It is this that scares me, not the virus.
1323298926397673472 2020-11-03 00:20:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NicolaSturgeon She seemed to suggest today that it may be worth going into lockdown just to get England’s money...
1323296881968111619 2020-11-03 00:12:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LeedsBrewster @staffsbrewery @CampaignforPubs Why should we only click and collect, but Tesco next door can just sell on spec?
1323295458748485634 2020-11-03 00:06:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @wjaltd @ProtectPubs Depends how you are set-up.
1323291345310699525 2020-11-02 23:50:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman @BorisJohnson What does defeat mean?
1323289152289415168 2020-11-02 23:41:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tobyperkinsmp @Keir_Starmer Just to reinforce: “let’s have a lockdown”  is completely different to let’s have a lockdown so we can (1) review the science and strategy and comms; (2) build NHS capacity; (3) get track and trace right; (4) anything else that makes sure we don’t fail and have to lockdown again
1323286623237345280 2020-11-02 23:31:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tobyperkinsmp @Keir_Starmer I’m angry Toby. Angry that I and all publicans and retailers are paying this price. Where has Labour been for the last six months? I don’t want to hear your triumphalism about you being right that a lockdown is needed. I want you all to tell us how you are going to fix it.
1323285452514824194 2020-11-02 23:26:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ProtectPubs And ordering whatever they like on Amazon...
1323279583572041733 2020-11-02 23:03:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @staffsbrewery @CampaignforPubs Why should we have to work-around another daft and unjustified Govt rule?
1323278530763984897 2020-11-02 22:59:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnnelieseDodds @SamEspensen Twits on the left, twits on the right. Look at the data properly and review the whole thing. The Con/Lab political monopoly is over after this.
1323272554665168896 2020-11-02 22:35:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Government is actually defending its decision not to allow pubs to sell takeaway alcohol during the lockdown. But it’s still on sale in supermarkets? I completely despair. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/G0zDDcVy3k
1323270713890033665 2020-11-02 22:28:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ADonnellyWriter And Nov 5th to start the lockdown...
1323270587901485057 2020-11-02 22:27:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ADonnellyWriter Those of us paying for it see it differently.
1323266885480271873 2020-11-02 22:13:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer @tobyperkinsmp No you fool. The Government’s failure to communicate effectively and to build effective track and trace and expand the NHS means that they feel that they have no option but to use the absolute last resort of a lockdown. Lockdown is failure.
1323259052722368518 2020-11-02 21:41:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Critic_GStewart @JuliaHB1 The irony of being allowed to remember those who faced up to tyranny whilst we are under house arrest for a feckin virus...
1323256050221535232 2020-11-02 21:30:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> That’s Greene King and Adnams so far supporting their tenants by cancelling the rent. A lifeline now for desperate tenants and we are very grateful. What’s happening with the other big pub landlords? @CampaignforPubs
1323251149663817728 2020-11-02 21:10:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheShiredale The “support” doesn’t pay the bills, never mind giving us an income.
1323249639865389056 2020-11-02 21:04:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NatalieHats @UK_4_Democracy Covid has proved that, for democracy, we must break the Conservative/Labour monopoly on our politics. I will, therefore, absolutely be looking for an alternative next time around.
1323241433638293505 2020-11-02 20:31:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> A month off work on 80% pay sounds very attractive. As a business owner I’m on my 8th month with no pay and having to spend money keeping my business afloat. The pain is not being shared and I think that would make a difference to the support for lockdown.
1323233936596738049 2020-11-02 20:02:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EstherMcVey1 It’s not enough. The public will never forgive the Conservative Party for this.
1323233555934269455 2020-11-02 20:00:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NeilDotObrien Lockdown is a failure to engage the public in a balanced way and a failure to develop reliable testing, track and trace and sufficient hospital capacity. It fails the whole country and @Conservatives will never be forgiven.
1323218347232808966 2020-11-02 19:00:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @freddiesayers I can see this taking traction. I’ve been politically lost and floating for quite a few years as none of the main parties offer the right package. The handling of Covid has made me feel that we must, must break their political monopoly.
1323201802293170176 2020-11-02 17:54:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan How many countries have seen 4,000 Covid deaths a day? Answer is none I believe. I’ve just seen a stat that the maximum in a day in the whole world is 8500?
1323199463469600768 2020-11-02 17:45:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan @RishiSunak I have zero confidence. It started with 3 weeks to flatten the curve, became 18 weeks. Countless restrictions since. Lockdown and restrictions have become the Conservative Govts get-out from managing Covid and building the NHS to cope. Shocking situation.
1323198639360102400 2020-11-02 17:41:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I have zero confidence in this Govt that lockdown will end on 2 December. We started this in March with 3 weeks to flatten the curve. Countless creeping restrictions since. Lockdowns and restrictions are now the established alternative to Govt and the NHS managing the problem
1323084146235875328 2020-11-02 10:06:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 @NEUnion The Govt doesn’t give a toss either about whether children get educated. I reckon this is about herd immunity. Why else would they lockdown everything else but the very cause of the current spike?
1322999050359242752 2020-11-02 04:28:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Again setting political views aside, I am finding myself agreeing this time with Nigel Farage in relation to lockdown. Why is there no mainstream opposition to what is clearly a very extreme policy? With an election more than 4 years away this can only lead to serious discontent.
1322986171883016195 2020-11-02 03:37:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @brynth_ @CudmoreKaren @mrjamesob Are you suggesting the Government care other than to use those people for the purposes of diffusing the hole they are in with the virus?
1322969740575461377 2020-11-02 02:32:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CudmoreKaren @mrjamesob This lockdown is obviously to achieve the controlled spread amongst kids and their parents. Why else would they keep schools open and close everything else that is having little impact on the spread.
1322969043515723780 2020-11-02 02:29:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mrjamesob @SamEspensen Asking the Government what they are going to do - like build NHS capacity - to minimise the lockdown period and to avoid a subsequent one would seem to me to be the best use of time.
1322966874787860481 2020-11-02 02:20:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Warnzwifey @WCphilosopher @RichardBurgon I agree. “Controlled spread” is the Swedish approach which I think must be the way forward. I reckon that is what the Govt is doing otherwise it would make no sense to keep education open.
1322957980975927297 2020-11-02 01:45:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Intermittent lockdown doesn’t stop the spread of Covid indefinitely or affect individual susceptibility. It just delays matters. Lockdown kills people in other ways. Hopefully this clarification improves your contribution to the debate. You don’t have to thank me.
1322950649810661376 2020-11-02 01:16:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Maybe the Govt should have the experts in cancer and coronavirus talking to one another and then we can have a joint plan.
1322949132399632387 2020-11-02 01:10:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Warnzwifey @WCphilosopher @RichardBurgon The only credible strategies appear to be elimination and sealed borders; or controlled spread.
1322943835165675522 2020-11-02 00:49:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> “We” have got to act to suspend our lives because @BorisJohnson  @MattHancock @Conservatives  have failed to build NHS capacity and clearly they want to keep education open to spread the virus amongst the younger population. So what are they going to do to build NHS capacity?
1322939474964340737 2020-11-02 00:32:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @katman_999 Or having a herd immunity plan that should have been the basis of the first lockdown...
1322935838884376579 2020-11-02 00:17:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WCphilosopher @RichardBurgon So why have Labour been calling for a lockdown and not calling for a meaningful strategy?
1322929838978641921 2020-11-01 23:53:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @noddynoo @RichardBurgon What about them?
1322913003554148352 2020-11-01 22:46:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon The Government does not have a Coronvirus strategy and neither does the Labour Party. Locking down because there are insufficient hospital beds to deal with the inevitable is not a strategy - it’s an unforgivable failure of the whole lot of you.
1322912520584179712 2020-11-01 22:44:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BimboLimboSpam @ProtectPubs @BulletRobinson @SWright1steve Maybe the Police could re-prioritise breaking up children’s birthday parties for dealing with anti-social behaviour.
1322906699443933185 2020-11-01 22:21:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Normal party politics aside, I can only hear backbench Tory MPs speaking out against the Government’s shambolic approach to Covid. Labour is complicit by failing to question the strategy and pushing lockdown.
1322904041744142337 2020-11-01 22:11:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mikerainham They have done!!  https://t.co/aVUjaYuaZc
1322903915575287808 2020-11-01 22:10:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> For Christmas businesses build capacity so we can handle the inevitable peak. Lockdown 2 is a cataclysmic failure of Govt to build sufficient hospital capacity for the inevitable peak. They know they can’t stop it, only manage it. They have fucked up royally and individuals pay.
1322901021442646027 2020-11-01 21:59:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @finland_uk @mattmakins @PubsSaving Yes, damage is already done and will just worsen. This is going on until the spring. An institutional failure and deriliction of duty of epic proportions not to build sufficient hospital capacity to deal with the inevitable. To blame and sacrifice businesses and individuals too.
1322894012207026177 2020-11-01 21:31:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mattmakins @finland_uk @PubsSaving Yes, it’s the of and with debate and the detail behind those deaths including age and underlying condition and what they were in hospital for. Time will tell us.
1322893081730027520 2020-11-01 21:27:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BulletRobinson @mattmakins @ProtectPubs @SWright1steve This is a pointless discussion unless you don’t wash your hands and that is completely within your control.
1322892527742103553 2020-11-01 21:25:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mattmakins @finland_uk @PubsSaving Vallance predicted 50k positive tests rising exponentially - it has steadied at about 25k but exponential would mean 300k by now. Admissions are higher than predicted but include people tested who are not in for Covid. Capacity is normal. No excess respiratory mortality.
1322890437066166273 2020-11-01 21:17:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BulletRobinson @mattmakins @ProtectPubs @SWright1steve Unless you lick the urinal, piss face to face with an infected person or don’t wash your hands I reckon the risk from going to a urinal is pretty low.
1322887608616321025 2020-11-01 21:05:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BulletRobinson @ProtectPubs @SWright1steve I quite often hear the opposite.
1322738785906548738 2020-11-01 11:14:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @allisonpearson @helenhims That is one of the points I don’t get: “to save Christmas”. Close down the country, wreck the health and wealth of millions so people can meet on Christmas Day!!  Before and after being restricted by their ridiculous socialisation rules. It’s a an absolutely preposterous notion.
1322719526878879744 2020-11-01 09:58:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer @BarnetLabour Lockdowns only delay Covid deaths, they don’t avoid them. Lockdowns also create additional deaths and misery for millions of people. Can I suggest, therefore, that you use the next 6 months to push the Govt to come up with a strategy to avoid lockdown. More NHS beds for example?
1322717851774582788 2020-11-01 09:51:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @darklordbarnet One of my favourite films!!
1322711013934964739 2020-11-01 09:24:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> What are the key indicators for ending the lockdown? Positive tests? Hospital capacity? Deaths? R rate? At what levels?  I have to say that I have little hope at the moment that pubs will open again in 2020. If not lockdown, we’ll probably mostly be in Tier 3.  https://t.co/ffBcxFT7kG
1322699864682209282 2020-11-01 08:39:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @andreajenkyns @robertsondcang1 No. He’s failed to communicate a reasonable and proportionate perspective of Covid, he’s failed to come up with a balanced strategy and he’s failed to build the NHS so we can avoid locking down again. The whole lot of you should either sort it out or all go at the same time.
1322698802961285122 2020-11-01 08:35:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan @emilyhewertson What about you lot get your act together, get a proper strategy and not least build capacity for the NHS so we don’t need to lockdown. Delay &amp; Increase Deaths - Bankrupt Business - Underfund the NHS.
1322697136149061633 2020-11-01 08:29:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jessphillips @destinyschild05 There’s no plan. They are stumbling in the dark killing and bankrupting the nation and the Labour Party is supporting them.
1322692723112136705 2020-11-01 08:11:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DonnyBrewery @FairDeal4Locals They were only open for key worker kids and it was not many.
1322688933667475461 2020-11-01 07:56:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DonnyBrewery @FairDeal4Locals I think maybe they have realised that education was “importanter” to Covid spread than they thought - and that they should have kept it open during lockdown 1.
1322685413224493057 2020-11-01 07:42:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DonnyBrewery @FairDeal4Locals Covid loves alcohol in pubs. It does not, however, like it in supermarkets. Chris Whitty has a slide to prove it.
1322679975556861952 2020-11-01 07:20:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mrdudder @greeneking @CampaignforPubs It’s a big load off the mind of a 1000 or so Publicans. They have responded well recently and they must be under pressure themselves.
1322678904734339072 2020-11-01 07:16:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Have to give thanks to @greeneking who have already confirmed a 90% rent reduction for all their tenanted pubs in England for the whole month of the lockdown. @CampaignforPubs
1322677598162485248 2020-11-01 07:11:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Wallstreetlanz High Street retail closed too. People confined to their homes apart from education and work. They clearly want to spread it amongst the younger population but they don’t want to say to elders to stay at home because that would mean admitting they were wrong first time around.
1322674833021349893 2020-11-01 07:00:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyMPowell Pubs are not allowed to serve takeaway alcohol. Where has that come from and how does it assist with the control of Covid. That takeaway service which was allowed before was a lifeline, albeit small, for many pubs. Helps reduce stock losses too.
1322671933800984578 2020-11-01 06:48:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BenGoldsmith How they could have done it differently took - (1) communicated a strategy that involves the expansion of hospital capacity, (2) agreed to fully address questions about the PCR tests, data and the science more generally; (3) a review of all restrictions before 4 December.  https://t.co/XxVoeSI5O5
1322669358531801088 2020-11-01 06:38:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UK_4_Democracy He mumbled nervously@when he started telling us we were restricted - says to me he knows this is not going down well.
1322667900466089985 2020-11-01 06:32:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson Such a twit that you think anyone is going to take a blind bit of notice. You have lost all credibility.
1322667415927459840 2020-11-01 06:31:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Very funny tweet!!
1322665381505486848 2020-11-01 06:22:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @charliegilkes @BorisJohnson I fear none of us will be open again in 2021 unless there is a dramatic shift in policy that hasn’t happened since March. At best, we’ll all be in tier 3.
1322663929705844737 2020-11-01 06:17:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amandamilling No, by getting your finger out and building the NHS to cope you won’t have to close down the economy, risk people’s lives and limit our freedoms. The Conservatives have cocked this up royally and it needs fixing.
1322660633641443329 2020-11-01 06:04:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> And to add insult to injury we are allowed to do takeaway, but not of alcohol? Why???? How does this affect Covid??? Massive stock losses if we cannot sell it?  https://t.co/Lua5zmsfgi
1322659514290765826 2020-11-01 05:59:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Will_Norris @Conservatives @BorisJohnson Not my fucken problem, the same as my business going bankrupt isn’t their fucken problem. Only difference being my business pays for the NHS.
1322655855020593152 2020-11-01 05:45:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> So basically hospitality and retail are forced to close because @Conservatives @BorisJohnson cannot organise an increase in hospital capacity. They ought to start getting their finger out.  https://t.co/ehA8AIBwhk
1322652642540216321 2020-11-01 05:32:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IanJ21289455 Unless there is a shift in policy then I doubt it will only be 4 weeks.
1322617325753978884 2020-11-01 03:11:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> HAPPY FECKIN CHRISTMAS  Forced closure for a month then a return to crippling restrictions for December that won’t allow us to break even. Then maybe more lockdown in the New Year.   I’ve not earned anything since March and staff get only 67% of their pay. Piss poor Govt.  https://t.co/1ULMy4O2hV
1322590558330720257 2020-11-01 01:25:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Live now...  https://t.co/bRywiUzTsl
1322588182903488512 2020-11-01 01:16:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tobyperkinsmp @ChrisMasonBBC @Keir_Starmer Do you have a detailed analysis and reliable data on that and the worst case projections for deaths and destruction of lockdown?  Plus what the strategy is moving forward?
1322584463126179842 2020-11-01 01:01:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AndrewGillies9 @tobyperkinsmp @ChrisMasonBBC @Keir_Starmer Yes, I’m politically lost again too. None of them properly want to solve or change anything.
1322580111129010176 2020-11-01 00:44:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tobyperkinsmp @ChrisMasonBBC @Keir_Starmer Labour will not be thanked for pushing another lockdown, particularly with no consideration of the deaths and destruction that will cause and in the absence of a strategy and reliable data.
1322572830094069761 2020-11-01 00:15:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @inalexworld I’d rather see a credible strategy that takes account of death and damage caused by lockdowns. That might even be to close down for a while but with suitable remuneration for those, like me, who are paying for it and a commitment to build NHS capacity. “Left-wing” not my words.
1322570653388677121 2020-11-01 00:06:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IanDunt @SamEspensen The real morality gap is denial of what we are dealing with and especially ignoring the impact on lives and livelihoods of lockdowns and restrictions.
1322568637736230913 2020-10-31 23:58:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I have to say that I agree with him.
1322564971696410625 2020-10-31 23:43:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BethRigby @Keir_Starmer I don’t think that Labour will be thanked for pushing a lockdown that causes as much or maybe more death and destruction. Particularly when there is no strategy and huge holes in the data and reasoning.
1322550570977234946 2020-10-31 22:46:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavidGauke You completely misrepresent the opposing view.  People are calling for a more balanced approach between the death by Covid versus death and destruction by restrictions.
1322547375681003522 2020-10-31 22:34:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OwenJones84 Or we could just face up to reality and build an NHS that can cope.
1322543613142859776 2020-10-31 22:19:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan I think it delayed some deaths and caused others. It cost the country very dearly, money that could have been better spent building the NHS to deal with the ongoing nature of the virus.
1322539691837739008 2020-10-31 22:03:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan The Govt won’t even legislate for commercial rent reviews/breaks - we have a voluntary rent code that is useless. We get inadequate grants and we have to use them to pay the rent for premises that we cannot trade. Lockdown without full compensation shouldn’t be an option.
1322524367167889411 2020-10-31 21:02:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Save Christmas - Protect the NHS - Fuck Business &amp; Liberty
1322512797318684673 2020-10-31 20:16:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The failure is a realistic and honest strategy for dealing with Covid and building sufficient capacity in the NHS to deal with a winter peak. Both lie firmly at the Government’s door.
1322512161000902657 2020-10-31 20:14:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tamalyn1 @LukeJohnsonRCP I have a great covered outdoor space and I fill it, but it is simply not enough to turn a profit on its own, my rent and other overheads are too great - and I cannot use it if we are closed down again. To increase food would require a massive investment. Takeaway is peanuts.
1322500332459610112 2020-10-31 19:27:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @tamalyn1 @LukeJohnsonRCP How can 10s of thousands of publicans diversify their closed pubs which generate huge property overheads.
1322396661184897024 2020-10-31 12:35:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford What I cannot shake from my head is all the lives that have been and will continue to be lost and ruined by restrictions and lockdowns. How the hell the NHS cannot cope with this lesser peak I will never know.  https://t.co/vJnZv6Cnas
1322357806369034249 2020-10-31 10:00:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I do not get what “saving Christmas” looks like...still social distancing, still rule of six, still multiple households only outdoors, still closing at 10pm, still no events, still in masks....and then what....closed again in Jan/Feb/March...this plan does not work for business..
1322350882374254593 2020-10-31 09:33:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @emilyhewertson I can’t have no trade in my pub for a month. I’ve had no income since March, I’ve been paying to keep my business afloat since the curfew. A month closed, then back to loss making restrictions. The impact on business is important too.  I employ ppl and pay lots of tax for the NHS
1322323866002313216 2020-10-31 07:45:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyMPowell It’s not inevitable. It’s madness. Govt’s job is to protect citizens: rational assessment and communication of the risks and appropriate mitigation. Ergo, protect the vulnerable and ensure an appropriate level of medical facilities.  It does not mean oppression of the masses.
1322319412142157830 2020-10-31 07:28:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OwenJones84 The old support package gave staff only 80% and business owners like me nothing. Indeed, I’ve had no income since March and have been paying for my business to open since the curfew was introduced. Everyone needs to share the pain - give up 50% of their income. Silence I bet.
1322307606657060866 2020-10-31 06:41:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Talk of another lockdown to “save Christmas” is absolutely sickening to me and other businesses. I’ve had no income since March and I’ve been paying for my business to stay open since the curfew. How does another lockdown save my Christmas? We need a full review, not a lockdown.  https://t.co/SGx603NjBj
1322287469073702913 2020-10-31 05:21:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ThePubChampion I’ve just been told that we’ve had our second Police visit in a week....
1322283592312127494 2020-10-31 05:05:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ThePubChampion Lol, I’d better check in case the Police see this, ha, ha!!
1322282176336039938 2020-10-31 05:00:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I told one of my customers who walked in with a banana in his hand that bananas were not allowed in Tier 2. He actually believed me for a moment.
1322275996935049222 2020-10-31 04:35:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LukeJohnsonRCP I’ve had no income since March. I’m now using my reserves to keep my business open in tier 2.
1322275605098962949 2020-10-31 04:34:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon No, we need a root and branch review of the science and strategy. The country cannot keep getting restricted and closed down.
1322210872413081600 2020-10-31 00:16:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I think that we should concentrate on saving the country and not saving Christmas.
1322158404434014210 2020-10-30 20:48:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MerlinFDC4 Unless we start ramping up staffing and stock now we won’t be able to cope with any relaxation of restrictions in any case.
1322145682363420673 2020-10-30 19:57:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson This is what I originally referenced. Just a pic of a tweet that relates to respiratory hospital admissions. It is directly relevant to the point the Dr raises which is that, at 10% Covid bed occupancy, she feels that the NHS will become overwhelmed.  https://t.co/JPnTsTKnAT
1321973548450197504 2020-10-30 08:33:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Govt science predicts huge risk to life; other eminent scientists predict a seasonal upturn. Govt gives us fear and restrictions, no definitive answers, no timescale. Majority of public appears to be fearful. There’s no alternative but to let time do it’s job.
1321967953760452608 2020-10-30 08:11:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ZymurgyZo @BBCNews Lol, you can catch it anywhere people breath.
1321967572053622784 2020-10-30 08:10:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson No, the original tweet referenced a chart showing respiratory admissions below the average for this time of year. That is the point - an uptake in admissions and deaths in itself is not necessarily of concern without the context of the usual position at this time of year.
1321948998350131206 2020-10-30 06:56:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson I’m not going to make an assumption. Indeed, if you go back to my original tweet I asked the Dr presenting her bleak analysis why it was at odds. In a respiratory pandemic then it would be logical to see respiratory admissions at a high and excess deaths.
1321943313751199744 2020-10-30 06:33:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson I haven’t seen any evidence of your presumption that reduced pollution and exposure has reduced asthma and bronchitis. Yes, peaks above the average as the ONS paper shows is a regular occurrence over the decades it covers.
1321939402738774017 2020-10-30 06:18:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson I do not have an alternative explanation as I haven’t seen evidence to support one. Excess deaths are simply deaths above average at a given point. It is quite common especially with flu in winter. Here’s 2017/18.  https://t.co/cPvkCr7FhM
1321922812257460230 2020-10-30 05:12:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson Your “presumably” is my concern. It is quite common for there to be winter season excess deaths and there is nothing uncommon in the figures as yet.
1321874338283401216 2020-10-30 01:59:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson Do you have a source for this info or are you just making it up?
1321868529042444290 2020-10-30 01:36:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doctor_oxford @BorisJohnson How does this bleak picture align with below average respiratory admissions and no excess deaths? Is 10% Covid bed occupancy a disaster justifying destruction of the economy and other health problems? I genuinely ask as I continually see irreconcilable conflicting information.  https://t.co/DJ8o3bVufp
1321846732834152449 2020-10-30 00:09:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I do not understand how the consumption of alcohol in heavily regulated hospitality settings has become such a key issue in the control of Covid. In these Scottish restrictions, most wet pubs would only stand a chance of making a profit in level 0. Bankruptcy likely from level 2.  https://t.co/nnQMpwoRUg
1321815521185140737 2020-10-29 22:05:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @O_edipus @ehlhoehl @OwenJones84 You need to calm down by reading historical ONS reports on excess deaths caused by flu.
1321811890855727107 2020-10-29 21:51:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Possibly the difference between whether containment or controlled spread is the appropriate course of action. European countries now seem to be focussed on keeping schools open, as Sweden did, which suggests the strategy is controlled spread.
1321807916987523072 2020-10-29 21:35:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RealCarlVernon Might be due to schools having been closed during the first lockdown. Germany and France keeping schools open. U.K. determined to do likewise. Sweden kept schools open. Schools known to be key to spread of flu and colds. Key to building immunity?
1321806121330450432 2020-10-29 21:28:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SuzanneEvans1 Germany and France keeping schools open in their new lockdowns. U.K. is determined to keep schools open. Sweden kept schools open. Schools are known to be spreaders of colds and flu. Suggests to me that they have realised that we should have kept schools open to build immunity.
1321799168617287681 2020-10-29 21:00:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO @richardm56 @Rushcliffe So they nip out the pub to get their beer before 9pm. Not genius.
1321618142561476609 2020-10-29 09:01:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ehlhoehl @OwenJones84 I think your “clearly different” is what is at issue because you appear, like Owen Jones, to make platitudes based on media coverage. I am simply asking if you had bothered to look at the data.
1321612225904283648 2020-10-29 08:38:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ehlhoehl @OwenJones84 It was just illustrative. Goes back to my question about the need to consider the current situation with that of previous years. That’s why I was asking for the source of your info, but you seemed to think there’s never been any winter pressures on hospitals.
1321605280141115393 2020-10-29 08:10:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ehlhoehl @OwenJones84 You “can’t be bothered” and “common sense”, really. Here’s an article I found on Google in less than 10 seconds. It’s  from 2018. Hospitals struggling with flu.  https://t.co/rDmwXMZgfx
1321598433166348289 2020-10-29 07:43:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ehlhoehl @OwenJones84 You got a source for that info?
1321593474446143488 2020-10-29 07:23:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OwenJones84 How does this situation compare to historic flu seasons. I don’t expect you to answer.
1321562197630296065 2020-10-29 05:19:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan So will you withdraw your support for lockdown if the Government does not fully support the businesses and individuals involved? Why should I lose 150% of my income and others get full pay?
1321561092141797380 2020-10-29 05:14:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Good luck to Scottish hospitality on the legal challenge to the  restrictions and lack of adequate financial support in Scotland. I’ve said many times that any restrictions for the public good should be justified and fully compensated. It is not acceptable to bankrupt individuals
1321490795837489152 2020-10-29 00:35:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OwenJones84 Do you not ever question the detail of these raw numbers and looking at them in raw isolation to the wider picture of the death and destruction of lockdown deaths and destruction?
1321482872407183367 2020-10-29 00:04:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mrjamesob I don’t condone violence, but it is a bit naive to confront strangers for a requirement that at best has marginal evidence and is not being universally enforced.
1321468969417613314 2020-10-28 23:08:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman Now this made me laugh!!
1321466900568789024 2020-10-28 23:00:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 @afneil To deal with it strategically is important. To possibly kill more people and wreck more lives by managing it piecemeal is foolish.  Let’s end it there.
1321463885115830273 2020-10-28 22:48:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 @afneil Experts are limited by their field and often by the the positions they have taken historically. It is a country that is being managed - not just Covid. I don’t understand your reluctance to involve a wider pool of expertise and learning.
1321461694615506944 2020-10-28 22:39:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 @afneil Let a full scientific review, preferably one not undertaken solely by those who have made the forecasts and decisions hitherto, decide whether it’s “worse” and what the best strategy is. Let’s not manage it by anecdote.
1321459682314276866 2020-10-28 22:31:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Hardworking business people all over the country carrying the can for restrictions which are supposed to be for the public good. @Conservatives you are a disgrace and you will never be forgiven.
1321456651996639244 2020-10-28 22:19:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 @afneil “No” to a review, then you admit there have been changes since the outset. IFR much lower, treatments changed, vulnerable population clearer, stats known to be incorrect, tests known to be unreliable, different strategies used throughout the world.
1321442611538862081 2020-10-28 21:24:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 @afneil What we need, in my opinion, is a complete review of the science and strategy. This is not the virus it was thought to be when this all started.
1321428718833848320 2020-10-28 20:28:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @STVNews A pic of the SNP Cabinet discussing the issue.  https://t.co/gZlHbPzpSO

1321425419745267718 2020-10-28 20:15:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Pubs not allowed to serve alcohol.  Why not petrol stations not allowed to sell fuel, book shops not able to sell books, butchers not able to sell meat, garden centres not able to sell plants, phone shops not able to sell phones...
1321419649628733441 2020-10-28 19:52:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 @afneil They now have large gatherings.
1321265143137800193 2020-10-28 09:38:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amrit_lohia @RichardBurgon We need a thorough review of all the evidence. This article says a third of people are not fully well after 3 weeks. That is not not long for recovery from any illness including flu or even a cold. It does not state what percentage of people have long term serious problems.
1321241229024202761 2020-10-28 08:03:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amrit_lohia @RichardBurgon The infection rate is not higher. At the peak, only those admitted to hospital were tested - that was estimated to be only 5% of those infected, so 100,000 a day were getting it. Deaths were much higher. Long Covid is not evidenced in a significant percentage. Need a review.
1321229410138284036 2020-10-28 07:16:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amrit_lohia @RichardBurgon On the contrary it is imbecilic not to review our knowledge and where we are now which is vastly different to where we were in March.
1321207300191887360 2020-10-28 05:49:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @geoffreysmeddle You can’t buy a toaster, a book or socks in Wales. There is no sense. There is no negotiation with these imbeciles. It’s legal challenge or riot time - or just roll over and follow the rules.
1321206590188539904 2020-10-28 05:46:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TelBabe @CTSIan That study by Imperial College doesn’t show the whole story. The only thing it really says is something is rotten at the core of that establishment.
1321206144656904198 2020-10-28 05:44:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Van Morrison equally fed up with the political response to Covid.
1321188202796011524 2020-10-28 04:33:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amandanewb We’re on the same side Amanda. I just now feel that offering anything in exchange for an appallingly baseless and counter-productive decision should not happen. Our line needs to be to insist upon evidence of what the problem is and we can make proposals to resolve it.
1321185544110485505 2020-10-28 04:22:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amandanewb We have all did and continue to do the Covid safety thing.  But still they enforced the arbitrary curfew and they have presented no evidence. They have been unreasonable and I wouldn’t offer anything more as they are crippling us unnecessarily. They just need to drop the curfew.
1321183469368651776 2020-10-28 04:14:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amandanewb Isn’t that just restoring the position to the Licensing Act 2003?
1321178578961240068 2020-10-28 03:54:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amandanewb What is “targeted site specific dispersal policies”?
1321178014693117952 2020-10-28 03:52:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps Any fool can see the madness - now Scotland allowing pubs to re-open but not to sell alcohol.  We need to push for a fundamental review involving those without a vested interest in the decisions made hitherto.
1321176133711372289 2020-10-28 03:45:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisHillidge @justintime991 @LucyMPowell Thanks, that’s great. I have no idea why you joined this conversation and what your substantive point was.
1321174214804733955 2020-10-28 03:37:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisHillidge @justintime991 @LucyMPowell Not an issue of any relevance to our discussion. I was a Civil Servant in Whitehall for 21 years and I know a lot about public policy appraisal and development and managing and balancing expert advice.  I suggest that you should just keep watching BBC and wait for the all clear.
1321169861503033346 2020-10-28 03:20:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisHillidge @justintime991 @LucyMPowell You’ve clearly not spent time researching because you do not grasp the extent of the scientific debate. That’s your choice. I prefer listening to a wider perspective and would sooner see a holistic approach - virus danger versus restriction/lockdown danger - from politicians.
1321169136458833920 2020-10-28 03:17:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amrit_lohia @RichardBurgon And not fully appraising the “cure” of lockdown and restrictions is in line with the cautionary approach. You are as blinkered as those in charge. Need a holistic approach.
1321166504482775047 2020-10-28 03:06:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisHillidge @justintime991 @LucyMPowell Read his scientific analyses and those he posts from others. Or just wallow in your own narrow ignorance. Your choice.
1321161699496464388 2020-10-28 02:47:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisHillidge @justintime991 @LucyMPowell So Carl Heneghan just “sounds sciency”?
1321159359435546626 2020-10-28 02:38:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amrit_lohia @RichardBurgon That’s not substantive and overwhelming evidence that justifies the destruction and death being caused by lockdowns and restrictions. Flu has ongoing impacts. Being on a ventilator has ongoing impacts. Drugs have ongoing impacts. Need a full review that gives perspective.
1321158664099631112 2020-10-28 02:35:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @FMF23 @OwenJones84 Start with a full review in light of a vastly different virus than that which scientists though it was back in January and hugely damaging restrictions with a death toll too. Involve a wider range of experts that do not have a vested interest in decisions made hitherto.
1321157237818167297 2020-10-28 02:30:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amrit_lohia @RichardBurgon No, just bored of non-evidenced  scare stories. We need a full review taking real evidence from a variety of sources.
1321155717114580992 2020-10-28 02:24:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheGunnersPub @piersmorgan @carlheneghan Reasonably well given all the limitations of tier 2. The good people of Barnet seem not to want to be confined to their homes.
1321155330231906304 2020-10-28 02:22:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amrit_lohia @RichardBurgon Yawn.
1321154278728359943 2020-10-28 02:18:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Mate, you need a chill pill. Look at different sources and analysis of the data and scientific perceptions. @carlheneghan is a good place to start.
1321152450628341760 2020-10-28 02:11:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OwenJones84 If only it were so simplistic. But you seem happy you’ve solved it.
1321144821311000576 2020-10-28 01:40:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LicensingLaws There is no point to even attempting constructive engagement with any of the UK Governments or even the main opposition parties any more. Legal challenge, promoting the alternative science/strategy and hoping that public opinion changes are the only options.
1321143846378655744 2020-10-28 01:36:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon By promoting these misleading headline figures and advocating lockdowns you are not offering real opposition. We need a fundamental review of everything based upon what is now known about the virus, who it harms, the data errors and the damage caused by a lockdown strategy.
1321141481919401984 2020-10-28 01:27:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @craigcmillar I feel for you in Scotland, but I have little confidence that the same won’t happen in England. There is no political opposition to the decimation that is taking place.
1321141011498893314 2020-10-28 01:25:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IanJ21289455 It’s mind boggling what propaganda has done. And no political opposition. I feel nervous about what is going on almost worldwide. I don’t have any fear of the virus.
1321131330504171521 2020-10-28 00:47:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Best not to get too worried Piers. It’s one day and it tends to look different when the analysis is shown by date of death and there is categorisation of the people dying by age and other factors. A fully informed approach is the best approach.
1321126383490375680 2020-10-28 00:27:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SLTAssociation @SBPA @UKHofficial @wearethentia @HospUlster @VFIpubs @DonaldCMacleod @SLLPOnline It’s pointless now. They are not listening. There is no effective political opposition either in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK. Legal challenge or taking to the streets is the only way now.
1321123890643537920 2020-10-28 00:17:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @justintime991 @LucyMPowell It’s not that straightforward. There is differing scientific and medical opinion. The balance between the danger of the virus and the danger of restrictions is very fine. People die from the virus and people die from restrictions. There needs to be a fundamental review of it all.
1321113942014439429 2020-10-27 23:38:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyMPowell I respect you are trying to make light, but a growing number of people - those who want their liberties and livelihoods back and treatment for other conditions or just to see their GP - don’t find any of this remotely funny anymore and we want it sorted out. This is a fire.
1321111549822619648 2020-10-27 23:28:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR @Essex_CC They will probably spend it on silly safety signs - this is Barnet Council’s Covid safety measures. Like we didn’t know stepping on the road can be dangerous.  https://t.co/rK0GYj9IeQ
1321110877739884546 2020-10-27 23:25:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon And you would be locking us down right now if you were in charge. You need to be challenging the imbecilic handling of Covid and calling for a fundamental review of the science, the strategy and the ridiculous restrictions. Right now you have zero credibility.
1321110300003807233 2020-10-27 23:23:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBradley_Mans Are you so stupid to realise that the public are not warming to you spending inordinate time trying to justify not giving poor kids food and to justify your own remuneration package whilst your Government is wrecking the country with ridiculous restrictions and gross incompetence
1321109025115787265 2020-10-27 23:18:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 We must also not forget our great opposition who would have England locked down right now if they were in power. All a bunch of unrepresentative and corrupt imbeciles. We need fundamental change.
1321101872174911488 2020-10-27 22:50:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’m usually moderate, but it’s time now to tell Govt to f@ck off. Bans on meeting people, never ending two week lockdowns, restricting what we buy, making us close at 10pm, cancelling Christmas, a mask to go to the toilet, whilst they ignore certain science and f@ck up everything
1321067793513652224 2020-10-27 20:34:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ShabaNabi @Telegraph @DailyMailUK @jkaffash @NikkiKF @rvautrey @doctor_katie @dr_zo It is regretfully a response to the approach being adopted to “protect the NHS” at all costs to life and liberty. Doctors refusing to see people is never going to be a popular strategy. Same with police being tasked with enforcing mask and other rules. I don’t support any of it.
1321063252785246208 2020-10-27 20:16:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CromwellStuff @MattHancock I think that’s good news as about half the voting population in this country is clearly hysterical - the other half won’t get tested so numbers should come down unless the 28 million get tested again and again.
1320749183083651074 2020-10-26 23:28:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> When will these twits that supposedly lead us realise that they will perpetually end up in a bureaucratic mess if they continue to interfere in our lives to this degree. Tell us the risks, let us get on with it and go and do what  Govt should be doing like improving the NHS.
1320708726882476032 2020-10-26 20:47:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @eaglealehouse @pubscodepca @CampaignforPubs Dave - here’s the pre-amble and we’ve adjusted the declarations to cover the point you raise.  https://t.co/WK6mtvztQN
1320465593288581121 2020-10-26 04:41:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Great turnout for our first ever outdoor tier 2 pub quiz!!  https://t.co/umKztbdZTc
1320411208277700609 2020-10-26 01:05:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate There is differing views from scientists and a whole lot of collateral damage by the current strategy of perpetual restrictions and lockdowns. In my opinion everyone should be pushing for a fundamental review of the management (or mis-management) of the threat of the virus.
1320349578357592065 2020-10-25 21:00:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnitaJe43897946 Not sure. 10pm is a good time to go thieving though...

1320275664512126976 2020-10-25 16:07:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> A van load of Police arrives at my pub in sleepy High Barnet at 10pm last night. Everyone already out bar a bunch of tiddly 60 something woman sheltering from a torrential downpour at the doorway and one old gentleman having a wee. “Having trouble getting them out” I’m asked.
1320273524368527360 2020-10-25 15:58:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LeahButlerSmith It’s not idiot- businesses, we have got to comply or we will be shut down. We are as unhappy about all of this as the next person.
1319923288664100869 2020-10-24 16:46:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jeffreyjohnbell @pubscodepca @CampaignforPubs I have sufficient funds allocated to the risk I am prepared to take for both.
1319921377504350208 2020-10-24 16:39:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @eaglealehouse @pubscodepca @CampaignforPubs I get what you are saying Dave. That is elsewhere.
1319790316166254598 2020-10-24 07:58:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @katman_999 Cheers Dave. It’s all sorted with my lawyers into manageable chunks. The PCA may come up with something outstanding that proves us wrong before we get to Court - but at least we’ll have the answers. We’ll win if it goes to Court on their current position.
1319782877463257089 2020-10-24 07:28:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Yes, not cheap and I’ve had to think very carefully as a result of Covid. But the PCA refuses to engage and we have little option but to put before a Court. I cannot let it go so I’ve ring-fenced sufficient funds to take it forward.
1319777492241162241 2020-10-24 07:07:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBradley_Mans @MarcusRashford I’d stop this now. You can’t win on this issue.
1319630574206799877 2020-10-23 21:23:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @crookedmeadows @DonaldCMacleod @scotgov @wearethentia @Iromg @slta @UKHofficial If it’s not deemed safe for the public good then the public good needs to fully compensate the nightclub or bar. It’s not acceptable to let them go bankrupt.
1319630144307384323 2020-10-23 21:21:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is truly disgraceful. Nightclubs and late bars and indeed any business that is closed through state intervention like this for the public good should be fully compensated.
1319629780615036928 2020-10-23 21:20:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> My barrister has drafted the Declarations that we are going to put before a Court to seek to resolve the long disputed interpretation of the Pubs Code with @pubscodepca . Watch this space. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/pnZuwZzSRP
1319604589382029313 2020-10-23 19:40:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> An expert opinion on Sturgeon’s strategy which, by all accounts, seems disproportionate. When will politicians get it?
1319414348171849728 2020-10-23 07:04:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman @AnthonyLDN2 @Jocoxbrown The travesty here is that the Govt has not intervened on commercial rents.
1319413173062172672 2020-10-23 06:59:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman @AnthonyLDN2 @Jocoxbrown Yes, there becomes a point where it’s cheaper to close even whilst still paying rent.
1319406179991302144 2020-10-23 06:32:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @nloveactually @KareemNaaman Except that most people who go to wet led pubs don’t want to eat.
1319398051019169793 2020-10-23 05:59:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnthonyLDN2 @Jocoxbrown Thanks. It’s very rough. We’ve been restricted way beyond viability.
1319395357512577024 2020-10-23 05:49:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan “Shield the old and vulnerable” who want to be shielded. This lady clearly wants to return to seeing her family. We need to be treated like adults, not children.

1319392331943022592 2020-10-23 05:36:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps @Jocoxbrown Yes.
1319391933085765632 2020-10-23 05:35:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnthonyLDN2 @Jocoxbrown Recovered to 80% on re-opening. Curfew cut my hours by 23% and my takings by a further 25%. So I now operate on 55% of my normal trade which is well below break even. The tier 2 household rule is having a further impact. Table service is unmanageable on affordable resources.
1319281455868989447 2020-10-22 22:16:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Well done Scottish hospitality bodies in raising a legal challenge against restrictions #. It’s success has the potential to save more than just hospitality.
1319274715802841099 2020-10-22 21:49:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AgentP22 Nothing is funny. She and her laccies are vile and inept authoritarians who have not justified or reasoned their hysteria.
1319274121411268610 2020-10-22 21:47:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IanMurrayMP @robertsondcang1 Well said. I’ve had no income since March; I’ve been paying for the pub to open since the curfew; the money announced today won’t touch the sides; I have no idea of the Government’s strategy or reasoning for anything; and it is clear that all their data and systems are inept.
1319273416772337664 2020-10-22 21:44:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @beehivedroy @LeicsCAMRA_SC @RogerProtzBeer @AbbeydaleBeers @BBCNews I think the point is somewhat missed that people who go to wet led pubs don’t want to eat - they want a drink.
1319267083222278144 2020-10-22 21:19:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jocoxbrown Any little helps, but I doubt that it will save many. A £few hundred a week regrettably does not make up for £several thousands lost each week. I’ve earned nothing since March, been paying to keep the business open since curfew - no end in sight.
1319265771143467011 2020-10-22 21:14:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KirstieMAllsopp The pandemic would end tomorrow.
1319248950109622273 2020-10-22 20:07:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LicensingLaws @TLT_LLP @TLT_LicensingEW Is that the same TLT who act for Greene King? They misrepresented the position on the Pubs Code to me, the Pubs Code Adjudicator and probably other tenants to preserve the tied lease interests of their large corporate interests. They are crooked.
1319227955718049792 2020-10-22 18:43:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We send thousands of young people to live in Manchester together for university, they catch it, isolate and it goes away. Govt response to create a whole new tier system that destroys hospitality and restricts the whole population of the city. Madness.  https://t.co/qsBZ3dl0s1
1319179077601939456 2020-10-22 15:29:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyMPowell @AndyBurnhamGM After 7 months of business destruction and with no end in sight, loans are just delaying the inevitable. Furlough is pointless if there is no viable business left. We really need a fundamental review.
1319078110512513024 2020-10-22 08:48:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LordAshcroft Labour’s call for a lockdown.
1319077371023134720 2020-10-22 08:45:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBradley_Mans We don’t have a Govt that does any of that.
1319076517889118210 2020-10-22 08:42:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DrRosena @destinyschild05 And Labour’s solution is another devastating lockdown. Absolutely clueless.
1319063453223538689 2020-10-22 07:50:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SLTAssociation @Scotbeerandpub @UKHofficial @SLLPOnline @st_alliance @CKPLoudon Your Govt today announced today that tier 1 will be an “aspirational” level of restriction. In other words, Scotland will be under restrictions indefinitely. That is huge.
1319062884538847234 2020-10-22 07:47:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Sturgeon’s tier 1 is going to be an “aspirational” level of restrictions. No normality, AN ASPIRATION to continue to be restricted indefinitely.  People in Scotland need to think about this very carefully. People in England need to think about why our Govt is silent on this.
1319062048370720773 2020-10-22 07:44:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @theSNP @NicolaSturgeon What she is saying is that the “aspiration” for Scotland is continued restriction. That is huge. Scotland needs to carefully consider whether it is happy to accept that.
1319045866787831810 2020-10-22 06:40:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Closed for 18 weeks; re-opened with 40+ pages of rules; limited capacity, no events; banned from using bar; masks introduced; 10pm curfew; limits on households; banning of households tier 2; closed tier 3. Seven months of business destruction - no end in sight. @CampaignforPubs
1319030026097119232 2020-10-22 05:37:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer @NHSCOVID19app I’m not arguing with you. I just say we should no longer co-operate with their incompetence.
1318914828212338689 2020-10-21 21:59:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer @NHSCOVID19app A lot more has gone wrong than just track and trace and the app. What is happening now is completely disproportionate to the virus.

1318892490859204608 2020-10-21 20:30:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LucyMPowell Whilst you all play politics, the public are getting angrier and angrier. Labour needs to lead an alternative “live with it” strategy. There is an absolute urgency.
1318884511711744000 2020-10-21 19:59:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> No surprise that Nicola Sturgeon has extended restrictions in Scotland. Restriction creep throughout the UK is the order of the day to the point that we are all now restricted to the point that we are not viable. Support is either non-existent or wholly inadequate. Sacrificed.
1318883497424158722 2020-10-21 19:55:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SirQuinno @oldmudgie The cost and operating model for a busy British drinking pub is not compatible with table service. The combination of revenue reducing restrictions and table service in pubs is disastrous for our pub drinking culture.
1318882045326741504 2020-10-21 19:49:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mattjtemp I got a reply but it basically said nothing.
1318881858734665728 2020-10-21 19:48:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Nick_Pye Jacinda Adhern also using that phrase. Very creepy. Wtf does it mean?
1318881166032850944 2020-10-21 19:45:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> All Conservative MPs are at risk as a result of the incompetent management of Covid and the wrecking of lives and the economy. Keir Starmer made a big mistake calling for a nationwide lockdown, but Andy Burnham has saved it a little. Need now for a pragmatic approach to Covid.
1318868798934552581 2020-10-21 18:56:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SimonClarkeMP The whole approach to Covid is naked politics. The fear, the dodgy stats, the centralised risk assessment and measures, ignoring certain issues, the destruction of certain sectors. The public are exasperated. The Government really ought to be changing course before it explodes.
1318867136106954753 2020-10-21 18:50:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Is every politician and public body in the country trying to discredit themselves? Asking for address  “papers” for going into a pub is farcical. A publican’s job is to publicise, inform and facilitate - it is a citizen’s decision whether to comply.
1318693241164828673 2020-10-21 07:19:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Khan now calling for the curfew to be ended. Politicians from all sides need to know how precarious their positions are. People are angry and fed up like never before in my lifetime: politicians need now to disappear with their restrictions and leave us to use common sense.  https://t.co/PuTTBYLEgo
1318687680117592065 2020-10-21 06:56:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Gary_Usher_Cook We all feel like this. Strong profitable businesses that have contributed much to the exchequer restricted to oblivion and abandoned by the Government.
1318687062388887553 2020-10-21 06:54:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AndyBurnhamGM Well done.
1318572435814469632 2020-10-20 23:19:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RobertJenrick Andy Burnham has (1) confirmed that the local view of hospital capacity and what’s best to stop the virus do not necessarily match Whitehall’s view of the risk; (2) confirmed that lockdown does not come cheap, individuals should not lose out. You need to do the right thing.
1318539769584979974 2020-10-20 21:09:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> How to wind-up the afternoon drinking crew. I told them that I think we should have a vote on whether we lockdown again or not and, if it is yes, everyone loses half of their income, whether wages or pension, to pay for it. 😂😂😂
1318507542939578371 2020-10-20 19:01:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @paullewismoney @dthroat I laughed! Have to say that the average age of my customers - which is in the more senior level - has not gone down so they obviously feel safe and want to get out and see people.
1318505023479926785 2020-10-20 18:51:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This hits the nail on the head. Who are we protecting? Elders and those in hospital who can’t go out or see friends and family? Those who can’t see their GP or access hospital care? Those who are losing their livelihoods? Everyone who will suffer from recession?
1318477840761950210 2020-10-20 17:03:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Manchester infections going down and Manchester ICU usage normal. I don’t get it.  https://t.co/Zb9LitEnwv

1318208976111226881 2020-10-19 23:14:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I find it hard to grasp the level of concern and the strategy based upon the data and justification we’re being shown. It’s also odd that some of the big questions, on the accuracy of the tests for example, are not fully addressed. I’m honestly completely bemused.
1318198842882445315 2020-10-19 22:34:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan You pre-suppose they all want to “shield”.  The issue here is about restoring common sense and enabling people to have more choice with full knowledge of their particular risk.
1318182758489989120 2020-10-19 21:30:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Channel4 The virus has not killed anyone who comes to my pub to spend money. The restrictions have stopped people coming, increased my costs and generally made it impossible for me to run a profit.
1318181976835227648 2020-10-19 21:27:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oldmudgie Yes. Completely off their rockers. Where does it end?
1318180912375484417 2020-10-19 21:23:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oldmudgie It’s incredibly odd. Indeed, everything, everywhere is now incredibly odd. I’m not a conspirator, but I don’t get it.

1318108674955632641 2020-10-19 16:36:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @nickbse @burybeerhouse On the negative side though, we have been making a significant loss since the curfew. Table service is very demanding. Fundamentally the Govt has gone several restrictions too far and lots of pubs are going to go. We are definitely not safe.
1317966823455903744 2020-10-19 07:12:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR @CampaignforPubs Cheers - if you’re ever in Barnet I think I owe you a pint too for everything you do for pubs and the perceptions of Covid more widely!
1317922227187290113 2020-10-19 04:15:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We are re-opening tomorrow in Tier 2 after a brief closure. We’ve made the garden more comfortable for the colder weather and we’ve re-arranged furniture inside to provide more single/pair seating options. We are also going trial text your order at busier times.  https://t.co/AUHwpoVeYI
1317838122755948546 2020-10-18 22:41:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @bernardjenkin Forget the EU, no-one is interested...it’s  sod the PM if he doesn’t drop the ridiculous Covid restrictions and let business operate...
1317837660824719360 2020-10-18 22:39:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate ...out of the silly curfew, onerous and pointless table service and tier 2 restrictions to full compensated lockdown and back to curfew, table service and tier 2....fire, frying pan, fire...just close us for good with compensation or let us open in the original safe way...
1317779646625316864 2020-10-18 18:48:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AlistairHaimes Money, liberty and justification are all inter-linked. It’s all too easy for authority and their supporters to restrict liberty without justification when they don’t pay the financial price; but through having to pay, the authority will be more considered.
1317634459324342272 2020-10-18 09:11:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Jonathan_MBanks With the same slogan as ours: Build Back Better. Biden using that slogan too. Creepy.
1317595763799691264 2020-10-18 06:38:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RealDeniseWelch You’re welcome at Ye Olde Mitre Inne, Barnet, too....I owe you a pint for your work on here to calm the hysteria!!  https://t.co/uZPfNHeL2K
1317594969188741120 2020-10-18 06:34:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @jreynoldsMP @callumringer_ “Hopes and prayers” but no cash to help those who need it.
1317586297993809927 2020-10-18 06:00:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JeromeMayhew Completely missing the key point that individuals and businesses need financial support - “hopes and prayers” don’t really cut it for those individuals that you expect to carry the financial can.
1317518195880792064 2020-10-18 01:29:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Never have all pubs ever been under such threat.  https://t.co/5osT8jTA4W
1317505263080034304 2020-10-18 00:38:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson @jacindaardern I note that you use the same slogan: Build Back Better. Bidon using it too.
1317486429270872064 2020-10-17 23:23:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @heywoodrob31 @jacindaardern Fair enough. I don’t know enough about the NZ domestic situation or her policies to make comment. But her, Biden and Johnson using the same phrase is a bit chilling to me especially given the levels of population control being exercised.
1317479478180929536 2020-10-17 22:55:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @heywoodrob31 @jacindaardern Aren’t you spooked by her reference to Build Back Better?
1317472293577281537 2020-10-17 22:27:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oakthrone @PeakePolly @Francis_Hoar If I were in charge, the first thing I would do is completely review the science - in particular a re-assessment of the harm of this virus which is considerably clearer, less severe and more targeted than it was back in Jan/Feb. What would you do?
1317464392305414144 2020-10-17 21:56:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @katman_999 Bizarre.
1317440431559499776 2020-10-17 20:20:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR 😂😂😂 - need some pics of you thumbing a ride to the food bank...
1317440001957920768 2020-10-17 20:19:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oakthrone @PeakePolly @Francis_Hoar I don’t deflect. I recognise that both Govt scientists and the politicians that lead us are involved. The difficulty for you is coming to terms with the fact that officials are not selfless and a-political beings that always understand and work in the national interest.
1317437417540956160 2020-10-17 20:08:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @catherine_mayer @jacindaardern @WEP_UK That phrase Build Back Better is the most chilling I’ve ever heard. God save us if that is the new world slogan.
1317436889968922625 2020-10-17 20:06:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oakthrone @PeakePolly @Francis_Hoar Govt scientists say we are still in a very dangerous pandemic and that the only way is harsh lockdown - other scientific opinion differs significantly. It is the Govt scientific opinion that gives Govt opportunity to do what they are doing.
1317434899121528832 2020-10-17 19:58:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oakthrone @PeakePolly @Francis_Hoar No, it’s true full stop. You are trying to justify your position from the narrow, possibly politically motivated and face-saving perspective of Govt scientists.
1317431637227995144 2020-10-17 19:45:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oakthrone @PeakePolly @Francis_Hoar Without the profits of doom Govt scientists, the Govt would not be able to do this so quickly and blatantly. It is the Govt scientists that are allowing these changes to be implemented.
1317422633949036545 2020-10-17 19:10:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AndrewGillies9 @Francis_Hoar Ironically, Trump may have been most right. It may be that the result of the election will impact upon the course of the pandemic.
1317419005620224002 2020-10-17 18:55:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PeakePolly @oakthrone @Francis_Hoar I worked for Govt for 21 years. Officials can and do justify any chosen course of action. There is risk aversion and an authoritarian self-entitled lack of appreciation of impact. Add to that toxic mix there can be a tendency to save face rather than correct.
1317415457629065216 2020-10-17 18:41:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @oakthrone @PeakePolly @Francis_Hoar I’m not sure the two can be separated as the Govt extreme action flows from the Govt scientists’ perception of the risk of Covid.  If we take a more balanced scientific position reflecting the evidence - like that of Carl Heneghan - the Govt has nothing to justify it’s extremism.
1317393573306863616 2020-10-17 17:14:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Francis_Hoar I think there are people on both sides of the independence and sovereignty debate that are driven solely by fear. If anything, I think pro-EU people are more likely to believe the Govt experts and have more irrational emotion about Covid.
1317243665044176896 2020-10-17 07:18:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ShaunBaileyUK @WillH3653 Despite his failings, I’m afraid your votes are going to get hammered by the decisions made by the Conservative Government on the 10pm curfew and Covid tier system - both killing hospitality businesses faster than anything Khan has done.
1317235153371123713 2020-10-17 06:45:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Nicklikesrum A lot of us won’t be far behind. I feel for you. As for Boris and chums, I will never understand when it became acceptable to restrict businesses for the so called public good but not to support them. Best of luck, I hope you get out relatively unscathed.
1317232921514811392 2020-10-17 06:36:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Nicklikesrum I’m sorry to hear that. A very difficult decision and you are right to do what you consider right. Anyone who has got this far has done well. It’s virtually impossible now.
1317176923907383298 2020-10-17 02:53:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AndyBurnhamGM You are the one talking sense: with restriction we need financial support. It is clearly unacceptable that the “National interest” means individual businesses and employees are hung out to dry.
1317167577257357312 2020-10-17 02:16:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NicolaSturgeon Can I ask you to take a moment to answer why you are in such a panic about the results of the “a bit rubbish tests”?
1317059191555706882 2020-10-16 19:05:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @gavmadmac Yes, table service for a busy wet led pub, 10pm closure, and a last celebration before a move to even more crippling tier 2 has got the better of us. I’m opening again on Monday, but I’m not holding my breath that it will be sustainable.
1317036242605932544 2020-10-16 17:34:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Lol, isn’t that why there is so much debate - “because even the world’s epidemiologists disagree when it comes to how to tackle Covid”. Yet you push one side of the argument.
1317022938235809793 2020-10-16 16:41:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ColinToner10 Hi Colin, I’m going to re-open next week, but not sure for how long. We just do not have the resources to deal with a peak before Tier 2 kicks in. Totally overwhelmed last night. The rule of 6 only applies outside for Tier 2 - so inside is single household only.
1317017578280308736 2020-10-16 16:20:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @doughtagnan @TheCapHarleston @StanfordArmsPub @jeffreyjohnbell Did they quote the Rules that say this?
1316843317796233218 2020-10-16 04:48:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SchoonerNE8 @CampaignforPubs It’s incredible that anyone thinks it is any way acceptable that we can be restricted to this degree without financial support.
1316833339605766147 2020-10-16 04:08:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I’ve closed tonight as we just could not cope with the last minute trade before the move to tier two. I’m going to remain closed for at least the weekend.  https://t.co/KO7ho9Yayb
1316785292460855296 2020-10-16 00:57:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> “In the national interest” as Matt Hancock says is not assigning a number of businesses to bankruptcy and making masses of people unemployed. @CampaignforPubs
1316753449648893952 2020-10-15 22:51:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Turned its back is an understatement. Throwing us under a bus is what has happened. It should not be acceptable to anyone that individuals should shoulder the financial responsibility of actions we are forced to do for the collective good.
1316742108263452676 2020-10-15 22:05:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Keir_Starmer Oh shut up will you. We need to agree the principle that if businesses and individuals are forced out of work then they will be fully compensated. Individuals should not be forced to take the hit if we are doing these things for the collective good.
1316726644741152768 2020-10-15 21:04:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is the infection and hospital data behind tier 2 lockdown of London. We are being led into carnage of London’s hospitality businesses for no reason. Our politicians are being unreasonable. @CampaignforPubs
1316707653125632000 2020-10-15 19:49:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Thinkerist @SadiqKhan I agree. But it’s Conservatives who are going to get blamed as they are running the national show and it is them who have failed to come up with a support package. I am not a fan of Khan, but there is no way I am voting for Bailey now.
1316702060268617732 2020-10-15 19:26:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @walshdominic Only the tip of the iceberg of Pubs Code breaches and Heineken has probably saved money with the fine as thousands of tenants have not been able to achieve free of tie as a result of such obstruction.
1316699470864830466 2020-10-15 19:16:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The move to tier 2 with absolutely no support for businesses or their staff is an absolute scandal. We need to protest to show the Government that this just isn’t acceptable. The Conservatives will never be forgiven for this complete disregard for viable businesses and employers.
1316505848999489546 2020-10-15 06:27:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I agree that it’s time for more active protest. As an industry we have made huge sacrifices to provide safe spaces and to help the Government and the country manage the virus. In return, our businesses have been trashed with the 10pm curfew and the threat of further closure.
1316497726494867459 2020-10-15 05:54:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @essextc @ProtectPubs On the contrary I think we can. Though I would agree to a two week lockdown for the purposes of developing a “live with it” strategy. No ridiculous modelling, moon-shining or scare-mongering, just irrefutable facts and pragmatism on what we are dealing with. That’s not on offer.
1316495962538479616 2020-10-15 05:47:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @essextc @ProtectPubs We need a fundamental review of the harm of the virus.
1316493016018886661 2020-10-15 05:36:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @essextc @ProtectPubs Ah ok, you don’t want to answer the fundamental questions. Neither does anyone in Govt. This is not the virus it was thought to be at the outset and no country would have responded in any of these ways if we knew what is known now.
1316482127945494528 2020-10-15 04:52:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @essextc @ProtectPubs I’m not sure that’s the way - these countries used lockdowns too. Who is susceptible? What’s the % chances of susceptibility and how does that compare? How can we protect the most vulnerable? How do we get an NHS that can cope and treat other things? How do we rate our freedoms?
1316468222988779520 2020-10-15 03:57:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @essextc @ProtectPubs It’s not sustainable to keep closing the country. What is the future?
1316454813736087556 2020-10-15 03:04:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NadineDorries I agree. How stupid is our Government to throw people out of all hospitality venues at the same time and to expect the young not to enjoy their lives. Meanwhile, having no credible strategy or data, senseless restrictions and are causing untold medical and financial disaster.
1316453225642569732 2020-10-15 02:58:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @matthewchampion You see no harm from lockdowns?
1316441535593041921 2020-10-15 02:11:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @essextc @ProtectPubs I get that. But Labour were making good noise that lockdowns don’t work, which much of the science now says too. They failed to vote against the 10pm curfew. Their position is not supportive. Anneliese Dodds thinks 2 weeks will sort it all and track and trace, cloud cuckoo land.

1316411971886030849 2020-10-15 00:14:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fmwales @BorisJohnson None of you are protecting anyone, you are wrecking the UK.

1316384877500141569 2020-10-14 22:26:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @walshi01 I don’t rate any party.
1316377786555211776 2020-10-14 21:58:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @WilliamClouston Rest-stop.
1316351273239801856 2020-10-14 20:12:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AgentP22 She has more interest in her personal political ambitions than protecting Scotland in the widest sense. Everything now points to lockdowns and restrictions being counter-productive but she continues for her political gain. Shocking.
1316340606998908929 2020-10-14 19:30:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> How are people supposed to live and businesses supposed to operate under this chaos? We’ve had the rule of 6, the curfew and the tier system all introduced and not been given any time to impact. And now lockdown for two weeks. What happens after that?  https://t.co/JjwxGvpAJh
1316333257395449857 2020-10-14 19:01:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mattjtemp We are led by fools.
1316325981641207808 2020-10-14 18:32:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mayor_anderson No, politicians from all parties are shaming our country. Incorrect data, incompetent responses, regulations that don’t make sense, a failure in democracy and communication. How dare you blame and divide people when you have all failed so miserably.
1316304289103519745 2020-10-14 17:06:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We need a fundamental scientific review. The comparative harm of the virus, the accuracy of the tests, the nature of the spread, the hospital and other resources available, the most relevant stats and the ways to protect. It is the threat that the Inquiry will look at first.
1316297991024672769 2020-10-14 16:41:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JamesHa78131584 @CampaignforPubs Not sure that it’s a key issue! We are not exclusively drinks as we do a little food - but food is less than 5%.
1316286045558894595 2020-10-14 15:53:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TeamUtopian Mmmm....there is a large scientific opinion that the things we do have very limited impact and the virus is taking a natural course.  Scientists have doubted Vallance’s figures from the outset.
1316132380390952964 2020-10-14 05:43:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PubsAdvisory @NCD100 @libdemdaisy @SIBA01 @forpubs @CAMRA_Official I have a town drink led pub in outer London. Lost 20% through customer fear and not being able to have local groups meeting, no music and no parties/events. Lost a further 25% as a result of curfew - lost 19 hours trading, 23% and at my busiest times.
1316120569444786177 2020-10-14 04:56:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan What happens after another 6 months of painful business and life destroying restrictions implemented by the Conservative Party?

1316074672543465475 2020-10-14 01:53:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CGreenUK Well done.

1316072602264363009 2020-10-14 01:45:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @mrjamesob There is a much wider epidemiology debate that you, and the Govt, ignore. You also ignore the wider picture of life and the perspective of Covid within that. Let’s leave it there.
1316069252361793537 2020-10-14 01:32:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @mrjamesob We are where we are. We are not dealing with the virus that WHO thought it was at the start.
1316068848785858561 2020-10-14 01:30:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnnelieseDodds @RichardBurgon Eeerm, last week you were saying that 19 of 20 local lockdowns weren’t working. WHO no longer recommends lockdowns. Lockdowns don’t help the economy. You oppose the 10pm curfew but you won’t vote it down.
1316065821987401733 2020-10-14 01:18:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @mrjamesob That’s neither a definitive position agreed by all epidemiology nor a decision just for medical experts.
1316060018295406596 2020-10-14 00:55:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I have to say Labour’s position bemuses me too. Last week arguing lockdowns don’t work, this week calling for a lockdown. Disagreeing with the 10pm curfew, but won’t vote against it in Parliament. What the actual?
1316057326756024320 2020-10-14 00:44:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Sage clearly exaggerated figures and the opinion of epidemiology is split. WHO no longer advocate lockdowns. The Tories have inflicted so much pain and no longer following Sage. Labour oppose the curfew but won’t vote against it - now calling for lockdown. I’m off to the pub.

1316052159524372482 2020-10-14 00:24:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @trippywoo Labour not going to oppose vote on curfew, but they don’t agree with it??? But they have just called for a 2-3 week circuit breaker. WHO says lockdowns are damaging and should not be primary strategy.  British public supports lockdown. We are in la-la land.
1316048446957256708 2020-10-14 00:09:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @mrjamesob I cannot really reconcile the different views between epidemiologists. It adds to my original point that we need accurate and proportionate science. It is then the Government’s role to balance the danger of Covid against other harms.
1316043917469642758 2020-10-13 23:51:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @mrjamesob I’m not aware of any scientist saying that.

1316033491994324997 2020-10-13 23:10:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl @mrjamesob We now know Vallance was using that to justify a 2 week lockdown. The Govt did a curfew. Vallance had said that the curfew would be of minimal impact so that does not explain why the estimate was so far out. We wait to see if hospitalisations reach 3000 a day by end October.
1315978735275790336 2020-10-13 19:32:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps Hibernation for freeholders and long leaseholders looks like the best option dependant upon trading levels and restrictions on the particular pub. At the moment, I’m cheaper to open, but I will close when that tips.
1315977017926586368 2020-10-13 19:25:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GeneralBurk Yes, I saw that. Unbelievable!
1315956894469685249 2020-10-13 18:05:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon Agreed, but Labour is doing nothing about it by supporting the 10pm curfew.

The Whitty/Vallance realistic exponential growth to 50k positive tests a day has not happened despite the Govt not acting. How do you reconcile all that?  https://t.co/daXkOPesOO
1315904960178147330 2020-10-13 14:39:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Sage advised 3 weeks ago to close down completely based on their estimate of 50,000 positive tests a day. The Govt didn’t do it. The 50,000 positive tests hasn’t happened. We got a 10pm curfew that Labour criticises but will not vote against. Pubs are in a political blame game  https://t.co/xX4RMHSKIG
1315775706731819009 2020-10-13 06:05:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> So, the strategy is to suppress the virus until a vaccine arrives but that might never happen so hopefully something else might come around the corner? In the meantime, we save the NHS from getting busy by restricting and closing the businesses that pay for it. #losttheplot

1315718621860069383 2020-10-13 02:18:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR The main problem is tier 2. No help and trade limited by 10pm curfew and single household tables indoors. That would kill lots of pubs.

1315244769375858689 2020-10-11 18:56:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @StarInnGlossop @ProtectPubs @CampaignforPubs For controlling costs during a downturn and providing good service when all our seats are full, it doesn’t work for us. Plus our staff are more exposed, not less exposed. Socially distanced bar service worked well for us. The point is that Govt should not be this prescriptive.
1315241249977368577 2020-10-11 18:42:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Sadiq Khan and Shaun Bailey disagreeing over virus measures.

Lots of it does not make sense and we don’t know what is going to happen next. My view is that when trace drops to a point that it’s cheaper to close then I will probably do so unless I think it’s for a very short period.

My plan was/is to retire from the Mitre. When I know that is not going to be possible I’ll probably just want to wrap it up as cheaply as possible without any fines.
1315061440651431936 2020-10-11 06:47:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CabbagePickler It’s very hard for pubs to break the law as a protest individually as we could easily be punished. It would require huge bravery and huge public support for campaign groups and the large pub corporations to sanction collectively. There is a legal challenge to the curfew.
1315022715254906880 2020-10-11 04:13:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate @MailOnline The Government clearly does not understand the different types of pubs that exist or how people socialise and how they will socialise with no regulated pub venues to go to.

Most who have run or works in one would agree. Govts and armchair commentators should simply not be telling business owners how to run their operations to this degree.

The strategy is to turn social contact on and off. It started with a 3 week closure in March with a reasonable grant and furlough for that period. Here we are 6 months later and we’re curfewed and some closed. There is no end and that is the problem.
1313984870612455425 2020-10-08 07:29:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Brilliantly put by Greg. There are few pubs going to survive this relentless onslaught. We need the public to get behind pubs and publicans as most have tried very hard to support Covid efforts and we are part of the solution to enabling life to go on. @CampaignforPubs
1313982953052045312 2020-10-08 07:22:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mark_J_Harper @SteveBakerHW @JakeBerry Please keep going. The ship has got to be turned quickly.
1313959553000763394 2020-10-08 05:49:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @inalexworld You didn’t need to say that so especially appreciated. My view has varied at different points of the “pandemic”. I still have doubts about what is going on. A sign of our polarisation on all these areas is due to a lack of clarity and strategy by those who lead us.
1313947784945586178 2020-10-08 05:02:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BarrySheerman I think you’ll find that a large proportion of the public are exasperated in Scotland as they are in the rest of the U.K. We are exasperated by all Parliamentarians, including Labour, who have not spoken out about the disproportionate response to Covid until this week. Sort it

1313945582994685953 2020-10-08 04:53:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Local authorities following the evidence which does not point to hospitality. The Government needs to back off.   https://t.co/Ka3A0qiXIs
1313945154387144704 2020-10-08 04:51:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps It’s very frustrating a Peter. I am amazed that Scotland will tolerate an alcohol ban.
1313907686023536641 2020-10-08 02:22:58 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We need the Government to stop now.
1313907310717276163 2020-10-08 02:21:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan People follow people for lots of different reasons.
1313896552025542658 2020-10-08 01:38:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HuwMerriman Well said. Keep speaking out. The Conservatives will soon never be forgiven for what is happening.
1313873392630726657 2020-10-08 00:06:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ProfTomkins The Conservative Government is doing the same in England. It’s time to grapple power from these autistic fools - we need them to manage the country, not manage just a virus.
1313849558368124933 2020-10-07 22:31:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I hope that this is where Scotland says no. England will quickly follow. Enough is enough. We need politicians who can manage the whole country, not politicians who just manage a virus.
1313832137817292800 2020-10-07 21:22:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Unbelievable. Where is the scientific link between alcohol and the spread of the virus - are the kids drunk at schools, are patients and residents having a swifty in hospitals and care homes? Sturgeon is off her nut.   https://t.co/wdG990hemi
1313819133872689155 2020-10-07 20:31:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson You are managing Covid - you need to manage the country.
1313808041217753088 2020-10-07 19:47:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UK_4_Democracy @Conservatives They have abandoned business, liberty, common sense and Conservatism. They are managing Covid at the expense of the country. I don’t think we’ve ever been closer to people taking to the streets to depose them.
1313805324923686913 2020-10-07 19:36:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> 11pm is no good for Covid or to a lot of pubs as it still creates a bottleneck. Licensing laws were changed in 2005 allowing us to open much later. Losing any of that late evening trade in these difficult times without support is damaging. @CampaignforPubs
1313801941126983681 2020-10-07 19:22:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DanielJHannan I think you are looking at it in your ivory tower and through rose tinted glasses. He has hung businesses and hard-working people out to dry. He will never be forgiven unless he frantically turns from managing just Covid to managing the country.
1313760644571770881 2020-10-07 16:38:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The situation is bad for Pubs, but absolutely disgraceful for nightclubs. In the name of protecting everyone when did it become acceptable to let a group of individuals bleed to bankruptcy? @CampaignforPubs
1313759054095843328 2020-10-07 16:32:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Matt_VickersMP @UKHospKate Thank you. I run a profitable wet pub in normal times, down 45% mainly because of the curfew which loses us 23% of our best trading hours. We complied with guidelines, a mainly mature client base. Paid my taxes for 12 years. I’m now left to bleed to bankruptcy. Please help us.
1313747846403895296 2020-10-07 15:47:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @theswanyork @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour @GOVUK @CampaignforPubs Labour could have used the lever to get us support, they failed. So disappointed.
1313639540213592067 2020-10-07 08:37:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Nus_Ghani @HouseofCommons Pleased you had the backbone. Need to end the 10pm curfew as tens of thousands of businesses will go bust and hundreds of thousands people will lose their jobs. The majority of pubs support the earlier measures and rigorous enforcement.
1313636713177198592 2020-10-07 08:26:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson Nope. You are destroying lives and businesses. You need to move from managing just Covid to managing the country.
1313619305863544833 2020-10-07 07:17:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ed_Miliband @KareemNaaman So why is the Labour Party not voting against their rule of 6 and curfew measures. You are letting us down as much as they are. You all need to start focusing on the country and not just Covid.
1313617738024222722 2020-10-07 07:10:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EstherMcVey1 Thank you. We need more to speak up. I run a wet pub. A mature friendly customer base. Complying with the rules. We lose 23% of our best trading hours due to the curfew. 45% down now. It now costs me to open. We desperately need help.
1313616819866030080 2020-10-07 07:07:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Theetownhead @NicolaSturgeon My best wishes. Whatever she does Boris will doubtless follow in some fashion.
1313616553397678081 2020-10-07 07:06:06 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AngelaRayner You are not opposing anything. 10PM curfew which is not evidenced, is counter-productive and is causing untold financial damage was an opportunity to team up with rebel Tories and change the debate. You didn’t take it.
1313615812956237825 2020-10-07 07:03:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GeneralBurk Hancock is the Minister for Covid. Nothing else matters.
1313601679196123137 2020-10-07 06:07:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LouiseEmery @SuzanneEvans1 I’m pleased for you. I’m looking at everything, but the options are not great for the particular business model I have adopted and the commitments we have.
1313597889747333120 2020-10-07 05:51:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan We need all MPs from all all parties now to feel comfortable about raising questions about the approach to the management of this virus. The Government has a country to manage, not just a virus.
1313592661849276422 2020-10-07 05:31:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RobertJenrick @BorisJohnson It was like white noise. The Conservative Party will never be trusted again if you do not move from managing Covid to governing the country.
1313585502965161986 2020-10-07 05:02:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PeterBoneUK Well done. The curfew is killing hospitality. Now down 45%. It’s costing me £2-£3k a week to stay open. No support as I am a wet led pub. I’ve been following all the procedures. I have a mature and responsible clientele. I don’t know what to do.
1313584847533879296 2020-10-07 05:00:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SuzanneEvans1 We’re all going to close. The curfew has been the final nail in the coffin. I’m down 45% meaning it’s costing me £2-£3k a week to stay open. I have no idea what to do.
1313581967926071299 2020-10-07 04:48:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mark_J_Harper Very well said. We have a Government that is managing a virus and not managing the country.
1313581779262070785 2020-10-07 04:47:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This MP very eloquently puts that alternative proposals are not about “letting the virus rip” - it’s about the whole picture of damage being done and finding a better balance to the way forward. We currently have a Government that is managing a virus, but not managing the country
1313580202606428160 2020-10-07 04:41:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @twocitiesnickie It is your party that is destroying these industries.
1313549304267759626 2020-10-07 02:38:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ScotTories @AgentP22 @Douglas4Moray The SNP are completely ignorant of business needs, but your party is not doing much better in England with the silly 10pm curfew. You all need to get some proportion. You are managing countries, not Covid outbreaks.
1313546247911993346 2020-10-07 02:26:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChippingLabour ...I’ll be rescinding my membership. I need the money to pay my staff.
1313541845457211399 2020-10-07 02:09:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Hathers46allout Yes, it doesn’t work economically. I am happy to do my bit for Covid, but I cannot lose £2-3k per week and no business owner should be expected to.
1313541180785819649 2020-10-07 02:06:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Hathers46allout We are all in danger. I am seriously considering closure.
1313540190015762432 2020-10-07 02:02:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Labour Party lets pubs down supporting the Government”s 10pm curfew - a decision that is not evidenced, causes immense harm to hundreds of thousands of businesses and employees and is counter productive to Covid. Ridiculous decision.   https://t.co/uC2KXoz3y5
1313526783736786946 2020-10-07 01:09:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO He’s inspired me to the edge of giving up because of his ineptitude. We are going round and round in highly destructive circles with huge gaps in understanding.
1313473500741537792 2020-10-06 21:37:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @liharvester @CampaignforPubs I hope not, but I wouldn’t bet on it not happening.
1313465954626658305 2020-10-06 21:07:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @reece_dinsdale Or he could just be putting perspective on the hysteria.
1313456230736723968 2020-10-06 20:29:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LicensingLaws Possibility eat and drinks only, no drinks only.
1313455894630367232 2020-10-06 20:27:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChrisMusson @DPJHodges Every time she says “it’s not a political game...”, or “we don’t want to do this”....she is saying the opposite and trying to excuse herself from the ridiculous political point scoring and decisions that she is making...
1313415667018850305 2020-10-06 17:47:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChippingLabour All I think is needed is for you to highlight and lobby through your structures that the curfew is really hurting and to encourage support by Labour MPs to vote against it tomorrow.
1313403482045644800 2020-10-06 16:59:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @andystock22 @RogerProtzBeer The Mitre has been knocked into a loss of £2-£3k a week. The curfew loses us 19.5 (23%) of trading hours and these are our busiest hours. No evidence, no support.
1313402812731199488 2020-10-06 16:56:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChippingLabour Yes, done all that. Be good if the local Labour Party could campaign in support of Publicans as well. It seems like you don’t want to know.
1313393218499870721 2020-10-06 16:18:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EmmaKennedy Most people are asymptotic?
1313389971722702848 2020-10-06 16:05:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BBCNews Boris Johnson has caused this destruction and continues to do so.
1313389185487769601 2020-10-06 16:02:38 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I feel for Scottish colleagues. Our politicians have got the balance wrong between Covid and Covid control measures and have completely lost sight that individuals, like publicans, should not be shouldering the financial burden. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/DOpzkJ9VDv
1313378139578527744 2020-10-06 15:18:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChippingLabour ...is Labour going to vote to end the 10pm curfew which has been introduced without evidence, without support for hospitality businesses and is wrecking businesses? The Mitre is at serious risk from the curfew which has reduced us to a loss making of 55% trade.
1313377070362263552 2020-10-06 15:14:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AngelaRayner I hope Labour is going to join rebel Tories on Wednesday night to overturn the 10pm curfew which was introduced with no evidence, no support and is crippling hospitality businesses throughout the country.
1313233973200465920 2020-10-06 05:45:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan @HouseofCommons Your Government has just effectively closed a safely operating pub industry with the unjustified and counter-productive curfew. 10s of thousands of profitable businesses and 100s of employees thrown on the scrap heap. You are not Conservative - you are shamefully destructive.
1313232441251856385 2020-10-06 05:39:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I hope that this is true that Conservatives are going to rebel in sufficient numbers to overturn the curfew. The curfew is counter-productive, business wrecking, and a shamefully token action by a floundering and inept Government. It needs correcting.
1313215713587408897 2020-10-06 04:33:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MattHancock He does not once mention the harm caused to lives and livelihoods by his strategy.  The whole of the Government are autistic.
1313215297063718914 2020-10-06 04:31:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> He does not once mention the harm to lives and livelihoods caused by his strategy - he is completely focussed on the virus. He is autistic. The whole Government is autistic. The Conservative Party needs to grapple power from them.
1313134956273700865 2020-10-05 23:12:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @twocitiesnickie @ShaunBaileyUK Your party is destroying the country and is no longer Conservative. Wrecking businesses and wrecking lives. You will never be forgiven.
1313120855124312066 2020-10-05 22:16:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SlinbagTheGreat @ElmtreeMc @DPJHodges Agree, on a whim. We lose pre and post meal trade as there is no time to go to the pub, we lose people travelling back from London and elsewhere, we lose late finish workers, we lose many people who just don’t bother coming out.
1313076396332376064 2020-10-05 19:19:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheGunnersPub Agree. No accountability for big business. Property owners also off the hook. Setting aside what we think@is needed in terms of restrictions to control the virus, there are fundamental things that the Conservatives could do to balance the impact and they have chosen not to.
1313075515125895170 2020-10-05 19:16:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PickardJE He does himself no favours. The public will never forgive these imbeciles.
1313074444294856704 2020-10-05 19:11:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Hollow words. 2020 has created a Conservative Party that is destroying businesses; replaced liberty with authoritarianism; and is incompetent at every level. Sunak does himself no favours by standing by the current leadership. The public will never forgive this.  https://t.co/4hcFjDRZ84
1313055803771936770 2020-10-05 17:57:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SlinbagTheGreat @SocialM85897394 Cheers for posting. We had managed to recover to 80% trade just prior to the curfew. The curfew has knocked us down to 55% trade and we no longer generate enough money to pay our bills.
1313048883812069376 2020-10-05 17:30:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SlinbagTheGreat @SocialM85897394 Licensing laws changed in 2005 and many of us open much later. We serve until midnight Sunday through to Thursday and 1am Fridays and Saturdays. We are, therefore, losing 19.5 trading hours (23%) and these are our busiest hours.
1313039637858967552 2020-10-05 16:53:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AnneMarieMorris @TheRingOfBells1 We need Conservative MPs to save the country from your leadership.

1313031081151606784 2020-10-05 16:19:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This proposed alert system has the potential to give some structure and proportion, but disappointing that the poorly thought out and un-evidenced 10pm curfew remains and at “green” level. Shoots the whole thing in the foot. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/SuvWJww8QE
1312824931923759106 2020-10-05 02:40:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HSJEditor @AlistairHaimes Average age of death 82? Maybe to do with initial spread? There’s no poverty in seaside towns everywhere?
1312822047312162823 2020-10-05 02:29:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ross_biagini @HelenAnnSmith0 I don’t benefit from anywhere being closed. TBH, it’s cheaper to be shut for me than operate under these restrictions and the curfew. I’m giving it a couple of weeks to get better then probably temporary closure. We need to join forces - not demean the plight of the other.
1312819143763259397 2020-10-05 02:17:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PubSandy @MattHancock I don’t seriously doubt it exists. I know a few who have had it and one who died.
1312805849174339590 2020-10-05 01:24:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scoutnick @MattHancock I don’t seriously doubt it exists.
1312781481811628039 2020-10-04 23:47:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> If anyone finds any Covid anywhere could they please let @MattHancock know.
1312773690061357057 2020-10-04 23:16:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @CampaignforPubs hits the headlines with a plea for help from more than 1000 Publicans. The Conservative Party is now the party of business destruction. They will never be trusted again if this nonsense curfew continues.
1312721448541270016 2020-10-04 19:49:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps What I do not get is that it is considered that certain businesses and industries have to be curtailed for the “collective good”, but the “collective good” think that it’s ok for  those affected businesses and individuals to pay the price. This is in no way acceptable.
1312707150221897728 2020-10-04 18:52:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @arecular I’m talking about Covid.
1312702443776626688 2020-10-04 18:33:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> “Fearlessly but with common sense” the Government has introduced a curfew that is wrecking businesses without presenting any justification. The leadership of the Conservative Party has been infiltrated by foolishness in a way like never before. Parliament must take control.
1312700909839880193 2020-10-04 18:27:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ProudSocialist @thenctoo They didn’t really. They listened to legitimate alternative science about the virus in terms of its likely lesser path of destruction, the unreliability of PCR testing, the damage done by lockdowns, etc. They have caught it like any one of us could no matter how cautious we are.
1312525260164456451 2020-10-04 06:49:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The ridiculousness that is the curfew. Sums up the Government strategy throughout.
1312523508895809537 2020-10-04 06:42:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lincscga @RoseAndCrownBeb @BorisJohnson If “we” are in a pandemic and “we” need to restrict businesses like this, then why is it that this and other businesses have to meet the cost individually. “We” must meet the cost impacts of the restrictions.
1312518714084921346 2020-10-04 06:23:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> At last big business with big money has the gumption to challenge the legality of the latest measures. No evidence has been presented for a curfew, no impact assessment, Parliament bypassed and it does nothing for managing Covid. Hope the action succeeds.   https://t.co/x3h0GX9Xd1
1312516721559830528 2020-10-04 06:15:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GaryAkiens @CampaignforPubs @AlbertoCostaMP Fully agree. The Conservative Party will never be trusted again with the interests of business. This decision is not evidenced, it is ruining good businesses and individuals and is doing nothing for the management of Covid. We are led by imbeciles.
1312445484095606785 2020-10-04 01:32:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan Your hypocrisy is astounding - it’s your party that is inflicting chaos on this country by progressing an agenda of fear and destruction on everything that is not Covid. The British public will never forgive Conservatives for this. Many have never been so angry. You need to fix.
1312443419952734211 2020-10-04 01:24:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SteveBakerHW The Conservative party will never get over the mess Johnson and Hancock have made of Covid and the damage they are doing to other health and the economy. Completely imbecilic. People like you need to act hell of a fast now to get it sorted.
1312434252819161092 2020-10-04 00:48:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LukeJohnsonRCP Samuel Johnson visited my pub in 1774. I wonder what he’d make of the curfew which has reduced my successful business to making a loss at only 55% trade whilst the curfew does nothing for Covid.  https://t.co/vkyTydBKnc
1312432240773734400 2020-10-04 00:40:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DavidDavisMP They have abandoned pubs with this silly curfew. We’ve lost 19.5 (23%) of our busiest trading hours. A strong tax paying business now operating at a loss on only 55% or normal trade because of nothing that helps Covid. The Conservatives will not be trusted after this. Imbeciles.
1312422077790597121 2020-10-03 23:59:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MPSRedbridge @RedbridgeLive @Jas_Athwal @IlfordRecorder @nusound92fm @ELAdvertiser @LocalCrimeBeats @essex_crime What an idiotic decision to fine and an even more idiotic decision to post about it. Shocking incompetence.

1312391293390258176 2020-10-03 21:57:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LicensingLaws An example of the ignorance and incompetence at every level in respect of the handling of this pandemic.
1312382290866196480 2020-10-03 21:21:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @libdemdaisy ...and here we have the Office of National Statistics calculating the loss to beer sales of the curfew as one hour a day. I’ve actually lost 19.5 (23%) hours. Worse than an incompetent Govt, is an incompetent Govt acting on incorrect data. @CampaignforPubs
1312377468851019782 2020-10-03 21:02:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ross_biagini @HelenAnnSmith0 Well there’s only one way we can address that by a collective and active response.
1312376738152951809 2020-10-03 20:59:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ross_biagini @HelenAnnSmith0 Plus can I ask whether you are a member of any of the trade bodies within which you could make your voice heard? I suspect the answer is no or you wouldn’t have a general expectation that a fellow businessman had failed you. You need to get your thumbs out of your orifice.
1312376042720579585 2020-10-03 20:56:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ross_biagini @HelenAnnSmith0 I have regularly posted and re-tweeted about nightclubs. Many pubs are also still closed too.
1312370323124301824 2020-10-03 20:34:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GeneralBurk No, there is none.
1312369905761751043 2020-10-03 20:32:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GeneralBurk I have every confidence that the British public will not tolerate that. The Government’s floundering and ridiculousness is plain for all to see. Johnson, Hancock, Vallance and Whitty are way below credible.
1312366982377897984 2020-10-03 20:20:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GeneralBurk Totally unsustainable. The policy neither stops Covid nor helps business. I hope you get through it.
1312362049184423936 2020-10-03 20:01:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Adnamscastleinn Same here. They have put a DNR notice on pubs for no reason whatsoever.  https://t.co/mZVz141sWQ
1312360625985777664 2020-10-03 19:55:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HelenAnnSmith0 I’ve lost 19.5 hours a week (23%) of my busiest trading hours for absolutely no Covid reason.
1312359863205457920 2020-10-03 19:52:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MattHancock @JohnAALogan Are these Covid hospitals? That’s all that seems to matter these days.
1312358895449509891 2020-10-03 19:48:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LBC Twit. I’d be surprised if either the rule of 6 or his Govt make it to Christmas Day.
1312354283023724546 2020-10-03 19:30:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Office for National Statistics has calculated the loss in beer sales of the curfew based upon the misnomer of an hour a day of less trade. Clearly don’t know Licensing laws were changed in 2005: I’ve lost 19.5 (23%) of my busiest trading hours.   https://t.co/nTt30eYrhm

We could debate all day and still get nowhere. Let’s leave it there and see what history tell us.
1312338983574212614 2020-10-03 18:29:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SeldomGruntled @JuliaHB1 Me too. There’s more than one scientific opinion and path.
1312209770070245376 2020-10-03 09:56:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson Not because of your unevidenced and random measures. The virus will do what it can and that seems to be petering out.
1312208621560766465 2020-10-03 09:51:29 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman The rule of 6 and 10pm curfew saved us. Covid doesn’t spread after 10pm at taxi ranks, kebab shops and off licences. 😂😂
1312193414381793281 2020-10-03 08:51:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SeldomGruntled @JuliaHB1 I have no fear if that’s what you mean. Average age of death for Covid is 82 - got to be pretty unlucky to die if you are younger.
1312153102703710208 2020-10-03 06:10:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SeldomGruntled @JuliaHB1 Need to concentrate more on levels of illness/impact on the healthy population in respect of both the virus and the restrictions. At the moment the virus appears to be the lesser evil.
1312133961863241729 2020-10-03 04:54:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DonnyBrewery @CampaignforPubs Dreadful. We were recovering nicely, but curfew has killed us. Table service driving costs up and driving us all insane.
1312039209339936768 2020-10-02 22:38:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @VauxWanderer And 20p is nowhere near enough.
1312001091995926528 2020-10-02 20:06:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I am forced now to increase my prices, but the true cost of 10pm closure is way beyond what is palatable for the market. Operating at 55% of normal trade, increased staffing for table service and no help for a wet led pub. This cannot go on. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/rjchGjiNbG
1311752318107488258 2020-10-02 03:38:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman @NicolaSturgeon @Ianblackford_MP Aberdeen will be hammered with restrictions if they get one more case!!
1311751940506779656 2020-10-02 03:36:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We are in very strange times. A Government not explaining or evidencing their ever increasingly random decisions and failing to support those affected. Threatening more restriction and military enforcement against its own citizens. They truly have lost the plot. What’s next?
1311735246853898240 2020-10-02 02:30:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO It is ridiculous now. They are letting everything slip - healthcare, economy - without addressing key questions about the tests. Everyone knows they have over-called Covid. I would think people in the North will take to the streets quickly followed by people in other major cities
1311654731836805121 2020-10-01 21:10:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @torrenttweet99 I have been pushing Theresa. I am a Director of Campaign for Pubs.
1311653655066685441 2020-10-01 21:06:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I say again that if the evidence shows that we have to be restricted for the collective good then the collective good needs to compensate us. It should not be acceptable to anyone that any business is restricted and left to shoulder that burden on their own. @CampaignforPubs

She wanted to make an example of Aberdeen/the pub trade. She and Boris are irrational and are acting without evidence or structure. That has affected their credibility. Trouble ahead for sure.
1311417857650167809 2020-10-01 05:29:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It is selfish to expect certain individuals and businesses to shoulder the financial burden of lockdowns, restrictions and masks which are deemed necessary for the collective good. The collective good needs to share the burden and compensate those individuals and businesses.
1311414092469592065 2020-10-01 05:14:19 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @eaglealehouse @LicenseesAssoc @AlokSharma_RDG @beerandpub @BIIandBIIAB @UKHofficial I have noticed the change in tone from these organisations, but too little to late.
1311362289531006978 2020-10-01 01:48:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman And those that did go to the pub will now have parties after 10pm.
1311360286373351427 2020-10-01 01:40:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @allisonpearson Closed and restricted for the collective good, but the collective good puts the financial burden on certain individuals and businesses. We need to spread the pain - 90% tax for everyone until the restrictions are lifted. The pandemic would be over in a week.
1311359382534397952 2020-10-01 01:36:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate Sadiq Khan would have had us locked down already.

1311320843109232641 2020-09-30 23:03:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BeerEnGin1 I agree. I’m also sick of people pushing restrictions on pubs that have no personal impact on them. If we are restricting for the collective good, then the collective good should not expect us as individuals to carry the financial burden.
1311318259472494592 2020-09-30 22:53:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO @mrmarkdolan Afraid of the Govt.
1311307898891403266 2020-09-30 22:12:20 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The lack of evidence or cost impact of the 10pm curfew is clearly what has swung Parliament to demand that it is consulted on measures. It is frightening that anyone can have totalitarian power and Johnson and Hancock have proved the danger. The curfew needs to be reviewed now.
1311289154953777153 2020-09-30 20:57:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate If we are doing this for the collective good then the collective good has got to recompense us. It should not be individuals shouldering this.
1311281069082185729 2020-09-30 20:25:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 They are going to tell us that the latest emerging evidence is that Covid is spread by flatulence vapour. Everyone is required to wear two pairs of tight fitting pants. All curry houses must close at 6pm and those having curry must self isolate for 24 hours. £20,000 fine.

1311225578851315712 2020-09-30 16:45:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Publicans can sign this open letter to the Chancellor asking for full support. Hundreds have already done so.

1311044841502134273 2020-09-30 04:47:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @normandyps I have to agree with all that.
1311023618592256000 2020-09-30 03:22:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 This is where they tell us that we must wear 2 layers of underwear because evidence is emerging that the virus is spread through flatulence vapour. We should report our partners if they break this rule and there will be regular checks and £10,000 fines administered by police.
1311022245180067840 2020-09-30 03:17:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> He doesn’t even know the rules which he has introduced and are wrecking many lives and businesses. Incompetent beyond belief - he needs to go.
1311011561461383170 2020-09-30 02:34:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pub_that Got to wear two pairs of pants to be changed 3 times daily as the main source of transmission is thought to be flatulence vapour.

1310976919605780480 2020-09-30 00:17:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @scoutnick @carlheneghan I don’t doubt the money comments re. the politicians. But Vallance and Whitty have presented the 50k a day scenario by mid-Oct, refuse to be drawn on the accuracy of the tests and have dismissed t-cell immunity.

1310912522057326594 2020-09-29 20:01:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Well done Kay Burley. Here Gillian Keegan, Skills Minister, admits pubs are not the problem and that we are “very Covid secure”, so there is no reason for a curfew. The Govt sounds more ridiculous every day.
1310881638386196480 2020-09-29 17:58:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Just done my ordering at a fraction of the normal level: the whole supply chain affected by this 10pm curfew. No guest beers for weeks, reduced standard beers, virtually no spirits or soft drinks, no food, less than half what I spend on consumables. Crisis time. @CampaignforPubs
1310855367694389248 2020-09-29 16:14:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The virus matters, other health issues matter, the economy matters, small businesses matter and Liberty matters. So does common sense and proportion. We need to tell our MPs how we feel and they must take back power from Johnson and Hancock to consider the whole position.
1310735220568715265 2020-09-29 08:16:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @DesmondSwayne Well said. We need more like you willing to question what are extraordinary happenings that none of us could ever have contemplated.
1310730748861779970 2020-09-29 07:58:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mark_J_Harper @allisonpearson Well said. There did not seem to be any reason for the Govt to move fast on a curfew for pubs and restaurants and by doing so the Govt has tipped many establishments into serious deficit and done nothing for the management of Covid. Please review the curfew.
1310726368020361217 2020-09-29 07:41:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> A profitable tax paying business in normal times and now I’m operating at a loss on 55% as a result of a stupid curfew that will do nothing to protect people from Covid.
1310658434900127744 2020-09-29 03:11:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR They will hail the pub curfew as a rip-roaring success for bringing cases down...

1310569430032756737 2020-09-28 21:17:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson Resign. We need someone to lead us through Covid who can understand the detail, develop a proportionate strategy, communicate with the public and make evidence based decisions.
1310559177362808834 2020-09-28 20:37:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I am happy to do my bit for Covid, but these latest restrictions have no logic - only 2.8% of infections have anything to do with hospitality, table service technically puts bar staff at higher risk, curfew has no science and actually makes crowding worse. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/rL0Y3wu9wA
1310554805081964545 2020-09-28 20:19:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We all need to check with our insurance whether a restriction to Licensing hours is covered. @CampaignforPubs

1310501474162671616 2020-09-28 16:47:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheGunnersPub @CampaignforPubs I’m thinking now that mothball for 6 months could be cheaper.
1310498284755202048 2020-09-28 16:35:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Curfew pushes income down and table service pushes costs up. Wet led pubs are particularly hard hit. This is anti-business and anti-Conservative. Johnson needs to correct it immediately or step aside for someone who can get the balance right. @CampaignforPubs

They would not all be leaving at the same time if it was not for the silly curfew.

1310293335224078336 2020-09-28 03:00:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @hughosmond I am lobbying Theresa Villiers, Chipping Barnet.
1310290899038076928 2020-09-28 02:51:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @LicensingLaws @KareemNaaman I cannot believe the number of “experts” on TV who are referring to us being asked to “close an hour earlier”. They have no clue.
1310273641259700230 2020-09-28 01:42:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @exit33brewing @KareemNaaman @BorisJohnson They are going home after being sling out of Pubs all at the same time. What is irresponsible about that?
1310269040171134978 2020-09-28 01:24:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @exit33brewing @KareemNaaman @BorisJohnson These people commenting who never go out! I’m just a pub and we don’t close normally until 1.30am. And as Kareem says, it leads to a gradual dispersal. That is a key reason why the licensing laws were changed over 15 years ago.
1310261172332003332 2020-09-28 00:53:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @holliday_viv @mikerainham @CampaignforPubs I’ve maintained it well and developed it over the 12 years. We are wet led and we need the late trade to survive. We’ve all had a terrible 6 months and now they impose another dreadful six months. It is impossible to operate at a loss indefinitely.
1310259092062187522 2020-09-28 00:44:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @edinburgharms @CampaignforPubs We were just about going to scrape by, these restrictions put us well below break even, I don’t trust what will happen next...how long do we hang on?
1310225039200079874 2020-09-27 22:29:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @GeneralBurk @mattcbrad @CampaignforPubs Ok, he’s just a twit.

1310213730601439234 2020-09-27 21:44:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MacWreg @CampaignforPubs The pub is licensed and is ordinarily open to sell alcohol until 1am and there is ordinarily a gradual and natural dispersal. Licensing laws were changed some 15 plus years ago to deal with this very thing.
1310191074489651201 2020-09-27 20:14:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Thisism60101621 @CampaignforPubs They didn’t hand about: you can see them walking down the street. The point is why remove them from the safe environment that they were in, spoil their evenings and ruin my business?
1310187857819074561 2020-09-27 20:01:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MichaelRogerz @CampaignforPubs No help. We were just breaking even before the curfew and table service.
1310187266954928131 2020-09-27 19:59:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Thank you Tobias. This curfew will destroy hospitality businesses up and down the country and do nothing for managing Covid. @CampaignforPubs
1310186569324802048 2020-09-27 19:56:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MichaelRogerz @CampaignforPubs We were doing ok, but the curfew in particular loses us 30-40% of our trade. Table service is impractical and adds significantly to the running cost.
1310181409223577601 2020-09-27 19:36:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mikerainham @CampaignforPubs I agree, I’m very lucky in comparison. It’s our money that pays for Government to function - they should not be treating any of us in this way. If any of us have to be restricted for the collective good then it is the collective responsibility to support them.
1310172256279109632 2020-09-27 18:59:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mailonlinepics @CampaignforPubs Yes, absolutely fine.
1310170009675665408 2020-09-27 18:50:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This has been my life for 12 years. I had a very solid business and community in normal times. The community remains, but my business is ruined by the curfew and other restrictions introduced last week. I now don’t think I will be able to continue. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/030XFdzbvz
1310165087630524418 2020-09-27 18:31:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Positive tests per 1000 tests. Why is this not available on the official pack of stats?
1310157478806654976 2020-09-27 18:00:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman Thankfully I look so much younger I’ll never get stopped by the police...

1310132996952018946 2020-09-27 16:23:42 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @robinjfisher @SteveBakerHW @Telegraph @Conservatives They can only defeat it if Labour and the other opposition parties vote against - that position is not clear. Sturgeon seems to be enjoying the power a bit too much.
1310131809162850304 2020-09-27 16:18:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @robinjfisher @SteveBakerHW @Telegraph @Conservatives You are really diverting. Labour also needs to oppose.
1310131601037197312 2020-09-27 16:18:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChippingLabour @BarnetLabour Thanks. I’ll post there too. The Coronavirus Act is coming up for renewal this week and we need Labour to oppose it and return Parliamentary democracy to any the strategy and damaging restrictions being imposed.
1310130595876528129 2020-09-27 16:14:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @robinjfisher @SteveBakerHW @Telegraph Let’s not divert this to the EU debate. This is about what is happening under the name of Covid.
1310120952139845633 2020-09-27 15:35:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @karenlayton5 @nonamebandk Government should never be this prescriptive on how businesses should operate - broad safety guidelines and all us to comply, checks, advice and enforcement if what we do is not enough.
1310117775755677697 2020-09-27 15:23:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ChippingLabour - where is the local Labour Party in its opposition to (1) the imposition of these highly damaging and in-evidenced restrictions for pubs; and (2) returning our country to a Parliamentary democracy by voting against the renewal of the Coronavirus Act this week.
1310003857557262336 2020-09-27 07:50:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @kickybarr @AudreyAurus1 @BrokenBarnet There was no peak after previous demonstrations or the beaches, remember? Maybe because they were outside?
1310001187979173890 2020-09-27 07:39:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Tony1cfc @ProfChux She’s upset. She doesn’t like that I disagree with her, she blocks me, she slags me off, then takes offence that AC joked about giving her a Glasgow kiss!! I have absolutely no clue who she is. She says she’s not coming back to the pub so all good by me.  https://t.co/NyXOdjXtzf

1309976588956717057 2020-09-27 06:02:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl Ah. I think we all need to wait for a while to see the historical judgement on all of that. But at least he’s calling now for a review and a return to Parliamentary oversight.
1309960632654073861 2020-09-27 04:58:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @maryball2 @ProfKarolSikora Bless you. Awful.
1309956006932250628 2020-09-27 04:40:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Tony1cfc @ProfChux Behaviour like what?
1309949978538897410 2020-09-27 04:16:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Landlords, Landladies and pub lovers, time to write to your MPs about the lunacy of these new restrictions on pubs. We need to stop the renewal of the Coronavirus Act next week and return our country to a Parliamentary democracy. @campaignforpubs  https://t.co/LYCXGz9OjA
1309945435524599811 2020-09-27 03:58:24 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @thepublandlady2 @davemountford5 Well said.
1309933818644705280 2020-09-27 03:12:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @aplarge Yes.
1309933196344209408 2020-09-27 03:09:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @davemountford5 She thinks I’m a Covidiot because I question Government policy on the matter. I did call her a fascist!!
1309930054542077954 2020-09-27 02:57:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @derek_rocholl What did he do?
1309929494699020288 2020-09-27 02:55:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ishumacon @sshaw04 @CampaignforPubs They stuck to their groups outside. The point I make here is that there is no point in throwing them out at 10pm as they are in a Covid safe environment. I used to open until 1.30am and people drifted away naturally, the whole idea of our Licensing Laws.
1309924809011273729 2020-09-27 02:36:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> She blocked me and wrote this. I think it’s going to be a marketing advantage that she won’t be coming to the pub.  https://t.co/I8hzsizrin

1309920838137909249 2020-09-27 02:20:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ishumacon @sshaw04 @CampaignforPubs You demean the seriousness of the issue I raise. Please go away.
1309918393269616641 2020-09-27 02:10:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mikemaco @AudreyAurus1 @BrokenBarnet I don’t know them personally - and I get there are a few crazies - but the sentiment is there. The Govt is operating in a highly Machiavellian way. I am doing my bit to try to hold them to account and so are those protestors. What about you?
1309917405825708033 2020-09-27 02:07:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Adnamscastleinn It’s impossible. We’re all going to go out of business.
1309916814936346626 2020-09-27 02:04:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BrokenBarnet @AudreyAurus1 Your loss. A key trait of fascism is to silence dissenting views. I disagree with much of your hysterical and misinformed views but you have freedom in my world.
1309914894825910275 2020-09-27 01:57:02 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AudreyAurus1 @BrokenBarnet I think the media had branded it as that. I know a lot of people who yearn for a strategic review of what this Govt is doing.
1309914455455694848 2020-09-27 01:55:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AudreyAurus1 @BrokenBarnet Yes, that has to be dealt with proportionately - I’m sure the same happened with other recent protests as presumably vandalising statues was not a pre-agreed aim. It does not affect the right to have and raise a cause in a democracy.
1309913201400844288 2020-09-27 01:50:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AudreyAurus1 @BrokenBarnet I think there is a need for a strategic review of everything. The Government is out of its depth.
1309912943610540033 2020-09-27 01:49:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BrokenBarnet @AudreyAurus1 The right to protest is a fundamental right in any democracy. Picking and choosing what demos are allowed or disallowing any protest is fascist. I am on the right side.
1309911247748501504 2020-09-27 01:42:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BrokenBarnet @AudreyAurus1 Covidiot? I believe Covid is dangerous. So are many other things. I do not believe our Government or the media is either handling it well or proportionately. I believe in protecting the vulnerable. I believe in freedom, including to protest. The opposite to this is fascism.
1309909677216616448 2020-09-27 01:36:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BrokenBarnet @AudreyAurus1 Oh, don’t be ridiculous. I thought you were on the awakened left - you sound like a fascist.
1309907844188209154 2020-09-27 01:29:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AudreyAurus1 @BrokenBarnet Imagine being so influenced by the media to not see what this is really about.  They are mostly “sceptics” of the Government’s approach to Covid, not Covid itself.
1309899156996214786 2020-09-27 00:54:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @bftwni @PubsSaving @CampaignforPubs I am the landlord. What is a BTFW discount?
1309840079809060865 2020-09-26 20:59:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @inalexworld @CampaignforPubs I prefer to challenge the stupidity of the rule.
1309837986826268678 2020-09-26 20:51:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @inalexworld @CampaignforPubs I think you miss the point.
1309836169895718912 2020-09-26 20:44:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Me throwing at least 100 sensible pub goers onto the street in High Barnet at 10pm last night. Inside, they were all sitting at socially distanced tables. Utter madness. @CampaignforPubs please retweet to #endthe10pmcurfew  https://t.co/Pg32IFQ6h5
1309828227112853504 2020-09-26 20:12:39 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ad1234Alex @SwainITV Please explain your point.
1309812924773433346 2020-09-26 19:11:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ad1234Alex @SwainITV Glad to be of assistance. And just to clarify that your point seems to be that experts have no responsibility for evidencing, engaging and reaching consensus on their advice so that they take people with them. People should just do as they are told by any expert.
1309737917988982785 2020-09-26 14:13:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheNookBX @BorisJohnson I think that I would lose less money being closed.
1309679914627538944 2020-09-26 10:23:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @neilluxford @SwainITV My take is that too many people blindly listen to the official dialogue no matter how odd it is - and that our expectations for evidence and knowledge of the detail including alternative strategies and science are very low.
1309679052358385665 2020-09-26 10:19:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Ad1234Alex @SwainITV The public health science has devalued itself on Covid: the fear campaign and the latest projection that isn’t a projection of 50,000 cases by mid-October whilst a France/Spain trajectory would lead to 10,000. No full response on testing anomalies or t-cell immunity.
1309662696044990466 2020-09-26 09:14:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RogerProtzBeer @RSPCA_official Sorry to hear this Roger, non-pet owners can never comprehend how hard it is to lose a friend like this. She looks beautiful and I’m sure you gave her the best life.
1309511899684405249 2020-09-25 23:15:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @IanJ21289455 @PubsAdvisory @RoscoeHead Well done. I have written to my MP Theresa Villiers several times. Another letter will be sent this weekend. I also share my letters to my customers and encourage them to write too. We need to put pressure on them.
1309468423865413632 2020-09-25 20:22:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @amandine365 @JamieJDW @ProtectPubs @BorisJohnson Every pub is different and that is why blanket and detailed restrictions do not work. That is the point of this post. We are virtually 100% drink, fairly quick throughout, near a London tube station, large floor area, very big post-10pm trade.
1309449607282384903 2020-09-25 19:08:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HarryBarnes @TheGunnersPub @BorisJohnson They are not propping up our industry. I have a £230,000 shortfall on the money I had to pay my bills compared to last year. I have received £60k support, leaving a £170k deficit which will worsen with the new restrictions.
1309432019462619136 2020-09-25 17:58:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HarryBarnes @TheGunnersPub @BorisJohnson The science is much more complex. It should not be acceptable - if pubs have to close for the National good and I am far from convinced that they do - that individual pub owners should have to carry the financial can. This is too complex to make sweeping ill-informedjudgements.
1309424245810831361 2020-09-25 17:27:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HarryBarnes @TheGunnersPub @BorisJohnson Too much to pick you on about the science and your broad assertions I think I’ll leave it there other than to say I think your view is blinkered.
1309419441457950720 2020-09-25 17:08:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HarryBarnes @TheGunnersPub @BorisJohnson I don’t tend to get “drunks”. It’s a mature drinking environment where all ages enjoy a peaceful atmosphere. I think most pubs are like this and maybe you are confusing the matter with the more lively bars specifically aimed at people having a livelier time.
1309414685981237249 2020-09-25 16:49:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @andystock22 @BorisJohnson It’s not a panacea.
1309396354087759873 2020-09-25 15:36:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HarryBarnes @TheGunnersPub @BorisJohnson It was just about manageable before these latest restrictions were introduced. There was no statistical evidence to back up the tightening. Purely a political decision to try to show they were doing something.
1309274344489709569 2020-09-25 07:31:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @AdrianForrest69 @JamieJDW @ProtectPubs @BorisJohnson For me, the bar is the centre of a good drinking pub, table service has a place - but not as an exclusive mandatory one. Masks killed the joy, the welcome and the banter.
1309270225792139264 2020-09-25 07:15:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JamesLYucel @scotgov The young need to rise up to this tyranny - lots of older people will follow your lead.
1309264159243206656 2020-09-25 06:51:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Greyman49 It’s the enforced transition with two days notice under very difficult trading conditions and a bemused public that is difficult. I think there is only one way to go - and that is down.
1309263736763539456 2020-09-25 06:49:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Day 1 of table service and masks. Run ragged. Service crap. Distancing poorer than it was as everyone left at the same time. Staff demoralised. Takings 40% down. Nice one @BorisJohnson you are not keeping business going, you are destroying it and many hard working people.
1309223927730900999 2020-09-25 04:11:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Exclusively table service for wet led pubs just does not work. I’m sure that’s why they created bars in the first place. Wearing a mask is hell. I am definitely leaning towards closure.
1309190046982049797 2020-09-25 01:56:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Victoria Line this morning - but table service and curfew is needed in pubs. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/ZRbV2165s6
1309158933748219904 2020-09-24 23:53:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @sarahknapton Further, at the peak only those ill enough to go to hospital were tested. That was probably between 1% and 5% of those who were getting it?
1309143881125113857 2020-09-24 22:53:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> He said it was new normal. Does that mean it’s new normal for a Government to act without evidence, to impose unjustified and unworkable restrictions on businesses and individuals and to do so without financial recompense. We are moving in a very scary direction. #unacceptable  https://t.co/niBszThZPe
1309128852594139145 2020-09-24 21:53:35 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HTScotPol It’s the fault of the pesky students, they were told not to breathe in their shared halls of residence.
1309121950443241473 2020-09-24 21:26:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @russ_t_p Yes Russ, closure looms for many.
1309121286073917449 2020-09-24 21:23:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman All my staff understand the impossible position that we are in and understand the limitations. They see the ridiculous nature of the rules and the terrible impact it’s having on trade. The Govt is operating in cloud cuckoo land.
1309119614086008837 2020-09-24 21:16:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Chocolate teapot furlough. If we cannot afford all our staff then we cannot afford to pay a proportion of their wages for them to be sat at home.  For wet led pubs, we need more staff to meet the new restrictions. What a mess. I would advise anyone who can get out to do so.  https://t.co/THMfiBM36J
1309057059393081344 2020-09-24 17:08:18 +0800 <mitrebarnet> So fast food chains and coffee shops are exempt from table service - we knew already that this was not based on science, this is an insult to the nation’s intelligence.

1309035747714965504 2020-09-24 15:43:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The extension of furlough in itself will not save many jobs. 6 months in - and we now have have another 6 months of even more damaging restrictions. Businesses need cash relief or we will have to lay off  regardless of furlough because we have run out of money. @CampaignforPubs

1308935742287118337 2020-09-24 09:06:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon I think you should look into other areas of scientific research that Govt scientists ignore, not least t-cell immune response.
1308887151669579776 2020-09-24 05:53:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It’s approaching 11 o’clock, the bar is open until midnight. I have about 60 people socially distanced throughout the pub. Not a drunk in sight. The curfew is a mistake of gigantic proportions. @BorisJohnson @CampaignforPubs

1308853547753189381 2020-09-24 03:39:37 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Sacha_Lord @KareemNaaman To be honest part-time furlough is not going to help many drinking pubs either as we are going to need more staff hours for the new restrictions. We need 1) a VAT cut or grants; 2) Statutory Covid rent reviews. @CampaignforPubs
1308852695487393793 2020-09-24 03:36:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman Neither.
1308848487862337537 2020-09-24 03:19:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @TheblackboyO I am a boozer and I stand to lose a lot of pre and post meal trade plus late night returns from London and later finish workers. Kicked whilst already down. Very good Covid safety compliance. Zero evidence for this restriction. No support. Shameful by @BorisJohnson
1308835458617614339 2020-09-24 02:27:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman @CampaignforPubs That, and the difficulty of restarting with no staff, are the only drivers for not doing so.
1308834488181551110 2020-09-24 02:23:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OliAshman @CampaignforPubs It’s a no brainer really. Just reduce costs to basic non-operational costs and wait it out.
1308821382462087169 2020-09-24 01:31:48 +0800 <mitrebarnet> MPs asking for the evidence for the 10pm curfew and table service in pubs. This is the Parliamentary scrutiny we need. @CampaignforPubs
1308820773688180736 2020-09-24 01:29:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR It’s a bigger difference than that. At the height only those admitted to hospital were tested - that was is about 5%. The other 95% were in the community undetected meaning there was probably about 100,000 people who could have potentially been tested positive every day.

1308813481882390529 2020-09-24 01:00:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I wonder how many pubs are working out today, like I have, that its cheaper to close than stay open with these new Government restrictions. @CampaignforPubs

There is a much bigger picture of causes of deaths and quality of life impacts that Sweden has considered - and U.K.  leaders fail to grasp.
1308728859320291328 2020-09-23 19:24:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lucyallan @BorisJohnson He is a reckless and dangerous. There is no evidence for further restrictions on pubs for example - a political move to show he’s doing something. You will NEVER recover from this.  https://t.co/RneN1o1NbO
1308727733409787905 2020-09-23 19:19:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> He keeps saying he wants to “keep the economy going” but his curfew, a political decision and not a scientific one, is only going to put most hospitality business on a fast-track to bankruptcy with no support. No-one should accept this type of reckless rule. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/dmMPzHmuyd
1308696089734852613 2020-09-23 17:13:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> So a curfew appears to be a political gesture by the Government to pretend that they are doing something. Hence why the evidence does not back up that pubs are a hotspot. @CampaignforPubs

My clear message is that pubs are being thrown under Boris’ big red bus even though the vast majority have followed the guidelines strictly and there is no evidence of pubs being a hotspot.

1308318293065961474 2020-09-22 16:12:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is the reality of table service for wet led pubs. Government should not be interfering to this disagree in any business. We should be calling time on their non-existent and unevidenced Covid strategy. @CampaignforPubs
1308182771425325058 2020-09-22 07:14:12 +0800 <mitrebarnet> What is table service? Does it include table payment? This is going to be logistically very hard for wet led pubs.

1308083429024698369 2020-09-22 00:39:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is a completely sensible approach put forward by other experts to have a clear strategy for Covid that puts it in context with other health conditions and the economy and has a clear set of measurable deliverables. Right now, our Government manage Covid, nothing else.
1308017617823817735 2020-09-21 20:17:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> How can Whitty/Vallance say that we are following the same path as France and Spain yet they the jump off that path in their projection to get 5 times as many positive tests? It is this that makes a large proportion of the British public sceptical of their advice.
1307992033727049728 2020-09-21 18:36:16 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The Chief Covid Scientific Adviser and the Chief Covid Medical Adviser did not mention the impact on any other health matters. I’d say it’s too early to move. In the meantime, the false-positive rate should be sorted.
1307982963758555139 2020-09-21 18:00:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Whitty and Vallance have got to convince us that the infection data is reliable, that it evidences significant enough danger to warrant more restrictions now, and that there is no other feasible strategy.
1307944406104801281 2020-09-21 15:27:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate Mr Khan believes the city is just days behind the disease hotspots in the North West and North East of England and said a new lockdown is 'increasingly likely'.

1307789074250559499 2020-09-21 05:09:47 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @timspector I just read about it. It’s an app? So mirrors more those seeking testing more than those testing positive? I had a cold symptoms two weeks ago. It’s the season.
1307786458657415168 2020-09-21 04:59:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @timspector So you do your own random community swabs?

1307780108460097536 2020-09-21 04:34:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @timspector It’s not the same levels as May because there was no community testing in May. That means the May figures were 20 times higher than shwn as only the ill enough to go to hospital, about 5% infected, were tested. We now have community testing so undetected cases are much lower.
1307778288643956739 2020-09-21 04:26:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SadiqKhan You have offered nothing but tighter restrictions and extended the congestion charge. Deluded.

1307640631565705217 2020-09-20 19:19:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I spent 21 years in Government and it is incredibly common for Civil Servants, specialists and Ministers to mis-understand their own data and often the law itself. It is a form of Chinese Whispers: incorrect assumptions are made up and down the chain of command. This is Covid now
1307629062756556800 2020-09-20 18:33:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @juliepooley5 @JuliaHB1 We need to follow the correct interpretation of the data.
1307628616545689600 2020-09-20 18:32:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate 2/ have been 95% of untested infections. The peak now is substantially non-hospitalised cases in the community and there will be nowhere near the number of undetected cases above the peak. That explains lockdown in Bolton with only two people in hospital - we are over-reacting.
1307628027568951296 2020-09-20 18:29:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate 1/ Well said. We also must have a correct interpretation of the data. The chart looks like we are approaching the same position as in March, but that is incorrect. The earlier peak was of hospitalised cases as that was the testing policy at the time. Above that peak would....  https://t.co/iS3sva2F5N
1307627241229213696 2020-09-20 18:26:43 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @juliepooley5 @JuliaHB1 Agree. There is no need at present for lockdown or further restrictions.
1307622391850336257 2020-09-20 18:07:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @juliepooley5 @JuliaHB1 No, there is no reason to do anything now as experts disagree that there is any evidence of a second wave. The proper interpretation of the testing data confirms this.
1307620657316986880 2020-09-20 18:00:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @juliepooley5 @JuliaHB1 2/ the peak now is people not in hospital who have tested positive so there is nowhere near the number of undetected cases above the peak.
1307620363736690691 2020-09-20 17:59:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @juliepooley5 @JuliaHB1 1/ Ok, your thinking is incorrect. The chart looks terrifying but the people in the first peak were mostly in hospital because that was the testing policy at the time. Above the first peak is 95% of infections that did not end up in hospital so were not tested.  https://t.co/sFY3LD8gFf
1307616716911005696 2020-09-20 17:44:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> 5/ This explains why Matt Hancock found it hard to believe when it was pointed out to him on LBC that there were only two people in hospital with Covid in Bolton. The town had just been put under special restrictions as a result of the misinterpretation of this testing data.
1307616479333036034 2020-09-20 17:43:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> 4/ The second peak, however, is mainly people infected but not ill enough to be in hospital and consequently there will be nowhere near the peak of undetected infections above that because testing is available.
1307616194854350849 2020-09-20 17:42:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> 3/ This undetected peak of infection would have been 95% of the peak (the chart shows only 5%) because we know that 95% plus of people who get Covid do not require hospital treatment.
1307615889030819840 2020-09-20 17:41:36 +0800 <mitrebarnet> 2/ The first peak is substantially “medical” cases in hospital as that was the testing policy at the time - very few tests were undertaken in the community.  It is the case, therefore, that there was a huge peak of undetected infection above the first peak.
1307615482397233153 2020-09-20 17:39:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> 1/ This is absolutely terrifying as positive tests in England are now reaching the same level as they were earlier in the year, we need to lockdown now.  WRONG, YOU ARE READING THE CHART INCORRECTLY.  https://t.co/EbvxcZzTQ9
1307615023498493963 2020-09-20 17:38:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @juliepooley5 @JuliaHB1 How close do you think we are to the situation in March?
1307598653054496769 2020-09-20 16:33:07 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JuliaHB1 The testing policy change between the first peak and the second peak is also highly relevant. The first peak is true “cases” as testing was mainly of ill people in hospital - above that is a huge peak of infections of an unknown number. The second peak is mainly infection.
1307492153153785862 2020-09-20 09:29:55 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MichaelYeadon3 2/ The second peak is infections due to the massive increase in testing (and possibly the error rate) and there will be much less undetected infections. It follows that the amount of that much lesser number of infections will not lead to the previous peak of hospital cases.
1307491052899766272 2020-09-20 09:25:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MichaelYeadon3 1/ I think the confusion is due to the difference between infection and cases. The first peak was genuine cases with illness # as testing was limited to hospitals - I saw someone draw a huge peak above that to represent infections which were unknown.  https://t.co/4f4AxJgk3W
1307487989988237318 2020-09-20 09:13:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RockboltG @Mike36796610 I think you have missed a thought. The first peak of positive tests were real cases (in hospital) and in the video you draw a huge peak of infection above that. However, the new peak is of infection - not cases with illness - with a lesser peak above because of increased testing.
1307397017929428994 2020-09-20 03:11:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @JamesDelingpole The only real evidence is hospitalisations and that is in line with protecting the NHS. The tests have no context as the policy and volume has changed throughout and the infection rate has never been known.
1307394401921126400 2020-09-20 03:01:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @SkyNews A media that has pushed a Government sponsored fear agenda for 6 months is calling those protesting against it “conspiracy theorists”. Is the public that stupid?
1307388331882356739 2020-09-20 02:37:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKCovid19Stats That would suggest to me that Bolton, with 2 people in hospital, should not be under lockdown measures. The increased positive tests are only really a possible - definitely not definitive - indicator that infection may or may not be rising as we didn’t know the infection rate.
1307387096668266497 2020-09-20 02:32:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKCovid19Stats If we have never known the infection rate and the testing policy and rate has varied throughout, then none of these figures have any real meaning. Hospitalisations seems to me to be the only reliable data upon which to make decisions - that fits with protecting the NHS.  https://t.co/CLWc7KE5XQ
1307373264654737413 2020-09-20 01:37:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RealDeniseWelch There is none. The infection rate has never been known. The testing policy has changed, capacity has vastly increased and it’s not reliable so it does not necessarily amount to an increase in the infection rate. The only reliable measure can be hospital admissions - 2 in Bolton.  https://t.co/VxcdpHuArQ
1307361584080093188 2020-09-20 00:51:05 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Just to add that would mean that, whilst Bolton has rising positive tests that may or may not reflect a rising infection rate, it would not be subject to restriction because only 2 people are in hospital with Covid.
1307359554414563329 2020-09-20 00:43:01 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The true infection rate has never been known. The testing policy and volume has changed significantly throughout and reliability is questionable. My view is that the only data that is reliable is hospital admissions and that links back to the original aim of saving the NHS.  https://t.co/ZkW6VUjPyZ
1307353110004797441 2020-09-20 00:17:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MichaelYeadon3 If the total infection rate during, prior to and before the peak is unknown and there are so many variables on the testing policy and accuracy throughout, should the main body of evidence upon which to make decisions be hospitalisations?
1307349622176841734 2020-09-20 00:03:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RockboltG @Mike36796610 Dwelling on this:  1. total infections during or previous to 1st peak or now are unknown; 2. testing strategy not consistent and lots of variables; 3. so the only meaningful evidence in this graph is hospitalisations which are increasing. Only 3. can truly guide decision making.
1307305692005568519 2020-09-19 21:09:00 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fleeto91 @kevinrogerjones @RockboltG @Mike36796610 I have not used the data to argue any points - I have simply asked Rich a question. I make no assumptions, I understand how data like this is open to interpretation and I have an open mind as to what is going on.
1307303288984031233 2020-09-19 20:59:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fleeto91 @kevinrogerjones @RockboltG @Mike36796610 I picked it up from a fairly reliable Covid info twitter site that uses official stats - just thought it was interesting, and useful to ask Rich the question. I’m just highlighting the limitations of all the data.
1307299508955553794 2020-09-19 20:44:26 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fleeto91 @kevinrogerjones @RockboltG @Mike36796610 Depends what they count as a Covid admission - is it someone admitted because of Covid symptoms or someone testing positive with Covid on admission regardless of whether they were admitted with a broken leg?
1307298785941508096 2020-09-19 20:41:33 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fleeto91 @kevinrogerjones @RockboltG @Mike36796610 I don’t understand your question. The graph does not show an increase in admissions generally, it shows an increase in Covid labelled admissions.
1307298357874958336 2020-09-19 20:39:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RockboltG @Mike36796610 Thank you. I have to say you explain it well and its hard to disagree with your caution. There’s too much disinformation,  hysteria and knee jerk reaction. Government/media comms is failing to get the key points over.
1307292832701526017 2020-09-19 20:17:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @fleeto91 @kevinrogerjones @RockboltG @Mike36796610 That is a very good question. The most accurate number in the graph has to be hospitalisations - but even that is impacted by whether due to Covid. Obviously there were much greater infections during the peak - and probably now.
1307281250105860100 2020-09-19 19:31:52 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Depends how you define “surging”. I think we need to calmly watch the data and keep perspective on everything including non-Covid health impacts, civil contentment and the economy.  https://t.co/AWgz0v9A4M

1306998893624909824 2020-09-19 00:49:53 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BrokenBarnet @MayorofLondon I’m not arguing that it’s not a dangerous virus. But there is hugely divergent scientific opinion on key matters and that needs to be addressed. With only 2 people in hospital in Bolton and them facing restrictions there is quite clearly a disconnect.
1306996547410898944 2020-09-19 00:40:34 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BrokenBarnet @MayorofLondon This is a simple explanation by a statistician. They seem to be taking the 0.8% error rate as a percentage of the positive tests when it’s a % of tests undertaken. Carl Heneghan has already corrected them on a number of issues. There are 2 people in hospital with Covid in Bolton.  https://t.co/aAtNFrV4cy
1306995668586827777 2020-09-19 00:37:04 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We have got to push the Govt into a full and evidenced review. Professor Carl Heneghan says it’s possible that 8 of every 9 tests are false positives. There’s only 2 people in hospital in Bolton. There is definitely a disconnect between reality and the data being used centrally.
1306994234218733568 2020-09-19 00:31:22 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @ShehabKhan If the testing error that Carl Heneghan has raised is correct then that number reduces to about 480.
1306993647796224001 2020-09-19 00:29:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MayorofLondon @BrokenBarnet The testing false positive rate should be no 1 on the agenda.
1306962672185946113 2020-09-18 22:25:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> The false-positive testing error sounds very plausible and is similar to many of the “simple” errors I encountered in the Civil Service that had humungous impacts. If it transpires, then positive cases are overstated by 88%. This, in itself, would explain low hospitalisations.
1306934432067137536 2020-09-18 20:33:44 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate But even the original furlough scheme generated a cost for holiday pay of 12%. I am forecasting a loss of £230k GP this year, I simply cannot increase that for anything. I will have no option but to make all staff redundant.
1306920501776986113 2020-09-18 19:38:23 +0800 <mitrebarnet> 1. The Govt needs to confirm the accuracy of the tests, which the Scottish Head of Public Health has already said are “a bit rubbish”; 2. There needs to be a complete review of the scientific strategy by the likes of Professor Carl Heneghan; 3. Boris and Hancock need to go now.

1306547826223124481 2020-09-17 18:57:30 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Whitty admitted that the first lockdown had no impact upon the peak at the beginning of April. All lockdown seems to do is spread the pain. We need a fundamental review of the scientific strategy that takes account of all the adverse impacts of any and all control measures.
1306522721753456641 2020-09-17 17:17:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This business will lose £230k gross profit in 2020 - that’s a huge proportion of the money we have to pay the bills. Furlough, grants and rates relief amounts to £60k, leaving a shortfall of £170k. The Govt need to properly justify any further restrictions. @CampaignforPubs
1306493698830749696 2020-09-17 15:22:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @nicholsonprop On the basis of tests that cannot differentiate between live virus and dead virus - and using legislation, the Public Health Act, that is for controlling sick people, not restricting healthy people. No-one, anywhere in our industry or any other is questioning the Govt.

You are politicising minutia whilst the wider health and welfare of the country is being wrecked.

1306234015234633730 2020-09-16 22:10:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @BorisJohnson You are failing on everything. You need to go back to the strategic scientific case for dealing with Covid using a wider pool of scientists than those who have provided advice hitherto.
1306194404600950784 2020-09-16 19:33:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> If they are going to close pubs on the basis of rising positive tests then they need to fix the problem where the tests do not distinguish between live virus that is contagious and dead virus that is not contagious. ⁦@CampaignforPubs⁩   https://t.co/li5u7UOcyI

1306010722309214209 2020-09-16 07:23:15 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate We should be debating the current Covid strategy in its entirety - Furlough is just a consequence of the situation that has been created to manage a virus that is nowhere near as dangerous as when the furlough scheme was created.

Today, standing beside her Chief Medical Adviser who describes Covid tests as “a bit rubbish, she reduced hospitalisations from over 250 to 48 because of a counting error. Not a word about her having been making life hell because of tests and hospitalisations.
1305919533769785344 2020-09-16 01:20:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> We’ve had Govt admissions that tests are unreliable, deaths and hospitalisations over-stated, the Sage modelling has been questioned, we see Sweden, the adverse implications of restrictions are growing - what on earth will it take for a fundamental review of what we are doing?

1304420228026245121 2020-09-11 22:03:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> He’s right, we need scrutiny backed by full information on all of the risks and damage being caused by Covid and restrictions, including the “a bit rubbish” tests that the Govt base decisions on. This is the only way the Govt can win back confidence, hearts and minds.

1304390523826900993 2020-09-11 20:05:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OllyDeed The problem is much wider and deeper than an “unfortunate choice of words” and an “efficacy” of testing.

Public policy on Covid is causing detriment to other health conditions,  widespread economic damage and is fundamentally affecting personal liberties. You don’t see that as problematic?
1304385485557694464 2020-09-11 19:45:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OllyDeed Ok, so now we agree on both points that science has a lot to answer; and the Government has a lot to answer. I hope now you support my original tweet to call for those answers.
1304381723048845313 2020-09-11 19:30:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OllyDeed I’ve obviously read much wider on the science not least papers from and circulated by Carl Heneghan. Science has a lot to answer. The phrase coming from science in Scotland yesterday on testing being “a bit rubbish” says it all IMHO. We agree the Govt also has a lot to answer.
1304376583210381312 2020-09-11 19:09:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @OllyDeed My concern is a lack of evidence/balance/justification to support the decisions being made on Covid restrictions. You troll me on this issue - are you content with the balance of scientific advice and Government decisions?
1304368320876081153 2020-09-11 18:36:56 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It’s time for business, their representatives and people to demand that the Govt calls upon a wider scientific pool of expertise and fully justifies the current and any further measures. We also need absolute clarity around deaths and the “a bit rubbish” Covid tests.
1304359662314303490 2020-09-11 18:02:31 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Court submission: “to require me to order branded glassware direct from their suppliers/brewers and for the Defendant to seek, without a contractual basis, to impose a charge for those orders, that are ordinarily provided for free as standard, is very little short of extortion.
1304352516260474882 2020-09-11 17:34:08 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @UKHospKate @BBCNews You should be stating a position on this as it will damage hospitality. I am lobbying @CampaignforPubs. Evidence on masks is weak especially when continually handled. Govt is not acting with the now split scientific evidence. We need to demand detailed justification for measures.

1304334749641715713 2020-09-11 16:23:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Telegraph @selcamra Then we look at the facts. Less than 50% of positive tests are actually younger people so it’s not the “majority” and the Scottish Public Health Chief describes the tests as “a bit rubbish” because they cannot distinguish between live virus and dead virus. Look at the evidence!!
1304332135361372160 2020-09-11 16:13:09 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @realaleupnorth @JMarkDodds Oh, I might apply, I won’t make that much from the pub this year!!

1304207582366662657 2020-09-11 07:58:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> This is the Scottish Head of Public Health calling the Covid tests “a bit rubbish” because they cannot distinguish between live and dead virus.

There is not necessarily a direct correlation with France. Here’s what Carl Heneghan, Professor of Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University, tweeted earlier:  https://t.co/dqLLvunXZ3
1304182530212614151 2020-09-11 06:18:40 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Prominent experts saying Covid outbreak “essentially over” and criticise the Government’s modelling which assumes no existing immunity which is proved to be wrong. This is not crackpot, it’s experts with evidence. We need to push the Govt to justify their continued restrictions.
1304170994588884992 2020-09-11 05:32:50 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @FunSoph @yelobeli There is no democracy as there is no opposition.
1304060296005382150 2020-09-10 22:12:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> Given inaccuracy of testing, not least 6 St Mirren players with false positives, and no corresponding trend on hospitalisations, it seems extraordinarily disproportionate for Scotland to mandate masks for hospitality at this time. Very damaging to the sector. @CampaignforPubs  https://t.co/FMNmIaMGby
1303720864182083584 2020-09-09 23:44:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman They talk about a virus that I don’t recognise from all the wider stats and viewpoints I have heard from non-Sage scientists like Carl Heneghan.
1303667925581213697 2020-09-09 20:13:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @EssexPR I open until 12 weekdays and 1am weekends. All safe and socially distanced throughout.

1303656843210878977 2020-09-09 19:29:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> With reducing illness and deaths from Covid, and the news that the testing may be picking up dead, non-contagious virus, it really is incumbent upon the Government to provide a detailed analysis of their decisions.  There is increasing exasperation in the UK.

1303476281976270848 2020-09-09 07:32:17 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @KareemNaaman @UKHospKate I am fed up being treated like a child being told what to do with no clear justification.  The Govt need to get the death figures and test results correct. And if they are using France and Spain as evidence we should see a detailed analysis. It’s getting incredulous now.

1303346973156745216 2020-09-08 22:58:28 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @lisanandy @yelobeli Think about what that actually means? It’s not a criminal matter is it? It’s a contractual matter. The contract was for best endeavours to come to a trade agreement - maybe the Govt doesn’t think the EU are meeting their obligations. Alls fair in negotiation.

You need to talk about these matters.
1303319389845049355 2020-09-08 21:08:51 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Robin_Eveleigh I agree. Thus far the danger/death rate of the virus has been overstated, the actual deaths are known to be over-stated and now we have the tests picking up non-contagious past cases. It is undoubtedly not the virus the scientists thought it was.
1303301532507607042 2020-09-08 19:57:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @MichaelYeadon3 Van Tam et al do not seem to be moving because it presumably undermines the position they have taken from the outset and raises questions as to how the country and the world has been led to massive destruction.
1303298458170916869 2020-09-08 19:45:41 +0800 <mitrebarnet> I am going to Court with @greenekingcares. They have introduced new charges for branded glassware for tied beer that they previously provide for free. I have to order these glasses direct from GK’s beer suppliers and then GK will levy a charge to me doing so! Greedy King.

1303037761981743104 2020-09-08 02:29:46 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RichardBurgon What about the harms to public health and the economy of extreme lockdown - and all the questions about the reliability of the death data and testing? Your ignorance and stupidity proves we still don’t have the effective opposition that we need for true democracy.
1302995096548380673 2020-09-07 23:40:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> If this is true it’s a massive error that has cost the world dearly. But good news in that in most countries we should not expect to see many more fatalities from Covid. Government needs to address this and all the other anomalies.   https://t.co/nG1fEpFhv3

1302944041039003654 2020-09-07 20:17:21 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RealDeniseWelch Don’t stop. You’ve given a voice to normal people who have lots of questions. I run a pub and I’d say 98% of my customers think the same way as you.
1302646855675805697 2020-09-07 00:36:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Or you can either be adult and accept that Denise and others are looking for clarity and proportion for the benefit of everyone - or childish and divisive by calling people Covidiots. I guess your position on this one is clear.
1302605857939763200 2020-09-06 21:53:32 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan Do you think for a second that maybe, just maybe, you are the hysterical one?
1302571352965238791 2020-09-06 19:36:25 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @millionsandwill @ermatruth I think this tweet tells people more about your ignorance than it does about the intelligent questions people are legitimately asking about the analysis and management of Covid, the single biggest impact the world has seen for decades.
1302337764759920640 2020-09-06 04:08:14 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @Mikemaco @RealDeniseWelch I have no idea who you are and you clearly do not know me. Asking questions and liking a particular tweet about the sham management of Covid does not constitute a siding with any extreme views! People are too quick these days to label.

1302211926315986944 2020-09-05 19:48:11 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It’s clear lots of workers seem to prefer at least some home working. There is an opportunity to build communities rather than business districts and commuter belts. That needs Govt intervention in the out-dated and unbalanced commercial and residential property markets.
1302035774465101824 2020-09-05 08:08:13 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @PaulVCooper1 @GazHigh @OllyDeed @LindaRiley8 @RealDeniseWelch And therein lies the flaw in your thinking that this is simply a matter of epidemiology. Covid and it’s response is a much bigger medical, socio-political and financial issue that requires much wider analysis and consideration spanning a wide range of specialisms.
1302018349409472517 2020-09-05 06:58:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> It’s a disgrace that we are allowing a Govt to keep businesses closed without full financial support. I really don’t know how nightclub owners are (a) coping financially; or (b) coping mentally with the stress of it. I had had enough with 4 months of closure. @CampaignforPubs

1301897317277143043 2020-09-04 22:58:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan You are despicable to suggest that the legitimate questions Denise asks about Covid are in any way related to her mental illness. It is people like you, a perpetual Covid fear monger, that is causing mental illness to rise.

1301838645104697345 2020-09-04 19:04:54 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @RealDeniseWelch You were brilliant. Just asking the questions we all want answered.

Are you a fully paid up member of the Nazi party or is that just who you lend your support to?

1301835135185309697 2020-09-04 18:50:57 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @piersmorgan She’s asking the questions that millions are asking - and you want to silence her in favour of the fear propaganda that you spout?

1301682326183632897 2020-09-04 08:43:45 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @NicolaSturgeon It’s hard to put into words how badly you have managed this. No clear risk assessment, no targeted strategy, no 360 degree perspective of the damage of restrictions, inconsistent messaging and policies. It’s fear, control and destruction. You are to blame for losing people.
1301679984965279745 2020-09-04 08:34:27 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @HedleyLamarr20 @zoeharcombe @RealDeniseWelch I don’t disagree with any of that. But science seems unable to commit at the current stage which is causing the continued restrictions.
1301599355397263361 2020-09-04 03:14:03 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @zoeharcombe @RealDeniseWelch The problem is that the Government scientists are unable to explain why deaths are no longer happening and thus, whether significant deaths will return. It’s a huge gamble for any Govt to return to normal if there is no certainty that normal will not lead to a huge rise in deaths

1301214806620467201 2020-09-03 01:45:59 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @pubscodepca Advice to tenants really ought to explain the difference between contractual and Pubs Code disputes as there are better and cheaper Court options for most disputes.  Tenants should also be aware that Code Compliance Officers are not independent as they are employed by POBs.
1300946836291813377 2020-09-02 08:01:10 +0800 <mitrebarnet> @mikerainham I agree, need to balance other untreated medical conditions too.
1300892890709856259 2020-09-02 04:26:49 +0800 <mitrebarnet> And this is what I meant by we are in limbo because of the unknown science position. This guy speaks sense: it will either fizzle out, there will be local outbreaks or a full blown second wave. We need to carry on opening up and see what happens because otherwise we will not know
