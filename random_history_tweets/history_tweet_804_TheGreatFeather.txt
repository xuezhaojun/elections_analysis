1342187701714485251 2020-12-25 03:17:39 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> We are at the time of the year when the media starts the 2020 recap down memory lane. Do we really want to be reminded of the 2020 highlights? We don’t need any reminders to not forget.
1342165020038344707 2020-12-25 01:47:31 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> In case you did not realize it, people who were crucified for having the courage to join the rare people in history as genuine heroes, have been rewarded for their undying loyalty. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for the pardons.

1341802638657122311 2020-12-24 01:47:33 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> It isn’t about foreign aid...it’s about foreign aid INSTEAD of decent aid to actual Americans. It’s about priorities.

1340449052153028611 2020-12-20 08:08:53 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @realLesHoy I trust nothing these days.
1340444774063628292 2020-12-20 07:51:53 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 I read more contagious, not more deadly. Britain's medical research is sophisticated. Global travel will bring the new strain here in weeks, for sure.
1340443951795482625 2020-12-20 07:48:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @markh1797 That 70% more contagious is from Oxford in Britain, the CDC is defunct and useless - see how well they have managed their primary function this year? Discover and contain emerging diseases and epidemics?
1340442911264092160 2020-12-20 07:44:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @realLesHoy Are you saying the MSM is hyping the covid fears? 🤣🤣
1340438711763431424 2020-12-20 07:27:47 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @realLesHoy Only people who have had a bad case or are personally acquainted with someone who has had a bad case, or front line workers who see the worst cases, believe the Covid virus is bad.
1340435539338653696 2020-12-20 07:15:11 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 Weather occasionally interrupts my power, but never interferes with my daily life. Having a good snow on Christmas Eve is a sentimental experience. Good emotions &amp; silence.
1340434382197321728 2020-12-20 07:10:35 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @cymoo1 You can dig on the CDC site for buried flu stats. Covid has taken the front page. Also, COVID, if there is a positive test, moves the DRG. It gives all diagnoses more weight for enhanced reimbursement. Some stats are coming from the insurance companies.
1340428304675966976 2020-12-20 06:46:26 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 Look at my Christmas Eve forcast 👏👏👏  https://t.co/MGbtdSky3y
1340427377566953477 2020-12-20 06:42:45 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 The answer would require a dissertation. Can you narrow the subject a little? 🤣🤣

1340396159551070208 2020-12-20 04:38:42 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @cymoo1 The stats for flu get no press. I know a person who had both A&amp;B and Covid at the same time but only the Covid was published in the stats. Like many Corona and flu strains, there is mutation - usually less virulent.
1340390842931023873 2020-12-20 04:17:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> What a flip flop! How many ways can those in power reinstitute segregation? Racism 'Is All About' Separation Based on Race.   https://t.co/S9ZmGxVdEA

1335613444058456071 2020-12-06 23:53:54 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @suzinthedesert The large box stores have already put so many small businesses out of business. These goliath companies are huge donors. 2 + 2 = 5
1335611536384143363 2020-12-06 23:46:19 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 Hey 🙋‍♀️
1335609971178958848 2020-12-06 23:40:06 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Early fog... Good morning.  https://t.co/3qFsTJLDfm
1335437542745890816 2020-12-06 12:14:56 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike @NoviceInvesto10 I noticed you have a lot of ”promotion” tweets, Mike. That is new. Are you commercialized now? How much do they pay to advertise on your account? Sign me up.
1335433884423565317 2020-12-06 12:00:23 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Luke17_37 @gleneverley I understand. Not meaning to educate anyone...just a stupid, meaningless tweet. Not at all serious about the rapture.
1335380691652141056 2020-12-06 08:29:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @ThePBLPodcast The elites want us drunk and stoned apparently.

1335372425354162178 2020-12-06 07:56:10 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> After 9 months, the CDC says shopping in big stores is dangerous? That 50% of the spread is from shopping in grocery stores, home improvement stores, etc.? Stay home period? What the hell are we supposed to do with that?
1335360566114836480 2020-12-06 07:09:03 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @gleneverley I did not tweet that as fact - just as a conversation starter. No one on earth knows how or when...Interpretations of scripture are a dime a dozen. I certainly do not know anything except Jesus is Lord.
1335356867107819522 2020-12-06 06:54:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike Do it?  https://t.co/EIDGEUMwWJ
1335353974111805442 2020-12-06 06:42:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I will tell you straight up! The lettered agency tasked with controlling a pandemic in America is the CDC &amp; they failed the nation astronomically! The CDC did not want to contain it!
1335351096995422208 2020-12-06 06:31:25 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MarthaKellum2 I cannot say what I want to... Is this America anymore?
1335304955935207424 2020-12-06 03:28:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @andyBlackmon1 Who knows? No one mentions the possibility of a slow ”rapture” via covid deaths either.
1335302583578210305 2020-12-06 03:18:39 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @scambyarussian Only if you have a wallet card to prove they injected the Kool-Aid?
1335300904585715714 2020-12-06 03:11:59 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @brillianttrave1 Yes... In every way necessary. If it comes to what I lack, if I am overcome in some way, then it will be a world I don’t want to live in. I am not afraid to die.
1335298355879178241 2020-12-06 03:01:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MarthaKellum2 My gut tells me we are in for it...such uncharted water we can’t imagine what is yet to come.

1335292799420407813 2020-12-06 02:39:46 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Obvious. There is no logic to this. These restrictions and lockdowns do not make sense!
1335270938745712640 2020-12-06 01:12:54 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> There is no evidence-based logic to these rules.
1335267760956387329 2020-12-06 01:00:16 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Can the vaccine become the mark that permits you to work, go to school, shop, get medical treatment, buy and sell? Farfetched? No. It is here.

1334598275085852680 2020-12-04 04:39:59 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Both GOP Senate candidates are in a great position to win if cheating is not allowed!
1334596857264287757 2020-12-04 04:34:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> It is leftist bigotry, democrat racism. Half of America knows the truth! It has ALWAYS been democrats that oppress &amp; denigrate minorities!

1334579677936095232 2020-12-04 03:26:05 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> No one will believe that the shots they receive are the same as what the deplorables will be given. Our trust is zero.

1332413695918477318 2020-11-28 03:59:14 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @brillianttrave1 👏👏👏👏
1332412998074425345 2020-11-28 03:56:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Being alone does not mean lonely...it is putting yourself first for a while. It is reducing conflict and emotional drain to a minimum. Bliss for some.
1332411460954304512 2020-11-28 03:50:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Now or never. Without major changes, there will be no honest elections.
1332409726882222081 2020-11-28 03:43:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Hand-outs and government gimme charity is random and pot luck. A job where you work every day is sure. The turtle wins the race, not the hare.
1332408198268121090 2020-11-28 03:37:24 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> We better go to strictly authorized absentee ballots and in-person paper ballots -no machines- to ensure election integrity - or we will always be a banana republic going forward.
1332406391231963143 2020-11-28 03:30:13 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @abraceswith5 Do you believe only dumb, ugly women can be introverted?
1332405401447489537 2020-11-28 03:26:17 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @CitizenState1 @petetalking But I am not lonely
1332402612826763264 2020-11-28 03:15:12 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> The writing is on the wall. What a horrific display of corruption...
1332367584910512133 2020-11-28 00:56:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @churchill_66 That is precious.
1332365219784486913 2020-11-28 00:46:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @DenSow57 @petetalking Exactly! I have a huge twitter family.
1332363264509009925 2020-11-28 00:38:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MarthaKellum2 And I was so glad! Alone is heaven for introverts like me.

1332360360855293958 2020-11-28 00:27:18 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @petetalking I was totally alone too. I received no calls but I called two 90-year-olds who were also alone.
1332359822092759040 2020-11-28 00:25:10 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MiroGec65 Morning Venet! Thank you for a glimpse into your world.

1331792939304034315 2020-11-26 10:52:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MichaelFDowning @DC_Draino The poles shifted! The magnetic field just switched Biden to Trump. Biden is not the elect of a damn thing but his basement. Tech and the media are impotent!
1331791092879142913 2020-11-26 10:45:14 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I am so grateful for Trump!
1331786479140548610 2020-11-26 10:26:54 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @GtimmermGarrett @Halotx17 Trump is keeping things close to the vest. Saying very little. Understanding just one path, the House role per constitution, lifted a huge weight off on me.
1331784885397311492 2020-11-26 10:20:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @GoldenHawk61 Today is the first day I have breathed a sigh of relief.

1331782407738023937 2020-11-26 10:10:43 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @GoldenHawk61 Good night
1331779007428366337 2020-11-26 09:57:13 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Thank you all for sticking by me when I could barely see  a glimmer of hope. I See the light now.

1331756057325088773 2020-11-26 08:26:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @BluDino @GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump I believe it was stolen by the dirtiest pukes that ever took  a breath &amp; I Believe in miracles.
1331754057803976709 2020-11-26 08:18:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MaryPurifoy13 Time to smile again.
1331753188920274951 2020-11-26 08:14:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 The election! My president's 2nd term! I am finally moving out of denial to mad enough to eat a green fly!
1331750770987970561 2020-11-26 08:05:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @EngOnDemand I know. But it removes the anvils off of Flynn's and his family's necks. It lifts some weight off me knowing he is free.
1331749450902073344 2020-11-26 07:59:46 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @East40Sooner 🤣🤣🤣
1331714061621399554 2020-11-26 05:39:08 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Wrap Flynn's pardon around a two by four and shove it up Judge Sullivan's arsh as you leave his dastardly faux courtroom. What a basturd that judge is!
1331708425890385923 2020-11-26 05:16:45 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> My great hero General Flynn is finally free! Pardoned by my hero President Donald Trump! Happy Thanksgiving @GenFlynn !!! Thank you @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/rckLrDB4Bx
1331705572064890887 2020-11-26 05:05:24 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Adapting according to what is required...
1331704226750361602 2020-11-26 05:00:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Finally, a pair in the judicial system.
1331701510552555526 2020-11-26 04:49:16 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Because BO is back for his third term! Albatros that he is. .. Obama lives almost next door to the WH &amp; he will be at "work" every day. God help us if we can't turn the election around!
1331698547419471874 2020-11-26 04:37:30 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Yes, I had grief over the election, shock, and disbelief that it was not an indisputable, overwhelming landslide for Trump - that massive cheating nationwide happened with impunity. It has taken me 3 weeks to get past that.
1331695805082767373 2020-11-26 04:26:36 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @EngOnDemand It is as spoken. Next fight Georgia Senate race &amp; opposition to every word of every policy the liberals want to shove down my throat. I will NOT stop fighting for my country!
1331693784132939777 2020-11-26 04:18:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I am back. I worked through my grief. It was aggravated burglary, grand larceny. Should I be miserable that my prize possession was stolen or can I be OK and move on? #NextFightPlease
1331689225360715792 2020-11-26 04:00:27 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> During the depression, there were food lines while there were many hungry people too proud to stand in one. America has changed dramatically - Mercedes &amp; new SUVs wait 5 hours with trunks open for miles.
1331685253715550208 2020-11-26 03:44:40 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Not sorry. I worked and paid in full for 10 years of college, including a graduate degree. I do not want to pay a dime in taxes to bail college students out of the college debt they are carrying. Fuck that!
1331683543425150985 2020-11-26 03:37:52 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Michael33607037 The acorn and walnut harvest is pitiful this year.
1331674800465600515 2020-11-26 03:03:08 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Forget about the illuminati of old...big tech and the media are selecting the president, not the voters.
1331671277740945408 2020-11-26 02:49:08 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Tucker: If the democrats win Georgia, they will do EVERYTHING they want to do without any checks &amp; balances. America as we knew it will be gone. We The People, patriots, are literally the last line of defense. Donate and/or Vote!

1331063345219330051 2020-11-24 10:33:26 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> One of a kind. Once in many lifetimes. I love Donald Trump. Trump is my PRESIDENT. Will be out of town tomorrow---&gt;all day. Have a good night.  https://t.co/pKIUSWqRRW
1331053726732333064 2020-11-24 09:55:12 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Winchesterae It is all my fault 😂😂😂
1331052907651870721 2020-11-24 09:51:57 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> How? I have &amp; am donating big time - I voted &amp; will vote again for Loeffler &amp; Perdue - I have campaigned as much as I can humanly do (7 days a week) ... I have called congressional leaders - I am resisting liberalism 100% - what else can I do?
1331050052568162312 2020-11-24 09:40:36 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @laneyg60 @Lahofen I will fight every move the liberals make to change America but first I am fighting to prevent that from happening.
1331049363188150272 2020-11-24 09:37:52 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Winchesterae The fight is not over but Trump has given an inch to the transition team.
1331048869803790336 2020-11-24 09:35:54 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @HenryLeledog I will vote early and in person. I am voting for Perdue and Loeffler. I am voting to save the senate!
1331029951248801793 2020-11-24 08:20:44 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @laneyg60 @Lahofen I am keeping my personal American values, rights, and vision of the future intact. I will not give up!
1331028163787448321 2020-11-24 08:13:38 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @grapenutpudding @POTUS No, it is not over by any means but it is giving an inch of ground we have fought like hell to keep. The election is being stolen and the GSA has a gun to their heads &amp; tremendous pressure from the corrupt liberal machine.
1331024224354521090 2020-11-24 07:57:58 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike Hey Mike  https://t.co/g3k8dNw1qo

1331005548674879490 2020-11-24 06:43:46 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I shared Life, Liberty, and Levin’s 11-22-20 show link on twitter. A powerful expose’ of the current state of our union and what to expect. It has been taken down...#StateOfTheUnion
1331003381926801410 2020-11-24 06:35:09 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @pwrcorrupts What a great loss! No one is allowed to discuss the constitution or anything that does not mirror the left ideology!

1330950480906817537 2020-11-24 03:04:57 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Bobwhitethebird Biden is not president! He is throwing bread crumbs to his base by announcing his day-one plans.
1330943591246663684 2020-11-24 02:37:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> If you missed Levin last night, watch now, the whole show. Be prepared to feel at a gut level...this is the bottom line.  https://t.co/vGNHlTNbaJ
1330939677600321537 2020-11-24 02:22:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> So Biden announces gun confiscation today and $200 fines, taxes on gun owners, for your first SCOTUS fight, and he says it will be by executive order. Donate and/or vote for Perdue &amp; Loeffler!

1328775903904718855 2020-11-18 03:03:57 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Masks and lockdowns have not stopped the spread of the 99% survivable covid. They do not mention the 99% that recover - they handpick examples of the worst-case scenarios out of the 1%...By design and plan.

1328763522516398081 2020-11-18 02:14:45 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> So, the government takes advantage of America’s short attention span by moving slow over months, and even years, so people forget. Conservatives have longer memories than liberals.
1328757248244523009 2020-11-18 01:49:49 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> ”Content Moderators” is the new softer title of ”censors.” There is no difference when  changing ”swamps” to ”rain forests.” ”Global warming” changed to ”climate change” which we see every day.

1326347123328217094 2020-11-11 10:12:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> You see the radical EOs Biden has told the press to publish, like our worst fears already? There are 71M plus voters that said no to that rape of jobs &amp; prosperity! We fight to the bitter end no matter how ugly...We will never surrender! Trump!

1326265028820004864 2020-11-11 04:46:38 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Who really knows Trump? Is he smart enough to pick his battles? Would he choose a hopeless fight?

1324912073650937857 2020-11-07 11:10:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Jillibean557 Hell, at last count, I was on 54 lists.
1324908859937447944 2020-11-07 10:57:42 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> We are all still standing! The words ”quit” and ”regret” are not in our language! Fight is in our DNA. We will never surrender!
1324906060101070848 2020-11-07 10:46:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Jeepen_LewisE 😱😱
1324905664691449857 2020-11-07 10:45:00 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @JOJOJOHN4852 She is not a fighter. Collins is a fighter. However, she is conservative and will be 100% better than that damn  ”reverend” democrat running against her.  Not my first choice but a sight better than any liberal! Vote!
1324895974360113152 2020-11-07 10:06:30 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Good night ... New day tomorrow - promise.  https://t.co/23oiYOFMd1
1324895953220849664 2020-11-07 10:06:25 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @PonyExp77275710 🤷‍♀️
1324881669556490240 2020-11-07 09:09:39 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @PonyExp77275710 He must make it through the inauguration, right?
1324880407515508736 2020-11-07 09:04:38 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> People are lashing out in anger we all feel. Anyone that thinks you are the summation, or defined by, a few tweets does not know you at all, certainly not as I do. Don’t sweat the small stuff or the small people for that matter. Keep Trucking!
1324878319729389571 2020-11-07 08:56:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike Two Senators in Georgia must be victorious in a run-off: Next is making sure our Senate Firewall is sealed tight to prevent radical liberal policies from becoming law! While we wait for POTUS! Adding more Reps to the House too. Donate!  https://t.co/RaPTnotdWs
1324876151681142786 2020-11-07 08:47:44 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Gave 10 large to Perdue’s run-off to help him win. Loeffler does not worry me so much because the 20% Collins votes will slide to her. We, in Georgia, still have to fight - please don’t forget the Senate is a firewall to gross, radical liberal policies. Donate &amp; vote! FIGHT!  https://t.co/WYJfX9Nktr
1324871956525707271 2020-11-07 08:31:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I am with you on that! The damn criminal cabal is/has run this mass &amp; will pile in. Obama’s cabinet picks would be next if Biden wins.
1324870711991799811 2020-11-07 08:26:07 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Doubt he lasts longer than 6 months.

1324847647690248199 2020-11-07 06:54:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Who told you the possibility of losing one race means the war is over? So many are leaving me and even Twitter? The battles for this country have just begun! The number of fights ahead are countless; I will fight on! Get another gear! Start here 👇  https://t.co/rLaTj0adaH
1324845973324050435 2020-11-07 06:47:49 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @ChrissyCmc ❤️
1324843368078331904 2020-11-07 06:37:28 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 More weight, Tx. When an innocent pastor was accused of being a witch in Salem, and they demanded he admit to it by laying heavy rocks on his chest, he kept saying ”more weight” until he smothered to death. 😢
1324841647994212353 2020-11-07 06:30:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @bronson69 I can say for sure he will never be my president.
1324840134748053516 2020-11-07 06:24:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @dlnarch @jeromegravesbm1 The whole democrat machine wants control...I am sick. America is being irreparably screwed - no good can come from liberal rule. Having gained in the house and keeping the senate &amp; SCOTUS is the only redeeming value.
1324834910478213123 2020-11-07 06:03:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Our nation is bitterly divided and has been true for far longer than the Trump presidency. That will NOT change with this election. I will never unify with Biden.
1324833139097772035 2020-11-07 05:56:49 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 I want something to change! How are we allowing a few liberal cities to dictate to predominately red states to control our country? Nauseating! I am pissed off about it!
1324831252457967616 2020-11-07 05:49:19 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @LoneTurtle2 @FuctupMike @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn It is OK - we are square! I have a long list of pardons I want to see. Assange &amp; Snowden after Flynn. These people did nothing wrong! Whistleblowing is encouraged! Flynn committed no crime!
1324825852148879364 2020-11-07 05:27:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @3104JOE @FuctupMike Kinda like a fuct with triple condoms on?
1324823897582292992 2020-11-07 05:20:05 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Trump is a hero in a league of own! There never has been,  and never will be, another like him in the world! The very best of the very best!
1324822593753538562 2020-11-07 05:14:55 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @LoneTurtle2 @FuctupMike @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn Oh hell yes he can! Nixon was not convicted but was pardoned!
1324821666309001220 2020-11-07 05:11:13 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @quantum7ock2 @FuctupMike Trump is facing far more than any one of his supporters. Give him a break.
1324818722662567940 2020-11-07 04:59:32 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I am losing followers for some of the same reasons. No one loves Trump more than I do or has put in more campaign time on Twitter for him. I am, however, a realist that is strong enough to face the raw truth when it comes time IF it comes to that. Georgia is red.
1324804852623515648 2020-11-07 04:04:25 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> In my opinion, more than any segment of our population, military absentee ballots should be counted FIRST, in every state. RED FRIDAY!  https://t.co/33oWRxDvDN
1324802346090700800 2020-11-07 03:54:27 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> In-person votes, early or on election day and requested absentee ballots arriving on or before the election, are legal ballots. The poop piles start getting high with so-called ”mail-in” ballots; this is where a large, evil swamp creature lives.
1324797073741533184 2020-11-07 03:33:30 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @swagmastersintl If you are so sure of your win, why are you name-calling and attacking me? So, ”Methinks he doth protest too much.”
1324795956697640961 2020-11-07 03:29:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MiNameIs_Jeff2 @Gods_Warrior91 I will be without a president for four years if Biden wins. The Philadelphia mayor can kiss my grits!
1324790624990728200 2020-11-07 03:07:53 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> I would say more today, but there is no wi-fi in limbo. Staying calm inside a full beast mode is no small feat.  https://t.co/lB2phL2Ctp
1324769054389882880 2020-11-07 01:42:10 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Shem_Infinite And get that pardon pen going.

1324562362079334400 2020-11-06 12:00:50 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike Sharpies bleed through all paper.
1324561922407190529 2020-11-06 11:59:06 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike I agree with that statement 100%. Already, I have to vote in a run-off for Perdue  &amp; Loeffler to save the Senate majority as a firewall against radical leftist policies! Huge donation to Perdue today!
1324555489632505856 2020-11-06 11:33:32 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Halotx17 Good night Tx

1324518176013639681 2020-11-06 09:05:16 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @anderson4HOF Apathy will set in for me, if it hasn’t already.
1324510932190584836 2020-11-06 08:36:29 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Beautiful sunset! No matter the election results, nature is always breathtaking &amp; I am content with whatever comes. I am rarely governed by emotions. Good night.  https://t.co/Tmli4bMKLr
1324489576006692868 2020-11-06 07:11:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @JoeAmerica_ @catturd2 OAN is good but lacks talent.
1324488599811796993 2020-11-06 07:07:44 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @peppermint_patt @catturd2 Starting TODAY!
1324488305333948417 2020-11-06 07:06:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Real journalists, objective truth-tellers. If Trump has learned anything, he knows the news today is FAKE. There is a market for trusted news.
1324485838328242182 2020-11-06 06:56:46 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @chesapeakemark I pre-bought 550 gallons. The Senate will be a firewall for dramatic policy shifts; we gained seats in the House which will slow drama there, and we have SCOTUS! Not much will change for a long while.
1324481185989435397 2020-11-06 06:38:17 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MerkelPatty You can’t script life like your own movie. I have lived through a lot of sudden changes in events so I know life is uncertain...
1324474955854217228 2020-11-06 06:13:31 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Life goes on. Win or lose, the sun rises &amp; sets on another day. I do not put all my eggs in one basket. I hedge my investment so I am never devastated by any outcome. That is why I am at peace today and tomorrow.  https://t.co/ZO8DKtLsNQ
1324465956320612352 2020-11-06 05:37:46 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @GrantFelldin I have lost 300 - I had 30.1k - I do know a few here exclusively for politics that have left,  voluntarily, because the election is over.  I am here until certification but by a thread 😂😂
1324460981754482689 2020-11-06 05:18:00 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @ThomasPfeifer20 A tiny number of liberal cities, densely populated, are in control of a state that is predominately red. PA is a perfect example: 61 red counties with only 6 liberal blue counties.
1324457870830817280 2020-11-06 05:05:38 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @1_Carolina_Girl @VegasFashnista I believe they do.
1324448490399895553 2020-11-06 04:28:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> The electoral college was established to prevent a few states from determining the future of the country. What you STILL see is a few blue specks, packed like sardines, controlling the majority of red-state counties. This needs to change!
1324444739605770240 2020-11-06 04:13:27 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @TaylorRMarshall @vanderfk So says Stalin  https://t.co/1OQ20Qfgpf
1324441148455354368 2020-11-06 03:59:11 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @lscholl00 I have never thought for one minute that Biden was the POTUS candidate. He will not be running this country if he wins.
1324437774519410688 2020-11-06 03:45:46 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Lady_E_88 The house has lost seats under her leadership...time to change leadership.
1324437372046659584 2020-11-06 03:44:11 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @sons1991 😂😂
1324434967657652224 2020-11-06 03:34:37 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> No matter the results, there is no mandate in America for either side. We are a country sliced half in two by a razor cut margin. That is sad. There is no majority anymore.
1324433319715622914 2020-11-06 03:28:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Can we at least defeat Piglosi as a speaker? Damn, I am tired of that loony hag?
1324419367614976005 2020-11-06 02:32:38 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Tom72415976 Mind reading. Looking at a ballot that is not certain and determining what the voter intended with the vote. Uncertain votes should not be counted. Florida in 2000 coined that concept.
1324414390825832452 2020-11-06 02:12:51 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Trump is a fighter that hates to lose &amp; we love him for that! Don’t be surprised if, win or lose, he will be swinging to the death - to the last drop of blood, to the last bullet...
1324412116577693700 2020-11-06 02:03:49 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @JRCollins7 Hard to do with such mass confusion. 😂😂
1324410652195233792 2020-11-06 01:58:00 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Now we are back to voter intent in Georgia...mind reading. Can’t make this up.

1324408339418271746 2020-11-06 01:48:49 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> How is this any different than hanging chads and dimples in Florida? For those of us that lived through that, this is the same weeds we are in. Sausage is being made and it is not pleasant to watch.
1324407382093500418 2020-11-06 01:45:00 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @EricJayeson65 Not being shown on MSM boards or reflected in the Trump electoral counts.

1324133861614325760 2020-11-05 07:38:08 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @JeremyRudd4 Except, there is that Pesky GOP majority in the Senate.
1324126968233734144 2020-11-05 07:10:44 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Matthew50095058 Yez. Alaska will go to Trump
1324114960016908288 2020-11-05 06:23:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Why the drag out? Trump will win Penn, NC, and Ga. That places him at 265 and Biden at 264 - each needing a single state to win. Razor wire finish. AZ 11 electoral votes and NV 6 electoral votes. Jeez, it is 2020.
1324102329847697415 2020-11-05 05:32:50 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> In federal elections, there should be uniformity in election decision. Any change in election laws nust not be made in an election year.

1324098397784231936 2020-11-05 05:17:13 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @chesapeakemark I must look at the good, at least today...One day at a time...
1324097416644202502 2020-11-05 05:13:19 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @CameraPhyllis @chesapeakemark Of course!
1324093086553747458 2020-11-05 04:56:06 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @Storoit I let go of any chance of justice a long time ago, even if Trump wins.
1324092393776447489 2020-11-05 04:53:21 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @SpvendorWayne No, I do not know.
1324092007128715266 2020-11-05 04:51:49 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @SATempleton No, hope is not lost. But looking at the worst-case scenario cushions the possible blow if Trump does not win and allays my fear for my country. I am a realist.
1324089079085096960 2020-11-05 04:40:11 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @MikeRod27776928 Proving it enough to change an election is tough. No one on Twitter loves Trump more than I do or wants four more years more than I - challenges are rarely successful.
1324085652472942592 2020-11-05 04:26:34 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Recounts and legal challenges are defensive, not offensive...  https://t.co/NygO8MTncP
1324069184695926784 2020-11-05 03:21:08 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> We have held the senate, increased the representatives in the house, have the SCOTUS, so our way of life is secured from radical liberal policies and socialism. Want a Trump win real bad but all is not lost if he does not.

1319035671718264832 2020-10-22 05:59:45 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @iKappaTango When I tap the RT symbol, it automatically, AND ONLY, goes to RT with comment. I cannot RT a tweet as it is. So, expect 100% of my RTs to get my 2 cents 😂😂
1319033673266716675 2020-10-22 05:51:48 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @smbthomas It no longer gives me that option... I am given no choice.

1317189805726367750 2020-10-17 03:44:56 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> How do we know when any news story that cites sources that are not named, and thus not able to be verified, is not from facts that were obtained by a hacker?  https://t.co/v89yAnVm67

1316760260040953859 2020-10-15 23:18:04 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Freedom of the press and freedom of speech are being infringed by SM to influence the election in favor of Biden. This close to the election, should someone not file an emergency injunction?

1316753658437079040 2020-10-15 22:51:50 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Nancy, there are dead-ends in Biden’s neurocircuitry and one dead-end is the word ”Senator,” stuck at one major intersection &amp; cannot move forward to POTUS.

1315693167170277377 2020-10-13 00:37:50 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Democrats arguing cases before a nominee for SCOTUS? What kind of ’advise and consent’  hearing is this? Those debate topics belong to Congress not in a SCOTUS hearing.

1314676962498170882 2020-10-10 05:19:48 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Biden is a trojan horse bringing an extreme liberal into the WH as POTUS. Biden has served as placeholder until after being elected ... Liberals, conservatives, &amp; independents ALL KNOW BIDEN is UNFIT to be POTUS.
1314673667146743815 2020-10-10 05:06:42 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Georgia and Texas are RED. They are not in play.

1313932747807879168 2020-10-08 04:02:33 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Well, you do know the few who have told the truth are completely scrubbed from all news sources &amp; SM platforms. They not only face backlash for the truth but are 100% shut down.
1313929653191667712 2020-10-08 03:50:15 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> And the numbers don’t impress you?

1313519173050527746 2020-10-07 00:39:09 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Trump is an eternal optimist. It shows in every speech, every crisis, all negotiations, all policy disputes. Trump, and all real Americans, doesn’t want to live in constant gloom &amp; doom which leaves us all without hope.

1313267235692204040 2020-10-06 07:58:02 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> Every US Citizen in America has a line-item veto about every detail of medical info that can be released to the public including zero by HIPAA LAW. Also who specifically can hear it. Usually, it is ”stable,”  serious,” or ”critical” only. We had far more transparency with Trump.

1313253694310354955 2020-10-06 07:04:14 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> How much more empathy and compassion can Trump show than facing the fear of Covid with symptoms and an uncertain course, just like all Americans? The outcome in Oct 2020 is better than in March 2020 BECAUSE OF HIS ACTIONS in Operation Warp Speed. Open America!

1313179100325064705 2020-10-06 02:07:49 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> If President Trump had been sick, silent, and unseen after being diagnosed with Covid, the media would have reported secret burial speculations. As it is, we see that getting Covid is not the end of the world or an  inability to govern/work if you catch Covid. Open America.

1306043111223812096 2020-09-16 09:31:57 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike Did he just push a ”play” button on his own little recorder device from 1990?
1306041843856089088 2020-09-16 09:26:55 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @FuctupMike Seems both people there to hear him clapped...

1306026563155222531 2020-09-16 08:26:12 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> With heavy rain and wind, while the trees are in full foliage...well, it is a bad combo I have lived through before. I am well prepared for anything.

The last tropical storm to hit the mountains took one million trees down (Opal 1995) and most were without power for 1-3 weeks; if it comes, I would be off twitter.

Knowing the virus was bad, but not knowing how it would unfold, he did the right thing by delaying info.

Loving was deeply painful for me only when I revealed it, seeing a lack of return... And so, in order to survive, I did not stop loving, I merely concealed it. One hand shown, two hidden.

1300820543285989378 2020-09-01 23:39:20 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> We are about to find out if the family, specifically the mother, of Blake really wants peace and non-violence. If she does not meet with the POTUS, she doesn’t. She talks unity but we will see if she means it.
1300815653310521346 2020-09-01 23:19:54 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @garrison_papa The fearmongering convinced most that mandates were implemented to protect them - with little mention of the number recovering, those symptom-free, and the small number of deaths of healthy people, they kept pounding total cumulative cases. Word and numbers games. Fake News.
1300812411704930305 2020-09-01 23:07:01 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @BeThouHumble Even though minorities typically do not like the Jews, Jews have an affinity for the perceived underdog and are swayed by their culture to want to help them with a passion. IMHO. Reciprocity is not necessary. Jews do not seek rewards on earth.

1300626683221999616 2020-09-01 10:49:00 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @tumult101 That is why you see cumulative numbers - that make it sound worse. You have to dig to find demographics. And 6 million test positive of 350 million people with no mention of false positives with inaccurate testing in many cases. 0.01%
1300624168673738752 2020-09-01 10:39:00 +0800 <TheGreatFeather> @jt_tiger And I am grateful for you.
