1343659599497486336 2020-12-29 04:46:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He was found guilty of manipulating vulnerable people, even though the old people who‚Äôd gave them their houses we‚Äôre happy about the arrangement, they were being looked after and his wife was making their dinners and they had a clean caravan to live in etc.
1343658972813946881 2020-12-29 04:43:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> All he asked was for them to sign their houses over to them. Anyway one died and the local council tried to claim the house only to find it had already been signed over to this gypsy. So they took the gypsy to court. He was only 42 and he‚Äôd had 5 houses left to him.
1343658298894069761 2020-12-29 04:41:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> My dad‚Äôs friend is a solicitor/lawyer and he was defending a gypsy/traveller who had 5 houses left to him by older people, basically he‚Äôd befriended them, agreed to renovate their houses, look after them and actually brought a couple to live with him on his gypsy site.

1343601520575700992 2020-12-29 00:55:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Phil Leotardo used to grill cheese on this.
1343600443935649794 2020-12-29 00:51:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng Yeah but it has to be a muscular form of centrism, not this weak, liberal, shilling form adopted by Paul Joesph Watson and Sargon. Plus it needs to attack the elite, not suck up to them in the hope of getting cookies.
1343599896285339649 2020-12-29 00:49:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Fragola_Girl @sakkoira @WotATyme @PCivilization @Amy_amorie Stop murdering Palestinians!!!!!!
1343565235769249792 2020-12-28 22:31:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng I haven't seen it yet, I did laugh at his Jussie Smollett sketch, that was hilarious.
1343564872664145920 2020-12-28 22:30:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng I will, I've been all over politically but ironically I now think the winning position is the centre, only problem being is the centre is full of shills and utterly spineless people. Some people/groups do have bad intentions and a weak liberal attitude will not be sufficient.
1343554279974596611 2020-12-28 21:47:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng It also creates division because right minded people are like ‚Äúthey‚Äôre no martyr‚Äù and the people who feel wronged then feel attacked. And the cycle becomes self perpetuating.
1343552052501348354 2020-12-28 21:39:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng I did find this guys thread interesting about why the media picks these types.
1343536641307254786 2020-12-28 20:37:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôve said it before.
1343536354756612096 2020-12-28 20:36:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini If only.
1343533616220008448 2020-12-28 20:25:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Wasn‚Äôt she a gang banger?
1343529336935219206 2020-12-28 20:08:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Last depression it allowed a certain monied group of people to buy up all our industries for pennies/cents on the pound/dollar.   Looks like it‚Äôs happening again.   The plundering has started.   https://t.co/UXFE5YP5TC
1343527392934047744 2020-12-28 20:01:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @FrenOfAlbion I think this is just white egotism at times, it‚Äôs an attack on all humanity, if anything they‚Äôre more covert about their attacks on Westerners and overt in their attacks against non westerners.
1343526411986989056 2020-12-28 19:57:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @FrenOfAlbion I don‚Äôt think the Chinese and Zionists are working together now, they we‚Äôre until quite recently. I think they‚Äôre more rival now but o don‚Äôt see China as an ally either, like some like to on the Dissent right. I also don‚Äôt buy into it being solely focused on white people.
1343525127053520899 2020-12-28 19:52:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @vee2easy What did you do to it? Did it get crushed?
1343524232244953088 2020-12-28 19:48:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @katlikestrees Haha. I‚Äôm shocked how good they are at them, even at a young age
1343524000937484296 2020-12-28 19:47:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @vee2easy Ffs.
1343517507567693824 2020-12-28 19:21:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @FrenOfAlbion I don't even buy into Gates and Fauci running the operation, I think they're just convenient scapegoats.
1343517224284397568 2020-12-28 19:20:42 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @FrenOfAlbion I think many are not afraid to think outside the box but I think the schizo posters always over egg the pudding and attack everyone that doesn't agree with them. That also doesn't help.
1343516702118735872 2020-12-28 19:18:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @FrenOfAlbion You see I don't even think China is behind it, it think they had it released on them first but they're not even pushing the vaccine narrative.
1343516204821082113 2020-12-28 19:16:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> According to a doctor who is administrating Covid vaccines at the RVI Newcastle loads of vulnerable people aren't turning up for them so because of the short lifespan of it they're virtually dragging people in off the street.
1343515658584252420 2020-12-28 19:14:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @vee2easy So your hand isn't fixed?
1343514165156204544 2020-12-28 19:08:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @katlikestrees Is this one with your current fella? Congratulations to you both.
1343513476862521345 2020-12-28 19:05:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @tempusRevocatus Meant already there. Typo
1343512961902637057 2020-12-28 19:03:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @FrenOfAlbion I don't think there's anything wrong with keeping an open mind though, most of people who took this stance from March were just making it on instinct, yeah they turned out to be right but it easily could have went the other way.
1343512437274927109 2020-12-28 19:01:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @tempusRevocatus They always attacked the freedom of their citizens, they don't need the virus as an excuse.
1343511969081524224 2020-12-28 18:59:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FrenOfAlbion I think all folks tbh, not just white ones.
1343511743889371137 2020-12-28 18:58:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SmirkingDamsel It takes all the pressure off it, I think this is why many people meet their partners in a working environment, in the dating sphere you write people off top quickly.
1343359319832731653 2020-12-28 08:53:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3Twottle @ChineseNat Sinn Fein(the political wing of the IRA) completed sold the Irish people out in the end too.
1343351063412355079 2020-12-28 08:20:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies I see. üòÇ
1343350567528181760 2020-12-28 08:18:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies Eh..
1343348977035595777 2020-12-28 08:12:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> We‚Äôre technically only a few months behind them.
1343348857942499330 2020-12-28 08:11:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> If China is back to normal without a vaccine then why do we need a vaccine?
1343348625070575624 2020-12-28 08:10:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Gangster bullshit by the looks of things.
1343348270098231297 2020-12-28 08:09:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Who did the Berlin shooting? Everyone seems occupied by the Nashville explosion instead.
1343347961351319560 2020-12-28 08:08:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Another example of time not really moving on from 25 years ago,  yeah the computer is dated but the fashion would very much blend in today.
1343306138939494401 2020-12-28 05:21:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @h8omato @MrIgnite4 Shocked how many have posted Ls and been exposed this Christmas.

1343244904613474306 2020-12-28 01:18:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric But it was also the whole set up of the room, it was like a student flat. The food looked like it had been prepared by adolescences. Maybe he was trolling us but I dunno.....
1343239419130761221 2020-12-28 00:56:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric All our main dishes are like that but TBF Anglos have always had a terrible reputation for food in Europe and the world. I don‚Äôt actually mind the memes but Paul is even doing a shitty job of an already mocked food. üòÇ
1343237988554321920 2020-12-28 00:51:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric There was an issue with polish migration being used to lower wages so I have no issue with people who opposed that but the average Bonk has no idea that those group of people, from that part of Europe are called Slavs.
1343237059495022592 2020-12-28 00:47:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Can I be honest, the average bong has no idea what a Slav is.
1343234205736693760 2020-12-28 00:36:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Yeah the elite maybe but the poor were queuing up for bread and turnips. Not their fault obviously.
1343233932469428226 2020-12-28 00:35:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @maxeastonactor No but you want to put a group forward you think are inferior. So who is really the racist?
1343228164068306945 2020-12-28 00:12:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @maxeastonactor That is not what a supremacist is, a supremacist is someone who believes they're superior to other groups. First learn what the terminology means, then how to impliment it in a sentence.
1343220066129768449 2020-12-27 23:39:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @maxeastonactor Explain white supremacy then?

1343203819333816323 2020-12-27 22:35:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is not helping the reputation of Anglos and our culinary skills.

1342901987264917512 2020-12-27 02:35:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> You've got to be a bit careful around these big Alt Right accounts, they'll repeat all your "based" racial and ethnic talking points back at you then one day low bowl you a neoconservative war.
1342900223237103617 2020-12-27 02:28:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Listen I get everyone needs to earn a living but race baiting for the elite media class is a pretty grubby career.
1342899766489976833 2020-12-27 02:27:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I love how they're trying to meme June Sarpong a political career, she uses to do pop music when I was a teen but they tried to get her to talk about Brexit a few years back, she had no idea what she was talking about, now it's the white privilege schtik.
1342897949035155459 2020-12-27 02:19:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FrenOfAlbion That's not even a conspiracy, that's just stick a flag in a map, Iran is quite calculating so doing something like that would be counterproductive, would they bomb the US Embassy in Iraq? Yeah but a civilian street in Nashville? Wtf?

1342826825584676876 2020-12-26 21:37:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng Giving all your industry away to a communist country to prove you're not a communist. üòÇ  Unbelievably ridiculous thinking about it now, how tf did they ever manage to sell that to the public. üò≥

1342823056255950851 2020-12-26 21:22:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng I think they lost control of the USSR so China was the second choice, now I think India might be the third option since the China situation went bad, they need a big population to farm. These are all just theories of mine BTW.

China thinks they can go it alone now they've got most of America amd the West's industries

1342422792399163394 2020-12-25 18:51:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I used to follow a few Lebanese female accounts and they used to have a meme joke called #BleechRight which was them joking they wanted to marry Northern European men for lighter kids.  Maybe lanklet women who hate their height should marry manlets for similar eugenic reasons.

Interesting thing about a year ago they made a Netflix film about a gay Jesus, not only were Christians furious but Muslims were even more annoyed. The thought of the two groups uniting terrified them.
1341145363173007365 2020-12-22 06:15:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Yeah it's a bit degenerate but it's still way more wholesome than watching Nick Fuentes's Catboi deep throat a dildo.

1340745853011697665 2020-12-21 03:48:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It's also a bit hypocritical of Brittany because she sort of has a similar business model, minus the porn. She too steams and becomes a surrogate e girlfriend for lonely boys. They're the e girlfriends Jordan Peterson is the e dad.
1340744728355229697 2020-12-21 03:43:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is like a tale for our times, young innocent girl becomes popular for being a nerdy e girl who many young boys could fantasise about her being their quirky girlfriend.

1340736356612530177 2020-12-21 03:10:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The irritating thing about Covid is its not getting better, it's getting worse.  The situation is what I'm talking about.
1340707606529257472 2020-12-21 01:16:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism Yeah like you said, he broke the spirit of an unbeaten fighter, the best in the division, probably two weights above him, who thought he was incapable of being beat and he did it easily.
1340672402989199360 2020-12-20 22:56:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism Yeah but that‚Äôs natural, I see a lot of Anglo cope about him too.
1340671142596661250 2020-12-20 22:51:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism Yeah going to Light Heavyweight is a step too far, he‚Äôs a little middleweight as it is. It would be like when De la Hoya stepped up to Super Middleweight to fight Hopkins, a step too far.
1340670373390643201 2020-12-20 22:48:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism Knows too many tricks now, can switch up loads of strategies, plus has an iron chin. BJS lacks serious experience of high class opposition. TBF to Canelo he ducks no one. On paper Smith was a dangerous opposition, maybe a step too high in weight but not so, he dominated him.
1340669559871840257 2020-12-20 22:45:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism @MrAdemHQ Anyway I think too much energy get wasted on this stuff, it‚Äôs interesting but not important.
1340667594890731523 2020-12-20 22:37:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism @MrAdemHQ Yep, very similar to the Arabs with coloured eyes meme. üòÇ
1340667344645926913 2020-12-20 22:36:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism @MrAdemHQ The tanned look in France only came popular around the 1930s around the era of the French Riviera. Up until then tanned whites were associated with being field workers and lower class. There‚Äôs a lot of mixed history in the whole thing.
1340665304179994624 2020-12-20 22:28:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism @MrAdemHQ Mediterranean is probably the ideal in most people‚Äôs heads but in reality it‚Äôs not the only attractive skin type. Plenty of stunning pastey white gingers and dark skin Africans too.
1340664582885552128 2020-12-20 22:25:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism @MrAdemHQ I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs less African, just being more caramel is the ideal, it‚Äôs the same with Northern Europeans, they seem to want that Mediterranean glow.
1340664266664407043 2020-12-20 22:24:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Duginism @MrAdemHQ It‚Äôs quite big in Africa actually.
1340664131528110086 2020-12-20 22:23:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MrAdemHQ @Duginism Bleaching is just the opposite but same psychological mindset as tanning, no one seems to be at ease with their natural skin colour, people need to just accept themselves.
1340662528460918792 2020-12-20 22:17:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MrAdemHQ @Duginism It‚Äôs bullshit, I actually think it‚Äôs more of a thing in non white countries, lighter skin is preferable, hence all the bleaching that goes on, Anglo women in particular seem to have an obsession with tanning up.

1340042531086675969 2020-12-19 05:13:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @basedxcurry @FrenOfAlbion @JohnGinsberg @ArcherOnTheWall @BeProudEngland Pakistan has similar laws too.
1340041307335630849 2020-12-19 05:08:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I fancy some cigarettes......
1340040194079272961 2020-12-19 05:04:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Jack Daniels Tennesse honey, it's basically a liqueur.
1340039450169061378 2020-12-19 05:01:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I'm a social drinker see.
1340036691281797122 2020-12-19 04:50:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Home now, might have a drink in the house(which I never do).
1340031434749304832 2020-12-19 04:29:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg I'm not anonymous so yeah it couldn't be me.
1340027102620467204 2020-12-19 04:12:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg I'm just going to sit back and watch then, if they address it fine, if they brush it under the carpet then they're no better than Labour.
1340012668212695043 2020-12-19 03:14:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg Have we now got to be pro grooming as long as white people are doing it? They need to disavow ASAP and make an example of him otherwise they'll never be able hold any moral ground. I hate all nonces equally.

1339855690828013568 2020-12-18 16:51:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FrenOfAlbion It‚Äôs massive, the tales I have........
1339854973744627713 2020-12-18 16:48:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Ok crackpot theory, now (((they))) have got everyone hooked on porn they‚Äôre going to take it away, hence the new regulations. They‚Äôll be a Only Fans/Netflix style subscriptions now BY LAW and all the coomers will pay it.
1339853494052921344 2020-12-18 16:42:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think garage might be the same all over and I assume it‚Äôs actually French.
1339849874389557249 2020-12-18 16:27:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Right work. In case you didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs actually Black Eye Friday today but because all the bars are closed it‚Äôs off. üòî  The last Friday before Christmas, where everyone finishes work early, gets pissed and often wakes up with a black eye, hence #BlackEyeFriday #BlackEyesMatter
1339849010207748096 2020-12-18 16:24:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Found another copy.
1339848878015860736 2020-12-18 16:24:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They suspended the account showing the nurse passing out after the vaccine.
1339847792165007362 2020-12-18 16:19:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies They need to make a statement then. A truthful one.
1339836864707125251 2020-12-18 15:36:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> David Brent and his consequences have been a disaster for the human race.

1339834788472102912 2020-12-18 15:28:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> You know how you get vitamin d off sunlight, I wonder if you can get something off moonlight?   Only being half serious here.
1339834191823986689 2020-12-18 15:25:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies He lives with Nativist Concerned and the other one.
1339833248759869440 2020-12-18 15:21:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is the article I‚Äôm referring to.  https://t.co/zGV2V02g8z
1339832229602713602 2020-12-18 15:17:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But we‚Äôre not even allowed to do that atm. I‚Äôm prepared though.
1339831894863716352 2020-12-18 15:16:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Socialising outside, in the cold, with the appropriate clothing, is actually quite a vibe.
1339827660487311360 2020-12-18 14:59:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Even the photo man, a bunch of middle aged men playing with a remote controlled car. This guy being one of them.    https://t.co/YwvWbijwcv
1339827289064951808 2020-12-18 14:58:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I believe this is what they call ‚Äúbad optics‚Äù  Dunno how you‚Äôre going to oppose grooming gangs when your literally living the nonces and groomers.   The Absolute State of It.
1339776007767769090 2020-12-18 11:34:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But most halal slaughter houses seem to have went a long way from the original rules, they just play some music in the background. Like the rest of factory farming everything becomes about profit.....not prophet. ü§£
1339775402521313283 2020-12-18 11:32:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Halal is actually "meant" to be humane, it's meant to be done with a sharp blade, animals have to be calm, another animals aren't meant to witness other animals being culled etc. Not so sure about Kosher, I've seen them sacrife chickens before and that's just a ritual torture.
1339772261583237120 2020-12-18 11:19:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I just got on of these though for al fresco socialing this winter.  https://t.co/QTubkIMphR
1339770318123053061 2020-12-18 11:11:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I can bear the cold but your food get cold so fast doing this.
1339769781185114112 2020-12-18 11:09:42 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Did ‚Äúmost‚Äù ever? People are think everything was perfect in the trad past and I‚Äôm not sure it was.
1339767428230901762 2020-12-18 11:00:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lamerciera Yeah I take turmeric, cucurimen, fish oil, collagen, D3, B12 and biotin. Also a few other thing‚Äôs but I‚Äôve started to get a mild ache in my right hand(actually think it‚Äôs down to holding the phone) might try the hydrochloric acid.
1339760339454488577 2020-12-18 10:32:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Maybe 7:30.
1339759665517834240 2020-12-18 10:29:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Fell asleep at 7pm tonight, this is getting ridiculous, I‚Äôve went full circle.
1339759458235396097 2020-12-18 10:28:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lamerciera I remember listening to a podcast about this.
1339644599225233411 2020-12-18 02:52:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Because I don‚Äôt watch tv, I don‚Äôt see stuff like this, so I‚Äôm less worried and more happy. Even if it was as bad as they say(doubtful) I can‚Äôt change it.
1339642752045379585 2020-12-18 02:44:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Lol, which Iranian is this? üòÇ   https://t.co/yXYtpkqAy4  My guess is Perseus.
1339625844432637955 2020-12-18 01:37:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Rubbish9999 I had to Google that
1339625573379960833 2020-12-18 01:36:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @tariqnasheed Maybe he just was trying to descalate the situation in case they ended up shooting him.
1339619868413464577 2020-12-18 01:14:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Wow.  https://t.co/UosgBPG71E
1339619216039833601 2020-12-18 01:11:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> All I can think of is those Thalidomide babies. What a lunatic.
1339618635292225541 2020-12-18 01:09:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric But better options for actually having fun.
1339616754553802756 2020-12-18 01:01:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I‚Äôm shocked how cool kids look these days, we all dressed awfully back then, we actually weren‚Äôt allowed in nightclubs without ‚Äúsmart‚Äù trousers.
1339616251216314369 2020-12-18 00:59:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This sort of traveller energy.  https://t.co/ic450DBfNu
1339615353517862915 2020-12-18 00:56:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Yeah I googled the jumper company, it was only set up in 2013, it‚Äôs the jewellery too, even his build, modern men‚Äôs bodies are either stockier or fatter.
1339614374432935936 2020-12-18 00:52:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I suppose they‚Äôve got old photos to look at, it‚Äôs a good imitation.
1339613147989221383 2020-12-18 00:47:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Maybe he‚Äôs a traveler. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1339612286244315137 2020-12-18 00:43:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôm more confused by the 80s aesthetic, it‚Äôs so close in a subtle way that I actually had to check the prices of food in the background to check it wasn‚Äôt the 1980s.

1339563587375919104 2020-12-17 21:30:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric In hindsight it‚Äôs obvious. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1339539823586136064 2020-12-17 19:55:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Newcastle tier 3, if North Tyneside goes tier 3 I'm working the Christmas. Fuck that.
1339532961537003522 2020-12-17 19:28:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric @lynxpilled I'm more talking about the style, Sergio Tacchini tops with gold hoops.
1339530538651185153 2020-12-17 19:19:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lynxpilled @LeaMaric It's a good look.

1339483198305280000 2020-12-17 16:10:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @SkyNews @KayBurley obviously doesn't believe(in private) that it's as dangerous as they say so why should we believe them?
1339481023525122048 2020-12-17 16:02:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Crisprtek @Striker05381540 I think he base cares less about Covid than the riots, in fact I think they like less restrictions, most Trump fans are Fluthers, its became split down ideological lines.
1339480531357093889 2020-12-17 16:00:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexRivera12121 There seems to have been a fallout more recently between China and Jewish power IMO. The Chinese diplomat "dying" in Israel, Jewish support for Uyghur Muslims and general post anti Covid sentiment point to this.

1339399508816523270 2020-12-17 10:38:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Come on Jim, people in glass houses and all that.  https://t.co/CeJ36oWFlQ

1339395688904404995 2020-12-17 10:23:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It sends a message, actions have consequences, how many bought and paid for politicians would have the arse to commit to illegal wars if they actually knew there were be retribution?
1339394906952003585 2020-12-17 10:20:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Iran whacking Trump when he was out of office would be pretty badass.

1339375866510491649 2020-12-17 09:04:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Obviously goldfish brains don‚Äôt have this problem.
1339375741306359808 2020-12-17 09:03:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> London is now soaring, I remember when we came out of the first lockdown they said London now has zero cases and the theory was that London had burnt itself out.   Now for someone with a good memory I keep noticing how they contradict themselves week by week.
1339374073957277703 2020-12-17 08:57:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TheWesternLark It‚Äôs puerile too, this is a US senator who thinks photoshopping Xi‚Äôs head onto Winnie to Pooh is stunning and brave.

1339135447130365953 2020-12-16 17:09:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> What do (((they))) mean by this?  https://t.co/LcNBNO8Fzv
1339134881981456384 2020-12-16 17:06:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I can feel the build up.  https://t.co/M7ZL35r8nm
1339133587992481792 2020-12-16 17:01:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Lol, they‚Äôre going to cancel Christmas today, just wait.
1339130593053958145 2020-12-16 16:49:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @AQuantumCat1 I can't crawl, even when it's probably in my best interests, I'd rather cut my nose of to spite my face.
1339128872659537922 2020-12-16 16:42:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It used to be an unwritten rule in Hollywood that you would only take a homosexual part if you weren't homosexual.   Now we have Gay-Face üòÇ
1339127089115631620 2020-12-16 16:35:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He probably realises it's the end of the road for him too, he's approaching 40, his political takes are largely mocked, he's known as a sell out. There's not much future in being an influencer past a certain age.
1339126145908928519 2020-12-16 16:32:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I feel better the more ethical companies are getting involved now.
1339122987803537410 2020-12-16 16:19:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @shiftingdunes Yeah it's really weird. I think he probably wants attention.
1339115560966217728 2020-12-16 15:50:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Men make comments on women's appearances all the time(Loomer being to most recent example). I don't know why you'd get offended by a women criticising a mans appearance that's not you.  Women overall are less bothered by aesthetics.
1339113575735058432 2020-12-16 15:42:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @BeigeShiba @nongater He's gay
1339109226262769664 2020-12-16 15:24:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish He cucks hard for the tribe too.
1339108835101995008 2020-12-16 15:23:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Lockdown has been harsh to so many people, there's going to be a lot of MH issues because of it.
1339108595665924096 2020-12-16 15:22:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I'm not even digging him out here, I feel a bit bad for him.
1339107890796367875 2020-12-16 15:19:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Paul's hasn't been in a good place recently, I don't follow him but the tweets I see aren't from a happy man.
1339020856907980806 2020-12-16 09:33:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It‚Äôs hard to believe this guy used to write believable fiction.
1339020001177722880 2020-12-16 09:30:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Maybe because with modern democracy people don‚Äôt actually vote for who they want, they vote against who they don‚Äôt want.
1339017494103814144 2020-12-16 09:20:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Western_Annie He got a world championship belt later on, he was so buzzed up about it.
1339017110429847552 2020-12-16 09:18:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @punisheddixie I don‚Äôt think most of those are real
1339007771489013761 2020-12-16 08:41:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @infamouschar The one with the hoodies man knew how it was going to end too, I could read the situation from the outside, the one with the braids has no instinct, she mistook her not wanting trouble for weakness and paid the price.
1339005384829390853 2020-12-16 08:32:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @infamouschar I keep before it even started the one with the dreads was going to get battered, the one with the hoodie knew it too but didn‚Äôt really want to do it.
1338996232677625861 2020-12-16 07:55:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I worked with one lad who just flew in from Tenerife today(not quarantining) and one last week who‚Äôs wife was at home with Covid. People are sick of it.
1338995668447354881 2020-12-16 07:53:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> When we first came back after the lockdown they kept shutting down Screwfix because of the track and trace then giving it a deep clean, it‚Äôs stopped happening now but apparently the rates are higher.
1338987922234560512 2020-12-16 07:22:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But yeah as I said earlier.
1338987537654800386 2020-12-16 07:21:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Even someone with a crackhead or a heroin addict for a parent is in a better position than someone with no parents.   Any young adult who could even go along with this rhetoric is an incredibly spoilt and selfish individual.
1338986517214220289 2020-12-16 07:17:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> If you have ever known someone who has grown up without parents or in care you know how ridiculous of a statement this is.   I literally hate these people with every ounce of my being.
1338980614649819138 2020-12-16 06:53:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @grannamhaoul @WomenPostingLs Well that ones for women but there‚Äôs also @JournosPostLs but you‚Äôre not a Journalist so I‚Äôm not going to tag it with that.
1338976853332209669 2020-12-16 06:38:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @grannamhaoul @WomenPostingLs It‚Äôs a joke account that reprints self owns.

1338969341115719680 2020-12-16 06:09:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies @1937TheLink Age difference was a bit too off though. It's borderline grooming.

1338932711973658626 2020-12-16 03:43:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I should play a game called man hand or woman hand.
1338932454141407233 2020-12-16 03:42:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @WorldwideAnti They're not trannies, just men pretending to be women online.
1338931280428281856 2020-12-16 03:37:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies Yeah but the average person just thinks you're crazy.
1338930271186509825 2020-12-16 03:33:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies I know too much.
1338930033004589058 2020-12-16 03:32:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I've actually got loads of screenshots of man hands in my camera roll, I used to keep sending them to my Palestinian pal as evidence. I think he deleted his account on the back of my hand detective work. üòÇ
1338925000938696704 2020-12-16 03:12:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Men LARPing as women on Twitter always blow their cover when it comes to hand photos, so many have uploaded photos of them showing something with a big man sausage hands.
1338923935392559105 2020-12-16 03:08:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Now do Palestinians.
1338922340168720386 2020-12-16 03:02:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TheAngloTango Nice Deanobox in the background. üòÇ
1338916495330586633 2020-12-16 02:39:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FrenOfAlbion Depends on the amount of Goyim left "the best of the gentiles(non Jews) should be killed"
1338916176819347456 2020-12-16 02:37:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FrenOfAlbion Stop hating us, we only want to enslave you.  https://t.co/7s3rgcTDxX
1338915816801177605 2020-12-16 02:36:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FrenOfAlbion Weird how their religion tells them that when their messiah comes each Jew will have roughly 73 goyim(non Jewish) slaves.  It really makes you think.
1338909165780135936 2020-12-16 02:09:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> NP
1338906083746869249 2020-12-16 01:57:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He might be a Gulf Arab or he might just like LARPing in the outfit.
1338905232760336385 2020-12-16 01:54:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI Per capita. Journalists always play this game.
1338904608131993600 2020-12-16 01:51:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @etain_vaac How much are they paying you?
1338894288827125760 2020-12-16 01:10:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @cavemage Yeah he's off the Internet for a bit. Needs to focus on his irl life
1338892920737443841 2020-12-16 01:05:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @cavemage Oh hey. üòä
1338891873826590720 2020-12-16 01:01:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @cavemage It's probably for the best, I just feel like I rant like a obsessed crazy half the time.
1338891324200771585 2020-12-16 00:59:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Wonder if they'll have a holiday in the future celebrating the current genocide of the Palestinians?  Sorry Palestinian followers.
1338890994423631872 2020-12-16 00:57:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Purim is the celebration of the genocide of the Iranians/Persians and passover is the celebration of the genocide of all the Egyptian children but hey #NeverAgain.  Who tf has all their religious holidays about genocides? Really weird.
1338889649058689026 2020-12-16 00:52:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Why do they alway leave the bit out about celibrating the genocide of the Greeks?
1338888593226543110 2020-12-16 00:48:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @The_Ayatollah_ @Mendelpol @thisislaurat See how he recoils....... I've been found out.
1338887026532376589 2020-12-16 00:41:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng She's hot, dunno whether she needs the billionaire bit though. Most rich men are arseholes.
1338882632101232640 2020-12-16 00:24:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They wind Muslims up with their 'draw Mohammad' competitions and us with the 'end white privilege/supremacy' rhetoric and the minute they get any blowback they play victim and try to drag either of us into their arguments. I'm sick of being gamed by these people.
1338874162639740931 2020-12-15 23:50:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @StanGalerius He will be in the long run. Godwins law
1338871544207077377 2020-12-15 23:40:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I get sick of these trouble makers trying to sneakily drag everyone into their pet political causes.
1338868058190798849 2020-12-15 23:26:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Don't care, she a mental Zionist who cause provocation on purpose.
1338857881727221760 2020-12-15 22:46:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @newshound1337 @thisislaurat A natural amount of migration is people who want to move, not have to move. It's not rocket science
1338855466638577674 2020-12-15 22:36:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Just to clarify what I mean by this.  https://t.co/dk3dITUSZo
1338854100952346624 2020-12-15 22:31:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> *Groan* this is the type of account that uses the term Zio-Nazis
1338853561078149121 2020-12-15 22:28:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @newshound1337 @thisislaurat Yeah but not on the scale it does today, its completely unnatural and it's mostly caused by wars and economic sanctions. But no-one seems to want to talk about this.
1338849932304928769 2020-12-15 22:14:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini @TerribleWyvern He probably wears a merkin. üòÖ
1338848877798100998 2020-12-15 22:10:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini @TerribleWyvern He'll have some Victoriam diseases him. ü§£

1338845097698471937 2020-12-15 21:55:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The war on the family.
1338843707659923457 2020-12-15 21:49:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @newshound1337 @thisislaurat You either have mixed ancestry or race doesn't exist pick one. Anyway, why are you focusing on the racial aspect of that threat when in reality it was such a minor part. Do you agree or not agree that migration is being engineered?
1338801511367905281 2020-12-15 19:02:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @newshound1337 @thisislaurat What does it mean to be an indigenous Indian? If you're not going to be honest then I'm not willing to carry on this conversation.
1338795964879040513 2020-12-15 18:40:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @newshound1337 @thisislaurat Which parts can't you understand?
1338771449075658754 2020-12-15 17:02:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I can't see how Balenciaga trainers are any less ridiculous than these trainers.  https://t.co/3SARYRDEMJ
1338769629347508224 2020-12-15 16:55:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> One of my most despised brands.  https://t.co/JWar1Y1wEH
1338768033268060160 2020-12-15 16:49:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @newshound1337 @thisislaurat No.  https://t.co/ulxvKInhrR
1338763030021214211 2020-12-15 16:29:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Like Trump for example, he without doubt set the case of talking sensibly about the effect engineered migration back at least 10 years.
1338762630391943168 2020-12-15 16:27:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> By attacking other victims of these plans or even worse trying to align the the architects of them, you're either just posturing with no real ambition of fixing it, not clever enough to understand it or even worse you're shilling and deliberately making it a toxic talking point.
1338759999640702976 2020-12-15 16:17:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Leftists are the opposite of course, they'll just focus on the abroad injustices and not on the blowback into Europe. They'll actively support NGOs like the White Helmets which is just Al Qaeda with a charity tax code and an ex British SAS CEO.
1338759228035633153 2020-12-15 16:14:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> So like yesterday taking about it happening in Europe gets dismissed as a "a White Supremacist conspiracy theory" because they're only focusing on non European migration coming to Europe. If you focused on the whole thing like Palestine, Syria, Libya etc you don't get that stigma
1338758001742770177 2020-12-15 16:09:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> There are many different plans ranging from the Oden Yinon Plan, to the Kalergi plan, to A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm. People only like to talk about their own little part of it instead of tying the whole thing together.
1338656888154714113 2020-12-15 09:27:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> "but I thought this was an art class" made me giggle üòÇ
1338656103186436097 2020-12-15 09:24:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Hahahaha
1338652772254830594 2020-12-15 09:11:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng I gave up on him after he bombed Syria because "it made Ivanka sad" I couldn't take him seriously after that, especially when it turned out the Syrian government didn't even carry out the chemical attack. New boss, same as the old boss.  https://t.co/Vpq09BXANh
1338648125309935617 2020-12-15 08:52:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng He didn't do anything he promised though. He didn't build a wall, he didn't "lock her up", he didn't stop the wars, he did put tariffs on China and he didn't stop support of Saudi Arabia due to their connections to Wahhabi terrorism and funding of ISIS.
1338645971882872833 2020-12-15 08:44:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Has that "Free Hong Kong" vibe to it.  "We just want freedom like the USA"   üá∫üá∏         üá∫üá∏       üá∫üá∏
1338643005188829207 2020-12-15 08:32:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Another Hasbara talking point that leftists use when talking about the Israeli occupation of Palestine is calling them "Zionazis"  While they think this is the ultimate own it's actually reinforcing the WW2 narrative that Jews in Europe were the most percecuted people ever.
1338641945216905217 2020-12-15 08:28:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> How certain Hasbara works, its method of legitimising something even when it appears you're criticising something.  The we just want an ethnostate like Israel argument is just that.  Israel is an invasion and occupation. If you support thar then you can't claim indigenous rights.
1338634635014774786 2020-12-15 07:59:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @dianaawakens Grass fed

1338603072784916483 2020-12-15 05:53:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @shiftingdunes Yeah but so was Iraq and look what happened to Saddam. These people out live their usefulness.
1338602104211042318 2020-12-15 05:49:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Feel like a CIA colour revolution account. ü§£
1338601185788502017 2020-12-15 05:46:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @RBonlett Now I wouldn't that you for an American film, absolute trash.
1338600905529307139 2020-12-15 05:45:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @RBonlett I just remember thinking all of that was stuffy and out of date. I wanted American films like you had in the video shop, not these British TV films.
1338600521775648774 2020-12-15 05:43:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RBonlett @RealBlackIrish I agree with that, it's all too Oxbridge/Radio 4 humour.
1338600066358108160 2020-12-15 05:41:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @RBonlett I don't..... In for a penny in for a pound...... I also hated the Roger Moore era of James Bond for exactly the same reason. üò¨
1338599027408052227 2020-12-15 05:37:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @RBonlett I used to hate that image of Anglos growing up. Silly, clownish, effeminate men who are often desperate for women's attention. It's why the Carry On films also irritated me.
1338596033694212098 2020-12-15 05:25:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is the feedback I get from Muslims anyway. They're more Blackpilled than the Alt Right.
1338595661386821632 2020-12-15 05:24:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It's a combination of things tbh. Obviously liberalism is attractive to most young people with it's nihilism and freedom but Muslim guilt is also a thing, wanting to prove they're not like ISIS or Al Qaeda. In that way it's similar to white/colonial guilt.
1338594680498515968 2020-12-15 05:20:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TheAngloTango Yep that's exactly what I'm expecting too.

1338526309790720008 2020-12-15 00:48:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @WestHullensian Ezra pound wrote something similar to this saying the Anglos got so Judaised the they ended up out Jewing the Jew. Surely the goal should be getting back to truth?   He didn‚Äôt even get mildly flustered by the question. No shot was landed.
1338525065818857474 2020-12-15 00:43:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @StanGalerius @RGoldblatzberg What was the message? Btw the caller was a plant, she had plenty of opportunity to be articulate.
1338524726717800450 2020-12-15 00:42:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg @StanGalerius How could anyone deny it? Plus if he did his party would go absolutely berserk with him, then the antisemitism argument comes up and all the old wounds get opened up. Delicious.
1338523907222081538 2020-12-15 00:39:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @WestHullensian No you‚Äôre missing the point.
1338523662375411715 2020-12-15 00:38:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg Hypocrisy works with Corbyn because he supports indigenous rights for Palestinians but nor Europeans. Keir just supports ethnic replacements across the board. He‚Äôs not a hypocrite, he‚Äôs consistent.
1338523153807642628 2020-12-15 00:36:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @StanGalerius @RGoldblatzberg A good argument would have been ‚Äúwell of course Keir supports a great replacement in Britain because he supports a great replacement in Palestine too‚Äù   So simple and way more effective.
1338521996888584194 2020-12-15 00:31:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg You‚Äôve got to stay consistent on a message, you either believe indigenous people have rights to land or they don‚Äôt. You can‚Äôt pick and chose. These talking points are Hasbara and were probably thought up in an Israeli think tank. By repeating them you‚Äôre just being a useful idiot
1338518120508612609 2020-12-15 00:16:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg No I think you‚Äôre missing the point.
1338517930313723904 2020-12-15 00:15:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @NobleSavage1922 He brushed it off with ease, if he supports a great replacement in Palestine then why would he not support one here? He agrees with replacing indigenous populations. He doesn‚Äôt think anyone has any claim to any land. No matter how long they‚Äôve lived there.
1338516835646513152 2020-12-15 00:10:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They‚Äôll actually be buzzing off this massive self own. üôÑ  https://t.co/mzb6gtt9NS
1338516066012721161 2020-12-15 00:07:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Israel is the great replacement in action, it‚Äôs a non indigenous people, moving to a land, suppressing and marginalising it‚Äôs inhabitants, with the end goal of expelling them completely.   With a bit of racism and ethnic cleansing thrown in.   The Worst Argument Ever.
1338514647218057216 2020-12-15 00:02:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @shiftingdunes No.

My point has always been if you do something sincere3 then you don't film it and upload it to. social media. Irrelevant of colour.

1337646186992459776 2020-12-12 14:31:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @jamtits I think a lot of them have been so brainwashed with anti racism rhetoric that the feel the need to make excuses for even the most evil examples, they weirdly treat them like their pets. Obviously the spiteful mutant types also just like them because they‚Äôre similar.
1337645581754359808 2020-12-12 14:28:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies Just to clarify, I‚Äôve be offered a 5 year old one with 50k on for ¬£6k

1337567658972237824 2020-12-12 09:19:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric @AllOneVine To some degree certain RW males are like feminists, ie they hate women, nobody is going to deny this. So ‚ÄúPick Me‚Äù women tend to align with these women hating men, much like male feminists try to align with men hating women.  And they do it by selling out their own sex.

1337450733436891138 2020-12-12 01:34:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Don't dox yourself if you don't want to.
1337450100679962624 2020-12-12 01:32:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Which gym? A pro one?
1337449781015310339 2020-12-12 01:30:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @twtltrtd2020 Cheers dude
1337449708202110976 2020-12-12 01:30:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @katlikestrees Don't want one bit could easily carry one and I'm a manlet. Wtf!
1337449374977323010 2020-12-12 01:29:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @katlikestrees What's a pawg?
1337448845052096515 2020-12-12 01:27:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Aye she's a Patterdale terrier so she feisty but lives cuddles
1337448377857040386 2020-12-12 01:25:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @twtltrtd2020 Why they putting them on Fridays now? Let me know if you have a stream link, I'm not paying for it.
1337448020317773824 2020-12-12 01:23:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Yeah it was touch and go for a bit, she's fine now though, 10 years on.  https://t.co/PmpfqUOf2l
1337447245977972740 2020-12-12 01:20:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @twtltrtd2020 I think his heart has gone, no doubt the man is an athlete but that doesn't mean shit it boxing, heart and brains is way more important.
1337446875276906501 2020-12-12 01:19:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @GandalftheWhi19 @ChineseNat I'm with Varg on this one Billy. You're going too far down the tankie path.
1337446485122756622 2020-12-12 01:17:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @twtltrtd2020 I think he's going to you know, when he pulled that shit at the weigh in AJ looked rattled.
1337446079374241795 2020-12-12 01:16:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Oh it's horrible, my puppy was ran over and I managed to get her to the vets but I was so frantic over it all they ended up calling the police to calm me down. I'm still scarred by it now if I think about it.
1337443660984627200 2020-12-12 01:06:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Fuck it.
1337443316242280449 2020-12-12 01:05:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I would have battered him too but like you say initially you're more worried about the dog first.
1337442948926091265 2020-12-12 01:03:42 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Paddy03538849 He's sort of a pal but he's disorganised af.
1337442591323906050 2020-12-12 01:02:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric As disgusting as that is it impressive men want to impress you this much.
1337441842288267270 2020-12-12 00:59:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Last job of the day phone is out of service, 5 more minutes and I'm fucking them off.
1337441567947304961 2020-12-12 00:58:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric @lamerciera Oh the dads are still angry, just not so much the kids. Maybe the lead permanently damaged them?
1337440424420667400 2020-12-12 00:53:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> All sides feel disenfranchised by the police, feeling that the other sides gets special treatment. A perfect climate for civil war.
1337439936002351104 2020-12-12 00:51:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Here we go.....
1337439658578505730 2020-12-12 00:50:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric @lamerciera Maybe, I'd rather be insane though. It wears of as you get older anyway.
1337439295368548352 2020-12-12 00:49:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Italians not European. Case closed. Varg waz right.
1337438740051095555 2020-12-12 00:46:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric @lamerciera Men are definitely less angry and I think it's related, I can remember all our dad's having hair trigger tempers but now everyone avoids conflict. Although I saw a coalation with lead being took out of petrol.  https://t.co/9V5oIs1s6w
1337401440139087874 2020-12-11 22:18:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng It's not even a case of mistaken identity or maybe a manslaughter charge. Both were done in cold blood, caught red handed and even admitted it.
1337400731444404231 2020-12-11 22:15:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng Yeah it's sad that young dumb men get led down the wrong path but it's more sad that innocent people die. You have the DP so the rules are the rules. Two of the most open and shut cases. People who are actually arguing them are crazy.
1337399251094134789 2020-12-11 22:10:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Dylan Roof should be executed too.
1337398501429424130 2020-12-11 22:07:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @malibu_baby95 @downbadpatrol How do you know today means today though? It could be an old screenshot.
1337397296921710596 2020-12-11 22:02:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlanwDictionary @410MLXVI Virtually everyone everyone gets their hair cut so a bit of a dumb comment by you.

1337353558069555208 2020-12-11 19:08:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @vee2easy They fold up though, so if you commute you can take them on the train /bus. I think they're quite a good invention.
1337329888425086977 2020-12-11 17:34:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MrAdemHQ I can often conflate the two after too much MENA Baddies thirsting.
1337329266896367616 2020-12-11 17:31:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ClaraWSparkles Yeah I didn't realise was Sadiq.

1337324619234209792 2020-12-11 17:13:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Holbornlolz He ex husband Ronnie used to rob security vans.
1337324184029057024 2020-12-11 17:11:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MartBoy_66 @Holbornlolz They were both nonces. But yeah they loved their old mum.
1337322960361836544 2020-12-11 17:06:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SkyNews He should have converted to Judaism and Trump might have pardoned him.  https://t.co/jQYuUswqUf
1337322259086790657 2020-12-11 17:04:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @dicksblackbess @410MLXVI Obviously not ALL suits and ties but it's still an correct observation.
1337322067931377664 2020-12-11 17:03:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @dicksblackbess @410MLXVI Suits and ties asset stripped and destroyed British industry in the 50s, 60, 70s and 80s. People like Philip Green are still doing it now to the British High Street with shops like Top Shop and Debenhams.  https://t.co/BBE9w7Em36
1337320215454093312 2020-12-11 16:56:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini Deal, no using my razor.
1337318558607532035 2020-12-11 16:49:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Tbh I've always wanted to be able to cycle to work but I need the van for all the tools and materials.
1337317974819151875 2020-12-11 16:47:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini I a new age man and shit(only started doing this about a year ago mind).

1337232840124207108 2020-12-11 11:08:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Age of consent in the U.K. is currently 16.
1337228231578152964 2020-12-11 10:50:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @OLDLADYBOOBZ A spot?
1337227141985996802 2020-12-11 10:46:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Singh53157116 @2LarryJohnson7 He had a squint.
1337217586954711040 2020-12-11 10:08:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Wow, celebrities have so much power over people‚Äôs minds.
1337217388715061252 2020-12-11 10:07:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Didn‚Äôt expect this sort of content from Kim.
1337216757443006464 2020-12-11 10:04:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Oh I think they already killed him.
1337215696661516290 2020-12-11 10:00:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I wonder if Trump is going to pardon him as a favour to Kanye? What a bizarre time to be alive.
1337214816377839623 2020-12-11 09:57:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Then I‚Äôm like wtf?
1337214422058737664 2020-12-11 09:55:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I see tweets like this and think ‚ÄúI wonder what he did?‚Äù
1337212485523398657 2020-12-11 09:47:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I can only assume that this kid‚Äôs father is not in his life because no father would forgive him for this.
1337210936470462465 2020-12-11 09:41:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @RGoldblatzberg That‚Äôs how they get them into tier 3

1337208644836978688 2020-12-11 09:32:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @vee2easy Who Bobby? Ace.
1337208019260682242 2020-12-11 09:30:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The fact the media is actually reporting this so much is a red flag, I bet if I‚Äôd done this it wouldn‚Äôt even make local news.
1337204382845300736 2020-12-11 09:15:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think people used to think stuff like this was edgy af when Christopher Hitchens used to say it, now it‚Äôs done by clout chasers trying to be outrageous when in reality bashing Christianity is the safe position in the current year.
1337201633252487168 2020-12-11 09:04:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It‚Äôs getting worse, the rules are going to get more and more ridiculous.
1337200409023303680 2020-12-11 08:59:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini I get my own, even more gay.
1337199586973257728 2020-12-11 08:56:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I remember seeing Bobby on an in a IRL interview and opposed to his character he‚Äôs actually an extremely strong personality, very outspoken, was saying things about Robert de Niro that no doubt would hurt his acting career. Great guy.
1337198260755238915 2020-12-11 08:51:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôve started hiding my swearing in tweets because I notice Twitter often hides replies from me that have swearing in them, must be something in the algorithm.
1337197838170775556 2020-12-11 08:49:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Who the f*ck uses their credit card on Pornhub anyway? A token gesture, just ban the whole site.
1337197248036425730 2020-12-11 08:47:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They got the 80s atheistic perfect.
1337195795951595520 2020-12-11 08:41:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Fell down a YouTube hole.....
1337194929387352064 2020-12-11 08:38:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Can‚Äôt believe this if 15 years old, I remember seeing it at the cinema.  https://t.co/LdAlZSwyqj

1337171455818215425 2020-12-11 07:04:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> That‚Äôs actually The Football Factory not The Business. Same director and many of the same actors though. Great soundtrack.  https://t.co/rSbQVAb6Nj

1337137813763055617 2020-12-11 04:51:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Lol the account that posted it. üòÇ
1337136859886084098 2020-12-11 04:47:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini How will you know it‚Äôs me?

1337134935396769800 2020-12-11 04:39:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> American Fluthers like to make Covid all about #Fauci but it‚Äôs way bigger than just him. Pure Americentrism.
1337131898246721539 2020-12-11 04:27:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I know for a fact we‚Äôre getting the fishing rights because I work for someone in the fishing industry and the government has been giving him ¬£100s of thousands of pounds in grants to set up a network a distribution network.
1337131155867529216 2020-12-11 04:24:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lamerciera @LeaMaric Scouser though so it‚Äôs all becoming a lot clearer. üòâ

1337124143305723904 2020-12-11 03:56:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The problem is that every political leader in the world knows the US Congress is for sale so you can‚Äôt blame China or Russia for thinking they can try to muscle in on Israel‚Äôs action.  This is the swamp that needed draining but if anything Trump made it bigger.
1337123407780044802 2020-12-11 03:53:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Who drag your nation into wars that bankrupt them and make them the most hated nation on the planet, America First actually was a good strategy, it was just railroaded by the most un America First president you could hope for. People didn‚Äôt call  it MIGA for nothing.
1337122689790734340 2020-12-11 03:51:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It‚Äôs the dual citizens that are the problem in the US and I‚Äôm not talking about the average Armenian taxi driver who likes to visit his family back home. I mean the dual citizens that lobby your government to send them billions in aid to their dual nationality foreign nations.
1337121335508660227 2020-12-11 03:45:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> If you‚Äôre American then this is your winning strategy, anything else is just posturing and purity spiralling.

1337056510829080583 2020-12-10 23:28:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I almost expect to see great achievement minimised with some argument like but muh slavery or muh colonialism but I didn‚Äôt expect to see some ecological based guilt tripping on a tweet about viaducts. üòÇ  These people have psychological issues, their negativity is out of control.

1337012999106781192 2020-12-10 20:35:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Question: How many people use the notification to inform you of when people tweet?   Do you use it for friends, celebs or just people you like?
1337012256568172544 2020-12-10 20:32:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I know we all do but it‚Äôs a sort of unwritten code, scanning the timeline is cool but reading someone‚Äôs old tweets is stalking. üòÇ  Certain people have tweets I love and check up on regularly but I refuse to get notified when they tweet because that‚Äôs kind of weird.
1337008687932649473 2020-12-10 20:18:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @Wotadini It‚Äôs not even psychosomatic either, I know someone who gave it to their arthritic dog and it was bouncing around like a puppy again within a few weeks
1337008118635655168 2020-12-10 20:15:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Totally, bring back thin lips, crooked teeth and wonky eyes. They add character. ü§£ Just been reminded of this advert from when I was a kid. Don‚Äôt know if you got it in the states.    https://t.co/6PTK6g8YGi
1337007154134454272 2020-12-10 20:12:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric The mystique has gone too, thanks to social media you realise most of these celebs are a bit brain dead and vanilla. I still miss thinking there was this ubermensch class though.
1337005462915571713 2020-12-10 20:05:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Take me back.
1337002569533706240 2020-12-10 19:53:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Definitely, Schiffer was my bedroom calendar as a pubescent boy.
1336999674507649024 2020-12-10 19:42:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini Cucurimen is apparently 20 times stronger so I take that in the morning with black pepper and take a turmeric in evening.
1336999181559455744 2020-12-10 19:40:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini I took it to reduce inflammation when exercising and because my job is quite physical, basically I‚Äôm trying to stay strong for the long term so I‚Äôm now taking loads of supplements. Get the one with bioperine of just take it with black pepper.

1336983678438805505 2020-12-10 18:38:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Technically it‚Äôs not a stottie but I‚Äôm camping it up a bit to make mine different.

1336982716731039748 2020-12-10 18:34:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> People on Twitter‚Äôs opinion of English people: They‚Äôre a sneaky, cunning, eternal Anglo phenotype.  People who‚Äôve actually met Anglos: They‚Äôre just all degenerate, alcoholic, louts.
1336981882769190913 2020-12-10 18:31:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @springsteddy @LeviCoult I‚Äôm far from a Romeo but think it‚Äôs very rare to make any instant impact on a women in a situation like that, no matter how good looking you are, it takes seeing them a few times and then slowly making little steps, why they call it planting seeds.

1336957931007467520 2020-12-10 16:56:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Yeah this plan nearly backfired, nearly fell asleep 5 times driving home last night and literally slipped into a coma when I got in the house.
1336754181538013186 2020-12-10 03:26:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> So tired, nearly fell asleep on the 80 minute drive home. üò¥

1336648609878708224 2020-12-09 20:27:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I've actually got a couple of friends who served over there and a Bosnian Twitter friend, the Dissident Right likes to make out the Serbs are "Based" for obvious reasons but I'd be interested in a Croatian perspective.
1336646381436596226 2020-12-09 20:18:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Well when we get to know each other a bit better I'm going to pick your brains about it. üòâ

1336560288250916864 2020-12-09 14:36:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @GreekPale Not really, I just think it's a pretty random, it doesn't warrent the lockdown they're implimenting but no one should be mocked for being worried. Even though the media are over egging it.
1336488037799370753 2020-12-09 09:49:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Hahaha what a fantasist. üòÇ
1336486104560709632 2020-12-09 09:41:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think they deliberately picked someone with a name like this so it would go viral. Loads of people trying to make a joke out of it. Gorilla Marketing.
1336482429910048770 2020-12-09 09:26:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I was just informed of someone's mother who just died in the last few days of Covid, apparently nothing wrong with her before it, she was 67.

1336450385763037190 2020-12-09 07:19:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Vaccine on MSM: The most amazing medical discovery in the history of mankind.  Vaccine on Twitter: Really bad, doesn't work, will make you infertile.  Ironically it's actually the pro vaccine MSM reporting that makes me more sceptical of it.

1336442731065991169 2020-12-09 06:49:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @shameful_kernal @CoomersPostingL So why do they control both the pornography industry and the banks still?
1336441858986217473 2020-12-09 06:45:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @DhammaFarmer Yeah, once your eyes are opened you realise Owen and Ash etc are just sideshow to entertain the proles and prop up the system. He's irrelevant.
1336441360044449799 2020-12-09 06:43:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @alaqasem1980 @wisermann What? I'm saying the Js in America made a deal, in the 1970s, with the Chinese to move all of America and the West's industries to China. In the last few years the Chinese have decided they don't need the Js and now they've fell out.
1336437647011704837 2020-12-09 06:28:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @dibutler4 Too graphic.

1336436519830220802 2020-12-09 06:24:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @alaqasem1980 @wisermann No I think they're in competition with each other now, yeah a few years back but now they seem to have locked horns.
1336436038659674113 2020-12-09 06:22:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I hope she resold them and got double her money. üòÇ
1336435750645211139 2020-12-09 06:21:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is clout chasing, nothing to be proud of here, like buying a homeless man a coffee and uploading it to social media.  Look at his smug face, a face created for slapping.
1336434491146063872 2020-12-09 06:16:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It was way too obvious. Can't believe nobody else said it.
1336434259649818628 2020-12-09 06:15:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I follow you on Twitter.

1336210546350297089 2020-12-08 15:26:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I wouldn‚Äôt be arsed if they didn‚Äôt spend every hour of every day guilt tripping everyone on tv and social media about doing way less. #ScumMedia
1336199117391990784 2020-12-08 14:41:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @yazbashar What can we really do though? I can tweet about it but often I just think I'm being a repetitive bore.
1336196915696967680 2020-12-08 14:32:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I'm back on the green tea, I'm going to fix my diet, I'm going back to the gym properly. Fresh start now #Lockdown2 is over(sort of).
1336196512443928577 2020-12-08 14:30:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Remember the other Aussie guy who jabbed a kangaroo on the nose because it had a hold of his dog? He was ace.

1336103780778188802 2020-12-08 08:22:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But I've got family members who are absolutely terrified, I haven't been in my mother's house since March so I don't judge. I'm more scared of the vaccination than the illness and many probably think that's crazy.
1336103069529018369 2020-12-08 08:19:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I make zero effort not to catch it, I've been ill once, I think the precautions are worse than the illness.
1336102309609222150 2020-12-08 08:16:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @GB_UV2 Strict handstand push ups instead of OHP, then drop to kipping ones, pull ups and dips, maybe get some dumbells. You'll do ok

1336002243510853633 2020-12-08 01:38:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Basically this.

His handlers even convinced him to make pro Israel statements. The man was a fraud. Malcolm X on the other hand was the real deal.
1335982539153010688 2020-12-08 00:20:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @rajlion_bose They probably thought it was funny, she seemed to think it was. It looked like neither had done an hours sport in their lives. I think some Americans refer to them as NARPstools or something.

1335981308896452619 2020-12-08 00:15:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I traveled all over the world with NUFC, Marseille, Majorca, Tallinn, Belgrade, Tele Aviv but this internet fandom looks f*cking miserable.

1335977211753615368 2020-12-07 23:59:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is sad how much they care about this. It‚Äôs almost even worse because in the old days people would actually get together for these interactions but now it done online.

1335967263397179400 2020-12-07 23:19:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I don‚Äôt really judge anyone for their views tbh, saying that when I was a believer I did have people who literally fell out with me for it.
1335965502582235136 2020-12-07 23:12:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I don't actually know your views on it. What are they?
1335964733283983361 2020-12-07 23:09:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I don't think it doesn't exist I just think for the mass majority it doesn't really effect them and you can't lock up the world because of a few outliars.
1335963977189306374 2020-12-07 23:06:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @CelestineBee My main question is wtf is in that vaccine and why do they want us to take it so bad?
1335961991467446273 2020-12-07 22:58:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I've done a 100% U turn on #COVID19 and I was a true believer. I really can't see how the more BS than comes out that others can't see that they're using it.

1335958894070411264 2020-12-07 22:46:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies I think their biggest issue with Iran(much like Syria) is not Iran itself but the public's appetite for a war with them. Plus with everything that's going at home a pointless war undermines their other agendas, like covid.
1335955226717790210 2020-12-07 22:32:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies Iraq is the perfect example, the got America to invade and then Iran ended up benefiting. Total own goal. üòÇ

1335921505683845126 2020-12-07 20:18:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MrAdemHQ I was thinking of this a while ago. Most of the anti white people I see(on Twitter) seem to live in London but virtually non in the suburban and rural areas. The same areas these types of people live. Then I remember that I also hate these white liberal people.

1335713322033934337 2020-12-07 06:30:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They cared nothing for Injustices if it effected their interests. Jewish popstar Bob Dylan, ‚Äúchampion of the underdog‚Äù even wrote a song glamourising the massacre.  https://t.co/WsTl1bGlnE
1335712370807762945 2020-12-07 06:27:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But what he found when he approached his London liberal Jewish friends was that not only were they not interested that in fact they supported the Israeli army that committed the massacre. He realised then they were nothing but frauds.
1335711401663410179 2020-12-07 06:23:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> #RoaldDahl made these comments in relation to the Israeli Lebanon war in 1982 and in particular to the Sabra and Shatila massacre and how Israel facilitated it. After many decades of him and his liberal friends calling out global injustices.

1335388390779478016 2020-12-06 08:59:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini I don‚Äôt know the full story but apparently the people were being forced to work harder and harder and they resisted. So the police were invented to stop them. Obviously this is all post Cromwell and post usury.

You‚Äôre hoping I‚Äôm not as well as informed as I am. On top of that another member of the TDS panel was sexually grooming young fans while the others turned a blind eye. You remember that part?

Try to tell me that isn‚Äôt subversive because I actually listened to that show.

I don‚Äôt hate any of them but bear in mind we all do have different languages. We‚Äôre not some European homogeneous block

Much like we discussed earlier.

The first mass immigration I actually opposed was in fact Polish immigration into Britain. Most Americans simply can‚Äôt comprehend this, my objections were financial and to some degree cultural.

You wouldn‚Äôt need to deport anyone, some would leave and others would just be absorbed into the mass within 3 generations

The options are 1. The way it is now or 2. Much more of the same.  I‚Äôm sure everyone now would like to go back to the 80s demographics, where will we be in 2060
1335355767919144960 2020-12-06 06:49:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ohgodmuhbrains @KetaMeanGirl @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty Are all your friends and family white? This is great in theory but achievable in reality.

But hypothetical question, where would you rather live, I free multicultural society or an ethnostate ruled by ZOG?

I have no ambition to rule over anyone, why would I want to put another group in the position I detest myself.
1335352592935882757 2020-12-06 06:37:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @KetaMeanGirl @LeviCoult Is that not the struggle though?
1335352103494041601 2020-12-06 06:35:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @childofthenorf I just think they get their power by dividing people. If people were united then their games wouldn‚Äôt work.
1335341570904764420 2020-12-06 05:53:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I won‚Äôt believe this until they publish the videos. üòâ #FakeNews
1335340583200698371 2020-12-06 05:49:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @childofthenorf When they focus on the true enemy I guess, Mike is irritating but he‚Äôs got no power or strength in reality. You can whinge about immigrants but most are the same, they have no power and just want to make a better life. You‚Äôve got to focus on the minority who engineers it.
1335339835868000258 2020-12-06 05:46:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AlexandrovnaIng Me too. Even recently, I spot it earlier now but people can only keep up an act for so long.
1335338909593694208 2020-12-06 05:43:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ArcheonAscended It‚Äôs all about dividing and then radicalising society. Old tricks but still effective.
1335337128448888832 2020-12-06 05:35:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Darrengee20 It‚Äôs either a film set or you‚Äôre in America, probably the former.
1335336204787703811 2020-12-06 05:32:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @childofthenorf Because like you say the cathedral is behind him but not the population. The population is convinced the rest of the population supports him due to his blue tic and high profile so keeps their repulsion quiet. It‚Äôs all smokes and mirrors.

1335331411495161858 2020-12-06 05:13:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Ok off topic, the expression ‚Äúthey make my skin crawl‚Äù is actually a very real phenomenon, you know when you‚Äôre in the company of someone you don‚Äôt trust and it literally gives you that feeling. Slimy salesmen ouse this energy.

1335329470643916803 2020-12-06 05:05:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> My sister elderly neighbour came out the other day, my sister barely recognised her, she says she had Covid.

1335315013335126024 2020-12-06 04:08:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The problem with people like Mike is they stand for nothing, all their tweets are just done for likes and up cummies.   Mass immigration does lower wages and allows employers to exploit workers but Mike doesn‚Äôt care because he has no ideology, he‚Äôs just here for the dopamine hit.

Magna Carta was wrote in 1215 banning usury and expelling the Jews that introduced it, Jews then funded Cromwell's revolution so they could implement their own puppet king, William of Orange, who set up the Bank of England and reintroduced usury.

1334861471206043650 2020-12-04 22:05:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @AQuantumCat1 @RBonlett Failing that try switching it off, then turning it back on.
1334861164107476994 2020-12-04 22:04:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TruthbeatsLies I don‚Äôt know how they can claim it wasn‚Äôt premeditated, I‚Äôd like to know more about the case and her mental health though. Not holding my breath though.
1334857686110892035 2020-12-04 21:50:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I don‚Äôt trust Big Pharma and I don‚Äôt trust doctors who prescribed highly addictive opioids for minor alignments because there were financial incentives, thus causing the opioid crisis and mass global deaths.
1334856803289604096 2020-12-04 21:47:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Bariiiiiq Hmmmmmm.
1334856662625251330 2020-12-04 21:46:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The conclusion.
1334856586758598659 2020-12-04 21:46:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Interestingly on the same day, shit like this makes me think they‚Äôre trying to engineer a civil war.
1334855741719666693 2020-12-04 21:43:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI I think arguing with these clowns online is a totally waste of energy these days
1334854453757931520 2020-12-04 21:37:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> What da fuck?
1334854347126136835 2020-12-04 21:37:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It doesn‚Äôt feel like Christmas until my favourite multinational corporation releases their melancholy advert.

1334849686243577856 2020-12-04 21:19:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôm very tired of the lip syncing trick now. üò¥
1334848939196100608 2020-12-04 21:16:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Hahahahahaha, I‚Äôd only seen the other clip where she seemed a bit sassy, she is actually a really bad witness for Trump‚Äôs case. üòÇ
1334845189450588161 2020-12-04 21:01:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It never did.
1334844368902090753 2020-12-04 20:57:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I don‚Äôt actually have it but there are a few pages I check out through the browser. Still not healthy but at least I‚Äôm not grinding for likes and getting notifications.
1334843706244018176 2020-12-04 20:55:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Jesus, it‚Äôs getting mad.
1334842884726644740 2020-12-04 20:51:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I was talking to an 18 year old girl at work(who looked about 14/15) yesterday who it appeared had massive lip fillers. I was very confused and thought I‚Äôd reach that age where everyone under 30 looks like a child. üòÇ
1334842072520601600 2020-12-04 20:48:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> What could possibly ruin this level of fitness, youth and beauty?
1334841618239791104 2020-12-04 20:46:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @begomeorthodox This isn‚Äôt even an issue these days thanks to laser hair removal.
1334841349640757250 2020-12-04 20:45:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Kurse those Kardashians!!!
1334840135729418240 2020-12-04 20:41:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric They‚Äôre even beyond normal, they‚Äôre like top 2% if you can even see them. Most people are nowhere near that level of healthy.
1334838446213500928 2020-12-04 20:34:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric It‚Äôs where the quads start and I find them hot af, love massive quads on a woman.
1334837902799409157 2020-12-04 20:32:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> These were the same type of people that used to bully us all when we were apprentices, I swore I‚Äôd have my day with them when I was older and now I‚Äôm older I haven‚Äôt got the heart, they‚Äôre so weak and pathetic it‚Äôs not even worth it.
1334829116730863616 2020-12-04 19:57:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I heard an older guy describe this look as "she'd never stop a pig in the passageway"
1334826729215561729 2020-12-04 19:47:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AHAgha3 Just to clarify I'm not saying all Sunnis do, plenty show support this but its definitely common. It's sad ZOG either killed or coopted their strongmen.
1334826178079813632 2020-12-04 19:45:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Zak's father became one of the richest men in the world by asset stripping British industries, so much so two of his sons ended up marrying Rothschilds. Now he does backroom deals like Millbank Tower with the Sassoon family(Reuben brothers)  Every single time.
1334824872929845249 2020-12-04 19:40:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I had a internet friend who was being half blackmailed with a doxing, he was a bit shook up at first and showed it and they smelt blood. Now he's just owning it and they've left him alone.
1334823983221501953 2020-12-04 19:36:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AHAgha3 It's just a cope because there's no Sunni resistance that is either successful or that's not compromised by ZOG. Sad, I'm just happy there's someone out there giving them hell, irrelevant of their religious background.
1334822553223917568 2020-12-04 19:31:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is the best way to deal with doxing, just own it, I couldn't give two fucks if someone doxed me, you'll find photos of me on my page, I say everything irl that I say on here.
1334820548514361344 2020-12-04 19:23:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is a weakness of mine, I'm too soft on wankers.
1334819931326734339 2020-12-04 19:20:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Going to miss not having a Black Eye Friday this year but I'm pretty indifferent about the whole Christmas thing this year. Be happier once it's back to normal.
1334819327430758400 2020-12-04 19:18:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Some old guy(65) was cheeky to me a in the pub a few months ago so I had to put him in his place, I didn't threaten him or anything. Just gave him a few home truths. Now he shits himself everytime he sees me and I feel half guilty.  Why do people do this to themselves?
1334818298257698817 2020-12-04 19:14:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TheAngloTango I'd probably just not marry them though if that were the case, why bother, I'd still live with them though.
1334818048579162113 2020-12-04 19:13:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @amalieskram I hate the older people who are chuffed if the younger ones like them, I'm never being that guy, the youth are to be despised until they prove they have character. üòÅ
1334817251283906561 2020-12-04 19:10:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TheAngloTango It's not a deal breaker.
1334816948270604291 2020-12-04 19:08:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SunManNe0 High caste Indian would be my guess
1334686921893744640 2020-12-04 10:32:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Marcus4Punished @ChineseNat Kosher, Am Nat Twitter, that does the odd sieg heil to appear based, really needs to rope. It‚Äôs an actual formula. Then come election time they‚Äôll all shill for the ZOG Emperor.
1334685118762524673 2020-12-04 10:25:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FrankDeScushin @thehill Oh it‚Äôs the evangelicals she‚Äôs trying to appeal to.  https://t.co/IXEsj3F2tk
1334684629702500354 2020-12-04 10:23:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It reminds me of those terrorist videos where they‚Äôre held and gunpoint and have to keep repeating the same mantra.
1334676960048521217 2020-12-04 09:52:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> What these clowns can‚Äôt see is America has had its time and no increasing of population will save it, it‚Äôs as much as a spiritual decline as a physical one. These two ‚Äúelite‚Äù men look weak and ready for the taking.   They should read John Glubb‚Äôs The Fate of Empires.
1334661576146739201 2020-12-04 08:51:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I agree, I think most probably don‚Äôt realise that there is gay men behind these accounts, I‚Äôm also a little more conspiratorial and think some of these accounts may also be financially funded too.
1334659851197231106 2020-12-04 08:44:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> China is now a 5000 year old country. Wow, every day is a learning day.   Love the crimes of your ancestors meme too. üò¥
1334657008243531777 2020-12-04 08:33:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @therealmissjo Scent of a Woman
1334656762734108674 2020-12-04 08:32:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Part of me wishes I didn‚Äôt know half of the things you just listed there when I actually know them all. üòÇ
1334655414827364352 2020-12-04 08:27:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Then they got exposed, one was grotesquely overweight and had a Jewish wife and another was using it to groom young boy fans. He was a man in his late 20s grooming and having sex with autistic 18 year olds while the others covered it up. The whole movement is depressing af.
1334654664525144064 2020-12-04 08:24:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I just read your whole thread, spot on, around 2016 I was listening to Alt Right podcast TDS, it was all the standard Ubermench, Retvrn LARPing with the most basic racisms, antisemitisms, homophobia and Islamophobic. All done anonymously.
1334650694779985931 2020-12-04 08:08:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric The internet has now just become...... 1. Find the worst example of group XYZ 2. Repost the example insinuating this typical  3. Dopamine.
1334648967838240771 2020-12-04 08:01:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The real capitalist thing about it will be when you find out which sweatshop it was made in and what hourly rate the person who made it is on.
1334645615947616256 2020-12-04 07:48:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @arnelsbrotha @TheWesternLark @ChineseNat Why? Because they‚Äôre all way too Judaized?
1334613689786359809 2020-12-04 05:41:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TheWesternLark @ChineseNat @arnelsbrotha I don‚Äôt think they really support it sincerely. They do it more just to avoid the racist conservative stereotype.
1334611614088241152 2020-12-04 05:32:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish Aye Quibbie was South Africa so I doubt it‚Äôs him.
1334606352203833346 2020-12-04 05:12:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish I think he got caught out doing something, I forget now, cheating with a few different women or something.
1334605740619812866 2020-12-04 05:09:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish Haha fun times. üòÇ
1334605333818466304 2020-12-04 05:08:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish I think it does if there‚Äôs one group I‚Äôve never warmed to. That‚Äôs a real anomaly. We‚Äôre old timers from similar circles on Twitter. Can you remember that African guy Quibbie?
1334604537970249729 2020-12-04 05:04:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish I didn‚Äôt say I did. I was just pointing out most are alright except one. That was my main point
1334603476664520704 2020-12-04 05:00:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> TBF I actually managed to make friends online with virtually most races, nationalities and religions except one.   I‚Äôll just leave it there. üòÇ
1334304980384223235 2020-12-03 09:14:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I've had covid 19 twice this year but on the plus side I've managed to not catch the flu.
1334301641500221441 2020-12-03 09:01:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeviCoult I think they're just grinding for followers
1334299110564917248 2020-12-03 08:51:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeviCoult It looks like she consumes a lot of sugar though.

1334285336566960134 2020-12-03 07:56:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Three days in bed and then she started feeling better, at 70.
1334285128311377931 2020-12-03 07:55:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> ‚ÄòI didn't have any appetite, my coffee tasted metallic, I didn't have my usual breakfast champagne because I didn't fancy it, which is another surprise for me.'¬†  Wow sounds rough.

1334173118005383176 2020-12-03 00:30:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Well over a year ago Deborah Orr passed. Such a sad end to an fascinating character.
1334171641946005504 2020-12-03 00:24:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The student protests that the media doesn't want to give any oxygen to. #9K4WHAT
1334169309359247361 2020-12-03 00:15:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Fashigoy @RichardBSpencer Selfish liberals who only care for themselves and don't want to help the weak and vulnerable.
1334168323005837314 2020-12-03 00:11:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I remember there used to be a joke about the territorial army that went   "how do you know if someone is in the territorial army?"  "Don't worry, wait 2 minutes and they'll tell you"
1334163821989142533 2020-12-02 23:53:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @twtltrtd2020 @RGoldblatzberg Stories are getting scrubbed left right and centre, just tried to read on about a rent strike by students at my local uni because they say they've been lied to about Covid and it's gone
1334120647560220678 2020-12-02 21:02:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I wear a snood instead of a mask, i actually wore it long before Covid 19, sometimes I pull it up when it‚Äôs cold and I‚Äôm walking down the street, then I get self conscious because I think I look like I‚Äôm scared of Covid.

1334105734129315843 2020-12-02 20:02:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Just to clarify I actually enjoyed the original lockdown, enjoyed the rest, enjoyed returning back to work early being a key worker and we've never been so busy plus we've been partying most nights on site when we've been working away. üòÇ  But we're an anomaly. Most are suffering
1334103684108718080 2020-12-02 19:54:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Christmas songs on the radio and it doesn't feel like Christmas.
1334100002306715649 2020-12-02 19:40:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think during lockdown a lot of people realised outside of their jobs, nights out and clubs they had absolutely nothing, it's why the sales of dogs has rocketed.
1334093670849650689 2020-12-02 19:14:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MrAdemHQ Also trying to meme Muslims, Jews and Israelis as One Struggle. GTFO!
1334093433896656900 2020-12-02 19:13:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> What if this doesn't apply to you and you don't hate Muslims?
1334092562739720193 2020-12-02 19:10:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I sometimes think out of displeasure with our own situation that we get pleasure out of laughing at others bad situations. This is also very unhealthy. Lets show each other a bit of compassion, we've all fell for the same bullshit.  https://t.co/NizQuiHEgs

1333953404666777601 2020-12-02 09:57:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Sometimes episodes of the Sopranos went too quickly and you didn‚Äôt realise the high art of almost every scene, rarely was there any filler in the show.  https://t.co/ZzOsmlkMfv

1333927119118888960 2020-12-02 08:13:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MoDellawn How many deaths is Oswald Mosley responsible for? None, he was against war. Now how many deaths is Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for? It probably stretchs into 10s of millions.   So who is the real evil hateful bigot?
1333926240630284289 2020-12-02 08:09:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MoDellawn Calling out hateful people is not hate, it's moral.
1333925972144398336 2020-12-02 08:08:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MoDellawn The only hate I see is from them, to Palestinians, to Iranians, to Syrians, to Russians, to Germans etc. You don't get thrown out of 109 counties for nothing.
1333924753673957377 2020-12-02 08:03:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MoDellawn Because it's a pattern. Bernie Madoff, George Soros, Jeffery Epstein, the Sackler family,  Jordan Belfort, Harvey Weinstein.

1333558977699983361 2020-12-01 07:50:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @shiftingdunes I think this is old footage so who knows, probably whinging because Islam doesn‚Äôt support LGBTQ.
1333558646500888577 2020-12-01 07:48:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SerenaJB3 @Partisangirl Because the designers have no soul. All communist architecture is the same.

1333546073441378305 2020-12-01 06:58:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But they showed no loyalty to us so why should we to them. I owe loyalty to the customer who I have been working for, not the ones that just drop you on a whim.  People are full of shit, they believe what they want to believe.
1333545703101050881 2020-12-01 06:57:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> So we get a phone call asking if we can fit them a new boiler, we can‚Äôt because we‚Äôre too busy, customer then says we should drop everything because of the amount of work they give us. I know for a fact they‚Äôll be bitching and whinging about loyalty.
1333545146005196800 2020-12-01 06:55:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> So the customer dumbed both us and the electrical firm, we haven‚Äôt done any work for them in well over a year, turns out the builder now doesn‚Äôt want any of the work(my suspicion is that he knows there‚Äôs no money there due to Covid).
1333544601299333123 2020-12-01 06:53:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Personal story here, we plumbed out a boutique hotel for a customer who had fell out with his builder, toward the end of the job the builder returned, he stipulated that if he was going to start working for the customer again he wanted the plumbing and the electrics contacts back
1333543216180846595 2020-12-01 06:47:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The only people who would go to the wire for Trump are people who benefit from him financially, standing by someone like that is not loyalty, it‚Äôs looking after your own financial interests.   Loyalty is when you sacrifice something for someone.
1333542447088095232 2020-12-01 06:44:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> If a Israel Defence Forces soldier, came into my hypothetical hospital, after a day of murdering innocent Palestinians, would I help him?   No I‚Äôd let him die.
1333540866892455946 2020-12-01 06:38:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The amount of bullshit I see online is unbelievable, I highly doubt any of this happened.

1333500218084642816 2020-12-01 03:56:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôd argue that they‚Äôre rushing the vaccine out before the virus burns out. #COVID19

John Mann being a Labour example who does this.

1333148438201036806 2020-11-30 04:38:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric During Covid though. I just thought everyone was locked down.

1333146638706159617 2020-11-30 04:31:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Why is gold dropping? Should be rocketing due to the money printing going on.
1333146101411688454 2020-11-30 04:29:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LastReconquista @SoldadoIberico7 Correct, both the slave masters and Jake Paul are both Jewish.

1333143964757733380 2020-11-30 04:21:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric Oh no. I just remember a few weeks back you saying your dad was staying with you, I assumed he must be local, maybe a few states away, didn‚Äôt realise he‚Äôd traveled all that way.

In reality living memory is way less in peoples mind than the propaganda that is pushed in the education system and media.

1333115169501810691 2020-11-30 02:26:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TRUESTR1VER They've got as much as a claim to the land as the European settlers and they're noticing that their position in society is effected by this engineered migration. Whether they're being pushed out of higher paid jobs by higher intelligence migrants or noticing their wages lowered
1333039996236914690 2020-11-29 21:27:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini Yeah this fetishisation of men doing awful jobs, for low wages in slave like conditions is kind of weird. Yeah they were strong but they died young too because of it.
1333039265643700224 2020-11-29 21:25:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Enough with the Jake Paul memes, it‚Äôs so desperate and beta. Plus the guy is a wanker and on top of that he‚Äôs a nose goblin. If you‚Äôre that low on racial pride then I feel bad for you.

1332834690235940864 2020-11-29 07:52:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SedJikak It‚Äôs a pure nostalgia thing I think, people reliving their youth. But I‚Äôm still interested in seeing it.

1332756493490384898 2020-11-29 02:41:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I tell you what else I hate seeming as I‚Äôm having a rant, people who completely change their personality depending on who they‚Äôre with, they change their views, their style, how much they post on social media. Mirroring who ever they‚Äôre trying to infiltrate.
1332754835150692355 2020-11-29 02:34:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> And then you get people who are from good stock who are totally dysfunctional too, they can‚Äôt hold a conversation, can‚Äôt make real friends, lazy and seem to go from disaster to disaster.

1332418009848307721 2020-11-28 04:16:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LeaMaric I like the idea of a woman who can cook and keep a clean home but if she spent her evening knitting and sewing I think I'd be mildly irritated and incredibly bored by her.

1332415369726844928 2020-11-28 04:05:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @zoomerwaffenss It's almost like a wind down from the day, then once I'm back in the house I'm devastated if I have to go back out to the car.

You do understand that Mesopotamia (Iraq, Syria etc) was the birthplace of civilisation.
1332413965033476096 2020-11-28 04:00:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Does anyone else play on their phone for 5 minutes in the car before entering the house? A weird habit I've got in.
1332110569856495616 2020-11-27 07:54:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @russian_on @ChineseNat @oscarcdot So there was a point in time where there was just white people in what we now call Europe and black people in what we now call Africa. Then we just started mixing? But the people that you  define as European and African stayed pure. Yeah I'm struggling to buy into this

1332107183723569152 2020-11-27 07:41:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @russian_on @ChineseNat @oscarcdot Ahhh so you have in your head what an African is, so anyone who doesn't match that image is non African, even though all the other races of this MASSIVE continent are also indigenous.
1332106556767432704 2020-11-27 07:38:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @russian_on @ChineseNat @oscarcdot Are Berbers, Morrocans, Egyptians, Somalians and Ghanaians all African because they're all in Africa? Or are the pp paler ones less African because you have an idea in your head what you think an African is?
1332105269124456449 2020-11-27 07:33:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @russian_on @ChineseNat @oscarcdot What exactly is their definition of African and then what is yours? Africa is a continent of many different races.
1332102693826027532 2020-11-27 07:23:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ChineseNat @Duginism @oscarcdot @russian_on I just want him to explain himself better. Are Germans less European because they're closer to Slavs than the French? Are Norwegians less because they're closer to Eskimos?
1332101666695491591 2020-11-27 07:19:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @russian_on @ChineseNat @oscarcdot Do northern Europeans also become less European the closer the get to Eskimos?

1332100850001596416 2020-11-27 07:16:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @oscarcdot @russian_on @ChineseNat Islam is a Middle Eastern religion just like Christianity. This comment isn't helpful.
1332100398975430658 2020-11-27 07:14:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @russian_on @ChineseNat @oscarcdot You seem very bought into these modern borders and continents, most of North Africa was part of the Roman Empire but you call them all "non whites" and not indigenous because they're not Russians who live in Sweden.

1331375244423159808 2020-11-25 07:12:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri I 100% agree. I‚Äôve actually experienced it off two separate people now, I just never really got offended by it because both people were as pathetic af. But it‚Äôs depressing because it gives you a jaded view of humanity.
1331373482039537671 2020-11-25 07:05:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Yep I should have been, I‚Äôm probably too polite until I‚Äôm not. I don‚Äôt seem to have a grey area.
1331372920866807809 2020-11-25 07:03:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @GreekPale Yeah it‚Äôs depressing, although I can really ignore gender online, men still act like men and women like women. Which is a positive imo
1331372637512216580 2020-11-25 07:02:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri My recent interaction was someone who kept making sly digs all the time but then pretending they didn‚Äôt mean it, so I just started ignoring them.
1331370219202367489 2020-11-25 06:52:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Energy vampires suck out all your energy when you spend time with them then get upset when you don‚Äôt want to spend time with them.

1331343223323758593 2020-11-25 05:05:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Women, do you find this attractive? If this was a Norwegian chick I‚Äôd probably be simping.
1331341834728185859 2020-11-25 05:00:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AQuantumCat1 @GreekPale Well I personally think it‚Äôs fine to talk or even simp(to a degree) after normal women but it‚Äôs absolutely bizarre to do it to these one who you have to donate to and who 100s of other men also simp after them. It‚Äôs obviously just a grift
1331339772518862848 2020-11-25 04:51:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @GreekPale Basically following online girls round like a lapdog.
1331330778425421825 2020-11-25 04:16:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The Covid bullshit is really irritating me, hearing Jeremy Vine, on Radio 2, openly shill for the "amazing vaccine" just makes me more sceptical. The guy is without doubt a propagandist.

1331324644754935813 2020-11-25 03:51:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I can kind of bluff a few eras before my time with the music, news and history but it's not the same, you don't have any first hand experience of those eras and you won't properly understand them.
1331323353521676295 2020-11-25 03:46:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> You remember the same movies from when you were kids, the same music from your teens, wore the same horrendous fashions you thought we're cool af at the time.
1331322550199185408 2020-11-25 03:43:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I have both friends older than me and younger than me but there's something way more relaxing being with people of you're own age/generation. I don't know if anyone else feels that, it's like you had that era in time together and it's a bond.
1331015223206158343 2020-11-24 07:22:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @UncleHotep *Jewish husband* expect her do nothing to benefit anyone or thing but Israel.

1330963542581915655 2020-11-24 03:56:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Find a nice Pakistani doctor, give him ¬£100 pounds cash and get him to sign you off for having the #COVID19 vaccine without actually taking it. That's what I'll be doing for my freedom pass.
1330960291367178240 2020-11-24 03:43:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I've never seen so much positive propaganda favour of anything like I've seen about this vaccine.   That alone makes me extremely sceptical.

1330693484320333825 2020-11-23 10:03:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealDylanKnight This is dumb, under the official narrative of the Holocaust J*ws have been able to guilt trip every nation on the entire globe(whether involved or not), steal Palestine from the indigenous people and carry out a 72 ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.
1330690448093048834 2020-11-23 09:51:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @oxbakerunderta1 Haha. Fair enough.

1330689251969818626 2020-11-23 09:46:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He doesn‚Äôt really have any arguments, he just keeps calling me a fascist and saying fascism is bad. when in reality I hold no affinity to outdated ideologies but he‚Äôs also offended that I‚Äôm critical of Bolshevism. The irony isn‚Äôt lost on me.
1330688388895297536 2020-11-23 09:43:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> A communist who wants to uphold the banking system. What a time to be alive.
1330687938552803330 2020-11-23 09:41:42 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealDylanKnight But please answer my question, what is bad about my objectives?
1330687031622705153 2020-11-23 09:38:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Kalasherie Dylan is actually a Welsh/Anglo name, Bobby Zimmerman just adopted it from the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas.
1330686696447500288 2020-11-23 09:36:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealDylanKnight You‚Äôre misunderstanding banking and usury. Maybe you‚Äôre not cut out for this conversation. You can have one without the other.
1330685365716463616 2020-11-23 09:31:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Free Palestine indeed, the Jews are not indigenous to holy land and have no place there. Finally we agree on something.
1330684783123451906 2020-11-23 09:29:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealDylanKnight Anglo Irish in fact. I believe all races should unite against the evil supremacy ideology of Zionism and Jewish power, including their influence in capitalism via the banking system(usury) and also their heavy influence in communism. Tell me why this is bad?

1330682357683204098 2020-11-23 09:19:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Flaunting my power levels in fact, hiding them as if. üòâ
1330681676155019270 2020-11-23 09:16:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealDylanKnight @TheWayWithAnoa I‚Äôm just an anti Zionist who woke up to Jewish influence in Bolshevism. I don‚Äôt know what your definition of a Nazi is but I‚Äôm definitely against racial supremacy, hence my issue with Judaism. No need to hide my power levels at all. I‚Äôm an open book.

1330640292177907712 2020-11-23 06:32:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @shiftingdunes @blckriflecoffee Who Black Rifle?
1330639886370615296 2020-11-23 06:30:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I actually know quite a few veterans and all of them think the wars were bullshit and wouldn't allow their sons to sign up. I find the organisations like @blckriflecoffee who try to liononise members of the US industrial military complex quite problematic.
1330633285081444355 2020-11-23 06:04:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I didn't realise they were this tiny. Pretty insignificant considering the mainstream media exposure they get.   I am Jack's complete lack of suprise.
1330627405334138888 2020-11-23 05:41:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Sounds like a dox. Not this time Mrs Fed. üòÜ
1330627208751308809 2020-11-23 05:40:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> One day people on the right are going to have to face up to the VQ(veteran question) how most veterans are not heros but simple minded, narcissistic, grifters who uphold the very system that is destroying us and the rest of the world.
1330626496558473217 2020-11-23 05:37:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Adopt me!
1330625971666481162 2020-11-23 05:35:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @blckriflecoffee @goodblackdude @ElijahSchaffer @LLinWood @EvanHafer Really going to enjoy seeing you phoneys go bankrupt off the back of this.
1330625368097755136 2020-11-23 05:33:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But just to clarify the ideology of @blckriflecoffee is supporting veterans, who kill innocent civilians, in ZOG wars, in the Middle East but is against 17 year olds defending themselves from child sex predators in America.
1330624601676771332 2020-11-23 05:30:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Hahahaha, as it this account actually had a subscription. ü§£ https://t.co/hw6ygVTMfG
1330624038461448193 2020-11-23 05:27:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Hilarious though how they have completely disenfranchised the entire demographic they would normally market to while simultaneously not winning the respect of the woke liberals either.  Fence sitting, centrist, shekel grabbers get the rope.
1330616004276269060 2020-11-23 04:55:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mynamespetelol @kyubi_chibi They're more interested in Shekels than ideology. Check their replies.
1330615685060366337 2020-11-23 04:54:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I completely see the bitch in these guys who cover themselves in tattoos, it only intimidates the weak, most can't even hold eye contact during a conversation.

1330522128970616833 2020-11-22 22:42:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RajLionBose @vicwinsj I disagree though, they are what to average person associates with Jews, yeah they‚Äôre not the tribe in the Bible but they are the tribe today we call J*ws.

1330518348598218755 2020-11-22 22:27:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @begomeorthodox I guess it‚Äôs an Assyrian who recognises the old borders and ethnic group in Syria? I dunno you should know this more than me.
1330517679770316800 2020-11-22 22:25:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Actually quiet shocked(but not really) how fast all the mainstream media turned on @TeamKhabib just because he condemned Macron.   I think that alone exposes Macron‚Äôs power levels.
1330516495928074240 2020-11-22 22:20:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @begomeorthodox Ok I just read his bio, WTAF is a Assyrian Zionist?

1330514821180231680 2020-11-22 22:13:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Quite the least you‚Äôd expect considering they‚Äôre paying ¬£7000 per term to sit in the house.

1330513599387799553 2020-11-22 22:08:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> ‚ÄúIn a situation like this, a good leader has only one choice: take action‚Äù  Cringe @blckriflecoffee   #BlackRifleCoffee #KyleRittenhouse   This is the hypocrisy I hate, people(capitalists and communists) pretending to care when in reality they‚Äôre completely self driven.
1330512461246713856 2020-11-22 22:04:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is cringe, let‚Äôs be honest, coffee is coffee. The only reason this brand is big is because they pander towards the RW demographic for profit.  Now they‚Äôve decided to turn their back on this demographic in case it effects their multimillion pound turnover  Once a grifter...

1330499267639832577 2020-11-22 21:11:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini @3rdPositionKeri It's called "Mudshark orange" apparently. üòÜ

1330495417428168704 2020-11-22 20:56:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri @Wotadini I would like to put my crazy youthful autism down to it but I was mentally long before my BCG. üòÜ

1330494853730471936 2020-11-22 20:54:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @GcRevenge Six million is nothing more than a number with religious significance in Judasim. They were claiming it long before the 1940s. Not being "edgy" at all.  https://t.co/87QwIx1rOK

1330477284055257091 2020-11-22 19:44:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> People arguing in the replies by mocking the mass outrage and dishonest reporting about the death of George by propping up the exaggeration of the Holocaust.   They are absolutely brilliant at playing us TBF.

1330254772478357508 2020-11-22 05:00:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @EurasianDespot @Yankeestani Yeah but they need an excuse and that would have gave them one, buy buying time Assad managed to get the support of Iran and arguably Russia(although Russia may have another agenda)
1330252604920705026 2020-11-22 04:51:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Basically what I‚Äôm saying is politicised people are full of shit, if you want to care for a certain demographic then just do it, stop taking about it because I seem to see a lot of talk and not much action.
1330252187851689987 2020-11-22 04:50:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> And it‚Äôs the same with left wingers too, they like to claim they care about the working class, vulnerable women and minorities but they don‚Äôt give two f*cks. Rotherham and the grooming scandal could never have happened if they did.
1330251730043416581 2020-11-22 04:48:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They‚Äôve actually been doing it for years but they don‚Äôt talk about it, I only found out by accident because one of the sisters was upset because one of the homeless men had died. Until then they‚Äôd never spoke about it.
1330250998414249985 2020-11-22 04:45:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> There‚Äôs a Bangladeshi family I know who owns a few restaurants in my area, they take the leftover food and feed most of the homeless(who are ethnically British) in my area. Has @PatAlternative ever fed the homeless? Not that I‚Äôm aware of.
1330250050522517504 2020-11-22 04:41:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I see I lot of rank hypocrisy in people on the left and the right, people who claim to care about certain demographics but actually do nothing for them.
1330249776433074181 2020-11-22 04:40:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I wear a mask because I‚Äôm a good person, not because i do nice things.

1330247974421745668 2020-11-22 04:33:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @yazbashar $4000 per week all day, most ‚Äúbusiness mentors‚Äù are only rich because they‚Äôre part of the international tribe that controls global finance. This idea that you can make it in this system with a great idea and good work ethic needs to be debunked.
1330245604337913868 2020-11-22 04:24:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @BigPoppaRusty Cheers.
1330245524226793472 2020-11-22 04:23:42 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It‚Äôs not a free market, you‚Äôre not rewarded for productivity, it‚Äôs just wage slavery, ran by the bitterest of people, who make decisions emotionally opposed to because is benefits the company and employees as a whole.
1330244764835385349 2020-11-22 04:20:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Basically the capitalist model is completely broken, the wage structure bears no resemblance to how much money you create or save, there‚Äôs a set amount you earn, within a certain bracket and if you slightly step out your bracket then everyone is riddled with jealousy.
1330243870811189260 2020-11-22 04:17:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> There‚Äôs no political message to this story, it‚Äôs just a rant and that supposed capitalists are still riddled with jealousy with working class people doing well even when it‚Äôs totally inconsequential to the money they earn.
1330243332497436673 2020-11-22 04:14:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Now you‚Äôd think a capitalist company would would approve of someone who makes fortunes for them having nice possessions but it‚Äôs rarely the case. The whole system is pure hypocrisy.
1330242876157128704 2020-11-22 04:13:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Basically ¬£14 million per annum(of which about ¬£10.5 million was profit) lost, for a salary that was under ¬£50k because they argued about ¬£200 per month on a car allowance.
1330242301415854080 2020-11-22 04:10:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They used to get a company car allowance and because they bought a sports car with it the management tried to cut it. So they quit their job on principle. That was over 10 year‚Äôs ago and that well known builder has never got one shared ownership sale in the entire company.
1330241667367100418 2020-11-22 04:08:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Another case we were talking about was a family member of mine, they used to do a type house sale with the government that no one else seemed to be able to do. They would bring in about ¬£14 million worth of sales a year for a wage of under ¬£50,000 per annum.
1330241088620204034 2020-11-22 04:06:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I did a job for one guy, I must have saved him almost a couple of hundred thousand pounds, towards the end of the job he knocked my hourly rate down out of nothing but spitefulness. Now he‚Äôs got no one do do his work so he‚Äôs going to start getting ripped of again. Shortsighted.
1330240441401348097 2020-11-22 04:03:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Why do some capitalists get so bitter about people who work for them making too much money? Even when they‚Äôre either saving fortunes or making fortunes out of the person? Most capitalists don‚Äôt actually believe in the idea of the free market, they just believe in exploitation.
1330094509980577793 2020-11-21 18:23:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @JackDeeth @scots_subrosa @scotgov Correct, people actually died for Remembrance Day.
1330094139569037324 2020-11-21 18:22:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It‚Äôs literally nonstop, day in, day out.
1330093887604600835 2020-11-21 18:21:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Zero transsexuals have been murdered in the U.K. this year.   Why are they so intent on promoting and making a victim of this extremely minor group?

1329573163454390273 2020-11-20 07:51:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I'm not even going as far as Richard in saying Trump wasn't robbed of the election.  I'm saying I just don't care.  It's all rigged anyway.
1329562837707091968 2020-11-20 07:10:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôd never even heard of this ‚Äúconservative‚Äù grifter till a few days ago but I‚Äôm already blown away by what little I already know.

1329199004970872837 2020-11-19 07:05:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I hate this way people who fall from grace make out their friends all left them when they went bankrupt, what they leave out is the fact that when they were rich they treated all their original friends like shit so they left long before the bankruptcy.

1329186964935995394 2020-11-19 06:17:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I listen to a few of @jamesenglish0‚Äôs podcasts and positivity and energy is important, you hear two incredibly similar stories, one told by Darren Gee, one by Marvin Herbert. One makes you depressed, the other is exhilarating.
1329185471436611586 2020-11-19 06:11:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @H__Ganon @dorregaray_pepe I need to see the end of this.
1329184121529241600 2020-11-19 06:06:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But it can just as easily apply to toxic friendships and toxic relationships too.
1329183529826201601 2020-11-19 06:03:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is no more than a subtweet about being in a positive work environment all week and having to call into a negative one for a couple of hours. It literally brings everyone down.
1329180286182191108 2020-11-19 05:50:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Being around good people makes life so easy, you like them, you like yourself, anything seems achievable.   Being around toxic people is cancer, even if it‚Äôs just for a couple of hours, it fills you with hate, making you dislike people in general.  Cut these people out your life.

1329005195007766528 2020-11-18 18:15:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Surely if this is achievable then hydrogen cars would be a better solution than electric cars. I dunno.
1329004611974418432 2020-11-18 18:12:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This sounds way more achievable than making everyone drive an electric car but it‚Äôs basically gone unreported.  https://t.co/NfTaviOXS1

1329003233092755458 2020-11-18 18:07:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Sainsbury‚Äôs made the advert deliberately then went out of their way to reply to all the outrage, it‚Äôs a form of gorilla marketing, a trap so they can go viral with a certain demographic, like the ‚ÄúAre you beach body ready‚Äù advert was aimed at outraging a different demographic.
1328879183678885889 2020-11-18 09:54:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Drinking till 4am probably didn't help either mind.

1328874870311161856 2020-11-18 09:37:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Obviously the Trump support and trying to blame everything on Islam isn't great either.

1328872163642908675 2020-11-18 09:26:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Why do people adopt a fashionable personality type that they copied from the mass of Instagram profiles? Why do people replicate each others speech patterns? It's a weird internet phenomenon.

1328093322808844292 2020-11-16 05:51:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> In some ways it‚Äôs better Biden has won, I think the BLM Rioters would have rioted under Trump but the rightwing Fluthers will never obey Biden‚Äôs Covid rules but they would have followed the rules if Trump made them.

1327767903194714115 2020-11-15 08:18:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mcmean_josh Maybe you're in an echo chamber, maybe you don't interact with other races, they may be different but they aren't evil either.
1327766073412886528 2020-11-15 08:11:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mcmean_josh I think race is real but the Dissident Right get autisticlly hung up on it. Way too much. Different races and religions can share a land mass, they generally separate but it is workable. A never ending stream of new citizens won't though.
1327764356617166849 2020-11-15 08:04:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mcmean_josh Keep dreaming. You'll never achieve it, you couldn't even get 5% of indigenous Brits onboard with your plan.

There's not an option of living in an all white country still ruled by J*ws like everyone on the Dissident Right thinks.
1327758764150304772 2020-11-15 07:42:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mcmean_josh Many of them hate the chosen people way more than us. And it's the chosen people who engineer this.
1327758034085568513 2020-11-15 07:39:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mcmean_josh Not true.
1327757954041393153 2020-11-15 07:38:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mcmean_josh Having the civil war that J*ws are trying to engineer anyway is a surefire way to lose, red pilling migrants of the JQ is a far better strategy. But they're not interested in winning, they just want to virtue signal to the right even though they'll lose by a landslide.

1326842159690108928 2020-11-12 18:59:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RajLionBose Not me, I've never seen it.
1326841968719245316 2020-11-12 18:59:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @jimineuropa @amalieskram Ahhhh merci

1326840121690361856 2020-11-12 18:51:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> And again.  https://t.co/n70QCMxBGo
1326839779238047744 2020-11-12 18:50:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It's a common theme.  https://t.co/qHHpH1CtEP
1326839371648147457 2020-11-12 18:48:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Lol, even Muslims associate liberalism with anti white rhetoric. ü§î
1326838283729571840 2020-11-12 18:44:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @a_leesha1 Wiping global debt for everyone and ending usury would fix it.
1326834123680452608 2020-11-12 18:28:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> And it's still more sane and wholesome than Drag Queen Story Hour.  Amazing how many people think this is crazy while being totally oblivious to their own f'd up environment.
1326832806106980353 2020-11-12 18:22:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Probably one of the most decisive accounts on Twitter.
1326829070756311041 2020-11-12 18:07:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SkyNews Here is another idea, erase global debt for everyone, outlaw usury. That will fix it.
1326828753905971200 2020-11-12 18:06:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Looks like they want to make the poor pay for the shutting down of small businesses to benefit global corporations and Track and Trace etc.   Nope.
1326816832481849344 2020-11-12 17:19:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Mimi4Mi He‚Äôs Jewish apparently.

1326692711857090561 2020-11-12 09:06:05 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Who owns the banks? Who owns the media? Who runs the music industry Ian?
1326684435861958657 2020-11-12 08:33:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> When's he going to talk about you know who's in the music industry? He can't not know they're running it. I'm always sceptical of celebrity activists.

1326654904077873152 2020-11-12 06:35:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Yeah I'm starting to realise it's pretty rough for some, would normally have drove over to see him but you're literally not allowed and plus I'm mad busy ATM.

1326652448900050944 2020-11-12 06:26:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Was speaking to a 25 year old today, it's fucking him up pretty bad, he lives in the country in a family owned complex, the pub is shut where he normally drinks and eats, he can't go to the gym, he can't socialise with friends, he's just totally isolated. All he does is work
1326648172052176896 2020-11-12 06:09:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Nurse actually looks a bit Tranny.
1326648058071961602 2020-11-12 06:08:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @HeilHonkler Or in Spain during the Spanish Inquisition, or Russian when the murdered millions of Christians, or England when they were expelled after Magna Carta, or Ukraine when they engineered the Holodomor famine, or Hungary during the Hungarian revolution......
1326646663612690437 2020-11-12 06:03:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Probably not even a nurse or soldier, just a LARP and PR stunt.
1326645870876643329 2020-11-12 05:59:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They had respect in Europe?
1326645789649739778 2020-11-12 05:59:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Is Israel trying to use #Azerbaijan as a proxy state in the way they see Iran using Lebanon and Syria?
1326643609517633536 2020-11-12 05:50:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @amalieskram @jimineuropa Emily rhymes with Paris?
1326642526321774593 2020-11-12 05:46:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI Interesting blood type though but it only allows you to breed with other O Negative people. Not that this is relative to you of course.
1326642187380133893 2020-11-12 05:45:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The 5% gang just refused to vote for a president that didn‚Äôt build them a wall, made Israel his number 1 issue and pardoned loads of Jewish criminals.   He was also stoking a war with Iran by murdering Soleimani.   Can‚Äôt really blame them for not voting TBF.
1326641021078396929 2020-11-12 05:40:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Imagine having as unoriginal ideas as this then having the media promote you as some sort enlightened mind.   Then imagine you‚Äôre not that bright and you start believing the hype about you is real.   Just imagine obviously.
1326638764417052672 2020-11-12 05:31:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI Ignore me, I just realised she meant the band.

1326635892895834117 2020-11-12 05:20:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It‚Äôs why online politics is so irritating, everyone has their own reality.

1326507792765759489 2020-11-11 20:51:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Wonder if #Trump will do anything for #KyleRittenhouse before he leaves office? I bet he just hangs him out to dry.
1326504119469740034 2020-11-11 20:36:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> There‚Äôs a very high chance that Erdogan is Donmeh
1326503764132499457 2020-11-11 20:35:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SwordofGalaxios We are atm but hopefully not much longer
1326503624932007936 2020-11-11 20:34:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Jews have a serious issue with the Armenians, it was a Donmeh(Crypto Jewish) elite who ordered the Ottomans to carry out the Armenian Genocide, Israel armed the #Azerbaijan side during their current dispute and Turkey supplied mercenaries.  These people hold grudges for centuries
1326502439785287681 2020-11-11 20:30:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SwordofGalaxios I don‚Äôt think they get that much cheap Labour from Turkey tbh. Not in the U.K. anyway.
1326500214409203712 2020-11-11 20:21:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SwordofGalaxios I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs claiming that though. He‚Äôs saying Armenia played by all of NATO‚Äôs liberal rules and they turned a blind eye while a dictator broke all of them with another NATO member.
1326498292746903552 2020-11-11 20:13:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @a_leesha1 The people behind Labour don‚Äôt care, they were more bothered that the leader wasn‚Äôt pro Zionist than what they poled.
1326497670177943552 2020-11-11 20:11:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> ‚ÄúPeople of colour‚Äù omg how progressive.   ‚ÄúColoured people‚Äù omg bigoted racist, resign immediately.
1326489925080977408 2020-11-11 19:40:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini @RealBlackIrish Maybe a milk round.
1326469543972233216 2020-11-11 18:19:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It's Alistair Campbell's daughter btw.
1326469097383727106 2020-11-11 18:17:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Now do your dad sexing up the dossier for war in Iraq and see if you can do a funny TikTok dance for the 500,000 dead Iraqi children.  Oh but Dominic Cummings drove during lockdown. Get some perspective.
1326465420547805185 2020-11-11 18:02:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TRUESTR1VER Technically a resignation but he was obviously forced.
1326464590557966336 2020-11-11 17:59:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> In the olden days people used to say "coloured people" because they thought saying "black" or "brown" was racist, then coloured became un-PC. Now we're told to call them "people of colour" or POC, I also see BAME being used. It's all bollocks.
1326461188088139777 2020-11-11 17:46:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The real American religious holiday.
1326457447943430147 2020-11-11 17:31:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This is just a case of an old man trying to be politically correct but using the politically correct terminology of yesteryear. This is how crazy it it, it's not about bigotry or hate in the heart, it's about being on trend with the current terminology.
1326338694954045441 2020-11-11 09:39:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Are any of these things even worthy of a telling off never mind resigning?

1326292080453431296 2020-11-11 06:34:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Bigteabelly No they‚Äôre just literally ethnically cleansing them, I‚Äôm sure the Palestinians would rather have our deal as shit as it is.
1326289578060345344 2020-11-11 06:24:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @JewishCatMother @SerenaJB3 @SmirkingDamsel TBF Jews may dislike white people but it‚Äôs not just white people, it‚Äôs all Goyim(yes they do use this term). It‚Äôs just when they‚Äôre in majority countries like ours they try to create conflict with minorities, they do exactly the same in majority brown country too.
1326277247746117638 2020-11-11 05:35:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI Are we sure it‚Äôs even real?
1326268924523126784 2020-11-11 05:02:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AaronBastani TBF the metropolitans that call themselves ‚Äúsocialists‚Äù in the U.K. just want cheap foreign labour, cheap cleaners, cheap waiters and cheap gardeners. They just dress it up as a love for diversity, in reality they want a slave class.

1326265565552447489 2020-11-11 04:48:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @cashmoneyglock It‚Äôs ok a understand it now, just to add though that those privileged ‚Äúwhites‚Äù that Greg says benefit from Trump are also traitors, idgaf if they go bankrupt.
1326264287447355392 2020-11-11 04:43:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I also literally don‚Äôt care who has won either.
1326264111131488259 2020-11-11 04:42:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I wouldn‚Äôt have voted for Trump if I‚Äôd been American but I wouldn‚Äôt have voted for Biden either, what is the matter with Americans?

1326125464226770945 2020-11-10 19:32:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Jeremy Vine suggesting being anti vaccine should be a criminal offence. Literally can't stand this shill. #bbcradio2 #JeremyVine
1326102900217622530 2020-11-10 18:02:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They're really running with this vaccine bullshit. #Covid #bbcradio2

1326090471064604674 2020-11-10 17:13:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The PM of Armenia was installed by a Soros-backed color revolution. Perhaps the reason the recent settlement didn't make both sides happy is because the Armenian side isn't necessarily representative of the Armenian people &amp; didn't negotiate well enough. Just a thought...
1325955323627188225 2020-11-10 08:15:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Russia is as ZOG as America, they just do it more lowkey. #Armenia
1325911052190674944 2020-11-10 05:20:03 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @EPhiliosophy Try the Dogme 95 brand.
1325908995631177734 2020-11-10 05:11:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @cashmoneyglock @Marcus2Punished @Taimuaut0 Yeah he found me and blocked me lately too, just as he became irrelevant.
1325908485515730946 2020-11-10 05:09:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri It's just a team sport for them. Pathetic.
1325907157389365248 2020-11-10 05:04:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Kamala has some skeletons it's seems. Voters are so fickle and short memoried.
1325905318648438785 2020-11-10 04:57:16 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Bet she's shit at her job too.
1325905100666253317 2020-11-10 04:56:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The level of narcissism on TikTok is out of control.
1325904095446753281 2020-11-10 04:52:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think going down the Nazi route is a dead end, whether you believe the WW2 myths or not, the truth is though that J*ws are toxic towards non Jews, look how they treat Palestinians, it's all projection, it's them who are the evil supremacist race/religion.
1325903237447356416 2020-11-10 04:49:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It's very easy for me to believe the election was rigged because all democracies are rigged.   2016 was probably rigged too.
1325902428269662208 2020-11-10 04:45:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @JoeRudyard Even Trump says they built it.
1325900437053206530 2020-11-10 04:37:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Basically the team behind him are all Goblins high up in TV, I was reading an article about a couple of them who were out partying after having a newborn baby and they were bragging that Harry Styles (who lived with them,WTF?) was doing the babysitting.
1325718189150515201 2020-11-09 16:33:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Twitter with the nonstop Trump shilling and Biden shilling is almost unbearable. They‚Äôre both the enemies of their bases but both sides are trying to spin them as the saviour of humanity.
1325615381277503488 2020-11-09 09:45:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Any Libtard that thinks a Biden victory will benefit humanity though is just crazy. He‚Äôs just another neoliberal war criminal.
1325615034416951296 2020-11-09 09:43:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think part of the bitterness is simply that the Libtards believe they have won rather than Trump losing. Well I hope it is anyway.
1325614648071237632 2020-11-09 09:42:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The energy is called delusion. üòÇ
1325614252556742657 2020-11-09 09:40:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Trump can‚Äôt still win it has that Bernie can still win it energy.
1325610253958991874 2020-11-09 09:24:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I need to start training again.
1325609930515214336 2020-11-09 09:23:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri Jesus Christ. Found out a few interesting things about his background so it probably make sense.
1325609519301451778 2020-11-09 09:21:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @yazbashar Very few have a life in this Covid nightmare.
1325609330922631168 2020-11-09 09:21:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RGoldblatzberg Yeah probably because he was more Chabad than Soros. I can‚Äôt see why I should support either side though, both are our enemies.
1325584316009766912 2020-11-09 07:41:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They really push the Hegelian dialect hard at Red Ice these days, Trump was nothing more than a puppet himself, why should I be upset he‚Äôs been replaced by another puppet.
1325576381271592965 2020-11-09 07:10:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LoudnC @Paddy56201745 @tariqnasheed Also O was mixed race, mixed people seem to hold little loyalty to either side hence why they're great pawns for the establishment

1325571904107909120 2020-11-09 06:52:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The mink strain of #Covid never really gained any traction, i think everyone is burned out by Covid fear porn, even the true believers
1325570223643250698 2020-11-09 06:45:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Post Brexit their was an energy that things could change, feel so naive looking back now.

1325568725878190081 2020-11-09 06:39:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Can't actually believe Trump got elected 4 years today, time is really flying.
1325566929248120832 2020-11-09 06:32:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Really can't understand the post #Election2020 cognitive dissonance that many right thinking people are now thinking he was their president. Really weird, he hated them, he jailed them and he condemned them.
1325528216413626371 2020-11-09 03:58:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Omg but he's so cynical normally. üôÑ
1325527860019343360 2020-11-09 03:57:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Are these people really this easy to win over? Simply discuss the latest on trend political topic and they'll happily go along with the neoliberal agenda of perpetual war in the Middle East and Africa.
1325507316351979520 2020-11-09 02:35:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> No matter who you vote for, Israel wins.   And only now the MAGAtards acknowledge that America‚Äôs democracy is rigged.

1325503187395223555 2020-11-09 02:19:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TheRealZafak @3rdPositionKeri They photoshop and airbrush these fat photos to death, make the fat look round and tight instead of cottage cheese, so much for body positivity or whatever bullshit they try to push it as.
1325489929204412419 2020-11-09 01:26:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They turn a blind eye to Israeli influence when their guy Trump wins though.
1325486273071636480 2020-11-09 01:12:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> If it was the other way round and the Frenchman was doing an impression of the African American then Ash would be calling it racism.

1323057919961813001 2020-11-02 08:22:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @MashasDissent @LeaMaric Yeah the bar is low, I'm just joking, it's nothing to be proud about.
1323057659784867852 2020-11-02 08:21:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> So I'm obviously a key worker and have to work #Lockdown2 but I'm still wanting the public to clap for me every Thursday evening. Just checking you're all onboard. #ClapForMe

1322692842914041856 2020-11-01 08:12:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ademharakat Well it's not spicy so yeah you might think it's bland, it's quite rich though.
1322692185578479616 2020-11-01 08:09:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I can see how it could look weird to the untrained eye though, I see stuff on my timeline like this and wonder what's in it and how you eat it.  https://t.co/e7us1QrNPA

1320103216814710785 2020-10-25 04:41:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @kelly_justkel Hair colour too, suits you tho. üëç
1320102373621116928 2020-10-25 04:38:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @kelly_justkel You look totally different.
1320101326861250574 2020-10-25 04:34:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> My biggest worry is that nationalists think Macron is ‚Äúour guy‚Äù I collaborate with ZOG in the clash of the civilisations, this is the rhetoric @RichardBSpencer was pushing a few months back.
1320100641545519116 2020-10-25 04:31:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Just ate a chicken tikka masala pizza, don‚Äôt ever say I didn‚Äôt try the multicultural dream.  https://t.co/HU3Xcxa6m8
1320100057975300098 2020-10-25 04:29:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Macron and the French government are as ZOG as it comes, right back to the French Revolution, the tactical move would be to support the Muslims but people are still too hung up on Zionist, Counter Jihad propaganda.
1320081195514974208 2020-10-25 03:14:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Ciolfilicious1 Why do we need other people to be concerned? We just need to hold the people accountable who are behind it, instead of following their controlled fake opposition.
1320079499485188097 2020-10-25 03:07:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @Ciolfilicious1 What?  https://t.co/LlPPFgf0ue
1320078189344051201 2020-10-25 03:02:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Ciolfilicious1 I hate to break it to you but they aren‚Äôt, Tommy has actually openly said he doesn‚Äôt oppose ethnic replacement and that anyone who does is just a Nazi, he opposes Islam though because his Zionist backers pay him to. Katie is no more than a grifter.
1320077472138919938 2020-10-25 02:59:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Really shutting the sales of ‚Äúnon essential‚Äù in supermarkets just starts the paranoia that drove people to buy 100s of rolls of toilet paper.
1320076089000136705 2020-10-25 02:54:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Ciolfilicious1 Tommy but the same applies to Katie.

1320072012572860418 2020-10-25 02:37:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @QueenOf5heba It‚Äôs an especially bad month anyway, the weathers changing, Stoptober and people are gearing up for Christmas.

1320070447350906881 2020-10-25 02:31:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @DhammaFarmer Someone literally trying to steal the tools you feed yourself and family with, scum of the earth. Rats the lot of them.
1320069367657267206 2020-10-25 02:27:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @DeanWHUFC1989 @CrimeLdn At least he did something. Twitter is the eternal critic.

1320054706673156097 2020-10-25 01:29:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Why would 50 want ‚Äúto go for another spin‚Äù on this old yenta? She really needs to get over herself.
1320053423325257728 2020-10-25 01:23:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Especially after #MeToo I‚Äôve no idea would believe anything that Hollywood pushes, after them all being exposed as rapists, sadists and child abusers. It‚Äôs not that out of the question that they would twist history too.
1320052877612777473 2020-10-25 01:21:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> In fact you could argue that these (((Hollywood Historians))) deliberately twist the truth to take attention of their involvement in the crimes they accuse others of.

1320046206194716672 2020-10-25 00:55:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The only people getting tested for Covid is people who actually want to skive off work, mainly public sector workers, most self employed people are just getting on with being ill.
1320045017847730183 2020-10-25 00:50:32 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ChiuauaTeardrop @john_mcguirk Jews have done way more evil in the world than Catholics though, do you honestly think they get persecuted for no reason?
1320044762737577984 2020-10-25 00:49:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @john_mcguirk I found when I replaced it with Jewish that there was no reason to re-examine it, I was right to be anti Jewish originally.
1320044200059146242 2020-10-25 00:47:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @3rdPositionKeri @TruthbeatsLies It‚Äôs not the cost of diversity, it‚Äôs the goal of it, the people who engineering this, who our politicians collude with, deliberately import the worst examples, so this happens.   So excuse me if I don‚Äôt get excited about a Trump or Boris election victory.

1319970255146487808 2020-10-24 19:53:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> We returned 10 years later and the football team had went to shit, they were absolutely useless, the school had been colonised by the children of bugmen, no people of  working class background could no longer afford to move to the area. The bugmen had won.
1319969622486093826 2020-10-24 19:50:56 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Weird memory, I remember when I went to school a reasonably affluent North East area, I remember all my classmates parents were mostly shipyard workers who'd went to work on oil rigs, we won every football championship in the league, every year.

1319960004393316353 2020-10-24 19:12:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @QueenOf5heba I think we should look further back for our Ideal.
1319959866421743616 2020-10-24 19:12:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @QueenOf5heba I have the greatest respect for the war generation even if it was built on a lie bit I think every thing post WW2 led is to where we are now, the excessive consumption led to the feckless baby boomer generation who still seem to have the reins of power.
1319957996471013376 2020-10-24 19:04:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @QueenOf5heba Yeah that's sort of what I meant, I also liked this tweet that sort of dumbs on those 1950s tradlife memes.  https://t.co/eUJr9diW3S

1319954347619385344 2020-10-24 18:50:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @QueenOf5heba I agree but the family man alpha meme is also incorrect imo. Not that I don't think men shouldn't look after their families.
1319925598769336322 2020-10-24 16:56:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ademharakat I hate how conditioned even our minds have become to modern bullshit.
1319925340828061697 2020-10-24 16:54:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Customers and even shop assistants became more helpful, that was probably the most rewarding thing about getting in shape, something you literally couldn‚Äôt buy, I wonder if Adele has noticed this?
1319924924342030336 2020-10-24 16:53:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> When I first went self employed in my mid 20s I stopped training, weight creeped up on me and I didn‚Äôt really care or notice, I sort of became a workaholic. When I first got fit again I was shocked how differently people treated me, my opinions were taken more seriously,
1319924298388295681 2020-10-24 16:50:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ademharakat Oh it‚Äôs an ass implant. I thought she might have do some transgender shit.
1319923928018620416 2020-10-24 16:49:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôm not saying there isn‚Äôt a certain type of man who is a gold digger, there most definitely are, I know a few of them but it‚Äôs not typical. Adele‚Äôs ex husband is probably a perfect example.
1319923476170444800 2020-10-24 16:47:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Women are the opposite, they put little value on looks and more importance on wealth, women would never date a good looking poor man but men will actually use their wealth to attract good looking poor woman.
1319922865018470400 2020-10-24 16:45:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Adele wrote made hundreds millions off platinum selling, found international fame but it‚Äôs the weight loss that would now convince me to date her.   Am I incredibly shallow or the opposite?
1319920834627194880 2020-10-24 16:37:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @ademharakat What‚Äôs she done?

1319788615183065093 2020-10-24 07:51:41 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @armpitinspector @hateisbad1 Are you the old Nazbol Conor McGregor fan account?
1319788164500869120 2020-10-24 07:49:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Quite unbelievable that a politician as high profile as IDS would tweet this.
1319785063286964224 2020-10-24 07:37:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This dude is like fresh out the box. Wait till he finds out who owns the banks and runs the media.
1319784212627656704 2020-10-24 07:34:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Oh I‚Äôm not getting my notifications. Nice.
1319744769556348928 2020-10-24 04:57:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI We always used turnips growing up, they looked far more evil too.

1319729552424341504 2020-10-24 03:56:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @RealBlackIrish @Foxtrot_Cop Meh China, Singapore. It‚Äôs all the same to this guy, they‚Äôve both got slanty eyes. üòπ
1319725468753530883 2020-10-24 03:40:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @a_leesha1 So you‚Äôre saying the N word is similar to Paki? Aren‚Äôt you now doing exactly what you accused him of doing?
1319702056882589697 2020-10-24 02:07:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Grift Right. üòÜ

1319698780795604994 2020-10-24 01:54:42 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Wtf goes to an all you can eat restaurant and then eats of her husband's plate and then expects not to pay?   I hate people like this who try to twist everything.   https://t.co/TF1zVQqJFE

1319694050329612293 2020-10-24 01:35:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Better go to Aldi and stock up on car mats.

1319688792152940546 2020-10-24 01:15:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I hear France is kicking there‚Äôs out, I‚Äôm thinking of setting up a refugee charity so I can hoard them. Maybe resettle them in Golders Green or something.
1319687332954591232 2020-10-24 01:09:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @AaronBastani @WillEatYourRich Are you as keen to Balkanise Iran or just foreign countries?
1319686925775757312 2020-10-24 01:07:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> We‚Äôre not English @Wotadini.
1319686021399912454 2020-10-24 01:04:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Nicola Sturgeon must be the most petty politician in the U.K. and we have a lot of stiff competition, a three tier Covid policy isn‚Äôt detailed enough for her so she had to make up a 5 tier one. üôÑ   https://t.co/Q8QheO1gw0
1319684952083079170 2020-10-24 00:59:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SwordofGalaxios @AliSalaam_DTI Japan is an example they love but a Japanese girl told me in reality Japan is occupied by a Crypto Korean elite. As if the Japs would get away with the stand they made in WW2.
1319612991982178304 2020-10-23 20:13:49 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I remember around 2010 there were loads of young leftwing activists in Owen Jones's circle trying to make a name for themselves by preaching diversity feminism etc.  Where are they today?  Well at least Ash Sakar got a career out of it. In a way they got what they preached. üòÜ
1319405813304274945 2020-10-23 06:30:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini Yeah they were quite beautiful actually.
1319388844291227649 2020-10-23 05:23:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SerenaJB3 @DailyMailUK Lol
1319388386252279808 2020-10-23 05:21:18 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini Maybe, I actually came across some pigeon carriers the other day......
1319360266832957440 2020-10-23 03:29:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Jews making billions by getting whole nations hooked on opioids? It could never happen in this day and age...... oh wait.   https://t.co/tqIvJOTPxZ
1319359487891918850 2020-10-23 03:26:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Remember when you had to quit the cabinet because you were having secret meetings with Israel @pritipatel?   https://t.co/se3qy5bKPz
1319359059968073729 2020-10-23 03:24:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Yeah India based Baghdadi Jew David Sassoon got them all hooked on opium and then made the British have two wars with them when the Chinese tried to stop them.   You‚Äôre ancestors are also from India aren‚Äôt they Priti?
1319357976826839040 2020-10-23 03:20:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @KatsuPjxy @wensback @just_hodman @youmemmatsix @Tupperwearjoe White women are just spoiled princesses who spend all day virtue signaling on Twitter pretending to care about BAME people so they people think they have empathy. I‚Äôm so sick of white women.
1319357127551496193 2020-10-23 03:17:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @just_hodman @youmemmatsix White privileged women like Emmy are the worst, I agree.
1319352440362291200 2020-10-23 02:58:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Non English people will be watching this wondering why you‚Äôd put a perfectly healthy 104 year old in a care home.
1319349838740422658 2020-10-23 02:48:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini Yeah he started working away in London and there was no one to clean them out, I was too young so he had to give them away, plus my mother couldn‚Äôt get them back in the loft.
1319348231906656260 2020-10-23 02:41:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Wotadini My dad used to keep pigeons when we were kids, I‚Äôve got nice memories of them.
1319346150852493314 2020-10-23 02:33:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He‚Äôs almost became a parody of himself now.
1319259243325853698 2020-10-22 20:48:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @LinaArabii Tfw no muscular, androgynous gf.
1319056310235791366 2020-10-22 07:21:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Why is Western propaganda so cringe?
1319054328414568449 2020-10-22 07:13:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @niggalini4 Is this guy like the Iranian Milo?
1319053663210536960 2020-10-22 07:11:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I can‚Äôt see the SNP surviving next election.
1319052255010705408 2020-10-22 07:05:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @JayCeeDee98 @MsElemental @SholaMos1 @phughes76340646 Who do you think ‚Äúwhite people‚Äù would least like to find out who their ancestors were?
1319051851506061323 2020-10-22 07:04:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Supreme0ne_ Yeah you‚Äôre probably right.
1319048533220143104 2020-10-22 06:50:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd want an apology and anyone who would is just weird, pure ‚Äòsee I was right‚Äô smugness.
1319048186623938561 2020-10-22 06:49:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They‚Äôre trying to open an opencast mine near where I live and all the working class residents are protesting because they don‚Äôt want the green belt ruined. Obviously they all still hate Thatcher for shutting the mines originally though.
1319047018145251328 2020-10-22 06:44:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think this is a genuine Retvrn account, it‚Äôs not Larpy and it‚Äôs not soft porn. It‚Äôs just about Mediterranean culture.
1319046394439675905 2020-10-22 06:42:21 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Supreme0ne_ Yeah he was sadly, he was one of the early ones. They didn‚Äôt know what they were doing.
1319043432392855558 2020-10-22 06:30:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Supreme0ne_ Yeah it was mainly because someone in my immediate circle died of it, I assumed it was the start of many, in reality it was an anomaly.
1319035951839125504 2020-10-22 06:00:52 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It‚Äôs all just a pantomime, if Andy wasn‚Äôt mayor and didn‚Äôt want another term he‚Äôd be claiming we need a second lockdown, he‚Äôs just terrified of upsetting businesses and voters in Manchester.
1319034092005036033 2020-10-22 05:53:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Some are obviously just on the payroll too but many are genuinely gullible.
1319033422262710278 2020-10-22 05:50:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> They‚Äôre also mainly anti white(whatever that is?) but in reality they‚Äôre just incredibly gullible to MSM propaganda.
1319032365323329536 2020-10-22 05:46:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that I was a true believer in Covid 19 when it came out, lost a few twitter friends over it, made it back up with some others but if you‚Äôre willing to fall out with me over a psyops as big as Covid then you weren‚Äôt worth my time as a friend anyway.
1319030861514346502 2020-10-22 05:40:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI What‚Äôs a yam yam?
1318970493819551745 2020-10-22 01:40:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Oh here we go. Total shill talking points, I take it back, she‚Äôs definitely on the payroll.
1318970211186462722 2020-10-22 01:39:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It feels like this is going to happen no matter who gets in but these people are so caught up it the two party system they can‚Äôt see the wood for the trees
1318968835752558592 2020-10-22 01:34:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Neither place.
1318968157541961737 2020-10-22 01:31:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Eh what? This one 83 year old is to blame for the worldwide coronavirus epidemic? Tell me more about this six week lockdown system you talk of?
1318965889757286400 2020-10-22 01:22:27 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Haven‚Äôt used a Telegram in ages, just picked up a couple of messages late the other day, I‚Äôve now replied, if you read this check your messages.
1318856953788059650 2020-10-21 18:09:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I mean this is just horrendous, who wants to live in a society like this? I wouldn't care if it was 100% homogeneous, it's a dystopian nightmare.  https://t.co/OSF9UHQ02U
1318707575723098114 2020-10-21 08:16:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @BadBackBurnelly @AntisemitismCow @tabrizresist1 @Rafael42938937 It‚Äôs sadly a byproduct of J*wish Supremacy
1318689613070897152 2020-10-21 07:04:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Even to the point of when your at work, you know there‚Äôs cctv around you so you dare not talk with a coworker too long because you‚Äôve no idea who‚Äôs watching.
1318688625794613248 2020-10-21 07:00:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @PatrioticOwl @kayrosef Lol, that one is only on the tip of your tongue because of the New Years Eve sexual assaults. üò≠
1318688086503673856 2020-10-21 06:58:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @begomeorthodox I found out the local Turkish barbers are actually Kurds, these people literally have no shame.
1318680836770877441 2020-10-21 06:29:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think if someone from this era took a time machine back to the 1960s they would be shocked how much more free people were and how less stressed and anxious they‚Äôd feel.
1318680052138184704 2020-10-21 06:26:38 +0800 <PeakyOswald> You can be fined for wearing no seatbelt that a camera catches you not wearing, you now get fined for entering certain neighbourhoods without permission, your registration is permanently monitored, your phone tracks you etc
1318679364234563585 2020-10-21 06:23:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @FXdestination Just having the standard one twitter gives you seems weird.
1318679131328897024 2020-10-21 06:22:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I know it‚Äôs more the Truther type accounts that talk about this stuff but does anyone else get throughly wore out by the amount of modern surveillance? I personally do, it‚Äôs definitely in my top three of something that needs to be eradicated to give people more freedom.
1318678286218788865 2020-10-21 06:19:37 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @The_Maverick85 @cremijeur I guess you‚Äôre just following her because you like her personality?
1318677318265688066 2020-10-21 06:15:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @28Quest I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre being sarcastic.
1318677122873962497 2020-10-21 06:15:00 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Nearly 10 years on twitter, over 100,0000 tweets. Can‚Äôt be arsed to upload a photograph.
1318673791615197185 2020-10-21 06:01:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @TerribleWyvern I used to like Cast but I was a bit too young for the La‚Äôs
1318670475795566592 2020-10-21 05:48:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @tabrizresist1 @Rafael42938937 The question you have to ask them is would they rather live in an all white country ruled by J*ws or a multicultural one with self determination.
1318657204086542336 2020-10-21 04:55:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Not another PM who not going to deliver#Brexit, it's getting ridiculous. #BorisOut
1318656374935609346 2020-10-21 04:52:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SadiesGhost Obviously this is a Photoshop but is the top left photo actually Toobin?
1318654694798036993 2020-10-21 04:45:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I wish I had enough spare time at work to squash a wank in.
1318654278555340808 2020-10-21 04:44:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @410MLXVI Mikes on the cameras. Interesting.
1318653697736540162 2020-10-21 04:41:55 +0800 <PeakyOswald> It's entirely clear to any person what is going on here, Macron and France are not trying to eliminate Wahhabi inspired terrorism, they're just attacking Muslims who oppose the state of Israel.
1318650725719826435 2020-10-21 04:30:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I noticed this.
1318635384126033920 2020-10-21 03:29:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @SwordofGalaxios Trophy wifes are a headache because there is always someone richer, stronger or funnier who's going to go out of their way to pull her, often even right in front of you.
1317985911347568640 2020-10-19 08:28:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @belajabaami You're a repeater, nothing more but you're obviously a child too so you're actually doing exactly what you're meant to be doing. Mimicking others until you're able to critically analyse stuff yourself..... hopefully. Many never learn this ability.

1317984740201406467 2020-10-19 08:23:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @belajabaami I see you started your first year of Uni, such original thoughts here, did you come up with them yourself? Wow you've really blown my mind with your originality.  Somewhere a Jewish "professor" is chuckling. üòÇ
1317983395977306112 2020-10-19 08:18:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @NiallAnglo Really?  https://t.co/5cbxMUDpHa
1317982572241145857 2020-10-19 08:15:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Irusk8 Fuck him, fuck them all, they're all a cancer.

1317981637284679686 2020-10-19 08:11:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @NiallAnglo My point is Christianity in the West has become cucked, I think it's a bad thing, you seem to think it's nobel do do nothing.
1317981142792982528 2020-10-19 08:09:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He was a Roma gypsy apparently, not Muslim.
1317980572912934919 2020-10-19 08:07:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @NiallAnglo No but I'd understand and respect a Christian who made a stand.
1317980159450939392 2020-10-19 08:05:31 +0800 <PeakyOswald> People seem to collect social justice causes like Pok√©mons.   If I see #BlackLivesMatter and #FreePalestine in the same bio I'm 99% sure they've done no research into either.
1317979086275420160 2020-10-19 08:01:15 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @randomrussianb2 ATM yeah, I'm friends with a Bengali family and they're some of the nicest people I know. I know that's a different country but it's close.
1317978566055833600 2020-10-19 07:59:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @NiallAnglo Being passive, weak and doing nothing when people mock your religious figures and attack your religious places of worship is nothing to be proud of.
1317977400253292546 2020-10-19 07:54:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> You say that like it's something to be proud of. ü§î

1317937048511184896 2020-10-19 05:14:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> France hasn‚Äôt got a Muslim problem, it has a teacher problem. üòÇ

Surely we‚Äôll all be happy when we‚Äôre all mindless consumers and out culture is simply our new materialistic purchase.

1315020670426906624 2020-10-11 04:05:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Surely using someone the same ethnic group as Seinfeld when being judgmental about other ethnic groups is a massive own goal when you consider what they have done to non Jews throughout history and still to this day.

1314679324667191296 2020-10-10 05:29:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @calimanoss No it was a white lad.
1314679193985310720 2020-10-10 05:28:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @calimanoss TBF he was white.
1314678071220465664 2020-10-10 05:24:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He was a normal looking lad too, could have been one of my mates at a glance hence why I took sympathy on him but he wasn‚Äôt, he was a rat and there‚Äôs loads of them about.
1314677627681210369 2020-10-10 05:22:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> So I made sure to drop him off on a busy street, waited for his move but he obviously thought twice, a close miss, moral of the story, you can‚Äôt do people favours these days, it‚Äôs not 1940 anymore.
1314677212436729861 2020-10-10 05:20:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> You could cut the atmosphere with a knife, both of us were silent, I was thinking if I get stabbed here people are going to think I knew him, why let a stranger into your car, it would have been I really hard case for the police to solve.
1314676808793686018 2020-10-10 05:19:11 +0800 <PeakyOswald> He then claimed he didn‚Äôt have the money with him but asked if I had a cashcard that I could draw money out with. Now I knew it was on. Luckily I had I hammer in my side door but I was expecting a knife so my plan was to jump out, grab the keys while hitting him with the hammer.
1314676175722164224 2020-10-10 05:16:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> So after driving a few minutes he asked if I had two tenners for a ¬£20 note, he said he needed change to give his lass, I did but I thought I‚Äôm not getting my money out in front of this stranger so I lied, said I didn‚Äôt and asked if he‚Äôd like me to stop at a shop.
1314675556869439491 2020-10-10 05:14:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I pulled over in a nice area of my home city the other week when I normal seeming lad asked if I was a taxi, I said I wasn‚Äôt and then he asked if I could help him as he‚Äôd just had an argument with his lass and couldn‚Äôt get a taxi, it was on my way so i obliged.   My mistake.

1314334832269418496 2020-10-09 06:40:17 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Crackpot theory, Covid has normalised healthy people getting sick and dying, whether it‚Äôs happening or not.

1313937233725059073 2020-10-08 04:20:22 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lucycali88 @EuroReconquest You're trying to take the focus off Jews, Ive seen this Hasbara a thousand times before. Try concentrating more on your current American "Elite" who are actually genociding people in real time for Jewish interests.
1313931071424270344 2020-10-08 03:55:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lucycali88 @EuroReconquest Why are you so bothered about running cover for Jews and creating division between Irish and English proles?
1313930969670447104 2020-10-08 03:55:29 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lucycali88 @EuroReconquest The elites that did cooperate were literally murdered, even Churchill's family who did cooperate were literally paupers at the time, Anglo elites were replaced with traitors willing to sell out to Jews.
1313929272118194177 2020-10-08 03:48:44 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lucycali88 @EuroReconquest Jews were also let back into England after a 350 year expulsion for money lending crimes, first thing they did was reintroduce usury by their newly created Bank of England and then they invaded Ireland.
1313928722303590401 2020-10-08 03:46:33 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @lucycali88 @EuroReconquest Technically though they did play a massive role in it, Dutch Jews funded Oliver Cromwell in the English revolution to overthrow and behead Charles the first, he was then replaced with the Jews puppet king 'William of Orange' heard of him?
1313893937426452482 2020-10-08 01:28:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Weird thing was even as I felt sick I knew I was hungry, it was like my body was refusing to digest it, as soon as I‚Äôd been sick I became staving, ate a whole bowl of pasta. That probably wasn‚Äôt the best move either. üòî
1313893433925349377 2020-10-08 01:26:20 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Technically I should probably quarantine for 14 days and try to get a test all because I had a dodgy sandwich.
1313892821066186753 2020-10-08 01:23:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Worst thing is you can‚Äôt even tell your customers you‚Äôre ill because obviously they‚Äôre going to automatically assumed you‚Äôve got Covid.
1313892547618627588 2020-10-08 01:22:48 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Had a bacon and egg sandwich from a snack van this morning, the woman was on her phone the whole time she served me, totally ignorant, starting feeling ill around 2pm, had to take the afternoon off work even though we‚Äôre really busy.

It‚Äôs pure hypocrisy and deflection.
1312846341610049551 2020-10-05 04:05:34 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I think the way most people are reacting to this tweet is counterproductive, my issue here with Sainsbury‚Äôs is that they‚Äôre perpetuating the myth that racism is everywhere and dividing society further, when in reality they don‚Äôt care about these issues at all.

1312329099394904065 2020-10-03 17:50:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Loads of typos and badly structured sentences in this. I should really proofread these things better. The point stands though. #Lazy
1312327045851099139 2020-10-03 17:42:04 +0800 <PeakyOswald> These people are no better imo that Tommy Robinson, stoking the culture war for Zionists while pretending to represent their ethnic group. Which neither do.
1312326703662981122 2020-10-03 17:40:42 +0800 <PeakyOswald> On top of that they don‚Äôt even follow the religion of the group they claim to represent, Ash was raised by her British stepfather, has a British boyfriend and was posting photos of sex toy on her timeline during Ramadan.
1312325707788357632 2020-10-03 17:36:45 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Media Muslims like Ash Sakar and Yasmin Alibhai-Brown are not only bad for indigenous Brits who they slate and stoke up racism against, they‚Äôre also bad for their own Muslim community, they make them a hated ethnic group by stoking the clash of the civilisations for media barons.
1312324568497958912 2020-10-03 17:32:13 +0800 <PeakyOswald> But the Skintellectual that is given slots on the mainstream mean to push their racist talking points while calling everyone else racist knows they‚Äôre hypocrites, they call out white peoples over micro aggressions while ignoring their own culture.  IRL Muslims are far more honest
1312323670216499200 2020-10-03 17:28:39 +0800 <PeakyOswald> I‚Äôve had same very honest IRL conversation with people from different cultures and religions who are very adamant about their sons, daughters, brother and sisters not only marrying within their own faith but also within their own cultural/ethnic group. I have no issues with this.
1312323013682102272 2020-10-03 17:26:02 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Trying to argue with the skintellectual is a dishonest experience, they‚Äôre themselves very ethnocentric for themselves but also racist(anti white) for pay. They call ethnic Brits racist at every turn for doing things far less ethnocentric that their own family do.
1312183963578855424 2020-10-03 08:13:30 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 I‚Äôm going to knock this on the head here because you‚Äôre not arguing honestly.
1312182862158860288 2020-10-03 08:09:08 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 I‚Äôm not even saying it was a bad thing, you‚Äôre just living in denial, next you‚Äôre going to start pretending there wasn‚Äôt an Islamic slave trade too I guess seeming as you‚Äôre already denying colonialism.
1312182404992311297 2020-10-03 08:07:19 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 You didn‚Äôt invade Africa and South Asia? Islam like Christianity was born in the Middle East, of course it invaded and colonised.
1312181620510658560 2020-10-03 08:04:12 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 I‚Äôm sure forcing people to convert to Christianity is unchristian but it still happened, much like forced conversations to Islam also happened.
1312181218264272898 2020-10-03 08:02:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 I know the story, I‚Äôm just saying he was forced to convert. His group later gained control of the caliphate which later led to the genocide of over a million Armenians Christians. I‚Äôm just pointing out Islam is far from infallible.
1312178919731130368 2020-10-03 07:53:28 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 But I thought you said Islam couldn‚Äôt be subverted? Explain the Donmeh.
1312177077819305985 2020-10-03 07:46:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 Muslims also forced the Persians to convert during the Islamic invasions too, at least argue honestly.
1312176707328122880 2020-10-03 07:44:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 Well technically the Ottoman Empire did force Sabbatai Levi to convert to Islam which actually caused many issues still around today so to say that you‚Äôre simply being dishonest.
1312174486507016194 2020-10-03 07:35:51 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 Hmmm Muslims seem to look through rose coloured glasses at their caliphates in much the same way colonialists look at their former empires. It was far from all rosey in both cases.
1312172412314607616 2020-10-03 07:27:36 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 Are you talking about the Ottoman Empire or before that?
1312170859176443904 2020-10-03 07:21:26 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 Yeah TBF most Christian monuments that I‚Äôve visited around the world I found at least half of the people on the trips were Muslims, Westerners in general have walked away from faith and this has lead to a lot of the problems, however I see Islam going the same way sadly.
1312169639724556288 2020-10-03 07:16:35 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 Not really true though, hence why some sects are subverted and other are much harder to subvert.
1312168947047784449 2020-10-03 07:13:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 Yeah the latter but TBF my argument is that the churches are so subverted these days that they‚Äôre not worth supporting.
1312168665203187712 2020-10-03 07:12:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @a_leesha1 That‚Äôs literally the point I‚Äôm making thou, it‚Äôs the open racist people like Ash, Yasmin and AOC who seem to go against their public views in their private lives.  https://t.co/VWjtpbqSPU

1312165916004610050 2020-10-03 07:01:47 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Dhanyal56036143 @a_leesha1 It‚Äôs not just religion though is it? Obviously the Quran is very much against racism but Muslims in general are some of the most ethnocentric people around, Pakistanis with Pakistanis, Algerians with Algerians etc.

1312162952380739584 2020-10-03 06:50:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @a_leesha1 Joking aside do you think marrying within your own race and culture is quite important? I have Bengali friends who believe this and I‚Äôm inclined to agree with them, however I believe it‚Äôs a personal choice.

However the term ‚ÄúColour Revoltions‚Äù to describe fake uprising stuck. Other examples Euromaiden, The Arab Spring and The Libyan Revolution.
1308148017854320641 2020-09-22 04:56:06 +0800 <PeakyOswald> This fake revolution is often reported as if the majority of the population are dissatisfied by the existing regime, often this is untrue.   An example of this is the Green Revolution in Iran, most likely engineered by the CIA.
1308146475105484800 2020-09-22 04:49:58 +0800 <PeakyOswald> Totally misleading representation of what people mean when they describe something as a ‚Äúcolour revolution‚Äù  A colour revolution is a non organic revolution, often engineered by an outside influence, often a rival power.

1307658294908116994 2020-09-20 20:30:07 +0800 <PeakyOswald> In hindsight the original lockdown should only have been for the old and vulnerable, the general population needs to catch it, especially healthy children and young adults.   The original lockdown has just been a delaying procedure.  Also the borders should have stayed closed.

1301987569425678336 2020-09-05 04:56:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @st0pdaban Trump is an accelerationist, I give you that, he‚Äôs going to accelerate the annexation of Palestine and that‚Äôs about it.
1301987065865932803 2020-09-05 04:54:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @tabrizresist1 I think a lot of people get flattered by a bit of attention from e celebs and end up totally disbanding their ethnics, I see it happening a lot, it‚Äôs like they get groomed.
1301986492156391424 2020-09-05 04:52:24 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mcmean_josh Listen I don‚Äôt love the guy, his takes on European politics are literally cancer but on Trump he‚Äôs right.

1301984842276634625 2020-09-05 04:45:50 +0800 <PeakyOswald> TBF I think he does it to spite Trump for selling us out rather than supporting Biden, which I get, traitors should be punished.   Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

1301983982024826880 2020-09-05 04:42:25 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @punishedrhea He only cares about Jews and money. He‚Äôs a total narcissist.

1301982620553809920 2020-09-05 04:37:01 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @punishedrhea Yeah they sort of herd us like this but it‚Äôs toxic, the left hates Trump for all the wrong reasons and the right loves him for the same reasons but in reality he is neither of those things, it‚Äôs depressing.
1301981852102778883 2020-09-05 04:33:57 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mantle0707 Malkin‚Äôs husband is Jewish, your move simp.
1301979091185405952 2020-09-05 04:22:59 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @mantle0707 Voting and believing in a rigged system with two puppets who both will sell you out is the real retardation...... you retard.
1301978310755397636 2020-09-05 04:19:53 +0800 <PeakyOswald> When I see white people who still support Trump or at least class him as the lesser evil I realise as a race we‚Äôre finished, brainwashed and pathetic.
1301969700444872704 2020-09-05 03:45:40 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Pajorhansdottir Go see a prostitute, life is too short.

1301968875488239617 2020-09-05 03:42:23 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Pajorhansdottir Are you female? I confused, who is rejecting you?

1301965480811429888 2020-09-05 03:28:54 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Chakitabelle What did the Co-op originally tweet?
1301964537378283522 2020-09-05 03:25:09 +0800 <PeakyOswald> You could put this song in the chart today and it would fit in perfectly but in reality it‚Äôs 21 years old and mainstream music culture is exactly the same as it was back then.  https://t.co/LcmFxc6iZt
1301963032365592577 2020-09-05 03:19:10 +0800 <PeakyOswald> The problem is culture has stood still or even regressed for at least the past 20 years, from re-runs on tv to the same pop music being played by commercial radio stations.   But father time doesn‚Äôt stand still so people are shocked to see celebs age.
1301961788943208450 2020-09-05 03:14:14 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @Katieraydee Were you in the ‚ÄòAddicted to Love‚Äô video by Robert Palmer?

1300913765555331078 2020-09-02 05:49:46 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @bobbypringle1 @Rachael_Swindon Most Israelis were Eastern European Jews who went from causing the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and following Russian genocide, then the Holodomor in Ukrainian, so it‚Äôs hardly a shock they then committed another genocide against the Palestinians.
1300802018320224259 2020-09-01 22:25:43 +0800 <PeakyOswald> @BigToneSoprano Racist?
