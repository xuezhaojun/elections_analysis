1301254276975558657 2020-09-03 04:22:50 +0800 <nisobel> @anniegirl1138 Even though the poll is questionable as it is by Angus Reid, was online, and does not match other recent polls; your comment is much appreciated. Oh when can “we have nice things”?

1301252279232856067 2020-09-03 04:14:54 +0800 <nisobel> @AlbertaYoda The poll appears to be unreliable. However, it is certainly clear from the response and past record that Mr. O’Toole has no plan to engage women.
1301217307868397569 2020-09-03 01:55:56 +0800 <nisobel> @poli_nerd Interesting but Angus Reid is not that reliable and online polling is very unreliable.

1301184809751007233 2020-09-02 23:46:48 +0800 <nisobel> @RayburnBev @mrsmaris Rather unreliable I suspect as a) Angus Reid is the pollster, b) not in sync with other recent polls, and c) online polls are not considered effective and d) we don’t know who was polled.
