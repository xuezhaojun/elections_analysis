Walking across a road, driving in traffic, etc. And so far, Covid19 has good odds of survival.  You are free to lock down and merely exist but you are not living.

You believe the amount of taxes you pay covers both your equal share of govt expenses PLUS that of your neighbors?  I pay a lot of taxes and even I don't believe it for my self.  If you truly cared you'd write checks directly to those in need. You don't.
