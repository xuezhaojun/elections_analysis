1328808218697605122 2020-11-18 05:12:22 +0800 <jflck> My Gubna!
1328741828565327874 2020-11-18 00:48:33 +0800 <jflck> @ScottAdamsSays Poor pussy.
1328739473048342530 2020-11-18 00:39:11 +0800 <jflck> So stupid.
1328559115577253888 2020-11-17 12:42:31 +0800 <jflck> Now's not the time, you disgusting cricket.
1328558588088946688 2020-11-17 12:40:25 +0800 <jflck> @FoxNews?  Sounds like a dirty rotten commie rag.
1328548492936163330 2020-11-17 12:00:18 +0800 <jflck> And never will be.
1328540101333446656 2020-11-17 11:26:57 +0800 <jflck> @AaronBlake Lipstick on a pig, mofo.
1328535429138829313 2020-11-17 11:08:23 +0800 <jflck> @seanhannity @kayleighmcenany What channel are you on?  Oh, yeah. @FoxNews. No thanks. Murdoch's evil spawn can fuggoff.
1328534169648029702 2020-11-17 11:03:23 +0800 <jflck> Disgusting.
1328522747706830848 2020-11-17 10:18:00 +0800 <jflck> Not tuning into @FoxNews ever again.
1328178543633821699 2020-11-16 11:30:15 +0800 <jflck> Pretty sure @realDonaldTrump didnt invent being nice to the woman you want to bone.
1327433529479852033 2020-11-14 10:09:50 +0800 <jflck> Heartbroken to see so many trail off @realDonaldTrump and accept the fraudulent loss. Heartbroken to see millions of Americans vote for our suicide.   Gut punch.  I'm going fishing.
1327414121923571714 2020-11-14 08:52:43 +0800 <jflck> @gatewaypundit I always hope you're right, and just once I'd like you to be.
1327328737445228544 2020-11-14 03:13:26 +0800 <jflck> @mcuban You may put your billions where you like. Our $25-50 will go to protect our vanishing liberties.
1327315703741943815 2020-11-14 02:21:38 +0800 <jflck> He isnt until either a concession or the electoral college votes.
1327040673569239040 2020-11-13 08:08:46 +0800 <jflck> @mikandynothem Heifer Hill.
1326966104523235328 2020-11-13 03:12:27 +0800 <jflck> Dear God, Patriots, stop doing the, "That's it.  That's the tweet."  It was clever the first 9 million times. No longer.
1326916789314478080 2020-11-12 23:56:30 +0800 <jflck> And Shep Smith.
1326748120626180097 2020-11-12 12:46:16 +0800 <jflck> @BrianClowdus @realDonaldTrump How'd you give up alcohol?
1326703246619140096 2020-11-12 09:47:57 +0800 <jflck> Just downloaded Rumble.
1326698916088307713 2020-11-12 09:30:45 +0800 <jflck> I cant remember her last name.
1326693278016811012 2020-11-12 09:08:20 +0800 <jflck> Dumbest tweet of the day.
1326692387083722754 2020-11-12 09:04:48 +0800 <jflck> @TdLombard @GaderJef
1326690487592480768 2020-11-12 08:57:15 +0800 <jflck> Won't work.
1326687189321871365 2020-11-12 08:44:09 +0800 <jflck> I was put in Twitter jail for telling the few good fox news personalities to leave that harlot before they get ruined. I didnt say harlot, but a word that rhymes with bore, yore, and nor.
1326684102905499651 2020-11-12 08:31:53 +0800 <jflck> Not watching @foxnews, Tucker.
1326354424613249024 2020-11-11 10:41:51 +0800 <jflck> I wouldn't know, because I will never again watch @FoxNews
1326331975209283584 2020-11-11 09:12:39 +0800 <jflck> We must destroy FB, Twitter, Google, etc. Smash them to atoms.
1326331489542344704 2020-11-11 09:10:43 +0800 <jflck> I'm growing tired.  This is what they want. I will not give in. I will not comply. I will not abide. No matter how tired I am.
1326327044465172480 2020-11-11 08:53:04 +0800 <jflck> It's really in God's hands. I believe if we arent successful, something bigger is here.   Nothing could be bigger than @realDonaldTrump, accept the endtimes. In this case, Trump wouldn't only be the last, best president of the USA, but actively used in endtime prophesy. #Yuge
1326326081591402498 2020-11-11 08:49:14 +0800 <jflck> Yes.
1326325418274787330 2020-11-11 08:46:36 +0800 <jflck> Mitch, you turkey waddle mofo, we love you.
1326325042049916929 2020-11-11 08:45:06 +0800 <jflck> Love Cruz!
1326324717066870786 2020-11-11 08:43:49 +0800 <jflck> As we approach the potential end of America, I cant describe how much I loathe CJ John Roberts.
1326324273204572160 2020-11-11 08:42:03 +0800 <jflck> We need Alito, Thomas, Kavanaugh, and ACB!    Roberts can suck a fat one.
1326320618590056453 2020-11-11 08:27:31 +0800 <jflck> @ACTBrigitte Do hippy chicks have chewbacca in their panties?
1326319242791280643 2020-11-11 08:22:03 +0800 <jflck> Look at the bright side @SpeakerPelosi, now you can go 5 bloody marys at breakfast.
1326318678305026048 2020-11-11 08:19:49 +0800 <jflck> Pollsters have as much credibility as voodoo witchdoctors after aspirin.
1326318287018483713 2020-11-11 08:18:16 +0800 <jflck> Like Victoria Secrets hiring a nun to design panties.
1326317764869500928 2020-11-11 08:16:11 +0800 <jflck> No one is prez-elect until the EC votes. Piss off.
1326317307560333312 2020-11-11 08:14:22 +0800 <jflck> Doesn't matter. It just sets up an appeal.  This is going to SCOTUS.
1326314488853884930 2020-11-11 08:03:10 +0800 <jflck> Best tweet of the night.
1326314368141828096 2020-11-11 08:02:41 +0800 <jflck> Get em, Burgess!
1326313618238025729 2020-11-11 07:59:42 +0800 <jflck> Yeah, nah.
1326313381830287367 2020-11-11 07:58:46 +0800 <jflck> They should swing above the SCOTUS steps.
1326312978212401152 2020-11-11 07:57:10 +0800 <jflck> Bless you Sekulow!  #Warrior
1326312144934199297 2020-11-11 07:53:51 +0800 <jflck> That's ridiculous.
1326311248351408129 2020-11-11 07:50:17 +0800 <jflck> That's insane, crazy, nuts, and deranged.

1326279197644500993 2020-11-11 05:42:56 +0800 <jflck> Worst Speaker ever.
1326274947078103041 2020-11-11 05:26:03 +0800 <jflck> Recount every vote by hand. No sampling.
1326263038710865920 2020-11-11 04:38:43 +0800 <jflck> @derf_anon @aegeanphoenix17 Puff, puff, pass, bro. I'd love it, but ain't happening.
1326261495316049921 2020-11-11 04:32:35 +0800 <jflck> Did you not read a paper, watch tv, or listen to the radio this year?  You took your civic duty so seriously that you completely missed it?  I'm ashamed that you are American.
1326256592128499713 2020-11-11 04:13:06 +0800 <jflck> Oh, @JebBush, I forgot you were there. You may go now.
1326206970659999744 2020-11-11 00:55:56 +0800 <jflck> Americans told you to STFU a long time ago. Dont make us say it twice.
1326175799188262915 2020-11-10 22:52:04 +0800 <jflck> Mary, Mary, why ya buggin?
1326161317980467202 2020-11-10 21:54:31 +0800 <jflck> Come break us.
1326160883886804995 2020-11-10 21:52:48 +0800 <jflck> In my next life I'm going to be Mr @IvankaTrump.
1326160702340554752 2020-11-10 21:52:04 +0800 <jflck> @EricTrump Fight like hell, brother!

1326160426032369665 2020-11-10 21:50:59 +0800 <jflck> @FoxNews?  Never heard of her.
1326156863726084097 2020-11-10 21:36:49 +0800 <jflck> American patriots will say when it's over. Just like last time.
1326154601448484864 2020-11-10 21:27:50 +0800 <jflck> Dunno what flop sweat is exactly, but hope it's as disgusting as it sounds.
1326150565789896705 2020-11-10 21:11:48 +0800 <jflck> 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Fight, damnit! Fight!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1326149967703121920 2020-11-10 21:09:25 +0800 <jflck> With God's help, @realDonaldTrump is about to open a can of American whoopass! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1326139598230188034 2020-11-10 20:28:13 +0800 <jflck> Who slept their way to the top better, Kamala or Joe? #MAGA2020
1326138643434659841 2020-11-10 20:24:25 +0800 <jflck> #foxit
1326024326580219905 2020-11-10 12:50:10 +0800 <jflck> He never was.
1326023023502168065 2020-11-10 12:44:59 +0800 <jflck> Cuck, get out!  And wipe that shit off your chin.
1326020621944434689 2020-11-10 12:35:27 +0800 <jflck> Because no president in modern times ever suffered such daily abuse and fraud by the dems--and you.
1326019781267435525 2020-11-10 12:32:06 +0800 <jflck> Then why did RCP rescind Biden's win in PN, and why did CNN rescind Biden's win in AZ?
1326019283634315269 2020-11-10 12:30:08 +0800 <jflck> Grinnell, for 1000, dead Alex.
1325962572122779650 2020-11-10 08:44:47 +0800 <jflck> God, you're nauseating.

1325953475310661632 2020-11-10 08:08:38 +0800 <jflck> But with those buck teeth I bet she can really whistle a tune.
1325953047206391809 2020-11-10 08:06:56 +0800 <jflck> Especially not the paw of a flatulent cat.

1324175882634862592 2020-11-05 10:25:07 +0800 <jflck> @DonaldJTrumpJr Please give us some good news!

1323851068434976768 2020-11-04 12:54:25 +0800 <jflck> Nobody gives a fuck, Brett. You're done.
1323846820913684480 2020-11-04 12:37:32 +0800 <jflck> Mark Shields on PBS looks like he has a ball sack under his chin.
1323840966340579329 2020-11-04 12:14:16 +0800 <jflck> You're a joke.
1323836013240819713 2020-11-04 11:54:35 +0800 <jflck> PBS saying Camp Joe feeling optimistic. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1323826978068320257 2020-11-04 11:18:41 +0800 <jflck> I switched to MSNBC to watch them cry.

1323805266513694720 2020-11-04 09:52:25 +0800 <jflck> Open Letter to @TuckerCarlson and @seanhannity:  Leave @FoxNews.  You have the coin to start a new media company or join, as rockstars, #OANN.   Eventually, we will refuse to give support to FNC even to support you.   Be Patriots!  Leave FNC.
1323803761035366408 2020-11-04 09:46:26 +0800 <jflck> To Biden, the presidency is like approaching the speed of light. The closer he got, the heavier he became. #NotGonnaHappen @greggutfeld @DonaldJTrumpJr
1323801445427273729 2020-11-04 09:37:14 +0800 <jflck> Girl, with the exception for 2 shoes, your audience no longer watches that shit.

1323797405322674181 2020-11-04 09:21:11 +0800 <jflck> Haven't seen someone owned like this since Republicans freed the slaves.
1323794150425243648 2020-11-04 09:08:15 +0800 <jflck> That's your explanation? Not a surge of Trump support in Miami Dade?
1323793852554047488 2020-11-04 09:07:04 +0800 <jflck> @CalebJHull Also, the sky is blue and men like titts.
1323793691652378625 2020-11-04 09:06:25 +0800 <jflck> Atta fuggin girl!
1323791715292110849 2020-11-04 08:58:34 +0800 <jflck> Sweet Baby Jesus, @realDonaldTrump is gonna do it again! #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
1323790438160093184 2020-11-04 08:53:29 +0800 <jflck> @HeatherNauert @newsmax @realDonaldTrump In my next life I'm going to be Mr Heather Nauert. 😁
1323789990434906112 2020-11-04 08:51:43 +0800 <jflck> @GregRubini @Welles19 I hope so. But my gut reaction is "Puff puff, pass, bruh."
1323787289659625473 2020-11-04 08:40:59 +0800 <jflck> This fascist rag needs a mercy flush.
1323786113698451456 2020-11-04 08:36:18 +0800 <jflck> Also, Hillary won Dade County 2-1. Trump is ahead of that by over 10 points.

1323730412783439874 2020-11-04 04:54:58 +0800 <jflck> Time to get rid of WashPo.
1323725178141102081 2020-11-04 04:34:10 +0800 <jflck> After today @NateSilver538 will be downgraded to Nate Bronze.
1323724704121835524 2020-11-04 04:32:17 +0800 <jflck> This tweet will age like MC Hammer pants.
1323704779286216704 2020-11-04 03:13:07 +0800 <jflck> The freak out is starting in earnest.

1323666077214277632 2020-11-04 00:39:19 +0800 <jflck> You'll be waiting 4 more years.
1323646401696407556 2020-11-03 23:21:08 +0800 <jflck> That's the best you got?
1323645910216253442 2020-11-03 23:19:11 +0800 <jflck> You are corrupt. But we will win anyway.
1323641081024651271 2020-11-03 23:00:00 +0800 <jflck> Because the Left is nothing but a violent mob anymore.
1323636442359386113 2020-11-03 22:41:34 +0800 <jflck> @LarrySchweikart City or county?
1323601602582896640 2020-11-03 20:23:08 +0800 <jflck> Bring it home, Amish!
1323599731541630976 2020-11-03 20:15:41 +0800 <jflck> It's in God's hands now.
1323457450390020096 2020-11-03 10:50:19 +0800 <jflck> Cry, bitches.
1323455388390490113 2020-11-03 10:42:07 +0800 <jflck> God bless @realDonaldTrump tomorrow. No man has endured more lies, insults, and coordinated attacks as our president, while still producing so many wins for the American people. GOD BLESS YOU, SIR!
1323393048739459072 2020-11-03 06:34:24 +0800 <jflck> @TheB_sKnees @ScottAdamsSays Funnier still, I learned this while on the job studiously avoiding work.
1323388964049440769 2020-11-03 06:18:11 +0800 <jflck> Just realized the @ScottAdamsSays dude I follow on twitter is the Dilbert guy.  30 years ago my poli sci prof shared a Dilbert piece each week. Great stuff.
1323310603935600642 2020-11-03 01:06:48 +0800 <jflck> Completely irresponsible of you to tweet this.
1322993323251040257 2020-11-02 04:06:02 +0800 <jflck> Tool.
1322992578262978560 2020-11-02 04:03:05 +0800 <jflck> Ridiculous.
1322701820314165250 2020-11-01 08:47:43 +0800 <jflck> @TimRunsHisMouth Jai Alai IPA.
1322701032808329216 2020-11-01 08:44:35 +0800 <jflck> We're with you, Randy!
1322256455588864001 2020-10-31 03:18:00 +0800 <jflck> Me, too.
1322256355579858944 2020-10-31 03:17:36 +0800 <jflck> @MrAndyNgo @realDonaldTrump Not to conflate the two, but similarly in Ocala, FL, two days ago I saw a huge electronic billboard that read, "Taiwanese For Trump 2020." The Asian community is flipping, like blacks and Latinos.
1322252637346123777 2020-10-31 03:02:49 +0800 <jflck> @realDonaldTrump has created the best economy in the world, created historic peace deals, and launched this badass betty out of his nutsack. Is there anything he cant make great?
1322250604975132674 2020-10-31 02:54:45 +0800 <jflck> Sonofabitch, @realDonaldTrump is going to do it again!  God bless him!
1322249065820770304 2020-10-31 02:48:38 +0800 <jflck> We will not abide.  You are a disgrace to the brave men and women who haven't taken shit from anybody in 300 years.
1322247314770198534 2020-10-31 02:41:40 +0800 <jflck> I've never believed in Holy Water, but when @realDonaldTrump wins again, the tears he will extract from mental virgins might might make me rethink this issue.

1321677194079424513 2020-10-29 12:56:13 +0800 <jflck> I dont consider being loved by Joe as lucky. Ick.
1321675414310445057 2020-10-29 12:49:08 +0800 <jflck> Harry Styles?  Sounds like he shaves men's balls.

1321673742641172480 2020-10-29 12:42:30 +0800 <jflck> @TimRunsHisMouth Never heard of her.

1321671941783248896 2020-10-29 12:35:21 +0800 <jflck> @stillgray @Surfingcity Actually, vengeance is the Lord's.
1321671689479036928 2020-10-29 12:34:20 +0800 <jflck> Unhappy that the people no longer need the media to learn the truth, eh?  Fuggoff.

1321669579240779777 2020-10-29 12:25:57 +0800 <jflck> @AdamJSmithGA And they need a man to protect them, poor dears.
1321669412223668225 2020-10-29 12:25:17 +0800 <jflck> @AdamJSmithGA Are they supposed to look tough or ridiculous?
1321668374347321345 2020-10-29 12:21:10 +0800 <jflck> @WeAreTheMillies @ironwilson703 I watch youtube videos of Hillary supporters crying on election night.  Then I can go to bed happy.
1321664178470486016 2020-10-29 12:04:30 +0800 <jflck> Dumbest shit I've heard today. Girls would rather join the Pedo Boys Club than to be around your nonsense.
1321662711764320280 2020-10-29 11:58:40 +0800 <jflck> @LarrySchweikart In very liberal Gainesville today I drove by a voting place and saw a black man waving a @realDonaldTrump flag. Later today I saw a "Taiwanese For Trump" billboard in Ocala.
1321659564329209859 2020-10-29 11:46:10 +0800 <jflck> @KurtSchlichter That's some two-for-one fuggin savagery right there, Kurt. Well done!
1321646509264412684 2020-10-29 10:54:17 +0800 <jflck> Disgrace.
1321645573292904449 2020-10-29 10:50:34 +0800 <jflck> Why, @JonahDispatch, I forgot you were there. You may go now.
1321643961153454083 2020-10-29 10:44:09 +0800 <jflck> @KennedyNation Despicable. WTF were you thinking? You've always been annoying. But this?  Clean out your desk.
1321639808276508673 2020-10-29 10:27:39 +0800 <jflck> He wasnt murdered, you demented pos.
1321627526800826370 2020-10-29 09:38:51 +0800 <jflck> How many powerful, old men got your back to get you where you don't belong?
1321616769031852037 2020-10-29 08:56:06 +0800 <jflck> Stop being lying douche.  There.  I fixed it.
1321616338788470784 2020-10-29 08:54:24 +0800 <jflck> @JackPosobiec Wasnt me.
1321615831147683840 2020-10-29 08:52:23 +0800 <jflck> Today, in Ocala, Florida, I saw a huge electronic billboard that read, "Taiwanese For Trump 2020."  1st thought: Hurray! 2nd thought: Taiwanese for Trump.  Is that a thing?    @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @catturd2

1321260425602830345 2020-10-28 09:20:07 +0800 <jflck> The most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
1321241085549662216 2020-10-28 08:03:16 +0800 <jflck> Iowa and Arizona go for Trump, too.
1320965816825896960 2020-10-27 13:49:27 +0800 <jflck> @senatemajldr You've cemented your legacy, and it benefits us all.   Thank you.
1320962108079689728 2020-10-27 13:34:43 +0800 <jflck> Patriots:  We didnt need her vote, but we might truly need her to be reelected.   The choice is a moderate R or a flaming L.  Her vote was unnecessary.   Think chess, not checkers.   @SenatorCollins
1320937444280328192 2020-10-27 11:56:43 +0800 <jflck> What a pussy. Reza, grow up.
1320937050795921408 2020-10-27 11:55:09 +0800 <jflck> He's pushed through a complete remake of the judiciary. WTF?  https://t.co/PDIyCNotwh
1320912289550213120 2020-10-27 10:16:45 +0800 <jflck> @rezaaslan Not only did e confirm ACB, @realDonaldTrump will be reelected in 8 days.
1320576088700080128 2020-10-26 12:00:49 +0800 <jflck> @jbrin40126 @JesseKellyDC @SarcasticCupcak Settle down, Beavis.
1320115665106292736 2020-10-25 05:31:15 +0800 <jflck> @DarshunKendrick Damn, you're dumb. And that makes your voters even dumber. Jesus, give me strength.
1320099242543878144 2020-10-25 04:26:00 +0800 <jflck> This is the dumbest tweet I've ever read.
1320095844188803072 2020-10-25 04:12:30 +0800 <jflck> Openly advocating election fraud. Shameful.
1320041522134474756 2020-10-25 00:36:38 +0800 <jflck> Trump yeah!
1320040455418073088 2020-10-25 00:32:24 +0800 <jflck> Racist through and through. These white elitists have no self awareness at all.
1320034997668032517 2020-10-25 00:10:43 +0800 <jflck> Good.
1320012996949794816 2020-10-24 22:43:17 +0800 <jflck> Planes recycle the air faster than surgery rooms. Virtually no danger.
1319694156592197634 2020-10-24 01:36:20 +0800 <jflck> Whatever, toots.
1319492235117973506 2020-10-23 12:13:58 +0800 <jflck> Trump destroys Biden tonight.   Dont care about the spin.
1319457683368529922 2020-10-23 09:56:40 +0800 <jflck> And heels. For Kamala, her own. For the Bidens,  a 14 yo niece or some Chinese minor.
1319456137968816130 2020-10-23 09:50:32 +0800 <jflck> OMG I'm a straight, white, American male, and I want to kiss @realDonaldTrump on the mouth.   I wouldn't, but I'm happy as a pig in shit that this man is my president.
1319455051547508737 2020-10-23 09:46:13 +0800 <jflck> Two people I hope I meet in my life, Rudy and Spurrier.   Fuggoff haters. Thems my two.
1319454529876840448 2020-10-23 09:44:08 +0800 <jflck> After today, I think Kamsla's heels will be up again. She ain't going nowhere with Joe, which means heels up!
1319452785704882178 2020-10-23 09:37:13 +0800 <jflck> The man, the myth, the legend.  The unflappable patriot. I hope you're the Sec of State next term.
1319452419235991553 2020-10-23 09:35:45 +0800 <jflck> @RandyRRQuaid Man, you're good shit, Randy. As an American,  I thank you for your sacrifice being as vocal as you are.
1319427559831064577 2020-10-23 07:56:58 +0800 <jflck> @brianstelter is a menace to society, a disgrace to his profession,  and lying sack of shit to his country.
1319396616269369350 2020-10-23 05:54:01 +0800 <jflck> So glad you're on top of important stuff.
1319366810756698122 2020-10-23 03:55:34 +0800 <jflck> You know that is a lie.
1319343258154225665 2020-10-23 02:21:59 +0800 <jflck> Hell yes!
1319342291526582276 2020-10-23 02:18:09 +0800 <jflck> @60Minutes Disgraceful behavior.
1319341843612635139 2020-10-23 02:16:22 +0800 <jflck> Finally we have an American president that doesn't cowtow to liberal journalists, nor allow them to control the narrative through deceit.
1319340253719777290 2020-10-23 02:10:03 +0800 <jflck> Yeah, no.  You want to hurt @realDonaldTrump and help Biden. Your federal aid should be discontinued immediately until you stop acting like Democratic operatives.
1318870803681783809 2020-10-21 19:04:37 +0800 <jflck> I'll read it after the prison doors lock behind you.
1318341193009385473 2020-10-20 08:00:08 +0800 <jflck> Never hear of you. Dont care.
1318339814568169474 2020-10-20 07:54:40 +0800 <jflck> Common.  A man jerking off isn't news.
1318337836484075520 2020-10-20 07:46:48 +0800 <jflck> Nothing fascist about this.
1318330750115209216 2020-10-20 07:18:38 +0800 <jflck> Let this lie. It's disgusting to celebrate this man's humiliation, or his family's.
1318329707264442373 2020-10-20 07:14:30 +0800 <jflck> Fuggoff,  both of you.
1318329469715861515 2020-10-20 07:13:33 +0800 <jflck> You're right, @TroyAikman, but not because Joe or Kamala would spend money better. There wouldn't be any because they hate America, hate our military, and wouldn't promote patriotism for any reason, ever.  Tuning you out permanently.
1318328368308301824 2020-10-20 07:09:11 +0800 <jflck> Crossed a line, Steve. No one cares about your racist politics.
1318328183922610176 2020-10-20 07:08:27 +0800 <jflck> @IAmSteveHarvey Used to love you.  Never cared about your politics. But now that you've put them in my face I won't watch or listen to you again.  #MAGA2020LandslideVictory
1318327718031884289 2020-10-20 07:06:35 +0800 <jflck> Then release them.  Jesus, what are you waiting for?
1318325743127056384 2020-10-20 06:58:45 +0800 <jflck> @JeffreyToobin Coulda happened to anyone.   I hate everything you stand for, but for anyone to celebrate this misadventure is grotesque.  May you and your family weather this storm, and heal.   Oh, and #MAGA2020
1318324947425595394 2020-10-20 06:55:35 +0800 <jflck> There, but by the grace of God, go I.   I can disagree with the mofo, but celebrating his humiliation, and that of his family, I cant support.
1318072364043767808 2020-10-19 14:11:54 +0800 <jflck> "May have." Way to report conjecture.

1317197828851204096 2020-10-17 04:16:49 +0800 <jflck> @RealOmarNavarro I think @SenatorRomney should go rule his own planet and leave this one to @realDonaldTrump.
1317197608557907979 2020-10-17 04:15:56 +0800 <jflck> I think @MittRomney should go rule his own planet and leave the real one to us.

1316999982973636608 2020-10-16 15:10:39 +0800 <jflck> This tweet aged as well as Biden.
1316969298485760003 2020-10-16 13:08:43 +0800 <jflck> You're really bad at this. Cry uncle already and move on.
1316966985247432705 2020-10-16 12:59:32 +0800 <jflck> Who hurt you?

1316491024332738566 2020-10-15 05:28:14 +0800 <jflck> @icecube Common, man, you know @realDonaldTrump has done more for the black community in 42 months than Ds in 42 years. You're all about keeping it real. This is real.
1316490535536922624 2020-10-15 05:26:17 +0800 <jflck> As opposed to all the others,  this Kennedy is an American treasure.

1316489340860669953 2020-10-15 05:21:32 +0800 <jflck> @realDonaldTrump is alreasy defeating the Obamas,  Clintons, Bushes, the press, the intelligence traitors, Twitter, FB, all big tech, the universities, and now even Webster Dictionary. #NotTiredOfWinning #MAGA2020
1316467325563002881 2020-10-15 03:54:03 +0800 <jflck> You are a direct threat to our democracy. In the first 100 days of @realDonaldTrump's 2nd term we will #RepealSection230 &amp; smash FB &amp; Twitter to atoms.

1316454351628652546 2020-10-15 03:02:30 +0800 <jflck> @jack you are a direct threat to democracy.  Shameful.
1316450472132325381 2020-10-15 02:47:05 +0800 <jflck> @BlueBloods_CBS wins the coveted award for tv drama with the most unnecessary employment of the word "forthwith."
1316267519875915776 2020-10-14 14:40:06 +0800 <jflck> Kamala is used to low rent. At least until Willie Brown intervened.
1316226886045962240 2020-10-14 11:58:38 +0800 <jflck> Correct, you dumb bastard.
1316226034736529408 2020-10-14 11:55:15 +0800 <jflck> Yeah. Plus, ACB is hot.
1316225764526895105 2020-10-14 11:54:11 +0800 <jflck> ACB wrecked @SenBlumenthal so hard if he'd have known this was coming he'd have run headlong into the North Vietnamese years ago.
1316225188581781504 2020-10-14 11:51:53 +0800 <jflck> Wait, did @amyklobuchar really say she once thought she'd be nominated to SCOTUS?  🤣🤣🤣 So she thought she'd be president &amp; thought she'd be on SCOTUS. I have no idea how she's in the Senate, much less SCOTUS or the WH.
1316220591482040320 2020-10-14 11:33:37 +0800 <jflck> Reminds me of the VP debate.
1316220029088784384 2020-10-14 11:31:23 +0800 <jflck> Sue the Left out of them.
1316183345433317376 2020-10-14 09:05:37 +0800 <jflck> Just when I think @maziehirono is comatose, she says something incredibly stupid.
1316182613212758016 2020-10-14 09:02:43 +0800 <jflck> Just "Cry Uncle," Klobuchar.  You're beclowning yourself.
1316180014891700225 2020-10-14 08:52:23 +0800 <jflck> @TwoAForever Her correct sentiments aside, if your 7 year old uses that language,  you have some serious work to do.
1316169341910626305 2020-10-14 08:09:59 +0800 <jflck> @KamalaHarris is proof you can f*ck your way well above your talent.
1316163090296246272 2020-10-14 07:45:08 +0800 <jflck> It's not coming.
1316158194503344129 2020-10-14 07:25:41 +0800 <jflck> If I were from Hawaii I'd hang my head in shame.
1316157849718919175 2020-10-14 07:24:19 +0800 <jflck> Uncharacteristically?
1316156874170028032 2020-10-14 07:20:26 +0800 <jflck> @maziehirono has a JD from Georgetown. Good heavens, Georgetown. That's as bad as Boston U conferring an economics degree on @AOC.
1316154449933537284 2020-10-14 07:10:48 +0800 <jflck> @TulsiGabbard We dont agree on everything,  but please challenge @maziehirono next time around. Hawaii deserves much more than a Senator who escaped off the @RepMaxineWaters crazy train.
1316153963453054976 2020-10-14 07:08:52 +0800 <jflck> @maziehirono is not just batshit crazy. She is straight up @RepMaxineWaters stupid. My lord, if I were a Hawaiian I'd be embarrassed to my core.
1316145920883535873 2020-10-14 06:36:55 +0800 <jflck> "Sounds like" should be shortened to "is."
1316145676091305984 2020-10-14 06:35:56 +0800 <jflck> @RandyRRQuaid I really hope you can find work after being so vocal.  Your sacrifice is humbling to watch and very much appreciated!
1316128867762032642 2020-10-14 05:29:09 +0800 <jflck> @CoachDanMullen Yoyre the best thing to happen to Gator football in ages. Dont let the bastards get you down.
1315828926653124608 2020-10-13 09:37:17 +0800 <jflck> Nobody takes you seriously.
1315828345704189952 2020-10-13 09:34:59 +0800 <jflck> You're the extremist. We're regular folk finally fighting back against you and your kind.
1315815725697769472 2020-10-13 08:44:50 +0800 <jflck> He was nominated for next year, jackwagon.
1315814844428320770 2020-10-13 08:41:20 +0800 <jflck> Biden's handlers should sit him at a desk and tell him it's the Oval Office. He'll be thrilled.
1315814269091557376 2020-10-13 08:39:03 +0800 <jflck> Yup.
1315808976416768002 2020-10-13 08:18:01 +0800 <jflck> Remember when he thought he could be president?  🤣🤣🤣
1315783133334249472 2020-10-13 06:35:19 +0800 <jflck> She cant have it both ways. SorryNotSorry
1315777902227738624 2020-10-13 06:14:32 +0800 <jflck> ACB has already recused herself from giving one f*ck about your opinion.
1315731877421031431 2020-10-13 03:11:39 +0800 <jflck> Um, you're the one who is done and gone. In @realDonaldTrump's 2nd term, there's a helluva lot of roles for him to play. You, not so much.
1315731514747949056 2020-10-13 03:10:12 +0800 <jflck> Just me, or is Rachael Ray starting to look a lot like Roseanne?
1315729341741969408 2020-10-13 03:01:34 +0800 <jflck> He's on our side most of the time.
1315728941278261250 2020-10-13 02:59:59 +0800 <jflck> If they're patriots, I'd consider it. Just not you. Or the lib cow behind you.
1315727181507592194 2020-10-13 02:52:59 +0800 <jflck> Yeah, baby.
1315725763757453313 2020-10-13 02:47:21 +0800 <jflck> Um, no. She's an accomplished woman of faith. But you're right. You cant stop her.
1315724821821632512 2020-10-13 02:43:37 +0800 <jflck> Chris Christie eats 327 whole chickens for breakfast and he beat covid in under a week. Open the economy.
1315722088548913161 2020-10-13 02:32:45 +0800 <jflck> We need John James.
1315719458137276417 2020-10-13 02:22:18 +0800 <jflck> Damn, Guy. I thought it was illegal for you to own a person in 2020!
1315718384764497920 2020-10-13 02:18:02 +0800 <jflck> He won Florida. He won the EC. SCOTUS didnt put him in.
1315715884678295554 2020-10-13 02:08:06 +0800 <jflck> When I see @staceyabrams pleading on tv I cant help but think she's whistling past the graveyard. And with those buck teeth, I bet she can really fuggin whistle. @greggutfeld #MAGA #MAGA2020
1315714495604551680 2020-10-13 02:02:35 +0800 <jflck> @amyklobuchar It is our country, and we voted for @realDonaldTrump.  When he nominated ACB, he did so on OUR behalf.
1315712791001600004 2020-10-13 01:55:48 +0800 <jflck> @RealOmarNavarro To what end?
1315711337666940930 2020-10-13 01:50:02 +0800 <jflck> Sweet.
1315710902927273986 2020-10-13 01:48:18 +0800 <jflck> Chris Christie just proved you can eat 327 whole chickens for breakfast everyday and still beat covid in a week. Open the economy.

1315699741364293633 2020-10-13 01:03:57 +0800 <jflck> This idiot thinks we care about his insane opinions.
1315696257684451328 2020-10-13 00:50:06 +0800 <jflck> You are destroying the marketplace of ideas, and therefore destroying representational government. Terrible.
1315550406064459776 2020-10-12 15:10:33 +0800 <jflck> Disgraceful.

1314752315388239872 2020-10-10 10:19:13 +0800 <jflck> You're protecting your opinion. That's all. You fuggin fascists.

1313279475921170432 2020-10-06 08:46:41 +0800 <jflck> @JRubinBlogger you have lost your mind.  And you look 30 years past your picture. You should update it to reflect the tired, old has been you've become.
1313225746576551937 2020-10-06 05:13:11 +0800 <jflck> Does the bitch nut grow on trees?
1313148619822960641 2020-10-06 00:06:42 +0800 <jflck> Disgraceful. One day your vacuous cancel culture will boomerang back at you.

1312189619224498177 2020-10-03 08:35:59 +0800 <jflck> What a disgusting article.  This is why good people will reelect @realDonaldTrump.
1312189258040397825 2020-10-03 08:34:33 +0800 <jflck> You're a disgusting hack.
1311827245519040513 2020-10-02 08:36:02 +0800 <jflck> No, David. He's fighting harder than all of the cucks like you who'vewayched as America got screwed. You allowed the Left to take over every institution in America.  In the 18th century you'd have been a loyalist. It took, takes, balls to fight for liberty.
1311824569263706114 2020-10-02 08:25:24 +0800 <jflck> @johnrobertsFox Fuggoff.  And the same to all but a few at @FoxNews.  You're nothing but a Disney channel now.
1311664386700914688 2020-10-01 21:48:53 +0800 <jflck> Too bad de Blasio is term limited. I'd love to see him thrown out of office.
1311661055660232704 2020-10-01 21:35:39 +0800 <jflck> True,but in bad taste, Mark.  You could've skipped this tweet and been a better man for it.
1311659290265112576 2020-10-01 21:28:38 +0800 <jflck> Not tired of winning.
1311647242483310592 2020-10-01 20:40:46 +0800 <jflck> @TrekSegafredo Suspending a rider for merely declaring support for the president is despicable.
1311647049742520320 2020-10-01 20:40:00 +0800 <jflck> @TrekSegafredo suspending a rider for merely supporting @realDonaldTrump is despicable,  and a direct threat to representational government.   Only one side behaves like fascists, and it's not conservatives.
1311500182006235137 2020-10-01 10:56:24 +0800 <jflck> Blow him.
1311499723908550656 2020-10-01 10:54:35 +0800 <jflck> @irishspy "...levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."  Failing to prosecute one candidate while attempting coup against the other who won can be understood as levying war against the president,  and therefore the country that elected him.
1311497158097604610 2020-10-01 10:44:23 +0800 <jflck> Actively trying to subvert a legitimate election to overthrow the government is treasonous. Suck a fat one.
1311493237459296257 2020-10-01 10:28:48 +0800 <jflck> You will lose this historic election and fade to irrelevance before your panties are pulled up.
1311492239026257927 2020-10-01 10:24:50 +0800 <jflck> Backdoor f@ckholes.
1311484470244061184 2020-10-01 09:53:58 +0800 <jflck> You are truly the most corrupt and vile human I've ever heard of. No one believes you; no one wanted you to be president,  not even those who voted against Trump in 16. Your lack of self awareness is staggering.
1311311412069892099 2020-09-30 22:26:18 +0800 <jflck> His bias was appalling.
1311139034962501632 2020-09-30 11:01:20 +0800 <jflck> I will never watch @FoxNews again as long as Chris Wallace is employed there.
1311138240389357568 2020-09-30 10:58:10 +0800 <jflck> Leaning toward Biden with his mouth open.
1311136432954712068 2020-09-30 10:51:00 +0800 <jflck> Both did enough to satisfy their bases. Trump left the most meat on the bone. I could've coached him better.
1311129038208016384 2020-09-30 10:21:36 +0800 <jflck> You're an idiot. Wallace is running interference for Biden.
1311127955532320773 2020-09-30 10:17:18 +0800 <jflck> @realDonaldTrump has done well,but he left a lot of meat on the bone.

1310379077434519555 2020-09-28 08:41:32 +0800 <jflck> The President appoints. The Senate gives or denies confirmation.   That's how this works.

1309705116329684992 2020-09-26 12:03:27 +0800 <jflck> The spectacle that ensued when @realDonaldTrump won last time--the tears, screaming, vitriol--was amazing. Now, after 4 years of bs, impeachment, etc, THIS time will be even sweeter.
1309702525218631680 2020-09-26 11:53:09 +0800 <jflck> Mobs or jobs?
1309699090968645632 2020-09-26 11:39:30 +0800 <jflck> Like, why did I attempt a coup on POTUS?  Why did I jeopardize my career, liberty, and reputation by committing treason? Why did I disgrace my family?  What if I actually drop the soap in prison?    So many questions.
1309695236726296583 2020-09-26 11:24:12 +0800 <jflck> Bitch,you lied about Americans being killed. Go away.
