1343774541647003650 2020-12-29 12:23:11 +0800 <LordYupa2> @CattHarmony Nice Room! Vegas!   That where we always stayed until my wife hated Trump...now that she loves him we will be staying there on our next trip.  Enjoy!
1343732656463233024 2020-12-29 09:36:45 +0800 <LordYupa2> @McKaylaRoseJ @audreyy_kaye A house is not always a smart investment when all costs are taken into account.  Renting is not throwing your money away.
1343572221151727622 2020-12-28 22:59:14 +0800 <LordYupa2> @carolinasassie @StappElizabeth Exactly.  How many times have I accidentally called my wife a guys name. Zero!!!
1343416333384310784 2020-12-28 12:39:48 +0800 <LordYupa2> @elenochle Thank you for your work!!!  Pivotal moment in world history.
1343327899194048512 2020-12-28 06:48:23 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KillAuDeepState @Mike_Pence Also keep in mind that Pence has access to proof we do not have.   There should be absolutely no question in his mind that fraud occurred.  No doubt.
1343079637199409152 2020-12-27 14:21:53 +0800 <LordYupa2> @tina_marie41 @WizAmyGreen I saw that. Also in the front photo one has an extra light above the name near the top.
1342510354786471936 2020-12-26 00:39:45 +0800 <LordYupa2> @txaeronaut Super weird response
1342451298545750018 2020-12-25 20:45:05 +0800 <LordYupa2> @VincentCrypt46 .
1342329843426369542 2020-12-25 12:42:28 +0800 <LordYupa2> @CassandraRules Assad is one of the more moderate leaders in the Middle East.   Should be an ally. Also we should help rebuild Syria so refugees can return.
1342116757788524546 2020-12-24 22:35:45 +0800 <LordYupa2> @RealChrisLangan It is strange that extreme liberals have a look....if you are unattractive are you drawn to leftist ideology?   Or do unattractive people have some sort of mental deficit that you can ‚Äúsee‚Äù?
1342116094266372097 2020-12-24 22:33:06 +0800 <LordYupa2> @RealChrisLangan @realDonaldTrump I am hoping the same.  He had a lot of time to prepare and brilliant minds at his disposal.  I think they have it all.  Just waiting for the right time.
1342091709216292868 2020-12-24 20:56:12 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ronnieverruto @LPaingood I believe this.  Trump knew this was rigged since at least 2012 or before.  Only intervention by white hats in 2016 gave Trump the win.   They knew they were going to cheat in 2018 and they did.  They had so much time to prepare and plan for this.
1341543538123702272 2020-12-23 08:37:58 +0800 <LordYupa2> @AntonioSabatoJr @BreitbartNews How can we invest and or contribute?
1341451050151120896 2020-12-23 02:30:27 +0800 <LordYupa2> @Justice4Rod Pardons seem like an act of benevolence.  Always wondered if Hunter would flip and spill the beans for a pardon for him and his family.   Maybe the laptop was a way to flip without it being so obvious or explicit.
1341450356048289799 2020-12-23 02:27:42 +0800 <LordYupa2> @Justice4Rod Agreed.  Trying to think of a specific situation where Trumps benevolence would put him at an advantage?
1341449689997045760 2020-12-23 02:25:03 +0800 <LordYupa2> @JonnyMicro This is an interesting topic.  We know that people alter their behavior when they believe that are being watched.  Does believing God is watching you change behavior?   Is that good or bad?  Is it different if  we believe an elf is watching?  If we believe the state is watching?
1341419979107749888 2020-12-23 00:27:00 +0800 <LordYupa2> @Justice4Rod Explain a little more.  Thanks!
1341416499928449024 2020-12-23 00:13:10 +0800 <LordYupa2> @elenochle I am sure he gets a lot of DMs.  It would be great if their was central coordinated organization.  But loose coordination still works. Everyone reaches a slightly different group.  I will retweet both efforts.
1341415906400903168 2020-12-23 00:10:49 +0800 <LordYupa2> @JennaEllisEsq Good thing our ancestors didn‚Äôt try to work within the British law to overthrow the tyranny.

1341087593757216768 2020-12-22 02:26:13 +0800 <LordYupa2> @hrtablaze If the situation is already handled by other investigations or operations...no need for a special counsel.
1341044101630763008 2020-12-21 23:33:23 +0800 <LordYupa2> @crushmarxismnow @realjunsonchan Yes that pissed me off. Lost a lot of money.  I am sue they were under a lot of pressure to settle these.
1340863281964060672 2020-12-21 11:34:53 +0800 <LordYupa2> @realjunsonchan @CodeMonkeyZ @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump I think Pence has seen enough he is certain there was widespread fraud.  He has no doubt.  Which means what he has to do is crystal clear.
1340743627891326977 2020-12-21 03:39:25 +0800 <LordYupa2> @MajorPatriot I think white hats made it look like trump hotel.  They are safe in an undisclosed location.

1340246476295827462 2020-12-19 18:43:55 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KillAuDeepState Is that much traffic required for election data?   Maybe it was vast amounts of other info that was being moved...stolen.
1340245822437433344 2020-12-19 18:41:19 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KillAuDeepState Would be very easy to move Trump hotel curtains too a separate site to make it look like they are at a Trump Hotel.  I don‚Äôt think they are there.

1339563304998457349 2020-12-17 21:29:14 +0800 <LordYupa2> @CodeMonkeyZ Purposefully cause issues with the punch cards so they get rejected and replaced with electronic voting systems which provide more avenues to manipulate the votes.  Kinda brilliant in an evil way.
1339350446599598080 2020-12-17 07:23:25 +0800 <LordYupa2> @RealSaavedra ‚ÄúMy friends, I have read this document in its entirety and it is so equally lacking in rhetorical force, boldness of conception, and original research that it amounts to a triple null set, a vacuum inside a blank inside an abyss.‚Äù

1337773436689469440 2020-12-12 22:56:56 +0800 <LordYupa2> @BarryRChapman @HLAurora63 I have always thought that these governors were turning their states into shitholes to purposely  push liberals into red states.
1336807107438419968 2020-12-10 06:57:05 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KillAuDeepState @RepSwalwell They absolutely have video!!

1336009150489190401 2020-12-08 02:06:17 +0800 <LordYupa2> @MiloForSenate Just like Hillary and Biden do not represent white America!
1336003966748905473 2020-12-08 01:45:42 +0800 <LordYupa2> @RealTargetTori You run a serious risk of eroding or completely washing away the toothpaste if you apply water afterwards.  Now if you are one of those sad consumerists that use as much toothpaste as shown in the their commercials..wash away!
1335096240665579522 2020-12-05 13:38:43 +0800 <LordYupa2> @1JohnEBravo My company too.  Basic security.
1335064240827162625 2020-12-05 11:31:33 +0800 <LordYupa2> @lexican_doit @RealUnFeminist Exactly. They are pushing this so so hard. Why??  Hidden agenda.

If you think the world is overpopulated....Make up a disease and force everyone to get ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù. Oops you can‚Äôt have any more babies Sorry about that.  And of course it will be the  US and Western Europe primarily affected.  They are pushing this vaccine hard!  Why??????
1335057567324622849 2020-12-05 11:05:02 +0800 <LordYupa2> @drefanzor @CodeMonkeyZ I say this to my wife all the day one!  Lol.
1334606113673596928 2020-12-04 05:11:07 +0800 <LordYupa2> @MiloForSenate That‚Äôs what I was thinking.  Drop some video.  Have everyone deny  and deny.  Drop some more video...  and then you have sworn statement s from the people who actually did that scanning.  They have to know who they are...and they don‚Äôt want to go to prison!!
1334569828527431680 2020-12-04 02:46:56 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ZubyMusic You could also bleach or darken skin.  Straighten hair.  Get leg lengthening procedures.  Eyelids modified. Develop an accent. Change your name.

1334366104198606848 2020-12-03 13:17:25 +0800 <LordYupa2> @samanthamarika1 @USATrump4eva They are really really pushing the vaccinations.  That makes me super skeptical about it.  I guarantee you the ‚Äúvaccination‚Äù they get is not what the general public gets.
1334213869238030336 2020-12-03 03:12:29 +0800 <LordYupa2> @MattWalshBlog It‚Äôs incredible that Japan and China can even function as the palette of skin tones is extremely limited!!!

1333092851232587779 2020-11-30 00:57:58 +0800 <LordYupa2> @RepDougCollins Get off your ass.  Don‚Äôt you know Trump has been on this for years.  The good evidence has not been seen yet.   Use you common sense and come down on the right side of history.

1331960000084733952 2020-11-26 21:56:25 +0800 <LordYupa2> @CodeMonkeyZ @RonColeman Like Trump does with his tweets.  They can‚Äôt help themselves.

1330120172410183683 2020-11-21 20:05:36 +0800 <LordYupa2> @AwakenedOutlaw My thoughts exactly.  I think they used some of the cheating that occurred in 2018 to get warrants in place to monitor and capture everything.

The fix was in for her as well she was certain she was going to win because they were going to cheat.  Maybe the white hats interfered and she lost.  She just couldn‚Äôt accept that because it was certain.  Identical to Hillary‚Äôs response

If all of the information had been declassified .   He may have won. And all of the voting issues would not have come to light.  He wanted them to cheat.

They will have learned the system has a much higher tolerance for fraud then they could have ever guessed.

1327835626083782656 2020-11-15 12:47:37 +0800 <LordYupa2> @Timcast They knew they were going to cheat. If you know they are going to cheat you set traps. You gather information.   You get indisputable proof. That proof will change the election.  You will see.
1327766876462538753 2020-11-15 08:14:26 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KillAuDeepState Correct.
1327717827231449088 2020-11-15 04:59:32 +0800 <LordYupa2> @DineshDSouza @KLMacRae Yes it is!

1327707850655711232 2020-11-15 04:19:53 +0800 <LordYupa2> @GavinWax Great catch.

1327616978199085058 2020-11-14 22:18:48 +0800 <LordYupa2> @WarTimeGirl Exactly.  They have trapped them in a dozen ways.  They gathered evidence in 2018 elections  that they have just been sitting on.  FISA goes both ways.   All of these people were being monitored and all text messages recorded.
1327616028776353797 2020-11-14 22:15:01 +0800 <LordYupa2> @LeahR77 I think soon after the election all of these shutdowns and removal of freedoms will be deemed unconstitutional by SCOTUS.
1327611929616007168 2020-11-14 21:58:44 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ScottAdamsSays Trump tweeted about vote switching in 2012.  You think he was caught by surprise without a plan. üòÜ. It‚Äôs a trap.  He had to let them cheat to catch them cheating.  FISA goes both ways.  They have yet to be released video and audio.  I am sure they were monitoring the machines üëç

1327595490217660417 2020-11-14 20:53:25 +0800 <LordYupa2> @realDonaldTrump @WarTimeGirl Trump has known for a long time.   He has had many many  years to to devise his plans and devise his traps.
1327442328777232385 2020-11-14 10:44:48 +0800 <LordYupa2> @RepStevenSmith @KathyBoockvar Interesting....if you know they are going to cheat....you watch them.
1327433659834535936 2020-11-14 10:10:21 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ChefGruel @USATrump4eva Because now it is looking like Trump will win.....
1327433218782478337 2020-11-14 10:08:36 +0800 <LordYupa2> @RedWingGrips That‚Äôs why Q said she wasn‚Äôt supposed to lose.  They cheated.  Cheated like hell.   And lost.
1327416340320174080 2020-11-14 09:01:32 +0800 <LordYupa2> @Big4USA @UkraineBlues Gives them money and then manipulates the votes so they win!

1327307701643137024 2020-11-14 01:49:50 +0800 <LordYupa2> @TheMikelCrump If the Trump team knows votes were electronically inserted and or ballets were run numerous times then this may be enough to pull out a win. Otherwise I can‚Äôt explain they are not more aggressive on this.

1326971724714233856 2020-11-13 03:34:47 +0800 <LordYupa2> @unscriptedmike Yes. But had to let this play out publicly to show how the media lies.  How social media suppresses.  And slowly let the public come to the realization that fraud is real.

1326935623232417797 2020-11-13 01:11:20 +0800 <LordYupa2> @catturd2 He doesn‚Äôt say something unless it is true and he can prove it.  You think they have shown their entire hand??   Nope.  They had everything they needed the night of the election. All of the rest of this had been used to wake up the public to the problem.

1326585003237498880 2020-11-12 01:58:06 +0800 <LordYupa2> @CodeMonkeyZ Probably were doing a combination of everything.  And also had ballets in standby.
1326579067659800576 2020-11-12 01:34:31 +0800 <LordYupa2> @HD283271 Maybe they see what‚Äôs coming??

1322167901097373696 2020-10-30 21:26:06 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KillAuDeepState Was almost certain he would be swapped.  But looks like that‚Äôs not going to happen. I think that was the original plan but once it became clear they were going to lose they realized it would serve no purpose.

1320708100110757888 2020-10-26 20:45:23 +0800 <LordYupa2> @JohnFMiller86 So if we look at chimpanzee or gorilla societies does the lack of a dominant male in the group make any difference to how the younger males grow up?

So much is at stake for them, even if the plan was to cheat,  you would want the gap to be as small as possible.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense to not really run or run viable candidates

1313966454413369346 2020-10-08 06:16:29 +0800 <LordYupa2> @stillgray I think the owners were backed into a corner.  Support the black athletes and suffer the inevitable drop in income in the short term. Or don t support them and have much bigger long term problems with the players.  Maybe they had no choice but to go along with this.

Weird.  Maybe a change in strategy.   Maybe no longer swapping him out    And they are confident he will win by cheating?

If Joe shows and does poorly it is a distraction.  Actually a poor showing by Joe is the perfect  evidence of his undeniable ‚Äúdementia‚Äù and the perfect trigger for his replacement.  No body would batt an eye!

After she comes under scrutiny what better distraction than Joe dropping out and she and Michelle step in.  Then she can yell that any attacks  are all political.   You think today‚Äôs revelations make any difference to the left??  Joes charade is almost up.

1309465557536657409 2020-09-25 20:11:32 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KillAuDeepState Article from 2016 but addresses process if any candidate drops out after nomination but before the election.  Funny how in 2016 they thought it was trump who might drop out. There are multiple bets on Predictit for a scenario where Biden drops out and is replaced.

Kamala doesn‚Äôt seem ready for the top of the ticket.  Or ready for VP spot for that matter.  Hillary is more experienced and a better debater.  But didn‚Äôt have the energy for a long campaign

1304013211105030145 2020-09-10 19:05:51 +0800 <LordYupa2> Trump is the greatest president of all time. Who else would have the fortitude and resolve to move forward under daily blistering attack.

1304009157142487040 2020-09-10 18:49:45 +0800 <LordYupa2> This worries me because because Chris and Andrew Cuomo seem like highly vindictive slime who are likely plotting revenge.  This seems to be leading somewhere however....feels like a buildup... to revealing a criminal act? And  where did he get these tapes from?
1304006793660522496 2020-09-10 18:40:21 +0800 <LordYupa2> @JuliansRum Yes I know people who are on board with flat earth.   Just so many proofs it is not true.  Almost Every other celestial body is spherical due to gravity and how they were made.    The rules of physics would have to not apply to a flat earth.
1303759884760932352 2020-09-10 02:19:13 +0800 <LordYupa2> @fitlineusa1 Just ordered one. Waiting...so many options!!
1303695887026200576 2020-09-09 22:04:55 +0800 <LordYupa2> @catturd2 He should turn it down.  He doesn‚Äôt need the recognition from such a corrupt organization. Call it worthless. Since it is.
1303685579511607297 2020-09-09 21:23:58 +0800 <LordYupa2> @FairyQ15 @GreyGhost_Biker Physical distortion often goes hand in hand with  mental distortion.  These lead to being unsuccessful with work/career/love. Which leads to anger  and blaming society for their problems. Antifa provides  a sense of purpose, an outlet for their anger and a sense of virtue.
1303682272298631169 2020-09-09 21:10:49 +0800 <LordYupa2> @catturd2 It doesn‚Äôt appear as if Biden and Kamala are are actually running....it is the kind of behavior you would expect if they knew they were going to be swapped out.  Low energy, lack of engagement, purposeful incompetence.  Interesting.
1303489140420349953 2020-09-09 08:23:23 +0800 <LordYupa2> @SomeBitchIKnow Yes Black people don‚Äôt like criminals!
1303487930116108288 2020-09-09 08:18:34 +0800 <LordYupa2> @TheHonorableAT I vote for $1,000,000 an hour and free Toilet Paper for life!
1303457666258198529 2020-09-09 06:18:19 +0800 <LordYupa2> @d_satman47 @JoanneR10 Huge size disparity.  He just slapped him a few times.  The difference is our guys just roughed him up a little. If the roles were reversed..Antifa would have stomped the guy to death.
1303456719708749826 2020-09-09 06:14:33 +0800 <LordYupa2> @MrMichaelBurkes Holy crap dude.  Not cool.   Lots of prayers for you. Hopefully atrump supporter in your area will hire you!!  You put it all on the line for all of us.  Thank you!  Can you post about your field of employment and general area?
1303024234063568898 2020-09-08 01:36:01 +0800 <LordYupa2> @VFL2013 @kimfreethinker Wow!!! My grandma had my mom at 14 and my. Mom had me at 16.  My grandma is only 30 years older than me :)
1302365009276596226 2020-09-06 05:56:29 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KessenaO I unfollowed him long ago.  Bait and switch.
1301961327326367745 2020-09-05 03:12:24 +0800 <LordYupa2> @CharriseLane Well put!
1301897246229684228 2020-09-04 22:57:46 +0800 <LordYupa2> @bennyjohnson He is providing city property for their hidden  tent city that they rest  in during the day.
1301617792253214720 2020-09-04 04:27:19 +0800 <LordYupa2> @SavannaSavage45 There is nothing wrong with torture a slow death for some. It helps give closure to families if they know the person suffered greatly.  If someone  did something this grotesque to my daughter I would want them to suffer. Monsters are not entitled to a merciful death.
1301612784619143173 2020-09-04 04:07:25 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ZubyMusic Damn that was good.  Original or borrowed?
1301590988566085634 2020-09-04 02:40:48 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ali Sounds like cure  for COVID-19 secured?
1301563741528416257 2020-09-04 00:52:32 +0800 <LordYupa2> @thehill Romney did something very very bad and is basically now a sock puppet for Soros.
1301530585031032832 2020-09-03 22:40:47 +0800 <LordYupa2> @Kraphty23 @kirstiealley If you molested a kid and you go to prison it is basically a death sentence.   People will do exactly as they are told to avoid the humiliation and likely death.
1301280050491191297 2020-09-03 06:05:15 +0800 <LordYupa2> @prayingmedic Also once you have corrupted and controlled people in positions of power you can then use them to promote and advance others that are controlled.  Over time the number of controlled people in positions of power increases exponentially and the span of control becomes very  wide.
1301258587738484737 2020-09-03 04:39:58 +0800 <LordYupa2> @KarluskaP I saw CNN headline that Joe was responsible new highs were because they thought Joe would win!!ü§£
1301204799572987905 2020-09-03 01:06:14 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ReneeCarrollAZ @realDonaldTrump Most of these Antifa types are rejects. Desperately looking for meaning, purpose and significance.  They have brainwashed themselves into thinking they are doing something good.
1301194248402870272 2020-09-03 00:24:18 +0800 <LordYupa2> @LeonydusJohnson I always tell my daughter that humans come in all colors just like dogs and cats. :)
1301191676589875201 2020-09-03 00:14:05 +0800 <LordYupa2> @ZubyMusic @LayahHeilpern If it was anyone else but you I would think you were joking. ü§î
1301189457261899776 2020-09-03 00:05:16 +0800 <LordYupa2> @prageru Also everyone imagines that if they were raised in a culture of slavery,  where it was the norm,  that due to their inherent goodness they could see the evil of it.   That is not the case. Humans absorb the morals and norms of their society with little question.
1301188140871217154 2020-09-03 00:00:02 +0800 <LordYupa2> @prageru @ColSDM All have succumbed to the temptation of free/lower cost labor to enrich themselves.
1300921089514594304 2020-09-02 06:18:52 +0800 <LordYupa2> @AntoniaDianaMay It‚Äôs BS to make people think their relationship is super special.  The weird thing (Placebo effect) is that if you believe this do you increase the odds of creating a better relationship?  Do you increase  the odds of greater happiness?
1300785820018769921 2020-09-01 21:21:21 +0800 <LordYupa2> @LEBassett Too be clear you are a liar.   And knowingly so for political purposes.
