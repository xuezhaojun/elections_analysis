A long one yes however each stage  needs to be done at exactly the right time for it to stick. The system of the past is being brought to its knees &amp; replaced with a new one .. politically &amp; financially. Only one shot so its got to be right!

I've played sport most my life &amp; know im a likely candidate eventually, but not after 1 week..?
1340392532342009856 2020-12-20 04:24:17 +0800 <InVixter> @NFL_Notecard @JasonBoylan7 @RobSchneider Ive seen 2 separate docs and the same diagnosis.  Only a little research later and there it was hidden in some fine print.  Tetanus vaccine/osteo arthritis. I think it's called reactive arthritis then it settles into itself. I'm not or wasn't an anti-vaxer but its looking iffy..
1340391678159437824 2020-12-20 04:20:54 +0800 <InVixter> @NFL_Notecard @JasonBoylan7 @RobSchneider The vaccine injury didn't cross mutt mind at first. Then I research the osteo and it's causes and there it was....  None one moment then after the vaccine out was in almost every joint after 25 xrays. I want an anti-vaxer but now I'm having thoughts they may be on to something?
1340390647665061888 2020-12-20 04:16:48 +0800 <InVixter> @JasonBoylan7 @RobSchneider Normally yes just a stupid accident with a toe, no cut skin etc yet the nurse gave a tetanus without asking. I thought perhaps it was anti-biotic at first.  Later i was told of the add-ons in tetanus-meningococcal,typhoid, whooping cough &amp; diphtheria. I already the inoculations.

Yuck I know but, there was NO broken skin...  A week later I'm full of osteoarthritis.  Coincidence... I doubt it. Not always anti, just anti forced.

If so, how is that impartial?  I'm Australian, it's different here, hence why I'm slow understanding the process. 😊

My dad also fought in WW2, a brave soldier lucky enough to come back &amp; he would love how Trump supports the military.  You don a uniform then go into battle in a foreign country then say that. .. Disrespectful Coward
1302690156298686465 2020-09-07 03:28:30 +0800 <InVixter> @dbongino We hairdressers are more powerful than they think!  Because we have everyone's ear, then they tell everyone and so on. ... I have gently woken most of my 'misinformed' clients &amp; friends by listening, asking then showing them docs &amp; pics I've collected. . Little BOOM! 😉💟
1302686866714423296 2020-09-07 03:15:26 +0800 <InVixter> @tom_kirwin @SacuShi_II @realTanyaTay You're right,  but these illustrate that 'staf' lives on the skin, the skin needs to breathe. Some are more prone.  Masks don't work against the virus so why scare people into wearing them at all?
1302686011164561408 2020-09-07 03:12:02 +0800 <InVixter> @ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump We can't vote Trump in Australia but we can wake up to what's happening all around us.  Many are also sharing to others, the beginning of change is so important but persistence is key! 👍💟 Hairdressers are one of freedoms biggest allies because we have everyone's ear!
1302684633746698240 2020-09-07 03:06:34 +0800 <InVixter> @KamVTV We hairdressers bend over backwards to please our clients, so for this piece of scum to ask the salon for an apology? ????? CHUCK her out!  https://t.co/KZ2UPRpAmW

Not at all Where's you're evidence to the contrary, debate &amp; research find the truth. So many woken have enough basic anatomy knowledge of our own bodies to be able to make personal health deductions.  'Experts' aren't 'all that'.. not any more!  They can lie too!
