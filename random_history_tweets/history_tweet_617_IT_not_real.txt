1344033086263050243 2020-12-30 05:30:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> I read a Wikipedia article &amp; a bunch of tweets.  I hereby proclaim, that in my expert opinion, repealing 230 is good and that Dems should call McConnell bluff and vote for it. Get 2K &amp; 230 repealed.  Let's start 2021 with an arms race to wipe all SM out of the face of the earth.  https://t.co/zVkLqrbIwU
1343966717899259905 2020-12-30 01:06:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> This idea -ingrained deeply in America's psyche - is the first one that Dems from (center to far-left) have to destroy if they want to have a shot at winning.  Citizens in every developed country have a higher trust in their gov than here. Hence, they can do &amp; get nice stuff.
1343962416158134272 2020-12-30 00:49:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> How are you going to persuade voters to choose Dems this way?  It's stupid &amp; self-defeating.
1343962414736293888 2020-12-30 00:49:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> without looking at the political realities that make the program perfect because the only one on the table!  Dems are saying two contradictory things all the time:   1) Government can &amp; does help!  2) All gov. policies/programs are not worth bragging about because it has flaws.
1343962413901627400 2020-12-30 00:49:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> Even the "realists" "pragmatic" "Liberals/Dems" who are definitely not like those "far-left idealists" who don't get the need to compromised do this.  They keep falling for the tramp of "well, X would be better policy, gov. program, etc"...

1343796684065701888 2020-12-29 13:51:10 +0800 <IT_not_real> And we, Dems &amp; Leftax instead of doing what R's and repeat like like robots "Gop does want to give 2k" like the GOP about  everything- even when they are lying.  We fall into "let's debate the merits instead of worrying about the silly GA runoff.  We are pure &amp; righteous!"
1343760623310540800 2020-12-29 11:27:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ModerateDarling @MattBoxer94 The point is free Media repeating:   "McConnell will not bring the 2k cash bill to the floor for an up &amp; down vote"   "GOP will not vote for 2K cash bill"  "Perdue &amp; Loeffler didn't push McConnell to get 2K for Georgians"  Clarification: I dislike Sanders. He still right.

1343758698565386241 2020-12-29 11:20:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Wavinator @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 Long term? Yes.  But this is the same as Dems are socialists. The only way to counter that is having a liberal propaganda arm like Fox/Right-wing Radio.  Short-Term, aka GA tunoffs? Republicans don't want to give you 2k cash in GA works.
1343752321600110592 2020-12-29 10:54:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 That's it.  All the other stuff, are technicalities that no one but political junkies get.    Low info voters DO NOT UNDERSTAND how a bill becomes law.

1343750314793439232 2020-12-29 10:46:55 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 It'll filibuster the military budget if McConnell doesn't put it for an up and down vote.   It still on McConnell, not Dems.  Also, the Defense bill will pass on January 5th, so who is that harmful to military families?
1343749139050336257 2020-12-29 10:42:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 They do.  Most military and vets would qualify for 2k cash.
1343748837039468546 2020-12-29 10:41:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 Dems have no power to push McConnell to put the bill on the floor in any other way but this one.  It reinforces the message:  Dems want to give families 2K.  GOP is stopping it. It keeps on people's minds &amp; in the free Media until the Jan 5, 2020 GA runoff.
1343748064809426945 2020-12-29 10:37:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 What's the messaging?   How is "Dems Senators and Pelosi want to give you 2K stupid?
1343747583244607488 2020-12-29 10:36:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 If our military is that feeble then we are already doomed.   This is SMART politics.  We need to win GA.  Forcing Republicans to go on record to vote against it is SMART politics.
1343747309176201216 2020-12-29 10:34:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MattBoxer94 I am sorry but this is a reflexible "I hate Sanders" tweet.  The military is not going to stop a coup because Sanders filibuster a bill to get 2K for people?   Which most of the military families would also qualify for?
1343262309016211457 2020-12-28 02:27:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @JHowardBrainMD @RadioFreeTom I would not be surprised if Trump try to nuke GA.

1343034908529156096 2020-12-27 11:24:09 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @blackgirlinmain Agree.  The best a parent can do: Answer every "I hate you" with "I love you" but have clear lines, expectations, promote independence by giving choices and not shielding from consequences good or bad. Also, teach about wrong by admitting when are &amp; talking about your failures.

1343021801077526528 2020-12-27 10:32:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> This.  We cannot force the Media to report  the truth. We cannot force them to Republican senators and members of congress are blocking the 2k payment.   They keep saying "Congress"   The only solution for Dems is inefficiently burn money to tell people the truth in national ads.
1342951479502467072 2020-12-27 05:52:38 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is not tougher.  @JoeBiden @TeamJoe needs to win GA runoffs.   To that he needs to blame McConnell, Loeffler &amp; Perdue - and every GOP Senator.    He's not doing that.  Biden needs to do it.

The "logic" behind irrational arguments comes from two places: irrationality, ignorance, and even more relevant than anything else: interested parties weaponizing it to achieve their goals &amp; further their interests.
1342946515573075969 2020-12-27 05:32:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> This made me laugh because "taxes will pay for itself with growth" and "trick down economics" have the same economic fact &amp; logic as 2+2=5.

You have educated parents who were able to know how to help get a good k12 education and then help with what to get in &amp; study in college. Most don't. 2. Most don't have parents to help them finance the early years of adulthood.

This would be a mistake, and it will indeed become another "Congress couldn't get it done" instead of "GOP stop it."

But, if it does allow it, then it would be beneficial if UC doesn't pass and then Dems come back on Monday and do another bill.   It would reinforce the idea that Dems want to give 2k and GOP/McConnell are stopping it + more Media.

The only thing out your mouth should be: "McConnell should put up to an up &amp; down vote the bill passed by the House in March. Or Dems, will do an individual 2k bill....put this on Loeffler, Perdue &amp; McConnell."
1341559275106099201 2020-12-23 09:40:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is as close as a win-win that Dems could get.  1. McConnell refuses. It hurts Loeffler &amp; Perdue. 2. McConnell forces Loeffler &amp; Perdue to vote against it....it hurts in GA. 3. McConnell put to vote. Dems + Loeffler &amp; Perdue vote for it. 50/50 means Pence has to break it.
1341557075449499648 2020-12-23 09:31:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> And it works for China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and every other country dominate by kleptocracy and corruption.  Dealing with corrupt people is easy. They always have a price.
1341556363705548800 2020-12-23 09:28:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> It will force @KLoeffler @Perduesenate to vote it.  @HawleyMO will vote for it. All Dems will vote for it.
1341556362472345601 2020-12-23 09:28:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> Dems should say they definitely support an increase to 2k, more money for small businesses, higher UI benefits for Americans, and a restaurant-specific rescue bill.   In fact, Dems should say "We passed that bill in March. McConnell should listen to Trump &amp; put that on the floor"
1341514571459092482 2020-12-23 06:42:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Utopia
1341430588536852480 2020-12-23 01:09:09 +0800 <IT_not_real> The Senate runoffs in Georgia also invited a deal. McConnell had promised GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler weeks ago that the Senate would not leave for Christmas without a new law.   https://t.co/q2PWmvfaTk via @politico
1341423898156404736 2020-12-23 00:42:34 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is a problem when Americans design/craft government programs, services, and policies.  Americans want policies to achieve multi-things, often contradictory, and it's end ups being ineffective at all of it.   You see in education, urban planning, taxes, safety net, etc.
1341248821074874369 2020-12-22 13:06:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ShaneSafir @DenaSimmons @chrisemdin This is what Americans of all races need!   Less accountability,  more "you are special. We will adapt to your needs. It does not matter that real life will not be as accommodating.....you will have pretty of failure! You experience that on your own. No need to prepare for it!"
1341241868042948608 2020-12-22 12:39:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @billscher  https://t.co/dNupqBoRBV
1341238473215201281 2020-12-22 12:25:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @speechboy71 This is 100% truth.  Maybe what some of the left want - but refuse to say out loud - is for Dems to play "no negotiating with terrorists" for once?  The terrorists/kidnapper (McConnell/GOP) already know that we (Dems) are always going to cave to avoid suffering...and they use it.
1341225151002599425 2020-12-22 11:32:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Presenting the tradeoffs avaliable to Pelosi and saying:   Ok, this is what she could have gained if she did A and these are the costs.   Presenting either choice as the ONLY path is disingenuous.   I just wish Twitter stop doing this. But I guess that's why I'm bad at twitter.
1341224436524003328 2020-12-22 11:29:59 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey If I was Nancy Pelosi I would make the same choices she made.  But I confess that's a position that comes from caring for Americans, not machiavellian cunning, strength, or master negotiation.  The question to ask is: How much pain are we willing to inflict on people?
1341223344985686019 2020-12-22 11:25:38 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey but it's the same reason why the USA has a "we do not negotiate with terrorists" and why sometimes bombing a place with civilian casualties is a valid choice.  It's the same. We, Dems/Pelosi,  just don't have the stomach for it. The GOP/McConnell knows it &amp; takes advantage of it.
1341222787541729282 2020-12-22 11:23:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey But don't help by unconditionally praising Pelosi without acknowledging that there are VALID merits in the idea of letting McConnell/GOP torture the hostages.  There are. We don't like it - as Dems - because we care about people...
1341221624071086086 2020-12-22 11:18:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Both approaches have pros &amp; cons.  It's just as wrong to praise Nancy Pelosi as the best negotiator ever and doing everything right as it's wrong to blame Nancy Pelosi/Dems for no somehow forcing McConnell/GOP to do what they really don't want to do.  Neither is realistic.
1341220978123149312 2020-12-22 11:16:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey to torture the hostages to show Dems/Nancy are serious. Is that price we want to pay?  Or do we want to take the "better take this now because we care about the people/voters suffering and don't what we can get tomorrow? which is the Dems/Pelosi's usual approach.
1341220442363678720 2020-12-22 11:14:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey again, that means gambling a deal on Dems winning both Senate seats in GA and letting people suffer.  GA is a long shot.  The left has to acknowledge the dilemma: Yes, Nancy didn't extract the best deal avaliable. Getting the best deal meant allowing the kidnapper (McConnell/GOP)
1341219599665131520 2020-12-22 11:10:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Sigh. Why everything has to be black &amp; white?  Pelosi had more leverage in March. This is the truth.  She could have used it but that meant allowing people to suffer even more.   Pelosi has some -not much- leverage now. She could use it as McConnell is afraid for GA...
1341218478343114754 2020-12-22 11:06:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @_jack_fox_  https://t.co/j7w6LHVNfU
1341189984443764738 2020-12-22 09:13:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> The lies. And it will be amplified by Fox/Right Media **FOR FREE**  And we, Dems, are reduced to paying for ads and unsuccessfully begging on our knees to the "liberal media" to please stop using "both sides."
1341183262954115073 2020-12-22 08:46:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @madrid_mike @Timodc @BulwarkOnline This is correct. And the divide is education-level.   We can accept this reality or deny it. Still, it's a huge factor.
1341152092463845376 2020-12-22 06:42:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> "The core of the issue is that Dems haven't spent the money/power necessary to build a messaging network capable of carrying their messages directly to the people"   This.  Podcast will not do this.  Twitter will not do this.  Maybe Facebook+Youtube but requires a lot of MONEY.
1341148887877181440 2020-12-22 06:29:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> Exactly.   Everything expires in April-March 2021 with not automatic triggers.
1341125215741341696 2020-12-22 04:55:42 +0800 <IT_not_real> @leahmcelrath Rehabilitation time!!
1341115626660585472 2020-12-22 04:17:36 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DavidCornDC @dominionvoting and @smartmatic should sue them and force them to air an hourly retraction in every plattaform for a month.  It could end up being the thing to save our democracy.
1341114307208073217 2020-12-22 04:12:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom @JenSeniorNY What would help? Stop fetishization of the "small business owner" as the ideal.  The business owner in Congress either inherited it or ran the sales/PR side of the business.   I fully admit that's a good fit for a politician to win elections but not for goverment policy.
1341102163125104642 2020-12-22 03:24:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @FPWellman I want to go down the rabbit hole where Hugo Chavez is alive, powerful, and smart enough to own and influence the US election.  But I'm scared that I will never come out.
1341101194865872897 2020-12-22 03:20:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> Endorse.   Everyone who's an expert in an area covered by the law, should pick that part of the legislation, read it and make a report for their MoC and Senators and send it to them.  Civic engagement!   (No irony)
1341100124869521408 2020-12-22 03:16:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @MattOrtega Latinos who flipped: Male, non-college-educated, rural, religious, 2nd+ generation aka....latinos who vote as white in states where there has been not race backlash.  (Simple question: Why did Latinos in AZ vote differently?)  Also, why is this hard to understand?
1341095350342336514 2020-12-22 02:57:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> *would not give Americans more.
1341095196549730304 2020-12-22 02:56:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> They never yell about what:  1. What Dems did.  2. What Dems fought for 3. Never put the blame on Republicans, which is where belongs.  It Dems don't yell about it...why should Americans believe that Republicans are the ones NOT HELPING THEM?
1341095195320803328 2020-12-22 02:56:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> Why can Pelosi/Dems say: "We wanted and fought for 1.2K for adults &amp; $500 for kids. We passed a law with it.  McConnell &amp; Republicans would give Americans more."  This is where @TeamPelosi @dscc &amp; Dems fail.
1341067174945820673 2020-12-22 01:05:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> This.   "Speak it plain" should be hammered into Dems' brain.  This is the thing AOC and Harrison - two people who are on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum have in common. Both great political talents.  P.S. Harrison would have won across either state the line (NC or GA)
1341062839713165313 2020-12-22 00:47:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Often "cut regulations" and "cut bureaucracy" equal to "increase corruption opportunities" and "weaken guardrails of democracy"  There are waste &amp; high costs that bureaucracy. In my opinion, it's a good price to pay.   Perfect equilibrium only excites in books, not reality.
1341057853566566400 2020-12-22 00:28:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Good salary. Good Benefits. Objective &amp; high standards to get hired on civil service.   The bureaucracy that people hate, is what has slow down the slide into autocracy. The people, who yeah, often are bitchy, see something wrong &amp; say "no, I won't."  It's not easy to say no.

It's the equivalent of one sibling getting away with the worse stuff and when the parents turn around sticking their tongue and laughing at other rule-abiding siblings because they did!!
1340374260670337024 2020-12-20 03:11:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> Shame &amp; Shunning. Humans do not modify our behavior unless we paid a price. That's just the way we are.  What's the current price in the Trump administration for open corruption?  What's the price for lying? What's the price for attempting a coup?  Strangers yelling on SM?
1340340134282022912 2020-12-20 00:56:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> “white ethnic chauvinism" is an almost perfect description of Trump &amp; the GOP.  I would ad "white ethnic male chauvinism"
1340333926770864129 2020-12-20 00:31:24 +0800 <IT_not_real> On point.
1340140559432785921 2020-12-19 11:43:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is not criticism. I think all Dems should do it, too!  I think we should it called "post-postmodernist populism" fake, fiery words of populism meant for uninformed voters that demand irrational &amp; conflicting policy, which translates to the same compromising needed to govern.
1340140557704695808 2020-12-19 11:43:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> LOL. Sanders got away with the image of a revolutionary. In the end, he's just a politician who understands how the sausage is made.  "I've said what I said" is what Trump, Sanders, &amp; most GOP Senators do. "I say what I say" &amp; then turn around and do what they need or want to do.
1340118242195435521 2020-12-19 10:14:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> @leahyland @notcapnamerica That's the reality in politics.   A reality that the far-left cannot accept. AOC is savvy enough to know that she will get destroyed by the Left Twitterati, the moment she compromises.   The dilemma? No compromising starts weighing on your conscience if you care about people.
1340117056557969409 2020-12-19 10:09:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> @leahyland @notcapnamerica Maybe AOC didn't want to really be seated in a powerful House committee chair?   Once a MOC is on one of these committees the excuses run out.   Plus, it's easier to be the "victim of the establishment" than to say "Ok, I had to compromise on A to W to get this tiny bit of Z."
1340112922521915396 2020-12-19 09:53:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> You can hate on AOC.   But this is GREAT MESSAGING.   This is what every Dem should be saying.  This is what @ossoff &amp; @ReverendWarnock need to say over &amp; over &amp; over...yes, use GOP toolkit: Unflattering pictures of McConnell, @KLoeffler @Perduesenate ominous music &amp; voiceover.
1340087701790330881 2020-12-19 08:13:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> Russia is a weaker power than the USA but guerilla and asymmetric tactics - like cyberwarfare, disinformation, spycraft, etc - do win.   Not all the time but often enough against larger, more powerful countries.   Americans won the revolutionary war.  Anericans "lost" in Vietnam.
1340076269090742273 2020-12-19 07:27:34 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anneapplebaum But they don't care if they accused o hypocrisy.  In fact, it makes them chuckle in amusement when the left goes crazy about it ...as the Media - including the "liberal" Media - never does.

1340021714697142272 2020-12-19 03:50:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ThePlumLineGS @AOC @danpfeiffer @willwilkinson How you talk about stuff MATTERS.  Talking about coronavirus is great if the context is:  "Scary &amp; corrupt GOP doesn't want to help YOU. Vote for @ossoff &amp; @ReverendWarnock so the bad guys - GOP Senators/McConnell - stop standing in the way of Dems helping you"  (crudely)
1340019466055213056 2020-12-19 03:41:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> Sometimes, I have this perverse instinct - something that I actually hate about myself - that pushes me to think/feel.   "Go ahead, do this. People will suffer but the GOP donors enabling all of this will also get hit.   Maybe pain is the only effective teacher."
1340019465195462657 2020-12-19 03:41:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> So not only do GOP Senators want to put the Biden administration on life-support by denying any meaningful and essential fiscal stimulus....but now they want to strip away the Fed from helping the economy.

1339609837135560710 2020-12-18 00:34:08 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mcpli Maybe it's a nerd thing.  But I find airports uplifting -not only in a romantic way but in an "aww, look at humans" way.  On unusually sad/bad days, I would sit &amp; watch friends, family, kids, couples...greeting each other full of happiness. It never failed to make me feel better.
1339589468467068930 2020-12-17 23:13:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Noahpinion College is not the only path to knowledge. I know plenty of people without even HS who are wiser than people with Ph.D.'s   But that's the exception. Not the rule.   Education promotes critical thinking, introspection, empathy &amp; gratitude as a by-product of perspective.
1339588739610263558 2020-12-17 23:10:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Noahpinion I share this core belief.  My obsession with strong prek12 education and yes, even "free college" is due to a strong belief that educated countries make better decisions for themselves.   Ignorance breeds ignorance
1339573279682568193 2020-12-17 22:08:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> It's so easy.   Dem Senators, standing up with some solemn music/imagery telling Americans the ways they are trying to help them and then the villains (GOP Senators) stopping it.  Americans act like children. Give an old fashion good/bad guy story to hold on too.
1339571487645126658 2020-12-17 22:01:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> I think Dems should do this - but only IF they combine it with a massive TV/FACEBOOK ad campaign saying "this is our proposal to help you. GOP is blocking it"  People's lives are on the line....but VOTERS need to feel the pain of their decisions.   They keep choosing pain.

Going to swing states to cut ribbons for projects is great political capital to spend later on.
1339369662199394306 2020-12-17 08:39:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RedRedSuit @joshtpm @RadioFreeTom I prefer dull &amp; highly specialized technocrats with long careers in the area that they will work - ideally within the agency but if not, in the field.   I think that's reasonable if what we value is expertise.   However, I understand the political reality. Biden owes Pete.

1338648708519403520 2020-12-15 08:54:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> This was my grandmas' favorite prayer.  Both of them.
1338589924371492865 2020-12-15 05:01:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mattsheffield Often - too often - I think "maybe this person is targeting me for active measures" then I laugh.  Why would go to that much trouble? I don't have a political job. I don't have that many followers. I have zero influence.  Humility is the only check against conspiratorial ideas.
1338588835559530496 2020-12-15 04:57:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mattsheffield The origin of conspiratorial thinking is our narcissism and navel-gazing.   If you feel like the center of the universe then your issue becomes the most important, any attacks or criticism mass coordination &amp; the reaction disproportionate.

I support 1.2K covid check - as fiscal policy - but is regressive, not progressive. Unemployment benefits are progressive.
1337192821602717697 2020-12-11 08:29:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> It's the "populists" path for any GOP hopeful.

1337135555021172736 2020-12-11 04:42:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is the only way the Media can justify to itself how is reporting this attempted coup.

Dems need to start acting in ways we may not like but that makes the argument: "See, the government (especially Dems) is not the problem. We are doing stuff for voters."
1334960049681141760 2020-12-05 04:37:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> If Biden can make it automatic - preferably with a big beautiful letter** saying:  "Mr. President Joe Biden &amp; Kamala Harris administration want to help you in this difficult times and hereby forgive X amount of your student debt."  That would work.
1334960048536133633 2020-12-05 04:37:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> My only problem with this?   The people who will more likely to benefit are low-income college dropouts or college graduates from for-profit colleges.    These people are highly unlikely to go thru the paperwork/bureaucratic process to get the debt forgiven.
1334930119551422464 2020-12-05 02:38:36 +0800 <IT_not_real> We didn't laugh because "we" don't want to look smug or condescending or "look down on people."  We should laugh.  The cult of idiocy cannot be allowed to continue to grow.  People aren't idiots or liars.  They choose to act like idiots &amp; tell lies.  It's their choice.

1334669707362779139 2020-12-04 09:23:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> This. Sometimes we must accept that the flaws in the system will always be with us and work around them.

I believe a lot of those MAGA people who behave badly even when they know they are been record are the same.

Allowing people to believe they know what they are talking about when they DO NOT.  It promotes ignorance, entitlement, and bad behavior.   This is how we get "I will not wear masks" b.s.

1334623953231380481 2020-12-04 06:22:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> Well, maybe Biden should govern as Lincoln did.  He didn't give a f***k about it.   Yes, he made good speeches about unity but Lincoln did what he needed to do - often twisting arms along the way.

1334590063057911808 2020-12-04 04:07:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter There's a reason the main divider/predictor between a Trump vs a Biden voter was education.  Education showed the biggest correlation, that was in polling &amp; after results.   All other factors show were less predictive.

1334586548503736320 2020-12-04 03:53:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> Oh, look. Finally!
1334583373986111488 2020-12-04 03:40:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter That's relying on non-profits &amp; volunteers to do the work.   Why make it difficult? What's the goal in making hard?  In Nordic countries - which Dems keep praising - people don't even have to do their taxes!   It's all automatic.
1334582275036434433 2020-12-04 03:36:24 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter They didn't. Most got somebody else to help them.   You may not be "on-board" but this is the reality on the ground even if you cannot imagine this reality, it is.
1334566764026294272 2020-12-04 02:34:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter This will more popular than M4A, ACA, Public option, debt forgiveness, etc.   This would be the most consequential act Biden/Harris could ever do.  It would tangible evidence that government does work and it works for the people.  That government is NOT the problem.
1334566073694212098 2020-12-04 02:32:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter Which takes back to the point:  The one thing Dems can do that will be popular and with lasting consequences is to make a streamlined process for ALL benefits where you apply once and automatically get approved for everything from ACA to Pell grants, to State programs. ALL OF IT.
1334565270984122370 2020-12-04 02:28:50 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter In reality, mean testing and bureaucracy serve as a barrier.   It allows those with safety nets and/or who are educated/savvy enough to research, apply and do the legwork to get benefits while the ones who are not  -and needed the most- never apply.  That's the unintended result.
1334564024176967685 2020-12-04 02:23:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter Federal agencies do not talk to each other - in general - especially the IRS.   Even with the "free money" incentive a large % of people who qualify for gov. programs never apply.   The lower the income the more prevalent is this tendency. It's a bigger problem than "fraud"
1334561205311000576 2020-12-04 02:12:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter lol.    You need to volunteer to help people apply for benefits and then you will get the problem.
1334560596478500865 2020-12-04 02:10:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter No American gov. benefit works this way.   Should it work that way? Yes. But it does not &amp; never has. Why? Means testing it.   It was a problem even when they were doing it without any means-testing &amp; the 1.2k pandemic check.
1334559829050806274 2020-12-04 02:07:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter *will never get it.
1334559502343921664 2020-12-04 02:05:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter But it's also because applications are ridiculously long, use technical language that most prek12 and college dropouts don't understand, etc.   It makes people feel stupid...so they avoid and hide behind the "I don't take government handouts"
1334559381485019136 2020-12-04 02:05:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter It does not mean "no paperwork" but it means less. The more you ask from people - even if it helps them...the more likely that they will get it.   And yes, I admit a lot comes from Americans' sense of entitlement.
1334558443877748736 2020-12-04 02:01:42 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter A software solution with social workers and a PR campaign pushing people to apply.   Federally funded so states have no choice.   This is an administrative thing that Biden/Harris could do with an Executive order and could be sold as "eliminating waste &amp; increasing efficiency."
1334557540214927361 2020-12-04 01:58:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter No benefit in America is automatic. All of it involves paperwork, bureaucracy, etc.   Why? Because it means-tested on current levels - not the previous year.   Also, means testing is used by republicans to restrict access.
1334556838948290560 2020-12-04 01:55:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter I always said that Dems should do ONE thing and it will make everyone a Dem - even white working-class racists.   Eliminate applications &amp; paperwork.  Make ONE application to "rule them all"  One application that automatically qualifies everyone to every benefit -federal &amp; state.
1334556275493851136 2020-12-04 01:53:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter It works for those who are stubborn enough, get help, or savvy enough to do the paperwork.  Many low-income people who would qualify never even apply because the application feels daunting to them.  That's even with help. I see this on a DAILY basis.
1334555684990373888 2020-12-04 01:50:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter The people who will need the most are those with college debt who never graduated and low-income people who usually get turned off by any form of paperwork/bureaucracy.
1334555549602484225 2020-12-04 01:50:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter Means testing is ideal because college debt forgiveness feels elitist and it's regressive.   Problem: Making means-testing equals paperwork/bureaucracy and ends up making more regressive in reality.
1334554970801070080 2020-12-04 01:47:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @LAWriter I'm more concerned with prek12 but see free public/state college and/or student debt forgiveness as a temporary band-aid that may be necessary because prek12 is underperforming so badly.
1334369199125250048 2020-12-03 13:29:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> I agree with this for the following reasons:  1. Low info voters do follow political news. 2. Voters will not punish or reward good policy. Just PR and money in their pockets. 3. Bribing voters is bad long term. It may be the only way Dems can survive in 2022.   Bribe them.
1334368642708828161 2020-12-03 13:27:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> Joe Biden should do everything at once  https://t.co/xtnEpQyCqw via @voxdotcom

1334361154362122240 2020-12-03 12:57:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @DavidDRobbins Biden won the popular vote by a larger margin than Hillary.  Biden won the Electoral College by the same number as Trump (306 EC)  by larger margins in MI, PA, WI &amp; lower margins in AZ &amp; GA.   Also, lower margins in NV than Hillary.
1334341428084764673 2020-12-03 11:39:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is a great thing.  Poor kids - whites, blacks, latinos, immigrants, etc - are all suffering the brunt of the coronavirus.

1334337386428334081 2020-12-03 11:23:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> Unless Trump calls into Fox &amp; friend, Hannity, Tucker, and repeats all over without any qualms "Do not vote for Loeffler or Warnock" it's all nothing.   It will not make a difference. Those who think it does are doing what Dems always do: assume all voters are like them.
1334333045684330496 2020-12-03 11:06:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> If people don't have a fulfilling career, family, or inner life, "going viral" and having millions listen to their incoherent, often racists, and ignorant tirades can feel like the most significant thing they ever get to do with their lives.
1334333044107304961 2020-12-03 11:06:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> I think college-educated people underestimate how much "average Americans" crave 10 minutes of fame.  We see bad behavior by people got viral. Many of us think: "Maybe they had a bad day. It's unfair to do this to them."  I suggest that the majority are actually proud of it.

In many countries race is viewed as "what color is my skin relative to others in my community?" 2. Many people consider themselves white using this scale. 3. That includes people that sit at a family table with direct black relatives. 4. Many of them are racists. Most are not.
1333568316057690112 2020-12-01 08:27:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Rightturn_only @yashar I would promote a stealth phone/text banking campaign -If I had the organization &amp; money - just with this tweet contacting all registered Republicans/MAGA voters in GA.
1333567698236698625 2020-12-01 08:24:50 +0800 <IT_not_real> @yashar @joanwalsh If Dems were ruthless and machiavellian we should run stealth Facebook, youtube, and flyers letting all MAGA hats know that Trump does want them to support Republicans in GA.   But we will not do it.
1333564888086528001 2020-12-01 08:13:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @juliaioffe @neeratanden Of course, the GOP Senators think tweets are disqualifying.  And of course, the media is going to pretend to believe the outraged GOP Senators.
1333564404336508931 2020-12-01 08:11:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Noahpinion It's like when I tried to tweet &amp; ignore nuance.  I suck at it. Why? Because my mind does not work like that.  This is Hawley trying to pull a B.S. tweet like Trump and sounding like the Yale, Stanford, elite-educated, no stupid -but trying to fake it- person that he is.
1333563124834701315 2020-12-01 08:06:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Noahpinion This tweet about "Woke capitalist corporate liberal critical race theorist Marxists!!" actually gives me hope.  It confirms that Josh Hawley will not be as successful as selling himself as fake populists.   He just does not speak the MAGA hat language.
1333531783036424193 2020-12-01 06:02:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ThePlumLineGS @RepRubenGallego This should be an obvious tweet/point. But it's often ignored by the media.  If you are a Latino in Arizona subject to harassment ...you are not going to vote the same as a Cuban-American Latino in FL who has been champion &amp; protect by GOP &amp; American immigration policies.
1333531131380068353 2020-12-01 05:59:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ThePlumLineGS @RepRubenGallego If Texas or Florida suddenly implement the same policies that Arizona did.....Latinos in Texas and Florida will not be inclined to vote for the GOP.   But the GOP hasn't. That keeps latinos in Tx &amp; FL safely in a low-info bubble where can still vote for the GOP.
1333530065275998208 2020-12-01 05:55:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ThePlumLineGS @RepRubenGallego Latinos - like most voters - are low-info voters. They do not react to policy because they don't feel the consequences until it's too late.  AZ's Latinos felt the sting of GOP inmigrations policy &amp; positions with Arpaio &amp; "show me your papers laws"  That made the difference.
1333527715069104128 2020-12-01 05:45:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> Yes, @davidfrum was right when he warned about it.
1333522184774451200 2020-12-01 05:23:59 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica Also, the sets are always "perfect" and don't reflect how people actually live.   I'm convinced that a huge part of the "anti-coastal elites"  is people who look at tv shows and buy into the pr delusion that's how low/middle income &amp; broke students live.
1333518144082644992 2020-12-01 05:07:55 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is true in many non-college educated low-mid income communities. Especially, minorities - and why latinos men voted for Trump in larger numbers.
1333517312083673088 2020-12-01 05:04:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> Elected GOP &amp; voters hardly ever admit or talk about it.  It makes it easier to implement "gov. is a problem" obstruction &amp; negate helping people when you deny that you ever got anything from the gov.   I think Ms. Tanden's empathy &amp; expertise may be a good fit. Time will tell.
1333517310728966144 2020-12-01 05:04:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> I'm a believer in gratitude as a foundation for empathy.   People who feel resentful or that the world "owns" them or that they "never got a chance" have a hard time feeling empathy.  Gratitude starts with openly talking about the help you got along...including from gov.
1333486217942339584 2020-12-01 03:01:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> It's also where a "purge" of corruption in "civil servants" who couldn't meet security clearances, ethics, or position qualifications but given a job by Trump/GOP because of "loyalty."  I think Neera is tough &amp; partisan enough to do it and take the inevitable hits that will come.

1333472131762384896 2020-12-01 02:05:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RedRedSuit Most treasury secretaries never mention inequality or "opportunities"  Focus on fiscal, tax policy, financial health &amp; regulatory   Same as most Fed chairs never used to talk about unemployment. They use to focus on inflation, currency, financial health.

1333454712469823488 2020-12-01 00:55:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> @AdamSerwer The correct "analyzes" is that people don't understand gov policy,  not even taxes.   So if one Fox/Right wing repeats that "Trump lower taxes more anyone" they will believe it, even if their paycheck doesn't reflect that.

1332105657705582592 2020-11-27 07:35:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RedRedSuit @NGrossman81 @nytimes Maybe Obama's statement on Castro was not as harsh because of his years living outside America?  I don't know. I do know my views on Castro's is shaped by it.   There's not equivocation the Fidel was a dictator, who persecuted, torture, imprison &amp; murdered those who opposed him.
1331827386556448770 2020-11-26 13:09:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> Yes.   Worse? Georgia voters will not care and he's likely to win the runoff.

1331813454957617153 2020-11-26 12:14:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Proxy_Tank @ContentedIndie Yes, there's a small % of very active, weekly church-going Christians. But zealotry, at least in my limited observations, is unrelated to church-going.   In fact, I notice that many zealots rarely step into a church, and many live 10 commandants breaking "non-christian lives."
1331812209559625728 2020-11-26 12:09:09 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Proxy_Tank @ContentedIndie Maybe most Christians are "performative Christians"?  I know people who truly believe that "believing in God" and reading the Bible occasionally or listen to Christian music, a preacher on the radio, tv, or Facebook once a month, is all it takes.
1331805832699285505 2020-11-26 11:43:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 "Not force" but persuade until it became "instinctive" to craft policy were one of the first 3 questions was "would offend/please the USA?"   I saw up-close in Latin America.   It created quite the love-hate relationship.
1331805207567626244 2020-11-26 11:41:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Yes, that too.
1331805100700962816 2020-11-26 11:40:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 It was always about "pleasing the yankees" and not only by governments, rulings class, business interests.   It was a policy actively support by many in the "college-educated" emerging middle class in those countries.  Now, China is filling the void.
1331804449329672193 2020-11-26 11:38:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 I would argue till Bush.   And by soft "power" I mean biz opportunities, grants, scholarships, "good-will" missions, aid, etc. USAID power in developing countries used to be so huge that the person in charge of the local agency usually almost equal the ambassador in standing.
1331802654113026048 2020-11-26 11:31:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 But we did, once. To a degree, most Americans cannot fathom.   It's that highly diminish, now? Yes.  China - and in fact, Asia in general- has been at the forefront of pushing their "soft power" - which I would argue is the real power.

1331729520244580352 2020-11-26 06:40:34 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DevinsTractor Lol. This is why I never consider becoming a lawyer.  I'm not interested in debates about what "ought to be" but about what is.   So, we agree that the political reality is in 2020 that if voters decide they want a tyrant that's what will get no matter how bad it is.
1331728698760859648 2020-11-26 06:37:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DevinsTractor See Covid.  Also, again the same question.   Is that how it would work, at all? In America, in 2020?
1331728363732418560 2020-11-26 06:35:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DevinsTractor Ok. Reality check: Is that how it would work, at all?   In America, in 2020?
1331727891776765952 2020-11-26 06:34:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DevinsTractor Again if voters do not care if the Senators or the President are corrupt or criminal...why will they care if the local elected official is?
1331727279727144961 2020-11-26 06:31:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DevinsTractor Are you proposing the same thing Trump wants?  Go to the electors or legislature to overturn the voters?
1331726881800871937 2020-11-26 06:30:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DevinsTractor Ok. This is a distinction without a difference.  What can anyone do if people decide that they don't care about: corruption, criminality, not even policies that harm them and keep voting for Senator or President because they have an R or D after their name?
1331717347585839104 2020-11-26 05:52:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> I wish people accepted this.  If voters say "Be corrupt. Be a criminal. go ahead do harm me. I will still vote for you" there's nothing ANYONE can do.  No one can do anything if we are at that point.   In the end, people in a democracy choose.   That includes voters &amp; not voters.
1331700998289518593 2020-11-26 04:47:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anneapplebaum Why do this?  Authoritarians - not matter what ideology - need to prove those good things only come from them and nobody else.   Why?  Authoritarians - left &amp; right - always have a "base" of 30-40% of the population. Keeping that minority on their side is essential.
1331431936024199169 2020-11-25 10:58:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @owillis Also, the core issue is still the same: resources/money.
1331431759012007937 2020-11-25 10:57:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @owillis Dem "lie" standards are way higher, as you know.  All our standards are higher - which damages us.
1331431462365655040 2020-11-25 10:56:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @owillis P.S. I don't agree with it because you cannot unilaterally disarm but that's the nature of the Dem party from the majority of elected Dems to the most humble, occasional only votes on presidential elections, Dem voter.
1331430263344095232 2020-11-25 10:51:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> @owillis Yes. But Dems small donors cannot sustain a Fox/Right-wing Media.   Also, see the "they lie" replied. To do what they do, we would have to also lie.   Dems don't like it when Dems are not pure.
1331429465994379265 2020-11-25 10:48:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @owillis With what money? or Media empire?
1331417915158003712 2020-11-25 10:02:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is an interim, and costly solution.  It could be free...but it would mean that liberals, progressives, and Dems act in ways that are not consistent with our character.  E.g. IRL, Republicans do "activities" not related to politics &amp; talk politics while doing it. Dems don't.

1331391901543452672 2020-11-25 08:19:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> Is this real?   One more article that I REALLY need to read.  P.S. Why do we waste so much time in SM where we can read about hat-wearing sea urchins and learn something new?
1331391161961832449 2020-11-25 08:16:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> No, we don't which is the problem.  "Freedom" is just a buzz-word to behave like spoiled, bratty teens.  Don't like to use toddlers, because toddlers are faster learners and better than this.

But we have a problem.   What to do when the public is not able to deal with nuance? When people checkout and turn to simple misinformation &amp; lies when confronted with it?

1331359009035599872 2020-11-25 06:08:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TCFKA_NCSteve I think an underrated reason that many Americans distrust the media ... is because they don't understand them.  And I mean *understand* literally. The debates about law, economics, national security, etc. They don't get it and it's also why they feel the Media is "condescending"
1331358007427440641 2020-11-25 06:04:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TCFKA_NCSteve Agree.   But it's extremely rare for anyone in Media to just tell people:  "It's not my job to tell you what you want to hear."  "They are lying"  I wish it was part of their regular, weekly vocabulary.

1331327063786098688 2020-11-25 04:01:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> Often, way too often, we commit the sin of forgetting.  Forgetting how many people alive today - not even that old - suffer under segregation, Jim Crow, and constant violent racism.

1331008575359967232 2020-11-24 06:55:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica This one underrated way the meritocracy is dying in America, not only Corp. America but small business America.  Talented, skilled, knowedlge people are overlooked, ignored, and fired to be replaced by "networking" or "I brag louder" types  - aka family members, friends, etc.
1330996569856823296 2020-11-24 06:08:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @reesetheone1 This one of the reasons that Americans don't appreciate the role of the government and don't mind when the GOP tries to destroy it.   70% of government work is preventing bad stuff from happening e.g: pandemics, terrorist attacks, water pollution, financial collapse, etc.
1330995476498247681 2020-11-24 06:03:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @reesetheone1 This is like saying that if USA government had mandate masks, social distancing, contact tracing in February and we had kept the death count at *only* 50K because we implemented active measures to respond, Then someone twisting  "but but... pandemic, and doom and stuff."
1330992250541678594 2020-11-24 05:50:55 +0800 <IT_not_real> Normal, dull, and efficient is my favorite type of government employee - elected and not elected.
1330961651495886848 2020-11-24 03:49:20 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mikememoli @Transition46 I have profound respect for public servants - yes infamous "federal bureaucrats" -most highly qualified who could make significantly more in the private sector but choose to serve.  I don't know these people but it feels like rewarding expertise &amp; that career track.   I like it.
1330343231335272448 2020-11-22 10:51:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Not even 30%. Again, read the polls.   "How much life you breathe into a coup by engaging with it"  https://t.co/X3OdZIkToe
1330341890592542720 2020-11-22 10:46:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey 70% of GOP said it was stolen, in different polls.  Are you actively avoiding reality?
1330341704143134721 2020-11-22 10:45:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey I'm done with this insane, illogical argument of "let's accept the attempted coup because it will anger Trump's base."  Think about what you are saying for a minute. Next, you will tell me "Let's not use masks because it's too political &amp; angers MAGA"
1330340751390040066 2020-11-22 10:42:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> cc: @TWLadyGrey this what you will find over &amp; over &amp; over if you bother to actually talk to MAGA hats - or even read/see - what they are doing.
1330340189466619906 2020-11-22 10:39:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey And what would be the negative consequences of that?   Anyone who's ok with a coup, it's already energized by Trump insanity - go check out right-wing SM/Media and see it by yourself.    You are just "throwing things at the wall" at this point to defend an indefensible position.
1330339526888321024 2020-11-22 10:37:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ProfBrettWilson @magi_jay I'm not part of "Do something Dems" but I'm not a cheerleader either. Dems &amp; Pelosi, make mistakes.    Impeachment and an attempted coup -not matter how inept- are both situations that demand that the above. Not only because it's the right thing to do but it's politically smart.
1330339365571096576 2020-11-22 10:36:35 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ProfBrettWilson @magi_jay Fighting is "having a coherent, unified narrative/message that's repeated over and over in every medium possible - SM, traditional media, OP's, cocktail parties, state fairs, etc."  which is the strategy GOP uses when it goes to the mattress.
1330337800898666497 2020-11-22 10:30:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey It's beyond a disagreement.   "A partisan issue" means that all of 80 million people who voted have to sit down, silently and take the coup because it's too "partisan"  to tell the truth.
1330336836187680771 2020-11-22 10:26:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> Why aren't Dem Senators yelling this?
1330294973842001921 2020-11-22 07:40:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @ProjectLincoln I would do what Republicans would do if it was Dems trying to steal an election.  They would have everyone from the dog catcher to every Senator - ex-senator, etc. repeating "Banana republic" "Stealing election" "voters"  That's what Dems should do.
1330292667578806272 2020-11-22 07:31:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @ProjectLincoln Nobody said, Biden. You keep bringing Biden up to confuse and deflect from the issue.   I mention specific people: Pelosi, MoC, Dem Senators, Dems in SM, etc.
1330291700628140033 2020-11-22 07:27:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @ProjectLincoln I'm not from the "Dems do something" left.  But I'm not a cheerleader or a fangirl either.   Dems leadership are failing in raising the alarm and taking appropriate but political steps- even if they take the right legal ones - and they should be criticized for this. Period,
1330290963898568704 2020-11-22 07:24:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @ProjectLincoln No. They don't.  But you repeat with the tone, alarm and loud enough because people react to that. And make it "GOP elect leaders believes your vote means nothing"  Also, somethings are worth raising alarm because it's alarming e.g. impeachment &amp; coup are two of those.
1330289672799592452 2020-11-22 07:19:08 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @ProjectLincoln It's a coup. Failed or not. Inept or not.   Also, it's about Trump but the GOP.  Anyway, I'm done talking about the obvious.   This is outrageous action and it should be treated like that.
1330287512464592898 2020-11-22 07:10:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @ProjectLincoln Every surrogate, every person who is not a Trump voter or GOP enabler should be pushing on this.  Talking about it. Raising hell about it. Telling everyone they know about it.  But no, let's keep pretending "people know" and "it's ok because it will not succeed"
1330287145353957376 2020-11-22 07:09:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction No, the reason is that it's easier to feel comfortable &amp; laughing about it than feeling the appropriate rage about it.
1330286697096097794 2020-11-22 07:07:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @ProjectLincoln the NT, the ex-republicans, even some "look over here &amp; pretend it's not happening" conservatives types have pushed back.  You have praised people like the Lincoln project as "effective." What are they doing while Dems stay quiet?  But sure, it does not "work."
1330285837704179720 2020-11-22 07:03:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction Crook works because it was repeated, not stop. Dems didn't call Trump a crook when they should have - because he is.   In 2000, part of the reason why Bush won was Brooke Brothers "protest" saying Gore "was trying to subvert the will of the people"
1330283240616325128 2020-11-22 06:53:34 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay @newtonmarunner @SenhorRaposa 2008 financial crisis.  Even Hillary would have won in 2008 - likely to lose, badly in 2012 - as she does not have Obama's political talent.
1330271060177121281 2020-11-22 06:05:10 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction What you call "panic." I say it's the right thing to do-because it is worthy of outrage- but also, politically smart.  Why you think the "word bubble" associated with Hillary was "emails" &amp; "crook"? Even now, after all of Trump's corruption...people don't associate it with him.
1330269775335972876 2020-11-22 06:00:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction Why shouldn't Dems be alarming indifferent, non-informed Americans -voters and not voters- about a coup?  What's the argument against it?   It's not about "panic" -it about saying "Hey, you playing video games, shopping, etc these GOP people are trying to pull out a coup"
1330268903327600648 2020-11-22 05:56:36 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @Darth_Spurious It's like employees -especially- women who expect to get the notice or  raise by "doing the work"  It would work that way. It does not.  Raising hell should be Dems default position - about corruption, and certainty about trying to pull a coup -it does not matter how ineptly.
1330268105919094785 2020-11-22 05:53:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @KeynesAddiction @Darth_Spurious This is the wrong attitude. Most voters do not pay attention. The "outrage" makes them pay attention.  This is not about Trump. It's about GOP complicity, silence, and enabling. How you are going convinced people that the GOP is doing that if we don't do the "hair in fire" thing?
1329975475247087616 2020-11-21 10:30:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> I would have been an eternal student.  A collector of useless, impractical, money-losing degrees.  Money, just as a tool to acquired knowledge.

1329919352641003520 2020-11-21 06:47:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @drvox We need to practice bragging:  "Gore did the ultimate sacrifice" "Republican always leave America in economic shambles and Dems come in &amp; fix it" "Dems had to beg to get CARE unemployment, stimulus. GOP didn't want to give any of it."  But we don't do that. We think "voters know"
1329912616114810880 2020-11-21 06:20:50 +0800 <IT_not_real> @drvox It's our fault. It's liberals, progressives &amp; Dems' fault.  Why?  Dems act like the people -especially women- who think "doing the work" will get the promotion, a raise, etc. It does NOT.   What works is to brag about how great we are.   Dems need to practice bragging.

1329849687080194048 2020-11-21 02:10:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit It's also something a lot of the white men on the left use...and that will attract them to Carlson.   The vern overlap between "anti-woke" "Bernie bros" and "populists" aka the Greenwald type.
1329848765981736963 2020-11-21 02:07:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit And all the above is something that many, many MAGA voters use in their regular lives...not only in politics but outside politics as well.
1329848460095365121 2020-11-21 02:05:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit Carlson' has the "technique" of:  "You are making me insult you" "I'm going to pretend to be stupid" &amp;  "I'm misogynist, racist asshole...but you cannot call me out on any of it because "I was joking" or "look at my fake confuse face""   All down to high-art.
1329847207701274631 2020-11-21 02:00:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit And Tucker isn't?  Watch his show.
1329846235000279041 2020-11-21 01:57:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit Trump lives in a goldplated massion. Wears make up. Dies his hair orange and whines like a little girl, has never done anything beyond count daddy's money.   So.....
1329845983706943489 2020-11-21 01:56:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit I'm not arguing with you.    You know the psyche of all non-college-educated voters in the Red States and what attracts them.
1329845416196673536 2020-11-21 01:53:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit Tucker can easily get many non-college-educated voters. They read the Daily News, they watch the show...
1329844877027229696 2020-11-21 01:51:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit Kushner is different. Kushner has not been carefully crafting a public image as a populist for years nor in the public eye.   Trump did. Trump kids' did. Tucker did.  Ask me what I think about Haley, Cotton, etc and I would agree with you.
1329844420955447297 2020-11-21 01:49:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RedRedSuit @TWLadyGrey On this, I agree.  I don't see the appeal for someone like him. But Carlson was born rich, he has made a name of himself as a "tv star".... Ego is a mysterious thing, adding "president" may be enough of an allure.  I hope it isn't. Because I'm pretty sure he could win.
1329843799686668288 2020-11-21 01:47:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit Maybe not your father in law...but non-college-educated &amp; younger white males and even non-1st generation latinos?  Pretty good shot at getting those.

1329842250608570368 2020-11-21 01:41:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RedRedSuit I don't understand why you believe this. I'm not saying is a given....but propaganda will always work.  The "non-political Trump voter" bought into Trump's myth because of it.  The same can happen with Tucker. In fact, Tucker is a better fit to the younger (gen X &amp; younger)
1329840291923169280 2020-11-21 01:33:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RedRedSuit Agree. But gross is what they - Trump voters - like.  Tucker lacks the fake "macho/strength" Trump's image but does the "I'm pretending to be confused/dumb" thing that many Trump voters hide behind to avoid any responsibility.  It's really a major &amp; common gimmick with them..
1329800987838541824 2020-11-20 22:57:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> Aka: Be Clinton but without the emails Media story &amp; male.

But the fact Nadler &amp; the green party no only demonized Gore but after, never admit it "we were wrong."It made me realize how idealism can poison &amp; destroy too.
1329643380033290241 2020-11-20 12:31:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica It's the same issue with bleach (Clorox/Lysol, etc) wipes. The wipes are easy to increase production.   The plastic container that it comes in it's the "hard" part to ramp up to meet demand.
1329642812229386246 2020-11-20 12:28:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica Paper toilet for home is done in a "separate" production chain as office toilet paper. Switching over is not easy.  Households are not just "hoarding" but consuming more toilet paper because they are staying at home, instead of using it at the office.  I read an article about it.

1329634060830867456 2020-11-20 11:53:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @BlDEN2020 2000 was my first, full-on election. It broke my heart &amp; completely transformed how I saw politics.   But I understood - and still do - why Gore chose that path. True institutionalism is a hard habit to break - as it should be.   A cynical view: the best among us, never win.
1329632102862651396 2020-11-20 11:46:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @BlDEN2020 I was angry AND proud of Al Gore.  Angry: We, Dems,  crumpled with barely any push back.  Proud:  I had seen what institutional decay does to countries. It made me proud to be right about Gore; to know that he was a true patriot who loved America more than his ego or ambition.

1329614345978822656 2020-11-20 10:35:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Maybe. I'm less concerned about Trump than about his GOP enablers.   We are at a point, in our crumbling democracy, that either Dems/Biden take a high-risk step of punching back/cutting a limp to our sick democracy**...  **Yes it would have to be a problematic decision...
1329612395992412160 2020-11-20 10:27:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Btw: This is an area where Tucker may have issues even if I have to admit that the:  "I'm pretending to be confused/dumb face" is something that many MAGA voters actively use in their daily lives. So, maybe, that compensates for it.
1329612036494426112 2020-11-20 10:26:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 My sense is that Trump may be "fighting" on Twitter/legal but his vanishing from the public eye is hurting the big "macho" image/myth.
1329606683673255936 2020-11-20 10:05:10 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 They do. But they find themselves in a conundrum. There's a reason why "handpicked" heirs or family members are the pattern in autocracies.   The demagogue holds a cultish following. That's isn't easily broken or vanish. Balancing the line is astonishingly hard.
1329605187292467202 2020-11-20 09:59:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> It's also why - soon - he will start attacking Trump.

Empathy and service to others give us, humans, a sense of purpose and happiness....but often people cannot even grasp that because they have no way of getting to that point.
1329601558678421504 2020-11-20 09:44:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @Aconcernedamer2 @wetzelart Yes, empathy to those close to us  -family, kin, etc. - comes naturally.   The type of empathy you are expecting requires abstraction and actively thinking about it..not the instinctively/reacting type that most humans feel.  Most humans are "Out of sight, out of mind." types.

They are not inherent to humanity. Let's forget over 5,000 years of history and over 315,000 of some form of "humans" walking on earth.
1329596997775486978 2020-11-20 09:26:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DemFromCT @benjaminwittes Processes are implemented by people.   That's always been the flaw.  It's like hacking. Hackers, mostly, hack people not machines.  Blind faith in our institutions, systems, norms, laws, etc - which I confess that I fully shared - is what has taken us to this hellish place.
1329595366442876928 2020-11-20 09:20:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DemFromCT @benjaminwittes I think a lot of pundits suffer from hubris.   I don't believe Trump or GOP will succeed.   But dismissing people's concern when you have been wrong, several times before it's a problem.
1329594233519366146 2020-11-20 09:15:42 +0800 <IT_not_real> @benjaminwittes @DemFromCT Remember all of your praise on Muller? Barr?
1329576870417874945 2020-11-20 08:06:42 +0800 <IT_not_real> @CannotReality @dontlickchalk Curious: Did you tell him you are a liberal?  P.S. I actually endorse this. It's the right thing to do from a moral standpoint but also, it fits our politics.
1329571131297132544 2020-11-20 07:43:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @dontlickchalk Yes, with am "I'm a bleeding heart liberal." remark.  If he does not have a mask. I would add a box to his pile, pay for it, and say "Science, facts, saving lives..."

This is my ideal - and naive - scenario.  2. Government regulation limiting 1A to prevent excess as we are experiencing now.
1329562716026015744 2020-11-20 07:10:28 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Teri_Kanefield @TWLadyGrey Sadly, yes. The 1A is meant for informed &amp; educate people   But when ignorance is the rule then they are two paths:   1. Elites decided to take on an excess of the responsibility by self-regulating:   a) Academia &amp; experts by keeping controversial stuff off the public radar...
1329559241628078080 2020-11-20 06:56:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> @NikkiHaley Oh, we reached "I'll pretend to be concern about the deficit" after pushing &amp; approving 2T in deficit spending - **before coronavirus** -  under the Trump administration from which you were part?" part of the script.   Let's see how many in the Media will pretend to believe you.
1329558468781502464 2020-11-20 06:53:35 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TCFKA_NCSteve It's the same with autocracy vs dictatorship.  Who cares if autocracy is more accurate if 60% of Americans - generously - don't know what it means and would have to google it?   USe Dictactor.
1329557955562205187 2020-11-20 06:51:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> Or maybe that's the problem?   Finding any "charm" in getting away with stuff and the "nerdy" "follow the rules" types boring, annoying killjoys?
1329557291566174209 2020-11-20 06:48:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> "So it often goes with Trump Guys, whose capers might be charming if they were, say, trying to steal the rival football team's mascot rather than running the government or trying to usher the country through a deadly pandemic."   https://t.co/39TOOaA2GR
1329553523969650688 2020-11-20 06:33:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> I'm going to use "well-actshully pedant"   The obsession on the left with using exactly the right word -the ones that fit historically, semantically, etc- renders us incapable of actually delivering a message.

1329543744329117701 2020-11-20 05:55:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jaketapper Well, at least, I'm already in a foul mood.  Cannot get worse.
1329528793761869825 2020-11-20 04:55:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ForTheRuleOfLaw @BillKristol Also, Hugo Chavez was a Latin American version of Trump. A rabble-rouser clown - ok, maybe marginally smarter but not by much.  If you are going to pick a dead person, at least, pick a smarter one like Fidel or Che or pick an alive, retired ones like Jiang Zemin or Raul Castro.
1329519156664758273 2020-11-20 04:17:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> I scream too.

It would be funny...if it didn't mean that every Fox watcher will believe.  It will be all over Facebook &amp; youtube and millions more will believe it too.
1329489668631531521 2020-11-20 02:20:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SouthPoint1000 @DanRather possible.  No, it won't be enough to counter the Fox/Right-wing propaganda that's convincing Trump voters of "fraud"  But it needs to be done as a pressure campaign to the Media so stop treating it like a joke, and to convey the danger to few Americans paying attention.
1329488970770640898 2020-11-20 02:17:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SouthPoint1000 @DanRather This why is annoying exasperating to listen to Dem MoC &amp; Senators - moderates &amp; far-left - fighting each other instead of focusing on the enemy.  They should be out there yelling to every elected GOP "democracy thieves" "auto-golpe enablers" and every other incendiary thing....
1329488361216643072 2020-11-20 02:15:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SouthPoint1000 @DanRather Yes.  What you are witnessing is the complete bananization of the US  of the United States of America - as a "best-case scenario"- and a full attempt of autocratic power.   Dems will need to win beyond the "cheating margin" at every election - on every level.

Or Tucker Carlson's "uncivil" protesting at his home?   None of them can even bring themselves to admit that the GOP is enabling &amp; quietly supporting an attempted coup &amp; destruction of America's democracy.
1329452686215946243 2020-11-19 23:53:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Jesseabe @joshchafetz People react to peer pressure.   Peer pressure for GOP elected leaders are not "Trump supporters" but CEO's, Media, academia, think tanks, etc. That's who they respect and from whom they want to be accepted.   Sadly none of the above will "shun" or ostracized anyone from the GOP.
1329443847479455744 2020-11-19 23:18:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> Better spend time on the important stuff!!
1329443487322955776 2020-11-19 23:16:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> We, Dems, Liberals, Progressives, etc are way too busy doing the important work of fighting between ourselves.  Why have a unified, constant, relentless message of how Trump &amp; GOP are trying to steal an election &amp; America's democracy? Pushing the Media to report the truth? Nah.
1329254795757068289 2020-11-19 10:46:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> America suffering from chronically "poorly improvised systems" in every aspect: politically, economically, socially &amp; constitutionally.   Systems hand strung by ideology, constantly ignoring practical realities &amp; human behavior. It will be the reason for our downfall.

1329186054432190465 2020-11-19 06:13:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @LarryMishel I think Biden repeating "unions. unions. unions" it's actually a good thing.
1329182533175558145 2020-11-19 05:59:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Noahpinion @bopinion The stimulus would be small, relative to what's needed &amp; could be done.   However, I don't think that Biden will have many options if he's reduced to use the executive power.

1328931953844903936 2020-11-18 13:24:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> This right here.  "... building a blueprint for how they actually can pull it off with a competent version of Trump in the future."
1328930607926272000 2020-11-18 13:18:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> @costareports So, Mr. Costa, why isn't the headline actually informing the public? Why isn't it:  "GOP looks for ways to subvert people's votes" "GOP searches for ways to topple America's democracy" "GOP tries &amp; fails to steal election"  @washingtonpost @PostBaron @costareports   Any would do.
1328879319439970304 2020-11-18 09:54:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> No.   They settled by becoming politicians but really all of them wanted to be celebrities.
1328853892667297795 2020-11-18 08:13:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> @MagnificoIX @Noahpinion That may be a good choice for the future. But student debt canceled when the economy needs a boost is also, a good way to do a stimulus without needing McConnell's or GOP votes.  It's also an immediate benefit for a large share of people who may vote in 2022.
1328852635676381186 2020-11-18 08:08:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> This. That's part of our social contract.  Just because X doesn't benefit YOU ...it does not mean it should not exist.
1328852262534356997 2020-11-18 08:07:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> I made pragmatic choices that meant that my debt was minimal because I didn't have a safety net of any kind. It was the right choice, for me.  I think free college is a good thing. Also, student debt is good &amp; cancelation right now would be a good stimulus &amp; the right policy.
1328847407509979137 2020-11-18 07:48:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @Kasparov63 Easy: take pictures of PDB. Sell it to the highest bidder.

1328838445003730945 2020-11-18 07:12:28 +0800 <IT_not_real> @LarrySabato @NormOrnstein Voters rewarded the cowardice, the treason, the corruption.  So that, us Americans.
1328803294588796929 2020-11-18 04:52:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @snowmanomics That's what Graham's voters want.  He's responding to the incentives on the ground.
1328802909882961920 2020-11-18 04:51:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @snowmanomics Meaning that those of us who aren't in politics hate on politicians because they act on the wrong incentives set up by *their voters*.  Graham just won SC by saying &amp; doing awful things. Why should he stop?  Harris understands that. So, Graham offers a fist-bump, she returned it.
1328801809641598976 2020-11-18 04:46:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @snowmanomics Most politicians don't take politics personally.
1328782540480548864 2020-11-18 03:30:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog The main problem that we, Americans, don't talk about is that we are limited to "tape over the holes" because we have no way to overhaul systems that don't work.   So we have to work within the flawed structure to find "improvements" to the current system.
1328781932000276481 2020-11-18 03:27:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog Daycare is a huge issue - as it's family leave, universal PreK, etc. I was focused on student debt &amp; college but to be honest, my personal obsession is prek12.   In fact, I like Harris' workaround by extending afterschool programs, again, as a "temporary fix"
1328781359955906561 2020-11-18 03:25:38 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog The more prestigious ones do have higher entry-level standards &amp; in fact, are often even more sought out than private universities.
1328781302489772032 2020-11-18 03:25:24 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog The correct answer is to fix prek12 so people can pass the entry exams &amp; meet standards.   In my experience, in Europe where the system seems to work, they are different "levels" of public state universities.
1328780278798532609 2020-11-18 03:21:20 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog No only. Also, the lack of competitive salaries is an issue.  Potentially high-quality teachers often choose other careers - even if they may be emotionally inclined to be teachers - because "You get student debt, and then income is not even that high."
1328772362334965760 2020-11-18 02:49:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @murshedz @whstancil @JoeBiden @TeamJoe SCOTUS is off the table. We don't have the votes.  If we win one GA senate, at least, something that could be done at the federal district level, to balance &amp; act as a "bottleneck" against all conservatives in the judicial, is to add much-needed seats with an "efficiency" excuse
1328771739489210368 2020-11-18 02:47:24 +0800 <IT_not_real> @murshedz @whstancil @JoeBiden I will give @JoeBiden @TeamJoe the benefit of the doubt and say is a case of "keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."   Especially if the intention is to expand federal district courts and fill posts - which is something that Biden's has talked about it.
1328764075807965185 2020-11-18 02:16:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Noahpinion I propose stoicism &amp; going back to basics. Education is not a consumer product and universities should not cater to students.   Universities should be about learning, debates, and professors. Not fancy dooms, gyms, "experiences", etc.
1328763502652137473 2020-11-18 02:14:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Chris_arnade You have said that "back-rows" don't value education or knowledge but other things like "community, family, religion" so you actually agree with Obama that people don't seek knowledge or facts on the internet.....
1328755280381763585 2020-11-18 01:42:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica LOL.   It builds character.
1328745214282874880 2020-11-18 01:02:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog It also goes to the core of "what's a public good or has enough negative externalities" that the government needs to intervene in the marketplace.  A question, that imo, we don't ask ourselves as Americans.
1328744638866329602 2020-11-18 00:59:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog Also, teachers who work in prek12 public schools.   This is the challenge with reforming. This is why some European/Asian system "work better" - like public schools.  All parts are fit - highly educated teachers can afford to work at public schools because of no debt, etc.
1328743420769157120 2020-11-18 00:54:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog I do agree that graduate school should not be free... with a few exceptions: Nursing, doctors, etc - if you are going expand to "universal healthcare" we will more healthcare professionals.   Maybe lawyers who commit to becoming public defenders for X amount of time.
1328715830419365888 2020-11-17 23:05:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog Costs in the USA skyrocket because college &amp; universities focus too much on fancy dorms, gyms, state of the art "fun" facilities, etc.  There's something about just a professor, a shabby classroom where you just go sit, listen, debate, learn. But I have a stoic nature, so...🤷‍♀️
1328714034720497665 2020-11-17 22:58:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog How do you make college more accessible without devaluating the worth of a college education?  I'm not an expert but I think removing entry barriers is not a good solution.   There's a reason why in countries where tuition is free there always entry exams and standards.
1328710830775431170 2020-11-17 22:45:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog Most upper-middle-class in the USA want to go to private/Ivy league ones. No public state universities. I think "free tuition" should be only for public state universities.  I agree with you there's a huge class dynamic - but that's already happening, here.
1328710387957522432 2020-11-17 22:43:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @tcataog No. But devaluing a college education isn't ideal.  I know countries where tuition is free. There are not standards to entry so what happens is that people who graduate from those universities just have a paper.  Only private universities without free tuition as considered real.
1328537102879899648 2020-11-17 11:15:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @ssamcham @ProjectLincoln It seems like even the eternally optimistic "nice guy" Obama is starting to agree with me, on this.
1328536678131068928 2020-11-17 11:13:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> @tcataog @jeffbruce35 I very strongly disagree with this.  I think the government should make college free but demand higher standards for admission in Public State universities.   Community college could serve as that "bridge" for those who need remedial from our inept prek12. It should also be free.
1328535315116527618 2020-11-17 11:07:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @ssamcham @ProjectLincoln It NOT only them.
1328535008483524609 2020-11-17 11:06:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @ssamcham @ProjectLincoln It's only them.  Humans react to incentives and punishment. Remove those and you get chaos.   That's why corruption is like a highly destructive form of "civilization coronavirus" - silent, deadly and once it spreads it cannot be stopped.
1328533959383236609 2020-11-17 11:02:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @ssamcham @ProjectLincoln It's about incentives.   I bet if Media stop inviting Miller, Bolton, and all the other liars to their shows, social gatherings, events, etc ....suddenly they would feel less inclined to blatantly lie.  Why should anyone stop if they are not paying any negative consequences?
1328532062467284992 2020-11-17 10:55:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> The only ones who stop it are professional elites holding our colleagues to higher standards and actively shunning them when they fail.   I don't think it will be done. But it would extremely effective.
1328532061628448769 2020-11-17 10:55:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> We are currently living in a period where all the incentives are out of line.  People get rewarded with fame &amp; money, and by lying, grifting. and acting in anti-ethical ways - many of those over the line to illegal corruption.
1328532060797947906 2020-11-17 10:55:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> not to slide into an outright inquisition.  However, the other side is that the only way humans tame their darkness within us is when the right incentives &amp; punishments.  We don't do what's right because of right. Most of us do it because we fear the consequences.
1328509756361695232 2020-11-17 09:26:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> @dsrotj @chrislhayes But it will not read that.   Rules only apply to Dems.

Most left for economic reasons, not ideology.  However, dictators eat at people's moral core and corrupt everything they touch. It's NOT about ideology.   It's about power and how they yield it.
1328458644355104769 2020-11-17 06:03:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica @RBidenism @MzSailiante @SultanBush 1. Batista was a Dictator.  2. Cubans, who left in 1st wave, were indeed rich -many but not the majority- were Batista's supporters. Because that's what you do under Dictators to succeed.   3. Nobody - rich or poor or middle class- deserve to live under a dictator, left or right.
1328452050447843329 2020-11-17 05:37:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> Why are we liberals, progressive, and Dems - and college-educated people - obsessed about making people's motivation one thing?  Yes, it's a grift. Also, Trump's ego. Also, prep to launch campaign/media in 2021. Also, victimization to fed the base.  It's not one thing.
1328404596222427137 2020-11-17 02:28:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay Removes a small part of the resentment - not all as many people will still not want the trade school nor want the grant for 1st-time small business.  But harder to make the argument.  It will serve as a basic Keynes stimulus - so a good time to do it.
1328403491300069382 2020-11-17 02:24:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay If Biden does Student loan forgiveness it should be paired with: 1) Free Trade/Tech school, retraining for non-college students same amount, or 2) Grants for small start 1st time small business for same amount - with requirements for basic biz training.   Same day announcement.
1328396714152136704 2020-11-17 01:57:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> Endorse.
1328393781691858945 2020-11-17 01:45:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> Humanity has experienced decades, even generations of despair, obscurity, reactionary rejection of progress, over &amp; over.  I think accepting that's even more pessimistic than even I'm willing to indulge - and I am the ultimate pessimist.
1328393780798447622 2020-11-17 01:45:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> We can hold on to our naivete - a bit like Obama does - and take the long view and say: What does it matter if the American experiment fails?   Other great things have failed - from Mongolia to Mayans to Rome. But that is not an optimistic point of view.
1328393779963777024 2020-11-17 01:45:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> Idealism makes us cringe from the very idea of putting limits to the 1A. But the 1A works if we all lived under the same social contract - where logic, facts, the shared meaning for interaction.   If that does exist, it corrodes the very basic foundation of society.

1328393778206449664 2020-11-17 01:45:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> it was a ridiculous, overblown &amp; defensive quote. I was sure that Hillary was wrong.  I soon realized that Hillary was mostly right. It was not personal - as she implied.    But it was a deliberated &amp; organized effort to insert conspiracy into America's mindset to a degree not..
1328393777325621248 2020-11-17 01:45:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> Obama's naivete took a significant beat down. I found myself "nodding" in agreement to most o the interview.   I have a fuzzy recollection of Hillary's 1995's "vast right-wing conspiracy" quote.  I was barely a teen. As such, I was naive &amp; idealistic and believed...
1328393776428056577 2020-11-17 01:45:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> I distrust "idolization", in general.   I like Obama. But never felt that bright-eyed sway. Not even in 2008. And yes, I did, constantly find Obama naive - and I prefer cynical politicians to naive ones.  But I read this interview, and even if he will not admit it...
1328393774691586048 2020-11-17 01:45:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> Warning for incoherent musings:  I never was an Obama fan. I never felt the rush of emotion &amp; idealization and the sense that "oh wow" that a lot of people - from average to highly educated- feel at Obama.   Maybe it's because of my natural distrust of "charisma" or because.....

To be cruel.   "You are free to choose death for you &amp; your family. Do not complain if that choice comes knocking at your door or expect compassion."
1328353438430756864 2020-11-16 23:05:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> @JRubinBlogger @RonBrownstein Why is Bolton on tv? That's the problem. Incentives.  GOP Senators, consultants, etc have NO incentive to do what's right because they paid no negative price for choosing selfish, unpatriotic, lying behavior.  On the contrary, they make 💰off of it.  Humans react to incentives.
1328339697806888960 2020-11-16 22:10:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> This so much.  A sense that you are stuck in your "class" no matter what you do, is at the core of many weak democracies/failed states.   If you feel like the system is against you...what incentive you have to preserve that system?
1328086041710845952 2020-11-16 05:22:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Teri_Kanefield It's also why Latinos in other states - like Texas and Florida - have are still inclined to vote for Republicans while they aren't in California or Arizona.
1328085781869596672 2020-11-16 05:21:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Teri_Kanefield One of the biggest reasons why CA turned Blue is because Republicans turned off Latino voters by introducing "show your papers" laws that antagonize Latinos and bring race issues into focus.  It's the same reaction that Latinos in Arizona had with Arpaio.
1327724289768845313 2020-11-15 05:25:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SER1897 @TheStagmania Because Republicans control the narrative!!  They control the narrative because of the synergy between Fox/Right-wing media &amp; GOP.   Agree, Dems suck at messaging.   But you cannot underestimate the power of the megaphone of propaganda from the right.
1327652817805352966 2020-11-15 00:41:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> This a major asymmetry that liberals don't really grasp.   For  Republicans, all their lives are saturated by politics. That's why they talk about "the cost of speaking out." and they lose by doing it.  Liberals, Dems, Progressives, don't experience that.
1327651746907185152 2020-11-15 00:36:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> Dems have to specifically seek out political meetings.  Try to talk politics in at yoga, or cooking club, or any non-political environment, and you will get the very liberal reaction:  "This is a safe space where everyone is welcome. We don't discuss controversial issues."
1327651746106146816 2020-11-15 00:36:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> This truth from the bottom up.   Republicans get their political message amplified everywhere they go: church, social clubs, business associations, Fox/ Radio, Facebook, youtube.  Dems don't.
1327651745258905600 2020-11-15 00:36:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> We, Dems/Progressives/Liberals, are preaching to high info voters &amp; the college-educated who are "somehow informed" and those people are already voting for us!   We are no able to reach anyone else - and paid media does not have the same power.
1327651744097071108 2020-11-15 00:36:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> This. It's like saying "Trump/GOP spend less money than Dems."  If you have a 24/7 channel dedicated to spreading your message, defend your candidate &amp; positions...how much is that worth?   Dems don't have a "no effective capacity for disseminating their message to the public."
1327647980577406976 2020-11-15 00:21:59 +0800 <IT_not_real> Endorse. Hate it but it's real.
1327642439398559751 2020-11-14 23:59:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @HeerJeet I fully support Alito, Clarence Thomas, Kavanaugh, Roberts, etc defying all masks wearing mandates and social distance, go partying, and mingle with people every day!

Let's treat MTG as "representing the GOP" Let's elevate her. Let's say "the GOP will be dominated by MTG, Steve King and proud boys." Let's repeat over &amp; over MTG, Proud Boys represent the Republican party....  Just like R's do with the "squad"
1327641129538338816 2020-11-14 23:54:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Meko4403 @Empr4evr @RonGOPVet4Biden @mtgreenee @AOC Ah yes, she is a moron and we, Dems, are above engaging with morons and tying every GOP.    We didn't do with Steve King and when won't do it with MTG.  But R's keep doing... they have from Waters to Hillary to Nancy to AOC.   Why not give it a shot?
1327640065435082753 2020-11-14 23:50:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> @madrid_mike @ProjectLincoln E.g. Sarah Sanders and the vehement demands for "civility" because she was asked to leave a restaurant.   Or the Media rush to defend Carlson after his white supremacist because people protest in front of his house.  Or Media inviting liars like Miller over&amp; over to their show.
1327638397112860673 2020-11-14 23:43:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @madrid_mike @ProjectLincoln I admired you, Mr. Madrid. But I think you're naive about this.  They behave this way -from Trump &amp; family to the lowest lackey -because there are no adverse results.  They are embraced by colleagues, the Media, and yes, by their "social circle." They will go back &amp; pay no price.
1327630373182836736 2020-11-14 23:12:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> Agree.   Where are @ReverendWarnock &amp; @ossoff ads about Loefter &amp; Perdue tying them to @mtgreenee to the proud boys? to the white supremacists?
1327628975695220737 2020-11-14 23:06:28 +0800 <IT_not_real> The CEO's who chose crony capitalism over America.
1327628717300957184 2020-11-14 23:05:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> Why did some GOP Senators start admitting Trump lost? Here's your answer.   70 million MAGA racists, misogynists, etc. voted for Trump/GOP...  But these CEO, who always had the power to stop him, choose crony capitalism &amp; greed over America.  I will never forgive or forget.
1327480754939387904 2020-11-14 13:17:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> The reason for my despondency.
1327338556876935169 2020-11-14 03:52:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ccaajj @djrothkopf Many parts of "blue America" are agricultural centers. Mainly California but also, many towns in other states that have kept production "artisanal" and that may have an incentive to expand.  Also, in a global market, you can buy from any country in the world...as we already do.
1327334032326094848 2020-11-14 03:34:28 +0800 <IT_not_real> @lindsaywise @gtconway3d "It is part mea culpa, part self-help guide and part road map toward a libertarian America"  All the above is bullshit until "libertarian America" is erased from billionaires' vocabulary &amp; mindset.
1327065715644329984 2020-11-13 09:48:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @KatMeanJean I was 7 years old. Religion felt egocentric - why should it care about me and not the other person? - as illogical as fairy tales, and finally, if that old testament God was real...  Well, that God seemed petty, quick to tantrum, and not a role model that would like to follow.
1326709970042171392 2020-11-12 10:14:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @benshapiro Would it better if Harris' husband stayed in his law firm, representing clients while married to America's VP?  Kinda, like Ivanka, Jared, Don Jr, Eric &amp; Trump did with Trump, Inc? Where they put their business interest in the same table as America's?  See: China, UEA, MBS, etc.
1326661083780706304 2020-11-12 07:00:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Jackasaurus3 @mkraju @wolfblitzer WI - Ron Jonhson.  PA - Toomey NC - Tillis &amp; Burr ME - Collins Louisiana - Kennedy &amp; Cassidy Kansas - Moran &amp; Roberts  Problem? GOP Senators want to be taken care of by GOP donors/lobbying after "retiring."  None would accept a position in Biden's cabinet
1326657487030820865 2020-11-12 06:46:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> Correct.  Politicians don't control activists. Activists don't control politicians.  However, you have to decide: Are you a politician or an activist? If you are a politician then you wash the dirty clothes at home. Talk to MoC &amp; focus on work.  If not, quit &amp; become an activist.
1326634200837992449 2020-11-12 05:13:35 +0800 <IT_not_real> This.   Trump = incompetent at governing, business management, reading, etc.  Trump extremely competent at: manipulation, marketing, propaganda, and "getting away with bullshit" - legal, borderline illegal &amp; absolutely illegal.

He may turn to terrorism or continue down the path of asymmetrical warfare - cyberwar. And that may push the USA to escalate it to a traditional means...but he won't start it.  China, on the other hand....
1326577476579942400 2020-11-12 01:28:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @davidfrum Seniors -had active, busy lives - find themselves, thanks to modern medicine, feeling like they are 40's but with "slowdown" lives that do not reflect that.  It's harrowing and leads to a constant search for something to fill the void. Often that void is drama, conspiracies, etc.
1326576895618551809 2020-11-12 01:25:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @davidfrum I think people often dismiss how longer lifespans, fill sometimes without a lot of loneliness - lack of friendships, relationships, hobbies, and pile-on by retirement and health issues - contribute to our current situation.
1326527910828601344 2020-11-11 22:11:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Teri_Kanefield @TWLadyGrey 2. Force every elected GOP person to answer: Do recognize president-elect Biden or you support this attempt?  Take the narrative away &amp; bombarded with reality.   Kinda like what happened with coronavirus.
1326527481759715330 2020-11-11 22:09:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Teri_Kanefield @TWLadyGrey Exactly. The way to push back today is not marching but for every Dem, Progressive &amp; liberal to flood the Media &amp; GOP elected officials with 2 questions:  1. Stop euphemisms. Call what Trump/McConnell &amp; GOP is doing what is: An attempt to steal the election.
1326378655321370628 2020-11-11 12:18:09 +0800 <IT_not_real> Run in right wing radio &amp; Facebook.
1326378395157082119 2020-11-11 12:17:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> That's what I would if I was a GA Liberal  PAC   Does @Perdue need a safe space? Is he's too weak to debate @ossoff .. how can he defend your interests? Well, maybe if he ask his elite, yankee friends and donors "pretty please" they would say yes....
1326368915384102914 2020-11-11 11:39:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> Toddlers don't deserve to be denigrated and compared to Trump.

The GOP &amp; Trump who are trying to either steal the election - worst-case - delegitimize Biden &amp; kneecap his administration before it begins.  That's who we, Dems, should be fighting...but nop, we keep looking at our navel, mesmerized by it.
1326352063660355584 2020-11-11 10:32:29 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Often the noise is announcing &amp; preceding the threat.

Call it what it is. An illegitimate, immoral &amp; cynical attempt of stealing an election and destroy America's democracy. 2. Push them into asking GOP people, directly without euphemist and on-air if they support it.
1326351159687221248 2020-11-11 10:28:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Sometimes I get this mental image of us, trying to protect our body, while the bully is hitting us nonstop.... and we are preoccupied trying to psychoanalyze the bully in between each slap.  "Did you have a tough childhood? What happen to you"? Talk to me...!" it's ridiculous.
1326348240824856576 2020-11-11 10:17:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @Misteriso61 @Teri_Kanefield @AshaRangappa_ @MuellerSheWrote I prefer to come off as a pessimistic alarmist - and yes, I want people to panic enough to fight back - than this "let's be reasonable &amp;  try to understand what are they doing" this....while the other side is hitting us.  We can analyze it after we stop them. Not before.
1326347654935146496 2020-11-11 10:14:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @Misteriso61 @Teri_Kanefield @AshaRangappa_ @MuellerSheWrote Agree with this 100%.  Other countries have failed not for lack of strength or righteousness or apathy or something fundamentally wrong with any of them.   They have failed because fighting authoritarians is f*c*ing exhausting, hard, and like trying to catch "smoke."
1326338113447227396 2020-11-11 09:37:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @Misteriso61 @Teri_Kanefield @AshaRangappa_ @MuellerSheWrote BTW this why foreign leaders are loudly &amp; publicly congratulating Biden. It's also why Merkel gave that speech.  It's their way to help shut down the "stolen election" nonsense.   We, as Americans, should do the same. Force people to congratulate Biden or confront them.

Are you Ted Cruz trying to steal an election?  Are you (GOP Senator) trying to steal an election?  No euphemisms.
1326322248811122693 2020-11-11 08:34:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @Misteriso61 @Teri_Kanefield @AshaRangappa_ @MuellerSheWrote And you think that's an acceptable number out of 53?   In the United States of America the "beacon of democracy"?
1326320712282329089 2020-11-11 08:27:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> Oh, good. GOP donors &amp; the corporate world called Senator Toomey.  GOP donors/Billionaires call McConnell.   Remind them who paid them.  An United States of America in the midst of a coup -or whatever you want to call it - is not good for business.  That includes GLOBAL business.

Is the GOP saying that Trump didn't win?  Is GOP Majority Leader of the Senate saying Trump didn't win &amp; should just steal it? Are GOP Senators saying that Trump didn't win&amp; would just steal it?  That's what they all saying that Trump "won"

That's a Hollywood version of a coup. Not even when it used to happen - before the '60s. Was it widespread or like people imagine it.  Most people never felt any difference &amp; just "live"

Autocrats change the laws to fit their agenda &amp; consolidate power. They corrupt those in power or fire them -harassing them into silence with violence &amp; "law"  They change the constitution.  That's how it's done, everywhere.

1326301273214210049 2020-11-11 07:10:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @PamKeithFL The attitude is: "It will not work so we will ignore it"  The attitude should be:  "It's likely that it will not work. But we will deal with it like a serious threat, inform Americans what's this attempt is trying to do and work to push back so to make sure it does NOT work."
1326299685959528448 2020-11-11 07:04:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @PamKeithFL Dismissing the power of the weak leads to hubris.   It what led us, America, the "greatest power in the world" into this very moment.   It opened the door to Putin, foreign interference, disinformation &amp; Trump.
1326298747173662720 2020-11-11 07:00:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @PamKeithFL then you move on to next &amp; the next.  Governing &amp; building are different. There are limited ways to do it and you hurt yourself if you don't have a sound strategy.  That's also the power of "weakness" &amp; "nothing to lose."
1326298118749478913 2020-11-11 06:58:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @PamKeithFL The asymmetry of destruction &amp; obstruction against governing &amp; building is always the same.  Obstruction &amp; destruction can use any "strategy" as if you "fail" at least, you sow chaos, delay, etc. You throw things, again &amp; again...push, hard. If you cannot get away with it...
1326297384586866689 2020-11-11 06:55:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @PamKeithFL  https://t.co/eXbYo8OmkR
1326297207901835265 2020-11-11 06:54:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica @david_darmofal @KildayMorgan @LaurenUnderwood That's part of current age politics. Sadly.  My preferred politicians are quiet, boring &amp; nerdy types focus on work.  But that has never been popular...and it certainly even less so, in the age of Tik Tok &amp; SM.
1326296330470256641 2020-11-11 06:51:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @PamKeithFL It depends if you ask others and they are not following orders.  Sometimes you "hire" the people you can get...not the ones you want.
1326295616624881667 2020-11-11 06:48:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @PamKeithFL Would put Trump in charge of one?
1326280185214218241 2020-11-11 05:46:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ContentedIndie People are new to politics don't understand that they are certain figures that fit a state for quirky reasons.   Tester, Sherrod, Machin are an example.   It's not endless. They will eventually succumb to demo &amp; political gravity...but they defy it for longer than others could.
1326271379264647168 2020-11-11 05:11:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> Not a coincidence that she talks about Nazi Germany.  Not a fluke that she talks about the important role that America plays in all fields -moral, economic, and military.  Not a fluke that she talks about democracy.  Everyone is begging us to shake ourselves out of the craziness.
1326257271756652549 2020-11-11 04:15:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey So, the fact it may or may not work is irrelevant.   It's eroding democracy and institutional legimatacy.   And it may not "work" this time....but it's preparing the soil it does work in the future.
1326256892180492289 2020-11-11 04:14:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey It shouldn't even be a question. The probability should be &lt;0%.   The fact that we are discussing is not "panic."  It's because people - not "random people" but people in power: GOP Senate Majority Leader, DOJ, Secretary of State, GOP Senators and Congressmen are pushing for it.
1326255402141413376 2020-11-11 04:08:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey  https://t.co/VtyMvhTXbj
1326215365668478977 2020-11-11 01:29:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> The moment you try to "educate" you lose people.   The moment you talk their language and listen to what they want and promise to deliver...you win them over.   And not, people in WV don't want the same as people in NYC.
1326215016614277120 2020-11-11 01:27:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> I agree that DNC should invest in the electorate - registration &amp; talking their language - not candidates - like Stacy Adams.  That's not the argument of the far-left, at least, that's not how I understand it. The argument on the far-left is that we should "educated on policy"
1326166605173190657 2020-11-10 22:15:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> Marketing is a thing @TeamJoe needs to learn from Trump.  People never accept what the USA gov. does for them...not even they receive DIRECT aid.  Until the USA gov. send a letter saying "you received X amount from us" the GOP can keep selling the BS that gov. is the problem.
1325959827399471105 2020-11-10 08:33:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> "It's not happening if we call it by another name"  rule.
1325930491594240001 2020-11-10 06:37:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> People still do not get or want to accept a simple fact:  It does NOT matter if something is a lie or irrational.  What matters is more basic: Will people believe or pretend to believe or give it room to "debated"?  Spreading doubt to break the system is the goal.
1325914967153930240 2020-11-10 05:35:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is why I'm unable to celebrate. This is why I'm not optimistic.  I hoped to see a tiny speck of light a the end of the tunnel.  The tunnel just got longer.
1325872304891469824 2020-11-10 02:46:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @AshaRangappa_ No.
1325859606443167746 2020-11-10 01:55:38 +0800 <IT_not_real> Today I donate @ossoff  Again, it's a long, long shot. Still, we have to keep trying.  Dems always stop at the presidency, and as we have seen SCOTUS and Senate often matter more.
1325859091122593794 2020-11-10 01:53:35 +0800 <IT_not_real> Today I donate @ReverendWarnock   It's a long shot - harder than Biden. But we still have to try.
1325678246126444545 2020-11-09 13:54:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mattyglesias P.S. People underestimate how essential was integration in the military to civil rights. It left a psychological mark that push unwilling Americans in 60's.  I don't proposed a return to a military draft. But a mandatory national service either military or civilian would useful.
1325677300503912455 2020-11-09 13:51:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mattyglesias I have this idea but for ordinary Americans. Done thru a mandatory national service- civil or military.  Take blue liberals to Red dots for 6-12 months. And Red conservatives to blue dots. Let them the ups &amp; downs.
1325675937623543808 2020-11-09 13:45:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> Lol
1325675586891575296 2020-11-09 13:44:24 +0800 <IT_not_real> 2. People can leave start new business without fear of losing insurance - most likely to succeed are experience, educated workers with families. 3. College is currently filling the holes left by prek12. Fixing this is a generation away. 4. Taxes for everyone need to go up.
1325673465043578881 2020-11-09 13:35:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> This.  We, Americans, keep to fit parts of puzzled that don't  fit together.  Capitalism would more dynamic  a meritocracy more obtainable and increase income/wealth mobility more achievable  if: 1. People would educated thus able to negotiate better wages.
1325652323251597313 2020-11-09 12:11:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> @EarnurHKG @owillis @lauriecrosswell But Trump &amp; GOP had a mandate when they lost the popular vote &amp; only got 77K in 3 States to *win* Electoral College in 2016?
1325651685788676097 2020-11-09 12:09:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> Yes. Also, Biden should repeat this:   "We won the biggest Victory ever not only EC but popular vote. We won 2 Senate seats, seats in house &amp; WH, and flipped traditional GOP states Blue.  We have a mandate from Americans"
1325649720836939776 2020-11-09 12:01:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anatosaurus I don't know how to fix it.   I don't know if it is fixable with people so focus on their ego &amp; navel-gazing that even when they know that they are holding up to nonsense...they keep repeating it.
1325649050725572608 2020-11-09 11:58:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anatosaurus We are obsessed with words &amp; empty public rhetoric to the point that they lose purpose. It all becomes nothing buzzwords &amp; marketing, without any substance.  This is a problem, left (obsession with woke, identify, etc) &amp; right (fear-mongering about socialism, defund the police).
1325640106313543680 2020-11-09 11:23:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom I'm thinking we should frame as the "New G.I. Bill" for anyone who completes public - military or civilian - service.   It feeds into the delusional "The '50s were great" nostalgia and serves the purpose of both student debt forgiveness &amp; "free college."
1325639437502435330 2020-11-09 11:20:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Sorry, you cannot.  We need to fight the VERY uphill - likely impossible- battle of 2 Senate seats in GA.  I'm hoping -against all odds- for a little help from a Trump tantrum. Enough to alienate his base to stay home but not enough to justify GOP-leaning voters to "return home."
1325637076168028161 2020-11-09 11:11:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> Endorse. Plus, insert the word "Christian" &amp;  "patriotism" with any excuse possible in all ads.   "Our patriot &amp; Christians duty is to provide affordable healthcare and give all Americans the freedom to choose a public or private option." Bald eagles, flags, swelling music.
1325186096997695497 2020-11-08 05:19:20 +0800 <IT_not_real> And still, after everything, in 2020...
1324902069606576128 2020-11-07 10:30:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> You guys laugh.  But this works. Nobody is more in love with drama than Trump voters.
1324900305461411840 2020-11-07 10:23:42 +0800 <IT_not_real> I'm convinced that Americans are ideologues, incapable, of taking reality limitations to the ideas that appeal to them. This is truth in right -2A, abortion- and the left- woke, affirmative action, etc.   We cannot have policies that work, limited by facts, until we overcome it.
1324872710191685634 2020-11-07 08:34:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> Also, agree with the obsession of lumping communities that are not alike together because of "race" - aka Latino hurts more than helps.
1324872709424123904 2020-11-07 08:34:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> Agree with @AOC that there also core execution programs in digital - Biden/Dems were not on youtube at all.  Facebook continues to be a problem.  These are facts.
1324872708086091781 2020-11-07 08:34:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> Disagree that messaging things like "defund the police" or "socialism" does not hurt. It does hurt. A lot.   Explaining a slogan means you are not communicating, no matter how you try to justify it.
1324822583947137025 2020-11-07 05:14:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> @nerdlypainter @TWLadyGrey Stop talking in moral terms e.g. Health is a right.   This does *not* appeal to the "no mask because of freedom" &amp; "I want guns without a background check because of freedom." people in Red Staes.  Instead, appeal to people's selfish instincts. DO NOT EDUCATE....use marketing.
1324822120757559296 2020-11-07 05:13:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> @nerdlypainter @TWLadyGrey No, what she's saying is to use marketing.  Instead of M4A. "Liberate your healthcare" or some B.S. like that.   Focus on "So you can leave a job if you get a better offer in another place or start a business and not worry about not having affordable care"
1324791156262100992 2020-11-07 03:09:59 +0800 <IT_not_real> @chrislhayes @RyanLizza If you go to Facebook or youtube to look at DYI video or to see family news and that's the info you get....will it influence voting behavior?  AA communities are less receptive to "outside influence" because of slavery/Jim crow, etc.  Latinos &amp; other minorities are different.
1324789338786291712 2020-11-07 03:02:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> @chrislhayes @RyanLizza If you lived in Rural America- surrounded by conservatives ...and politics comes up during a work break, at the gas station, at church, or at the fishing club, etc.  What perspective are you going to hear?  Liberal or conservative? Will it shape these voters, no matter the race?
1324788475594371072 2020-11-07 02:59:20 +0800 <IT_not_real> @chrislhayes @RyanLizza Low/non-info voters don't obsess about or talk about politics. They don't know about 99% of the things that we - political junkies do.   How do they get their news?  1. Co-workers, family &amp; friends - and any institutions they belong too (church, clubs, etc) 2. Facebook &amp; youtube.
1324787920004292610 2020-11-07 02:57:08 +0800 <IT_not_real> @chrislhayes @RyanLizza Do you believe the environment shapes people's personalities, tastes, inclinations, etc?  We - liberals, progressives, Dems - use that argument every day when talking about crime or children's education. But ignore it when it comes to voting.
1324756802618101761 2020-11-07 00:53:29 +0800 <IT_not_real> @AshaRangappa_ Instead, we keep expecting that GOP would suddenly see the light....  But the GOP will just lay low, lie about how "they always disagree with Trump" pivot to their usual obstruction stances...and if the opportunity arises, find someone worse than Trump but smarter &amp; efficient.
1324755969033711618 2020-11-07 00:50:10 +0800 <IT_not_real> @AshaRangappa_ The problems with Dems/liberals/progressives....we keep expecting this.   Trump is openly bad. GOP is opportunistically bad.  A divided nation cannot stand. But giving multi-chances to people who act in bad faith only results in abuse.  There has to be balance &amp; consequences.
1324748651554463745 2020-11-07 00:21:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> Doing the underappreciated, hard work, AND giving credit/acknowledging others pivotal role.  Some people are just good. Thank you @benwikler
1324570293940092930 2020-11-06 12:32:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @PostFactSojourn We should thank them for praying for Biden's presidency.
1324569840263127040 2020-11-06 12:30:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @staceyabrams  @benwikler  @LinaHidalgoTX  @BetoORourke  @azdemparty  @nvdems   All heroes.   You left it all in the table - win or lose - and worked your ass off.   Thank you.

1324564699275436032 2020-11-06 12:10:08 +0800 <IT_not_real> Any insight on this? @magi_jay
1324564300162244608 2020-11-06 12:08:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> This retweet is an endorsement.  P.S. I'm ignoring both of my grandmas' voices in my head who serve as my decency check.
1324559805655076864 2020-11-06 11:50:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> Also, perfect for a not lighting bolt position that gives Abrams' opportunities to do good for the people and gain connections in D.C. without damaging long-term prospects.
1324559804417806336 2020-11-06 11:50:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> I proposed @staceyabrams for OMB.  That does not sound "sexy" like DOJ or State, etc. But OMB is personnel &amp; budget and it influences every part of the gov. because of personnel + budget = policy.  Her organization, long-term vision, and hard work make her ideal for this job.
1324556371283505153 2020-11-06 11:37:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> I'm buying Fiona Hill's - even if it was garbage - book because she deserves my money.  Also, I'm sure is brilliant.
1324556002734219264 2020-11-06 11:35:34 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Amy_Siskind @ManMet80 The parameters are Trump + suspense - ratings, aka "We are not ready to give Trump up yet."
1324554262743973888 2020-11-06 11:28:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is correct.
1324546545828597760 2020-11-06 10:58:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @HurdOnTheHill You voted against impeachment when you knew Trump was guilty.  You are complicity of this.  Own it.
1324513972578525184 2020-11-06 08:48:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Somebody I wish dipped into how irrationality drives so much of the behavior in the "Trump voter" - not exclusively, I see on the left - is @RadioFreeTom   He's clear-eyed, emphatic but not coddling. It would a nice way to frame people's dismissal of "expertise" &amp;  hate "elites".
1324510917938180096 2020-11-06 08:36:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Agree. I come from a liberal, hyper-educated, urban bubble. That was my "natural" setting.   That's not longer my reality, due to health/life stuff, and I was initially shocked by the difference....and I'm still learning how to see this almost alien world.
1324510122970787840 2020-11-06 08:33:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @anacaprana @SamanthaJPower When people say things like: "Black people are saving democracy" ask yourself why?
1324510082428645376 2020-11-06 08:33:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @anacaprana @SamanthaJPower It grounds people's perspective on history &amp; cold-hearted realism. Idealism is a luxury of the privileged.   Americans, even AA, have enjoyed some of it.  But AA has been one of those not have that luxury for long in America.
1324509205919793152 2020-11-06 08:29:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @anacaprana @SamanthaJPower We, Americans, want to "protect children's innocence" &amp; be "children"  A key difference between AA families and others? AA families don't do this. They talk about the bad stuff, the struggles, the history. It may sound harsh...but I firmly believe it's good....
1324508495022993408 2020-11-06 08:26:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 It's *not* only politics but day to day, life stuff gets dismiss.  I think Trump gave people "permission" to be even more irrational than usual. Or maybe the irrationality was what carried us to this place. Idk.  Interesting to see how things "change" for better or worse.
1324507653125668866 2020-11-06 08:23:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 I want to ask a favor, as a fellow Dem living in a Red dot, to observe people's behavior, tone, language, clothing, etc.  I have always been puzzled by humans' irrationality.   But since '16, I have seen it, grow exponentially -this is anecdotal &amp; likely emotional observation....
1324482534634188800 2020-11-06 06:43:38 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anacaprana @SamanthaJPower Well, I'll be damned to admit it but this is real and a positive of Trump's awfulness.   I would say 10% of people have become slightly more aware of how government works, how elections are conducted, etc.   Many are still misinformed but it's way better than before.
1324470181742063616 2020-11-06 05:54:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @unsettlingmist @mjs_DC It's also a service towards Red America.  The disparity in education &amp; standards of living would dramatically improve if politically-minded liberals actually moved to these Red states &amp; helped elect people who want to help others, in school boards, local elections, etc.
1324453846173691905 2020-11-06 04:49:38 +0800 <IT_not_real> @KathTX No use language that can be weaponized against us? That's it.   Keep language simple and plain with a raw emotional appeal (fear&gt; hope).   Finally,  ads are not academic or policy papers.   Then govern as we need to govern. Governing is one thing. Winning is another one.
1324451785491148800 2020-11-06 04:41:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TCFKA_NCSteve @csilverandgold You are channeling all my rage. Thank you.  I'm so angry at Americans, that I don't any words.
1324451420561567745 2020-11-06 04:40:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @KathTX Ignore to win elections. Not to govern.   Campaigns are one thing. Governing is another one.  E.g. GOP: "We will protect pre-existent conditions" - campaign.  GOP gov. actions?  Lawsuit to destroy pre-existing conditions law.  Every GOP healthcare plan effectively does the same.
1324448784177225728 2020-11-06 04:29:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is a mistake.   Jayapal is too radical, lacks finesse, and, in fact, has been aggressive in her "anti-establishment" message which hurts Dems.   Both @AyannaPressley and even @AOC are better fitted.
1324447348764798976 2020-11-06 04:23:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mkraju I couldn't do Pelosi or Schumer jobs for any amount of money or power.   It would be hell on earth.
1324447127943049216 2020-11-06 04:22:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> @mkraju Personally, worse's careers involve:  1. Public-eye: No privacy, discussing your life in public, etc. I don't understand celebrities or politicians or even SM influencers.  Why would want that?  2. Managing people: soothing egos, competitive interest, misunderstanding, etc.
1324444752226349056 2020-11-06 04:13:30 +0800 <IT_not_real> @charles_gaba @Redistrict Dems should respond but never do.  "My opponent is funded by these GOP donors (Koch brothers) who got this much (subsidies + how little they paid taxes).  Do you think they will defend your interest or theirs?"  Plain English. No euphemism. Direct attacks - not "corporate donors"
1324416177637007360 2020-11-06 02:19:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> Thank you.  You don't great a marketing campaign based on "nuance"  You do it based on raw emotional appeal and to influence the largest amount of people in the most powerful way possible.   That's it. That's all.   Nuance is for analysis and academic studies. Not marketing.
1324415258262294528 2020-11-06 02:16:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SciSuburb Do they vote on those issues? No.  Generalizations are how marketing campaigns are built.   Yes, there exceptions. You don't create a marketing campaign for the exception... it's created as:   "How we can influence the maximum amount of people for less amount of resources?"
1324414254091395077 2020-11-06 02:12:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SciSuburb @TCFKA_NCSteve Yes, there are people in GOP who care about policy.  GOP donors and the "business" organizations that are behind them.   WWC voters who propelled Trump &amp; GOP senators in 2020 don't.
1324413821125976064 2020-11-06 02:10:36 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SciSuburb @TCFKA_NCSteve Yes, the people who already give a shit and know about policy are already voting for Dems so there's not need to "market" to them.  That's the point.
1324411789963001857 2020-11-06 02:02:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SciSuburb Come on, look how many people thought ACA was different thing than Obamacare!  Please accept reality.
1324411624472506368 2020-11-06 02:01:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SciSuburb To vote on policy, you have to understand policy. This is the problem Dems cannot accept:  1. Voters care about the platitudes. Not policy.  2. To vote on policy you have understand policy. 3. Voters don't want to educated &amp;/or don't have the capacity to understand policy.
1324410656989147137 2020-11-06 01:58:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TCFKA_NCSteve @SciSuburb Exactly. Pro-Life is feel-good marketing: "I'm a great, self-righteous, pious person who cares about children."    They protest abortion centers but are fine if a daughter or a politician they support have an abortion because "it's different."   It's not about policy.
1324409716919787521 2020-11-06 01:54:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SciSuburb Why care about abortion but not care about children in cages?  Why care about children &amp; pedophiles but not care when Trump defends a known pedophile from the White House? Or about sexual abuse cases for Trump or Jordan?   It's about marketing.
1324409114710040576 2020-11-06 01:51:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SciSuburb Abortion is a cultural issue.  Same as Qanon - which explains a lot of Latino voting because live &amp; breathe on Facebook.   Qanon is about "pedophiles" but they don't care when they proven pedophiles that touch their candidates or when Trump defends one.

1324378034162475008 2020-11-05 23:48:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> We are more polarized than in the 1960s because despite all the awfulness of the '60s two things/experiences "united" Americans:  1. American families of all racial, social &amp; economic stripes- experienced the looming cloud of the draft.
1324370330534637575 2020-11-05 23:17:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> @john_sipher It's not.  Voters are irresponsible &amp; uninformed teens who want what they want and get told on Facebook &amp; sub-culture groups across SM that "those evil politicians" are not doing it.  Media equates Dems normal politicians' behavior with GOP anti-democratic, lawless &amp; corruption.
1324182782944313344 2020-11-05 10:52:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> This includes me -self-awareness is good.  I'm furious at what America has allowed herself to become &amp; unable to deal with reality.   I'm a spoiled American brat who took our "imperfect but strong institutions &amp; democracy" for granted, just to discover the foundation was sinking.

MA Dem legislature changes the law to say "Governor shall appoint a politician from the same party as departing Senator"  In my opinion, that should the standard in every state. It's not a person but a party with its platform/ideas who wins an election.

That will inevitably lead to pissing people off - some pretty powerful at the local level.  If you want to have a future in DNC that's not somebody would feel inclined to do.

Are "journalists" so morally vacuum that not even a blatant attempt to steal an election will shake them out of their "both sides" complacency?   Really?
1321862889334976513 2020-10-30 01:14:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> Why aren't the headlines: "GOP suing across America to stop people votes"  @nytpolitics @washingtonpost @BostonGlobe @latimes @MiamiHerald @chicagotribune   Why isn't this a blasting alarm in every cable/news show? @CNNPolitics @ABCPolitics @CBSPolitics @NBCPolitics @MSNBC
1321862888059883520 2020-10-30 01:14:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is what journalists need to be BLASTING.  Stop the B.S. "allowing people to vote" is a Dem "advantage."  GOP "Trying to stop people from voting" is perfectly normal behavior.
1321860061833015296 2020-10-30 01:02:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> They are, of course, a real risk to this.  Extremism &amp; weaponization is one that worries me.  But I don't know how else we rebuilt the very foundation of a functioning society without rejecting bad behavior that's not necessarily illegal but immoral.
1321860060973207554 2020-10-30 01:02:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> But I have come to believe that "shunning" - a practiced traditionally by the right - is actually healthy.  We cannot force people to BE moral.  We can push people to conform to a moral code beyond the law by shunning out of the social circles that they value.
1321860060155244544 2020-10-30 01:02:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> This. There are lines.  My nature is to empathize. To give second chances, the benefit of the doubt, and look for a balance.   But there are lines. I don't like "cancel culture" because I dislike extremism.

Deterrence didn't work because GOP - and people like you - don't think Dems will do anything about SCOTUS.

They made "liberal" a dirty word that equal wimpy, anti-country, failed, socialists, etc. That's how the GOP kept winning.  We should learn. Hang Trump like the mark of the beast on the GOP.  If we do, I don't see college-educated voters turning to the GOP

1319722450637127680 2020-10-24 03:28:46 +0800 <IT_not_real> My predictions:  Woke, CRT, BLM &amp; Hunter are destroying America.  Socialism is coming to you.  The deficit will matters: "OMG all the debt we're all living to "our children"   Qanon/White supremacists militias are just good people sharing a hobby on weekends &amp; trying to help.

1319708464722051072 2020-10-24 02:33:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> Also, truth.   Canada may - with help of climate change - become a powerhouse if they wanted too.
1319707977226481664 2020-10-24 02:31:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> Correct

1319699096383287297 2020-10-24 01:55:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> Exactly. I understand many GOP people were radicalized but proportion &amp; perspective is needed.  Bork got hearing, vote &amp; was rejected. Why didn't GOP Senators do the same w/Garland?  The GOP choice is always the cowardly action. They are incapable of owning up to what they want.
1319690271861346305 2020-10-24 01:20:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RedRedSuit @TankieSanders @firstfedora @NewDiscourses @ConceptualJames Dem=woke? Really?  Good to know this.🤨
1319523629248380928 2020-10-23 14:18:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> @kenolin1 People who don't know taxes
1319512583095775232 2020-10-23 13:34:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DJNYC1 @JoyAnnReid It also explains why a lot of late boomers &amp; early Gen X people believe the "cities are burning" story sold by Fox/Right-wing Media.  That was a reality that they witness, no a myth. It sounds ridiculous to people's 90-'00 who been around calmer times, but it isn't for them.
1319501889189203968 2020-10-23 12:52:20 +0800 <IT_not_real> Please READ.  People underestimate the '80s was all about Republicans and how dominant it was not only politics but culturally: (Wall Street, Keaton in family ties, Bunker, etc) and boom/revival of megachurches.   All the myths that prevail today started then.
1319471631660576768 2020-10-23 10:52:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RedRedSuit @TWLadyGrey I don't call it a win.  Also, I don't think that many people would see it - maybe I will be wrong but I think ratings will be lower than the other one &amp; town halls.   But it stops the bleeding. And to win the reach (red) Senate seats Dems need the bleeding to keep happening.
1319471037117915136 2020-10-23 10:49:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey You cannot help your idealistic, optimistic heart.  It's endearing and why I like you. ♥️
1319469199706632193 2020-10-23 10:42:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Yes. It is.  It also works.   We can deny it because it makes us upset at the unfairness of it but that's the standards GOP, Media &amp; voters because have allowed for Trump.   That's the reality. Like it or not.
1319465631859666945 2020-10-23 10:28:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Yes
1319465576981426178 2020-10-23 10:28:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Today:  Man: Biden suffers from dementia. Me: Have you watch Biden talk? Have you watched Trump? Does Trump seem coherent? Smart? Man: Trump is just funny. It's not dementia. Me: Ha. In other words, Your "dementia measure" only applies to Biden...because you want to excuse Trump?
1319463707349381120 2020-10-23 10:20:36 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey To college-educated people. To you. To me.  Not too the people he's too talking to.
1319462684467687429 2020-10-23 10:16:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> This Trump "better version" which helps him  There millions of GOP leaning voters who just want an excuse to do what they always did - vote for Trump  "Not yelling, crazy, old man" is enough.
1319454707132190720 2020-10-23 09:44:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> This. This. This.

1319418453313212416 2020-10-23 07:20:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 What would have happened with the public option if Obama had offered Liberman a position as Ambassador of Israel? Or the UN?
1319418110164697088 2020-10-23 07:19:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 See, again you make it personal: "I don't trust Sanders"  Why would keep a person you don't trust - Sanders/Left - in a more powerful position (Healthcare committee in Senate as chair) that can torpedo you....instead of under your control as Sec. of Labor?
1319417612221116416 2020-10-23 07:17:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 In my book, that would be a long-term strategically smart move from Biden.   For the same reason, I don't think Sanders would ever accept it.
1319417177745707008 2020-10-23 07:15:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Sanders as secretary of labor.  Politically: 1. Progressive/pro-union Dems happy.  2. May make some moderates uncomfortable.  Policy/Governing: Take Sanders away from Healthcare where he will push for M4A that will make law harder to pass. Move to labor where you can fire him.
1319413713326125056 2020-10-23 07:01:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Will these moderates not vote for Biden because he put in Sanders in a toothless position as Sec. of Labor, instead of keeping Sanders as Senate Chair of health in the Senate?
1319412522194067456 2020-10-23 06:57:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 People who decided that they hate Sanders are also, likely to believe that Biden is "dominated by the far-left &amp; Sanders/Squad are the real power" not giving Sanders a  position in labor will not make them like Biden.
1319408968700100609 2020-10-23 06:43:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Exactly.  In other words, people are irrational and don't vote on labels or policy.   They decide "I like X"  and work they way back to justify doing/voting X.
1319407526085971969 2020-10-23 06:37:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 P.S. I dislike Sanders which why I don't call him Bernie.
1319407352106217472 2020-10-23 06:36:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 In fact, taking Sanders away from Senate Chair Committee - which has power and cannot be fired - to a toothless Cabinet position where he can be fired is the smart, Machiavellian move that I wish Biden or Dems could be capable of making.
1319406747392638976 2020-10-23 06:34:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 My point in entering this convo is to force people to consider all tradeoffs.  Sanders will not be in Biden's cabinet. Why should he choose that? He's will a senator a committee chair if Dems win the Senate, which has more power than Labor - which again is a toothless position.
1319405485460647936 2020-10-23 06:29:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 So who do you explain the overlap in polling demo between Sanders voters &amp; Trump voters in WWC?
1319405248155283457 2020-10-23 06:28:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Again, refer back to the "low info" voter.   Political junkies who care about this stuff make up less than 10% of voters.
1319404729311531008 2020-10-23 06:26:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 I know a lot of progressives - in Red/Swing states - who do vote and will ecstatic with Sanders in labor &amp; Warren in treasury.
1319404406400376832 2020-10-23 06:24:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 There are not progressives or moderates.   They are young "progressives" - usually don't vote.  Over 30 "progressives" do vote.   Moderates - aka low info- young people don't vote.  Over 30+ and older "moderates" vote.   Seniors -progressives, moderate &amp; extremists- always vote.
1319403448954093568 2020-10-23 06:21:10 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 If you want to do only things that only gain voters you won't be able to do anything.  Putting Sanders in Labor may lose some people (I doubt it those were never going to vote for Dems..but let's assume) it will keep others happy.  The position is harmless and a good fit.
1319402865866100736 2020-10-23 06:18:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 I'm sorry but you cannot govern or sustain a tent if you are not inclusive.  Sanders is important for progressives, it's crucial to keep inside.   This is why, Biden - a politically smart move - did that document thing with Sanders, even if he knew GOP would use against him.
1319402123902156800 2020-10-23 06:15:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 They are republican 1st and other identities later (union may be 5th or 6th down the list).  See tweet about how people reverse positions depending on which party does it.
1319401642001723392 2020-10-23 06:13:59 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Identity. They are Republicans first. Union second.
1319401428788506625 2020-10-23 06:13:08 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 You have to start from the premise that there's a sector of Americans 35-45% that will always vote for the GOP and not to try to cater to them.   You can navigate some things, but you cannot. Why?   People are irrational.
1319400984729190400 2020-10-23 06:11:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 E.g.  Auto bailout? Socialism.  Farm-bailout? Patriotism. Trade-war? Pro-market (Trump).  Deficits? Who cares (GOP). Socialism! (Dems).  Hunter Biden meet with someone? Corruption! Ivanka, Jared, Trump are making billions.... well, who cares?
1319400505676738560 2020-10-23 06:09:28 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 small business owners &amp; non-union members, etc.   Yes, they will hate Sanders &amp; will accuse Biden of socialism.  They will do it with or without Sanders. Biden will be called a "socialist" as they call him now.   I think the tradeoff is politically beneficiary and innocuous.
1319399998493052928 2020-10-23 06:07:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 They may "hate" Sanders - I don't think in fact, WWC hates Sanders as polls show that low-income Sanders/Trump voters overlap - but once a WWC moves from making 8/hr to 15/hr they will no longer hate him.  Now if you are talking about affluent WWC people...
1319395868705910784 2020-10-23 05:51:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 *do not
1319395795439775744 2020-10-23 05:50:45 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Because voters DO NOT vote base on policy.  They never have and never will. Why? Because they bother to read policies or learn or know how it works.
1319395474617450497 2020-10-23 05:49:28 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Also, again, something I wish every Dem/Liberal/progressive understands...  Most voters don't vote on policy. They vote on "who I like best" or "Who I hate, the least?
1319395176285044736 2020-10-23 05:48:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Obamacare was not implemented until after the election in 2010 was lost.
1319394868209217538 2020-10-23 05:47:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 It will not as it will prove to be harmless.
1319394657621606400 2020-10-23 05:46:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Well, they won't vote on it...but WWC already supports it (80%)   After they start receiving the pay raise, it would go the same way as ACA and Obamacare.   Want to bet on it?
1319394143198560256 2020-10-23 05:44:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 restore institutionalism.   The only thing that will work is an overwhelming show of power.   It's the same position as the Lincoln Project has with voting all GOP out...because they understand that only losing will restore sanity.
1319393772082397184 2020-10-23 05:42:43 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 E.g. I don't think a "bipartisan commission to reform SCOTUS" is inherently bad. In fact, I would have proposed that exact thing before Barrett.   I'm against not because I want revenge but because it will ineffective on the goal: pull GOP/SCOTUS back from extremism and....
1319392950388883456 2020-10-23 05:39:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Biden said something wise "grudges don't work in politics"  He's 100% correct.   We, Dems, shouldn't punish McConnell or GOP "because we hold a grudge" that's bad politics.  We should do things that are politically smart and render a benefit to America (1st) and then Dems.
1319392421143212032 2020-10-23 05:37:20 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 LOL. Raise the minimum wage to $15 dollars immediately and it will be loved by WWC.   Socialism is just a word that people repeat but don't really get.
1319392082188926976 2020-10-23 05:36:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 McCain didn't launch "entertainment politics" that happen way back in the late '80s-'90s - I still remember Bill playing the sax.   Nader never regretted it or did anything to support Dems. On the contrary. Sanders did.
1319391617116073985 2020-10-23 05:34:09 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 is a pretty sound cabinet post.  Labor focus is mostly the implementation of existing laws and oversight. Having someone, like Sanders, a zealot anti-corp person, lead over it may actually scare corp. America into unilaterally taking action instead of having "the socialist" sue.
1319390460352155650 2020-10-23 05:29:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @MichelleBYoung1 Sanders did a lot of damage to Hillary in 2016.  But to Caesars' what' to Caesars' and Sanders have been almost flawless in his support of Biden in 2020.   I don't think he would be "reward it" as it was his civic duty....however, Labor - with a strong under cabinet secretary...
1319385523341815810 2020-10-23 05:09:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> @ThePlumLineGS Yes.   They don't care about policy is about identification &amp; relating to them.   Personally, I hate that this reality but it is the reality &amp; we have to accept it.
1319380390939774976 2020-10-23 04:49:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Ondine_MD @ConceptualJames @RadioFreeTom I agree. It's our commitment as a society to shared fictions that make currency, democracy, words, etc. that make civilization possible.  Civilizations in decay or countries that fall for autocracy, fascism, banana republic, etc lack that commitment to that's what destroys them.
1319371717718855680 2020-10-23 04:15:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Ondine_MD @ConceptualJames @RadioFreeTom Thank you for this phase "shared fiction"
1319369261282816000 2020-10-23 04:05:19 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Democratic institutions do work on honor, checking each other, &amp; responding to voters. You cannot legislate everything.  When voters decide that they will not penalize politicians for misbehavior &amp; corruption - and keep them in power - it incentivizes corruption across the board.
1319367697449168896 2020-10-23 03:59:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> But I'm told by Anti-Anti-Trumpers that Trump just talks authoritarian but does NOT do anything authoritarian.   Surely, it's fine... It has no devastating effect. It's totally not meant to cover crimes or corruption. It's totally what a republic with strong institutions does.
1319366615264210944 2020-10-23 03:54:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> Good. Public shaming should be the way to go against people who are shameless.  They are shameless because ALL of us take the easy, cowards route and accept them back...because saying something would be "rude"
1319359867421741056 2020-10-23 03:27:59 +0800 <IT_not_real> Exactly
1319286105724710915 2020-10-22 22:34:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> is not the immediate action - court expansion. But sending a message that shakes the other side into returning to limits of institutionalism.   That's not accomplished with bi-partisan commissions but with a raw, unilateral, power that shakes them.  Sigh. We, Dems, don't learn.
1319286104340639746 2020-10-22 22:34:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is a mistake. Answering the question was the first mistake. Doing a "bipartisan commission" is a mistake -   GOP has become a bully. Bullies don't respond to measured, thoughtful measures. They respond to power.   The purpose of such a power countermove....
1319135103331651584 2020-10-22 12:34:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> This is good.

1319084100452372480 2020-10-22 09:12:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @andrewbloomberg @jbouie Yes.  Empathy should be a requirement for a judge.

1319026440189300739 2020-10-22 05:23:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> Is this real?  This CANNOT be real.  Please, please tell me this is NOT real.
1319025903255519233 2020-10-22 05:20:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Redistrict Agree. Factors:  1. Biden has more money &amp; Beto/TX's work is laser-focus on GOTV. 2. Every single Early vote allows @texasdemocrats @BetoORourke @TeamJoe to text &amp; call the people who have no show up yet.  Does this mean Dems will win Texas?  No. It's a long shot..But is a shot.
1319016348211576833 2020-10-22 04:42:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> Unlikely if Biden wins...I think Greenfield will too.
1319016079373398016 2020-10-22 04:41:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> I remember. @JoeNBC was one of the loudest voices. As were @nickconfessore and others at @maggieNYT and others at NYT

1318950244801933312 2020-10-22 00:20:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jbouie Agree. No charisma.   Americans don't like boring, stiff candidates. They want "sparky" politicians. Cotton is not sparky.
1318913227753836544 2020-10-21 21:53:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> Agree. I dislike our post-modern tendency to ascribe psychological reasons to a certain type of behavior because it becomes a shield: "It's not my fault. I have an anti-social personality disorder"  When really it's just: "Rules don't apply to me. I would be free of consequences"

1318732833972629506 2020-10-21 09:56:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> Ok. This is good.
1318716235253649409 2020-10-21 08:50:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Chris_arnade Also, the disengaged adults need to stop using anger &amp; resentment as a security blanket.  Instead, they need to accept that not even the richest, smarts elites can stop progress and that idealized versions of the past only exist in their imagination.
1318714026906374151 2020-10-21 08:41:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Chris_arnade Or why the "out-touch elite" does NOT really understand what's offensive about "move to where the jobs are we get the government to subsidize it."   So, yes 100% the elites should care - and not be the greedy assholes of the '80-'90.
1318712900060475392 2020-10-21 08:37:10 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Chris_arnade Either the totally disengaged voters decided to get engaged.  Or Accept that the "out-touch elite" does NOT really understand what's the problem with paying "the disengaged" to be re-train in X industry when their old coal-mine/manufacturing job goes away.
1318712156267794432 2020-10-21 08:34:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Chris_arnade The problem?  1. When the "totally disengaged voters" make contradictory demands that are not feasible. 2. The financial/educated elites "front-row" who honestly try to help and then get attacked as "smug" &amp; doing wrong because they are trying to "impose" their values on them.
1318711041568600064 2020-10-21 08:29:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Chris_arnade 100% Correct.   It's the moral obligation of the educated AND economic elites to pay attention to working-class/disengaged voters and try to promote their interest.  It's also, smart politics as it promotes financial &amp; community stability that in long term benefits everyone.
1318710013867667456 2020-10-21 08:25:42 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Chris_arnade This is 100% real.  Totally disengaged people are whites without college degrees (non-union); lower/middle-class non-college (non union) minorities.  They do lean Dem in economic issues.

1318661225102725120 2020-10-21 05:11:50 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica Dems should nuke filibuster, not for SCOTUS but Covid help - which is extremely popular - first...then use for SCOTUS.   Let's see if we have the guts.
1318660950296154112 2020-10-21 05:10:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica McConnell knows that they will lose WH+Senate+House. It's too close to the election to help endanger GOP Senators.  The strategy is to force Dems to nuke filibuster and pass it or use the filibuster to kneecap Biden/Dems - because they think, rightly, we are too weak to do it.

France has 1-month mandatory service to get drivers license or enter university/college which means it's basically "optional"  I think - but don't hold me to it - that all Nordic countries have it.
1318388695607635968 2020-10-20 11:08:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Not necessary military service but an essential part is having a mix of economic/social &amp; racial backgrounds living away from their communities.

People cannot relate to what they don't know -they could but it requires effort.  A mandatory service that forces people to live, work, and be together *could* potentially help.

1317881653298040832 2020-10-19 01:34:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @MattBoxer94 I think having a purpose is a basic human-drive, imo. Hence why we always needed religions/gods/myths.   It's also what has moved humans to do amazing things - good &amp; bad.  Some of us accept that we are but specks and learn how to fill the need in other ways. Others, cannot.

Also, wearing a mask/staying home, etc.  It fills a minuscule part of the need to be part of something larger. In this case, it's something good &amp; I'm happy about it.  But, in general, I worry about it.
1317877735390281728 2020-10-19 01:18:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 @MattBoxer94 that may just be raising a family, holding a normal boring job, paying bills, being decent to others, having small acts of kindness, etc.  Our narcissistic drive needs it to be something "big" hence you see young white men going into militias and extremism flourishing everywhere.

I don't think so. However, I admit this is an observation and an opinion, not a statement of fact.   Only labor economists could properly answer those questions.

But simplify saying: "well, the solution was not to destroyed unions back them but diversity" ignores the fact that institutions and those in power do not just give it up.

Some civil service led the way. The first one who did? Military service...  But as people in the military &amp; civil unions will admit: it was not easy. There were significant barriers to entry.
1317599746869977089 2020-10-18 06:53:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> Class calls speak to them more than race.   Also, Wokeness is a turnoff. Traditional roles - and expectations - are not going to vanish until education levels in Hispanics/Latino communities rise.   /The end.
1317599745691373569 2020-10-18 06:53:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> But political strategists in the Dem party should be aware and understand a raising "Latino population" does not = more Dems voters.   There are raising tensions that need to be managed. One such example and a reason why Sanders was more popular than any candidate with Latinos?
1317599744454086656 2020-10-18 06:53:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> I feel like all the above should be obvious.   This is NOT some "incredible insight" but I don't if the reason that nobody talks about it is obvious...or because we are afraid to do it?
1317599743250374656 2020-10-18 06:53:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> The exception is when Latinos become the target of racial profile as they did in CA and AZ under Arpaio.    Racism &amp; "otherness" stops being a concept but a tangible reality in their daily lives which provokes a reaction that translates into political interest/action.
1317599741488738304 2020-10-18 06:53:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> and underappreciate by those who don't have contact with these groups (that's us, in our liberal blue, educated bubbles).  What I call the further "academization" of language and acceptable social norms make them even more alienated.
1317599739332841473 2020-10-18 06:53:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> Young Latino men working in men-dominated fields, where there's a mythification of strength, the "freedom" to just BE &amp; SAY whatever they want - without "censorship" from "women &amp; smartypants" who want to "dominate" or  "look down at them" is extremely valuable to them
1317599738108071937 2020-10-18 06:53:52 +0800 <IT_not_real> Circling back to Trump &amp; cultural issues: yes, there's a dominant macho culture in a large Latino segment (not college-educated), and in a world that makes that increasingly unacceptable, Trump feeds &amp; validates it.
1317599736795455495 2020-10-18 06:53:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> - especially uneducated, low/blue-collar Latino have more immediate needs, and their voting pattern resembles whites than AA. It's correlated to education levels, income, religion, union membership, etc.
1317599735427989504 2020-10-18 06:53:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> Asking a 2nd generation American born Latino to vote on immigration is like asking an Italian or Irish American to do so.   They may care as they care about it in a "lofty" &amp; abstract idea kinda way like people "care" about democracy but most....
1317599734190632961 2020-10-18 06:53:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> Latinos lack a common string to unite them. AA have it - slavery, Jim crow, etc - in a shared collective experience.  This is not true in Hispanics, whose experiences have a wide range from easy to harsh, depending on many factors: education, immigration, skin color, income, etc
1317599732978446336 2020-10-18 06:53:50 +0800 <IT_not_real> Lack of financial means and interest in formal education means Latinos have the highest percentage of HS dropout rates (9.6% in men &amp; 6.3% in women) and encourage to from HS to work and skip education.   The extreme focus on family/traditional values reinforces this tendency.
1317599731757977602 2020-10-18 06:53:50 +0800 <IT_not_real> Latino men - especially low income/working family - who are the ones tilting towards Trump runs a familiar path:  a) Raised with the expectation to become the provider &amp; be in a "traditional" family role. A view not only promoted by fathers but also by mothers &amp; extended family.

1317552259048165376 2020-10-18 03:45:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @HeerJeet @drvox 1. Hillary smears started in '92. They sunk into people's subconscious.  2.  Hillary smears got 3rd validation (Comey, MSM but also National Inquirer, etc). 3. Hillary was blamed by all of Bill's Clinton flaws but given zero credit for his successes.  4. Hillary is a woman.

I'm a liberal so I think we, as a country should look at problems that can and should be mitigated by government policy, regulations, programs and do it.  But we should also be honest about costs, tradeoffs, and expectations.
1317545276899434497 2020-10-18 03:17:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jonrog1 @RadioFreeTom What happens to any market when more people demand their product?  Are there more people demanding/wanting a college education?  **BTW I support free public college - as I support free technical, trades, etc training.

How many blacks, POC, or women in their 30's had your life right now back in the '50s?  What the unintended consequence on markets: housing, college, wages of finally "allowing" women, AA, POC to enter those markets?
1317542757259300865 2020-10-18 03:07:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom - rural internet access, transportation, revamping rural, suburbs, cities, research &amp; development, etc.  5. Restore American Global Power - which does cost money but it's better than if China takes or others take over.
1317541918188793856 2020-10-18 03:04:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom Free Public education including trades, technical, 4- year college, or a lump sum to start a business/pay house downpayment.  3. Mandatory universal health care - don't care if M4A or how we get there as long as we do.  4. Public infrastructure and R&amp; D investment:
1317540624313114625 2020-10-18 02:58:58 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom 1. Higher Taxes - not '50's level but early 70's - broad-based, progressive, and including to the middle class. This will pay for:  1. Reform of prek12 education to create a level plain field. 2. Mandatory national service which will guarantee:

They do. In my ideal, liberal world I want to see the USA move down that path.   But their taxes are higher and there are tradeoffs that most Americans are not willing to accept, for now.
1317538019059003393 2020-10-18 02:48:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @Dan_Lucey_ @MaxKennerly But you are arguing that!  You are saying: Unions + infrastructure spending +banking regulations in the '50s-'70s were great.   Let's ignore that society was dominated by white men; that interest was high and even qualifying for a mortgage/loan was extremely hard.

But I have read enough economic papers on how unions -  in fact, as a whole - treated an additional barrier to many disadvantaged communities.

We just believe that the ideas/policies that might help - at the margins - exist at different ends of the political/economic spectrum.
1317528691258191874 2020-10-18 02:11:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom @TWLadyGrey @Dan_Lucey_ @MaxKennerly As I said...if unions were not broken - who were by the most part dominated by white men without college degrees - how fast would have women, AA, POC been allowed to enter those job markets?  Is it time to try to "restore unions" and give workers a seat at the table? I think so.

I don't know.   Should unions be brought back now that those barriers -still exist but are lower?  I think so.
1317526475231277056 2020-10-18 02:02:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @Dan_Lucey_ @MaxKennerly like unions and analyzed all the factors in an objective way: 1. Did breaking unions lower wages? Yes. This a fact.   2. Did breaking unions allowed for easier entry for AA, women &amp; into the job market, or harder who were historically locked out?
1317525383256842240 2020-10-18 01:58:24 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @Dan_Lucey_ @MaxKennerly Mr. Nichols is a real conservative and I'm a liberal,  so no, that's not what I'm arguing at all.   What I am arguing is that you cannot just pick &amp; choose and imagine/assume a world without tradeoffs/downsizes when we make a choice.   We can discuss separate issues...
1317524025678065665 2020-10-18 01:53:00 +0800 <IT_not_real> @emptywheel If the Media wants to make it an issue of Hunter then do a 1st-page layout of all the verified "horrible things" that Hunter Biden did vs all the verified horrible things Kushner, Ivanka, Don Jr, Eric, and TRUMP are doing NOW.

Should strive to keep the best parts of each? Of course.   But pretending that there are downsized or sacrifices will just lead to anger once the costs become self-evident.

Americans want the best of our life as it is *now* but with the best parts of the '50s or Europe - depending on the ideological spectrum.   Which is not realistic by any measurement.

But we have to be honest about the tradeoffs.   Not pretend that we will keep the things we love about the USA and get just the best of the other industrialized western countries.

I know.  2. Things have to be measure not against a utopian ideal but relative to other standards.   Which one do you want to pick?   Other western industrialized countries or the 50's?

They are going to college!   Graduating at almost double the rates of white men - and making white men feel inadequate and lash out in anger.

That's not going to happen.
1317514275133423616 2020-10-18 01:14:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @ME_DeafServices @edward_kain Discrimination was the standard in the '50s which most liberals praise....until they don't.   Again, I think the European/Nordic model is superior. But what I find dishearting about us, liberals, it's that we are NOT honest about the costs and tradeoffs.
1317513185981706243 2020-10-18 01:09:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @ME_DeafServices @edward_kain we have to understand &amp; accept that they will be tradeoffs!  Higher taxes, better safety nets but a larger threshold to entered the labor force to get those "good-paying jobs", older - not younger - and higher cost for property ownership, etc.   This the reality.
1317512495095926784 2020-10-18 01:07:11 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @ME_DeafServices @edward_kain I'm a liberal.   I support free 4-year state college - but my priority is fixing prek12.  I support unions, better wages, public option healthcare - that comes with higher taxes.  But the expectations have to be realistic. If we compared the USA to Europe then...

This doesn't even happen in other Western countries with a better quality of life or lower income inequality than the USA.  4. Why is there an expectation of "Ok, now I want to own a 3b-2b suburban house, in a good neighboard and a brand new truck?
1317510819064602624 2020-10-18 01:00:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @ME_DeafServices @edward_kain I show you the data. Again, it's a matter of expectations.  1. You shouldn't need a college degree to have a middle-class life. 2. What 18yr just out of HS makes 45-53K with a 6-month academy or "training"? Did they ever? (Not even in "good-paying jobs myth land of the '50s)
1317506805782568960 2020-10-18 00:44:35 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Yes.
1317506749377638400 2020-10-18 00:44:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom @ME_DeafServices @edward_kain I can dig up the data for cops' income in big blue coastal cities but I'm lazy.  I know the range is 100-125K because I argued with somebody who wanted to "defund the police" that cops' salaries should be kept the same.
1317506195578523648 2020-10-18 00:42:09 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey I'm sorry but that's what the data says.   You may be talking to people in their 60's now which means they bought their house in the '80s at the earliest. More likely in the '90s.   That's another generation.

1317500832787542016 2020-10-18 00:20:51 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey *not such thing as full security.
1317500642357776385 2020-10-18 00:20:05 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey A bunch of liberals moving to Red States will automatically fix that by electing Blue Dems into office.   See? Win-win. Good for your pocket and good for America.
1317500176068562944 2020-10-18 00:18:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Yes. That's what the majority of Americans did back in the "golden days" of the '50s.   Pay off the mortgage around their 60's, sell the house, retire.
1317499820249030656 2020-10-18 00:16:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey We want the best of the '50s and the best of current standards with not downsize and no tradeoffs.   That's unrealistic.
1317499526928769024 2020-10-18 00:15:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Or you can do what people in the 50's did:   Pay the mortgage until it's done or sell and move to a cheaper place.  The problem with us, Americans, is that we want it ALL.
1317499086690340871 2020-10-18 00:13:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey No, not every job is remote. But how many people who need to visit the office one day a week could move from NYC to say PA and commute?   How many who live in Silicon Valley could live in NV and buy the extremely air cheap ticket once a week?
1317498161024311296 2020-10-18 00:10:14 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey Why should they double every 10 years?   They didn't in the '50s.
1317497891133378561 2020-10-18 00:09:09 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey How many IT companies - even more so now - are offering/encouraging remote work? And what's the complaint?  "Well, they want to adjust the salary to reflect the cost of living!"
1317497415625105408 2020-10-18 00:07:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey so? You rent until you can afford to buy and then buy what you can afford.   There's such thing as full security! Also, as you know, I do believe in paying higher taxes to increase the safety net.   But the solution is not a country where everyone owns a house.
1317496916058361856 2020-10-18 00:05:17 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey There are jobs in Red States that they could fill &amp; have a middle or upper-middle-class life...but they don't want to live in a Red State because "what a bummer."   Markets - even markets that are less elastic like the job/real-estate ones - respond to offer &amp; demand.
1317496229211693056 2020-10-18 00:02:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey There's some truth to this but it's not the full truth.  The fact is people who could live in other more affordable cities - doctors, lawyers, IT, etc - want to live in striving,  diverse EXPENSIVE blue cities because of the quality of life.
1317495267315257344 2020-10-17 23:58:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey If you cannot afford the 1 million dollar house then you will end up:  1. Without the downpayment you paid. 2. Foreclose 3. Homeless and in debt.
1317494827596926981 2020-10-17 23:56:59 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey One of the reasons "middle-class life" in the '50s was cheaper was because inter-state mobility/migration was high compared to now.  But nobody wants to talk about that.
1317494691059826689 2020-10-17 23:56:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey The choice should be renting or moving to another part of the State  - even in California, there are parts that don't cost 1 million dollars.   Or even - horrors of horrors - moving to other states where housing is cheaper.
1317493944272318470 2020-10-17 23:53:28 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey In Europe, which is what liberals, progressives, and Dems portrayed as a goal.... house ownership is, on average, at a later stage of life than in the USA.   Housing is smaller - coops &amp; condos, apts, etc - and they have a middle-class life.
1317492705262325764 2020-10-17 23:48:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom I'm not a Wall Street or Banking fan, as you know. They have a degree of guilt- much more minor than portrayed but they do.  However, people applying for cars, student loans &amp; mortgages are adults. They have a responsibility to know what they can do afford and what they cannot.
1317490912889466880 2020-10-17 23:41:26 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @RadioFreeTom I'm sorry but this a choice people make because they want a better house than they can afford.
1317490064641830912 2020-10-17 23:38:03 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom @TWLadyGrey Also, mortgage interest in housing was high &amp; requirements to actually get approved for a mortgage were extremely strict compared to now.  https://t.co/527SLBDkwl
1317489002102943744 2020-10-17 23:33:50 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Duane1Barker @NateSilver538 I think it's unlikely that Putin will actual hacking &amp; alternating of votes but let's assume:  1. Biden's polling is wide enough that hacking &amp; altering would obvious &amp; significant.  2. There's a paper trail with VBM.  It's easy to cheat 1-2%. Not as easy to 10%.
1317485625134645249 2020-10-17 23:20:25 +0800 <IT_not_real> @NateSilver538 Correct. The advantage for Biden/Dems is that every early vote frees time, money &amp; volunteers to push low propensity Dem voters (poor, young, working-class) to the polls.  That's extremely valuable. It also reduces uncertainty &amp; the effectiveness of a "Barr/Comey surprise"

I agree that it looks like "concern-trolling" if Trump/GOP blatantly non-democratic voter suppression &amp; borderline illegal measures weren't underway. But they are.

1313568556315934721 2020-10-07 03:55:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> @sahilkapur So I will take the 80% rate on political losses.  I will drive myself crazy.  But also, feel a little SMUG &amp; PROUD that we are not like the GOP.  We care about people, Dear Dems, Liberals &amp; Progressive. We fucking care about people.  It's not about power, it's about helping.

1313567520192786432 2020-10-07 03:51:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @sahilkapur The politically savvy thing would have been for Dems - not Trump or GOP - to refuse any stimulus, even CARE I or Care II. But we didn't.  Why?  We care about people.   It drives me CRAZY every time Dems lose a political battle...- which happens 80% of the time.
1313566960127406081 2020-10-07 03:49:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> @sahilkapur This is THE basic asymmetry that We, Dems, Liberals &amp; Progressives cannot make ourselves accept and why we yell:   "Why don't Dems play hardball like Republicans?"  This is why. We care about America &amp; Americans.   We care about people &amp; governing.
1313558191104352256 2020-10-07 03:14:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> 1. A Dems majority. 2. The median Dem cannot be Machin but someone like Tester or Sinema. 3. Overcoming States refusing to comply &amp; SCOTUS striking down portions of it.

1313554602541805568 2020-10-07 02:59:56 +0800 <IT_not_real> Agree. 10% is the minimum Biden needs to overcome cheating.    10% in the polls is not the same as 10% more votes.  1. Did you vote already? Get others to vote: drag family, friends, strangers. 2. Volunteer -phone banking, text, etc. 3. Donate. 4. Harass Media to stop "bothsides"

The potential extremist by CRT, Woke, Antifa, etc. is at the same point that the Tea party was in 2010.   It can grow to become the same cancer that Trumpish/Q-Anon did in the GOP. It's not there yet.

1312521197876244481 2020-10-04 06:33:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @KTrujil94782722 @SheriFlanders @notcapnamerica @whittomd In my "I'm not a not parent" opinion too many parents lean towards rewarding "be a kid" and not enough on "be responsible."  I don't pretend to know where is the line.   But it worked out for me as they did. It may not for others.
1312520693662113794 2020-10-04 06:31:33 +0800 <IT_not_real> @KTrujil94782722 @SheriFlanders @notcapnamerica @whittomd There are lines and of course, balance. Finding a balance is HARD.   Adventure, games, etc should be part of a kids' life. Responsibility &amp; learning about consequences for risky behavior is part of that.

They often would go back and fix what I "did" 🤣  But just "this is what you have to do" teaches responsibility but also, gives you confidence in an "Ok, I can do this!" and pride, imo.

Emotional security is something totally different, imo.   I think a big mistake many parents make is trying to install a sense of responsibility when kids become teens...by then it's too late.
1312516589678280705 2020-10-04 06:15:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SheriFlanders @notcapnamerica @whittomd It was about money per se, or punishment.  Just a way to learn about "costs" install a sense of responsibility, hard work, etc.

1312483089512235009 2020-10-04 04:02:07 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 1&amp;2 will serve a damn against feeding SCOTUS the type of cases that GOP wants them to rule on - which are more the econ/corp/workers' rights one than cultural.  The threat of SCOTUS packing will provide the right incentive for Roberts to stop the coy "who, me? partisan" game.
1312482070107619328 2020-10-04 03:58:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 I'm a liberal Dem 🤣 so I think reform would less institutionally damaging:  1. Triple Federal District court- fill with young liberals.  2. Double appeals courts -fill with liberals.  Hold SCOTUS packing as a Chekhov's gun to Roberts. Keep ideology&gt;law &amp; face consequences.
1312477275170906112 2020-10-04 03:39:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 Dems don't want to do this. We respect institutions. We don't WANT to pack the courts &amp; fear the consequences.   But what other option do the GOP leave us? None.  At one point, Dem will have to cut the gangrenous arm to save the body. It may be too late, but we will have to try.
1312476052287942657 2020-10-04 03:34:10 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jeffbruce35 I wish it was only anger.  It's a heartbreaking realization that no other methods will work. It's like dealing with an addicted loved one.  You try reasoning, cajoling, guilt-tripping, providing therapy, rehab, etc. Then you realize. The only "solution" is to stop your enabling.
1312469783275737090 2020-10-04 03:09:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> I admit it. We, Dems -liberals more than progressives- overthink things.  We look at a situation, try to game out every possibility often locking us into inaction.  But the GOP has grown complacent expecting that Dems will never react &amp; punch back. They may soon be surprised.

1312154829418983424 2020-10-03 06:17:44 +0800 <IT_not_real> @RadioFreeTom The most underrated "quality" in Trump is that he plays each minute to max. effect.  Trump may be forced to go to Walter Reed. But now, he will make it a big, showbiz moment "heroically" macho-man walking to the helicopter, etc.   If Trump gets better, it will be a "sir, story"

1311794587309023232 2020-10-02 06:26:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @NickRiccardi Dems are betting:  1. Money to flip Senate is more valuable. Biden has plenty. 2. People who show up to vote for a Dem Senator will be inclined to vote for Biden.  Yes, there are some ticket splits but it's increasingly rare.  3. Biden without Senate will not be able to govern.

The more Trump/GOP is obvious about trying to stop people from voting the more enrages people...even people who shrug if they couldn't vote.

1311335142263119872 2020-10-01 00:00:36 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Teri_Kanefield I think is the most accurate debate "analysis"   Trump behaves exactly like a bratty, entitled, "too smart" for homework teen, trying to b.s. his way out of questions. He doesn't understand the questions, he doesn't read or study but boost about something he does not know.

Trump inherited 400 billion, went bankrupt 7 times, conned people, had to be reduced to be a fake "successful businessman billionaire" on reality tv &amp; it's still in debt for 1.1 Billion.   It must suck to be such a huge loser.   No wonder Trump is so angry &amp; whines so much.

1310429507484958720 2020-09-28 12:01:55 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jessicashortall The bad part: We, Americans are on the hook.  America is a laughing stock around the world. 3T in debt. 30m jobs lost. 200K Americans' lives lost.  All because Trump, the US president, is such an incompetent loser he cannot manage a lemonade stand.
1310428827328212992 2020-09-28 11:59:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jessicashortall A mistake.  Trump/GOP will want to make it about accounting &amp;/or what's illegal.  They will want to make it "well, you cannot say he committed fraud until he goes to court &amp; convicted beyond a reasonable doubt."  Easy: Trump inherent millions. Lose it. Pay $750 in taxes. Sad!
1310428043106684932 2020-09-28 11:56:06 +0800 <IT_not_real> President only paid $750 dollars due to business losses was a better headline.   but ok @nytpolitics

Trump disclosed Israel &amp; American intelligence to Russia.   5 Eyes has been reluctant to share intelligence with us due to it.

Obama/Biden are better than Trump.

1310403805809242113 2020-09-28 10:19:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay Is this why Trump keeps taking Putin's side even after Putin put bounties in American soldiers and has never taken the side of America's intelligence community?   Is Putin helping Trump paid his 420 million in loans?  Just asking questions.
1310403303478456320 2020-09-28 10:17:48 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay Is it Turkey and that's he abandoned the Christian Kurds? and why Trump had a "little conflict of interest"?  Is this why Trump not only hid but aided MBS when he killed an American journalist? because "Saudis pay"? Did the Saudis help pay the 420 million in loans?
1310402918638526465 2020-09-28 10:16:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay This exactly. Dems' sense of fairness and disgust at "ruthless" politics stop us. We should not stop.  "We should ask questions." Just like "very serious GOP thinkers" do.   To whom does Trump's owe 420 million dollars?

1310399836156342272 2020-09-28 10:04:01 +0800 <IT_not_real> @kylegriffin1 Do not do this @TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi it's easy.  Trump is a loser. Trump is a fake billionaire who lost money inherent from daddy.  Trump inherent the best economy from Obama/Biden and lost it.   The tragedy is that it cost Americans: 3t in debt. 30m jobs &amp; 200k Lives.
1310397449303859200 2020-09-28 09:54:32 +0800 <IT_not_real> @epallred @TWLadyGrey @kumar69781989 @Cernovich We agree.  Trump is a loser who didn't pay taxes &amp; lost the billions daddy left him. Trump is doing the same to America.  Inherent a booming economy from Obama/Biden and lost it all: 3T debt. 30m jobs' loss. 200K American lives.   All of it because Trump is an incompetent loser.
1310394886055624704 2020-09-28 09:44:21 +0800 <IT_not_real> @epallred @TWLadyGrey @kumar69781989 @Cernovich Yes, totally normal (/s)  Billionaires only paid $750 and owe 420 million. It happens all the time.   Trump is a loser. Owe it.

Trump declared bankruptcy 7 times, conned people all his life &amp; still only paid $750 in taxes because he's a bad businessman &amp; a loser.  Trump is doing the same to America. Inherent a booming economy &amp; then lost it all.

Try to make it about the small little thing and not the bigger issue.  We, Dems always fall for this trick because we want to be "accurate &amp; fair."   Notice how it does apply to Clinton, Biden, etc?
1310392121027825665 2020-09-28 09:33:22 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Cernovich lol.  Ask any accountant. Payroll taxes are included as part of "business deductions"

1310384340157702144 2020-09-28 09:02:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> Again this is the message.  Trump is a bad businessman and a loser.  Trump is doing to America what he did to his businesses: inherent billions &amp; it's now 420 million in debt.   3T in debt 30m jobs lost. 200k American's lives.  Trump cannot even manage a lemonade stand.
1310377134464987136 2020-09-28 08:33:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> This:   Who does Trump owe 421m? Does he owe it Turkey &amp; abandoned good Christian Kurds because of it? Does he owe to the Saudis &amp; he let an American journalist get killed? Or is to Putin &amp; this he does not care that Putin put bounties' on American soldiers?  Asking questions.
1310367338881982464 2020-09-28 07:54:53 +0800 <IT_not_real> @DavMicRot Trump is a terrible businessman squandered daddy's money, lost it &amp; only pays $750 in taxes.   Are we surprised that Trump squandered Obama's economic boom, lost 30m American jobs &amp; 200k American lives?
1310365775702548480 2020-09-28 07:48:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> @samstein @TheRealHoarse Trump is a loser who loses money and that's why he only paid $750 in taxes. That's the most damaging part.
1310365232913477632 2020-09-28 07:46:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> @AgTerzo Trump is a loser who inherit billions from daddy and lost it all. That's why he only paid $750 dollars in taxes.   Trump inherent a great economy and a strong America from Obama &amp; Biden. Lost 30 million jobs &amp; 200k American's lives.  Trump is incompetent, corrupt &amp; a loser.

Trump is a loser as a president who lost 30m jobs &amp; 200k America's lives.  Trump does know how to manage or do anything.  Trump is a loser and America is paying the price.
1310363417153167360 2020-09-28 07:39:18 +0800 <IT_not_real> @TWLadyGrey @EricTrump Trump is such a bad businessman that after inheriting billions from daddy, loss it - even in the casino business - all &amp; only paid $750.  Maybe this why Trump needed to abandon the Kurds, ignores' Putin's bounties in American soldiers, and tries to use El Doral for G7.  A loser.
1310361232348643328 2020-09-28 07:30:37 +0800 <IT_not_real> @jbouie Exactly: "Trump is not rich. Trump is not successful.

It should be:  "Trump inherent billions for daddy, loss it all even in the casino business. Trump is a bad businessman that keeps losing money. That's why he only paid $750."  Just like Trump is losing 30m jobs &amp; 200k American's lives.
1310359072743464961 2020-09-28 07:22:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> Trump abandoned the Kurds...to try to make money from Turkey.  Trump let an American journalist get killed because "Saudis pay"  Trump won't criticize Putin for putting bounties to America's soldiers. Maybe this is why?  Trump goes golfing to charge America's &amp; make some money.
1310359071623532545 2020-09-28 07:22:02 +0800 <IT_not_real> Dems please be politically savvy for ONCE.  Forget the deductions. Focus.  "Trump is such a loser than inherent money, squandered, played a fake billionaire, and it's playing a fake president while putting America up for sale.   This is about "Making Trump great"
1310356240749359105 2020-09-28 07:10:47 +0800 <IT_not_real> Trump's a loser and America is paying the price with Trump/GOP depression.   Trump couldn't manage a business - not even a casino - without losing money.  Trump cannot manage America's gov.  The result: America into 3T in debt, 30m lost jobs &amp; 200k Americans' lives loss.
1310354693395066880 2020-09-28 07:04:38 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay Also, Dems need to make it about "Trump is such a bad businessman that even after inheriting billions, conning people, not paying contractors and breaking the law...he still managed to lose money.

Something too often overlooked.

It also makes us lousy at winning political power that involves ruthlessness, machiavellian steps, and raw power.
1309711312675418113 2020-09-26 12:28:04 +0800 <IT_not_real> @magi_jay @jeffbruce35 I admire RBG. I will always admire her. I don't think admiration=flawless.  RBG suffered from a bias that highly smart; highly ethical, highly empathic people suffer.  A bias that many of us in the left share.  We assumed &amp; expect others to act as we would. We assume good faith.

The scandal is that the Clinton foundation is still named "Clinton", not trademarks from China or Saudis "investment" for murdering an American.

And yes, one of the main reasons gets not pushback is because Trump=ratings/money.   Governing &amp; solving problems does not get clicks or viewers. Calamaty and disaster does.   But that's the reality, and it's not only on the Media but us, the public who enable it.

1308592485195677696 2020-09-23 10:22:15 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica @KamalaHarris Maybe you are right.   But, imo, it never hurts to try. Denying access exacerbates the problem.

She made it worse by always being - legitimately- defensive of the Media after what they did to her.   By the way, this part of Michelle Obama's brillance. She knows how to treat - and yes, manipulate - the Media.
1308591079931875328 2020-09-23 10:16:40 +0800 <IT_not_real> @Shorty2222 @notcapnamerica @KamalaHarris Agree 1000%.   Kamala Harris is naturally charming. She cannot fix the prejudice but she can diminish the impact.   Why give them more reasons to make her life difficult if she's planning to run in 2024?  That's my opinion. It severely hurt Hillary. It will hurt KH.

Liberals get punished because the reason the "liberal Media" is docile when treated like garbage by GOP/Trump is that they don't want to be accused of "liberal bias"
1308587942101671936 2020-09-23 10:04:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @notcapnamerica @KamalaHarris It's not fair. But this was Hillary's mistake.  Hillary never forgave how the Media treated her in the 90's. It kneecapped her.  Kamala shouldn't make the same mistake. If she wants to run in 2024, KH needs to let it go.   If not...the media will pull a "but her emails" on her.

1308567350472445952 2020-09-23 08:42:23 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SeanTrende @andrew12la I do believe Liberals/Dems/progressives should swallow the medicine of not voting.   That means accepting Kennedy's retirement &amp; RBG death as a "voting has consequences."  However, a constitutional amendment setting it at 11 judges makes all of this not feasible.
1308566731204358144 2020-09-23 08:39:55 +0800 <IT_not_real> @SeanTrende @andrew12la I'm fine with this...as long as it's not Garland.   Obama nominated Garland because GOP Senators basically said: "Name a moderate. We will confirm it"  They blocked him for over 200 days, stole the seat &amp; set America on fire. They get a full flesh bleeding liberal.

1308463703600148482 2020-09-23 01:50:31 +0800 <IT_not_real> @whstancil We should invite all US Territories to become States if they choose too.  American Samoa Guam Northern Mariana,  Islands  Puerto Rico U.S. Virgin Islands D.C.   2 Senates each.  12 new Senate Seats/Stars  It the most democratic, anti-imperialistic &amp; fair.

It's democratic, anti-imperialistic and equal. It would also give Dems more seats. GOP may even gain 2 senators so cannot complain.

It also hubris by McConnell &amp; GOP to think that they can kick around the rule of law, democracy, institutions, and norms - and Dems will continue to be unreactive.

Kennedy was "urged" so...not likely but not a 0% probability. I do think "expanding the courts" should be kept on the table.

A latino in texas is more conservative, influenced by prevalance of evangelicals and local "hands-off" environment. That would change if Texas behaved like AZ.

Pundits and pollsters routinely disregard how the influence of the environment around people influences their political positions.

1305956729109139457 2020-09-16 03:48:42 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anatosaurus The strategy should be 2-fold:   1. Build-up Trump negatives for those who will never vote for a Dem - aka older Cuban-Americans - so they stay home.   2. Increase appeal for Biden to younger Latinos, which by the way vote like white voters - education more important than race.
1305956464964505600 2020-09-16 03:47:39 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anatosaurus Also, there's a lot of resentment for dictators because they seem, correctly, as a source of horrific stories of loss &amp; corruption.  But mainly, this idea that there's only one way to persuade  Latino voters - or any voter - is profoundly mistaken.
1305954090367639552 2020-09-16 03:38:13 +0800 <IT_not_real> @anatosaurus Agree that this is why Trump feminizes his opponents. Also, reinforcing "strength" or "effective" is a mistake.   But I disagree that latinos see Dictators in Latin America as either strong or effective.  I think they see them as weak hiding behind the power of government.

This is why he hates the troops. This is why he hates anyone who achieved wealth with hard-work and not daddy's money.   It's pretty simple.

However, Dems do not have a propaganda arm like Fox/Right-wing/Local (Sinclair) Media.  Dems do not control the "liberal media" bothsides instincts.

1301642693676732419 2020-09-04 06:06:16 +0800 <IT_not_real> Most who talk about it at all freely admit a measure of guilt.

1301618771732303872 2020-09-04 04:31:12 +0800 <IT_not_real> @madrid_mike 3. Latinos are buy-in all the conspiracies about coronavirus.  Many Latinos are "essential workers." They have to work; no backup for school closings, etc. Beliving "coronavirus is a hoax" &amp; minimizing it is easier than reality.  Trump is telling them what they want to hear.

Increase the House budgets, build a cluster of buildings &amp; hire a sizable amount of experts in each area. Then hand off the manual to the Executive branch like an errand boy.  *Likely unconstitutional.
1301217050191433729 2020-09-03 01:54:54 +0800 <IT_not_real> @weneedmorereps @jonrog1 I guess first we have to define what's the ideal role of MoC in the House?   To give a voice to constituents or to make laws that further the interests of those constituents?   Those two things are most of the time, not the same.
1301216522820558849 2020-09-03 01:52:49 +0800 <IT_not_real> @weneedmorereps @jonrog1 SCOTUS current absurd - and yes, malicious - demand that the House makes laws that address every little technical issue instead of relying on the civil experts/administrative state makes things harder.

It hard to get House to agree on anything as it is...imagine if it was larger?

Remember when that journalist asked Trump "Do you regret all the lies you have told Americans?" And he shrugged and moved to the next question.  That's how it is in autocracies. But murderers, property confiscations, abuses, etc.
1300666934283743233 2020-09-01 13:28:57 +0800 <IT_not_real> @csilverandgold @AthulKAcharya "constrained by the performance of democracy."  They are not constrained.

The republic is barely holding up -in fact, it may be too late.  On a gut level, we think we are immune and that it only happens in "those" countries. It does not.  It's happening here &amp; now to the USA.

I'm sorry it's naive to think that Biden can afford to gamble a few points.  I call this "American strong institutions privilege."

Riots foster the destruction of the rule of law, institutions, and consolidation of authoritarians - clothed under "left" or "right" ideology, when in fact they only seek one thing: power.
1300591815616114688 2020-09-01 08:30:27 +0800 <IT_not_real> @csilverandgold In practical terms: Does Biden have any other path?
1300589108096454658 2020-09-01 08:19:41 +0800 <IT_not_real> This 100% correct.  It's also, smart.
