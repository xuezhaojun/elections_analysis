1333596838591606787 2020-12-01 10:20:38 +0800 <LareeU> @Acosta @caroline_mkelly But he doesn’t read. He sees the writing but he just can’t read/comprehend it. And he has run our country for 4 years. We thankfully survived. (So far)

1328350721864065025 2020-11-16 22:54:26 +0800 <LareeU> @realDonaldTrump How could we suspect you have a clue to come up with a vaccine when you don’t even know what it is called. And your poor leadership has turned us into a pathetic shadow of what we used to be. Go away. Loser!

1326729267829477376 2020-11-12 11:31:21 +0800 <LareeU> @realDonaldTrump Get a grip. You are losing what little bit of mind you have left. Dotard.

1326590204292030467 2020-11-12 02:18:46 +0800 <LareeU> Well sadly he isn’t taking away Drs directly, just taking away our ability to afford seeing one. And there are people in the U.S. currently starving and living in cars because of his inability to handle the virus and he cares bout nothing but himself. Pay attention!
1325892757722951680 2020-11-10 04:07:21 +0800 <LareeU> You might have Pence. No one has seen him I heard. That will be BINGO!

Europe had a few months of “normal”
1325796276118695944 2020-11-09 21:43:58 +0800 <LareeU> @realDonaldTrump We got the Biden bump in the stock market! Thanks for pointing it out. And yes...the vaccine! Great news.

1324489093217243139 2020-11-06 07:09:42 +0800 <LareeU> Yes they sure do depend on God when it comes to elections. Trump loves God like evangelicals love hell. He has never cracked open a bible until he ran for Pres to get their votes.
1324360852405932035 2020-11-05 22:40:07 +0800 <LareeU> @WEASLEYSFILMS @realDonaldTrump I wake up since the election and smile for the first time in 4 years. Oh how I’ve missed my life being normal. Thank you Joe!
1324360483277778945 2020-11-05 22:38:39 +0800 <LareeU> So sadly true. What an embarrassing whiner this man had been. For 4 years he has been so “victimized” by these circumstances he perceives as “done to him”. Not the USA but to Trump. Bless his dark little heart. 🥺

1321549057261735937 2020-10-29 04:27:03 +0800 <LareeU> @JohnWDean Because everyone knows it’s a lie. Everyone that isn’t in Cult 45. But they will eat your sh*t if YOU tell them it’s fudge. So we pay no attention to you.

1318646679571255298 2020-10-21 04:14:02 +0800 <LareeU> Trump is a drama Queen. That’s all there is to it.

1318272782334087169 2020-10-20 03:28:18 +0800 <LareeU> @realDonaldTrump It regained its luster when you moved to my trashy state. Welcome to the garbage heap.
1316540054823731200 2020-10-15 08:43:03 +0800 <LareeU> @ddale8 Seriously does anyone believe him with this crap?
1316413987450499073 2020-10-15 00:22:07 +0800 <LareeU> I think he had a few too many 32 oz beers wrapped in a paper bag.

You never managed to defeat the first wave so we get to spend almost a year in a bubble. So don’t act like you are superior to other world leaders. You are an embarrassment.
1315439627046715392 2020-10-12 07:50:21 +0800 <LareeU> Can you imagine having a President with a heart? It was only 4 years ago but seems an eternity since we had a respectable person living in the White House.

He never presented one. 2018 he promised a tax cut right before the midterms. No tax cut. He never presented a plan to congress.  He makes promises to get votes. He doesn’t care that everybody knows it’s a lie.
