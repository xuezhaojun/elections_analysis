1344061135197245441 2020-12-30 07:22:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> It says alot about the so called Labour Party when the white working class British people have more in common with Jacob Rees Mogg than it! Brexit breaks down barriers, social class, money it’s all about freedom, success, culture, values and what’s best for our country 🔵🇬🇧
1344059394233925634 2020-12-30 07:15:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣the EU luvvies can’t work in the EU without a permit. Welcome to the real world🤣
1344058264657518592 2020-12-30 07:10:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> So they can ban supertrawlers under conservation measures. If the government get on and invest in costal communities and rebuilt old ports, fisheries and decommissioned processing plants over next 5 years we are ready to take back what’s ours and sell it elsewhere🔵🇬🇧👏🏻

And as for vaccines ... not a hope in hell.
1344045987149488128 2020-12-30 06:21:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ClareCraigPath How do you get cancer from COVID? Yes you can get heart &amp; kidney problems if COVID makes you very sick &amp; pushes you into organ failure but cancer? How does that work...new novel virus to cancer. Where does she work, and staff don’t usually interview that’s chief executive job
1344044521269682177 2020-12-30 06:15:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> It reflects the trade ratio . It’s not remarkable at all. The EU protected it’s export market, huge export market that it depends on and made a grab at as much control as it could get away with and the fish bonus. It’s not great. #boycottEU

It’s truly embarrassing to see what’s she reduced him to. She’s no actress ... it’s like an advert voice over for frozen peas... we all need a laugh 😂 😂😂
1344022497080074247 2020-12-30 04:48:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @1wabbitt1 Tories all back it. Combined opposition is so weak and irrelevant it can postulate and grandstand awsy and even if not a single one backs the deal it makes zero difference. 🤣 they are weak...

1344020571387027456 2020-12-30 04:40:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> These exits will shape our future more than this bloody deal. Europe has woken up to the manipulation and bullying the EU  uses.

Not very bright and the perfect example of how easy it is to bribe the thick ... EU gives them a bit of their own money back, no queues at airports and they think they are special. That’s how shallow remain is
1344015361683968003 2020-12-30 04:20:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MrsAitchBee I suggest you educate yourself you stupid bitch ...go and look around the holocaust museum, go to Belgium and look around the war graves. Don’t  EVER compare democracy and leaving the EU, the third attempt to take UK with THAT. We have fought for British freedom 3 times &amp; won

1344000934607802370 2020-12-30 03:22:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @munirawilson Tories back it. They negotiated it. They are running the country with an 80 seat majority. What difference does it make you talking about it? Your party is insignificant. The entire political opposition is so small in number it is irrelevant... hence the grandstanding.
1343950653585027074 2020-12-30 00:02:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NicolaSturgeon Scotland , as you well know voted to be part of Britain. And you just don’t like it. You can’t run the bits your supposed up to , you continually want cash handouts from Westminster, your subsidised by the rest of Britain, you cannot be independent. You depend on England.

There should of been a border on the republic side or let it be the smugglers gateway into the EU. Northern Ireland should of been the priority not protecting the EU border.

1343674560621780997 2020-12-29 05:45:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DanielKebedeNEU @WendyPuerto Less than 200 people in hospital in Lincolnshire with it. Hardly the NHS  ‘on its knees’.

Looking back through generations in my family I can in all honestly say that raising  families of 16 living in a two up two down definitely didn’t own that Slave I’m guilty of them having.
1343508304954327047 2020-12-28 18:45:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @johnredwood The government has lost the ability to govern. It hasn’t done it for 47 yrs. it only knows how to hand money and contracts out. Usually rubbish cash wasting contracts. Government need to rebuild the nations assets and run them. Contract era needs ending.
1343507547567828992 2020-12-28 18:42:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson if this is true he needs to step down today. And this is why people don’t trust @Conservatives with covid, nothing is right, your behaviours, inconsistency, desperation to vaccinate , your handling of it. There’s something not right about it all.

1343340821853175810 2020-12-28 07:39:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Steve_highstar It’s rushed, the EU have proved already with the WA how they intend to be throwing its weight about and  Boris never had been one for detail. 61 other trade deals signed and not one needing a treaty , political declaration, 20,000 page ‘deal’ legal text or fishing rights.
1343333753360416769 2020-12-28 07:11:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> @campbellclaret It’s irrelevant when Tories have an 80 seat majority government. Labour can make paper aeroplanes out of ballot paper and it will make no difference. None. Zero.

We have  the surrender act , the surrender declaration and now the surrender deal. Concentrate on that not twitter.

1343224665137930244 2020-12-27 23:58:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EnglishAndProu3 Any deal would ge complete capitulation by Boris who would rather sign a bloody awful deal that somebody rise will have to deal with than walk away. He’s pathetic. 20,000 pages of sell out that he will try and tell us is leaving. From what I’ve seen it’s absolutely shite.

There will be plenty more hidden concessions. @Conservatives this is not freedom. Or taking back control. It’s capitulation by a desperate PM who will not run this country. Hope ERG put their foot down...

1342256081070919681 2020-12-25 07:49:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson so there will be friction with trade ... the EU say it won’t be frictionless so it won’t... I doubt your friends and neighbours will be friendly neighbours for long.
1342255149595574272 2020-12-25 07:45:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @katyjon If it’s insignificant why have the EU desperately tried to hang on to our €20 billion a yr industry?why was it the last wrangle &amp; why did Macron threaten to invade our waters for it?Even remainers must know the ‘fishing is nothing’ line is a load of old codswallop,it’s MASSIVE🇬🇧
1342253785918402566 2020-12-25 07:40:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @StanCollymore When you can speak as many languages as Boris ,who has also just kicked the EU out of play he can make as many Brussels jokes as he likes. Fish tie was a nice extra touch . Stick to you free sandwiches lobbying 👍🏻
1342252903516565504 2020-12-25 07:36:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @mikegalsworthy In your opinion. Boris is being fair putting European Students on a level playing field with all other international students.bYou have to get your head around EU not getting preferential treatment. Students have always had opportunity to study globally.The apron strings are cut.
1342252119794085888 2020-12-25 07:33:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> For the first time in my lifetime the elected government in my country is free to govern as the British people want it to.   For the first time Britain is free to do what is best for Britain not the EU,   British interest first not the EU. We have high hopes 🇬🇧
1342229074266173440 2020-12-25 06:02:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s start on that straight away...
1342228865431838720 2020-12-25 06:01:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @acgrayling There are millions more delighted to be out of the EU and celebrating 🥳 🎉
1342228465597231120 2020-12-25 05:59:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> That’s what the EU are saying... how can they say we’ve signed up for a level playing field and Boris say we haven’t and who will the arbitrator be? Sounds like we do it EU way from what Boris said in his speech.
1342222279577579522 2020-12-25 05:35:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> Tonight the light goes off for remain  https://t.co/gMg84Rk8l6

1342221767218180097 2020-12-25 05:33:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> Now then,where’s @DavidLammy tonight?He’s usually got alot to say for himself.Tonight he’s in a bit of a fix,vote for the deal or opt for no deal.He’s on my tick list for those to congratulate, I’ve done Miller, Verhofstadt, Davy and Starmer... Tusk next...in his ‘special hell’🇬🇧
1342220310175739904 2020-12-25 05:27:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @icrimages @BorisJohnson No I’m not. That 20,000 page text needs scrutinised word for word by legal experts. That treaty needs to be spot on and there’s a week. One week left out of 54 months. The EU won’t miss a trick. There’s already ambiguous paragraphs appearing. I don’t trust the EU one bit.
1342219253571866624 2020-12-25 05:23:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> @andreajenkyns Let’s concentrate on the details of the legal text. The WA was a big learning curve... the EU has already shown its hand with a locked border and threats of us breaking international law.This is a long term battle. Boris’s tie won’t help us when they start exploiting legal texts.
1342218260377456641 2020-12-25 05:19:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> Well the answer he gave wasn’t ‘yes it is safe’...
1342217661128859648 2020-12-25 05:16:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @thatginamiller Nobody is trolling you. We want to thank you for proving the law to make sure we got out. You have campaigned against democracy for 54 mths, tried every dirty trick you could think of. It backfired. There is a moral to your story. Cheers 🍻 #LeaveWon
1342215728917843968 2020-12-25 05:09:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> Might get that no deal... ‘thread bare’20,000 pages ... can someone in government confirm that there actually words on the pages 🇬🇧
1342215258786639877 2020-12-25 05:07:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> Britain,having been held political hostage over lettuce since Sunday can thank  @BorisJohnson for a sloppy rushed through deal.
1342214169953787905 2020-12-25 05:02:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> @PhilipDav @guyverhofstadt @MichelBarnier Congratulation Boris and David Frost for having to listen to Brussels bullshit for 54 mths. Immature politicians and stupid demands.
1342213686962876417 2020-12-25 05:00:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt There will be no left wingers getting in...we will send you Nigel Farage next time. Leave is done.... now we punish you and we push for success.
1342213108073422849 2020-12-25 04:58:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> We’ll go back to how we were before you globalists launched  this biological weapon . #NoReset
1342212389895352320 2020-12-25 04:55:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @tom98784 @TheRealRevK @DavidGHFrost And our standards are higher so the EU better pull it’s finger out.
1342211675919941633 2020-12-25 04:52:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JonHolb @carol_hulme It’s not tight enough,it’s sloppy, the EU will use his failure to be thorough against us... Boris is all bluster, it’s rushed , it should never be last minute,he didn’t learn from the WA mistakes. He’s messy. I hope ERG and legal team force some changes to protect us
1342209817532903429 2020-12-25 04:45:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @acgrayling You couldn’t stop us voting to leave  You couldn’t stop us leaving You couldn’t stop the deal  You can’t stop us being successful  You can’t stop any of it  It’s over you lost  Britain’s free Leave won 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧❤️🇬🇧👍🏻
1342208431235735552 2020-12-25 04:40:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Anna_Soubry We are a Global Britain...free to take advantage of the freedom leave gives us, so much better than being tied to a restrictive,divisive political regime taking us in a direction of submissions nobody ever voted to be part of. Today remain is well &amp; truly a thing of the past🇬🇧🔵
1342206004042346497 2020-12-25 04:30:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NicolaSturgeon It’s worth remembering Scottish people voted to stay part of a United Britain.
1342205729860710408 2020-12-25 04:29:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> But @NicolaSturgeon was quite happy to foist the disastrous fishing policy on Scottish fishermen against their will.
1342168651751944192 2020-12-25 02:01:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt @MichelBarnier See how strong and united you are when the EU27 see Britain free, making our own decisions and successful😁🤣🇬🇧
1342168182786826241 2020-12-25 02:00:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @adrianowlett @vonderleyen Nothing was stolen. You have had 54 months to take citizenship wherever you like.
1342167850484707334 2020-12-25 01:58:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> @StevenJBattelle @vonderleyen We won’t be back . We have left &amp; transition us over. Get over it...
1342167608133607426 2020-12-25 01:57:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @vonderleyen What is fair competition distorted? What if we are more competitive and other nations want to trade with us? What when our standards are higher? What about the procurement rules?  is that ditched. What about the EU army? How we be a competitor and ‘partner’ ...
1342164004681244675 2020-12-25 01:43:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> Hopefully the ERG and Sir Bill Cash will pick up any tiny clause the EU have included in the 20,000 page treaty with the intention to exploit it. Reassuring to know John Redwood say the ERG want an exit/ get out clause in it ... Boris hasn’t got trade side tight enough.
1342162636813774855 2020-12-25 01:38:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> Not sure who Boris has got in mind as a neutral arbitrator. I’m wondering if this is necessary with the other 58 global trade deals he’s signed or if the EU is ‘special’. Very hazy on detail of the level playing field. My guess is the EU are already planning how to exploit it.
1342090125765959680 2020-12-24 20:49:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sarahwollaston Britain’s been poorer since we have been funding that Ponzi scam dictatorship for nearly 50 yrs... get back to cleaning your hi-de-hi chalets ...
1342089518636294147 2020-12-24 20:47:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TrippyPip So the whole of Britain has just had a reminder of that evil cow and knows her new name.
1342088924798312448 2020-12-24 20:45:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @tomhfh And they all need another one...
1342088673907646464 2020-12-24 20:44:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales Confirmation the lefties are completely unhinged...
1342088285976481792 2020-12-24 20:42:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @y_alibhai How many years would it take you to email everyone you have trolled and insulted🤔
1342087923479552001 2020-12-24 20:41:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mikey1732 Nigel would always have secured a stronger leave, less compromise and concession and it would of been done and dusted years ago.
1342062750172852225 2020-12-24 19:01:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> Just thinking of those remain MPs, something is coming back as a deal... they are going to have to vote for it or make it no deal 😂 that’s there Christmas spoilt .

1341917359158816768 2020-12-24 09:23:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @grantshapps What about the social migrants arriving in the channel who set off from there? Are they allowed in to compromise and put the health of the nation at risk?
1341875144759894016 2020-12-24 06:35:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> Reassuring... but maybe better if Boris discussed  his proposals with you  before making offers to the EU?
1341865499001565188 2020-12-24 05:57:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BelindadeLucy @BillCashMP I trust him alot

1341853865591894017 2020-12-24 05:11:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DCBMEP Excellent... with the trade deficit  most of us worked out who would be trapped and most affected Sunday evening before Macron had even  blocked the ports. His grandstanding proving what an absolute idiot he is... his climb down -lateral tests 50% accurate IF symptomatic 😂🤦🏼‍♀️
1341852922750119937 2020-12-24 05:07:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MrMasonMills I hope you have inside information.
1341852606361202688 2020-12-24 05:06:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Anna_Soubry I think you will find people who live abroad are foreigners. France thinks they are dirty covid riddled foreigners  and won’t let them in, subjecting them to suffering and humiliation of being denied access home. Europe is shite... Macron is and utter shite..
1341851895237931011 2020-12-24 05:03:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Anna_Soubry Can you tell me which silly twat has stranded them there,blocking our roads &amp; causing chaos?Which bloody idiot has denied them entry to their own country?Macron is an utter shit... stop blaming other people for what that shower of shit in Europe has done. And FFS buy a hairbrush

1341850616050688002 2020-12-24 04:58:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidJonesMP Having seen France blockade it’s own lorries on a whim in protest at not getting access to what it wants-our sea why do you want a deal at all?The alternative isWTO like the majority of our trade that doesn’t require 20,000 pages of accompanying red tape.The booklet said no CU/SM
1341849476454100992 2020-12-24 04:53:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Janela_X Will he vote for a leave deal or make it no deal?
1341848854505897993 2020-12-24 04:51:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Harvest93573301 @13sarahmurphy Most of the remain contamination was removed from the party last year ... mainly strong leavers in the party... you overlook the 80 seat majority👍🏻will be useful.
1341848437898301440 2020-12-24 04:49:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Bill_Esterson Because they’re not British *ucking lorry drivers.Macron has trapped them here it’s nothing to do with Boris. They can’t go to France in case they have COVID so why would Boris mix with them &amp; in case labour, irrelevant as it is has gone to sleep for 5 years Boris is negotiating

1341837559123615749 2020-12-24 04:06:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant Are the other 58 trade deals Liz Truss has signed up 20,000 pages long?How many involve a treaty, political declaration, give the other party restrictive trade powers, subject us to their laws &amp; surrender fishing rights?Do we even have enough fish to bribe everyone with?
1341835707845926912 2020-12-24 03:58:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @nicnacpaddi @UKlPVoter @Nigel_Farage Are you part of the negotiation team or VDLs best friend with this extra insight?

1341834115054710785 2020-12-24 03:52:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> @UKlPVoter @nicnacpaddi @Nigel_Farage Why would anyone vote leave to take control in tiers and surrender 66% of our fish? Nonsense...
1341833859114151938 2020-12-24 03:51:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @nicnacpaddi @Nigel_Farage Boris has been in direct talks with VDL she was given the job for  a reason. She is a cow.

They reaffirmed any prejudice and wariness people had if them.Sikhs are peaceful, respectful and fit in with British values. The other mob are just uneducated vandals and yobs with no self control that cannot mix in peaceful tolerant societies

1341762672086413312 2020-12-23 23:08:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt @BorisJohnson Verhofstadts vision of a future with what you keep calling out friends and allies. @Conservatives #NoDealBrexit
1341762337825566720 2020-12-23 23:07:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> I would rather @Conservatives bought @BorisJohnson down if he comes back with a punishment deal of surrender, compromise and concessions than see a deal passed. The past 48 hours shows us all what the long  term disruption plan is...
1341761438067601410 2020-12-23 23:03:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> So having locked EU lorries out of Europe Macron agrees they can enter with a negative lateral flow test. A test of only 50% accuracy in SYMPTOMATIC covid. Border shut for about 48 hrs...5 day incubation period, 5 more to show symptoms, so any +Ive cases entered the U.K. with it
1341759707090972672 2020-12-23 22:56:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant Why is the EU planning that if UK government hasn’t scrutinised, ratified &amp; voted on anything?what’s Boris saying that makes them plan this?Not looking good on Conservatives at all.Nothing from Boris or Frost for days including denying stuff like this.Just offering more fish

Tough. We out numbered you &amp; stopped it 👍🏻🇬🇧😂❤️🔵

That was  agreed because EU supposedly wanted a trade deal, UK signed in good faith. By the way, we voted for 100% of our fish, borders, migration control, British laws, Parliamentary sovereignty and no concessions 👍🏻🇬🇧
1341736417291071488 2020-12-23 21:24:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Harvest93573301 @13sarahmurphy Whatever you voted for got far less votes. That’s how democracy works. We all understand elections and voting. Constantly voted out of the EU...
1341736000444379138 2020-12-23 21:22:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Martru50 The EU will be long gone,the stronger Boris is the better...theres more sick &amp; tired of being dictated to,sanctioned. It’s a German power block of control. Covid showed what it is about ...all about  power,did nothing to help any struggling member. It’s about to fall ...
1341732779147587584 2020-12-23 21:09:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Martru50 He thinks students can win it in 10 yrs...everything they demand in negotiation our fish etc is all long term funding for around 10 yrs.Basically they are trying to negociate a deal where UK provides enough cash flow to keep the EU afloat till the brainwashed bribed can vote🙄🇬🇧

The deal the EU offer is utter horse shit 🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣👍🏻🤣🤣🤣
1341730983356346368 2020-12-23 21:02:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> @exRAF_Al @TiceRichard For nothing... they could never,ever be staffed .The NHS was so desperate before this, let alone having to deal with alot more acutely ill &amp; ITU patients and run sites as two hospitals covid/clean services, that absolute idiot overlooked medical manpower. He’s aptly named.
1341730215488319488 2020-12-23 20:59:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TiceRichard 😱Have you any idea what level of knowledge the medics/nurses need? ITU is the most skilled specialty in the profession.The drugs &amp; machines they are responsible for require constant updates /training for. You cannot bring a few retired staff back and get them to do the job.

It happened and its real, it’s really happening now and there’s really more happening next Friday ... and in reality there’s even more about to happen. You won’t like it but most of us really love it ❤️🔵🇬🇧
1341728117442932737 2020-12-23 20:51:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> @13sarahmurphy It’s not,the moronic left wing, bed wetting,woke remainers are the problem. Weak &amp; anti their own country. Good job they are the minority... thats why no matter what  Boris gets wrong he’s still better then anything else on the political front. Years of Tory UK ahead of you👍🏻🔵🇬🇧
1341727019978149890 2020-12-23 20:47:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ABridgen Why exactly is Boris trying to negotiate a trade deal with people of that mentality for when WTO is the alternative &amp; works perfectly well for the rest of our trade. It’s pathetic that this advantage hasn’t been used to concluded this months ago.

1341720602579755010 2020-12-23 20:21:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> Given the malicious,vindictive,  childish actions of the EU, in particular dickhead @EmmanuelMacron it is proof beyond doubt we are right to leave the EU,right to not sign a trade deal &amp; shows we need to find new non EU suppliers which won’t be subject to punishment blockades 🇬🇧
1341719280061194242 2020-12-23 20:16:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Stop_The_EU Well it didn’t work then did it... British people got rid of that cretin Blair and the EU
1341718933699764225 2020-12-23 20:14:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @kitmalthouse You wanted  an entanglement trade deal which allows that areshole alot of say &amp; control over Britain as a non EU state. You might consider that in the future when no doubt some grubby power grab written to be abused by the EU will wend your way.
1341718371428134912 2020-12-23 20:12:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @jeremycorbyn And Jeremy what magic answer do you have to offer to make covid vanish overnight that NOBODY else in the ENTIRE WORLD of science and medicine hasn’t thought of? My guess is fuck all as usual. In the spirit of Christmas give us all a break from more guff tweets.
1341676730323492870 2020-12-23 17:27:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @UKnoGum @davidschneider We are holding all the cards and not being bullied by the EU. We are a non member because it’s what most of us want . There is a trade deal available nothing more. If they want to loose the export market here that is fine.
1341676220757499905 2020-12-23 17:25:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> @davidschneider Why should British government feed truck drivers?France has locked out those drivers of their own countries.Not the British tax payers job to feed them and it’s not our fault France has a *ucking nutter running it. I note you personally don’t think it’s your job to feed them.
1341675413152653312 2020-12-23 17:22:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> Good to see government has planned for border issues. Well planned, good to see it works well even when it’s only Macron being a twat and locking his own lorries out in temper...🇬🇧

1341530251512467456 2020-12-23 07:45:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @lucyallan I hope MPs have seen exactly how the EU will use any deal they agree to, the WA and political declaration. This is how dangerous, petty and malicious the EU is. Treaties are intended to be used to punish Britain and make it impossible for MPs to run the country. Walk away now 🇬🇧
1341528300691349506 2020-12-23 07:37:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> 2000 pages of treaty enshrined entanglement does not sound like the leave we voted for @Conservatives #NoDealBrexit

1341508363071467522 2020-12-23 06:18:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> @geoffreygriff16 @BarbuUn @Conservatives We’re relying on a leave parliament to not pass anything horrendous. That WA and declaration should never have been bought back to parliament And MPs should never have passed it. Parliament is the deciding factor overall should a deal come back.
1341470605422551047 2020-12-23 03:48:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s very simple @Conservatives if you cannot deliver freedom from the EU, taking back our seas and get a trade deal as the EUs biggest export market, in 54 months with an 80 seat majority,won to deliver that, the party is done for forever.We will get it,we don’t care about party
1341469645644165121 2020-12-23 03:44:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SimonClarkeMP Should any deal end up on Parliament I hope you will vote it down accordingly. We not need that as a trade partner. Putting up punishment blockades and creating blackmail borders. Time to move forward and keep the EU as far away as possible. It is the British enemy.

You’ve have set the left wing boomers off in a frenzy of outrage . At least treat your own people with a bit of decency.

1341428915605303296 2020-12-23 01:02:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> So the way I see this EU negotiation is the EU wants to loose its biggest export market. That’s a lot of cars, wine,cheese,brandy,olives, satsumas and not forgetting that all important  ‘lettuce’ they need to shift elsewhere. Barnier needs to turn into Del Boy Trotter ... 🇬🇧🔵
1341428067751915520 2020-12-23 00:59:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> @GentlemanGeorge More  EU borders, blockades, barriers , bullshit  and bollocks🙄

The EU ... the only trade block to set up punishment barricades. 🇬🇧🔵#NoDealBrexit #PunishEU
1341393347148214273 2020-12-22 22:41:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> Presumably these 1500 lorries stuck in Kent are from Europe &amp;Macron has locked his own civilians out of their country as a punishment to Britain not caving. Not trade related checks filling Kent &amp; presumably UK lorry drivers haven’t gone along just got the fun if it #NoDealBrexit

1341136192855826439 2020-12-22 05:39:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Labour4EU We haven’t lost anything . We took back control of it all. We will govern our own country and live by our laws without the *ucking bullshit from unelected Brussels beurocrats. Love it. Freedom is running our own country. That’s why we beat remain... 🇬🇧👍🏻

1341134898569031686 2020-12-22 05:34:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy Disproportionately a certain sector are responsible for crime.Blame the offenders not the justice system. Nobody is forced to be a criminal it’s choice &amp; lifestyle. Do something about tackling it &amp; stopping it.Teach kids in your community to respect laws,values &amp; right from wrong
1341133513240834049 2020-12-22 05:28:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> @jessphillips You have no professionalism In the first place and you are having a melt over the fact we are leaving with no deal. It’s was better when you did it silently. #NoDeal 🇬🇧🔵❤️
1341131775880380422 2020-12-22 05:21:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @FabQu_ @Bob__Hudson We love our borders thanks . Heard it’s going well in the EU, suppliers stuck with truck loads of fresh produce.
1341128166958649344 2020-12-22 05:07:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Stu__F @shashj @fact_covid Try reading the peer review research based BMJ articles. A lot of reasesrch available . PCR testing is inaccurate and give lots of  false positives. PCR testing wasn’t created for COVID it’s been around for years .
1341126241949278208 2020-12-22 04:59:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidJoBrexit The last 24 hours proves we need to be free from the scheming ,malicious toxic block @EU_Commission what a bunch of tossers you are. #NoDealBrexit
1341079553289105409 2020-12-22 01:54:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DehennaDavison @ManufacturingUK 54 months of the EU playing games. Nothing can be agreed . They want us to cave and continue ruling us.  Ellwood needs kicking out of the party.
1341078866178301953 2020-12-22 01:51:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Stu__F @shashj @fact_covid The gene test is not designed to test covid. It cannot isolate it and doesn’t know if it is detecting covid or old dead COVID cells. Thank you . I have my information from medical journals

Enough of this funding the EU &amp;!being a vassal state.If it’s no deal now it’s no deal.The deadline is reached.And this stunt blocking people from the U.K. under the pretence of COVID proves how right we are 🇬🇧
1340810321401966592 2020-12-21 08:04:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Stu__F @shashj @fact_covid The man who designed PCR test said it’s no good for this... it’s a genetic test...

1340809308901158917 2020-12-21 08:00:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can anyone explain track &amp; trace to me ...the bit where nurses go to work &amp; switch it off,work with COVID patients protected by a magic tissue paper mask which at best protects a covid pt from a non covid staff member.Thousands of staff catch it at work but are not in that system
1340807876902793216 2020-12-21 07:54:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @shashj @Stu__F We are using the very unreliable PCR test... it seems to ‘make things up’ sooner than ‘pick them up’
1340807396705316866 2020-12-21 07:52:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RabHutchison I’d say labour MPs kneeling  in cow fields voted for him.

1340806708088762368 2020-12-21 07:50:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @abline11 Sounds like another civil servant stunt to discredit government. No wonder they didn’t want to publish it... it’s clearly bull shit.
1340806121183965187 2020-12-21 07:47:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> Seems tonights little plan from the @EU_Commission is that they will stop freight to create chaos &amp; disruption at Christmas when people are pissed off with government,in a last ditch attempt to force Britain to cave.The sooner we dump this bunch of silly twats the better🔵🇬🇧
1340804421261864961 2020-12-21 07:40:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can anyone explain how China was first to have COVID,WHO let it spread all over till March,it was contained in Wuhan for a mth then ‘gone’ overnight,no more deaths/cases with no vaccine &amp; yet the rest of the works has been locked down &amp; its rampaging on &amp; death rates rocketing🤔
1340802598098657281 2020-12-21 07:33:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock Well done...the entire country locked up for Christmas, the public hating the party and now the EU grounding flights and blocking euro tunnel over this. Don’t mind that bit . Start by explaining how you cannot isolate COVID from flu but you can one particular strain of COVID.
1340793231622213632 2020-12-21 06:56:31 +0800 <trixie_2000> @darrengrimes_ @Higgseye Anyone who says your controversial just doesn’t like what you say because they are hanging onto the far left political spectrum.
1340792825726853120 2020-12-21 06:54:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> Is it just direct flights from the UK the EU are banning or can people go via other countries? I’ve only heard flights from here , nothing about people. Not that I’m going anywhere near that hell hole...
1340792248880013313 2020-12-21 06:52:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales At least they’ve not mentioned giving us a few more of our own fish since 5pm🇬🇧

1340699764762030087 2020-12-21 00:45:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> We spent the entire bloody year listening to Boris’s bloody experts &amp; their stupid bloody ideas,gone along with face &amp; space,isolate,lockdown, paper masks,tiers &amp; no toilet roll to save Christmas &amp; the arseholes give people 6 HRS warning to national lock for following THEIR rules

1340695990844731397 2020-12-21 00:30:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LaraCrabb @mmjblair Oh I thought Wuhan was in China. I thought Chiba told WHO about this last December and I thought China gave the pharmaceuticals the genetic code of COVID ... I would say it’s everything to do with bloody China.
1340694747657236481 2020-12-21 00:25:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @zarahsultana People that have just been paid for a year to do nothing, as soon as the country is back to work Labour want more fully paid days off...
1340694402554060801 2020-12-21 00:23:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> Zero covid... why hasn’t anyone else in the world come up with this idea? You just need a strategy.
1340693509465104390 2020-12-21 00:20:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @zarahsultana Your are permentally outraged. You don’t understand politics, economics or British people.

1340675039033778177 2020-12-20 23:06:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DominicRaab Exactly what freedoms are you referring to?The entire country is locked up &amp; cannot day certain words or state facts without being accused,threatened and locked up. And it’s happening under Conservatives. I’m voting for the ‘far right’, centre Party Nigel fronts from now on.
1340647458284707842 2020-12-20 21:17:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock Your trying to recruit non medical members of the public to deliver vaccines with the NHS volunteer thing. You are dangerous and more unhinged by the day... I don’t trust you. You are a compulsive little man liar, no wonder the public don’t trust you at all.

1340641920037490689 2020-12-20 20:55:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @leehayward1970 It’s getting more like mad cow disease everyday. They haven’t got a clue who has actually got old covid or had it, they can’t isolate covid from flu and now they can pin point people with the new super covid Hancock invented in Thursday FFS🤦🏼‍♀️
1340612240475639809 2020-12-20 18:57:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DehennaDavison I was a Tory. I don’t back this,the public don’t trust Boris because he’s using ropey advisers like Ferguson &amp; unreliable ‘evidence’.Their advice has led us to this.We all know about great Reset.This will finish the party.Boris has signed another EU treaty,won’t walk away &amp; this
1340611089709604872 2020-12-20 18:52:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson What new infection prevention measures are you putting in place to protect the NHS staff working with this ‘new strain’? still the ill fitting paper mask that’s effective for surgical procedures for 20 minutes?Not proven use whatsoever ever against respiratory virus
1340609538484031488 2020-12-20 18:46:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ClaudiaWebbe Keep schools open or else we will have a generation kids deprived of education that are so thick they can only structure a two word sentence together containing 6 letters like labour MPs.Kids have mild to no symptoms,well over 99.999% of survival. Open schools.Get rid of labour🔵
1340604898744909826 2020-12-20 18:28:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TBayfield How can 37,000 migrants exist here without anyone knowing where they are? We need an NI number for everything. And nobody can live off of nothing. This stinks of that tier of civil servants working against government who will call the MPs bullies when confronted over this.
1340596251008638977 2020-12-20 17:53:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @zatzi If we are all locked up how can anyone get the vaccine?
1340595521975672832 2020-12-20 17:50:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> Surely after millions have had covid with or without symptoms,probably millions more than we know about we must be getting closer to herd immunity despite SAGE interference in trying to stop nature sorting it out its mutated to spread easier &amp; faster. People only get it once.
1340594372665065473 2020-12-20 17:46:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JCinhisworld @Daily_Express It would be an admission of failure on Hancocks part.They were set up &amp; had equipment but NHS needed its staff even in lockdown 1.There’s simply not enough specialised staff &amp; you can’t solve it by getting retired nurses back on the register. Hancock is an idiot with a big ego

Maybe a real journalist could research what happened in the Wuhan laboratory that released this Chiba virus into the world?
1340579829633179648 2020-12-20 16:48:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JCinhisworld @Daily_Express They weren’t fully activated. They never had staff.The asked each NHS hospital to send staff,so that’s senior specialist A&amp;E staff,ITU staff because the patients were going to be ventilated.Hospitals didn’t have any to send thats why it was quietly packed away &amp; not mentioned now
1340578550273945602 2020-12-20 16:43:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BrexitBetrayed What does deadline actually mean to the EU idiots?
1340578252348420096 2020-12-20 16:42:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Conservatives @BorisJohnson Having followed the advice of SAGE since this started can you explain why after 9 months the entire country is in lockdown 3/4 because the NHS is in crisis? What kind of fucking ‘experts’ are they to create this absolute mess?Maybe try new ‘experts’
1340575612621217794 2020-12-20 16:31:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SimonClarkeMP COVID is diagnosed with unreliable PCR test that even the man who made them said they aren’t designed for this use. So far they haven’t isolated Covid,pick up old ‘dead’ covid &amp; flu is counted in covid stats. Now your telling us they can isolate &amp; diagnose a new COVID?Give over.
1340573073469296642 2020-12-20 16:21:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MokeyTheFraggle @Daily_Express Are they working with COVID and the acutely I’ll pts? That’s where pressure is. You can’t increase ITU capacity because you need the skilled workforce to provide the care.
1340572632392056833 2020-12-20 16:19:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JCinhisworld @Daily_Express No staff...can’t staff NHS let alone additional hospitals.They could use private hospitals for non COVID though...they are staffed. It’s true the NHS is in a mess. It’s not about beds. Each is running like 2 seperate hospitals covid/nonCOVID.It’s spreading the workforce.
1340571339636305920 2020-12-20 16:14:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @spoonersean @PFr1end If my bag hasn’t been packed it would of been in 5 minutes and I would be leaving like everyone else.
1340570814442332165 2020-12-20 16:12:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> Have they created a test that isolates this new Coronovirus? It sounds like it was an idea that dropped out of Hancock’s gob as a last resort to bully us into getting vaccinated. Which incident they just know it responds to.
1340568362863243264 2020-12-20 16:02:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sajidjavid If you were using a reliable test, Ferguson wasn’t involved AGAIN and you were using real experts you might of got away with it. You’ve lost millions of voters overnight ... we don’t want life ‘reset’ like this. Tories have got to go...
1340567258398121984 2020-12-20 15:58:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s bad enough living in England but imagine being Welsh and having this bat shit crazy idiot in charge... bad as Scotland . These deranged governments need abolishing
1340440663465324553 2020-12-20 07:35:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> So we should. Enough is enough. Tell them we’re done #NoDealBrexit
1340440187294367745 2020-12-20 07:33:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> Is there a petition to get that twat Neil left Wing resides up Barniers arse Ferguson barred from advising government?I want to sign it. The divisive little shit is behind this and frankly Boris should chose his advisers more wisely, preferably not ones aiming to destroy him.
1340438653663899653 2020-12-20 07:27:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> God , please let this be true🙏🏻
1340437822981992456 2020-12-20 07:24:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @CathJohnstone3 Is your daughter at high risk if she gets it? If not it’s a question of you taking a risk... base it on who you care about most.
1340437148986724352 2020-12-20 07:21:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Peston No question, they need educating &amp; if they get it have mild to no symptoms &amp; practically 100%  recovery.Schools need to be open ... it’s a virus...nature knows what to do to sort it.Protect the most vulnerable while herd immunity develops... which was plan A until WHO interfered
1340436338257092617 2020-12-20 07:18:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MatthewStadlen Be realistic . Mr Bent leg can’t even put an opposition together. Labour are done for... no place in government for any second rate labour candidates. Whatever happens it’s nowhere near the disaster Labour would  of created by now from up Barniers backside🇬🇧🔵
1340396660434874370 2020-12-20 04:40:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> @campbellclaret Not the worst. It could of been the Catastrophic shower of Shit Jo Swinsons party ... a year ago she told us she would be in charge by now... or Captain Hindsight Kneel Alots lot... 🤣🤣🤣 🇬🇧🔵
1340395878805360640 2020-12-20 04:37:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> If anyone’s pissed off about Christmas don’t blame Boris, blame China
1340395633975451648 2020-12-20 04:36:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> There may be restrictions but Christmas is not cancelled. It’ll still happen.Maybe we can have a quiet Christmas &amp; think about what really matters,it will be what we make it. Value the old traditions ... it doesn’t need to be all parties and going out. Christmas happened 1939-45
1340393693212258307 2020-12-20 04:28:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Keir_Starmer Captain Hindsight has been calling for more restriction, Boris has had to do it today based on huge rise in spread in the south and the hospital’s at crisis point. So Kneel-a lot Hindsight is now is opposing the very thing he proposed a few days ago... what a drippy twat he is.
1340392339592912897 2020-12-20 04:23:31 +0800 <trixie_2000> @adilray @talkRADIO It is a fact we a Christian country.
1340378781232603143 2020-12-20 03:29:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BrendanChilton Motion:We the British people have no alternative but to have confidence in Her Majestrys Government.The only alternative is far left extremists who dug the country into a financial hell hole last time &amp; screwed all public services. #NoDealBrexit is what the British people want🇬🇧
1340351833341083648 2020-12-20 01:42:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Chris______k @DavidDavisMP No a mistake. We love Brexit. ❤️🇬🇧👍🏻
1340351607599448069 2020-12-20 01:41:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @PointlessBrexit @DavidDavisMP See @DavidDavisMP even remainers wanted time to prepare for no deal.
1340351403483656198 2020-12-20 01:40:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Pace1013 @DavidDavisMP You confuse majorly with extremism. Just because you don’t appreciate the benefit of being free from the EU doesn’t make it extremist that the majority of us do. It simply makes you the minority and the minority doesn’t get its own way. 🇬🇧👍🏻
1340350677894246400 2020-12-20 01:37:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidDavisMP This is not acceptable to British people. No deal should of been announced months ago &amp; focus on getting ready not piffling about with ‘go to the government website’. Conservatives have gone along with EU in this,conceding here,there &amp; everywhere. What kind of idiots are you all?
1340342030757715968 2020-12-20 01:03:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> If covid has mutated will the vaccine work or is it to late. Is COVID a gremlin ? Waits until the exact day vaccine is launched and then the next day it changes. Can you believe it?
1340340673661308928 2020-12-20 00:58:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SkyNews We’ll take action. In the form of our naval ships . You’ve been warned.
1340340231552315393 2020-12-20 00:56:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MollieW152 You are his carer and nominate family members to care for him throughout this. It doesn’t count as visiting,it’s providing essential support to ensure his health and meet his care needs... both physical and psychological. We all need to do this... tiers and lockdowns come second
1340329417508327427 2020-12-20 00:13:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> @paulafr68963440 *uck off... English, most used language in the world. Nobody much bothers with French ...
1340324480263057408 2020-12-19 23:53:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> @leehayward1970 Does this go on with people in tiers four going to tiers three shopping until eventually covid is spread sufficiently to unite everyone in tier four and Matt Hancock can leap up and shout Ta-Da  now bringing in tier 5?
1340323557876916225 2020-12-19 23:50:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> What will tier 4 involve? Welding the locks on your doors like they did in China to imprison you?   One thing Covid has proved is Britain is overpopulated and the disease however it came about has taken nature’s advantage...
1340306220599619587 2020-12-19 22:41:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> @adilray Bit of an education. The most important Christian time of year is not Christmas it is Easter. At Easter we didn’t go to church or visit family or meet anyone to celebrate Jesus Christ rising from the dead.
1340277354992717825 2020-12-19 20:46:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RichardBurgon He comes Captain Hindsight’s deputy boot polisher. we can’t live under lockdown forever you absolute fool.British people do not want to live like that.99% survival rate.Main problem here is NHS plans &amp; shapes  services 25 yrs ahead. Pity labour cut beds,services &amp; hospitals
1340240782238896128 2020-12-19 18:21:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> @brianmlucey @danyaldhondy @Colin00007 @tconnellyRTE @SaltyDuchess Yes the flaw is the EU thinking it can negotiator Ruth British fish. It can’t. It’s ours and we took it back. Our fishing communities will be alive. I don’t eat fish is another flaw in your argument.
1340240248576630785 2020-12-19 18:19:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> @brianmlucey We chose sovereignty as the greatest prize... don’t need anyone telling us the EU is a better option. It’s not. And that is why British people voted to leave and voted in a massive 80 seat majority leave government 🇬🇧
1340239610752974848 2020-12-19 18:16:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @brianmlucey @danyaldhondy @Colin00007 @tconnellyRTE @SaltyDuchess We only get 20% of our catch. 100 % in 13 days. Wiping out the jobs of all those EU fishermen pillaging our waters... Brexit is great. Love it 👍🏻
1340239042512891906 2020-12-19 18:14:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Independent Maybe ministers should of stood up to farmers who ignored all the British applicants last year and wanted to carry on with cheap dirty foreign labourers.
1340236383802306560 2020-12-19 18:03:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @bakerstherald @tconnellyRTE What currency will you be using? Fish ?
1340236144492089344 2020-12-19 18:02:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> @danyaldhondy @Colin00007 @tconnellyRTE @SaltyDuchess We can sell our fish globally , thanks for the irrelevant contribution of yours. You’ll find Barnier offered us 40 %of our own fish actually and that was a no as well 👍🏻
1340161164068712449 2020-12-19 13:04:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Juliest101 We don’t need telling by government who we can see OK?We voted the biggest majority government in years in for this reason. We can think for ourselves, we are not stupid. Most of us are not gullible needy socialists👍🏻
1340160085201473536 2020-12-19 13:00:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Keir_Starmer @ChurchTimes From Sir Knee-bend-a lot who spent the summer bending to looters , rioters and thieves in honour of Mr Career Criminal died full of amphetamines

1340053347143995392 2020-12-19 05:56:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt @MichelBarnier Idiot. You are not family . You are the enemy.

If you think behaving like tossers and your PATHETIC threats of queues and the other bullshit will make us change our mind it won’t. We are more determined than ever to be free from your dictatorship of fraud, corruption &amp; bullying 🇬🇧
1339992178605641731 2020-12-19 01:53:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock @ONS Not sure what light or which of your tunnels you’re referring to... seriously, you are recruiting members of the public to vaccinate people? Had an email from nhs volunteer service about this. Have you lost your mind?
1339991604417982467 2020-12-19 01:51:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DelphinePalmow1 Sorry ... I’m working! Have done now!
1339926204506357760 2020-12-18 21:31:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Keir_Starmer You doubled council tax, you trebled house prices, you created 2007 recession, higher unemployment when you left ,you started an illegal war and sold off the countries assets and gold for next to nothing ... LABOURs legacy. You really are a useless cretin.
1339715672142729219 2020-12-18 07:34:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SueC00K My guess is both are true. Each hospital is running as two. One where there is COVID &amp; likely COVID and one side where they try to keep it free from covid for things like surgery and wards for non covid. They may have capacity but running more services spreading staff very thin.
1339714913137274880 2020-12-18 07:31:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> From what we can see restrictions and lockdowns spread COVID. The numbers go up each time they buggar about with these .
1339714489118277633 2020-12-18 07:29:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Keir_Starmer I know... what the hell are the parents doing not feeding their kids? I also note when it suits you now we are the 6th biggest economy but when it’s connected with the EU we are an insignificant trade island.
1339693925053960192 2020-12-18 06:08:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidGHFrost @BorisJohnson @vonderleyen Stand by the WTO exit from this hideous farce , it will be a success... it would be a gift from remain. We do not need the EU🇬🇧
1339693311356002304 2020-12-18 06:05:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @zarahsultana It’s shameful that parents don’t feed their own kids but that doesn’t seem to bother you. I’m a single parent very low income family. Priority 1/2/3 roof over our head, food &amp; heating.We don’t have weird eyebrows,Botox or plastic nails, tattoos, a 50” TV and a load of other crap
1339692309596811265 2020-12-18 06:01:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant What else has been agreed? The other 97% of the deal... that’s never mentioned.
1339691928787562498 2020-12-18 06:00:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Conservatives @BorisJohnson she’s saying you’ve backed down again as it’s the only way substantial progress would be made...
1339691500440068097 2020-12-18 05:58:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Athbheochan God knows whose behind this. The nurses I know have got reams of training to do and medicines regulator says it should only be given where there are resuscitation facilities! What could go wrong?
1339690580687925248 2020-12-18 05:54:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LilyRos21353815 @tconnellyRTE @EU_Commission Ohhh... remain overload... staring at no deal 🇬🇧
1339621789413076996 2020-12-18 01:21:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @GrahamF_1956 I’m sure they were &amp; there are roles for volunteers but they shouldn’t be giving the jab, nhs staff have to have a lengthy list of competencies including legal responsibility and emergeny life support &amp; anaphylaxis training to give it and have a resuscitation facility available
1339618675855417349 2020-12-18 01:09:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Tobias_Ellwood You do not need to have ‘dinners’ . What you should of done is have a telephone update or a teleconference. You are a hypocrite and political disgrace. As bad as Burley and Rigsby .
1339616486411935745 2020-12-18 01:00:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> Had email from NHS volunteers service... recruiting members of the public to administer the vaccines😳  https://t.co/yMG18qy3mW
1339611572759617537 2020-12-18 00:41:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EU_Commission @vonderleyen tight bastards... but it shows the EU has no money ... 🇬🇧
1339592820336652294 2020-12-17 23:26:31 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Rozkez67 I think the EU are waking up and taking Boris seriously. He hasn’t backed down and agreed to there concessions. Who cares what you think. You are not a world leader. 58 new trade deals agreed with him as our leader. You are looking very very  silly
1339581319810961415 2020-12-17 22:40:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> I have trouble reading Boris is he being sarcastic? Hope he’s having a good laugh at old Fish thief...
1339580366521135104 2020-12-17 22:37:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @tconnellyRTE This the response to Boris sending Parliament home today until New Year. @EU_Commission always a day behind Britain with its tit for tat response
1339578522994696193 2020-12-17 22:29:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RishiSunak Some of us have worked twice the number of hours we normally do since April covering for people to be doing nothing for 80% pay. Time to end this nonsense and get everything open and back to work. Us workers are bloody knackered. This is unfair .
1339565449789530113 2020-12-17 21:37:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @CleanAirLondon @sandralaville @rosamund_ElsFdn @JocelynCockburn @HJAcivillibs Any chance of a front page and a #justiceForEmilyJones @guardian ?

1339561070621503490 2020-12-17 21:20:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TiceRichard Like last time there are no specialist medical, respiratory and ITU Drs and nurses to run them.
1339560654492069888 2020-12-17 21:18:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> Remain in major meltdown,what kind of actual stupid point is she even trying to make,Leaping about &amp; screeching. She makes a good case for remain psychopathy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🇬🇧🤣🤣🇬🇧@Konnie_Huq ?I think using the media to expose the true extent of remain incoherence &amp; depravity
1339521255599448067 2020-12-17 18:42:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @pritipatel it’s not good enough for you to continue the cover up. No doubt Conservatives have played their part in hiding this &amp; allowing it to continue but Labour are far worse. For the sake of those girls and to protect the next generation publish it all. Break the chain...
1339519087869915137 2020-12-17 18:33:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> I wouldn’t contact them again ...
1339517851795922945 2020-12-17 18:28:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> @UKLabour putting illiterate, uneducated chavs in Parliament  😖
1339346794350833664 2020-12-17 07:08:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattWalshBlog What a piss take...and in the next breath they will be complaining because they are the high risk category, they should be disciplined by their trust and professional bodies for bringing it into disrepute.
1339346041024499712 2020-12-17 07:05:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TiceRichard What makes it different this yr is trying to run a clean &amp; an infection site.Basically each hospital is two. Give them a break,these poor Drs &amp; nurses have had months of shite, cancelled leave,mountains of new rules &amp; red tape,bloody hellish PPE and people are dying from it
1339344712944193545 2020-12-17 07:00:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> Hopefully that will make her think twice about wanting to come back here.
1339344356696858624 2020-12-17 06:59:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales I never understood why Wales voted leave and then voted in a load of Labour remain MPs. What was that all about 🤷‍♀️
1339343976889978881 2020-12-17 06:57:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s fair to say the do not want a ‘level playing field’,they want to use a trade deal to manipulate,control, bully &amp; dictate to UK. It’s a clause they want to give themselves an advantage &amp; to restrict UK opportunity.They intend to abuse it &amp; would answer to no one but themself
1339342449370685446 2020-12-17 06:51:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> Boris isn’t telling anyone to visit anyone at Christmas he’s merely given people the opportunity to take responsibility for themselves and can only hope they make wise choices.
1339341885933035526 2020-12-17 06:49:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ruth_wishart Where did people go before food banks we ask? What is bad is to have a family you cannot provide for. We have a very generous benefit system. Unfortunately where there’s freebies there’s always demand that will outstrip provision.
1339330024013434880 2020-12-17 06:02:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> The SNP fo not have the very basic social skills required to be in Britain’s Parliament. I’ve seen zoo animals with more self control, discipline and manners.

We never voted to rearrange our borders and that bogus little crank needs putting in her place. Enough of this division. We are Great Britain , and Britain is going to be great 🇬🇧❤️
1339328265299877889 2020-12-17 05:55:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> Mr Remain up Barniers bum just ignoring the inconvenience of the pandemic and partying as normal . It’s time Boris took him to one side for a quiet ‘chat’. Is there nothing the shameful little turd hasn’t done to embarrass his party this week?

1339150840964190212 2020-12-16 18:10:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @bernardjenkin Maybe you could just lower the fees for the British students? Fund public sector courses. After all you need educated people in this country,let’s take some of the financial burden away and invest in our own people. New idea I know but times are changing 🇬🇧
1339150214712729601 2020-12-16 18:07:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MPIainDS How has this happened? and labour only had power for 13 yrs so alot of this falls with Tories. You have a lot of work to do to put things right.

1339137651635523584 2020-12-16 17:17:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SarahOwen_ The Lab. Party need to move on from this continual obsession of race hatred. You’re an undesirable party for this very obsession. You appear to have no political direction as a party what so ever &amp; are stuck in an echo chamber of hate.The hate comes from you to mask your failings
1339136532939218945 2020-12-16 17:13:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @johnredwood We need less houses and more investment in schools, hospitals, roads, all public services and amenities. The public are sending that message very loudly and very clearly.

1338962416764416001 2020-12-16 05:41:31 +0800 <trixie_2000> @heraldscotland Good . Now ask every NHS trust the same question .

The EU has started its abuse of declaration and WA and got it’s own way when government said we would change our law to override what was agreed in good faith. Good faith deals only occur when parties are decent, honest &amp; equal. EU deals are disaster.
1338961448320512007 2020-12-16 05:37:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MirrorPolitics That is exactly why we voted to keep this EU nonce out of the negotiation. Bloody great prat.
1338805312556568577 2020-12-15 19:17:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> The next remainer that asks me what tangible benefit I personally get from leaving the EU gets both barrels. The UK can ditch the *ucking silly power limitation on a hoover a the piss awful dim light bulbs. And thats why I voted leave...

1338753395809808386 2020-12-15 15:50:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> If Conservatives agree another deal with the EU we know @BorisJohnson has sold us out.We also know he has intentionally put barriers in the way for U.K. to make the best of Brexit.That tells me Conservatives do not want sovereignty &amp; they do not want to run the UK #NoDealBrexit🇬🇧
1338751687725637635 2020-12-15 15:44:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @johnredwood Maybe Boris could consider that before making all the cars on U.K. electric. He does have a lot of stupid ideas.

1338250627860865025 2020-12-14 06:33:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> Things were far more credible in the early days before SAGE was hijaked by remain scientists with the aim of punishing us and creating as much economic damage as possible. Things seemed to change when it was reported Boris met with Me Hatchett man with a plan him self Bill Gates.

1338173223503060996 2020-12-14 01:25:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant We didn’t vote leave &amp; give Tories an 80 seat majority for them to use fishing &amp; our sea as a bargaining chip.This plays no part in a trade deal negotiation. Stick to WTO deal, don’t give the EU a preferential export market. Put them on a competitive playing field with no perks.
1338170027011420162 2020-12-14 01:12:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> So Elwood wants to just agree to the EU offer and ‘go back to it at a later date and adjust it’ the absolute *ucking idiot... how stupid are remain?They just talk endless utter shit.  Why conservatives haven’t told him to shit his gob I’ve no idea.

1338130374166253568 2020-12-13 22:35:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson If the UK will do very well either way why are you still in discussions with the EU that openly wants to punish us for leaving?WTO is the preferred deal and then you can focus on the WA &amp; declaration that was agreed on the basis the EU would be fair and respectful. It was neither

1338070089921409024 2020-12-13 18:35:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @tconnellyRTE They wouldn’t be impressed , they intended to carry on fishing in our sea while Britain watched on. The last thing they expected was Britain using military control to stop them. They are still under the illusion they are God like untouchable beings doing whatever they like.

It was lost before you even had chance to say ‘campaign’... your seat was won in 2015 based on the Tory manifesto to have an in/out referendum.

It then spent 2 years working with the EU &amp; other parties undermining Brexit,creating laws to block it &amp; looking to reverse it. Your voters dumped you rotten liars

UK left the EU &amp; as such leavers lost you that money spinner. 2nd I can’t think beyond other equally odious EU knobs of anything less gentlemanly and frankly I struggle to think of anyone I would less want to stand near.
1337869308014243852 2020-12-13 05:17:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> I wonder if it involves spring bulb planting? Don’t know how I will be able to sleep tonight... the excitement of a labour project...

It backfired and now we’re moving Navy ships in.
1337867463397171201 2020-12-13 05:10:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> Got to be said @Keir_Starmer has got the charisma of a stinking mouldy old slipper.The Conservatives are doing what they we elected to do and that is exactly why labour voters crossed the line &amp; Tories have an 80 majority. How DARE you accuse the voter of holding Britain back🔵🇬🇧
1337866462401323010 2020-12-13 05:06:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> We don’t want you to be next prime minister @Conservatives @Mike_Fabricant smashed it last time 80 majority.Rock the polls with no deal. Best place for you is isolation.Preferably silently.Dont foresee Labour getting many seats in my entire life time if Boris sticks #NoDeal🇬🇧🔵❤️
1337864997809123330 2020-12-13 05:00:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> You lot have been campaigning since 2014. Since then you have lost the referendum,3 GEs,local elections,EU election &amp; we have left the EU, transitions up in 3 wks, looks like no deal.I don’t want to be cruel pointing this out but where exactly has your campaigning ever got you?🇬🇧
1337864014962053121 2020-12-13 04:56:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> So far as I’m aware the shadow anything’s are not involved in EU negotiations.
1337863522974314506 2020-12-13 04:54:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can you imagine if the EU negotiation had started  of with the constipated Dancing Queen herself flouncing to France and saying before talks can go any further we demand all rights to  90% of your French cheese and vineyard production indefinitely 🇬🇧🤔
1337862641671413761 2020-12-13 04:51:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @hilarybennmp Well we didn’t vote to take control back of our trade and increase our economic opportunity &amp; potential to bloody hand it back to the hench squad you halfwit.
1337862213839826949 2020-12-13 04:49:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @hilarybennmp We’re happy with no deal so you can leave Leavers out of your pointless point making list.We’re happy with no deal.We back it. It’s what we expect &amp; what we voted for. So Mr Remain go &amp; find some other backers to your pointless pointy pointing.CV19 makes it more vital we are free

You are an utter piss taking political atrocity run by amateurs. You underestimate Britain and British people. We have taken it ALL back. Touch our fish... bang bang bang . You’ve been warned🇬🇧🔵❤️
1337856491710263303 2020-12-13 04:26:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> Er what’s labour done to change? It’s leader is condemning our leave PM for not agreeing to hand over fishing rights, agree to a level playing field to restrict our trade advantage and allow the EU to rule us... labours loosing  policy still is BRINO, vassal state and rejoin🔵🇬🇧

It’s what we voted for.We don’t want any ties to that heap of shite...all this nonsense from remain about leavers wanting a deal is just lies &amp; grasping at straws. If we wanted that we would of voted remain

1337779006318448645 2020-12-12 23:19:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant Funny ... as soon as you look like your going to leave with no deal you lead the polls.
1337771830178951232 2020-12-12 22:50:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DeborahMeaden The election was won by the leave party to leave with no deal... remain  parties cannot even create an opposition when you combine the lot of them.
1337736486792343552 2020-12-12 20:30:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JamesSm75372648 @2HellwiPolitics @smithaz00 @andreajenkyns The point is leave won the referendum. We have left EU. We will not be signing piss taking deals with the EU. That is that. The EU are that THICK they can’t negotiate a trade deal only slam about with fucking ridiculous threats and blackmail. You are an arrogant bunch of LOSERS🇬🇧

1337673995353812992 2020-12-12 16:21:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sturdyAlex Now explain the 14.9% UK export market loss to Italians, French, Greece all those poor members whose economy you intend to trash.
1337673650447802368 2020-12-12 16:20:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sturdyAlex No level playing field , EU law or British fish actually is where it ended.
1337673385183207424 2020-12-12 16:19:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sturdyAlex Boris put in the legal mechanism that the transition ends 31/12. A leave Parliament passed it. They will not change or extend.
1337673084199989249 2020-12-12 16:18:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sturdyAlex This is the only government you’ll see for years... we don’t touch remain parties hence the leave one has an 80 majority.
1337672582229790720 2020-12-12 16:16:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Alberto___x Not at all. It proves EU leaders can’t even have conversations with other prominent World leaders. It’s shows how childish EU mentality is &amp; leaders would rather shit on their own people than disobey the hench squad. So pleased to have Boris. We are SO much better than them🇬🇧🔵
1337670381365309441 2020-12-12 16:07:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EU_Commission can we just clarify on the level playing field, when British standards are higher on goods/food will the EU be upping its sloppy standards or is it a just a lopsided only applies to Britain equality policy?Whose the outside arbitrator or shall we make it Britain?🇬🇧
1337668719493918720 2020-12-12 16:00:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EU_Commission largest exports 2019 .USA 18%.UK 14.9%. China9.3% .EU wants to weaponise it’s 2nd biggest export market &amp; loose it because it’s afraid of a sovereign UK being a competitor,thinks it can blackmail &amp; threaten us. The strangest economics policy ever #NoDealBrexit

Everything the EU is doing punishes itself far more than us.If it doesn’t get a deal &amp; slaps tariffs on its goods to us do you think they will sell it here?Or non EU alternatives found?

1337535049005232130 2020-12-12 07:09:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BrexitHome Sell it in Britain then. I’m fairly sure Boris isn’t slapping tariffs on British farmers selling to British buyers. The farmers have had along time to sort this out ... don’t start sheep shit stirring stories now.

We will not be punished by the EU 🇬🇧
1337533010858700800 2020-12-12 07:01:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @smithaz00 @2HellwiPolitics @andreajenkyns For any political body with any intelligence whatsoever it should of been the easiest deal in history... the EU could’ve been negotiating in good faith to protect a massive export market but no it’s not interested in that it wants to control &amp; rule UK.Thats out of the question🇬🇧
1337489468497027073 2020-12-12 04:08:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> Wonder if the Labour MPs are busy adjusting their expense claims to cover losses🤔
1337488833395519492 2020-12-12 04:06:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Nigel_Farage I think there’s a Carry on Brexit to be made🇬🇧

1337488008275234819 2020-12-12 04:02:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant You shouldn’t be allowing access as part of any negotiation. We didn’t vote out of the EU to put the power of running Britain and the seas with Tories for you to bloody hand it back to the EU.

1337467452532416513 2020-12-12 02:41:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BBCPolitics I think the EU needs to raise its standards as ours are higher. As a sovereign nation we will continue to improve food standards beyond the lowers ones currently in force by EU membership.We’ll regain control our own markets,livestock,fisheries, farming &amp; trade.British is best🇬🇧
1337466016100732930 2020-12-12 02:35:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Tobias_Ellwood The biggest global threat we face is continued EU virtual occupation. How the hell are you in the party?I thought Boris kicked out the likes of your rancid EU nutters last year. Tobias, the remain party is called the Labour Party of Dimwits move over &amp; shut up talking EU bollocks

1337464823119044609 2020-12-12 02:30:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s face it everything about this negotiation is an intended insult to every Britain.We don’t need a trade partner of this mentality.The @EU_Commission  is shit on the shoe of every a Britain. It is below us in every aspect.We have negotiated in good faith.We are above the EU🇬🇧
1337463565574410240 2020-12-12 02:25:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DouglasRob0 No wonder you snapped ... kids need to step up and do their bit ... wearing a mask is a pain in the arse but it’s not a lot to ask.
1337460146700738561 2020-12-12 02:12:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> Is it my imagination or are remainers particully twitchy this week? they’re firing off all sorts of nonsense. They wanted the deal on offer to be bad . They got it. Now, suddenly they don’t want to own it. 🇬🇧🔵👏🏻
1337459522177290240 2020-12-12 02:09:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> Really!... it’s like hearing Biden uttering the words I didn’t cheat...
1337459325581856772 2020-12-12 02:08:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> Another tangible benefit of not being in the EU... job opportunities 🇬🇧

1337403871291973632 2020-12-11 22:28:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> @imranahmadkhan I’m neither shocked not insulted even though that is what the German Chancellor would like. It’s what we expect from unprofessional, childish , amateurs that are political leaders in corrupt EU.Silly little games.The EU is backed into a corner encourages by traitorous remainers🇬🇧

1337402585611907078 2020-12-11 22:23:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant The EU is a block that has very little sea for its fancy ideology of wanting to rule nautical supremacy. The EU is in ALOT of trouble. Sit tight government... we don’t want a deal with an aggressive domineering trade partner that wants to punish us.
1337401755332644867 2020-12-11 22:20:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> @websterssay Maybe other countries in it will wake up to the fact it’s a money draining project of compliance set to build a German empire with France hanging on for what it can get.
1337394386599075841 2020-12-11 21:50:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> If the EU are going to create trade barriers we need to forget it as a trader and see it as the corrupt intentioned set up it is. Trade elsewhere . Forget the EU and treat it with the same contempt it’s shown us.
1337391552851808260 2020-12-11 21:39:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sarahwollaston Oh put come the EU hench squad who wanted to ignore British people, democracy and sell us out. Boris is determined to put this country first. You are a disgrace. You opinion is irrelevant. We will punish the EU like we punished remainers... your flaky campaign got you nowhere🇬🇧🔵

VDL will bring it down. There is no deal because idiots like Campbell pushed for a deal no government could accept. Remain are giving us no deal. Own it Campbell 🔵

You are an embarrassment . The best thing right now is watching people like you firing off futile tweets .We voted leave, we left and there’s NOTHING you can do about it 🤣👍🏻🔵🇬🇧❤️
1337305591279202304 2020-12-11 15:57:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> You can improve it buy finding a new export market and keeping your filthy unroadworthy lorries off Britain’s roads.

We’re the worlds fifth biggest trader ...most of our export market is anywhere but the EU, we can buy elsewhere. All these new trade deals we signed off, no concessions required. 50 yrs of unelected dictators interfering in Britain is OVER.Leave won.Get over it🇬🇧

1337171928134668288 2020-12-11 07:06:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> So the EU demand continued access to our fish for a deal. The contingency plan is to continue to take our fish if there is not deal. And Remainers claim that our fish means nothing to the EU ... just trivial ... remainers are on a different planet.

The stupid commissioners are so obsessed with dictating to Britain and forcing what it wants on us they cannot see they are bringing the bloc down. Remain say members are sovereign🙄

1337150609762369536 2020-12-11 05:42:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @bbclaurak Announcing no deal would be the next biggest victory speech since Churchill declared Britain and her allies had defeated Germany. History keeps repeating itself🇬🇧

1337149386237722624 2020-12-11 05:37:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson In that case now is the time you came  out of Downing Street, held your head up high and told the British people it is no deal, the negotiation was to toxic to continue and prepare for no deal.
1337148796476641280 2020-12-11 05:34:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant We want a ‘divorce’ not ‘twinning’.

No wonder British people hate you &amp; hate the EU. How about we come &amp; help ourselves to cheese,wine,cars,olives till Dec 2021-sound like an acceptable contingency or piss take to you?
1337032617208795139 2020-12-10 21:53:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @pritipatel maybe applying British law to all areas of Britain can be the next plan...what the hell are you doing letting yobs like this take over?

1336960539726114816 2020-12-10 17:06:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DeborahMeaden News for you...most of our trade is done WTO. It doesn’t require access to our fish, want to create barriers in Britain, involve external political organisations overruling our laws or demand a level playing field. That’s the trade arrangements we want ...🇬🇧

1336815410407219203 2020-12-10 07:30:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> The main difference I see with this negotiation is if Boris doesn’t agree a deal he comes home a hero and will be remembered as one of the greatest leaders Britain ever had . If VDL goes back to EU without a deal the shit will kick off,it will be chaos and eventual collapse 🇬🇧

1335996955835686912 2020-12-08 01:17:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @redwingredwing1 @Mike_Fabricant @vonderleyen You’ve adopted ‘your head up Barniers arse’ philosophy... nothing changes the fact Britain is going to do very well out of British people believing in it and dumping the EU swamp... and nothing you can say changes that.
1335996442578722816 2020-12-08 01:15:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @redwingredwing1 @StorkBoris @Mike_Fabricant @vonderleyen I don’t believe in remain doom... do you really believe that bullshit? Because the EU don’t... they see Britain as a massive competitor and are shitting bricks about it... have you heard of the ‘level playing field’ demands in negotiation?Your argument falls apart right there.
1335994670686621696 2020-12-08 01:08:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @redwingredwing1 @Mike_Fabricant @vonderleyen Oh don’t start that nonsense again... you’ve embarrassed yourself enough for 4 yrs with that old banger...

1335978546909638657 2020-12-08 00:04:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> If Boris goes with no deal I will forgive him the terrible ill advised balls up he’s made of Covid...

Always has been,this EU plans just the latest attempt to control Europe,they tried taking it twice &amp; spent 50 yrs coercing everyone with lies and bullshit. Germany will never change
1335903454393458690 2020-12-07 19:06:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> Germany makes the rules for everyone else in the EU. Germany has always run the EU to weaken and weaken everyone else while taking more power for itself. The EU is not, never will he, never intended to be a bloc of equal states. It’s a German controlled Empire plan in progress

1335328743091548161 2020-12-06 05:02:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> I have become a fan of millwalls fans...
1335317200954155010 2020-12-06 04:16:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> So @BorisJohnson has talked to Von der leyan and agreed to more talks. @Conservatives WTF is this nonsense. Tell the stupid man to tell them to get stuffed stop talking to the arrogant ludicrous power grabbers... or the party is TOAST... Britain is sick of this farce
1335315056901451777 2020-12-06 04:08:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ManfredWeber @BorisJohnson We’re not running out of time. We want no deal. No part of the shit show. How *ucking thick are you lot?
1335313982412951552 2020-12-06 04:03:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @GoogleUK @BlackPoundDay And when is @whitepoundday? Im busy backing that...
1335263434141802496 2020-12-06 00:43:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> In summery Soubry and Stewart would of surrendered and agreed to everything the EU dictatorship could think of, lock us in forever and rejoin and destroy Brexit. Both kicked out of the party and politics for good reason .
1335217548070096902 2020-12-05 21:40:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> More to the point where are the antibodies now? Where do they vanish to? What other virus gives to antibodies that are undetectable in a few weeks?
1335177947939041283 2020-12-05 19:03:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MartinDaubney @BorisJohnson @pritipatel the party of two tier policing ... 10 yrs of Tory government...
1335156580308967424 2020-12-05 17:38:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> Genius🤣 well worth a listen
1335153087204499456 2020-12-05 17:24:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SinfinPartyBoys They have told pregnant women not to have it
1334986106736177153 2020-12-05 06:21:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s like watching a labour MP
1334985646629335040 2020-12-05 06:19:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> Hands up if you think now its necessary for this Remainer to free us from her. So she’s basically taken citizenship in a country she has no intention of moving to , to be an EU citizen she has no intention of moving to, to actually just stay in Britain. Pointless waste of time...
1334984885744889859 2020-12-05 06:16:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Parsleybear2010 Leave,great for investments, great for pensions,great for jobs, great to stop inhumane treatment of live stock,great to live in a country that isn’t ruled by the bloody Germans,great to buy British. You see the real difference is we love Britain🇬🇧 &amp; remainers don’t fit in
1334982639812567043 2020-12-05 06:07:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> If the EU is so great why is Britain already diverting trade elsewhere?if we can export elsewhere we can definitely import
1334955038486257666 2020-12-05 04:17:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> So this bloody vaccine has to be given in hospital because in needs to be stored in a -70 freezer. Hospitals are full, there’s a lot of covid pts to avoid in the hospitals and those most vulnerable in care homes will access this how?
1334943777396559873 2020-12-05 03:32:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MichelBarnier @DavidGHFrost Yes... you still think you can control us. Time to go WTO and watch you suffer..
1334925610783809536 2020-12-05 02:20:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> Yeah... and we want Trump back in the Whitehouse...
1334918598268252160 2020-12-05 01:52:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> And @Mike_Fabricant says it’s 90% there... Jesus wept ...
1334918303995793411 2020-12-05 01:51:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant It sounds like the end of the Tories. Sounds horrendous what you have agreed to... remember the party last year... couldn’t win a thing ... you had a reprieve... stuff it up and it’s no more chances... we didn’t vote for anything you agreed to...
1334912489335754753 2020-12-05 01:28:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> @pie_sees He’s nobody and doesn’t do anything.
1334912357617848328 2020-12-05 01:28:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant Stop listening to the EU nations. It’s time you took the same attitude as the EU. Make there life as hard as possible, make everything difficult, create red tape &amp; hoops to trade, should be them making concessions to keep the export market with fee attached and punishments🇬🇧
1334911117127266304 2020-12-05 01:23:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RestoreHope_20 You haven’t stopped it . We left. We’re going no deal . The bloc is done... the blue surrender rag waving has begun. We accept your admission of defeat🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🔵
1334910614200848387 2020-12-05 01:21:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> Oh please... 🙏🏻
1334910340509933571 2020-12-05 01:20:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> I don’t remember anyone keeping tabs on where Blair was dining out in the hideous Labour phase...
1334652001637064708 2020-12-04 08:13:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> How does this vaccine affect your life insurance and mortgage protection if you end up ill of worse because of side effects that take more than 5 minutes to develop and be recognised ? All other assurances have backed off, people need to make informed choices .
1334650908253302784 2020-12-04 08:09:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales These people have a very skewed perspective on life &amp; the world.They seem to think the entire world sits in the boundaries for the EU &amp; they can only go where the EU let’s them &amp; do as it says. They refuse to see how Britain Interacts with everyone else...they just like moaning.
1334647901356748802 2020-12-04 07:57:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> @petersingh206 @P4triQt I’ve given up opinion on accents . I’m just happy if it’s recognisable English these days...
1334646680206143488 2020-12-04 07:52:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> So everyone vaccinated may become a super spreader... can’t wait for next month ... our covid stats will be like the American presidential count 170% of us will bloody well have covid...
1334646033360560131 2020-12-04 07:49:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> So basically toffs are treated better than the peasants...
1334645736194125824 2020-12-04 07:48:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> I really don’t know why these conversations about our bloody fish are still going on.I can tell you one thing,if I was involved in these negotiations &amp; ‘British fish’ was still being mentioned by the EU 5 minutes after negotiations started that would of been the end of all talks.
1334644684539432962 2020-12-04 07:44:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> @paulwi16 FFS... they’ll be sat there in an FPBE queue, blocking up the roads , only one in the car, face mask on and EU flag dangling off the rear bumper . Leavers will just nip into the post office next time they’re town... 🇬🇧👍🏻🔵
1334642976992210944 2020-12-04 07:37:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @rebecca_morgan @Birdybabe07 It’s like having to choose between net Y fronts and a G string... neither fits , you really don’t like the look or thought of either, but it’s a case of trying to avoid the worst one...
1334623874378559489 2020-12-04 06:21:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @websterssay @ClivePearce7 @celebrityradio More odd shoes...  https://t.co/YDs3jJZvAM
1334608386890063875 2020-12-04 05:20:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @YorkshireHollz @BorisJohnson Well we wouldn’t know and he’s had covid so what’s the bloody point in a live vaccine? this one has covid in it apparently,which is why it’s stored at -70 and if you don’t get immunity from having full blown covid how does this vaccine work 🤔
1334605475929796611 2020-12-04 05:08:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @mikeysmith He can dine where he likes. He’s paying the bill... good to see a chancellor this good with money... you didn’t expect to see him in MacDonalds did you?
1334605102846537728 2020-12-04 05:07:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidJoBrexit They are just taking the piss now...
1334600266079989773 2020-12-04 04:47:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> Given the fact that the entire world has seen footage of the many creative and blatant electoral fraud scams used by Biden you can only conclude these ‘masterminds’ are in fact as thick as shit... film evidence ... 120% turn out and all the rest of it..
1334599541203611651 2020-12-04 04:45:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> ‘gone worse’ she can’t even put a sentence together ...
1334598996711661569 2020-12-04 04:42:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> Love this ... bring it all home... there should be government grants to help British companies relocate production to Britain and huge promotions so we can support these companies... 🇬🇧❤️
1334596379935649796 2020-12-04 04:32:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> What kind of bloody policy is that 🤔😬🤷‍♀️
1334595122747600896 2020-12-04 04:27:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @bbclaurak Well if the EU wants to bring’ new elements’ ...God knows what last minute power grab they want now, probably Big Ben,Buck palace and St Paul’s along with fishing access...they want every bloody thing else... into a friggin 50 month so called negotiation it’s time to say eff off
1334593146471280643 2020-12-04 04:19:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> So with a vaccine launched we’ve got Hancock skipping round the stage in delight that the vaccine he removed indemnity from and wants everyone to have because it’s 120% effective followed by the grim reaper Mr Vaccinator shares Van Tam saying we will be wearing masks for years🤷‍♀️
1334592391089623041 2020-12-04 04:16:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> They should hand the money over when France has stopped it not ‘going’ to stop it. They always do everything arse about face.
1334591909868806149 2020-12-04 04:14:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> Such is the mentality of remainers they are actually steaming at the ears because Britain is first to offer the CV19 vaccine before the EU. So far it’s EU law that’s allowed it and it’s some kind of argument for immigration because a German made it 🙄to stupid for words.
1334590942876196868 2020-12-04 04:10:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @KingBobIIV The BBC is a hate filled,divisive,savage,racist bag of bollocks.Never mind defunding it needs abolishing. It’s agenda is to continually harass &amp; bully.British people are it’s targeted victims. They are to stupid for words. It needs to go.
1334505901810724865 2020-12-03 22:32:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy Everything you say makes you look an immature, bullying, uneducated idiot that can’t string a grown up sentence together. The party fool and something for true Brits to laugh at. Grow up .
1334487104970248192 2020-12-03 21:18:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MarinaNigrelli @HoCStandards @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @MattHancock @Mike_Fabricant @NadineDorries Why is Britain getting the vaccine before the EU states??????? Why hasn’t your beloved dung heap EU got there first? Our government has got on and Britain will get first vaccines before EU even approves it for back of the queue EU27🤣🇬🇧🔵❤️
1334486054661976067 2020-12-03 21:14:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @UKLabour The bloody Labour Party calked for and backed lockdown and I will include last weeks vote where the spineless useless bunch of village idiots abstained,to pass the tier system restrictions. Your equally as responsible, in fact you would if locked down sooner and made it worse🔵🇬🇧
1334484167686578181 2020-12-03 21:06:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Jojones2762 Start by injecting that bloody prick and the Labour Party...
1334483572309323777 2020-12-03 21:04:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> Tories will loose the blue wall if it sells out on Brexit...
1334483297414631431 2020-12-03 21:03:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson He was behind the bloody evil  EU take over plan  ... you know what we think of him before you start all this over the top public wasn’t he wonderful malarkey. He was a nasty dangerous piece of work.
1334460569001324544 2020-12-03 19:32:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LizJarvisUK Don’t pretend creating a vaccine elsewhere is anything to do with travelling around the world... I’ll help you balance the immigrants rhetoric ...consider what the Jamaican criminal immigrants that’s been forcefully kicked out of Britain for their crimes  bought to Britain
1334442686837907456 2020-12-03 18:21:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @nmwdesign He’s a dickhead... we hardly need advice from a cheat and liar that misled his family for years and only admitted it when one of his young boys had been to the papers.
1334442167788507138 2020-12-03 18:19:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @davidjbiscoe @AnneMar45451941 Poof... just like that... 5 companies can produce a vaccine in a few weeks... want to give it to everyone in the world with no liability on those responsible for its production or coerced uptake...
1334437303989755908 2020-12-03 18:00:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @liambyrnemp This ideology of harbouring dangerous foreign criminals is why labour cannot even put forward a credible opposition.
1334427395877646337 2020-12-03 17:20:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @davidjbiscoe @AnneMar45451941 Thank you... I had COVID so I don’t need a bit more... I’m immune without risking a vaccine that pharmaceuticals and government have removed any liability from... 👍🏻
1334404747965714434 2020-12-03 15:50:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> London along with the rest of the UK does not want a trade deal.
1334404121714102272 2020-12-03 15:48:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> There has been peaceful  integration and diversity in Britain long before Britain was called to diversify for the those  coming here to take over and force us to adapt our society to accept barbaric practices and a way of life that is incompatible to a peaceful respectful society
1334402810625077249 2020-12-03 15:43:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> British intolerance of dangerous criminals and expectations of upholding our traditional values of decency, peace and safety is neither based or will be compromised by skin colour of offenders. It is time these so called celebrities, peer elected MPs and luvvies did the same.
1334396983776251909 2020-12-03 15:20:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Conservatives this is public opinion. Your persistence to continue to negotiate with this disgusting regime will lead to us ,the British voter seeking revenge on your party if we are not completely free of this lot.
1334396217472790528 2020-12-03 15:17:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @jane798m What kind of *ucking trade deal is this? Why is @BorisJohnson still in talks with this load of hideous cranks?

You lost the referendum.When there’s a vote we don’t keep having another to give the losers another chance to loose again.Sturgeon has made you people miserable &amp; feeds of your negativity. You don’t want independence,you want EU dependence
1334393114170187776 2020-12-03 15:04:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Pmmac @Conservatives How many free school meals has SNP provided?

You would have no currency, and we are not having a land border with the EU.Forget it,resign and to roll up you A4 Indy plan flow chart &amp; take it with you. You’re as nuts as Biden. An embarrassment to British politics.
1334391689759371265 2020-12-03 14:59:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> We didn’t vote leave to be free from the EU and have a demented geriatric in America or Scotland  dictate how we run the country.

EU will always be puffing and strutting about ... 🙄
1334071582952714241 2020-12-02 17:47:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @patsy_murrell Don’t know where they are coming from but Brussels is full of empty threats and nonsense. Drug industry is far bigger then the EU even if the EU doesn’t realise it!
1334070609597378560 2020-12-02 17:43:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @patsy_murrell The EU can threaten and try to be bloody awkward but they cannot control big multi billion pound drug companies . They won’t be dictated to by the EU, they will move out of the EU rather than have profits hit .To much money involved.
1334070069186400257 2020-12-02 17:41:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SteveBakerHW If he’s that excited why did he remove government indemnity for vaccine mths ago?Not a great advert that government take no responsibility. They want everyone to have whats  been created in 10 mths not the usual 10+ years. No long term trials. Long covid suggests it unusual virus

He’s yet to realise he is not influential at all...  we refit the left MPs, luvvies and all. With reflection we must tackle the Labour Party and improve on our 80 majority government next time .
1334064709998350336 2020-12-02 17:19:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> The Conservative party really is a two party party...there is a bunch of MPs like Steve Baker constantly challenging government and trying to uphold what we want as the easily led and openly anti what we wants try to wanders off on left wing paths and agendas.
1334061735548948480 2020-12-02 17:07:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TheEnglishRebel @nmwdesign Nobody asked me if I wanted to join it or be in it.When they asked if I wanted to leave I couldn’t wait to cast my vote.That silly bitch &amp; the rest of the left cronies sit throwing their silly statements about change nothing. In what way does she represent the average Brit? none
1334060506752167936 2020-12-02 17:03:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> Good.
1334060463152390144 2020-12-02 17:02:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SteveBakerHW You need to put a stop to the highly divisive, dangerous action groups that emerged over the summer. You have to put a stop to the left wing movement that’s rapidly organising itself. You all sat back. You instructed the police to watch on. You all look the other way.
1334055922373701633 2020-12-02 16:44:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> Note she doesn’t mention why he’s being deported... the only deportations I know about are dangerous criminals.
1334046656224956418 2020-12-02 16:08:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NadineDorries Rejoice...let every MP have it first....
1333902631991988226 2020-12-02 06:35:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @zarahsultana Having read the list it is no surprise that you do gooders want to fill the country with disgusting, dangerous criminals. Tories doing an excellent job with this. This country is not going to put up with people like this. Well done Tories 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔵🇬🇧
1333828524227121158 2020-12-02 01:41:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> No greater citizen involvement than brexit... 🇬🇧❤️

1333550465271914499 2020-12-01 07:16:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JoeBiden You are the enemy. They didn’t vote for you you corrupt, cheating old fraud. USA doesn’t accept your stinking policies and globalists agenda. They won’t accept you . They deserve better than you. The biggest vote rigging in history. The whole world knows you lost.
1333535182717136899 2020-12-01 06:15:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @PaulBrandITV So they are passing it by abstaining. @UKLabour how weak and pathetic can you get. Abstain to pass the decision you back but you haven’t got the balls to vote that way. Opposition party 🤣🤣🤣
1333530769646641160 2020-12-01 05:58:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BarrySheerman @SkyNews It’s more a case of how much longer can Poland and Hungary tolerate the toxic dictatorship...
1333530501160841219 2020-12-01 05:57:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> They’ve set race division back by a as hundred years.Before summer nobody considered race or colour. These stunts,toxic protests,looting &amp; vandalism has bought shame &amp; a new intolerance to their kind based on their vile &amp; disgusting behaviour that we would not lower our selves to
1333286937357152258 2020-11-30 13:49:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Devongirl_64 But nurses can spend 13 hours with a paper mask on looking after a ward full with of covid patients ... no consistency what so ever with SAGE/government advice. They even go back and do it again the day after ... and the day after that ... and day after that ...
1333093997846343680 2020-11-30 01:02:31 +0800 <trixie_2000> Here’s a new one... your driving license won’t be valid in the EU ... is it some sort competition who can come up with the twatiest idea
1333021419589005314 2020-11-29 20:14:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TiceRichard @BorisJohnson What has this country been reduced to? Boris is either absolutely inept or protecting his agenda. Whichever he needs to be out...
1333021048216891392 2020-11-29 20:12:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson this is your policing
1333013673250590720 2020-11-29 19:43:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @gillmac1 @sarah_pee @gargolo @SharonHawthorn1 @johnredwood That was labours idea...they made it degree only. you don’t get a bursary that way.... Tories just rolled with it. Neither party has any morals with the NHS . Both are indefensible. More money has been thrown and wasted at the NHS for covid than in the last 20 years to protect it
1333012918980534278 2020-11-29 19:40:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> I’m not keen on ‘reset’ either!

1333012525064052737 2020-11-29 19:38:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> Imagine how bang terrorists they could of been watching. Murders they could of been investigating and paedophiles they could of had a chat with... instead they lock up people for having an opinion. Terrible neglect of duty. No wonder people don’t feel safe in Britain.
1333011988654460931 2020-11-29 19:36:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SharonHawthorn1 @sarah_pee @gargolo @johnredwood @Conservatives Right ... name one other trade deal in the entire world, in history where one party negotiates by giving the other party a small proportion of its own fish back... we’ll come back to the rest of it’s demands when we get beyond the EU offering Britain out fish...
1333008430928433152 2020-11-29 19:22:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> @kenkelly1 @mdcbiscuit Privatised the police force? @pritipatel maybe you could run us through what’s going on with policing in Britain.
1333008117618118658 2020-11-29 19:21:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> Mail on Sunday poll... what further proof is there that remain has absolutely no comeback to the Britain voting leave? All that signifies is that remain still hasn’t come to terms with reality . Nothing else. What a sad old fella he is...
1333007415122472960 2020-11-29 19:18:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant Any deal improves things for the EU and is a loss of something for us. No deal is we retain our trade relations on WTO terms and can make the best of being free. Frankly we are safer with WTO overseeing trade than anything the EU cooks up as a deal.
1333006874116038656 2020-11-29 19:16:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson is this what you are frightened of with your endless bits of paper trying to quieten us?All l you are going is making Tory voters despise the party and any respect for you was lost when you started your cosy meetings with Gates, listened to WHO &amp; spout green policy
1333006148266577921 2020-11-29 19:13:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MetPoliceEvents We would of been more impressed if it was 3 murders, or those carrying guns or knives you managed to catch  actually not peaceful civilians guilty of having an opinion most of us share.
1333005543070425089 2020-11-29 19:11:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SharonHawthorn1 @sarah_pee @gargolo @johnredwood Labour that made nursing degree only training programme which made everyone eligible for the fees &amp; student finance. Degree pathway was always funded that way. Another of Blair &amp; Browns NHS legacies. Like the PFI hospitals .Like  the land sell off,bed cuts &amp; service sell off 🙄
1333004338248159237 2020-11-29 19:06:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sarah_pee @gargolo @SharonHawthorn1 @johnredwood Let’s be clear,covid wards need experienced nurses &amp; drs with advanced post qualification skills... they need to know the job,have been mentally prepared for years, they need experience in acute medicine, emergencies &amp; in managing end of life patients. It’s NOT a job for students
1333003232138960897 2020-11-29 19:01:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SharonHawthorn1 @sarah_pee @gargolo @johnredwood @Conservatives Right. The ERG are leavers. They voted down Mays surrender deal of compromise ,lie down and be ruled by the EU dictatorship via another treaty. To right they did. Britain voted out . We mean it. We will not have that vile corrupt bunch of EU fraudsters involved in our country.

1332967142250188800 2020-11-29 16:38:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SharonHawthorn1 @johnredwood They haven’t left.Stop trying to make covid about Brexit.Your silly little argument makes you look petulant.Statistics show 4,800,000 applied to stay permanently.Its crude if you think European medics should abandon their home &amp; families to prop up the NHS. All about you you you.

1332837746298269696 2020-11-29 08:04:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> Don’t remember any of this when the looters and vandals were ripping down statues and graffitiing up and down Britain for dats on end ... just the same police force watching on with bent knees... two tier policing .

1332830354202353665 2020-11-29 07:34:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> Boris is afraid of protesters, social media and public opinion of him. Boris needs to be afraid of the next GE, Nigel and Lozza. Last time labours red wall did the right thing. Next time we stick together and vote for what we want.

Boris needs to go . He’s blathering on about green polices. Has he lost the plot?????

1332684508991197185 2020-11-28 21:55:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> No10 says you can’t drink when you’ve finished your meal.No10 says keep your windows open all Christmas Day.

1332683012098707457 2020-11-28 21:49:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant How many dinghies escorted in, Frosts pandering to Barnier trying to bribe us with our own fish,we’re told we’re coming out of lockdown to go back in under tiers higher than we went into it, swapped DC for Osbournes cronie,Boris is fannying about with Green Policies. Surprised 🤷‍♀️
1332681542624272385 2020-11-28 21:43:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Conservatives you will pay for this heavily in 4 years . Don’t think we will overlook or forget this... we do not want to live in China or North Korea so pack this in...

1332628663276277760 2020-11-28 18:13:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DanielFerrie There will be a clear difference for Britain by being out...we will take back sovereignty, our seas and you will neither stop us getting better trade deals elsewhere or be given preferential treatment over trade  deals . You face alot of competition #boycottEUgoods 🇬🇧
1332627614339567618 2020-11-28 18:09:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DanielFerrie If you think offering us a few of our own fish will change anything you can think again moron 🇬🇧🔵
1332627174487171072 2020-11-28 18:07:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> Of all the *ucking nerve ...he thought he could come to Britain and offer us a few more of our own fish to get a deal. I hope he’s pissed of back home . The arrogance of the EU reaffirms how very right we were to vote out of the shit heap.
1332622923719471107 2020-11-28 17:50:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LeonieGreene @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier Why do we have to give the EU something for it to have the privilege to continue selling to us? when I go to Sainsbury’s I don’t arrive with a bribe for the manager to allow him to sell me my shopping which I then pay for @LeonieGreene sit this one out...its to difficult for you
1332621988532248576 2020-11-28 17:46:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LeonieGreene @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier So with trade deals being to mutual benefit, by your logic they want 80% our fish ,so is Barnier offering us 80 % French cheese, 80% Germany’s cars , 80% Italy’s olives , 80% Portugal’s wine? And the EU has managed to bankrupt Greece so it’s got nothing to bribe us with.
1332620474967318543 2020-11-28 17:40:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidGHFrost The best beginning would be out no deal, let the EU suffer from its greed and come back to negotiate a trade deal properly if we want one in the future. WTO puts us on a level playing field with the globe where most of our future trade will be done. To much time wasted on the EU
1332619849600823296 2020-11-28 17:38:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidGHFrost Boris might of considered this before signing the WA last year.
1332619697288835073 2020-11-28 17:37:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidGHFrost It was your job to try and get a trade deal to a deadline months ago. You are now embarrassing the country by going along with this farce of the EU demanding to control us by other means and giving us back what’s ours ... it’s hideous to watch 🇬🇧
1332619187362140160 2020-11-28 17:35:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidGHFrost @MichelBarnier No I idea what you say in these negotiations for that insulting , rotten little man to think he’s got a right to come back here and offer you a few more of our own fish, he’s got a bloody nerve. You need to put your foot down 🇬🇧
1332618604936884224 2020-11-28 17:33:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> This isn’t about bone health,right at the start there was research/evidence published by real drs &amp; scientists saying vitamin D helps the respiratory system fight.The government locked us up all summer so we are all depleted in it &amp; people are less able to fight covid pneumonia’s
1332615632400093185 2020-11-28 17:21:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @paulderby11 @Birdybabe07 And if everyone who voted Tory to keep out labour when there was no BXP candidate did what you did &amp; refused to vote we would have Corbyn, Raynor ,Phillips running riot on a Parliament full of lab/lib dems reversing the referendum.And I’m telling you now don’t bother trolling me
1332455471777767426 2020-11-28 06:45:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> May we ask where they be living should they arrive? Small matter that should be clarified ....
1332453646529859586 2020-11-28 06:37:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> Why are the papers so excited by royals wearing the same item of clothing more than once?

I have long since thought these so called experts are just a load of cranks set to make a fortune out of covid...now I think they are just nutters taking the piss...and our PM hangs on there every word

1332404490746654720 2020-11-28 03:22:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @briansm20193481 Remainers have seen the EU give us a bit of our own money back for years and believe it’s a gift from the EU... they now see the EU offering us a few of our own fish and with the same logic think it’s a great  offer... they call us stupid... 🤣🤣🤣

1327366457894842370 2020-11-14 05:43:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SteveOnSpeed Yes... it’s real and it’s dangerous but covid is far more complicated than whether it exists or not...
1327366081795792897 2020-11-14 05:41:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> We’re worried about the fishing territory, what’s arriving in it in dinghies and Boris is waffling on about the ocean... you are seriously out of touch with your voters . We voted for Boris not Caroline Lucas or for that matter Carrie Simmonds ...
1327364109814390785 2020-11-14 05:33:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> Yesterday Starmer was supposed to apologise for Labours betrayal of leave voters to ‘win back the red wall voters’,today Adonis is yapping on about rejoining &amp; having the Euro @UKLabour what a bunch of idiots you are,playground politicians. So crap you can’t even be an opposition
1327362831508008962 2020-11-14 05:28:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy Personally I find you a malign influence on British politics with your constant race baiting, intolerance, division and hatred of British people. You are an embarrassment to politics and most of us see red wall voters fleeing the sinking Labour ship. We don’t need your politics
1327361705949749248 2020-11-14 05:24:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sir_frankuk That’s because us English see Scotland as one of our own and Scotland looks down it’s nose at us...
1327347706348662784 2020-11-14 04:28:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MahyarTousi Unfortunately his solution is put it in  a dinghy and escort it here...
1327347234615201796 2020-11-14 04:26:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> I think Ann Widdicombe would be an ideal replacement for DC ... She could give Boris some excellent advice and keep the green ninja interference in its place...
1327346756850495490 2020-11-14 04:25:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SaltyDuchess Thoughts are I bloody hope not...
1327346042073997316 2020-11-14 04:22:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Jamin2g How many have witnessed electrol fraud?
1327343585646272514 2020-11-14 04:12:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> Anyone donated to BLM aka Children in need?
1327342177849122816 2020-11-14 04:06:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> Why do they need to be from that background? Since when has skin colour determined your ability to do a job let alone uphold the law?This means box ticking is more important than being able to do a job, this needs sorting once and for all . 2 tier systems have no place in Britain
1327326363716644864 2020-11-14 03:04:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> Just wondering @Conservatives @BorisJohnson when you might update the public into what’s happening...your number one Leave man left Downing Street &amp; now there’s rumours EU are looking at extensions &amp; God knows what else. Maybe Simmonds,who seems to ruling Britain could tell us?
1327323991707676672 2020-11-14 02:54:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can someone explain how THIS is not discrimination? Time that Khan was removed and Dick... they have turned the capital into a crime ridden slum ...
1327250206468018179 2020-11-13 22:01:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ChrisJC12002 I’m not either ... we voted for Boris and nowhere did he start banging on about this climate nonsense pre election. We didn’t vote for Simmonds to be running Downing Street and the country . It’s time he put her in her place or resign
1327249450910310400 2020-11-13 21:58:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> Just has an email from Priti Patel congratulating herself on celebrating ending free movement &amp; delivering a points based immigration system like she promised. I don’t remember voting for have hoards of males from God knows where arrive in dinghies as part of any control measures
1327247275056377862 2020-11-13 21:49:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Andrew_Adonis We don’t give a shit about your view... and we’re certainly not ever going back to the psychopathic led EU Ponzi scam either.
1327246672838189057 2020-11-13 21:47:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JohnnyTYKE Can you imagine a heartfelt apology from him?... God, he’s got a party of ferrel, out of control , anti British half whits lead by a half whit... whose spent 5 years calling leavers every name under the sun and calling us thick, telling us we are wrong, canoodling with the EU
1327245740293451776 2020-11-13 21:43:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @kitmalthouse You have you crack those expectations of living off a nanny state.... you need to start with kids, you need to start a whole new way of thinking and a way of taxing the wealthy not those earning 20-30K... this change needs to come from government
1327234489374871552 2020-11-13 20:58:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> Vote Leave... the most successful political campaign in modern history...
1327234282155282432 2020-11-13 20:58:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy His legacy is we left the EU 🇬🇧
1327234118506176513 2020-11-13 20:57:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Stephen6112 @NicolaSturgeon I believe you lost both the independence referendum and the referendum to leave the EU so I’m not sure as you are on the same page as the rest of Britain...
1327233383899033606 2020-11-13 20:54:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NicolaSturgeon Have you any idea how bloody stupid you look? you keep on embarrassing yourself 👍🏻🇬🇧
1327233073386303489 2020-11-13 20:53:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NadineDorries Has it occurred to you it’s not a good strategy &amp; that’s why nobody else is doing it. All you do is make it look like your government has lost control &amp; numbers are horrific compared to everywhere else... it’s more a project of look what a mess Tories have made...
1327178831376027648 2020-11-13 17:17:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @tesssummers98 I think Boris is in for a wake up call with that ‘jab’ and the overall message will be millions of people that elected him don’t trust him, believe he is trying to harm people and part of some sinister global reset.
1327163061485047809 2020-11-13 16:15:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> Next time Boris says we have free speech this is the answer...
1327162893075406848 2020-11-13 16:14:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> Struggling to think of anyone in my life time whose caused more damage to people or the planet... he is such a tosser...
1327021602706485249 2020-11-13 06:52:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ianrweeks Start with HoL and Labour MPs they are doing nothing ...
1327007776669839362 2020-11-13 05:58:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RichardBurgon Oh... I always thought it was Blair’s war... could of sworn he was Labour like you
1326960517005647876 2020-11-13 02:50:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Fr33Sp33ch5 @MailOnline And whose the woman?She shouldn’t be out in her uniform bringing her profession and nhs to disrepute. She needs investigating by her registering body... not socially distanced or wearing a mask defacing the cenotaph...
1326959569449472002 2020-11-13 02:46:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> @fumefox @talkRADIO We’ve had GE win it by constituency voting, proportional voting in EU election and referendum first past the post voting , so as far as I can see whichever voting system is used leave wallops remain everytime... it doesn’t matter how you count leaving it’s always the winner...
1326958166798688256 2020-11-13 02:40:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> Diversity and integration happening in the streets of London... under the watchful eye of Dick and Khan
1326957720260337664 2020-11-13 02:39:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MichelBarnier Your facing an own goal rather than level playing field. We will vote in any party who will kick your arses... forget the fish and level playing  fields. We voted leave to destroy the EU and the old crusties farts like you running it. We’re out to trash your market 🇬🇧
1326956589757161479 2020-11-13 02:34:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> @PrimalPolitical Good idea! Think I will to
1326925468642250753 2020-11-13 00:30:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> Where’s he getting his money from? Would be better invested in the NHS , training and improving and increasing sevices long term...
1326925112113848321 2020-11-13 00:29:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @make_trouble Who appointed you the vaccination Police? If it’s that safe why has government removed  all liability from itself and pharmaceutical companies. It’s been developed in 6 months so has passed no trials. What do you suggest people hiding in the bushes after dark darting us with it?
1326924056722071553 2020-11-13 00:25:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @acgrayling Camerons booklet said leaving the EU is out of SM and CU... we all knew what we voted for... Even May stuck to that and Boris won an 80 seat majority to deliver it... remain crusties really need to come to terms with this situation.
1326896540691144711 2020-11-12 22:36:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @darrengrimes_ I fear for the human race... something has definitely gone wrong
1326817784748269569 2020-11-12 17:23:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> Hands up who voted for Carrie Symmonds to run the country? Anyone ...I don’t care about Boris taking up with some green peace ninja half his age ... until she starts taking advantage of the silly man...
1326682689940951040 2020-11-12 08:26:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> What a drip remainers are 💧@SMerrells whoever you are ... government does represent us... that’s why Boris has an 80 majority and you lot have lost EVERY vote for 5 years. Millions more want out no deal... we keep telling you take ...
1326682050615795714 2020-11-12 08:23:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MichelBarnier Piss off
1326661083692740609 2020-11-12 07:00:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> Just don’t go.... that will soon put an end to this twaddle...
1326660406828539904 2020-11-12 06:57:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> Working... what are they doing? Thought Iabour MPs had been furloughed ... not seen any of them ‘working’ for months...
1326659720124493826 2020-11-12 06:55:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> @AngelaRayner Your party suffered the biggest election defeat in my life time. That ‘shower’ may be a shower but it’s a hell of a lot better than the shower f shit you lot are. We still would vote for it again.
1326658091816005632 2020-11-12 06:48:31 +0800 <trixie_2000> @HackneyAbbott What’s ‘global south?’ Might have known you would back the man that can’t string a sentence together and the most shambolic farce of voter fraud in an election in global history... wondered where you had been... what about your party and it’s illegal war over non existent WMD?
1326634796739653634 2020-11-12 05:15:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @themetskipper Fairly confident this won’t make the news... ramming police stations being not worthy of MSM
1326633988962852874 2020-11-12 05:12:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @YorkshireLady3 She needs reporting to the NMC

1326630493815791616 2020-11-12 04:58:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> @barnardos When charities, begging from people of a certain colour who for years have given generously no matter what coloured children gets the money , start accusing those same generous non discriminatory people with no race bias of being white privileged that generosity will stop
1326629683270733834 2020-11-12 04:55:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EileenTurner8 Part of the big global reset... covid... Gates... WHO... UN
1326629126669799425 2020-11-12 04:53:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EileenTurner8 The amount of people Hancock will want to vaccinate in the time frame it’s expected to happen in will be an utter farce... in the cold , bad weather ... when we should be out of lockdown and people working,  on the run up to Christmas ... God what have we done to deserve this?
1326627963429933057 2020-11-12 04:48:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> How the hell has this lot been allowed to bring this shit to Britain?
1326626218821754880 2020-11-12 04:41:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> Is  there anything in labour control it hasn’t *ucked up? Can’t think of anything 🤔
1326599676544634884 2020-11-12 02:56:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @tomhfh If it’s safe then why is government using unlicensed drugs and removed all liability from itself &amp; drug companies?Have you seen Gates track record,ideology &amp; covid predictions? Boris discussing mass vaccines with him?You want it,you have it but stop dictating to the rest of us
1326587847999188994 2020-11-12 02:09:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @paulafr68963440 In his case he’s a twat... a useless ,unpopular twat...
1326587342707187712 2020-11-12 02:07:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> Back on with all the lights and heating ... everytime I see this nonsense that’s what happens
1326586939454205952 2020-11-12 02:05:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Ara_MaHubbard Maybe her time would of been better spend looking for a job, with big pay so she can afford a big family and house to put it in.
1326586169061208064 2020-11-12 02:02:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s worth bearing in mind British people voted Conservative to uphold our freedom and treat us like human beings not to find ourselves living under communist control conditions , the economy trashed and create a health crisis far greater than covid. We didn’t vote for this.
1326585224743038978 2020-11-12 01:58:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TheSun What the hell is a nurse in a sisters uniform doing supporting political activist organisations and defacing the cenotaph with hideous junk? I thought the army was there to protect it no dollop globalist bullshit propaganda on it. Where have decency, respect and morals gone? FFS
1326476412363137025 2020-11-11 18:46:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @acgrayling Funny... Britain joined a so called trade block... not a peace project. We will wear our poppies and stand with those that died fighting for our freedoms ... we will protect Britain for them... they didn’t die for nothing🇬🇧
1326435533447376897 2020-11-11 16:04:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> More to the point ,why on earth would  you come back to live in a two-bit, second rate country, fast sliding into international irrelevance after 13 years in Seattle? Can’t wait to hear why you chose to move back here 🤣🤣🤣🇬🇧
1326424223833841664 2020-11-11 15:19:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Keir_Starmer The public call on all Labour seat MPs and councils to tackle the homelessness on their patches... I’d say there’s far more of it in your areas than Tories.
1326422621995618305 2020-11-11 15:12:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> At what point will MSM announce who the POTUS is after the fraud fiasco is sorted out... or are they just going to pretend Biden won for the next 4 years?
1326301076056911872 2020-11-11 07:09:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> The dilemma is do they use the staff to  ‘inject hope’ into well people or have them looking after the very sick and those with symptoms and dying from it or because of it?
1326289933410168838 2020-11-11 06:25:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> Had to block Hancock... I just can’t take any more of his shite... inject hope...
1326289381049704453 2020-11-11 06:23:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> The man is a fecking nutter ‘Inject hope into millions of arms’ he needs sacking... he’s making the party a complete laughing stock .... he just taking the piss now...
1326288230036230145 2020-11-11 06:18:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> Since when does international law extend to senile American President candidates dictating and interfering in what other countries do? Just wondering 🤷‍♀️
1326287424612347906 2020-11-11 06:15:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> Troops on UK streets when   We had terrorist attacks ❌ High terror alert❌ Child beheaded in a park ❌ Grooming gangs raping children ❌ BLM vandals desecrating streets❌ Stink rebels casing major chaos ❌ Mass prayer groups in lockdown ❌ Swab people with no covid symptoms ✅
1326284222949101568 2020-11-11 06:02:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @paulwi16 You don’t say... the big plan... who ever didn’t guess this was the intention all along... so really she just wants to turn Prince Harry into a trump?
1326283570554482690 2020-11-11 06:00:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> A labour candidate tryout 🤣🤣🤣 only one of them could think the most incompetent Mayor in British history is doing a good job... holey moley what are they on?
1326282341615067139 2020-11-11 05:55:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> WTF does ‘people of colour’ even mean? That sentence is not how the words would be arranged in English ... it sounds like it’s being translated literally but doesn’t make sense in  English.. it’s like describing a green door as a door of green... the shit they trot out...
1326281273887879168 2020-11-11 05:51:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s not forget the labour  MPs description... ‘funny tinged’ ...
1326236715007270913 2020-11-11 02:54:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @leehayward1970 So it’s no different to now with people being asymptotic 🙄
1326205939737915392 2020-11-11 00:51:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @mike_wanaoni @realDonaldTrump Great comparison... Only difference is Biden is la la and told everyone what he was going to do 🤦🏼‍♀️
1326205572933431299 2020-11-11 00:50:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @IMundebo @realDonaldTrump Ballot abuse is taking all of DTs votes out, glitches, ghost votes, defacing ballots and intercepting postal votes. Stopping the count and having van loads more for Biden added . OK?👍🏻
1326204861608767492 2020-11-11 00:47:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> Who gives a flying *uck what the grubby little traitor Major thinks. First he tried to give away Britain now the old fart wants to carve up It up and give it to the EU in chunks.
1326204320090648581 2020-11-11 00:45:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can anyone explain why, when the HoL consistently stands in the way of government bills to take back control from the EU Boris hasn’t flooded it with Brexit backing Tories to outnumber the hideous cretins labour installed?
1326197310045491203 2020-11-11 00:17:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> Any comments on the US rigged election??
1326150200868691968 2020-11-10 21:10:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> So there are 7500 military personal ready for covid vaccine roll out but none to secure Britain’s borders from these criminals being escorted here. I didn’t vote for any of this shit.
1326146647068467205 2020-11-10 20:56:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @stephiegal @jjcwow No bias then
1326146189306290178 2020-11-10 20:54:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> What is all this media hype over what John Mayor has got to say? Is anyone remotely interested in what this EU dogs body thinks?The only relevance this traitorous little shit has got, Is Britain stepped in to reverse his attempts to make Britain a global &amp; political irrelevance.
1326143737974632455 2020-11-10 20:44:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> WTF... I hope they track it back to where it was posted and get  some CVTV
1326125709820047361 2020-11-10 19:33:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> Release should be conditional to  being escorted on a plane and never coming back here , your family go with you ...
1326123120495894528 2020-11-10 19:22:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s officially the Murdoch officially . They funded fund and support the biggest corruption scandal of voter fraud in US history...
1326120488758865921 2020-11-10 19:12:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> And there off... lets all remember the 10 million pounds of money fraudulently raised for ‘children in need’ that in fact found its way to a certain controversial, highly unpopular racist political fund. I won’t be donating or shopping in boots.
1326119512488423424 2020-11-10 19:08:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ProfBrianCox you misunderstood Brexit. I still have the right to move freely around the entire world with a passport. I voted leave and celebrate removing the right of every Tom, Dick and skiving, benefit tourist  Harry from coming here👍🏻 hope that helps Professor Cock
1326118490923790343 2020-11-10 19:04:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> How can you say it’s effective and safe when it was only created within the last 6 months? Or was it? Your track record on everything covid is horrific levels of incompetence ...
1326106834197942272 2020-11-10 18:18:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> @mark_5506 @RobGard57497287 @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden I think it’s time we stopped saying there was a glitch. There clearly was not a glitch. There was clearly intentional tampering and deliberate fraud commited by someone.
1326104890792439808 2020-11-10 18:10:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> @carne_sean @pictureladyjan @serliamholman It’s tragic that remainers have to pretend that leavers have changed there mind. Let me tell you , none of us have, or ever will ... but what we have seen is more join us because they listened to project fear bullshit, the arseholes in Brussels bullying negotiation and democracy
1326103368591400960 2020-11-10 18:04:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> The bloody hypocrisy of this  bloody traitor bringing betrayal up...   John Major savages Boris Johnson's 'wretched betrayal' in searing Brexit speech  https://t.co/fac2bkkEBV
1326101328247054336 2020-11-10 17:56:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> Twenty. *ucking. Months. We have no justice system ... let’s hope his cell mates don’t like him much...
1326100827283582976 2020-11-10 17:54:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s learn from history ... how did they manage global warming in the ice age without the bunch of smelly shrills banging on?
1326099975521099781 2020-11-10 17:50:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> Who could imagine anyone so senile running for US  presidency, intending to win fraudulently and so senile they told everyone what they were going to do 🤷‍♀️ anything goes on 2020...
1326099045882982400 2020-11-10 17:47:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JMPSimor @TiceRichard We love him , We can’t stand the EU and it’s miserable ,weak little backers ... move on . Remainers have got to be the saddest bunch of losers on the planet ...

1325946916824358912 2020-11-10 07:42:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @CMO_England What would be encouraging is for government and pharmaceuticals to take responsibility and repercussion accountability of this  rushed through vaccine.
1325946549042614274 2020-11-10 07:41:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @robertsessford1 FFS just ignore this wizened old prune. It’s about time Boris pulled his finger out and told him to wind his neck in. The dodgiest vote ‘win’ in America’s history doesn’t give him the right to interfere in Britain.
1325945758667956225 2020-11-10 07:37:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> Fan-bloody-tactic... NHS bursting at seams so test all staff and send them home with false positives and traces of old ‘dead’ covid... whose looking after everybody next week then when you wipe your work force out?
1324853831612669954 2020-11-07 07:19:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Hoosiers1986 @IvanTheNuc @JoeBiden I’d be surprised if it was only 20% of his vote that was fraudulent... double it ...
1324853462425837568 2020-11-07 07:17:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @brexitblog_info He may of lost because most of his votes were intercepted , defaced, dumped and restricted to the living voter...
1324853039057014784 2020-11-07 07:15:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Maid64936427 It seems Barnier is under the impression that our fish are his fish!
1324852656960143360 2020-11-07 07:14:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MahyarTousi What I don’t understand is why Tories drop votes for this lockdown and labour gain from it when labour called for it...
1324852200213012481 2020-11-07 07:12:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> In what way is Barnier telling us we can have a few more of our own fish while the EU still takes 80% an EU compromise?
1324849512406519808 2020-11-07 07:01:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> @paulafr68963440 Eff off, English is still the one they all understand ...
1324847175931777025 2020-11-07 06:52:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Maid64936427 They were stopping people going in to vote in person yesterday... no place in democracy for postal votes. All should be done with ID and finger print ... the only way to stop the cheats ...
1324846110540791814 2020-11-07 06:48:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @paulafr68963440 Preferably roll on Biden and squash the cheating little turd.
1324845850573623296 2020-11-07 06:47:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> The best solution I can think of is a complete recount and verification of every vote in every state . Democrats doing the counting supervised by Republicans and they can borrow out Brexit party as adjudicators
1324845032483028993 2020-11-07 06:44:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @hugh_pimple Read one was Born 1820... so at least one is older than Biden himself...
1324844578873233410 2020-11-07 06:42:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can you explain how this is locked down &amp; sticking to the rules because frankly I see no difference between this &amp; the mass protest gatherings.Its just a large crowd in a line. If covid is such an problem explain why people don’t know they have it &amp; why you are looking for it.
1324843146212216836 2020-11-07 06:36:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> And Boris has locked us up for a month over this deliberately misleading out of date bullshit. He’s really pissing me off, he needs to sack his advisors and find some decent, honest ones who haven’t got shares in covid jabs...
1324842491187732486 2020-11-07 06:33:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> This entire election needs a recount, every vote verified and counts filmed. Those part of this not very bright but massive scam need finding,fined and imprisoned for 30 years. Bloody hell , you cannot have a man run the US that does this to win the election.
1324841396038176775 2020-11-07 06:29:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> If statistics are accurate and covid is everywhere and filled the hospitals up you would think everyone would know somebody that’s got it and in hospital with it. I don’t deny it’s real but there’s things that don’t add up with this... it stinks...
1324840346749177858 2020-11-07 06:25:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> One thing is for sure that left wing fraudster has changed US politics forever with this corrupt stunt...
1324839883953868801 2020-11-07 06:23:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> And has undetected cancer, heart attacks and stoke got over 99% survival rates... no they bloody well haven’t so why is EVERYTHING, emergencies,elective , diagnostics and LT management of everything dangerous second to COVID which they are looking up noses for to boost stats?
1324838738267197440 2020-11-07 06:19:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> FFS this gets worse... add glitches switching votes now to the list of fraud tactics ... this is just RIDICULOUS.
1324838257767710728 2020-11-07 06:17:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @sajidjavid Well you being an EU fanatic remainer would think that.
1324834057302253575 2020-11-07 06:00:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MrDavidGP @ChrisJC12002 I remember before the EU there was very little packaging,now all fruit/veg bagged.Production for everything moved out of UK,how ‘green’ is it having these lorries bringing stuff in we can produce?All this plastic on everything should be banned. Hope we cut it all out next year
1324832767440543744 2020-11-07 05:55:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy Nothing like a labour MP to justify ballot rigging and electrol fraud. The entire worlds seen it all and bingo, up pops a labour MP spouting about democracy. One that’s tried to ignore Britain’s biggest ever democratic vote. What a joke labour MPs are... just comedians ...
1324831196547895302 2020-11-07 05:49:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RabHutchison If Biden wins after this corrupt blatant vote rigging stunt I don’t think we want to be looking for a trade deal with US... we don’t need another bullying bunch of fraudsters dictating to us. He’s right up their EU arses...
1324830221963591683 2020-11-07 05:45:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s like dynasty ... another drama every bloody Friday evening... another week of shite... and nothing happens... FFS Boris grow a pair and call it a day.
1324828659941781505 2020-11-07 05:39:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ChrisJC12002 @MrDavidGP I don’t mind having 3 bins and can just about put up with washing the rubbish, I’ve got my compost bin, water tub and happily put a jumper on before the heating but as for as this extremist shit, climate hoax, the stink revolution and that daft kid I’m not having any of it.
1324827669352075265 2020-11-07 05:35:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ChrisJC12002 How the feck do these people land these top jobs? Another over promoted left wing twat.
1324802542820380676 2020-11-07 03:55:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DanStevens1103 Maybe if there is a hidden disability the grown up way &amp; the most sensible example a parent could set is to discuss it appropriately behind closed doors not yapping on like this ,and as the mask protects other people from you the school is responsible for keeping everyone safe
1324786803946172417 2020-11-07 02:52:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @GetBritainOut Surely more will leave ... if they can still get out . The EU is less compatible by the day with many of its member states...
1324753783243657221 2020-11-07 00:41:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> Labour taking notes on vote rigging... hidden votes, votes not registered, ghost votes , vote dumping, denied entry to vote the left cannot win anything ...

1324746375813337088 2020-11-07 00:12:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy @BorisJohnson So you refuse to accept an honest democratic referendum brbsusr YOU don’t like it but strongly cheer on a fraud ridden, corrupt ,blatant mass electrol fraud and vote rigging. There’s no denying what the left have done in USA and you back it. Astonishing, even for a Labour MP🔵🇬🇧
1324737928677986307 2020-11-06 23:38:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> FFS... how will anyone every take USA seriously again after this? This will be dnd in trouble . There is so much evidence pointing at fraud from the left ... they are idiots ....

1324466550015971328 2020-11-06 05:40:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TonyH091963 Depends on your opinion of the EU. It’s an EU directive hence the hard sell... for some reason the EU want to monitor every households energy usage. I know this from an engineer who hates the EU employed by power company to hit targets...

1324289626878738432 2020-11-05 17:57:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @chaocontrol6 @MattHancock It doesn’t help that labour doesn’t the 13 years before that cutting it up , selling it off and the bloody PFI scandal , reducing bed numbers and cutting services. This stems from labour but Tories have been as bad.

1324261189837328386 2020-11-05 16:04:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock What is this ‘protect the NHS’?we have paid for it through taxes it’s there’s to be used and you need to resign. If you cannot run the health service go. We can’t see a GP, there’s a back log everything . You stopped treatment of everything else.
1324139420338032643 2020-11-05 08:00:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> Oh and up pops the far left BBC and it’s gob-an-arf most of us have seen the fraud on here, there’s plenty of evidence.

1324124966577676290 2020-11-05 07:02:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> Well of all the condescending hypocritical things this disgraced ex MP,who refused to accept the referendum result, the biggest democratic decision made by British people and slunk off with the other traitors to the EU trying to ignore us speaks of menace to democracy .

1324121640112967686 2020-11-05 06:49:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> So far I’ve seen boxes off votes stashed away,people denied entry to polling stations, sharpies saga,machines not working,votes put in a bin,evidence of higher turn out than voters registered to vote, counts halted &amp; windows boarded up so you can’t see what’s going on.This STINKS

He’s been bloody useless.

1323574177853542400 2020-11-03 18:34:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SteveBakerHW I hope MPs are ready to vote down this shower of  shit when Boris brings his negotiated deal to parliament... we did not vote to take control of the sea for Boris to allow the EU to take 80% instead of 90% of our fish , for God sake MPs run the country or step down
1323573072163753990 2020-11-03 18:29:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can anyone explain how Britain has taken control of our sea by being allowed to double our catch? It’s our sea, we voted to control it. We catch what we want &amp; if the EU want to fish in it we decide the quota with a price tag attached... FFS @BorisJohnson has got to go...
1323570843939721216 2020-11-03 18:20:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> Well I hope MPs consider this before the vote to lock us up... this scrutiny should happen before a decision.I really don’t know how you expect to ask for votes in 3 years after this,constant decision making on manipulated statistics,ropey tests &amp; counting flu in with covid
1323569922019086336 2020-11-03 18:17:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Janela_X There’s something sinnister about the entire SNP!!!

Trade policy doesn’t mean we choose to buy from you. No more  EU horse meat either. Bonus 👍🏻🤣🤣🤣🇬🇧🔵
1323556785610018816 2020-11-03 17:25:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> How can EU retaining any rights to our waters be an EU concession? @BorisJohnson @Conservatives
1323554693214294018 2020-11-03 17:16:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can’t wait to see this ‘evidence’ they are desperate to hide...
1323554210244341761 2020-11-03 17:14:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can anyone tell he exactly what this ‘stand united is’ because we hear it daily as a reaction to terrorism but in meaningful ‘actions’ what is it? What are these leaders doing to rid the civilised world of these vile religion based hate atrocities?I’m not seeing it myself.
1323553284343422977 2020-11-03 17:11:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> So when rolled out nationally that 1:1000 false positives is 66,000 ... add in the flu that you combine stats with that isn’t even covid we have government grossly misleading and hyping up figures to con the public ... we still will not have your vaccine.
1323419687678545920 2020-11-03 08:20:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> What exactly do ‘shadow’ ministers do for 4 years between elections? Apart from a few SKY interviews? And talk hypothetically about what they ‘would’ do... from the safety of being able to do sweet Fanny Adams🧐🤔
1323418571318398976 2020-11-03 08:15:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MKactor77 @EssexPR What’s the betting its those EU fanatical people driving alone with masks and gloves on trying not to catch COVID-19 from themselves that have cleared the toilet paper shelves... AGAIN. well done @BorisJohnson look what you’ve started...
1323416941638393856 2020-11-03 08:09:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> Well there’s a surprise ... this utter turd in the thick of it ...
1323415704020856832 2020-11-03 08:04:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RockboltG @ManufacturingUK And how many false positives will that diagnose??
1323415257675542533 2020-11-03 08:02:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> Frankly I would be more impressed if government put as much effort,time,money, resources and military into searching for, tracking and tracing terrorists as they are doing with covid...
1323414010444865537 2020-11-03 07:57:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> The entire ‘advice’ from SAGE lacks real scientific evidence. It’s all false positives tests, a genetic test, tests that don’t Isolate covid and statists include the flu... what sort of government listens to this nonsense let alone locks the country up and trashes the economy?
1323412600739274757 2020-11-03 07:52:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @trussliz So does keeping the EU out of British waters and keeping our fish means our industry can be regenerated, coastal towns restored, jobs created and economic recovery. We can’t afford to hand it over. Have a word with your boss...
1323410637746294784 2020-11-03 07:44:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> Maybe they should have had this ‘mauling’ before Boris made the decision , the mole leaked it and Boris announced it... we should all see the bloody evidence if this bloody evidence is going to lock us up and kill off the High Street. #sackVallanceAndWhitty
1323409600234852352 2020-11-03 07:40:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> What’s lockdown and masks done for everyone’s ‘mental health’ ...
1323409205806682114 2020-11-03 07:38:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> Not one British or European politician has mentioned this is a terrier attack.They choose instead to call it an incident...someone bumping the back of your car is an incident. At least have the decency to call these terrorists attacks terrorists attacks.We all know the motivation
1323406847961931777 2020-11-03 07:29:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Femi_Sorry @BBC @BBCNewsPR @AboutTheBBC @BBCNews I’ll tell you why they wear a poppy ... because everyone who died fighting for this country deserves it ... And some cocky career ‘virtue signaller ‘ and professional vote loser with his bandwagon of nonsense isn’t going to change it. You can never compete with those MEN.
1323401890596573191 2020-11-03 07:09:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NadineDorries What we wonder is the impact on mental health from being locked up for months,wearing masks, old people locked away from family they cry out to see, from kids frightened by this hype, blackmail to get a vaccine or more lock ups... everyone is struggling.
1323401194568646657 2020-11-03 07:06:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> According to this the entire country is stuffed because everyone has had covid or will get it &amp; need mental health support which you will not provide. You are making this  worse. It’s a virus thats counted with flu states. So with this logic we can get long flu and long cold 👍🏻
1323393197352095747 2020-11-03 06:35:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson If I wanted to here this sort of twaddle I would of voted labour. Stop it. The French weaken our defence and security. Stop embarrassing yourself.
1323392665145253889 2020-11-03 06:32:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> There really are no words for the mentality of these lot...
1323392308591689730 2020-11-03 06:31:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @tomhfh If it’s safe why has government removed all liabilities from the drug companies and government? drug trials take years ... for a reason.
1323391795011719169 2020-11-03 06:29:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> Who gives a toss what Blair’s publishing? It’s nothing to do with him. Britain is nothing to do with him.
1323391224221499393 2020-11-03 06:27:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @vonderleyen let me correct you. The word isn’t ‘brutal’ the word is terrorist attack. And we all heard him screeching for his ‘God’ as he committed the terrorist attacked so the world knows exactly what this is. Europe’s under constant attack from these lot &amp; the EU watches on
1323386295989817344 2020-11-03 06:07:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> I hope all MPs vote against lockdown until this evidence that lockdown is necessary is released... @SteveBakerHW @MPIainDS
1323385580470833154 2020-11-03 06:04:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> WTF... covid is not the flu. Covid is this supposed pandemic . How the hell can you quote flu figures in with  covid and use it as evidence of covid to lock us up? how about we start counting COVID that’s swabs as it and has symptoms as the statistic.
1323384116864262145 2020-11-03 05:58:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> I honestly thought nobody could be as *ucking loathsome as Hunt but this idiot is giving him a right run for his money for dickhead health minister of the century...
1323383600021184512 2020-11-03 05:56:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Maid64936427 @BorisJohnson Plenty of Tories in on it...
1323383338099507200 2020-11-03 05:55:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> To be honest after this dismal farce and him being a right bloody pansy on all political fronts I would be hard pushed to ever trust tories again whatever to silly man does...
1323382418372501507 2020-11-03 05:52:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> As it stands I would bloody well stand as a candidate and campaign  after this shower of utter horse shit from @BorisJohnson
1323382073776918528 2020-11-03 05:50:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson I thought the NHS was run off it’s feet ...
1323381761129238528 2020-11-03 05:49:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock Your testing 1:132 people out of the entire population EVERYDAY... don’t be stupid. Your really are getting on my wick with this nonsense. Your as bad as Boris saying the number doubles when it’s reducing. You all look very very guilty , bloody awful at fobbing us off.
1323380707243237376 2020-11-03 05:45:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Maid64936427 @BorisJohnson Tories have had 10 years to do something about the NHS... they haven’t. They have continued where labour left off. They are as bad as each other.
1323369051788316672 2020-11-03 04:59:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson The NHS collapses at this time of year, you underfund it. You closed beds. You chopped it up and contracted it out. You streamlined services. You made it fail. Holding us hostage to vaccinate us will not end well for you.
1323348022886047745 2020-11-03 03:35:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> I’d be more inclined to stand with him if he would turf them over some other boarder and not send them here in boats with escorts.
1323347408529559554 2020-11-03 03:33:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Pfizer_UK Stop trying to brain wash kids . We are not having your vaccine . You are not giving it to our kids. Stick your bloody vaccines.
1323320724132646914 2020-11-03 01:47:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> I’m not sure Boris is very good with maths. In what way @BorisJohnson is figures decreasing, ‘doubling’... the numbers are falling without lockdown. Stick to regional outbreaks... better still ... tackle those groups in society ignoring advice...
1323263020655661058 2020-11-02 21:57:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ZacGoldsmith Don’t think it’s any better this side of the border . Biased policing and you lot allowing the left to get away with  whatever they like. I’m done with Tories. You have turned  this country into an absolute hole. And I bloody voted for you... never again.
1323262121812131843 2020-11-02 21:54:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @michaelgove Let’s not pretend we are not dealing with extremism here... how many terrorist attacks have we had here this year? I have lost count. Dreadful record for your party. You may think we are thick and you can cover it up .You can’t . Remember Emily Jones... and the other park murders
1323260875831156737 2020-11-02 21:49:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SteveBakerHW You all need to be voting this lockdown down ... and get your eye back on Brexit ... we didn’t vote leave for Boris go hand over access to the seas.... we are watching him.
1323260474633453570 2020-11-02 21:47:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> The EU digital currency... having run out of money it’s now dealing in virtual money...
1323163847650365441 2020-11-02 15:23:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NadineDorries Since when has sitting in a room been an aerosol procedure? And you’ve been telling us for months it’s not air bourne.
1323163248154337280 2020-11-02 15:21:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s hope everyone else votes against it. #ProtectTheHighStreet
1323162345389072384 2020-11-02 15:17:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock @michaelgove Get nightingales open as isolation  https://t.co/CnFDyYc9bU protect the NHS.And DO NOT threaten cancer patients ,stroke pts &amp; those having heart attacks with no treatment.We have followed your advice and it’s FAILED because it’s nonsense. This is YOUR MESS. You are useless.

1323001064891834369 2020-11-02 04:36:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> So does anyone know what we can and can’t do from Thursday... I haven’t got a bloody clue... it’s time to #ProtectTheHighStreet
1322999808420990978 2020-11-02 04:31:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> I remember when Obama was Cameron’s secret weapon . That  was the EU in real trouble so you can wind your neck in 🤣🤣🤣 were all United against the left .

1322998398451126273 2020-11-02 04:26:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> @leehayward1970 It says alot about the enforced’wear a mask’ advice Boris followed from WHO &amp; SAGE...it’s so bloody great they now say because we did as we were told bodies will be stored on ice rinks...if every there was a message to stop following these ‘experts &amp; advisors‘ this has to be it.
1322927129030524928 2020-11-01 23:43:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JackofWessex Even if the kids are off there is no reason why every teacher cannot be at work,alone in a single classroom teaching timetabled lessons live via Teams &amp; other digital means. It would be hard work dealing with lesson prep,teaching each lesson &amp; dealing with Q&amp;A, homework.
1322926159127076864 2020-11-01 23:39:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> Is this how they are processing 100k tests a day? Putting them in batches? No wonder people are highly suspicious of this entire covid thing , this is no conspiracy this is data fixing and NOTHING adding up. It don’t end well .
1322919763031580674 2020-11-01 23:13:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NadineDorries I thought it was lockdown and we couldn’t meet indoors or out... how the hell can people follow this advice????

1322860349541011463 2020-11-01 19:17:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> If we’re locked down to protect the NHS presumably the mothballed Nightingales are reopening on Thursday to protect the NHS , to increase NHS capacity and allow the NHS to meet the health needs of the entire nation @BorisJohnson @Conservatives
1322677738885533697 2020-11-01 07:12:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> It seems twitter has had a synchronised Tory tweet moment tonight post lock up announcement with all MPs congratulated each other and some strange virtual back patting... if they think they’re doing a good job they are off their rockers.
1322675713149935616 2020-11-01 07:03:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @andreajenkyns So British people having FOLLOWED government advice learn cancer charities say thousands will die because of late diagnosis &amp; no treatment,kids are a year behind &amp; as for the economy.Disaster. Have you been watching as Sweden?We have. And we don’t want treating like idiots either
1322670959552331778 2020-11-01 06:45:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock Your advice was wear a mask to stop covid spreading. Run us through why,when we followed your advice despite it being frankly bloody stupid you have locked down again as COVID spread &amp; NHS is supposedly full.Your methods do not work,your advisors give poor advice .You follow it
1322669278584279041 2020-11-01 06:38:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @GavinWilliamson Might I suggest you start planning for next years GCSEs/A levels?schools may be open but kids off isolating because someone with COVID looked at them.They’re mths behind .Or do we await another mighty bungle from your department?Stop the back patting and get on with your job
1322667706869567488 2020-11-01 06:32:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DrSpock_MGBGA @Magman55 Data based on mass testing, done with a test that’s designed as a genetic test, is inaccurate in recording covid according to the man who created it and doesn’t isolate covid ... just the group of viruses it sits in . EXCELLENT. As useful as ‘wear a mask’ ... that works 👍🏻
1322656518492348416 2020-11-01 05:47:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @toadmeister He built them,locked down to stop it spreading,shut them,unlocked the country with masks and let it spread &amp; then when the usual winter pressures started blames covid. Another expansive vanity stunt that Hancock pranced about over. Another waste of billions. Didn’t have ITU staff
1322651253969690629 2020-11-01 05:26:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Itoldyerso You can’t say because Boris was leader a year ago he would win tomorrow... he’s been appalling. Last year he was full of what he was going to do... he’s make a mess of everything and chooses globalist driven ropey crank  ‘advisors’. We vote for candidate on party manifesto.
1322626339015397386 2020-11-01 03:47:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Tony85485600 I don’t know what he’s doing... he’s just delegating all the work out. I don’t think he’s interested in the job , the party or country.
1322625759995977728 2020-11-01 03:45:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> All those who voted for Boris in December, if there was a GE tomorrow who would you vote for
1322624782928588800 2020-11-01 03:41:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ianrweeks If it gets much worse I think I would even prefer that weirdo that got kicked out of the party in the end for being an EU fanatic that couldn’t even sit on a stool properly at the hustings and took his tie off. There’s done decent Tory MPs but they can never get near the top job
1322623216758722561 2020-11-01 03:35:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Tony85485600 The fact he restarted EU talks when nothing had changed doesn’t fill me with confidence on that front. The mans a bloody liability. He’s been shite with leaving the EU and signed WA, shite with migration he’s shipping them in by the boat load and utter horse shite  with COVID...
1322622397699313670 2020-11-01 03:32:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> If the NHS is stretched why are the Nightingales not open &amp; running with these 13,000 (imaginary)nurses?   The real problem is winter pressures. It’s just turned cold this week and set off all the chronic respiratory conditions. It happens every year. There falsely labelled COVID
1322620998647189511 2020-11-01 03:26:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> Suspect Theresa May is possibly more popular than Boris right now. Never thought that possible ...
1322620749404901377 2020-11-01 03:25:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> Having seen the mass gatherings around the French embassy &amp; thousands gathered in London’s parks praying all week as police watch on I’d sooner Boris targeted those spreading this instead of locking everyone up.Frankly his advice will neither stop covid spreading or save the NHS.
1322619689768542213 2020-11-01 03:21:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> #Conservatives time to get rid of Boris. He’s an utter failure to the nation. Terrible leader. A year ago he got my vote ... I’m sticking with Nigel all the way after this . He’s weak , he’s distracted, he’s a puppet , we deserve better.
1322618292859752449 2020-11-01 03:15:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> The health of the nation will suffer long term because Boris is listening to dickhead advisors instead of doctors, virologists and other scientists ... more people will die unnecessarily because of covid than of it...
1322617306464325633 2020-11-01 03:11:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> FFS who can make anything of this crap from Boris...what can or can’t you do? another do it... don’t do it... go to work but don’t but do if you can’t stop at home ... go out but don’t go out...do it if you can ..go there but don’t go there...isolate  but bubble

1322615531740909568 2020-11-01 03:04:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NEUnion Why are these people teachers? Disgusting example to children. COVID is just one big skive to everyone of those 20,000 . So many of us carried on throughout this, many thousands providing hands on care to those with COVID and then there’s this bunch of hangers on 😡
1322614234488987649 2020-11-01 02:59:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Femi_Sorry As most people disagree your just yapping on like loon ... we had a vote you lost that is a universal fact. We left the EU and that is another universal fact and here’s another, no country invites non nationals,illegals and visitors to take part in democratic decisions about it🇬🇧
1322455756071936003 2020-10-31 16:29:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt I wouldn’t bring ‘troubled campaigns’ into it, Cameron wheeled your lot out as his ‘weapons’ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

1321760583608401922 2020-10-29 18:27:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> I’m sure all those labour MPs are  scrambling up off their knees to tweet condolences and false horror at the 2nd barbaric terrorist attack in France in a week... and then there’s the footballers screaming diversity offering their opinion to follow...

1321733522084814849 2020-10-29 16:40:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @AndyDavidson14 You overlook the PM saying the people will decide , it’s a once in a lifetime time vote and whatever the people decide we will do it... you seem to mix up the referendum, the BIGGEST democrat vote in Britain for a Guardian poll... silly mistake ... we left... we are out of it 🇬🇧
1321731935169925120 2020-10-29 16:33:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JNJNews We’re not having it if you make it and that. Is. That.

1321618264410247170 2020-10-29 09:02:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> Who provided the money? Rashford or government or the tax payer we wonder ... certainly not the council it merely intercepts and hands out money from elsewhere 🤔
1321617495975993344 2020-10-29 08:59:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> This sums up how ropey labour are. What qualifications does she have to lead a review? What research, medical or scientific background does she have? It’s nothing more than one sided opinions from a left wing agenda led perspective.
1321608762629783552 2020-10-29 08:24:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> If it’s true it’s illegal ...  porridge and a cold cell for that scale of fraud...

1321595928890015746 2020-10-29 07:33:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> Be honest... did anyone when we won the referendum 53 mths ago think government would still be arsing about ‘negotiating’ about things like whether the French can nick our fish after we left? Hands up if that’s what you voted for...

1321555882178678785 2020-10-29 04:54:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> So Starmer and his MPs having bowed and grovelled to it are now faced with fighting it for votes 🤣🤣🤣 that’s the lefts vote watered down even further ...

Time the EU sanctioned France for allowing this. Time government repatriated on arrival.. that would stop this
1321203808840593409 2020-10-28 05:35:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @hugh_pimple Well at least it would be classified as a political organisation with enforced Commision boundaries &amp; let’s face it,it’s only going to water down the left vote. Rayner &amp; the other monster gob might be unseated.Not that I want a bunch of yobs, racists and vandals near our politics
1321202818527670272 2020-10-28 05:31:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> Funny ,when we exercised our freedom of thought and voted out of the shower of corrupt EU shit Guy blamed Russian interference and a friggin red bus, claims we didn’t know what we were doing... we certainly love freedom from the EU @guyverhofstadt 🔵🇬🇧
1321201254958321664 2020-10-28 05:25:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> Considering labour MPs have been banging on about children not being fed by the tax payer for days on end, I don’t bloody remember labour feeding every child in the land from 1997-2010 and I have a pretty good memory.
1320987303855202304 2020-10-27 15:14:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson @PrueLeith Reopen the kitchens 👍🏻stop buying premade crap... You had chefs do all this work before and advise you and then didn’t do anything about it.
1320986700194156544 2020-10-27 15:12:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> They have already provided money to councils &amp; increased benefits,the expectation is councils and parents feed the kids. And I don’t remember Free school meal 1997-2010 so labour ‘starved the nations children ’ for 13 years...

1319765603671048194 2020-10-24 06:20:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> Can someone explain where all these hungry children were when labour was in power or did Rashford just invent poverty on Wednesday?
1319765207149891586 2020-10-24 06:18:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> I would say those German car manufacturers and French wine and cheese exporters are expecting a bit of a hit to profits. Obviously the German bank doesn’t want to  draw to much attention to that... not sure what we get from Malta or Luxemberg that is a comparison 🤣🤣🤣🇬🇧🤣👏🏻
1319757716181626880 2020-10-24 05:48:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> Probably it’s been a bloody awful spring summer and autumn

She’s just shown yet again how silly she is. You really should have to pass an IQ test to be an MP. My guinea pig make more sense than she does.
1319754742143344640 2020-10-24 05:37:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @AngelaRayner No he didn’t say anything of the sort, he proved you lot of vote digging do gooders wrong. @BBradley_Mans proved that what you lot want to do would not help the most vulnerable and needy kids. Stop exploiting kids. You really are the stupidest MP we have to put up with.
1319753452520640519 2020-10-24 05:31:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @jessphillips It comes from labour MPs &amp; privileged multimillionaires saying we don’t care enough to feed our kids.Actually we do &amp; we don’t politically weaponise our kids like you lot either. You condescending bunch of pompous morons .I’m poor, feed my kids,vote Tory &amp; would NEVER vote Labour

I can find no medical research that says prolonged daily use isn’t detrimental and risk of harm. They have had time for lab based research now
1319409935814373377 2020-10-23 06:46:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @g_998877 It’s not short periods for alot of people ,10 hrs a day.I’ve had constant headaches,migraines,a fall with injury because glasses steamed up on a cold . One friend had both eyes with infection from irritation,swollen closed eyes had to go to opthmology,another with nose infection
1319408216401379339 2020-10-23 06:40:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @AndrewLeonard75 Most people use reusable ones, people constantly touch them and adjust them while they are shopping . Anything on either side of it goes straight onto goods. There’s a lot of real experts saying they don’t work and looking at cases they haven’t stopped a second wave.
1319407420192530432 2020-10-23 06:36:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @g_998877 There should be conclusive evidence on masks after 8 months , people constantly touching reused masks and shop goods is potentially spreading this faster. Virus experts say they don’t work. We should have scientific research from government by now not listening to WHO.
1319406752874582016 2020-10-23 06:34:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> Trying to comprehend the reality of a generation of morbidly obese diabetic kids ‘starving’,in need of free meals?Why is it anything labour goes bloody mad about makes no sense to intelligent normal people?There will always be those in need loosing out to lefties wanting freebies
1319405519728201728 2020-10-23 06:29:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> If masks work why are hospitals fuller now than in first wave? Are these filthy things riddled with COVID and spreading it faster?

1313952649864249344 2020-10-08 05:21:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> We’ve left. There’s a trade deal only on the table . Take it or leave it. Were not interested In giving you anything to do a trade deal that predominantly benefits you . We definitely don’t want a deal at any cost or concession that gives that EU any power over Britain.

Frankly Mr Johnson needs to think about what his plans are and how they are being implemented.
1313354612573982720 2020-10-06 13:45:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> Right now I think most people are aggrieved about being racially targeted as being responsible for what went in 200 years ago.

1312504946130997248 2020-10-04 05:28:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson proof in one graph what incompetent idiots you are calling experts. And you base how you treat British people based on what they fools tell you. There’s going to be consequences and a huge price to pay for this charade...

1311682169446727683 2020-10-01 22:59:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> Hopefully the EU will fall upon its own sword.
1311664610357854210 2020-10-01 21:49:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Brexit How much more does our government need to see before it realises we do not want ties with the EU? I hope Boris says talks are now suspended. If they go ahead it will end up in retaliation action from U.K. and elsewhere for EU breeches.

1310743882632769538 2020-09-29 08:51:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> Does October 15th occur on a different day in the EU? why do the EU think it ok to even ask for the fishing access and concessions as part of a trade agreement which is massively in their favour?

1310291374877675524 2020-09-28 02:53:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> Great lady to follow ... a Scottish remainer that accepts democracy. Gives Sturgeon a lot of stick...
1310289405253386247 2020-09-28 02:45:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> How do posters break the law? FFS let’s concentrate on murderers, paedophiles, rapists, terrorists, acid attackers, vandals, drug dealers, people smugglers and fraudsters shall we before we worry about ‘posters’...
1310288212699602944 2020-09-28 02:40:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> One thing we can’t accuse Femi of is unprofessionalism . He doesn’t have a job let alone a profession.
1310287753637253125 2020-09-28 02:38:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> Though the weekend couldn’t get any worse? Wrong. This *uckwits a primary school teacher 😱🤦🏼‍♀️
1310287269060849664 2020-09-28 02:36:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> Mr Gobworth you forgot to mention let down by China who unleased this barrel of misery on the world...

1310263070984409088 2020-09-28 01:00:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SteveBakerHW It’s a virus. If spreads. It’s what they do.
1310262753081393154 2020-09-28 00:59:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> @acgrayling Confirmation Donald is a vote winner... and the US people back him. Like we back Brexit.
1310262165912289281 2020-09-28 00:56:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BBradley_Mans You must admit the party is rapidly descending into an utter farce.
1310261819219607554 2020-09-28 00:55:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock @NHSCOVID19app Are you on something? Your behaviour is bloody strange of late. I’m not having your app and I’m not having your vaccine... we have seen enough of this charade. Pack it in .
1310260593719468038 2020-09-28 00:50:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Article1066 I hope Boris says you can stuff you smelly french cheese, your olives &amp; your wine in the same place you stick your German cars.
1310260095054491648 2020-09-28 00:48:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock They want to see their family you absolute tool, not a *ucking iPad . Most can hardly operate a tv remote... where the hell do Tories find these bloody health ministers... Hunt, now this idiot.
1310258967868833792 2020-09-28 00:44:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> That’s alot of cheese Ireland needs to find a buyer for... we have farms cows and milk... we can use them to source all 3... damn sure easier without the EU agriculture shite and rules ... go and look for something else we can produce for ourselves...
1310234944724250630 2020-09-27 23:08:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DeborahMeaden At least he hadn’t been misleaded by EU puppets...
1310199768593969153 2020-09-27 20:49:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> Has this been referred to police complaints?
1310199255286657026 2020-09-27 20:46:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> The realisation we face is we are relying on the Lib Dem’s  to hold the party we elected to account. It’s a mad country...
1310198893381120000 2020-09-27 20:45:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> Sounds like the bonus is we get a decent head of BBC &amp; a BBC clear out... I like this idea ... 👏🏻🇬🇧
1310174411333480449 2020-09-27 19:08:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> FFS getting texts from track and trace now to download app 😬

1310022296212512768 2020-09-27 09:03:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> @rob_miller12345 Wouldn’t we all like to know.
1310022130445291526 2020-09-27 09:03:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> If statistically the at risk vulnerable group with worst expected outcome is over 80 &amp; pre existing medical conditions which the government itself identified before WHO controlled them,why are students being held hostage &amp; masks compulsory for everyone who statistically recovers?
1310021008229838849 2020-09-27 08:58:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> If these mandatory masks and distancing work why has COVID infection rate shot up? Where’s the study that proves they work?
1310019687036735489 2020-09-27 08:53:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> Better still ask the government some very serious questions.
1310019336971653120 2020-09-27 08:52:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> Where is this money tree located? FFS decades of hospitals cash strapped,schools can’t afford pens &amp; paper,the pension fund raided, worst pension in developed world. cuts cuts cuts ... *uck a duck ... now they are lobbing money about willy nilly ... apart from where it should be
1310017937751838721 2020-09-27 08:46:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> Seems to me Boris is deliberately ignoring respected doctors  and scientists and instead choosing to listen  to those part of the globalist plan. What the hell was this Dr put in the back of a police van for? Since when has telling the truth been a crime?
1310015899643109377 2020-09-27 08:38:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> @10DowningStreet @BorisJohnson Was this bull shit in your GE manifesto ??? Forget global G7 vanity status, we voted for you to run the country , control the border and get out of the EU. You are yet to do anything other than bluster about saying nothing. Bloody terrible government. I’m done with you lot.
1310014017134620673 2020-09-27 08:30:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LucieH20 @mssassysally ‘Could’. Did the other protests cause the death of thousands? Official figures say not.  I tell you what us. Hospitals suspending services for months on end. GPs not seeing patients. Cancer patients not being diagnosed and treated. Chronic conditions not being medically managed.
1310012380341035008 2020-09-27 08:24:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s a sad day when Tory voters are relying on the dreaded left ... let’s hope this passes.
1310011849052692480 2020-09-27 08:22:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> You’re not kidding. Have you seen the polls?
1310005585849585664 2020-09-27 07:57:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> Well Boris ... were not going with the covid narrative are we?
1310005000626634752 2020-09-27 07:55:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> People are wise to the ‘setting the political scene’ and flood the news with propaganda... they fool no one. Boris and his mates will finish the party off if they carry on with this.
1310004393341857794 2020-09-27 07:52:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s says a lot  that Britain wakes up to horrendous heartbreaking news that a serving officer is murdered in custody suit but by teatime the entire country is outraged at the Met for setting up violent clashes with peaceful demonstrators, beating up  elderly ladies with batons..
1310003106986561543 2020-09-27 07:47:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @John50213207 Conservatives promise a lot of action. Only action I have seen is ordering police in riot gear to bash old ladies about ..,
1310002276480757760 2020-09-27 07:44:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> @mrjamesob OddKnob Are you having a competition with Femi Fanny trying to be the biggest fuckwit on left wing media? You never sound  very bright. Either of you.
1310001121809833984 2020-09-27 07:39:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> Look at that crowd, unless a bit of banner waggling is classed as aggression why did the police have riot gear on and knock people about with batons? FFS the same police stood and watched yobs vandalise Churchill’s statue a month ago. Far left news outlets and Boris can piss off.
1310000119652265985 2020-09-27 07:35:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> You Matt Hancock  are more of a garden gnome... biggest case off dickheaditis we’ve seen since Starmer started grovelling on his knees to appease yobs, vandals and rioters.
1309999084602884097 2020-09-27 07:31:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> This is where it all falls apart for you @BorisJohnson . We elected you... you can go and tell Gates and WHO we are not buying it. It’s a no from Britain. I thought May was bad ... @Nigel_Farage why did you stand aside for that dickhead? 🤦🏼‍♀️
1309995244251951106 2020-09-27 07:16:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> I’m not a COVID denier. It’s real.But I won’t deny I think it’s a deliberate germ release... Bill Gates created it ...WHO is a big player.Boris has had meetings with both &amp; is trying to sell it to us.Wazzock Hancock is stringing it out to vaccinate us. I don’t trust any of them
1309993964519522305 2020-09-27 07:11:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s no good tut tutting at aged peaceful protesters standing up to the most horrendous government globalist movement in decades. We see what’s happening. We are not stupid. We are not falling for this crap. I will vote against you lot ... patronising &amp; out of touch with voters
1309991311953494018 2020-09-27 07:00:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> Best bit of policing I’ve seen in weeks...
1309990637903773697 2020-09-27 06:58:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Femi_Sorry Just to top a shit day of left corruption and activity off, this overgrown turd crops up...
1309972037331451906 2020-09-27 05:44:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> I have worn my mask religiously as directed. Can anyone explain why I have a cold?? Is COVID cleverer than a cold? Do masks only work on the COVID virus not a cold virus? Or are masks just muck spreaders or simply no bloody good at stopping viruses?
1309971032283975682 2020-09-27 05:40:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> The tide is turning.. time to really give Tories some opposition. It’s not good having no challenge...
1309970651369951233 2020-09-27 05:38:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DaveeyDave More a case of NFC ... starts with no and ends in chance...
1309969786533826561 2020-09-27 05:35:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DaveeyDave Is it on?
1309969639292764163 2020-09-27 05:34:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson @pritipatel @Conservatives why is this vile divisive trouble making con artist still MoL?
1309968848175673346 2020-09-27 05:31:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ajayjagota This is more about here and now... COVID they have ballsed  up... 3 months and no deal they rocket...4 months and they repatriate the unwelcome eastern invasion they will become the most popular party in living history...
1309968260599820295 2020-09-27 05:29:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> That is exactly why labour suffered the heaviest defeat in decades...
1309968059017371648 2020-09-27 05:28:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LTHewitt @chrisjennings46 @ajayjagota As you know graphs with no information or source on are best used as toilet roll in a pandemic ... ducky your kidding no one...
1309967762022977543 2020-09-27 05:27:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LTHewitt @chrisjennings46 @ajayjagota You made a graph up versus an actual referendum... 🤣🤣🤣🇬🇧👏🏻
1309966877821722625 2020-09-27 05:23:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @stuartprideaux @BritAbroad66 @chantal_oiseau There’s a lot of people all over the world that back Brexit. Moving and travel isn’t exclusive to remain voters... Hungary and Poland are kicking off... the empire will never be... largely because leave won and there’s nothing you can do about it..👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤣🤣🤣🔵🇬🇧😂😂
1309965459006029824 2020-09-27 05:17:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MetPoliceEvents I’m more concerned about the elderly protesters walloped and slung to the ground outnumbered by young fit baton weirding officers. Thought it was Macrons EU  army beating the yellow jackets up .
1309955315362922498 2020-09-27 04:37:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson is definitely reinstating the Brexit party...
1309954211514327041 2020-09-27 04:33:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> At what point will Boris and that stupid Hancock realise they can invent and launch as many track and trace apps as they like but it will never work because nobody’s downloading them... lost track of the billions they have wasted 😬
1309952938505318407 2020-09-27 04:28:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> @WeDoNotLearn73 To be fair the problem does seem to be the police controlled by Khan and sidekick Dick. Problems are elsewhere but it’s not a good look or example for the Met.
1309952378947371009 2020-09-27 04:25:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @johnredwood I hope it’s looking to rise taxes on all the companies raking a fortune in on testing and PPE... it’s no good looking at us poor working class sods... foods a luxury and we daren’t  put the heating on. Start taxing the wealthy contents of the M25 ...
1309951666377162752 2020-09-27 04:23:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ABridgen From what’s been on here today they are trying to justify it, play it down and make excuses . They will continue to pursue it... just look at Owen Jones for starters...
1309951351594647552 2020-09-27 04:21:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Mike_Fabricant You cannot treat voters with contempt, lock them up, beat them up and hold them hostage to vaccinate them and expect to retain votes. Boris, his expert advisers and Hannock will finish the party off... that’s without bringing the uninvited guests being shipped in into it...
1309950578009747457 2020-09-27 04:18:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> @hugh_pimple He’s vile .
1309950450389659648 2020-09-27 04:18:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SadiqKhan You can’t say that after encouraging and welcoming the knee bend protests. You cannot ‘select’ crowd events to suit your agenda.
1309950050051723269 2020-09-27 04:16:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> This MP should be a future party leader... frankly Doris needs to sod off and count his Coronovirus handout from Gates and take that great wazzock Hancock with him.
1309946303854579712 2020-09-27 04:01:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> So in one day we have a murdered police officer, this and a similar incident in Birmingham ... at what point is @BorisJohnson going to get a grip on this? how many more arrived in boats today?
1309942158451933184 2020-09-27 03:45:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> That is a very accurate description... but an unfair slur of Wombles.
1309941795808325632 2020-09-27 03:43:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DannyKerr7 @jankor87 @MichelBarnier @CatioMiles @emireland I’m fairly sure we are going to have to dance along to the EU tune of ‘we can afford to loose out biggest export market’ for another 3 tedious months 🙄😬
1309895929365962753 2020-09-27 00:41:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> More accurately ‘intelligent capable independent thinkers’ @BorisJohnson will pay a heavy price for hostility against those who voted for him. Floating voters are sick of him bafooning about... @Nigel_Farage will be winning seats next election
1309876133618503680 2020-09-26 23:23:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> So the Met are dispersing people objecting to breach of liberty. The same Met that stood back and watched and failed to uphold the law as public property destroyed by a racist hate movement then crawled in submission to it &amp; same Met that let climate hoax create major chaos
1309856062208647169 2020-09-26 22:03:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> Why do remoaners try and claim Churchill and Thatcher were EU remain fanatics when one defeated the ideology last time around &amp; won the war &amp; the other was as hostile as possible fiercely objecting to any kind of EU power in domestic matters block you for pointing it out? 🤣
1309841512826576897 2020-09-26 21:05:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @AmandaP12446726 @OwenJones84 @BrickLaneBooks It’s not on mine and it’s not going near my kids. We’re all Tory Tory Tory 🔵🇬🇧
1309841195598786562 2020-09-26 21:04:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @OwenJones84 That organisation should be classified as a terrorist movement. You &amp; your left wing extremist fanatics can keep out classrooms and peddle your divisive hate filled shit elsewhere.Grown ups will not have it &amp; your going nowhere near our kids with it.
1309839291036639232 2020-09-26 20:56:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> Is there a chapter on #owenJonesIsAWankerDay ?
1309838906511306752 2020-09-26 20:55:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @OwenJones84 Labour don’t even campaign to work let alone pay tax... 🤣🤣🤣

There’s a trade deal on offer, nothing else . Given its to your benefit to those in the EU that export here and we have the globe to source from, the EU is looking very very silly...
1309750223753879554 2020-09-26 15:02:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> @eucopresident Your blindness is matched by your stupidity...

1309749036535164928 2020-09-26 14:57:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @The_ChrisShaw @CatioMiles If that is what it takes for freedom... small price to pay.
1309746182810464256 2020-09-26 14:46:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @CatioMiles Nothing like a far left extremist branding fascism warnings about. This will be a channel representative of the majority of Brits. Bloody hell, the left has BBC,ITV,C4, C5 and Sky news... surely they can cope with one centralist channel to balance it out a bit?
1309532479875883009 2020-09-26 00:37:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DailyMailUK He’s done exactly what he wants. It’s his family that have been affected mentally. Imagine finding out about your husband or fathers hidden life.
1309532020641542144 2020-09-26 00:35:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> Why doesn’t government set up a department to deal with this?Vaz is part of the problem. This is your watch.
1309531440359632896 2020-09-26 00:33:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson and @pritipatel fancy letting our police put up with smug,stupid arrogant law breakers like this.
1309530488642691074 2020-09-26 00:29:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> This silly prick really is getting on my nerves.
1309498648103981056 2020-09-25 22:23:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> Today is the day we make a stand and make social media ours #BlueLivesMatter

Sickening it really is .
1309475707026837506 2020-09-25 20:51:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> @thetwerkinggirl What is this danger lurking in the Croydon area? I have only heard one thing about Croydon today and the danger is to police officers.
1309448757478555648 2020-09-25 19:04:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> Have to say I find this distasteful outpouring of support for a murdered police officer from Labour MPs hypocritical and sickening. For years they campaign how unjust it is for officers to stop and search. This is what happens when you don’t search... guns in custody suit...
1309448257530204160 2020-09-25 19:02:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy Maybe if he had been searched we wouldn’t have to listen to the pretence of Labour grief. After years of Labour MPs campaigning how unjust it is to search suspects one poor officer pays the ultimate price.This is what harassing police officers for searching criminals does...
1309438849970569216 2020-09-25 18:25:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> The general public may take government advisers advice as more reliable if Sir Patrick Valance didn’t have 600k invested in the vaccine making company hes promoting and Neil Ferguson’s expert previous infection predictions weren’t massively over inflated and inaccurate.
1309404335240085504 2020-09-25 16:08:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> Beyond a sad day... it’s the point we know government has lost control, that our police, criminal and legal system is completely ineffective for a ferral extremist dangerous population that’s been allowed to grow and that lives here demanding to be worshipped.

People have moved around the entire globe since the year dot.Neither travel or migration is an invention or reserved right of the EU nationals

I did get a say in choosing who our pm was... that’s the difference between UK and EU democracy... a say. And no say.

Hundreds of thousands of swabs are done in  hospitals, the community and nursing homes. They are NOTHING to do with track and trace. Hospitals are the priority over an app alert swab.

1306859957753729026 2020-09-18 15:37:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @WinterfellT I don’t understand is how you think a sheet of tissue over your face with no seal round it will stop a an airborne virus? 307 healthy people out of a population of around 80 million died and CV19 was spreading in a more dangerous from Oct 19, 6 months before WHO admitted it
1306848542229778432 2020-09-18 14:52:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> So while there’s been outrage  in Brussels over the government bill , the EU are trying up make a power grab over the channel tunnel and rewriting legislation that will give the ECJ power over Britain.
1306842979383095297 2020-09-18 14:30:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> Remember the hospitals were full ... so they tell us...
1306841671775203328 2020-09-18 14:25:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JazzStevens3 @JeremyClarkson No it wasn’t insane. What is insane is remainers inability to accept democracy when the vote doesn’t go their way, and what is insane is wanting to be ruled by a corrupt German led foreign power which nobody ever voted for.
1306840787783749633 2020-09-18 14:21:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson what are we doing?

1306638733299666950 2020-09-18 00:58:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> He’s right. They are pointless.
1306638331468541953 2020-09-18 00:57:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Ofcom We don’t want ‘your views’. You are supposed to be impartial. You are not there to make excuses for the offensive,racist,inexcusable stunt. Stick to the facts. Stick to half a million viewers lost and stick to that organisation registering as a political party, get a grip .
1306637270720675843 2020-09-18 00:52:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> So will we see a re-enactment of Keith Palmers murder,Lee Rigby? The arena bombing,Emily Jones, the reading park attacks, Westminster bridge attacks?Or is Banjo only interested in promoting career criminals who hold pregnant women hostage at gun point &amp; die full of amphetamines?
1306582649243402241 2020-09-17 21:15:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> @GaryLineker @AlexScott This is ‘white privileged’ personified. This is work place male  privileged discrimination. Lineker is enough to make anyone puke.
1306581976082767872 2020-09-17 21:13:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> By the end of the week you need to be a bird with the migration distance capability to get a bloody test. For God sake @BorisJohnson get rid of this bloody goon. Get rid of your ridiculous anti Brexit advisors and ‘scientists’ hell bent on making you look a goon and dump WHO

We don’t want some far left irrelevant, corrupt yank sticking his nose in here, go and sort your own rioter ferral followers out . We don’t need your idea of ‘peace’ . Twat.
1306554837891452928 2020-09-17 19:25:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> The problem with labours level of ‘class’ is most people don’t relate to these chavvy , dim and scruffy MPs who can’t speak properly and just script read irrelevant nonsense.

We want a free prosperous country not some little insignificant EU state controlled by rogue corrupt foreign powers. 🇬🇧👏🏻🔵
1306500270411730945 2020-09-17 15:48:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @lisanandy The fact you loose your shit over technology not working proves just how pathetic, needy and useless you are. People don’t want to hear whinging petty little playground jibes from those pretending they want to run the country. You are a laughing stock MP and party. Dreadful MP

1306306483353726977 2020-09-17 02:58:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> I can’t see any of them becoming the height of fashion 😳

1306181569783246848 2020-09-16 18:42:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Lorand_Bartels EU stated WA cannot be reopened . When the EU want to reopen it and make changes. The EU can reopen it. Why would Britain want any long term dealings with these filthy cretins?
1306180528840806401 2020-09-16 18:38:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MichelBarnier @vonderleyen Pillaging British seas,wanting billions more payments,using Northern island to blackmail for further demands,threatening to cut its food supply off &amp; wanting UK to be subject to you dictating trade deals &amp; your laws is the foundation for nothing. It passed because of clause 38

1306121140314738688 2020-09-16 14:42:01 +0800 <trixie_2000> Today’s little treat is Rayner stands in for Starmer... should be good... twitter will be alight by tea time...
1306119711294459904 2020-09-16 14:36:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @darrengrimes_ That is a well known fact... what even are jedward? They were in a Butlins style talent contest years ago . They weren’t even knowledgeable about singing and it certainly doesn’t qualify them as political experts.. just a pair of EU sheep 🐑 🐑

1306001342725533697 2020-09-16 06:45:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JMPSimor Definitely say if Britain won’t let us pillage it’s seas, starve the people of Northern island and put up a hard border and break the good Friday arrangement we will declare no deal by tea time and sell our olives and smelly cheese elsewhere.
1305999714106724357 2020-09-16 06:39:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> Excellent example of left woke media Censorship and exclusion.   Make a hugely unpopular &amp; controversial statement and then turn the comments off.   Ashley can ponce off and worship his career criminal drug addict hero elsewhere. The majority are pretty pissed off at @ITV &amp; Banjo

Get them back home to look after their  female relatives and dependents that they have dumped  in areas these men fled from. If it’s good enough for the women it’s safe dnougb for these lot
1305997017697660934 2020-09-16 06:28:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SadiqKhan Get to the back of the queue. Everybody needs them. The out of touch London snobs are no more important than anyone else.Far more people are dying in London from stabbings than not getting a nose swab. You can comment on Hancock’s failings when you have your sorted your own out.

1305969822421917703 2020-09-16 04:40:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> Proof the real problem is these far left corrupt civil servants... the clue is the ‘servants’ bit. They are employed to serve the public not there to cause trouble and undermine elected government. They are there to do a job not like it..

1305632391965347840 2020-09-15 06:19:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @thatginamiller @FinancialTimes And the EU is giving away far more to other trade partners than Britain. Your point is what exactly???
1305631851659264002 2020-09-15 06:17:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Ianblackford_MP 340 votes to protect Britain and shield it from the international law breaking plot of the EU.
1305600190154518529 2020-09-15 04:11:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ArchRose90 It could of been 5 days and he would still not have mentioned it. That is how ropey ‘remain’  is.
1305596780483051523 2020-09-15 03:58:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> What’s pitiful is watching British MPs acting as EU dogsbodies. Have you no self respect? You are Barniers pansy...

1305573710422839296 2020-09-15 02:26:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales Lincolnshire... even Nick Boles couldn’t loose the Tory seat in a big leave area after leading a fight against his own party, Parliament and country on behalf of the EU!
1305532274235109376 2020-09-14 23:42:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> This is why party members didn’t vote for you as party leader... remainers falling over themselves today...

1305423999418224641 2020-09-14 16:31:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> Having flattened the curve why is @BorisJohnson allowing @MattHancock to pretend there is still a curve to flatten?  Can either explain how the rule of 6 enforced in low COVID areas will reduce CV19 when CV19 areas that do what they like will carry on meeting in groups of 600?
1305414551933005824 2020-09-14 15:54:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> The EU is really just about redistribution of real terms wealth from bottom to top and exchanging  any power from bottom to top... the top always wins. Germany hoovers it all up. The ultimate pyramid scam.
1305410311973937152 2020-09-14 15:37:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> So ultimately if you don’t support the racist fist movement ITV don’t  want you to watch there channel... funny that... people had already walked away as BGT figures show.
1305409751912775680 2020-09-14 15:35:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> And here we are 6 months later and Twat Hancock still finding ways to prolong it...😬
1305394910477062144 2020-09-14 14:36:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> @standardnews They had everything but nurses before. From what I have heard nurses have done ‘their bit’, they won’t be sending their kids to live elsewhere,moving out of their homes or doing endless extra hours so who will be ‘stepping up’ this time, they are shattered from the first wave ...

1305331195941720065 2020-09-14 10:23:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Geoffrey_Cox what’s damaging to your reputation is the fact that Mr Johnson even needs to make this legislation.The question YOU need to answer is why you bought the WA to Britain as an acceptable legal position that the EU openly intended to abuse Britain with.We are waiting...
1305330061080436738 2020-09-14 10:18:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> I like this man with the red tie...
1305294713742864388 2020-09-14 07:58:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> It seems this rule of 6 has been created so hefty fines can be handed out. Is it a form of covert taxation to raise funds?
1305294012090404864 2020-09-14 07:55:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> Surely grounds for unfair dismissal...
1305281838445887488 2020-09-14 07:06:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @llaisfyhun I’m suspicious. WHO ordered all countries to not do post mortems. That stops you doing independent research and finding things out for yourself. Early on in this Italy did PMs and COVID had caused clots that led/contributed to death. Long before HCQ mentioned...
1305281130225119237 2020-09-14 07:04:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> Did he have a mobile on him? They should be able to trace his route and with all the CCTV there is pick up plate number and track the driver down.
1305279277571637248 2020-09-14 06:56:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> Why is Hydroxychloroquine safe for years treating lots of other things but ‘dangerous’ despite being very successful in treating covid? Trials were stopped here because WHO said it caused blood clots. We have many safe treatments and preventatives for treating blood clots.
1305277082725945345 2020-09-14 06:48:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> What tit came up with that idea?
1305276888009576448 2020-09-14 06:47:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @boblister_poole Sit down. It’s True.
1305276755184357376 2020-09-14 06:46:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ChrisJC12002 If they don’t like camps then why doesn’t government recreate them here and keep them in them with the option and assistance of an escort to return to France? If they can live in squalor in France they can here. 4 star hotels and cash handouts won’t discourage anyone...
1305275887575683072 2020-09-14 06:43:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> Grimsby... @BorisJohnson what the hell has this country come to?

1305274222793687044 2020-09-14 06:36:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> If you were so bothered about ‘peace’ why were you intending to use the international WA  treaty to force Britain to starve our own nationals in Northern Ireland? Shove your WA treaty up your delicate euro tunnel.
1305273397304274944 2020-09-14 06:33:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> It really was wrong of the @Conservative party up allow any remain MP to stand in a leave constituency at the GE... we all vote for party and yet they stand people in elections who then vote against party policy and manifesto.

1305267908017295364 2020-09-14 06:11:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> These masks are more about taking away your rights and liberties to force you to get an unwanted, unlicensed vaccine of God knows what,than anything to do with spreading covid. Funny,covid disappears , in come dodgey tests and COVID comes back with no symptoms 🤷‍♀️

1305227057044090880 2020-09-14 03:29:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> Not half as painful as the domestic turmoil you would create for Britain using and abusing the WA. Sir Bill Cash has stitched you up good a proper, put an end to your control games. Every time you abuse the act, we change our law to stop you . Brexit is great 🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔵🇬🇧
1305226027472478213 2020-09-14 03:25:09 +0800 <trixie_2000> These two thought they had pulled a fast one and stitched Britain up... it’s great knowing how much this is pissing them off ...

1305222727796752384 2020-09-14 03:12:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s all remember @Keir_Starmer is  proud and inspired by Khans London...  everyone else is shocked, horrified and appalled but this is Labours vision for Britain.
1305221955801542656 2020-09-14 03:08:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> All this stink over UK breaching international law transpires  to be the EU abusing WA. With the intention of holding parts of Britain hostage over food movements around U.K. Excellent explanation from the man leading the talks ...
1305221041313198080 2020-09-14 03:05:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> I won’t be donating to anything to do with the BBC no matter how they front it. It should have its charity license revoked for fraudulently handing over money to a far left, extremist , racist political organisation, funds obtained under false pretences #DefundTheBBC
1305220126246141960 2020-09-14 03:01:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> The EU moles are out in force.What is it with Britain’s reputation all of a sudden?What didn’t do UK  reputation any good was the filthy Parliament underworld led by Boles constantly attempting to ignore democracy and put a corrupt,ferral EU project ahead of global partnerships🇬🇧
1305197859281793025 2020-09-14 01:33:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MichelBarnier @BorisJohnson Well you won’t have a problem with UK law ensuring it then. We will protect it, not rely on you liars ...
1305043226055897088 2020-09-13 15:18:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Keir_Starmer @SadiqKhan When a opposition party leader thinks its inspirational to turn the countries Capital  into a crime ridden slum you can see what Labours aspirations are for Britain.
1305039888614649857 2020-09-13 15:05:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JohnnyMercerUK It’s not the ‘scientists’ it’s WHO decided this. WHO also knew this was in China in December but didn’t tell anyone until March and WHO said it didn’t spread human to human. WHO are also colluding with Bill Gates. We were told NOT  to wear masks...until after the numbers dropped.
1304831245428371457 2020-09-13 01:16:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> Every Conservative should vote for it. Absolutely no reason for ANY MP sat In British Parliament not to back this bill to protect this country. Anyone who doesn’t vote for it shouldn’t be in Parliament.
1304771781065084928 2020-09-12 21:20:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MayorofLondon Oh course they don’t see their history in London,they are not from this country you absolute tit.They need to diversify &amp; appreciate this beautiful country and it’s origins,so far your changes have made it the crime capitol of the West. It’s an absolute slum.Needs saving from you
1304759804628529153 2020-09-12 20:32:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Tobias_Ellwood You campaigned  to remain. Of course you won’t back a bill to protect Britain.
1304759441791897600 2020-09-12 20:31:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Soulboy731 No they won’t. It’s not about vanity and throwing your weight about, it about survival of industry in the nation states.The EU bullshitters will bring the block down with these threats. “Let them  get on with it. The project will implode &amp; we can sit back &amp; watch it all kick off
1304758077690912768 2020-09-12 20:25:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> We will start by taking back control of the border.
1304757933830541314 2020-09-12 20:25:07 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt Integrity is putting Britain first. Integrity is not being bullied by EU.Integrity is refusing to be blackmailed.Integrity is running your country not being ruled by tossers like you.The voter loves Brexit. You are so stupid you will bring the block down with you threats #NoDeal
1304757145196519426 2020-09-12 20:21:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt Integrity is not allowing the corrupt EU to have any say in our country . Integrity is walking away from a dictatorship that want to control a non EU states laws, trade and border. Integrity is not being bullied by the EU. Integrity is doing what a democratic county voted for🇬🇧🔵
1304662861348843521 2020-09-12 14:07:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> So Hancock only wants people with Coronavirus symptoms to have a test but thinks offering a test within 75 miles is ok... and then cannot offer them. Why do you want people with it going anywhere? Someone’s got to be in the car with you @BorisJohnson sort this farce out.
1304506324525477888 2020-09-12 03:45:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> Well I hope nobody ever asks me to vote Tory again. FFS... @Nigel_Farage don’t step aside next time...

1304487674863124485 2020-09-12 02:31:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> Dominic Raab is turning into a real hero and role model. First he publicly announces he’s taking the knee for no one other than the Queen and his wife and now he’s blocking labour loons @DominicRaab 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔵🇬🇧
1304486910484766721 2020-09-12 02:28:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s all remember not to buy @YorkshireTea
1304485688440688646 2020-09-12 02:23:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> This was @MattHancock not the others they didn’t want 6 . Only Hancock did and the cocky little shite deliberately leaked it before Boris was scheduled to speak to over ride everyone else. #HancockOut

We won’t  have EU laws conflicting with domestic law.We will control our border.We will control our sea AND our fish will be ours.We will control our own food standards &amp; farm properly.We will have our currency👍🏻
1304360142075555841 2020-09-11 18:04:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @etherkay @EdPlady @Femi_Sorry However you twist the figures remain still got less support votes &amp; lost. Who cares what you think? I will be honest what a remainer thinks of me has never even made it onto the back of the page on the agenda of things that may concern me.Your opinion is not superior to ours.
1304358415175745536 2020-09-11 17:57:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer here’s labours contribution to covid...

1304357861292679169 2020-09-11 17:55:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> How is that awful woman in our Parliament?
1304357509084438528 2020-09-11 17:53:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> We should all be thanking @thatginamiller today for making it clear Parliament is sovereign over International treaties. #thanksGinaMiller 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤣🇬🇧🔵👍🏻
1304356316526399489 2020-09-11 17:49:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> Never seen anything so disgusting. The parents want kicking up and Netflix taking off air. What the hell is wrong with people?
1304355073498243072 2020-09-11 17:44:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> Freedom from the EU will work well for Scotland ... that’s what Dippy Nippys afraid of ... a successful Britain.
1304354615157231617 2020-09-11 17:42:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> She’s right. And Breakfast channels should stop trying to promote it. It’s proved how much people opposed the organisation and its supporters. It’s backfired on BGT and those trying to condone it.
1304354111647870976 2020-09-11 17:40:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @bbyzee_7 Does anyone with any decency,morals &amp; intelligence actually back the fist muppets?This needs categorising as a terrorist set up. Peaceful People should not have to put up with these threats,these accusations &amp; this intimidation based on race.The product of political incorrectness
1304352709114580997 2020-09-11 17:34:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Kevin_Maguire You would. Tosser.
1304352504889724928 2020-09-11 17:34:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ITV @SimonCowell @Ofcom @BGT this was out of order. Targeting a young audience with no warning promoting a highly offensive, dangerous,far left hate organisation is not on.This is supposedly a talent show,not a free media promotion opportunity for race hate. BANNED in this house
1304350489241432065 2020-09-11 17:26:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt @MichelBarnier @vonderleyen in case you missed it. We have moved on. This is a negotiation. This is a trade deal. This is how civilised countries make agreements. This is just the start  . Brexit is GREAT 🇬🇧👏🏻🔵👍🏻
1304349696480206849 2020-09-11 17:22:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> Who wants a deal with that sort of trade partner? @BorisJohnson walk away.
1304349428086648833 2020-09-11 17:21:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> Great . A lecture from USAs equivalent to labour 😬 Her country is a mess... she instigates, condones and promotes that mess... we don’t want advice from @SpeakerPelosi . Go and sort your criminal rioting yobs out.
1304348198400557058 2020-09-11 17:16:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> So some health expert says we can have 6 people in our homes from different households but must keep to 2 M distance... how big do they think out houses are?
1304315911558529031 2020-09-11 15:08:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> British journalism at its lowest... how very boring you are @bbclaurak the anti British , EU fanatical left... journalism and HoL both facing major changes in coming months because of their hatred for Britain. Further proof the left have peed their pants at being outsmarted...
1304299321882443776 2020-09-11 14:02:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BobDowns14 Yes.
1304298861289185280 2020-09-11 14:00:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @LewisHamilton Hey Lewis have you given up the motor racing? Bought yourself a nice ‘green’ pedal bike? Because a racing driver cannot lecture anyone on environmental issues .
1304298360082440194 2020-09-11 13:58:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> What @MichelBarnier needs to understand is the EU creating a treaty to exploit and control a non EU state created so much ‘trust’ &amp; ‘confidence’, British Government has had to act to protect Britain from it. The fact government needed to do it proves we should have no agreement
1304297133554704384 2020-09-11 13:54:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s time Hancock was moved on.
1304293992318808064 2020-09-11 13:41:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> Looks like there’s fraud in the EU  anti fraud office...
1304145951154634760 2020-09-11 03:53:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> So our government let’s in hundreds of illegal social migrants a day &amp; has no power to do anything about it has practically had us under house arrest &amp; isolated from family &amp; friends for months with legislation it created &amp; passed in hours BorisJohnson your priorities are wrong
1304092352508833794 2020-09-11 00:20:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> It really is to much... so long as these ‘Marshals’ target those communities and areas that have continually ignored the rules from day one.
1304090757201092615 2020-09-11 00:14:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> @bbclaurak So what the EU mean is Gove told them to *uck off , stop threatening Britain and didn’t let them push him around.
1304051437253660672 2020-09-10 21:37:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> Excellent... the Gilet Jaunes are back in business 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
1304005249921843201 2020-09-10 18:34:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> That one was kicked out of the party 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🤣
1303993239922446336 2020-09-10 17:46:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JoeBiden Yes. That definitely rules you out.
1303993094191362048 2020-09-10 17:45:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @carolecadwalla It was not illegal to vote leave. It is not illegal to leave the EU. It is not illegal for British government to protect British interest. We know it’s legal because EU fanatics are outraged. Tough.
1303978714099863552 2020-09-10 16:48:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> The hypocrites... Grieve talking about reputation and law. Let’s remember this shit  was working with the EU this time last year. He wasn’t worried about ministerial code when he was colluding against Britain. 🇬🇧
1303976352639524864 2020-09-10 16:39:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> When did we appoint a communist government?
1303777121870000129 2020-09-10 03:27:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @George_Osborne We are not confused . YOU broke International law. YOU are admitting it.
1303706250627219456 2020-09-09 22:46:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BBCPolitics Good... Hancock, needs to wind his neck in.

1303440722507558914 2020-09-09 05:10:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DavidLammy Maybe you would contribute in a useful and responsible way to society if you educated your constituents not to break the law.
1303439544558256128 2020-09-09 05:06:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BillCashMP this man is an absolute genius. What a legend he is.

What does he even do? I cannot think of a single thing he can comment on of any relevance.
1303436508699951107 2020-09-09 04:54:15 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Shalbizzle @vickyda26499171 @Femi_Sorry Off the top of my head in Jan we will be celebrating a complete break from the EU, celebrating all the new global trade deals we are free to make,watching government invest British money in Britain,we will watch Parliament make laws in British interest &amp; we can watch EU fall 🥳
1303435483054252033 2020-09-09 04:50:10 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Femi_Sorry That poll was 1594 people. Let’s stick with the democratic vote of 17,400,000+ who voted leave. Deals weren’t even mentioned because the word ‘leave’ means leave and until remain lost everyone in Britain knew what the word meant. We even had a booklet defining it. GE confirmed it
1303434053677395969 2020-09-09 04:44:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NatalieFoskett @1940sDiva @politicalite Banjo needs to understand the British public will not tolerated having this racist malicious agenda rammed at us.We don’t back that organisation &amp; don’t want a lawless slum country.If you want to appeal to decent people don’t choose a career criminal druggie a your campaign front
1303431023515009025 2020-09-09 04:32:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @SholaMos1 Well I would sooner stand by my country than be an EU bitch any day of the week.British people love Britain...that’s the way it is.We are not changing.We don’t have to justify ourselves to you or anyone else.Have you moved to the EU yet or did you choose to stay here &amp; leave?🇬🇧🔵
1303101707694596096 2020-09-08 06:43:52 +0800 <trixie_2000> Wise words.
1303101006322991114 2020-09-08 06:41:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> This is where the majority of people sit with the race thing... it’s about people not colour.
1303098264447643651 2020-09-08 06:30:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @jess_mcm It’s a bit odd nobody knows they have it until they are tested.
1303094435572600834 2020-09-08 06:14:58 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Femi_Sorry Astonishing that you needed to watch that to work it out. You must be the last one to find this out.
1303093885493796864 2020-09-08 06:12:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock I’ll give you some important advice. Get the GP surgeries open,get the NHS open, get rid of masks &amp; get this country up &amp; running. Pretending there is a pandemic is seriously undermining the party reputation &amp; loosing you alot votes. We have had enough of this utter crap.
1303092109122121729 2020-09-08 06:05:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 @chernowski @brown12008 If you back that set up you do.
1303091916196794371 2020-09-08 06:04:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 @brown12008 Its applied to the electoral Commission to be a political party 🤣🤣🤣 you carry on supporting it but FFS stop bleating on about it. There is always one left wing tit  saying stupid things.
1303090976622170115 2020-09-08 06:01:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 @chernowski @brown12008 Don’t ‘uptight’ me you condescend little hypocrite . It’s a dangerous global movement wanting to abolish   law and order. It’s disgusting and it’s not taken very long for people to see through the far left, hate inciting movement it is.
1303079042816577536 2020-09-08 05:13:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s double the number. Great idea. Let’s get complaining ...
1303078608152526848 2020-09-08 05:12:04 +0800 <trixie_2000> @julierfourteen @TruePatriot1945 Are you taking the piss or living on Uranus?
1303077941023301635 2020-09-08 05:09:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> And Including European fishermen is not acceptable to us... And it’s our sea, our fishing zone and our fish so whats Barney Boy going to do about it?
1303077354294697986 2020-09-08 05:07:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 Classic response from someone who jumps on campaign bandwagons and can’t explain why.
1303077059326025729 2020-09-08 05:05:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 You still haven’t answered the question...
1303075236074721280 2020-09-08 04:58:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> FFS 🙄there. Is. Always. One.
1303074957379936257 2020-09-08 04:57:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 @brown12008 Did you miss the riots,looting vandalism, statues being destroyed? The graffiti. It’s going on all over the world. The leader in the UK got banned from twitter today for inciting hatred. Take your campaign elsewhere. I don’t have time for idiots.
1303074095538503687 2020-09-08 04:54:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> Maybe when we stop funding these countries they will be paying to use dirty,smelly, crumby underfunded facilities and we will get the government funded nice ones... 🤔
1303072666111410176 2020-09-08 04:48:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> No Wagon Wheels and Jammy Dodgers... not the greatest excitement in the shopping year we have had ... in the scheme of things it’s not even close to the great toilet paper crisis... that was a national emergency  🧻
1303071555904253952 2020-09-08 04:44:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 @brown12008 So you have no answer... 🙁
1303071187652804613 2020-09-08 04:42:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DJBrabrook He is a silly old fool... it’s backfired nicely ...
1303070174975791107 2020-09-08 04:38:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> Maybe gold digger can give a generous charity donation to the veterans ...
1303069706337816577 2020-09-08 04:36:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @TruePatriot1945 @brown12008 Can you run it past us how backing a sinister left wing movement that’s aim is to create a lawless,police less society by rioting,looting, murdering , vandalising and inciting racial hatred towards British people will help? That movement has set things back by decades.
1303068256064897025 2020-09-08 04:30:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> Twitter is so useful in reminding this silly old EU dogsbody what he said.
1303067942435860485 2020-09-08 04:29:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> @richardthehun @abline11 @PhilipHammondUK No, he definitely had a manifesto to deliver no deal  brexit. It won him an 80 seat majority. Leave is HUGE🇬🇧🔵
1303067662386372608 2020-09-08 04:28:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @PhilipHammondUK Stop meddling . You’ve had your day. It got you kicked out of party and Parliament . You and your opinions aren’t and never were needed. Bye.
1303066908963622912 2020-09-08 04:25:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> I’ve never see such well fed , clean ,clothed and equip refugees. These leeches on the tax payer are an insult to refugees and those genuine fleeing for their lives.
1303034351047913475 2020-09-08 02:16:13 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Anna_Soubry Red lines seats we’re won the same way yours was. Out with remain. The voter is bigger than you. Remain was outed.
1303033886352515072 2020-09-08 02:14:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> Bastards.
1303015949507981319 2020-09-08 01:03:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Claire_Wilson_ @ghost_wales Can you just run us through how you intend to run the country without cash handouts  from Westminster? Even those whose job it is admit it’s not possible...
1303015468047962113 2020-09-08 01:01:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> Save Rishi...
1303015040707067906 2020-09-08 00:59:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> @fmwales It is about rewriting the past. Admit it  . Stop trying to fob people off. We are more intelligent than you.
1303014379072491521 2020-09-08 00:56:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> He’s only a care taker leader.... he’ll be gone before you can say ‘blocked toilet’...
1303014114831331328 2020-09-08 00:55:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @vonderleyen Exactly how did you get your job?EU works on the progressive,aggressive take over of any nation stupid enough to join,you bleed it dry, then fill it with criminals &amp; then dictate/micromanage every little thing. You rule by force &amp; bullying.Coronovirus response,you did *uck all
1303012569968410624 2020-09-08 00:49:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales Was it Fish? ... from the English Channel?
1303010916032798723 2020-09-08 00:43:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales 4) why is Macron ringing Boris, Verhofstadt frantic and Ursula throwing threats about because Boris is changing domestic law to overrule the WA?
1303007961737056257 2020-09-08 00:31:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> Brexit is damaging to the EU.Being dictated to by the filthy EU did nothing for our reputation.This sends out a powerful message. Britain offers a trade deal...take it or leave it.Preferably leave it, Domestic law will overrule EU law. Tough. How much for our share in the assets?
1303006960460201988 2020-09-08 00:27:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> It was down right foolish &amp; irresponsible of Boris to sign that WA.There was never ‘good faith’, only a power grab .Why would you expect good faith from a set up based on greed &amp; grab that wants complete power over Britain?Government has been stupid letting EU dictate negotiation
1303005943572180992 2020-09-08 00:23:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> Really is time Parliament tackled these ‘zealots’ from the numerous left wing ‘causes’... stop the protests, blockades, vandalism, race baiting, hooligans and other anti social criminal activity. Protect our right to peaceful existence. We don’t want their nonsense &amp; disruption
1302987107204505601 2020-09-07 23:08:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> The least we can do...
1302986912030916614 2020-09-07 23:07:42 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ChrisJC12002 @nutts_mutts What a ridiculous person, Twitter handle and all. The left are definitely unhinged. They didn’t take loosing every vote for 5 years well.
1302978094861553664 2020-09-07 22:32:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock @LBC How about you use your NHS hospitals and surgeries to deliver NHS services?
1302977273432363014 2020-09-07 22:29:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> Have you heard of home test kits? You get them online. They arrive in the post. You return them completed in the post. You could of assisted your ‘constituent’ in the time it took you to tweet.Or is this the socialist dependent ‘I can’t do it myself’ sort of constituent and MP?
1302976113455624197 2020-09-07 22:24:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> We are pleased you thought you could ignore the voter. Mays  deal was crap, now we are getting leave delivered. What a difference a year, a GE, a leave Parliament and PM makes... 🇬🇧👏🏻
1302975209507557376 2020-09-07 22:21:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> No, we don’t need to talk about it. It’s what he won the GE to deliver. #NoDealBrexit it’s a fabulous outcome. Great leadership by Boris.
1302974846259822592 2020-09-07 22:19:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> He won the GE with a manifesto that he would deliver leaving the EU &amp; no deal. You on the other hand  lied,stood behind Mays manifesto to leave the EU,to win a seat in Parliament. You then colluded with the EU against your party,Parliament and voters. Don’t talk about deception
1302956194965975047 2020-09-07 21:05:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> @vonderleyen Would you like a toilet roll Ursula? The EU is shitting a brick 🤣🤣🤣
1302942656604106752 2020-09-07 20:11:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> And the EU have ordered a European ban of reporting terrorists as terrorists. Your point is what exactly? And by the way we left the EU... get used to it... #ClimateHoax
1302900386437697540 2020-09-07 17:23:53 +0800 <trixie_2000> Great news. About time our government put British interest ahead of that corrupt set up👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
1302900061660155905 2020-09-07 17:22:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RichardBentall British people voted out of the German led dictatorship, to be completely free from it and out of it. Get over it. You lost. We left. Move on. Britain loves Brexit 🇬🇧🔵 the EU is a crumbling Ponzi scam.
1302899528568385536 2020-09-07 17:20:28 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RichardBentall We voted to leave.We didn’t vote to stay in CU/SM,that’s remaining.We didn’t vote to retain its laws. That’s remaining. We didn’t vote to concede, make concessions and we certainly didn’t vote leave to fund that Ponzi scam. You have NO idea what leavers want. #NoDeal
1302873799386451968 2020-09-07 15:38:14 +0800 <trixie_2000> Yet again we’ve an out of touch footballer insisting Britain, not parents feed their kids.I’m in his poverty bracket.I ALWAYS feed mine. It’s my job,it’s called being a parent.   Name one thing more important than feeding your own children... 🤔 whose responsible for feeding kids
1302850045516173312 2020-09-07 14:03:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> I was delighted when I heard it... now all these anti British EU dogsbodies are up in arms again. How dare British government put Britain before the scrounging, corrupt Ponzi scam? #NoDealBrexit 🇬🇧
1302849257666473984 2020-09-07 14:00:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> He is beyond disgusting.For years he supported Invictus. Then,like everything else the jealous,demanding,dreaded wife drops it for him. &amp; He let’s her.He is an embarrassment to everything and everyone. He is beyond pathetic. In fact I wish the a Queen would just cut that pair off
1302847913517817856 2020-09-07 13:55:22 +0800 <trixie_2000> @ghost_wales Don’t buy Yorkshite Tea..,
1302847515734224902 2020-09-07 13:53:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> If this is what’s representing Britain it’s a sad day. It seems we’ve gone from cheering them on and wanting them to win to urging them to finish last and hope they loose at everything. Winning has done this privileged fool no favours. It’s a great result...👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
1302845628632924160 2020-09-07 13:46:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> Dianes back. Fluffing things up again... she always delivers us a lighthearted moment in politics.
1302844990314418176 2020-09-07 13:43:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MarcusRashford &amp; I would urge you to stick to kicking your balls about your interfering,pompous,patronising, condescending little know-all.   I’m a single parent.I’m in the ‘poverty’ bracket.Guess what?I feed my child. It’s my job &amp; responsibility to feed MY child. My priority in MY house hold
1302843723827609600 2020-09-07 13:38:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RichardBentall I don’t care what speech you gave. You have FBPE in your bio. You are a facist. You believe in being ruled and dictated to by an outside organisation. You promote oppression of British people. You don’t believe in democracy. Tough. Most of us want the opposite. You are a mess .
1302842628808077312 2020-09-07 13:34:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> I would say it reflects more on the EU that they think that clause should be in any agreement with a non EU country to start with. 🇬🇧🔵
1302841412728360961 2020-09-07 13:29:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> @pmdfoster @FT Finally it seems Boris makes a move. And what a move it will be ...
1302841218297139201 2020-09-07 13:28:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NicolaSturgeon You can’t even run the bits of Scotland you’re supposed to. You are like the EU,a dictator who won’t take no for an answer.If you spent as much time bringing the Union together instead of trying to tear it apart Britain would be a far better place. To right government protects UK
1302681569392570368 2020-09-07 02:54:23 +0800 <trixie_2000> @itssophiemorris Diversitys popularity on a par with Yorkshite tea and Ken and Sherry’s ice-cream.
1302581955297452032 2020-09-06 20:18:33 +0800 <trixie_2000> I find it strange that West Midlands police can declare there’s ‘no evidence it is a hate crime’. Another attempt at a cover up.
1302581579181625345 2020-09-06 20:17:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> So, police have stated there is no evidence that a stabbing spree, killing one &amp; injuring 7 others is a hate crime. WTF is wrong with the police? @BorisJohnson it’s time you stopped being a pansy and called this out for what it is. Where are the details of attacker and victims?
1302540414340214784 2020-09-06 17:33:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> @theorphanmoon68 On the face of it no, he has not.
1302539924575588354 2020-09-06 17:31:32 +0800 <trixie_2000> @zarahsultana The press like all MSM is largely biased towards extreme left ideology. Funny though, that when it comes to a democratic vote we always vote against left wing parties and the media.
1302412161587834887 2020-09-06 09:03:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> @JLFphoto @afneil @spectator You should find plenty. Most of us are boycotting both. You can have our leavers leftovers. You are welcome. And unless you can equal the buying power of 17,400,000+ leavers of ice cream you be won’t help either Coop or B&amp;Js. It’s called buying power...
1302411131030470656 2020-09-06 08:59:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> Looks like police started a fight and police brutality. Britain is in deep shit when the police attack protesters, protesting about the law being broken. @BorisJohnson if this is the best an 80 seat majority can do it pants. You borrowed by vote. It’s going against you next time.
1302323742866116612 2020-09-06 03:12:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> @prwhittle @wiillsjd Unless we have Mr Farage as PM there is zero chance of it happening here.
1302253634089082881 2020-09-05 22:33:55 +0800 <trixie_2000> Notice anything?
1302252601224945664 2020-09-05 22:29:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> I thought it was Macrons army at it again. Savage. One hand they want the public to support the police. The next minute they treat the public with brutally . Is there some deeper plan to have the police and people on opposing sides as a distraction?
1302251833545588737 2020-09-05 22:26:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> Maybe now would be a good time for the majority party to act not tweet. Revise that dangerous set up for the terror set up it is.
1302251342380007426 2020-09-05 22:24:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> Have you seen what’s happening at Dover today?You haven’t got free people. You’re silencing them. In fact the only action I have seen is against decent British people expecting Brexit &amp; a safe country. You let racist set ups, Eco nuts, rapists &amp; migrants get away with anything
1302250389614596097 2020-09-05 22:21:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson @pritipatel you should be ashamed of yourselves &amp; resign.YOUR failure has led to thousands of migrants getting into Britain bought in by France from the EU.We are entitled to protest . You choose to aggressively police peaceful people &amp; put illegals in 4 star hotels
1302249538284027904 2020-09-05 22:17:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s a pity they don’t form a line around the coast and stop the illegal migrants .
1302249377243824130 2020-09-05 22:17:00 +0800 <trixie_2000> There’s no faster way to to spread a tweet than remove it🤣
1302247777058074625 2020-09-05 22:10:39 +0800 <trixie_2000> I hope they don’t see this as delivering Leave. It’s time they stopped treating voters like idiots @BorisJohnson @Conservatives @DavidGHFrost
1302247294469836801 2020-09-05 22:08:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> I can honestly think of nothing more damaging to the ‘real’ green &amp; environmental issues than ER and the ‘Green’ party.     Buying British,local sourced products without shit loads of plastic packaging is the best way to reduce carbon output long term. Having a compost bin helps.
1302246391570464770 2020-09-05 22:05:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> @X_R_Brum It isn’t for YOU TWATS to slow down any emergency vehicle.Piss off with your hoax cause. It’s not for you morons to delay life saving treatment   .And for that my heating is back in full, I’m tumble drying 6 loads of washing and the kettles back on. Wazz up the carbon footprint
1302244027199139840 2020-09-05 21:55:45 +0800 <trixie_2000> Selective impartiality... so in other words the far left, extremist sympathisers can carry on. #DefundTheBBC it’s shit of the shittiest shit there is.
1302242406381780992 2020-09-05 21:49:18 +0800 <trixie_2000> You’ve got us in masks , they’ve blocked the newspapers. So much for free speech. It’s a dictatorship on all fronts. It’s a pretty oppressive shitty country right now.
1302242007759421440 2020-09-05 21:47:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> Brilliant... and how many shoppers have ditched the co op as well we wonder. Superb result .
1302218647742615553 2020-09-05 20:14:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> @XRebellionUK @rupertmurdoch Dear extinction rebellion. British people don’t believe in your hoax campaign . It doesn’t matter what you do you won’t change our minds. You are known as the smelly, idle,piss in a drainers. You disgust most of us in your hygiene neglect as well as your actions. Vile. Just vile.
1302217523593699329 2020-09-05 20:10:26 +0800 <trixie_2000> @GreenRupertRead So from your bio you have never wangled your way into any party so you’re actually mr Nobody. Take your hoax campaign and shove it in your euro tunnel. Have you heard of the internet? &amp; There’s a great new news channel from January...you. Are. Going. To. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Twat.
1302216514855202816 2020-09-05 20:06:25 +0800 <trixie_2000> @pritipatel Don’t worry about that, the over aggressive police &amp; horses are on there way to the coast to clash with protesters that object to hundreds illegal economic tourists migrants arriving each day . This attack on our free speech , society and democracy is completely unacceptable.
1302215197592104960 2020-09-05 20:01:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> @DouglasRob0 So am I. This is about the pubs license to sell alcohol and uphold the law. They have every right to protect it. It’s not an opportunity to play the victim.If you don’t look like your ID tough,it won’t ID you. These pubs need protecting from the attention seeking opportunists.
1302213512446513152 2020-09-05 19:54:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> Maybe if you hadn’t given these stinking, ferral eco nerds a media platform , promoted the hoax and boosted there public profile this wouldn’t of happened. Well done. The media can pat itself on the back this morning 👏🏻
1302212594216955904 2020-09-05 19:50:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> Labour MPs at it again.Why does this woman back any kind of civil disruption to peace &amp; normality?Dreadful party.Dreadful MPs. Backing illegal activity again. @Keir_Starmer @UKLabour ewww. We want so much more for Britain than you can ever imagine.We don’t want a lawless slum🔵🇬🇧
1302211652935446529 2020-09-05 19:47:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> @HonTonyAbbott whatever you do don’t take Sky news up.A woke, far left anti British Eu fanatical channel avoided by anyone with an intelligence. An interview with Kay Burley is a cocky old bird trying to be smart, speaking over you, contradicting you.Wait till Jan &amp; murdochs news
1302159655762825216 2020-09-05 16:20:29 +0800 <trixie_2000> Maybe we could pay Spain to take the rest.
1302151746051960839 2020-09-05 15:49:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson when will you stop listening to this utter pile of horse shit? Stop funding it and stop listening to it. Get the masks off and get on as we were. You’re more Doris Johnson than Boris of late. Come on dear, shake up and wake up #BackToNormal
1302150406584152064 2020-09-05 15:43:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> This vanity project is the biggest waste of money ever, it’s destroying acres of woodland, homes and carving up the landscape. Haven’t found anyone who backs it. It’s a disgusting money pit.
1302149726280843266 2020-09-05 15:41:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MattHancock It’s not fantastic. It’s highly inappropriate what you are telling little children. It’s wrong. Stick to school subjects. What is it with health secretaries? Hunt and know this utter tit.
1302148801533300736 2020-09-05 15:37:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> This is the trouble with labour. It’s all about approaching everything with a skewed far left irrelevant slant .Everyone is allowed an opinion on everything &amp; this is a very important influential role about global trade &amp; Britain’s long term finances &amp; success which he’s good at
1302044902583406592 2020-09-05 08:44:30 +0800 <trixie_2000> It’s a *ucking disaster to every nation state,overrun by scrounging economic migrant sexpests, perverts,rapists &amp; terrorists &amp; criminals.Merkel has destroyed Europe.She will not be forgiven. You cannot import voters.Ask Labour, they have been trying it for years &amp; still can’t win
1302043528726556674 2020-09-05 08:39:02 +0800 <trixie_2000> You are a trade block . Who do you think you are to tell countries how to manage there border? Proof you’re are a bogus corrupt ponzi scam and you and your counterparts are dictating aresholes.
1302042851375747075 2020-09-05 08:36:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt He’s a popular man . Opposing the EU and refusing to be over ruled by the dictatorship and ruin Hungary proved successful and is a vote winning stance. He’s a great leader.
1302042098632462336 2020-09-05 08:33:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt I’d say he has been following what the EU gets up to for voter fraud ... it is the global leader in cheating and expert in  voter fraud.
1302041503334895616 2020-09-05 08:30:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @guyverhofstadt No we haven’t changed our minds your unhinged nut case.We wanted to leave 50 mths ago,now after your arrogant,dictating attempts at a power grab more people than ever want to leave,no deal &amp; watch the EU fall apart. You have no idea how much British people hate the EU🇬🇧up yours
1301996157858652165 2020-09-05 05:30:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @boblister_poole That was obvious.

1301993840308621313 2020-09-05 05:21:36 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EdwardJDavey The fact the left have exploded into a frenzy of outraged horror confirms he’s an excellent appointment. Nice one @BorisJohnson 👍🏻😂🇬🇧🇬🇧
1301993115155341319 2020-09-05 05:18:43 +0800 <trixie_2000> @PaulBrandITV ‘Claims’... by the same people who ‘claimed’ remain would win. There would be a war the day after the referendum if remain didn’t win. And an instant recession. You deliberately use the word claim instead of lie.
1301978678075756544 2020-09-05 04:21:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> Really. why do Tories have a massive majority government elected with a manifesto to leave,no deal?Why did BP have biggest number of seats in EU Parliament?Why did Tories loose all those council seats when May started doing what the EU told her to do?consistent vote to leave🇬🇧
1301976819198038016 2020-09-05 04:13:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> @cabot_phillips @joelrwrites Maybe the stupid foolish students should be on permanent leave. Silly twats cannot cope with life or being human ...
1301976274672418816 2020-09-05 04:11:48 +0800 <trixie_2000> @mrwk1954 @elizabethf100 @zatzi @clarksshoes You just know whenever you see FBPEers there will be a bloody stupid, illogical remark on its way.
1301780744105320451 2020-09-04 15:14:49 +0800 <trixie_2000> How anti Britain are these parties wanting to run the Britain? They never miss an opportunity to side against British people.
1301779116723769344 2020-09-04 15:08:21 +0800 <trixie_2000> @BorisJohnson this is what you have got police officers doing. This is not a police state.We don’t want this hoax covid fandango anymore. Use them against ER &amp; this disruptive climate hoaxers &amp; the BLM lot destroying public property &amp; graffitiing but not people sitting on a train
1301776873735806978 2020-09-04 14:59:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MrHarryCole @nick_gutteridge Our fishermen should be able to catch as much as they like and tight restrictions on what anyone else can catch for a huge price in our sea.

1301774494181273600 2020-09-04 14:49:59 +0800 <trixie_2000> @chris19052 It is a shithole.

1301605091783462912 2020-09-04 03:36:51 +0800 <trixie_2000> @KayBurley @MattHancock Actually your problem with him is he fully believes in a clean Brexit break and new global trade partnerships for Britain and you don’t like it. Tough. Terrible attempt at being a journalist.
1301603288425598976 2020-09-04 03:29:41 +0800 <trixie_2000> @MichelBarnier here’s an idea... the French could keep their vineyards but the wine would be Britain’s. Does that jingle your bells??? Because that is a suitable reciprocal arrangement for we have our water and you get the fish in it.
1301602259533529092 2020-09-04 03:25:35 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Kevin_Maguire How many have you taken in?

1301601345431052293 2020-09-04 03:21:57 +0800 <trixie_2000> That will be the track and trace that doesn’t work because nobody is having that spy thing installed and those that do don’t answer there phone to be traced. And everyone is wearing masks so nobody can catch it, according to you. @MattHancock you are getting worse by the day.
1301600713609555971 2020-09-04 03:19:27 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Lesqueenb Well my drive needs pressure washing.

1301600534525341704 2020-09-04 03:18:44 +0800 <trixie_2000> @montie British people have made it clear. We are not funding that rotten, traitorous set up any more.
1301287191256195077 2020-09-03 06:33:37 +0800 <trixie_2000> The prince and the pauper.
1301287018794807299 2020-09-03 06:32:56 +0800 <trixie_2000> @WinterfellT I definitely didn’t. She was a liability . Terrible PM.
1301286793699119111 2020-09-03 06:32:03 +0800 <trixie_2000> Barnier has lost the plot.
1301286566976008192 2020-09-03 06:31:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> The left won’t stop till we have the military on the streets.
1301286073205698566 2020-09-03 06:29:11 +0800 <trixie_2000> Water cannons is the answer...
1301285750844071936 2020-09-03 06:27:54 +0800 <trixie_2000> The Home Secretary was hosting the Australian trade representative Tony Abbott, Brexit backer . She had a more important offer. Getting trade desks lined up for no deal #goWTO
1301284836250877954 2020-09-03 06:24:16 +0800 <trixie_2000> Wait for WHO to produce some guidelines forbidding it’s use 🙄
1301284287824695299 2020-09-03 06:22:05 +0800 <trixie_2000> @Keir_Starmer He’s following WHOs advice even though it’s crap and self claiming expert scientists, most of who have an allegiance to the far left and back labour.
1301283846802022401 2020-09-03 06:20:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @elizabethf100 @zatzi @clarksshoes Not sure of your point. Do you not wear shoes? It may surprise you everyone else does. Sit down, your in for a shock . We buy shoes for our kids to.
1301281330148388866 2020-09-03 06:10:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @NadiaWhittomeMP They are not asylum seekers. Tories are right. Look it up. We are an Island. We have no borders to flee over . We’re not having economic migrants pile over here. It’s disgusting. Labour lost the GE for a very good reason. We are not being undermined by out of touch labour MPs
1301261696980389890 2020-09-03 04:52:19 +0800 <trixie_2000> @coyleneil @Iromg Everybody has heard your name . In one tweet you went from Mr who the hell  is he? To Mr vile, filthy gobbed , trashy Labour MP-delete-a-tweet.
1300924477379932160 2020-09-02 06:32:20 +0800 <trixie_2000> @EdwardLeighMP Let’s not be weak &amp; compromise.Let’s stick to leaving like people voted for.The ballot didn’t say leave with  https://t.co/izF01eiAnk didn’t say leave but ruled by the EU. It said leave &amp; we all know what that means.We all know what happened to Ken Clarke.Leave the EU.Or you leave
1300898380835684352 2020-09-02 04:48:38 +0800 <trixie_2000> You might consider the size of the enormous population before banging on about social distancing. If you hadn’t overcrowded Britain we might be able to move with a bit of space but no, you keep increasing it.
1300897912101232647 2020-09-02 04:46:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> They have just in effect closed my local hospital by the back door using Covid legislation. In an area that hardly had any COVID when there was covid and has no inpatients in the entire county now.  🤥
1300897409409712128 2020-09-02 04:44:46 +0800 <trixie_2000> Let’s all remember WHO knew about this for months and let it spread. And then said it didn’t spread human to human. Only a fool would listen to WHO.
1300897036590559232 2020-09-02 04:43:17 +0800 <trixie_2000> He’s not buying into the global plan. He’s a hell of a President ...
1300896765294579712 2020-09-02 04:42:12 +0800 <trixie_2000> Unfortunately Matt Hancock doesn’t have the knowledge  of political experience to get this right. He has no instinct and is now running about doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing. He’s causing the party a lot of damage...
1300889767454945280 2020-09-02 04:14:24 +0800 <trixie_2000> Why don’t you give them a break. Get rid of the masks,the stupid rules,policies &amp; risk assessments &amp;  stuff WHO and the covid hoax engineers and save Britain? Save the economy and stop pretending there’s a problem. You look an idiot and so does your party for taking part in this.
1300888937288929280 2020-09-02 04:11:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> 🤣🤣🤣

1300873585880379393 2020-09-02 03:10:06 +0800 <trixie_2000> Not a conspiracy . He’s been told straight he’s not having one for being a divisive traitorous scum bag.
1300873016046497794 2020-09-02 03:07:50 +0800 <trixie_2000> You didn’t mention record numbers of Drs and nurses leaving did you? Funny that. And your Nightingales have got everything. Apart from ITU Drs and nurses so they are just a vanity project of yours. I think you will find the NHS staff are out of  ‘goodwill’ any day now.
1300872335726174209 2020-09-02 03:05:08 +0800 <trixie_2000> @CarolineLucas @ExtinctionR Have you any idea how stupid you are? No wonder greens get nowhere in GE.
1300871994876006402 2020-09-02 03:03:47 +0800 <trixie_2000> Not sure what your looking at. It’s the other terrorist organisation and hoax campaign.

1300692283738730496 2020-09-01 15:09:40 +0800 <trixie_2000> @RoadTaxWhypay @MarieAnnUK So you can’t see the difference between British pensioners,financially independent , buying a property &amp; spending the British pension in Spain and vicious, criminal males arriving illegally from France, with no money,hotel accommodation, free houses and given taxpayers money?
1300690244430422017 2020-09-01 15:01:34 +0800 <trixie_2000> Just walk away. Any deal will be a concession from Britain and massively undermine Britain.

These were real people. Good thing is their families voted leave.
