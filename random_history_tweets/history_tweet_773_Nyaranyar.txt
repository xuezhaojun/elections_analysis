1341137893150969856 2020-12-22 05:46:05 +0800 <Nyaranyar> How to condition the public:  &gt;This is the depression hotline, are you suicidal?  &gt;&gt;&gt;yes: you are under arrest &gt;&gt;&gt;no: goodbye  Eventually, you get the answer you want consistently and you can take credit for resolving a crisis.

Those other countries still hate us and say we owe them every last one of our cities.  They send that aid to keep their buddies in charge.

1332055444563509248 2020-11-27 04:15:41 +0800 <Nyaranyar> This all comes down to people at the height of power who have made this decision, and thrown all the weight of their authority into seeing the decision upheld.  Blaming people on the front line is an ancient trick for falsely absolving the people at the controls.

They go to the journalists, the journalists are against them. They go to the politicians, the politicians are against them.  Silence(d) is consent.

False: -people choose socialism -then they get totalitarianism  True: -legitimate government is subverted by totalitarians -then the polls all say everybody wants socialism  Real dictators claim 100% approval.
1325119813987966979 2020-11-08 00:55:57 +0800 <Nyaranyar> The two sides of modern political conflict are those who obey the media and those who do not obey the media.  If this weren't already set in stone in 2014, then 2016 finalized it. Then we had 2018, now 2020. Everybody needs to stop asking why the media is on the media's side.
1325118938955460614 2020-11-08 00:52:29 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Insisting on universal vote by mail muddied the waters.  Halting the counts on election night muddied them further.  Ejecting certified observers made the waters completely opaque.  "Just f'n accept the f'n results we f'n tell you" is more than just a little bit of a stretch now.
1324917331781324801 2020-11-07 11:31:22 +0800 <Nyaranyar> If this fraud stands, it will become the baseline for future elections.  Halt the counting, one candidate's line moves straight up while halted, repeat until reaching the desired outcome. And then maintain lists of enemies who dared oppose the eternal ruling class.
1324916089667530752 2020-11-07 11:26:26 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Not allowed to look at official records because Twitter says they're """disputed""" - unlike everything Democrats say.

It means they'll spend the next 4 years getting furious revenge for every single time they didn't get what they want, and then next time the fraud will be even worse. Dissent will be crushed.

The British monarchy doesn't do anything *that matters* - even as subjects lives are being radically transformed.  And thus, monarchy remains about as popular worldwide as it was in newly formed USA after the revolutionary war ended.

1324330554884415493 2020-11-05 20:39:43 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @ProfessorF Worth noting that filling out and casting another person's ballot is not the same as helping them vote - especially en masse.  Either Joe Biden is more popular than Obama was, or ballots have been outright manufactured this time. DHS controlled the production; time will tell.

1317141230682210304 2020-10-17 00:31:55 +0800 <Nyaranyar> &gt;What do you want? &gt;&gt;&gt;An open and unfettered market.  &gt;What's that you say, give China one-way unlimited access? &gt;&gt;&gt;An open and unfettered market.  &gt;You mean, let Apple Google Microsoft set the terms for the entire world? &gt;&gt;&gt;AN OPEN AND UNFETTERED MARKET.
1317140589586968576 2020-10-17 00:29:22 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Nationalization is a false solution to the problem of these 'trending apps' becoming the overlords of the internet.  Device makers locked their devices to their own proprietary app stores, where they dictate the 'trends.' This is the heart of what needs to change.
1317118773699112962 2020-10-16 23:02:41 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Friendly reminder that the blue state exodus is inevitable.  USA was built as a republic, to prevent 51% from dictating terms to 49%. Blue states have abandoned this principle and their 49% can easily become majorities in several other states.

1317101294948003843 2020-10-16 21:53:13 +0800 <Nyaranyar> The internet was locked down and put to work for its new few owners, far worse than the pre-smartphone internet's nightmares.  Self-publishing your own content was a brief golden age, between the age of publishers calling the shots and the age of appstores calling the shots.

Phase 1: hiding from authorities Phase 2: bribing authorities Phase 3: considered a tax now  The very concept of monarchy is built upon heroes defending the common folk from vast evils they can't fight themselves.

1316469295518416899 2020-10-15 04:01:53 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @ProfessorF Free falling implies he was off the floor in the first place.  The Democrat machine broke this year if not already wrecked; their primaries were always a clown car of pet causes vs the chosen one. The pet causes' job is hype and hype alone.

A divorce can make this happen with no warning no due process; a judge made slavery legal in pre-1776 America and judges today make marriage increasingly scarce.

1314601945517051904 2020-10-10 00:21:42 +0800 <Nyaranyar> There are no collective thoughts, only rulings applied to masses of people from the will of few.  The only way to measure what masses of people think is to make things completely voluntary. Optional self-isolation vs mandatory curfews, closures, restrictions.
1314601029623660547 2020-10-10 00:18:04 +0800 <Nyaranyar> This all boils down to news shows saying what they WISH to see, disguised as what they DO see in an exhaustive search that took place in and around their TV studio.

1314597330654388225 2020-10-10 00:03:22 +0800 <Nyaranyar> The biggest recurring stupidity I see on the internet is people who think they understand the collective will of humanity.

1314237682067759106 2020-10-09 00:14:15 +0800 <Nyaranyar> People who are currently in their 20s-30s-ish have the unique advantage of being young enough to have touched the internet before adulthood, and at the same time old enough to remember Web 1.0 - the world before smartphones.  Outliers exist, but that's the norm.
1314237067904204800 2020-10-09 00:11:48 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Corporate media didn't just-recently appoint themselves the bureaucratic ultralords of the world; this is how they've been for 70 years and people are just-recently challenging their authority.  People over 40 typically shot through their formative years without a second opinion.
1314236126626942976 2020-10-09 00:08:04 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @conrad1on The thing about mainstream-left's maoist propaganda:  This is leftists' security blanket.  Keeping this makes them think they're doing well; they're gaslighting themselves (again) and they don't know any real polling numbers because they like their dem-oversampled polls better.
1314234793484148737 2020-10-09 00:02:46 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @conrad1on Gen Y / 90s kids / whatever - is the first group of people to hear a second opinion after the official narrative.  For generations X and Dubya this bypasses their scrutiny - the daily TV conditioning show just gets stored into memory as part of their knowledge.
1314227067542630400 2020-10-08 23:32:04 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @conrad1on This is not "young people" it's just the writer's imagination and/or agenda.  Proof: it's an news article.
1313946192431128576 2020-10-08 04:55:58 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @drawandstrike Hillary has a second scandal-chin in her throat.

1313354893386641408 2020-10-06 13:46:22 +0800 <Nyaranyar> The globalist propaganda industry calling itself "free press" has convinced people that the CORRECT way to solve the world's problems is to idly complain and seek scapegoats.  This strategy was USA's official path forward for 30 years. Now it's not anymore; globalists outraged.
1313353934052810752 2020-10-06 13:42:33 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Depressing enough on its own, but add:  1) those still surprised by the same stuff getting worse.  2) those who lump the sides together and call it "we."  3) those who blame the young for the deeds of the old.  4) leftist parrots (everywhere) who reverse blame onto their rivals.

Voting for mainstream conservatism means voting for a voice of "no no stop that's not fair" while radical leftism sprints forward.
1308993144109883392 2020-09-24 12:54:20 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Dems hijack national and stage legislatures every business day to impose their cities' will on the other 99% of the country's landmass.  Republicans stick to their eternal unloaded guns of "that part is theirs, they can do whatever they want with it" as the cancer flows outward.
1308992542961213440 2020-09-24 12:51:56 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Republican politicians are not blameless for what Democrat politicians do in their own territory.  GOP gives Dems absolute and unconditional respect for their leadership, gets zero-ever in return, calls it a fair trade, listens passively when Dems shout they're still owed MORE.
1308990695399723010 2020-09-24 12:44:36 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @conrad1on I don't mean Californian transplants here and there; I mean Californian mayor Californian governor Californian district attorney in a state with 3 electoral votes.  Or New Yorker.  Billions of outside dollars will be spent locking up elections in each small state, each cycle.
1308990062269542402 2020-09-24 12:42:05 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @conrad1on The road out is the literal road out.  People are being attacked in Dem hives for being the political minority, and they can't change the situation BECAUSE they're the political minority, so finding peace means leaving.  The Californianization of the midwest begins *now*.
1308981279417868295 2020-09-24 12:07:11 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Local politicians are in on this every single time; local politicians have street-by-street maps of their cities showing them what to target and what to protect.  The subtle difference between a republic and a democracy is minority rights, political minority especially.
1308980733944500224 2020-09-24 12:05:01 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Likewise the people affected aren't exclusively Democrats.  Even eternal Dem strongholds are a third Republican at least, usually much more. Dem politicians single these neighborhoods out to be attacked until entire communities flee for their lives, keeping their power by force.
1308979409865584640 2020-09-24 11:59:45 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Simply put: if a Democrat holds any office anywhere in a county, then all rights belong to criminals and none to the lawful.

1308812237339914241 2020-09-24 00:55:28 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @KingBroly The entirety of Orange county CA was flipped after election night.

Every single part of media - not just news on TV - backs this side up with everything they've got in their corporate-authoritarian Web 2.0.
1308164069375930368 2020-09-22 05:59:53 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Authoritarian left implements their agenda whether the majority votes for them or not.   Libertarian left exists entirely to plow fields and carry water for authoritarian left.

1306468215233548288 2020-09-17 13:41:10 +0800 <Nyaranyar> And so post-wall women demand marriage at screech-point, so the image of marriage itself further deteriorates, and women who ask men about marriage are cast as villains.  Simply put, they've taken the image of one who demands the universe and offers nothing of value in trade.
1306466542540914688 2020-09-17 13:34:31 +0800 <Nyaranyar> People fear marriage, because they fear government's random wrath, so they delay marriage until after The Wall™ has arrived.   This isn't just skin deep, women's reproductive fertility plummets and their post-wall dating environment reflects that. Beauty products are skin deep.

Dating someone for 10 years without marriage is a conscious decision to not get married during those 10 years, and that many years later it becomes more difficult especially for women.

They were the ones silencing the voices that spoke out.  Kids wearing porn costumes were in gay pride marches during the Clinton administration. "Shut up, nazi bigot!"

1305645668745142273 2020-09-15 07:12:39 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Gavin Newsom won CA governor with 62% of the vote.  In a state of 40 million people.  So the 62% ramps up the violence on everyone else; even on their own side. People will flee, because they have no other way to find peace, then they will vote with their impulses in YOUR state.
1305644587533234176 2020-09-15 07:08:22 +0800 <Nyaranyar> @conrad1on Reversal is what they believe in. Their religion calls for the confessing of sins with a finger pointed outward.  https://t.co/3dR50VSV49

When these places fail to miraculously reverse the parties of their entire local/state governments, the mass exodus will truly begin and mass migration changes destinies for red states.

Hurry up into politics gen-X, before gen-Y beats you to it. If you sit down and shut up now then you sit down and shut up the next 40 years - decisions decisions.

Angry dumb people shout more type more and upload /b/ pictures more than well-adjusted smart people.

1303185549637763072 2020-09-08 12:17:01 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Leftism in a nutshell.  Even if 95% of academics are leftist parrots, rank-and-file leftists will still look to glowing screen heroes for 95% of the decisions they make.

1302758559440973824 2020-09-07 08:00:19 +0800 <Nyaranyar> This is why very rich and very stupid leftist overlords sent out the "burn it all down" signal, after the riots were extinguished from early 2017 to late 2019.

1302192862772166658 2020-09-05 18:32:26 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Regular people don't hold the power to decide how TV speaks about you, how journalists write about you, how "open platform" owners curate you.  These are elites, getting what they want at the expense of everyone else, which appears to include access to other people's children.
1302192089464070144 2020-09-05 18:29:22 +0800 <Nyaranyar> In the 1990s gay pride parades were on TV news, and there were lewdly dressed preteens at every one of them. Mingling side by side with effectively undressed adults.  This entire time, anyone calling others to explain for this is just labeled a bigot then silenced / blacklisted.

1301770191680888834 2020-09-04 14:32:54 +0800 <Nyaranyar> When people lose their livelihood, they lose their tax obligation.  Democrat politicians all feel like victims when this happens in their domain.
1301680756289187841 2020-09-04 08:37:31 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Don't make the mistake of thinking leftists don't know right from wrong.  If they didn't know, they wouldn't be able to consistently and precisely reverse them week after week decade after decade. They know what they're doing.
1301666089873494019 2020-09-04 07:39:14 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Gay pride marches 30 year ago and ever since revolved around publicly sexualizing preteens, and the corporate media dismissed all criticism this-entire-time as bigoted homophobia.

Kick them all out.

1301244763551670273 2020-09-03 03:45:02 +0800 <Nyaranyar> Evictions are already a thundering pain in the ass; managing homes is work too and people deserve to be paid for it. It's not these people's fault the government shakes folks down.  Are we going to finally see an end to the nonstop leftist power plays when Trump gets re-elected?

1300962661031530497 2020-09-02 09:04:03 +0800 <Nyaranyar> They refuse help so they can blame Trump.  Trump sent aid to Puerto Rico, one mayor withheld it from the locals deliberately, said it's all Trump's fault.  This is leftism's nature, just like spiders bite and wasps sting.
1300961711487213568 2020-09-02 09:00:17 +0800 <Nyaranyar> The two sides of modern conflict are those who obey the corporate media and those who do not obey the corporate media.  "Biden's side" is just the media's side, and those who are on the media's side will believe and parrot and judge the rest of the world by what the media says.
