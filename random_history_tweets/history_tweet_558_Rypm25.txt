Diddling rudy is on record in court, claiming no fraud with no evidence. Because you can‚Äôt lie in court. But then they leave court and come and lie to people like you. Trump lost fair and square. Can‚Äôt change that.

1309061593884434434 2020-09-24 17:26:19 +0800 <Rypm25> @MittRomney So use your position to help stop some of this garbage instead of rolling over and doing what he wants. It won‚Äôt stop until people like you start doing things to stop this awful man.
1308821658531110914 2020-09-24 01:32:54 +0800 <Rypm25> @PamBondi you are dumber than a box of trumpers... and that‚Äôs a lot of dumb. To even attempt to support rittenhouse proves you‚Äôre a monster as well.
1308512231760580609 2020-09-23 05:03:21 +0800 <Rypm25> @mtgreenee lmao.... when a dumb blond tries to make a joke against AOC using the dumb blond trope... and end up proving you‚Äôre exactly that.. a dumb blond...üòÇüòÇüòÇ geez you are stupid.
1308494488655060997 2020-09-23 03:52:51 +0800 <Rypm25> @SenatorRomney You‚Äôre a liar like the rest of them. People may disagree with you but thought you were a gentleman and upheld your word and your party‚Äôs word. You‚Äôre no John McCain. You‚Äôre just like the rest of them.
1308493608430047235 2020-09-23 03:49:21 +0800 <Rypm25> @SenKevinCramer it‚Äôs not her seat... where was this thinking back when you liars kept Obama from putting his person on the Supreme Court? The rules are different for you guys huh... don‚Äôt go crying when the power changes and it‚Äôs ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to you.

1307489421114171398 2020-09-20 09:19:04 +0800 <Rypm25> @LindseyGrahamSC you are aware no one is surprised that you lied and couldn‚Äôt keep your word from your 2016 statement. You‚Äôre a coward and a lowlife, among other things.

1305259500698509312 2020-09-14 05:38:10 +0800 <Rypm25> @GOPChairwoman you don‚Äôt really think history is going to vindicate trump do you? Do you really? When he‚Äôs gone we all know we‚Äôre going to find out it‚Äôs much worse than we even imagined. And his supporters will go down with him.

You sound like quite the delicate trumpy snowflake. If you‚Äôre ok with the president disrespecting military families, some naughty words should be ok
1303145181970038787 2020-09-08 09:36:37 +0800 <Rypm25> @CaliKonaBro @iamcardib @America_1st_NOW Wait a second. Cardi b‚Äôs opinions don‚Äôt matter because her songs have language you question, yet you outwardly worship a man who has cheated on all his wives with porn stars and has even stated he would like to be able to date his own daughter. What a hypocrite you are!

I would worry about being chummy with white supremacy rather than an old sitcom. I‚Äôm sure @MrJonCryer would agree.
