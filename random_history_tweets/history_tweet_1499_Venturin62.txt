1317589437757460482 2020-10-18 06:12:56 +0800 <Venturin62> @JoeConchaTV Saving this one.  I can envision a #TrumpLandslideVictory2020 very easily.  But with the media doing their VERY BEST to try to squash the PROOF of pay-to-meet Biden corruption, (proving beyond doubt the media drives a false narrative), you may be right, Joe.

I think that's because the economy was doing so good under @realDonaldTrump that it was able to absorb hits better.  (Except small businesses &amp; restaurants in blue states- RIP)  I'm happy the market is reflecting optimism!

I knew Durham was going to punt till after election, and if Trump loses Durham will punt again until the new regime locks it all down.  If Trump wins? Durham will take some scalps but it won‚Äôt go as high up as many are hoping for.  Hope I‚Äôm wrong tho!

But I think that ‚Äúbase‚Äù is a small (but very, VERY noisy) minority that is bolstered by a complicit and corrupt media.  Reagan had his Blue Dog Democrats, and I think Trump has a shot at winning dems with his law and order/energy stances.
1305581737947410441 2020-09-15 02:58:37 +0800 <Venturin62> @EBOlady @chrislhayes And Trump‚Äôs helping to normalize relations with UAE and Bahrain, with more to come, further marginalizing the vile Iranian Mullahs and working toward freedom for those who live in tyranny.  You forgot to mention that. Interesting.
1305579830222753792 2020-09-15 02:51:02 +0800 <Venturin62> So has anyone figured out why @realDonaldTrump agreed to ANYTHING to do with Bob Woodward?  Better yet, why does he keep giving gasoline to leftist fire starters?  Wonders if Trump will ever wake up.

In the 80‚Äôs Mondale admitted he was going to raise taxes and then Reagan won in a huge landslide.  Today‚Äôs democrats are pretty much collectively saying similar crap daily.

1302034255518871553 2020-09-05 08:02:11 +0800 <Venturin62> @seanmdav @OcrazioCornPop This is interesting. I never thought @JenGriffinFNC would collude with the rest of the miserable leftist media in straining to drive a fake narrative by muddying things so carefully.  She‚Äôs going to pull a muscle on this one.

1302012049459941379 2020-09-05 06:33:57 +0800 <Venturin62> @JudgeandJury99 @GingerC38979225 @jaredlholt Certainly McCain did lots of sketchy shit.   Regardless, Trump was vile at brief moments during the primary.  But Trump was vetted very thoroughly, and no one is perfect. It‚Äôs old news.  The Atlantic is trying like hell to escalate old news.
1302010283636989952 2020-09-05 06:26:56 +0800 <Venturin62> @GingerC38979225 @JudgeandJury99 @jaredlholt Nonsense. Everyone in Trump‚Äôs generation knows American intervention in Vietnam was a pointless disaster for thousands of young men, made worse by the politicians.  I see no context for any of the other anonymous allegations.   Trump WAS vile re: McCain.
1302007038499844098 2020-09-05 06:14:02 +0800 <Venturin62> @CasteMember @jaredlholt Now wait a minute, you‚Äôre not supposed to actually READ the articles! That‚Äôs not what Jared wants!  (Amazing how vile the really media is when you simply check for yourself, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù)
1302006663529062401 2020-09-05 06:12:33 +0800 <Venturin62> @jmeijers @jaredlholt This does matter because truth matters.  The main charge, that ‚ÄúTrump disparaged US WWI war dead as ‚Äòlosers‚Äô, suckers‚Äô‚Äù has not been confirmed. Period. Check for yourself  People that were there said it DID NOT HAPPEN  This is the latest coordinated smear job
1302004091904757763 2020-09-05 06:02:20 +0800 <Venturin62> @jaredlholt More fake reporting. Jared says the AP confirmed ‚Äúkey parts of it‚Äù.  Fake  From the article: ‚ÄúA Defense official with firsthand knowledge &amp; a senior Marine officer who was told about Trump‚Äôs comments confirmed *some* of the remarks to The AP.  NOT key parts

In the 60‚Äôs &amp; 70‚Äôs the leftists protested AGAINST American involvement in Vietnam, (and rightly so) and avoiding service at that time was in the personal interest of many young men  Leftists today use that as a weapon against others now @TedNugent
