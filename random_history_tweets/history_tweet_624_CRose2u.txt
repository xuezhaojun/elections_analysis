1343405410246660097 2020-12-28 11:56:23 +0800 <CRose2u> @BuckSexton That's hogwash.  Follow protocol.  Show courtesy for your fellow Americans (whatever state you live in).  This is a global pandemic - adults cannot act like babies if they have to wear a mask, use hand sanitizer and make some small sacrifices. Most states are not in lockdowns.
1343402994323304448 2020-12-28 11:46:47 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 That's true - everyone can go out - eat - hug - cough. Problem is you don't know who is spreading the virus - and if you are passing it to your friends, colleagues, older relatives, etc. It's not that people can't go out - its the risk of infecting vulnerable people. So Mask up!!

Example:  Chiefs were winning 10 games a yr w/ Alex Smith before Mahomes got there - he has Travis Kelce (best TE in the game).  Josh Allen improved greatly with Beasley, Diggs and Brown &amp; coaching!

That's when everyone pounced with criticism that I should know he lives in a mansion.

All I did was ask a few questions - as I am not as familiar with what Joel Osteen owns or does and the angry outbursts have been unreal.  Anyone who takes advantage of their church is wrong - that's obvious.  So that would be on him.

Obviously I don't know as much about Osteen's personal assets as some ppl on Twitter.  I am talking more in general terms.  If he is not sincere and/or not helping people - then he will have to answer for that to God.

The people going to his church are adults - and they seem to get something out of it. It is ultimately up to them to send him money.  Hurricane - his church was flooded too.

If he gets a car, house- material things do not matter. I read that Osteen's church was not approved for ppl to stay after the hurricane w/ leaks / water etc.-lots of ppl judged him on that.

The "Foreign" aid is not all pork - some of that money goes towards USA interests in those countries - Us troops and also US travelers - so that we have diplomatic relations and support for Americans.

Some just recite Fox News talking points when defending Republicans.  If you spoke your own thoughts- then good for you. I didn't vote for a Republican- They do not consider the common man / woman-their policies benefit the rich.

Blue States bail out the poor Red states financially every year.

How they are managed does matter.  The fact that Democratic run states bail out the bottom 10 Republican states says a lot in itself.

We are merely pointing out the facts of poorly management Republican states from the top down (poorest education, income levels, etc.).  Just making the point on the GOP.

My only interest is in what benefits the average American (working person - because that's what I am). Republicans tend to create tax policies that benefit the very wealthy or large Corporations.  Democrats look for policies for the people.

1339224912515506182 2020-12-16 23:04:35 +0800 <CRose2u> @davidmweissman So sad for Americans - they have had to fend for themsevles during a global pandemic.  Other Countries sent $$$ monthly to help their Citizens - but Americans?  nope.  Even 10 days before Christmas - wealthy, GOP Senators are fighting direct payments to Citizens!  Very sad.

New leadership will come - but when you have power (Georgia Senate seats)  -  that helps even more!

But as a Republican - you look at it as a problem.  Whatever programs the US has in place right now - they are not enough - and they are not covering this base. Period.  Democrats will address it.

Biden is Catholic- and he seeks to lead with peace &amp; love.

1337905134840508421 2020-12-13 07:40:15 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 I think Steve Schmidt said it best - “The Republican Party is an organized conspiracy for the purposes of maintaining power for self-interest and the self-interest of its donor class.”  That's all. That is why they will not stand up for America OVER Trumpism.  Period.

1337899519888023553 2020-12-13 07:17:57 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Trump was caught doing impeachable acts.  The facts were there.  He was impeached w/ the Russia investigation - don't forget that.  The ONLY reason he was not impeached and removed - was the GOP weaklings and sychophants in the Senate.  They protected him. Period.
1337898769862582277 2020-12-13 07:14:58 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 True - but Biden won by what 7 or 8 million votes?  And Trump / GOP trying to overthrow the Peole's votes? Sad times indeed.
1337896157964537861 2020-12-13 07:04:35 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 But they didn’t vote for him

One person in the Senate - Mitch McConnell- should NOT have the power to withhold help for millions of Americans dueof his Corporate interests.  #GeorgiansVoteRevWarnockAndOssoffToSaveAmerica  https://t.co/PilmAYc2Sd

1337768830458802177 2020-12-12 22:38:38 +0800 <CRose2u> @SteveSchmidtSES is 100% Correct.  We have a new broad and diverse coalition - it is fragile and will need work and compromise to keep together.  America is worth the fight.  We will not let these Republican sychophants win. No way.  #GeorgiansVoteRevWarnockAndOssoffToSaveAmerica

They will do anything - including overthrow our Democracy - in order to hold on.  Rules and Laws must be changed in order to protect America in the future.

1337458872974499842 2020-12-12 02:06:58 +0800 <CRose2u> @Myminimine More importantly - the Democrats have to be laser focused on jobs / healthcare / education / safety messages.  No 'defund the police' nonsense - that lost us seats!!!  Use terms like 'reform the police' or provide anger management for police.  Stronger background screenings, etc.

The Republican party has driven down the middle / working people for 40 years.  They are just saying the quiet stuff out loud now.  I would never vote GOP!!

1335320110119198720 2020-12-06 04:28:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @hugolowell I have given other Republican Presidents credit - Trump has been just too cruel and undiplomatic.  I don't like it that he is so interested in his kids and family business - and doesn't put America first.  He should have just stayed as a private citizen.
1335319761736114183 2020-12-06 04:26:54 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @hugolowell other Countries don't like him because he acts erratically - he does not negotiate- so they just started bringing their business to other countries. For example - soy crops - America used to be the prime source - now farmers have no where to send their crops! Its all negotiation!

1334272953366827008 2020-12-03 07:07:16 +0800 <CRose2u> @MadaGeetha @Amy_Siskind Exactly - it should be focused on MORE Funding!  We need funds to ensure better background checks on applicants.  Better mental health awareness and training - community involvement.   This is about selling the message - THEN fixing the problem when you are in POWER. If GOP wins?
1334272465195982849 2020-12-03 07:05:19 +0800 <CRose2u> @losinvictus @maddow That's the point - Republicans jumped on the opportunity to spoil the message.....and it worked.
1334272059891982336 2020-12-03 07:03:43 +0800 <CRose2u> @curmudge_john @maddow 1) Obama is correct.  2) I do not believe 'defunding' the Police is an effecitve message.  The message SHOULD BE "fund mental health training, anger management and mandate community involvement for all Police - in addition to more stronger background screening" = $$$MORE Funding.
1334271440674299907 2020-12-03 07:01:15 +0800 <CRose2u> @anaschmana It's about messaging.

This phrase helped add fuel to the Republicans.  Democrats have to get better messaging.  "Reform the Police"  "Community Policing"  or something like that.  Reform is needed...messaging!!!

There is NO story there - but Trump people keep doing their best to make something out of nothing!!!

Your rich Republican friends have CPA's and Tax Attorney's who find them every loophole to avoid paying taxes (large corporations as well). Corps didnt use the Covid $$$ to help empoyees- they just laid off.
1332843763081863168 2020-11-29 08:28:10 +0800 <CRose2u> @mlauriat Why did people in Red States vote the exact same Republican Senators back in November?  They haven't done anything so far - and they stand behind Mitch McConnell's inaction every time.  The Amerian People need to wake up and start voting in their own interests!!!
1332843097013837825 2020-11-29 08:25:32 +0800 <CRose2u> @BWB716 @Mike_Murley @ColinCowherd There are cost / benefits to living in ANY state.  NY has unique appeal to many - but being the huge revenue producing state that it is - there will always be weak, Republican run states that are riding on it's revenues.  Like Mitch McConnell's Kentucky for example.

1332437903125917698 2020-11-28 05:35:26 +0800 <CRose2u> @kermike Cuomo took the virus seriously &amp; shut everything down to save lives.  He didnt hide - he went on TV every day.  You can always find a clip to criticize him - he was not laughing at the sad toll on lives this virus took!!!  He was the one out there letting people know what to do.
1332437420126638085 2020-11-28 05:33:31 +0800 <CRose2u> @kermike He is making a point that young people do not take the virus seriously (using a random young guy - not a name and an actual person). Young people did push the virus out to everyone else by breaking protocols - and that was his point -not laughing at virus deaths. Cuomo fought it.
1332436664124395520 2020-11-28 05:30:30 +0800 <CRose2u> @ColinCowherd The working People need to vote for a Democratic Senate - so that tax laws and other policies benefit the middle class.  As long as Republicans are in charge - no chance of any improvement at all.
1332436162540163073 2020-11-28 05:28:31 +0800 <CRose2u> @kermike Come on - Cuomo is a decent guy.  He did not joke about anyone dying.  IN fact, I wish the White House had taken this virus as seriously as New York did!  He shut it down so that lives could be saved.  Fox News and conservatives look for any flaw in Cuomo - he had a tough job.
1332432380410388483 2020-11-28 05:13:29 +0800 <CRose2u> @kermike Remember back in March - NY was hit so hard with the virus  - hospitals and nursing homes were the epicenter.  It is totally ridiculous to blame Cuomo for that - particularly when Trump wasn't honest with the people from the start. NY got hit by Europeans - not China by the way.
1332431830784544770 2020-11-28 05:11:18 +0800 <CRose2u> @buffthegrau @WGRZ Come on, man - Cuomo had no more knowledge of how this virus worked in the beginning (with no leadership from Washington) as anyone else. NY got hit hard - and now the rest of the country is dealing with the same sad results.  Trump should have demanded masks from the start!

Even temporarily, some Americans today can only think of their own immediate gratification over the good of their fellow Americans. That is what made the WWII generation so special.

1330194601685233667 2020-11-22 01:01:21 +0800 <CRose2u> @BeeepBeeep33 @ActDontReact After these Republicans refused to hold Trump accountable - and denied the People COVID relief - they still voted for Republcians down ballot.  That's pretty sad.

1330188586247983105 2020-11-22 00:37:27 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Trump should have made a mask mandate back in February.  Economy would have never had to close - ppl wouldn't have lot jobs - and many, many American lives would have been saved.

1329156694492975108 2020-11-19 04:17:05 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @DavidOAtkins Again - No State has produced any actual proof (the videos and lies going on at Fox News and other Trump favorable outlets are not proof - they are propaganda).  A Court of Law - requires actual documented proof.  Trump &amp; co have not produced one iota of proof.  Enough said.
1329156374836744193 2020-11-19 04:15:48 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @DavidOAtkins Trump and all of his attorney's have not produced valid evidence in Court of any voter fraud in ANY state.   Trump can say all of this crazy nonsense on Twitter that 'he won'.  But in a Court of Law - you actually need proof / evidence.  He doesnt' have any.  He is afraid of jail
1329156021596659713 2020-11-19 04:14:24 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @DavidOAtkins Trump is only questioning states he lost in?  So he is targeting areas that are largely Democratic.  There has been ZERO evidence of any voter Fraud.  24 cases cast out of Court.  What evidence does Trump have for misleading the millions of Americans?  It is really unAmerican.

1328822419876950017 2020-11-18 06:08:47 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 yes - Biden won by a huge enough margin - that even if there is a recount - it won't change the outcome.
1328822313320583186 2020-11-18 06:08:22 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 The Secretary of State in Georgia (Republican!) said that there was no evidence of fraud or voter tampering in Georgia!  He said the Republicans are lying.  Trump needs to accept and concede.
1328821741389541380 2020-11-18 06:06:06 +0800 <CRose2u> @senatemajldr Hey Mitch - you had the bill to review and negotiate way back in MAY 2020!!!  You could have negotiated months ago before Americans were on food lines! America is not going to fall for your total indifference anymore.  Stop blaming Democrats and DO SOMETHING for the People!!!

1328763222531387393 2020-11-18 02:13:34 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Biden won in a landslide.  Every Secretary of State has confirmed no evidence or pattern of voter fraud.  Over 11 Trump cases have now been thrown out of Court.  Trump is wasting everyones time.   He refuses to concede - which is unprecidented in American history.
1328761325418401792 2020-11-18 02:06:01 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Yes - that's totally crazy to say.  Violence and hate of any kind is no good.  In general, people want Trump to accept the Peoples choice / votes and do what every other US President has had to do - conceded power to the winner peacefully.  Biden has been very patient.

Donald Trump attacked Barack Obama for 8 years - questioning his Citizenship AS President Obama was leading the country!

1328047366075789312 2020-11-16 02:49:00 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @BeschlossDC Trump has to take that like a man.  After all - it was Trump who was a key attacker of President Obama for 8 years (2 full terms!). The whole birth certificate nonsense.  Trump tried desperately for 8 years to take Obama down.  Trump can't cry when the attacks come his way!

Thank him?  Come on, man.  Just get him out of our White House,  He is only hiding in there because he is afraid of Legal action once he leaves.

It's all bogus anyway - but Republicans are good at pasting labels during elections (or else who would they win?).  Dems have to communicate very clearly if they want to win 2 seats in GA!!

Because of Trump's lack of honesty about the virus and no leadership. FACTS!
1327668102146961415 2020-11-15 01:41:57 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @James_Gorman716 @MuellerSheWrote Trump has let the whole Country down - NO national plan or mandate that could have averted all of this sickness and death.  Businesses needed to shut down due to the terrible handling of the virus epidemic.  Every Country in the world sees it - except Trump supporters.
1327667159544246272 2020-11-15 01:38:12 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @James_Gorman716 @MuellerSheWrote Trump wasn't conducting regular COVID-19 task force briefings anymore - he just ignored the virus - Cuomo knew that! "NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo — group’s leaders urged federal officials to better communicate with states about their responsibilities for a forthcoming Covid-19 vaccine"
1327664661769097217 2020-11-15 01:28:16 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @James_Gorman716 @MuellerSheWrote Cuomo said that he didn't trust Tump - not the vaccine / pharma companies.  He knew Trump was pushing hard for a vaccine before the election.  Not good.  It will still take 6 yo 12 months to roll out! Cuomo wants to follow science / doctors - not a frustrated President.

1327008206439190530 2020-11-13 05:59:45 +0800 <CRose2u> @JennaEllisEsq Joe Biden won. Stop the insanity. Joe stepped back and allowed the states to count the votes. Your guy doesn't like that outcome - that doesn't change the outcome or make it fraudulent. No reports of fraud - multiple cases from Trump lawyers thrown out for 'no evidence'.  Thanks.

It is sad that so many Republicans have shown their true colors in the Senate - marching in step with Donald Trump - but not with the American people.

1326153511436955648 2020-11-10 21:23:30 +0800 <CRose2u> @primetimeJoey 2 Senate seats in Georgia now become the primary focus.  Trump and his GOP party are now seeking any way to grab power - and the GOP is not stopping him in any way.

Trump has taught America a lesson - we cannot just go with the 'honor system' anymore.  Not if everyone isn't playing by the rules!!

They required the states to start counting on Election day ONLY.  Republicans started their own problems with waiting. They made the law!

1325653242290823168 2020-11-09 12:15:37 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar Ok - well they pulled Janine Pirro's show this past weekend because they found out in advance that she was going to spread the Voter Fraud lies coming out of the Trump camp (she is a devoted Trumper).  Fox couldn't even allow it.  That's how bad it has gotten with the lying.
1325652717184880640 2020-11-09 12:13:31 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar He doesn't lie on the news - he did embellish a personal story - not sure why - but he did his time off air and has now resumed his career.  Not like Janine Pirro (who Fox News pulled because they knew she would spread Voter Fraud lies! - even Fox News knows....)
1325652369695252481 2020-11-09 12:12:09 +0800 <CRose2u> @KrystleNoel1128 I don't believe any true Bills fan would not wish the best for Josh Allen.  The only people who cricize him are 'analysts' usually.  And Josh is pretty much balling out this year - so its all good.  This is a great time to be a Josh Allen &amp; Bills fan! #GoBills #BillsMafia 👍🏈❤️
1325651834460049409 2020-11-09 12:10:01 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar No - CNN doesn't lie - they have mixed anchors -  only Fox News has conspiracy theory crazies - and they push lies.

1325650903194546176 2020-11-09 12:06:19 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar Trump will start a TV network - more dangerous and full of total BS like Fox News or worse!!!  Sean Hannity is a danger to America - he misleads the audience nightly.
1325650574768017411 2020-11-09 12:05:01 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar he said he is still going to have those rallies with his cult followers
1325650474721292290 2020-11-09 12:04:37 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar Trump's lawyers were thrown out of the Courts - the Judge said "where is the proof?"  - they said they have so much proof.  Nothing.
1325650351672979456 2020-11-09 12:04:07 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar Trump is not qualified to be President - he should just leave like every other President who lost the vote.
1325650160576323586 2020-11-09 12:03:22 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar That's why they voted for him in huge numbers?  Come on, man.

1325649945559506945 2020-11-09 12:02:31 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar Nope.  Every state accused of Fraud - no PROOF has been found - and the Court has thrown out Trump's foolish lawyers.
1325649821810700288 2020-11-09 12:02:01 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar He says bad things about people -he is President and should be better than that (other  than policy disagreements)
1325649711592845313 2020-11-09 12:01:35 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar In your opinion - because that is what Trump tells you to think of her -  but she is not dangerous.  Republicans make threats - and their followers are very aggressive and armed!

1325649111174041600 2020-11-09 11:59:12 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @ACampaNajjar Republicans have been stating lies on Fox News and all over about the election results.  Everything they bring to a Court in any state - has been thrown out for lack of proof.  Come on, man.  GOP = dangerous to Democracy!

1325296140498112515 2020-11-08 12:36:37 +0800 <CRose2u> @vegix Yes - that's unfortunately motivating for some of them - not good. We need to try to reach as many people as possible and win more races though.  #georgiaonmymind

1325288288769421313 2020-11-08 12:05:25 +0800 <CRose2u> @vegix Some people just vote for Republicans because solely because they falsely believe they will cut their taxes (wish people paid more attention to the #GOPtaxscam).   Democrats really need to fine tune their messages and communication for those 2 senate seats in Georgia and beyond!

NO defunding the Police - actually more funding for Police so they have mental health training. Also - fight the "Socialism" fake label that the GOP are pushing - it has worked in some red states. Set the narrative!

1325276122834198528 2020-11-08 11:17:04 +0800 <CRose2u> @JuddLegum @Gr8fulchik2 Republicans are in a panic to grab more power - the Supreme Court is not enough for them!  They are laser focused on the 2 GA Senate seats.  Dems need to get the message out (Healthcare  &amp; jobs) and pull together! #georgiaturnsblue
1325275645400772615 2020-11-08 11:15:10 +0800 <CRose2u> @cindi_abbott yes - our work is far from done.  Republicans are already talking about getting power back.  They are slick and will do anything to win - they have proven they have no integrity.   Right now - the focus is on GA Senate seats! #georgiaturnsblue
1325275360771117056 2020-11-08 11:14:03 +0800 <CRose2u> @MB3252 @GOP Very concerning that the weak willed Republicans - who refused to pass a bill to help the People during a global pandemic - are ALL re-elected!!!  Very interesting - and unlikely to say the least.

So brown babies don't count, right (fake Christian!).  Stop the hypocracy.  The #GOPtaxscam only benefited rich people - not the working people.! GOP weak and wrong for working people!!!

Medicare and Social Security are 'social' policies - everyone works, pays in and has the earned benefit.  Healthcare would be the same - even as an option in case people want their own private insurance.

1324575659868434432 2020-11-06 12:53:41 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 McConnell pushed through a Judge instead of a Stimulus for the People - and Red KY still voted him back in!
1324575402795388928 2020-11-06 12:52:40 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 People have said that - but Biden is President and I think he will bring people together.  He said he will put some Republicans in his Cabinet for unity.
1324575141750333440 2020-11-06 12:51:37 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Hannity and Carlson are dangerous - they spread conspiracy theories - they make Democrats look bad no matter what - they are not fair at all.
1324574958312476674 2020-11-06 12:50:54 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 yes - Fox was pretty quick on that one - Trump was not pleased at all
1324574706318614528 2020-11-06 12:49:54 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 oh i know it
1324574664321019904 2020-11-06 12:49:44 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 On that - we can agree!
1324574529482559494 2020-11-06 12:49:11 +0800 <CRose2u> @BumpNrunGilm0re 👍
1324574113319575552 2020-11-06 12:47:32 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Every Secretary of State monitors their state voting.  US has very low if any voter fraud.  This is all Fox News BS - they are upset.  They should stop doing it - unless proof is found.  The authorities respond if there is proof.  So far?  nothing.
1324573738483011584 2020-11-06 12:46:03 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Its not unusual - some states do take longer - it has happened before.  Trump is just pushing these theories because he doesn't like the results so far.
1324573442897858561 2020-11-06 12:44:52 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 No - all of the states have to follow their state legislature.  They have to follow the rules.  If they have a law that allows mail in ballots for a certain amount of days - they have to honor them.  They all follow local laws.
1324573051334385664 2020-11-06 12:43:19 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Yes - but lies and conspiracy theories are dangerous.  Trump supporters carry guns and get aggressive if he urges them on.   Multiple states - Trump is behind - so he just has to man up to the results.  Making stuff up - Judge threw out - his lawyers had NO proof!
1324572399736705024 2020-11-06 12:40:44 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Twitter did put out a notice that they would remove all unfounded voter fraud or other conspiracy theory stuff.  Trump - Sean Hannity - they are pushing theories that are just not true (no proof).  I get it - Trump is not happy with the results - but you still can't lie!

1324571856213594113 2020-11-06 12:38:34 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Why?
1324571680065421313 2020-11-06 12:37:52 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Listen to the PA officials - they covered that in the news today.  It's all baby nonsense.
1324571541632372736 2020-11-06 12:37:19 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Republicans wouldn't allow PA to start counting votes early - they had to wait (per the State GOP).  So now they don't like their own rules???
1324571397000187905 2020-11-06 12:36:45 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 PA officials (who by the way are following the Republican state legislature rulings) - are following the law.  Looking for excuses is child's play.  Trump's fake law suits are getting thrown out.  I saw Hannity having a fit - very bad for the Country.
1324571058284974085 2020-11-06 12:35:24 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Come on, now.  They have poll watchers - they are following the law in PA.  Trump is just throwing a tantrum because he doesn't like the outcome.  How come he wasn't worried about poll watchers in 2016?   Ah.....because he liked the outcome!  Hillary was classy - she conceded.

1324560999651880962 2020-11-06 11:55:26 +0800 <CRose2u> @KamVTV Joe got the votes!!! Because he had enough respect for the American people to lead by example - wear a mask!  Protect each other and then we can return to normal sooner.  Trump didn't do that - the Country is now in a spike - again.  That's why Joe got the votes. 😉👍🇺🇸❤️💙🌊✨
1324560657740636160 2020-11-06 11:54:04 +0800 <CRose2u> @chadphillips31 @KamVTV Because Joe Biden was respectful and honest about the seriousness of the COVID-19 protocols.Unfortunately, Donald Trump felt the need to mislead his followers and not wear a mask - which has led to another spike in America and costing American lives.  SAD!!! So Joe got the votes!

Corporate welfare - rather than programs to ease middle class- working people's pain. Hundreds of billions that profitable corporations are siphoning out of your pocket.

Trump is the President - but he and his messages are not responsible for what's going on in the Country?

Why is it so wrong to point out Leadership deficit in the White House? On #BLM on #COVID-19 on simply unity in America? Many of these 'riots' &amp; outbursts could have been soothed if partnership w/ Govs / Mayors!

Good Cops agree that Bad Cops need to be help accountable. Leadership in Washington says nothing (which would soundly STOP the people who are upset about it).  Why not ask where is the Leadership- unity to do better?

I have good friends who support Trump (and we are very close regardless of our political leanings).  They support him due to perceived tax advantages and judge apointments that lean to their religious beliefs.
1323292764562477056 2020-11-02 23:55:55 +0800 <CRose2u> @Marc_Defiant @Para_Doc Trump is an excellent sales person (charisma - reality TV Star, etc.) - people like to follow that and Trump supporters (especially the conspiracy theory believers) believe he is a superman. Sadly, Trump in the White House has exposed his extreme views and policies. 🥺🙏🌊

I've never been afraid in America before - no matter who was in the White House. This is a first - I will admit.  When extremism is in the WH- it will incite extremism on the other side as well.

1323110655071789059 2020-11-02 11:52:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @RepsForBiden I do admit that there are extremists on both sides.  However, there seem to be more cult followers and Trumpers on Trumps side (not normal Republicans - but Trumpers).
1323110316448849920 2020-11-02 11:50:56 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @RepsForBiden Did you see that Trump Train terrorizing the Biden bus?    They are too aggressive - Trumpism!
1323110191584415744 2020-11-02 11:50:26 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo Yes - we all do not like it - I totally can't stand wearing a mask.   But - those states that did not push masks - are also now having major virus spreads and filled up emergency rooms.  Asia is now returning to more normalcy - American can do that too - if everyone gives effort.
1323109796820799491 2020-11-02 11:48:52 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @RepsForBiden I know Trump has a lot of supporters and that terrifies me.  They are aggressive and only care about themselves - not the greater good for America.  They are for Trumpism.

1323109118983503873 2020-11-02 11:46:10 +0800 <CRose2u> @FockerRN529 @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo Yes- you can't push people or they feel a loss of control and get frustrated. I think just letting people know that we are doing this to protect Grandma -or Grandpa and your friend with diabetes - until we have a vaccine.  Or I like to use "Do what your favorite Bills are doing!"
1323108705437683718 2020-11-02 11:44:32 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @RepsForBiden Trump is very lucky to have such a loyal, dedicated person like you defending him at every turn.  He really is.  I, however, have already voted for Joe Biden proudly.
1323108508225671171 2020-11-02 11:43:45 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo I totally understand that! We are all frustrated.  I let the kids know that they are doing this to protect Grandma and some of their friends who have other diseases.  They know it is only temporary - and they can still play sports outside - just w/ precautions. Like the Bills do!
1323107494021967873 2020-11-02 11:39:43 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo yes
1323107184884985856 2020-11-02 11:38:29 +0800 <CRose2u> @FockerRN529 @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo I think they are working on the "knocking it out" part.  In the meantime, in a Country of 300 million people - we can all be slightly inconvenienced to save some lives and stop the spread.  I don't think that's too much to ask.  When a vaccine is developed - that will be huge.
1323106926713098241 2020-11-02 11:37:28 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo Look - I am not going to say anything about your personal loss - and I am sorry to hear about it.   I am speaking in general terms - in a society this large - people have to think about others - not just their own inconvenience.
1323106630251274241 2020-11-02 11:36:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @m1dn7ghtrider @kirstiealley  https://t.co/oCWMKnsLYL
1323106272540065797 2020-11-02 11:34:52 +0800 <CRose2u> @FockerRN529 @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo Like I said - if everyone is masked up - less particles flying around.  I'm not a Doctor - but CDC guidance is to wear a mask, socially distance and wash your hands.  That doesn't seem to be too much to ask - until a vaccine can be developed.  Focus: the greater good.
1323105564361216007 2020-11-02 11:32:03 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo I understand what you are saying.  Doctors have responded to this question and they said that a patient might have had underlying conditions being treated - but were not dying w/ treatment.  Catching COVID-19 was enough to push them over the edge - and thus, caused the death.
1323104905788379136 2020-11-02 11:29:26 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo But those who are older - and even younger people with serious conditions (diabetes, asthma, etc) - are vulnerable.  They live with other people - usually not alone. That is the bottom line - they are not in a bubble.  Therefore, those of us interacting with them need to mask up.
1323104530096152576 2020-11-02 11:27:56 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo And I"m sorry for you and your wife's loss - 🙏
1323104429139238914 2020-11-02 11:27:32 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo The whole point is that COVID-19 will affect the most vulnerable - and if they have another condition - it can potentially cause their death.  That's enough for me to try to protect them from younger, healthier people - who might inadvertantely spread the virus. If a mask helps..
1323103303211880449 2020-11-02 11:23:04 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo We live in a society - which is a community of people.  You may feel safe - but what about your neighbor - who might live with their grandparents?  They might be just fine - but what are they bringing home to their family?  That's the point. To protect the most vulnerable.
1323102638502780929 2020-11-02 11:20:25 +0800 <CRose2u> @DelReid @AaronQuinn716 @26shirts ❤️👏💯  https://t.co/YmyykGIDph
1323102429034983425 2020-11-02 11:19:35 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo With all due respect - you are not a doctor and neither am I - I don't buy into these bs statements by the Trump Campaign that doctors are lying.  sorry - that's just bs.
1323101943204597767 2020-11-02 11:17:39 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo I respect you and your family enough to wear a mask.  That's the bottom line.  It might be an inconvenience - but I would rather do the right thing - even if it saves one life - than risk my 'freedom' and potentially put others at risk.  That's my only point.
1323101630926127105 2020-11-02 11:16:25 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo It's OK not to want to be controlled. I understand that. But the way I look at it is for the greater good. I don't wear a mask in my car or my home or walking my dog.  It's only when in stores or work or around other people.  That's not too bad - considering it might save a life.
1323101237995311106 2020-11-02 11:14:51 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo That's your 'theory' that there is an agenda (sounds like a Fox News theory to me, but I digress).  The bottom line is that Americans are dying, infection rates are rising - and the estimated dead by year end = 400,000!  Trump was pushing that bs line about non-Covid deaths. 🧐
1323100297024184323 2020-11-02 11:11:07 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo You are changing the topic,  If you - wearing a mask - a minor inconvenience - would help to save lives - is it really too much to ask of you??  I think lives matter more than inconvenience...but that's just me.  America is at 230,000 lives lost - the infection rate is increasing
1323099803119718400 2020-11-02 11:09:09 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo We are at over 230,000 deaths and counting - the number is climbing daily in America.  Those lives matter.  They are someone's family, friend or coworker.  To me - doing something as minor as wearing a mask, washing hands and socially distancing - is a very small inconvenience.
1323099459941736450 2020-11-02 11:07:47 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo No agendas - this is a global pandemic.  If my slight inconvenience of wearing a mask and trying to socially distance saves even one person's life - it will be worth it to me.  How do you feel about that?   🤔
1323098990737453056 2020-11-02 11:05:56 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo There is a flu vaccine.  Not everyone takes the vaccine - that is a personal choice.
1323098754002669571 2020-11-02 11:04:59 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo Sorry to hear of your loss.  That is the very point - to protect those who are more vulnerable.  I don't mind wearing a mask - which has drastically reduced the spread and incidence of virus in Asia - if it means saving one life.  How about you?
1323098371872182277 2020-11-02 11:03:28 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo There is a vaccine for the flu - which drastically reduces spread and disease for those who take it.  No vaccine or known treatment for COVID-19 yet - once there is?  That's a different story.
1323097067192025088 2020-11-02 10:58:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo Dude - over 230,000 Americans are dead - and in the Southern States Emergency rooms are full. Businesses are shut down due to the airborne nature of the spread of this virus.  We do small things like wear a mask, social distance  - and we can knock it out.  Why is that a problem?
1323096253027258369 2020-11-02 10:55:03 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo They were forced to correct those reports - because they were receiving pressure from the White House to include incorrect information (misleading Americans) - as Trump disapproved because COVID-19 was not good for his re-election bid.

1323092237971017729 2020-11-02 10:39:06 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo CDC Guidelines (per their website): Cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. The mask is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. Everyone should wear a mask in public settings.
1323092065492865026 2020-11-02 10:38:24 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo 70% from Mask Wearers?  I would love to see the CDC statement on that (this was likely simply Fox News propaganda).
1323077884299350018 2020-11-02 09:42:03 +0800 <CRose2u> @rockydm92 @NYGovCuomo Why?  If wearing a mask protects you and those around you - there is nothing wrong with that.  In fact - its cool to do.  I wear a mask and I am proud to do it.  Rather than pass the virus around to my friends, coworkers an family!

1322749764287504385 2020-11-01 11:58:13 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Biden and Obama had to fight for years with the Republicans to get Obamacare through -  unfortunately, the Republican Senate took away a lot of the things that they could have used to make the law more affordable for all.   Trump is signing executive orders right before election?
1322749406593036289 2020-11-01 11:56:48 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Republicans are rich and just out of touch with America.  They must be voted out.  They are bowing to Trump - NOT to the American people.
1322749170600628224 2020-11-01 11:55:52 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Executive orders are a big show.  They do nothing and are not agreed to by the body in Congress who controls the purse strings.  Its just show and tell - so he gets re-elected by those that are fooled by it.
1322748979210235904 2020-11-01 11:55:06 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Executive order -because he is worried about his re-election - why didn't he do something in the law 2 years ago? 3 years ago?  he has no plan   executive orders are not laws - he is just covering for himself.
1322748762146639872 2020-11-01 11:54:15 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 no - but Republicans are focused on corporate profit and the wealthy - not the general population
1322748641019387904 2020-11-01 11:53:46 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 It didn't have to be that way - Republicans did everything they could to undercut the healthcare law - they never wanted the Corporations to reduce profits. It was never about the people for Republicans.  If Biden gets in - and gets the Senate - he can make it more affordable!!!!
1322748326899572737 2020-11-01 11:52:31 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 Republicans controlled the Senate at the time the law was passed - Democrats tried to include a public option so that there would be greater competition on pricing - but Republicans refused to allow it.  They wanted Insurance companies to have profits over people. RESEARCH!

Republicans are determined to erase this law instead of improve it!
1322747479109095424 2020-11-01 11:49:09 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 That's rioters - and some came from out of state to make the actual protesters look bad!

Again - no National or grand plan - just tiny steps that did not stomp down the spread.  People are getting sick still - and numbers are rising.  Very bad.

Americans actually care about each other - they would not risk spreading a deadly disease just to please one person.  A President would care - and NOT put people in this position.  It's very sad!  Adults acting like spoiled children who will not lisent.

They have pushed to pack the Courts for the past 40 years - and Democrats have fallen behind playing by the rules. As you can see, Republicans do not apply any norms or rules to themselves. Dems need to respond!

Most rich people pay nothing- they have tax accountants &amp; lawyers who find loopholes for them. The little people actually pay taxes!  What we want is for working people to get a break! &amp; rich pay their fair share!

1316772401582084103 2020-10-16 00:06:19 +0800 <CRose2u> @Lis_Smith I agree with Mayor Pete - you need to go on Fox News and give them some facts for a change - instead of the conspiracy theories that the viewers are sadly fed every day.  Pete threw it down and  the silence left in his wake is just totally awesome.  Well done, Mayor Pete!

1316592782019121153 2020-10-15 12:12:35 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 yeah - its crazy.
1316592456062963713 2020-10-15 12:11:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 It's crazy - the economy has changed so much.  Definitely need to make adjustments - and make Amazon pay taxes !
1316592278975246338 2020-10-15 12:10:35 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 Trump is an entertainer - its hard not to like him.  I don't dislike him personally - he is a flawed human like the rest of us.  I just don't like his extreme views - and crazy followers.
1316591989790584832 2020-10-15 12:09:26 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 no - i have never heard of another President doing what Trump's guy in the Postal Services has done!
1316591872219938816 2020-10-15 12:08:58 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 Yes - i think he will leave -  Nancy said she will fumigate the White House if he won't leave  lol    she was kidding
1316591761314197507 2020-10-15 12:08:31 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 I can understand that - family is a huge influence - very hard to break that
1316591399605764096 2020-10-15 12:07:05 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 right - but I don't like it that Trump is saying he won't leave if he loses?  And taking out mailboxes so minorities can't vote -  Republicans know if the majority votes - they are out
1316591239010160640 2020-10-15 12:06:27 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 you have to listen to both sides -  I'm for the working people - so I dont agree with Republicans very much
1316591050136473600 2020-10-15 12:05:42 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 yes - but he can't tell other countries what to do - he has ot use Diplomacy too -  some Countries said 'fine' - we'll trade with someone else - and farmers lost on that
1316590869450035200 2020-10-15 12:04:59 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 I get blocked all the time  lol    i don't block you - because we do not attack personally -  its just general talk about both sides
1316590695608659969 2020-10-15 12:04:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 And those other Countries have made the USA pay - by not trading with us - and getting their farming and other goods from other Countries!
1316590553837056000 2020-10-15 12:03:43 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 That's all talk.  Trump has had 4 years - no healthcare plan (nothing has come out - no details???) - no drug reductions - that's all for the election.   Republicans just keep saying let's get rid of Obamacare - but replace it with what????   Nonsense.
1316590160247742464 2020-10-15 12:02:09 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 I agree - none of them are perfect or all right - there is always something people get annoyed at!
1316589836351008768 2020-10-15 12:00:52 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 he is just a showman!
1316589638069485568 2020-10-15 12:00:05 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 i just don't get it
1316589475263385600 2020-10-15 11:59:26 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 you are reasonable -  which is why I'm shocked that you still support Trump!
1316589326776631296 2020-10-15 11:58:51 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 yes - I know that -  but some of them are scary -  going to rallies with no mask and stuff like that?   why risk your health - your family?
1316589020588191744 2020-10-15 11:57:38 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 well - we have had 4 years of Trumpism / cult.  Enough of that!
1316588714441744384 2020-10-15 11:56:25 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 well the Country needs a positive leader -  Trump divides people -  we need good change and I think we will have it.
1316588374468296706 2020-10-15 11:55:04 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 that's all petty stuff
1316587984389656578 2020-10-15 11:53:31 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 how is she a phony?  she is fighting for more money for working people impacted?
1316587654474084353 2020-10-15 11:52:12 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 that's only because Republicans tell you to hate her -  Pelosi is fighting for the people!
1316587256744902658 2020-10-15 11:50:37 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 because they can pay - it doesn't hurt their lifestyle.  working people are getting evicted while McConnell laughs that he is holding off Democrats - sad.
1316587046224396290 2020-10-15 11:49:47 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 yeah - the stimulus was too low - for families - they probably used that in a week.   The rich do not need help - give more to the people!
1316586626982834181 2020-10-15 11:48:07 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 he started the failed 'trickle down economic' theory  (give the rich tax breaks and it will trickle down to the workers).   It hasn't trickled down in 40 years - and the rich just get richer.  Corporations horde the money - and dont always hire more people  - not good.
1316586341199736833 2020-10-15 11:46:59 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 Pelosi doesnt want more breaks for the rich - they are doing fine.
1316586213655089152 2020-10-15 11:46:28 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 yeah - sounds good in theory - but they got huge tax breaks in 2017 -  and now they are laying off millions of American workers?     Unlike Ronald Reagan taught you -  it does NOT trickle down!
1316585752936026112 2020-10-15 11:44:39 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 McConnell - as per usual - is fighting for the rich man / woman.  He is not relenting to Nancy Pelosi  - she is looking out for the vulnerable.  Its not cool.   We need change in the Senate.
1316585278233088005 2020-10-15 11:42:45 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 McConnell wants additional tax breaks for the rich and large corps - Pelosi wants more for the people and local / states so they can take care of the unemployment and food needs -   whose side are you on??
1316584906194116608 2020-10-15 11:41:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 you are rich - you are a Bills fan - which means you are rich in spirit!
1316584644775739397 2020-10-15 11:40:14 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 he could have helped working families wiht the #GOPTaxScam - instead - he helped Billionaires and huge Corporations!
1316584507135463424 2020-10-15 11:39:42 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 the people need help - the people need support until the economy opens back up - families / kids are paying the price.  It's not right - and it didnt have to be that way.
1316584089479254021 2020-10-15 11:38:02 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 The only reason wages were up were because of employment laws coming into the light - raising wages - and no longer able to ask current pay rate.   Trump didn't do anything for the working person.
1316583855067979776 2020-10-15 11:37:06 +0800 <CRose2u> @Megawatts55 Republicans KNOW they can't win if the American people vote.  So they do everything in their power (and they are very crafty) to suppress the vote.  Ignore them - vote any way you can - make a plan - just vote!
1316583560732704768 2020-10-15 11:35:56 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 economy for who?  very rich and large corporations are doing GREAT.   the average man / woman suffers
1316583384068612097 2020-10-15 11:35:14 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 that is the Republican opinion to keep their voters (oh, it could have been much worse!).   It could have been MUCH better wtih a National plan an listening to science and experts - instead of calling it a Democratic Hoax!
1316583132607524864 2020-10-15 11:34:14 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 Did you see Trump's 'answers' at the recent Town Hall he did?   Come on, man.
1316582975891361792 2020-10-15 11:33:37 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 No need to make excuses for Trump - he didn't execute a National plan soon enough to save lives and save jobs!!! Millions laid off - and economy suffering.  Didn't have to happen.
1316582657497665536 2020-10-15 11:32:21 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 😂  Trump forced the Governors to "Thank him" for doing his job!  Wouldn't want to hurt his huge EGO!
1316582461627924482 2020-10-15 11:31:34 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 There are tapes.  Bob Woodward taped him - and wrote a book about it.  SAD!
1316582155020103680 2020-10-15 11:30:21 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 Travel ban on China?  Come on, man - everyone did that.   NYC got infected by people traveling in from Europe!  Stop blaming Cuomo - that's just covering for Trump.  Trump admitted he knew - and didnt warn the people.  Masks would ahve saved lives and jobs!
1316581745429557254 2020-10-15 11:28:43 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 They don't have to make stuff up on Trump!  Its all in his taxes - who does he owe $421 Million dollars to???
1316581603032866817 2020-10-15 11:28:09 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 But that's just it -  Trump does NOT tell it like it is.  He did not tell the American People that they needed to wear masks back in February.  That would  have saved lives and all of the jobs / layoffs !!!   Sorry - Trump is for Trump.
1316581169421529089 2020-10-15 11:26:26 +0800 <CRose2u> @Jordandelmont2 @LisaHagan7 Clinton endured hours of Senate hearings on those emails and Bengazhi - they found nothing!  Please - if they found anything - Trump would have pounced.  that is simple common sense.  Hillary was attacked - and when they couldn't find anything - they just made stuff up.

They don't agree with the President on policy - and Rachel Maddow does her research - she doesn't just throw stuff out there.

He has been a good ambassador for them - very entertaining  - especially when on Fox News.  That said - additional national experience would only help him in the future.

Aside from that - he seems sincere and likable.

1308129920942583808 2020-09-22 03:44:11 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills @milesjreed Why do you and your kind - always resort to name calling and insults when you are proven to be wrong? Stick to facts (if you have them handy) - I know i do. Tell me that the Republican party is NOT made up of mostly rich, white men? That's a fact. Kamala adds wonderful diversity!

The truth is in a Country of over 300 Million people - you are never going to have a tiny Government.  Someone has to organize   Fire, Police, Sanitation, Soc. Security, etc

1307455026252722176 2020-09-20 07:02:24 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills I wish he would THINK before he says certain things - then people wouldn't be so upset all the time.  If he thinks he can do better on healthcare - fine - just outline your policy!  But don't tear down what people are relying on before you replace it?  That's people's lives.
1307454397874614283 2020-09-20 06:59:54 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills I do not like it that he was caught on tape in February admitting that he knew the virus was airborne, deadly and easily transmittable.  Then he went on the news and said "This is a hoax - the Democrats are after me - they want to undermine my election bid".  Lies and BS - BAD!!!
1307453957107834880 2020-09-20 06:58:09 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills It is not personal with me - I do not like his regulatory (environment) and immigration policies. I do not like it his insistance on destroying Obamacare (because he wants to get rid of anything Obama did lol). It would be one thing if he had a healthcare plan - be still waiting!
1307453430026338315 2020-09-20 06:56:03 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills Honestly - I just wish he would  think before he speaks sometimes.  He makes it obvious that he is President to his followers - not the whole Country.  That's not helping people to come together either!

1307451243267321862 2020-09-20 06:47:22 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills Fox News has created a fictional conservative land where any Democrat is wrong - that has proved to be harmful to America
1307450952794935299 2020-09-20 06:46:13 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills I see the right as more armed and dangerous- there are some criminals jumping on the protests - but most of the people are peaceful!
1307450448765317123 2020-09-20 06:44:12 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills I think there are extreme nut jobs on both sides.  However- the militias coming in on the right are emboldened by Trump - not good!

1307404051194286081 2020-09-20 03:39:50 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills @milesjreed I don't watch just CNN - I actually watched Fox News last night.  Instead of honoring #RIPRuthBaderGinsburg - they were attacking Cuomo and DiBlasio (of course - never Trump).  So watching them isn't doing you much favors either, friend.
1307402149580726273 2020-09-20 03:32:17 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills @milesjreed no - I am just repeating the words of the President of the United States.  So thanks for finally agreeing with me - that its racist.
1307402029636222981 2020-09-20 03:31:48 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills @milesjreed That's only one tiny example of the many, many examples.  When the cult followers at this rallies yell "shoot them!" about the immigrants - he doesn't shut them down.  He should tell them - that is not America!!
1307401604040200192 2020-09-20 03:30:07 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills @milesjreed Oh ok - so I'm racist against my white self.  OK  😂
1307401477133152257 2020-09-20 03:29:37 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills @milesjreed Sadly- he uses language  that accuses black / brown people of bad behavior (look what he did to the immigrants at the border? Trump said they are all criminals, rapists and they are coming to your neighborhood - remember the 'caravans' of criminals?.   That's called race baiting!
1307400991504044040 2020-09-20 03:27:41 +0800 <CRose2u> @Buffalo4Bills @milesjreed No, actually I was eating lunch.

1306405966754316288 2020-09-17 09:33:48 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 It's been said that you just can't make a Maga see the light - we have tried tonight.  I am happy to hear you are not taking the Trump vaccine at his order.  Follow the trained professionals - not a desperate Politican who is eager to be re-elected to escape consequences. 🙏🥺

1306390500639989760 2020-09-17 08:32:21 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 What???  So you distrust the professionals.  But you trust a known Con man - who has had 6 bankruptcies in his own businesses - and who is desperately trying to hold on to power.  With the help of the Trump cult of followers.  Fauci has served 40 years Dems &amp; GOP.  Come on man.
1306389097771130880 2020-09-17 08:26:47 +0800 <CRose2u> @SandiMarie79 @finguys Trump just takes out these professional people to save himself.  He knows if he is not re-elected - the Courts will come calling - and that is what is driving him.  He wants to get re-elected at all costs.
1306388549529415681 2020-09-17 08:24:36 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 😂  Why won't you take Trump's vaccine if you trust him?   I'll tell you why - because he just wants to be re-elected and he doesnt care if you take his vaccine that has not been through all the phases normally required for vaccine effectiveness.  Come on, man!  https://t.co/Ot68NVuaTH
1306388054094098432 2020-09-17 08:22:38 +0800 <CRose2u> @SandiMarie79 @finguys Exactly - this was widely reported.  Trump supporters just defend him based on Fox News talking points.  Even Fox News is backing off now.
1306387885478866946 2020-09-17 08:21:58 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 Sandi is 100% accurate.  Please answer the question - since you believe what Trump is saying - will you take the Trump vaccine on November 1st when he claims it may be available???
1306387601281167360 2020-09-17 08:20:50 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 Question for you - will you take the Trump vaccine - if it is available November 1st? (Oddly, a few days before his re-election bid? )  Come on, man.
1306387299337408512 2020-09-17 08:19:38 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 On February 7th - Trump admitted to Woodward that he KNEW the virus was deadly, airborne and that masks, social distancing and washing hands was the key to control spread.   What did your guy do?  He stood up and said "this is a Democratic hoax" to try to hurt my re-election bid.
1306384545185501185 2020-09-17 08:08:41 +0800 <CRose2u> @SandiMarie79 @finguys Sadly, yes - but Trump supporters look to blame others and not the President.  If this were Obama's handling of a pandemic? Sean Hannity on Fox News would spin right out of his chair and he would be calling for a resignation. They couldn't find anything on Obama - but they tried.
1306383598510108676 2020-09-17 08:04:55 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 Semantics.  That is the only way to defend Trump &amp; Company now - which is sad. Trump is on tape acknowledging this was huge, deadly &amp; easily spread..yet, Trump 'daily briefings' which were like rallies - talking about 'Democratic hoax and the virus will disappear like a miracle'.
1306382444829048832 2020-09-17 08:00:20 +0800 <CRose2u> @finguys @SandiMarie79 Again - you are missing the point.  USA - and the World - is in the middle of a Pandemic which has infected millions of people.  Why would a stable leader - encourage ego rallies (where he lies constantly!) - just to support his own re-election and NOT the health of the attendees

Influx from Europe brought it big time to NYC before anyone was aware (except Trump).  Admit it - no plan and STILL NO PLan.  Holding rallies with people with NO masks?  What kind of leader does that?

If the White House (your guy) had shown NATIONAL Leadership - the Governors could have worked together EARLIER - to share resources more efficiently.  Unfortunately, they had to fight for PPE

1305302243994984454 2020-09-14 08:28:00 +0800 <CRose2u> @Helor145 One secret is that Josh Allen finally has top tier playmakers all around him in the offense. Josh did not have that luxury in his rookie year and he had some last year...but now he has a full complement. That will make any QB's life easier - but he always made plays and competed!
1305301684273524736 2020-09-14 08:25:47 +0800 <CRose2u> @PFF_Sam Serious dude - you can pick on any QB and there will be a throw or play that they missed in a game. Josh Allen has come a long way. Ya'll just pick on him from his rookie season.  Allen is finding his groove &amp; has the type of playmakers around him that top QB's have this year😏💪

1305275465050083330 2020-09-14 06:41:36 +0800 <CRose2u> @REALRICO_BF @BfloFanatics Nah - Josh Allen played a great game - even the Brady / Brees / Rodgers - all overthrow - none are perfect.  Allen is making major strides - he has never had the type of talent around him as he does now.  Even these HOF QB's fade a bit without top playmakers.  Bills on the move..

Baker has had some serious talent and shows good potential - but coaching has a lot to do with QB development imo.
1305273475028918275 2020-09-14 06:33:41 +0800 <CRose2u> @Aaron_says_SKOL In fairness to Josh Allen, he has never had the type of weapons on offense that he has now.....talent around him helps...just like any other star QB.👍

Trump is inciting violence - instead of bringing the Country together.  Much more expected of a President.  Biden will bring people together and find solutions.

Why does Trump say the press is the 'enemy' of the people?  Because they have the ability to investigate him and ask him direct questions. Trump clearly has a lot to hide - so he makes distractions &amp; points fingers at others.
