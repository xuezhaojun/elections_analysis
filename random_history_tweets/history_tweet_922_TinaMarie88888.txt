1343333082271797252 2020-12-28 07:08:59 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @tystiklorius What a horrible selfish person. Let’s name &amp; shame her. Who is she... where does she work? Her employer should know.

1343091144465514496 2020-12-27 15:07:36 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Angry_Staffer I agree. We have only seen my elderly parents outside &amp; distanced. We stopped by their house outside on Xmas to pick up a meal they made for us, since we couldn’t visit inside for Xmas. When my daughter saw the homemade cookies that they usually decorate together, she cried 😭

1339473965308362752 2020-12-17 15:34:14 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @kylegriffin1 But tell me again about Hillary Clinton’s emails. This is horrific but not surprising ... Russia installed trump as POTUS. He is Putin’s puppet. This is part of the deal. Hillary repeatedly warned us.

Her immense strength, resilience, determination, compassion, humility, character, grace &amp; leadership has inspired me since the 90s. She’s taken so many hits from everywhere, yet she stands tall &amp; unwavering. Many stand on her mighty shoulders #respect
1330050428617289729 2020-11-21 15:28:27 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Aprile529 @LMplusG @janelynne @ChrisMurphyCT @GSAEmily Oh darn! I missed that and at this point I really wanted her to be in real trouble. Sounds like there will barely be any consequence for her

1330040000239575047 2020-11-21 14:47:01 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Laurie_Garrett I believed you. I bet you were called “hysterical”

1329730351225298944 2020-11-20 18:16:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @LisaTalmadge As an ally to LGBTQ community, I was touched &amp; thrilled. I knew immediately I was witnessing history. As Lisa points out, something Hillary &amp; Bill Clinton have worked to move forward since the beginning. I was also touched by her love &amp; devotion to her beloved. So beautiful
1329697461837959170 2020-11-20 16:05:54 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @jkingsbury67 @LeciaMichelle11 @LisaTalmadge I like this energy. Fully agree
1329696898354204673 2020-11-20 16:03:39 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @LisaTalmadge Agreed. Plus their states have Republican governors. Like do these people understand anything? Not gonna happen! Not an issue with Pete or Beto. Klobuchar has a Dem Governor.

Plus, this is gross, but there’s also the hotness factor which will suck in a lot of the gop men
1329660334848798721 2020-11-20 13:38:22 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @bradshawmu @davidmweissman @McFaul @seanhannity @RudyGiuliani Yes, she would be as bad in debates as her father, in different ways.

1329631971706892290 2020-11-20 11:45:40 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @IvankaTrump No, this is law and order you talk about. I know since she’s a Black woman you trumps don’t think her vote should even count.
1329630489683103755 2020-11-20 11:39:46 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RonBrownstein Yes many warned about how bad it would be. Many were women and told that they were hysterical
1329628144085704704 2020-11-20 11:30:27 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @misfeldt @kurteichenwald @GOP @FoxNews And wasn’t it announced that she made that call, so literally she did concede election night
1329627730103635969 2020-11-20 11:28:48 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila Such blatant false equivalency. And she called trump election night at 2am to concede. So she did concede that night, just waiting to give the speech until the morning
1329626644798205954 2020-11-20 11:24:30 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryWarnedUs It’s one of the reasons she’s been my hero since the 90s
1329626473452474370 2020-11-20 11:23:49 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @soledadobrien Thank you for saying this. They vetted Hillary like she was already POTUS and didn’t vet trump at all, treating him like entertainment
1329626100880838657 2020-11-20 11:22:20 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @CarolineBanuelo @sarahcpr She called trump at 2am to concede that night. She waited until the next morning to deliver the concession speech

1329619057901973507 2020-11-20 10:54:21 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @rusty_katt @davidmweissman @McFaul @seanhannity @RudyGiuliani I totally agree. She’s not the least bit qualified. It would be a horror show the same as her father’s illegitimate presidency. At first I dismissed this for these reasons. But it’s entirely possible
1329616834740547585 2020-11-20 10:45:31 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @atrupar This is a threat inciting violence on Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton. He should be arrested

1329615770792374273 2020-11-20 10:41:17 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Geechee4Kamala @MadisonKittay @AOC @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @MondaireJones @JamaalBowmanNY @CoriBush They more focused on “demanding” things from Biden than they are on the GOP coup in progress &amp; the GOP attempting to disenfranchise Black voters.

As a WOC, she would have never been able to pull this bullsh*t

Like @Alyssa_Milano mentioned, I’m worried about the other electors, from your state abs the other states. Not only being sued by trump but threatened

Mine is made even worse by having an ex-husband whose household has MAGAs/Covid deniers &amp; he’s trying to get his girls to go with him. They’re old enough to decide but he gaslights &amp; manipulates them.
1328613311181705216 2020-11-17 16:17:52 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @EdTufexis No. It’s only safe to be indoors eating with the people you live with. So none of these gatherings are safe unless you live together

1326856049261993984 2020-11-12 19:55:08 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @matthewjdowd No. White women’s support for trump went up. White men also voted for him. We need to recognize and be grateful for the groups who did the heavy lifting, and that’s Black women. Black women deserve to be respected as the party base. Native Americans also did a lot this year

As we always knew, someone with this temperament is not suited for this office. I remember Hillary saying all this in a debate
1326829993620611073 2020-11-12 18:11:36 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> I’m sick of hearing things about trump that he’s sad or uncomfortable about his crushing loss, or that he’s “on a journey.” THIS IS NOT THE FREAKING BACHELOR. He’s supposed to be a grown man. If he can’t handle this, he should have NEVER ran. #TrumpCollapse #OperationWarpConcede

1326785595549634561 2020-11-12 15:15:11 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @realDonaldTrump You lost. And you lost the popular vote twice. The majority of people NEVER wanted you to be president

She sat across a lunch table (less than 6ft.) for 20 minutes from someone who later tested positive. We (my 2 daughters + me) are getting tested tomorrow hopefully.

Of course this criminal loser won’t ever concede. It’s not necessary. He’ll be forcibly removed from both power &amp; the White House in January

1325705459102347270 2020-11-09 15:43:06 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @notcapnamerica He needs to be arrested, and never allowed to work in law enforcement again

1325631310489071617 2020-11-09 10:48:28 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @kaitlancollins Conceding is a tradition and not legally binding. I’m not the least bit surprised he won’t concede or follow norms. He’s actively inciting violence &amp; the next 2 months are dangerous. He’ll be forcibly removed by law enforcement if needed.
1325625322964914176 2020-11-09 10:24:40 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @GSAEmily Do your job. Your oath is to the USA, not trump. Shameful. I hope you are humiliated &amp; unemployable for the rest of your life
1325615087651086336 2020-11-09 09:44:00 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 Thanks friend, love you 😍
1325604722078846977 2020-11-09 09:02:48 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @notcapnamerica Screw them. I’m so grateful for all the aunties &amp; uncles &amp; Black voters in general. They saved us &amp; I stand with you always. Also are they co-opting BLM? White people need to shut up and FOLLOW Black people’s lead here
1325603686492610560 2020-11-09 08:58:42 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @anthonycwalker Thanks  Canada! We love you 🇨🇦🇺🇸❤️💙
1325580294326525953 2020-11-09 07:25:44 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @kaitlancollins That’s just fine. Conceding is a tradition, yet another norm he’ll break, but it’s not necessary. He’ll be forcibly removed from the WH &amp; power in January
1325579820516962309 2020-11-09 07:23:51 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JJohnsonLaw @riotwomennn Yes

1325579428039172098 2020-11-09 07:22:18 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 @riotwomennn Agreed. I love her! She is loyal to her party, unlike others who seek celebrity as a platform to undermine the party

1324833775524732931 2020-11-07 05:59:20 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> Dancing in the streets as we overthrow trump! I love it!!!

1324629095985106945 2020-11-06 16:26:01 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> Random question while twitter is popping &amp; we are all waiting: is having the pride flag 🏳️‍🌈 in my bio, with me being not LGBTQ appropriation? I added it to show my support, but wondering
1324627967964827648 2020-11-06 16:21:32 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MysterySolvent “I wish I looked like Ivanka so Daddy would want to date me too”
1324627712212934656 2020-11-06 16:20:31 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @GASenateDems If Biden takes the lead, is there a chance it goes back to Trump? Like are there a bunch of military votes to be counted
1324627407727415296 2020-11-06 16:19:19 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DearDean22 @Cajsa Wow. This is moving
1324627024988823552 2020-11-06 16:17:47 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JohnFetterman @mwolfers Gonna go out in my yard and scream!!!
1324625568164388866 2020-11-06 16:12:00 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila It’s delicious. Revenge for his stealing the presidency from the legitimate 2016 winner, Hillary Clinton
1324622725554544640 2020-11-06 16:00:42 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila Me too 😭
1324622637658681345 2020-11-06 16:00:21 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Deoliver47 @PumaSF @McFaul Denise 🔥🔥
1324620394767306752 2020-11-06 15:51:27 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @emrazz This will be the most dangerous time
1324619238875738112 2020-11-06 15:46:51 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @October1859 @Anootchka @DearDean22 And both of them said trump is an illegitimate POTUS
1324618821920051203 2020-11-06 15:45:12 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JoyAnnReid Bearing witness, for Hillary
1324618374484267008 2020-11-06 15:43:25 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JoyAnnReid I was devastated beyond repair on 11-8-16 and I’m seeing this through to the end.
1324617965690593280 2020-11-06 15:41:47 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @McFaul @PumaSF Yes, it is what they want
1324617636567830528 2020-11-06 15:40:29 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> If Hillary Clinton tweets “You’re fired” at trump, that would be the best breaking of the internet. Could be topped only if he goes to jail and she tweets “Lock him up.” #shewon #StillWithHer #Election2020
1324616606564188160 2020-11-06 15:36:23 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @jkfecke Dislike him. Bernie bro 🖕🏻
1324616362866679808 2020-11-06 15:35:25 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @realDonaldTrump And by legal votes you mean WHITE votes. Can’t wait until YOU’RE FIRED
1324615784149209088 2020-11-06 15:33:07 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @McFaul @Anootchka So by his theory - are Houston and Miami “coastal elites”? Or for his Dem-bashing bullshit do only the people in cities in blue states count, like NYC &amp; LA? I do not like him
1324614555817881601 2020-11-06 15:28:14 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @nadabakos I thought GA counting but no updates tonight? I heard PA will update 1-3am
1324612332509605890 2020-11-06 15:19:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @chrislhayes @JoyAnnReid NVM I see that they are live right now
1324611699928911873 2020-11-06 15:16:54 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @chrislhayes @JoyAnnReid Is msnbc staying live all night?

1324610799118274560 2020-11-06 15:13:19 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JoyAnnReid This is great but he has Hatch Act violations going back 4 years. What about all the others?

1324598231712600065 2020-11-06 14:23:22 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DavMicRot @gailyRN Yeah wondering if anything is going to update tonight or if I can sleep
1324596746207584256 2020-11-06 14:17:28 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila So is anything gonna happen tonight?
1324584423006896130 2020-11-06 13:28:30 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @KamVTV There is a deadly global pandemic that is raging uncontrolled in the US because of trump’s failure to act &amp; his lies. Unlike trumpers, we believe scientists &amp; doctors and supported from a distance. Unlike trump, Biden isn’t a narcissist who needs rallies to feed his ego
1324583462213427206 2020-11-06 13:24:41 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RKempNewsDaily @cbs46 What does this mean?
1324582313670463488 2020-11-06 13:20:07 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila Nope. Staying up to bear witness

1324426998878527492 2020-11-06 03:02:57 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Bushido61 @sarahkendzior @AndreaChalupa @gaslitnation The did in 2016. A lot of complexity in it, lots of moving part, so maybe this year we overcame their hacking efforts with votes?
1324417177810817029 2020-11-06 02:23:56 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Ariniko @leahmcelrath And weren’t there a large # of voting machines down in Detroit, and ballots not counted? Like 70K
1324415584843550720 2020-11-06 02:17:36 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JacksonBoazCA @LisaTalmadge Is that where it’s at ?
1324256354949804037 2020-11-05 15:44:53 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @djquinlan @eclecticbrotha Why is the remainder considered good for Biden?
1324253224094846977 2020-11-05 15:32:26 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @melodee99 @LisaTalmadge Art.
1324252901854879746 2020-11-05 15:31:09 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila I just called him a mass murderer but your “acts of genocide” is a better description.
1324252431182680067 2020-11-05 15:29:17 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @ElieNYC So yes we are getting an AZ update tonight?
1324250825812750336 2020-11-05 15:22:54 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AdamParkhomenko When ?? Tonight? To honor Hillary I’m trying to be watching when it’s called.
1324250287310340097 2020-11-05 15:20:46 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AdamParkhomenko Your robotic dog looks so realistic 😂😍
1324249987421741057 2020-11-05 15:19:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @cmclymer @AmoneyResists I’m worried that trump is threatening governors &amp; election officials.
1324249468347310080 2020-11-05 15:17:31 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 I’m watching msnbc and they are still saying trump could take AZ
1324249246430830593 2020-11-05 15:16:38 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AnnAnnChe @WonderKing82 Begging...or threatening? trump would be threatening

1324244316835975168 2020-11-05 14:57:03 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickWilson @AmoneyResists Damn it I can’t go to sleep. Don’t want to miss it. And have to be up early to take my daughter th school 😬🙏🏻
1324241877336526848 2020-11-05 14:47:21 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila I’m very pleased with this one...bye Tulsi! Hoping she doesn’t come back to run for something else
1324241405808648193 2020-11-05 14:45:29 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 What can he threaten them with ?
1324239921020870657 2020-11-05 14:39:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RyanLizza What happens if it’s a tie?
1324239183863549952 2020-11-05 14:36:39 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @rmayemsinger If they even share a bedroom?

1324235729220915201 2020-11-05 14:22:55 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @PeteButtigieg Yes, tonight would have been her re-election.  https://t.co/yf3RRafHpk

1324232192000696321 2020-11-05 14:08:52 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @briantylercohen Yes, Biden has to win for us to even have a chance
1324230513754865664 2020-11-05 14:02:12 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickyDavila Thank you for this accurate summary
1324230390719107072 2020-11-05 14:01:42 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AdamParkhomenko Is it gonna happen? Please for the beloved John Lewis 🙏🏻
1324230111730819074 2020-11-05 14:00:36 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @notcapnamerica Oh no I may have promised to walk through my town naked 😬
1324229553313718272 2020-11-05 13:58:23 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX All that I know are full on Fox brainwashed &amp; one even QAnon. Lots of ignorance, racism, misogyny &amp; perceived victimhood. Another more reasonable one is from a wealthy family, steeped in white male privilege, and wants the tax breaks. Didn’t “like” trump but voted with his greed
1324220638874247170 2020-11-05 13:22:57 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AmoneyResists If trump says anything, it will be to encourage them &amp; incite more violence
1324220270861819906 2020-11-05 13:21:30 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AngrierWHStaff Why do the reporters have to leave, if they want to stay ?

1324205221845880832 2020-11-05 12:21:42 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @hannahfduncann trump supporters plotted to kidnap the Governor of Michigan

1324200366183976960 2020-11-05 12:02:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> I’m feeling this...Brian Williams calling this “a seemingly endless day.” #ElectionDay #postelection

1324198760776433668 2020-11-05 11:56:01 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @BMeiselas Because they are racist. Demographics are changing and we whites will at some point  no longer be the majority. I welcome this

1323720438749581312 2020-11-04 04:15:20 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JonahDispatch @EWErickson Wrong. Majority of people think the RACIST EC needs to go
1323710938491637761 2020-11-04 03:37:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryClinton I voted for Biden but my heart was with you, my forever hero. I love you ❤️
1323702624265342978 2020-11-04 03:04:33 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @BillClinton Love you both!
1323527789459419139 2020-11-03 15:29:49 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @PhilippeReines Praying you’re right. Thank you for being my most famous Twitter follower and even more for helping me get through these 4 years of hell. I’m still heartbroken over 2016 but as my forever hero Hillary would say #onwardtogether
1323521700504489984 2020-11-03 15:05:37 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Oldgringo12 @HillaryClinton Agreed. She has always had this unbelievable strength. She inspires me so much. I’ll never get over it
1323520610492915712 2020-11-03 15:01:18 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AriMelber This should be Hillary’s re-election. Would have been nice if you acknowledged the massive group of Hillary voters these past few years, and that the election was stolen from her
1323520277725253634 2020-11-03 14:59:58 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @KildayMorgan Yeah, me too 😭😭😭
1323520164114108416 2020-11-03 14:59:31 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Oldgringo12 @HillaryClinton Can’t stop crying.
1323519928801087489 2020-11-03 14:58:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TreyAdkins6 Well said. I agree. She is a legend, an inspiring stateswoman, and my hero forever
1323519106885296128 2020-11-03 14:55:19 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX Victoria, your work has made a huge difference to me these last 4 years. Thank you for speaking the truth with the benefit of your years of experience as a journalist. I’m typing this through tears as I think of Election Day 2016
1323518451865079808 2020-11-03 14:52:43 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryPix @HillaryClinton Oh this hurts so much 😭😭😭
1323509537689739265 2020-11-03 14:17:18 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Burkmc Forever heartbroken.
1323458117263364098 2020-11-03 10:52:58 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DanRather I hope you’re around for many more, sir. Thank you for your wisdom &amp; steady strength during these times. Thank you 💙
1323457169719779328 2020-11-03 10:49:12 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Eminem This is excellent. Thank you

1323450559823859712 2020-11-03 10:22:56 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @FancyPants30 @Burkmc Yes it is. So much trauma from 2016. I’d been waiting since 2008 for her to run. My hero 😭
1323446417088794624 2020-11-03 10:06:28 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RKJ65 It was one of the worst night of my life
1323443928759238659 2020-11-03 09:56:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Burkmc It broke me. I’ll never get over it. She’s been my hero since the 90s. I love her. She was robbed. I’ve been crying a lot the last few days
1323443261684461574 2020-11-03 09:53:56 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Lawrence @Cajsa Agree, time for the racist EC to go. Also the suspense is because he cheated in 2016 to steal an election, and illegitimately take office. And he’s obviously trying to do it again
1323347378502574084 2020-11-03 03:32:56 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RBReich The polls were not wrong, I’m sick of this lie. She did win the popular vote within the margin of error that the polls predicted. What it didn’t account for is trump Russia GOP cheating in a few key swing states
1323346761499529229 2020-11-03 03:30:29 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @anyonewantchips And to make it even worse, the four Benghazi deaths weren’t even Hillary‘s fault,l

1323203438742822915 2020-11-02 18:00:58 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX 💯 agree!

1323165088518463489 2020-11-02 15:28:34 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RBReich @PattyArquette voter suppression &amp; disenfranchisement has been a GOP cheating tactic for years, especially against Black people
1323162930972643328 2020-11-02 15:20:00 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @kima_alicia @AdrianCJax Wise advice

1323154555559968768 2020-11-02 14:46:43 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @notcapnamerica This is f!cking art. 😍
1323154221492015113 2020-11-02 14:45:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX I like it. You feeling pretty sure about Iowa &amp; Wisconsin going blue? Would love it
1323140883135475712 2020-11-02 13:52:23 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX Same here. Thank you for the strength &amp; sending it right back to you along with love. Thank you for your work; I’ve been an admirer/follower for a few years.  ❤️
1323136469498798080 2020-11-02 13:34:51 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MsSarahJMarsh I’ll die mad about it

1323121962688909317 2020-11-02 12:37:12 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MaryLTrump @PumaSF Mary, you probably won’t read this, but thank you for your book &amp; being so inspiring by speaking out &amp; persevering. You inspire me with your strength, like another of my heroes, Hillary Clinton.
1323112012856070144 2020-11-02 11:57:40 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @ExportedFromMI Yes, and it was treated as no big deal. trump should have been arrested for this
1323108475589795843 2020-11-02 11:43:37 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @succmeousside @DonnaDiva @JonWalkerDC @mattyglesias @ezraklein Wrong, asshole.  https://t.co/0dkfSrdldg
1323107136214310919 2020-11-02 11:38:18 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @tarabea80 @HillaryClinton I’m having a hard time with it too. The election was stolen from her and I’ll never get over it
1323106922086699008 2020-11-02 11:37:27 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @waltshaub Well that was the only thing she was wrong about then
1322702897394626560 2020-11-01 08:52:00 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DearGoodPeople @Goss30Goss @TexasHwyPatrol They need to all be found and arrested!!!
1322702252738547712 2020-11-01 08:49:26 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @lynnv378 Who is saying this ????

1322456223527149569 2020-10-31 16:31:48 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX Agree. And this comes to mind:  https://t.co/MUVAtg8BOl
1322455557127753728 2020-10-31 16:29:09 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MollyJongFast @HillaryClinton And the fact that trump was also under investigation, but Comey somehow justified breaking rules to only announce about Hillary. Plus they had the laptop for 30 days &amp; didn’t start investigating. Had they done that, they’d have known she was cleared (again) before announcement
1322454358693416961 2020-10-31 16:24:23 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @kdlang @MollyJongFast @HillaryClinton This further cements my decades-long crush on k.d. lang
1322408877833490432 2020-10-31 13:23:40 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @rickhasen Isn’t this yet another violation of the Hatch Act?
1322305675528122370 2020-10-31 06:33:34 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 And it’s one of the many reasons she is my hero
1322302863972904960 2020-10-31 06:22:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @tyrabanks I wish I had the money to burn on this kind of thing. But if I did I would donate the extra  $ to a food bank
1322291908178268160 2020-10-31 05:38:52 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @SunflowerSoul71 @EricHolder Huge credit to Jimmy Carter &amp; John Lewis for saying that trump is illegitimate &amp; Hillary won. Has Maxine Waters also said it?
1322038445208932354 2020-10-30 12:51:42 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @kenolin1 @sarahcpr Ok now I get why Sarah Cooper is such a big deal. Holy shit this is awesome!

1321836059739725824 2020-10-29 23:27:29 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @GabbieKDrice @HillaryClinton The fabulous @MaryLTrump has advised to refer to him as Donald, because he hates that. Also personally I will never call him president because he’s illegitimate

1321661824610275330 2020-10-29 11:55:08 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 With the fire of 1000 suns
1321660351667179520 2020-10-29 11:49:17 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @chrissyteigen @leahmcelrath @HillaryClinton You are both strong and amazing women. I lost a baby &amp; it was very difficult; my husband (now ex) was very unsupportive &amp; refused to even go with me to the doctor—golfing was more important to him. That baby would have been 9 next month.
1321659617965973505 2020-10-29 11:46:22 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryClinton @chrissyteigen Much love to both of you. Chrissy, thank you for sharing - hugs to you
1321643154974662657 2020-10-29 10:40:57 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK His wife was right! Anyone know — why they had the laptop for 30 days prior to the announcement and didn’t start investigating? Had they done that, they would have found there was nothing there and cleared her (again) before any announcement. Seems deliberate
1321602876091867136 2020-10-29 08:00:54 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JacquiVotesBlue He was great!
1321576578279710725 2020-10-29 06:16:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @monaeltahawy And her prior judgeship was stolen from a qualified black woman. Obama nominated Selby in early 2016 &amp; GOP refused to hold a hearing  https://t.co/mGDwAETGex

1321373148504334337 2020-10-28 16:48:03 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AngrierWHStaff Hillary Clinton should be POTUS, but I like her for any position she’d accept.
1321362176184037379 2020-10-28 16:04:27 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @omaha_scanner the trump campaign should be charged for the cost of all of this, not that trump would pay the bill

1321337270486634498 2020-10-28 14:25:29 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @KimKardashian This is obscene. I’m a struggling single mom trying to support my 2 children &amp; keep them safe, while constantly worried about my elderly parents
1321239608156442625 2020-10-28 07:57:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @bryanbehar @leesarhoden Asking Russia to hack Hillary Clinton, a former FLOTUS, SoS, Senator should have been the end.  Calling for the assassination of Hillary Clinton should have been the end. Bragging about his penis size in an RNC debate should have been the end.

All women in politics from the 90s and onward stand on her mighty shoulders. They need to RESPECT HER. One of the reasons I love Harris &amp; Klobuchar. Hillary Clinton is my hero

1321194659704692740 2020-10-28 04:58:48 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AndrewFeinberg Trump called for Hillary Clinton to be assassinated in 2016.

1320854952219201539 2020-10-27 06:28:55 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @KamalaHarris Yes I did! I voted #BidenHarris2020
1320854823567298561 2020-10-27 06:28:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Burkmc Not unpopular here. I was a young adult in the 90s and I see what he accomplished. I love him and Hillary so much

1320852701568258048 2020-10-27 06:19:58 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @world_hillary @HillaryClinton The presidency, and if not that, then a SCOTUS seat or any position in government she would accept

I could see &amp; feel that he wanted to physically attack her. Even though I knew he didn’t, for a moment I felt that fear. I’m a survivor of an abusive marriage

1320418236282798080 2020-10-26 01:33:34 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @lacadri34 Yes 100%. Remember that moment between Feinstein &amp; maybe Schumer where they got a briefing right after the election &amp; they were visibly shaken?
1320417590628524034 2020-10-26 01:31:00 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @dianejeffersonc Oh this is adorable! 😭😭😭
1320416689062895616 2020-10-26 01:27:25 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX Thank you for this insight! The ongoing gaslighting about her is especially painful
1320160789102198784 2020-10-25 08:30:34 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @KristenClarkeJD @wyntermitchell I love this band &amp; dancers! Such talent &amp; energy 👏🏻🇺🇸
1320147107844599808 2020-10-25 07:36:12 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TheRickWilson What’s the news?
1319888175477723136 2020-10-24 14:27:18 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @NateSilver538 @Cajsa It’s not alarmist, it’s being a realist. I’m wondering if someone you cared about had a severe case or died from Covid — Would that cause you to be more “alarmist”?
1319777471479357445 2020-10-24 07:07:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MeidasTouch I was honored to accompany my daughter to vote, who is turning 18 &amp; voted for the first time!  We voted for Biden/Harris #especiallyfemale #vote #TrumpCrimeFamily
1319748129726599171 2020-10-24 05:10:48 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @QueenMab87 They think it means they are victims &amp; being denied their rights. What’s really happening is that the white male patriarchy is being challenged, and they, steeped in their white male fragility/toxicity are uncomfortable with that. Equality for others makes them feel oppressed

1319468236757413891 2020-10-23 10:38:36 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryClinton Voted for Biden. But my heart is with you, my hero Hillary. Love you 💙
1319464736371724290 2020-10-23 10:24:42 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @sciencecatlady Yup — I’ve been reliving my trauma that I survived, since this asshole started his first campaign

1319458049401171968 2020-10-23 09:58:07 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @lynnv378 Why is she allowing trump to go on and on
1319457839975378949 2020-10-23 09:57:18 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> MUTE HIM! Why is he allowed to go on and on. trump is a bully   #Debates2020
1319455657620373504 2020-10-23 09:48:37 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> Is the moderator even using the mute button? Also if she’s using it I wish a blow horn would go off each time #PresidentialDebate2020 #DebateTonight

1319444324224991233 2020-10-23 09:03:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @AngrierWHStaff It was clearly bullshit in 2016 too
1319443399892750336 2020-10-23 08:59:55 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @GregHale1 @jaketapper @HillaryClinton I’m so SO sick of the revisionist history &amp; trashing of Hillary Clinton by so many of these pundits &amp; news people @CNN @MSNBC
1319439734507261953 2020-10-23 08:45:21 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DaxGigandet Here’s the Domestic Violence hotline#
1319439218402336768 2020-10-23 08:43:18 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @lynnv378 The part that bugged me was that she said she thinks trump will have a “strong performance”
1319427710758903810 2020-10-23 07:57:34 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @briantylercohen @joncoopertweets @PeteButtigieg He’s fantastic
1319422089737154560 2020-10-23 07:35:14 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @cam_joseph @VICENews This is partisan and racist voter suppression that’s enabled by the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. GOP knows they are a minority among voters and can win ONLY by cheating like this
1319412874100527106 2020-10-23 06:58:37 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @realDonaldTrump Suburban woman here who sees your RACIST dog whistles. You are a racist, misogynist illegitimate POTUS
1319411006003621888 2020-10-23 06:51:11 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @nytimes This is some peak both-sides BS
1319316191899488257 2020-10-23 00:34:26 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @garci32 My Mom &amp; I were talking about this last night! I think he will yell and rage while he’s muted
1319301616097501189 2020-10-22 23:36:31 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TeaPainUSA @lmadmamta Every one of trumps adult children &amp; his son-in-law should be brutally mocked for their corruption
1319297076501581824 2020-10-22 23:18:29 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RepDougCollins If the president behaved like an adult instead of a raging maniac, this wouldn’t be necessary. It would only be unfair if one candidate was muted while the other wasn’t. You corrupt GOP have such a victim complex
1319283802787573760 2020-10-22 22:25:44 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @joncoopertweets trump knew he had it at the last debate, and I believe he wanted to infect Biden. There should be nothing less than a verified negative test, done by an independent doctor and a doctor of Biden’s choosing
1319262466266832897 2020-10-22 21:00:57 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryWarnedUs Same here, mostly insomnia. Rough times, and the PTSD from 2016 doesn’t help

1319162459391987712 2020-10-22 14:23:33 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @FrTomPringle So if you believe that then don’t personally marry a man. Your bigoted religious beliefs do not give you the right to impose your beliefs on others
1319096714754723842 2020-10-22 10:02:19 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @davidmweissman I’ll never forget your apology to Hillary Clinton.

1318854048985059335 2020-10-21 17:58:03 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryWarnedUs Same

1318752971631583232 2020-10-21 11:16:24 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @davidmweissman Thanks for asking. Super anxious
1318737222288498688 2020-10-21 10:13:49 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MiamiPD Nothing short of his being fired, then arrested &amp; charged with a crime is acceptable.
1318733890341752832 2020-10-21 10:00:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @realDonaldTrump So Lesley Stahl is an epidemiologist now? I missed that
1318732998687268864 2020-10-21 09:57:02 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @SandWriter @Georgia70190490 @CoreyCiorciari @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump I think they did. The states mentioned here plus also Florida. Her early vote lead in Florida was statistically impossible for trump to overcome
1318678386072604672 2020-10-21 06:20:01 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @msleen1970 Excellent point! And I think no, sadly. Misogyny is powerful
1318676142665179136 2020-10-21 06:11:06 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @blackwomenviews @notcapnamerica Agreed! It is racist and partisan gorier suppression by the GOP. A good start would be the restoring of the Voting Rights Act, which was gutted by the Supreme Court. 2016 was the first presidential election since it was gutted
1318675716708438021 2020-10-21 06:09:25 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @BillClinton @KamalaHarris Love to you Mr. President!
1318648207635845122 2020-10-21 04:20:06 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryClinton I love you both!
1318468149076021250 2020-10-20 16:24:37 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DanRather You are a national treasure, sir.

1318379681419321345 2020-10-20 10:33:05 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Kalarigamerchic Sending you hugs.

1318362722069848066 2020-10-20 09:25:41 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Burkmc @rudesttooter One of my worst days ever, and I’ve been through some stuff. I totally understand not being able to watch it. I forced myself to watch it, sobbing, to stand witness to her courage, her win, and her stolen presidency. And to stand in place for those who couldn’t watch it. Hugs
1318361095485128705 2020-10-20 09:19:13 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @kenolin1 Holy crap this is ART! Brava 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

1318359176209465345 2020-10-20 09:11:36 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @SunflowerSoul71 Incredibly painful.
1318358108889108480 2020-10-20 09:07:21 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @TonyShnark 50-something Mom, have had 2 cesarean births, and hell yes I would, if i can wear shoes? Also I’m single so who knows could get me a boyfriend 😂
1318353711375273985 2020-10-20 08:49:53 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @RBReich Yes since election night 2016
1318310617456009217 2020-10-20 05:58:38 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Burkmc And I already voted for Biden and straight Dem down ballot! 🗳
1318309725809893377 2020-10-20 05:55:06 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Burkmc I like this.
1318309481248399361 2020-10-20 05:54:07 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @PeteButtigieg Already voted, early &amp; safely in person. Voted Biden / Harris &amp; straight Dem down ballot. Thank you for the great work you’re doing on Fox “News.” Also, I have a bit of a crush on your husband. Love to you both
1318011591766532096 2020-10-19 10:10:25 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DonaldJTrumpJr None of you will ever get over the fact that your father is an illegitimate POTUS, &amp; was installed by Russia &amp; GOP cheating. Thus your fixation on the real winner, Hillary Clinton
1318009743210958848 2020-10-19 10:03:04 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @hakeem_jeffries Yes, and he was also involved with the cheating in 2016 to install illegitimate Trump
1317998692700475393 2020-10-19 09:19:10 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @leahmcelrath I’m with you. 2016 broke me. I have had varying moments during this election of being unable to cope with it
1317679231304949760 2020-10-18 12:09:44 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @KarenLJ71 I’m sorry for the racists. I see you, I hear you, and I’m with you. I’m disgusted by white people who are racist (white woman here)
1317660003667423232 2020-10-18 10:53:20 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @DSmokter @thehill Agreed. But he also crossed the line in 2016 when he called for Hillary Clinton to be assisinated, and repeatedly called for her to be “locked up.”
1317655300971896834 2020-10-18 10:34:39 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @lacadri34 I totally agree. And I think many in government also know the truth. He is illegitimate &amp; stole the office via GOP cheating &amp; Russia. President Carter &amp; the late John Lewis are the two who have stated it publicly so far
1317650832779771904 2020-10-18 10:16:53 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @darylsturgis Thank you Daryl! You are so right

1315920155948593152 2020-10-13 15:39:48 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @notcapnamerica This is racist voter suppression by the GOP. We need to reinstate the Voting Rights Act, which was gutted by the GOP for exactly this right here .... suppressing Dem voters

1315041937792081921 2020-10-11 05:30:04 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> I cried as I voted because my heart is with Hillary Clinton, my hero.
1315041410958143488 2020-10-11 05:27:59 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> This week I voted early for #BidenHarris2020 and straight Dem down ballot. My daughter voted for the first time &amp; while Biden wasn’t her preferred candidate, I’m so proud of her for voting Biden, to save democracy. #VOTE #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica #HillaryWarnedUs #TrumpCrimeFamily
1315013293782728709 2020-10-11 03:36:15 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @tlitman I’ll cry because my heart is with Hillary, and her stolen presidency. I’ll cry tears of releif that trump lost. I’ll cry tears of joy for VP Harris’ achievement. And then I’ll prepare for the scariest &amp; most dangerous time period between then &amp; inauguration.

1311248212934656005 2020-09-30 18:15:10 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @SheriffReese Thank you!

I made a personal decision to force myself tonight to watch &amp; bear witness in Hillary Clinton’s honor, because trump was abusive to her too - even physically threatening her
1311233924883009536 2020-09-30 17:18:23 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @JESSICALMERR @VABVOX Lauren, I know this also. I’m still awake for the same reason. You’re not alone
1311232700175577088 2020-09-30 17:13:31 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @VABVOX I agree. I’m a survivor of an abusive marriage &amp; tonight was very difficult for me to watch and I’m still shook up. I watched because my Mom was watching &amp; we were texting each other. Like Kamala said so brilliantly &amp; accurately: “I know a predator when I see one.”
1311165908686123009 2020-09-30 12:48:07 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Chasten @HillaryClinton Now I automatically love you, Chasten 😍

I watched because my Mom was watching &amp; texting with me. I loved that @NicolleDWallace called him an abuser on MSNBC after the debate. Her analysis was spot on
1311137584341450752 2020-09-30 10:55:34 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryClinton Your strength &amp; resilience are just some of the reasons you are my hero. Your example has helped me through some rough times. I love you ❤️

1310790631405613056 2020-09-29 11:56:54 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Ange_Amene @Burkmc WW here. You are correct
1310790208636489728 2020-09-29 11:55:13 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Burkmc No lies detected
1310711068130504704 2020-09-29 06:40:45 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> It’s a good time to remember the fact that in 2016 Hillary Clinton released over 30 years of her full tax returns, going back to the 1970s. #brokeasstrump #TrumpCrimeFamily #TaxFraudTrump #DonTheCon #TrumpTaxCheat #TrumpIsNotABillionaire #HillaryWasRight
1310616364495839236 2020-09-29 00:24:26 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @abigaildisney Outstanding tweet!! Also she smiled too much while at the same time not smiling enough. And yes the epic pantsuits....if she had worn skirts instead that also would have been an issue. #misogyny #whitemalepatricarchy #toxicmasculinity #mediaFAIL

1309131181431164928 2020-09-24 22:02:50 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @OliviaTroye @joncoopertweets The moment happened in 2016 when he stole the ejection via Russia &amp; GOP cheating and nothing was done about it.
1309075790794051585 2020-09-24 18:22:44 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @SethAbramson The coup started in 2016
1309023786495336450 2020-09-24 14:56:05 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump You enabled this Andrea with your vetting Hillary like she was already POTUS while treating trump like entertainment. This is not at all surprising coming from trump &amp; HILLARY WARNED US
1309022542028582918 2020-09-24 14:51:09 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @ViragoX Agree
1308918593212555265 2020-09-24 07:58:05 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @BillClinton Thank you, both you and Hillary, for this hero Madame Justice Ginsburg
1308917209218142208 2020-09-24 07:52:35 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @Aubs89 @volunteermom113 Yup
1308578849777741825 2020-09-23 09:28:04 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @mdnij34 Yes, he thinks he will steal ANOTHER election via Russia &amp; cheating, like in 2016.
1308331405349355520 2020-09-22 17:04:49 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryClinton Voting early and in person. Taking my teenage daughter along who is voting for the first time
1308318410854543361 2020-09-22 16:13:11 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @riotwomennn @HardballChris Yeah, I won’t forget that one. That’s was a threat to assault (joke my ass) a POTUS nominee, former SoS, former US Senator &amp; former FLOTUS.
1307975581573808128 2020-09-21 17:30:54 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryWarnedUs Agreed. Both Gorsuch &amp; Kavanaugh are illegitimate
1307632316039286785 2020-09-20 18:46:53 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @jaketapper @ShannonDingle @AliVelshi Many journalists have normalized him. He literally called for Hillary Clinton to be assassinated in 2016, and it was barely a blip in the media
1307173256563130369 2020-09-19 12:22:45 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @esglaude Misogynist &amp; 4 years late a$$hole
1307172912290504706 2020-09-19 12:21:23 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @esglaude This was true in 2016 and you chose trump so fvck you
1307167694312083456 2020-09-19 12:00:38 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @BillClinton Thank you, Mr. President, for putting this courageous trailblazing brilliant woman on the Supreme Court.
1307166204864458752 2020-09-19 11:54:43 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MaddowBlog That was outstanding. Thank you for having her on during this tragic &amp; frightening time
1307110111668830208 2020-09-19 08:11:50 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> I will never forgive anyone who didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton.
1307109466102468610 2020-09-19 08:09:16 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 @SpryGuy I agree with every word. I’m devastated

1307103018035425283 2020-09-19 07:43:38 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @NYAnna22 Me too
1306491776740593665 2020-09-17 15:14:47 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @NoteFromSELF @PhilippeReines Michael I agree Phillippe is special &amp; I was shocked &amp; thrilled when he followed me 😍
1306449494519820288 2020-09-17 12:26:46 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @NicolasEdny What did I miss? I’m not mad at her - I love her. But let me guess at why people are mad at her: how dare she be a woman &amp; black &amp; brilliant &amp; competent and seek power.
1306448520631771136 2020-09-17 12:22:54 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @WonderKing82 Never! I’ll die mad about it
1306447617417785344 2020-09-17 12:19:19 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @joanwalsh With you here
1306447242761515008 2020-09-17 12:17:49 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @davidmweissman Hi, thanks for asking. I’m having a pretty bad day with an anxiety flare up. Because of everything happening with pandemic &amp; politics &amp; also a daughter suffering from depression
1306446476151853059 2020-09-17 12:14:47 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @leahmcelrath I am a survivor of this, married for 16 years. I suffer from anxiety &amp; other things. I was devastated on election night not only because of my love of Hillary, but also because, like Kamala Harris so beautifully said: “I know a predator when I see one.”
1302885099827073026 2020-09-07 16:23:08 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @HillaryWarnedUs Hi Steve! Thank you for this account, you’re one of my favorites! Totally jealous of your picture with Hillary.
1301483276025114629 2020-09-03 19:32:48 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @girlsreallyrule We are but it started in 2016
1301377429240508416 2020-09-03 12:32:12 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @MfromPa Agree!
1300689832243597312 2020-09-01 14:59:56 +0800 <TinaMarie88888> @notcapnamerica Racist a$$hole. Suburban white lady here and Cory Booker is totally welcome! 😍
