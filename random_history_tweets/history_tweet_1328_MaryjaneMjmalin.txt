1342130366312833024 2020-12-24 23:29:49 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JoyceCarolOates Cruelty IS the point of the dump admin, our prison system, our Unjustice system, the right wing gop so called conservatives. Racism and cruelty lead their decisions and actions.
1342122503938985984 2020-12-24 22:58:35 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @USATODAY There is no other way to judge him. He is a loser and a criminal.

1336148543518740480 2020-12-08 11:20:11 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @GotJanie I would say so.
1336147906353635328 2020-12-08 11:17:39 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @taradublinrocks Big brave kops. Bet death santis told them to be none to easy on them.
1336143210708611072 2020-12-08 10:59:00 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @darinnstacy Bukkket heads for trump.

1336002079832281088 2020-12-08 01:38:12 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @TRAPTOFFICIAL @travisakers But it is. It's the law. Plus it's disgusting to touch any child that way. It's a sickness.
1335989125917315073 2020-12-08 00:46:43 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @tucsonrosie2001 @Twitter @TwitterMoments @TwitterSupport @jack I bet these q idgits had no problem with the dump admin snatching children from the arms of their parents, caging them until they were shipped out all over this country.
1335987150119182337 2020-12-08 00:38:52 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @CarolynGarman5 @DrEricDing wouldn't bet on it.
1335986975145418761 2020-12-08 00:38:10 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @AntLeonard73 @ACLU They should be treated fairly and equitably, like all people, especially kids.

1335984842413060096 2020-12-08 00:29:42 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @nypapajoe I thought Rev Warnock was way too nice. He's a true gentleman having put up with that bs.
1335983395516641287 2020-12-08 00:23:57 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @maggieNYT He can ignore his duties and watch more and more americans die of covid just as well from floriduh. Meanwhile, a fumigation team needs to do their thing in the WH.

1335977052344885249 2020-12-07 23:58:45 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ACLU This kind of treatment against these kids is how so many of them end up running away and living on the streets.
1335976743820201994 2020-12-07 23:57:31 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @CaslonRichard He looks some kind of uglyass alien who's trying to learn how to laugh. By all means sheeple,  give this "man" your hard earned $$.
1335975801758621702 2020-12-07 23:53:47 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @FOXNashville In the old days we, USA, had a president that would say some patriotic words on this day.

1335966298229051392 2020-12-07 23:16:01 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @McGeezer67 @KathyNature Kinda like "the Terror" they had back in France a couple of centuries ago. Only instead of the guillotine it's covid.

1334989000302620677 2020-12-05 06:32:35 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BobRook8 I think President Joe should have a brand spanking new chair of his own.
1334987880343744512 2020-12-05 06:28:08 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @brhodes So this is as bad and dangerous as it sounds.

1334641363074371584 2020-12-04 07:31:12 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @AshleyFerraz4 Maybe it's her stage name.
1334641165971419140 2020-12-04 07:30:25 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Roshan_Rinaldi That's more than he deserves.
1334640966129643520 2020-12-04 07:29:37 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @DavidBLong4 lemme guess. you're against diversity.

1334639691057033216 2020-12-04 07:24:33 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JuliusGoat Yeah but you don't Call it that, for it to be accepted by gop congress and the average US people. Those 3 little words .. They can't get past them.
1334638799238914049 2020-12-04 07:21:00 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @astroff_bonita @LuciaRendn4 Yeah, Her!

1334583101708783617 2020-12-04 03:39:41 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @IlhanMN @comeundone0 People are putting rent on a credit card. Do you know how disastrous that will be??  Average rent is at 1000$$ a month at least. It will ruin people. But at least they'll have a roof over their heads.
1334582244451770370 2020-12-04 03:36:17 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @AsTheEagleFlies I have no doubt it is Not legal. I do not think it will fly.

1334512404248600581 2020-12-03 22:58:45 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @SystemicChang3 @JuliusGoat I know . The plan is great and would work wonders. But if you scare off the people d/t wording, it won't get funded or supported.
1334511366728785925 2020-12-03 22:54:38 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Straticus2 @acnewsitics Common sense done flew the coop.

1334506468008222722 2020-12-03 22:35:10 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @LuciaRendn4 She relishes her 15 seconds of fame. Turn up the obnoxiousness.  Done!
1334505201483587584 2020-12-03 22:30:08 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Straticus2 @acnewsitics Common sense should rule on this one.
1334504944855097345 2020-12-03 22:29:07 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @acnewsitics OR Hillary Clinton!
1334504555443343364 2020-12-03 22:27:34 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @mhdksafa Done. Taking care of our fellow americans is all on US now.
1334493065986367489 2020-12-03 21:41:55 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JurisDudence @JuliusGoat If only it was that simple. They have to explain what the actual plan is. The actual plan makes sense. Freaking people out does not help at all.
1334491998783418368 2020-12-03 21:37:40 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @LinkedHD Flynn thinks he's back in moscow.
1334491106080387072 2020-12-03 21:34:07 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @mhdksafa That's how the filthy rich stay filthy rich. That's why they're called filthy.
1334489037827149825 2020-12-03 21:25:54 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @shillman1 @UROCKlive1 So true. They are used to outbreaks and have been wearing masks for years. I'll even bet they have a full supply of ppe.
1334488278066745344 2020-12-03 21:22:53 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @lkloveday I always thought the intell folk should give him some juicy false information and see where it ends up.
1334487936717496322 2020-12-03 21:21:32 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @titodinzey @realTuckFrumper But as the flock dies of covid, their goes their tithing. Very short sighted of them.
1334487235480186881 2020-12-03 21:18:45 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @HollyMichelleG1 That mustache is made of implanted toothbrush bristles and it will Not be shaved. You'd have to get a hand sander.
1334486155576872962 2020-12-03 21:14:27 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @levparnas @joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiuliani Great exit line for dump to leave on.
1334485701145071624 2020-12-03 21:12:39 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JuliusGoat Defund the police is a ridiculous phrase b/c it's not what they want to do. Reallocate funding is the proposal to have  professionals that can help with the cases that cops  cannot handle with any humanity.
1334484645765898240 2020-12-03 21:08:27 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @GMA @GioBenitez Y'all go on. Imma stay right here.
1334484480812314624 2020-12-03 21:07:48 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @RepKatiePorter @mfrost11 @stevenmnuchin1 The king of foreclosures is going out with the rest of the trump trash. Soon, very soon. But UNfortunately, not soon enough for millions of our fellow americans.
1334483294113697793 2020-12-03 21:03:05 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BlkGirlTragic @shift_in2_turbo Was it random or a deranged boyfriend? Tragic. Bet she was a Mom.
1334482321374814210 2020-12-03 20:59:13 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @donwinslow @CalameDiana I've lost track. Is roger dodger in or out of jail? Is he going or has he been "pardoned"?
1334481935691878401 2020-12-03 20:57:41 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @realTuckFrumper @titodinzey Why would all these preachers not want to protect their own flock? Isn't that their job?
1334481532824772609 2020-12-03 20:56:05 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @trumpharmsusall Trumpsters refuse to believe what is right in front of their faces.
1334481016514285570 2020-12-03 20:54:02 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @jfinn6511 Interesting, non conforming trailblazing people are always targeted by people who refuse to understand or care.
1334479986233909248 2020-12-03 20:49:56 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @lkloveday He'd sell his princess if the price was right.

1334477834203623429 2020-12-03 20:41:23 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @B52Malmet They really should have thrown the net over him and dragged him back to his room. Then Immediately started the the 25th amendment ball rolling.
1334476630903951360 2020-12-03 20:36:36 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @shillman1 It's taking our best people. Our most important people. Parents, grandparents, leaving behind orphans, broken families and hearts.
1334476103008841728 2020-12-03 20:34:30 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JewelsJourneys @lacadri34 Ok contractor dude, that's Not funny!!
1334475469220089856 2020-12-03 20:31:59 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @MSNBC Since it's being called a lawsuit, wouldn't that mean there is no pardon for that?
1334475127069794304 2020-12-03 20:30:38 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @CBSNews This lawsuit sounds like it's for the same kind of thievery the dumps pull in their business dealings.Over stating the value of their junk when it suits them, then going opposite for, say, Tax purposes.
1334473801401307138 2020-12-03 20:25:22 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @shillman1 @UROCKlive1 Leadership, that's the key.
1334471949309898752 2020-12-03 20:18:00 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @MariePerlman Unbelievably tragic..while dump fiddles..
1334471702944813056 2020-12-03 20:17:01 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @NotHoodlum @fmurphytervalon it would be a pee test stat.

1334209223153082369 2020-12-03 02:54:01 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @american2084 My thought is you are correct. defund police is a terrible slogan and does no good. Gops are so shallow so you have to be careful.
1334208015638126594 2020-12-03 02:49:13 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @GorditosGatitos @tigergrrldc Cute/cray..tomato/tomato..
1334177670033182722 2020-12-03 00:48:39 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @atrupar So now gops are going back to their fake outrage over everything the dems want to do.

1334173049420214275 2020-12-03 00:30:17 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @bsaks1 @CoriBush Now She certainly has enough $$$$ to capture dump's attention for a pardon.
1334172489446985730 2020-12-03 00:28:03 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @WileELiberal Very! so terribly young.

1334167510892097539 2020-12-03 00:08:16 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Fritschner He had his chance to leave out of office on a high note, ie: The Impeachment. But Noooooo. Useless EXsenator.
1334153195300548609 2020-12-02 23:11:23 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @RoArquette @Persiflage77 and burps.
1334153096986054658 2020-12-02 23:11:00 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Nathan_Brinlee @realDonaldTrump Dump will continue to tweet but I bet faux cuts him off. It will be a tapering off, so as not to create too much heads exploding.
1334152418595102721 2020-12-02 23:08:18 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @LinkedHD @PaineSister He'll get a pardon for that too.

1322160871955718145 2020-10-30 20:58:11 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @workclassjane @tribelaw It is bs but it happens, always in favor of a gop candidate. The E C needs to be abolished. And term limits for scotus.
1322156321408536576 2020-10-30 20:40:06 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @tribelaw @workclassjane I really don't think this election is going to the S C. If it does, do you think a scotus would do his bidding? Well maybe boof and the one with zero answers, but the others?

1322150452272734209 2020-10-30 20:16:46 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Ziggiezaggie It's spreading exponentially. If Everybody would wear a mask when out and about it would not spread like a California wildfire.
1322007385515458566 2020-10-30 10:48:17 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @mmpadellan @mikerico77 Agree. But is going door to door to beg for candy ever really a safe thing for children?

1321982406832934913 2020-10-30 09:09:01 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Chopcho26777411 @ajplus Kid should have stayed in utero. Have more rights there than once you get birthed.
1321978514095153159 2020-10-30 08:53:33 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @shereenskee Was that Helen Mirren as B B???

1319833120716316672 2020-10-24 10:48:31 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @RobertW81555222 I hate to hear this. I am so sorry for this loss.
1319832609153757185 2020-10-24 10:46:29 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @LA_Karma1 @GOP That sounds surprisingly like Randy Rainbow.
1319831388942630914 2020-10-24 10:41:39 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @GOP He can't even build a fkkkn wall. Except around the WH of course. You traitors are toast!

1319822667529310209 2020-10-24 10:06:59 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ThePubliusUSA @JoeBiden My voting day, last week, was one of the best days I've had in a long time.
1319822297847529473 2020-10-24 10:05:31 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @DrBiden @comeundone0 It certainly is. Tramp is devoid of compassion and empathy.
1319821460026937346 2020-10-24 10:02:11 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @janeknowsshit Ikr. I wish they would stop with the polls already.

1319769157081223168 2020-10-24 06:34:21 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @notcapnamerica Eww it's a buffet..with food troughs. Danger Danger !
1319766845172404224 2020-10-24 06:25:10 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @corvid317 @tamlisadem that's the least of our worries.
1319764922482511872 2020-10-24 06:17:32 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @RealDonalDrumpf @88SEATTLE61 Well he's the one who called himself the Grim reaper. Reaping what he sowed I'd say. Or blood thinners..either way he's skkkum.
1319762475613605888 2020-10-24 06:07:48 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @MelissaWrites22 @AshleyFerraz4 He also got buggy when Biden said that what trump admin has done to children at the border was a Crime. Bigly facial twitch to that word "Criminal".
1319442534544834561 2020-10-23 08:56:28 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @SwiftWriter @co_rapunzel4 They're a fickle lot.
1319442115773009921 2020-10-23 08:54:49 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @SwiftWriter @co_rapunzel4 I've seen bumper stickers claiming to be proud of being a redneck.

1319437418332901376 2020-10-23 08:36:09 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @atrupar @MrWednesday11 I'd love to see him in the Biden Admin as head of one of the intell agencies.
1319434504566616066 2020-10-23 08:24:34 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @WhiteHouse All our allies are offended, appalled and disgusted by him. Same as me. And lots of others too.
1319433620835213313 2020-10-23 08:21:03 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ImmaBlueDot @jack HERE HERE!!! Hate it. It's Almost as bad as facebook.
1319433214226763776 2020-10-23 08:19:26 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @corvid317 And why do they start them so late? Some people have to get up early.
1319421069153939456 2020-10-23 07:31:11 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BorisTrump6 Do you pay taxes from prison?
1319420084809596934 2020-10-23 07:27:16 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Roshan_Rinaldi What an askhole.
1319419497669799936 2020-10-23 07:24:56 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Gloria4Educ @milliemadden 4 years. That is correct.
1319418997100732416 2020-10-23 07:22:57 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BorisTrump6 Nothing unusual him not smiling.
1319417406847156226 2020-10-23 07:16:38 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @MysterySolvent He'll be totally obnoxious in all he says and does.
1319415616663658498 2020-10-23 07:09:31 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ModProps Dude's lookin kinda ruff..
1319413410933755909 2020-10-23 07:00:45 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @TG22110 Twump only tries to protect himself. He gives not a damn for anyone else.
1319413021500989441 2020-10-23 06:59:12 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @nypapajoe Osoff looks like straight out of a 40"s movie detective mystery. Wish I could vote for him.
1319397058248364034 2020-10-23 05:55:46 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @MysterySolvent He could start, reluctantly, to bring up jr and erkk, who are not allowed to have their hands on a charity. Or ivankkky's trade marks in China. Or perhaps the problems surrounding jared. Could go on and on. Like them killing endangered animals for fun.
1319391691162456064 2020-10-23 05:34:26 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BorisTrump6 @ItisZeusIamback "Go gettem trump"

1319390091081666561 2020-10-23 05:28:05 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BorisTrump6 How much $$$ is he costing US going to his hate rallies night after night, with all his security and excesses he insists on.

1319388659435687937 2020-10-23 05:22:24 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @shereenskee You gotta catch up.. hope I make it...
1319383848266977287 2020-10-23 05:03:17 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BreeNewsome I think it's more of putting on a cop uniform brings out the brutality in some people that are now allowed to let their rage flow. It's mostly a violent men thing.
1319381994497839107 2020-10-23 04:55:55 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @latimes If he starts being shitty to Kristen I don't know if I can stand it.
1319381280514052113 2020-10-23 04:53:04 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @corvid317 Ok add it to the list of fixes.
1319380804108230656 2020-10-23 04:51:11 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JimRaginia She sure did!! We are NOT having this Sh t Anymore!! 11 days people!!

1319275455275360259 2020-10-22 21:52:34 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Roshan_Rinaldi That's some heavy wish list thinking man. moooo
1319274372020891648 2020-10-22 21:48:15 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @GovAbbott @ALEC_states ALEC- that helps write the repuke play book. DIShonorable at best.
1319273163688189952 2020-10-22 21:43:27 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @marthaevapearl @TexasTribune @VonAkers Good point. I'm sure they're counting on her ruling that discrimination is ok as long as it's against who she is against.
1319272527034658819 2020-10-22 21:40:56 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @TexDem16 @TexasTribune It's their only hope.
1319270638805200896 2020-10-22 21:33:25 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @GrandMoffJoseph @TexasTribune Good point!
1319270531233910784 2020-10-22 21:33:00 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @WCmeshfighter @TexasTribune I have a daughter who is a social worker and would NEVER EVER discriminate against ANY one that needs her help. She has sat in a house shaking her feet to keep the roaches off. She would NEVER discriminate.
1319269483765268480 2020-10-22 21:28:50 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ajplus Who the hell does he think he's appealing to?? Not social workers that's for sure. How abhorrent and cruel he is.
1319269026942586887 2020-10-22 21:27:01 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @bobert_bon @ajplus Boy howdie you do!

1319266719744000001 2020-10-22 21:17:51 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @KCuzAdams @ousseynou_tall @ajplus @GovAbbott Of course you are!! Doing the right thing these days goes against the grain of the repuuke play book.
1319266214829502465 2020-10-22 21:15:51 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @lonnettekelly @ajplus Exactly!!
1319266117026779143 2020-10-22 21:15:27 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BernieToVest @ajplus WTF is WRONG with this guy??
1319265666525003778 2020-10-22 21:13:40 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ajplus What kind of social worker would turn away anyone that needed their help d/t lgbtq or Anything else??
1319265165725093889 2020-10-22 21:11:40 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @TexasTribune Texas- Man what is WRONG with your sorry ass governor??? Is he not in a w/c himself?? What if he was turned away from getting help b/c he's such a dipsh t??
1319263872726016003 2020-10-22 21:06:32 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @jzikah @guardian The statement at the bottom. Corruption starts with Yes men. So damn true. Trump would not be trump w/o years and years of yes men and women.
1319071613103517697 2020-10-22 08:22:34 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @colbertlateshow @DollyParton Did she write that?
1319034128336027648 2020-10-22 05:53:37 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Roshan_Rinaldi EXACTLY!! That's what I said!!! And they never mention them. Trump spawns can't even be involved in a charity d/t their skimming $$$.
1319033567972888576 2020-10-22 05:51:23 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BayouGal50 Well all those.

1318947855462240256 2020-10-22 00:10:48 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @deb1956m @MysterySolvent My first thought.
1318947337448902658 2020-10-22 00:08:44 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @django22 Yeah but in Russian.
1318947063678312448 2020-10-22 00:07:39 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @DaleGeldart @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Why do they never mention the criminal behavior of the trump offspring?
1318933494194647040 2020-10-21 23:13:44 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @AngrierWHStaff @DaleGeldart Wear a damn mask and stay away from people.
1318933290187894794 2020-10-21 23:12:55 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Iacoguy I think the perfect term for dump is dereliction of duty. Biggest derelict ever to darken the doors of Our WH.
1318930456595804160 2020-10-21 23:01:40 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @mdnij34 @WilliamPine2 I will suffer thru it.
1318929925118754817 2020-10-21 22:59:33 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Markontheradio2 And what's with the new retweet? Me no likey.
1318929141501222912 2020-10-21 22:56:26 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @nypapajoe I don't know what any of this is but Yay! Whatever brings young people together in a safe happy way.
1318927987555917825 2020-10-21 22:51:51 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @dimplasm It always starts with "civil unions". Baby steps.
1318927427360481286 2020-10-21 22:49:37 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ScottTallman4 God speed dear heart. We need you BADLY!!

1318926487916056577 2020-10-21 22:45:53 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @nypapajoe Explode, implode, I don't care as long as he plodes.
1318926017612947457 2020-10-21 22:44:01 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Sherrillacyr12 It's all in the hands of the good people of Kentucky. What's it gonna be Kentuckians??
1318925250151800833 2020-10-21 22:40:58 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JustStacie5683 They need to put him in a sound proof booth.
1318914924010180613 2020-10-21 21:59:56 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @mzmitchell1324 @JoeBiden Thank you for being such great parents and role models for our youngest voters.

1318900040094679040 2020-10-21 21:00:48 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @charlesornstein @LeChatNoire4 The EPA needs to be flushed out and rebuilt as soon as intelligence and reason returns to our WH.
1318898764103503873 2020-10-21 20:55:43 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JoyceGriggs2020 Come ooooonnnn Georgia!!!!!!!
1318896435669192706 2020-10-21 20:46:28 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @TraceyH81877886 @CoreyCiorciari @HillaryClinton It was a national day of mourning on that horrible day.
1318895974392172546 2020-10-21 20:44:38 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ginajellybeana7 @PaineSister It's up to the good people of Kentucky now.
1318891923952832512 2020-10-21 20:28:33 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @MysterySolvent Shedding his covids on anyone that dares or is forced to get within 10 feet of him.
1318890845035253762 2020-10-21 20:24:15 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @anarcanon Yeah. It's like hu-MEN were born and bred for spreading war and destruction. Hopefully we are going to turn this around before it's too late.
1318890192313384960 2020-10-21 20:21:40 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @django22 Mostly angry, sometimes smart ass self.
1318889819595018240 2020-10-21 20:20:11 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @VeraMBergen If they can even find the children maybe they could post their pictures and bio's online. When decency returns to the WH there should be an all out effort to reunite these families.
1318888772063330308 2020-10-21 20:16:01 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @jacobsoboroff @leegelernt Do we even know where the children are? How they are being treated? Are they ok or have they been blindly shipped out to people and parts unknow.

1311312029253328899 2020-09-30 22:28:45 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @BettyBowers It looks like the last place on Earth melanie wants to be. Jill knew Joe needed a big hug.
1311311412669677568 2020-09-30 22:26:18 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ChafedCharlie Killer klown.
1311311202040115201 2020-09-30 22:25:28 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @cbetham I have a feeling they already know what wethepeople think about the debacle last night.
1311310711512072194 2020-09-30 22:23:31 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @jerweber It would be a shame if we can't trust our local police to keep the peace at the voting sites.

1311308887740514305 2020-09-30 22:16:16 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Spaltedmaple1 @ChrisDJackson "better and cheaper". Also invisible and not real.
1311308280757735426 2020-09-30 22:13:51 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @SusanC916 @ChrisDJackson Yep. If only he had encouraged mask wearing we would be much better off.
1311307476311179264 2020-09-30 22:10:39 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @ChrisDJackson @John_the_L I do not believe anyone could be undecided about this race. It's a race between god and evil.

1311304034872160259 2020-09-30 21:56:59 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @TimRunsHisMouth All the while telling the kkk/ neo nazis to stand by for his marching orders.
1311303638539816970 2020-09-30 21:55:24 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @JJohnsonLaw @kilmeade What would killme say to dump if he had to stand there listening to that absolute failed pot-ass speaking lies and various garbage to the American people? Would he just swallow?
1311295967757557761 2020-09-30 21:24:56 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @KarenSHudson Dump is a child abuser as is his gestapo snatching children and abusing them at will.

1311281339493224448 2020-09-30 20:26:48 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Erik_Goins @realDonaldTrump Why did he say that about not using the word smart? I found that very odd.
1311280451630305281 2020-09-30 20:23:16 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @SheriffReese You all need to get control of your cops. Charging, gassing and beating lawfully protesting citizens is no way to keep the peace.
1311278897133223937 2020-09-30 20:17:06 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Eedwardsellis @_MariaRemarque Never heard dump say anything like that.

1311147114844631041 2020-09-30 11:33:26 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @kurtbardella This fake president is not appropriate for a child to watch. It would be like them watching J Springer.

1304786293600202753 2020-09-12 22:17:48 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> What is going on with these dem candidates dropping out of very important races, waiting until AFTER it is too late to replace them??? It sounds like a set up to me. Is that "legal"? And I realize "legal" doesn't really count anymore.
1304785484074438657 2020-09-12 22:14:35 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @HKrassenstein I don't get the outrage except that gops love to fake outrage. And don't worry, there will be plenty of docs about tramp and his criminal enterprise.

1304779093066604544 2020-09-12 21:49:12 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @realDonaldTrump Tramp would come up after and take the shirt right off the poor guy's back. Literally, figuratively, take your pick.

1304605100984487939 2020-09-12 10:17:49 +0800 <MaryjaneMjmalin> @Netmeetme It makes me wonder if the dem dropping out was a set up.
