1304248385646534657 2020-09-11 10:40:21 +0800 <dreamn3d> @Bknteach So, why would a democrat like the MB tweet, "Another whistleblower" ?  Does silently answering "yes" to the tweet justify a like ?  Marsha Blackburn will deem all likes as an affirmation to proceed in publicly denigrating the whistleblower just like she did to Lt. Col. Vindman.
1304244082961715200 2020-09-11 10:23:15 +0800 <dreamn3d> @Bknteach For example, suppose @MarshaBlackburn tweeted, "Another whistleblower" in response to a statement made by @RepAdamSchiff on the Russian intel. On the surface it appears neutral and unobtrusive, but nothing about MB is reserved.  She's clearly testing the waters.
1304240692345155590 2020-09-11 10:09:47 +0800 <dreamn3d> @Bknteach Yes. Why should we give the GOP an iota of satisfaction from liking their tweets ?  An obviously sarcastic or oversimplified tweet doesn't deserve a like simply because it's a legitimate question or statement.  They're probably gauging the receptivity to a controversial issue.
