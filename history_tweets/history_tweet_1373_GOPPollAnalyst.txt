1343757089592770566 2020-12-29 11:13:50 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> The same House Republicans who voted no on the #2000StimulusChecks to help Americans voted yes for 1.5 million to study lizards on treadmills.
1343754438503182336 2020-12-29 11:03:18 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I see some Congress people Tweeting to just open the economy, no need for a stimulus.  They fought over this for how long? People are behind in bills NOW. Congress got PAID while people fell further behind.

1343741937313046528 2020-12-29 10:13:38 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> We cannot afford your insane foreign aid cash.  People are already 9 months behind in bills. You morons are too damn slow at ANYTHING to get them caught up fast.
1343740719522045952 2020-12-29 10:08:47 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @RepDanBishop The damage is done to Americans. The average person is $6,000 behind in rent or their mortgage alone. You cannot expect people to survive on $600. Wtf is wrong with you? They will never catch up without help
1343739394096771073 2020-12-29 10:03:31 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Looks like the House Republicans who voted no to help Americans but were okay with massive foreign aid completed the fracture of the Republican party.   We will not forget.

1343567943750311938 2020-12-28 22:42:14 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I keep seeing people saying no sense trying for the midterms if its rigged.  That's you. I'm not giving up that easy and neither should anyone else.

1341565810494611456 2020-12-23 10:06:28 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I think President Trump should pardon or put protections in place for all patriot Mueller Investigation subjects. Many have not gone public yet.  If the Dems take control they may revive everything.
1341564870773379073 2020-12-23 10:02:44 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Because the Democrats abuse power.  Show me the man and I will show you the crime.

1341502942860484610 2020-12-23 05:56:40 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> He said being in office shouldn't be a career to get enriched. It should be a civic duty and the work come from your heart. I feel terrible. He thought he was making a difference.
1341501351495397378 2020-12-23 05:50:20 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> He asked me how the corruption could change. I told him it will take a strong generation plus the MAGA supporters, libertarians, progressives, etc uniting against the Dems and RINOs. Something has to give.
1341500141556142086 2020-12-23 05:45:32 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I'm really angry. Angry for my son's generation (Zoomer). He didn't ignore politics. He registered to vote. Now he believes elections are fraudulent and nothing will change the corruption. He isn't alone.

I have vetted 1,000s of federal candidates for 3 elections (2016-now). I would not expect state level support like with federal. She shows WAY more than most. Sen. Mayfield is doing a good job.
1329916859731357697 2020-11-21 06:37:42 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Sounds like a good idea.
1329915723364380672 2020-11-21 06:33:11 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> You called Mueller's team with earth shattering evidence that turned out to be total BS.  You're a joke. Have a seat.
1329915381251764225 2020-11-21 06:31:50 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @emptywheel Who are you to talk??? You called Mueller's team with insane bs saying it was evidence of a crime. You're a total joke. Even the leftie journalists called you unprofessional for outing a source (even though not a real one).

1325978511807537153 2020-11-10 09:48:07 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I deleted the list with Congress numbers. Honestly I spent a lot of time on that and it was hardly spread. I thought people wanted to fight.. Info gets nowhere but other things go viral. It's like no one is trying.  I'm done.
1325937889885163527 2020-11-10 07:06:42 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I saw the posts about Parler. It's all social media.   I'm not giving up, but I need a break. I honestly don't where my future is. It's really depressing.
1325935344081117189 2020-11-10 06:56:35 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> The Democrats hate America.
1325934698930057216 2020-11-10 06:54:01 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @Julie_Tkachenko @VICE I'm so sorry to hear that. It's been hard on me so I know it has been hard on you too. I'll be thinking of you.
1325933170605297666 2020-11-10 06:47:57 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> The Democrats are in full gear with the COVID scare tactic.  If they think I'm abandoning my dad for the holidays, after my mom died in Jan, they are delusional.   f-off @VICE   https://t.co/63KCmwPK7X
1325887759437926400 2020-11-10 03:47:30 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I'm burned out on Twitter.
1325874341461053441 2020-11-10 02:54:11 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Quick reminder that everyone's voice and help matters in the MAGA movement, regardless of follow count or popularity contest results.  Sort of disgusted with the power struggle of opportunity right now tbh. But then again, I don't grift.

1325665096257974272 2020-11-09 13:02:43 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> It's a sad day on Twitter. @mad_liberals has been suspended. He's one of the few people I've met outside of here. I adore him and Mrs. Mad. ‚ô•Ô∏è  Who will stand up for free speech?
1325663116965900289 2020-11-09 12:54:51 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I remember when Democrats supported privacy laws, exposing corruption, loved Wikileaks and freedom of speech. Now...  Twitter is flagging/suspending anyone who questions voter fraud and election integrity in 2020 and Democrats are okay with that.

1325598863680548864 2020-11-09 08:39:32 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @yashar @alaynatreene How many people looked up their dead relatives voting record to ensure the Dems didn't use it?  My mom passed Jan 2020 and I checked. We shouldn't have to look.
1325598357415407616 2020-11-09 08:37:31 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Good.
1325598313396244481 2020-11-09 08:37:20 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @yashar @alaynatreene Look at all the Dems in here wanting to shut Trump for exposing truth.  Truly disgusting to be sheep in this and not want truth.

1325583587392024576 2020-11-09 07:38:50 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Anyone else get a fake ass vibe from Tweets like this? Just like with Hillary's Tweets. All manufactured like a boy band.
1325582950126268416 2020-11-09 07:36:18 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @JoeBiden Your side called me a Russian agent for 4 years and threatened me with violence and jail time for whistleblowing to Congress. So no thanks with your fake ass unity Tweet.

1325512628815400962 2020-11-09 02:56:52 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Thank you for supporting Paulette. It has touched me &amp; I appreciate everyone's encouraging words and prayers for her, her daughter Amy, and their whole family.  Her dr is awful. He told her today she won't be going home &amp; has put fear into her that she may die. Keep praying.
1325511330690961411 2020-11-09 02:51:42 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> The media is trying to pump pure emotion into the election results. They've swayed public opinion for decades, do not fall for it.

1325165218956103680 2020-11-08 03:56:23 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I'm not sure what the future of the election holds but calm, positive,  rational thought will help vs freak out mode. We need to be smart. Stoicism works.

1325141059395940352 2020-11-08 02:20:23 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I wanted everything from Spygate to Hunter Biden's corruption and Hillary's emails FBI files declassified and exposed. Now.
1325128502891454465 2020-11-08 01:30:29 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Twitter is a cesspool. Time for self care.
1325126080420831232 2020-11-08 01:20:51 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @AOC You are a terrible person.
1325125378642358272 2020-11-08 01:18:04 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> The Democrats are making hit lists of Trump supporters at all levels. Can you imagine being this deranged?   If you think the Mueller Investigation was bad wait until they revive it for 2.0 and drag the revealed patriots in it, if Biden takes office.
1325119917708947457 2020-11-08 00:56:22 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I voted for Trump to fight for us and we've fought together for 4 years and I won't leave him behind.  I challenge everything about these elections and support a hand count of every single race.

1324952244693905414 2020-11-07 13:50:06 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> How sad is it that I have to defend a woman's honor who may die because some people think everything is a conspiracy.

1324935914666283011 2020-11-07 12:45:12 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Quite honestly, the ones questioning my Tweets is disgusting. I've spent years proving myself to be trustworthy.
1324935413170130944 2020-11-07 12:43:13 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> A few have sent DMs or Tweets saying this is a fake story.  Just like my research, I come with receipts.   This woman is on her 13th night alone in JFK hospital in Lake Worth and could die. She's Trump former photographer of 17 yrs. See her About Me page below.

1320905401458634753 2020-10-27 09:49:23 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @Sdp70Steve @real_Stephanie Wikileaks had dozens of releases in batches so I'm not sure why you are saying this. I am opposed to only certain people having access which gives them clicks and cash. I'm really sick of the opportunists on both sides.

1320840550220783622 2020-10-27 05:31:41 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Proud to be almost five years and two elections grift free.
1320839023879925762 2020-10-27 05:25:37 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> The difference between 2016 &amp; now is in 2016 we all pitched in with our WL highlighters &amp; it was in unity.  We said we couldn't rely on news to divvy out the info.  In 2020, the news is slow dripping it and some of you are ok with it because its people "you like"
1320797718105784327 2020-10-27 02:41:29 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Anyone who thinks I am talking about releasing child porn doesn't know me at all and quite frankly it is insulting to assume I mean release it. I'm talking about emails/doca. Seriously wtf people?
1320797154588430337 2020-10-27 02:39:15 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @Diana24724 Why in the world do you think I am backing child porn distribution. I'm talking about emails and docs.
1320796700911480833 2020-10-27 02:37:27 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @Banky1974 Hi Banky!! üòÄ

1320796318990827522 2020-10-27 02:35:56 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Most of the Podesta dump connections came from data digger/historian types. Giving the Hunter Biden data to a select few who get their scoops from the diggers makes no sense.
1320795655489597441 2020-10-27 02:33:18 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @Diana24724 I'm not referring to releasing child porn. I'm talking about emails/documents.
1320794906374393857 2020-10-27 02:30:19 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Not a fan of how the Hunter Biden info is coming out.   Release it to the masses for transparency. Wikileaks did it right. Verify and release it all.
1320686829528616960 2020-10-26 19:20:51 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @ksorbs Same in 2016, but most forgot how much work the data diggers did.  The blue checks don't follow the true researchers.

1320407318996148227 2020-10-26 00:50:11 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @KingBroly Can you imagine looking up all your neighbors then knocking on their doors to confront them to vote? Um no lol
1320404888728309761 2020-10-26 00:40:32 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I saw an ad on YouTube that said how you vote is secret but if you voted is public record...(paraphasing) so look up your friends and family and help them vote.  What??

1318976194679873536 2020-10-22 02:03:24 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> The reason Tweets like below don't do better is because both sides time things out. It's gross.  So when someone like me verifies and releases most blue checks won't share it but later Tweet about it like it magically appeared.

We sat down at close distance at a table and every single Dem left their mask off, having fun, laughing etc. People on both sides are over the scare tactics.
1315316263254622208 2020-10-11 23:40:09 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @BoddahflyIson @realDonaldTrump I agree the Affordable Care Act does help many. It's a complex subject. I'm glad your family is helped by it. I don't know what the answers are but we do have a lot of work to do.

1315314741536063488 2020-10-11 23:34:06 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Yes, lets see emails between Hillary Clinton and Obama. Especially ones she sent him from Russia that the FBI asked her about. Source: FBI Vault  You know, where US officials are not supposed to use phones cause of hacking.

1315311814998097921 2020-10-11 23:22:28 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @realDonaldTrump Actually let me correct that. The VA left him to die. He was bleeding internally &amp; they couldn't find from where so they said they wouldn't look anymore. He had a varicose vein in his intestine we found out. Treatable! That's how Obama/Biden treated Vets

1315290443081551873 2020-10-11 21:57:33 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Will the new Hillary email dump include the more than 100 emails between Hillary &amp; Obama?  Probably not but it should.

1311972012919750656 2020-10-02 18:11:17 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Just finished a training session at the gym. Someone there was gleeful that President Trump &amp; FLOTUS have covid. That's how I found out.  I could not help myself. Me: if you think covid is so deadly why are you happy another person has it. Shameful.
1311971101132685312 2020-10-02 18:07:40 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS The President &amp; FLOTUS will be fine. I've had covid with moderate to severe asthma and was fine. He has a good medical team.

1311824626796892160 2020-10-02 08:25:38 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Is it me or are all businesses/agencies blaming everything on covid. I've been waiting 2.5 weeks for a new DL after my purse was stolen. DMV to me: As you know, covid....
1311818724010340354 2020-10-02 08:02:10 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @ZachCoveyTV Every person (a lot) I spoke with was mad about 2-3 alerts across their phones in the middle of the night. I'm trying to stay awake right now like a 95 year old.

1311802004394696704 2020-10-02 06:55:44 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @ConagherConn I certainly never wished to. All they do is fight and steal content from each other for clicks.

1311367629496606720 2020-10-01 02:09:41 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Random: I've been noticing more often when someone says, "hi, how are you" and you try to answer they cut you off and say what they want...  Spend 20 seconds listening.
1311366206243434496 2020-10-01 02:04:02 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> We need more WH logs research.  A while back I proved Lisa Page worked on the Mueller &amp; Hillary case using the logs. Blue checks were silent.  Then one day like magic they all said she did w/o any proof. Lmao
1311365273635651584 2020-10-01 02:00:19 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Can someone ask Comey what Mueller's conflict of interest was that he was given a waiver for to become Special Prosecutor?  @realDonaldTrump has hinted at it. I want to know if Mueller worked on Hillary's case.
1311362545278742528 2020-10-01 01:49:29 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Turns out @mad_liberals did some data digging in the Obama Biden WH Logs  See what he found. üòÄ  https://t.co/pWmGJ1vn5P

1311277670274080768 2020-09-30 20:12:13 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> At the next debate, Trump should spend one of the timeframes reading his exact speech statement about 'very fine people' and have @DanScavino  put the proof on Trump's Twitter account.
1311272950440628224 2020-09-30 19:53:28 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I looked at replies to me from last nights debate. It's the same accounts (some new) with the same exact insults and buzzwords/phrases from 2016/2018. I üòÇ at them.

1311154021080629248 2020-09-30 12:00:53 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @AOC Why don't you work on jobs for your state instead of non stop drama? Oh that's right, you love when jobs are lost there.

1311140572732760064 2020-09-30 11:07:27 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I remember election night in 2016. SO many Trump supporters were stressed, asking me what I thought. I said Trump would win. I feel the same now. I'm not gonna stress over it.
1311139911282626568 2020-09-30 11:04:49 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I don't really care about the debates. I don't know anyone who would swing vote based on one debate. Trump has a baseline with Biden now and will use it for the next one.
1311130938722652160 2020-09-30 10:29:10 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> President Trump has been here for the Forgotten Men &amp; Women.  Obama/Biden abandoned us. I'm not going backwards. Vote Trump #Debates2020 üá∫üá∏
1311130056085901312 2020-09-30 10:25:39 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> I heard this same bs from Obama that he could create 1000s of jobs that Biden is saying. I was long term unemployed w/an advanced degree under Obama &amp; lived on savings. So excuse me if I don't want more Obama Hope &amp; Change #Debates2020
1311125170875248640 2020-09-30 10:06:14 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Did Biden say there's no racism after saying there was racism?
1311123693968515073 2020-09-30 10:00:22 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Shame on all Dem blue check media types who refuse to debunk the 'very fine people' lie from Biden. #Debates2020
1311120629043789824 2020-09-30 09:48:12 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Biden's economic plan is to make regular Americans suffer financially and mentally after he shuts down the economy to appease the Karen's of the US. It's sick.

1308969681110392833 2020-09-24 11:21:06 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @DaddyDrewMAGA I'll say it. This Tweet looks fake. As a parent, if my son was shot, the last thing I'd be doing is Tweeting and asking for followers, RTs and subscribers. Sounds like bs

1308908127568441344 2020-09-24 07:16:30 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> This time 4 years ago, @RepStevenSmith was giving me a pep talk. I wanted to give up, everything was chaos.  He said we had to keep going. I imagine a few of you need to hear that now. Every voice matters, 1 follower or 100K - keep speaking out. üåª‚ô•Ô∏è

1308597350479409152 2020-09-23 10:41:35 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> And why don't MAGA blue checks help promote candidates?   Have you seen any help? Why am I the only one questioning it. Use your damn blue check to help us.

1307750840992755714 2020-09-21 02:37:51 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> And smart people have read President Trump's early on Tweets. He was a BILLIONAIRE Tweeting good morning and happy birthday to followers of all walks of life. So pardon me @clairecmc if I think you're full of bs
1307750191467040774 2020-09-21 02:35:17 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> So when I see people like Claire McCaskill trying to shame Trump supporters for supporting our president using cheap tactics it pisses me off. Google has hidden most all of the good he has done. It's disgusting.

1305620414329229312 2020-09-15 05:32:18 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @jackphatz If Laura Loomer is elected she will hire Wohl along with the rest of her buddies. Then they'll be everyone's problem. This is my district.
1305619862555897857 2020-09-15 05:30:07 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @golfboatMAGA If someone is asking me for their vote I'm seeing who they associate with and call a "mentor" or friend. Her mentor asked Trump to declare martial law if he loses. We don't need this bs. I'll hold onto my principles.

1305603771855187974 2020-09-15 04:26:10 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> Are we ignoring that nutjobs Jacob Wohl/Jack Burkman staged a fake FBI raid? Laura Loomer's bff's? Is that the sort of stunts we need in office?

1304794138957803520 2020-09-12 22:48:59 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> We always hear from the same Mueller investigation subjects on social media.  Would you be interested in a book with each chapter about a different subject (person)? eBook format to keep it inexpensive?
1304788718163816449 2020-09-12 22:27:26 +0800 <GOPPollAnalyst> @realDonaldTrump And thank you President Trump for using that research in your past campaign email. It was an honor.
