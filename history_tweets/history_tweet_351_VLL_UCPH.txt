1337106347238809600 2020-12-11 02:46:10 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> @samanthagwolfe What are you aiming for? Any specifics in mind?

1333695653977976832 2020-12-01 16:53:17 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Results of our experiments show that a combination of the medium and method influences how we learn. We recently published a paper about it. Read it here üëâ:  https://t.co/aTiIs7rFeE  #VLL_UCPH #ImmersiveEducation #VREdu #VR #AR #education #research #cph @uni_copenhagen @KuSamf
1333695652220579840 2020-12-01 16:53:17 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Some believe it is the method of teaching that is most important (i.e., the instructional materials we provide). Others think the medium (i.e., text, video, immersive VR) has most influence on how we learn. We provide a third perspective. üëá  https://t.co/HlXWc4Bjb1
1333434658823008260 2020-11-30 23:36:11 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> @classabstract_ the great thing about immersive education is that it allows students to learn at their own pace, and according to our studies it has a positive effect on learning
1331262712379224064 2020-11-24 23:45:38 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> @samanthagwolfe Jeremy Bailenson, @StanfordVR  and a couple others have very informative articles. Our own recent paper was already mentioned in the comments, but we also have some more in depth articles on the specific aspects of VR in education,
1331261782577606656 2020-11-24 23:41:57 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> @jacktionman @samanthagwolfe Thank you for sharing our research! Let us know your thoughts after reading the paper ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1330821777518424065 2020-11-23 18:33:31 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Read the full paper for a more detailed description! It can be found here, in the form of a pre-print, as it awaits publishing:  https://t.co/Lu0aIFl9vU  #VLL_UCPH #VREdu #ImmersiveEducation #CAMIL @uni_copenhagen @KUSamf [4/4]
1330821775312248833 2020-11-23 18:33:31 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The model describes how certain media-method combinations aid learning more than others. It can be used to guide research, but also serve as a baseline for educators wishing to introduce VR simulations into their everyday teaching. [3/4]
1330821773298962433 2020-11-23 18:33:30 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> It is a model based on the interactions of media and method, which describes how interest, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, among other factors, influence learning in virtual environments. [2/4]
1330821770727858178 2020-11-23 18:33:30 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Recently, our Guido Makransky and @gustavbpetersen wrote a paper describing a new model of immersive learning, and it has just been accepted for publication in Educational Psychology Review! If you'd like to know what CAMIL is, there is a short summary belowüëá[1/4]  https://t.co/dPbYOGrh2L
1326516334763642880 2020-11-11 21:25:14 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The paper can be found here:  https://t.co/RTkFU96cG1 #VLL_UCPH #UCPH #VREdu #EdTech #IVR #ImmersiveEducation @uni_copenhagen @KUSamf [7/7]
1326516332809113601 2020-11-11 21:25:13 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Our findings provide evidence that introducing IVR into classrooms can help spark interests in the field of science, among students of various ages. IVR also presents the possibility to even out the gender gap in career aspirations in more technical fields. [6/7]
1326516330468610048 2020-11-11 21:25:13 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The older students showed results similar to the young, but only with an IVR simulation, not when they were watching the same simulation on a computer. This substantiates the results from previous studies, that immersive VR provides better learning outcomes than desktop VR. [5/7]  https://t.co/D4lvToWN6H
1326516326848925696 2020-11-11 21:25:12 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> However, only female students showed more interest in a scientific career after taking part in the VR exercise. This might be because females initially reported lower aspirations in becoming scientists, and so we observed the most significant change for this group. [4/7]
1326516324605042688 2020-11-11 21:25:11 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The younger students were presented with a simulation about lab safety, and our results showed an increased interest in laboratory science, from before to after the exercise. This is consistent with findings by other researchers such as Parong &amp; Mayer or @FabioButtussi. [3/7]
1326516322725924867 2020-11-11 21:25:11 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The paper reports two studies, one involving middle-school children, the other high school students. In both cases we measured attention and motivation, but also whether students showed more interest in a scientific career after the simulation. [2/7]
1326516318380515329 2020-11-11 21:25:10 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> A paper by Makransky et al. was recently published in a special section of the British Journal of Educational Technology. In it we investigate whether immersive virtual reality can increase interest in scientific topics among students. [1/7]  https://t.co/T9F0r2LmYh
1323218899467468801 2020-11-02 19:02:24 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The preprint can be found at this link:  https://t.co/oeh95sbvkW                            #VLL_UCPH #UCPH #VR #VRedu #ImmersiveEducation #VRlearning @uni_copenhagen @KUSamf #EdTech
1323218896107831298 2020-11-02 19:02:23 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> We therefore encourage educators to introduce HMDs into their classrooms, especially for complex, hard to imagine topics, but to introduce it in combination with reflection exercises outside of VR. These can help students organize and reflect upon what they learned.  https://t.co/r1ggy11OxS
1323218890604896257 2020-11-02 19:02:22 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> In conclusion, our findings show that the biggest learning advantage is obtained when combining a simulation using an HMD with reflection exercises, and that this outperforms learning through desktop VR.
1323218888398655488 2020-11-02 19:02:21 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Our results show an interaction effect between media and method. We did not find a significant difference in learning between the two media themselves. However, when combined with reflection exercises, learning with HMDs was more successful than with desktop.
1323218885726871554 2020-11-02 19:02:21 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> We investigated differences between learning with desktop VR and head-mounted displays. Participants experienced a simulation both using desktop VR and HMD (media). Half of the students did a reflection exercise (method). We measured students' learning, attention, and interests.  https://t.co/kyJg3WMtpQ
1323218879569629184 2020-11-02 19:02:19 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> In a paper by our Klingenberg et al. from latest special section of the British Journal of Educational Technology, we tackle the complex relationship between media and method in education. Does the method, medium, or a combination of both have the biggest effect on learning?üëá  https://t.co/1Ag4HYgpEz
1320026650654932993 2020-10-24 23:37:33 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The full article can be found here:  https://t.co/lV34JNId17   #VLL_UCPH #UCPH #VR #BJET #IVR #education #edtech @uni_copenhagen @KuSamf [6/6]
1320026648507568134 2020-10-24 23:37:32 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Addtionally, we observed the biggest increase in knowledge when some introduction to the topic was given before students entered the simulation. They could then learn further by exploring in IVR, but importantly, with the cognitive load placed on them greatly reduced. [5/6]
1320026646594916352 2020-10-24 23:37:32 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> Our results provide evidence that IVR, introduced as part of inquiry based learning, increases students' intentions to change behaviour in relation to protecting the environment. A finding corroborated in previous studies, e.g. by Jeremy Bailenson from @StanfordVR. [4/6]
1320026644778749952 2020-10-24 23:37:31 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> By immersing students in virtual reality, we provide them with a chance to explore an otherwise inaccessible environment, and make observations of their own. We were curious to see if that would have an impact on students‚Äô interest in climate change. [3/6]
1320026642455138306 2020-10-24 23:37:31 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> The aim of the study was to investigate students' intentions to take action, and change behaviour in relation to climate change, before and after learning about global warming in a VR simulation. [2/6]
1320026639846297601 2020-10-24 23:37:30 +0800 <VLL_UCPH> In a recent paper by @gustavbpetersen, published in the latest special section of the British Journal of Educational Technology, students were taken on a virtual field trip. More than a 100 of them went to Greenland to explore the effects of climate change on icecaps.  [1/6]  https://t.co/OXqRi3f6bK
