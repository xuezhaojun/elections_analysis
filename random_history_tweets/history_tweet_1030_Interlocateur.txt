1322185720426102785 2020-10-30 22:36:55 +0800 <Interlocateur> Emphasis on "wearing CLOTH  face mask". A known ineffective barrier. And by the way, masks primarily limit the WEARER'S pathogens from spreading to OTHERS. Unless it's an N95 mask which offers wearer protection too. Some quality masks help block wearer. #Covid19 truth.

Latest public polls are literally asking if you consider yourself an Evangelical #Christian even if you check off Jewish or Other for religion. Pitiful they select THIS as the imagine of us.

Lightening rod.

1319777592292028416 2020-10-24 07:07:52 +0800 <Interlocateur> @davidhogg111 David child you need help for PTSD +addiction to media attention. Pls get help. You look severely depressed all the time. And r so negative.
1319776620534706179 2020-10-24 07:04:01 +0800 <Interlocateur> @ilovecakepops @davidhogg111 Well yeah.... Border Patrol + Customs have a fast lane as a courtesy for the wildlife with an interest in immigration +social justice. It was coyotes themselves who demanded the cages. Was the coyotes BnB orig.
1319774767445147648 2020-10-24 06:56:39 +0800 <Interlocateur> @davidhogg111 Yes...imagine!! Imagine places in the country w/ a culture where ppl don't cry over silly things like local slang. Imagine a country where children don't get to make the rules or exaggerate all the time 4 attn. Imagine that 4 a moment child.
1319773457094201346 2020-10-24 06:51:27 +0800 <Interlocateur> @davidhogg111 Child, I lived at US-Mex border as an adult since 1970. Term COYOTE was active THEN! It was in reference to those smuggling ANYTHING OR ANYONE into US for money. They cross via the region where coyotes run. Hence the slang. Grow up + shut up pls. You embarass our country.
1319772937759707137 2020-10-24 06:49:23 +0800 <Interlocateur> Child, I lived at the US Mexico border as an adult since 1970. The term #COYOTE was active even THEN! It was in reference to those smuggling ANYTHING OR ANYONE into US for money. They cross the region where coyotes run. Hence the slang.

1319698629993562112 2020-10-24 01:54:06 +0800 <Interlocateur> The US media isn't commenting on this incredible #MiddleEast  peace making. #Sudan of all nations.....strict #Islamic + inclined to neighnorhood war. @realDonaldTrump has brought about unexpected things.

1319501120482443265 2020-10-23 12:49:16 +0800 <Interlocateur> Absolutely. A fact. Biden doesn't like it that a newby is more popular with the new Dems than he is.

1319475748806283266 2020-10-23 11:08:27 +0800 <Interlocateur> #PresidentialDebate2020   President #Trump was at his best.  . #Biden began to reveal his true left crazy ideas for America. He lied about fracking.. Or maybe he doesn't know what he says or believes since he has dementia.

1318942492260184064 2020-10-21 23:49:29 +0800 <Interlocateur> @40_head @LyndaAtchison Because everyone else voiced far extremists left ideologies and were an offense+threat.

1318918444805464064 2020-10-21 22:13:56 +0800 <Interlocateur> #Election2020  How things change. Went to the polls yesterday for early #voting. IN THE SOUTH. The outside tables for #Republican info had 3 black women handing out info. Democrats table had white men. Things have changed. Alot.
1318909776785559552 2020-10-21 21:39:29 +0800 <Interlocateur> This is absurd. Travel restrictions allows provide for life saving exemptions properly coordinated. This shows a terrible GOVT policy. The criminal is the GOVT here.
1318908727853023234 2020-10-21 21:35:19 +0800 <Interlocateur> Perhaps they can shed light on how he can boost his cognition.
1318697115078565890 2020-10-21 07:34:27 +0800 <Interlocateur> Sad that the ppl who paid the most in the state for super high priced real estate are living similarly to the homeless in the streets in N Cal. Only they have a private toilet.

1314032746730270720 2020-10-08 10:39:55 +0800 <Interlocateur> @Kid_Monk_Baroni @realDonaldTrump @VP Ive been a lifelong Republican but so angered by Trump I was leaving the party. But Pence reminded me why Ive been a Republican.
1314032342499950598 2020-10-08 10:38:18 +0800 <Interlocateur> @Kid_Monk_Baroni @realDonaldTrump @VP @VP is also sincere. A quality not commonly found in politics.
1314032037087653889 2020-10-08 10:37:05 +0800 <Interlocateur> @VP  is excellent in clarifying information to the public. @realDonaldTrump should have utilized Pence's skills in behalf of the election bc @POTUS is his own worst enemy in the area of communication.
1314031336903016455 2020-10-08 10:34:18 +0800 <Interlocateur> If @realDonaldTrump would have just let @VP #Pence be the voice of the Repub party the party would have been much better off  #VPDebate  #VPDebate2020
1314020014211690496 2020-10-08 09:49:19 +0800 <Interlocateur> #VPDebate  We are looking at the Democratic President if Biden is elected.
1314019581489537024 2020-10-08 09:47:36 +0800 <Interlocateur> @Kid_Monk_Baroni Democrats believe in control of individual's behavior. Although maskless ppl in public threaten the public, Democrat's mandates would over-regulate + criminalize every person.
1313478327886282752 2020-10-06 21:56:51 +0800 <Interlocateur> @realDonaldTrump  #DJT #InfectorInChief  The behavior of #DJT as a role model for Americans in how to address the pandemic is a clear snapshot of why the #US has such high infection +  death rates. The callous proud disregard for others + medical standards are shocking. #COVID19
1313327892147982336 2020-10-06 11:59:04 +0800 <Interlocateur> @PatMann1 @maureendowd exactly.
1313327783381209088 2020-10-06 11:58:38 +0800 <Interlocateur> I guess #WalterReed  is being nailed for successfully treating the Covid19 #Potus was treated for. #TrumpCovid19
1313326569830612992 2020-10-06 11:53:49 +0800 <Interlocateur> Don't you think the failure of the WH to observe basic precautions + also gather leaves them open in a pandemic? Rhetorical. #COVID19
1313325909382959105 2020-10-06 11:51:11 +0800 <Interlocateur> Man was not wearing gloves or mask. Unlikely laced w virus. Video DOES NOT show if he wiped other podium too.
1313324405506932737 2020-10-06 11:45:13 +0800 <Interlocateur> @MArizanti I hope#Israel changes direction and stops arming Azerbaijan! Support Armenia!!! Those are kindred people to Jews bc #genocide + Christianity.
1313323752294359042 2020-10-06 11:42:37 +0800 <Interlocateur> @Ostrov_A @PresidentPeres I had the honor of attending a briefing by him in Costa Mesa Calif 1999. His presence extended thru the room. He briefed us on Islamic terrorism. Said they will cross the Atlantic soon. No one grasped it fully. Then came Sept 11 2001. #RIP #ShimonPeres
1313319926627741701 2020-10-06 11:27:25 +0800 <Interlocateur> @MaxAbrahms Dexamethasone is a short term fountain of youth and euphoria maker. Having been given it too. You feel perfect. Super energy. But when it wears off, it's midnight for Cinderella.
1313319181069299712 2020-10-06 11:24:27 +0800 <Interlocateur> The US has no credibility in its state-sponsored terrorism policies. How about looking into how the US sponsors terrorism. Yes. We do. But we call it by a different name.
1312530580207104003 2020-10-04 07:10:50 +0800 <Interlocateur> @baalter Alot of politicians go into politics for the power not the money. Ex: Feinstein/CA her husband is an exceedingly rich businessman. She doesn't need the salary. Small change to them.
1312524930022424577 2020-10-04 06:48:23 +0800 <Interlocateur> @Faytuks @takemelivenews I didn't read that anywhere.
1312519493499854848 2020-10-04 06:26:47 +0800 <Interlocateur> @Lrihendry @Ginngee2302 She was there w only1 person. A stylist w a mask. Different.
1312512125122748416 2020-10-04 05:57:30 +0800 <Interlocateur> #Dog #Loss. I buried my 24/7 365 √ó 10 yrs faithful companion last evening. We said goodbye on a beautiful autumn afternoon on the lawn. The Vet relieved her pain. I felt her leave in my heart the moment of her passing. #DogLove The worst day of a dog buddy's life. üíî #RIP Sweetie
1311509632595251201 2020-10-01 11:33:57 +0800 <Interlocateur> @Kid_Monk_Baroni @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The thing about these clips are that they are said AFTER he was rebuked for NOT saying it when asked or appropriate. These clips are for the record when he was caught in the camp of the Haters. These are to cover his original different responses. So they are just BS.
1311508650251481091 2020-10-01 11:30:03 +0800 <Interlocateur> Trump cheerleaders: pls unfollow me. Q parrots: the same. Thank you. Im done with the insanity of politics. Both parties are sick in their respective ways.
1311508072993562625 2020-10-01 11:27:45 +0800 <Interlocateur> #help  My next door neighbor is -I believe- involved in #WhiteSupremacist domestic terrorism. Who should I report this to? What r the potential consequences to me?
1311496876504616960 2020-10-01 10:43:16 +0800 <Interlocateur> The USG is 90% corrupt. So finger pointing is meaningless.
1311495801277997056 2020-10-01 10:39:00 +0800 <Interlocateur> @realDonaldTrump Yeah the historic values of the KKK. You will lose 2020. Good riddance to a #WhiteSupremacist supporter. The truth has been clear. Your reign of craziness is over.
1311494843668070403 2020-10-01 10:35:11 +0800 <Interlocateur> @realDonaldTrump You are a loser. Anyone who can't condemn the evils of the #WhiteSupremacists in the country IS UNFIT TO LEAD IT. You DJT have converted me from a lifelong active Repub to a one-election Democrat just to put my weight against the likes of you. I think you will lose. You are hated
1311493536500588545 2020-10-01 10:30:00 +0800 <Interlocateur> No. But I am in 2020. Not bc I think Biden is anything but a demented creep. But bc @POTUS supported #WhiteSupremacists  in the US. They are the most evil freaks. So anyone is better than #Trump.
1311492753830838275 2020-10-01 10:26:53 +0800 <Interlocateur> NEVER until this upcoming election.
1311491711244402689 2020-10-01 10:22:44 +0800 <Interlocateur> Re @POTUS @realDonaldTrump : As a long term victim.of #WhiteSupremacy crime- I WILL VOTE FOR #BIDEN bc Mr President could not condemn White Supremacist organized crimes in the US. I WAS a lifelong #Republican. NOT NOW. Goodbye LOSER #TRUMP.
1311490795892101121 2020-10-01 10:19:06 +0800 <Interlocateur> @MaxAbrahms Reality is that USG Black Ops have been behaving like the Nazi regime in that they use emf weaponry-often the weaponization of residential and local govt EMF +emergency broadcast channels and LIKE THE HOLOCAUST-ppl LIKE YOU live denying the FACT. So -hell yes there r similarities
