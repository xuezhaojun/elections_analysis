1343947597589966855 2020-12-29 23:50:51 +0800 <morrismd1918> Can't the GOP just print up a couple hundred thousand ballots for Loeffler and Purdue to ensure that they win the election?   No one gets charged for election fraud in Georgia, so why not?
1343946993031389185 2020-12-29 23:48:27 +0800 <morrismd1918> Dems consider it an honor to cheat on elections.  This will never change until Law Enforcement convicts people for election fraud and sends them to prison.

You know the 47+ story building that collapsed on 9/1 w/o getting hit by a plane?  It seems that Lone Wolf bombers love to hit buildings that are full of incriminating records.

I wonder what tipped them off; a vehicle full of explosives, a recording announcing that there is a bomb,  an explosion?   There is some pretty keen detective work taking place in Nashville.

This is nothing but political gamesmanship at the expense of American workers.   Rip the bill up at the podium like she did w/ your SOTU &amp; tell her never to bring you a POS like this again.
1341189268962750464 2020-12-22 09:10:14 +0800 <morrismd1918> Will the illegal aliens, dead people, people living at Post Office boxes and in multiple states receive the $600 stimulus checks or will they receive multiple checks based on how many times they voted?

1339116709052026887 2020-12-16 15:54:37 +0800 <morrismd1918> The scam was more sophisticated than that. Trump had to win many counties so that it would look real. There was shaving to reduce Trump’s margin of victory and adjudication, fake ballots, and major vote shifting in the big cities. But you already knew that.

1338091967775993857 2020-12-13 20:02:40 +0800 <morrismd1918> So, Eric can you please explain to the world why total deaths have not gone up while we are in the middle of a “pandemic”?
1338082668416823296 2020-12-13 19:25:43 +0800 <morrismd1918> Barr and Durham took too long so Trump’s team exposed them, forcing indictments before a potential Presidential transition.      well played, Mr. President.   @realDonaldTrump
1337924076917157888 2020-12-13 08:55:32 +0800 <morrismd1918> @MajorPatriot @Nonofmybiznez Just put an admission of guilt on the teleprompter. ChinaJoe has no idea what he is reading.

1337868663945392129 2020-12-13 05:15:20 +0800 <morrismd1918> Cheif Lovell - I think that AG Janet Reno left some notes about how best to handle these situations.
1337819484309114884 2020-12-13 01:59:55 +0800 <morrismd1918> Trump isn't the type to strictly play defense.   I wonder what he has going on to destroy China's economy and push Xi from office?   All he needs to do is pull the trigger.

1337814170528518144 2020-12-13 01:38:48 +0800 <morrismd1918> Instead of buying jets, ships, and bombs, the CCP bought politicians.
1337813554875994112 2020-12-13 01:36:21 +0800 <morrismd1918> Pfizer's CEO also blackballed the use of hydroxychloroquine because he couldn't make any money with it.
1337812503728943105 2020-12-13 01:32:10 +0800 <morrismd1918> There were far too many people involved in the election fraud in too many states. If the FBI can't find someone to talk, they're not looking.
1337810980030574594 2020-12-13 01:26:07 +0800 <morrismd1918> Let's hope that the SCOTUS threw out the Texas case on a technicality to stifle criticism when they throw out Pennsylvania's mail-in votes on a technicality.
1337805629726060551 2020-12-13 01:04:52 +0800 <morrismd1918> The statistical analyses that are used to identify election fraud are more accurate than the DNA tests that are used to convict murderers.
1337795293572698113 2020-12-13 00:23:47 +0800 <morrismd1918> We need to get out of the UN now.
1337795010813698049 2020-12-13 00:22:40 +0800 <morrismd1918> I could possibly buy into Barr running out of time to indict Spygate players before the 60-day election window.   What I cannot buy into is Barr allowing Wray to cover-up, not investigate, and refuse to release documents.

1337772837449428993 2020-12-12 22:54:33 +0800 <morrismd1918> Don't blame the SCOTUS for their ruling, blame state legislators for certifying fraudulent election results and the FBI for refusing to report election crimes.

1337756727232651265 2020-12-12 21:50:32 +0800 <morrismd1918> Washington DC is just like the Portland riots.   When there are no consequences for illegal actions, the lawlessness continues forever.
1337747999317954560 2020-12-12 21:15:51 +0800 <morrismd1918> On December 4th, the Arizona legislature called for a forensic audit of the Dominion voting machines that were used in Maricopa county.  Whare are the results?
1337745866602532871 2020-12-12 21:07:23 +0800 <morrismd1918> Why didn't the FBI simply seize Dominion voting machines in Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Phoenix, and Atlanta?
1337743841491898372 2020-12-12 20:59:20 +0800 <morrismd1918> The election outcome is a matter of law enforcement, not civil cases in court.   The FBI has refused 2 perform their assigned duties 4 over 4 years and the DOJ has not held them accountable.   Barr, Wray, Durham, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, &amp; Lynch all belong in prison.   @agbillbarr
1337741584687828993 2020-12-12 20:50:22 +0800 <morrismd1918> Apparently AG Bill Barr was getting Chiese pussy too.
1337741385470971904 2020-12-12 20:49:34 +0800 <morrismd1918> Why haven't the results of the Antrim County Dominion voting machine forensic audit been made public?   Because AG Nessel and a Dem judge have sealed them.   You can be damn sure that if the machine was clean, the results would have been released.
1337631031759933442 2020-12-12 13:31:04 +0800 <morrismd1918> There wouldn't have been police shootings, or millions of illegal aliens, or riots in Dem cities, or Spygate, or the impeachment, or sanctuary cities, or gun violence or a fraudulent election................if we had simply enforced the rule of law.
1337612651866808321 2020-12-12 12:18:02 +0800 <morrismd1918> I'm a Trump supporter and he accomplished more than any president in modern history.   His fatal flaw however was his failure to put in place a DOJ that fairly investigated and enforced the rule of law.  @realDonaldTrump .
1337610715113410562 2020-12-12 12:10:20 +0800 <morrismd1918> My take away from the numerous court rulings regarding the election:  Elections are just window dressing. Individual states can just make shit up, certify it,  and put all their votes behind their candidate of choice.
1337608686198460416 2020-12-12 12:02:17 +0800 <morrismd1918> All year I felt sorry 4 the millions that lost jobs, had their children's education ruined, &amp; their neighborhoods destroyed by lawlessness.   Tonight I had an epiphany. Elections have consequences. The voters elected these socialists &amp; deserve everything that's happened to them.
1337568406598512641 2020-12-12 09:22:13 +0800 <morrismd1918> @ChrisRaiola13 In theory, the DOJ should investigate and enforce the law upon the states.   The DOJ reports to the president. If the DOJ fails to perform its assigned duties then some would suggest that the President should burn it down.
1337565309872582656 2020-12-12 09:09:55 +0800 <morrismd1918> Each state is responsible for holding free &amp; fair elections in compliance w/ state and federal law &amp; certifying that the results are accurate.    The DOJ is responsible for investigating federal crimes and enforcing federal law.   When R the States and DOJ going to do their jobs?
1337561474022170624 2020-12-12 08:54:40 +0800 <morrismd1918> @ChrisRaiola13 Regardless of the actions of State Law Enforcement, State Legislators need to appoint electors that will vote for the true winner of the election.
1337555641431433220 2020-12-12 08:31:30 +0800 <morrismd1918> The message from the SCOTUS:  1. Election fraud is a criminal issue, not a SCOTUS issue.  2. If State Legislators believe that there was election fraud, then they need to do their job, stop election certifications &amp; appoint electors that will vote for the true election winner.
1337537989568843776 2020-12-12 07:21:21 +0800 <morrismd1918> @redheart @FBI @TheJusticeDept Exactly.
1337531432504274946 2020-12-12 06:55:18 +0800 <morrismd1918> It was common knowledge that the 2020 election was ripe for fraud with a huge increase in mail-in voting.  Why weren't FBI special agents in every major city in battleground states to look for fraud?   If they can't do this one simple task, fire them all, every last one of them.

1336875685391032322 2020-12-10 11:29:36 +0800 <morrismd1918> A good attorney general would know that Michigan failed to follow the law.
1336873291068420103 2020-12-10 11:20:05 +0800 <morrismd1918> You allowed these jackwagons to be put in office, you own it.
1336862955690975237 2020-12-10 10:39:01 +0800 <morrismd1918> It's actually pretty simple. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin &amp; Georgia changed election rules without legal authorization.   That's against the law. Their failure to follow the law probably changed the outcome of the election.
1336807227244621829 2020-12-10 06:57:34 +0800 <morrismd1918> What we need are some wealthy conservative people or businesses to offer rewards of $millions for documented evidence of election fraud leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators.   What do you say, can some of you deep pocket folks help save the Republic?
1336738677477826562 2020-12-10 02:25:10 +0800 <morrismd1918> Michelle Obama - Did you say Man-Date?
1336735719285518339 2020-12-10 02:13:25 +0800 <morrismd1918> Then there is that pesky little 10th amendment:  "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people"

1336698301413007361 2020-12-09 23:44:44 +0800 <morrismd1918> @HGiamarco @ProfMJCleveland So, it's okay to break the law with a fraudulent election but it's not ok to break the law and have electors vote their conscience?
1336672673989079040 2020-12-09 22:02:54 +0800 <morrismd1918> This isn't a court issue - It's a law enforcement issue.
1336672313920675843 2020-12-09 22:01:28 +0800 <morrismd1918> It looks like Massachusetts and Virginia were in the game as well.

1335977970272509953 2020-12-08 00:02:24 +0800 <morrismd1918> Who really ran the election heist?   The Dems R too stupid. They botched the '16 election, sex scandals, a dossier, a Spec Prosec., an impeachment, &amp; they ran a demented old fool 4 POTUS.   Do U really think that they could lead a multi-state operation w/ hundreds of people?
1335951280230043649 2020-12-07 22:16:20 +0800 <morrismd1918> The CIA knows Dominion voting systems have been used in multiple countries to change elections yet they allow them to be used in the US.   Blatant election fraud was committed in at least 6 states &amp; in the USPS yet the FBI did nothing. If they didn't know, they are incompetent.
1335943892546560000 2020-12-07 21:46:59 +0800 <morrismd1918> A huge portion of the CIA budget is allocated to propaganda.   The MSM spreads fake news, disparages Trump, and doesn't cover negative stories about high-level Dems because the CIA tells them to.

1335935611216273417 2020-12-07 21:14:04 +0800 <morrismd1918> The CIA couldn't allow Trump to stay in office because he might reveal that they put Obama in office using a rigged election.   Prove me wrong.

1335933574772645889 2020-12-07 21:05:59 +0800 <morrismd1918> The CIA knows full well that Dominion voting machines and software are used around the world to rig elections.   Why do they allow them to be used in the United States?

1335885631176716288 2020-12-07 17:55:28 +0800 <morrismd1918> I spent a couple of weeks in The ICU in 2015. They had to make room for me because it was full. Hospitals keep the ICU close to capacity because that is where they can provide the best care (and where they make the most money)

1335086641342537730 2020-12-05 13:00:34 +0800 <morrismd1918> Dominion systems can be used 2 reduce votes for Trump in a county where he was expected to win &amp; then give those votes to Biden in counties where he is expected to win. No counties get flipped but votes get moved.   BTW, do U know where the 47 unaccounted for USB drives might B?

1332737348556165123 2020-11-29 01:25:19 +0800 <morrismd1918> Pull the wool off your eyes. The packages sent to the Senate by the House are packed with pork taking care of rich Dem supporters.
1332736683092094976 2020-11-29 01:22:40 +0800 <morrismd1918> It's pretty simple really. The Dems want 100% credit for the next stimulus package along with the ability to stuff it with pork. .
1332736082463649794 2020-11-29 01:20:17 +0800 <morrismd1918> Persons of interest are questioned in criminal investigations. This almost always leads to incriminating evidence.   So why is Trump's legal team expected to prove fraud w/o  questioning election workers?   They have enough evidence to get the FBI involved but it hasn't happened.
1332722679464538112 2020-11-29 00:27:02 +0800 <morrismd1918> The mandatory school shutdowns are dramatically increasing the educational disparity between different socioeconomic groups. It will be irrecoverable.

1332512750459891712 2020-11-28 10:32:51 +0800 <morrismd1918> I have a dumb question:  How are Secretaries of State legally allowed to certify election results when the numbers don't add up?

1332496408629403650 2020-11-28 09:27:55 +0800 <morrismd1918> Why is it that Law Enforcement has time and resources to arrest people for not wearing masks, opening their restaurants, or at religious gatherings but they don't have the time to investigate massive and blatant election fraud?

1332435569402540032 2020-11-28 05:26:09 +0800 <morrismd1918> @dollysaysno The problem is that if no double votes are ever investigated, bad actors will continue to fraudulently vote with impunity
1332402333087653889 2020-11-28 03:14:05 +0800 <morrismd1918> So why doesn't Law Enforcement arrest these double voters?
1332334434373267460 2020-11-27 22:44:17 +0800 <morrismd1918> Lin Wood and Sydney Powell are doing a tremendous job identifying voter fraud in Michigan and Georgia.   The elephant in the room however is "Where's Law Enforcement"? There are hundreds of depositions documenting felony voter fraud but no arrests and no questioning?

1332327823512625153 2020-11-27 22:18:01 +0800 <morrismd1918> Donald Trump beat both Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden despite massive election fraud because the Democrats vastly underestimated his popularity.   Dems  0-2
1332166404259405824 2020-11-27 11:36:35 +0800 <morrismd1918> If I'm not mistaken, Trump's pardon of General Flynn remove's Flynn's gag order.     After Flynn tells Durham what he knows, he should publically reveal the truth about Obama and the deep state. To quote Sydney Powell, "It will be biblical".   @GenFlynn
1332161979713286144 2020-11-27 11:19:00 +0800 <morrismd1918> Why doesn't the US simply require voting in person with a photo ID?   Oh wait...............

1330501234797797376 2020-11-22 21:19:48 +0800 <morrismd1918> 1) If you think COVID lockdowns are about public safety, you are naive.  The purpose is to destroy the economy, put millions out of work to make them dependent on the government. People will demand universal income, free health care, &amp; subsidized rent.
1330501094015971337 2020-11-22 21:19:14 +0800 <morrismd1918> 2) The Government will pass out trillions of dollars and fund the spending by doubling taxes &amp; defunding the military.   Voila, the US becomes socialist and the NWO wins.

1328479805705170950 2020-11-17 07:27:22 +0800 <morrismd1918> @MichaelSalla @realDonaldTrump   Mr.President - Is it time yet to declassify the JFK assassination information that you kept locked up for another 20 years?
1328478406439268360 2020-11-17 07:21:48 +0800 <morrismd1918> @MichaelSalla Is this why it was the US Military that seized the servers from the secret CIA spy center in  Germany?
1328477106322481154 2020-11-17 07:16:38 +0800 <morrismd1918> @DavidJBuckwalt2 @MichaelSalla Do you mean like the irrefutable evidence of Russian collusion that Schiff said that he had?
1328476632361922563 2020-11-17 07:14:45 +0800 <morrismd1918> @MichaelSalla I have to see more evidence on this one.

1328440293834825728 2020-11-17 04:50:21 +0800 <morrismd1918> What's Chuckie saying?  They have irrefutable evidence of Trump collusion with Russia?
1328438450551451651 2020-11-17 04:43:02 +0800 <morrismd1918> So when is the Gen. Michael Flynn case going to be dropped?
1328432715654434824 2020-11-17 04:20:15 +0800 <morrismd1918> How much money can we raise if we impose an excise tax on skateboards, knit hats, and black backpacks?
1328432368491896833 2020-11-17 04:18:52 +0800 <morrismd1918> So Biden can spend $1T to cancel student debt but Trump couldn't reallocate $25B for the wall?
1328429545674977280 2020-11-17 04:07:39 +0800 <morrismd1918> @AuntCinnamon @tonydasit1 Here's a ball buster, will that work?  https://t.co/YE1Vsnkx3G
1328425211646054400 2020-11-17 03:50:26 +0800 <morrismd1918> Outstanding student debt in the US is $1.6T.  Forgiving this debt will cost each and every man, woman, and child in the US about $5k  Only half of these folks actually pay taxes, so this student debt forgiveness will cost the actual taxpayers $10k each.   Are you ready for this?
1328422246789079051 2020-11-17 03:38:39 +0800 <morrismd1918> Socialism - a political/economic system that is so good that you have to force people to accept it.
1328419391797665792 2020-11-17 03:27:18 +0800 <morrismd1918> Yup, Law Enforcement was arresting Jews in NY for no masks and private meetings above the limit while the Biden supported frolicked in the streets w/o masks.
1328418628736344073 2020-11-17 03:24:16 +0800 <morrismd1918> The public needs a forensic review of the California election.  The GOP can flip the house red if this is investigated and resolved.
1328416228076105728 2020-11-17 03:14:44 +0800 <morrismd1918> Question:   Why is Law Enforcement not investigating the election fraud? Aren't these crimes felonies
1328409751101845506 2020-11-17 02:48:59 +0800 <morrismd1918> If I understand Biden's tuition forgiveness proposal, my reward for skrimping, saving, and sacrificing to pay for my kids' tuition will be higher taxes to pay for somebody else's kids' tuition.
1328383460382273536 2020-11-17 01:04:31 +0800 <morrismd1918> Only 35% of high school graduates are proficient in math and reading. I'll support taxpayer-funded university education after the Dems get HS proficiency above 85%.   I won't hold my breath.
1328381411074695169 2020-11-17 00:56:23 +0800 <morrismd1918> Regardless of the outcome, who will identify, investigate, and prosecute the election fraudsters? It's pretty clear that there was significant fraud taking place in multiple states.   The FBI is too dirty to do the job.
1328379053657743360 2020-11-17 00:47:01 +0800 <morrismd1918> @13thethe @PoliticalIntent @FoxNews So I guess that if you separate 700,00 ballots from their envelopes thereby eliminating the ability to check their validity,  then the votes count?   You can be sure that is exactly why Pennsylvania did this.

1327620814318022657 2020-11-14 22:34:02 +0800 <morrismd1918> Biden won the election fair and square.   Some teachers and students told me so, it must be true.
1327619696439521280 2020-11-14 22:29:36 +0800 <morrismd1918> Since election personnel are employees of the cities and states, their emails, texts, and phone calls on government phones are public property.  Why don't we have a little look-see?
1327618765622743050 2020-11-14 22:25:54 +0800 <morrismd1918> If ballots can't be verified as legal after they have been separated from their envelopes, chow can the Secretary of Stare certify election accuracy?
1327609925930000384 2020-11-14 21:50:46 +0800 <morrismd1918> Biden didn't do this, he can't even remember all of the words in a sentence.

1327596813654888451 2020-11-14 20:58:40 +0800 <morrismd1918> If masks work, why were election observers forced to stand 6 feet or more away from the poll workers?

1327580059176226816 2020-11-14 19:52:06 +0800 <morrismd1918> The DOJ should name a Special Prosecutor to investigate election fraud. The government can then pay for the work rather than Trump donors.    As a special bonus, Biden would have to fire the SP and take the political heat.

1325039122541670400 2020-11-07 19:35:19 +0800 <morrismd1918> Rudy - We desperately need you to bring the DNC to its knees just like you did with the mob.

1324833827261456392 2020-11-07 05:59:33 +0800 <morrismd1918> If Trump had easily won the election, all we would get is more pissing, moaning, rioting, &amp;TDS.  But, what if Trump planned 2 lose but capture numerous cases of widespread voting fraud? He could win in court &amp; get a mandate for voter ID as well as accurate &amp; fair election systems
1324830974031597572 2020-11-07 05:48:13 +0800 <morrismd1918> @KamVTV @RoxSki777 You're racist !
1324796308021006337 2020-11-07 03:30:28 +0800 <morrismd1918> You forgot about voter suppression via censoring or refusing to report news on Twitter, Facebook, Google, and MSM.
1324785834722283520 2020-11-07 02:48:50 +0800 <morrismd1918> The only thing that I feel good about right now is that after Trump is out of office he will have infinite freedom to do what he wants and he has $millions to do it.   He can ruin Biden, Pelosi, Comey, Brennan, and Clinton et. al. through the courts. Don the Bounty Hunter.
1324780414263844866 2020-11-07 02:27:18 +0800 <morrismd1918> The piece that's missing for me how Trump's team planned to fight election fraud.  Knowing Trump, I cannot believe that he simply planned to react after the fact via the courts.   I certainly hope that they have something up their sleeve.

1324752690317021184 2020-11-07 00:37:08 +0800 <morrismd1918> Pennsylvania did not match ballot signatures to registration signatures.   Mail-in ballots w/o postmarks or illegible postmarks were also counted.   This being the case, how can the PA Secretary of State certify the election results to be true and accurate?

1324432724585828352 2020-11-06 03:25:42 +0800 <morrismd1918> Did the FBI plant moles at any election centers?    Did they use mail-in ballots w/ tracking capability?   Did they interview any of the thousands of election workers to determine if they observed fraud?   No processes were used to detect election fraud?   The FBI is in on it.
1324370713994792961 2020-11-05 23:19:18 +0800 <morrismd1918> Dem officials don't arrest looters, rioters, or arsonist, why would they arrest poll workers?  https://t.co/O18C83gVUl
1324341711447953410 2020-11-05 21:24:03 +0800 <morrismd1918> Trump will lose because the Democrats cheated.   Cheaters will run the USA.
1324084358731517952 2020-11-05 04:21:26 +0800 <morrismd1918> Why do I get a nauseating feeling that the Intelligence Community took Trump out (just like they did Kennedy) to prevent Trump from exposing them?
1324083785286275072 2020-11-05 04:19:09 +0800 <morrismd1918> Sooo, the startegy is to cheat, and if you get caught say that you're sorry?
1324079085564342272 2020-11-05 04:00:28 +0800 <morrismd1918> They should have fixed Immigration law too. The Dems had Paul Ryan in their pocket.
1324044305393164295 2020-11-05 01:42:16 +0800 <morrismd1918> And this my friends is why Barr and Durham needed to issue indictments before the election.

Comey, Wray, Kerry, Lynch, Rice, Yates, Rosenstein, Clapper, McCabe, Brennan, and Obama are all guilty of Obstruction of Justice for covering up the spying.

1322960753360572420 2020-11-02 01:56:37 +0800 <morrismd1918> Trump was an unknown in '16 yet he squeaked out a win. He's delivered big time on the economy &amp; peace. I know of no one that previously voted for Trump that is flipping to Blue.   How is it that the pollsters show Trump getting lower percentages than in '16? It makes no sense.  https://t.co/IjFtaVsOmJ

1322530559759929345 2020-10-31 21:27:11 +0800 <morrismd1918> It's well established that the DOJ, FBI, and CIA spied on Trump's campaign in 2016.   What makes anyone believe that they are not still spying on him in 2020?
1322529975837351938 2020-10-31 21:24:52 +0800 <morrismd1918> The FBI doesn't need to investigate Biden. They know full well that he is corrupt and taking money from multiple countries.  There planned to use that information to get whatever they wanted from him.

1322133859471892481 2020-10-30 19:10:50 +0800 <morrismd1918> It would be unacceptable if the FBI spied on Keith Ellison and caught him collaborating with groups planning post-election insurrection.

Now in 2020, the DS supports Biden but Biden does not have the attributes of Obama.  Biden will lose.

What other info (not on the laptop), does the FBI have about Hunter/Joe that they are withholding?   The FBI is interfering w/ yet another election

1317058577194954754 2020-10-16 19:03:29 +0800 <morrismd1918> Wray is gone as soon as Trump’s victory is announced.

1316418078004195333 2020-10-15 00:38:22 +0800 <morrismd1918> I'm confused - In Cali it's ok to send unregistered "ballot harvesters" door-to-door to collect ballots but it's not ok to have collection boxes?

1314911861087907840 2020-10-10 20:53:12 +0800 <morrismd1918> Think of it this way -   If 214k fat people died, did they die from being fat, or did being fat simply contribute to their death?

1314906948496699393 2020-10-10 20:33:40 +0800 <morrismd1918> I have an idea - Let's require all of the states that are promoting mail-in balloting to mail their results to the RNC for counting.
1314904894306951170 2020-10-10 20:25:31 +0800 <morrismd1918> We must stop oil fracking now.   The million workers in oil, trucking, steel, &amp; construction that support fracking should be able to get minimum wage jobs.   Just buy oil from the Middle East again.

The fact that 2016 was an election year had nothing to do with the failure to approve Merrick Garland for the SCOTUS.   It had everything to do w/the fact that the GOP controlled the Senate &amp; used existing parliamentary procedure to block his appointment

It was their right because Republicans had a majority. They now have the right to vote on Trump's nominee. Tough shit.

1304127538847981569 2020-09-11 02:40:09 +0800 <morrismd1918> Yes, your Covid leadership. You led the nation in Covid deaths by sending infected patients to nursing homes filled with vulnerable elderlies. This move made $millions for your big donors in the nursing home industry.

1304083736296857600 2020-09-10 23:46:06 +0800 <morrismd1918> Why should the Federal government that is $26T in debt bailout California that is $0.56T in debt?   California has the 5th largest economy in the world. Raise taxes or cut service to pay your own damn bills.    https://t.co/HVjiQXYP4a
1304079891667849217 2020-09-10 23:30:49 +0800 <morrismd1918> Is there any evidence that the west coast fires are being set by anarchists like happened in Australia?  I'm guessing that Lib government officials and the MSM would cover it up.

1302950537843875840 2020-09-07 20:43:10 +0800 <morrismd1918> This is the direct result of liberal politicians refusing to allow power plants and electrical infrastructure to be built in California.   Gasoline shortages are on their way.

It took the staff four minutes to take my temperature, go through the COVID checklist, give me a mask, and enter my birthdate.  Manufactured COVID panic is making people stupid.

1300919481011769344 2020-09-02 06:12:28 +0800 <morrismd1918> I have an idea - Let's print up 10M red ballots and mail them to everybody 35 and above in FL, MI, WI, MN, &amp; NC.   When the DEMs scream voter fraud, we just say ok and then cancel mail-in voting everywhere.
