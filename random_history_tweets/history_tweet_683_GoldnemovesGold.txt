1317439227332861954 2020-10-17 20:16:03 +0800 <GoldnemovesGold> @JonahDispatch Joe Biden could’ve avoided all of this but he chose to run for president and therefore risking that he and his sons corruption and his sons drug abuse would come out. The sad part is that Biden really didn’t care he is greedy and just wanted more!

1317434273637556224 2020-10-17 19:56:22 +0800 <GoldnemovesGold> @JonahDispatch Joe Biden is really poor judgment, his abuse of power, his extortion, I his national security issue is all way too disturbing for him to be President. In fact I think most sensible people would argue why he even ran for President.
1317433709847547905 2020-10-17 19:54:07 +0800 <GoldnemovesGold> @JonahDispatch Hunter Biden’s drug addiction shows his father may have had compassion, but also extremely poor judgment to send his son to foreign countries to broker deals that were contrary to the US interests. The Biden’s became rich on this.

1317430479742750722 2020-10-17 19:41:17 +0800 <GoldnemovesGold> @NoThatKaren @PissedOffLawyer @JonahDispatch 1st the HunterBiden abuse of power for access &amp; influence to JoeBiden is absolutely true! 2nd don’t be such a hypocrite,Democrats have smeared Trump for years on anything they can find. 3rd Hunter’s drug problem became nationalnews during Obama when he was kicked out of the Navy
1317428910683029505 2020-10-17 19:35:03 +0800 <GoldnemovesGold> @infocollector @PissedOffLawyer @JonahDispatch It’s not the fact that HunterBiden is a drug addict it’s that JoeBiden used his son in an abuse of power scheme to rake in millions &amp; billions of dollars from China,Russia,Ukraine. Forget about the drug issue that’s not the real problem it’s the Abuse of power, access &amp; influence

1313874447925993473 2020-10-08 00:10:53 +0800 <GoldnemovesGold> @polo5 @JohnJamesMI If you think Trump killed 200,000 people from Covid then you agree that Obama/Biden killed 307,000 veterans who committed suicide waiting for medical help they never received. Also many people died from H1N1 we will never know the true # since testing was shutdown by Biden.
