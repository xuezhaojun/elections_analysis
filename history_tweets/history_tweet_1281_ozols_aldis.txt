1344069505853452289 2020-12-30 07:55:16 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Havenaar64 The first car to break 100 mph (in the 1920s I think) had a four cylinder engine that ran at 1000 rpm, if I recall correctly.  It was about 8 or 9 litres in capacity and had massive torque.
1344067120368271360 2020-12-30 07:45:47 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Havenaar64 A bit more than 1000 rpm. :)
1344065618090184704 2020-12-30 07:39:49 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Something something counting votes.
1344063381263720448 2020-12-30 07:30:56 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Havenaar64 That's rather cryptic.
1344062716076421120 2020-12-30 07:28:17 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Interesting how counties that used to lack strong common interests (India and Vietnam) or were even once at war (Vietnam or Japan vs USA) are being brought together by China.

1343732530785087488 2020-12-29 09:36:15 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Talk_To_The_Hat I was just thinking about Elizabeth I a few minutes ago, in the context of "women have always been oppressed by men".

1343533882843353094 2020-12-28 20:26:53 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @EllenOfYork @OMGTheMess Actually I'm a New South Welshman.  I have relatives in Victoria. The state seems to have gone downhill.
1343423595339366400 2020-12-28 13:08:39 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess @energyturtled I wonder what a big police conspiracy would be like.  Sparing some criminals who keep the other crims in line? Or making donuts and coffee appear at mysterious places?
1343420702909591554 2020-12-28 12:57:09 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess @energyturtled That's in my pessimistic world.  All things can  be used for good or evil.
1343416335863201794 2020-12-28 12:39:48 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess I was thinking of it as a Neighbourhood Watch thing, where the neighbours and police keep an eye on your home while you're away.
1343415681841184768 2020-12-28 12:37:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess In my optimistic world, Absence from Residence means the neighbours and police keep an eye on your home while you're away. To protect it.
1343415151442030594 2020-12-28 12:35:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess No, what I meant was a state where police prevent crime, arrest criminals, protect the public, save lives, that sort of thing.  Police cars have cameras that read rego plates now. One day they might have cameras that look for crooks.
1343413482864009217 2020-12-28 12:28:28 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess Actually could be a good idea in a state where police do police work.  If a patrol car sees people moving stuff in an absent residence, the cops know something's up.
1343410992470925314 2020-12-28 12:18:34 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @jnsqxelle @Talk_To_The_Hat GTA is a game in which you play a criminal/gangster.  How to get into GTA jail? Aside from being caught by police, maybe by not being a gangster?
1343407790727970818 2020-12-28 12:05:51 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Doesn't pass my smell test.  A computer tech would know what 5G is. It's just the latest cellular data network.  Also, the photos show debris scattered outwards from the building - suggesting the bomb was inside it, not in the RV.

1343404624787636224 2020-12-28 11:53:16 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Africans seem to vary widely, partly as a function of geography.  People from some parts of Africa are polite and intelligent. Others are tribal and violent.  All of our immigration should be selective - not by race, but by behaviour.

1343373574246035456 2020-12-28 09:49:53 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I was wondering why his tweets have so many replies from people who hate him.

Ideally I'd like some sort of Internet-mediated direct democracy, but society is a long way from that. Parliament is the worst system except for all the others that have been tried.
1343347809706119170 2020-12-28 08:07:30 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @SpiritedSheila @catedempsey @DavidLeyonhjelm I don't disagree.  I thought of members (professionally) as means to an end. I had genuine feelings for them, of course, being human.   Honesty and trust are important in really effective negotiation, as well as mutual alignment of self-interests.
1343347024532402177 2020-12-28 08:04:23 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catedempsey @SpiritedSheila @DavidLeyonhjelm Yes. My MP was a bit miffed that I wouldn't write speeches for him. I thought the other stuff was more important.  However, legislation, numbers and votes are real functions in the Chamber, and have real consequences outside.
1343346554959065088 2020-12-28 08:02:31 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catedempsey @SpiritedSheila @DavidLeyonhjelm True. I was a political advisor/negotiator/tactician/general helper. Part of my job included looking up weird old regulations and precedents, and putting them to use.  The public stuff is mostly for show, IMHO. Much of the real power play happens offstage.
1343344937119596544 2020-12-28 07:56:05 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catedempsey @SpiritedSheila @DavidLeyonhjelm They may not be necessary, but they serve to give a sense of dramatic weightiness to the proceedings, which the participants hopefully feel.  Being an MP is a heavy responsibility, even if all too few of them take it seriously.
1343344400215072768 2020-12-28 07:53:57 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catedempsey @SpiritedSheila @DavidLeyonhjelm I've worked in Parliament. A lot of that stuff is traditional remainders of the millennium-long path toward British democracy.  Th weird clothes, multiple readings of Bills, and officials like the Usher of the Black Rod have interesting histories. /1

1343003117260959744 2020-12-27 09:17:49 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Talk_To_The_Hat Your conversation is very fruitful.
1343002967562014721 2020-12-27 09:17:13 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Talk_To_The_Hat Then I try to see if there are alternative possible valid statements.  It's not always an either/or thing. For the movie/book theory, I think both our statements can apply in different  cases, or maybe even at the same time.
1343002304132362240 2020-12-27 09:14:35 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Talk_To_The_Hat I like these statements you make. I use them as starting points for my own thoughts. I don't necessarily think they're wrong.  First I try to see if I can come up with a counterpoint or if your assertion holds up. A test of validity or strength.  /1
1342988103426830336 2020-12-27 08:18:10 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Talk_To_The_Hat Though also to be considered is the fact that a book has space for much more detail, and even large parts that are left out of the movie altogether. So a book can have much more of what made the movie good - and lasts longer than two hours.
1342982208810729472 2020-12-27 07:54:44 +0800 <ozols_aldis> That, and the fact that the NSW government and the medical workers have been very successful.  This means that most people freely cooperate with the reasonable rules laid down by the government, and are confident.  They know that Parramatta is pretty safe.

How many pickup trucks could you fit in a square kilometre?  Now imagine how many you could fit in a *cubic* kilometre.  Then multiply that by millions of millions. That's near space.

1339725596436307969 2020-12-18 08:14:07 +0800 <ozols_aldis> That's the original way of making a vaccine.  If it worked for every virus, we'd probably have a vaccine for AIDS already.  Maybe that method doesn't work for Covid.
1339384227792490498 2020-12-17 09:37:39 +0800 <ozols_aldis> This morning I saw a headline on the TV: "Breaking News - Zero new cases in Victoria".
1339379359677775873 2020-12-17 09:18:18 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @elisdee_one @PeterWallaceAU Good point. I should have said "external reality" or something similar.  The idea is that many people take these things for granted, not realising how historically rare they are, and how difficult they were to gain.

1339112711712432129 2020-12-16 15:38:44 +0800 <ozols_aldis> China wants to be the world's Number One.  Australia has a thirty-year trade with China, supplying it with iron ore, meat, milk, rice, and other primary products. China demands that Australia stop calling for an international inquiry into COVID-19.

1339028462271483904 2020-12-16 10:03:58 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Most people live in cities where starvation, violent death, disease and predators are insignificant problems, and food, shelter and medical care are guaranteed.  This sheltered environment makes it easy to lose contact with reality, and to believe nonsense.
1339009670409715712 2020-12-16 08:49:17 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @NatLantica It's probably near the Pencil Shavings Museum, up the road from the Broken Pencil Leads Museum.
1339008926126276608 2020-12-16 08:46:20 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @NatLantica TIL there is a Pencil Sharpener Museum.  Where is the Eraser Museum?

1338663235025702912 2020-12-15 09:52:41 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Great. Next there will be a Native American National Anthem, an Asian-American National Anthem ...

1338281609963872261 2020-12-14 08:36:14 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @kali_thKitty Yes.  Though it doesn't preclude being friends as well.
1338265130585346048 2020-12-14 07:30:45 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Covid can kill, but it's far less deadly than bubonic plague or Spanish Flu.  The preventive measures such as lockdowns and social isolation are effective against influenza, which usually kills more people. So total death rates could well be lower than before.
1338046562820243456 2020-12-13 17:02:14 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Maybe we could terraform a nearby region and send our criminals there ...

That aside, the important issue is that vote counting algorithms should *never* be secret. That just asks for cheating.  Hand counting with supervision from all candidates' teams is the way to go.
1336100494133981187 2020-12-08 08:09:16 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Satirical, but sin credits remind me of Papal Indulgences in medieval times. You could buy forgiveness for a sin by paying a small amount of money to the Church.  Selling these was the profession of the Pardoner in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

1332993003389009921 2020-11-29 18:21:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @ellymelly They are treating our soldiers badly by stripping whole units of their honours, for alleged crimes by a few.

About twenty, I was on a building site without a helmet when someone dropped a 4" x 4" hardwood beam on my head.  Luckily I have a thick skull.

1332618029004247041 2020-11-28 17:31:11 +0800 <ozols_aldis> If Trum wins, America will see cognitive dissonance on a scale previously unknown.  Low information lefties will believe Trump seized power illegally, and consider him effectively a dictator.
1332615568008966144 2020-11-28 17:21:24 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @ja_jacois @HearGene I recall a news item about Queensland buying Chinese software for electoral systems.

1332614511442857985 2020-11-28 17:17:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @theage Exactly.  I think someone tweeted that a similar thing happened in the Gore vs Bush election. I'm too lazy to look it up in this heat. :)
1332613776479117313 2020-11-28 17:14:17 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @nudder12 @Bradjstone80 In fact, the court ruling that the ABC calls a "setback" is the actual trigger for a Supreme Court ruling. It's not a setback at all, because the SCOTUS has a conservative majority.
1332613333887770627 2020-11-28 17:12:32 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @nudder12 @Bradjstone80 If the states don't come to a resolution, I believe it will go to the Supreme Court.
1332613008183332864 2020-11-28 17:11:14 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catherine___c I remember days that felt hotter more than fifty years ago.  Also, the sky above Sydney turning red with smoke from bushfires.  Climate change may be happening, but Australia's climate hasn't changed so I can notice in sixty years.

When I arrived home, I found my cats sitting in a semicircle around the snake, just staring at it. They were city cats, so they'd never seen one.  I don't know what they would have done to the spider because I put it straight out again.

1332427235517632512 2020-11-28 04:53:02 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I'm having deja vu. Just prior to the Pacific War Australia was selling pig iron to Japan.
1332425110800646144 2020-11-28 04:44:36 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Blaming the victim. This has been the Chinese Communist Party's chosen conflict all along.
1332421983695372288 2020-11-28 04:32:10 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Too late. That political banning gave Trump the opportunity to demand repeal of Section 230.
1332124992910229505 2020-11-27 08:52:02 +0800 <ozols_aldis> How nice of Twitter to tell us which sites are the best, by trying to block them!

1331397658204803074 2020-11-25 08:41:52 +0800 <ozols_aldis> So Twitter disputes this, implying it thinks Americans will roll over for election fraud?

1331175252324360193 2020-11-24 17:58:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Nevertheless, we can begin seeking export markets elsewhere, and building up domestic industries.

1330742138015870978 2020-11-23 13:17:04 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I was almost eight years old when 2001: A Space Odyssey came out, but I still remember the movie.   Apparently a fan has placed a version of the monolith in the desert in Utah, where it was just discovered by a helicopter pilot.

1330693173845270528 2020-11-23 10:02:30 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catturd2 I'm in the club. I made a joke about a marketing slogan, and now I'm a fascist apparently.
1330692900225576960 2020-11-23 10:01:25 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I'm not a fascist. I just thought it was a funny phrase. This was the tweet I replied to:  The Act @Adonistheact  The coffee of fascism @smcroasters. Thanks for indicating your fascist views. We will flush you out one by one.
1330692398901460992 2020-11-23 09:59:25 +0800 <ozols_aldis> That was a joke, based on a phrase in the tweet I was replying to.
1330676205603831808 2020-11-23 08:55:04 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @smcroasters That's a cool advertising slogan. "The coffee of fascism".
1330651778166099969 2020-11-23 07:18:00 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @XiranJayZhao Yeah, but English people don't have 26,000 relatives.
1330651543142494209 2020-11-23 07:17:04 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I love the fact that Twitter put a warning on this.
1330478566413393925 2020-11-22 19:49:43 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Their ABC won't do that.   But the Internet will.

1330457114062565377 2020-11-22 18:24:29 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess That's also possible.  But the universe has a weird way of creating newer, more complex forms out of the destruction of older ones.
1330455665739923463 2020-11-22 18:18:44 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @OMGTheMess That's a really interesting question, because although history repeats, there are big differences this time around.

1330031431096168449 2020-11-21 14:12:58 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @_rebase @stillgray I must be a fascist because I don't like seeing businesses smashed, burned and looted.
1330030710099496960 2020-11-21 14:10:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Businesses are fascist? How?
1330030137686044672 2020-11-21 14:07:50 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @badluck_jones I kneaded that!
1329922317049233409 2020-11-21 06:59:23 +0800 <ozols_aldis> How do you get inhalation wrong? There's only one direction to breathe in.
1329920158052143106 2020-11-21 06:50:49 +0800 <ozols_aldis> 1,000,000 bank robbers can't be wrong!
1329586408625901569 2020-11-20 08:44:36 +0800 <ozols_aldis> The same people who made the media the deciders of the US election campaign.
1329584619470028801 2020-11-20 08:37:30 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @KilldozerSZN The Right wants to take away your money!

1329523432195641344 2020-11-20 04:34:22 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Yet Biden's tweets don't get a warning that his claim to be President-Elect is disputed.
1329479494059495425 2020-11-20 01:39:46 +0800 <ozols_aldis> This racist nonsense implies a low view of black people.,

1329198443470884867 2020-11-19 07:02:58 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile Official Sources warn that this is probably true.

1328968841766977536 2020-11-18 15:50:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Everyone must self-isolate and wear a mask at all times.
1328958102490796033 2020-11-18 15:07:57 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Is it just me, or have there been more of these busts lately?
1328927867770527745 2020-11-18 13:07:48 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Shouldn't the law enforcement authorities go after those who made the threats?
1328897268104134657 2020-11-18 11:06:13 +0800 <ozols_aldis> What happened to the police?
1328897148163788801 2020-11-18 11:05:44 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Isn't that illegal? Maybe the police should be told.
1328884073532588034 2020-11-18 10:13:47 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Isn't threatening people a crime? Time to charge them.
1328608422703497221 2020-11-17 15:58:26 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's easy. If it comes from the ABC, it's fake news.

1328477893945552896 2020-11-17 07:19:46 +0800 <ozols_aldis> The leftists don't want racism to die. They want to keep using it as an excuse for anything they want to do.
1328304117370867712 2020-11-16 19:49:14 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Soon it will be required of electricians that they perform an earthing ceremony when installing power lines.

1328280717264994304 2020-11-16 18:16:15 +0800 <ozols_aldis> The smartest children will grow up and search history on the Internet. They should then tell the others
1328278438516387841 2020-11-16 18:07:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Why wasn't Australia invited?
1328277158159028224 2020-11-16 18:02:07 +0800 <ozols_aldis> All votes should be counted by hand, with observers present.  This is not difficult or expensive at all.
1328274675663704065 2020-11-16 17:52:15 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I hope no one was hurt.
1328272864273854467 2020-11-16 17:45:03 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @badluck_jones We should do what we can to help others.
1328258031604310017 2020-11-16 16:46:07 +0800 <ozols_aldis> But the sun still shines.
1328177814550450177 2020-11-16 11:27:21 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @Designsage @ItsAboutTime45 What's the movie?
1328151377663598594 2020-11-16 09:42:18 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I'm pretty sure Australia still counts votes by hand.  It's quick and there are scrutineers present from all the parties. I've scrutineered at a count. If our system is the same as it was in the nineties, I trust it.
1328149084092338181 2020-11-16 09:33:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Terrifying - but also exposed by their own words.  Now we know who not to entrust with power.
1328143473300496384 2020-11-16 09:10:54 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile It's a delight!
1328142772558127109 2020-11-16 09:08:07 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Watch to the end.
1328141832874721280 2020-11-16 09:04:23 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile I can only imagine what's in that!
1328133416303226880 2020-11-16 08:30:56 +0800 <ozols_aldis> If he does that, there would be a real civil war. He's already shown that he doesn't want to start any wars. So he's got lawyers in, and he's going to take it to the courts - and the Supreme Court has a Constitutionalist majority.
1327900516534288384 2020-11-15 17:05:28 +0800 <ozols_aldis> There are those who say it's a trap ...
1327846056088899586 2020-11-15 13:29:04 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @nextjenlife @TheRealEnemies Hi!
1327832109872939008 2020-11-15 12:33:39 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Blantifa is the name, fascism is the game!
1327831757559713792 2020-11-15 12:32:15 +0800 <ozols_aldis> We need a name for them.   Blantifa!
1327829884303863808 2020-11-15 12:24:48 +0800 <ozols_aldis> We should have a government based on crowd-sourcing through the Internet.
1327811763769774081 2020-11-15 11:12:48 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @SamanthaX_real I worked for a computer magazine before the Internet ate everything.  We did our own technical testing, but some articles were adapted from American sources.
1327808765865775104 2020-11-15 11:00:53 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Who actually buys fashion magazines? I only see them in doctors' waiting rooms.
1327792770728169472 2020-11-15 09:57:20 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Awesome! Aussies love Trump!

1327775409950265344 2020-11-15 08:48:21 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @broken_rhi That might actually work!
1327772557966077953 2020-11-15 08:37:01 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile She makes the Earthly Court cuter.
1327770713822879744 2020-11-15 08:29:41 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile She will inflict justice upon the world from the afterlife!
1327769541623967744 2020-11-15 08:25:02 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile The Necro Furry Supreme Court Fandom is the worst fandom ever.
1327725394875715584 2020-11-15 05:29:36 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Any software that is not open source and subject to live audit trails cannot be trusted.  Proprietary software is a "secret sauce" of which we are not told the ingredients.
1327721277759447040 2020-11-15 05:13:15 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile I didn't vote because I'm not dead yet.
1327529172407709696 2020-11-14 16:29:53 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I've lost about 40% of my followers in the last week. Either I've been needlessly offensive, or Twitter has done a purge.  You can find me on Parler as AldisOzols.
1327454769418366978 2020-11-14 11:34:14 +0800 <ozols_aldis> What kind of places are they targeting?
1327410555846475776 2020-11-14 08:38:33 +0800 <ozols_aldis> They're all in Heaven.
1327351536305913856 2020-11-14 04:44:01 +0800 <ozols_aldis> If President Trump leaves Facebook and Twitter for the uncensored social media, he would bring many with him.
1327094996256755715 2020-11-13 11:44:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's what they're taught to be.
1327052003252391936 2020-11-13 08:53:47 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's 2020 and the ABC is still lying.
1327049425315713025 2020-11-13 08:43:33 +0800 <ozols_aldis> At last, recognition or our greatest talent!
1327048656147496960 2020-11-13 08:40:29 +0800 <ozols_aldis> They'll just keep doing it without telling the public.
1327025960739237888 2020-11-13 07:10:18 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's not even subtle - it's just heavy handed, in-your-face political favouritism.  It's as if they think it's still going to work even if it's blatantly obvious.
1326990620498411520 2020-11-13 04:49:52 +0800 <ozols_aldis> You should hold an election to determine the President-Elect-Elect.
1326988980944994305 2020-11-13 04:43:21 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Obviously. No dolphin voted for Biden.
1326734852876480512 2020-11-12 11:53:33 +0800 <ozols_aldis> If he was smart he would have.
1326733720737390592 2020-11-12 11:49:03 +0800 <ozols_aldis> We need a vote to determine the President-Elect-Elect!
1326733051708125185 2020-11-12 11:46:23 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Does Antifa give facial expression training to their goons?
1326688017113735168 2020-11-12 08:47:26 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Or retarded.
1326626858385858560 2020-11-12 04:44:25 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's an amazing drama, however it will end.
1326625477914578944 2020-11-12 04:38:56 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Some say that they were. We'll see over the next few weeks.
1326625037109981184 2020-11-12 04:37:11 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I hope you use ink!
1326624762227875840 2020-11-12 04:36:05 +0800 <ozols_aldis> But all the bots voted for Biden!
1326624214992908289 2020-11-12 04:33:54 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Maybe many years of getting away with it made the left complacent?
1326623870405672960 2020-11-12 04:32:32 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It already did.
1326618223987449856 2020-11-12 04:10:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catturd2 I didn't!
1326417707277946880 2020-11-11 14:53:19 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Busted!
1326330737096708097 2020-11-11 09:07:44 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @allthepudding About 10%.
1326321458671333376 2020-11-11 08:30:52 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @MaliaKay5 I've just followed you there, too.  I'm still using Twitter more than Parler, but preparing for the shift at any time!
1326316008110350337 2020-11-11 08:09:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> This is technically true. The trick is to leave out certain facts while presenting other facts.
1326315458564288512 2020-11-11 08:07:01 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I actually prefer it this way. I get the choice of adding a comment, and I don't have to remember to click the right link.
1326314766474772481 2020-11-11 08:04:16 +0800 <ozols_aldis> She'll be right mate. Just put a bit of tyre black on it.
1326313675079086082 2020-11-11 07:59:56 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I still wouldn't want it. I don't want people to die.  Anyway the numbers on the Court seem favourable already.
1326313183171112960 2020-11-11 07:57:59 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile Neither do I.
1326307381068795905 2020-11-11 07:34:55 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @For_Australia_ We all hate you too.
1326297642612109312 2020-11-11 06:56:14 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Read the whole thread.
1326093001471373313 2020-11-10 17:23:03 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Those who destroy history are the enemies of freedom.
1326087422698909696 2020-11-10 17:00:53 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Ugh.   https://t.co/DGSYliGEaE
1326074596777357312 2020-11-10 16:09:55 +0800 <ozols_aldis> While elections take our attention, this stuff is keeping us alive.
1326067322012905472 2020-11-10 15:41:01 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Woah! Glad you made it.
1326039046674501633 2020-11-10 13:48:39 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It must have been a great speech if the writer also wrote the review.
1326028614861639680 2020-11-10 13:07:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Everything is going according to plan.
1326004535693750277 2020-11-10 11:31:31 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @ZengerleJoshua I thought your avatar was a map of Australia with an American flag on it. But it isn't.  It's good!
1326003479828033537 2020-11-10 11:27:20 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Aussies for Trump!
1326002627490975744 2020-11-10 11:23:56 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Not an American. But democracy is important, and genuine votes should count.
1326002124107362306 2020-11-10 11:21:56 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's barely acceptable, considering his victim suffered surprisingly little harm.  But a violent attack using deadly force should have more severe consequences.
1325990834580320256 2020-11-10 10:37:05 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @XiranJayZhao Get steel teeth. Then you'll be even more evil!
1325962851362598912 2020-11-10 08:45:53 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I'd like to know, too.  Even if they don't agree with it, anything the President says is still news.
1325960379986452480 2020-11-10 08:36:04 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Why doesn't Twitter say "This claim about the President-elect is disputed"?
1325943617966403584 2020-11-10 07:29:28 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Centuries?
1325935484904697857 2020-11-10 06:57:08 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Why would a passenger pull the handbrake while the car was in motion?  https://t.co/4UjSutmypP
1325731382866317317 2020-11-09 17:26:07 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @MaliaKay5 Best Vietnam song - "I was only nineteen" by Redgum.
1325721188761395200 2020-11-09 16:45:36 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I've seen lots of evidence. ABC journos need glasses.
1325689857809682432 2020-11-09 14:41:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> "Asking for peaceful protest is white supremacy".  These people have no idea what real white supremacy would look like.
1325638270475067400 2020-11-09 11:16:07 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's the end of the weekend in America. I wonder what will happen on Monday morning?
1325629745514467328 2020-11-09 10:42:14 +0800 <ozols_aldis> In Australia, votes are counted by hand in the presence of scrutineers nominated by the candidates.  I wouldn't trust a digital election system unless it was extremely open sourced and audited. Better just to use human counters.
1325628058309521409 2020-11-09 10:35:32 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Is this normal, or are they getting better at rescuing the children?  Also, how can people be so evil in the first place?
1325626895187111936 2020-11-09 10:30:55 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @gmorg22 @AusAntiLeft Alliteration always appeals.
1325590184369418248 2020-11-09 08:05:02 +0800 <ozols_aldis> The US is a close ally of Israel, as well as an extremely influential nation. Trump may have offered incentives.  It's not an imposition on sovereignty to help make a peace deal. They still had a choice, and they probably wanted peace too.
1325409322323509248 2020-11-08 20:06:22 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @right_movies 2001.
1325408888200392705 2020-11-08 20:04:38 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Forgetting myself in what I'm doing.
1325408735087325185 2020-11-08 20:04:02 +0800 <ozols_aldis> An achievement greatly helped by Donald Trump.

1325401012287365127 2020-11-08 19:33:20 +0800 <ozols_aldis> All vote counting software should be open source and subject to public audit.  Closed source software can't be trusted - you don't know what it's doing.

1325396878926651393 2020-11-08 19:16:55 +0800 <ozols_aldis> This video shows 560 votes being flipped from one candidate to the other during live counting.
1325394298481774592 2020-11-08 19:06:40 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Nothing will stop a determined Democrat voter ... not even death!
1325391573190733826 2020-11-08 18:55:50 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I think he means the alliance between the US and Australia is in deep.
1325391236304265217 2020-11-08 18:54:29 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Don't tell Japan
1325386813716922368 2020-11-08 18:36:55 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It isn't interference if they don't try to change the result.  The media are pushing the "President-elect Biden" line and it would look strange if our Prime Minister didn't congratulate the presumed winner.  But it's Americans who will decide in the end.
1325296198895300609 2020-11-08 12:36:51 +0800 <ozols_aldis> From his basement!
1325295018718883840 2020-11-08 12:32:09 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.
1325293876727345154 2020-11-08 12:27:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Some of them are making revenge lists, too.
1325251369758986241 2020-11-08 09:38:43 +0800 <ozols_aldis> If Biden doesn't win, a lot of people have exposed their true agenda.
1325248639933898758 2020-11-08 09:27:52 +0800 <ozols_aldis> So many challenges to the current result. The media are going to look odd when the election they called today, keeps on going for the next two months.
1325247377054130179 2020-11-08 09:22:51 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Biden cured covid just by claiming to be the winner!
1325230135247695873 2020-11-08 08:14:20 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Has Hunter made an appearance yet? When was the last time anyone saw him?
1325227930813755392 2020-11-08 08:05:34 +0800 <ozols_aldis> If many people think Biden has won already, it will be easier to persuade them that Trump is the one trying to steal the election.
1325227010461847552 2020-11-08 08:01:55 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Or 144,000 depending on the party counting.
1325180042779848704 2020-11-08 04:55:17 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I don't know why they have voters officially registered as supporters of a party. It seems like a recipe for trouble.
1325178478057021440 2020-11-08 04:49:04 +0800 <ozols_aldis> We better make one, and fast.
1325177445528424448 2020-11-08 04:44:58 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Worst. Fascists. Ever.
1325176301213290496 2020-11-08 04:40:25 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Whoever ends up with the Presidency, the other side will believe that they were defrauded.  That's not good for America or the rest of the world.
1325150857101406209 2020-11-08 02:59:19 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Trump will take it to court and there will be recounts. So it may be Biden, but it's not over yet.  In 2000, the result was disputed and it took a month to make it final.
1324968346836590592 2020-11-07 14:54:05 +0800 <ozols_aldis> This is a test based on the mathematical probability of numbers with specific digits appearing in vote counts.  It's based on the tendency of humans to get it wrong when trying to fake random numbers. Statistical analysis can detect the differences.
1324964477792477184 2020-11-07 14:38:42 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Many Democrats continued to believe that Ford won long after Bush was sworn in.
1324961333599596544 2020-11-07 14:26:13 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Hitler and Stallin had lists too, for much the same reason.

1324951942817181698 2020-11-07 13:48:54 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's called "projection": Wrongly attributing your own characteristics to other people.  Leftists do it a lot.
1324912252412026881 2020-11-07 11:11:11 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I wonder if someone is compiling a list of the leftists who are making lists?
1324886468406358016 2020-11-07 09:28:43 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's when the dead walk.
1324882916288024576 2020-11-07 09:14:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It sounds like a fascist regime.  No big surprise, considering the Antifa hate riots.
1324560599833927681 2020-11-06 11:53:50 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Everyone in Australia is being penalised by export sanctions. Some will be hit harder than others at first.

1324453840775643137 2020-11-06 04:49:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> He moves so slowly that they think he's one of them.
1324152888113815553 2020-11-05 08:53:44 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Unlike Donald Trump's tweets, these claims by Joe Biden don't have a Twitter warning.

1323480930816724992 2020-11-03 12:23:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Many years ago, when I worked as a professional political advisor and campaigner, I met someone who had a degree in political science.  He was pretty clueless when it came to practical politics. Theory cannot substitute for experience.
1323478699430219777 2020-11-03 12:14:45 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @CinderBomb99 It's unfair because men can't find it.
1323467913412583425 2020-11-03 11:31:54 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I can't vote in the US election. But the winner is important for Australia.  That's why I support President Trump.

1322527308872179713 2020-10-31 21:14:16 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Yes. Social distancing for covid keeps the flu at bay too.

1322511628034715649 2020-10-31 20:11:57 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @aussie_smitty Pretty good effort.  Were you using a tripod? What sort of camera?

1322048003817893888 2020-10-30 13:29:41 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Maybe the leaders thought that if they'd got away with it for fifty years, they'd get away with it forever.
1321979845643890688 2020-10-30 08:58:51 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Is that a bum hole or a coronavirus?
1321979335893344256 2020-10-30 08:56:49 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Thus giving The Intercept more publicity than it's ever had before.  Too bad it's all negative.
1321977515338948613 2020-10-30 08:49:35 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Another story that won't be covered by the legacy media.
1321976237028331521 2020-10-30 08:44:30 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's a last throw of the dice. If Trump wins Twitter us going to be slammed with lawsuits, if Biden wins the company might escape.
1321975210443042817 2020-10-30 08:40:25 +0800 <ozols_aldis> That's a border closure I can get behind!
1321951579017113601 2020-10-30 07:06:31 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's just a left wing slur that's automatically applied to anyone on the right.  It doesn't really mean anything now, due to to misuse.
1321919676302045184 2020-10-30 04:59:45 +0800 <ozols_aldis> If French Muslims held a mass protest against religious violence, I would have more respect for them.  It's one way forward.
1321919117255876608 2020-10-30 04:57:32 +0800 <ozols_aldis> There are many fascists who call themselves antifascists.

1321917597441429504 2020-10-30 04:51:29 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I wonder whose van it is?

1321915962363318272 2020-10-30 04:45:00 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Any subject matter, once it is politicised, becomes the topic of unreliable science.
1321915378134478848 2020-10-30 04:42:40 +0800 <ozols_aldis> This censorship will peak as to election draws closer and desperation reaches a peak.

1318435224833781760 2020-10-20 14:13:47 +0800 <ozols_aldis> More than that, Trump tried to make peace in Iraq and Afghanistan, and reconciled Israel with some of its neighbours.
1318433040784240640 2020-10-20 14:05:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's because they're rival religions.

1317321570814107650 2020-10-17 12:28:31 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @jetjackson20 True.  A missed opportunity.
1317297734622216195 2020-10-17 10:53:48 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @jetjackson20 It is now, but with research on robotics and maybe using a little of our own uranium for energy, this might be ameliorated.  If China gets more unreliable as a trade partner, other countries could have a greater market for Australian goods.

1312907517102452737 2020-10-05 08:08:39 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @_RedAlerts Yes to the first part.  Social trends seem to indicate that humans are attracted to huge hive-cities. So a robust system of self-repairing supply chains would be needed.  Agrarianism would be great but I think most would prefer city comforts.
1312906403665772544 2020-10-05 08:04:13 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @_RedAlerts Cool. I would have been a coder if I'd been born a little later. As it is, I'm a multidisciplinary failure.
1312906030800486400 2020-10-05 08:02:45 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @_RedAlerts I envisage anarchism as a society of self-organising communities that coalesce around shared interests.  Neither capitalist nor socialist as a whole, but each group would adapt its own preferred economy and methods of co-ordination.
1312905271094644736 2020-10-05 07:59:43 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @_RedAlerts Theoretically I'm an anarchist who believes that both fascism and communism are totalitarian statist movements to be opposed.  Actual anarchism would require more social evolution via the Internet, so in practice I work within the system.

My main objection to ANTIFA is that they use violence to suppress speech they don't like, which is somewhat akin actual fascism.

1310378910383652867 2020-09-28 08:40:52 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I think Trump voters mostly don't care. They know the media hate him and will publish anything to try to bring him down.  Trump won in 2016 because many voters were sick of leftists destroying American culture. That's still the main issue.

I expect that the existing support included enforcing quarantine. The ADF helped enforce quarantine in NSW, which didn't experience an outbreak as in Victoria.

1308646823121149952 2020-09-23 13:58:10 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Why did the anaconda cross the road?  Because it was chasing the chicken.
1308646541230391296 2020-09-23 13:57:03 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Should people with defective memories be running a state?
1308595542633492480 2020-09-23 10:34:24 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Warp speed!
1308582402483126272 2020-09-23 09:42:11 +0800 <ozols_aldis> That's a step up from Trump renting space in your head.
1308582111243198464 2020-09-23 09:41:02 +0800 <ozols_aldis> That's sure to make people support their cause.  (not)
1308571941175848961 2020-09-23 09:00:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @ImNotCharity What, no Bela Lugosi?  Then it has to be the Count!
1308570737070931968 2020-09-23 08:55:50 +0800 <ozols_aldis> I can't decide whether I like the Cybertruck's angular styling, or hate it.
1308217199740428289 2020-09-22 09:31:00 +0800 <ozols_aldis> But what if you forget where the records are?

1307963806459375617 2020-09-21 16:44:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Considering it's 2020, that'll be 27 curses right there.

1307932366103478273 2020-09-21 14:39:10 +0800 <ozols_aldis> What happened to 'one law for all'?
1307893025360629760 2020-09-21 12:02:51 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Russian hackers took over the control chip briefly, before being repelled by Chinese hackers.

1307552210042023936 2020-09-20 13:28:34 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Genghis Khan was cancelled a couple of months ago.  Does this mean we have to un-cancel him now?
1307551817908117504 2020-09-20 13:27:01 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @StatesWarring Genghis Khan was cancelled a couple of months ago. Do we have to un-cancel him now?
1307548960525963266 2020-09-20 13:15:39 +0800 <ozols_aldis> High mountain chains like the Himalayas are often caused by continental plates pushing together, forcing the land between them to go upwards.
1307540888462139392 2020-09-20 12:43:35 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile I hope it gets better for you.
1307517077188616192 2020-09-20 11:08:58 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile You'll probably live to see many Justices appointed. You might like some of them.
1307516332129153026 2020-09-20 11:06:00 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @scotusphile Life sometimes looks bleak, but often gets better.
1307149370748334085 2020-09-19 10:47:50 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Most voters don't like riots. This will not help the anti-Trump mob.
1307138578129072128 2020-09-19 10:04:57 +0800 <ozols_aldis> The more the left riots, the more voters support Trump.
1306851765560565760 2020-09-18 15:05:15 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @PoliBard @Inferno0696085 @QuriousIn Triangulation is possible using a single drone, taking measurements at different times as it moves through different positions.
1306792970935504896 2020-09-18 11:11:37 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's important to understand the point of view of the person you're talking to, and phrase your own propositions in terms they will recognise and understand.  Hostility will not convince someone of your ideas. Sympathy is more effective.

1306462916002996224 2020-09-17 13:20:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @QTAnon1 What's the parking brake for?
1306457462682214404 2020-09-17 12:58:26 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @nath_99 @abcnews The states that used the ADF as quarantine guards didn't have a second wave of coronavirus.  That's not a coincidence.
1306457020673847296 2020-09-17 12:56:41 +0800 <ozols_aldis> This seems unlikely. Using the ADF worked in all the other States.  Australians tend to trust our military.
1306454637415788544 2020-09-17 12:47:12 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Catzilla!
1306407329550626817 2020-09-17 09:39:13 +0800 <ozols_aldis> The Internet, if free of censorship, could form the basis for greater democracy and economic freedom.  But if abused, it could lead to a terrible police state.  Which will it be?
1306405788420681729 2020-09-17 09:33:06 +0800 <ozols_aldis> Experimental space capsule has crashed.

1306381309015539712 2020-09-17 07:55:50 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @DragonRageGamin @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Actually it was made illegal in the US during the 1930s. US Treasury official Harry Anslinger was behind the push.  In 1961 the UN Single Convention on Narcotics made the ban worldwide.   https://t.co/kdFbUWAnSP
1306125949805584385 2020-09-16 15:01:07 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @JoviiiGirl The same.
1305686520309841926 2020-09-15 09:54:59 +0800 <ozols_aldis> It's well past time to establish a real strategic reserve.  A previous policy included as part of our "strategic reserve" oil in tankers on the way to Australia. That was ridiculous.   A strategic reserve must be physically present.
1304942774475608064 2020-09-13 08:39:36 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @catsdotexe He was only looking for a quiet place to read!
1302407702048456704 2020-09-06 08:46:08 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @StatesWarring I can confirm this based on my extensive viewing of cheap kung fu movies.
1300613232780926979 2020-09-01 09:55:33 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @LeslieSawyer17 @realDonaldTrump Sorry, I went by memory on the number of real Trump followers instead of checking.
1300604319578767361 2020-09-01 09:20:08 +0800 <ozols_aldis> @reulDonaIdTrump This is a fake account.  Note that it begins with "reul" instead of "real", and doesn't have 54 million followers.
