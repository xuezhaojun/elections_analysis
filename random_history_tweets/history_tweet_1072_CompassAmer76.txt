1327337800631525380 2020-11-14 03:49:27 +0800 <CompassAmer76> @marlaestes16 @FriendEden100 Because this is a current issue and to us impartiality of justices is an important issue.

1325588153328078849 2020-11-09 07:56:58 +0800 <CompassAmer76> @BetheLove6 @davematt88 No matter what happens, as we see it, half the battle's been knowing we're not alone &amp; can network with others as this all unfolds. If each of us keeps doing our part, to the time/resources/skills we have, that's the most we-or any generation facing such a crisis-can do.
1325586095313215489 2020-11-09 07:48:47 +0800 <CompassAmer76> @BetheLove6 @davematt88 It seems we must do both. As this week/election has shown, many hands make lighter work, &amp; we're seemingly willing to work. Keep building our national "community" by amplifying each other's work &amp; engaging in our local areas as best we can to promote Compassionate Governance.🇺🇸
1325445159077679105 2020-11-08 22:28:46 +0800 <CompassAmer76> @davematt88 @BetheLove6 This is why we need to refocus on our states &amp; communities. It's way too easy to focus on the national picture and ignore our responsibilities to the state &amp; local levels.

1325440999448047616 2020-11-08 22:12:14 +0800 <CompassAmer76> As we process the 2020 Election results, we need to pay close attention now to our states &amp; communities. How healthy is your state-level republic? There's much healing to do; bi-partisan divisions/dualistic thinking remain &amp; independent political innovation has been marginalized.

When we engage in dualistic stereotyping, we deny others their humanity, limit the possibilities for long-term bridge-building/reform, &amp; close down the listening/learning needed for USA to evolve past this era for greatest good.
1324378554033909760 2020-11-05 23:50:27 +0800 <CompassAmer76> @ImmaBee247 @AlanFelauer Except that's dualistic thinking is not reality. Political culture is a complex, &amp; there are plenty of people who are independents, centrists, libertarians, &amp; non-Trump conservatives who voted for Biden this time, b/c it was the right thing to do for the survival of our Republic.

1313937874899918850 2020-10-08 04:22:55 +0800 <CompassAmer76> The debates were stolen from We the People in the 1980s.  Since then, we've watched the same useless "dog-n-'phony'" shows that the 2 parties &amp;their cronies in corporate media throw at us. Guess what? It's time WE change that!

Albeit those values imperfectly applied in our past, we best remember WHY those values matter for humanity and act accordingly in November when we vote.

More good stuff from one of the groups around the country sponsoring conversations at the local level &amp; reminding why listening is critically important to overcoming the monolithic fears that dehumanize others &amp; destroy peaceable society.

Who else will join this growing network of independent-minded Americans, forging a new way forward for our republic?   https://t.co/yrVJh5dKKv
1304146279312887813 2020-09-11 03:54:37 +0800 <CompassAmer76> Understanding multiple perspectives on an issue is our RESPONSIBLITY to our republic.  If you're in an ideological echo chamber then you best check the level of your commitment to making representative democracy truly work.
1304145831893839880 2020-09-11 03:52:50 +0800 <CompassAmer76> A piece by one of Compassionate America's Partners in Politics, Jonia Broderick. Without a doubt, more listening &amp; far less knee jerk, political stereotyping is needed amongst the electorate. Why? Because in US, #countryoverparty is the only way We the People's republic survives!
1304106349874368512 2020-09-11 01:15:57 +0800 <CompassAmer76> Which is why the dog-n-pony show of 20th-c. combative governance must end on our watch! We the People now demand better from ALL seeking political employment. We will vote &amp; we will EXPECT collaborative approaches/new tenor-n-tone. If not,then no job w/us!  https://t.co/lS2EPstI03
1304104384083693568 2020-09-11 01:08:08 +0800 <CompassAmer76> Exactly! @civichealthproj produces meaningful tweets about topics vital to the survival of our Republic. Consider supporting this type of political culture shift by reading/sharing the Declaration of Mission with others &amp; singing the petition to Congress!   https://t.co/lS2EPstI03
1304035436747251712 2020-09-10 20:34:10 +0800 <CompassAmer76> Folks in TN, you'll want to be aware of this! "they...arbitrarily set a minimum of $[50K] in…contributions as one of the qualifications for participating in the debate...effectively shutting out...Independent candidates...duly registered with the state &amp; on the ballot.
