Please take the time to look it up. The Republican lawmakers in all of these swing states refused to allow early mail in votes to be counted until the day/night of the election so Trump could yell fraud. You Reps got duped!  https://t.co/ybUmjkZRXC

1336189131085340673 2020-12-08 14:01:28 +0800 <gnphshn> @mmpadellan ES&amp;S voting machines are owned by Republicans. Reps wont talk about their machines. They deflect by accusing Dominion first to cause confusion. ES&amp;S were used for around 80% of the Nov. voting. Mitch and Lindsey cheated and that's why Mitch smiled at his debates.  https://t.co/xlwX4C9KHK

1333437438304333826 2020-11-30 23:47:14 +0800 <gnphshn> @TX_WalkerRanger Let's check the ES&amp;S machines owned by Republicans in the states Trump won for irregularities. Notice Trump name drops Dominion as a deflection technique but doesn't mention anything regarding ES&amp;S? Look up the company and its history and you find the real voter fraud.

What is the punishment for treason? Isn't the govt in the process of reinstating firing squads for death penalties. Bingo you have a winner!!

He will unfortunately serve some sort of prison sentence for being somewhere he didnt need to be while not being mature enough to handle the illegal weapon he possessed.

Counting the same Georgia votes over and over again expecting a different result. Let's recount the SC and KY votes for you, Lindsey and Mitch.

1327967661435756546 2020-11-15 21:32:17 +0800 <gnphshn> @JennaEllisEsq This is probably one of the dumbest questions I've read. If you're part of Trump's legal team for this campaign it's obvious why he keeps losing in his court battles. The people voted, the votes were counted and Joe won. He doesn't have to "prove" it. Are you really an attorney?

1327838338473050113 2020-11-15 12:58:24 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump First off, your guy started the fight attacking others. I'm not condoning the end result but please get your shit straight before you open your mouth with comments. Nobody is getting arrested and you know it. Quit talking shit and politely get the phuck out of our White House.
1327834366140039174 2020-11-15 12:42:37 +0800 <gnphshn> @meiselasb Does anyone else think the heads of Twitter are afraid of Trump?
1327833287688011777 2020-11-15 12:38:20 +0800 <gnphshn> Does anyone else get the impression that those in charge of Twitter are actually afraid of Trump? I've seen people get put in twitmo for frivolous things. This dickhead continuously tries to incite violence and he still keeps his account. What gives Twitter? Please explain.
1327832156001820673 2020-11-15 12:33:50 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump There were maybe a few thousand but not even close to "hundreds of thousands". You're not very good with numbers and estimates are you? Is that why you're broke?

1326369111857790976 2020-11-11 11:40:13 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Sounds like Trump saying "drink this koolaid and listen to my voice. I am well loved and you will believe everything I say.

As a blue wave I'm getting tired of being pulled over and punished for expired tags or a bad headlight while these assholes get to commit treason on a daily basis with no repercussions.

How much of that money did you blow up your nose and how many donors did your girlfriend hottub with to "seal the deals"

A voting machine can be coded, wiped clean and reset. Just ask the people of KY and SC. The problem Reps have is that most Dems used paper ballots that can be verified and now Trump is screwed.

Graham claims he's struggling financially, directs attention to Jaime's donations all while embezzling his own money knowing he will still win. Now he suddenly has $500K to help Trump?

So you're saying Republicans can cheat? Isn't that what you Reps are already accusing us of doing now?
1325332799990104065 2020-11-08 15:02:17 +0800 <gnphshn> @psychofan1 @GiannoCaldwell Please explain how this fraud took place using actual proof not Fox news stories or coked out Jr rhetoric. Both parties mailed in ballots, both parties voted the day of. Simple math. More votes=winner. How do we know the Rep mailed votes weren't illegal? Because you say so?
1325309829192114176 2020-11-08 13:31:01 +0800 <gnphshn> @AriFleischer @lindaisout I've never seen so many butthurt Trumpsters before in my life. You have so many excuses as to why he lost. How about the simple fact that he sucked as a President. What did Reps say in 2016? "HE LOST..GET OVER IT!!"
1325305723874549763 2020-11-08 13:14:42 +0800 <gnphshn> @marcorubio 0-10 so far..are you sure you want to continue?
1325303033534664706 2020-11-08 13:04:00 +0800 <gnphshn> @LHuch99 @MccrostieJim @seanhannity Haha..Trump loves America? Trump loves attention and you feed his ego. He wouldn't give any of you a splash of water if you were on fire.  Go to Mar-A-Lago and see how many of you are allowed in. Jacked up trucks, flags, PBR, camo, etc. If you're not top 1% Rep. He doesn't care.
1325299873181294594 2020-11-08 12:51:27 +0800 <gnphshn> @MccrostieJim @seanhannity Chances are your noise would be drowned out by us Biden supporters. If you want to waste your time go ahead. If it'll make you feel better go ahead. If your wife or husband will love you more for it go ahead. If you think your moaning will last longer than 5 minutes go ahead.

Your lawyers suck and should be disbarred for filing frivolous lawsuits without merit. You'll see how real lawyers perform when Trump and the rest of you have your asses and jail sentences handed to you.

We already knew we were voting for Biden. Trump held rallies for his ego. The numbers increased simply because more people got out and voted. How is it that Reps cant do simple math? More registered voters=more votes.

1324559289864904705 2020-11-06 11:48:38 +0800 <gnphshn> @Jukes_wolfy @babyruth_70 @maryloukash @Toure Did the Reps who are arguing in this convo about voter fraud mention the Rep in Pennsylvania who got caught for voter fraud recently by trying to get a ballot for his dead mom?  Reps need to point the thumb before they point the finger and accuse others.
1324554850370166784 2020-11-06 11:31:00 +0800 <gnphshn> @Mocolove2020 I heard Kentucky called it with only 67% in. Dont know what the Biden/Trump percentages were at the time
1324553483136106497 2020-11-06 11:25:34 +0800 <gnphshn> @babyruth_70 @Jukes_wolfy @maryloukash @Toure Do Trumpsters really understand how mail-in voting works? The "day of" votes are counted first.Then the mail in votes are counted. You Reps always blow your wads early thinking it's over the night of the election because you voted that day. That's where you're wrong and you lose.

I believe that it's difficult to have a battle of wits against unarmed opponents and you prove that theory everytime they have you on their show.

For starters put him in a supermax prison cell with his own lies pumping through a speaker 24 hrs a day for him to listen to

1319039445799104512 2020-10-22 06:14:45 +0800 <gnphshn> @IamAntiCSE Kiera, my apologies for the misunderstanding earlier with a comment I made. I have 12 yr old daughter and a 16 yr old daughter and I have no problem de-nutting anyone that ever attacks them.
1319038693621915648 2020-10-22 06:11:45 +0800 <gnphshn> @ToddHolste @FoxNews I back policies that let me thrive, let me live and allow my daughters to have an equal future in a man's world. Again, you have your opinion with facts and I have my opinion with facts. Have a great day!
1319038044641529857 2020-10-22 06:09:11 +0800 <gnphshn> @ToddHolste @FoxNews I believe in @JoeBiden because of what he stands for with healthcare, taxing the rich, etc. The only thing I've seen from Trump is calling people names, no healthcare plan, letting the rich get richer, etc. What has he honestly done for people like you and I these past 4 yrs?
1319037108967780352 2020-10-22 06:05:27 +0800 <gnphshn> @ToddHolste @FoxNews I figured you weren't afraid of anything Todd. Again, I have my opinions based on facts and you have your opinion based on facts. If this election is going to cause us to not be friends anymore than I'm sorry youre allowing it to. Have a great day!
1319021139864158208 2020-10-22 05:02:00 +0800 <gnphshn> @ToddHolste @FoxNews Opinions and facts to back them up if needed.
1319020892387561472 2020-10-22 05:01:01 +0800 <gnphshn> @ToddHolste @FoxNews Same as your Todd. You back Red. I back blue. We all have our opinions and that's what I love about the 1st amendment.
1319020609939009537 2020-10-22 04:59:54 +0800 <gnphshn> @ToddHolste @DonaldJTrumpJr My state seems to be doing better than yours right now because we actually took precautions when we were told to. Look it up Todd. As for your internet comment. I dont think you want this debate live on twitter. I have too many friends were you live.
1319020014331064320 2020-10-22 04:57:32 +0800 <gnphshn> @ToddHolste @FoxNews Todd.Reps are so full of koolaid their eyeballs are floating. I like you as a person. I simply dont believe the same things you believe.
1319018971329298432 2020-10-22 04:53:23 +0800 <gnphshn> @FoxNews @ToddHolste He's phucked and he knows it. She called him on his bullshit and he bailed like a bully getting handed their ass on the playground.
1319017963400278016 2020-10-22 04:49:23 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr @ToddHolste I wonder if the Red States are leading in Covid deaths due to their stupidity.

It's a learned trait they picked up from their daddy. When shit goes bad for Trump he yells to try and overpower his opponent.

Republicans are basing this election outcome on mail in ballot fraud. Take their excuse away from them.

I'm very familiar with the Koch Brothers based out of Kansas and their bullshit beliefs as a former Kansan. Hope the Dems tear this wide open!!!

If you say so Sevs. You be you..If you're trying to challenge me on whether the award is legit then you win and I wont continue arguing. You're the Master Debater and win hands down. Just Remember, Tweet debating will make you go blind if you dont stop once in awhile.

1315112962923868161 2020-10-11 10:12:18 +0800 <gnphshn> @paulsperry_ It'll only cost you a vote and still potentially your life. Bribes everywhere! This smells like extreme panic and the stench is attracting flies right Pence?

1315018550361415681 2020-10-11 03:57:08 +0800 <gnphshn> @Xianworldview @guypbenson So when Trump loses Dems can do the same thing right. Why are Reps complaining about it? Also, dont forget the Supreme Court used to be 8 before the Reps added one. Dems can do the same thing right? EXACTLY

1314763676465782784 2020-10-10 11:04:22 +0800 <gnphshn> @BirnbaumMatt @KatiePhang @Acyn Speaking of tests. Do any of you think Trump can remember the 5 things he had to remember when he aced his cognitive test?

1314760495535095809 2020-10-10 10:51:43 +0800 <gnphshn> @TheRickWilson Better question: why do we not see the MIA/POW flag flying honorably  on the White House?

Wear your favorite matching camo gear and dont forget to bring your biggest gun you own to hide your inadequacies. I used to dress up in camo and run through the woods when I was 8.

1314430663701917701 2020-10-09 13:01:05 +0800 <gnphshn> Trump will always claim that he's the Master Debater and he'll beat anyone hands down.

1314338532312387587 2020-10-09 06:54:59 +0800 <gnphshn> @DrMattMcCarthy @CharlieDavies9 A company Trump has stake in. Guess he has make money somehow to pay that $421 million debt before the Russians come after his head.
1314337026456645637 2020-10-09 06:49:00 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump How the hell does fracking and the 2nd amendment go hand in hand? The frackers dont shoot their guns into the ground. It's like me saying I'm buying oranges to make lasagna tonight. Makes absolutely no sense.

1314283950181933058 2020-10-09 03:18:06 +0800 <gnphshn> @EvanMcMullin @gtconway3d Hasn't he already confirmed 204 conservative judges in all areas of the courts since taking office? That's packing the courts. He needs to focus on packing his bags.
1314282874020003841 2020-10-09 03:13:50 +0800 <gnphshn> @birdintexas @Yamiche His next executive order will be to have the Statue of Liberty removed and a statue of him put in her place because he cant stand a woman of power getting more attention than him.
1314282127509381121 2020-10-09 03:10:52 +0800 <gnphshn> @RealJamesWoods You do realize how bad fracking is to water supply right? This is from someone who lived in Kansas and is very familiar with it.
1314240079347343362 2020-10-09 00:23:46 +0800 <gnphshn> @AbbyWambach I'm a former collegiate women's soccer coach (17 yrs) and I was wondering if I can ask you a question regarding game preparation now days at the highest levels.

1314224755466141696 2020-10-08 23:22:53 +0800 <gnphshn> This now makes sense. Not in it for the health of the American people. Purely in it for financial gain. I guess he needs to make money however he can to pay off his $421 million debt.  https://t.co/6Rx87h2WoW
1314217791029874689 2020-10-08 22:55:13 +0800 <gnphshn> @RichardGrenell @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden Trump cant stand longer than 5 minutes without distressed breathing and nearly passing out. He's weak and unfit to be President. Now with a pre-existing condition, Trump will lose his healthcare when he gets rid of Obamacare like other Americans.#karma
1314216233366028291 2020-10-08 22:49:01 +0800 <gnphshn> @hughhewitt @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Would you feel safe in front of the super spreader with no mask on and spit flying at you as he loses his shit?  I'd feel safer on a mountaintop with a 10ft pole during a lightning storm.
1314212070301167620 2020-10-08 22:32:29 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Is this the same Chris Wray your daddy put in charge and spoke highly of until he stopped being daddy's puppet?  "I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow,‚Äù the President said.
1314204173143949313 2020-10-08 22:01:06 +0800 <gnphshn> @PhD_style @StephaneAtkins7 @EricPerrault5 Those idiots who you speak of have studied scientific patterns which show unequivocally the earth is deteriorating at a high rate of speed.  Unfortunately some idiots choose to help speed up the process through negligence for pure financial gain. PhD in style? In Montana?
1314057876957138944 2020-10-08 12:19:46 +0800 <gnphshn> @RealJamesWoods You did watch the same debate the rest of us watched right? The fly had a better performance than Pence.
1314054213693964288 2020-10-08 12:05:13 +0800 <gnphshn> I encouraged my 16 year old and 12 year old daughters to watch the debate at their mom's house and give me their opinion afterwards. They said "Kamala should be President, more female moderators and Pence needs to show respect when the women are talking."
1314051380370317313 2020-10-08 11:53:57 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you still awake?

1314049469869031424 2020-10-08 11:46:22 +0800 <gnphshn> @StephaneAtkins7 @EricPerrault5 My state (CO) is on fire right now also but not near as bad as yours. My point is this: Your forest floors are packed with pine needles and dead fallen trees. Is that because of climate change/ lack of rainfall or because a forest rake wasnt purchased to clean them up?
1314034820515721216 2020-10-08 10:48:09 +0800 <gnphshn> @FoxNews kamala Harris just ate your son's lunch on National Television. Let's see how you twist this outcome.
1314030722022141952 2020-10-08 10:31:52 +0800 <gnphshn> @realrevwindham Less Trump supporters at the voting booths Nov. 3rd.

1314029074340220928 2020-10-08 10:25:19 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Remember Jr..daddy already packed 204 into the courts so far since being in office. What your family should be concerned about is packing your stuff and leaving the White House after Nov. 3rd.
1314027848861016064 2020-10-08 10:20:27 +0800 <gnphshn> @RepMattGaetz @BarackObama @JoeBiden @HillaryClinton You're struggling to find something to talk about while Pence is getting his ass kicked on National Television like Covid Trump did last week.

1314014417902690304 2020-10-08 09:27:05 +0800 <gnphshn> @StephaneAtkins7 @EricPerrault5 Unfortunately California already Red due to the fires because the Covid in Chief doesn't believe in global warming.
1314012734648913920 2020-10-08 09:20:23 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln That's the covid trying to get out.
1314012374156939264 2020-10-08 09:18:57 +0800 <gnphshn> I thought they only had 2 minutes without interruption? Pence keeps babbling like his dad and keeps interrupting!
1314009406972063745 2020-10-08 09:07:10 +0800 <gnphshn> @pamther77 Definitely!
1314009144605769728 2020-10-08 09:06:07 +0800 <gnphshn> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Absolutely yes!
1314003241756131330 2020-10-08 08:42:40 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr didn't you just retweet an article regarding vote by mail fraud earlier today and now your covid spreader is saying it's ok? He flip-flops worse than a fish out of water when he thinks it might benefit him.
1314001523769323520 2020-10-08 08:35:50 +0800 <gnphshn> @HuHot there's an empty Ruby Tuesday restaurant that would be a great place to open a new HuHot here in Silverthorne, Colorado. You'd be near 7 different ski resorts with potential for lots of business. Please consider it. We're an hour west of Denver on I-70.
1313967452590493697 2020-10-08 06:20:27 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln Looks like @SteveSchmidtSES kicked his ass earlier with that long tweet. Protect the right eye Trump. "Cut me Mick"  https://t.co/R23D9Lcwwu
1313963806284939264 2020-10-08 06:05:58 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln What's wrong with his right cheek. Is that poor lighting, a shadow or the side effects of his steroids?
1313962202487955456 2020-10-08 05:59:35 +0800 <gnphshn> Where is Trump? He hasn't been seen in public in the last 40+ hours..Tik Tok Tik Tok Tik Tok
1313895455160446978 2020-10-08 01:34:22 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump Steve just ate your lunch, gave you a wedgie and told you to go play on the other side of the playground! Bully defeated!! #SteveownsTrump
1313872260629897232 2020-10-08 00:02:12 +0800 <gnphshn> @john_olson420 One of my favorite pics I took from my old place last year in Breck.  https://t.co/ytOnoa1DEB
1313851166149677059 2020-10-07 22:38:22 +0800 <gnphshn> @OperationMAGA Why wade through the covid sea when she can just go up to the front door of the White House?
1313849431125442560 2020-10-07 22:31:29 +0800 <gnphshn> @Timodc @gtconway3d Give Trump a hand. He's proven time and time again to be a mass debater.
1313839568106315776 2020-10-07 21:52:17 +0800 <gnphshn> @PeteHegseth @DonaldJTrumpJr Everyone is vulnerable. Covid doesn't discriminate by race, age or gender.
1313838122115899392 2020-10-07 21:46:32 +0800 <gnphshn> @happily_lady Happy Birthday!
1313702629294268417 2020-10-07 12:48:08 +0800 <gnphshn> @markhoppus Trump is being released from the hospital..
1313702007241285633 2020-10-07 12:45:40 +0800 <gnphshn> @NRA @PVeritas_Action @Everytown @CaptMarkKelly So paranoid about your guns and the 2nd amendment. Plenty of Dems own guns and you dont hear them crying about having them taken away.
1313673264070373378 2020-10-07 10:51:27 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump The drug cocktail is definitely kicking in.
1313651087900106752 2020-10-07 09:23:20 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump You have no real authority to do so. Quit spitting out nonsense. You're just spreading more covid everytime you breathe or open your mouth to speak.
1313650200377020416 2020-10-07 09:19:48 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Great! Let's see those taxes of yours  while you're releasing all the important paperwork that revolves around lies and corruption.
1313641679405056010 2020-10-07 08:45:57 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews Did you see the absolute joke of a non believing President getting sick from a virus he called a hoax and needing oxygen to keep him going? What moving company did you reserve for Nov?
1313580791105024000 2020-10-07 04:44:00 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr You keep talking about Clinton like she's currently in the race. Let's talk about your dad being a super spreader for his own publicity. Cant wait until, your daddy and the rest of your clan are far away from the People's White House.
1313579708869677058 2020-10-07 04:39:42 +0800 <gnphshn> @SharonT93609709 @BrandonStraka You might want to check your research Sharon. Trump said it was a hoax plenty of times and blamed it on the Dems. Quit drinking the kool-aid Sharon. You Reps are tripping harder than doses you could get at Dead shows in the 60's.  https://t.co/SaR6yf1gw2
1313537453836435457 2020-10-07 01:51:47 +0800 <gnphshn> @Acosta If he does and the press is there PLEASE put up a plexiglass wall between you and him. His spit flys everywhere when he talks.
1313482592218423298 2020-10-06 22:13:47 +0800 <gnphshn> @unleashthetea @TeamTrump Haha..you people crack me up üòÅ Thanks for the morning laugh. Much needed after the shit show performance we witnessed yesterday at the White House.
1313476891005775872 2020-10-06 21:51:08 +0800 <gnphshn> @SharonT93609709 @BrandonStraka I realize that Sharon. That's the point I'm trying to make. The Trump administration and Trump have tried to claim it's a hoax us Dems made up. Trump now knows first hand it's not a hoax.
1313337898184261633 2020-10-06 12:38:50 +0800 <gnphshn> @mikeylouer I wear my mask every day and I'm grateful for it. I made some of these last year to wear while Im snowboarding (~):-}  https://t.co/rdurPxh910
1313335170188013568 2020-10-06 12:27:59 +0800 <gnphshn> This is the best Umpa Lumpa costume I've seen so far this year!  https://t.co/Rf3BzlRxnb
1313333600935317506 2020-10-06 12:21:45 +0800 <gnphshn> @gtconway3d He looks like an orange balloon filled with too much nitrous and ready to burst. What a waste of good nitrous.
1313329879069290498 2020-10-06 12:06:58 +0800 <gnphshn> @reedgalen @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump He looks like he's about to pass out with every breath he struggles to take.
1313329574403424257 2020-10-06 12:05:45 +0800 <gnphshn> @BrandonStraka Haha..that's funny Brando. He's struggling to breathe. Have you watched his videos? Hospice tends to let those who are near the end go home. If the hoax doesn't do what it's done to the 210,000+ Americans he turned his back on, the combo of harsh meds will. #Notlookinghealthy
1313303742716944384 2020-10-06 10:23:06 +0800 <gnphshn> @GOP You didn't add them. They came back when some businesses reopened.
1313303415691255809 2020-10-06 10:21:48 +0800 <gnphshn> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump He sounds and looks like he's dying minute by minute according to his video he posted. You need to quit lying Lindsey. You already got pounded for it the other night at your debate. I've seen 5th graders debate better than you. #Jaimeownsyou
1313302276925136897 2020-10-06 10:17:17 +0800 <gnphshn> @robreiner At this point we might as well let him hold as many rallies and gathering as possible. By Nov. 3rd there wont be any Trump supporters left to vote in person because they'll be quarantined, hospitalized or in the ground.
1313298401035841536 2020-10-06 10:01:53 +0800 <gnphshn> @CaroleRadziwill @ProjectLincoln It's a struggle to watch him struggle to breathe. Those steroids really made him blow up too. He really looks like an orange now.
1313298003004858370 2020-10-06 10:00:18 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump Listen to the scientists and not the current corrupt President who caught the hoax due to his negligence.
1313265370145320961 2020-10-06 07:50:38 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump looks pretty swollen..like he's been injected with a mass amount of steroids and some other non-FDA approved drugs.
1313263002473250816 2020-10-06 07:41:13 +0800 <gnphshn> @Olivianuzzi @ErinMPerrine He also picked out a nice state of the art rolling coffin he rode in the other day.
1313262238803718145 2020-10-06 07:38:11 +0800 <gnphshn> @donwinslow Last I saw they were still both unfit.
1313261235484450817 2020-10-06 07:34:12 +0800 <gnphshn> Can we, the American People, build a plexiglass wall around the White House to contain the virus? We can steal some of Trump's tax dollars he owes to fund it.
1313260630397255680 2020-10-06 07:31:48 +0800 <gnphshn> @pkentma @OperationMAGA @TrumpWarRoom @CortesSteve @JoeBiden Are you a robot?
1313260438608437248 2020-10-06 07:31:02 +0800 <gnphshn> @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump You're an absolute idiot arent you. He's so pumped with drugs right now he's competing with Jr. Let's see how healthy he is after all of the steroids, etc fully take affect on his body.
1313259833831747584 2020-10-06 07:28:38 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump You're a real POS and deserve whatever happens.
1313259385464913920 2020-10-06 07:26:51 +0800 <gnphshn> @JoeBiden Please get your adds back up and running.
1313258816868237312 2020-10-06 07:24:35 +0800 <gnphshn> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Too bad you cant stand beside him because of your own sickness. Remember who gave it to you and think to yourself if he really even cares about you.
1313189046345256967 2020-10-06 02:47:21 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln Liar!
1313188863448420352 2020-10-06 02:46:37 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump You're an absolute hypocrite!
1313158424994050050 2020-10-06 00:45:40 +0800 <gnphshn> @joshtpm He actually reminded me of one of the old men that sits in the balcony in the Muppets.
1313157454973202432 2020-10-06 00:41:49 +0800 <gnphshn> I wonder how many other Rep. Senators have actually tested positive but have been told to keep quiet out of fear of not being able to push the SCJ through. It's not about saving lives..its all politically based to help a SOCIOPATH uphold his image.
1313153354776735753 2020-10-06 00:25:31 +0800 <gnphshn> @TheRickWilson Someone else must be using his account.
1313150412917104640 2020-10-06 00:13:50 +0800 <gnphshn> @Babsdune @OperationMAGA @ProjectLincoln I smell pure desperation reading Trump's tweets this morning. I wonder if he had a reality check when he was riding in his state of the art rolling casket yesterday.
1313149593131970570 2020-10-06 00:10:34 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump you're tweets smell of pure desperation! You'll tell your voters anything now just to try and keep their votes. You lost this presidency to your hoax! Be prepared to move out Nov. 4th.
1312968105077862401 2020-10-05 12:09:24 +0800 <gnphshn> @OperationMAGA
1312965831333048320 2020-10-05 12:00:22 +0800 <gnphshn> I just purchased a Lindsey Graham. It cost me a lot of money and didn't do shit for me.  https://t.co/PsBSOBgsJe
1312964201812357122 2020-10-05 11:53:54 +0800 <gnphshn> @maggieNYT @gtconway3d Looks like a rolling casket. Many prayers to the secret service members who drew the shorts straws and had to put themselves in harm's way.
1312960972932308994 2020-10-05 11:41:04 +0800 <gnphshn> @ComfortablySmug He rode around like a mobile virus potentially infecting the poor secret services agents who had to be in the rolling casket with him. He also looks so much older and weathered without his orange make-up. Oh wait..that's the hoax kicking his ass.
1312959637801463810 2020-10-05 11:35:45 +0800 <gnphshn> @Yamiche I'm projecting confidence that @realDonaldTrump will be defeated Nov. 3rd.
1312897605609943041 2020-10-05 07:29:16 +0800 <gnphshn> @OperationMAGA What a desperate little man. He looks a lot older without his orange skin tanner.
1312837654279450626 2020-10-05 03:31:02 +0800 <gnphshn> @OperationMAGA OPERATION MURDER!!
1312837382022918144 2020-10-05 03:29:57 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Shouldnt you be more concerned about what's happening at the hospital? Even if we don't like you're daddy we're still concerned. I'd be outside the hospital waiting for updates instead of promoting trash like you always do. Your inheritance may be in jeopardy Jr.
1312836423960023040 2020-10-05 03:26:09 +0800 <gnphshn> @OperationMAGA Why because they tell the truth while your MAGA cohorts lie as much as they can?

1312616401706782722 2020-10-04 12:51:52 +0800 <gnphshn> @nycsouthpaw Is he back to the old "Alabama was in the hurricane path" sharpie trick again or is he tracing his ekg printout?
1312609456438427649 2020-10-04 12:24:16 +0800 <gnphshn> @stuartpstevens @TheRickWilson @IvankaTrump Brown-noser! We know Eric would put the inheritance towards their Russian loans and We nose Donald Junior would just blow it all!
1312607917418319873 2020-10-04 12:18:09 +0800 <gnphshn> @JenniferJJacobs @gtconway3d We dont want him to stay in the White House either!
1312607302885625856 2020-10-04 12:15:42 +0800 <gnphshn> @AOC Rumor has it Trump will be signing an executive order to have the Statue of Liberty replaced with a statue of him because he cant handle a lady of power getting more attention than him. #yourockAOC
1312606165419716609 2020-10-04 12:11:11 +0800 <gnphshn> @jeanmalarkey @rumpfshaker @JimSwiftDC @Mediaite Can we steal some military funding to help build the wall?
1312605850033250309 2020-10-04 12:09:56 +0800 <gnphshn> @fernand80445942 @rumpfshaker @Mediaite I believe he was out getting tested for balls. His test came back negative. Apparently Trump had signed an executive order, prior to getting sick with the hoax, to have them removed. Same thing happened to Mitch M.
1312605091279499264 2020-10-04 12:06:55 +0800 <gnphshn> @cpcp0141 @kdo88 @rumpfshaker @Mediaite @harrisonjaime Had to have it shipped in because the last president left the plexiglass cupboard empty. It's up to each state to supply their own plexiglass not the President or the government.
1312603662552715264 2020-10-04 12:01:14 +0800 <gnphshn> If Trump has made "substantial improvements" then he must have been near death yesterday because it was obvious today in his video he was struggling with his breathing, he was gray/pale (natural look without orange cream?)and had to lean on on the table while reading a script.
1312502962762117120 2020-10-04 05:21:06 +0800 <gnphshn> It's the end of the Trump Presidency as we know it and I feel fine.

Dont forget how your dad treats others and then expect us to provide sympathy when he's sick.
1312236720860004352 2020-10-03 11:43:09 +0800 <gnphshn> @TravisAllen02 Is he playing with his putter and balls?

1312174191047708672 2020-10-03 07:34:40 +0800 <gnphshn> @TuckerCarlson so Covid 19 is still a hoax right? They just took your daddy Trump to the hospital after testing positive with "the hoax"
1312100185812606976 2020-10-03 02:40:36 +0800 <gnphshn> @danielsgoldman Unless you attended a Grateful Dead show (~):-}
1312099715572404224 2020-10-03 02:38:44 +0800 <gnphshn> @BuckSexton Jr's daddy made fun of @HillaryClinton 4 years ago to the day for having pneumonia and @realDonaldTrump mocked her profusely about it. I guess Karma's a real bitch huh?
1312044671439441921 2020-10-02 23:00:00 +0800 <gnphshn> @CNN @gtconway3d By the way you still owe me $421 million and I'll expect to get paid no matter what. Hope you start feeling better.
1312043604076982274 2020-10-02 22:55:46 +0800 <gnphshn> @chelseahandler 2 liters of bleach and a colonoscopy of bright light should take care of it.
1312042054751416320 2020-10-02 22:49:37 +0800 <gnphshn> @tobykeith I sure could use an inspirational song about America right about now.

1311918341720858624 2020-10-02 14:38:01 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Did you finally kill that last kilo?
1311917666043490305 2020-10-02 14:35:20 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump @gtconway3d @FLOTUS 2 liters of bleach and a colonoscopy using bright light might do the trick.
1311914977104543745 2020-10-02 14:24:39 +0800 <gnphshn> @QTAnon1 @RexChapman Says the person who puts all of their beliefs in a pig farmer. Small minds think alike.
1311912873711398913 2020-10-02 14:16:17 +0800 <gnphshn> @RexChapman bring it little man.
1311910183396753413 2020-10-02 14:05:36 +0800 <gnphshn> @gtconway3d Now with his positive test it may be out of his control if he goes anywhere again.
1311793577995894784 2020-10-02 06:22:15 +0800 <gnphshn> @SenTedCruz Did one of your kids make this for you? Btw..didn't Trump disrespect you and your wife a few years ago?
1311790544243154945 2020-10-02 06:10:12 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Jr you complain about everything on twitter. Do you actually have a real job during the day or is this your job?

1311711906273529857 2020-10-02 00:57:43 +0800 <gnphshn> @GOPLeader Because Trump destroyed it these past 4 years.
1311682302288650243 2020-10-01 23:00:05 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump They're his illegitimate children.
1311681946469109760 2020-10-01 22:58:40 +0800 <gnphshn> @AriFleischer @DonaldJTrumpJr That's because the protesters are still wearing masks you morons!
1311526673964171264 2020-10-01 12:41:40 +0800 <gnphshn> @GabbyOrr_ @gtconway3d @DougDeason Tell him not to blow so many lines of adderall prior to stepping on the stage. If you listen, he's a bit stuffy at first because of the swollen nasal passages, then he starts sweating profusely and finally cant slow down long enough to form complete sentences.
1311525088705961984 2020-10-01 12:35:22 +0800 <gnphshn> @benshapiro You shouldn't talk about yourself like that Ben.
1311521986011521025 2020-10-01 12:23:03 +0800 <gnphshn> @RudyGiuliani The American people feel Trump's prison sentence should be longer than that.
1311420674607472640 2020-10-01 05:40:28 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump You'll always be the Master Debater in your own house.
1311420359271358464 2020-10-01 05:39:13 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden ate your lunch last night and you know it.
1311375640961208328 2020-10-01 02:41:31 +0800 <gnphshn> @JoeBiden you're Joe Cool to us supporters. Remain calm and speak  clearly. Let Trump act like a 3rd grader and let him implode. Dont let him get under your skin. That's the only way he can debate. Speak to the camera and the American people not him. You got this #Biden2020
1311325941700804609 2020-09-30 23:24:02 +0800 <gnphshn> @BillKristol That they can hide their inadequacies by carrying long barrel guns. I used to dress up in camo gear and run around in the woods when I was 8.
1311325390665728000 2020-09-30 23:21:51 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump "your people" should show up to vote in person and leave. We dont need your degenerate proud boy sons thinking they can stand at the polls, showing their inadequacies, by carrying the longest guns they can find and trying to intimidate other voters.
1311179212535951360 2020-09-30 13:40:59 +0800 <gnphshn> @guypbenson @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump proved to all Americans tonight that he'll only support things that are white.
1311177404363071488 2020-09-30 13:33:48 +0800 <gnphshn> @TayFromCA @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden ate your lunch tonight.
1311176882868502528 2020-09-30 13:31:44 +0800 <gnphshn> @TimMurtaugh @DonaldJTrumpJr Your daddy just admitted, on national television, that's exactly what he's been doing this whole time by confirming 204 judges. Isnt that what you call packing?
1311157722109243392 2020-09-30 12:15:35 +0800 <gnphshn> @Naturals @AlaricBalth @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr You guys and your earbud theories..you crack me up. Maybe Trump should consider an earbud next time instead of acting and looking like someone on a 2 day bender sweating bullets and rambling. Right Jr.
1311156992199671809 2020-09-30 12:12:41 +0800 <gnphshn> @AlaricBalth @JordanSchachtel @DonaldJTrumpJr You could see the adderall oozing from Trump's pores and forming white lines in the orange creases on his forehead. Don Jr knows what I'm talking about..CYN!
1311155699188023296 2020-09-30 12:07:33 +0800 <gnphshn> @ronysbane @Redpainter1 @gtconway3d Says the person who probably supports the proud girls and their new 3rd grade logo they came up with. Didn't the Republicans just make shirts with Notorious ACB on them? How original.
1311154525542129666 2020-09-30 12:02:53 +0800 <gnphshn> If you make these I'll wear it when I vote in person in case any idiot proud boys decide to show up.
1311153975010324482 2020-09-30 12:00:42 +0800 <gnphshn> @Z0Phn @Redpainter1 I definitely want one of these if they're made.
1311150839231213568 2020-09-30 11:48:14 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump beat himself on national television tonight like he does at home.
1311150549958500353 2020-09-30 11:47:05 +0800 <gnphshn> @kayleighmcenany @DonaldJTrumpJr Why does Eric and Don Jr's wife and girlfriend get paid for not really doing anything?
1311148994341429248 2020-09-30 11:40:54 +0800 <gnphshn> @MeidasTouch Nice 3rd grade artwork. If they fight like they design t-shirts I'm not concerned about them.
1311148667860992001 2020-09-30 11:39:37 +0800 <gnphshn> @tayhatmaker Fuck the proud boys

1311134047536443393 2020-09-30 10:41:31 +0800 <gnphshn> This was a disgrace because of Trump.
1311133854787235840 2020-09-30 10:40:45 +0800 <gnphshn> @gtconway3d I tried to drink whenever Trump interrupted and passed out 3 times.
1311127961651748864 2020-09-30 10:17:20 +0800 <gnphshn> Chris Wallace needs to find his balls because he's definitely afraid of doing his job cutting agent orange off!!
1311126620808257536 2020-09-30 10:12:00 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln You're just as high as the President is right now if you truly believe what you just said. Trump is acting like a rabid dog strung out on adderall.
1311126148588294144 2020-09-30 10:10:08 +0800 <gnphshn> It's not @joebidens job to call the governors, etc. Its the job of the President. Joe will take care of the issues after Nov. 3rd.
1311125617413255168 2020-09-30 10:08:01 +0800 <gnphshn> Chris Wallace needs to do his job and tell Trump to shut up!
1311124895808409600 2020-09-30 10:05:09 +0800 <gnphshn> @LarrySabato @gtconway3d Its difficult to have a battle of wits against an unarmed opponent! #Biden2020

1311119765641940993 2020-09-30 09:44:46 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln He's sweating so bad I can see the adderall he blew seeping out of his pores and forming lines again in the creases of his orange forehead.
1311116893986594816 2020-09-30 09:33:21 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump will you please shut the fuck up! The adderall is pumping through you like high octane fuel and you're sounding like an absolute moron!

1311114406571335680 2020-09-30 09:23:28 +0800 <gnphshn> @TheRickWilson He cant shut up because of the adderall he blew before he took the stage.

1308821783559180289 2020-09-24 01:33:24 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln "thousands" of trump supporters at his recent rallies equals potentionally "thousands" of voters who wont be available to vote on Nov. 3rd due to hospitalization, quarantine or death. Keep the rallies going Trump!
1308045242310909954 2020-09-21 22:07:42 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Hey dickhead..isnt that exactly what your daddy's been doing the last 4 years? Packing the courts for his own political gain? He just said it again the other night.

1307045201240821761 2020-09-19 03:53:54 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump Did he call you personally and tell you he would take away all guns from residents living in Virginia?
1306983548411207681 2020-09-18 23:48:55 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump Why do you continue to call people names? Are you a 3rd grader? Bullies on the playgrounds eventually end up getting what they deserve.

1306464810771587072 2020-09-17 13:27:38 +0800 <gnphshn> @fliesc1 @EricLloyd @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden If you dont believe they work that's your choice to wear it or not to wear it. Just make sure to please stay out of my county. I live near 7 major ski resorts and we wear masks nearly year round. Before covid I dont know of any locals who'd gotten sick just by wearing a mask.
1306460832956469249 2020-09-17 13:11:50 +0800 <gnphshn> @fliesc1 @EricLloyd @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden Feel free to continue going to rallies because its you're right and it's the American thing to do. If Joe Biden decides to hold a rally tomorrow I wont be attending because it's my choice. Are you talking about the same CDC doctors on the front line are starting to question?
1306456625822142465 2020-09-17 12:55:07 +0800 <gnphshn> @fliesc1 @EricLloyd @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden He cares only about himself. You'll see soon enough. You can blame the media all you want and all the conspiracy theories as well. Quit drinking the kool aid. I'm not a rich person. Im average like most but I'd still give if someone was in need. Would your leader?
1306434642761801729 2020-09-17 11:27:45 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Says the bear who looks like it just ripped a chalky fat one with the speaker next to him. Both you and the bear have the biggest shit eating grins on your faces and buldging blacked  out eyes.
1306430464618504194 2020-09-17 11:11:09 +0800 <gnphshn> @EricLloyd @DonaldJTrumpJr Thank you for making this election win easier for @JoeBiden. Most of your supporters will probably be in the hospital, in quarantine or in the ground by Nov. 3rd because they love getting close to each other. Please tell daddy to keep having gatherings in the red states.
1306428577550802944 2020-09-17 11:03:39 +0800 <gnphshn> @LizRNC @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump He has to try and make it great again because he dropped the Big ten football and screwed it up these past 4 years. What kind of President says Make America great and then at the end of his term has to say Make America great again. Couldnt keep it great the first time?
1306426852865503232 2020-09-17 10:56:48 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr What did your daddy do when he was hanging out with Mr. Epstein and didn't your daddy once say he would date Ivanka if she wasnt his daughter?
1306425838246588416 2020-09-17 10:52:46 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Dont forget who your daddy is and his close ties with Mr. Epstein. Ted Cruz seems to be very interested in the show. Is there something we dont know yet that may come out sooner or later?
1306424879017672704 2020-09-17 10:48:58 +0800 <gnphshn> CONGRATULATIONS @realDonaldTrump I heard earlier tonight that instead of being a real President youve now become a scientist. Did you happen to stay at a Holiday Inn Express recently?
1306384250191654919 2020-09-17 08:07:31 +0800 <gnphshn> @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump And most were put back into poverty your daddy's 4th year!

1306372083388219392 2020-09-17 07:19:10 +0800 <gnphshn> @SenRonJohnson and yet again through your video you show just how much of a naive incompetent senator you are for the state of Wisconsin. I feel sorry for the cheeseheads who actually depend on you to represent them.
1306242362897645574 2020-09-16 22:43:42 +0800 <gnphshn> @DonaldJTrumpJr Look at the 17 yr old white supremacist in possession of an AR-15 illegally driving across state lines and killing people. You seem to enjoy everything white..check your nose.

1306238321635463168 2020-09-16 22:27:39 +0800 <gnphshn> @GOPLeader @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Why do you have to do it again if you already made it so great? Obviously you realize you screwed everything up and you're basically asking for a do over..not going to happen. You had your chance and you pissed it away! #DumpTrump2020
1306237716443459591 2020-09-16 22:25:14 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump You didn't help this you narcissist! Quit trying to take all the glory when something good happens and blame others when things go bad! Thanks for ruining the United States and making us an embarrassment world wide!

You're a NED!

1305695581646385152 2020-09-15 10:30:59 +0800 <gnphshn> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Ask adderall Don in "The People's White House" to present his first. You sound like a real idiot asking for something your dictator has been too scared to show us true American people for 4 years. #Voteforjaimeharrison
1305693055693934592 2020-09-15 10:20:57 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump nobody wants to hear from you regarding the NFL and players kneeling for what they believe in. You should be more worried about the people you murdered due the the virus, our shitty economy you caused and what moving company you'll be using Nov. 4th!
1305570267679219712 2020-09-15 02:13:02 +0800 <gnphshn> @TomCottonAR Did @JoeBiden call you personally and tell you he would be sending jobs to China when he's elected? If not then quit spreading "fake news" like our idiot in chief in "The People's White House"
1305510568858583042 2020-09-14 22:15:49 +0800 <gnphshn> @GOPChairwoman you do realize that Trump is the idiot who is killing people daily as our so called "President" right? @JoeBiden isnt at fault for Trumps virus inadequacies. @JoeBiden will take care of the US once adderall Don and the rest of the swamp including you are gone.
1305509506453913600 2020-09-14 22:11:36 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump please remind your disciple Ronna that you are the President who damaged the US the last 4 years and that @JoeBiden will be the next President cleaning up your shit and actually draining your swamp.
1305508125240221696 2020-09-14 22:06:06 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump so let me get this straight. You're losing your re-election campaign so you're resorting back to bashing Hillary Clinton? It must really bother you how President Obama owns you and you can't do anything about itüòÅ
1305163182101557248 2020-09-13 23:15:26 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump looking forward to watching @JoeBiden embarrass you in the upcoming debates. His campaign and the American people know that it's easy to win a battle of wits against an unarmed opponent.
1304522307092709376 2020-09-12 04:48:49 +0800 <gnphshn> @greggutfeld You're an absolute fear monger! You actually think Dems will commit murder if Trump wins? His white supremacist hate groups have already proven their ready to shoot people now. Look at Kenosha. BTW the 17 yr old was in possession of an AR15 illegally! #NRAATFAULT
1304448249189736450 2020-09-11 23:54:32 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump Fortunate son was the perfect song for you yesterday #bonespursdraftdodger
1304271133093527553 2020-09-11 12:10:44 +0800 <gnphshn> @ProjectLincoln Rumor has it that Donald Trump Jr is currently working on an endorsement deal with coke.
1304264143910862849 2020-09-11 11:42:58 +0800 <gnphshn> @seanhannity You are an absolute moron!! I can't believe how much ass you kiss when it comes to our idiot in chief in the "people's white house"! You might want to get up off of your knees before you wear holes in the your pants. You're a disgrace to media reporting.

1301357303849861120 2020-09-03 11:12:13 +0800 <gnphshn> Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo inspired kids to throw down the cardboard and let their inner spirit of dance flow. Too bad some weekend warriors who need to arm themselves head to toe before going outside can't pick an original name. #boogaloo  https://t.co/6rxN8R9e52
1301331549170720768 2020-09-03 09:29:53 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump so what you're saying is that you want all North Carolina people to illegally vote twice to test your personal theory? How about you vote twice from Florida because we all know you break the law constantly anyways. Are you sure you didn't have mini strokes?
1301201366208004096 2020-09-03 00:52:35 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump drug testing before the debates. Does that include testing you for adderall and Jr and his girlfriend for cocaine?
1301185190644060161 2020-09-02 23:48:18 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump you couldn't get the true owner of a business in WI to pose with you so you bring in the previous owner..you're a joke! Also, your "wife" used a personal email at the people's White House. Make sure your boy Barr locks her up!!!!
1300914535038156800 2020-09-02 05:52:49 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump of course you'll defend your 17 year old militia fan who was carrying an AR 15 ILLEGALLY and you'll defend the cop who shot Jacob in the back because  jacob "probably" had a weapon and Kyle "probably" would have died. We all "probably" think youre a race monger!!
1300799559426215937 2020-09-01 22:15:57 +0800 <gnphshn> @Jim_Jordan @ToddHolste You really are a moron arent you.

1300798590088933384 2020-09-01 22:12:06 +0800 <gnphshn> @kylegriffin1 Those paintballs, when someone freezes them before using them, become lethal projectiles. Pretty sure Trumps militia kids weren't shooting normal paintballs.
1300797716084092929 2020-09-01 22:08:37 +0800 <gnphshn> @mmpadellan Dont forget the fact that he's a minor (17) who was walking around illegally with an AR-15.
1300796776484462592 2020-09-01 22:04:53 +0800 <gnphshn> @realDonaldTrump Paintballs dont kill people unless your militia kids freeze them first. Once frozen they become lethal projectiles! Are you that much of a moron?
1300785307617390593 2020-09-01 21:19:19 +0800 <gnphshn> @TuckerCarlson Why hasn't the DOJ pressed charges against you for spreading intentional lies to the public from behind your little desk?
