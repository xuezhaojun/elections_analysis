I hope he lives a long and healthy life, witnessing his own sad legacy for years to come.

1323371974983360513 2020-11-03 05:10:40 +0800 <Oihani2> @crewguyks I doubt you can "educate" them. It sounds like they're deep into conspiracy theories and right-wing nuttery.

1323371212194615297 2020-11-03 05:07:38 +0800 <Oihani2> @LizSkelton There's only one place (the county Board of Elections) per county for people to early vote; hence, the long lines.   Your precinct voting location will have a LOT fewer citizens voting there.   Just in case, come prepared for a line (water, snack, chair/umbrella if needed, etc.)

How would you recommend answering people who say that type of thing? #askVoteForAmerica

The fetus was thought to not truly have "life" until the quickening, in the view of British law for centuries. The quickening, or independent movement of the fetus in the womb, happens at 15-20 weeks.
1307764878069895168 2020-09-21 03:33:38 +0800 <Oihani2> @NunnariJohn @MikeDeWine You mean, "open the state and sicken and kill thousands of innocent human beings." There, I fixed it for you.
