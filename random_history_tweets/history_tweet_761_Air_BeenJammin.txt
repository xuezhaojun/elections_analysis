1335711565983649792 2020-12-07 06:23:48 +0800 <Air_BeenJammin> @elnoramoon_ I’m not talking about making new friends, I don’t think that’s anyone’s goal lol your not 10. I’m talking about keeping the ones that you have.
1335695163721736193 2020-12-07 05:18:37 +0800 <Air_BeenJammin> @elnoramoon_ Reread my tweet. U arent the only one that had a bad year. Everyone has. U can level up without isolation thats all Im saying. In ways it can be more harmful than helpful. If U only care to communicate about business and not interpersonal shit, U wont have friends only associates
1335674392232288257 2020-12-07 03:56:05 +0800 <Air_BeenJammin> @elnoramoon_ You ONLY got time for your man and business? I know 2020 was rough for all of us but social isolation isn’t the answer, that’s usually sends people further into the dark. You can be about your business and still be social. But when you’re ALL Business, it comes off as insincere.
