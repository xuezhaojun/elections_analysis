1337838635941564418 2020-12-13 03:16:01 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> Cyberpunk 2077 story in a nutshell: I'm in an abusive relationship with the science fiction terrorist who lives rent free inside my head.

1334824837785788416 2020-12-04 19:40:15 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> My bank decided to surprise close my account and hold my money hostage and won't even tell me why.
1331027526680981506 2020-11-24 08:11:06 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> @BootlegGirl The Mass Effect trilogy are some of favorite video games of all time... but you're right and you should say it. The adventures of bisexual trans-FemShep may hold a special place in my heart, but the vast majority of people settled for John Everyman sleeps with space-isolationist.

1325098807915327488 2020-11-07 23:32:29 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> Oh wow, I pocket-tweeted a draft from months ago and it was oddly prophetic

1323853416981057539 2020-11-04 13:03:45 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> News stations do NOT have the final word in the election. MSNBC does not decide the election. Fox News doesn't decide the election. CNN doesn't decide the election. Nor does Politico / NPR / Google / TYT / etc. / etc. People decide elections. #CountEveryVote and buckle up, folks.

1321972367980113920 2020-10-30 08:29:08 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> Downloaded the Hyrule Warriors demo... is it just me or is this game not optimized very well?

I think some of my aunts and uncles (possibly some of my cousins unclear(?)) don't really accept it but are too polite to say anything about it to me directly.

1319435388059045895 2020-10-23 08:28:05 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> That they cut one of the best sequences which left a noticeable hole in the narrative through-line.

1314302553836982276 2020-10-09 04:32:02 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> @TheDoctorYT2 @NintendoAmerica Calm tf down. Game development is a long and difficult process. BOTW2 is at least a year or two away (BOTW itself took about six years). We're now getting double the canonical Zelda content and you're mad that the one you want isn't done yet?
1314301046781620225 2020-10-09 04:26:02 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> @Shoyoumomo_ Yeah... Age of Calamity looks *way* better than the original Hyrule Warriors, IMO.  I was already hoping that BotW2 was going to be a prequel rather than direct sequel and now I'm excited that we get to have *both*.

1309668683451699200 2020-09-26 09:38:41 +0800 <NotoriousROZ> @BootlegGirl I played TLOUP2 twice and I can't remember who Emily is... is she one of Abby's friends that gets unceremoniously murdered?
