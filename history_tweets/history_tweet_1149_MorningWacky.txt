Youre makingan excuse for a low life agitator. And from what i remember there was an initial gunshot fired, not perhaps at Kyle himself but any gunfire would be a bad sign to him that something was up

I think he a heard a round pop off and fired at pedophile lunatic who was chasing him in what was surely a split second action. Even after doing so he tried to get help before more lunatics swarmed on him.
