1306015041867710466 2020-09-16 07:40:25 +0800 <MJuleii> @Marco_T_Cicero Amazing footage.
1305719614609842176 2020-09-15 12:06:29 +0800 <MJuleii> @PanzerShock It’s almost hard to believe it happened.  We live in an inverse of this today.
1305558902763712513 2020-09-15 01:27:53 +0800 <MJuleii> @stone_toss I needed to hear this today.
1305006348472516609 2020-09-13 12:52:13 +0800 <MJuleii> @oldTOseries @oldcanadaseries The world was better before the automobile.
1304935827131179008 2020-09-13 08:12:00 +0800 <MJuleii> @ChargerConcave @CrasTalk @CBCNews Blacks aren’t here to entertain whites or to serve them.  Whites have a duty to boycott black entertainment and services.  Imagine being ok with blacks serving you like it’s 1820.
1304918034163802112 2020-09-13 07:01:18 +0800 <MJuleii> @INChick @mattyglesias You probably don’t have children.
1304898519057096704 2020-09-13 05:43:45 +0800 <MJuleii> @0zmnds Who made this?  It’s amazing!
1304236807001759744 2020-09-11 09:54:20 +0800 <MJuleii> @CBCNews It’s so weird that these guys in the picture are “from” Canada.
1304234304151535616 2020-09-11 09:44:24 +0800 <MJuleii> @LanceBriggs Non blacks should boycott all black entertainment.
1304098960877912065 2020-09-11 00:46:35 +0800 <MJuleii> @leefer3 @rgpoulussen @MadocLeonard They were brave but it’s sad, that in the end, they fought to destroy not only European civilization but whites everywhere.
1302710906380414976 2020-09-07 04:50:57 +0800 <MJuleii> @CBCIndigenous Isn’t bannock Scottish?  Romans were eating it at Hadrians wall in the 2nd century.
1302709894110310400 2020-09-07 04:46:56 +0800 <MJuleii> @TPinterman @CBCNews African.
1302461798818299904 2020-09-06 12:21:06 +0800 <MJuleii> @JC_4633 This is true for me also.
1302361222382104577 2020-09-06 05:41:26 +0800 <MJuleii> @Mag_Aodhgain17 @lugh____ We will be lead by a hologram Hitler in the wars to come.
1302313726041714693 2020-09-06 02:32:42 +0800 <MJuleii> @FollowerMosley @BlackshirtBen Forgive my ignorance but what is the strap attached to the belt called?
1302083885602230273 2020-09-05 11:19:24 +0800 <MJuleii> @therealtv2 @AngeloJohnGage This is what the communists did.  The SA was a response to that.
1302046180944130048 2020-09-05 08:49:35 +0800 <MJuleii> @globalstreetart @Lukesmile91 How embarrassing.
1302026174583906304 2020-09-05 07:30:05 +0800 <MJuleii> @Erika71927576 Imagine even the most “progressive” lefty arguing that America and China should be running the world instead of Germany and Japan.  It’s only the nonstop atrocity propaganda that makes anyone think the good guys won ww2.
1302024547755982849 2020-09-05 07:23:37 +0800 <MJuleii> @MaxModerator It’s fucking weird from a gen x perspective as well.  I think that they were instilled with pop culture values only so in a way it’s them showing their piety.
1302023093720768512 2020-09-05 07:17:50 +0800 <MJuleii> @AryanAmerican @TheNewVermonter It did take from all world cultures and blended them into something new though.  There are Inca, Islamic and Egyptian styled Art Deco buildings as well.
1301993974434074624 2020-09-05 05:22:08 +0800 <MJuleii> @IanWhee11560304 @CBCAlerts @CBCNews He does work hard for the Jews.
1301993520534708224 2020-09-05 05:20:19 +0800 <MJuleii> @iblogdogs @CBCAlerts It’s all code, the women aren’t white or they would have stated it.
1301730066292908032 2020-09-04 11:53:27 +0800 <MJuleii> @LeighStewy 10 minutes ago I was upset he was interviewed by vice!
1301542119505444864 2020-09-03 23:26:37 +0800 <MJuleii> @PagliacciDorati I hate what Canada has turned into.
1300974361768128512 2020-09-02 09:50:33 +0800 <MJuleii> @FrenRight @hfahcl Do they really have that little control over themselves or are they acting?
1300904651814961152 2020-09-02 05:13:33 +0800 <MJuleii> @oldcanadaseries It’s so sad to see what has happened to Vancouver.
1300903475459497984 2020-09-02 05:08:52 +0800 <MJuleii> @MattWalshBlog No one actually cares about cultural appropriation, it is just another bludgeon to hit white people with.
1300847253116973056 2020-09-02 01:25:28 +0800 <MJuleii> @LeighStewy It’s probably run by )ews.
1300843147887480832 2020-09-02 01:09:09 +0800 <MJuleii> @kairojade77 @CBCNews Haha haha

1300673706029584384 2020-09-01 13:55:51 +0800 <MJuleii> @Philosophi_Cat @adamseconomics Canada is under the communist spell as well.
1300658071367118848 2020-09-01 12:53:43 +0800 <MJuleii> @BeComfy I understand women like this want to lead an exciting life that comes with being somewhat a miracle of nature but it would also be great if they had a large contribution to our gene pool.
1300657259907670023 2020-09-01 12:50:30 +0800 <MJuleii> @JC_4326 @cursedsalad @ManoftheWest3 Yes, and if he really wanted to stand out from his brother he could have been an advocate for actual British people which is some thing the royal family doesn’t seem to have done since at least ww2.
1300655736712642562 2020-09-01 12:44:27 +0800 <MJuleii> @cursedsalad @ManoftheWest3 Harry fucked up so badly.  He could have married a beautiful British girl 10 years younger than him and had tons of kids instead of the American divorcée who is pushing 40.
1300621113945276417 2020-09-01 10:26:52 +0800 <MJuleii> @moodvintage Before the dark times.
1300615510564855809 2020-09-01 10:04:36 +0800 <MJuleii> @CBPolt @surrexi Are you sure that’s a Persian?  He looks pretty white and he has red hair.
1300612785840087040 2020-09-01 09:53:47 +0800 <MJuleii> @Rosecomment @CBCNews 1941 is infinitely better than now.
