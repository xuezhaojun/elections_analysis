1324542697282002944 2020-11-06 10:42:42 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @TimAlberta It seems to me that most trump voters are willfully ignorant, intellectually illiterate, and unserious.
1324540744254648320 2020-11-06 10:34:56 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @TimAlberta I understand your concern but here’s the deal for me: we just spent 4 years of the media trying to understand the trump voters and I just don’t care anymore. The truth is they support a narcissistic sociopath.
1324509972705673216 2020-11-06 08:32:40 +0800 <kelseasgr8> Tell Mr. Baker, does this sound insane to you? Sometimes for the Americans who need their news at first grade level you need to spell it out—-this statement seems at the very least to be massively hypocritical.
1324101922765168641 2020-11-05 05:31:13 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @ChuckRocha Yep. @madrid_mike and you were talking about this weeks ago and there was NO action from the Democrats.

1301005175209906177 2020-09-02 11:52:59 +0800 <kelseasgr8> Oh ffs!! Why don’t we just call it Barr’s Injustice and Propaganda Department now?!!!
1301004455114993664 2020-09-02 11:50:08 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @JohnMLatimer His inability to tell the truth can be confirmed by the fact he’s running for office as a Republican. I believe lying with each breath is now a requirement to be a GOP office holder
1301003740028182528 2020-09-02 11:47:17 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @MollyJongFast I may be late but wanted to report no burning in Seattle tonight except for a beautiful sort of flame orange full moon. Seattle at it’s best!! 🌅

1300794779786072064 2020-09-01 21:56:57 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @blskyblond @ted_rood I hope so because it’s a matter of credibility for me. I think it would be hypocritical to ignore bad behavior in Democrats if I’m criticizing Republicans for the same behavior.
1300642751931801601 2020-09-01 11:52:51 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @KimHawk912 I’m so sorry for your loss. She deserved a better president❤️🙏

1300640492904833026 2020-09-01 11:43:52 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @deanergal @superswowsbros @MeidasTouch There was never a perfect President. We elect humans not deities (although trump is thinking he’s a deity but that’s just narcissism, dementia and too much adderall talking)
1300639747119824897 2020-09-01 11:40:55 +0800 <kelseasgr8> This!! 👇 💯

1300637514865078272 2020-09-01 11:32:02 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @InEveryCorner @atrupar Yeah speaking the truth is a deal breaker if you want to work in the trump administration
1300637242868731904 2020-09-01 11:30:58 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @dithemunchkin @MeidasTouch Let’s hoping we can get a solid 8 hours for a month after Election Day❤️🙏🤞
1300636884071116800 2020-09-01 11:29:32 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @anchorwings @MeidasTouch Yep. Sleepy Susan is all the way in for Sleepy Joe😉😂
1300636621964890113 2020-09-01 11:28:29 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @mb2569 @MeidasTouch Oh me too!! A pit in my stomach since November 2016 (Okay I have to admit to some stress eating too despite the queasy stomach. I blame trump for about a 5 pound weight gain😂)
1300636049568227328 2020-09-01 11:26:13 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @karine808 @MeidasTouch Exactly!!

1300628323215712256 2020-09-01 10:55:31 +0800 <kelseasgr8> @ted_rood Hey thanks Ted!! Country over party (I promise if Democrats ever do this I’ll follow your lead) #BidenHarrisToSaveAmerica
