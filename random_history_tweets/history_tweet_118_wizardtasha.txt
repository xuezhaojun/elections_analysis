Why can‚Äôt people see how negative and evil the Republicans are. No empathy, no concern for anyone but corporations and millionaires. Look at the list above.
1332903769651048450 2020-11-29 12:26:37 +0800 <wizardtasha> @EricTrump We hate your daddy so much it drove those who rarely or never vote to get to the polls. I and my friends worked to get people to vote. Your family, especially your father‚Äôs craziness, increased the number of voters. So yes, Biden got lots more votes.
1332899716959412229 2020-11-29 12:10:31 +0800 <wizardtasha> @laurenhtexas I have a group of friends, some who were undecided. We would watch the MeidasTouch touch videos and discuss. They motivated us to vote, but to also help get others out to vote.  Keep going boys!! @MeidasTouch

We need jobs, food, homes. Anyway, the stock market is up because Biden was elected, not because of anything you did. Just go away!

1327318301685411840 2020-11-14 02:31:58 +0800 <wizardtasha> @S_Pedian @ChuckCallesto He isn‚Äôt doing his job. He‚Äôs pouting and texting. He‚Äôs receiving no security briefings, Corona updates, nothing. So no. We have no leader at the moment.  Dangerous for America right?
1327317002277384193 2020-11-14 02:26:48 +0800 <wizardtasha> @thomaskaine5 NO!!!!!  We‚Äôve suffered for four years. We can make it till the end. He should squirm and suffer.

1327304241589874688 2020-11-14 01:36:05 +0800 <wizardtasha> @nypost This is a ridiculous and dangerous statement. His state is so poor they depend on federal help to survive. He wants to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù from the nation that supports him. Now he wants to ignore riles from that nation that might help his people survive.
1327296962899558400 2020-11-14 01:07:10 +0800 <wizardtasha> @JerbalKeb @DoYouEvenLif Nope. Not joking. He posted it himself, along with a picture!üòÅ
1327294919602364416 2020-11-14 00:59:03 +0800 <wizardtasha> @fraudesswrites @DoYouEvenLif Exactly. They don‚Äôt vote for the President. üòÅ That‚Äôs the problem. He‚Äôs not real bright.
1327118673971212288 2020-11-13 13:18:43 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DoYouEvenLif Don‚Äôt forget Senator John Cornyn‚Äôs claim that there are thousands of uncounted votes found in Puerto Rico.
1327104474830127110 2020-11-13 12:22:17 +0800 <wizardtasha> @donwinslow Don, I‚Äôve always respected you and your help in defeating Trump. But IMO this is harsh.

1327062897772486656 2020-11-13 09:37:05 +0800 <wizardtasha> @MeidasTouch @BryanDawsonUSA Remember he hires only the best. Honey, you make no sense, bless your heart.
1327057305137909762 2020-11-13 09:14:51 +0800 <wizardtasha> @alfonslopeztena @joannachiu I have all these symptoms!!  Geez, I‚Äôm already old. This virus is going to kill me whether I get it or not. Oh well. As long as I live long enough to see Trump dumped, I don‚Äôt care where, just gone and locked in there. I‚Äôll be happy.
1327055008848777216 2020-11-13 09:05:44 +0800 <wizardtasha> @MeidasTouch @BryanDawsonUSA Isn‚Äôt he great. His timing is perfect. He beats Perdue smoothly and shows him for the crook that he is. Classy yet tough. Vote for Jon Ossoff!!!
1327044602579152896 2020-11-13 08:24:23 +0800 <wizardtasha> @AOC Can you please just back off for a while?  At least till we have an opportunity to flip the senate.  Then you can parade and preach away. Please, think of the wile country, not just your own interests.
1327026862996897792 2020-11-13 07:13:53 +0800 <wizardtasha> @Reuters Zuckerberg, another ‚Äúwhite boy with money‚Äù thinks he makes the world turn. I cancelled my Facebook account months ago.

1326944043159281664 2020-11-13 01:44:47 +0800 <wizardtasha> What a sick, disturbed man.
1326935512712531968 2020-11-13 01:10:54 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realTuckFrumper Trump is such an a$$. Not that I care what happens to FOX News. They are the true ‚Äúfake news ‚Äú. His enterprises always fail, his presidency failed, and I‚Äôm sure this news thing will fail. So just resign and go for it. Get out of our way.!!
1326783613699035140 2020-11-12 15:07:18 +0800 <wizardtasha> @Newsweek @MrTAchilles Bye.
1326769753189441536 2020-11-12 14:12:14 +0800 <wizardtasha> @RMGarabedian @PeteButtigieg Pete would do a great job wherever Biden puts him. But as ambassador to the UN, he would shine.
1326765621158227969 2020-11-12 13:55:48 +0800 <wizardtasha> @jfreewright They would never survive on their own. Without the rest of the country supporting them, they would all disappear. Having Republicans running the state has been awful for the people.
1326762444723802112 2020-11-12 13:43:11 +0800 <wizardtasha> @thebr0keb0i Please God, make it so.
1326755563347222528 2020-11-12 13:15:50 +0800 <wizardtasha> @donwinslow @johnrobertsFox FOX news is like Trump. You think they can‚Äôt sink any lower, and then they do. Wow. Pathetic.
1326752490025488384 2020-11-12 13:03:38 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ossoff @Initforfreedom Wow. I don‚Äôt live in Georgia, but I like this guy. He toasted Perdue in their debate, so bad that Perdue chickened out of the second one. This speech shows his intelligence and patriotism.
1326748901345427456 2020-11-12 12:49:22 +0800 <wizardtasha> @MichaelRapaport That‚Äôs OK. Dr Jill can go in blindfolded and do a better job than the M.

1326724585304195076 2020-11-12 11:12:45 +0800 <wizardtasha> @NorskLadyWolf What about the fake protesters they get to pretend and engage them?  We had some of that in Portland and he sent in his ‚Äúspecial‚Äù troops. A disaster.
1326721443787206660 2020-11-12 11:00:16 +0800 <wizardtasha> @donwinslow @johnrobertsFox What a jerk. You and your network are a bunch of traitors.

1326669397356765184 2020-11-12 07:33:27 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump This makes me sick to see him act like he cares. They probably had to pay him extra or bribe him with extra KFC so he would go.

1326667012886593536 2020-11-12 07:23:58 +0800 <wizardtasha> @LindseyGrahamSC I‚Äôm surprised to see you tweet this. You stand behind and support a man who disrespected one of your supposed best friend, McCain. You and your ilk are traitors.
1326403250942320640 2020-11-11 13:55:53 +0800 <wizardtasha> @AOC Can you just back off until after the Georgia runoff. We need the democrats to win. You can preach all you want after that. Please?
1326389683723661312 2020-11-11 13:01:58 +0800 <wizardtasha> @RalstonReports Shameful.
1326366236121288704 2020-11-11 11:28:48 +0800 <wizardtasha> @jennyrachelpal @Juliet_notRomeo @justinamash Definitely treason. He‚Äôs suppose to be going to France and a few other places. Maybe he should just stay gone.
1326350709881667584 2020-11-11 10:27:06 +0800 <wizardtasha> @PattyArquette @MaIkeResists @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I felt much better after Joe‚Äôs presser. We‚Äôve become so accustomed to Trump‚Äôs blathering, it surprises us when our president (I‚Äôm calling Joe that already) actually speaks like a true leader.
1326348305262026755 2020-11-11 10:17:32 +0800 <wizardtasha> @justinhendrix @GSAEmily This @GSAEmily should be held responsible for any losses due to her not doing her job. She may think it‚Äôs loyalty to traitor tRump, but she‚Äôs a subservient apostate.
1326332335902486529 2020-11-11 09:14:05 +0800 <wizardtasha> @Bill_Maxwell_ @MysterySolvent I like it.

His election is the one that needs to be investigated. And if mail in ballots mean Republicans can‚Äôt win, I say we dump the voting machines wherever DeJoy dump the mail sorting machines.

1325953475507744769 2020-11-10 08:08:38 +0800 <wizardtasha> @MoBlueNow @TheRickyDavila This is really disturbing.

1325943552098983937 2020-11-10 07:29:12 +0800 <wizardtasha> @letsliveinpeace @realTuckFrumper I agree.Mitch has done nothing for Kentucky. It is among the lowest rated in education, employment, etc. Is he trying to bring all the states down to Kentucky‚Äôs level. And they keep voting for him. That‚Äôs the election that should be investigated.
1325935443360149504 2020-11-10 06:56:59 +0800 <wizardtasha> @claudia_silver7 This is awful. I‚Äôm concerned if I have trouble somewhere, will the AAA guy just go away because he doesn‚Äôt like me?  We have adopted children of color, will your driver leave them stranded?

1325597552792625152 2020-11-09 08:34:19 +0800 <wizardtasha> @fellachance @realDonaldTrump Yes but Trump has never had any dignity or class.
1325596701705469952 2020-11-09 08:30:56 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump Oh Mr Graham. You‚Äôre never going to recover your soul, are you.
1325594755879763968 2020-11-09 08:23:12 +0800 <wizardtasha> @donwinslow Geez. He looked just as sleezy then as he does now. He never had any class or dignity, did he.
1325591015927869441 2020-11-09 08:08:21 +0800 <wizardtasha> @FLOTUS Does she even write her own stuff?  I bet she doesn‚Äôt understand what democracy means. She definitely is a swimmer in the Trump swamp.

1325321895474950144 2020-11-08 14:18:57 +0800 <wizardtasha> @RzstProgramming These guys are a joke. They all probably peaked in high school, and now they‚Äôre just irrelevant.

1325283979184910339 2020-11-08 11:48:17 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DianaLogue2 @KingYnir LOL. It‚Äôs really going to be funny if he throws something together and tries to say it‚Äôs been complete always.

1325274033957478401 2020-11-08 11:08:46 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DonaldJTrumpJr Loeffler is total Rep grifter.  I watched Jon Ossoff‚Äôs debate with Perdue. Ossify won so bigly. Perdue started out so smug but soon lost it. Then Perdue chickened out of the second debate. Hang in there Jon, we‚Äôre with you.

1324403762434174976 2020-11-06 01:30:37 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews You must have just made this up. If not, you should check your sources.

1319455743460823040 2020-10-23 09:48:58 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DanRather No. I already voted for Biden. My anxiety level is bad and I just can‚Äôt watch the tRumpnut.
1319317114918846464 2020-10-23 00:38:06 +0800 <wizardtasha> @svdate FOX News is the epitome of fake news. It‚Äôs an entertainment network. This is an obvious attempt to aid tRump in the debate tonight. How can anyone believe these nutcases. Give it up FOX.

1313378498401103872 2020-10-06 15:20:10 +0800 <wizardtasha> @brhodes @MarleneFlorkow Did anyone talk about Joe Biden‚Äôs town hall tonight? He was great. It was nice listening to a sane, intelligent man. Helped to calm me down a little, and relieve some of my worries. MSM should realize we‚Äôve had an overload of Trump crazy.

Most of us are not afraid of our country, but of the idiots in power right now. Perhaps you will be welcome wherever the Trumps run to.
1313350842691403777 2020-10-06 13:30:16 +0800 <wizardtasha> @emilyfavreau @Women4Biden A true First Lady. I love her.

1313257702169047040 2020-10-06 07:20:10 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ProjectLincoln It‚Äôs all a big show for him, isn‚Äôt it. Anything to feed his ego. How did our country come to this?  A reality TV con man is destroying our democracy. God help us.

1313135800649805825 2020-10-05 23:15:46 +0800 <wizardtasha> @mmpadellan I‚Äôm waiting for his first ‚ÄúI beat COVID‚Äù tweet. He‚Äôll be strutting around, bragging his recovery was the fastest that anyone has ever seen.
1313131832485924865 2020-10-05 23:00:00 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DanRather Oh Dan. LOL. We love you.
1313130959550574592 2020-10-05 22:56:32 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump How can you say this with your ‚Äúproud boys‚Äù standing by?  Go back to pretending you‚Äôre sick.
1313129869908168706 2020-10-05 22:52:12 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump Bull poo.
1313129678127857665 2020-10-05 22:51:26 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump Wow. All this rage tweeting. I liked it when he was pretending to be sick.
1313128844811886593 2020-10-05 22:48:08 +0800 <wizardtasha> @SovietSergey @realDonaldTrump LOL. You‚Äôre planning to take away social security, Medicare, the ACA, and you have no healthcare plan. The seniors you‚Äôre trying to kill are going to vote you out of office.
1313085152898117635 2020-10-05 19:54:31 +0800 <wizardtasha> @SusanDanzig219 Please, make it so.

1312587840929234944 2020-10-04 10:58:22 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ProjectLincoln But, according to Trump, they are ‚Äúgood people on both sides.‚Äù Gee, another lie.

The fears,  cowering, helplessness.  I was so impressed by Joe Biden and his calm. I tried to concentrate on him. I made it through the debate but had to leave the house and walk.

1311985184984580096 2020-10-02 19:03:38 +0800 <wizardtasha> @H_MitchellPhoto @Gotherrific Oh, please make it so.
1311981259317342208 2020-10-02 18:48:02 +0800 <wizardtasha> @KatyTurNBC @derfderf14 Of course they are. That‚Äôs going to be his miracle cure in two weeks. Deflection.
1311973228961644545 2020-10-02 18:16:07 +0800 <wizardtasha> @WajahatAli @MindyMH Exactly. Can we get a test done on Trump by an impartial doctor or clinic?  This might be diversion.
1311971515773009920 2020-10-02 18:09:19 +0800 <wizardtasha> @sbg1 Excuse me, but America didn‚Äôt botch the response. America was lied to, had information hidden from us, and each state left to struggle on its own. Our ‚Äúleader‚Äù looked the other way and Americans died.
1311938790655553537 2020-10-02 15:59:16 +0800 <wizardtasha> Since Trump has tested positive for COVID, (wink, wink) they will probably put Pence in isolation also. Very convenient. Then he won‚Äôt have to debate Kamala Harris. I was so looking forward to that.
1311928310117490689 2020-10-02 15:17:38 +0800 <wizardtasha> @Joshua4NPV1 @Juliet_notRomeo He nailed it. Fake all the way.

1311919075883249664 2020-10-02 14:40:56 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS This doesn‚Äôt even look like he tweeted it. Someone else did.  1) There‚Äôs no misspelled words 2) it‚Äôs much too calm.  3) it‚Äôs includes someone besides himself. He‚Äôs usually all about him.
1311909967130025984 2020-10-02 14:04:44 +0800 <wizardtasha> @galifornian @LMcfoxtrot @apandahvevo @nlyonne @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Wow I never thought of this. He would do something like pretending there‚Äôs a vaccine.
1311909332905201664 2020-10-02 14:02:13 +0800 <wizardtasha> @LMcfoxtrot @apandahvevo @nlyonne @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I‚Äôm leaning mor toward him faking it now. At first I was giddy with excitement, but the more I think about it, he has some devious plan.
1311903592438136833 2020-10-02 13:39:25 +0800 <wizardtasha> @Mocraig13 @Juliet_notRomeo @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS It does seem very convenient. He will get no sympathy from me or my family  If he‚Äôs faking to say, see COVID is no big deal. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
1311901730276220929 2020-10-02 13:32:01 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ohara_polly @ABC This could be one of the following.  (1 him trying to distract us from what‚Äôs going on around him (2 him trying to get out of the debates 3) he really has it, and no one deserves it more
1311885375984398336 2020-10-02 12:27:01 +0800 <wizardtasha> @Skeelydan @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump I know it‚Äôs not nice to say, but no one deserves to get a really bad case of COVID more than Trump.
1311826722824708096 2020-10-02 08:33:57 +0800 <wizardtasha> @CBSNews So, her book lied this time. Not her.
1311473163679621120 2020-10-01 09:09:02 +0800 <wizardtasha> @RexChapman @JABaloney Trump cares so little for others, he probably hasn‚Äôt noticed that Don Jr is deeply into drugs. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd never support his son through addiction as Joe did with his. He‚Äôd probably kick him to the curb then say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know him‚Äù.

It was vile and cruel of Trump to bring up his dead son and his other son. Shame on Trump. I said in another tweet, this was when Biden became my president.

1311160882093682689 2020-09-30 12:28:09 +0800 <wizardtasha> @MaryLTrump @mmpadellan God forbid, but if I were a Trump supporter, Trump‚Äôs comments about Joe‚Äôs sons would have turned my vote. He might not care for anyone but himself, certainly not his children, but Joe is a great father. Shame on Trump.

1311142272243654657 2020-09-30 11:14:12 +0800 <wizardtasha> @lindyli Yes. Trump is an embarrassment. A vile, poisonous, hate filled creature.
1311141631186231297 2020-09-30 11:11:39 +0800 <wizardtasha> @JeffreyGoldberg @gtconway3d He should turn Trump‚Äôs mic off when he keeps interrupting. He was rude, overly emotional, and obviously never took a debate class in school. Joe has class.
1311140601610424320 2020-09-30 11:07:33 +0800 <wizardtasha> @SDgoes211 Trump was out of control. Biden did right to ask Wallace to intervene. The monitor should be in control of the debate.

1311073500119986176 2020-09-30 06:40:55 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DavidCornDC Demand proof. Like the gal who was spouting nonsense about China barn ballots. Then tell Americans the truth. MSM should not be enabling Trump‚Äôs games.

1311069454747353088 2020-09-30 06:24:51 +0800 <wizardtasha> @1supermomdlb Yes. He‚Äôs broken the law many times before and after he became president. No one is exempt from the law. If for some reason he isn‚Äôt sent to jail, he and his enablers should be exiled. With no presidential benefits; no money, no security. Then call The Hague.

1310824397222027264 2020-09-29 14:11:04 +0800 <wizardtasha> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Big deal. Big f..ing deal.  The monthly copay on my medications is $247.  I‚Äôll take the card and use it, but I‚Äôm still voting for Joe. Trump is taking away Medicare and social security. In three years, if I‚Äôm not dead from lack of meds, I‚Äôll be broke.
1310813413505867776 2020-09-29 13:27:26 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump This is bull poop. You‚Äôve been saying this for years. In fact, what have you done during you time as president?  The economy is wrecked. Oh I know. You‚Äôve split our nation and encouraged hate. Is that enough for a re-election?

The grandkids are doing virtual learning, no social interaction, which is important for children.  Then along comes these party groups, and Trump‚Äôs superspreaders. (Screams &amp; pulls hair)

1310457419206553600 2020-09-28 13:52:50 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ElieNYC @realDonaldTrump Yeah, he‚Äôs not going to do that. Just like giving his dna would prove he‚Äôs innocent of rape.
1310456540290117633 2020-09-28 13:49:20 +0800 <wizardtasha> @CREWcrew What happened to the rest of the money?  Is it resting in one of his kids‚Äô bank account?  And what about the money he supposedly just sent to PR?  Did it really go there or did it ‚Äúmagically just disappear ‚Äú?
1310421677726031872 2020-09-28 11:30:49 +0800 <wizardtasha> His mama was right.  https://t.co/qgJf3DhCNd
1310387748038008833 2020-09-28 09:15:59 +0800 <wizardtasha> @svdate LOL.
1310339105348231168 2020-09-28 06:02:42 +0800 <wizardtasha> @SunjazzD As I thought. Apparently he is helping only Trump and himself. Oh, and his wife‚Äôs family.
1310124209675202561 2020-09-27 15:48:47 +0800 <wizardtasha> @essenviews @JABaloney Besides being the responsible thing to do, I feel safer wearing the  mask. We‚Äôve started using the ones with the replaceable liners. Even after the COVID is over, I will wear them for doctor appointments, and when the grandkids are sick with a cold.
1310121161980747778 2020-09-27 15:36:40 +0800 <wizardtasha> @SunjazzD Isn‚Äôt rich Mitch their senator?  Is he trying to resolve the problem.

1310105063466000384 2020-09-27 14:32:42 +0800 <wizardtasha> @JWeber988 @derfderf14 Yes please. Maybe they could move to one of the land masses that‚Äôs going to be covered by water soon because of the global warming they don‚Äôt believe in.
1310103864293482496 2020-09-27 14:27:56 +0800 <wizardtasha> @mmpadellan @derfderf14 Oh please, let it be so. When I dream of this happening, the skies clear, angels sing, and my Trump PTSD starts to reverse.
1310093604111618049 2020-09-27 13:47:10 +0800 <wizardtasha> @JoyAnnReid @ProjectLincoln He deserves every bit of this and more. Now, if we can get McConnell as scared.
1310072338281459723 2020-09-27 12:22:40 +0800 <wizardtasha> @RepsForBiden @RVAT2020 Many, many of us know what you are feeling and how frustrating these months have been. Please know you‚Äôre not alone in this. If we can just hang together and get the monster tRump out of office, we can sit back and let Joe lead us and heal our nation.

Women In this group are subservient to the men, known as ‚Äúleads‚Äù. My concern that she will follow obediently obeying her lead, Trump.

1309978088000774144 2020-09-27 06:08:09 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realTuckFrumper Donny cheats oh his wives, his taxes, his employees, his charities, us, etc, etc. And he thinks the Democrats are cheating?  This is all he‚Äôs got because he‚Äôs the cheater and a loser.

1309895948751966209 2020-09-27 00:41:45 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realTuckFrumper I just don‚Äôt understand why the people of Kentucky keep voting for him. Their state is near the bottom for education, employment, medical. He‚Äôs extremely rich, but his state is ver poor.
1309750143630016512 2020-09-26 15:02:22 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realTuckFrumper I always think he can‚Äôt get any more stupid, then he says something like this.  https://t.co/PPNTtrqZmk

1309739541750640640 2020-09-26 14:20:15 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realTuckFrumper Oh Donny. That‚Äôs going to do us lots of good when you take away our social security and Medicare.  Keep your bribe. I‚Äôd vote for my neighbor‚Äôs dog before I‚Äôd vote for you.

But then I remember that is Trump‚Äôs bullying method. So I‚Äôm just going to say, why would we expect anything better from this hateful man?

1308936158500417537 2020-09-24 09:07:53 +0800 <wizardtasha> @therecount @ddale8 So he‚Äôs saying, don‚Äôt count any of the ballots. Then he‚Äôs not leaving anyway because the vote will be rigged anyway?  This is scary.

1307903347567935490 2020-09-21 12:43:52 +0800 <wizardtasha> @derekjGZ @westernbeader Now I‚Äôm really worried. Could he get mad enough if he looses to nuke some of the blue states?  Could someone with a brain stop him if he tries?  He already wants to cut us out of his COVID problems.

Second, he wasn‚Äôt thrust into office. He strolled in with his Cheeto makeup and his pretend hair and began to fake his way to our country‚Äôs destruction.
1307840024801497089 2020-09-21 08:32:15 +0800 <wizardtasha> @monterolaw @itsJeffTiedrich What does Trump care. It‚Äôs violence. That‚Äôs his hype isn‚Äôt it. Biden says violence isn‚Äôt protesting.
1307833240489586689 2020-09-21 08:05:17 +0800 <wizardtasha> @monterolaw @itsJeffTiedrich Trump would call these idiots heroes. How awful.

It‚Äôs not hatred I feel, it‚Äôs anger. It hurts my heart and I am so sad that you‚Äôre so naive that you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt see the truth.
1307558108831444992 2020-09-20 13:52:01 +0800 <wizardtasha> @donwinslow @DHSgov It should be a bigger story!  This and the physical and mental harm to all the children they stole from their parents. Trump did this, he ordered this. How can the faux Christians ignore these atrocities.

Joe Biden was a private citizen when the virus hit us. However,unlike the Trump, had he known, he would have warned us. It‚Äôs all on Trump lady.

She says , sure he‚Äôs made a few mistakes, but at least we know he won‚Äôt lie to us. (I scream and run far away). How can his followers be so blind?

1304126447867494400 2020-09-11 02:35:49 +0800 <wizardtasha> @InBed17 @MeidasTouch And he does it so well. #PretendPresident
1304098474347040769 2020-09-11 00:44:39 +0800 <wizardtasha> @MeidasTouch Look at what‚Äôs going on right now?  The west coast is burning, people are dying of COVID by the thousands because of you, civil unrest is exploding across the United States. (That‚Äôs UNITED not DIVIDED states I‚Äôll give you a few to look those up.) Either  help us or shut up.
1303976288923729920 2020-09-10 16:39:08 +0800 <wizardtasha> @SalGood69 @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn‚Äôt like us cause we‚Äôre a blue state. When California asked for help, he said no because nobody voted for him there.
1303974292397281280 2020-09-10 16:31:12 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ThePomrenke The sun from our neighborhood.  https://t.co/qwNEYhb3lF

1303933105011527680 2020-09-10 13:47:32 +0800 <wizardtasha> @dvillella @kylegriffin1 Exactly. There‚Äôs no almost.

1303928682872844289 2020-09-10 13:29:58 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DoYouEvenLif My neighborhood is at stage one in Oregon for fire alert. I‚Äôve always tried to be positive and not not hate anyone. Today I HATE. Trump (I refuse to call him president) and his enablers. I hate them. I feel sad for all those poor people he killed.
1303915260017930240 2020-09-10 12:36:38 +0800 <wizardtasha> @AmoneyResists @MeidasTouch @FoxNews So many lies. So many dead. Trump (I refuse to call him president) did this to us. All those people who enabled him are just as guilty.
1303837729076031488 2020-09-10 07:28:33 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ProjectLincoln Why can‚Äôt his followers see this?  Pray to your deities people; save us from this evil.
1303817335308865536 2020-09-10 06:07:31 +0800 <wizardtasha> @AmoneyResists @MeidasTouch And he‚Äôs still killing us and encouraging others to do the same. Even bullying those with masks and ordering them to remove them. I can see why the bully boys and those who think they‚Äôre better then anyone else still support him, but others, please stop.
1303812168157024256 2020-09-10 05:46:59 +0800 <wizardtasha> @CNNPolitics There are no words. None that can express the evil in this man. All those of us who have died needlessly. May he and his enablers know the pain we the people have felt.
1303733941711433729 2020-09-10 00:36:08 +0800 <wizardtasha> @mmpadellan Dear God. Let me wake up now. Let the nightmare be over. It‚Äôs like living in a never ending Twilight Zone episode.

1303717026905513985 2020-09-09 23:28:55 +0800 <wizardtasha> @shannonrwatts I‚Äôm confused. Is he actually telling the truth? Has this happened before?  I have a headache.

1303523039309488128 2020-09-09 10:38:05 +0800 <wizardtasha> @thomaskaine5 What about Kentucky?  What has he done for them?  (Besides take away a bunch of their voting stations so the ones he fears won‚Äôt vote for him have to travel miles to vote.)
1303499607582765056 2020-09-09 09:04:58 +0800 <wizardtasha> @RawStory @KamalaHarris Whenever he‚Äôs scared of someone, he reverts to the elementary school bully tactics. Name calling, insults, threatening, and if he could, he‚Äôd probably throw rocks.
1303497112080936965 2020-09-09 08:55:03 +0800 <wizardtasha> @RepsForBiden @ReallyAmerican1 Thank you. I hope others will listen and hear you words.
1303494328010985472 2020-09-09 08:44:00 +0800 <wizardtasha> @NPR So, the big boats sank the little boats. Not unlike Big Bully Trump does to American citizens.
1303488825079939073 2020-09-09 08:22:08 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realTuckFrumper Does Eric have an actual job?  Or do they just bring him out once in a while so Trump can say he‚Äôs smarter than someone?  Btw Eric, low blow with the stutter comment. Obviously you get you empathy from you dad. Bless your heart.
1303465573582422017 2020-09-09 06:49:44 +0800 <wizardtasha> @donwinslow I‚Äôve always believed any soul can be saved. (Southern Baptist upbringing.). But I believe now Trump has no soul.
1303405992009318400 2020-09-09 02:52:59 +0800 <wizardtasha> @donwinslow Evil men, just like their father. That poor animal. Hunting for food is one thing; killing just to kill something is evil.
1303275735633727489 2020-09-08 18:15:23 +0800 <wizardtasha> @realDonaldTrump All of this has happened on your watch Mr Trump. You‚Äôre not winning and with the grace of God you won‚Äôt win.
1303273913225375744 2020-09-08 18:08:09 +0800 <wizardtasha> @TheRickyDavila Trump is a bully who has never grown up.  He takes every opportunity to strut, throw rocks,  and call people names.

1303185511134105600 2020-09-08 12:16:52 +0800 <wizardtasha> @shannonrwatts I cried while reading this. I‚Äôm still upset. You can see from his pictures, he‚Äôs just a little boy!!!  For God‚Äôs sake, those men are monsters.  My thoughts are with him, his mother, and family.

1303162210399604736 2020-09-08 10:44:17 +0800 <wizardtasha> @DemWrite @JoeBiden I‚Äôm voting Democrat all the way.  We have to get rid of those thieving Republicans. Once they‚Äôre gone, the R‚Äôs can reboot and start over.
1303148993476583424 2020-09-08 09:51:46 +0800 <wizardtasha> @zulustudio @beardedcrank Me too. I believe I‚Äôve been in isolation too long. I‚Äôve watched this several times. It‚Äôs hilarious.
1303133444570923008 2020-09-08 08:49:58 +0800 <wizardtasha> @ReallyAmerican1 He has basically inferred that if he‚Äôs locked up, Trump will pardon him. I wonder where he got idea.
