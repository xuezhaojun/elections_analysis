Trump, Flynn, and any other Senator or Representative claiming this election was stolen and should be overturned by military or unconstitutional means are traitors! Flynn should have his military rank and pension stripped, and every elected official should be gone!

Want to try again, Fox Network laughingstock? Project Veritas? ü§£üòÇ The same Project Veritas with the Pennsylvania lying mailman claiming election fraud? Talk about "Fake"!

You got impeached because you were caught and now you've been voted out of office because the American people are sick of you and your antics. Just go away. The sooner the better.

Texas had no standing means they (and other states) were not harmed by the election regulations of other states. You might have standing; however, you should have challenged these laws when they were enacted, not just because you lost.

1337487796672598018 2020-12-12 04:01:54 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @RaheemKassam I don't think anyone said Hunter was innocent. What we said was the info came from dubious sources (Giuliani, etc.). If Hunter broke the law, I have no doubt he will be held accountable, unlike Trump's cronies getting pardons...

1337482563577925635 2020-12-12 03:41:07 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @DanCrenshawTX No one was questioning the integrity of this election until Trump lost. That was his plan all along. CUSA stated it was the most secure in history and each state, including Republican states, had no issues with this election. But because Trump lost, we have to appease him? No!!
1337482117102641161 2020-12-12 03:39:20 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @DanCrenshawTX Also not factual. Do some homework before tweeting, Dan.
1337481976740274176 2020-12-12 03:38:47 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @DanCrenshawTX Incorrect. Frivolous cases with no factual evidence are a waste of SCOTUS time and taxpayer dollars and THAT'S where your concern needs to be. We will not forget you were a party to this ridiculous bullshit.

Someone walked into the HQ with a backpack with wires sticking out and handed over a manifesto saying he was angry at the govt. The backpack had gasoline and oil in it and he set it on fire. It was put out shortly with no damage.

Stop asking your ignorant cult for money to pay off your debts. They can't afford it. Stop acting like a child and go home to Florida and please don't come back. You're an embarrassment. You lost.

Because it is just that. That data analysis is nothing but bullshit. And you fell for it. Just because it threw numbers around and sounded cool. Stupid.

Who is right and who is wrong here?  You can't rail against Republicans when it doesn't work for you personally, then support them when it doesn't affect you.

Texas has no standing to sue other states for their election procedures. State AG Paxton is just looking for a pardon. Will you give him one when he loses? #LoserTrump
1336692378934054913 2020-12-09 23:21:12 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @AJDelgado13 Which state counts the non-residents with homes in Florida that pass away in Florida? Not their home state? Not Florida? So they're not tallied anywhere. There are too many of them to discard. A whistleblower uncovers wrongdoing under fear of retaliation. She's a whistleblower.

The only fraud in this election is you.  You cheated and can't believe you still lost. You paid off people and got taken because they couldn't fix the election.  You're out.

Can't wait until he changes his dirty diapers and leaves the White House and is immediately indicted for the many crimes he's committed. My wish is that he goes away forever.

1330522744979599366 2020-11-22 22:45:16 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @JennaEllisEsq Exactly who is scared here?

1330522298831482881 2020-11-22 22:43:30 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LizRNC From the Trump appointee that took years for Senate approval, and proclaimed that churches should endorse political candidates in violation of the separation of church and state and tax-exempt status. Trey Trainor has no standing in this ongoing election issue. The judges rule.
1330520163519754240 2020-11-22 22:35:01 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @AnthonySabatini You should be censured.

1330518759820374019 2020-11-22 22:29:26 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump I thought it was all about mail-in ballots and the numbers couldn't possibly be right. So they did a hand recount. Then when that didn't come out in your favor, you want another check of something else. Georgia has been certified!

Additionally, if the ballots are bad, so are ALL of the Senate votes as they were on the same ballot, so those need to be discounted also.

Military members and their families are NOT COMMITTING VOTER FRAUD BY VOTING FROM ANOTHER STATE, EUROPE, OR OVERSEAS. It is their right as veterans to vote in their home of record.

There are not still 127,000+ ballots to count. There is a small set of provisionals left. And with provisionals, many will be nullified due to in-person voting, and other reasons.

You just want to sew seeds of doubt about our Democracy with Trump's base because you know they believe ANYTHING you tell them, regardless of facts. SAD!
1325902611078406152 2020-11-10 04:46:31 +0800 <JudyC57625988> And then go out and try to find evidence to back up the accusation. You are denigrating both Repub and Dem volunteer side-by-side workers in election centers who've been laboring for days. Comparing this to Gore v Bush is ridiculous. Absolutely apples and oranges. Thousands of
1325902610059112455 2020-11-10 04:46:30 +0800 <JudyC57625988> ...voter rolls, removing 100s of ballot drop boxes in Dem-heavy districts, and on. That is cheating. It didn't work. As soon as a network projected Biden a win in a typically RED state, Trump spouted "voter fraud", with absolutely no evidence. And it progressed. You don't accuse

America has had mail-in ballots since the Civil War. Trump was calling fraud BEFORE the election, which gave him an out when he was outvoted. Face it - you lost!

1325207195433144321 2020-11-08 06:43:11 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump @GOP You need to step up. The courts assessed that observers WERE allowed in counting rooms. The US doesn't grant the winner of an election based on vote counts but on the Electoral College. Allegations about "bad things not seen" are a joke. Go to court with evidence. STOP BS!
1325206287420846082 2020-11-08 06:39:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @AshaRangappa_ I hate to say it, but he may be crafting an unconditional pardon for Pence to give Trump, once he resigns after the SCOTUS refuses to hear election cases. I think this was always the plan should he lose. That way he can always say his election was stolen and never concede he lost
1325204936112680960 2020-11-08 06:34:12 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Republican observers were allowed, in EVERY counting center nationwide. It doesn't matter if mail-in ballots went out unsolicited. They were scanned going out, scanned coming in. If someone voted in-person, their mail-in ballot was nullified if it wasn't used or came in after.
1325204249429438466 2020-11-08 06:31:28 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump And you should be proud of that. President-Elect Joe Biden has broken the record for votes in any presidential election in history.

1324832593897000965 2020-11-07 05:54:39 +0800 <JudyC57625988> It's so sad to have such a stupid @GOP. They believe the Dems rigged a nationwide election involving 100K's of people, stretched out for days until a winner could be determined. No blue wave to substantiate polls and yet we forgot to rig Senate and House elections. No wonder...
1324831013109964806 2020-11-07 05:48:22 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @johncardillo And we just forgot to also rig the Senate and House elections? Asshat.

You will NEVER be President or a credible representative of your state or country because you crave air time, no matter the subject. All election centers had observers, there is no controversy here. Campaign wanted them closer? Check. Provide evidence or shut up!
1324760616259608576 2020-11-07 01:08:38 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @gop Your party told Hillary Clinton every day since the election in 2016 to "get over it, you lost." She NEVER filed a legal fight to stop vote counting, invalidate votes, decry the institution of our democracy, etc.. She conceded the election when it was verified she lost.

You can grumble about the Dem leadership, but that shouldn't effect the citizenry votes. You've said NOTHING about Trump and the USPS

1324757104096387072 2020-11-07 00:54:41 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump It's not the Republican Senate or Democrat Senate. It is the Senate, with a majority and minority party. It is also not YOUR Senate. It is composed of leaders elected by the people of the states they represent. Be a leader.

1324567933356486660 2020-11-06 12:22:59 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC Election observers ARE NOT being denied access to observe counting. Just because @seanhannity says it does not make it so. Penn officials were brought to court to allow observers to be closer. How about standing up for the Constitution, not Trump!
1324564224174104576 2020-11-06 12:08:14 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC philly allowed observers from all political parties and campaigns.

1324503969276792833 2020-11-06 08:08:49 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @gop Trump told us all he was going to do this long ago. "The only way I can lose is if there is fraud." Someone needs to intervene here from your party. If someone gets hurt because of this crazy man, it's on you because you refused to step up. THIS IS WRONG!
1324503439251066880 2020-11-06 08:06:42 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @gop It is indeed a sad night in America when the top representative of your party is calling the election a fraud because there is a good possibility he will lose. This is pathetic. This is illogical and makes no sense. Mail-in votes are not fraudulent because Dems used them.
1324498549804027907 2020-11-06 07:47:16 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Do you have proof THAT ANY VOTE COUNTED THUS FAR HAS BEEN ILLEGAL? If not, this shouldn't even be an issue. It is disgusting that ANY President of the United States would suggest that this election is being "stolen" from him because the will of the people is turning away from him

There is absolutely no proof that Republican reps weren't allowed to observe vote counting. EVERY center had reps from both parties. There is no requirement that any Trump supporter be allowed in. How many ballots are still in USPS facilities, Nikki???
1324487348671885313 2020-11-06 07:02:46 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @ksorbs Could be a couple reasons: People are tired of the lawless, disgusting POS that you support; Biden cares more about his audience than Trump does; if flags are the only way to show support, I feel bad for you. This may be why your career was short lived. Have a nice day, asshat.

Don't be an asshole, Sean. If Trump loses, he lost. Period. People got tired of his bullshit.

While watching MSNBC and flipping back and forth between them and CNN, all called California, Oregon, Washington for Biden, almost right after their polls closed, so it's the same thing. I don't believe there's anything funky there.
1324450685522481154 2020-11-06 04:37:05 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @BillOReilly Why? Because Trump's not winning? Ridiculous. Do you see Biden discounting any of the President's wins in the states Trump won? No. The fact is Trump is a bad loser. There was NEVER a guarantee he was going to win reelection. Far from it.
1324440535403237384 2020-11-06 03:56:45 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Nope. The "big legal win" allows you to watch. Watch Biden votes be counted. Wow! üòÇü§£

We will uncover every illegal act. If you think for one minute Trump should be your candidate in 2024 or anyone else affiliated with him, recommend you keep looking.
1324436553901506563 2020-11-06 03:40:55 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GOP, Trump is your President. He dismantled the USPS to prevent ballots from arriving on time. You did nothing. He didn't start screaming about fraud after the election until it looked like he might not win. This is not how elections work. Count the votes - name the winner.

And yes, they surrounded, slowed down, and attempted to run the bus off the road. I live in this area. We are fully aware of what took place.

Harassing an opponent's campaign vehicles on a major highway is against the law. An accident could easily have happened and people could have been injured or died. GROW UP!

Those states that lawfully changed existing laws to accommodate COVID issues haven't had an issue. No federal court should touch this unless it is as close as Bush-Gore.

Bobulinski is the male Tara Reade. I'm disappointed in him because he's a vet. While he only did the obligatory four years, he's still a vet. And vets that stoop this low are sad.
1319491070003171329 2020-10-23 12:09:20 +0800 <JudyC57625988> Tony Bobulinski is the male equivalent of Tara Reade, the first Trump-paid accuser of Joe Biden. That story crumbled as will this one. What's disgusting about this one is that Tony is a Navy vet. Only did his obligatory four years but still a vet. And for a vet to stoop is sad.

He voted on a bill to get rid of Medicare, get rid of CHIP, and at one time, to abolish the ACA. He's like Flake - feels free to criticize Trump once he's resigned from his seat but not before.

And you are telling people to ignore COVID because you're tired of it. Each one of those who've passed had families and you owe each family an apology. Ignore COVID? No we won't. And @JoeBiden won't. Because it matters.

He's going to start by transitioning electric autos for current government-contracted gas autos. More electric cars on the road, there is a need for more charging stations. Less pollution.

It's just as bad as Trump retweeting QAnon conspiracy theories. Either take the time to do some basic research or don't report it, i.e., Hunter Biden has lived in California since 2018.

This is really why Trump is afraid. It's all going to come out.

1317155195860733953 2020-10-17 01:27:24 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @bblock29 He knows. He just believes them.
1317155052834988035 2020-10-17 01:26:50 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @ericsslater So sorry ‚ù§Ô∏è
1317154622524575744 2020-10-17 01:25:08 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump No he didn't. Who's the guy tweeting out QAnon conspiracy theories? Who's the guy who sent Rudy to Russia to talk to Russian Intel about the Bidens? Who is going to prison in 2021? Not Joe...
1317154131749052416 2020-10-17 01:23:11 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @rak_strong Pickles and ice cream
1317153608698388480 2020-10-17 01:21:06 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump You've lied since you've been in office. Biden is not banning fracking; he will not allow future fracking opportunities where none existed as he moves the country away from fossil fuels...
1317153332348280832 2020-10-17 01:20:00 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @RandPaul Tweeting statements made during primary debates when all were candidates is ridiculous.

1317152855904616448 2020-10-17 01:18:07 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GovLarryHogan Appreciate the fact you didn't specifically vote for Trump; however, NOT VOTING for someone who actually has a chance of knocking Trump out of office IS VOTING FOR TRUMP. So thanks but no thanks. You blew it.
1317128635220959232 2020-10-16 23:41:52 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump @TheBabylonBee Because it's not true. The entire network was not shut down. Everything in the internet and Twitter is not fact. Some are satirical sites. I'll tell you something that is fact. You are an idiot.

1316953747386413056 2020-10-16 12:06:55 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @charliekirk11 Because it's a bullshit story! Is anyone asking Trump about the snake people QAnon keeps talking about?
1316933571446296576 2020-10-16 10:46:45 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump if you had a better health bill, you could have passed it without waiting for SCOTUS to rule on your lawsuit to throw out ObamaCare. The fact is YOU DON'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT HEALTH CARE PLAN. YOU DON'T PLAN EVER. You make decisions off the fly; the wrong thing.

1316927566134054914 2020-10-16 10:22:53 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @SteveScalise Only if you agree with continuing to spread Russian misinformation. Republican-led Senate subcommittee's report already stated there was no misconduct by the Bidens; this bullshit has already been investigated. These are private companies w/user agreements.
1316902170638356486 2020-10-16 08:41:58 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @greggutfeld I love it when Fox personalities get mad at people who don't kiss Trump's ass like they do.

You are a failed President, husband, father, businessman, academic, friend. What have you ever succeeded at except conning people? Well, you know what happens to cons? They go to prison.

Twitter and Facebook are private companies with user agreements. Don't like the rules? Don't use them. They will not be allowing a replay of 2016, which you prefer.

While you may think that's fair, Trump is the one that pulled out of the virtual debate. I can't wait until your incompetent ass is canned!
1316552765070610432 2020-10-15 09:33:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @NBCNews At the same time as the Biden Town Hall on ABC?  Absolutely stupid decision. Why not push it back and get the entire audience instead of splitting the baby here. I would have watched both but because of your idiotic decision, I'll be watching Joe only.

Since he was caught lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russians, and the US Govt didn't setup those conversations, no entrapment.

1314722499721129986 2020-10-10 08:20:44 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC Liar. You get a gold-level ACA policy, receive federal subsidies that cover 72% of the cost of the premiums. You pay 28% of the premiums and have access to free or low-cost care through Office of the Attending Physician, free outpatient care at military facilities in D.C.

You are incorrect.

Then Trump decides it's OK days later? Gosh, the Commission determines the number, format, and place of the debates, not the participants. Tired of the whining Republicans.

Are you also going to investigate @IvankaTrump's use of personal email to conduct US Govt work? When can we expect that to begin?
1314678353513852928 2020-10-10 05:25:19 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Nope. He's ducking the debate because during a pandemic with outbreaks all over, especially at the WH and Congress, you are refusing to take a COVID TEST. He beat your ass on the first debate; you are the one that needed this debate, not Jaime. You played the debate game and lost

Those "peace" deals between countries not in conflict are nothing but closet arms sales. He's a crook and everyone knows it. Nobel Prizes don't go to impeached corrupt leaders.
1314677224696619013 2020-10-10 05:20:50 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @atrupar So 1) Why is @SecPompeo involved with Clinton's e-mails unless this is further Russian misinformation? 2) Clinton isn't running for office - what exactly does Pompeo think the effect will be except raise suspicion on the release?
1314675619641331712 2020-10-10 05:14:27 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Hmmm. Why are these mistakes with ballots happening in Republican-led states? NOT voter fraud as the ballots were not filled in.
1314674717173874690 2020-10-10 05:10:52 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @MarshaBlackburn Just like Republicans have done over the last four years, not only SCOTUS, but also district and appeals courts?  With a lot of people deemed "unqualified" by the American Bar Association!  Can't wait until you get voted out of office!

1314577393672228864 2020-10-09 22:44:08 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @JillWineBanks The ballots were to be delivered to voters, so they were still blank. Looks like a young frustrated postal worker. Trump shouldn't be tweeting this - blank ballots is not voter fraud.

Joe DOES NOT support weapons whose sole purpose is killing humans. Military-style weapons have no place in the general public. Joe is a practicing Catholic. You are a practicing nothing. Joe believes in clean energy jobs!

With the exception of a Hannity interview conducted via phone, this POTUS has not publicly denounced white supremacists/nationalists. His "LIBERATE MICHIGAN" skree was a call for action. He NEVER denounced armed right-wing militia taking over the capitol building.

Now she's a VP candidate, she follows Biden's plan, which is keep current fracking but transition in the future to clean energy. Also not a lie that Lincoln waited until AFTER the election to confirm his nominee for SCOTUS.

1313682131072229377 2020-10-07 11:26:41 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GreggJarrett Such bullshit. Have you read Barnett's 302? Recommend you do so - it's public.

There will be no hiding the billions provided to your pals and Trump Org, the secret deals made with MBS and Erdogan, the crimes against humanity you committed on immigrants.

That signifies .3% of all ballots. These errors were found and new ballots were sent out. Even smaller number in LA County. NOT VOTER FRAUD!!!

He must be voted out of office in November!

1311872707278106625 2020-10-02 11:36:41 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Heard your @Hannity interview- why are you trying to blame this virus transmission on military or law enforcement? We all know you don't allow mask wearing in the West Wing; why not blame it on aides or staff? Or whoever Hope is dating? Such bullshit!
1311872098726555649 2020-10-02 11:34:16 +0800 <JudyC57625988> Why the hell is @realDonaldTrump trying to blame the transmission of this virus to Hope Hicks and possibly himself on military members or law enforcement? The West Wing is not allowed to wear masks - why isn't it also someone in the West Wing? Or whoever Hope is dating?

You can't stand to hear the truth about yourself, so you pivot and attack. Biden was talking about his dead son, you said "Who? Hunter?" Refused to denounce right-wing militia groups. "Stand by"?

What's sad is that you have no response as to where is this administration's plan when on 10 November, the Supreme Court will be hearing arguments to strike down ACA. If it is struck down and there is no existing national health care plan, where are we?

The DoJ NEVER releases statements on ongoing investigations, at least they never did previously. Additionally, the "facts" in the statement are incorrect - these 7 ballots were from the Super Tuesday primary.

The BS story in Pennsylvania didn't pan out for ya, did it? 7 ballots for Super Tuesday, not even this primary. This "mail-in ballot" scandal isn't playing well for you is it? You've even got Project Veritas making FAKE videos for you. Sad.

Crooked DeSantis decided all ex-prisoners needed to pay poll taxes before they could vote. Bloomberg, and others, paid their fines so they could vote. There was no promise to vote a particular way.

While some of Judge Barrett's comments have been misconstrued, Kavanaugh was an accused sexual assaulter. This will not be Kavanaugh 2.0, nor will the hearings be anti-Catholic. Several Dem Senators are Catholic. Stop rocking the boat early.

Someone has to capture the white guys doing bad things or the other media (Fox, OANN, etc.) will say it was all BLM and AntiFa.

White supremacists will take over cities, racism will become normal again, Trump will act like a King, you will never be allowed to criticize him, you will lose your Social Security/Medicare, and he will continue to make millions for Trump Org!
1306802504324255744 2020-09-18 11:49:30 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump You are lying again! Joe said "Surplus military equipment for law enforcement; they don't need that...an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it's like the military invading. They don't know anybody; they become the enemy, they‚Äôre supposed to be protecting these people."

I doubt that Kellogg has been around when things have been said. He continues to say "I was there" (Paris with Trump, COVID task force), he wasn't listening.

Does "law and order" apply to this Administration? If so, why is Congress not providing oversight when Trump and Company break the law?
1306747444756086784 2020-09-18 08:10:43 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump You just signed your "peace" deals, which are nothing but arms sales. Since you've never really written a book, I guess you don't know how long it takes to publish a book. Since you never said anything to Bob about your "peace deal" it's obvious they weren't being worked on then.

In Pennsylvania tonight, he's ensuring people are kept safe, while you are not. Your rally will be filled with people crowded together, with little mask wearing. Let's see who televises your BS campaign speech.

It's the Idiot-in-Chief that appoints a radiologist as head of his COVID virus task force, a doctor that colleagues at Stanford disavow due to his lack of knowledge and ridiculous strategies. Trump appoints Fox entertainers

A President who's accused of sexual assault by over 25 women, ducking a DNA test due to a rape accusation, taped talking about assaulting any woman he wants, is mocking another man accused of misconduct?  This bad gossip you have time for?  189,000+ dead on you.

He's just trying to make his name famous and once he burns that out, you won't be getting your money back. There is no "People's Party". You might as well donate to Kanye - at least he exists.

I'll bet your right-wing militia gangs stop traveling to protest cities soon because you can't pay them anymore. You've squandered a lot of your campaign funds on legal bills and there are still many to go! Loser!

Snowden's actions and his stolen intel are NOT RELATED in any way to Trump's interactions w/Russia

He's been residing in Russia, employed by their government for years now. He is NOT a whistleblower. He never took his concerns to his Senator, etc. or employer. That's because he had no idea what he had or the damage he could cause. A little man.

As a retired IC analyst, I can say that Snowden is nothing but a traitor to this country. Dismissed from his CIA position, he was an angry IT contractor. He violated his sworn oath, removed intel and gave it to a journalist. He fled like...

Trump waited 2 days after McCain died to acknowledge his death, and only reversed his decision to only fly flags at half-mast for 1/2 day after massive criticism. Refused to keep WH flag at half-mast

Trump said and did nothing until Monday, and only after harsh criticism. He still refused to keep the WH flag at half-mast for more than one-half day. He had to be pushed to have McCain lie in state.

1300617066593083393 2020-09-01 10:10:47 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @benshapiro The systemic racism comes in when you routinely use that force against certain people, especially when it's unjustified. Racism is a learned trait.
1300616655480016896 2020-09-01 10:09:09 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @benshapiro Systemic: definition - relating to a system, especially as opposed to a particular part. It's not about the people. The people are a part of the system. Law enforcement has systemic racism - due to its core element of using force, either verbal or physical, to control actions

The peaceful protests started because of unarmed Black men being killed by white LE. Trump has DONE NOTHING to try to fix this. Instead he refuses to say LE is flawed. His supporters take up arms and travel to these cities
1300614083364958208 2020-09-01 09:58:56 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @Jim_Jordan That's right, Jim. When's the last time we had such a racist, white nationalist President?  Huh? You know what's stoking these flames? His complete disregard for the issues that initially started the protests. Then his white boy right-wing militia gangs traveled to these cities.
