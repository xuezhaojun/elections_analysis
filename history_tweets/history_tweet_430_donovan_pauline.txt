1332759233767624714 2020-11-29 02:52:17 +0800 <donovan_pauline> @USlawreview @JonahofNinevah I know here in Canada people are not only accepting they are crying out for more government control. Mindless chanting of government mantras of wear a mask and wait for the vaccine. It's hard not to feel hopeless.

1321115969612296192 2020-10-27 23:46:06 +0800 <donovan_pauline> It took about two weeks for Higgs here in New Brunswick, so good luck to British Columbia.

Children are at next to zero risk and are not spreaders of covid. You need to keep up with the latest fear porn - long term covid!!

Obviously, it's not the same for people like you who fly to other countries and eat dogs but fingers crossed for a fine Christmas feast for you, Catherine!
