1337418990277292035 2020-12-11 23:28:29 +0800 <MamsMandrill> @Jade_Pickering @DenOlmo @DenOlmo, Cannot wait to read your next paper. Similar to @Jade_Pickering , these papers are quite anti pre-reg but they have not changed my opinion about pre-reg . However, I admire it  more because of them, since they made me think about the importance of theory and analysis.

Choose your presentation and before you click okay, go to the advanced tab, then click on the "portion of screen" button. You can then readjust the window size in order to show how much or how little that the viewers can actually see.

1306967981105111040 2020-09-18 22:47:03 +0800 <MamsMandrill> @lkfazio @DrJamesBooth Thank you @DrJamesBooth for asking the question and @lkfazio for writing the blogpost.
1306966351098019842 2020-09-18 22:40:35 +0800 <MamsMandrill> @lkfazio @DrJamesBooth It really is an interesting question. Also, I believe my findings would need to be replicated as well.  The authors' paper that I referenced is located here:   https://t.co/fhFcT7tpFv
1306966019781648384 2020-09-18 22:39:16 +0800 <MamsMandrill> @lkfazio @DrJamesBooth @DrJamesBooth and @lkfazio, the findings observed for combinatorial naming will be observed for character naming. However, if they used combinatorial naming, I think the effects of semantics, frequency and morphological processing would be further enhanced.
1306965704537788417 2020-09-18 22:38:00 +0800 <MamsMandrill> @lkfazio @DrJamesBooth @DrJamesBooth and @lkfazio, a very interesting question.  Honestly, I do not know but based on studies by Dr Ya-Ning Chang, character naming involved more semantics and frequency than lexical decision task (LDT). The opposite pattern that is observed in English with word naming.
