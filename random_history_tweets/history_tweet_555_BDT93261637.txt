1342853536472825858 2020-12-26 23:23:26 +0800 <BDT93261637> To have full disclosure in the Epstein case is to know that much more about all the other cases being investigated.

1342850579920515074 2020-12-26 23:11:41 +0800 <BDT93261637> 100% Correct!   Many in Congress are under the false impression they're entitled to the many benefits they receive at taxpayer expense.   [They] vote their benefits, pay raises, etc., into law. They're the perfect definition of "A Self-licking Icecream Cone".  It must be nice.
1342186447185596416 2020-12-25 03:12:40 +0800 <BDT93261637> I totally forgot how funny this is... 😄😅😂

1342181750089375745 2020-12-25 02:54:00 +0800 <BDT93261637> I respect all law enforcement officers and 1st responders. But, when they act like this it really makes me angry.  As a sworn "Public Servant" you don't act this way in a non-violent situation.  No excuses ...You just don't do crap like this to the people who pay your salary.
1342178370000478209 2020-12-25 02:40:34 +0800 <BDT93261637> Wow ...Great story! 😀
1341915115113865216 2020-12-24 09:14:29 +0800 <BDT93261637> Trump was never a true POTUS, he just played one on TV.   For four very long years he impersonated an American president ...Where we witnessed and were subjected to every facet of his demented mind and its ugly Narcissistic Manifestations.  I've never hated anyone like I do him!  https://t.co/bul1C0una9

1341637070536798209 2020-12-23 14:49:38 +0800 <BDT93261637> Especially, after your impeachment you then go about pardoning all the culprits you colluded with, who - along with your criminal actions - caused you to be impeached in the 1st place!  C'mon America ...Let's do Smart Stuff vs Dumb Shit! 🤨
1341635538491756546 2020-12-23 14:43:33 +0800 <BDT93261637> It is anatomically IMPOSSIBLE for Matt Gaetz to get his empty head any farther up Trump's orange ass. 😂😂😂
1341627687245389824 2020-12-23 14:12:21 +0800 <BDT93261637> Lol! 😄 ...(It's really NOT funny)  If YOU could NOT see/envision that these last four years under Trump were going to take place in 2016 during the presidential campaign, then YOU my friend ARE FUCKING BLIND.  It doesn't take an Einstein to know bad character when you see it! 🤨
1341624744978894848 2020-12-23 14:00:40 +0800 <BDT93261637> Supporting Donald Trump is to condone his criminal behavior/conduct.  I'm tired of giving MAGA/Trump Suuporters a pass and explaining their inclinations as "Misguided Patriotism".   They know exactly the kind of person they're supporting and do so because they're no different.

Why do they choose to do this? Do they have debilitating mental conditions???  This is a real evolutionary setback for the modern human race.
1340861683145842689 2020-12-21 11:28:31 +0800 <BDT93261637> The chickens are finally coming home to roost for Donald Trump.  What we're witnessing is Trump panicking and being truly Scared to Death for the 1st time in his miserable life.  In the case of Donald Trump, let Cosmic Justice be served in full measure.
1340859816290512897 2020-12-21 11:21:06 +0800 <BDT93261637> Tiger won his 1st Masters at Augusta National 25 years ago, and now we get to watch his son Charlie play the game as passionately as his father.

1340854956438540292 2020-12-21 11:01:48 +0800 <BDT93261637> America's potential for good is grossly overshadowed and hindered by the lackluster performance of its politicians.  Just imagine if 100% of our Congress (House &amp; Senate) and the POTUS were laser-focused on doing what's right for the American Taxpayer 🤔 ...Utopia on Steroids!
1340852582856728579 2020-12-21 10:52:22 +0800 <BDT93261637> This retweet is 100% true and should never be sugar-coated, or glossed over.  Fact: Trump is a selfish man!   He hid the truth from us and put tens-of-thousands of Americans in harm's way because he didn't want the economy to be ruined and hurt his chances at reelection - PERIOD

Capitalism is a good economic system, but it has a dark side as well - when taken to the extreme.  Our government - run by large special interest groups, representing the nation's businesses - cares more about $$$ than its citizens.

1333116689844727814 2020-11-30 02:32:41 +0800 <BDT93261637> Like all things Trump, "Yes", his pulling out of the heavily negotiated Iran deal was a huge mistake, especially since IT WAS WORKING!  Soon this Trump nightmare will be over and we can get back to "Common Sense Governing".  We need to reenter the Paris Climate Agreement as well.
1333114409523228672 2020-11-30 02:23:37 +0800 <BDT93261637> Now, I'm not a Democrat, I'm an Independent.

1319463495356776451 2020-10-23 10:19:46 +0800 <BDT93261637> If this is TRUE, and it most likely is, then members of Trump's base are really going to go Ape Shit when he loses!  Joe, Jill, Kamala, and Doug may need to spend the first month of their term barricaded in the WH for safe keeping till things cool off.

1309993273545588737 2020-09-27 07:08:29 +0800 <BDT93261637> Read this.  It's a matter of record, and if you mistakenly think the guy in the White House isn't totally fucking deranged, you've got your head stuck in the sand.  Trump can be a Hitler and Mussolini loving asshole on his own time, but NOT as a sitting POTUS!  Joe &amp; Kamala 🇺🇸🇺🇸
1309978728940830721 2020-09-27 06:10:41 +0800 <BDT93261637> "Make America Great Again" is nothing new. It's a tired political slogan the GOP uses every election cycle.  Nixon, Reagan, and both Bush's repeated it numerous times.   What is new, is this time they gave you a cheap ball cap made in "Jhina" to wear on your empty head.  😄😅😂  https://t.co/H4C0HLUAje

1309886363559497728 2020-09-27 00:03:40 +0800 <BDT93261637> @claudia_silver7 A short answer is inadequate to her question, but I'll try...  Blacks are hated by many whites because blacks won't shut up and simply accept their 3rd class citizenship in a country that never welcomed them beyond the physical labor they could provide to help build this country.
1309880690083794944 2020-09-26 23:41:07 +0800 <BDT93261637> @SurfnFitnes @AmberD1116 Your MAGA author is not only a Trump Kool-aid drinker, I think they help mix and serve it too.  Trump hasn't done anything, but break every rule in the book using the presidency to enrich himself and his cronies.  America's the laughing stock of the world ALL DUE TO TRUMP!  GAFB!
1309877821544771588 2020-09-26 23:29:43 +0800 <BDT93261637> In this November's election there's too much at stake.   At this moment in history there's no room for a 3rd party ...A 3rd party vote is a wasted vote.  Make a decision...  You either like what's happening in our country and want to see it get even worse, or you want better.
1309787593471668224 2020-09-26 17:31:11 +0800 <BDT93261637> After hearing this I'd like to think there's hope for the Republican party, but after the way they've behaved in the last four years they've shown me they CANNOT be trusted.  Still, it's good to hear a politician speak the truth and not blindly follow Trump's example.
1309784564420743168 2020-09-26 17:19:09 +0800 <BDT93261637> Very relevant and sober words to live by...

1307388546664271875 2020-09-20 02:38:14 +0800 <BDT93261637> Who are you riding with(?) ...The Notorious RBG, or the Inglorious GOP?!?  I'm with RBG ...All Day, Every Damn Day! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  RIP Warrior Princess 😔
1307383823018098688 2020-09-20 02:19:28 +0800 <BDT93261637> Hey! ...GOP! ...Remember this!!!  We haven't forgotten -- not for one, single minute!
1307382880591544322 2020-09-20 02:15:43 +0800 <BDT93261637> Kentucky is a very proud state with the history to back it up.   Kentuckyians needs to envision a better, brighter future for themselves and generations to come, and Marine LtCol Amy McGrath will make that happen.  She'll be a senator Kentucky will be proud to call their own 🇺🇸
1307378955117363205 2020-09-20 02:00:07 +0800 <BDT93261637> @claudia_silver7 Yes ...Plan a trip to the Mountains and rise above it all ...It's always beautiful there 😌

1307373423564410888 2020-09-20 01:38:08 +0800 <BDT93261637> @DaxGigandet Like a professional boxer about to defend his title, and can't wait for the sound of the first bell! 😠

As you mourn your mother remember those times and how she adored you 😌

1307366879892303872 2020-09-20 01:12:08 +0800 <BDT93261637> When things get rough, and "boy" are they ROUGH right now(!), and we just can't catch a break no matter what we do, that's not the time to quit, or give up. Life's a bitch(!) and right now Life's a Bitch on Steroids, but it's the crap life hands us that makes us even STRONGER 😠

1307361842642198531 2020-09-20 00:52:07 +0800 <BDT93261637> What's good for the Goose is good for the Gander ...Right, Lindsey Graham?  Or, are you going to change your mind about that too, like you did with Trump???  Is there any honesty and decency left in the Republican party(?), or has Trump eroded every ounce of that as well!?!? 🤨
1307199159687151619 2020-09-19 14:05:40 +0800 <BDT93261637> @pmweste He's going try awfully hard to do just that.   His success, or failure, rests in our hands.  No conscientious, patriotic American citizen should be staying home, or NOT voting, this November 3rd.  There's simply TOO MUCH AT STAKE!
1307165925414785024 2020-09-19 11:53:37 +0800 <BDT93261637> @Jillbiden46 It ain't Trump! 🤨

1307163227084775424 2020-09-19 11:42:53 +0800 <BDT93261637> @TeaPainUSA I say, let Trump be Trump and let him Screw the Pooch.  If the GOP attempts to replace RBG in the six weeks leading up to the election, there will be Hell to pay at the polls in November.  Trump's a cocky asshole, but he also really wants to stay out of jail by being reelected.
1307161630690676736 2020-09-19 11:36:33 +0800 <BDT93261637> @MDomino07 Hope everything went well and your recovery is short. Rest now and take care of yourself 🙂
1307159193732947969 2020-09-19 11:26:52 +0800 <BDT93261637> This is where we see just how corrupt and immoral Mitch McConnell and the GOP really are.  Obama had 8 months to go in 2016 and McConnell wouldn't allow a Supreme Court nomination.  It's 2020 with Six Weeks before a presidential election and McConnell's ready to replace RBG now.
1307157337183002625 2020-09-19 11:19:29 +0800 <BDT93261637> @clairecmc Hang in there, Claire ...She wouldn't want us to stop fighting ...Not now!
1307156690748440578 2020-09-19 11:16:55 +0800 <BDT93261637> @polarsprite I'm so very sorry to hear that your Dad isn't well and may not be with you much longer.  I haven't lost a parent yet and dread the day I do, so I can only imagine what you must be feeling.  You still have some time left with him ...I'm sure the two of you will spend it together.
1307088437372125184 2020-09-19 06:45:42 +0800 <BDT93261637> This is Heartbreaking! 😔 ...And, people still think Covid-19 is a Hoax, or it can't take them down if they get it. Do you really want to roll the dice and take that chance!?!  60 years old is Young ...She had a lot of good years left to live.  RIP Ms. Longfellow and Thank You 🙏
1307085878804787200 2020-09-19 06:35:32 +0800 <BDT93261637> Damn! 😳 ...Now Bill Barr's baby pictures are on the net!  How could such a cute little guy grow up to be the Ass Clown he is today? 😔

1306994043432456193 2020-09-19 00:30:37 +0800 <BDT93261637> This pretty much sums it up...  It's got'a suck being a mindless, Trump worshiping Sheep, incapable of putting down the Kool-aid and thinking for yourself.

To say Donald Trump is the best citizen America can produce to be POTUS is the biggest slap in the face to our country.  No more games, no more pretending Donald Trump has America's best interests at heart.  Times up, we need REAL LEADERSHIP!

You were right about Trump from the beginning, but then when you saw his popularity with a bunch of deplorable degenerates you caved and began French-kissing his ass.  You're nowhere near the political party you used to be!

Trump's never changed, and he's only gotten worse with the GOP as the wind beneath his wings.  So, since he's NEVER changed why has your Professional Opinion of him changed.  Sell Out!
1306689529580003343 2020-09-18 04:20:35 +0800 <BDT93261637> Here we go again...  Trump really believes we're as Dumb as [he] looks!

Truth be told, America was in a great place after Barack and Joe cleaned up the mess Bush and Cheney made.  America was poised to be as good as she had ever been -- even better.  But, then Trump happened 😔

It's not about waking everyone up and turning them against Trump -- that'll NEVER happen.  Trump has a hard base and a soft one. The hard base will drink the poisonous Kool-aid 24/7, but the soft base not so much.

1303857323153264640 2020-09-10 08:46:24 +0800 <BDT93261637> @chipfranklin I feel Trump would welcome such a thing, if that's what it takes for him to stay in office, and it seems his followers are hateful and resentful enough to do just that.  My God, did people follow Jesus Christ the way they follow Trump!?! They love him no matter what he screws up!

1303852114632937473 2020-09-10 08:25:43 +0800 <BDT93261637> @JKPreachersgirl Like Mitch McConnell, another living/breathing example of why we need term limits for Senators.  And, if not term limits for Senators, then at least have them compete for their seats every two years just like congressmen and women, instead of serving six year terms.
1303850733062819842 2020-09-10 08:20:13 +0800 <BDT93261637> @Katpa73 With all the despair caused by Trump we need glimmers of hope; small, beautiful distractions such as your lamp to help us get through another day.  The colors blue and yellow are very calming ...Good choice, I can see why you like it so much. 🙂
1303846989617074179 2020-09-10 08:05:21 +0800 <BDT93261637> @BrianKarem That's a pretty Piss-Poor excuse, making him sound not just inept, but woefully naive.  That's like having a house on fire and refusing to sound the alarm, because everyone was sleeping so peacefully.  From day one this man has been ill-equiped to hold the position of POTUS.
1303808570052542464 2020-09-10 05:32:41 +0800 <BDT93261637> @Teesa_Michele Whoever nominated him has an agenda and isn't playing with a full deck.  On what criteria/justification is he being nominated?!?  Unless they want to dumb-down the NPP and have it lose all credibility, by just handing it to unqualified individuals, then they should think again.

1303481025520111618 2020-09-09 07:51:08 +0800 <BDT93261637> The beginning of the end is definitely here.  You can only cross so many lines with the American people until even your most loyal supporters can't take anymore.  The way you know Trump's crazy(?) ...If he were same he'd know when to quit while he's ahead.  But, "No" ...Not Him!

But, they should be held accountable for the incredible amount of damage they caused, and the cost of fighting the fire.  So, I think a good amount of community service is appropriate.
1303367655127158787 2020-09-09 00:20:39 +0800 <BDT93261637> Twitter disciplined me for making a joke, a FUCKING joke.

I thought it hit the nail on the head regarding Trump's mental state.

If you haven't already, contact Joe Biden's campaign and ask for a meeting with him and Kamala.  Put this on their radar (so-to-speak) and she could be out of prison by the end of next January.

The way she thinks it's probably best she move, as she mentioned.  I mean, REALLY ...As bad a job as Trump has done in less than four years and your neighbor would rather we continue down this road.
1302672003501928449 2020-09-07 02:16:22 +0800 <BDT93261637> This is why I don't do Facebook, and I'm very leery of social media adds.

Because, he didn't petition for a PARDON like Flynn and Stone.  He could've kept his mouth shut and Trump would've certainly pardoned him for his loyalty, but he didn't want Trump's pardon!

That's one tough guy to just stand there and take all that!".  But, hearing it in his own words really pisses me off that Trump's modern-day Gestapo would treat a honorable Vet that way!

I suspect the cousin mentioned in the tweet cried because they truly love our country, and then woke up one day to realize Trump's destroying it.
1302563837489688578 2020-09-06 19:06:33 +0800 <BDT93261637> Someone gave these people the "Green Light" to think, plan, and behave this way and it was/is Donald Trump.  Donald Trump is not a true POTUS -- not in any way, shape, or form.  If anyone sincerely cares about America reaching and living up to its potential, then Trump has to go!

So what about you teaching your kids not to be like Trump -- remember that little speech.  Trump doesn't care about our military. He has a long record of disrespect for them, beginning with John McCain.

1301646381447294979 2020-09-04 06:20:55 +0800 <BDT93261637> @shereenskee Is this in response to the pastor who said, "The Lord gets excited when you get down on your knees."???  Just asking... 😄😅😂
1301645799537901571 2020-09-04 06:18:36 +0800 <BDT93261637> @shereenskee When referencing [what] "The Lurd" (a'la Madea) gets EXCITED about, he has to learn to phrase things just a tad bit better than that! 🙄
1301574241842860033 2020-09-04 01:34:15 +0800 <BDT93261637> @LepapillonBlu I want my faith in our justice system restored.  If he's guilty, and I believe he's guilty of several infractions, then I want him held accountable for his misdeeds JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.  No one's above the law -- No One! 🤨
1301552494502445056 2020-09-04 00:07:51 +0800 <BDT93261637> @wheelmikeoverly These "Crazy's" are making policing more difficult, not less difficult.  I respect all police officers until they give me a reason not to.  Trump has instigated this ...It's as if he's trying to set America on fire.
1301547429507010565 2020-09-03 23:47:43 +0800 <BDT93261637> The latest lie told by the Liar-in-Chief  This is vintage Trump: Tell a made up story about some "Super Secret", nefarious plan, to do political harm to him  Enough Already  Trump Repeats Conspiracy Theory About Super-Scary Antifa-Laden Planes  https://t.co/Omqeq5ojMa via @Yahoo
1301542933800325120 2020-09-03 23:29:51 +0800 <BDT93261637> If this is [all] the Republicans can come up with to try and embarrass Nancy Pelosi, then they've really got to try harder.  This is CHILDISH!  Pelosi calls private hair salon visit in San Francisco, against local regulations, 'clearly a setup'  https://t.co/apDVmm3498 via @Yahoo
1301442859414024193 2020-09-03 16:52:11 +0800 <BDT93261637> @AmberD1116 No album cover title, but to me it looks like Trump sifting through the rubble of Trump Tower.
1301438498227007493 2020-09-03 16:34:52 +0800 <BDT93261637> @davidmweissman We've finally rounded up all the MAGA's and put them on planes leaving the country, thereby truly Making America Great Again! 🥳🥳🥳
1301173471393845249 2020-09-02 23:01:44 +0800 <BDT93261637> @wondermichele @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @ProjectLincoln @TheUSASingers @JoyAnnReid @TheDemCoalition Unless Christianity means something totally new, then I didn't get the memo. I'm sorry, these people ARE NOT CHRISTIANS.
1301169521529630722 2020-09-02 22:46:03 +0800 <BDT93261637> @AmberD1116 What alternative universe are we living in???  This guy is actually, no kidding, the POTUS! 🙄  Reminds me of the running joke in Europe ...Question: What borders on Lunacy? Answer: Canada and Mexico!   If he's not gone this November we're doomed. 😔
1301167851198394372 2020-09-02 22:39:24 +0800 <BDT93261637> @Stop_Trump20 It'll never, ever happen ...He's like a religion to them, and we all know how difficult it is to try and tell someone THEIR religion doesn't have [the last] word on anything.
1301166571067408386 2020-09-02 22:34:19 +0800 <BDT93261637> @AmberD1116 And, as soon as we do, the Red States will grab their guns and invade the Blue States and steal everything in sight.  I've thought the same thing, but all that'll happen is the Red States will attempt to reclaim the Blue ones and remake them in [their] image.  Evil never rests!
1301164496006901760 2020-09-02 22:26:04 +0800 <BDT93261637> Got'a share this experience...  A Twitter user asked a question the other day about, "What Trump could do for the country right now.". So, I replied with the 1st funniest thing I could think of.  Twitter then scolds me, pauses my account, and has me take down the reply.  REALLY!  https://t.co/Rf65t39kLn
