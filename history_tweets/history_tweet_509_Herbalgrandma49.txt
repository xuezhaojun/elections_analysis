Rochester is hard blue but may get a suprise when the ballots are counted. If American flags are the Trump signs supporters don‚Äôt dare put out, then Olmsted county will go red for the first time since 1972!

They had to do a special station for all of the mail in ballots being ‚Äúhand delivered‚Äù because there was no trust they would get there. The early voting area was swamped, so they had a separate election judge take all of our ‚Äúmail ins‚Äù

1323636413829664768 2020-11-03 22:41:27 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @Listen4Always You are correct. 10 short years ago I listened to the voice of BHO &amp; feared they would destroy the country forever. That presidency was 8 long years of fear. DJT ended the reign of terror but as they attacked him hourly the fear remained. Today we end it. Today we take America!

1301201609892999168 2020-09-03 00:53:33 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @ETheFriend Server is back up &amp; running
1301201348147507200 2020-09-03 00:52:31 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> Could not agree more...parachutes optional
1301199625462968320 2020-09-03 00:45:40 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @ETheFriend And now the (Qmap . pub) (intentionality typed with spaces here) has been identified by twitter as potentially harmful. Brings up a warning and will not post. Anyway, there must be new ones because the site is down again
1301194424559505409 2020-09-03 00:25:00 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @ETheFriend Thank you E. We love you too! Platonically of course. I will wear that description proudly!
1301192756551913472 2020-09-03 00:18:22 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @Listen4Always Lydia, I‚Äôve put my notes away on this Stuart guy; videos are gone from you-tube. He fancies himself a‚Äùbuilder of the grid &amp; bot-troll sleuth ‚Äú researcher, former college prof, and has decided from his ‚Äúresearch‚Äù that qanon and all involved are an ‚Äúalternative reality game‚Äù
1301185989638074369 2020-09-02 23:51:29 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @Listen4Always Lydia, apparently the small bit of criticism that @StuartWShulman received has caused his tweets to disappear. No note that he has taken them private...just ‚Äútweets are not loading now‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Keep on keeping on dear Lydia. One more troll could not take the heat.
1301181551875690497 2020-09-02 23:33:51 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @Listen4Always Oh Lydia; that is exactly what that ‚Äúperson‚Äù was trying to achieve. Please stay with us. He‚Äôs just one more school yard bully. I‚Äôm doing some research on him, so far he seems to be a pretender, just one more ‚Äúman behind the curtain‚Äù&amp; attacking E through his followers.
1300943310257872897 2020-09-02 07:47:10 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @Listen4Always Take a listen to his explanation of our various views of the pandemic and then here is his header. But after all we are the conspiracy nuts, bots, and general menace to society  https://t.co/rAX0ig3vKf
1300938618047954949 2020-09-02 07:28:31 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @Listen4Always Just watched this. ?thinks que is some kind of networked game? And we are all suspect simply because we follow E and trust our President. All spoken by some troll-type setting himself up as ‚Äúexpert‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúbetter than thou‚Äù and told in the tone of a prof dissecting a bugü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Block.
1300897509087342593 2020-09-02 04:45:10 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> CNN needs to fact check itself before spreading unsubstantiated rumors. Maybe ask OAN for lessons in how to find and report real news
1300854129259147264 2020-09-02 01:52:47 +0800 <Herbalgrandma49> @GhoSTorM143 so who in Minnesota is going? Have flags &amp; truck &amp; diesel money &amp; lunch in the cooler! Please contact me!!
