1344070661082394627 2020-12-30 07:59:51 +0800 <mymose21> @Bill_Maxwell_ Probably a 90/10 I retweet just about everything I like. I tweet when I'm angry at the creature, or proud of somebody. And I do lots of gifs.
1343958688453828608 2020-12-30 00:34:55 +0800 <mymose21> @tonyposnanski Yep. Garbage.

1343374694653767681 2020-12-28 09:54:20 +0800 <mymose21> @angelasimms7 @RepAdamSchiff Don't you think if they cheated.... McConnell and Graham would have lost as well.. And we wouldn't be having a runoff in Georgia. Think about it. People are sick of the lies and bullshit. He was outvoted. Plain and simple.
1343336646369021955 2020-12-28 07:23:09 +0800 <mymose21> @MikeyB31150912 @RepAdamSchiff Good for you son.
1343288265072324608 2020-12-28 04:10:54 +0800 <mymose21> @duty2warn He humiliated himself. If he had  conceded, and pretended to act like  a normal person in public, he could have avoided that.
1343287076456984579 2020-12-28 04:06:10 +0800 <mymose21> @SassyKadiK He's a nut.

1343221204845527043 2020-12-27 23:44:25 +0800 <mymose21> @MysterySolvent A punk.

1343083980627832834 2020-12-27 14:39:08 +0800 <mymose21> Come on Georgia!
1343083031716900864 2020-12-27 14:35:22 +0800 <mymose21> @PreetBharara Does he think he can force the people to allow him to overthrow the government? Who in their right mind would want to stay where they are not wanted.
1343081246243631109 2020-12-27 14:28:17 +0800 <mymose21> @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump Cold Hearted Bastards.

1342956715600392193 2020-12-27 06:13:26 +0800 <mymose21> @RepAdamSchiff He is attacking the FBI, the DOJ and the Supreme Court. Besides all the other illegal stuff. How in the hell has he not been removed from the position of President of these United States??? Surely, something can be done. WHY has it not been done? Ridiculous. It's just ridiculous.

1342545985441058818 2020-12-26 03:01:20 +0800 <mymose21> @internetalena My reading this year has suffered terribly. I've taken my 80 y/o Mom to the library monthly for years. This year, we have tried the kindle. Just not the same, and I can't get her mind off cussing trump long enough to enjoy a book. Anxiety and lack of attention have overruled.

I actually didn't give much thought to it and didn't install the app on a couple phones I went through after that. My disgust with trump caused me to activate again. I enjoy the people I interact with.
1341860866925445123 2020-12-24 05:38:55 +0800 <mymose21> @Karenklwb @donwinslow He's hoping we will all be so googly eyed over the increase he's suggesting, that we will look the other way while he cheats, grifts and lies his way through the next couple weeks.
1341855236995084295 2020-12-24 05:16:33 +0800 <mymose21> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump If he thinks this would encourage us to accept his bullshit election crap...It will N O T. Sure, most of us need the money. But there's no way in hell I would want him another four years.
1341854204521041922 2020-12-24 05:12:27 +0800 <mymose21> @FriedliebLes That has crossed my mind.

1341476949269635078 2020-12-23 04:13:22 +0800 <mymose21> @Dknight10k I sort of look for McConnell to do it. It will have to come down to the wire, cause he's too old to want to put up with the bullshit. But he knows he wants to stay. Barr and Pence are already gone.

And trump is still getting away with his bullshit behavior towards ALL of us. Some are just too brainwashed to realize it. Come on man..Y'all have to step it up! Stop that lunatic.
1340821425788215303 2020-12-21 08:48:33 +0800 <mymose21> @AudreyStJames1 @TisharraRahl Right.

He's hoping it will be bad enough to distract from the 6th... bad enough to call in the military. That creature doesn't care how many lives are destroyed or lost. He's afraid of going to jail and losing his grift.

1340421286200307716 2020-12-20 06:18:33 +0800 <mymose21> @funder Nothing but keep stirring up his base. Some of these nuts are ready to die and kill for him. He should concede.

1340072023813459976 2020-12-19 07:10:42 +0800 <mymose21> @FriedliebLes I don't think we're done. But we are in a hell of a mess, and the trumpers will be blaming it all on the new administration, no matter how hard they work or what they accomplish. It really makes me sick.

It's just pence and his onlookers watching him get the vaccine. Shit. My first thought is how many thyroid &amp; BP pills have I got. Expecting the worst. So sick of this.

Too many threats being made, and that creature is just fueling the fire.  Are they just allowing them to keep going till they get them all rounded up and then arrest them? What? Enough is Enough

They just didn't count on him being such a selfish, sensitive loose cannon. With all his little helpers who have already been arrested.  They bet on the wrong dog.

Which means after 17 state AG's are sent home and shot down, it will pump up the anger of those who have been sending him their money. They truly believe he will win this. He's hoping for enough anger to try that martial law thing next.

1335087219976048641 2020-12-05 13:02:52 +0800 <mymose21> @amvetsupport I know a Marine who worships him because his church does. And I know a Ranger who supports him and calls it all fake news. They don't believe he ever said negative things about the military. Both smart guys that I've known for years. I'm frustrated and disappointed.

She had type A flu then. And by March after pneumonia and multiple steroids she gor over it with minor damage to the kidney. She gave one to my bro about years ago. Future looks bleak.

Not curious enough to check it out...but still. These are folks without anything still supporting that fool.

1330573574722220032 2020-11-23 02:07:15 +0800 <mymose21> @joelockhart @realDonaldTrump I never followed him. Easy enough just to look it up if I need to.
1330549480500957185 2020-11-23 00:31:31 +0800 <mymose21> @RockyMountViews My longest stretch was 8 months. I felt a sigh of relief for you. My God. It is a horrible way to live.
1330548560660717571 2020-11-23 00:27:51 +0800 <mymose21> This is my fear.

1330157872613875713 2020-11-21 22:35:24 +0800 <mymose21> @BetteMidler I pray they can't enjoy their Thanksgiving meals. That their hearts are convicted by thoughts and visions of the millions in food pantry lines trying to feed their families.

1330156650175533056 2020-11-21 22:30:33 +0800 <mymose21> @joelockhart He had a good response from his crazy base there. Probably feels like he has more control.

1329985213259247616 2020-11-21 11:09:19 +0800 <mymose21> @MysterySolvent Because he thinks his thugs will fight for him there.

If those ballots were checked.i think it would be revealed. He trashed the postal service, had several safe measures in place. He just didn't have enough. He underestimated just how many people despise him.
1329964341072900096 2020-11-21 09:46:23 +0800 <mymose21> @TravisAllen02 But did he really??
1329935180115681292 2020-11-21 07:50:30 +0800 <mymose21> @BlueResistExist Yes, me too.
1329934513712009217 2020-11-21 07:47:51 +0800 <mymose21> @SuzeQKnits I just heard he's at his cabin in quarrantine. But He is asymptomatic. I also heard that could be a cover for rehab.

1329863543768965125 2020-11-21 03:05:51 +0800 <mymose21> Good Grief. Would that pacify him enough to act like a human being for the next 8 weeks?

1329771811517706240 2020-11-20 21:01:20 +0800 <mymose21> @TomJChicago He gave it his all...right down to almost demolishing our postal service. All the pawns were in place. But it just wasn't enough. He should be incarcerated for the rest of his foolish life. Not only for that, but for the death, division and state of our Country. The lot of them.
1329768875957899265 2020-11-20 20:49:40 +0800 <mymose21> @joncoopertweets He thought he had every cheating thing, person, group in place.  He trashed our postal service, he fully expected it to be enough. It wasn't. He lost anyway. He should be afraid to stir up very much.

She was flipping through her usual news channels and once or twice a day she checks to see what they're lying about on faux. I think she does it to get herself stirred up. She said it was that comb in hair color, lol.

1329261658351529984 2020-11-19 11:14:10 +0800 <mymose21> Ain't it the truth.
1329259998304755712 2020-11-19 11:07:34 +0800 <mymose21> @InTheNoosphere Right now. People are dying. People are hungry, losing their homes, businesses, their loved ones....and they still voted for those friggin bastards. They still support them at the expense of their families. I don't understand it. And I can't believe nothing can be done. Dammit
1329258405106741249 2020-11-19 11:01:14 +0800 <mymose21> @sdr_medco It's like that in most of the red states. I wonder how much money those poor souls have sent that fucking grifter and now are in the food lines.

If someone named pence doesn't grow some balls and force the 25th amendment, we just think we've seem crazy shit. He doesn't care what happens to us.

He wants his supporters as riled up as possible. The AG will go after him. Let them get squared away first. People are dying.

Saying it now, aiming at him would make more of the shit he loves. I'm sure there's a statute of limitations. The AG will persue him when it's time.

If Biden could get on in and get financial help for food, rent, etc,. Send ppe and masks out, keep being him, It would go a long way. They might see who is for them and who is against them.
1328179884460564480 2020-11-16 11:35:35 +0800 <mymose21> @FordJohnathan5 Good on you!

1327972347765207040 2020-11-15 21:50:54 +0800 <mymose21> @WTFisgoingon911 @DrGJackBrown You're right. It does boil down to money. Pay the people to wear the masks and be able to stay home. Be able to pay the rent, buy the groceries, (they still might not want to take care of their kids) but they might stay home if they don't have the excuses. If trump shuts up.

1327806934561513472 2020-11-15 10:53:37 +0800 <mymose21> @DrGJackBrown I wish! I'm in a red state. Numbers going up everyday. So many trumpers. If Biden could take control, if they were to get financial help for lost wages, small businesses, ppe, and trump would shut the hell up, I think they would go along with it. I don't see it happening soon.
1327804731968933889 2020-11-15 10:44:52 +0800 <mymose21> @Smilan317 @Dknight10k I'm sorry! That's scary. I'll pray for her quick and complete recovery.
1327740793889697793 2020-11-15 06:30:48 +0800 <mymose21> It needs to be decided, announced and set in concrete NOW.
1327707062126718978 2020-11-15 04:16:45 +0800 <mymose21> @educated_educ8r Yes. And all I have to do is look at photos from 1919 and I realize it's not that hard. Trump has poisoned the minds of so many weaklings who probably wouldn't even be here had their great grandparents not worn them. We could save so many lives!

1327370765826658307 2020-11-14 06:00:26 +0800 <mymose21> Yes, it was.
1327369973883416576 2020-11-14 05:57:17 +0800 <mymose21> This.
1327369817989541888 2020-11-14 05:56:40 +0800 <mymose21> @AngrierWHStaff Somebody advised him to do it. Probably Geraldo.
1327354374780301313 2020-11-14 04:55:18 +0800 <mymose21> @mixedcraze @SenSchumer Agreed! Two more moths of waiting are going to result in many more unnecessary deaths, hurting people, lost businesses... Remove his useless ass and let's get this pandemic under control! Y'all are wasting precious time. Biden has won. Fair and square.

Lot's of somethings, but I feel much better after watching Biden dealing with it. He most certainly is Joe Cool. And I know his years have brought a wisdom that trump will never understand.
1326263850740682762 2020-11-11 04:41:57 +0800 <mymose21> @KhrissyChoate @mmpadellan It chilled me as well. But I loved Joe's response and chuckle. He knows what's going on and I feel sure he is prepared.

I "feel" it too. Our democracy is still in danger. I'm trying to settle, but I think somebody should have him removed as quickly as possible.
1325437196401315841 2020-11-08 21:57:07 +0800 <mymose21> @TimHannan That was my first thought! I still believe it.

1325265594606817280 2020-11-08 10:35:14 +0800 <mymose21> Yes!

1324850920870596608 2020-11-07 07:07:28 +0800 <mymose21> @atrupar They're treating him like the baby he is.
1324850609632194560 2020-11-07 07:06:14 +0800 <mymose21> @HKrassenstein They need to go ahead and announce Biden as the Winner. Shut down the counting center and tell the big baby to go to hell. Actually, tell him to pack his shit and get out of our house.
1324849931853701123 2020-11-07 07:03:32 +0800 <mymose21> @mmpadellan I'm afraid they're going to screw around too long.

1324822831797096449 2020-11-07 05:15:51 +0800 <mymose21> @Yvetteinsc @donwinslow I agree!
1324808987993378817 2020-11-07 04:20:51 +0800 <mymose21> @donwinslow Absolutely! The longer they tiptoe around it, the bigger the fit the baby is going to pitch. Do it! Mark the moment and let those chips fall where they may. The jerk is going to do whatever he's going to do, but stop letting him think he's in control of this. Only makes it worse.
1324799909757898753 2020-11-07 03:44:46 +0800 <mymose21> @JohnBrennan I'm sitting here listening to this tiptoeing on the news. We all know that we've never seen such an mess. Name Biden as the winner. Sooner the better. Lower the boom. We all know the big baby's going to fight it. He knows he's likely going to jail. Let him throw his fit. Pitiful

1323971147508174848 2020-11-04 20:51:34 +0800 <mymose21> @donwinslow I hope it is! But it looks shady from them.
1323859806537601024 2020-11-04 13:29:08 +0800 <mymose21> @donwinslow Fox just called Minnesota for Biden...what are they up to?
1323852418648625154 2020-11-04 12:59:47 +0800 <mymose21> @DaxGigandet Can't believe it.

1323849771619069953 2020-11-04 12:49:16 +0800 <mymose21> @FerrazzanoJay @jacksinboston I'm worried that they will go to work on discounting the mail in and early votes tomorrow. They've got sneaky shit up their sleeves. Count Every Vote!
1323849062156767232 2020-11-04 12:46:27 +0800 <mymose21> @donwinslow Count Every Vote!

1323794228640649221 2020-11-04 09:08:33 +0800 <mymose21> @BarackObama @CheriJacobus All the work that Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter have done throughout their lives to ensure legal voting in other countries.... Probably never dreaming it could happen in our own.

1321788655116103681 2020-10-29 20:19:07 +0800 <mymose21> @micket123 One hour. I agree...but I do like the extra hour to sleep.

1320814998780891146 2020-10-27 03:50:09 +0800 <mymose21> @KamalaHarris Not yet, but I am. I always voted on election day, but I'll probably slide in a little early this year.

1319607056203157505 2020-10-23 19:50:13 +0800 <mymose21> If faux news would offer him a high paying job and call him a star...he'd probably quit the presidency ad take it. All he wants is to be on TV.
1319470573702053888 2020-10-23 10:47:54 +0800 <mymose21> @RadioFreeTom Yes, and I'm mad as hell about it.
1319470137347592194 2020-10-23 10:46:09 +0800 <mymose21> @ChazBono He was just throwing lies. Slinging shit at the walls. Biden is a tough, patient man. He got cut off and told quickly, quickly, every time the moderator addressed him, and she let doofus go over without muting him. I'm wide awake and mad as hell.
1319468724844433410 2020-10-23 10:40:33 +0800 <mymose21> @DaxGigandet Go fuck yourself.

1319467431623053315 2020-10-23 10:35:24 +0800 <mymose21> @donwinslow Where's that mute button?
1319463728673378304 2020-10-23 10:20:42 +0800 <mymose21> Everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie or jab. Biden is doing an excellent job making his points while having to constantly defend against this nonsense. The jerk doesn't even make sense while throwing shit. Longer he talks the better, his mouth will get him in trouble.
1319379238026416128 2020-10-23 04:44:57 +0800 <mymose21> @darndifino @relationshipguy I had my 21,900th yesterday. Happy Birthday!

1319268381107888129 2020-10-22 21:24:27 +0800 <mymose21> @adamblust @johnpavlovitz Warms my heart! I am a big Leo Buscalgia fan as well. With parents who show no affection... Can you imagine! My granddad did though, and I soaked it up. I've worked to break that generational curse by showing affection and empathy to my children.

I can tell you that my fondest memories are of the loving and affectionate grandparents. My mom and dad aren't affectionate, and man, this made me yearn for a good hug from my grandpa.

1318522986048213002 2020-10-20 20:02:31 +0800 <mymose21> @kylegriffin1 It's mind control. He gets off on being able to dictate what his cult does and what they believe.

It was plenty good enough for my great-grandparents. But so many people here in the south are raising hell about it. Many still say it's a hoax. Many who have lost loved ones are not blaming the nut.

If pence agrees to give pardons for himself and his hooligans, there's that. But after his jealousy and pouting this morning over the bragging on pence at the debate, I can't see him giving in until the last minute.

1312893178782113795 2020-10-05 07:11:40 +0800 <mymose21> @KathrynArmbrus1 @funder All of those "doctors" that paraded out and bragged on how good he was doing. What the hell was that???  Does he have covid19 or not? Wouldn't they know? Surely they wouldn't jeopardize their reputations and careers to lie for him?  Is he asymptomatic and pretending to be sick?

1311273338434719744 2020-09-30 19:55:00 +0800 <mymose21> @MeidasTouch I think he was just trying to keep a hold of her arm. Lol

1311136525808214016 2020-09-30 10:51:22 +0800 <mymose21> @SethAbramson He should be arrested tonight.
1311130524694568963 2020-09-30 10:27:31 +0800 <mymose21> @ASlavitt He should be removed immediately as he walks out of that building.

I'll be proud of him no matter how it goes. I've been trying to argue with the ignorance for years, and I usually end up yelling "well then fuck you dumbass"!
1310958404865855488 2020-09-29 23:03:34 +0800 <mymose21> @NBCNews @jonallendc This is true. But what is that base? 35%? Come on people! LANDSLIDE.

That's why he's begging for it, because the man in charge rejected it. I wish he would do a surprise test. Wouldn't he shit.

1310681440586170368 2020-09-29 04:43:01 +0800 <mymose21> Well.... I think his only way out is to feign illness and let his VP take over and hope for a pardon. This ought to be quite a show.

1310570987801456640 2020-09-28 21:24:07 +0800 <mymose21> @USNCS @donwinslow @parscale @nytimes Well, sadly - most of his supporters don't care at all. They're drunk on that kool-aid. This is something that the GOP or SOMEONE must act on. And quickly. If they don't, they are more involved in his schemes than we can even imagine. And that is shattering.

1306969964369162240 2020-09-18 22:54:56 +0800 <mymose21> @TimHannan I agree. He won't debate Biden. I just don't know what catastrophe he will create, or how he will try and twist it. He only has to convince his cult. Every other person can see through it.

1306777472382492672 2020-09-18 10:10:02 +0800 <mymose21> @Julius_Kim I still think trump will back out. Something will come up. Or he will find a way to make it look like Biden is at fault for him canceling.
1306775034938171393 2020-09-18 10:00:21 +0800 <mymose21> @allensc77113655 @LadyConser @jmeacham @JoeBiden Amen! And we don't need perfection. We need decency and a good heart right now. Plenty of time on down the road for exceptional candidates. Right now we must turn this train wreck around and head in a healing direction. We have to heal the damage trump has done to our Country.

It's not going to be easy, and I can't see the very base of his supporters changing. I just pray that the stark differences between these two men will strike a chord with the conscience of those who are searching for the truth.
1306771431091572736 2020-09-18 09:46:02 +0800 <mymose21> @DexMcCain @jmeacham @JoeBiden Slowly Dex. Probably very slowly. I am exhausted from all the rudeness and hateful behavior. I just hope he wins, and four years from now we are well on the road to healing our Country. I pray that things get better.
1306770250407575552 2020-09-18 09:41:20 +0800 <mymose21> @AVindman I appreciate the both of you. And I thank you for your service. I'm proud of y'all.

Probably more so than anyone who has ever been in the race. And this race isn't a normal one. He's up against the most uncaring, rude, arrogant and disrespectful creature we've ever seen. It's going to be hard to take.
1306759700403367943 2020-09-18 08:59:25 +0800 <mymose21> @mtcatlady17 @brianschatz Hey, He's a normal decent human being who is having to answer to the world of shit that trump has created. The breaks give him a chance to regroup, but he's speaking from the heart. A good heart. I can't keep from getting flustered and mad when I try to talk about all this shit.
1306758435539693573 2020-09-18 08:54:24 +0800 <mymose21> @lalila2015 @FordJohnathan5 @JoeBiden I would be struggling myself and I don't stutter. He's stirred up. The ridiculousness and ignorance he faced with by trump is hard to answer to without getting stirred up. Hell, I can't argue with a cultist without getting angry and sputtering nonsensicly and using curse words.
1306756522911977473 2020-09-18 08:46:48 +0800 <mymose21> @atrupar Bless her heart. She got in over her head. Sold out and now trying to lay low I imagine.

1306753137940869122 2020-09-18 08:33:21 +0800 <mymose21> @lynnv378 You know what? I'm proud of him! I don't know how Joe Biden is holding it together as well as he is. I'm so stinkin' mad and disgusted I probably couldn't make any sense at all. When I get in an argument with a cultist I get overwhelmed because of the ignorance and lies.

1306033224154517506 2020-09-16 08:52:40 +0800 <mymose21> @funder I've been reading comments on FB - cultists are saying the dumbass will win, and that they don't believe Joe will show. I personally don't believe the dumbass will show, but he's got to figure out how to make it appear that Joe's the one who backs out. Pitiful.

1304584194148925440 2020-09-12 08:54:44 +0800 <mymose21> @klynnnn @DaneDach @northclarctica Right? I am old. I had my two kids when I was very young and a year apart. I waited many years for grands. I've held and patted my share of littles. I missed it. I've always been glad to help a mom in a bind, or let a child know I see them and they matter. It's sad these days.
1304580506986704896 2020-09-12 08:40:05 +0800 <mymose21> @PrettyBeaches @northclarctica I hate it too. Some of my own relatives have posted crap like that. And I've reminded them of our own gramps who is gone now. Lived to 95. He patted and kissed our heads and drove us around. He loved his big family, and we felt his love. The good kind. I'm affectionate as well.

I'm 60 and have always had two at a time. I stagger them in age. When one is about 5 -7, I get another (drop-off or rescue). They can never be replaced, but I can't be without.
