It took decades. This is incredibly fast. Please be realistic. Also put the boots to every far right government. Their incompetence is hurting us.

1341436743690592257 2020-12-23 01:33:37 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @Patricia_Ann_E @MarthPaynter Look at the original tweet by Tim. He stated they need more volunteers. She totally posts some other BS. Are you sure..... how many trials have stated THAT?
1341436215124316161 2020-12-23 01:31:31 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @LeanneHanuschuk Jealous.....  https://t.co/jza6xsBJWx

1341434351523831809 2020-12-23 01:24:06 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @LeanneHanuschuk Where.... not downtown.
1341434242329276421 2020-12-23 01:23:40 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Most Americans do not understand. The power the have with voting locally. Huge change can happen here. Voting at the State level also has a huge impact. Here you stop gerrymandering and voter suppression. This forces the federal government to act for you.

1341431493420150784 2020-12-23 01:12:45 +0800 <dwain_campbell> This is what happens. When for 30+ years. The far right has been allowed to spew propaganda.

They thought it was upwards of 50-60%. Now they don’t. So please find the latest stats. I would look at the WHO site.... they have collected data from around the world. Bigger sample size and more accurate.

1341423925645832192 2020-12-23 00:42:40 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @Patricia_Ann_E @MarthPaynter Talk with the drug companies about THAT. This was about Covid vaccines. They need volunteers... woman and children and minorities. This is the only way to find out if it is safe or not.
1341404955710767107 2020-12-22 23:27:18 +0800 <dwain_campbell> So what if a woman posed naked.... it is here right. Stop try to shame anyone for this.... it shows you and Pence are very similar....

No. They need enough people in each category to go through the testing. If they don’t have enough people. They can’t determine if it safe or not. They need more women....

If there are not test subjects... say not enough immunodeficiency people.... then we don’t have the data.... Simple as that. Huge reason why it is usually take 8-10 years to develop.

1330935003446841345 2020-11-24 02:03:27 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @RealistLil @RudiDueck @CTVNews When a post has been proven wrong... and it still gets spread. Along with believed. It is wrong and potentially harmful .
1330918245231017998 2020-11-24 00:56:51 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @meganbielby @vamputee @DrJayDrNo Yes I agree. why are they allowed to be ignorant until 36? Even at my age. I am ignorant about stuff. Until it is point out to me. I will do nothing. Then I go out and educate myself. But I'm a freak that way. Take care.
1330917800316026883 2020-11-24 00:55:05 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @meganbielby @vamputee @DrJayDrNo Meg.... you know better then this. You only know all about being a women, from being taught. At age 6 you were ignorant. Many men are ignorant, because they have not been taught. It is not all men are stupid issue. It is a lack of proper sexual education issue.
1330916534085009419 2020-11-24 00:50:03 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @Jay87413299 @baileygreen5533 @SpookyAnarchist la la la.... as a man your pathway to power is way easier just because you are a man... please read the definition. Yes not all men get to have that power.... just being a man gives you more power then the average women... deal with it...learn the word patriarchal.
1330915909947408395 2020-11-24 00:47:34 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @The_VeganBeast Do you even understand this.... men will say “this is how society oppresses men” and then describe patriarchy word for word?????? bye bye.
1330915325894770692 2020-11-24 00:45:15 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @vamputee @DrJayDrNo When you were 6 did you know everything about being a women. Did you have any help. Our society shuns any sex related teaching. Yet you expect men to somehow magically to know everything it took you years to learn....why is this? Yes they should get off their fucking lazy asses.
1330914522849177600 2020-11-24 00:42:04 +0800 <dwain_campbell> I am tired of these morons. so being me. I will be sending out 2 emails to each CE. 1 to the CEO and 1 to the Chairperson of the Board.

1330393955423244288 2020-11-22 14:13:31 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Manitoba is average roughly 8,000 tests a week over 41 weeks. Of course if you have 3 tests at once it counts as 3 not 1. Why are they not ramping up testing? Why???????? Why?  https://t.co/Vj2513tXZz

1330372876344684544 2020-11-22 12:49:45 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kid_prairie @Testify_Cn I have worked in this field. If you are testing only people who think you have covid. It sqews the numbers. Since 1/2 of the people do not show any signs. We have to ramp up our testing. This way we catch most of the people.
1330372380405936129 2020-11-22 12:47:47 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kid_prairie @Testify_Cn So if you test 100 people and get 10 positives you get what? Now here is the problem. we test 4,000 people a day. out of 1.2 million. 1st our sample size is to small. we refuse to test for asymptomatic people.... only with people who think they have symptoms. our numbers are BS.

1330279858899914752 2020-11-22 06:40:08 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @RedTail3d @FBananapants @losinghopein Here in Manitoba.... welfare hasn't risen since 1992... it is $771/month. I understand this.... would like to change it. They never thought it thru... did not realize it would take 2 yrs to fight it. This is why I am helping to try to bring in UBI.
1330279234187751425 2020-11-22 06:37:39 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @FBananapants @losinghopein See... this is where the confusion is. Are there 14 different disability programs. One for each Prov/Terr and one Federal?

Yes they go hand in hand...... but, With rapid testing. Lots and lots of rapid testing we can quarantine the pos. people. Everyone else lockdown for 4 weeks.

1330272762825412608 2020-11-22 06:11:56 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @losinghopein It might help and tell us more about what you are on. Who runs it. Then what you would like. Each province and territory has their own welfare and disability programs. I think the Federal Gov't has its own. We do not know what each does. Thanks.

Australia and New Zealand instituted buyback programs as part of their gun control measures. Thousands of weapons were collected in both countries. •

Big Business to make huge profits. So now these idiots are telling us what to do during a pandemic. They can't use science, because they have denied it for so long.

1326659369849614341 2020-11-12 06:53:36 +0800 <dwain_campbell> The best advice I could give to a 15 yr old me is.... when discussing or arguing with your partner. Shut up. Listen. Then repeat back what you think they are saying..... I really helps. You really are forced to understand what they are saying .
1326658489217740801 2020-11-12 06:50:06 +0800 <dwain_campbell> I have a question! What is your most rememberable thing about your last partner. For me it is always the same. Nice smile, great bum, and so smart and strong...
1326657604920119296 2020-11-12 06:46:35 +0800 <dwain_campbell> I’m wondering... how bad would Covid have been. If ever country followed science. Like the successful countries did. It would still be there... But hundreds of thousands of people would not have been infected with all the complications. The deaths would have be so much less.
1326655420719534081 2020-11-12 06:37:55 +0800 <dwain_campbell> If you want to see and understand voter suppression. Look at Georgia. They are recounting the votes. Only for the president. Why? Because they like all the other results . Recount ever vote in ever race, or do not recount at all. Pure voting suppression !!!!
1326654307140186112 2020-11-12 06:33:29 +0800 <dwain_campbell> After sex.... a touch by another person is the most wonderful thing in a world...

1326650426364628993 2020-11-12 06:18:04 +0800 <dwain_campbell> The best thing about History is we can look back at Trumpie.... he will be known as the most incompetent ignoramus president in American history . I am betting that it will take over 50 year to lose by almost 5 million votes again...

1326642533397483521 2020-11-12 05:46:42 +0800 <dwain_campbell> I have been suggesting to Elections Canada. They do all federal elections here in Canada. That we required every voter to mark your candidate if choice. Bye marking the circle at the end of their name. Then use a magic marker to totally cover their name. For almost 30 yrs.
1326640504897851392 2020-11-12 05:38:38 +0800 <dwain_campbell> All Bullies are cowards. Look at all the far right nut jobs right now. They are bitching cuz they lost... Pure cowardly behaviour!!!!

Knowing them... NOT. They never had a plan.... and are dealing with this extremely poorly. But... it is only the homeless... why should they care.
1325860014775443456 2020-11-10 01:57:15 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @emilydickems You tweeted this out... but did not say what city, province. So where, please.

1325846721226661889 2020-11-10 01:04:26 +0800 <dwain_campbell> I am noticing here in Canada. Where Covid outbreaks are going nuts. Each far right conservative government is blaming their citizens. They still are doing nothing to help stop it.
1325846230560174081 2020-11-10 01:02:29 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Actually.... your incompetent government had a critical role to play..... your governments incompetents has led us to this. Stop blaming us for your ignorance and incompetents... please step down.

1325845113654796288 2020-11-10 00:58:02 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @JeffRybak I had nothing to do with you being a lawyer. It has everything to do with you lack of knowledge of science. It has everything to do with you defending incompetents. You are justifying hundreds of preventative deaths .
1325844016634634240 2020-11-10 00:53:41 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @JackMeseyton You do realize that here in Winnipeg. We have The National Microbiology Laboratory, Canada’s CDC. They totally ignored them also....
1325843978424512518 2020-11-10 00:53:32 +0800 <dwain_campbell> You do realize that here in Winnipeg. We have The National Microbiology Laboratory, Canada’s CDC. They totally ignored them also....

1325842645965365248 2020-11-10 00:48:14 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @IntakeStatus I know.... that is why with a good government. You can force more hotels to open up. Then tell them how much you will pay them.
1325842287390126080 2020-11-10 00:46:48 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @LavenderLady0 @godless_mom The one who coveted every woman?
1325841738062159872 2020-11-10 00:44:37 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @JeffRybak Sorry... I did not know that you were a defence lawyer. Now I understand why you are defending their incompetent plan.
1325841430158307334 2020-11-10 00:43:24 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @JeffRybak Exactly. This is what happens when you do not understand how science works. If they followed the science... Like successful countries did. You would not have to defend incompetent ignorant leaders... Why ARE you defending incompetents?
1325840990175854592 2020-11-10 00:41:39 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @JeffRybak This is a pandemic. You follow the science. See what worked in other pandemics. You don’t ignore it. Bad analogy....
1325840479833894914 2020-11-10 00:39:37 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @IntakeStatus There has been so many people. Trying to tell our cities and governments. To learn from history. Spread the poor and homeless across cities. In hotels/motels. Do not gather them in one place. This just facilitates the spread of Covid.
1325839521800310785 2020-11-10 00:35:49 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @IntakeStatus Is that the internment camp. With the cages?

1325838916532908032 2020-11-10 00:33:25 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @JeffRybak If everyone was properly informed.... you would not be in this mess. That is why we have governments. It is very easy for incompetent governments to blame the people. A great government goes out of it way. To do everything to help its people....
1325838401128427520 2020-11-10 00:31:22 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @JeffRybak Kinda funny... in the successful countries. Everyone had personal responsibilities also. Yet for some odd reason... they were still successful. So why are you defending a total lack of leadership. Didn’t follow science. Didn’t financially help everyone. Provided no leadership!
1325837725463842819 2020-11-10 00:28:41 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @MY_KINDA_SEX_ED @JustinTrudeau They would have to make a new law.... to take this away from the provincial governments. Now they hopefully will. They should just go for UBI..
1325837345313099777 2020-11-10 00:27:10 +0800 <dwain_campbell> For all of you here in Manitoba. Praising Scott and Bart. Why did it take 8 deaths before our media started to report on the conditions at maples PCH? The union has been complaining for months . Everyone knew the 2nd wave was coming. Seniors are still very vulnerable.

1325297756991184896 2020-11-08 12:43:02 +0800 <dwain_campbell> There a quite a lot of fix seats that were won... voter suppression and gerrymandering are still rampant in the USA.

1325296424599261184 2020-11-08 12:37:45 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Dems..... you have to control down ticket voting. Control the states Congress’s... you can final get rid of voter suppression. Along with gerrymandering.
1325296071245918215 2020-11-08 12:36:20 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Americans please get your shit together. You need both of Georgia’s senate seats. You have to take control of the senate. Otherwise . Nothing will be accomplished. Totally grassroots. Get out the vote... masses numbers .... massive.
1325294817220456448 2020-11-08 12:31:21 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Still waiting for any reporter to tell us about a Covid outbreak in a Winnipeg homeless shelter.... wtf
1325294324376952832 2020-11-08 12:29:24 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @CanadaBasic Also... since UBI would be federal ... with all provincial and territorial welfare and disabilities. Wiped out.... There will no claw backs.
1325293672938708995 2020-11-08 12:26:49 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @CanadaBasic For your example... Instead of rental subsidies.... The government pays the difference.
1325293259661352960 2020-11-08 12:25:10 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @CanadaBasic Ok I understand. The problem of this is. They are using the term wrong. Affordable housing is when any poor person, family , etc. Only spends significantly less then 1/4 of their disposal monthly income on rent. With UBI ... you can now do this...
1325291882549669888 2020-11-08 12:19:42 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @WordswithSteph @electroboyusa Sadly none of them will be going to jail soon.

1325290405999513601 2020-11-08 12:13:50 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @CanadaBasic Hmmmm... the housing thing... is for the homeless..... So in reality both UBI and affordable housing are helping the poor. They have to both go hand in hand... With UBI one can now afford housing. But. Without affordable housing. It really doesn’t help.

1325209941141983232 2020-11-08 06:54:05 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @LindaUhrich Totally beside the point. The homeless population deserve to know where outbreaks are happening. Kinda like parents need to know if their kids schools have a outbreak .... They don’t have homes... Wow ... just wow.

1325201853752123392 2020-11-08 06:21:57 +0800 <dwain_campbell> It is way past time. For our reporters here in Manitoba and Canada. To hold our government accountable. They are not following science. So maybe. Find out what really is happening! For the homeless, seniors, the poor and in hospitals... not really hard. It is called journalism.

1319513894629502976 2020-10-23 13:40:02 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Last year. I went to the CAEH conference. Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. It was 1,500 people. Only 150 homeless or lived experience people. 99% of talks were by people who help the homeless. Like going to a woman’s conference. With only men telling them everything to do.

1319505115988946944 2020-10-23 13:05:09 +0800 <dwain_campbell> I am dealing with 100 Canadian cities.

1319452081275555840 2020-10-23 09:34:25 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kid_prairie @MJosling53 Our Premiers hate to show weakness or failure. So they want a great economy and hardly any positive results. Both are wrong during a pandemic. Close everything down. UBI and small biz support. Massive testing and tracing.
1319451641867743233 2020-10-23 09:32:40 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kid_prairie @MJosling53 Right now.... we have to do mass testing. Take a 100 people sample. Put it together. Then test. If neg... move on. If pos... test one by one. We have to ramp up testing and tracing.
1319451186173374464 2020-10-23 09:30:51 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kid_prairie @MJosling53 Canada is not doing all that bad. If we could take away all the premiers powers.... we would be doing better. Slow down the spread. You know how. Till it is very small. Then test everyone, constantly. Wait until we have vaccines... several. We are very luck that it hardly mutates
1319447487862591488 2020-10-23 09:16:09 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Wow...... just wow.... if I twas her..... I would just walk out and quit!  https://t.co/cUrjKJbyZI

I twas talking about... per plane... at the airport. Yes they are ok... just 2 generations behind. If we were in Asia or NZ... they would be great. I am very sarcastic..... just not with science and facts.
1319438892773171202 2020-10-23 08:42:00 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kid_prairie @MJosling53 It does work. Most people just do not understand the basics of testing for a virus. The test itself is 15 mins. You still have to get everything ready. It only does one test at a time. Then you take it out, read it.... clean everything... start again.
1319437864787013632 2020-10-23 08:37:55 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @no_goblins No idea what that means.....  what is the cool stuff by the window? As a Canadian... i don't vote in the usa.....
1319436309841072128 2020-10-23 08:31:44 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kid_prairie @MJosling53 It takes 5 mins plus to set up one test. Then 15 to do the test. Then several mins to see the results......That is just for 1 person..... So you need several hundred machines for each plane.... yup very easy to do.

1319345171432009728 2020-10-23 02:29:35 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @InfectMb Because they were busy asking for us to donate PPE for frontline staff. Also we have a family DR. Running our response. Luckily WE DON’T have Canada’s version of CDC right here in Winnipeg.

Those who need UBI... will fall in the lowest tax bracket . It also eliminates all welfare workers. Along with the red tape costs.
1319340963886624768 2020-10-23 02:12:52 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @toffachandler @cafreeland Why? When corporate welfare started.... No one lost their property? False claim. Please educate yourself.

Then brought in locked doors with the requirement for everyone to show ID. Even my 74 yr old neighbours. Why the ID requirement? Mainly is a blatant Racist tactic.....
1316441505733713921 2020-10-15 02:11:27 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Manitoba Government is Racist. For the last couple of years. There has been a uptick in theft from downtown liquor stores. Why. Mainly due to poverty. Poverty leads to crime. If I’m middle income. I can afford booze as a coping mechanism. So what does our government do....

1315864548440596480 2020-10-13 11:58:50 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Actually you are incorrect. Indigenous people had a mass genocide thrust upon them. Black Americans had slavery thrust upon them. Similar but also vastly different. Oh Black history month? Why not black/indigenous month?

No generalist whom only have a basic understanding of epidemics. Whom are not recommending masks right from the start like a epidemics specialist did!
1311089589147242496 2020-09-30 07:44:51 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @kihossack @MBGov Wow. So you love a generalization. Whom only has a basic understanding of epidemics. No wonder why Manitoba is failing. Look up Dr Fauci. Is he a generalist or a specialist? Correct. He specializes in epidemics. Just like we should have.

1303778912523022336 2020-09-10 03:34:50 +0800 <dwain_campbell> If you listen to Brent Roussin, he always says there's little benefit in asymptomatic testing (can test negative today, positive tomorrow).  He is Manitoba’s chief medicine Dr. He was a family Dr. We need a epidemiology. A person whom specializes in epidemics.
1303778254965227520 2020-09-10 03:32:13 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @ScottBilleck @gliverpool9966 If they do give us numbers. It is because they are not doing it. Look up the requirements to be tested. Nothing there about been asymptotic and been tested. It is the exact opposite!
1303777730480070656 2020-09-10 03:30:08 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @ScottBilleck @gliverpool9966 Because our government is more concerned about pinching pennies. Very Sad.

This way you ID all the people who have it. This way you do not let silent spreaders keep spreading. We are fucking up big time by ignoring science 101.
1303776693291638784 2020-09-10 03:26:01 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @ScottBilleck @gliverpool9966 Please look at his background. A family Dr. Wow. I like listening to Drs. Who specializes in Epidemiology during a pandemic. This is what they study. A family Dr. Doesn’t specialize in this.

1303773874845184000 2020-09-10 03:14:49 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @ScottBilleck @gliverpool9966 I will give you a hint. They don’t test for this. They only test if you think you have symptoms. Or if you are showing symptoms . This is why ramping up testing is extremely important. They are ignoring silent spreaders? Why?
1303773044465307650 2020-09-10 03:11:31 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @ScottBilleck @gliverpool9966 How many tests done in asymptotic people?

We have tested just essential workers for months. Only 1 month ago. The public could be tested. Only if they show symptoms. No tests for asymptomatic  people.

Being religious causes people to be fearful. Big difference. With out science we would not know what is going on. Ignoring it only makes it worse.

You just know that they are wide spread in both your Army, all branches and in you police forces.... WOW!
1300932295105208320 2020-09-02 07:03:23 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @daleethompson Most Provinces have done as good as any Southern usa State.... we are lucky because not many world travellers come to Canada when this first hit.
1300931890229125120 2020-09-02 07:01:47 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @daleethompson So they did it only in 14 countries... but show only 8 WTF is this BS......
1300927203241148416 2020-09-02 06:43:09 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @daleethompson I love how all the worlds countries are not even listed....

1300924158394511360 2020-09-02 06:31:04 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @brabant_adam @DemocracyStorm @LancelotLinkSpy @KingJames @FCHWPO @thatnegus_sb @DangeRussWilson @Titans @snapjudgment Look at how your FBI and CIA do it. Psychological evaluation. Why? So they catch them before they enter. For the cops... you do it to everyone. Now they are no longer qualified to be cops. You also test everyone i become a cop.
1300922160773390341 2020-09-02 06:23:07 +0800 <dwain_campbell> They way we have done this in the past doesn't work.... so lets do it correct this time.
1300922159729053696 2020-09-02 06:23:07 +0800 <dwain_campbell> 3. Information. One of the biggest problems for the homeless anywhere is. They do not know what services and resources are out there. So let build huge web sites with this information. It also help frontline staff. We can see what resources are duplicated and which are missing.
1300922158575624192 2020-09-02 06:23:07 +0800 <dwain_campbell> No more huge ghetto  buildings. Now we have universal. 25% of all new apartments should be affordable housing. Give all the old ones 3 years to bring it up to that. The Province, State, etc. will pay the difference to the landlords'... instead of the way they are doing it now.
1300922157493411840 2020-09-02 06:23:06 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Homelessness: There really are 3 things that can truly hep to end Homelessness:  1. UBI..... instead of Welfare or Minimum wage. Go to a        Universal Basic Income.  2. Affordable Housing. We have to scrap how we have done this in the past. No more slum housing etc.
1300894860740669440 2020-09-02 04:34:38 +0800 <dwain_campbell> Way to go Manitoba.
1300889369067175937 2020-09-02 04:12:49 +0800 <dwain_campbell> You could also do psychic evaluation testing. Weed out Racists and bullies.

1300884913781010432 2020-09-02 03:55:07 +0800 <dwain_campbell> @LeahGazan What about Canada’s homeless? Or people on welfare?
