These kiddos (and you) make my stressful days so much brighter. I may not always get to join the chatter, but I do see a lot of it. Merry Christmas Eve to you all!

1335382277916819456 2020-12-06 08:35:19 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @Fiobaio We live in Tucson, and we are under voluntary shelter in place and a mandatory lockdown orders from 10p-5a until 23 Dec as of last night. SO over this crap!!
1335079311871598594 2020-12-05 12:31:27 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> This saddens me to my core! And they wonder why our small businesses are closing!
1335074739740545024 2020-12-05 12:13:17 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @AOC I waitressed to put myself through nursing. I was married with 3 kids. My dad died during finals. His death was the ONLY time I cried while working and in school. Don't pull the "poor me" card! You have no backbone! These remarks just piss me off!!
1334556914781327361 2020-12-04 01:55:38 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @ScottBaio I am aused by some of what your trolls say, and wonder why you even bother replying to them, then I see some of your replies and they just make my day! 😂 They have nothing better to do, obviously; always attacking us patriots for something! 🙄😂
1333866439648821248 2020-12-02 04:11:55 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @dandrasimmons 😂😂 You are too cute! Always love your sense of humor!! At least you know you get it honestly, through @mommadeesimmons 😂😉
1333865467669168129 2020-12-02 04:08:04 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @ScottBaio True patriots want to follow true patriots! 🇺🇸😁
1333862825559670784 2020-12-02 03:57:34 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @revenge_rh I liked LL when she first arrived, but each episode made it harder and harder to like her. I'm looking forward to RHOD without LL now!
1333496596307136514 2020-12-01 03:42:18 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @dandrasimmons I am SO excited to see ya'll on my tv again! This year has been a mess, and we all need more to take our minds off of all the chaos surrounding us! I may have giggled a little too hard when you flipped your face shield down over your face, covering your eyes!
1333234889206890496 2020-11-30 10:22:22 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @kirstiealley Dude, just "GTS" the word! GTS = Google That Shit!
1333230039081443331 2020-11-30 10:03:06 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @TiffanyNoth Sorry, but if you break into our house, our Belgian Melanois wouldn't allow you to make it to our refrigerator. 😂 Just a fact. 😉
1333124707349008384 2020-11-30 03:04:33 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @ScottBaio 😂 I'm not a celebrity, and I've gotten a few of those. People never cease to amaze me! 😂 Like water on a duck's back, you just gotta let it roll! 😉
1333122557445226496 2020-11-30 02:56:00 +0800 <MonkeysBrat> @kirstiealley 1. A Fry Baby 2. New queen size bed 3. New cookware 4. New coffee pot 5. New bath robe. You said just gifts...these are on my list. I've been good this year! 😁
