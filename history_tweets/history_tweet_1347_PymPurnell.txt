1344041720963624964 2020-12-30 06:04:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay That was almost funny - a very good attempt

1344041165167996928 2020-12-30 06:02:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MPIainDS @WhatsUp_1971 err - we should take a good hard look in the mirror before we can point the finger at someone else  https://t.co/oM12NOEhYB

1344026959567839233 2020-12-30 05:06:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay &lt;&lt;this obviously leaves me with a quandry - who to believe  and I have to start with the person who commits the acts and the reasons they give
1344026636778434560 2020-12-30 05:04:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay It seems like a good place to start at least   I think the problem (for you) is you have no real explanation for why these men do commit acts of terrorism - but you are so desperate for it not to be islam you feel the need to assert it is not - despite them saying it is&gt;&gt;
1344026058614575105 2020-12-30 05:02:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay You are trying to convince me that you know why these people are committing acts of terrorism better than you do  I take their word over yours - yes  You can tell me why you do things - I will believe you - not someone who says they know why you did something  seem fair?
1344025650139697152 2020-12-30 05:01:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay we are talking about those who commit acts of terror and their relationship with islam   muslim is the person - islam is the belief system - you put the two togther and you get the action system
1344024713882955776 2020-12-30 04:57:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay the burden of proof is on you - they have already admitted to the crime and said why they did it - you are in the jury and saying they got the reasons wrong  great - tell us all why they got it wrong - get out there and tell everyone - because then terrorism would end
1344023688937676801 2020-12-30 04:53:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay if you can claim they are not muslims - then they can make the same claim about you  This is childish stuff - I am very surprised we keep having this discussion - I suspect it is deliberate deflection on your part

1343997747842715652 2020-12-30 03:10:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> Could someone organise a BLM charity football match - I think I've found a team for them   https://t.co/TlaWVaclCM

1343987082109341698 2020-12-30 02:27:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Flora34921110 and parts of Africa - if I recall correctly it was to grow food  serious threats to freedom - I just wish freedom would stand up for itself a bit

1343968455402389511 2020-12-30 01:13:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exinterplod can WHO be trusted - or will they just reinforce the Chinese version   I was more thinking of our media - politicians etc - the lack of interest / questionning is interesting (to me)
1343965383536087048 2020-12-30 01:01:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> Why is there such a lack of interest in the origins of covid?  Remember when they told us it came from people eating bats ar a wet food market  then others said it may have been created in the Wuhan lab as a possible vaccine for Sars?  why has this not be investigated?

1343867990903828480 2020-12-29 18:34:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay No - I belived that islam was a religion of peace - because that was what we were told - but all around me I could see terrorist acts being committed in the name of islam that made me question this
1343867674321973250 2020-12-29 18:33:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay &lt;&lt;I try to discuss islam with as many muslims as I can on twitter in order to improve my understanding of it - and your interaction is educative
1343867332196765696 2020-12-29 18:31:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay I do have a certain view of islam - I used to belive it was a religion of peace (as I was told) but then I started to question that - and people like you simply confirm my concerns about it &gt;&gt;
1343863318264557568 2020-12-29 18:15:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @sabaone @allisonpearson why is the west quiet - because it is terrified of being called racist or islamophobic

1343842793668681728 2020-12-29 16:54:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay I was asking you - as a human, as a muslim

1343212715129663489 2020-12-27 23:10:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 as for what islam is - that was my suggestion - we take a look  you say you are prepared to do so - and then deflect from doing so  I suspect it is because you are afraid of what you will find - I suspect you do know that islam has some part to play in terror

1343208490815393797 2020-12-27 22:53:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @copland11 and increasing here
1343207368163811338 2020-12-27 22:49:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @copland11 and what is happening to the white people is very worrying - more so the lack of media reporting   possibly a warning for us
1343206455319683073 2020-12-27 22:45:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @copland11 Winnie was - not sure about the rest

1343199275019329536 2020-12-27 22:17:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @thespacepirate or of indoctrinating the people and building more white guilt

1343196819929653250 2020-12-27 22:07:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> Nelson Mandela was in prison for terrorism offences - not because he asked for a referendum

1343177254663237632 2020-12-27 20:49:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 so I trust you point out the inherent racism in black societies  etc

1343157467556040704 2020-12-27 19:31:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay You do understand me  what is more important - human law or gods law / instruction?  If god tells you to do something - but humans tell you not to - what do you do?
1343154425540567040 2020-12-27 19:19:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @PKXDC1 @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay does it depend if my instructions were coming from what I told you were god?

1342855707012558848 2020-12-26 23:32:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 I agree that no one person can claim to know the whole truth about islam - apart from mohammad (maybe) - and I think his behaviour gives us a few clues as to its intentions
1342855084724662272 2020-12-26 23:29:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 and what do we call innocent white girls who are gang raped, tortured, abused and killed - or victims or knife attacks - or bombings?  do you have a word for them?
1342854728099753986 2020-12-26 23:28:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 you are projecting Ben

1342830883162779648 2020-12-26 21:53:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 we have investigated western imperialism - no one defends it - no one wants to go back to those days  But we are allowing to be done to us - the exact same thing
1342830610755297281 2020-12-26 21:52:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 there is no such thing as islamophobia  the best way to help all sections of the country is to have a full, frank and honest discussion about islam - warts and all
1342830364490924035 2020-12-26 21:51:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 The average domestic abuse victim will be attacked 32 times (if I recall correctly) - they frequently blame themselves - they often excuse the behaviour of the attacker

1342826178185457667 2020-12-26 21:34:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 all that matters (I think) is that we (as a soceity) have a full, frank and honest look at islam are wrong  They are telling us they are acting on behalf of islam - we should at least listen to what they say
1342825381544529920 2020-12-26 21:31:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 you keep saying minority - what do you mean - 1 person in a million?  It takes 2 men to kill hundreds, to destroy free speech in the western world and 1 man to stop teachers teaching free speech  the rest of us now live in constant fear

1342819723050950658 2020-12-26 21:09:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 but whatever islam is or is not - I put it to you Ben that you are in no more of a position to say what it is or is not than I  and personally speaking I think your defence of it is moral cowardice - it needs proper / full scruitny - same as any other ideology
1342819101870354433 2020-12-26 21:06:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 which I agree - I do not  who does understand it better - ISIS or the muslim preaching peace and tolerance?  or maybe - and here is the real cruncher - maybe they are both right?  you will know them by their deeds is usually a good guide
1342818731693637634 2020-12-26 21:05:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 @David18054465 so - your not a muslim - but you are 100% certain you know more about islam than an imman etc?  I am not sure what reading it in Arabic would do - apart from my inability to do providing you with an opportunity to say I do not understand it properly&gt;&gt;

Our religion is Islam - obedience to the one true God, Allah, and following the footsteps of the final prophet and messenger Muhammad... This is how our ethical stances are dictated.

1341824183735640064 2020-12-24 03:13:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KonstantinKisin because there is (or was) a keen sense of fair play - and it is not the result that always matters - but how we play the game  Play with honour, respect, decency - too often success is dependent upon betraying / sacrificing friends and family
1341820975697031169 2020-12-24 03:00:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Margaretb2107 totally agreed - and the police, politicians and all decent people everywhere

1341819166769242115 2020-12-24 02:53:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ARKovnat Hi Alex - It is a requirement, unless you have an exemption - which the lady did - she told the security guard - who must accept her word - he continues to badger her and others join in - it is not acceptable to treat a person like that

1341781594273705984 2020-12-24 00:23:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AlexaWhiteBee agreed - we are becomming increasingly aggressive towards people - a very worrying trend has developed
1341781082069458946 2020-12-24 00:21:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AlexaWhiteBee agreed - she told them she was exempt - that should have been the end of it - a disgusting way to treat a customer - a human

1341464462897913856 2020-12-23 03:23:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HumanRi56 @unclehenders @Riastrad5 @adam_wardley you've called people dumbass - told them they are talking shite   You are very dismissive and belittling of other opinions
1341458428175257601 2020-12-23 02:59:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HumanRi56 @unclehenders @Riastrad5 @adam_wardley concerned about immigration - racist concerned about grooming gangs - racist concerned about terrorism - racist
1341457949672271874 2020-12-23 02:57:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HumanRi56 @unclehenders @Riastrad5 @adam_wardley you're demonstrating for me - just call people racists - dismiss them and belittle them - then you do not have to consider them
1341456976128176129 2020-12-23 02:54:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HumanRi56 @unclehenders @Riastrad5 @adam_wardley what is happening to the brits is similar but not the same - in so much as being excluded from the decision making process which is increasingly concerned with the welfare of all ethnic groups - except the British - who do not actually exist
1341454408450793476 2020-12-23 02:43:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @sparkyhamill @IainB56 you want a normal independent Scotland?  pot calls kettle black?

1341397522376511488 2020-12-22 22:57:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @cassalyn01 I think it is fair to say they are being more openly discussed - but as we see with our discussion - it is very difficult to get to the point where you can actually have a meaningful discussion about it - without the smears and racism etc
1341397187687837701 2020-12-22 22:56:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @cassalyn01 this arguement is nonsense - and basically means - white people are not allowed to express concerns because they then encourage terrorism

1341396070677536769 2020-12-22 22:51:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @cassalyn01 wrong - we are concentrating on the grooming gangs because of the fear of being called a racist that allowed it to happen
1341395760089341953 2020-12-22 22:50:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @cassalyn01 err - self evidently the guilty were not punished - because we were terrified of being called racists   something which you are perpetuating   please feel free to speak out at any time - I would be happy to let you do so

1341392818883981317 2020-12-22 22:39:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @BenRoudin @cassalyn01 the reason why I speak mostly about the grooming gangs is because of the reason they were allowed to go unchecked - fear of racism - and the possible motivations behind it - anti white hatred and possible faith / cultural factors
1341392384505106433 2020-12-22 22:37:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @BenRoudin @cassalyn01 no - you are projecting  Listen very carefully - all abuse of children is wrong  it is very sad that I need to state that - I hoped people would agree on this basic statement

1341389691254398981 2020-12-22 22:26:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @BenRoudin @cassalyn01 I do accept that white men commit the most rape offences (as far as we can tell) and in Nigeria they are black  what you can not acknowledge is that fear of being called racists has allowed gang rape of white girls to go unchallenged - in fact you perpetuate that fear
1341387922688368641 2020-12-22 22:19:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @BenRoudin @cassalyn01 what do I want with any rapist - I want them caught, prosecuted and serving custodial sentences   and I want us to learn why it is happening so we can prevent it from repeating

1341387178912440328 2020-12-22 22:16:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @David18054465 @REP57910897 don't believe me?  would I still be a racist if I agreed with you? would I be a racist if I was BME?

1341386192567357441 2020-12-22 22:12:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @RobertR19881590 @David18054465 @REP57910897 yes

1341385313894227968 2020-12-22 22:09:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @martynasmo is white cleansing not taking place then?
1341384679149191168 2020-12-22 22:06:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @robertwoolley @ElliotElinor except that was not what he was doing - the comparison is in your own head - it says more about you than Danny Baker

1341383643588145155 2020-12-22 22:02:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BenRoudin @socialtechno what is wrong with targetting shops - directly - or indirectly - you tell me  what is wrong with promoting things due to ethnicity - you tell me?  https://t.co/6nczlXOfX2
1341371703008636930 2020-12-22 21:15:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @martynasmo how would I feel?  OK  I agree fascists and racists never win - but it usually helps if we can correctly identify them and not just accuse those we do not agree with
1341371273834860546 2020-12-22 21:13:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HenryGerrard4 seems fair
1341362368270512130 2020-12-22 20:38:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AnthonyCrawle12 brilliant
1341362268328636416 2020-12-22 20:37:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 hang on - it seems (to me) you might be contradicting yourself  can you just answer 2 simple questions please  1 - are you saying that white people will become the minority as some stage in the future? 2 - are you saying this is not ethnic cleansing?
1341361611882307587 2020-12-22 20:35:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @socialtechno @BenRoudin No - I am trying to tell you that we did not ignore them because we were terrifed of being called racists

1341360746802925569 2020-12-22 20:31:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @robertwoolley @ElliotElinor the Danny Baker is a very good example - it did not cross his mind to attack Meghan because of her skin tone - he was poking fun at the monarchy - at priviledge - but people read into it something that was not there - and he could not defend himself&gt;&gt;
1341345784369963011 2020-12-22 19:32:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BolusDr @Zoddd2 @NiceButNaughty5 I did not give the police an excuse for failure - this is what happened
1341345542228615168 2020-12-22 19:31:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I think we should take a serious look at why grooming gangs were targetting white girls and allowed to get away with it for so long - fear of being called a racist was a contributing factor
1341345057090244608 2020-12-22 19:29:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 where have I ever said that with more POC more grooming gangs occur?  It is important to me that white people remain in the UK - yes - if it is important to you that no white people stay in the UK I would suggest that it is you who is the racist
1341344224814522373 2020-12-22 19:25:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 Please provide evidence
1341344011496402944 2020-12-22 19:25:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Hitchensfan agreed   I think it is now used to justify anti white prejudice, bigotry and hatred
1341343600127426560 2020-12-22 19:23:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @London19721 @2tweetaboutit it is a familiar pattern all over the country
1341343077601058817 2020-12-22 19:21:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KevDog3_14159 agreed
1341342279580213248 2020-12-22 19:18:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HenryGerrard4 how many is OK?  can we keep it at that amount - less? - more?
1341340361982156800 2020-12-22 19:10:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I know I am not a racist - and I know it will not make any difference to you - you have passed judgement upon me   this is what I am talking about
1341340074915606529 2020-12-22 19:09:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 a racist = white person who thinks   It is insanity to call someone a racist simply because they disagree with you - this is your projection, intolerance and bigotry on show - not mine - own it
1341339721964859394 2020-12-22 19:08:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 wow - terrorism is more likely from people like me?  This is what I am talking about - multiple attacks by non white people - and somehow we still blame white people for something they are not doing
1341338807724093440 2020-12-22 19:04:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> and yes - I am afraid that ethnic cleansing is taken place and yes - I am afraid that we are too scared to talk about it because people will call us racists
1341338587548278786 2020-12-22 19:03:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 afraid of multiculturalism - more projection   yes - I am afraid of terrorism - I am afraid of growing anti white sentiments and discrimination against white people - I am afraid of rape gangs   and I am afraid our fear of being called a racist is tearing us apart
1341336970128207873 2020-12-22 18:57:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I have never suggested any such thing - you are projecting  I am suggesting we talk about mass immigration and what it has done to our country and has it lead to ethnic cleansing of white people
1341336135197454336 2020-12-22 18:53:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 what am I suggesting?
1341335891499954177 2020-12-22 18:52:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 bingo -'roll over and die'  Imagine if I had said that to you - it is your bigotry on show   Things will change
1341335036474380289 2020-12-22 18:49:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 and now we are facing the real possability that ethnic cleansing is actually taking place - but we are terrified to talk about it with any honesty - we just pretend British people are not really white - skin colour really does not matter - and anyway - white people are racists
1341334672232558592 2020-12-22 18:48:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 recent (last 70?) years of immigration has changed this common link (skin colour) - but shared cultural values have held us together - but cultural differences are emerging and growing - and anti white hatred is being encouraged and growing - by portraying white people as racists
1341333906872791041 2020-12-22 18:44:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 hang on - white people have the right to exist - same as everyone else.  I suspect we agree that historically the British have been white - that has been the most obvious common feature - same in Nigeria, China and all across the world - people are recognised by skin colour
1341332627018686464 2020-12-22 18:39:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 Do white people have the right to exist?
1341332234129838080 2020-12-22 18:38:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @robertwoolley @ElliotElinor what good points have BLM got?
1341331432896081923 2020-12-22 18:35:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I agree - there is more to an ethnic group than the colour of their skin   You know nothing about me
1341330747756584960 2020-12-22 18:32:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @socialtechno @BenRoudin Terrorist attacks - rape gangs - positive discrimination - black pound day etc etc etc etc etc
1341329465000030208 2020-12-22 18:27:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @marcasok @ElliotElinor obviously not everyones cup of tea
1341329101492240385 2020-12-22 18:25:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @kayelljay @floWdaBgiBehT @BenRoudin @cassalyn01 do you mean like intolerance towards rape gangs targetting white kids?
1341327489596071936 2020-12-22 18:19:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @socialtechno @BenRoudin you know what you are saying is inaccurate
1341327224457314304 2020-12-22 18:18:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 It is your bigotry on show again - not mine
1341186829173874690 2020-12-22 09:00:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @robertwoolley @ElliotElinor what good point do BLM have?  I am not denying people rights to regard themselves as British
1341186499417694209 2020-12-22 08:59:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @voixdesilence that must be it
1341186434468855808 2020-12-22 08:58:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ElliotElinor @andymacmichael he was not an imperialist - he knew the empire was over   You are projecting
1341186054771109890 2020-12-22 08:57:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @robertwoolley @ElliotElinor I agree(ish)
1341185815028887558 2020-12-22 08:56:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ElliotElinor I tell you what - two wrongs do not make a right
1341185649618108416 2020-12-22 08:55:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @robertwoolley @ElliotElinor errrr  who else can make police, politicians and footballers kneel at the click of a finger?
1341184956660391936 2020-12-22 08:53:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ElliotElinor agreed - no one person can speak the truth - all we can do is part of the journey toward it   belittling others, ignoring them, insulting them is not part of the journey - it is preventing it
1341184476546777093 2020-12-22 08:51:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ElliotElinor totally agreed - might I suggest you are projecting
1341184313203826688 2020-12-22 08:50:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ElliotElinor is truth racist?
1341184213064642560 2020-12-22 08:50:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ElliotElinor so the evidence is no good - none of those things are true?
1341183950966960128 2020-12-22 08:49:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannychips__ you might want to take your own advice first before passing it on

1341179204415741954 2020-12-22 08:30:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hmrhd123 no one is trying to remove you - grow up

1341178522409324545 2020-12-22 08:27:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PapaGlider @Riastrad5 @pilenile two wrongs do not make a right we can not change what has been done but we can ensure we do not repeat past sins and we should endevour to ensure past sins are not commited against us
1341178150689140736 2020-12-22 08:26:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @farhadesmaeili4 Enoch  I am defending nothing

1341175827740946432 2020-12-22 08:16:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Paper_Champ_ and you Joe -all the best son shine
1341175598031515648 2020-12-22 08:15:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannychips__ that was part of it - but it mostly comes from just actually thinking for myself - you should try it - you might like it - and it sounds like you need it more than me
1341175357349785600 2020-12-22 08:14:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DangoFruit @squeezyjohn I'm pretty sure I wouldn't - but just to be sure - do you want to put a bet on it?

1341169799263625217 2020-12-22 07:52:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BobbyTwoShoes8 wow - two shoes, but two left feet
1341169634918199304 2020-12-22 07:52:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Zoddd2 @BolusDr @NiceButNaughty5 agreed - it is well documented that fear of being called a racist prevented authorities, media and politicians from looking into this - how many children could have been saved?  it is a stain on our collective soul this happened
1341169211775840257 2020-12-22 07:50:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DoctorHood76 bright and simple - I think that is fair
1341168469190922241 2020-12-22 07:47:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Zoddd2 @unclehenders agreed - although I would settle with convictions and very long sentences
1341168011110182912 2020-12-22 07:45:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BolusDr @Zoddd2 @NiceButNaughty5 I agree there was an abuse of power - abuse works in this way   this has been well known for a very long time  what is new - is the fear of being called a racist
1341167380949557257 2020-12-22 07:43:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @thegordonkerr you're just saying that
1341167287005528066 2020-12-22 07:42:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Zoddd2 @unclehenders agreed - where are the cases of white gangs targetting muslim or BME kids - and what would happen if there were
1341166827808972800 2020-12-22 07:41:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Zoddd2 @BolusDr @NiceButNaughty5 and no one was ever afraid of being called a racist for speaking out about it
1341166295958622209 2020-12-22 07:38:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @unclehenders @Zoddd2 raped by 70 men - only 2 convicted   https://t.co/FqKrYn8Gn3

1341164110348767235 2020-12-22 07:30:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MelvinJBragg @Riastrad5 @unclehenders there was a case I recall in Telford (i think) a child was raped by 57 men - only 6(?) were convicted - 50 men not in the stats - apologies for being vague on facts - it was some time ago I read it  this was not uncommon
1341163239560851458 2020-12-22 07:26:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @amberrose3331 @shahaaaaadddd @hmrhd123 cheers Amber

1341162038266122243 2020-12-22 07:22:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @diondraws @squeezyjohn who said you were destroying it?
1341161759797891073 2020-12-22 07:20:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @squeezyjohn @diondraws is that a bit like pot calls the kettle black?

1341159518810611712 2020-12-22 07:12:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I agree that murder attracts more attention (usually)
1341158762401460225 2020-12-22 07:09:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @diondraws @nattydread777 Is it because they like a bit of sun shine?
1341158461166522368 2020-12-22 07:07:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TomHedwyn it would also have been a lie  That is your projection - and says more about you than me
1341158126125498372 2020-12-22 07:06:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @diondraws @squeezyjohn I think it would help us all - if we stopped calling people racists - talked openly about what was happening to our country and try to find ways of moving forward together   I am just less sure this is possible these days - we are very divided it seems to me
1341157196818751489 2020-12-22 07:02:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hoddles10 social media
1341157008486100993 2020-12-22 07:02:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 Yes - that Jack the Ripper is kept in the national conciousness and Delory Grant is not - and is it because he is black - the investigation into this case was hampered by fear of being called racists same with grooming gangs - we dismiss them - why?
1341155962476965891 2020-12-22 06:57:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @amberrose3331 @shahaaaaadddd @hmrhd123 populated only by whites?  that is your projection - not mine - and says more about your bigotry than mine
1341155683752943616 2020-12-22 06:56:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @squeezyjohn No worries John - glad I was of assistance in helping you dismiss them
1341155264968462339 2020-12-22 06:55:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 he is not a fable - the crimes were real - the culprit was never caught
1341154985686552576 2020-12-22 06:54:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @shahaaaaadddd @hmrhd123 are you a muslim?

1341154029896937472 2020-12-22 06:50:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @squeezyjohn Not quite John - although I suspect you see him like that - easy to dismiss like that - saves you the trouble of actually having to think about what he said  - you can simply dismiss him as the ranting madman
1341153464995487749 2020-12-22 06:47:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lakevie46625015 it's not supposed to be ironic   Thus it was in the beginning: the Apaches and their homes each created for the other by God himself. When they are taken from these homes they sicken and die. How long will it be until it is said, there are no Apaches?
1341153126905229317 2020-12-22 06:46:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I'm pretty sure Jack the Ripper was before your time - but I suspect you may know that name - and a few others I could suggest

1341152149577842692 2020-12-22 06:42:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Tararabumdeay0 @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 is ethnic cleansing - a wrong? is gang rape of children - a wrong? is being terrified of being called a racist so we are too afraid to talk about these issues - a wrong? is Delroy Grant - a wrong?

1341151607266959360 2020-12-22 06:40:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 it is interesting and telling that UK's most prolific sexual offender is not well known - do you think it might be because he is black?
1341151292480229376 2020-12-22 06:39:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Tararabumdeay0 @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 agreed - there is much wrong within our history - much right  same with all people all over  two wrongs do not make a right - do not commit wrongs - and do not let a wrong be done to you
1341150870680068096 2020-12-22 06:37:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @shahaaaaadddd @hmrhd123 you know nothing about me - that is your projection - not mine - it says more about your bigotry than it does about mine  grow up son
1341150668099301387 2020-12-22 06:36:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 out of interest - had you ever heard of him?
1341150158390702080 2020-12-22 06:34:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 agreed - bad people come in all shapes and sizes - all colours - all genders  pointing them out does not make anyone a racist  and to say or imply it does is wrong and damaging

1341148929337995265 2020-12-22 06:29:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Riastrad5 @pilenile UK's most prolific sex offender - barely anyone knows him   https://t.co/anSSjFYe63
1341148412956307456 2020-12-22 06:27:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Riastrad5 @pilenile Delroy Grant is a very interesting example - it is believed he raped possibly 500 people - men, women - mostly OAP's - all white  Original photo fit lightened him - did not want to think it could be a black male committing these crimes - might get called racist  https://t.co/MS942UtWCU
1341147733877534722 2020-12-22 06:25:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 😂😂😂😂🤣brilliant - I nearly wet myself
1341147395615289345 2020-12-22 06:23:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 in the same way the Native Amercians did not need immigration
1341147228589715458 2020-12-22 06:23:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 try 40  we do not need immigration
1341146889908080640 2020-12-22 06:21:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 It does stand - you just do not want it to
1341146683040788482 2020-12-22 06:21:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JustABloke19 agreed - why did that happen?
1341146493613465600 2020-12-22 06:20:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FreakyCyclist about what?
1341146383152234497 2020-12-22 06:19:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 Thus it was in the beginning: the Apaches and their homes each created for the other by God himself. When they are taken from these homes they sicken and die. How long will it be until it is said, there are no Apaches?  substitue English for Apache
1341144839690342401 2020-12-22 06:13:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hmrhd123 I hope it does not come to that - I just hope we can start talking with honesty and frankness about what is happening
1341144447715827722 2020-12-22 06:12:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 Nope
1341144066185179140 2020-12-22 06:10:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 You do not get to choose where you are born - but your parents or grandparents got to choose where they went
1341143264859201538 2020-12-22 06:07:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 &lt;&lt;either way - we shall see how this works out - I hope people start to think about what is happening - and I hope to help if I can
1341143034134736898 2020-12-22 06:06:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 &lt;&lt;maybe we  are reaching a point where we will look at this with open minds - or continue to shout racist in the hope of shutting down debate - denial is an easy option when the truth is so hard to accept &gt;&gt;
1341142731519893513 2020-12-22 06:05:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 &gt;&gt;while contributing to the ethnic cleansing and possible genocide of the English / British people from these islands  - those who speak about these issues are called racists and it works to prevent full and honest discussion &gt;&gt;
1341142404565524480 2020-12-22 06:04:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @tjwaldron @Riastrad5 The British are decent, fair minded people - our laws, and culture are products of this - we accepted immigration - but mass immigration and associated dogma has allowed social and cultural unrest to grow &gt;&gt;
1341141423840763905 2020-12-22 06:00:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Nickfury_Double you mean am I white man who thinks for himself?
1341141191467950080 2020-12-22 05:59:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 No one is saying that - that is your projection  what is being said is 'do not report or comment on gang rape of white children because that makes you a racist'
1341140208276951040 2020-12-22 05:55:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 it is what you are saying - and it is this fear of being called racists that has created this mess in the first place - it is destroying our society / culture
1341139041018851333 2020-12-22 05:50:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 just out of interest - how many white people (as a percentage) can remain in UK?  45% 35% 25% 15% less?  how many would be OK with you?
1341138699036352512 2020-12-22 05:49:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 what you are saying is that white people can not complain about their children being gang raped, abused, tortured, and murdered  think about that for a moment
1341137832430215169 2020-12-22 05:45:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 London / Brum etc -  white minority Saville Town - total white replacement demographic projections - white minority 2066 (maybe sooner)  I suspect you do not want to acknowledge it is happening because of the moral dilemma it will put you in
1341137349414182914 2020-12-22 05:43:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I think you'll find there are always winners and losers sugar
1341136293800108037 2020-12-22 05:39:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I think you'll find its a lot closer than we imagine  https://t.co/hafeUHgF3i
1341135981467095041 2020-12-22 05:38:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 no one who ever moved anywhere did it for the benefit of the country they were moving to - they did it for their own benefit - money, opportunity, housing, health care etc
1341135059034787841 2020-12-22 05:34:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 when is ethnic cleansing - not? when is genocide - not?
1341134773641744391 2020-12-22 05:33:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> and when the black population become a minority - pretend they did not exist anyway  good idea?
1341134565960798213 2020-12-22 05:32:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 tell you what - let's start a mass migration program to Nigeria - get millions of Europeans to move there  - give them houses and money and call anyone who opposes this idea racist - and encourage them to have as many children as possible - and watch what happens over time&gt;&gt;
1341133926211989507 2020-12-22 05:30:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 I think I do understand - you are attempting to claim that British people do not exist - therefore it will not matter when they are all replaced
1341133503333806080 2020-12-22 05:28:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nattydread777 I think you are proving my point for me
1341132789530374145 2020-12-22 05:25:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 anything else that might help identify a Nigerian from a Chinese person - or British  anything at all?
1341131176359157766 2020-12-22 05:19:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pilenile @Riastrad5 is it the same way one wanders around Lagos and can tell which fool comes from Nigeria?
1341129999294865409 2020-12-22 05:14:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GJSykes2 aljezeera - perpetuating the smear campaign
1341123750813708293 2020-12-22 04:49:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RobertR19881590 @REP57910897 No - their addiction has grown since then
1341122608461467654 2020-12-22 04:45:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> Enoch Powell is trending for a reason  HE WAS RIGHT  https://t.co/XcYmlCqkMI
1341121738751565825 2020-12-22 04:41:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GJSykes2 But we will never know for sure - which is another curious incident in this whole story - a forgotten women - a smeared politician and on and on it goes
1341121399868575748 2020-12-22 04:40:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GJSykes2 Powell always said he would not reveal the name of the women and it seems the letter was misplaced or lost  Others had confirmed the letter did exist and while it has never been confirmed to be Ms Cotterill it is felt she might be the person (as the article points out)
1341119007408140291 2020-12-22 04:31:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DouglasKMurray the problem is - he would not listen, and instead accuse you of something - and worse - you are highly likely to get convicted
1341118212256239617 2020-12-22 04:27:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> Now they are taking the bojo's
1341116622262644738 2020-12-22 04:21:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Suffragentleman when all the men are women, and all the women are men - will the women want to become men again, and the men women?
1341112897901047809 2020-12-22 04:06:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Spooly5 agreed - another career destroyed by the false accusation of racism - another life ruined and the truth once again ignored
1341109921648140290 2020-12-22 03:54:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @s_charlene @ANDREWWILBY1 @Doctor_Thomas If I recall correctly it was not his own QC - later the sentence was quashed  Misrepesentation of the law at best -  possible an abuse of
1341106805393543169 2020-12-22 03:42:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @YouKipperLad @2tweetaboutit The women is thought to be Druscilla Cotterill - her husband was killed in the war - she was alone - also smeared as a racist by the council
1341106075337158665 2020-12-22 03:39:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @frdavidlloyd yes - because it works - we have not really come up with a counter to their attacks - yet?  But the words of Enoch are proven to have been true - and god willing - that will motivate people to think a bit deeper
1341105263898669059 2020-12-22 03:36:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Scugnizzo60 totally agreed
1341105174291558406 2020-12-22 03:36:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @frdavidlloyd agreed - we all bought into it - we were supposed to - we were indoctrinated
1341100025426956288 2020-12-22 03:15:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Derektu25384307 agreed
1341098714459467776 2020-12-22 03:10:24 +0800 <PymPurnell>  https://t.co/DsZ2eymrp5
1341097785949601793 2020-12-22 03:06:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> So Ms Cotterill was forgotten - not even a foot note in our history, while Enochs name was dragged through the mud  Yet - what he said - what he was warning us about, has been proven to be true time and time again  We should have listened
1341097007604256770 2020-12-22 03:03:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> the media and his political opponents accused him of being a racist - a charge he refuted - and which was never proven - but it did not stop them smearing and discrediting him  A tactic that worked brilliantly   #EnochPowell
1341096593991344128 2020-12-22 03:01:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> Enoch Powell is trending  His rivers of blood speech was (in part) inspired by a letter written by Driscilla Coterill who was (imo) the first victim of political correctness - excrement was posted through her letter box and she was accused of being a racist for complaining  https://t.co/WDme5G5qmy
1341093099813171201 2020-12-22 02:48:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog or Tom does not want to face the reality of the situation which he applauds  How does one admit to oneself that what one believes in is doing to others that what one has spent a life time condemning
1341092578574422016 2020-12-22 02:46:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Veritas01074319 @RAF_Luton agreed - they'll (twitter HQ) will get rid of him soon - poking too much fun at those who know best
1341091973235695620 2020-12-22 02:43:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @obx_on @MailOnline yes
1341091792205344768 2020-12-22 02:42:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AngelaPower7 agreed - a blast of fresh air
1341091378600828931 2020-12-22 02:41:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Veritas01074319 @RAF_Luton it's one of those parody accounts - a bloody good one
1341066848167751693 2020-12-22 01:03:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CharlesCalthro7 they - social, cultural and political elite etc
1341066682056536064 2020-12-22 01:03:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CharlesCalthro7 Like many - he has reached the cultural heights - and seeks to use his position and influence for his own agenda   His lack of willingness to consider the other side will be his (their) undoing - they are cut from the same cloth (hive mind)
1341065157187911680 2020-12-22 00:57:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CharlesCalthro7 and he's trying to take us all down with him
1341063536123006983 2020-12-22 00:50:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> is secular code for dead?
1341063040066854916 2020-12-22 00:48:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RationalTruisms agreed - it is the usual tactic - if they can not refute the evidence - shout racist!  Problem is - it works
1341061242211987458 2020-12-22 00:41:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SomersetScouser they've got an R number - and a slogan 'protect the NHS'   and scientists as advisors - and a willing press to scare the public  they can do anything they like
1341060189986967553 2020-12-22 00:37:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SomersetScouser the independent is very devious in its use of language - expert at deceit, anti white hatred and blame - Der Sturmer 2020
1341059448106868738 2020-12-22 00:34:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> Is it true Tom - is ethnic cleansing taking place?
1341059172461400064 2020-12-22 00:33:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> Maybe if you stopped indoctrinating BAME kids into believing they were the constant victims of white racism they would actually get on with making a positive effort?
1341056973379407880 2020-12-22 00:24:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MSANNCOOPER agreed - firstly terrorise them - then manipulate them
1341055255094697984 2020-12-22 00:17:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> Target?  is that really the right word to use?

1341037809956757506 2020-12-21 23:08:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ownedbynon @ConstantinStHe1 I get the feeling they will be on their way - btw - the two things are possibly connected
1341029543860166657 2020-12-21 22:35:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @retrospare @PatAltEast but is it true?
1341029185784045570 2020-12-21 22:34:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> is it true?  is ethnic cleansing happening in UK?
1341028602666766338 2020-12-21 22:31:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Weimar61369949 @buttonbox21 It seems to me that people are talking and thinking about these things more - maybe there will be a rewakening - hopefully there will be (i think we need it)
1341027403641081859 2020-12-21 22:27:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TheGrandDayOut @LindaLetitbe I would go so far as to say anti English / anti white (anti British) bigotry is a necessary requirement
1341026472480399361 2020-12-21 22:23:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Weimar61369949 totally agreed - as a culture we have thrown the baby out with the bath water - there may (or may not be a God) - but there is right and wrong - there is good and evil - and we should be willing to search for and defend these ideals
1341025608437035009 2020-12-21 22:19:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> does anyone working in MSM ever support this country?
1341024768984813568 2020-12-21 22:16:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta something like what is happening in New Zealand?    https://t.co/X9kU0Avmqy
1340939774123778048 2020-12-21 16:38:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> Yes - calling white people racists
1340936863046090752 2020-12-21 16:27:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire Like I said - we shall have to agree to disagree - this is about you
1340935858891988993 2020-12-21 16:23:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire no one was ever afraid of being called a racist and was able to do their job
1340935613084790785 2020-12-21 16:22:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire you have sentenced him - that is on you  I have taken a different view - that is on me  I ask you to look within yourself for the source of your judgement - this is more about you than Tommy
1340934712571940865 2020-12-21 16:18:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire rubbish - total tosh
1340934453393240065 2020-12-21 16:17:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire You are wrong about him
1340934233875951618 2020-12-21 16:16:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire hatred - that is your projection  far right - is your projection   this about your bigotry - not his
1340933945119170561 2020-12-21 16:15:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta I agree - I just do not know if any party would stand on such a manifesto - and if they did if they would get elected
1340933537990647810 2020-12-21 16:14:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire you do not like the comparison because it forces you to rethink - you recognise the justice with the suffragette movement - but you do not (want to) in Tommys cause
1340933129880686592 2020-12-21 16:12:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire I was not defending fraud - although I do think in his case he was hard done by - this is just my opinion   I accept you do not like him - I hope you would contemplate on where that dislike comes from but I suspect not
1340931762499809280 2020-12-21 16:07:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire yes = it is about standing up for what you believe is right when the law says you are wrong, when so many people do not agree with you - but in the end - you are proven to have been correct

1340656861478055938 2020-12-20 21:54:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> I'm not saying it is terrorism - I'm just suspicious when incidents like this happen that it could be - and we should keep an eye open because the authorities / media will possibly try to portray it as something else if it is   https://t.co/CGzUUxCZSc

1340651780456259584 2020-12-20 21:34:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Cancelledxxx @Fox_Claire think about what you are saying  https://t.co/K3VwZLyOXY
1340650202953342977 2020-12-20 21:28:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Numbersmatter1 @Fox_Claire quite right - the law is never wrong  https://t.co/WpR6YJZ7w8
1340648939025027073 2020-12-20 21:23:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Fox_Claire yes - first they came for Tommy Robinson, but they said he was islamophobic / racist - so we did nothing  What happens if we do not defend everyones rights - do we  all lose out in the long run - or just those we deem unworthy?
1340643560618663937 2020-12-20 21:01:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> BRILLIANT  All those countries banning travel to and from UK - but we can't even stop illegal migrants getting on a rubber dinghy and crossing the sodding channel - or stop filght to and from china - in case someone somewhere call us racists  https://t.co/nSQRtNOXpQ
1340639435793321984 2020-12-20 20:45:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta which brings to mind Malthus - any given population in any closed environment will reach an optimum population from which it will begin to decline and never recover
1340639205660237825 2020-12-20 20:44:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta are these birth rates (and fertility) due to environmental factors, social, cultural or physilogical and psychological - or combination of all   can we do anything to change?
1340638617308377093 2020-12-20 20:42:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta Here in the west (and Japan) we have a problem with decling birth rates (and possible fertility rates) - so the need for immigration increases   which presents its own problems (as we are witnessing)
1340637899491041281 2020-12-20 20:39:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta it is a very difficult subject to discuss - have you seen this   https://t.co/oOgA7emu7t
1340637284669009921 2020-12-20 20:36:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RuxanaNargol @derbyfile @gmpolice agreed - it is highly effective conquest philosophy - brilliant - I am not sure there is anything as good  It will take enormous effort to resist
1340607199173877760 2020-12-20 18:37:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @derbyfile @RuxanaNargol @gmpolice agreed - that would be a very good start   But it seems to me - rules / laws and interpretations of them are becomming increasingly anti white in theme   I am not sure any govt can act
1340590204990722048 2020-12-20 17:29:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RuxanaNargol @gmpolice I think it goes deeper - our culture is infected with a fear of being called a racist and blaming white people
1340583843431112704 2020-12-20 17:04:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta maybe the problem is with democracy?
1340580743240687616 2020-12-20 16:52:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta agreed
1340578536713842689 2020-12-20 16:43:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DPJHodges it has made our institutions (Police, courts, media, social services etc) incapable of making reasonable decisions and we now live in a 2 tier system - where you receive favourable treatment if you are not white and anti white hatred is ignored
1340577784297566208 2020-12-20 16:40:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DPJHodges Mr Hodges - I think our society is infected with a fear of being called racist - which has allowed this to happen - and we must start to try to unravel this&gt;&gt;
1340575942608101378 2020-12-20 16:33:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta agreed - I hope we start electing better - although it seems a very poor selection
1340395337626882049 2020-12-20 04:35:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @bjornfri2020 it was a rather silly thing to do - using ones own children as a political tool is never a good idea - especially in cases like this
1340392961792761856 2020-12-20 04:26:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> Can People Get BSE? People can get a version of BSE called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). As of 2019, 232 people worldwide are known to have become sick with vCJD, and unfortunately, they all have died
1340392603666280449 2020-12-20 04:24:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> WHATEVER YOU DO - THINK FOR YOURSELF  we must not allow these public figures to manipulate us into doing something that is not in our interests  (I am not saying - take the vaccine - I am not saying - dont take the vaccine - I AM SAYING - MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION)  https://t.co/uftQnyi9Ta

1340331522667270150 2020-12-20 00:21:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> Dear Politicians - why is it you feel the need to do all our thinking for us - are we so lacking in intelligence that we can not make any sensible decisions for ourselves  and if so - where does this end
1340259054896246791 2020-12-19 19:33:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Veritas01074319 agreed - when a culture admires celebrity more than family faith, and friendship - something is seriously wrong - and in decline
1340245018506883073 2020-12-19 18:38:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> How did we ever get to the stage where we now need the Government to tell us how many people we can have Christmas dinner with?  Are we so usless and stupid that we are now incapable of making this simple decision?  https://t.co/KTWBhdjw6C
1340243239513821185 2020-12-19 18:31:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewdoyle_com @scubagasman Our culture is infected with anti white hatred, blame, bigotry and prejudice - we must be brave enough to speak out about it
1340242416872398848 2020-12-19 18:27:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MaggieOliverUK The fear of being called racist is destroying our institutions - our Police and judicial systems

1340234247714590725 2020-12-19 17:55:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Veritas01074319 I think it's worse - so desperate to manipulate us and portray themselves as somehow worthy / virteous / decent - they throw themselves at it
1340025833222791181 2020-12-19 04:07:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @libertarianism Yet sadly - they avoided investigating / reporting on the false imprisonment and solitary confinement of Tommy Robinson
1339869360937201666 2020-12-18 17:45:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @muzzy1965 we are being replaced - literally in front of our eyes

1339163030551220226 2020-12-16 18:58:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @PKXDC1 @BighighBBJay we are talking about decapitation of a teacher - teaching about free speech  more deception from Khublai Khan
1339159633030688768 2020-12-16 18:45:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @moreinfomate @PKXDC1 @BighighBBJay when you do come back - try to answer the specific questions about Samuel Paty - any attempts to deflect or avoid discussing this case will be interpreted (by me) as deceit
1339158843763331078 2020-12-16 18:42:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @khublaikhan @moreinfomate @PKXDC1 @BighighBBJay cha away   It is hard to understand what the limits are if they are not properly defined or unreasonable - or discriminatory - or tyrannical or unjust etc etc etc
1339158503022358528 2020-12-16 18:40:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @deerfold @Mephistophilles It's no good saying it is OK to disagree and then keep trying to tell the other person they are wrong  agree to disagree and move on
1339158331223666688 2020-12-16 18:40:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @deerfold @Mephistophilles It depends how they do it  calling people racists etc is trying to shut people down  disagreeing is healthy   But there comes a point when both parties who disagree need to go their separate ways and let things be
1339157682696179712 2020-12-16 18:37:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas I am not certain - this is what I think   Why are you so determined to keep going - is it hatred - what is your problem?
1339157018440044544 2020-12-16 18:34:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PrisonPlanet @BiffaBow Not quite sure that is what it is saying
1339156621235286016 2020-12-16 18:33:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas I have every reason to dispute it - I explained why I did so  These are not facts - these are interpretations of the law - you (and others) interpret them one way - I another  But you can not accept that someone can have a different view - It might help if you thought about why
1339154437093384192 2020-12-16 18:24:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @deerfold @Mephistophilles sorry - you have totally lost me
1339154353630875648 2020-12-16 18:24:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas you are right - I am not an expert  I am a human being - I am entitled to an opinion - as are you  Luckily this is not just reserved for experts - because it is unlikely we would ever have any again if it was
1339153964219166721 2020-12-16 18:22:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @deerfold @Mephistophilles says a man disagreeing with me
1339153082454781953 2020-12-16 18:19:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RightToOffend @maseratilady1 as far as I know they are all here - but I would not swear to it
1339152908454141953 2020-12-16 18:18:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas the law is not fact - it is not infallible - it can be abused  the only way to ensure laws are used proportionally and fairly is if they are challenged - and if they can not be challenged - then you have real problems - because that is tyranny
1339152386032607232 2020-12-16 18:16:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas No   I am disputing the interpretation of how the law was applied to Tommy and I am doubting it was done fairly - I am saying he was targeted because of who he was and because they did not want these cases discussed
1339151842870222849 2020-12-16 18:14:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RightToOffend @maseratilady1 he's still in the UK (as far as I know)
1339151536878915586 2020-12-16 18:13:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas why can you not accept that some people disagree with you?  are you always right - about everything?
1339151147597242368 2020-12-16 18:11:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lauren_Beleaver agreed - nothing
1339150902951862276 2020-12-16 18:10:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas &lt;&lt;they (courts, Govt, media, Police) did all they could to shut Tommy down and discredit him - they falsely applied the law to put him away - then manipulated it to ensure he stayed in jail
1339150572302307328 2020-12-16 18:09:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas &lt;&lt;The govt (Police etc) were still concerned about possible racial tensions and accusations of racism and wanted to try and keep these cases out of the media - Tommy (and others) reported on them&gt;&gt;
1339150247390482432 2020-12-16 18:07:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas &lt;&lt;Tommy Robinson (and others) spoke out about this - forcing us to take a look and deal with what was happening - this resulted in charges being brought and court cases - which were proving that white girls were being targeted&gt;&gt;
1339149933627240448 2020-12-16 18:06:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas here is what I think - the Government - Police etc are concerned that discussing (openly) cases involving the gang rape of white girls may cause racial tensions to develop (grow) - so they ignored them - they were also afraid of being called racists&gt;&gt;
1339149482206834690 2020-12-16 18:04:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas we are on opposite sides of this Jez - I do not have to agree with you - and you do not have to agree with me
1339148671687008256 2020-12-16 18:01:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas I understand the argument - I just disagree with it  The law is not always applied correctly - and the law is not always correct
1339147574180261890 2020-12-16 17:57:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Happytoberight no - what is happening?
1339147102534950915 2020-12-16 17:55:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @PKXDC1 @BighighBBJay No it was not clear - you said within limits and then swerved saying what those limits were - but hinted that violence would follow with your hornets nest analogy   You are a fraud
1339145931971768320 2020-12-16 17:50:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas I like to think I am open to persuasion - I suspect you will not be able to do so - but I am prepared to listen - I would hope you would do like wise
1339145400893239300 2020-12-16 17:48:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @terribly_nice @thereselite wrong - as a society we do not ignore this  Any one person can not  fight all the battles - but we must all ensure that all battles against evil are fought
1339144939096207360 2020-12-16 17:46:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke Sounds like I'm a right turnip - if I was you - I wouldn't bother
1339144599370166273 2020-12-16 17:45:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @alicoppelrose @Doctor_Thomas It's impossible to have a sensible discussion with these people - they will never accept that someone can have a different opinion to them - or that they may be wrong
1339143700350459907 2020-12-16 17:41:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke Hi Jez - I can not remember that particular discussion - but I suspect it is safe to say it was unlikely that we agreed
1339142401131245569 2020-12-16 17:36:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @PKXDC1 @BighighBBJay You are rolling your eyes because you are trying to find a way of saying two contradictory things at the same time  So you seek to deflect from this line of discussion - because you know your duplicity will be exposed - and islam will be shown for what it is
1339137027573493762 2020-12-16 17:15:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Bill_McCormic you do realise what you are saying means that it is impossible to speak out about this - because this accusation can be thrown (and is thrown) at anybody who does so
1339135500842635264 2020-12-16 17:09:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @PKXDC1 @BighighBBJay what limits?
1339135370869563399 2020-12-16 17:08:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JasonFarrellSky @docuterror @MaggieOliverUK why are (some of) these cases not treated as racist hate crimes - do white lives matter?
1339134063060377600 2020-12-16 17:03:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @PKXDC1 @BighighBBJay so you believe in freedom of speech and expression?
1339133927093637121 2020-12-16 17:03:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> Has anyone who has abused you (since the age of 14) been arrested? No   https://t.co/HJTkHOqyr9

1338978634569281538 2020-12-16 06:45:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @NeilSummers_ the problem is our fear of being called a racist that meant we were too afraid of doing so
1338978429002199045 2020-12-16 06:45:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CuttyDankz @derekklgr is anyone disputing this?
1338978294193152000 2020-12-16 06:44:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Mephistophilles @AntiFashWitch everyone who buys a lottery ticket very nearly becomes a millionaire  learn to fucking think
1338977564535234560 2020-12-16 06:41:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @NeilSummers_ he might be - but no one ever said it was racist to speak about it - or was too afraid of being called a racist so did not
1338977223735382018 2020-12-16 06:40:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Mephistophilles and yet you appear to be trying to stop me saying it
1338977068604854275 2020-12-16 06:39:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pepejansz hello there - congratulations

1338976506769498113 2020-12-16 06:37:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KellieCyorks @AntiFashWitch and yet to think saying white lives matter is racist  but falsely accusing police of race hate crime is not  or telling white girls to shut up about being gang raped is not  or being kicked in the head is not
1338975907361542149 2020-12-16 06:35:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KellieCyorks @AntiFashWitch your prize is an opportunity - look within yourself for the source of this anti white bigotry - we have been indoctrinated - you can free yourself from it if you are willing to think openly
1338975349888135168 2020-12-16 06:32:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe @BertTatlock Goodbye Seb

1338972706893656064 2020-12-16 06:22:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CuttyDankz @derekklgr what fact are you talking about
1338972464504823809 2020-12-16 06:21:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Darksparks1 @Bryan527Bryan what colour are most abusers in Pakistan - how many white ones?
1338972267431256065 2020-12-16 06:20:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe @KilnerAshley @c3lt1c1888 @19KD83 @FreddieHodkin Like I said it is a view I do not share  You can keep telling me I am wrong - but I will continue to disagree with you Seb
1338972069283983363 2020-12-16 06:19:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe @c3lt1c1888 @KilnerAshley @19KD83 @FreddieHodkin No one has ever said that - ever  That is in your own head and speaks of the problem that is the cause of this - fear of being called racists
1338971687417769984 2020-12-16 06:18:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe @BertTatlock If you try thinking Seb - rather than just showing your moral outrage - you might find the inability to accept anything is more from you - than I
1338971410421649411 2020-12-16 06:17:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CuttyDankz @derekklgr facts - always interesting when someone says the word facts  whose facts are the facts we are talking about?
1338971116728147968 2020-12-16 06:16:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay Thanks Seb - I would take you advice - if it was a bit more constructive and had some substance in it - rather than just being abuse disguised as virtue
1338970623381544962 2020-12-16 06:14:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KellieCyorks @AntiFashWitch they do not need to tell us in person - they use far more subtle methods - like this for example  https://t.co/jEKLdWT3t3
1338970249211875328 2020-12-16 06:12:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe @AntiFashWitch he forced the Police, CPS, social services, media, and politicians to do something  they were too afraid of being called racists
1338969652697952260 2020-12-16 06:10:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe @AntiFashWitch Like I said - it is a view - one I do not share Seb
1338969496883752960 2020-12-16 06:09:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @noodlemaz is it not OK to be white then?
1338969337177190401 2020-12-16 06:09:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AutisticBut @AntiFashWitch errrrr - seems you might be  Such aggression
1338969121703202817 2020-12-16 06:08:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnGHart @AntiFashWitch No, You, Don't  You see what you want
1338968904882905095 2020-12-16 06:07:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SBrownloe it is a view
1338968842664599553 2020-12-16 06:07:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiFashWitch I think you'll find it was you who bothered me
1338968677211910145 2020-12-16 06:06:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MartinPatriquin sorry Martin - is it not OK to be white?
1338968258444206082 2020-12-16 06:04:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @martyj21 has anyone ever stopped anyone doing so?
1338968002075693058 2020-12-16 06:03:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiFashWitch hang on - it's not OK to be white?
1338967909926834176 2020-12-16 06:03:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiFashWitch so near - it never happened  everyone who buys a lottery ticket is nearly a millionaire
1338967642183524352 2020-12-16 06:02:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TheWholeTruth13 I think he is lucky - just another form of indoctrination these days, rather than a game of football
1338967039197786113 2020-12-16 05:59:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiFashWitch Self evidently no trial collapsed
1338966926144512001 2020-12-16 05:59:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiFashWitch These institutions were failing these girls - because of their fear of being called racists - which was why we got ourselves into this mess in the first place
1338966604550385665 2020-12-16 05:58:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiFashWitch it was more the case of the pressure he applied (through the EDL) to force the Police, media, CPS, social services, politicians that they must ensure this is dealt with properly
1338966243739627521 2020-12-16 05:56:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ClumsyMaster your contempt is showing Emrah
1338965809968926721 2020-12-16 05:55:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiFashWitch Hi Roanna - he did
1338965479348723713 2020-12-16 05:53:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Iamevents25 I disagree Ms Mensah - but we shall see
1338965126179905536 2020-12-16 05:52:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @khublaikhan @PKXDC1 @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay some will agree with you - others will see it in a different way  The problem for islam - is how does it ensure its followers think more like you - and less like the others?   and then persuade those who do not think like you - that they are wrong?
1338964775997468674 2020-12-16 05:50:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AcidGrandads its the brown ones we are afraid of talking about - in case they call us racists
1338963877426581505 2020-12-16 05:47:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay Marc - I am not expert - I am learning as I go along  One thing I have learnt though - is try thinking for myself
1338963610811428865 2020-12-16 05:46:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Iamevents25 I think you will find - in time - that public opinion of him will shift - because he has been falsely portrayed
1338963192660291593 2020-12-16 05:44:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @emmelinemapp Obviously not everyone likes it
1338962551938445316 2020-12-16 05:42:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @martyj21 the question is loaded - more of a trap than a question
1338962307259502595 2020-12-16 05:41:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @arrrgggghhhhhh Hi Victoria - he was not driven by hatred of race or religion - he was motivated by what he was witnessing happening all around him
1338961935715479560 2020-12-16 05:39:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @steusmotus Obviously when I hear something like this it is very worrying - I would be very interested in hearing what they had to say and speak to them about it
1338961346730336257 2020-12-16 05:37:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @martyj21 did anyone ever call anyone a racist for doing so?
1338961081100800001 2020-12-16 05:36:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Iamevents25 I am not sure he has failed - in fact I would suggest he has not
1338955022684581888 2020-12-16 05:12:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarcCarran @moreinfomate @BighighBBJay there is a lot of evidence out there Marc - where do you want to start?   https://t.co/EfxCYYMM8l
1338954372345192450 2020-12-16 05:09:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ArthurCarling and they are trying very hard to do so
1338954244032966656 2020-12-16 05:09:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lanzabear27 @nick19680 I aint no Wordsworth for sure - so I wouldn't bet on it
1338954107596533767 2020-12-16 05:08:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smk49688625 @jackydeeofficia @Doctor_Thomas yes - deal  Please feel free to begin to explain to me why you are right and I am wrong - but please do not be upset if I try the same
1338953343624941569 2020-12-16 05:05:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BertTatlock agreed - and it seems the report is written with the intention of deflecting attention away from the ethnic groups involved
1338952965638529025 2020-12-16 05:03:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Ahmedsattar192 and no one ever cries racist when white abusers are brought to justice   and no one was ever so afraid of being called a racist they allowed a white abuser to continue abusing
1338952666928590849 2020-12-16 05:02:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Ahmedsattar192 most abusers are black in Nigeria
1338952488288923650 2020-12-16 05:02:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jaco45er so - we did not ignore gang rape of children because we were / are afraid of being called racists?
1338951420276596741 2020-12-16 04:57:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @segovius Is anyone advocating anything like that?
1338951072463933441 2020-12-16 04:56:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @gelzieboy agreed
1338950952372621313 2020-12-16 04:55:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @c3lt1c1888 @KilnerAshley @19KD83 @FreddieHodkin No one is stopping anyone from talking about white grooming gangs etc
1338950817143992320 2020-12-16 04:55:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KilnerAshley @c3lt1c1888 @19KD83 @FreddieHodkin thanks Ashley - they play the man and not the ball - it's an old tactic - very effective
1338950473634766849 2020-12-16 04:54:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @segovius Hi Tarquin - he did not get it wrong
1338950229547225091 2020-12-16 04:53:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CoskShir @jrschlosberg @Shambles151 agreed - but some of the girls did come from nice middle class homes
1338926066531000320 2020-12-16 03:17:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SmoggyPower feel better?
1338925552980422660 2020-12-16 03:15:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarxistMixed it's difficult - finely balanced
1338925218400768000 2020-12-16 03:13:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @flan010959 I can not speak for him - he can speak for himself   https://t.co/m2v1XQv06K
1338924873385717761 2020-12-16 03:12:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Spider_Ric0 what is the overall problem
1338924644431179779 2020-12-16 03:11:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @phlard do you have a link?
1338924479754498061 2020-12-16 03:10:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MarxistMixed not word for word - my sense was they wanted to do all they could to deflect attention from the ethnic groups involved
1338923851955265536 2020-12-16 03:08:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AniqaQazi depends what the one good thing was - what if he saved a child from being abused - or tortured - or murdered?
1338923361351643136 2020-12-16 03:06:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @milliken86 are we not allowed to talk about crime if we do not belong to the ethnic group committing it?
1338922916847738880 2020-12-16 03:04:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @randle304 we all know abusers come in all walks of life  we must not be afraid to speak out when they are seen
1338922423283052549 2020-12-16 03:02:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FeedMeWarpstone any abuser - whoever they are should be held to account - and we (as a society) should ensure this happens   No one person can do it alone - we all have a part to play  I would encourage anyone to speak out about any act of evil they see
1338921783618105347 2020-12-16 03:00:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @StephenMTJones @WildFireUltra I accept there were others - but for some reason (force of personality?) Tommy was able to break it into mainstream
1338921223661694980 2020-12-16 02:57:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ZohaibAhmedC @Unsteadyeddy If we agree that what was happening is evil - why does it matter who speaks out about it?
1338920603244441600 2020-12-16 02:55:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @the__don_ Not the Dude man
1338920411506085889 2020-12-16 02:54:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @timaustin2k Hi Tim - when trying to persuade people they are wrong about something - being abusive is a very poor tactic
1338920032403943426 2020-12-16 02:53:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Barrett_BearFA hmmmmmm   https://t.co/FTdpWsQfcy
1338919740165795841 2020-12-16 02:51:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @thereselite @terribly_nice I never made any such proclamation   But I think abuse should be dealt with and not ignored
1338919312422297602 2020-12-16 02:50:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ZohaibAhmedC @Unsteadyeddy Please do not tell people what wrongs to call out  take the opportunity to call out the ones you see
1338918966102724613 2020-12-16 02:48:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @flan010959 agreed - did anyone ever call anyone who spoke out abuse within the church a racist?
1338918589986959360 2020-12-16 02:47:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BighighBBJay if you want to talk about any abuse - please feel free
1338918475880951811 2020-12-16 02:46:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cwtchcaerdydd hang on - being concerned about anti white hatred, prejudice and bigotry is racist?
1338918256275546112 2020-12-16 02:46:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TwitDinosaur @PalBint are most abusers in Nigeria black?
1338918113686016005 2020-12-16 02:45:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @theroyalfactor errrr - which seems to be what you are doing?

1338917047217090560 2020-12-16 02:41:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Xtrapromo please feel free to tell me why - calling people names is rarely a good way of convincing they are wrong
1338916703342825477 2020-12-16 02:39:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cwtchcaerdydd wrong - I am very concerned about anti white hatred, prejudice and bigotry that has become accepted within our society / culture  I aim to speak out about it
1338916339357011969 2020-12-16 02:38:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Mike63345069 what should the Native Americans have done?

1338915016993615880 2020-12-16 02:33:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jonellacottCPFC I tried Jon - I hope we could rise above the insults, smears and accusations   But it obviously suits you to keep this discussion at that level  You are wrong
1338914619373588483 2020-12-16 02:31:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jameldrum @VishalKotecha @ridderz69 all behaviour is motivated by self
1338914442080346114 2020-12-16 02:30:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cwtchcaerdydd calling people racists is what allowed this to happen in the first place - grow up
1338914063745773570 2020-12-16 02:29:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @owenufc_ I agree - I do focus on anti white hatred  Because it being allowed to fester, grow and go unchecked  why - because people are paralysed with fear of being called racists
1338913745767178242 2020-12-16 02:28:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jonellacottCPFC He has done a service to the public he is not a racist  calling people racists is the cancer that has enabled this to happen - stop it - and let's have a grown up, frank and honest discussion
1338913231469993986 2020-12-16 02:26:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FreddieHodkin yes - are most child abusers in Nigeria white?

1338912708498837504 2020-12-16 02:24:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jonellacottCPFC report after report has stated that fear of being called a racist allowed grooming gangs to go unpunished   https://t.co/sgwchTa3Se
1338912395499024385 2020-12-16 02:22:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jonellacottCPFC this fear of being called a racist is allowing evil to grow - pretending it does not exist is contributing to it   https://t.co/Y1rffzANw5

1338910918462287875 2020-12-16 02:16:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PhilBloomfield3 It seems we disagree Phil
1338910616564674560 2020-12-16 02:15:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jonellacottCPFC Jon - our Police, social services, media, CPS, politicians were (are) all too scared of discussing it that is was allowed to happen for years  No one was ever afraid of being called a racist when arresting a white man
1338909990938157062 2020-12-16 02:13:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Joe90kerrByrd tell the truth about islam
1338909678198284288 2020-12-16 02:11:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GaryMurdoch75 Yes he was
1338909551526088711 2020-12-16 02:11:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @llywelyn_cymru wrong - we (as a society) do not ignore white grooming gangs - we (as a society) did ignore the non white one, because we are terrified of being called racists  which is something you are doing
1338909085052399616 2020-12-16 02:09:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WildFireUltra he really did
1338909013149249536 2020-12-16 02:09:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McGeorgeOfTheJ1 @Unsteadyeddy it did not happen - because he had not jeopardized the case

1338907107731656705 2020-12-16 02:01:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Unsteadyeddy and yet he spoke out
1338907035639877633 2020-12-16 02:01:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @derekklgr agreed - gang raped, abused, tortured, harassed, threatened - some made to abort their babies - some murdered  the scale of evil is beyond belief
1338906698266927112 2020-12-16 02:00:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LisaSmi38025729 People often say this about him - and what I is this  if we (as a society) were discussing this openly he would not have to
1338906370700161030 2020-12-16 01:58:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nikidoog why - because no one ever said they were too afraid of arresting them in case they were called racists
1338906205775917056 2020-12-16 01:58:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PLANET_ZOMBIE @KipMasterFunk not arguing - discussing   feel free

1338903287844777986 2020-12-16 01:46:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> People can say whatever they want about Tommy Robinson - but he did as much as anyone to bring the problem of grooming gangs to national attention  HE STOOD UP - WHEN OTHERS TURNED AWAY  he should be appreciated for his efforts - and I hope one day he will be  Tommy Robinson  https://t.co/FrBFt4oRw4

1338889477033512963 2020-12-16 00:51:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> so - when Europeans colonised other countries that was wrong  But when Europe gets colonised that's right  since when did 2 wrongs make a right is it when it means no more white?

1338867563715936258 2020-12-15 23:24:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BasedDan2 agreed - and that has been a major reason why they have been able to do so  falsely portraying us as racists or fascists etc  it was a lie - and now the lie is unravelling
1338866527815127041 2020-12-15 23:20:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> is it far right to say 'IT'S OK TO BE WHITE' and 'ALL LIVES MATTER'?  is it really?

1338425129274105858 2020-12-14 18:06:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ShortfuseLiz @AmyMek &lt;&lt;what they did not anticipate (because they are afraid of being called racists) is that muslims might quite like islam (or are so afraid of it they have to be) - and that islam relies on terrorism and fear to keep and grow its support&gt;&gt;

1338059196764401666 2020-12-13 17:52:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> There are jobs, and training opportunities that white people are excluded from - and people are encouraged to avoid shops owned by white people  IF WE DO NOT STAND UP FOR OURSELVES - WHO WILL?
1338058906225020928 2020-12-13 17:51:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> So why do I say it - our society is seriously drifting into allowing anti white prejudice to take over - we have seen the grooming gangs, the portrayal of Brexit and many other examples of attacks against white people get ignored
1338058520139358208 2020-12-13 17:49:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> To demonstrate what I am talking about - there will be a very large number of people who will see me saying 'IT IS OK TO BE WHITE' and immediately think I am a racist for saying it  HOW CAN THIS BE RACIST??  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE - THIS IS A MENTAL DISORDER
1338057990474248193 2020-12-13 17:47:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> Our society is being continually indoctrinated with anti white bigotry, hatred and prejudice  The most common form of which is the smearing that we are racists  it is a lie  we are decent, considerate, caring, fair minded people  STOP THE ANTI WHITE INDOCTRINATION  https://t.co/dH0HGUqSkf

1337466180383236100 2020-12-12 02:36:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @steveoreilly514 Not sure - but I do get the distinct impression things are going to get worse
1337464958947381249 2020-12-12 02:31:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @steveoreilly514  https://t.co/tIoRJgkmkr
1337463959193088008 2020-12-12 02:27:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> why
1337460564260495364 2020-12-12 02:13:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @AngryHousewife7 @MerseyPolice  https://t.co/newEyrgCcn
1337448765201002496 2020-12-12 01:26:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FreedomRadioGB Thus it was in the beginning: the Apaches and their homes each created for the other by God himself. When they are taken from these homes they sicken and die. How long will it be until it is said, there are no Apaches?  How long before it is said - there are no English?
1337447833025339392 2020-12-12 01:23:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels totally agree - is it racist to cleanse white people from London?  If so - should that be stopped?

1337377215986724867 2020-12-11 20:42:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels Hi LGS - we touched on ethnic cleansing the other day - care to delve deeper - explore what is happening and why?  I've got to go to work - so will catch up later and over the next few days if you fancy another bash
1337376651601174530 2020-12-11 20:40:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 We need allies my friend
1337376288802287619 2020-12-11 20:38:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Londontrader11 @nastymutant agreed - we must find ways of exposing what they are doing, the consequences of it (ethnic cleansing whites) and how to reverse it
1337375761133686785 2020-12-11 20:36:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @InnocentUntilP2 @danagould @UKMarkTyrrell You obviously did not read my tweet - it is not about what he is saying - it is about the words he uses to say it
1337170424032063488 2020-12-11 07:00:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 But l think it would be more constructive to build ourselves up and I think he does this  Just my personal opinion
1337169754562457601 2020-12-11 06:58:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 clearly he is not to everyone's liking - who is
1337169501792727041 2020-12-11 06:57:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah I guess we shall have to agree to disagree
1337167870053281795 2020-12-11 06:50:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah He is encouraging people to think and giving them tools to help develop themselves  He is opening minds - questioning the narrative - opening doors  the question is - once those doors are open - will be there to greet people and let them in - or will someone else
1337166900363714562 2020-12-11 06:46:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah Its not the falling - its what a person does to get back up that I think is of value
1337166472251142145 2020-12-11 06:45:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah A good leader will recognise the needs of the individual and be able to knit them together to help the community as a whole  I agree our society has been too obsessed with the individual for too long
1337165994238865408 2020-12-11 06:43:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah I agree - we do need to unite - that is a different story  I do not agree that Dr Peterson is preventing this from happening - I would say he is making it more possible
1337165431346507777 2020-12-11 06:40:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah I think his main benefit is he provides us with an opportunity to learn about ourselves - to reflect about who we are and where do we want to go - and then offers some tips on how to get there
1337163406265159682 2020-12-11 06:32:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah Jordan Peterson is one of the few who is actually trying to make a positive difference - to lift us up - when so many push us down
1337163150240735233 2020-12-11 06:31:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lemondeselon1 @ClarkeMicah finding our place in the world - understanding who we are - helping / encouraging us to improve and develop  This world is full of people in the media - including politicians who are very good at attacking (white / working class) men
1337159965052727299 2020-12-11 06:19:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DAaronovitch it is the attitude of our social, cultural and political elite (like you) that is has been so dismissive of white working class that and negatively portraying them as racists that has contributed to the mess we are in
1337158534568488972 2020-12-11 06:13:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DAaronovitch do you remember when you tried to label a question time attendant and belittled a homeless man in 2014 - implying he was a racist  Maybe if you listened to him - to us   https://t.co/9ydpMFGQsr
1337157027597078529 2020-12-11 06:07:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ClarkeMicah It's a shame that you are so disparaging to those who pay attention to the words of Dr Peterson - he has helped many people - and it would be more helpful if you tried to understand and assist - as opposed to make snide comments
1337156301059710983 2020-12-11 06:04:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SoupyTwists agreed - they would rather cut their nose off to spite their face - then act in all our mutual interests and get a good deal for both sides  and you can not get a good deal - if both sides do not want one
1337154967321382922 2020-12-11 05:59:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> It seems to me the problem with the Brexit negotiations are because the EU do not want us to make a success of it  They are terrified that once other countries see they are better off alone than in their gang - they will leave
1337153849610657792 2020-12-11 05:54:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> Santifa stove top stuffing  Brilliant
1337148729011351559 2020-12-11 05:34:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> the names make interesting reading Mr Brennan - what concerns me - along with the number of similar cases - is why are we not prosecuting these men with race / hate offences?
1337138966412324865 2020-12-11 04:55:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @alg_writer @nastymutant I agree about Brexit being an opportunity to take a big step in the right direction  what is phase 3?
1337138348494884864 2020-12-11 04:53:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @procyor very
1337125543091855363 2020-12-11 04:02:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DeoSperavi agreed - currently we have to accept it - or risk the backlash - cries of racist - possible dismissal from work etc etc  But hopefully we can turn this boat around
1337124980522442754 2020-12-11 04:00:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @alg_writer @nastymutant It is moving in the right direction - but the demographic changes may (will?) force it back   I am less convinced - but remain hopeful
1337124163333615620 2020-12-11 03:56:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @alg_writer @nastymutant if there are enough of us seeking it my friend - it will be found

1337098823836033032 2020-12-11 02:16:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nastymutant they are dehumanising us - we are now viewed as racists first and people second - even dehumanising language is in common usage - gammon, supremacists, racists, nazi, etc - and our role in the creation of our own society and culture is now being erased - as are our people

1337042997096161283 2020-12-10 22:34:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GaiusCa1igu1a @MailOnline agreed - but I do think the only way to get ourselves out of it is by applying the same collective will that got us in it
1337041919025831936 2020-12-10 22:30:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GaiusCa1igu1a @MailOnline terrifying - what have we done to our country? - why did we do it?

1337028258714542083 2020-12-10 21:35:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mark_knight23 Deflection - they will do anything - say anything to avoid discussing what is happening in front of them - in case it challenges their world view - which is that white people are racists and all others are victims of white racism

1336360635257540610 2020-12-09 01:22:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @finnyofthenorth @KeyserSosse it seems to me we just say people are mentally unwell - and then accept that they have no choice but to kill - if a compulsion was that irresistible - would you be able to wait until a 7 year old child appeared in front of you - aged 30
1336359996284657669 2020-12-09 01:20:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @finnyofthenorth @KeyserSosse it seems to me that it is entirely reasonable to believe that a person can be mentally unwell - but still commit an act like this knowing full well that it is wrong - and be able to stop themselves

1336255950227955716 2020-12-08 18:26:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @spikedonline if you report about grooming gangs - you're a racist if you vote Brexit - you're a racist if you concerned about anti white hatred - you're a racist  the constant calling white people racists is dehumanizing and has legitimised grievance and encouraged bigotry

1335552632379887616 2020-12-06 19:52:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @meHaydenWright I am talking about a society / culture that is infected with calling white people racists
1335552431065878529 2020-12-06 19:51:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @meHaydenWright I am not talking about race - I am talking about fear that we will be called / or perceived as racists if we discuss these things - such as immigration - mental health etc etc
1335539616863150080 2020-12-06 19:00:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @meHaydenWright if you think I am sowing hate - tell me - who am I sowing hate against?  We must be able to discuss these cases without people like you yelling racist or hater very single time - same with grooming  gangs etc
1335537126616817664 2020-12-06 18:50:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @meHaydenWright so no conspiracy then?  Her Father has asked people to think about what happened so we can try to protect it from happening again?  https://t.co/N0oeSm6aQs

1335531301525467140 2020-12-06 18:27:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Ben_Stephenson &lt;&lt;and how this has impacted upon us as a society / culture
1335531093030821888 2020-12-06 18:26:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Ben_Stephenson agreed - they are not very good terms to describe what has / is happening - however - what does concern me is the constant portrayal of white people as racists - and the fear that we are going to be labelled so our decision making is negatively impacted &gt;&gt;
1335527851823599618 2020-12-06 18:13:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BarristerSecret @JamesLadbroke @KirstenFleetwo1 Got a question about subsection 1A - exercise self control?  It seems to me ES had walked past, encountered many many children through her life - she had not killed any of them - was she exercising self control then?
1335525343344664576 2020-12-06 18:03:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @melindiscott @Ben_Stephenson apologies - came to UK via Germany - after spending 2 years in Kuwait (having got married)
1335524563246047235 2020-12-06 18:00:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @finnyofthenorth @Ben_Stephenson I just hope he is prepared to listen to legitimate concerns with an open mind
1335524142414753792 2020-12-06 17:59:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @melindiscott @Ben_Stephenson &lt;and in July 2015 she was sectioned for threatening her neighbour with a knife - I think it is reasonable to think that this level of psychosis would have existed before she got to UK - and it makes me more concerned about why this was allowed to happen
1335523708765691907 2020-12-06 17:57:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @melindiscott @Ben_Stephenson The article you shared - illustrates decent minded people are concerned about this case - she arrived illegally into UK - via Italy (where she spent 6 years apparently) and France - from Albania - within 3 months of arrival in UK she was referred to MH services&gt;&gt;
1335520805095092224 2020-12-06 17:45:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @melindiscott @Ben_Stephenson her Father has expressed his concerns about this   https://t.co/N0oeSm6aQs

1335517388436086784 2020-12-06 17:32:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @polyglotgardner @hippymid It is a difficult term - which I think only goes part of the way to describe what has happened and why - it is a shame I think that there is not something that does a better job  but that is part of the problem - how can we cure if we can not diagnose
1335516945328824320 2020-12-06 17:30:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TreatyNow I agree - it is right that we learn and acknowledge our part in atrocities   It is not right that we allow atrocities to be committed against us because of our fear of being called racists
1335516575630303232 2020-12-06 17:28:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Ben_Stephenson Did we ignore grooming gangs because of fear of being called racists? What happened in the Aaron Dugmore case?  why are attacks upon white people not treated as race / hate crimes?  is that nonsense?

1335316061193986048 2020-12-06 04:12:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BesfordPhil to put it simply - I am concerned that white people are being made into scapegoats and being dehumanized by constant portrayal of us as racists - this is legitimising grievance against us - and fuelling anti white bigotry / hatred
1335315574537261058 2020-12-06 04:10:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> White saviour?

1335313918697345025 2020-12-06 04:03:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BesfordPhil are you spending a lot of time telling me I am obsessed?
1335313703189815297 2020-12-06 04:02:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BesfordPhil yes - I do not think I am saying any of those things - about her nationality, and I am not denying her mental health condition   what am I saying that has upset you?
1335312777217531906 2020-12-06 03:59:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @watterheed @CCEldr what are the facts?
1335281082166546434 2020-12-06 01:53:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SoupyTwists I think I wet myself a little bit
1335280023213895680 2020-12-06 01:49:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> He has a wife you know you know what she's called? she's called......... Incontinentia. Incontinentia Buttocks   https://t.co/URBP9a6Dzv
1335270994601242625 2020-12-06 01:13:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Cha999brad a great cause - best of luck
1335263200200302592 2020-12-06 00:42:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BesfordPhil obsession?  Is saying it is OK to be white an obsession
1335262766937100288 2020-12-06 00:40:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BesfordPhil what is my conspiracy theory?
1335224758674333697 2020-12-05 22:09:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @emiroseli I think we should start by pointing out the failure and try to remedy that
1335224352804134912 2020-12-05 22:07:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BesfordPhil all just fun and games
1335215199293501440 2020-12-05 21:31:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK It makes discussion impossible if after every thing I say  -I have to say - but not all - etc etc  this is you trying to manipulate the discussion to avoid actually addressing the issues
1335214938730737666 2020-12-05 21:30:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK I am questioning what has happened - I think it is self evident that not all pakistani men are rapists - I do not understand why people can not recognise the difference between having legitimate concerns about what is happening and tarring all people of a group the same
1335214325091479554 2020-12-05 21:27:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK see - that is your default position  It is your bigotry on show - not mine
1335213679718129664 2020-12-05 21:25:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave Jesus and mohammad   How many people did Jesus kill?
1335213456048279555 2020-12-05 21:24:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK is anyone stopping you talking about priests and royalty  Interestingly - when I did tweet about Prince Andrew no one tried to deflect or call me names - anti royalty for example
1335213110387470341 2020-12-05 21:23:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK I think they might be getting that impression
1335212914224095232 2020-12-05 21:22:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky How are they vulnerable then - walking in the street, going to McDonalds or the kebab shop - dressing in clothing?  how are they vulnerable to gang rape, abuse, torture and murder?
1335212555984375809 2020-12-05 21:20:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK I agree about SA  I am not sure islam is peaceful - communism is peace once it has killed all those who oppose it - as is fascism   you do what I say or I'll cut your head off is quite a big incentive to do what someone says
1335212081910587400 2020-12-05 21:19:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK Yes - how do I think Pakistani men feel - they probably think they have come to the land of honey - they can more or less do anything they want and people will call those who speak out racists - madness
1335211724140646405 2020-12-05 21:17:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky are you blaming the girls?
1335207941037809665 2020-12-05 21:02:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky OK - you say not murder  If a husband abuses his wife for years and years ad she commits suicide - would you think he drove her to it  would you think he had a part to play in it  would you think that was murder - or maybe we should at least investigate it?
1335207448727187459 2020-12-05 21:00:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky again - it is how white girls are perceived that needs investigating
1335207285308743682 2020-12-05 20:59:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky In many of these cases - if not all - the girls were called white slags, white trash etc  It seems fair to say that there is a good evidence this is a general view
1335206912535752707 2020-12-05 20:58:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky did those that bully him - murder him?   https://t.co/L8IaioAIzV
1335205037245665283 2020-12-05 20:51:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky agreed - let's look at the evidence
1335204001718087681 2020-12-05 20:46:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky and we (as a society) have to find a way of talking about these cases without the constant accusations of racism
1335203776077193218 2020-12-05 20:46:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky I do not share that belief - I think this is something we need to talk about  For example - would you say Stephen Lawrence (etc) was not killed because of his colour?
1335202253452562433 2020-12-05 20:39:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky I would like to know - and maybe you can tell me - how I can talk about this case in such a way as to not be xenophobic (in your opinion)
1335200342477303814 2020-12-05 20:32:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky agreed - but what I am is very concerned that fear of being called a racist is being used to exploit us from properly examining the causes of these deaths and trying to ensure they are not repeated  Goodbye
1335195628943667205 2020-12-05 20:13:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mickduffy1 agreed - there are legitimate methods of entry - everyone else is here illegally
1335195446080376832 2020-12-05 20:12:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK Khairi Saadallah who stabbed 3 men to death is from Libya   https://t.co/2Kqm7xDbMt
1335194755089788929 2020-12-05 20:10:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK I am not an advocate of the death penalty - never have been  Anyone immigrant who breaks the law should be deported - it would solve many things - at least ensure we are protected from them
1335194343515287552 2020-12-05 20:08:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK Hang on - are you really saying poverty is a legitimate excuse for gang raping, torture, abuse and murder of a child?
1335193788411686916 2020-12-05 20:06:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LostPatriot2020 @mickduffy1 @MegGreen63 I think there are many people talking about this case - I am no worse or better than any of them   And I think you fall into that category - no worse of better
1335193469648826369 2020-12-05 20:05:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK Manchester bomber was not home grown 1 of the 7/7 bombers was not home grown  and what about islam - what role does islam play in these attacks?
1335192715735281665 2020-12-05 20:02:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LostPatriot2020 @mickduffy1 @MegGreen63 why - because our culture has been infected with an illness that has decided white people are racists - and this needs addressing
1335192052120875008 2020-12-05 19:59:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK totally wrong - our society has made enormous efforts to make people feel welcome into this country
1335180940553949184 2020-12-05 19:15:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK I just asked you how I can talk about these cases in such a way as to avoid upsetting you - and you have not told me  You said we can talk about them - we do  you are full of twaddle
1335180060672856065 2020-12-05 19:11:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK Great - please tell me how I can talk about these cases in such a way that will not upset you - I would like to learn
1335179653661806594 2020-12-05 19:10:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LostPatriot2020 @mickduffy1 @MegGreen63 Her image is widely used
1335179031197650949 2020-12-05 19:07:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK Yes - why do we have to shout?  Because people like you yell racist and everyone feels guilt and bad so stops talking about it  If you actually helped to ensure children were not abused we would not be shouting
1335178602418237440 2020-12-05 19:05:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LostPatriot2020 @mickduffy1 @MegGreen63 Her case is widely reported - it is not horrible to discuss this case - it the real horror is that it happened  So grow up, take you anger and place it where it belongs
1335178272863358976 2020-12-05 19:04:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DavidMi29140528 @ClarkeMicah @EnglishGoose agreed - I would imagine she is quite well known - especially if she suffered from mental ill health - which makes it more curious why do we know so little about her - feels like they do not want us to know
1335177716426022914 2020-12-05 19:02:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> &lt;&lt;it was reported she attacked her Mother in UK - I find it hard to believe that she developed that level of mental ill health in UK and that there she quite possibly has a history of similar occurrences  How can I find out - do you know anyone I could ask?
1335177166846390273 2020-12-05 19:00:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> &lt;&lt;what / if any - mental health issues did she have in Albania - was she receiving any treatment   She left for Italy - where she spent 6(?) years - before going to France and UK  again - what was her mental health condition there - any treatment &gt;&gt;
1335176749106262016 2020-12-05 18:58:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jay_Beecher @JamesDelingpole   Hi Gents - I am sure you have been following the Emily Jones case - It seems to me there is a conspicuous lack of information about Eltonia Skana   we know she is Albanian - apparently comes from  Fushe_Arrez - which has a population  of(2,513)   &gt;
1335175421500018688 2020-12-05 18:53:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CT129 agreed - it's like talking to children having tantrums because they can't get their own way - spoilt selfish brats
1335174483649376256 2020-12-05 18:49:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ClarkeMicah @EnglishGoose &lt;apparently she comes from Fushe_Arrez - which has a very small population (2,513)   she went to Italy where she stayed for 6 years (?) before going to France then UK  Is there anyone I could ask about this?
1335174145034907648 2020-12-05 18:48:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ClarkeMicah @EnglishGoose Hi Mr Hitchens - I am sure you have been following the Emily Jones case - why is so little reporting about Eltonia Skana before she came to UK?  what was her mental health condition before she got here&gt;
1335173574156574722 2020-12-05 18:46:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @toryboypierce @paulfish2skyco2 what was her mental health condition before she arrived in UK
1335173484805283840 2020-12-05 18:45:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @toryboypierce @paulfish2skyco2 &lt;&lt;apparently she left for Italy where she spent 6 years before moving to France and then UK  Her reported home town is Fushe_Arrez - which has a very small population (2,513)
1335172999075520516 2020-12-05 18:43:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @toryboypierce @paulfish2skyco2 Hi Andrew - you seem to be a man who is interested in finding the facts - why is there no information about Eltonia Skana before she came to UK  For example - did she suffer from mental health issues before she left Albania&gt;&gt;
1335172488163172352 2020-12-05 18:41:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Stuart15312270 @RobertS96308735 yes sir - I think we must change that
1335172386333859840 2020-12-05 18:41:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Stuart15312270 totally agreed - a horrendous case
1335172237851234304 2020-12-05 18:40:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @seanbrassil1 @JakeHepple1 and if anyone has a better way of describing this - I would be very grateful to hear and understand it
1335172083714813952 2020-12-05 18:40:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @seanbrassil1 @JakeHepple1 &lt;&lt;but what I am concerned about is how our culture has become addicted to accusing white people of racism and how this is now so prevalent that we are terrified of being called racists so we ignore grooming gangs and can not enforce our borders putting people at risk
1335171660706623488 2020-12-05 18:38:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @seanbrassil1 @JakeHepple1 I agree that cultural marxism is not a very good or helpful way of describing what is happening - to be honest I am not sure how to describe it properly - but it does help in encouraging thought and debate (as we are now doing)&gt;&gt;
1335170338443976708 2020-12-05 18:33:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @seanbrassil1 @JakeHepple1 Thanks Sean - if you don't mind I'll say what I want - and you can do the same
1335169653241491456 2020-12-05 18:30:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MartinDaubney Your first word is what we are really guilty of
1335168239215775744 2020-12-05 18:24:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CT129 agreed - I think we may be part of the solution - by speaking out about these things and encouraging others to think harder about what is happening  or at least - that is my aim
1335167084100284416 2020-12-05 18:20:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CT129 totally agreed - we have been infected with an illness - where white people are portrayed as racists and all other ethnic groups are victims of white racism
1335163825797165058 2020-12-05 18:07:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 and if you really wanted to help - you would be willing to have an adult discussion about our broken immigration system and what we could do to fix it - as well as the other problems like metal health services
1335163508690997249 2020-12-05 18:06:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 and for years people (like you) have been calling those who are concerned about our broken and abused immigration system racists etc - and this has stopped debate about it  It is you and people like you who are not helping
1335162530394730496 2020-12-05 18:02:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 Yes - and we should be doing all we can to both help those suffering and help protect people from attack  Allowing people into the country is putting us at risk - this is self evident
1335160608472305665 2020-12-05 17:54:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jocotterillbook @KirstenFleetwo1 @BarristerSecret that says more about you than I Jo
1335159933084594176 2020-12-05 17:51:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 we know the cause - it was Skana we know the reason - mental health issues (apparently)  we know what allowed it - immigration - and our fear of being called racists
1335159401888571392 2020-12-05 17:49:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jocotterillbook @KirstenFleetwo1 @BarristerSecret Grow up Jo - If you want to be verbally abusive and insulting - please find someone else  - if you want to discus this like adults then I am willing to do so
1335157996821880833 2020-12-05 17:44:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jocotterillbook @KirstenFleetwo1 @BarristerSecret No Jo - it's because for years I was told these attacks were random - and I believed it  But then I began to ask myself - if they are random - why are they so very similar  and I began to think about that very deeply
1335157700842414080 2020-12-05 17:42:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse Yes - I saw this when you posted it before - very interesting  And why is all this information being ignored or not followed up or not reported on - by either the UK or Albanian media   It feels like they do not want to look in case they find something
1335157081486274560 2020-12-05 17:40:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 No one is denying that mental health services are under funded  The real issue is the immigration policy - and how easy it is to manipulate it and just call people racists to get what you want
1335156756280991744 2020-12-05 17:39:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse If that is her Father - does it suggest he may have possible mental health issues - or at least a very nasty temper - and if she grew up in that environment - what impact would that have on her?
1335156280412037126 2020-12-05 17:37:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse Interesting - so she got married and left Albania for Kuwait - was her husband a citizen?  Then did she return to Albania - and then leave for Italy and France before entering UK?  surprisingly little information on the Albanian websites I looked at
1335155743595655168 2020-12-05 17:35:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RobertS96308735 agreed - it is a complete mess
1335155055104843776 2020-12-05 17:32:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 her application was refused - she was not deported  Albanian news reports she was an immigrant in Agil (which I think is Italy) for 6 years
1335153457448235008 2020-12-05 17:26:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 these are not sound bites - they are legitimate questions and concerns - grow up
1335152824305528832 2020-12-05 17:23:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jocotterillbook @KirstenFleetwo1 @BarristerSecret yes - random attacks  For random attacks - they do look suspiciously similar to me
1335152619103416320 2020-12-05 17:22:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> It was reported she lived in Agli for several years as an immigrant - not sure where that is - but it seems it could be in Italy

1335151999449509889 2020-12-05 17:20:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> Hi @KeyserSosse   Thought I'd take a look at online Albanian papers see what they were reporting about Skana  Surprisingly little - I did learn she came from a place called Fushe_Arrez (apparantly)- which has a very small population (2,513) -I would think someone would know her
1335148690206502913 2020-12-05 17:07:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LostPatriot2020 @mickduffy1 @MegGreen63 Yes Rosie - no one came out to march for these white kids did they  - in fact - we are encouraged to not even talk about them
1335147997185839105 2020-12-05 17:04:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LostPatriot2020 @E78James Rosie - the case is widely reported
1335147854814453761 2020-12-05 17:03:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hairos88 agreed
1335147637767610376 2020-12-05 17:02:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RobertS96308735 agreed - something rotten has taken a grip of us - in simple terms I think it is the belief that white people are racists and that everyone is a victim of white racism
1335147230534234117 2020-12-05 17:01:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 &lt;&lt;she had severe mental health problems that meant she was a risk to others - why was she not deported - fear of being called a racist?  Emily Jones is murdered
1335146981317087234 2020-12-05 17:00:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @1happy_monkey @JakeHepple1 she entered the country illegally from Albania - via Italy and France - Albania is not at war - not in EU - why was she not deported - fear of being called racist?  Her application was rejected - why was she not deported - fear of being called racist?  &gt;&gt;
1335005732664709131 2020-12-05 07:39:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde Albania is not at war or an EU country - why was she not deported?
1335005629459689474 2020-12-05 07:38:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde she arrived illegally by lorry - why was she not deported she had her application for status turned down - why was she not deported she suffered severe mental health problems and was a risk to people - why was she not deported
1335004971855712257 2020-12-05 07:36:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK you are right - I do talk about English white children - because no one else does - because people are too afraid (of being called racist) for doing so  stop behaving like a child
1335004653780656129 2020-12-05 07:34:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @watterheed @CCEldr Good question - what is my idea of justice  For a start - we could tell the truth about this case - what was her mental health condition in Albania - why was she not deported when she arrived illegally - why was she not deported after her application was refused  start there
1335004169934172161 2020-12-05 07:32:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol @abz_The_Manc @JakeHepple1 still not telling the truth about islam
1335003835107057664 2020-12-05 07:31:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @PartyOatsUK she told!
1335003774633521157 2020-12-05 07:31:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @slightlyfrontal many thanks - please let me know what you think, any feedback is very helpful    https://t.co/jH7Tur0hFM
1335003252023308296 2020-12-05 07:29:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JosephMonahan @DJamesiemc @TGesches @Lizard609 @FlippaDipp @MegGreen63 I think you should speak for yourself sir - and allow them to do the same  No one wants to cause them any unnecessary pain, and the implication that we do is just wrong  May people are commenting / reporting on this case - you just want those you dont like to shut up
1335000757569990658 2020-12-05 07:19:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrankSt34499711 my first poem in Geronimo is written with the rivers of blood speech in mind - from the view point of Drucilla Cotterill whom wrote to him telling him what had happened to her
1334963751917850628 2020-12-05 04:52:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid No Middy - you are
1334963676286218240 2020-12-05 04:51:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid not anti immigrant - anti immigration  immigrant is the person immigration is the policy  it is you who conflates them - not me
1334963376410288129 2020-12-05 04:50:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid Some of the girls groomed were in the care of social services - they were too afraid of being called racists to help them  It was not money they needed - it was the confidence to do their job  you are eroding their confidence
1334962894883201024 2020-12-05 04:48:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @XBillHugginsX when your boat is letting in water - it might be a good idea to at least stop making holes first
1334962641681469443 2020-12-05 04:47:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid we know this - we talk about this   we do not talk about grooming gangs
1334962474722992128 2020-12-05 04:47:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid wow - did you read that before you sent it  It sounds like you are justifying anti white hatred and violence to me
1334961965597401091 2020-12-05 04:45:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid you are wrong - people talk about grooming gangs because we are ignoring them -  because people like you call them racists - you are proving my point for me
1334961668397338624 2020-12-05 04:43:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @thegreatgwave @PartyOatsUK people call for the death penalty for all child killers - grow up and stop looking for racists everywhere
1334961326289022979 2020-12-05 04:42:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jocotterillbook @KirstenFleetwo1 @BarristerSecret never does - the legal system needs to take a look at what is happening   https://t.co/U7YLL6LRhs
1334960813451452417 2020-12-05 04:40:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jocotterillbook @WingerUK this is about more than the law - this is about our immigration system - this is about our mental health services - this is about our attitude towards discussing these subjects
1334960513101557760 2020-12-05 04:39:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @idil_ix are you an expert on everything?  I think I'll speak about what I want - in the way I want - and learn what I want - how I want  and I think you can do the same  - goodbye
1334959933629100033 2020-12-05 04:37:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KirstenFleetwo1 @BarristerSecret as for why she attacked Emily - how many children walk past her - how many adults - what was it about Emily?  Nothing you say - it is very interesting and telling how many totally random attacks end up with the murder of a white child (or adult)  almost like something is going on
1334959429431783424 2020-12-05 04:35:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KirstenFleetwo1 @BarristerSecret she was smuggled into UK - not deported her application for status was refused - not deported she had serious mental health issues and was a risk - not deported
1334959096571768844 2020-12-05 04:33:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @tomst7 It is not a very good way of describing what has happened
1334958538179768320 2020-12-05 04:31:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @idil_ix Yes - but we were not afraid of being called racists - cultural marxism is not the best way of describing what has happened - I wish I knew more and could do a better job
1334957956912320512 2020-12-05 04:29:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @watterheed @CCEldr her original application was refused - she won on appeal  There is no justice
1334957623561621517 2020-12-05 04:27:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @watterheed @CCEldr she was smuggled into UK from Albania - a country not at war or in EU - why was she allowed to stay?   https://t.co/S4uOthZm5c
1334957402551095297 2020-12-05 04:27:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EwaMazierska many thanks - I read that she was smuggled in via Italy and France  https://t.co/S4uOthZm5c
1334956902611099652 2020-12-05 04:25:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid &gt;&gt;In fact it works so well - that people (like me) who speak out face constant accusations of racism etc  and this just increases the growing anti white hatred within our society
1334956604052168704 2020-12-05 04:23:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid &lt;&lt;what is of concern to me is the constant portrayal of white people as racists - and the fear that white people now have of being called or thought of as racists that we are incapable of talking about immigration, grooming gangs and growing anti white attacks, hatred etc&gt;&gt;
1334956220747231233 2020-12-05 04:22:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid Yes - I have come across this - to be honest I do not understand this argument - but also I do not think we have a very good way of describing what has happened to our society / culture&gt;&gt;
1334955747948564483 2020-12-05 04:20:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @watterheed @CCEldr What concerns me about this case is why was Skana here  she came here illegally - not deported she had her application turned down - not deported she has serious mental health issues - not deported
1334955437091942400 2020-12-05 04:19:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @tiling_co @CCEldr Personally speaking - I think successive governments have bent over backwards to helping immigrants settle  I have seen this with my own eyes - and been involved in part of the process
1334955019028885504 2020-12-05 04:17:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EwaMazierska &lt;&lt;who may have come across this case - or any ideas how it might be possible to find out (if she did have any treatment in Albania)
1334954746017361925 2020-12-05 04:16:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EwaMazierska Hi Ewa - you know the Emily Jones case - I was wondering if Skana had any mental health issues before she came to UK - it seems unlikely (considering her age and severity of them) that they developed here - do you have any contacts with people outside UK&gt;&gt;
1334953881651064834 2020-12-05 04:13:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @watterheed @CCEldr please feel free to enlighten me Mark
1334953660472827905 2020-12-05 04:12:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @tiling_co @CCEldr of talking about immigration, anti white hatred, grooming gangs and so on
1334953535046348803 2020-12-05 04:11:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @tiling_co @CCEldr Please forgive me - I am struggling to find an accurate way of describing what has happened  what I am trying to express is that our culture has become obsessed with portraying white people as racists and white people so afraid of being called that we are incapable
1334952645677682691 2020-12-05 04:08:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CateCoupal Yes  God bless Emily, Aaron, Lucy and Victoria and all the other children who have suffered as a result of he changes to our country  I hope we are able to learn lessons and help protect others
1334951138353930240 2020-12-05 04:02:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @PartyOatsUK I would be interested in seeing it - She is alleged to have attacked her mother - have no doubt that her mental health condition began in Albania probably in adolescents - I am fairly confident this will be revealed
1334950134023659520 2020-12-05 03:58:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @thegreatgwave @DickieB17 @PartyOatsUK Uk is so racist people want to come here and develop mental health problems resulting in them killing a child  what kind of insanity it this?
1334949176526909442 2020-12-05 03:54:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Trash36733988 and this has meant that we have not been able to have a proper grown up discussion about immigration and its impact
1334949024512794624 2020-12-05 03:53:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Trash36733988 I am struggling to find a good way of describing what has happened - to put it simply - our society / culture has become addicted to calling white people racists and terrified of being called racists
1334948606139379717 2020-12-05 03:52:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @PartyOatsUK you have no idea if she had mental health issues before she got here - personally speaking I think it very likely that she did have - and I also suspect this will come out
1334944358332850176 2020-12-05 03:35:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @oddball52254473 totally agreed
1334944040182276096 2020-12-05 03:33:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hippymid shame - it might have been more helpful (to me especially) if you explained why I am wrong
1334943450832248839 2020-12-05 03:31:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Darren1518 agreed - they are so obsessed with white people being racists they are terrified of speaking out about the appalling murder of a child
1334940274385154053 2020-12-05 03:18:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JoshuaTeya her case has been widely reported
1334940057367613441 2020-12-05 03:18:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cheekychipmunk5 and that is now a crime in UK
1334939953093079041 2020-12-05 03:17:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot don't be so stupid - that is not what I am saying at all  It's quite simple  we should ensure all people - who live here - receive the care and protection they need  all those who do not live here - and are a threat to us - or who are here illegally should be deported
1334938626824802304 2020-12-05 03:12:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SRSilvie indeed - and we are on the receiving end
1334937683471331329 2020-12-05 03:08:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot we can not deport people who live here
1334937366306435074 2020-12-05 03:07:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BarristerSecret why do we not know about her medical history in Albania?
1334937069274148864 2020-12-05 03:06:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CCEldr I do lack an adequate way of describing what is going on - if there are any better ways I would be grateful for any advice
1334936855305990152 2020-12-05 03:05:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cryptodaaz Aaron killed himself (aged 9) - he was bullied at school because he was white Lucy was raped, and her house set on fire Victoria was raped and injected with heroin
1334936556549906440 2020-12-05 03:04:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JosephMonahan @DJamesiemc @TGesches @Lizard609 @FlippaDipp @MegGreen63 why are cases reported?  so we learn?  why do we want to learn?  to stop them repeating?  some lessons are hard
1334936296431771649 2020-12-05 03:03:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot she arrived her via italy and france - illegally - she was not deported her application for status was refused - she was not deported  Emily has been killed - you work it out
1334935716095275010 2020-12-05 03:00:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JosephMonahan @DJamesiemc @TGesches @Lizard609 @FlippaDipp @MegGreen63 her case has been widely reported
1334935652044070916 2020-12-05 03:00:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dominicscumming her case is widely reported
1334935154591195137 2020-12-05 02:58:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite yes - there are many cases - and we can not cope properly with these  If your boat is sinking - it might be sensible to at least stop drilling holes
1334934407023616001 2020-12-05 02:55:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Rolo_Tamasi and now we will never know
1334934306725171200 2020-12-05 02:55:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot the case we are discussing is an example
1334934203058843648 2020-12-05 02:54:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot Good - so we agree it is OK to be white
1334933774765871110 2020-12-05 02:53:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Rolo_Tamasi Oh
1334933223693033473 2020-12-05 02:50:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot I'll ask again  is it OK to be white?
1334933079966756865 2020-12-05 02:50:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot No - I am fixated with what is happening to our country
1334932632073891840 2020-12-05 02:48:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot so it is OK to be white?
1334932381283852293 2020-12-05 02:47:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Rolo_Tamasi Not sure what the problem is Rolo - you seem to be upset about something
1334932066136363018 2020-12-05 02:46:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot is it not OK to be white then?
1334931659939045382 2020-12-05 02:44:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SunScot @AntiGobshite you might want to reflect upon the meaning of the word bigotry and get back to me
1334931387166699520 2020-12-05 02:43:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> is there anyone from Albania out there - who knows of this case - was Skana receiving treatment before she left and came to UK?
1334930921452146695 2020-12-05 02:41:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Rolo_Tamasi after the prosecution withdrew the murder charge and offered no further evidence.  https://t.co/IwUADYSQwI
1334930438385782786 2020-12-05 02:39:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot OK - please tell me how I can talk about it in such a way that is acceptable to you
1334929825996419073 2020-12-05 02:37:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jac33953508 fear of being called racists is partly to blame
1334929715359084544 2020-12-05 02:37:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jc4P45 and that is part of the problem as well - and if we are not able to find a way of talking about it - I get the impression things will get worse
1334929341885648903 2020-12-05 02:35:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AntiGobshite @SunScot if talking about is exploiting it then we should never talk about cases again - any cases
1334928925085069312 2020-12-05 02:33:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Rolo_Tamasi that was the charge
1334928816549081093 2020-12-05 02:33:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TGesches @Lizard609 @FlippaDipp @JosephMonahan @MegGreen63 btw - there is no one I know  - or have ever met - who thinks we should colonise anywhere  and yet we seem to be allowing our own country to be colonised
1334928369499205635 2020-12-05 02:31:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TGesches @Lizard609 @FlippaDipp @JosephMonahan @MegGreen63 There are push and pull factors driving immigration  Our open door policy - housing and benefit allocation is a pull factor  we can do something about our pull factors   As for armed conflict - I have no problem with us totally ignoring the rest of the world and refusing to help
1334927809521872907 2020-12-05 02:29:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jc4P45 it is difficult to find a way of describing what has happened with any accuracy - a mine field
1334927408219164672 2020-12-05 02:27:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AndreaAlbion @robinmonotti a new phrase to me Andrea - thanks - I shall look at it
1334927222470225920 2020-12-05 02:27:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Rolo_Tamasi it was a crime of murder until today
1334927074663002113 2020-12-05 02:26:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TGesches @Lizard609 @FlippaDipp @JosephMonahan @MegGreen63 white people racists - colonisers   therefore we deserve to have our children killed and raped - is that what you are saying?
1334926461418033155 2020-12-05 02:24:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse shame I don't know anyone from Albania - about the only place I dont know anyone from
1334926303594762241 2020-12-05 02:23:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Rolo_Tamasi it is not the institution that is in question - it is the crime - murder
1334925717197516800 2020-12-05 02:21:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jc4P45 one may have caused the other
1334925620233592834 2020-12-05 02:20:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @realbenjaminq yes
1334925206830411781 2020-12-05 02:19:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse and if we have thought about it - I think it fair to say the CPS and Police etc have - and I think it fair to say the mental health teams would have tried to contact their counterparts in Albania for her records etc for treatment  which begs the question - why has it not come up?
1334924213925376000 2020-12-05 02:15:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @snarfledoof OK - what is my agenda?
1334924039006134278 2020-12-05 02:14:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Recneps32946678 totally agreed
1334923814031994882 2020-12-05 02:13:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse agreed - and I think her lawyers helped her do so   finally the CPS helped ensure it
1334923532367749120 2020-12-05 02:12:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse I read she had attacked her Mother - I find it very hard to believe this had not happened before in Albania - where I suspect she did receive some form of treatment   I think it is significant that this line of investigation has not been discussed / raised
1334922859727171585 2020-12-05 02:09:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnShort70 @TGesches @JosephMonahan @FlippaDipp @MegGreen63 this is how insane you are Nigel - I talk about these cases because people are afraid to do so - because we are called racists and attacked etc - and you try to portray me as a racist who only cares about white kids  stop it
1334922301654126595 2020-12-05 02:07:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @snarfledoof No Allan - you are wrong
1334922167893549059 2020-12-05 02:07:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse &lt;and if she was diagnosed with a condition - this would make me question (even more) why she was allowed to stay - especially after her application for status was refused
1334921908584898563 2020-12-05 02:05:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KeyserSosse Hi Keyser - I know you have been following this case quite closely - I was wondering if Skana had developed her mental health condition in Albania and if she was being treated while there - can not find any reports about this (which is curious)&gt;&gt;
1334920993542987777 2020-12-05 02:02:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @manipura95 yes Amanda - we must - and we will

1334917181478498310 2020-12-05 01:47:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FlippaDipp @TGesches @JosephMonahan @MegGreen63 immigrant is the person immigration is the policy   stop being a virtue seeking child

1334915707038003201 2020-12-05 01:41:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SunScot @PaulBro97733140 @ffreetimeruel she was smuggled into the UK in 2014 her asylum application was rejected she has ongoing mental health issues and was a risk  she was not deported  it is our fear of being called racist that is the problem and allowed this - and you are perpetuating it

1334897718582513665 2020-12-05 00:29:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewRedmond1 you're proving it for me
1334897584930959360 2020-12-05 00:29:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 she came to UK in  2014 - if she was that ill - this would have been known before she left - why was she allowed into UK with a mental health condition?  her application for asylum was refused - she was not deported  she was smuggled into UK   https://t.co/S4uOthZm5c
1334896104916328450 2020-12-05 00:23:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 No - we deport some  why are we not deporting them all?  If Jamaica deported UK nationals who commit crimes there - would that be OK?

1334895367884857345 2020-12-05 00:20:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 we do not deport UK nationals - agreed we deport some people - yes we do not deport them all - why?
1334895129031794689 2020-12-05 00:19:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 yesterday we failed to deport a number of criminals to Jamaica   You are talking twaddle son
1334894664097345542 2020-12-05 00:17:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 yes - we have enough trouble to be dealing with - and we can not deal with that  when in a sinking boat - it is sensible to at least stop making more holes first
1334894109547503617 2020-12-05 00:15:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @armed_giraffe you are wrong - and that is a disgusting thing to say - No one wants to cause any upset to them   Grow up - you nasty spoilt brat
1334893854487695363 2020-12-05 00:14:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 you have no idea
1334893689055948804 2020-12-05 00:13:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 and we have added to fear of being called a racist to the list of imperfections
1334893519966629888 2020-12-05 00:13:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 there is far too much immigration and there has been for quite some time   we can not control our borders - afraid of being called racists we can not deport those not granted status -- too afraid of being called racists  we can not deport them when they steal, rape or  kill
1334892926091096064 2020-12-05 00:10:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FlippaDipp @MegGreen63 and yet here we are - discussing the murder of another
1334892740480536579 2020-12-05 00:10:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Mitch20015 killing white is ok in Britain
1334892447458004992 2020-12-05 00:08:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 the justice system is not perfect - far from it
1334892278855372800 2020-12-05 00:08:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 why do we discuss cases - to try to protect ourselves against them in the future
1334891848314269699 2020-12-05 00:06:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 sounds like this was another possible miscarriage of justice - and he should face a murder trial  During the 38-year-old’s trial at Exeter crown court, it emerged that he began the series of killings just hours after being bailed by police following an earlier vicious assault
1334891074783997961 2020-12-05 00:03:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewRedmond1 Brilliant piece of self fulfilling prophecy - congratulations

1334890581840044033 2020-12-05 00:01:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @armed_giraffe By discussing the case - maybe we can prevent others
1334890257167224832 2020-12-05 00:00:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK @SeymourWeeks1 Not quite sure what point you are trying to make Jon - other that attempting to deflect attention from the murder of Emily
1334889855055179783 2020-12-04 23:58:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SeymourWeeks1 @PartyOatsUK also Skana had not begged for Psychiatric help before carrying out the murder of Emily
1334889198218850305 2020-12-04 23:56:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @armed_giraffe you will know that her image has been widely used
1334887406152134656 2020-12-04 23:48:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieB17 @PartyOatsUK A child has been murdered and that is your response
1334886799815094273 2020-12-04 23:46:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK and why are none of these cases and many like them ever investigated as possible race / hate crimes
1334886614401683456 2020-12-04 23:45:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PartyOatsUK why are we allowing people with criminal records, and mental health issues here? why are we not deporting those with failed applications? why are we not deporting those that do commit crimes - including rape and murder why are we ignoring gang rape of white girls

1334851698062467073 2020-12-04 21:26:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> WHAT THEY ARE SAYING IS  there is no realistic chance of getting a murder conviction because we are so addicted to calling white people racists that we have become incapable of rational thought and instead have been reduced to treating white people as second class citizens  https://t.co/v0CvFRTMAq

1334542636145913857 2020-12-04 00:58:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse yes - and this is an example of it
1334492640180654082 2020-12-03 21:40:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky @JamesD_1985 @AlanRob72063198 sense?
1334490042581078022 2020-12-03 21:29:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anconky @JamesD_1985 @AlanRob72063198 because I can have such interesting discussions here
1334489712963227649 2020-12-03 21:28:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AnnaEsse @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree OK
1334489386562580481 2020-12-03 21:27:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse both needs have been assessed as being the same - but barriers prevent one and those barriers do not exist for the other
1334489022719254528 2020-12-03 21:25:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse why should people get a house - because they will die or suffer very badly if they do not?  I suspect we agree on that  The question is - how should they get it - who should provide it
1334488590886297605 2020-12-03 21:24:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse unequal - you tell me  2 applicants for housing 1 has arrears - can not get it 1 does not - gets it  if you think that is fair - OK But from where I am sitting - it does not seem entirely fair to me
1334487196305395715 2020-12-03 21:18:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse yes - because they have no history here - no previous housing - no rent arrears   No barriers to housing once entitlement to it is given
1334486836048240640 2020-12-03 21:17:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse why should they move wherever they like? if they do move - why should they be given a house, a job - money - why?
1334486487975464966 2020-12-03 21:15:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse yes
1334486205136850944 2020-12-03 21:14:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse we seem to be reaching an end to our debate - I get the feeling you do not want to admit (to yourself) that the person having priority treatment is the immigrant - so keep trying to deflect from that
1334485036771528710 2020-12-03 21:10:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse they want to make this country their home?  why dont they want to make their country their home? can we make this country our home?  is it racist if we make this country our home?
1334484720265129984 2020-12-03 21:08:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse No - they were not found to have a greater need - their needs were assessed as being equal   the Brit was excluded because they had arrears that need addressing first - the immigrant has no such problems - because they have never had a property here
1334484304697692162 2020-12-03 21:07:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse the person taking priority (in our example) is the immigrant - the person not taking priority is the person born here
1334483635928506369 2020-12-03 21:04:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse as for why should we house immigrants - I am asking why do we have a responsibility to house them - but their own countries does not  and if their own countries do - why are they here?
1334483229978537988 2020-12-03 21:02:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse No - I am not saying there are people who are being housed who should not be  I am saying British people in rent arrears who should be housed or not being housed and immigrants are being housed
1334482495585259520 2020-12-03 20:59:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I get the feeling you do not want to say that the British person has been treated less equally
1334482217456848896 2020-12-03 20:58:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse too late
1334480877527719937 2020-12-03 20:53:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse If some are saying yes - then we should be talking about it - finding out why - how many - what can we do to stop them  what can we do to protect people
1334480208292884483 2020-12-03 20:50:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse 'wrong' people - you've done it again - used language to create an impression  the 'wrong' people here - are the British people in rent arrears - poor / low paid Brits are the wrong people
1334479854897606656 2020-12-03 20:49:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse will that help them get housed?
1334479476256874499 2020-12-03 20:47:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse some (few) muslims speak out +some (fewer) muslims who speak out are threatened = less muslim speak out  divided by the number of muslim protesting about islamophobia  multiplied by the number killing
1334478968934846471 2020-12-03 20:45:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse that is not spam - that is evidence of creating fear in a variety of settings
1334478658774286340 2020-12-03 20:44:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse that is taking the issue off in another direction - the issue at hand is - is islm inspiring, motivating, instructing, demanding some people to do these things and benefitting from it - such as obtaining power?
1334477737998884864 2020-12-03 20:41:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse great - please tell me who is in most urgent need and why?
1334477519358144518 2020-12-03 20:40:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse the person, in the example we are using, who gets priority treatment is the immigrant
1334477027643191298 2020-12-03 20:38:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse also - maybe the person in rent arrears - stands a better chance of getting better pay if there was less competition for low paid jobs - and maybe their rent would be cheaper if there was less competition for housing (just a thought)
1334474796785131520 2020-12-03 20:29:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse but now we just no platform them - or force the university to not invite them - happy days
1334474567771951105 2020-12-03 20:28:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse an interesting example of intimidation and disruption at a University lecture   https://t.co/ISVgjURG1Y

1334472241451560963 2020-12-03 20:19:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse rare - can you define rare  yesterday saw 2 women stabbed in Burnley and stabbing in Holland  also recently had stabbing in Brum and Reading (possible islamic homophobic attacks)  can you tell me what rare means?
1334471328217387008 2020-12-03 20:15:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse so I also asked you - why does the country the immigrant left not have a duty to them   but you did not answer that
1334470967071035392 2020-12-03 20:14:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse yes - and i am replying that the person being treated differently - worse - is the existing British citizen - and I have explained why they are   But you don't seem to be concerned about that
1334469379204014081 2020-12-03 20:07:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse if muslim priests (people) are appalled by 9/11- would you not expect them to speak out about it - or Charlie Hebdo - or Samuel Paty  or would you expect them to march against islamophobia - and this is why I have concerns about islam
1334468835609628672 2020-12-03 20:05:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse how is this islamophobia?  In October 2001, former prime minister Lady Margaret Thatcher was accused of Islamophobia when she said "I have not heard enough condemnation [of 9/11] from Muslim priest
1334468390879191040 2020-12-03 20:03:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - but there you are - they are evicted and can not get housing because of their arrears - yet they are in priority need - the same as an immigrant - who can get housing  so things are not equal and the immigrant does get better help - is that fair?
1334467841437954049 2020-12-03 20:01:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse yes - no reason why  Just the mere accusation is enough to prove / suggest guilt  see what I mean - it's brilliant and highly effective
1334467561556209666 2020-12-03 20:00:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Yes - i think islam (as an ideology) is a serious threat - yes  I think fascism is a serious threat I think communism is a serious threat  could I be wrong about islam - yes - anyone can tell me why I am wrong - I have had numerous discussions about this over the years
1334466990501748738 2020-12-03 19:58:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse a higher priority?  the phrasing of these questions is very leading - I would not want to frame it in that way because it will lead to the inevitable accusations of racism - and this is what has caused these problems
1334466260470558720 2020-12-03 19:55:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Hello - me again yes! but what about those immigrants getting housed what about them well - you could use those houses for those in arrears sounds like you're a racist No - I'm just worried it's not fair Those are the rules yes, but... racist - security!
1334465843154067462 2020-12-03 19:53:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse excuse me yes I am concerned that people in rent arrears can not get housing tell them to pay some of their arrears they can't those are the rules I'm afraid - next
1334465405885296641 2020-12-03 19:52:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse You think Tories are probably Islamophobic - do you have any evidence for that - if not - do you wonder why you think that?  could you have been indoctrinated for example - could you have been manipulated into thinking that?
1334464400586117120 2020-12-03 19:48:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I have no problem with you asking from a place of curiosity   My place would be more of concern - but the main point is we should be asking the questions
1334464021827899393 2020-12-03 19:46:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse more important - you mean as a human being - no  I think we probably agree that all human beings have equal value
1334463476518047747 2020-12-03 19:44:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse who makes the decision about need - and how are they making it
1334463323467870208 2020-12-03 19:43:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse the next big attempt will be to try and portray the Tories as Islamophobic
1334463193851326464 2020-12-03 19:43:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it works the other way - the politician who is able to successfully portray their (usually) opponent as a racist in some way - wins  examples - Heath v Powell, Boris v Corbyn  Diane Abbot, David Lammy Naz Shah etc etc v anyone
1334461288932663297 2020-12-03 19:35:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @KaylaChowShow left hand down?
1334461064046653440 2020-12-03 19:34:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse these children are following instruction - you might even think it was a form of indoctrination (if they were white)
1334460869644783621 2020-12-03 19:33:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse if children were goose stepping and shouting (you know what) on their way to school in tune with their teachers - would you be slightly concerned?
1334460566467997697 2020-12-03 19:32:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse The phrase was allegedly first used by the Prophet Muhammad in the seventh century. Muhammad is said to have used it as a rallying cry before the Battle of Badr in what is now modern day Saudi Arabia on March 13 624.
1334460355955859457 2020-12-03 19:31:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse does a Nation have a responsibility towards its own citizens - who are its citizens?

1334459496563924993 2020-12-03 19:28:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse what you are missing - is that the immigrant has become more entitled  they are more entitled than the British person in arrears  is that fair?  Should the British person go abroad in search of housing - how can they afford it?  should the immigrant first ask their country?
1334459009735286785 2020-12-03 19:26:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse in terms of political power - calling / suggesting / implying people are racists has worked brilliantly for 50+ years - it is quite possibly the most effective tool in a politicians armoury
1334458663810043904 2020-12-03 19:25:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse classic piece of deflection - very skilful

1334457875511566339 2020-12-03 19:22:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse again - I think the word plot is not helpful  But we should definitely be asking is it happening - and I think there is very strong evidence to show it is
1334457607612936204 2020-12-03 19:21:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse you tell me?   https://t.co/Ih7VZlRGwJ

1334456877065900032 2020-12-03 19:18:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse as for HB - that is decided upon income - and if people are defrauding then they should be prosecuted
1334456697797160963 2020-12-03 19:17:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse in terms of housing need the law is quite clear - you must be homeless to start with - then have a local connection - then no arrears or legal judgements barring you from access to social housing
1334456257202315266 2020-12-03 19:15:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse make others feel guilt  blame others for problems claim virtue for wanting to do something imply doom for not following your wishes
1334455770675548160 2020-12-03 19:13:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I disagree - they do not use lie as a means of getting what they want  they use emotion - guilt, blame, virtue, fear are effective weapons at the moment
1334454843147243522 2020-12-03 19:10:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I would not use the word label - it brings negative meaning and emotion to the discussion   - but it is definitely something that we should be talking about on those lines

1334454065259028480 2020-12-03 19:06:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I agree about perception of threat - but what happens when this perception is reality?  and how will we know when we have crossed from one (perception) to the other (reality)
1334453637842669568 2020-12-03 19:05:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse also - why is it our responsibility to house the immigrant - and not their own country?  or can the rent arrears get housed by another country?
1334453370736832513 2020-12-03 19:04:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - but we were discussing housing need  who is in more need  an immigrant without a house or a family evicted from theirs because of arrears?

1334446932849209345 2020-12-03 18:38:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> we should not allowing people with criminal records into this country and we should be deporting any that commit crimes while here  would they say it was racist if Jamaica deported an English man who had raped someone in Jamaica?

1334439793346945024 2020-12-03 18:10:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I totally agree - it is the ones who do know that I am worried about  It only takes 1 person to behead a teacher to destroy free speech in education in the whole of the western world
1334439483106799617 2020-12-03 18:09:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse @HeartsofOakUK the Father also reports that he was arrested for trying to protect his daughter - 5:30min
1334439161529577479 2020-12-03 18:07:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse here is an interview with @HeartsofOakUK - allegations that this is still happening - fast forward to 9mins if you do not want to watch the whole interview   https://t.co/GgFHKN6C0X
1334438662218584064 2020-12-03 18:05:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse Hi David - a current example could be happening in Barrow where allegations have been made and Police have claimed nothing has happened   it seems fair to say something has happened - I have no idea what   https://t.co/XNPu9hz77O
1334437260410937346 2020-12-03 18:00:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse can we talk about the different issues in terms of infrastructure when discussing the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya muslims in China?  Or should we be stand up against their being cleansed?
1334436714534801410 2020-12-03 17:58:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - sadly that is not how things are - we must deal in realities - not with what we think things are or what we want them to be  although I agree - we should seek change
1334436390537453568 2020-12-03 17:56:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse what do politicians want?
1334436162623197184 2020-12-03 17:55:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - that is a noble aspiration  I would refer you once more to the history of the Americas for some reasons why this might not be such a good idea and the value of a people protecting their borders
1334434780650364928 2020-12-03 17:50:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse the question is not what do you believe - but what do those that follow islam believe   and it is not - what do you think (or want to believe) they believe  It is what do they believe and maybe looking at what they are saying and doing may give us some clues
1334251183544922113 2020-12-03 05:40:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I apologies my friend - Mrs Pym is getting very cross with me - and I must do some creeping to make amends  thanks for the discussion - and for listening without calling me racist - most refreshing
1334250743738609668 2020-12-03 05:39:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse 1 man killed Samuel Paty - and now they will never discuss Charlie Hebdo in schools again in France  and many marched about islamophobia after the murder of Paty   who is extreme  the man who killed the men and women who marched the people too afraid to teach about Hebdo?
1334250224718655489 2020-12-03 05:36:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse hmmm - on the surface it sounds fair   but how about this - we might exclude some white people who want to attend - and try to encourage some BME who do not  but - would we exclude BME from attending and encourage white who do not
1334249631375568897 2020-12-03 05:34:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse I'll have to get back to you on this - and take some time to discuss it properly - apologies for not giving it enough attention - been caught up in another discussion
1334248084222730250 2020-12-03 05:28:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse who decides what is robust evidence or not?  and how?
1334247826579218434 2020-12-03 05:27:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it just so happens you are English - stop complaining about it - you racist or I'll call the Police
1334247611096829953 2020-12-03 05:26:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - but when we evict people we are then making them in need of housing - but they can't get social housing - so someone else does  who is most in need - not those with arrears apparently - or if they are - tough - pay your rent first
1334246650840293387 2020-12-03 05:22:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse not necessarily - I d not think ethnic cleansing of the English / British has been a deliberate policy - it is a consequence of other (immigration) policies  where I think it could be argued it is deliberate is in our refusal / reluctance / fear to discuss it
1334246096818884608 2020-12-03 05:20:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse but it did go wrong - and we shut those people up too - we called them racists because it worked so well shutting down those that expressed concerns about immigration   and now all we do is shut people up and this is also dehumanising us and filling us with guilt and fear
1334245651828387840 2020-12-03 05:18:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse but both of these ideas were built on arrogance - firstly we were arrogant to think that our culture was so special people would jump at the chance to adopt it - and then we became arrogant that all cultures can exist side by side in peace and love and unicorns
1334245096347361282 2020-12-03 05:16:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse we did have something like that - then we changed and adopted multiculturalism - which meant there was no need for you to embrace our way of life - live your own - we will accept you for it- which we did - then we noticed that they do not seem to accepting us - Oh?
1334244623083057156 2020-12-03 05:14:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse there has been one consistent - if you complain about immigration you are a racist - and this has stopped the debate and made what little constructive discussion and analysis about it impossible
1334243307573174272 2020-12-03 05:09:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse apologies - I've got a few days off and have got caught up in this - it is helping me express my thoughts - usually people have just resorted to calling me a racist long before now and blocking me    I am obliged to you
1334242578905133056 2020-12-03 05:06:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it is leading that way   and it depends upon whether you want to be fair, open and honest or not
1334242293256163329 2020-12-03 05:05:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse  https://t.co/Hv7Wcismha  they are doing it for islam - either in part or in whole  they keep telling us this - but we keep telling them they are not - we seem to think we know why they are killing us better than they do
1334241950334152706 2020-12-03 05:04:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Our driving motivation doesn't come from tangible commodities that this world has to offer.  Our religion is Islam - obedience to the one true God, Allah, and following the footsteps of the final prophet and messenger Muhammad... This is how our ethical stances are dictated  7/7
1334240238487658499 2020-12-03 04:57:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse  https://t.co/BgCnU54EtS
1334239835377299461 2020-12-03 04:55:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse people do want to kill us - they are doing so  The keeping of weapons in USA is about self defence - to protect your family and people - also against a cruel tyrannical government   Islamic attacks are not self defence - they are about forcing submission through violence and fear
1334238900492103682 2020-12-03 04:51:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Please feel free - but please do not use complexity as an excuse for allowing or expressing hypocrisy or double standards
1334237786208079873 2020-12-03 04:47:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse and those that do speak out - or discuss it - are easily dismissed as racists and bigots  and round and round it goes - the witchfinder has his next victim
1334237420330606598 2020-12-03 04:46:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse they usually acquire local connection because they have been waiting for residency status in that area for longer than  months  job done
1334237210074378248 2020-12-03 04:45:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - and once that status is given - and they have a local connection (6 months stay) they can apply for housing under priority status and get it
1334236963977703427 2020-12-03 04:44:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I think if we all end up living isolated lives because we have no choice - then life would become very very difficult
1334236711711281152 2020-12-03 04:43:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse so are we being cleansed   if no - what would it take for cleansing to be happening - less than 80%  less than 50%  when is it called cleansing?
1334236408253444096 2020-12-03 04:42:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - B&amp;B is used as a stop gap - or if they do not qualify for social housing
1334228560446427136 2020-12-03 04:10:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse are the English / British an ethnic group?  3rd time of asking - I can only assume you are not answering because you realise the predicament this puts us in - when we have to face that ethnic cleansing may be occurring
1334228115795697668 2020-12-03 04:09:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse &lt;&lt;but all we managed to do is now create British people who feel alienated from this country - but we call them racists and blame them for that   and increasingly people are seeing this double standard - and it will unravel
1334227769375531013 2020-12-03 04:07:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse you seem to accept that it is understandable that an immigrant and / or their descendants could feel alienated from this country - and we should do all we can to help them feel welcome (which we have been doing for 50+ years)&gt;&gt;
1334227481218387969 2020-12-03 04:06:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse please give me facts - please give me irrefutable evidence that this is all working brilliantly - and not to worry  I would love to see it
1334226693670711301 2020-12-03 04:03:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse you did not answer - are the English / British an ethnic group?
1334226585394798596 2020-12-03 04:03:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse and as the demographic shift (possible ethic cleansing?) takes shape - what then?  France? Lebanon South Africa?  what is the example that matches our prospective future?
1334226125283790848 2020-12-03 04:01:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Manchester bomber was not born here  exactly - why are they doing this - do they see themselves as different - because of islam - is islam encouraging this  how do they view us - as racists? - as colonisers? - as slavers?  how can we tolerate the intolerant?
1334225562991288322 2020-12-03 03:58:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse less likely to want to kill us - god help us if they ever actually want to do that  Bury my heart at wounded knee is a very good read - after every attack - after every deceit - so many Native leaders said - dont upset the white man - be kind   you know what happened
1334225145561485312 2020-12-03 03:57:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I am like that - we have been doing exactly that for 50+ yrs   and look at what is happening to us  stabbings murders BLM riots terrorism positive discrimination aka anti white / British discrimination
1334224696146006018 2020-12-03 03:55:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse part 7 applicants have priority status for housing - other applicants must wait in line
1334224460514258951 2020-12-03 03:54:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Poor white people get into debt - can't afford rent - get evicted  Apply for housing - can not get it - until they have cleared some of their arrears - left in temporary accommodation and moved from place to place  Immigrant - no rent arrears - with a local connection - accepted
1334223921969844233 2020-12-03 03:52:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I think once granted refugee status you are no longer classifies as an asylum seeker - not sure if council or HA record who occupies their properties on ethnic lines - and it would be voluntary - self identified
1334223496021471234 2020-12-03 03:50:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it was much easier for immigrants to access social housing because of part 7 and no rent arrears or other such barriers  - i suspect this is still the case
1334222997142564867 2020-12-03 03:48:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it varies from place to place and time to time - 10 / 15 years ago there were many from Somalia - eastern europeans have been happening relatively recently
1334222584771129347 2020-12-03 03:47:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - access via part 7 is to all forms of social housing - council and H/A
1334222250199969796 2020-12-03 03:45:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse are the English / British an ethnic group?
1334217762982531073 2020-12-03 03:27:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it's a shame we don't all live in our own rooms - ignoring everyone else  if only we all that we would all be so much happier
1334217508979683330 2020-12-03 03:26:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse OK - and how do you propose they do that?  and what makes you think that is the problem - maybe the problem is with you not fully understanding the problem and dismissing it so easily
1334217027934937094 2020-12-03 03:25:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Hey ho - Sue today - gone tomorrow  any thoughts on ethnic cleansing - care to provide a definition
1334216037819158531 2020-12-03 03:21:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse go ahead - please let me know your thoughts

1334215051004272642 2020-12-03 03:17:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse can you tell me what ethnic cleansing means to you?
1334214833567358977 2020-12-03 03:16:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse yes - but can they demand that - can they insist it continues?
1334211779895889922 2020-12-03 03:04:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Because that is what happens - and when it does not happen - there is conflict   the binds that tie us together must be stronger than those that pull us apart
1334211458482245634 2020-12-03 03:02:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I think that shows what a mess we are in - because millions of people do support them
1334211226155544585 2020-12-03 03:01:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse no reason  is it significant / interesting / relevant that the people who are doing the replacing are BME?
1334201162996854788 2020-12-03 02:22:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse It does not matter - this is happening in every major city and town in UK and has for a very long time
1334200936525402112 2020-12-03 02:21:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse what am I thinking - our culture / society is infected with anti white hatred, bigotry and prejudice because we have been indoctrinated into believing we are racists -
1334200557981011969 2020-12-03 02:19:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse let me ask you - is halal a British value - Burquas / hijabs - fgm - child brides - polygamy - sharia - gender segregation  any of these?
1334199991188004864 2020-12-03 02:17:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse there - we do not have the confidence to know what is a British value  we have undermined and eroded everything we are - cultural marxism in action
1334199709490098184 2020-12-03 02:16:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse In theory - I agree  that is not the practice at all - people know this
1334199372695949312 2020-12-03 02:14:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse let me ask you - what would happen to a white mayor - or white political figure if he asked for more white public figures on TV to reflect the population they serve?  what would happen to him what would we call him - a racist?
1334198981547724802 2020-12-03 02:13:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse take that argument back 50 years ago what would be the answer?  take it forward 50?  try - best person for the job - see how far that gets you  now try - reflect communities?  can we demand 99% white police in 99% white areas - is that fair?
1334198036839403521 2020-12-03 02:09:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse First they came for Sue Barker - but she was old and dull so I did nothing then they came for Eamon Holmes - but I never watched him anyway then they came for the Met - and they needed changing anyway then they came for me - Oh?  why did no one speak out earlier?
1334197454321946626 2020-12-03 02:07:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse halal is OK - what harm can it do - dont eat it burquas are OK - what harm is it doing you sharia is OK - it does not apply to you child brides are illegal / polyamy is illegal  notice the changing demographic? notice the increasing islamic voting block notice the legal changes
1334196401513897985 2020-12-03 02:03:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I have talked to people in management positions - they have said that when disciplining BME they try to avoid doing so - or have to be very careful to avoid accusations of racism
1334196008771870727 2020-12-03 02:01:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse because - they have differences and they want to people with people with similar characteristics and values etc

1334194218005389316 2020-12-03 01:54:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I have been following 2 stories today - stabbing in Burnley - man in islamic dress detained - 2 victims - women - stabbed - one possibly stabbed in neck - one may be a child&gt;&gt;
1334193336471728129 2020-12-03 01:50:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it was the case for Britain - mass immigration has changed this - and now we no longer know who we are - or how to define ourselves  Try asking a Nigerian to define his countrymen - or a Chinese man - or a Japanese man
1334192900050214913 2020-12-03 01:49:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse so when it happens against white people it is complex (because slavery - because racism etc)  but when it happens to BME it is not acceptable and illegal  Is that complex enough - or is it more complex than that?   or is it simply anti white bigotry and prejudice?
1334192300747071496 2020-12-03 01:46:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse feel free
1334191377110994947 2020-12-03 01:43:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse funny that  Doctor it hurts when I do that don't do it then Oh?
1334191186253320195 2020-12-03 01:42:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse You're dismissed is it because I'm white? No but my replacement is BME just a co-incidence Oh   You're dismissed it is because I'm BME No but my replacement if white just a co-incidence sued!

1334190530817888256 2020-12-03 01:39:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse does it lead to 7/7 - does it lead to lee Rigby - does it lead to Manchester  does it lead to building walls on bridges - security zones around Christmas markets  does it lead to growing fear and insecurity?  it sure looks like it to me
1334190143838834692 2020-12-03 01:38:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> wow - Michael Bisping - moral courage on display sir
1334189354508570624 2020-12-03 01:35:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse what about the cultural changes  halal burquas / hijabs call to prayer child brides fgm polygamy gender segregation sharia law courts first cousin marriages (birth defects)
1334187387216400384 2020-12-03 01:27:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse and this is what happened to her when she started to speak out - death threats   https://t.co/OuwtqRXBGt

1334172307212865536 2020-12-03 00:27:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse this is a circular argument - there is no way of speaking out about immigration without this accusation   our towns are changing - we are becoming strangers in our own towns and cities
1334171740570791937 2020-12-03 00:25:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse what if there is an invasion - what would make it an invasion - how would we know  is it demographics is it power, control and influence is it fear?

1334164312101883906 2020-12-02 23:55:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Flora34921110 totally agreed - I hope that as a country we are able to fully address this and begin to seriously take a look at what islam is doing to us
1334159228307697666 2020-12-02 23:35:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Flora34921110 agreed - that is where we are - not if - when  and how big
1334125988809236482 2020-12-02 21:23:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> 2 people stabbed in Burnley 2 people stabbed in Holland (no further information) car attack in German (may not be anything to do with it)  AND IT'S ONLY DECEMBER 2nd
1334124917038706690 2020-12-02 21:19:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> This is what a courageous sportsman looks like

1334117191600451584 2020-12-02 20:48:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrushPercy @Vladtepesblog   Witnesses claimed a girl was stabbed in the neck during the attack, but this has not yet been confirmed.
1334116869406666752 2020-12-02 20:47:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog - confirmed - 2 women
1334116410084249600 2020-12-02 20:45:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrushPercy it is being said the victims in Burnley were 2 women - not known to the attacker - at least one has been apparently stabbed in the neck  @Vladtepesblog
1334114359816105984 2020-12-02 20:37:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrushPercy @MailOnline @Vladtepesblog   the stabbing two people in a shop seems to be contagious - I wonder what the cause is?
1334113839181336584 2020-12-02 20:35:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it is the effect upon our culture - which is increasingly becoming part of our laws - such as diversity quotas - and legal interpretations
1334113502164881408 2020-12-02 20:33:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse and I agree - there are very few actual criminal convictions for race crimes - but there are many cases of people losing their jobs, being attacked etc - because of the accusation   And this is where the culture - in cultural marxism works
1334113077353197568 2020-12-02 20:31:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse same with islam - the argument then goes - you hate muslims - which is not true - it is islam that is the concern and should be critiqued  This has been a very powerful tactic and worked very well
1334112690671849472 2020-12-02 20:30:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse you're being very dismissive of these people - and Tommy Robinson   That is my point - playing the man and not the ball   I've never know anyone say the do not like foreigners - but many have said (me included) we are very concerned about the impact of mass immigration
1334091056476991489 2020-12-02 19:04:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LancsPolice @JakeHepple1 @Vladtepesblog - confirmed - 2 people stabbed
1334090771922874370 2020-12-02 19:03:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JakeHepple1 @Vladtepesblog better view - apparently stabbed 2 people?
1334090397874872321 2020-12-02 19:01:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JakeHepple1 @Vladtepesblog   reported stabbing in Burnley this morning - apparent suspect is dressed in islamic dress - no other information
1334074230208606208 2020-12-02 17:57:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse examples  Katie Hopkins Lozza Fox Danny Baker Jake Hepple Alistair Burnett Carol Thatcher Nigel Farage Andrew Norfolk Sarah Champion Enoch Powell  But the other danger - is people see what happens - and then become afraid of saying something - just in case
1334072868141998080 2020-12-02 17:52:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse the Nazi's did it - the communists did it - it was done to enable slavery  It is happening now - white people are increasingly seen as racists first and humans second  This is part of what I want to challenge - I am clear on this - and I am clear on where this ends up
1334072370856865793 2020-12-02 17:50:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I've just been reading 'Bury my heart at wounded knee'   dehumanising a group or ethnicity of people enables another group to persecute them - seeing them as somehow less than&gt;&gt;
1334072017281290241 2020-12-02 17:48:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse but people do lose their jobs, they do face social backlash - and there is genuine risk of being assaulted or abused as you go about your daily life
1334071687650947075 2020-12-02 17:47:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - people are not routinely thrown in jail - the law is working in far more sinister ways - you are interviewed, cautioned, investigated - then your life is looked into a bit deeper
1334068099058905089 2020-12-02 17:33:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse of such a crime - the teacher at Eton is another example - sacked for the mere accusation
1334067870309945344 2020-12-02 17:32:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse you can not prove a negative  No one can prove they are not a racist - and all you need is the mere accusation of it - to be proven one is   Maybe the law is a bit more robust - but our society is weak - Tommy Robinson is believed by many to be a racist - although never convicted
1334067367840780289 2020-12-02 17:30:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse this has become the Witch hunt of our times  Guilt of a crime you can not defend yourself from - accused by people in search of influence and virtue and power with no evidence  It is pathological
1334066964650749952 2020-12-02 17:28:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse example -   He's a racist how do you know? he said something are you sure he's a racist? are you supporting a racist? No - it just seems to me that is not what he said sounds like your a racist - arrest him!
1334066636618428416 2020-12-02 17:27:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - and what worries me is the direction of travel that we have seen this take - the trend  and how firm a grip it now has on our culture / society   and the damage that it is doing  But how can we even challenge this&gt;&gt;
1334066202663120896 2020-12-02 17:25:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse ..but it gets worse - people are persecuted - sacked, arrested etc if they express an opinion that someone else perceives as being impolite in some way - they are called racist / sexist / islamophobic - we have many ways to shut people up
1334065774797987840 2020-12-02 17:24:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse what can anyone do - I would think the answer to that is very straight forward - do not own any
1334065456144117771 2020-12-02 17:22:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse the whole world is impacted by slavery - including Africa - who used slaves / sold them etc - and it is still happening in some places
1334064774997536770 2020-12-02 17:20:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse but not for the sole purpose of simply informing us about what is happening  Yes - political correctness is part of it  Being polite - is not a problem - but when you are so afraid of not being polite that you are scared to express your opinion is &gt;&gt;
1334064397413720064 2020-12-02 17:18:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Like I said - it is difficult to identify accurately - but calling it cultural marxism (imo) is a start   Its about beginning to understand that we have been taught / told things in a variety of ways, for a variety of reasons - for a variety of outcomes&gt;&gt;
1334059195994435584 2020-12-02 16:57:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse and as for your question - what can you do - I would think learning from it is the most important thing - learn from your mistakes - and we have learnt - slavery is wrong  why do we not try to spread that message to those who still have slaves?  fear of being called racist?
1334058767911182336 2020-12-02 16:56:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ceo_binford Thanks Tim - all the best
1334058431767048192 2020-12-02 16:54:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I've never met anyone who tried to hide away from slavery - or thought it was a good thing - or wants to bring it back - the problem is - this is has become more than acknowledgment - it has become about fear of being called racists and people exploiting that
1334057817695727616 2020-12-02 16:52:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I wish I knew - I hate to use the phrase again - but I think cultural marxism (or however you want to describe it) - is part of this problem
1334057507430469632 2020-12-02 16:51:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse and yet here we are
1334057228245102592 2020-12-02 16:50:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FridayMinus @JimTimberthing If people, like you, spent as much time talking about grooming gangs as you do Tommy Robinson - then there would be no need for him - and he would become a non entity
1334056897444524033 2020-12-02 16:48:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FridayMinus @JimTimberthing If ur anti pedo (as you claim) why are you - not joining with him - or others - who are talking about grooming gangs - or other cases?
1334056578434129920 2020-12-02 16:47:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FridayMinus @JimTimberthing I'm a gullible plank?
1333872773861695492 2020-12-02 04:37:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed
1333872628222849025 2020-12-02 04:36:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it is not as simple as white nations bad - but what I think is a credit to us - is that we have learnt and have moved on - and we do not give ourselves enough (or any) credit for that
1333872314711240707 2020-12-02 04:35:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse also there is much to be proud of - when we stood up for what is right - and as far as slavery was concerned our efforts to eradicate it - also the white slave trade - and how that impacted us
1333872026965127168 2020-12-02 04:34:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse no - because it is not who we are now - all people can look at parts of their history with guilt - but that should not (and does not) define who we are now  We have learnt from those experiences - it would be troubling if we were still behaving like that
1333859808206843904 2020-12-02 03:45:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @iceni03373385 Not sure it was islamic - very hard to get an understanding of what was the cause   They do a good job at keeping us uniformed
1333859187407917058 2020-12-02 03:43:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JasonArgonaut13 hang on - I love McDonalds
1333855999342628867 2020-12-02 03:30:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse protecting children and convicting abusers is an ongoing issue - what is new - is the fear of being called a racist preventing this from happening
1333855759642324992 2020-12-02 03:29:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse for one - here we are (almost) talking about the issue of grooming children - which was not happening
1333855542834569222 2020-12-02 03:28:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse the major news story is about how the major news 9and others) have been so afraid of being called racists they ignored the gang rape of children
1333850048833204224 2020-12-02 03:06:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ceo_binford want it - what a thing to say   You may be right - it may not be a terror attack - but so far we do not know the motive - but whatever the motive is - the car did not bloody cause it
1333848360537755648 2020-12-02 03:00:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting agreed - and I think this links into previous discussions about racism and fears of being called it   we have been told that our fears (legitimate or not) of the other (person / foreigner) are evil - racist  and we are wrong to have them - don't listen to them
1333843157096783875 2020-12-02 02:39:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JonathanNichol4 @JohnScotting totally agreed - it is a masterclass in deception   and they have been doing this for years
1333842547152723968 2020-12-02 02:36:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting I must admit my initial reaction is terror attack and the media are going to try to and present it as something else - this is my default position - but I hope I am open minded enough to realise when I am wrong and try to present the story as it unfolds
1333839331283308547 2020-12-02 02:24:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting but as for motive - we do not have one yet  I suspect the car did not cause it to happen by itself
1333838904231948288 2020-12-02 02:22:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting and while I agree terror attack is seemingly the other end of the spectrum - it would be nice if we could actually read a story like this and feel like we were being kept informed rather than led down a path
1333838543672782850 2020-12-02 02:21:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting what worries me is the reporting of these incidents can often be misleading in order to steer us in a particular way - the words used 'car rampage' suggest something more innocent(?)
1333837790614851587 2020-12-02 02:18:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting there seems to be a lack of any evidence - they seem to know the person who did it - they seem to know something about his history
1333835038757167108 2020-12-02 02:07:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> car rampage - is that code for terror attack?
1333831112422985732 2020-12-02 01:51:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AnnaEsse @mcilhagger I agree that others have spoken out   Yet Tommy was able to force people to take notice - and put it into the public domain
1333822708686184451 2020-12-02 01:18:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse  https://t.co/sgwchTrFgO
1333815597369536513 2020-12-02 00:49:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse increasingly the media does not see it's job as providing information - it sees it as informing us what to think
1333815331299741697 2020-12-02 00:48:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse But I take the point - there is a lot of nonsense out there - I think it is upto reasonable people to try and find out as much as possible and help provide this information to the public - which was what the media was for
1333814943615946753 2020-12-02 00:47:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I think people's opinions are important to them - we must be careful if we begin to discount others opinions because we deem them inferior in some way
1333814401909059584 2020-12-02 00:45:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse that is definitely part of the problem - how do we describe these cultural changes in such a way that we can understand what has happened - what has caused them to happen and why - and then alleviate the problems
1333812212755025921 2020-12-02 00:36:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Margaretb2107 agreed - she sat on the bench for some time before selecting Emily
1333806085984149504 2020-12-02 00:12:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> Dr Langley adds: “I felt sometimes that there was a delay before she answered my questions. It was my impression that this wasn’t due to an underlying psychotic issue, it was more that she was considering her answers carefully.”   https://t.co/KGpb120nQr
1333805731817156609 2020-12-02 00:10:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> She said, ‘It was premeditated, I waited in the park, I picked my victim, and I killed somebody and tried to run away’.   https://t.co/KGpb120nQr
1333804205190987776 2020-12-02 00:04:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog German national - they are using words I understand - in ways I understand - but they are not telling me what happened - they are telling me what to think
1333801155487363077 2020-12-01 23:52:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog   1st December 2020 - a terrorist attack on a Christmas market town - and a master class of journalistic mis-direction and propaganda which leaves you thinking I have no idea what has happened - but it is not THAT   https://t.co/e0Fakr4sBb
1333800465146937353 2020-12-01 23:49:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BiffaBow they are not seeking to inform us - they are seeking to indoctrinate us   and they are doing a bloody good job of it
1333800031644655625 2020-12-01 23:48:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Crosscolin88 the report into this is an expert example of mis-direction  As usual
1333799526839173121 2020-12-01 23:46:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> 1st December 2020    https://t.co/e0Fakr4sBb
1333799362321793024 2020-12-01 23:45:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse this has created a society that is increasingly at odds with itself and no longer knows what is right or wrong   The question then becomes - how do we move forward from here?
1333799067357364235 2020-12-01 23:44:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I think it goes deeper than that - critical race theory and cultural marxism etc has brought us to this point  Our entire culture seems totally indoctrinated - and those that question the orthodoxy are called racists - dismissed and persecuted
1333795114892754951 2020-12-01 23:28:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richard06876470 agreed - increasingly they have become homeless help centres
1333794424300572677 2020-12-01 23:25:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Billboard49 @Mermaid76346490 @RatingsWord @Kushilions_100 She is right - and I have no doubt that in time - once everyone has calmed down and done some reflection that Tommy will be considered to have been a man of courage who stood against acts of evil
1333793880702033920 2020-12-01 23:23:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse that is definitely not the impression that I get - and I have attended a number of racial awareness courses - which are basically about how racist white people are and how BME are victims of white racism
1333793330807795719 2020-12-01 23:21:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richard06876470 quite clearly there has been something wrong for a long time - this appears to be the final nail in the coffin - my worry is - how many others will go
1333765770812207109 2020-12-01 21:31:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yusefayourself what would you have done?
1333761253701980170 2020-12-01 21:13:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SeanSeanbryson yes - that is what I think
1333760213174906881 2020-12-01 21:09:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SeanSeanbryson I think if our laws, police and courts are getting that ridiculous and petty - then we are in very big trouble - and the size of a scotch egg is the least of our worries
1333750930777530368 2020-12-01 20:32:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RightToOffend agreed - I would not like to live in a country where we are micro managed to such an extent that we are told what size of meals to eat
1333750446763216896 2020-12-01 20:31:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting totally agreed  It is a total mess - and instead of talking about what a mess it is - we talk about what a substantial meal is and scotch eggs
1333748879498604544 2020-12-01 20:24:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> Have we become so stupid that we need people to tell us what a substantial meal is?  https://t.co/cF2XhkRot9
1333747122232057858 2020-12-01 20:17:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse did you ever ask / wonder / discuss / think - why are cases of assault, abuse, gang rape, murder of white people not treated as race / hate crimes?
1333746694559846401 2020-12-01 20:16:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @AndyD26589058 @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool we may disagree on many things - but it seems we all like a bit of Ms Pam Ayres - so here goes    https://t.co/pwAYr7mO1R
1333746078026506240 2020-12-01 20:13:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Michael_Dunn4 @GeorgeAylett the greatest arrest of all time
1333744299738091521 2020-12-01 20:06:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LagudV is this in response to Samuel Paty?
1333742186035372034 2020-12-01 19:58:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yusefayourself it is the unprovoked part that is not clear
1333727260642258946 2020-12-01 18:58:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse expertise - interesting
1333726022160756738 2020-12-01 18:53:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nigeljc67 a great film - great hair if I remember rightly
1333723924849422336 2020-12-01 18:45:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JonathanNichol4 I get the feeling that this is the beginning of a lot of redundancies - and I think that will add to the current levels of social unrest   Maybe I am over - reacting
1333717079887900675 2020-12-01 18:18:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @JamesD_1985 @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool Look into my eyes and repeat after me .........  https://t.co/p5SFZcR5ZS
1333716614676623361 2020-12-01 18:16:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ChrisHu43197381 I hope he gets what he deserves
1333715827296755712 2020-12-01 18:13:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @JamesD_1985 @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool Hang on - 5 mins ago I was a racist twat - make up your mind
1333715600263307265 2020-12-01 18:12:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> Arcadia collapse - 13,000+ jobs at risk Debenhams collapse - 12,000 jobs at risk  It is going to get messy

1333712699474259969 2020-12-01 18:01:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool doh!
1333712146602012678 2020-12-01 17:58:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing I think all countries should do all they can to ensure those with criminal intent are not allowed into their countries - but if they do get in - then they are allowed to put them on trial and deport them if they wish - and not called racists to prevent them doing so
1333710203997609987 2020-12-01 17:51:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool I can chose my words - you can chose yours   I think that is best
1333709283398193153 2020-12-01 17:47:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing I hope he is put on trial - and deported if they want to
1333708379630526464 2020-12-01 17:43:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesD_1985 @scottthescot94 @JimTimberthing @MyshkinFool we are discussing that - now - I just have a different opinion   None of us can claim to know what exactly happened - we were not there
1333707845481672705 2020-12-01 17:41:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing  https://t.co/b8lR5PrHU4
1333707351304626176 2020-12-01 17:39:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool there could be a number of explanations  He knew who Tommy was and did it to get at him He did not know who she was and thought he'd get away with it It could have been accidental - and he could have waited to explain to Police Tommy made it up or something else
1333706094586327041 2020-12-01 17:34:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool have I hypnotised you yet - turned you into a racist twat - or  are my powers waning?
1333704578521501696 2020-12-01 17:28:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed - and I think calling people racists is something the more dangerous one use in order to garner power and position
1333704280373682176 2020-12-01 17:27:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool I prefer Pam Ayres myself
1333704049766658049 2020-12-01 17:26:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @scottthescot94 @JimTimberthing @MyshkinFool let me clarify - so I can understand  If a person is (possibly) inappropriate in some way to your child  (or another) - in principle - it is understandable to stop them - and hold them until the Police arrive
1333703485834006529 2020-12-01 17:24:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse This world is full of people like that - we seem to elect a lot of them
1333703205541253120 2020-12-01 17:23:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @scottthescot94 @MyshkinFool How can I convert you?  Look into my eyes and repeat after me - 'You are a racist twat - you are a racist twat'  Did it work - are you?
1333702799830487040 2020-12-01 17:21:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @scottthescot94 @JimTimberthing @MyshkinFool personally speaking - where possible I prefer to avoid banging my head against the wall and try the door
1333702541230673920 2020-12-01 17:20:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @scottthescot94 @JimTimberthing @MyshkinFool quite clearly we are not getting anywhere - we can continue to argue about what sort of person Tommy is - and just waste our time  or explore the issues and see what comes up
1333700661171589123 2020-12-01 17:13:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse Not sure he was justifying anything - he said openly he would condemn them if found guilty   The discussion about their sexuality is another topic (imo)  Maybe you could ask them about that and find out what he means
1333698123131219969 2020-12-01 17:03:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing I think it is a fairly neutral open question - however please feel free to frame it in a better way if you think it will help you answer it   (this is going to be hard work if I have to keep doing this)
1333697614576029696 2020-12-01 17:01:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @scottthescot94 @JimTimberthing this was not a reply to you -
1333697464654770176 2020-12-01 17:00:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing Do you accept that fear of being called racist prevented services (police, CPS, social workers, media etc) from doing their job and protecting these children?
1333697178838192128 2020-12-01 16:59:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @scottthescot94 @JimTimberthing @MyshkinFool I know people do not like him - my timeline is full of them   In those cases it would be more helpful to talk about the issues rather than the person
1333696195366187009 2020-12-01 16:55:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing and that is my real concern - rather than listen to Tommy - rather than investigate child grooming cases - rather than discuss immigration - some people shout racists and that gets them what they want
1333695901525798912 2020-12-01 16:54:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing I do think he is on to something - yes   and those that disagree with him - dont  But we would all be better off (as a society) if we stopped calling people we did not agree with racists and actually tried to listen and understand what their concerns are
1333695077416316930 2020-12-01 16:50:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing sometimes (mostly) we end up disagreeing - we do not have to agree - this is a free country
1333694910084608000 2020-12-01 16:50:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing none of us can claim to have all the facts - I am presenting my view - I am willing to listen with those of other views in the hope of learning - I hope those engaging with me are willing to do similar
1333694491862110208 2020-12-01 16:48:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ianpowe96421384 then the law must work for all - at the moment there are serious concerns that it is not - because it is terrified of being called racists - this is leading to a breakdown in trust
1333694225125355526 2020-12-01 16:47:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I like it  - you sausage
1333694105726160897 2020-12-01 16:47:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse they did say they would condemn them if they were found guilty
1333693493907255296 2020-12-01 16:44:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing I think I will present my opinions as I want to - and allow you to present yours as you want to   I think that is probably best
1333693266185900032 2020-12-01 16:43:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @FridayMinus is it not OK to be white?
1333693179128926208 2020-12-01 16:43:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @MyshkinFool your child or another stating that a man had made unwanted contact
1333692971728982016 2020-12-01 16:42:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing It is how I perceive it - agreed - but I do not think that everything I think is a fact - I am aware there are multiple sides to all stories   I can only speak from my own perspective
1333692671643312128 2020-12-01 16:41:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective I am not sure what that means
1333692537861705730 2020-12-01 16:40:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @FridayMinus and there is the dilemma - you are afraid to think openly because you do not even trust yourself enough that by doing so you can form a rational opinion without turning into a racist  that says more about you than I sir
1333692162416979968 2020-12-01 16:39:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing Nice turn around
1333692081588604928 2020-12-01 16:39:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing @MyshkinFool what would you do if it was your child - or member of your family - or you witnessed something like that?
1333691760879562753 2020-12-01 16:37:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective The point I am trying to make - that you are expertly avoiding - is that meaningful discussion about immigration have been suppressed for years because people have falsely accused those concerned about it of racism
1333691411858911236 2020-12-01 16:36:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CharlieMachi @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective why - because saying that we have become so afraid of being called racists that we are allowing serious criminal activity to take place - even though many reports and investigations have made the same conclusions
1333691003748954113 2020-12-01 16:34:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FridayMinus @JimTimberthing yes - or maybe people could actually listen to what he says, think openly about what is happening and try to make more rational thoughts
1333690656162770945 2020-12-01 16:33:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ThomasKeefe14 agreed - I have come across his work - although not studied it
1333690465774936073 2020-12-01 16:32:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse the issue is they are ignored - because we are terrified of being called racists - as you are doing  We all know gang rape, abuse, torture and in some cases murder of a child is evil so we should never accuse anyone of being racist for wanting it to be investigated
1333689282956046337 2020-12-01 16:27:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @JimTimberthing have I presented it like a fact?
1333689140651712512 2020-12-01 16:27:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MyshkinFool @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective she is Albanian - an immigrant  Every time we try to have a sensible rational discussion about immigration people who are concerned about it are called racists
1333688842470256641 2020-12-01 16:26:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GuillaumeDeKas agreed - and the press and media use her to push their agenda

1333539136536502274 2020-12-01 06:31:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ellendesc22 @kwilliam111 @HeartsofOakUK @Vladtepesblog not entirely sure that is true
1333538744004177921 2020-12-01 06:29:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DementedDaddiar yes - I totally missed that part  like you totally missing the part where no trial was actually derailed or interfered with  Defending lawyers may try anything - that is their job   hey ho
1333537622925471747 2020-12-01 06:25:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse talking about it is one thing - but (God forbid) we are ever in a position like Tommy and have to actually do something to protect our own child (or another) what would you do?
1333536442031747076 2020-12-01 06:20:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse But I accept that I may be biased  But ask yourself - if this was your child - or someone elses'  would you think justice had been done today?
1333536232379461638 2020-12-01 06:19:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse agreed   I am not sure Tommy can get a fair trial - ever
1333533724860952577 2020-12-01 06:09:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse I think the term is proportional force - not excessive
1333533598994096128 2020-12-01 06:09:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lesgantssexuels @jamesninethree @AnnaEsse it is reported that he is a convicted paedophile   - and yes - you can excuse an assault when it is done to protect an innocent person or child from abuse - or to ensure that an abuser is held for the police
1333532691665477635 2020-12-01 06:05:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @bibbleco sadly there are abusers in all walks of life - we must do all we can to ensure they are convicted and children are protected
1333532082597924865 2020-12-01 06:03:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DescendingA I totally agree with everything you said
1333531869187608576 2020-12-01 06:02:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders please
1333531645534724102 2020-12-01 06:01:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders are random acts of violence against black people a sign of racism?
1333530832485683205 2020-12-01 05:58:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders we will have to disagree on this  are random acts of violence against black people a sign of a racism problem?
1333530239608172547 2020-12-01 05:55:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders he did not impede the case - it went ahead
1333530097559724032 2020-12-01 05:55:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders you tell me - are random acts of violence against black people sign of a racism problem  yes or no please
1333529874401779715 2020-12-01 05:54:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SamanthaJBrady1 they are connected -they both happened today - that says something to me   her case is widely reported
1333529198594568195 2020-12-01 05:51:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EESprite No I am not trying to say that - read the tweet again
1333529026032492547 2020-12-01 05:51:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders I disagree - he did not influence the case - it went ahead we do have an immigration problem - quite clearly random acts look very similar to me
1333528299117686786 2020-12-01 05:48:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EESprite why - because they are both happening on the same day - I think they are saying something about the state of our country - you are free to tell me what you think or point out that I am wrong  But I would be grateful if you would avoid verbal abuse
1333527949908320256 2020-12-01 05:46:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders all the people who walked past her - why did she pick that one?  Just by chance - random  I see a recurring theme in these random attacks - which makes me think they might not be quite so random as we think they are
1333527420830412800 2020-12-01 05:44:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders why was she here? he would not have been in that position if we investigated the issues he talks about
1333527188298199041 2020-12-01 05:43:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders anti white hatred - has the constant calling  white people racists legitimised grievance and encouraged attacks against them
1333526782541225984 2020-12-01 05:42:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders immigration - we have been too scared of being called racists to ensure people are vetted etc  grooming gangs - we have been too scared of being called racists that we ignored them - Tommy did not - he has been persecuted for doing so
1333525861388201984 2020-12-01 05:38:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders I may be wrong - but so far I have not been persuaded that I am - please feel free to tell me why I am
1333525621398450181 2020-12-01 05:37:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders because they are both happening on the same day - and they are both saying something about what is happening in this country - I think part of what they are saying is that our fear of being called racist is destroying us and allowing evil to happen
1333525231835762688 2020-12-01 05:36:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders I think we are in agreement (more or less)
1333524815093829634 2020-12-01 05:34:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SimonKelly14 I'm losing the will to live
1333524316592418817 2020-12-01 05:32:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Pingachoo @garyraikes3 @MatthewRedmond1 any person who commits a crime should be charged and tried - any  Crimes against children are particularly unacceptable
1333523966300917766 2020-12-01 05:31:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders none?
1333523804736401415 2020-12-01 05:30:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders its the following of the laws that seems to be the problem - specifically following them without fear of being called a racist
1333523518424748037 2020-12-01 05:29:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @rusty_shield it is not his job - but protecting his daughter is his duty
1333523310601179146 2020-12-01 05:28:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @rusty_shield are you misgendering?
1333523215046635524 2020-12-01 05:28:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @enigma_57 @Kushilions_100 society - is people living together culture - art and stuff that help us do so
1333522826377261056 2020-12-01 05:26:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nine_pound @neilayates @Sherloc43863463 In the land of the blind - the one eyed man plays guitar
1333522499347369988 2020-12-01 05:25:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LuxemburgLes nice
1333520948679618564 2020-12-01 05:19:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders fear of being called a racist
1333520736967938049 2020-12-01 05:18:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SibthorpeMark @Kushilions_100 no self respecting society should be afraid of convicting any criminals - especially those that abuse children
1333520489927618560 2020-12-01 05:17:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DementedDaddiar I do not agree with that - the trial went ahead - none have been jeopardised
1333520241511591948 2020-12-01 05:16:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nine_pound @neilayates @Sherloc43863463 I went and asked a local imman if islam was a religion of peace - he could not look at me and walked away
1333519864045178881 2020-12-01 05:14:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pellowponders @CowObjective Not entirely
1333519765307060225 2020-12-01 05:14:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jaydarcy7 @azzadinhooooo @sophr08 @SlothenKing @Kushilions_100 so what is your point?
1333519438440771584 2020-12-01 05:13:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DementedDaddiar yes - sadly they get everywhere  all we can is try to ensure children are protected as best they can be - and that these criminals are caught and convicted
1333519060575903744 2020-12-01 05:11:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jaydarcy7 @azzadinhooooo @sophr08 @SlothenKing @Kushilions_100 agreed - it is reasonable to assume she was - because it was common - but there is no evidence to prove it
1333518882703814656 2020-12-01 05:10:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nine_pound @neilayates @Sherloc43863463 it is a good question - what are they preaching in mosques?
1333518672472772608 2020-12-01 05:10:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Sumz891 @FeedMeWarpstone @Kushilions_100 that is impossible
1333518466494640139 2020-12-01 05:09:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mcilhagger @AnnaEsse statistics about what?
1333518329412247553 2020-12-01 05:08:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jaydarcy7 @azzadinhooooo @sophr08 @SlothenKing @Kushilions_100 we know how old Aisha was - it is reported
1333518201087516672 2020-12-01 05:08:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jaydarcy7 @azzadinhooooo @sophr08 @SlothenKing @Kushilions_100 no one knows how old she was - it is not recorded
1333518085471481859 2020-12-01 05:07:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DescendingA he is not perfect for sure - has made many mistakes - as we all have  We all say stupid things

1333517352391020547 2020-12-01 05:04:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SibthorpeMark @Kushilions_100 I hear this a lot - and it is impossible to prove or disprove  the only way - I think - that we can move past this - is for other people to talk about it - I am sure we all agree the actual grooming cases are disgusting and the attackers must be prosecuted
1333516803901952001 2020-12-01 05:02:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_C_Perera @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective probably
1333516629335035912 2020-12-01 05:01:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Sumz891 @FeedMeWarpstone @Kushilions_100 I have no idea - I do not keep a 24 hour watch on him
1333516384417026048 2020-12-01 05:00:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_C_Perera @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective or rather - can not defend double standards - so try to turn it around  Good bye
1333516213562044419 2020-12-01 05:00:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_C_Perera @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective Pat yourself on the back Shay - you are full of moral superiority
1333516021974642694 2020-12-01 04:59:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SamanthaJBrady1 I am not making a comparison - I am asking a question - what is happening?  I am concerned that our fear of being called racists and calling white people racists is destroying us
1333515670965932032 2020-12-01 04:58:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_C_Perera @garyraikes3 @MatthewRedmond1 funny thing is - when I tweeted about Prince Andrew no one tried to tell me not to
1333515486378811393 2020-12-01 04:57:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @garyraikes3 @S_C_Perera @MatthewRedmond1 There are a number I have in mind   https://t.co/O3D68yF11W
1333515169415237633 2020-12-01 04:56:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DescendingA Like I said I am no expert - obviously a poor choice of words - but he is not asking her out
1333514911637499905 2020-12-01 04:55:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @nine_pound @neilayates @Sherloc43863463 please feel free to post
1333514768125218817 2020-12-01 04:54:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AlanRob72063198 what am I trying to do
1333514534519271427 2020-12-01 04:53:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_C_Perera @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective so I must stop - but they are OK to continue  I think double standards are unacceptable - don't you?
1333514185209212929 2020-12-01 04:52:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @enigma_57 @Kushilions_100 thank you - they did - and we have - as a society / culture  this must change - imo
1333513933827829766 2020-12-01 04:51:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_C_Perera @garyraikes3 @MatthewRedmond1 OK - that is not acceptable  I hope you agree that neither is gang raping an 11 year old white girl - or abusing her, torturing her and in some cases - murdering them
1333513460278288390 2020-12-01 04:49:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_C_Perera @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective what is the right thing to do Shay - her image is used by many mainstream papers - is it OK for them to use - wikipedia has this image (I think)  is it OK for them to use - or just me?
1333512927048048642 2020-12-01 04:47:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DescendingA that does not legit to me - but I am no expert
1333512239085662209 2020-12-01 04:44:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AlanRob72063198 I am not comparing their cases - I am using them to encourage thought about what is happening to our country
1333512047640850434 2020-12-01 04:43:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @garyraikes3 @MatthewRedmond1 can you give me an example of actual racism?
1333511947371884544 2020-12-01 04:43:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @doublegonedod can you recommend any?
1333505413791281153 2020-12-01 04:17:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SimonKelly14 maybe - but for now - I do not think it is
1333505156521062402 2020-12-01 04:16:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SimonKelly14 it is a point of view
1333504724436447234 2020-12-01 04:14:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @solentstars No - I was thinking of another one
1333504590071934977 2020-12-01 04:14:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @leivyon @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective fear of being called racist has allowed this to happen - it is well reported   https://t.co/sgwchTrFgO
1333503861194174464 2020-12-01 04:11:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FeedMeWarpstone @Kushilions_100 and he should face justice - same as anyone
1333503724988362758 2020-12-01 04:10:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AdamPrint3 There were 2 sides to that story
1333503515025694721 2020-12-01 04:09:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FeedMeWarpstone @Kushilions_100 any person who commits any act like this should be put on trial - we should not be afraid of being called racists in doing so
1333503200763195401 2020-12-01 04:08:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Winter8905 @Kushilions_100 No one ever said all muslims - that is your own projection   and we are terrified of calling out criminals - in case we get called racists - which is why Tommy is in this situation
1333502786886103040 2020-12-01 04:06:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @leivyon @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective and yet - fear of being called racist has contributed to this mess - and many people are tweeting that speaking about this is racist   If I wanted to look moral - there are plenty of band wagons I can jump on
1333502358307876868 2020-12-01 04:05:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewRedmond1 there is something rotten within our society / culture - and it is the constant fear and accusations of racism - it is destroying us
1333502079332134915 2020-12-01 04:04:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @teeeaase @FeedMeWarpstone @SlothenKing @Kushilions_100 I suspect there is - if that is the best reply you can come up with
1333501863270952968 2020-12-01 04:03:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @neilayates @Sherloc43863463 obliged - I do not think Tommy is a racist
1333501460039012357 2020-12-01 04:01:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @enigma_57 @Kushilions_100 The point is - we ignored these crime because we are terrified of being called racists - and this is the real problem deep within our culture that needs exposing and discussing
1333501094119559168 2020-12-01 04:00:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Winter8905 @Kushilions_100 no - our shame is that we have become so afraid of being called racists that we are afraid of stopping the gang rape of children and other crimes

1333492531921891334 2020-12-01 03:26:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective it has something to do with our country - what is happening - and that is what I am trying to explore  and our fear of being called racist is part of this problem
1333492215574880257 2020-12-01 03:24:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FeedMeWarpstone @SlothenKing @Kushilions_100 it could be all white girls she is referring to - or girls in general - why is she not being more specific   why do we not know

1333491181678977028 2020-12-01 03:20:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SibthorpeMark @Kushilions_100 because our fear of being called a racist has enabled these case to happen

1333490610804830210 2020-12-01 03:18:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective Today we kindly ask the public to stop using the picture of our Emily from one of her days at school. We hold this picture dear to our hearts and to see it being used in this way is incredibly upsetting
1333490289433059330 2020-12-01 03:17:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dougie_mitch it is a popular view - I have a different one
1333490179588452357 2020-12-01 03:16:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McGeorgeOfTheJ1 agreed - and if we (as a society) talked about these specific cases - then Tommy would not have to  it is our fear of being called racists that has allowed this to happen
1333489938717958144 2020-12-01 03:15:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective read your own article  plea against her image being used as part of counter-protests to the Black Lives Matter movement
1333489699512606721 2020-12-01 03:14:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JimTimberthing it is one side of the story
1333489488102903809 2020-12-01 03:14:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @S_t_Ua_Rt @CowObjective No - because I think these cases need talking about - and in particular our fear of being called a racist for speaking about these crimes   You talk about them - then I will stop   I am sure we all agree they are terrible
1333488996417232900 2020-12-01 03:12:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @rags2richesm8 @Kushilions_100 is it not OK to be white?
1333488897297440769 2020-12-01 03:11:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @rags2richesm8 @Kushilions_100 no one is stopping you - but strangely you seem more concerned about stopping others talking about other forms of abuse
1333488593357201411 2020-12-01 03:10:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exasperatedbee that is the point - we should be treated equally  but fear of being called a racist means we are not
1333488444073533442 2020-12-01 03:09:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @rags2richesm8 @Kushilions_100 no one is stopping you talking about them - feel free

1333486738501750791 2020-12-01 03:03:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exasperatedbee I do care about white people - but it is wrong to say I only care about them   You have no idea
1333486481156034560 2020-12-01 03:02:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LaurenFife27 I totally take your point - this case is in the public domain - and is covered in media   But you make a justified point
1333485898135203841 2020-12-01 02:59:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FreejackFan and me
1333485770309562370 2020-12-01 02:59:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LaurenFife27 I was not comparing the cases - I was highlighting them - to draw attention to what is happening in our country
1333485202165862404 2020-12-01 02:57:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exasperatedbee you asked where to start - I think we are not going to get any where Osmia - can we call it quits and save ourselves the time
1333484240139333634 2020-12-01 02:53:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FreejackFan thick as two short planks

1333483451220111362 2020-12-01 02:50:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JillGore8 our laws are not working - because we have become terrified of being called a racist so will not enforce them

1333482149815742469 2020-12-01 02:44:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exasperatedbee @MrMatth68584062 I have already (and frequently do) admit to focussing on crimes against white people - yes I do  that seems to upset people - I do not understand this because we all agree the crimes are wrong - so i ask all decent people to talk about all crimes - then I wont have to
1333481119665315845 2020-12-01 02:40:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> point taken

1333475957181706243 2020-12-01 02:20:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exasperatedbee @MrMatth68584062 if it's allowed - why are you trying to prevent me talking about it  Please keep reading my tweets - that is what they are there for

1333474810194784263 2020-12-01 02:15:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MrMatth68584062 @exasperatedbee the problem is - that talking about crimes against white people is not allowed because people (like you) say things like peddling division - when all we are doing is talking about serious crimes
1333464777541169156 2020-12-01 01:35:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exasperatedbee @MrMatth68584062 you can't do it can you - it is you who is only concerned with one group of people - not me  stop projecting and look within
1333464432484229120 2020-12-01 01:34:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MrMatth68584062 @exasperatedbee you are right - I do  speak about this a lot - this constant portrayal of white people as racists is a sickness and has allowed serious crimes to go unchallenged - we need to try to find a way of getting through this
1333463984566112258 2020-12-01 01:32:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @exasperatedbee @MrMatth68584062 good - now say the same about those who gang raped white girls
1333463845034143746 2020-12-01 01:32:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RatingsWord @MrMatth68584062 @exasperatedbee you are wrong - that is your projection  are we vilifying all Christians when we speak about abuse in the Church  are we vilifying all BBC staff when we talk about Saville and so on  grow up
1333463529748377602 2020-12-01 01:30:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RatingsWord @exasperatedbee it is our collective fear of being called racists that has allowed these disgusting crime to happen - and you are enabling this   all decent minded people must speak out about all abuse - including the gang rape of white girls
1333463004919320581 2020-12-01 01:28:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WelshCelt yes

1333461100696903682 2020-12-01 01:21:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MrMatth68584062 @exasperatedbee what kind of sick twisted mind thinks talking about the gang rape of a white child is racist - but not the actual rape of that child  this is insanity - you must know this somewhere inside
1333460801815015427 2020-12-01 01:20:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MrMatth68584062 @exasperatedbee I've had many similar discussion like this - and in every case I make the same offer - pass on details of abuse cases to me and I will pass them on - but please do the same for me  Not one of them has taken up the offer
1333460411287547904 2020-12-01 01:18:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MrMatth68584062 @exasperatedbee and yet here you are now   This says more about you than it does me
1333459928539918337 2020-12-01 01:16:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RatingsWord @exasperatedbee then step up and talk about them yourself and stop having a go at those that do

1333382670374547456 2020-11-30 20:09:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> this is anti white racism / hatred disguised as progressive tolerance   call out this language where ever you see it - it would not be accepted about any other ethnic group  WHITE LIVES MATTER
1333381163835068419 2020-11-30 20:03:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LagudV if we need to find allies - which I think we do - then I think we should look for them with similar values - because we have common bonds   Let me ask you  what will we gain by not seeking allies?  and if you think we do need them - where do you think we should look?

1333369571999420417 2020-11-30 19:17:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LagudV I think we should be focussing on our common values - and trying to protect them  I may be wrong - but I think if we do not unite the clans - then we will lose all that we are   This is my own personal view

1333364641892851713 2020-11-30 18:57:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LagudV Interestingly (to me) - I've noticed a growing number of social media reporters ' groups who seem inspired / motivated (in part) by Tommy etc  Some I've been watching recently are - but there are many out there  @SubjectAccesss  Live free (you tube) @HeartsofOakUK
1333363950017253377 2020-11-30 18:55:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LagudV agreed - although I was thinking more of (people like) us uniting in common cause and trying not to let the differences we have separate us   what we share is far more valuable and needed

1333345689372385281 2020-11-30 17:42:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lindammartin25 totally agreed - we saw in Rotherham Fathers were arrested for simply trying to get their under age daughters out of properties with adult men - who were abusing them  This is insane
1333337247794520064 2020-11-30 17:09:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> Every self respecting man - especially Fathers and those with children in the family - should be outraged at the treatment of Tommy Robinson   protecting your child from (possible) sexual assault is not a crime - it is your duty

1333043525026521088 2020-11-29 21:41:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Stusmw52Stuart @Suffragentleman it's that character assassination and consequences which concern me - and why those in the public eye refused to stand up - yet do so now for this teacher at Eton  Is it because they are white working class?

In left-wing circles it is always  felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman
1332795358506754049 2020-11-29 05:15:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> yes we can - it's because they have become paralysed with fear of being called racists - like we all have

1332769269709492225 2020-11-29 03:32:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JonathanNichol4 that was my fear - because this seems to result in only one thing, and it appears to be heading our way

1332721183876395010 2020-11-29 00:21:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> why - because they (we) are paralysed with fear in case we get called racists

1332715904392683522 2020-11-29 00:00:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 agreed - I do not condone that - and those people should be arrested   I have stopped people throwing missiles at Police on a demo - and seen plenty of people stop others  there are idiots everywhere unfortunately
1332715528918618112 2020-11-28 23:58:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 that is not true - I rarely watch the media - and I have been on many demonstrations myself   I try to talk to people with all views and hope I can listen to what they are saying
1332715117591588864 2020-11-28 23:56:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 these are strange and difficult times for all of us - and I hope we are able to get through it in one piece - best of luck to you and your husband - it was not meant personally
1332713422706839553 2020-11-28 23:50:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 agreed - and the Police should treat them all the same - ensure their right to protest is upheld - protect them from attack for doing so - and arrest those who break the law - burn flags or tear down statues etc   Not arrest someone for being there
1332712954836504577 2020-11-28 23:48:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TommyPreziozi we must ensure this does not happen and do all we can to protect their future
1332712345748070402 2020-11-28 23:45:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 we see the Police kneel and run away from BLM - we see them ignore Xtinction Rebellion - we see them turn a blind eye to muslim grooming gangs etc  but we see them heavy handed here   I do not blame your husband - this is not about him - it is about our society and elites
1332711639301361664 2020-11-28 23:43:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 I agree about covid - but this is bigger than that - it is about freedom and politicising Police etc  We have got ourselves into a mess - as a society
1332711142406426626 2020-11-28 23:41:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 I am afraid to talk about these things because people call me racist etc  Like I said - we seem determined to become less tolerant and respectful - it is a shame
1332710303583309831 2020-11-28 23:37:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 @lordealing agreed - I know teachers, paramedics, and many others who have had it - some have died (not sure why)  Covid or tyranny - what would you chose?
1332709916822413315 2020-11-28 23:36:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 @lordealing Most sensible people know covid is bad and want to protect themselves and family - but we also see the erosion of freedom and politicising of police
1332709623296634881 2020-11-28 23:35:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 @lordealing No - the right to protest should be protected - allow them to do so - and I am sure they would have been and gone by now - and far less of them
1332709387803238400 2020-11-28 23:34:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 They have chosen the job Karen - it is not an easy job - they have a vital role   Please do not think we are attacking your husband or you - this is a wider issue about freedom and social breakdown   Our political elites are to blame for this mess
1332708728836149250 2020-11-28 23:31:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 I agree about mutual respect - and I could talk for hours about what I see happening   Tyranny or covid - which is worse?
1332707950352347136 2020-11-28 23:28:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 @lordealing many many people have to work - shop workers for example - teachers   What is more of a risk to us - covid or tyranny?
1332707701835657216 2020-11-28 23:27:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 @lordealing No deaths due to covid in any UK Police force   https://t.co/hngssGoeID

1332705283936821249 2020-11-28 23:17:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 and as a society I think we must try and find a way of working together to get ourselves out of this mess - but increasingly we seem determined to make a mess of it
1332705002129862658 2020-11-28 23:16:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @crazykaren1973 hi Karen - I agree that not all Police took the knee   I feel for them - they have been placed in a very difficult position - and become politicized   But I am very concerned about the erosion of our freedom and descent into tyranny
1332703827162755073 2020-11-28 23:12:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> IT'S GREAT ALL THESE GROUPS AND PEOPLE STANDING UP FOR THE ETON SCHOOL BOYS - BUT REMEMBER - THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT IGNORED THE INJUSTICES TO JAKE HEPPLE AND TOMMY ROBINSON
1332700778864275457 2020-11-28 23:00:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde You can choose your own words Yasmin - you have chosen them   I suspect you realise the words you chose say something about you - which is why you are trying to distance yourself from them
1332700250478440449 2020-11-28 22:57:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde rubbish   I am trying to highlight anti white hatred and fear of being called a racist   Nice bit of deflection at the end  Maybe it is you who is the real racist here
1332699840409636868 2020-11-28 22:56:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde there is no need for any term (imo) - you can call them what you want - I call them white girls
1332699481494724609 2020-11-28 22:54:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde But I have tweeted about Prince Andrew and allegations of rape - strangely - no one called me a racist or tried to deflect
1332699181119664129 2020-11-28 22:53:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde I agree - I do focus on anti white hatred   why - because it is ignored - and I feel it is important to speak out  why is it ignored - because we are terrified of being called racists   as you are demonstrating
1332698328325361666 2020-11-28 22:50:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde No - Tommy Robinson has done more than anyone to bring it to the national consciousness and ensure criminals are convicted and girls are protected
1332698097768689667 2020-11-28 22:49:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde If you want to discuss if gang rape of white girls should be investigated (or not) as a racist hate crime - then I am willing to explore this issue - which was how it started  If not - I think we are finished  Many thanks
1332697606909272067 2020-11-28 22:47:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde as for the police -they were also terrified of being called racists - and still are  It is a disease that has infected our entire society / culture
1332697393461157895 2020-11-28 22:46:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde you say their state of being white - and then accuse me of paranoia
1332697139667931136 2020-11-28 22:45:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde it is telling how often I have discussion like this - that people - like you - try to deflect from the topic - why are muslim gangs gang raping white girls
1332696747810955265 2020-11-28 22:43:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde and it's also interesting - that instead of answering the question and clarifying - you choose to ask me what I think it means
1332696460006215689 2020-11-28 22:42:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde I think it means these girls were white - but what I find interesting is say whiteness instead - almost like you do not want to say white - because then you might have to admit to yourself they are white
1332695483622559748 2020-11-28 22:38:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde what does whiteness mean?
1332694691750572034 2020-11-28 22:35:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde we are talking about muslim gangs gang raping white girls - and exploring if this is in anyway driven by bigotry / prejudice or racial / religious hatred
1332692230679752704 2020-11-28 22:26:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Fox_Claire @ivanhewett Ms Fox - it's nice to see you support these lads from Eton - however it is disappointing that you seem to ignore those from white working class backgrounds such as Jake Hepple and Tommy Robinson  Do you think I am being unfair?
1332690920928649216 2020-11-28 22:20:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrushPercy Hi Percy - totally agreed - I hope to resist this as much as I can
1332688418724306948 2020-11-28 22:10:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Article1066 @fruitypops01 agreed - 1066 and all that  Murdrum - a poem   https://t.co/5u92Ow6cfW
1332685571077120003 2020-11-28 21:59:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> Just because it is a law - does not make it right
1332684991231373313 2020-11-28 21:57:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Tweet1234510 I agree - and for those who do not want to protest - they are free not to  It is a difficult choice to make - my personal view is that tyranny is far more dangerous to us than covid
1332683400352837633 2020-11-28 21:50:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jeff4rugby agreed - but while we are alive - do we simply exist - or do we live?

1332677491820015617 2020-11-28 21:27:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TheRavenous1 @EternalEnglish yep - sums up the western world - petrified of being called or thought of as racist

1332671296778407937 2020-11-28 21:02:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde and I also think if this had happened with the races reversed we would accept that racism played a role in it and the crimes would be treated much differently
1332670931819503616 2020-11-28 21:01:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @yasminwilde Hi Yasmin - there is evidence that (i think) proves that these girls were viewed as less than because they were not muslims and white

1332431888582139905 2020-11-28 05:11:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> How did we ever get to the stage where a Government could say to us - 'IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD' - and get away with doing anything it wants  with the added caveat - 'IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW ORDERS - YOU'LL KILL YOUR GRANNY'
1332428873959608323 2020-11-28 04:59:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LodgeyLane @Fox_Claire Mr street - I take it you have read the poem - I would strongly suggest you take a moment to reflect upon it's meaning and your comments about Tommy   But you wont - it's easier to dismiss and slander those we have been taught to dislike - than think a bit more deeply about them

1332415171218841602 2020-11-28 04:05:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> if the child was white - why is this not treated as a race / hate crime?  why are so many victims white?
1332412331339419649 2020-11-28 03:53:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Fox_Claire and it seems to me - when it is white working class males - no one seems to give a damn  Which reminds me of the Niemoller poem - first they came for Tommy - but I did nothing
1332411968813228033 2020-11-28 03:52:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Fox_Claire Ms Fox - I am sad to say this has been happening for quite some time - I am not sure your claim about women often being the target though - I would like to remind you of people like Tommy Robinson Jake Hepple and others
1332404254141779970 2020-11-28 03:21:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> what a world we have allowed to develop - where hatred and threats are accepted because someone does not like what another person thinks

1331953803743080450 2020-11-26 21:31:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AlexaWhiteBee @janekin24 I had a quick google - I do not know Birmingham so can not say if this route is near the school - will keep looking   https://t.co/f3Xgs4PZFX

1331951409319833600 2020-11-26 21:22:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AlexaWhiteBee totally agreed - I would like to know if there have been attacks, rude comments, or some form of increasing unwanted sexual advances / attention made towards these girls
1331950561378308098 2020-11-26 21:18:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AlexaWhiteBee wow - girls school?  It seems to me there may be something far more sinister going on here

1330556589737193472 2020-11-23 00:59:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Gingersnap_ currently I'm reading 'Bury my heart at wounded knee' - one of the factors was that white people did not see Native Americans as humans - I think something similar is happening here - now  We increasingly see white people as racists first and human second - if we do see them

1329720471621939201 2020-11-20 17:37:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> EITHER - there has been massive voter fraud in USA election  which could potentially destroy democracy - or Trump is lying  You would think the media would be desperate to find out - at least to prove Trump wrong  Their lack of curiosity is telling - they do not want to find out

They usually refer to the use of or threat of violence or harassment towards someone else, in a public place.

1327936540610334722 2020-11-15 19:28:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Saltire49 agreed - and that is another problem - modern media reporting - so often they try to hide what has really happened - especially when reporting on particular groups - or seek to attach blame to others

Have you seen that @LozzaFox has just revealed he has dropped by his agent - for speaking in public

1326973641393836035 2020-11-13 03:42:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LozzaFox There is no hiding place Mr Fox - there is no reasoning with the beast - our culture is infected with a pathological illness that is hell bent on destroying people   It will take enormous will and effort to address this  https://t.co/7vVcILdYSB
1326972626204549122 2020-11-13 03:38:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cliff_grieve that would definitely be a very good place to start from  Much better than ending up there when it's too late

1326971997918728192 2020-11-13 03:35:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> can we just tell the truth about islam

1326966927777034249 2020-11-13 03:15:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Pady_oFurniture @JohnScotting @JamesD_1985 @Fox_Claire @toadmeister You see a fool - I see courage

1326962098706984960 2020-11-13 02:56:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Pady_oFurniture @JohnScotting @JamesD_1985 @Fox_Claire @toadmeister you may be right - or he may have thought no ET would judge him fairly, best to get on with it

1326878049418293248 2020-11-12 21:22:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister so it is about the interpretation not the intention  I guess we just have to ensure whoever is doing the interpreting is well qualified in understanding all the complexities of human behaviour - does such a person exist?  if so - do you know who?

1326616826562883587 2020-11-12 04:04:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog agreed - these incidents follow a very similar pattern - will try to keep an eye out for further info and let you know if anything develops

If we dismiss Jake's testimony at of hand - we erode the same right for all of us

1326587061571362819 2020-11-12 02:06:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister Tommy was one of a very few who spoke out - and get this message into the mainstream - it is our collective failure to discuss this that should be addressed - not his doing so
1326586616551337984 2020-11-12 02:04:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister It is well accepted that grooming gangs were ignored because people were afraid of being called racist etc - cases date back to 1970's - potentially 100's of thousands of girls have been gang raped - tortured, abused - some killed

1326529934995714049 2020-11-11 22:19:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richard06876470 that was exactly what the Natives were saying
1326528809433247744 2020-11-11 22:14:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> and as usual - when pointing the blame at people - we point it at those who are least able to defend themselves  and in our case - it is white working class   we have pronounced them guilty - of racism - we just wait for the opportunity to prove our case

1326526323980898305 2020-11-11 22:04:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister what do you think?  Do you think I am worrying unnecessarily - if so - good  Please tell me why I am wrong - it would be a relief

1326525024233254913 2020-11-11 21:59:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister You may be right - I look at it differently - it is our collective fear to tell the truth about islam - because w are terrified of being called racists - that is sowing confusion   what we see is not tallying with what we are told
1326524670481473537 2020-11-11 21:58:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister Yes - white lives matter led to Jake being sacked   The uproar this caused - the accusations of racism - the smearing of a young white man - led to his dismissal
1326524230754848769 2020-11-11 21:56:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Pady_oFurniture @Fox_Claire @toadmeister Is it understandable?  who decides what is and what is not bad PR - what if it is bad PR - what then - sack them - lose job, possibly lose house?  what is a fair sentence for saying white lives matter?

1326523542364688386 2020-11-11 21:53:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister do you mean - concerned / confused?  Because that is what I get from them - and we have every right to be  And I think calling us - disciples - is an attempt to belittle him / us   I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this - I am very concerned about what I see happening&gt;

1326517358844895233 2020-11-11 21:29:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Pady_oFurniture @Fox_Claire @toadmeister I think you are proving my point John - Jake said white lives matter and is derided, despised - his social media history trolled through and remarks he made when 14 are used against him - both he and his GF are sacked  Priymamada not sacked for saying white lives do not matter
1326516708954222592 2020-11-11 21:26:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Pady_oFurniture @Fox_Claire @JohnScotting @toadmeister the posts you are referring to (if I recall correctly) were made when he was 14
1326516420700725248 2020-11-11 21:25:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister That is one way of looking at it - not how I see it  The quickest and most effective way of destroying free speech in this country is calling people racists / islamophobes etc  it is working a treat
1326515979225010181 2020-11-11 21:23:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister also I think trying to defend Priyamvada saying it as a free speech issue is also slightly pushing it - would we defend people who say kill certain groups of people for example?  or at least condemn what was said - they have the right to say what they want but must be challenged
1326515319817560066 2020-11-11 21:21:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnScotting @Fox_Claire @toadmeister Thanks John - I'm not sure the incidents with Jake and Priyamvada are comparable  - I think you could make a very good case that saying white lives do not matter is hate speech - I do not think you can make a good case white lives do matter is&gt;&gt;
1326370908882280448 2020-11-11 11:47:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Enheduanna16 @Fox_Claire @JohnScotting @toadmeister Not to my knowledge - I think the @SpeechUnion could at least highlight their cases as examples of attacks - and show some support for them in principle - their lack of it is a source of frustration to me
1326282646213767168 2020-11-11 05:56:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Fox_Claire @JohnScotting @toadmeister yes - but where are those fighters who are standing up for free speech when people like Tommy Robinson are thrown in jail and Jake Hepple sacked from his job  too male - pale and working class?
1326276331529703425 2020-11-11 05:31:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ajacquitaylor yes - and Biden couldn't get a sausage - which is why I find it hard to believe he won  But I also find it hard to believe Trump can win from here   I shall just sit back and watch what happens with interest - and try to learn what has taken place
1326273126079082496 2020-11-11 05:18:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ajacquitaylor Do you mean if Trump wins?
1326272936253263872 2020-11-11 05:18:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> I AM OBVIOUSLY MISSING SOMETHING  I do not understand how Trump can win - but -  I do not understand how Biden did so
1326270895254548481 2020-11-11 05:09:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> is it a silver birch?
1326269925447577601 2020-11-11 05:06:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ajacquitaylor and maybe this is the end for democracy?  the media are so manipulative now - it seems impossible to have a fair competition?
1326269512405159936 2020-11-11 05:04:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ajacquitaylor I agree with that - polls and media  But actual voter fraud on an industrial scale?  I do find that difficult to believe - I'm not saying it's not true - it might be - I hope we find out  But I'm not sure it's ever going to be believed by approx 50% of the population?
1326265568866000896 2020-11-11 04:48:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ajacquitaylor I can't make sense of it - does not add up either way  I can not see how Trump can win But I don't know how Biden managed to do so
1326263950154100736 2020-11-11 04:42:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Para_glider69 @BBC agreed - they not only aspired to be him - they have done it - and ensured their candidate for US presidency was elected  a masterful piece of electoral manipulation

1326259676355452929 2020-11-11 04:25:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> The worst thing that could happen is Biden is sworn in and then later found out he did not win due to mass fraud  Although - I think both sides are going to find defeat difficult to accept from this point on
1326259403843137544 2020-11-11 04:24:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> Personally speaking - it seems highly probable that there has been some voter fraud - I do not think it could be enough to vote Trump president - but who knows  we need to find out - for the sake of democracy
1326259072996417538 2020-11-11 04:22:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> The media spent 4 years trying to bring down Trump the media spent months trying to ensure Biden got elected the media are refusing to investigate if there has been any voter fraud / tampering  THE MEDIA IS A DISGRACE  https://t.co/w4fUATW2NH

1325852339144626177 2020-11-10 01:26:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @REP57910897 totally agreed - it is just a case of who gets eaten first
1325823070892863488 2020-11-09 23:30:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DianePannell4 and hope
1325799983421984770 2020-11-09 21:58:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @IAINSTE98128480 @Lilisceptical the last poem in my book is called My base details (borrowed from Sassoon) - it is those politicians, who live in glass houses who are to blame for this mess - while they accuse us of racism for expressing concern about what is happening
1325767933356699648 2020-11-09 19:51:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> each other (apologies - this thread is growing)   I can see the difficulty the Police find themselves in - I do not envy them  But this is their job - their chosen profession   and interaction with the public forms a big part of it - not just arresting people
1325767131850534913 2020-11-09 19:48:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> and yes - I do think the Police have a professional obligation to be polite to members of the public who have not committed any offence   If an offence has been committed - their obligation is to then place them under arrest - but upto that point - they serve us - as we all serve
1325766634854903808 2020-11-09 19:46:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> also I've got to wonder about the total lack of professional handling of this - a veteran is prevented from paying his respects at the war memorial on remembrance Sunday - and is pushed away  They could have been far less dismissive - even polite
1325765355059417088 2020-11-09 19:41:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> And they know they can get away with treating white people like this  Take for example the continued arrests and harassment of Tommy Robinson and others - Piers Corbyn and Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull spring to mind
1325764720008318976 2020-11-09 19:38:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> I was concerned about the Police pushing the Bagpiper on Sunday   But I think it illustrates the problem now find themselves in - they kneel for black groups - ignore islamic groups and shove white ones  THIS IS CULTURAL  THEY WILL BE ACCUSED OF RACISM IF THEY POLICE BME THE SAME  https://t.co/kcNrGApLN0

1325759694535790593 2020-11-09 19:18:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FinanceOptimum @Annrhefn they did not think they would lose - their arrogance and lack of understanding of the 'common man and women' has been totally skewed - they live in glass houses - and we clean their windows
1325759291878465536 2020-11-09 19:17:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Annrhefn @FinanceOptimum that was the reason (I think) people voted for Brexit

1325100491467059201 2020-11-07 23:39:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol @CerieOfficial @Jeb92330539 my answer is this - it is a very good question - I wish I had an answer
1325100003719786496 2020-11-07 23:37:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jeb92330539 @CerieOfficial @Muslim__Patrol you keep saying little - suggesting that it is somehow irrelevant / insignificant?    can you put a number on it - can you quantify this in some way  Khan is a moderate extremist - he has recently called for banning of free speech / cartoons - is that moderate?
1325099518627614720 2020-11-07 23:35:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CerieOfficial @Jeb92330539 @Muslim__Patrol precisely - embrace open enquiry
1325074228333469697 2020-11-07 21:54:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol Has god ever spoken directly to you?

1325070565284208640 2020-11-07 21:40:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> telling the truth about islam might help
1325069359312678912 2020-11-07 21:35:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol God created people to worship him?
1325069195118325760 2020-11-07 21:34:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DollybagLondon spot on Dolly - I totally agree
1325068952968556544 2020-11-07 21:33:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jeb92330539 @CerieOfficial @Muslim__Patrol Is because they are able to hide their dirty little secrets in the dark
1325068811565993989 2020-11-07 21:33:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jeb92330539 @CerieOfficial @Muslim__Patrol yes I am - I would dispute that they are little pockets  I think they form a large part of islam - and I think it is important we talk about these 'pockets'  Same with those other groups (cults) you mentioned - part of the reason they are able to continue &gt;&gt;
1325068319343452166 2020-11-07 21:31:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol and what did he say about is to mohammad
1325034011769659393 2020-11-07 19:15:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol My thoughts are - why are you trying to deflect away from thinking about this
1325033720940728323 2020-11-07 19:13:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol yes - seems a bit strange that HE(?) kept them to himself  Nice to know god is a man
1325032850618454016 2020-11-07 19:10:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol God always existed - and always will  time did not exist - God created time / God created the universe and everything  why did God create these things?
1325032572389384193 2020-11-07 19:09:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dimmersparks If this does come to an end I would like to do something more proactive if I can - not sure what - not sure if it possible  It will be interesting to see where this road goes
1325031952739659776 2020-11-07 19:06:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mintyminje No - just twitter and a dabble with Youtube   I may be over-reacting - but it feels like the end could be coming for me - and If it does - I wanted to express my gratitude to everyone for engaging with me - I have really enjoyed my time on here
1325031462060625922 2020-11-07 19:04:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol and before god there was nothing?
1325031406154768391 2020-11-07 19:04:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Wotadini that is the conundrum - finding what you want to do    One of the things that has become more interesting is god - what is God - I would like to think about that a bit more eventually and explore it
1325030904230797313 2020-11-07 19:02:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol creator of the universe - everything?  sustainer of life?
1325030735980466176 2020-11-07 19:01:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @___MrsR___ It's only if they shut me down - I just wanted to express my thanks while I had the opportunity   I have really enjoyed my time on here
1325030373676511232 2020-11-07 19:00:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Wotadini many thanks - to be honest I would like to do something more proactive - not sure what (or if I have it in me)  It will be interesting to see how this plays out and what awaits
1325029875674177537 2020-11-07 18:58:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @davymaccas agreed - it feels like that is happening - I would like to do something more positive / proactive   I shall see what happens
1325029456847704064 2020-11-07 18:56:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @___MrsR___ thanks Mrs R - I shall give it some thought - to be honest I would like to move on and do something more proactive(?) - but so far all my efforts have not taken off  Mind you - I could be over-reacting
1325028930588446720 2020-11-07 18:54:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> I am optimistic about the human condition - and we have it within ourselves to dig ourselves out of the deepest holes.  Chaos may be coming - and I think we need to be shaken out of our slumber / greed / apathy   We are remarkable creatures - capable of amazing things  https://t.co/dGb24qWS9e
1325028079706775552 2020-11-07 18:51:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> I was on the twitter naughty step for 12 hours - it feels like I am at risk of losing my account - if I do - I just want to thank everyone for engaging - I have learnt so much during my time on here   and although I am quite pessimistic about the state of the world right now&gt;&gt;
1325025178385002497 2020-11-07 18:39:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> is it racist to have pride in someone just because they share the same skin tone as yourself  or do black / brown people get a free pass  if they get a free pass - but represent people of all skin colours etc - are they fit to do the job - can they be trusted?

1324658146296668161 2020-11-06 18:21:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Commonwealth_GB agreed
1324657551699574784 2020-11-06 18:19:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Haf_025 @Muslim__Patrol and you
1324657359151599616 2020-11-06 18:18:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol How did you get it?
1324657077344784384 2020-11-06 18:17:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Haf_025 @Muslim__Patrol Goodbye - pleasure talking to you
1324656748058345473 2020-11-06 18:15:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol and yet you constantly refuse to tell us the truth about islam
1324656406063099904 2020-11-06 18:14:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Commonwealth_GB yes - how long will it take before they are closed down and all arrested for hate speech / offence etc etc etc?
1324656146247012352 2020-11-06 18:13:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol You are making the argument that islam is the correct path  Freedom - that is a very deep question - and layered - however - if there is a threat attached I would suggest that freedom is eroded  Fear is a great motivator
1324654041226465281 2020-11-06 18:05:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> would you mind telling @ImranKhanPTI - he is seeking to stop it

1324652707282591749 2020-11-06 17:59:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> what about down at the local mosque?

1324643472385679361 2020-11-06 17:23:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol Fear - good choice of words  Should I be right to be afraid?  Should Lee Rigby have been afraid? Should Samuel Paty have been afraid?
1324643106822754304 2020-11-06 17:21:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol more deflection - you have nothing
1324642572334206977 2020-11-06 17:19:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol CONVERT OR DIE! convert please ARE YOU DOING THAT OF YOUR OWN FREE WILL? errrrrrrrrr - yeeeeesssssssssss? GOOD - GO IN PEACE BROTHER   another peaceful convert using his freedom to accept islam
1324642137997193224 2020-11-06 17:17:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol I totally agree - that is where we (as individuals - cognitive free thinking humans) can use our minds to take a good hard look at what is being said to us  Let's take a good hard look at islam
1324641542183727104 2020-11-06 17:15:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol convert or die is quite an incentive  Fear has a very good habit of persuading people to do as one wants - there are many examples of fear infecting groups - large and small - national and local  From Hitler, Stalin, Mao and mohammad - to Jones, Bin Laden and many many others
1324640529812983808 2020-11-06 17:11:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @conservmillen @Dweezilboy I agree - but what I do not understand is why it is not being proven
1324638629344497665 2020-11-06 17:03:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CConcern @MichaelNazirAli @spectator and to do so - it needs to find a way to deal with the constant continuous accusations of racism

1324634214738911232 2020-11-06 16:46:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol You believe Islam is true - because that is what you have been told - and to question that belief would put you in severe risk
1324633860609613824 2020-11-06 16:44:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol I had a friend - his Dad told him sausages came from Whales (the fish) - he believed him (you would believe your Dad - wouldn't you)  At school they were having sausages - do you know they are made from Whales he said - you can imagine the outcome of the story
1324630049866350592 2020-11-06 16:29:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol you have the opportunity to tell me all about it  But you don't - smears, deflection, insults etc etc  just the same old excuses - because you know - once we take a close look at islam all there is is hate and violence

1324461720077815809 2020-11-06 05:20:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol @P_A_T_R_I_O_T_1 still got nothing to say about islam
1324460045535481857 2020-11-06 05:14:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol @P_A_T_R_I_O_T_1 Nothing - you've got nothing
1324323045125836800 2020-11-05 20:09:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen we thought people in the media / news were critically thinking about all these things that are happening in the world - it turned out - you were not  what is worse - they may have been deliberately indoctrinating us  - so I will try
1324322170022014976 2020-11-05 20:06:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen here is another example - islam  what is it - what is it doing - what does it want  and where will this lead  https://t.co/LdN5UjGA67
1324321353424666627 2020-11-05 20:03:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen that seems to be the role of the media (self appointed) - to create images, point fingers, dismiss differing opinions   Rather than look deeply at what is happening around us
1324320632687964160 2020-11-05 20:00:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen I thought it interesting that you did not reply what was terrifying you   the people themselves - or the reason - or something else  But I suspect you are not interested in explaining - that might reveal something
1324319603812696066 2020-11-05 19:56:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen Thanks Matthew - I will try to do so

1324317955195371522 2020-11-05 19:49:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RedSquirrelsYo wow - I hope so my friend - I hope so
1324317740853792769 2020-11-05 19:48:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen and yet the media has been actively smearing and attacking Trump - and Brexit for years  So if anyone is brainwashed - seems much more likely it would be those who vote Biden and remain (for example)  But maybe you know that - maybe - you are part of the brainwashing
1324317407490527234 2020-11-05 19:47:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen and your conclusion is they are terrifying?  I know you did not call them terrifying - but it seems you are implying it - or something similar - conjuring a negative image of them  or maybe you think they have all been brainwashed?  and that is terrifying?
1324314687174049792 2020-11-05 19:36:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol @P_A_T_R_I_O_T_1 where have I heard that before?  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

1324312482807189505 2020-11-05 19:27:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Fox_Claire Possibly the biggest threat to democracy is the media - and politicians - who for years have been smearing / insulting and abusing Trump, Brexit and others  It has incited violence and intolerance - and this has gone unchallenged   Democracy is breaking down
1324311888562442241 2020-11-05 19:25:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Fox_Claire Ms Fox - democracy is under attack (either way) - once the trust has gone - then what?
1324310923088142336 2020-11-05 19:21:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> it would have been racist to think he might kill people
1324308595761156097 2020-11-05 19:12:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> tell us about the ethnic cleansing in places like Tower Hamlets etc
1324307915751235586 2020-11-05 19:09:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RedSquirrelsYo is it enough? - Biden just needs a few more  It's not over until the proverbial sings - but she is definitely warming up her vocals
1324305977475289089 2020-11-05 19:02:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> and now we are seeing this mental tyranny extend to our physical selves - our movements - what we can do - where we can go - who we can see - are all being ERODED  AND OUR DEMOCRACY IS BREAKING DOWN
1324305658590732288 2020-11-05 19:00:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> THERE IS TYRANNY OF OUR MINDS  we are told what to think - but more importantly we are told WHAT NOT TO THINK - under threat of assault, job loss, homelessness - prosecution  accusations of RACISM etc - PREVENT us from THINKING OPENLY AND HONESTLY  and it works

1324304589617848320 2020-11-05 18:56:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EternalEnglish so much contained in such simplicity - deep  Or maybe lonely?
1324304040415711232 2020-11-05 18:54:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol @P_A_T_R_I_O_T_1 Like I said - feel free to tell us the truth about islam  But you wont - you will blame, accuse, deceive, smear and slander   you have nothing

1324296706352173056 2020-11-05 18:25:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EternalEnglish maybe not being able to touch it - enhanced your appreciation of it?  many thanks to you sir - it was excellently made and narrated
1324296400017018880 2020-11-05 18:24:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EternalEnglish It struck a chord with me - especially the part where you could not reach it - prevented to by ownership of the land around it - something you had admired and appreciated for years - yet just out of reach
1324282280534253569 2020-11-05 17:27:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> When you walk into a storm - KEEP GOING When you fall on your face - GET UP - KEEP GOING When you are tired and want rest - KEEP GOING When you are knocked over or tripped up - KEEP GOING  NEVER GIVE UP - KEEP GOING
1324281236022505472 2020-11-05 17:23:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EternalEnglish brilliant - so much in there - simply brilliant

1324273952827625472 2020-11-05 16:54:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RedSquirrelsYo The Rev - I suspect there has been some fraud - I guess the question is - has it been enough to alter the outcome  But it is another blow to the concept of democracy - which appears to be weakening

1324270491754995713 2020-11-05 16:41:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> Shame we're not interested in a fight against islamic supremacy - but that would be racist  ask not what your country can do but what it can give to everyone else (preferably not white)
1324268049168502784 2020-11-05 16:31:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> The WINNERS of the US election are the media - the elites - for years they have been smearing Trump   CONGRATULATIONS - YOU DID A HELL OF A JOB
1324266282053677056 2020-11-05 16:24:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog @YouTube definitely doing a bad impression of a Police Officer
1324265548289581056 2020-11-05 16:21:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> Seems America is tired of rioting and looting - and voted for free stuff instead
1324265231867138048 2020-11-05 16:20:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol @P_A_T_R_I_O_T_1 quite right
1324265140540350471 2020-11-05 16:19:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Muslim__Patrol feel free to tell us - although you will deny, deflect, blame, accuse and slander  https://t.co/WEJXIxA5Vn

1324018764543893505 2020-11-05 00:00:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smiffymaid @rightsforresid2 totally agreed - what laws have been broken here?
1324016442501697543 2020-11-04 23:51:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @rightsforresid2 @WeeFatShug following orders is not an excuse
1323957969747353605 2020-11-04 19:59:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RealMickFoley it would help (us all) if we stopped calling people racists and tried to actually listen to them
1323954760278560771 2020-11-04 19:46:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> Try listening to what they are saying - rather than discounting them - it might help you
1323948413415837696 2020-11-04 19:21:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> The fear in this childs voice should be a wake up call to every decent person in this country - gang rape, abuse, threats and torture of a child is an act of incredible evil and must never be ignored again - ever

1323917744748843008 2020-11-04 17:19:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MatthewStadlen maybe try listening to them  maybe try understanding them maybe trying walking in their shoes  BUT FOR GODS SAKE - STOP BLOODY DISPARAGING THEM

1323752304063975425 2020-11-04 06:21:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DJStevoz you mean voter fraud?
1323751616244289537 2020-11-04 06:19:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> I've never been as interested in an American election as I am today - I actually think this vote is for the heart and soul of the western world and if Biden wins it will be sold to the devil  God bless America God bless Donald Trump  https://t.co/O075uI4zaH

I could go on - and on - and on
1323736885546622976 2020-11-04 05:20:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DMcWilliams_UK @PauljePaul But also look at what islamic leaders are saying   https://t.co/bmRRRGcPAn

1323735159531802624 2020-11-04 05:13:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DMcWilliams_UK @PauljePaul also we can look at their actions - I did not see any muslims protest about the murders of Samuel Paty and the others - but I did see them protest about islamophobia after them  same when Charlie Hebdo massacre took place
1323734829297553413 2020-11-04 05:12:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DMcWilliams_UK @PauljePaul since the silent majority are silent - we will never know what they are thinking - but surveys have shown growing support for sharia  Nearly a quarter (23%) supported the introduction of sharia law in some areas of Britain   https://t.co/7XwycK88or

1323282229619994625 2020-11-02 23:14:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Arashinii @manyshovels @JohnCleese You are blinded with your own dislike of him Simon
1323282086674006022 2020-11-02 23:13:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SleepySaff @JohnCleese what are you missing - why are people voting for him  You are so blind with your own dislike of him
1323281080414281728 2020-11-02 23:09:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 Not sure that is true   I think if we fight for ourselves - we can achieve something
1323191647673470976 2020-11-02 17:14:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> Upper middle class Vicky Pollard speaks   yeah but no - but yeah - but no
1323189474319388676 2020-11-02 17:05:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Arashinii @manyshovels @JohnCleese we are going to go round in circles - and bore the pants off each other  and I felt people like Mr Cleese were able to offer a different perspective on all of this stuff - which was the point of my tweet
1323188019701141504 2020-11-02 16:59:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SleepySaff @JohnCleese then you are missing something - and that is the reason why he was elected - and I think he will be again - maybe we can continue this after the election?
1323186820109271040 2020-11-02 16:54:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SleepySaff @JohnCleese very good question - that was what I was hoping for - something different from Mr Cleese - rather than the usual smears and insult about him
1323185900541665280 2020-11-02 16:51:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dukeluke @SleepySaff @JohnCleese I suspect he will not get your vote
1323185743414571008 2020-11-02 16:50:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 More deflection - you can tell me about islam at any point - just tell me the truth - the whole truth
1323185422776832007 2020-11-02 16:49:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 I am asking a lot of you - it is upto you if do or not  But until people like you do so - then we will continue on this merry go round - and it will get faster and faster - and become more and more unpleasant
1323185129699889154 2020-11-02 16:48:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 this is deflection - very good deflection because you are right - there are other factors involved  But when examining islam - we must focus on islam  You are doing everything you can to avoid doing so - it can not be easy for you to do it - it is your belief system&gt;&gt;
1323184253488824320 2020-11-02 16:44:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @docbison @JohnCleese Moi?
1323184196345614336 2020-11-02 16:44:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 and now you are mocking - see how it works?  Look within my friend - I get the feeling you want to - but are afraid to do so  Take courage - all our answers lie within
1323183400522551296 2020-11-02 16:41:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 so you blame others (for your own sins) - you deflect and then you run away (when the truth is getting too close)  Open your heart to what is within you
1323183093876957186 2020-11-02 16:40:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 you stop because you know the answer to your questions begins within you - and that is where you do not want to look - because you probably know the answer - and it is that these things are happening because of islam in some way
1323181860319612928 2020-11-02 16:35:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 IS it OK to hate the KKK? is it OK to hate Hitler? is it OK to hate Stalin?  is it wrong to hate Islam?  These all employ the same tactics - blame others for their own failings
1323181521554051074 2020-11-02 16:33:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 Cartoons are not driven by hate - they are driven by a desire to mock and laugh at our selves - at the world around us  You are proving my point for me - saying that - justifying / excusing the beheading of Charlie Hebdo workers etc  Take a look at islam - take a long hard look
1323180377016537088 2020-11-02 16:29:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 Deflection - deal with the islam issue  You know - as I do - that the KKK and Hitler have been rejected and discredited  I hope the same process happens to islam - but it starts with telling the truth about it - and not deflecting away from it
1323179930251939840 2020-11-02 16:27:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 If you - and your fellow muslims - spent as much time asking why are these things being done by other muslims - instead of saying things like that (hate etc) - we probably would not be in this mess
1323179649631985666 2020-11-02 16:26:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 it is not hate to want to know why teachers, priests, worshippers, cartoonists and citizens are being beheaded  it is not hate to want to know why Churches are being burned down  It is not hate to want to know what islam is all about
1323179184949178368 2020-11-02 16:24:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @manyshovels @JohnCleese I was hoping for something a bit deeper from Mr Cleese
1323175737768189956 2020-11-02 16:10:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JGBartholomew @elmcroft France is facing serious threat from islam - while I also applaud his comments - it is his actions in addressing this that will matter  Bold words will count for nothing
1323172109602955264 2020-11-02 15:56:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SleepySaff @JohnCleese point taken - I do not  I thought John was able to think deeper that that - I may have been wrong - but I don't think I am
1323171576611831808 2020-11-02 15:54:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @manyshovels @JohnCleese I've read his books - watched his training videos - seen his debates - he was a very thoughtful person   https://t.co/D6m4VyMF42
1323171092618498048 2020-11-02 15:52:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SleepySaff @JohnCleese Hi Moose - I think I would like him to think a bit more before he says something   And ask himself if it is true
1323170218525577216 2020-11-02 15:48:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Laughoutloud9b Totally agree with you - he has been released without charge
1323169768451543040 2020-11-02 15:47:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> MORE CHURCHES ARE BURNING - THIS TIME - IN CANADA   https://t.co/GLq1Req7iX
1323168570394710021 2020-11-02 15:42:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnCleese Mr Cleese - you are beginning to sound like Joe Biden   You used to be a very thoughtful man - come on son - you can do better than this
1323167788521971713 2020-11-02 15:39:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> Thank you for your reasoned reporting of Tommy Robinson - this is the first time I have seen this done by a mainstream outlet  I am heartened by it
1323166991847464962 2020-11-02 15:36:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ElfieGoldbergi1 Release the propaganda Indoctrinate the young Don't want free thinkers here there is a mindset to be won
1323165750668988416 2020-11-02 15:31:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LordBarnbrook @metpoliceuk the same thing that has happened to our entire society / culture - paralysed with fear in case we are called racists etc
1323164734342967303 2020-11-02 15:27:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 and if you do - I would be very interested in what you discover  Until then I suspect we are going to go round in circles
1323164503492669441 2020-11-02 15:26:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 and is now very very difficult to challenge  You have exposed your own anti white prejudice - then when confronted with that - you justified it  I would encourage you to look within yourself for why you think like this - to really put that belief to the test&gt;&gt;
1323163884635770880 2020-11-02 15:23:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 The problem is - the indoctrination is so deep (within our subconscious) and so effective (clever / manipulative) that when we speak out about those things - people yell out racist  It has become a self fulfilling prophecy  &gt;&gt;
1323163500047437824 2020-11-02 15:22:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 My point is - we (our society / culture) have been indoctrinated to think white people are racists - that we are the problem   This indoctrination has meant we are constantly accused of racism when we legitimately object to children being gang raped and women beheaded (etc)&gt;&gt;
1323162663455776768 2020-11-02 15:18:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HeslepJeff Thank you Jeff - islam is quite open and clear about what it wants and how it is going to get to get - it is telling us  we have got to start listening
1323041915709857792 2020-11-02 07:19:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 you are proving my point for me
1323041774126989312 2020-11-02 07:18:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 what makes me assume - just a wild guess  https://t.co/KxysZCrFjK
1323041406219411457 2020-11-02 07:17:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 if you had said this about any other ethnic group you would have been called a racist - you would not say it about any other ethnic group
1323041059195244545 2020-11-02 07:15:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 'Yup. I think a lot of White people ARE racist AND without critcal thought or reasonable debate'
1323040878366261249 2020-11-02 07:15:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 You may not believe this - But I was of similar mind - I thought white people were racists and all other groups were victims of white racism - I thought very long and hard about this - Geronimo is my attempt to unravel some of it
1323040388383473668 2020-11-02 07:13:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 I challenge your assertion that it is tiny - but for now I must retire  But in reality the number is not as important as the reasons and impact   I hope you can begin to look at your anti white prejudice - and move on from it
1323039773460733952 2020-11-02 07:10:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 it is your prejudice and bigotry that has been exposed - it is upto you what you do with it - do you hold onto it - or do you let it go  this is cultural - we have been indoctrinated to think like that - but we can move on - I have been on that journey
1323038629678252035 2020-11-02 07:06:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 No one has ever said that - that is your projection   It is not wrong to question any ideology - fascism / communism / Christianity / Scientology - any  it is not wrong to question islam  we must tell the truth about islam - the whole truth - warts and all
1323035044454256642 2020-11-02 06:51:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BlockedByLeftys @DickieWickieWoo @IAmTommy1990 we - as in society / culture in general  we have been indoctrinated to believe white people are inherently racists and this has hampered our critical thinking of islam etc
1323034634326781957 2020-11-02 06:50:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BlockedByLeftys @DickieWickieWoo @IAmTommy1990 totally agreed - it is not islamophobic or racist to want to expose an ideology that is seeking to kill. rape and create a climate of fear so it can expand and dominate  It is moral cowardice to not do so - and we are cowards because we are afraid of being called racists etc
1323032455654367232 2020-11-02 06:41:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @BlockedByLeftys @IAmTommy1990 toxic and divisive?  why is it toxic to say gang raping children is wrong? why is it divisive to ask if islam is really about peace?  the toxicity and division is not Tommys doing - it is islam's  we must stop blaming ourselves for the failings of islam
1323024364627873792 2020-11-02 06:09:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @IAmTommy1990 @BlockedByLeftys it is sad to see that within those 8 years things have got worse for Tommy - he has contributed so much and risked so much to raise awareness about islam / terrorism and grooming gangs and this is how we treat him - I think it is a disgrace
1323023911068536832 2020-11-02 06:07:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @IAmTommy1990 @BlockedByLeftys appreciated - I think it's something about him - he is struggling with something internally - and to avoid looking within - points the finger out
1323022717768138752 2020-11-02 06:02:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @IAmTommy1990 @BlockedByLeftys and yet you felt compelled to belittle it - pass judgement upon something that you had to find yourself  hmmmmm - I get the distinct impression you are hiding - from yourself
1323021456301805570 2020-11-02 05:57:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @IAmTommy1990 @BlockedByLeftys Then I apologise to you - It is a wish of mine that I could express myself better - It is a work in progress  But I suspect you understand the point I am making - which speaks to you - so you focus on how it is said - rather than what is said
1323018535556231171 2020-11-02 05:46:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @NicciStevens77 awesome
1323016445018755078 2020-11-02 05:37:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @IAmTommy1990 @BlockedByLeftys A tribute to Tommy Robinson I wrote in 2012   https://t.co/ucMCOzRUyH
1323013543604768769 2020-11-02 05:26:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Suttonboy1 @DaveLarkhall you have not seen the housing of asylum seekers at the barracks there?
1323013264742166528 2020-11-02 05:25:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Suttonboy1 @bretenwalda I agree - we did not pay a price for this freedom - we just inherited it  which is why we do not value it and are allowing it to slip away (which is the point of my poem)  now we must decide - do we defend it - or lose it
1323012470072631297 2020-11-02 05:22:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DaveLarkhall I' with you Dave - we must do all we can to resist
1323011838896967680 2020-11-02 05:19:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Suttonboy1 @bretenwalda I am a Freeborn English man - they are Freeborn Sikh's, Indians and Jamaicans etc  I think the words you are objecting to are English man - if it had said Sikh man you probably would not have become triggered
1323002364534599682 2020-11-02 04:41:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Peter56686043 No worries Peter - anytime you feel like exchanging thoughts please feel free   Amen brother
1322997235450318850 2020-11-02 04:21:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Peter56686043 but I get the impression you are not interested in enlightening me - you seem determined to slander / smear me - you have formed an opinion of me - and will seek to reinforce it - because it fits with your world view - and you will not put that to the test
1322996647555665922 2020-11-02 04:19:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Peter56686043 it is definitely possible
1322996476520398848 2020-11-02 04:18:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 the question is not how many have tried - it is how many want to - how many will want to - and why
1322996110550568960 2020-11-02 04:17:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 @DickieWickieWoo agreed - but we did keep voting for the people who were doing it to us   I agree we were lied to / deceived and manipulated   and when I say we - I think out political / social and cultural leaders are the real cause
1322995648547966976 2020-11-02 04:15:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @glennseaward11 agreed
1322993069202001920 2020-11-02 04:05:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls they do not understand - they have no real grasp on the severity of it - or are afraid to think about it
1322992808253366276 2020-11-02 04:04:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 @DickieWickieWoo I am not sure about the numbers - I have heard the arguments - I am yet to be convinced by them - but I agree they have contributed - as have others - but ultimately mu working conclusion is this is self inflicted
1322992450147897348 2020-11-02 04:02:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls agreed - but we do  we are terrified of it - terrified of being called racists / islamophobic etc etc  It is destroying us
1322992093258723328 2020-11-02 04:01:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls yes they do - and their number is growing - while ours is falling
1322991952623734791 2020-11-02 04:00:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo wow - there you have it  I am trying to explain my concerns about islam - and you see that as me disliking people because of the colour of their skin  That is the problem sir - it is your prejudice on show - not mine
1322991569818079233 2020-11-02 03:59:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls we are now so afraid of being called racists that we turn a blind eye
1322991404835065856 2020-11-02 03:58:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls I am not sure they are ours - I do not think they are working in our interests - I think they are working in theirs
1322990572014080009 2020-11-02 03:55:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls are they our politicans - or islam's?
1322990389125697540 2020-11-02 03:54:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Peter56686043 enlighten me Peter
1322990276558888962 2020-11-02 03:53:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo then I would strongly suggest you take a very (very) hard look at islam - while you can - while we can make choices  Because when we get to the point where we can not - it will be too bloody late - and increasingly - I think that moment is closer than we realise
1322989768502845441 2020-11-02 03:51:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls It may have already reformed - some say Wahhabism (Saudi Islam) was the islamic version of the reformation - going back to the text - and in this case - it becomes more violent?
1322989475908243465 2020-11-02 03:50:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 @DickieWickieWoo I disagree with you on this   I accept that some Jews did influence the ideas - as did many Christians / atheists
1322989085699559424 2020-11-02 03:49:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 @DickieWickieWoo I still think that is a red herring - and the problem is within ourselves
1322988938533822464 2020-11-02 03:48:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 maybe - I think we need to offer something for the general public   show them we are right - that we have something meaningful
1322988596564054018 2020-11-02 03:47:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo No - you are being misleading - you can believe in all parts of the bible - and you will find Jesus is the answer   as is mohammad
1322987872849432578 2020-11-02 03:44:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @smuttyprof @WineFromSkulls I disagree - how do we know who is moderate?  what does being a moderate muslim mean?  I think we need to be honest about islam - tell the truth about it - the whole truth - warts and all
1322987511354970113 2020-11-02 03:42:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 @DickieWickieWoo small hats?  I think we did this to ourselves my friend - for possible noble reasons - but like all good intentions - they pave the path to ruin
1322987113449750536 2020-11-02 03:41:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @reality35291058 ask your God
1322986996160208897 2020-11-02 03:40:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 I agree about the right to exist - and we need to find a way of expressing that so people can relate to it better  and I think we need to find a way of accepting that some people like Israel - although like all countries it is not perfect
1322986483100377090 2020-11-02 03:38:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo @DontDareSay yes - Naz Shah gave  a speech in Parliament about how great Islam is for women - days after it had beheaded a 60 year old women and stabbed another to death  Islam in action

1322986099694850049 2020-11-02 03:37:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo you are comparing the wrong bit of the bible - our culture is derived from new testament - Jesus is our role model - our archetype  The comparison is not between OT and islam  it is between Jesus and mohammad
1322985377507004420 2020-11-02 03:34:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DontDareSay @DickieWickieWoo they do not want to upset their voters
1322985274004176897 2020-11-02 03:34:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 @DickieWickieWoo agreed - cultural marxism?  But in its own right it is poisonous as well
1322985011851743235 2020-11-02 03:33:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Norddivision1 I do not know where this gets us  Civic nats v ethnic nats  I think if we do not find someway of coming together we will have nothing - first we must save our nation / our nationality - before we can worry about whom it belongs to
1322984184680468480 2020-11-02 03:29:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DickieWickieWoo You are talking absolute rubbish - the problem is islam - what is it teaching - what is it expecting / demanding / encouraging its followers to do

Does not appear as though they searched him   He has been persecuted again by our Police services
1322969960981975041 2020-11-02 02:33:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @catster6 @REP57910897 it is under serious attack (imo) - I think we need to do all we can to defend it

1322968967980470273 2020-11-02 02:29:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @REP57910897 @metpoliceuk at the time people told me he was arrested for carrying an offensive weapon - this obviously seemed like a bogus charge - reading the reports - it seems he was arrested for breaking COvid regs

1322965762508759040 2020-11-02 02:16:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Ana00777773 yes - but some religions also ask their followers to not do that - while others command they do  Islam commands, expects, asks its followers to do so - and we must be honest about this - or at least examine it - find out what it is asking its followers to do
1322795580469530624 2020-11-01 15:00:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> I hate to say it - but because this women is black - people might actually start to talk about islamic murders a bit more now
1322795305063059458 2020-11-01 14:59:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> It's islamophobic to object to beheading 60 year old women - killing priests - gang raping children - destroying cultures
1322792011330715648 2020-11-01 14:46:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AmyMek They burn down Churches They behead and kill priests They behead and kill parishioners

1322196217544249348 2020-10-30 23:18:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Sunlitforests It is the trend - the pattern that concerns me   the erosion of history - the replacement of our people - the anti white bigotry, prejudice and hatred that is common place
1322195839528427523 2020-10-30 23:17:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Sunlitforests 1 - I have no idea - I have talked to many people over the years - including you 2 - I think trying to shine a light in the dark is useful and kind  Ps -it is best if people take their own advice before giving it

1321886765888712711 2020-10-30 02:48:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xTrendyBurdx it is heartbreaking to see such our countries turn into places where we are becoming less and less welcome, more and more despised and increasingly at risk of being killed because we are the wrong colour and faith
1321884767160307712 2020-10-30 02:41:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xTrendyBurdx Hi Dee - totally agreed - we are in big trouble - and France is facing real pressure to submit to islam - I am very concerned about what is happening there
1321883969282101248 2020-10-30 02:37:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> France is finished if it can not tell the truth about islam

1321853139650334721 2020-10-30 00:35:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Nuhayyy More deflection - more deceit  Islam is a philosophy of murder, blame, deceit and deflection
1321852886767337473 2020-10-30 00:34:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @t3umaes12 @RulesElsa submission to a god who allows heads to be cut off - that is the real meaning

1321852520491343873 2020-10-30 00:32:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @t3umaes12 Yelling allah akbar (god is greatest) while cutting off the head of a non believer   more deceit - more deflection   Islam is a barbaric death cult
1321852126369337344 2020-10-30 00:31:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @shinryujinswife @t3umaes12 It means submission to a god who permits beheadings so people will worship through fear  It is a murderous ideology
1321851805488369666 2020-10-30 00:30:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> and here it is - how Lineker sees himself and how he see the rest of us
1321851652429799424 2020-10-30 00:29:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @t3umaes12 Islam is a religion of terrorism and murder - it creates fear, confusion and intolerance  It must be exposed for what it is - you have no respect -just more deceit
1321850882087071744 2020-10-30 00:26:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Reprobate24 care to explain Tom?
1321850675022729216 2020-10-30 00:25:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @t3umaes12 Islam means submission  and it knows how to get it - kill people and then paint itself as the victim to avoid scrutiny   Islam is a master of deceit
1321850364291960832 2020-10-30 00:24:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Nuhayyy and if so many Muslims were speaking out about these killings (and gang rape of children) then why in Gods name are they always happening   Islam is religion of terror and suppression
1321850115016065029 2020-10-30 00:23:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Nuhayyy you do not need 2 billion to kill - you need one person on a regular basis to cut some ones head off - and other 1.9999 billion to yell islamophobia when we speak out about it
1321849438105669632 2020-10-30 00:20:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> Your failure to tell the truth about islam and what it is doing is part of the reason why this is happening - moral cowardice in pursuit of virtue signalling by those in positions of power has allowed islam a free ride
1321848394013462528 2020-10-30 00:16:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF MURDER

1321847863782133760 2020-10-30 00:14:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @40_John_Doe agreed - they have sensed a weakness in France and are exploiting it for all they can - while inciting muslims to kill and behead French citizens

1321847029325307909 2020-10-30 00:11:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EdmundEngland it is heartbreaking - the words of Enoch Powell are ringing in my ears - why are we doing this to ourselves - how did we get to hate ourselves so much?
1321845731196633088 2020-10-30 00:05:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> tell the truth about islam - it was designed to kill, inflict terror and force submission  that is its purpose
1321841922877591553 2020-10-29 23:50:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog 14 years ago - and things have got worse since then - much much worse - in all respects  the last man is bringing on the last times
1321819236562587650 2020-10-29 22:20:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog agreed - a perfect storm
1321816211991257088 2020-10-29 22:08:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> tell the truth about islam - it is doing what it has always done - because that is its purpose
1321815528718172160 2020-10-29 22:05:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> we are with you Marine Le Pen - France is the light - she must not allow herself to be put out
1321812234083930113 2020-10-29 21:52:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog I suspect these laws were written before we had growing islamic populations and the consequences of such  Maybe someone needs to challenge this law - and put islam firmly under the microscope
1321811694902038528 2020-10-29 21:50:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> tell the truth about islam - our fear of doing so has enabled this evil to grow and more lives have been lost as a result - we can no longer remain cowards in the face of such evil
1321809088469176322 2020-10-29 21:40:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Gingersnap_ They did - they have strayed (as we all have) and they are paying the heaviest price - we will follow  France is under attack - she must be saved
1321808512188665857 2020-10-29 21:38:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT ISLAM  your refusal and cowardice to do so has contributed to this because it has enabled evil to grow
1321808103730536450 2020-10-29 21:36:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> DEAR GOD - PLEASE COME TO THE AID OF FRANCE, HELP HER DEAL WITH THE EVIL WITHIN  I ASK THIS IN JESUS NAME - AMEN  https://t.co/ROJwNfxNO9
1321807054449893379 2020-10-29 21:32:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AnnMort92883429 @Archet65 @LadBonnie it is our turn to put up a fight
1321806887105548289 2020-10-29 21:31:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog I wonder what they would do (police / polticians etc) when faced with a complaint that the koran (islam) is inciting hatred - probably arrest the complainant for stirring up racial hatred
1321806396141248515 2020-10-29 21:29:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Archet65 @LadBonnie for us
1321805512409817088 2020-10-29 21:26:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Grumpykatzi stirring up hatred is a national pass time - those who are good at it get promoted to the top jobs - so it can be done more
1321571253904355328 2020-10-29 05:55:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> excellent idea - why don't you start at every mosque where they stir up hatred and close them down
1321570719025737729 2020-10-29 05:53:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @prwhittle @ShortfuseLiz Nope
1321568502390640642 2020-10-29 05:44:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Whetstonesdp agreed - as far as I know - not one has faced any investigation

1321164146956750848 2020-10-28 02:57:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PhilHornsby1 &lt;&lt;and because our leaders are repeating the same dogma (white people are racists) there is no need for any effort   so it is coming from the ground up - and they are just called racists and ignored or persecuted - so the pattern repeats

1321126077809545224 2020-10-28 00:26:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ed_called @julianmamdrake totally agreed - islam exploits our lack of knowledge and understanding for its own advantage

1320319784475570177 2020-10-25 19:02:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @procyor I am saddened to hear that - somehow our culture has embraced abortion - it has almost become a virtue to do so
1320318480147714048 2020-10-25 18:57:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> and that is the point I am trying (clumsily) to make - it seems abortion is almost a positive - unless the child is different?  Once again - apologies for language - what words should I be using
1320317933445390337 2020-10-25 18:55:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> I apologies for any insensitive language used on my part - I do not mean to be - I recall clips of women talking proudly of aborting children - yet if those children did have special needs I suspect they would not - no virtue to be gained
1320317592867905537 2020-10-25 18:53:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> I applaud this women for not wanting to abort her child - but I can not help thinking that we have got to the stage where we abort children without special needs and there is no emotional push back   https://t.co/9zOpvSFSxA
1320316705508380673 2020-10-25 18:50:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @deffo55 and we should stop allowing them - stop appeasing them - and stop ignoring their barbarity

1319285725620154368 2020-10-22 22:33:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> It is not censorship to arrest people who want to cut peoples heads off
1319272017959383046 2020-10-22 21:38:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> Any self respecting Government should be doing all it can to help parents get jobs so they can feed their own children - not feed them for them so parents are unable to do so
1319269008319787015 2020-10-22 21:26:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> But this is not really about actually helping those children - this is about appearing to want to help them - to enhance status, ego and virtue  ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING IS HARD - MAKE OTHER GUILTY AND GET THEM TO DO IT FOR YOU IS MUCH EASIER

1319255370762735617 2020-10-22 20:32:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesD_1985 the article you tweeted did suggest the attack could be islamophobic - although no proof was provided apart from the victims being of Algerian descent - the argument was about a dog?
1319209077583581185 2020-10-22 17:28:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesD_1985 I think the main incentive for media reporting is if they can spin it as a racist hate crime in some way - George Floyd etc

1319190971268141056 2020-10-22 16:16:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesD_1985 It seems to me that some cases are reported in the media etc - such as Stephen Lawrence and others not - such as Kriss Donald etc - because the media are trying to portray society in a particular way - white people are racists
1319049135966793729 2020-10-22 06:53:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesD_1985 I shall take a look tomorrow - thanks for the discussion - hopefully we can continue to ponder this

1319048370317557761 2020-10-22 06:50:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesD_1985 that is the question - why is this case ignored?  Is it because of the victim - too male, pale and stale?

1319009890162102278 2020-10-22 04:17:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AngelaMcKavana1 It was a tragic case - Tracey Connelly had a tragic upbringing (I do not want to excuse what she did or did not do) - it seemed to me she was made the scapegoat (maybe rightly)

1317486365362298887 2020-10-17 23:23:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JonathanMansfi4 totally agreed - they will be doing all they can to ignore it or distort it - their usual favourite methods of deceit are mental health, to avoid any mention of him being muslim - or portray the victim as being responsible somehow
1317485292715188224 2020-10-17 23:19:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CuchulainnCu they are no where the same - they are total opposites   did Jesus kill anyone did Jesus ever condone rape  Jesus died for our sins - mohammad died because of his
1317484366721880065 2020-10-17 23:15:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CuchulainnCu and if islam it is nothing to do with islam - then fully discussing what islam is - should prove this beyond doubt  Who is mohammad what is islamic history what is islam saying - really
1317483988924104704 2020-10-17 23:13:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CuchulainnCu most people - agreed  it is those that can be inspire, manipulated, motivated to kill that are the issue  If islam is reaching these people and providing the missing ingredients - then - what have you got?
1317483090487422978 2020-10-17 23:10:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CuchulainnCu agreed - and could books, religion, doctrine, etc influence them - make them feel stronger - or not?

1316315368554672134 2020-10-14 17:50:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion you are proving my point for me   We are going to go around in circles Jez - I would urge you to think deeper on this - I suspect you would ask the same of me  so can we call it quits and leave in peace - all the best

1316314808388591617 2020-10-14 17:48:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion what murder and oppression of black people?
1316314687395463168 2020-10-14 17:47:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vmartine1905 @ExMuslimTV @Ploeg1951 @o_alshaima @ComputerChick0 Morning sweetie - I thought you might be interested in this testimony
1316314418284834819 2020-10-14 17:46:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion I now believe that our culture has been indoctrinated to blame white people for racism - it has generated white self hatred and white guilt  this is cultural and deep
1316314052453335041 2020-10-14 17:45:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion You probably wont believe this - but I was saying very similar things to you a few years ago - then I started to think about it - I read, saw and experienced things that made me reflect upon my thinking - I have tried to explore this in blogs, poetry and so on
1316313704548401154 2020-10-14 17:43:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion And they called Darren Grimes a racist - and David Starkey   and people will say they have proved they are  Be careful who you call a racist - next time someone might call you one
1316313199562625030 2020-10-14 17:41:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion they can not get apply for these opportunities - I would call that a form of persecution yes   If any other ethnic group was excluded we would not accept it - and I would call that persecution as well
1316312743625068544 2020-10-14 17:39:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion it is discrimination
1316312600066560000 2020-10-14 17:39:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion when I phoned them they assured me they were looking to support Jake and regretted their approach to Tommy (my words)  I have heard nothing from them  But they will help David Starkey / Darren Grimes etc
1316312265755447309 2020-10-14 17:37:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion Good - did Free speech Union assist / support Tommy or Jake - I have tweeted them numerous times about this - sent them an e mail and phoned them twice
1316312015913222144 2020-10-14 17:36:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ExMuslimTV @Ploeg1951 @o_alshaima @ComputerChick0 @Vmartine1905   Is islam good for women?
1316306202700193793 2020-10-14 17:13:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion Do you deny that Dawn Butler falsely portrayed white police as racists?  Do you deny that Naz Shah liked a tweet saying white girls should shut up (about being gang raped) for the sake of diversity?
1316305819118563328 2020-10-14 17:12:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion do you deny Kriss Donald was abducted, abused, tortured, killed and set on fire because he was white?
1316305633747103746 2020-10-14 17:11:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion Grooming gangs - do you deny white girls were targeted - do you deny police etc failed to investigate because they were afraid of being called racists?

1316304976688357376 2020-10-14 17:08:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion I understand why you want to keep bringing it back to Tommy and Jake - I do not blame you - it is a very good tactic - but it is not productive  If you want to explore these issues - Im up for it  if you want to shout and earn virtue - Im out
1316304567940853761 2020-10-14 17:07:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion daft and pointless - never oppressed or targeted  where to start - grooming gangs / Kriss Donald /   the list is long - very long  South Africa - Zimbabwe?
1316304039961866243 2020-10-14 17:05:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion just for the record - we are not going to agree about Jake or Tommy and calling them racists is making my point for me  It will be more interesting if we leave them and others out - and try to stick to what we think - ourselves
1316303704279187456 2020-10-14 17:03:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion I was asking you - what you think about saying it is ok to be white or white lives matter
1316303045463027713 2020-10-14 17:01:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke @SpeechUnion OK   what do you think of about someone saying it is OK to be white - or white lives matter?

1316300879486758913 2020-10-14 16:52:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke But I am thinking about the wider cultural and social issues - such as the lack of support @SpeechUnion provide for Jake Hepple and Tommy - but they do support 'middle class' people who are in media(?)
1316300555694809088 2020-10-14 16:51:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke I do not want to talk too much about this - I prefer to keep things to myself on twitter - but there have been issues at work, intimidation on the streets by ethnic groups and other such incidents  My book of poetry looks at this a bit more
1316299716582350849 2020-10-14 16:48:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jrwyke I guess it depends upon your definition - but I would classify myself as white working class  We will have to agree to disagree about the support Tommy Robinson has

Is that what you are saying?

1315272566903377926 2020-10-11 20:46:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vmartine1905 @SBrownloe @KateAndrs @BrianBeny @darrengrimes_ @metpoliceuk Yes - because he gets out and about and makes people aware - hence they smear and slander him - stitch him up and try to silence him

1315263823121649668 2020-10-11 20:11:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Gingersnap_ agreed - and barnados point the finger at us

1315235891409870849 2020-10-11 18:20:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @IdentityEng good luck to you all - I am with you

1315226495216840704 2020-10-11 17:43:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> wow - why did you use a picture of a white child?  is this what real whitewashing looks like?

1312821965053452290 2020-10-05 02:28:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AquaVixen1 meaningless nonsense  “Think of white privilege as an unearned, almost randomly assigned head start,” explains Mikki Kendall, author of Hood Feminism. “It doesn't guarantee that you're going to win the race. It just means that you get to start a few feet further forward.

1312778677269209090 2020-10-04 23:36:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GloriousAlbion @hostileholly5w Personally speaking I think we need to try and assist those who are fighting against our shared enemies - our disunity and lack of discipline may be our undoing?

1311970833678688258 2020-10-02 18:06:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> Feels like the media (etc) will exploit this for all its worth - and this could be a pivotal moment in the election  they will portray Trump as reckless, risking lives   and it is very hard to argue against   like calling someone a racist  No need for proof - the accusation alone
1311970388629491712 2020-10-02 18:04:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @THedrof @Marion56728932 yep - it will be exploited for all it's worth
1311970162522894336 2020-10-02 18:03:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DennyBache agreed - we live in a time when saying white lives matter loses your job - but saying black lives matter gets you a promotion

1311609044315049984 2020-10-01 18:08:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Stephen10334408 totally agreed
1311607866688765955 2020-10-01 18:04:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> Are you happy that our culture teaches our children that they are racists?
1311602767908274176 2020-10-01 17:44:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jay_Beecher he has a point - our culture now actively indoctrinates us that we are evil, racists and to blame for everything  I wish more people would talk about this

1311037777472090113 2020-09-30 04:18:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> Surely he will not be able to continue - who would vote for a president suffering from a mentally deteriorating condition?  and if they do continue - what does this say?

1310937616028762113 2020-09-29 21:40:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @StrugglesClass totally agreed - your video reminded me of Ali Dizaei - who was convicted of 2 offences - if recruiting people because they are not male and pale is all that matters - we may find out our institutions are no longer capable of serving the public   https://t.co/d5YTzwbbba

1310604827265826816 2020-09-28 23:38:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SteveRightNLeft @carolrobinson15 @CConcern many thanks for the information - I wish you all well in your endeavours to keep speakers corner open, free and safe

1310561138480943105 2020-09-28 20:44:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> Is Owen Jones paid by the far right?  the more times he says it - the more cash he gets?
1310560233983545344 2020-09-28 20:41:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> also not how many times they mention parents are Roman Catholic - however it was previously reported he was on terror watch list?  Had he converted to something?

1310511770012979200 2020-09-28 17:28:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> Once I would have thought dispensing with yourselves and the BBC would be bad for free speech / freedom and democracy - now I think we need to remove you both to save them

1310265039740338179 2020-09-28 01:08:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jatroa it is interesting (I think) that the word terror has not been used - either to deny or confirm
1310261661362778112 2020-09-28 00:54:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jatroa has also been reported someone has been arrested for supplying a firearm
1310258017028526080 2020-09-28 00:40:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jatroa named - 23yr Louis De Zoysa who lives in Norbury 4 miles from Croydon Police Station  apparently Sri Lankan name
1310257675536605184 2020-09-28 00:39:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jatroa agreed - although it has been reported that he was on the terror watch list - so maybe there is a terror link?
1310254954481881090 2020-09-28 00:28:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jatroa I am not sure that islamic terrorists usually work with others - others may be connected - but not directly involved or have any knowledge of it - they tend to be very small groups or lone attackers
1310248842047168513 2020-09-28 00:04:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jatroa that point has also been made   It still seems to me that if perpetrators are white and especially if victims are not - identity is very quickly given

1310233484934500354 2020-09-27 23:03:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @williamjpalmer @dannywallace it's nice of you to tell me why I disagree with something - maybe you put a good word in for me with the trouble and strife
1310231769929707521 2020-09-27 22:56:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> Well said Norman - standing up for common sense and decency
1310224909394751494 2020-09-27 22:28:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrendanChilton because they are afraid of being called racists
1310224615592144896 2020-09-27 22:27:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnEvansTW1 @dannywallace If you have all or any answers on the topic of covid - please feel free to share them - I am sure people would be keen to listen to them
1310224373152915457 2020-09-27 22:26:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnEvansTW1 @dannywallace you were suggesting that I was 'trying' to kill you   I may well be wrong - I frequently am - I would guess you are sometimes wrong - but I am not a killer
1310220736091561984 2020-09-27 22:12:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Morten_B_J @dannywallace agreed - I can only speak for myself - and if I come across those people I say what I am saying to you   It is possible to disagree with people on some things and yet agree with them on others
1310219638282878977 2020-09-27 22:07:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lionista2 @Wilfrie77917027 @dannywallace No connection as far as I know - I was just pointing out that I see no reason why my MP would either listen to me, try to understand and help in any way
1310219249110130689 2020-09-27 22:06:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnEvansTW1 @dannywallace wow - John - what a thing to suggest  Try to retain some perspective please
1310218578122113024 2020-09-27 22:03:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @emayj85 @dannywallace wow - Ms Fowles - it is not selfish to question what is happening and try to make sense of all of this  If you have all the answers - please feel free to educate me - but calling people rude names is not helpful or polite
1310179970677964801 2020-09-27 19:30:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @versewriter @JamesLynchGTC @gothgrem @dannywallace totally agree - which I think adds to the issue of trust - or growing lack of
1310179439398051848 2020-09-27 19:28:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Morten_B_J @dannywallace I kind of agree - and it is something I have to be careful of - disagreeing for disagreements sake
1310172266404212738 2020-09-27 18:59:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DavidDavisMP @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter  Seems Govt now advising Vit D use as preventative
1310167069376348160 2020-09-27 18:39:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace @trishgreenhalgh These are specialists in their fields - a good show    https://t.co/T330fsNQr9...
1310165392141307905 2020-09-27 18:32:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace @trishgreenhalgh have you been watching Diagnosis detectives?  We could do with Covid detectives - using same format - differing specialists investigating all aspects of covid - treatments / protecting / causes / symptoms etc
1310164390067527681 2020-09-27 18:28:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace They (media) were not interested at all in even remotely suggesting Trump had a point - they simply wanted to portray him as nut job - and took the opportunity with glee
1310163983450673155 2020-09-27 18:26:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace yes sir - we are (learning)  Although I see a lot of resistance to this - people entrenched in their beliefs - hostile and aggressive towards those they do not agree with - unwilling to challenge themselves
1310162870097907713 2020-09-27 18:22:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace agreed - and then people are left looking to David Icke for answers - and I was there too.  Trust has broken down - I guess the question is - can it be rebuilt - and how - who?
1310162007589621762 2020-09-27 18:18:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace I was thinking more of the media and political smearing - especially to attack Trump
1310161776441524225 2020-09-27 18:18:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace I get the feeling the horse has already bolted - and we (as a society) are trying to make sense of it all   But it's like holding onto water - you think you are beginning to get an understanding - and then another scientist comes along and tells you - you are wrong
1310160310314074113 2020-09-27 18:12:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace agreed - it is interesting which they push - masks - and which they do not push Vit D - and those which they smear HCQ
1310159117953241088 2020-09-27 18:07:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace thanks for the link - I suspect eventually we will have a very good understanding of what Covid is and what works etc  In the mean time - following good advice is probably advisable - but asking questions is essential
1310157594582028289 2020-09-27 18:01:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace pushing unproven treatments?  are face masks proven? is lock down proven?  Did the Boston university research into Vit D prove anything?  I think this is (part) of the problem - what has been proven?  so much confusion and conflicting information by professionals
1310156070728486912 2020-09-27 17:55:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLynchGTC @versewriter @gothgrem @dannywallace  https://t.co/SKYKI4Mz6l

1310146472781000705 2020-09-27 17:17:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @davball15 @liamkeogh4 @dannywallace you disagree with protesting against extremism?
1310144554524454912 2020-09-27 17:09:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Chris_mk @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace it got us talking
1310144395472236544 2020-09-27 17:08:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Chris_mk @LattMaurillard @dannywallace you may have stumbled across the answer to this question - what does china know?
1310144049987358726 2020-09-27 17:07:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Chris_mk @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace precisely
1310143308291858432 2020-09-27 17:04:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GunnerBeGood22 @dannywallace all of the above
1310139170866724864 2020-09-27 16:48:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Wilfrie77917027 @Lionista2 @dannywallace I'm not an anti masker - if people want to wear them - fine  I wonder if they do any good?  Tommy Robinson is a very courageous man
1310137159895130112 2020-09-27 16:40:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @InglaterraE @dannywallace glad you know which is which
1309953281742049280 2020-09-27 04:29:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mainspeach @LattMaurillard @dannywallace that is it for me - good night and God bless  thanks for the healthy discussion
1309952924978741249 2020-09-27 04:28:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace we are all connected - there are all sorts of impacts going on - cancer and suicide for example - job loss and homelessness etc   who matters..............most?
1309952636930723841 2020-09-27 04:27:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @petefeet67 @dannywallace this is where I disagree - protest can never be illegal - that is when we need it most  I hope the reason why  is self evident
1309952328397660160 2020-09-27 04:25:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mainspeach @LattMaurillard @dannywallace I did similar for 3 weeks - tried to get a balanced view and some answers - all I got was more questions - but I think I got some balance out of it
1309951634856914944 2020-09-27 04:23:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lionista2 @dannywallace agreed - and that is a big reason why I wear one - but that is my choice - I prefer to avoid conflict - which may be a weakness or a strength - depending upon whom you talk to
1309951220807872513 2020-09-27 04:21:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @petefeet67 @dannywallace 99% of shoppers wear masks and SD?  Nice stat - not sure it is reliable though  From what I saw BLM and XR did not wear masks or SD - although I agree XR did better
1309950265035034624 2020-09-27 04:17:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace reckless   It is reckless to ask question - it is reckless not to agree with me - it is reckless to wonder what if  And some say David Icke is nutty - it may help us all if we stop with the emotive language - and tried to accept others have different opinions  its OK to disagree
1309949410546196480 2020-09-27 04:14:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mainspeach @LattMaurillard @dannywallace yes - and thank you - we are in the minority here - and your help was appreciated - is appreciated
1309948919909167107 2020-09-27 04:12:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace another good question - when do we reach enlightenment?  I suppose - we know when we know  and even if someone knows something that is wrong (earth is flat) then their truth is their truth - is that OK?
1309948362305802240 2020-09-27 04:10:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lionista2 @dannywallace there were a lot of anti maskers - personally - I'm on the fence - wear them - don't wear them  Just be courteous to those that do the opposite to you
1309948018414755841 2020-09-27 04:08:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MassenChris @dannywallace This is the struggle we are all engaged in - how to protect each other - from all illnesses - and he consequences of lockdown and economic hardship - job loss / homelessness etc
1309947662914007040 2020-09-27 04:07:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace that is the million dollar question - when do we accept when we are wrong  Not yet it seems
1309947423263924225 2020-09-27 04:06:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace afraid - I just stood in the middle of a massive crowd after being repeatedly told I will catch Covid and have a terrible disease  There is nothing wrong with fear  Rules are great - ask Lenin - Hitler and Mao - they loved them
1309946889811492869 2020-09-27 04:04:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lionista2 @dannywallace Covid?  to start with - was it man made? what is it made of?
1309946627805904897 2020-09-27 04:03:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace then I will be wrong - and I hope I have the god given sense to realise it and accept it  personally speaking - I think being wrong is healthy - it means you questioned yourself and learnt
1309946224255086597 2020-09-27 04:01:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace How do I know I am not asking questions?  If the culture I am living in makes it so hard for me to do so - at risk of fines or assault or prison - that I am too afraid to do so
1309945636054327296 2020-09-27 03:59:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace If it is man made I think it will be different - we may even start to understand the virus better - what it does and how to treat it / protect against it
1309945275293798400 2020-09-27 03:57:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace How do you know if you are being told the truth?  ask questions?
1309944906115420160 2020-09-27 03:56:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace I do not know - I have not got it (yet)  let me ask you - given the choice - would you rather be told the truth or a lie?
1309944620332265472 2020-09-27 03:55:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace because we are not being told the truth?
1309944419194482688 2020-09-27 03:54:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @petefeet67 @dannywallace BLM? Extinction rebellion? shoppers?
1309944133289639939 2020-09-27 03:53:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jedistocksy82 @dannywallace what difference would the truth make - I would rather live in the truth if I can - I think once truth starts to erode from a society than darkness follows quickly behind
1309943833032110087 2020-09-27 03:52:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace this can get quite deep?  Are you free to protest against Covid?
1309942875061448720 2020-09-27 03:48:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace erosion of freedom
1309941876053676033 2020-09-27 03:44:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace As far as I am aware people can spend their own money how they choose   I am not sure he is a con man - I think he believes what he says - he may be delusional - he may even be right - on somethings he makes very good points - on others he is away with the fairies
1309941167832924161 2020-09-27 03:41:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace it seems to me - we are not getting answers - full stop
1309940928363270151 2020-09-27 03:40:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xyzfredsmith @dannywallace Don't buy his books - don't pay his subscriptions
1309940638012649473 2020-09-27 03:39:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lionista2 @dannywallace Yes - I think the days of MP's acting on our behalf are gone I am afraid   This is why I am concerned about erosion of freedom and have been for some time
1309940363885522945 2020-09-27 03:38:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MassenChris @dannywallace No one wants to put you or anyone at risk Mr Massen - I think it is unfair to try and portray us as such   There are all sorts of health problems that are being negatively effected - cancer / heart disease and suicide  for example
1309939671418494977 2020-09-27 03:35:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace OK - so you and I disagree  You are happy with what you have been told -fine  I am not happy and would like to know more - is that OK  which is partly why I went today - and that is what David Icke would call freedom - interesting?
1309938955018735616 2020-09-27 03:32:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace That is up to you my friend   We must all start with questioning ourselves first
1309938570057129987 2020-09-27 03:31:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace the point is - there are people / scientists saying this - are they all wrong / mad?  You say listen to the scientists - do you mean just those you agree with?  This can be answered - the Chinese do know
1309938096226533376 2020-09-27 03:29:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace You could be right - he could be  How can we ever know - maybe ask China - maybe visit the lab - maybe look into what happened there?  Would that help clear things up?
1309937801505509377 2020-09-27 03:28:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lionista2 @dannywallace wow - and you think David Icke is into conspiracy theories?  I e mailed my MP several years ago asking her to look into threats against Tommy Robinson - she ignored me
1309937451583123458 2020-09-27 03:26:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace Galileo is a nut job - lock him up
1309937156375433216 2020-09-27 03:25:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @mainspeach @dannywallace If you only trust the people you agree with - you may find it difficult to question your belief  and if your belief is wrong - you may be living a lie
1309936863961112579 2020-09-27 03:24:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lionista2 @dannywallace I would like answers and clarity  I do not think we are going to get clarity - especially if we do not get any answers
1309936445952491521 2020-09-27 03:22:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Lucas__Kane @dannywallace How?
1309936290566209541 2020-09-27 03:22:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace @Tim_Baughan @LattMaurillard Cheers Danny - thanks for the chat - hopefully you might reconsider that we are all angry nut jobs - more curious than angry - more uncertain than nutty  Goodnight
1309935889913647106 2020-09-27 03:20:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mainspeach @LattMaurillard @dannywallace Dr Paul Cottrell and Luc Montagnier   https://t.co/hrxLIbDPKv

1309935039019393025 2020-09-27 03:17:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace I do not think David Icke is right about a lot of stuff - where I think he has a point is about the erosion of freedom  The popularity of David Icke, in this, is very interesting (to me)   To dismiss these people as loonies and idiots is too simple - something is connecting them
1309934350327336963 2020-09-27 03:14:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mainspeach @LattMaurillard @dannywallace what was synthetically mutated with a bat virus (HIV?)
1309934187999367168 2020-09-27 03:13:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @dannywallace Bingo - the racism card is played  Do you see what you are doing when you play that card - you are stopping debate and questioning what is happening  Grow up - I could be wrong - you could be
1309933833446404097 2020-09-27 03:12:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Tim_Baughan @LattMaurillard @dannywallace I brought his book when he first went on his journey - lizards and everything  I do find it very interesting that he has had a 'resurrection'  He got a very warm reception - and then just quoted Bill Hicks (from what I could hear)  Sometime those who question are on the fringes
1309932997152509955 2020-09-27 03:08:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @LattMaurillard @dannywallace I do not think the virus is zoonotic - I suspect it was man made in the Wuhan lab - I would like to know for sure  I could be wrong - so could you
1309932579961925632 2020-09-27 03:07:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mlw1492 @dannywallace No - please feel free - I have seen persuasive arguments both ways (made by scientific professionals)
1309932032840151040 2020-09-27 03:05:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace I listen to David Icke and others for a variety of reasons - I want to know the origins of the virus (Wuhan Lab) - I want to know what it is made of / from  I worry about the erosion of freedom / free speech in this country (This has been something I have spoken about many times)
1309931420723351554 2020-09-27 03:02:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace I have no problem with people either wearing or not wearing a mask   If my mask protects you from me - then it must protect me from you - and if you do not wear one - then I am protected because I do?
1309931114341990400 2020-09-27 03:01:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace I do not disagree - I just think we have been given conflicting and contradictory information - and I think people are right to question this  I would like to know the truth about all this
1309929998963347458 2020-09-27 02:57:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace I think when performing open heart surgery / or dealing with other open wounds - the risk of infection may be greater - but I'm no medical expert  Disposable might be the key?  Are you denying them telling us masks might spread the virus and not to wear them?
1309929352386273281 2020-09-27 02:54:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace and yes - I do believe there is a virus - and here is another of those pesky questions - where did it come from?  Did it (by any chance) come from the Wuhan lab - is it man made?
1309928846813261825 2020-09-27 02:52:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace Hi Danny - I met some very interesting people - and yes - I wear a mask where I am told to do so  This is one of these questions I was talking about - is wearing a mask protection - I suspect you can recall when they telling us a mask might help spread the virus
1309927361354313729 2020-09-27 02:46:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dannywallace Mr Wallace - I was there - and if you had spoken to me I would have told you I am not angry - that is probably your own projection - confused is the overwhelming feeling  questioning what we are being told used to be considered a healthy sign
1309749201568518145 2020-09-26 14:58:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RendallYaho From what I read (which may be wrong) he was acting strange - stopped / searched(?) - ammunition was found  strange
1309748346236608513 2020-09-26 14:55:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Justin86864525 I accept I could be wrong - but I could have a point - and this point has been echoed over the last 24hr by senior police officers and general public
1309748135275749376 2020-09-26 14:54:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Justin86864525 Justin - you are proving my point for me - if all you do is call people racists for asking legitimate questions then surely you must see you are contributing to the uncertainty we all face
1309747483518656512 2020-09-26 14:51:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WhatsUp_1971 there is no doubt she undermined them and contributed to the lie that the Police (and UK) are racists  She should be dismissed and held accountable for her words and actions

1309745791976775680 2020-09-26 14:45:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> TOO MUCH WRONG THINK
1309745300421181440 2020-09-26 14:43:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> When Dawn Butler falsely accused (white) Police officers of racially profiling her she contributed to the belief that all police are racists and made the Police afraid of being called racists - which may have contributed to them not properly searching the man in Croydon  https://t.co/qFe8iMDJOp
1309741533118300160 2020-09-26 14:28:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cottle_delia too much wrong think?  which ironically used to be called common sense
1309587282568122371 2020-09-26 04:15:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Janet42957897 I agree - but what I am worrying about is being fobbed off as usual

1309570935557623809 2020-09-26 03:10:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JennaGuillaume @francesweetman just were
1309560101766926337 2020-09-26 02:27:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TeresaGreen46 they had found ammunition on him he had been on the terror watch list  no threat?
1309547472096759808 2020-09-26 01:37:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @steve0G1 why - is fear of being called a racist preventing police from doing their job properly - searching for example - is this a result of that - like ignoring grooming gangs?
1309547084866097152 2020-09-26 01:35:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @sarahandrews77 we only think it is bad to think like that because we have been indoctrinated - it is not bad to think like this - but it is bad to think we are never wrong - which is where the left is
1309546405418143750 2020-09-26 01:32:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HerbertTirol @geordieonline I think it is one and the same
1309545881591525378 2020-09-26 01:30:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TruthAboutAsons especially if the perpetrators are not white and the victim is
1309526572550979584 2020-09-26 00:13:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ChitChat5 that is the question - why did the gun get through  My concern is that fear of being called or thought of as racist is hampering our polices ability to do their job properly
1309526121868939264 2020-09-26 00:12:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richarddowden8 I agree - I no longer trust the police or media to be open and honest in such cases   I can share many reasons and examples - but i suspect it would be pointless in doing so
1309525717584052224 2020-09-26 00:10:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JuliaHB1 she is a serving member of parliament with a very high media profile - she abused he position and status to portray the police as racist  fear of being called racists may have prevented the officers from doing a proper search on this suspect
1309524005809016832 2020-09-26 00:03:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays goodbye Carl
1309523762354716672 2020-09-26 00:02:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays Carl - I am not going to repeat everything I said - let alone everything you said
1309523316403822594 2020-09-26 00:01:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richarddowden8 seems he was on the terror watch list   https://t.co/QeiX7bZdhx
1309523041873993728 2020-09-25 23:59:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ChitChat5 seems he as on the terror watch list - so the question as to why he was not searched is more important    https://t.co/QeiX7bZdhx
1309522494248964097 2020-09-25 23:57:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays so you can not show me?
1309522297166991360 2020-09-25 23:57:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ChitChat5 what if he got the gun in there because the Police are so afraid of being called or thought of as racists that they felt unable to fully search him?
1309522097870430208 2020-09-25 23:56:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays where have I said anything against anyone because of their skin colour?
1309521900368990208 2020-09-25 23:55:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richarddowden8 No feeding any kudos - just curiosity at what I see all around me
1309521687088697345 2020-09-25 23:54:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Maurice010101 not that I can offer an alternative - either keep the economy going (no lock down) or let jobs go (political suicide)
1309521329373302784 2020-09-25 23:53:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Maurice010101 Not sure I agree with you about job losses - we are witnessing many losses already with dire predictions of what is coming towards the end of the year   He may have stuck a finger in the damn - we shall see if it holds - I am not sure it will
1309520902363779072 2020-09-25 23:51:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays Everyone - regardless of colour should be treated the same   everyone
1309520527288082433 2020-09-25 23:49:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richarddowden8 I agree I am chomping - I have seen a number of these cases over the years - and the similarities is striking  You can dismiss it as just me if you like - or you could maybe think a bit more about it - and even try to show me why I am wrong - if I am
1309519987531448321 2020-09-25 23:47:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @PatriotActive66 @Vladtepesblog   The level of service provided to migrants - no expense spared - best of everything
1309519407467630593 2020-09-25 23:45:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays why not try responding to my question - disprove my hypothesis - can you not see that all you are doing is convincing me you have no argument - just calling me a racist will not work
1309518921112981510 2020-09-25 23:43:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays why bother asking me - if you already know everything about me
1309518506052984839 2020-09-25 23:41:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Maurice010101 No - I was just asking
1309518227915988992 2020-09-25 23:40:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays 1) are our police afraid of being called or perceived as being racist and are now unable to do their job properly because of this
1309517856607002626 2020-09-25 23:39:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richarddowden8 I take your point - but I get the impression when cases where BME attackers have attacked and / or killed white people the release of information is far slower and a narrative is create  Another recent example being Birmingham   https://t.co/ks8mjrkU49
1309517176198623232 2020-09-25 23:36:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Maurice010101 how?   https://t.co/l8TQwT0yvG
1309516355784323072 2020-09-25 23:33:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richarddowden8 @dwm_dan I take that point - however it seems to me that if perpetrators are not white and especially when the victims are there is a an effort to slow the release of information and attempts to create a narrative  another recent example    https://t.co/ks8mjrkU49
1309515356541775874 2020-09-25 23:29:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays wow - how is it possible for someone to conclude that is what I said or meant is madness  Try thinking Carl - your are blinded by your belief that people are racists - and it is incorrect
1309514962004578310 2020-09-25 23:27:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Richarddowden8 Not sure it is standard Police procedure - but I take your point it is a difficult balancing act for them  I am really wondering how this balance is made - and it seems to me - it is not an equal spread depending upon ethnicity
1309514318678028290 2020-09-25 23:25:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Maurice010101 it's always nice when people give us money for doing nothing  Until we realise it has to be paid back
1309512447875862533 2020-09-25 23:17:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @anitanewark2 yes
1309512139154034688 2020-09-25 23:16:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays It is a question  that is my working hypothesis - I am testing my hypothesis to see if it has any merit   It seems to me it does - which is why I am continuing with it
1309511741638881280 2020-09-25 23:15:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays are BME so indoctrinated to believe that white police (people) are racists that they feel discriminated against when they are not - and are then justified to react violently (at times)
1309511439372169216 2020-09-25 23:13:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays I did make a point right at the beginning  are our police afraid of being called or perceived as being racist and are now unable to do their job properly because of this&gt;&gt;
1309511005567938560 2020-09-25 23:12:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays I could tell you were far too clever for me from the start - I had no chance
1309510607343890432 2020-09-25 23:10:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays because you know - if those that disagree with you are not racists - then maybe they have a point - and if they have a point - then maybe we should find out - and if we try to find out - then maybe you were wrong from the start  your world view is then challenged
1309510201230401536 2020-09-25 23:08:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays rubbish - I think people should be questioned  But you are not questioning - you are accusing
1309509286872207360 2020-09-25 23:05:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays it would appear not
1309508762412232704 2020-09-25 23:03:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays wrong - I know we do not matter
1309508624608354306 2020-09-25 23:02:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays I can tell he is a racist! WOW - tell me how sire? he is white! errrr - you can tell by his skin colour, are you sure? Are you one? No! But you dare to disagree with me - you must be I wasn't disagreeing sire - I see what you mean now GOOD - now do as I say  https://t.co/1GLvp2bPm6

1309507657284411392 2020-09-25 22:58:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays Thanks Carl - well said
1309507504775323649 2020-09-25 22:58:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @IanStreetersays @legendarycarll Ian - many thanks for suggesting what I do with my life - if you don't mind - I will make my own choices thank you  But while we're making suggestions to each other - may I suggest you firstly follow your own advice before giving it  living without obsession
1309507019867656193 2020-09-25 22:56:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays shall we play a game - spot the racist  you go first  https://t.co/THRSYg7tLj
1309505714776346624 2020-09-25 22:51:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays why bother asking the question if you won't even listen to the answer  Pointless
1309505393274564610 2020-09-25 22:49:49 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WarholsDad time to get the shake and vac out

1309505049207410692 2020-09-25 22:48:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @legendarycarll @IanStreetersays very good question   Is fear of being called or thought of as a  racist preventing the police from doing their job properly  are constant accusations of racism falsely portraying our police (and all white people0 as racists and breeding resentment and grievance against them &gt;&gt;
1309504029689556993 2020-09-25 22:44:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Marke09Mark Point taken - but I am not sure why we that means we are not given a description - if he was white I suspect we would know more about him by now  as a rough rule of thumb
1309503102026948610 2020-09-25 22:40:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @IanStreetersays yes - fair minded decent people

1309488534227759104 2020-09-25 21:42:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @barrowgirl12 not as long as we are afraid of being called racists / islamophobic etc etc

1309484643096330242 2020-09-25 21:27:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @VictorAlgernon wow - that is a highly manipulative thing to say
1309484093797695489 2020-09-25 21:25:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @geordieonline it does matter - because we need to try to understand what is happening and why?  Did fear of being called a racist stop them doing a proper search did the attacker think police are just racists  etc

When they are taken from these homes they sicken and die. How long will it be until it is said, there are no Apaches?  how long will it be until it is said, there are no English?

1309471757192101893 2020-09-25 20:36:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @VerhofstadtQ it is usual for information about criminals to be given - especially in murder / rape cases  Christian Brueckner springs to mind
1309470959817183232 2020-09-25 20:33:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CDoclopez it is usual in criminal cases to identify the suspect in some way
1309466686907711488 2020-09-25 20:16:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @hostileholly5w and plotting how they can make him more into the victim - mental health is usual
1309466155426471937 2020-09-25 20:13:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @scattysmum yes - I had seen that - they say may be sri lankan
1309465369770426369 2020-09-25 20:10:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> i read the news today - oh boy  OFFICER SHOT AND KILLED IN CROYDON FOUR PEOPLE STABBED NEAR CHARLIE HEBDO   anti white hatred is fuelling this
1309464763504701447 2020-09-25 20:08:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @gvamartin @PatriotActive66 this is a sickness - that will destroy our society - our culture - us
1309463946760531968 2020-09-25 20:05:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chrisno34546082 Sadly I suspect they are feeling quite good
1309463236690010114 2020-09-25 20:02:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @gvamartin agreed - what concerns me is not the censoring - but the manipulation
1309462972973158401 2020-09-25 20:01:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jdupdater2 yes
1309461750195073025 2020-09-25 19:56:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ClaireH38655873 I agree - but that thinking gets people into big trouble
1309461376834904064 2020-09-25 19:54:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice  https://t.co/M9e7r4TKcW
1309461287693422593 2020-09-25 19:54:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice I agree - but there is also an attempt to make the attacker the victim  here is BBC   The Reverend Catherine Tucker, who was at the centre earlier, said: "The action taken against the police is really unacceptable but I also feel sorry for the perpetrator.
1309461022617591809 2020-09-25 19:53:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Kenhsilver @PaulGWesson it is being reported that may be sri lankan
1309460611173146624 2020-09-25 19:51:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ClaireH38655873 not sure that is any longer right
1309460375490920448 2020-09-25 19:50:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice I agree to an extent - but the public reaction / perception has already begun and is already being manipulated
1309459646671978496 2020-09-25 19:48:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ClaireH38655873 I suspect they know how to tell us - but are choosing not to to avoid any suggestion of racism
1309459247890038785 2020-09-25 19:46:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @playe_re sri lankan is being reported
1309458972840275969 2020-09-25 19:45:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice If 'something' cultural is going on - driven by fear of being called or thought of as a racist - then we are unlikely to find out  Unless we start asking
1309458392038207488 2020-09-25 19:43:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @philkemble6 may be
1309458076869812224 2020-09-25 19:41:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice you might be right - however - it is noticeable how often this happens when the attacker is BME and the victim white  another recent example is the attack in Birmingham when an active killer was roaming the streets and no description was given
1309457249971179520 2020-09-25 19:38:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SoNowUknow2 agreed - however you can not prove a negative  which is why calling people a racist is so successful and effective
1309457031968034817 2020-09-25 19:37:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice and the reasons for this double standard - are fear of being called / portrayed as racists - and attempts to portray the offender in a more favourable light (eg: often described as mental health issues)
1309456681445793793 2020-09-25 19:36:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice I respect your defence - however - can you not see why - people (like me) are growing increasingly sceptical - especially as we know if the offender was white we would probably know by now?
1309455732400631809 2020-09-25 19:32:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SoNowUknow2 In my experience that does not work - people are so entrenched in the belief that white people are racists they are incapable (unable / unwilling) to challenge themselves why they believe this  We have been indoctrinated
1309454997453766656 2020-09-25 19:29:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Bronco35857848 is has been reported that he may be sri lankan?  But that could be a deliberate diversion   It is so hard to tell these days
1309454734059859969 2020-09-25 19:28:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice surely you understand that not releasing details in cases like these (grooming gangs is another very good example) that people are increasingly growing concerned that we are being manipulated
1309454225374621696 2020-09-25 19:26:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond @CollegeofPolice is this not an exceptional circumstance  If not -what is?  Police will not name those arrested, or suspected2 of a crime, save in exceptional circumstances where there is a legitimate policing purpose to do so.
1309453860805763074 2020-09-25 19:25:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WhiteBritish1 I think our Police (our society) are so scared of being called a racist that we are becoming increasingly incapable of acting properly

1309452628145864706 2020-09-25 19:20:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mrchrisjohn @Carter7Raymond he had obviously been charged with something  Can a description of a suspect not be given until charges are made?
1309452172812341249 2020-09-25 19:18:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @EternalEnglish agreed
1309447280550981632 2020-09-25 18:58:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> Does anyone think it is 'odd' that the name or description of the man who killed the officer in Croydon has not been released?
1309444365434204160 2020-09-25 18:47:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ParveenAtwal3 @Ender1957 fear if being called a racist is destroying this country - costing lives and enabling mass rape of white girls up and down the country
1309442210765647873 2020-09-25 18:38:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DawnButlerBrent Have you contributed to a climate of anti police hatred / mistrust?
1309440660647358469 2020-09-25 18:32:36 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SwainITV controversial is the wrong word - it is cries of racism that are undermining our Police and allowing acts (possibly) like this  while at the same time legitimising anti (white) police grievance and then behaviour   example  https://t.co/XZipl9l4Ty

1308282893521674240 2020-09-22 13:52:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @loftusroadw12 @pazzalou there are reasons for this - slavery / segregation etc  But it does not mean it is true now - and it may not mean it was true then   I think our interpretation of motivation for our ancestors is open to scrutiny - and probably impossible to judge
1308282187028946944 2020-09-22 13:49:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @loftusroadw12 @pazzalou Facts?  what is interesting is how we are interpreting these facts (although the data is open to debate I think) - and what we are doing is interpreting it to mean white people are racists

1308144414980743168 2020-09-22 04:41:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @loftusroadw12 @pazzalou as for BLM - George Floyd was not killed because he was black - he was a criminal - he had taken drugs - he (seems to have) resisted arrest   His death has been exploited for political and social / cultural power
1308143958007177222 2020-09-22 04:39:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Sentinel49 @YouTube I totally agree - but the fear of being called a racist is preventing this

1308140201454297089 2020-09-22 04:25:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @loftusroadw12 @pazzalou we have a two tiered legal system and avoid reporting on certain crimes  I think we have lost all perspective

1308137518223757313 2020-09-22 04:14:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Veritas01074319 agreed - although I do not see any political leaders of any merit - but maybe that is just me

1308127268951265280 2020-09-22 03:33:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @loftusroadw12 @pazzalou as for UK - we have tried very very hard to treat people from all races the same - obviously this is not easy - but to simply portray this as due to white racism is wrong
1308127028919623680 2020-09-22 03:32:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @loftusroadw12 @pazzalou very interesting question   I am saying that in countries where white people are in the minority with black rule they are not treated fairly - and they are ethnically cleansed from them

1307659592302764033 2020-09-20 20:35:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @S66Quack we have allowed anti white bigotry and prejudice to infect our culture - disguised as virtue - because white people are racists and all other ethnic groups o are victims of white racism

1305117091050205186 2020-09-13 20:12:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog @flyingsquad999 agreed - it is smoke and mirrors - they know if they do not put a description then they will called afraid - so they put one out that does not describe them
1305113982810894338 2020-09-13 19:59:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> Not when they replace all the white commentators with black ones  Diversity is it code for no whites allowed?

1304808535663022081 2020-09-12 23:46:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrancescaGoti @AshleyBanjo yes - but the context was -  the cases I had shown you were both white victims
1304808098079608834 2020-09-12 23:44:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrancescaGoti @AshleyBanjo and if so - can you please explain why the reaction to George Floyd?
1304807907062616068 2020-09-12 23:43:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrancescaGoti @AshleyBanjo does it just depend when the victim is white - or does is also depend when the victim is BME?
1304807144852783107 2020-09-12 23:40:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrancescaGoti @AshleyBanjo agreed  Should we call murders, assaults of white people race hate crimes - or just those against BME?
1304806758406332416 2020-09-12 23:39:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrancescaGoti @AshleyBanjo good point - isolate the extremists  I agree with you
1304804288745668608 2020-09-12 23:29:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrancescaGoti @AshleyBanjo we were discussing if BLM were fascists - what fascism means and whether that applies to them
1304796014151372808 2020-09-12 22:56:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FrancescaGoti @AshleyBanjo as for MSM - the first rule of media training is white people are racists - the second rule of media training is WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACISTS

1304121926613426181 2020-09-11 02:17:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AshleyBanjo dear Mr Banjo - the Great British public rejected fascism before and we will do again   the wolf may be wearing sheeps clothing this time - but it is still a wolf  https://t.co/7tvEw9XOeI
1304102298126344192 2020-09-11 00:59:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @AWordIfIMay agreed - any deviation from this will result will result in punishment - of ever increasing severity

1304048003125309445 2020-09-10 21:24:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> you will obey
1304013247960567813 2020-09-10 19:06:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Maggieboo15 many thanks Maggie - I think we have been indoctrinated into thinking this over many years (50+)  it is going to take effort and creative thinking to challenge and open minds to think freely about this
1304008956982026240 2020-09-10 18:48:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta agreed
1303996899033309185 2020-09-10 18:01:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta you are right - our soil is rich - but we have poisoned it
1303996447260540928 2020-09-10 17:59:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta we sicken - the English - the British - white people - our sickness is mental - we have been indoctrinated to believe we are racists - we are wrong - we are evil   how long will it be until it is said, there are no English
1303996022205673478 2020-09-10 17:57:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta I was reminded of this quote from Geronimo the other day  Thus it was in the beginning: the Apaches and their homes each created for the other by God himself. When they are taken from these homes they sicken and die. How long will it be until it is said, there are no Apaches?
1303995701752401925 2020-09-10 17:56:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta agreed - how do we work our way through this?   how do non white people think - if they strongly identify with their race / culture / religion - and do not feel compelled to examine who they are - while we do  what does this mean?  and I think this has been happening
1303992945398382592 2020-09-10 17:45:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta I agree -but I think the question of colour and identity is needed though
1303992617710096384 2020-09-10 17:44:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta agreed - Brexit was part of this - it is in there - within our subconscious - we know what is happening to us - deep within us - and it is allowing this to come out that is very very difficult
1303992133737734144 2020-09-10 17:42:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta we are made to feel that we are racists - somehow evil - for even thinking these things - so we brush them off - push them aside and move on
1303991943576387585 2020-09-10 17:41:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta totally agreed - and I would like (if possible) to encourage those who do not see this - to at least begin to think about it - it has been too easy to ignore it - or pretend it is not happening - or blame ourselves in some way
1303991455153823744 2020-09-10 17:39:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @juliediane @Vladtepesblog @Jay_Beecher and by then - the spin will have been so effective - we will probably think he should be let off
1303989544300277760 2020-09-10 17:31:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @juliediane @Vladtepesblog @Jay_Beecher Yes - I did a brief google search yesterday - nothing more informative came up  Still do not know what his previous offences were
1303988911161708544 2020-09-10 17:29:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta totally agreed - and hopefully our own message will emerge from all of this
1303988481954402304 2020-09-10 17:27:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta agreed - this is a pin prick in the collective consciousness - in the hope that some may ask themselves - what is happening - why is it?
1303988184523722752 2020-09-10 17:26:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta you may be right - I don't know - but I agree that we need to find an effective message - I am open to suggestions - this is the best I can currently think of - to get the ball rolling
1303987815651442691 2020-09-10 17:24:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta and of all the ethnic / cultural / religious groups living here - we are the ones who are unable to express our right to exist - to say our culture is beautiful - our people are beautiful - our history is beautiful - our society is beautiful  we have to say how bad it is
1303987347290296320 2020-09-10 17:23:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta totally agreed - but I think there something deeper is happening in regards to white people - we are being constantly portrayed as racists - told we have no history - no culture - no future  we brush off attacks and murders of us - and somehow blame ourselves for them
1303986637043650560 2020-09-10 17:20:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @GiannaMarriotta point taken - we all have value - but people recognise the word matter - and at the moment encouraging people to begin to think about what is happening (to white people) is the first step (imo)  currently I think we do not even recognise that we even exist
1303986039497920512 2020-09-10 17:17:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> He lives in Germany - which still has freedom - but as islam grows in both power and numbers it will not - and then where will he be able to preach his message of change?
1303980852767002624 2020-09-10 16:57:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> today is 10 September 2020  I that I think it is very important that white people start to say very loudly that WHITE LIVES MATTER - not to cause hatred-  because I want us to look very deeply at the growing attacks and murders of white people and the causes of them  https://t.co/X4JC9cGuJX

Dimitar Bachvarov, Migle Dolobauskaite, Thomas Glassey, Michael Callaghan, Shane Rowley, Rhys Cummings and Ryan Bowers,

1303732775875379202 2020-09-10 00:31:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @chris19052 @SirClouseau @phild_A1Brit what killed George Floyd?
1303732633814302727 2020-09-10 00:30:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @SirClouseau @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit what do you want to say about it?
1303732543196364804 2020-09-10 00:30:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @SirClouseau @phild_A1Brit wrong - we have known since the dawn of time that some humans kill others - we try to protect ourselves as best we can - sometimes there is an ideology leaking into a society / culture that creates an environment where murder and attacks of certain people is encouraged?
1303732163448369154 2020-09-10 00:29:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @chris19052 @SirClouseau @phild_A1Brit why bring race into it - tell me about George Floyd - should we question if that was racially motivated - or not?
1303731977611366401 2020-09-10 00:28:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @SirClouseau @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit yes - murders happen  we know   it is the reason for this attack in Birmingham we are exploring - in particular - if there is any anti white prejudice, homophobia or religious indoctrination at play
1303730915982610434 2020-09-10 00:24:07 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Melody_Mansion @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit I've met one

1303730430601056258 2020-09-10 00:22:11 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @SirClouseau @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit I find it curious how often it is reported as having mental health issues when a black man stabs and kills white men   seems to me almost as if something is going on   https://t.co/7Ty0QoTrGk
1303729974881538048 2020-09-10 00:20:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @chris19052 @phild_A1Brit do you agree with that - or not?
1303729725400117251 2020-09-10 00:19:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @chris19052 @phild_A1Brit agreed - we do know that the ones who pictures have been released are white - yes?  and the names suggest the others could be - yes?  but I agree - they may not be
1303729311921381380 2020-09-10 00:17:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @chris19052 @phild_A1Brit nice try at avoiding answering?  care to try again  were his victims white?

1303728466202951680 2020-09-10 00:14:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit what facts have I avoided?

1303724922196365312 2020-09-10 00:00:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit agreed - there are clues - but not fool proof   which is why you need to keep an open mind and be led by the evidence - as it emerges  and we shall see what is revealed  thanks chris - always a pleasure

1303724066591907840 2020-09-09 23:56:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit you got me bang to rights - again

1303723272157179906 2020-09-09 23:53:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @chris19052 @phild_A1Brit what information am I missing Sarah - please tell me

1303722914118807552 2020-09-09 23:52:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit I am happy to discuss this case with you - and try to work out what happened - but if you just want to throw stones I will give it a miss thanks  It is upto you
1303722624997089281 2020-09-09 23:51:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit did you read my tweet - accepting they may not be  one of us is jumping to conclusions Chris - it is you
1303722312882159622 2020-09-09 23:49:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit Not sure if that is actual proof - I will keep an open mind thank you  what hate am I peddling?
1303721792692015115 2020-09-09 23:47:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit yes - would be good if we could rely on them - I am not sure we can Sarah - and we can still ask questions in this country - for now
1303721533832146945 2020-09-09 23:46:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit seems like all his victims may be white - judging by the names - but accepting they might not be   Dimitar Bachvarov, Migle Dolobauskaite, Thomas Glassey, Michael Callaghan, Shane Rowley, Rhys Cummings and Ryan Bowers.
1303721310175010824 2020-09-09 23:45:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit agreed - I have not come across any - can not find anything saying he was born in Birmingham - do you have any links confirming this?
1303720056749199361 2020-09-09 23:40:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit Yes- that was what was reported at the time - like I said it would seem fair to say he is not Somalian - but I have known people from Somalia with that surname - so I remain open minded
1303719759868047361 2020-09-09 23:39:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit and like I said - if you have evidence confirming his origins and beliefs etc - please pass it on - I will do likewise
1303719452962365441 2020-09-09 23:38:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit You are wrong - I am not jumping to any conclusions - I am trying to be open minded and I am aware that reports change and I try to keep upto date as best I can
1303719156236390402 2020-09-09 23:37:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit If you know for sure and have evidence - please let me know - I will happily clarify and pass it on
1303718806116798470 2020-09-09 23:35:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit yes - once his name was released I did say that it seems he might have West Indian links - although I did know a Somalian with the surname McCleod   I think it unlikely he is Somalian - but I do not know for sure
1303718133782503433 2020-09-09 23:33:19 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit like what - give me an example of a racist sentiment I have shared - provide evidence or apologise
1303717937778491396 2020-09-09 23:32:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chris19052 @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit what am I wrong about Chris?
1303717819889135617 2020-09-09 23:32:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit also - what was his previous offences - 3 years is quite a long sentence (I think) - and if his mental health is so bad - why was he not sectioned or placed in psychiatric unit - why prison?
1303717569115848705 2020-09-09 23:31:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit Like I said - if you have evidence he is not a muslim please share it - I will do likewise  I am curious as to what motivated him - was it anti white hatred, homophobia - religion?
1303717307219312647 2020-09-09 23:30:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit Yes his name is Zephania - which suggests to me - he could be of West Indian descent - although I did know a Somalian with the surname McCloud - but none with the forename Zephania  He could be a convert - he might not be
1303670714478858240 2020-09-09 20:24:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit He is not - you know this do you  Good - please feel free to prove it  You talk about fake news - take a look at yourself before you criticise others - if you can prove it do so - I will pass it on - otherwise - grow up and move on
1303670411612295168 2020-09-09 20:23:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit it could be a failure of our prison service - it could be a failure of our culture - which ignored attacks, murders and gang rape of white people - including children  we are terrified of being called racists
1303670100210462720 2020-09-09 20:22:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit No - I try to tweet the story as it unfolds - I have said if you have any information I will happily tweet it   I have asked you if you know if he is a muslim or not several times - you have refused to answer - I am not saying he is - I am wondering if he is
1303669738132955138 2020-09-09 20:21:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit attacks on homosexuals are increasing - and there is growing evidence these attackers are muslim - islam is not very tolerant towards homosexuals - might there be a link?
1303669473258467328 2020-09-09 20:19:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit the problem is not with me - the problem is with our police and media who are too scared to properly investigate and report these cases - do you remember Reading?  https://t.co/Htrh5SMtDe
1303669085960654848 2020-09-09 20:18:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit It may not be islamic terrorism - it could be far right terrorism - it could be homophobia - or anti white prejudice  we do not know - if you know - please tell me and I will happily pass on your facts to clarify
1303668780850130945 2020-09-09 20:17:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit yes - Police did rule out terrorism - I do not believe them - they may be right - but I do not trust them  Do you know if he is a muslim or not?
1303668143886422018 2020-09-09 20:14:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit If you have any information to add - such as - if you know he is not a muslim - then I will tweet that out as well

1303667391726002176 2020-09-09 20:11:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit how do you know he is not a muslim?  I have not blindly followed anything - I have tweeted information as it is revealed in an attempt to keep up with the story and make sense of it
1303666267946127362 2020-09-09 20:07:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit is that you apologising?

1303662472726040582 2020-09-09 19:52:09 +0800 <PymPurnell> @livelifelove83 @phild_A1Brit false message of hate - what message (false or otherwise) of hate am I spreading Sarah?  Please feel free to explain - or apologise
1303661936106668033 2020-09-09 19:50:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @deb_king1965 agreed - and the media are desperate to portray him as a victim of mental health issues - it sickens me
1303447457074995200 2020-09-09 05:37:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @caribou22 agreed - name suggests possible west Indian origins?

1303439686304755715 2020-09-09 05:06:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole yes - but it seems to me that is happening to the converted (like us) - I agree more people are taking the red pill (so to speak) but we are too few in number - and definitely not in any position to influence social and cultural change
1303439161874149379 2020-09-09 05:04:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole I do not think we are going to benefit from that change - especially because we are not able to collectively identify ourselves as belonging to an ethnic / cultural / national group - we are told we do not exist  other groups are told - express your right to exist and assert it
1303438568682123266 2020-09-09 05:02:26 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole agreed - I think the fight is for the middle ground - and this is where the demographic changes may decide our fate
1303437046942400512 2020-09-09 04:56:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole Yet on one of the biggest shows in UK - an (nearly?) all black dance group called diversity (irony?) do a homage to a black man in US who died as a result of drug use following his arrest that led to mass riots around the world - including many murders
1303436474646487040 2020-09-09 04:54:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole for example - a black guy goes on a stabbing spree in Birmingham - killing a white guy, another white guy is reported as being stabbed - a women stabbed in neck  and the media say mental health issues
1303435680010432512 2020-09-09 04:50:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole how do you mean - made people realise what is happening?  I get the feeling it is widening the divide - and spreading anti white hatred - which is being endorsed by our cultural and political elite

1303434757578067973 2020-09-09 04:47:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @NormanC22539415 @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole Hi Norman - I wish I had your confidence - I think my job may be compromised - and I may face possible repercussions which I would rather avoid
1303434302634459153 2020-09-09 04:45:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole I hope so Randle
1303432583632564225 2020-09-09 04:38:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> @McmurphyRanke @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole agreed - not sure if people are waking up - we have been mass hypnotised and are slowly drinking the cool aid
1303431217245753345 2020-09-09 04:33:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DaveAtherton20 @AngelaPower7 @JamesDelingpole we are so afraid of being called racists - we are allowing children to be gang raped - people blown to pieces - stabbed to death in the streets  this is a sickness
1303430573935996934 2020-09-09 04:30:40 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 agreed
1303430417102573568 2020-09-09 04:30:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @kwilliam111 @TrueEngland They sicken and die - how long will it be until it is said, there are no English   https://t.co/T5j5pAPK01
1303429850833866755 2020-09-09 04:27:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> THE ENGLISH SICKEN AND DIE - HOW LONG BEFORE THIS IS SAID..  Thus it was in the beginning: the Apaches and their homes each created for the other by God himself. When they are taken from these homes they sicken and die. How long will it be until it is said, there are no Apaches?  https://t.co/2JRpEjKYvM
1303428454260584448 2020-09-09 04:22:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @vbryant5846 it is always the same story
1303428297586544646 2020-09-09 04:21:37 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JorgenFaxholm I think it does work - it sets the narrative going - so by the time we learn the truth - the lie is already part of our perception - and the outrage is dampened / reduced - we are being manipulated
1303427307286212614 2020-09-09 04:17:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WoodsmanOfArden intimidation - I think they know what they are doing and why
1303427133935677442 2020-09-09 04:16:59 +0800 <PymPurnell> UK 2030?  2025?
1303426946194386945 2020-09-09 04:16:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 we were talking about Geronimo - I was thinking about a quote of his 'they sicken and die'   https://t.co/T5j5pAPK01
1303426053386502144 2020-09-09 04:12:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WoodsmanOfArden I spoke to a Christian street preacher a few years ago - he started off by saying - Abrahamic faiths - peace etc etc etc  In the end he admitted the muslims spat on the street when they passed him
1303425561914740742 2020-09-09 04:10:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @blaiklockBP @macca1969uk why - the same reason that is pushing much of our policies, law, policing, culture etc etc etc  fear of being called a racist  better to be stabbed to death - than called a racist, or rather better to let someone else be stabbed to death than called a racist
1303424590878736385 2020-09-09 04:06:53 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 where was this - UK?
1303423403454607360 2020-09-09 04:02:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TrufeSeeker2 is it mental illness - or is it  anti white hatred homophobia religious indoctrination (islam?)  what is motivating these people - where is this coming from - is our culture causing / encouraging / allowing it?
1303422989791358977 2020-09-09 04:00:31 +0800 <PymPurnell> @cooltolerance that would be my suspicion - where is this coming from - is our culture encouraging anti white hatred?
1303419319657922560 2020-09-09 03:45:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 yes - strange - if a man self identifies as a women - they will use his chosen new name and gender - such as Caitlyn Jenner - but convert to islam and blow people up on buses and tubes - they use your old name
1303414811225714696 2020-09-09 03:28:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Semiogogue I think it is just people thinking out loud - jumping to conclusions rather than anything more sinister  and I think this happens because we know the media is not telling us the truth - in fact - we know they are manipulating us
1303414464696459264 2020-09-09 03:26:39 +0800 <PymPurnell> Not his chosen name of Abdullah Shaheed Jamal   https://t.co/61DksHU2nP
1303414312569114625 2020-09-09 03:26:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog   More thoughts on Birmingham - it seems to me the name Zephaniah McLeod may have West Indian origins - which made me think of Germaine Lindsay - a convert to islam involved in 7/7 - also - it is worth noting the name they use when talking about him
1303413563378339841 2020-09-09 03:23:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 Germaine Lindsay is an example - also interesting which name the media use  https://t.co/61DksHU2nP
1303404236370313216 2020-09-09 02:46:00 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrushPercy Like wise Percy - it is good to know that there are other people fighting - we are the resistance
1303403914205724673 2020-09-09 02:44:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 although his name suggests possible west Indian origins (maybe) - which is Christian - although there are a number of high profile conversions - it would help in understanding any underlying causes of his attack
1303403563780112385 2020-09-09 02:43:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 I was wondering if he had any dealings with islam?
1303400274862788610 2020-09-09 02:30:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrushPercy Hi Percy - agreed
1303399313591148546 2020-09-09 02:26:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SteveHyde13 totally agreed - what sort of offence(s) would someone have to commit to be awarded 3 years jail time - I get the impression it would need to be something serious
1303398804041990146 2020-09-09 02:24:25 +0800 <PymPurnell> @davidro17437347 agreed - it seems entirely reasonable to think this played a part in it - and it is very worrying that our media, politicians etc are not asking
1303397636737818624 2020-09-09 02:19:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> BIRMINGHAM  was the motivation for the attack anything to do with  ANTI WHITE HATRED, BIGOTRY AND PREJUDICE HOMOPHOBIA RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTIONS?
1303397096461131779 2020-09-09 02:17:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @maxi_wallis agreed - there seem to me to be a variety of possible motivating factors - anti white - homophobia and terrorism  this is what they do not want us thinking
1303395627213172737 2020-09-09 02:11:48 +0800 <PymPurnell> @diamond54646765 agreed - how would we ever know
1303394731217620992 2020-09-09 02:08:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> what have labour become - what have we become  why did it happen?
1303393360003182592 2020-09-09 02:02:47 +0800 <PymPurnell> @lindammartin25 I guess it is possible he changed his name  I agree - he must spend the rest of his life in prison - not personally in favour of death penalty
1303392526993420290 2020-09-09 01:59:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog @Jay_Beecher   I may be wrong - but I get the feeling that to be given a 3 year sentence - the offences had to be reasonably serious
1303391366756564998 2020-09-09 01:54:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JohnCleese It is more than sense Mr Cleese - this is what we are being fed (indoctrinated) - and that our culture is wrong - slavery, empire etc etc
1303390625656696834 2020-09-09 01:51:55 +0800 <PymPurnell> The Birmingham attackers name is Zephaniah McLeod, 27 - it was reported that he was Somalian - but this name does not seem Somalian to me   Also - he has served time in prison -and was jailed for 3 years - what offences - why are we not told   https://t.co/dJfCbnqF5U
1303387647872827403 2020-09-09 01:40:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @xTrendyBurdx Hi Dee - I totally agree - we are racing to the bottom -
1303387051040149509 2020-09-09 01:37:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @David061154 they are trying to indoctrinate us - so we do not ask questions - so we do not wonder if there are other motivations behind this attack
1303386360557043713 2020-09-09 01:34:58 +0800 <PymPurnell> @dshephard33 @ShaunGr66308379 @Gefdasmi because once we start to say - the truth - we will have to face the consequences of what we have done - and that is almost unbearable
1303382557111844865 2020-09-09 01:19:51 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RubyTho93126265 @metpoliceuk @NCA_UK totally agree
1303382412802641926 2020-09-09 01:19:17 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SevTheBear it might be a motivating factor though?
1303382236406919176 2020-09-09 01:18:35 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SoNowUknow2 @Jael7772 totally agreed - white people must not know that people are killing, raping and abusing them  we must think we are to blame ......for everything
1303381718863413248 2020-09-09 01:16:32 +0800 <PymPurnell> @douglasc1966 agreed - why do white lives not matter - why no protests - why no demonstrations - why no outcry?  what has happened to us?
1303381451195453440 2020-09-09 01:15:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @garymtalbot13 @Jael7772 agreed - they are trying to portray him as a man who is not in control - so we do not become suspicious of what may his underlying motivations - islam, prejudice, bigotry, hatred?  we are being manipulated
1303381110156660736 2020-09-09 01:14:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ArkwellDaryl  https://t.co/YPE7z43ZEF
1303380790106042371 2020-09-09 01:12:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @vanessaazahar If we are saying all people who kill have mental health issues - then all people who kill should be reported as such - but this is about painting him as a man not in control - when he could well be - his motivations may be islam - maybe hatred, prejudice and bigotry?
1303380379684962306 2020-09-09 01:11:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @DrAIR1 they want to set the narrative - indoctrinate us - before the truth gets out - so that when it does - it is too late for us to realise we have already been manipulated
1303312492601528321 2020-09-08 20:41:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog @Jay_Beecher   Another victim of the Birmingham attack is white - Michael Callaghan    https://t.co/p7pdJQmXbR

1303309209392513026 2020-09-08 20:28:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HadenScript agreed - he does provoke a lot of thinking - and I think he deserves credit for that - challenging the status quo is becoming much harder these days
1303308126230372353 2020-09-08 20:24:06 +0800 <PymPurnell> @marmundy or islam mental health issue?
1303307970332237825 2020-09-08 20:23:29 +0800 <PymPurnell> @phild_A1Brit This is a very good question - for me - I try to help spread the message - join with like minded people and do what I can to fight back  We are the resistance my friend - we are all we've got
1303307489627246593 2020-09-08 20:21:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> @HadenScript as much as I like Richard Hall I do  not agree with him on 7/7 and Jo Cox
1303305931883765762 2020-09-08 20:15:23 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JonathanMansfi4 we know how they would portray that - the cries of racist and hate would ring round our ears for weeks and months on end
1303305696910413824 2020-09-08 20:14:27 +0800 <PymPurnell> @ukcynic01 agreed - but what if he was motivated by something else - a religion or bigotry and prejudice?
1303305307955830784 2020-09-08 20:12:54 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Truthseeker1238 It is a valid point - if killing someone automatically proves someone is insane - then all murderers by definition are  However - what if he was motivated by something else - a religion for example - or a bigotry and prejudice - or a hatred?
1303303874397245440 2020-09-08 20:07:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @awfullapses the same reason we do almost everything these days - fear of being called racists
1303155397444939776 2020-09-08 10:17:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @RajagraUK no chance
1303048070863769601 2020-09-08 03:10:44 +0800 <PymPurnell> @FromoutsideAlan all they learn is new ways to call white people racists and to blame them for something - in this case - we will be blamed for noticing
1303047818014322688 2020-09-08 03:09:43 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BSatnav agreed - it is wrong
1303047557254467584 2020-09-08 03:08:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @TheNewAbn0rmal yes - I am afraid so

1303045782178803712 2020-09-08 03:01:38 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Stephen90182822 and me - we must use our anger and express it to break this false narrative down - to expose them for what they are - lying, cowards
1303045151498145792 2020-09-08 02:59:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Stephen90182822 the fake narrative is being written
1303045059814789126 2020-09-08 02:58:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Vladtepesblog @SimonCBurke @WiganEmptySeat @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher I was watching this - interesting as it looks at group identity and advertising - seems to me - white people have been told they have no tribe - all other groups told they have   https://t.co/z3in65OgEu
1303043139427618831 2020-09-08 02:51:08 +0800 <PymPurnell> @MVSLGB the answer is simple my friend - because racism if we do not allow it
1303036662713331715 2020-09-08 02:25:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WillyHayes8 I suspect they know the answer - but saying white people are racists works for them at the moment - and while it keeps working - it will continue
1303035379793235970 2020-09-08 02:20:18 +0800 <PymPurnell> @teller72 @SimonCBurke @WiganEmptySeat @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog agreed - as a rule of thumb we treat attacks in BME groups as racist - it seems only fair that we started treating attacks on whites the same way  Remember the grooming gangs - Police / social services / media / politicians all too scared of being called racist - so ignored it
1303033155767676930 2020-09-08 02:11:28 +0800 <PymPurnell> @CrazyJoyna agreed - it is destroying everything it touches
1303032980731056130 2020-09-08 02:10:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SharonC84745252 I totally agree about immigration - the only racism they ignore is anti white hatred - which they all peddle
1303032496171503618 2020-09-08 02:08:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @teller72 @SimonCBurke @WiganEmptySeat @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog agreed - that would make it more obvious - It was reported there was a female attacked - stabbed in the neck
1303031803230466048 2020-09-08 02:06:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SharonC84745252 they know what loses elections - getting called racist loses elections
1303031516587589637 2020-09-08 02:04:57 +0800 <PymPurnell> @bojack90s @jonherkes and I suspect if the victim was black and the attacker white - you would be supporting me, instead of calling me a racist  it is that cognitive dissonance that has infected our culture
1303031110918721536 2020-09-08 02:03:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @bojack90s @jonherkes yes - I have concerns that when white people are killed, abused or attacked by other ethnic groups we are not treating them with the same gravity as when the attacks are the other way round
1303030788863205376 2020-09-08 02:02:03 +0800 <PymPurnell> @bojack90s @jonherkes you are wrong
1303030075382796288 2020-09-08 01:59:13 +0800 <PymPurnell> @bojack90s @jonherkes If this happened the other way round - I suspect you would be supporting my question - and it is this double standard that needs questioning
1303029686692466693 2020-09-08 01:57:41 +0800 <PymPurnell> @bojack90s @jonherkes Thank you for the advice - there is something terribly wrong with a society that calls a white man a racist for asking if the murder of a white man is a racist hate crime - but not the actual murder of that man

1303028268560461824 2020-09-08 01:52:02 +0800 <PymPurnell> @JamesLadbroke totally agreed - white people are racists - all other groups are victims of white racism
1303027771334184960 2020-09-08 01:50:04 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jonherkes &gt;&gt;as a society we can openly discuss all forms of discrimination and racism - except when it happens against white people - if we do not talk about what is happening with honesty and openness then things will get worse
1303027333444632576 2020-09-08 01:48:20 +0800 <PymPurnell> @jonherkes Hi Jon - obviously I am very sorry to hear about Jacob, and it saddens me that you think that of me   I hope and trust given time - that you will understand that I am trying to express my concerns about the growing cases of attacks on white people&gt;&gt;

1303021022514380803 2020-09-08 01:23:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SimonCBurke @WiganEmptySeat @Vladtepesblog @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher The world is hurtling towards violence - and the reason for it is because we are terrified of being called racists so ignore / downplay acts of violence against white people by BME groups and islam terror
1303019684120399876 2020-09-08 01:17:56 +0800 <PymPurnell> @prwhittle because the aggressive know they can yell racist
1303019136134582279 2020-09-08 01:15:45 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 Yes - a people robbed of their homes - they had chances to turn the tables - but failed to unite the tribes - but they could not have known what was to come - but we do  because of what happened to them
1303017250568495108 2020-09-08 01:08:16 +0800 <PymPurnell> @vbryant5846 @LadyMercia agreed
1303016808606244866 2020-09-08 01:06:30 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SimonCBurke @OlSwitcharoo @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog I accept that it is reported in some papers - but the overwhelming narrative is racist hate crime - terror  Jo Cox is another example   But when a white person is killed by a BME - it is overwhelmingly portrayed as mental health issue   You are spinning this
1303016281088589825 2020-09-08 01:04:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Saphirial24 @orange44black totally agreed - we must not let another senseless murder of a white person go by without demanding that he receives the same respect as all other murders - and not brushed aside and forgotten
1303015849561862144 2020-09-08 01:02:42 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 of course -
1303015679994589184 2020-09-08 01:02:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @andrewP94729485 wow - thank God they did not succeed

1303012748905844739 2020-09-08 00:50:22 +0800 <PymPurnell> @mickduffy1 agreed - we must change that tune
1303012492235374593 2020-09-08 00:49:21 +0800 <PymPurnell> @attorney2050 You are right Jim - we either get used to being gang raped, abused, stabbed and persecuted - or we get called racists
1303012157672620032 2020-09-08 00:48:01 +0800 <PymPurnell> @SimonCBurke @WiganEmptySeat @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog You are talking rubbish Simon - if a white man had stabbed several black people - murdering one - the cries of racist and hate would be deafening   Your double standards and hypocrisy are sickening
1303011667962458113 2020-09-08 00:46:05 +0800 <PymPurnell> @pauldowlingreal @maeve41963761 the koran encourages / orders people to kill kafirs - this is not a mental illness - it maybe indoctrination - but they are not mentally ill  calling it a mental illness (imo) excuses the gravity of the situation
1303010945522905091 2020-09-08 00:43:12 +0800 <PymPurnell> @WiganEmptySeat @SimonCBurke @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog in this country - it is racist to say white lives matter - but it is not racist to stab and kill a white man - this is total madness of the highest order
1303010078400937985 2020-09-08 00:39:46 +0800 <PymPurnell> @OlSwitcharoo @SimonCBurke @rosskempsell @Holbornlolz @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog totally agreed - a black man can stab and kill several people - and the media attempts to portray him as having mental health issues  THIS IS A DISGRACE
1303009774322278400 2020-09-08 00:38:33 +0800 <PymPurnell> The Birmingham attacked was black  a victim has been named - Jacob Billington  He was white - WHY IS THIS NOT TREATED AS A RACE HATE CRIME  #WhiteLivesMatter    https://t.co/uw7Y42c4VA

1303007183186128898 2020-09-08 00:28:15 +0800 <PymPurnell> @orange44black the race is on (again) to portray him as anything but a black man who has attacked and killed people - definitely not somalian - not a muslim   and by the time we realise he might be these things - it will be too late - we will already be indoctrinated
1303004315741835266 2020-09-08 00:16:52 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jay_Beecher @Vladtepesblog   and the media now presents him as having mental health issues - possible schizophrenia    https://t.co/G2XyDgXLn4
1303003991744315392 2020-09-08 00:15:34 +0800 <PymPurnell> NOW THAT THEY HAVE ARRESTED THE SOMALIAN MALE WHO STABBED AND KILLED PEOPLE IN BRUM - THE FAKE NEWS IS PORTRAYING HIM AS HAVING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES   https://t.co/G2XyDgXLn4
1303003150278946816 2020-09-08 00:12:14 +0800 <PymPurnell> @Jay_Beecher Mr Beecher - do we know the ethnicity of the victims - it seems to me in similar cases they are usually white  is it wrong to ask?  If so - why?  what if they are white?  would it be a hate crime?
1302839474334978048 2020-09-07 13:21:50 +0800 <PymPurnell> @chiefchimpanzee a somalian man has stabbed several people in Birmingham - killing at least one - why is that racist to report?
1302722284894015493 2020-09-07 05:36:10 +0800 <PymPurnell> @BrexitBrit @Vladtepesblog it is interesting - they finally release his image - they now tell us where he is from (Somalia) - but they still do not tell us his name - which they must know  I wonder if he is called mohammad?
1302721082529591297 2020-09-07 05:31:24 +0800 <PymPurnell> @vex66 @ClarityIslamic we should - because this is what is being taught - and it directly and indirectly impacts upon us
