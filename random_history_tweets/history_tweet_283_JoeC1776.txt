My mom who is an at risk person due to her age and health issues has said she would rather see her family and live, taking the risk she might get the virus and die. She'd prefer that over isolation.

1343326027028844551 2020-12-28 06:40:57 +0800 <JoeC1776> Congress should've thought about that before rushing a bill full of bullshit that nobody had a chance to read before voting on it. Now we know it's full of shit, and should die and start over with congress writing and debating it in the open.

The other thing that should happen is psychopaths like the asshole who saved that video to ruin this girls life should be the one getting hammered, not her.

1343268914302754817 2020-12-28 02:54:00 +0800 <JoeC1776> @ajzeigler And even if it has, does that mean the vaccine won't still be effective, or can't be modified like flu shots are every year? The fear mongering is off the charts, and infuriating. A lot of people likely see this as another excuse to never end the shutdowns and other restrictions.
1343267397634052096 2020-12-28 02:47:58 +0800 <JoeC1776> Shorter: we need more arbitrary, irrational shutdowns that do nothing but crush small businesses while not stopping the virus.   States that are open prove this approach is ignorant. Shutdowns do nothing to control or slow the virus.

1343248200384311297 2020-12-28 01:31:41 +0800 <JoeC1776> @MollyRatty Fauci is an admitted liar. He's earned every bit of criticism he's getting. And then there's the idolizing going on, also infuriating. A lot of "experts" have blown their credibility to hell this year, including Fauci.

It's common sense, or at least it used to be that biological men don't compete in women's sports because they have a size and strength advantage. Today's "feminists" have lost the plot.

Maybe they didn‚Äôt make wise decisions, but they‚Äôre not hypocrites. Trump never set any policies to break as far as the WH gathering where several people apparently got COVID.

1331637656724398081 2020-11-26 00:35:32 +0800 <JoeC1776> As a reminder, Climate Change is nothing but a big govt power grab. It‚Äôs about power and control. Has Jack shit to do with the environment, just the avenue they are using to consolidate power and micromanage people.

The media are trash. The more I hear from her, the more I like her.
1331011546131165186 2020-11-24 07:07:36 +0800 <JoeC1776> @MushKat Likely true. If Hollywood is essential, then everything is. End the shutdowns, take precautions and love. Enough of this arbitrary BS deciding who can go to work and make a living and who has to suffer. There‚Äôs not a damn bit of science behind these decisions.

If big box stores and grocery stores can stay open, so can restaurants and other small businesses. These shutdowns are unnecessary and infuriating. Take precautions and live and work.

1330884443201019904 2020-11-23 22:42:32 +0800 <JoeC1776> @ajzeigler Could not agree more.

1330712720040218625 2020-11-23 11:20:10 +0800 <JoeC1776> @MeerkatYitz @mj_184 It comes down to giving total control to dems, house, sen and prez, or keeping the majority in the sen so you have a firewall against their insane far left agenda getting rammed through. It's not rocket science.
1330704295570903046 2020-11-23 10:46:42 +0800 <JoeC1776> A lesson in how to be stupid and lose the Senate majority, giving dems control of the House, Sen and and while the legal avenues along with investigations and audits have not run their course yet, likely prez. Short sighted morons.

1328375696041897984 2020-11-17 00:33:40 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire A mistake when they do that. Again, you have to run people either the most conservative or liberal depending on your POV who are electable in a particular state or district.

1327453671651676161 2020-11-14 11:29:52 +0800 <JoeC1776> @braveunicorn55 Saw the Eagles twice. Once in 2002, and I think the 2nd time in 07 or 08. Both times excellent concerts. As for Chicago, that was in the late 80s, also very good.

How many restaurant owners who have been shutdown or forced to limit how many customers they can have must be infuriated looking at this BS.
1327417971137015808 2020-11-14 09:08:01 +0800 <JoeC1776> @TeaPartyRevived @AP4Liberty Just like the rest of the tyrant Governors/Mayors implementing these draconian shutdowns and limitations. Last week pretty much all of them were either out in the streets with thousands packed in like sardines celebrating or supported it. But Thanksgiving or something.
1327416611746230274 2020-11-14 09:02:37 +0800 <JoeC1776> Excellent! Where are the rest of the Governors. Need many more with Kristi's backbone.
1327405733089058818 2020-11-14 08:19:23 +0800 <JoeC1776> End the damned shutdowns. They are causing depression and suicides to skyrocket. In addition, how many have or are likely to die due to not getting treatment they need from their Drs or Hospital?

As someone else correctly pointed out, the people demanding we stay home on Thanksgiving and Christmas will most likely be spending time with their families. Enough of these hypocrites and their rules thee, no for me.
1327397199463018498 2020-11-14 07:45:28 +0800 <JoeC1776> You were out in crowds packed in like sardines last week. Stuff it you insane tyrant!

1327060123546755073 2020-11-13 09:26:03 +0800 <JoeC1776> If you can afford it, do both, (unless donating to dems, then just the food bank ;) )both are important. It should not be a one or the other.

My mom and step dad are in their late 70s now, and this is the only time of year I get to see my brother, sister and their families at the same time. I'll be damned if I'm taking a pass on that. Be smart, but live. Enough of this isolation and depression.

1327024219780247553 2020-11-13 07:03:23 +0800 <JoeC1776> You'd rather people sit alone over Thanksgiving, be misserable, and get depressed. People should take precautions while LIVING! Huge recent celebrations, cool, a few family members getting together to enjoy each others company, can't have that. Screw off with this shit.

1326998916592775170 2020-11-13 05:22:50 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Bombshell_Squad Why Trump won a lot more minority votes is because he paid attention and worked to make their lives better. Repubs must learn from that and not fall back on their normal ignoring of cities.

Although if they moved in now, 30 days would still put them before the runoff, unless there is a cutoff when you have to register.

Asking for peaceful protest is asking for a civilized society. It‚Äôs not white supremacy. This is the kind of divisive shit the left has been pushing for a while now.
1325782181847904256 2020-11-09 20:47:58 +0800 <JoeC1776> How it started: the left violently rioting cause they didn‚Äôt get their way.  How it‚Äôs going: the left temporarily not rioting (while being part of a super spreader event) cause they got their way.

1325757691613114368 2020-11-09 19:10:39 +0800 <JoeC1776> More power and control consolidated in DC by nutbags like the Wicked Witch from the West is NOT a "dawning of a new day". It will only bring less individual freedom and more division.
1325757177932505088 2020-11-09 19:08:37 +0800 <JoeC1776> Weird how everyone on the left is in such a rush to get Trump to concede. Almost like they're worried about what recounts, investigations and court challenges might expose. If not, then let the process play out so we can all be sure we had a free and fair election.

1325624032553803776 2020-11-09 10:19:32 +0800 <JoeC1776> Then why in such a rush to get Trump to concede.  Lets insure the election was fair, all legal votes counted, let the recounts, investigations and legal avenues play out. In the mean time, screw off, Jake.
1325622770168963072 2020-11-09 10:14:31 +0800 <JoeC1776> Do this as much as possible. I'd prefer American made products, but at a min, stuff made anywhere besides China is preferable.
1325622419814551552 2020-11-09 10:13:08 +0800 <JoeC1776> Yup. Recently bough a flannel shit/jacket on Amazon. I had to ask several groups of buyers where they were made until I found one I liked not made in China. Not American made, but damn sure not Chinese either.

The people of Georgia should be deciding this, not people from other states. How they can possibly be eligible for this election is beyond me.

1325588588445261825 2020-11-09 07:58:42 +0800 <JoeC1776> Time has passed and left have shown what despicable assholes they are. Trumps record of being good on policy if not always great on twitter shows that some of us were wrong about him, and that we can adjust based on that reality, while the left just became angrier and nastier.
1325587849664716807 2020-11-09 07:55:46 +0800 <JoeC1776> Pointing out reality is a victim complex according to this putz.

1325587055406174208 2020-11-09 07:52:36 +0800 <JoeC1776> I opposed Trump at that time also. The fact she can see that the left and dems spent four years attacking him and his supporters and the reality that there is not gonna be unity with people who called us racists, bigots, NAZIs etc, she is correctly to point out that reality.

1325564272622100481 2020-11-09 06:22:05 +0800 <JoeC1776> When the votes are recounted, investigations completed and lawsuits have run their course, just like with your 2000 presidential run, not before. Until then, Biden can chill and wait for the results with everyone else.

1325481893740089344 2020-11-09 00:54:44 +0800 <JoeC1776> Hot and smart. What a combination. :) Yep, liking Kristi more by the day.

That would obviously reduce the odds of repubs keeping the Senate. Mitt can‚Äôt stop being a useless, egomaniac who likely won‚Äôt care that he‚Äôs fucking the repubs odds of keeping the Senate.
1325453093044097025 2020-11-08 23:00:17 +0800 <JoeC1776> I can feel the love, tolerance and unity coming from the left all the way out here in flyover country. üôÑ

1325438436346650624 2020-11-08 22:02:03 +0800 <JoeC1776> Useful idiots are making themselves known.
1325438246231433218 2020-11-08 22:01:18 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Americaeditor @JamesMartinSJ @JoeBiden Want to locate two useful idiots. See the tweets above. Biden supported suing nuns while VP in the O admin and supports abortion up to birth. ü§°ü§°ü§°
1325436841949065216 2020-11-08 21:55:43 +0800 <JoeC1776> Suing Catholic nuns (Little Sisters of the poor) and abortion on demand up to birth don‚Äôt sound like something a good Catholic supports.   This entire tweet is delusional, ridiculous nonsense.
1325428988525875200 2020-11-08 21:24:30 +0800 <JoeC1776> @kaijubushi The goal with this BS offer is to take another repub Senator out of the Seante. I hope Mitt‚Äôs ego is in check enough to see the BS game Biden and dems are playing.
1325428453877944320 2020-11-08 21:22:23 +0800 <JoeC1776> @sistertoldjah Along with ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR and the list goes on. Obama years 2.0 is about to begin. Naps and ass kissing.
1325426414611476481 2020-11-08 21:14:17 +0800 <JoeC1776> Shorter: Biden is gonna kiss the ass of terrorists and terrorist enablers, blowing up any chance for more peace deals.

1325422410879930368 2020-11-08 20:58:22 +0800 <JoeC1776> The four year nap begins.
1325422016569233409 2020-11-08 20:56:48 +0800 <JoeC1776> Used to respect you. Thanks for showing all of us you‚Äôre nothing but a POS partisan hack like Tater aka @brianstelter, Don Lemon , and Fredo.
1325418497279668225 2020-11-08 20:42:49 +0800 <JoeC1776> @BiasedGirl Yep. The ass kissing and four year nap is getting ready to begin. Obama years 2.0.
1325416473297301505 2020-11-08 20:34:46 +0800 <JoeC1776> The dem ass kissing media is already kicking it into high gear. Neither of them are gonna heal anything, nor are they interested in unity or healing.

1325415708730265606 2020-11-08 20:31:44 +0800 <JoeC1776> FO! Until all the audits, recounts investigations and lawsuits are settled. Nope!
1325415242483044352 2020-11-08 20:29:53 +0800 <JoeC1776> Exactly. He has a 48 year history of being a divisive, lying asshole in DC. He ain‚Äôt gonna change now.

1325282926771179520 2020-11-08 11:44:06 +0800 <JoeC1776> @EzraCeleste @melifix Holy shit, I'm glad ACB is now on SCOTUS. We also need to do all we can to insure both GOP Senate candidates in GA get re-elected. Gridlock is good. A dem house, senate and prez would be a disaster.
1325282153979125760 2020-11-08 11:41:02 +0800 <JoeC1776> @EzraCeleste @melifix Then there are the Marxists like Kamala and the radical left like the squad, they are truly scary if they ever get power.
1325281904946540545 2020-11-08 11:40:03 +0800 <JoeC1776> @EzraCeleste @melifix I think that's most Biden voters, think no deeper than I'm mad at Trump and believe he's a fascist dictator while voting for someone who is going to further empower the govt which inevitably ends up with less freedom for the individual.
1325281370109829120 2020-11-08 11:37:55 +0800 <JoeC1776> @EzraCeleste @melifix Yep. Wish you guys could've seen the list of superficial bullshit my sister posted on why electing Biden was so great. Not one damn mention of actual policies. Lady parts, LGBT,  "unity" and other useless horse shit.
1325274474804113409 2020-11-08 11:10:31 +0800 <JoeC1776> Go fuck yourselves. You've spent the last four years being divisive, partisan, dishonest, conspiracy peddling assholes. Yes, you are fake news and enemy of the people.
1325273911341289472 2020-11-08 11:08:17 +0800 <JoeC1776> Bingo. We all should be supporting and donating to @KLoeffler and @Perduesenate. In Georgia, the GOTV effort needs to focus on what a nightmare a Biden/Harris admin with dems controlling the Senate would be. Things like this need to be pointed out. Gridlock is good.
1325271612179046402 2020-11-08 10:59:09 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Patriot_Musket Another one that's really disappointing, at least for me is Amy Lee. She's always stayed non-politcal, been ramping up a little with her get out the vote "Use my voice" operation, and now all out in support of Biden Harris.
1325270081576837120 2020-11-08 10:53:04 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Patriot_Musket I really like Gal, but holy shit man, don't be a useful idiot.

1325253709144743938 2020-11-08 09:48:00 +0800 <JoeC1776> ACB was slammed by dems and the left for being Catholic. Biden supports abortion up to birth and was the VP with O who sued Little Sisters of the poor, nuns.

He will continue to be divisive, cause that's who he is and who he has as a VP. He's not your nice grandpa.

I'm glad I was a kid in a simpler time, where parents and society in general protected kids innocence for as long as possible. There will be plenty of time to deal with adult issues. Let kids be kids.
1325222095018741769 2020-11-08 07:42:23 +0800 <JoeC1776> The clown show is proud that a senile old racist and a Marxist got elected. So much for conserving conservatism.

Dems ramming their agenda through unopposed, b/c we all know they would immediately do away with the legislative filibuster would be a disaster.
1325202978152673280 2020-11-08 06:26:25 +0800 <JoeC1776> I'm getting close to either muting my sister on FB or shutting down my account with all the delusional shit she's posting about how awesome it is that a senile old man who has been in DC 47 and a Marxist are gonna make everything awesome. Getting hard to keep biting my tongue.
1325200961917382656 2020-11-08 06:18:25 +0800 <JoeC1776> Obama spied on reporters and prosecuted them.   Also, stop being dishonest, partisan hacks, and maybe people including the president will stop calling you enemies of the people, which he is right about. #FakeNews

1325169133546303488 2020-11-08 04:11:56 +0800 <JoeC1776> @ajzeigler Exactly why investigations/audits must happen along with legal challenges that are necessary. We must know that the election was done legally and the outcome is accurate. We also must see election reform in every state that didn't have results on election night.

1325153780128645120 2020-11-08 03:10:56 +0800 <JoeC1776> Everything should be investigated and if necessary, litigated to insure the election outcome is correct, every and only legal votes were counted.

1325149359021805568 2020-11-08 02:53:21 +0800 <JoeC1776> @kimmie_c_ @JoeBiden I agree. She would be an absolute nightmare.
1325144522297286656 2020-11-08 02:34:08 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Mellecon @SaintRPh Bingo. Biden will side with Iran and the Palestinian terrorists, while throwing Israel under the bus. Pick right up where O left off. This is not good.
1325144161322995713 2020-11-08 02:32:42 +0800 <JoeC1776> Like Obama and Biden did when Trump won. What conspiracies should they begin to spread and who should they begin to spy on? #Election2020
1325143724431716352 2020-11-08 02:30:58 +0800 <JoeC1776> @ladystormbreak1 @SaintRPh Doing away with energy independence will inevitably bring that back, as the peace beginning to spread across the middle east will halt and give way to further hostility/wars.
1325143314312564736 2020-11-08 02:29:20 +0800 <JoeC1776> Idiot who was part of the Obama admin who spied on and made the peaceful transfer of power as difficult as possible by spewing Trump Russia conspiracies from O to Trump says more stupid divisive shit. But hey, let's all sing Kumbaya and come together or something.
1325136037429960705 2020-11-08 02:00:25 +0800 <JoeC1776> Dem supporters are at a super spreader event.   Am I doing this right?

1325128256337584129 2020-11-08 01:29:30 +0800 <JoeC1776> In two months the media will begin their long nap again, after 4 years of losing their damned minds and pushing conspiracies. The Obama years 2.0.
1325124684984307713 2020-11-08 01:15:19 +0800 <JoeC1776> @kimmie_c_ But the media don't take sides. Guy who has been in DC 47 and is an angry and corrupt old man is somehow good according to Jake.

Even if Biden did win, this all must be investigated and election reform must happen.

1324880346844893190 2020-11-07 09:04:24 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire Hope the GOP has learned something and doesn't throw this outreach out the window.
1324880083996332036 2020-11-07 09:03:21 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire Agree, but that's not how they've been successfully portrayed by dems and the media. Trump has successfully  brought in many people, seems minus white males (me excluded) which the party needed to do. Reaching out to people in big cities is the next logical step IMO.
1324874516703694850 2020-11-07 08:41:14 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire The GOP have always been pigeonholed as the party of the rich, the party of big business/Wall-street. It‚Äôs time to dump that and work toward being the party of not just very successful people, but people who work in trades, people who just want a better life for themselves.
1324871887109967872 2020-11-07 08:30:47 +0800 <JoeC1776> @kaijubushi Just as useless.
1324871683317129217 2020-11-07 08:29:58 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire I don't always agree w/ Jeff, but this is good advice for the GOP. Trump will not always be around, obviously, but we need to keep working to expand the tent to more minorities, women and people who do not all have college degrees, but work in trades or other jobs looked down on.
1324870940136775681 2020-11-07 08:27:01 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire This is a good thread. I agree w/ his point about GOP thinking abt &amp; working to make life better for the forgotten man, the ppl whose jobs are going to China for a cheaper iPhone or other gadget. GOP needs to not throw that aside after Trump is gone. A YUGE mistake if they do.

1324487870510473222 2020-11-06 07:04:50 +0800 <JoeC1776> @kaijubushi As I said, dems will keep finding boxes of ballots for Biden until they get the number they need for him to win. It's the only logical reason why they stopped counting on election night. To find out how many they needed to close the gap, then get to counting them. #BananaRepublic

1324351341326643202 2020-11-05 22:02:19 +0800 <JoeC1776> This is delusional. It would be a razor thin win if he wins, and repubs still hold the Senate. It‚Äôs gonna be a do nothing four years. Plus SCOTUS likely won‚Äôt be rubber stamping whatever he tries to do unilaterally.

1324024600561418241 2020-11-05 00:23:58 +0800 <JoeC1776> @BiasedGirl I know based on tweets, FNC did it early. To Decision Desk HQs credit, they never called it. Still having leaning Biden.
1324023594419105792 2020-11-05 00:19:58 +0800 <JoeC1776> Huge ballot drops with 100% going to Biden might have something to do with that. Did you take that into consideration? Shit like that is what makes people question election results.
1324022851989549056 2020-11-05 00:17:01 +0800 <JoeC1776> @ScotsFyre And that the LP and the rest of them are grifters.

1324007286046658560 2020-11-04 23:15:10 +0800 <JoeC1776> Yep, within families too. I know my sister and her two kids voted Biden while the rest of the family as far as I know voted Trump. We will still get together at Thanksgiving and have fun and enjoy each others company regardless of the outcome.

A number of states that haven't been called yet are trending in Trumps direction. It won't be long before there is no path for Biden if this keeps up, especially in the rust belt.

1323823814027915266 2020-11-04 11:06:07 +0800 <JoeC1776> TX as expected is now leaning red as well according to Decision Desk HQ.
1323823611082379265 2020-11-04 11:05:18 +0800 <JoeC1776> Wisconsin and Michigan also leaning red.
1323823479322542080 2020-11-04 11:04:47 +0800 <JoeC1776> PA is now leaning red on the Decision Desk map. Trump is winning both the EC and the popular vote so far.

EVs ain't it. They require strip mining for rare earth metals, still mostly charged by "dirty" sources, and have to be disposed of when they go bad. Not green.

They require strip mining for the rare earth metals to make the batteries, charging mostly by fossil fuel sources and disposal of batteries. Not green.

They are all racing to build the most luxurious and expensive rig the can. It was only a matter of time before they crossed $100k.

This is the best these pathetic people have after Pence crushed her in the debate.

1311430755520782339 2020-10-01 06:20:31 +0800 <JoeC1776> While I will be voting for Trump, this is insane. We do not do Kings or Queens in America. We fought a war to get away from that.
1311430311134334982 2020-10-01 06:18:46 +0800 <JoeC1776> These are not serious people. They are only creating more racial division by doing stuff like this, not less. Nobody alive today was a slave, nor anyone a slave owner. This is forcing people who had nothing to do with slavery to pay people who were not slaves. It's wrong.

1311400496368955392 2020-10-01 04:20:17 +0800 <JoeC1776> But not violent, fascist Antifa and BLM who are rioting and destroying cities across the country. #GotIt Proud Boys may be a lot of things, but I‚Äôve seen no evidence to suggest they are white supremacists.

1311338551259398144 2020-10-01 00:14:08 +0800 <JoeC1776> You're a lying sack of shit, Trump has condemned this numerous times. Violent fascist Antifa and BLM rioting and destroying cities for months on end, but a couple dozen racists with Tiki torches are what the dem candidate focuses on. #Debates2020 #debates
1311189609913757696 2020-09-30 14:22:18 +0800 <JoeC1776> FDR interned Japanese and kept the country in the Great Depression his entire presidency. Hard to believe morons on the left like you still put him on a pedestal.
1311164054484987905 2020-09-30 12:40:45 +0800 <JoeC1776> Grandma killer has been an incompetent disaster, but "are you drunk" is the best you got. Pathetic.
1311159564931346432 2020-09-30 12:22:55 +0800 <JoeC1776> @PoliticalShort @sistertoldjah Apparently the twelve POS racists with tiki torches are much more dangerous than thousands of violent Antifa and BLM rioting iand destroying numerous cities.
1311159019436990464 2020-09-30 12:20:45 +0800 <JoeC1776> @sistertoldjah Jake Tapper has exposed himself as the garbage, biased hack he is since being on CNN.
1311156741787316225 2020-09-30 12:11:42 +0800 <JoeC1776> He was in corrupt business deals with China, Russia and Ukraine while his dad was VP, but nothing to see here, right, Johnny?
1311156400559718400 2020-09-30 12:10:20 +0800 <JoeC1776> @KaySpeshel @Jimi971 I was 8. The guy has been in the Senate almost my entire life and hasn't fixed squat, including as VP, but now we're supposed to believe he's gonna make everything right. Senile, creepy Joe needs go back to his basement, permanently.
1311138937256194048 2020-09-30 11:00:57 +0800 <JoeC1776> @ProudoftheUSA I shut them off several years ago, one of the best decisions I made, cable news is trash, including FNC, which I admit I watched a lot of prior to that. Same for talk radio.
1311137865741611008 2020-09-30 10:56:41 +0800 <JoeC1776> Fuckin-a, a statement I can get behind. The only problem is that white supremacists have been mostly wiped out, and rightly so, while Antifa and BLM are rioting and causing massive amounts of destructing in numerous cities.
1311136848455127043 2020-09-30 10:52:39 +0800 <JoeC1776> I clearly should've consumed more booze during that shit show. Biden lied almost every time he opened his mouth or was begging Wallace to help him, which Wallace obliged, along w/ spending far too much time debating Trump. Not making excuses for Trump but it was two against one.
1311135304934449155 2020-09-30 10:46:31 +0800 <JoeC1776> cc: Fox News Sunday aka Chris (the worst debate moderator since Candy Crowley) Wallace.
1311134069896470528 2020-09-30 10:41:36 +0800 <JoeC1776> Nah, Candy Crowley is still worse, but he was was awful.
1311133936882454528 2020-09-30 10:41:04 +0800 <JoeC1776> The sad part is, Chris Wallace who spent a lot of the night debating Trump while clearing the way for Biden is likely to be the most fair to Trump, the moderators are only likely to get worse. #Debates2020 #debates
1311132508558430208 2020-09-30 10:35:24 +0800 <JoeC1776> Mass mail in ballots are ripe for fraud and ballot harvesting. Vote on election day or get an absentee ballot. Mail in ballots should die in a fire. End this insanity. #Debates2020 #debates
1311130519829127169 2020-09-30 10:27:30 +0800 <JoeC1776> This is the problem with Wallace, he's been debating Trump while opening the floor for Biden. #Debates2020 #debates
1311130177750130693 2020-09-30 10:26:08 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden thinks building energy efficient homes will change the weather. Moron. #Debates2020 #debates
1311129966516502528 2020-09-30 10:25:18 +0800 <JoeC1776> Where the hell is this money coming from? Biden thinks we have a bottomless pit of money. #Debates2020
1311129143912865793 2020-09-30 10:22:02 +0800 <JoeC1776> Renewable energy is unreliable, see California which now had rolling blackouts. That is what Biden is proposing. #Debates2020

1311127923840167937 2020-09-30 10:17:11 +0800 <JoeC1776> And Wallace just lets it go.
1311127746345656323 2020-09-30 10:16:28 +0800 <JoeC1776> Bullshit, the middle class was growing and becoming wealthier before the Chinese virus. Biden is a garbage being and liar. #Debates2020
1311126035765825561 2020-09-30 10:09:41 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden defends riots from his violent supporters by blaming them on Trump. Holy shit, that is unbelievable. #Debates2020
1311125191687319552 2020-09-30 10:06:19 +0800 <JoeC1776> Holy shit, Biden brings up the environment as threatening suburbs while his base, ANTIFA/BLM are rioting and destroying cities across the country. #Debates2020
1311123660527329280 2020-09-30 10:00:14 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden's party used the filibuster to block police reform. #Debates2020
1311122893888204800 2020-09-30 09:57:12 +0800 <JoeC1776> Trump rightly nails creepy Joe for his 94 crime bill. #Debates2020
1311122678594646016 2020-09-30 09:56:20 +0800 <JoeC1776> Guy who said Romney was going to put people back in chains talking about racial division. Fuck off creepy Joe. #Debates2020
1311121395984850946 2020-09-30 09:51:14 +0800 <JoeC1776> Wherein Wallace tries to come to Biden's defense. Pathetic. #Debates2020
1311120925786542080 2020-09-30 09:49:22 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden is lying about manufacturing, but that's to be expected. #Debates2020
1311120401330769921 2020-09-30 09:47:17 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden admits he will raise taxes. #Debates2020
1311120231759253508 2020-09-30 09:46:37 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden was in office 47 years, he helped write and pass the tax laws on the books, don't whine cause Trump's accountants took advantage of them. #Debates2020
1311119131220086784 2020-09-30 09:42:14 +0800 <JoeC1776> I'm wondering the same thing.
1311118600779030528 2020-09-30 09:40:08 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden is beginning to slip.
1311118516708429824 2020-09-30 09:39:48 +0800 <JoeC1776> Agree with Trump, its insane that states are still closed 6 months after the two weeks to flatten the curve. #Debates2020

1311116143667666944 2020-09-30 09:30:22 +0800 <JoeC1776> Biden comes out as an anti-vaxxer and refuses to say whether he'd pack the courts. #Debates2020
1311113935752515584 2020-09-30 09:21:36 +0800 <JoeC1776> The American people should know whether Biden intends to pack the court and who he would nominate. #Debates2020

To my pleasant surprise he has delivered, from SCOTUS pics, to tax cuts, to isolating terrorist states while ushering in normalization agreements between Arab countries and Israel.

1307680124880347141 2020-09-20 21:56:51 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire I think a federal law should be passed outlawing ballot harvesting and restricting voting to a two week window leading up to Election Day. Within that states can set up their laws. What‚Äôs happening no with both is not only insane, with the harvesting it‚Äôs ripe for fraud...
1307675974973218818 2020-09-20 21:40:22 +0800 <JoeC1776> @Dawnsfire I agree. I have no problem with absentee within a short window before Election Day. But the two month early voting is insane. Wondering how many will regret their vote before Election Day as more information comes out, or events occur like RGBs passing.

1307341121727664129 2020-09-19 23:29:47 +0800 <JoeC1776> Ordered a new one, but did an upgrade, had no idea there was a wireless rechargeable model. No more going through AA batteries like they're going out of style. Ordered a new keyboard too, for the same reason. Love the wireless feature, hate the insane apatite for batteries.
1307340580733808640 2020-09-19 23:27:38 +0800 <JoeC1776> Lessons in how to crack the surface of your trackpad. It stop clicking when you press on it, so of course you pick it up &amp; bang on it. Isn't that how you fix pretty much anything that stops working? ;) The action results in surface being cracked, but the left click works again.

1307314123299074048 2020-09-19 21:42:30 +0800 <JoeC1776> Creepy Joe is not a serious candidate. He hides in his basement most of the time, takes few Qs from media, and when he does, it's mostly from friendly butt kissing media, where he's somehow able to use a Telepromter to answer, almost like he had the Qs ahead of time.

1307160157781209095 2020-09-19 11:30:42 +0800 <JoeC1776> As I just said, all the left has to do is not be insane... they just can't do it.

But dems like you can't help but issue threats, as if you wouldn't demand the seat were filled if the situation were reversed. Sit down, you POS partisan hack.

1306174545305440256 2020-09-16 18:14:13 +0800 <JoeC1776> They're just jealous cause the most support they manage to rally is a handful of people. Zero enthusiasm for creepy Joe.

1306068184823402496 2020-09-16 11:11:35 +0800 <JoeC1776> The left and NYer want direct democracy, aka mob rule. We got it already. The founding fathers wisely set up a system to avoid that.
1306067543451369477 2020-09-16 11:09:02 +0800 <JoeC1776> The left, aka Biden voters are a classy bunch.
1306066921553571848 2020-09-16 11:06:34 +0800 <JoeC1776> @PolitiBunny Wont be surprised if Saudi makes peace with Israel soon, which will apply more pressure to Islamists like Iran and the Palestinians. The more countries that follow suit, the more isolated Iran becomes. This is good thing. But "stunt" or something. @PoliticTammer
1306065252296032256 2020-09-16 10:59:56 +0800 <JoeC1776> They are winning no hearts and minds, and are likely turning supporters against them. Wouldn't be surprised if some of them don't vote Trump/repub due to this kind of shit dems support.

In 2020 I will enthusiastically vote for him and repubs down the line. Dems have proven they cannot stop being insane and radical. And a lot of their supporters, violent.
