1338868800603660291 2020-12-15 23:29:31 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I think DJT knew he wasn‚Äôt going to win when case after case was lost. We as a nation don‚Äôt want votes taken off the board that could Disenfranchise many who did it correctly. DJT is going to declassify and expose as much corruption he can, let the chips fall where they may.

1338290330597269506 2020-12-14 09:10:53 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @baseballcrank You mean if you have glasses. :-)
1338288869205217281 2020-12-14 09:05:05 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Pediatric one at that. Whole different ballgame.
1338262555404476417 2020-12-14 07:20:31 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @lorenb your info removing Chrome worked. Thanks
1338225506328719361 2020-12-14 04:53:18 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Can‚Äôt imagine that the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù seizing of assets, if we are to believe that the 2018 EO is in play, is going to play well with the stock market. If they are publicly traded companies people will want to pull their $$$ out. How does that work??
1338172061987074049 2020-12-14 01:20:56 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Believe all women right!?! LOL if proven.
1338017650220339200 2020-12-13 15:07:21 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Turning Texas blue.
1337907734335938560 2020-12-13 07:50:35 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> That he was appointed by DJT means nothing. Plenty of R‚Äôs out there despise DJT but have no problem using him as vehicle to further their careers.
1337903516157874179 2020-12-13 07:33:49 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Isn‚Äôt his son involved with Ukraine?
1337890276292120579 2020-12-13 06:41:13 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeah. Not happy with today‚Äôs effort.
1337867270014562304 2020-12-13 05:09:48 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeap!
1337580163341701121 2020-12-12 10:08:56 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeap
1337558936887697410 2020-12-12 08:44:35 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Best take of the day.
1337555844834144256 2020-12-12 08:32:18 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> The court stopped being independent a long time ago. Stacking it now just finishes the job.
1337553636700766211 2020-12-12 08:23:32 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> They don‚Äôt have the spine to throw out an election no matter how tainted it is. That brings up another issue. Many on the Left want the EC abolished. The state legislatures not acting to enforce the USC because the cheating was that bad basically neuters the EC.
1337553635459346433 2020-12-12 08:23:31 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Few people will understand the reasoning for SCOTUS to turn down the TX suit. But people will understand what the final move is. The states are in a tough spot here. Enforce the the USC if they feel the cheating was that bad or let it stand. I predict the latter.
1337551206760255488 2020-12-12 08:13:52 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> No. Please stop with this.
1337541838937460736 2020-12-12 07:36:39 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Told you SCOTUS wants nothing to do with this. They had their fill in 2000.
1337520214418845698 2020-12-12 06:10:43 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Thanks @BilldeBlasio #asshole
1337203360588574721 2020-12-11 09:11:39 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Canada is not our friend in the bigger picture. Only during the Iran crisis did they look out for us , but that was one ambassador.
1337105921584074754 2020-12-11 02:44:28 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @ihatethemedia And no money for them then.
1337102924300873728 2020-12-11 02:32:33 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> That‚Äôs always their answer as more and more people move away.

1336028752246169602 2020-12-08 03:24:11 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I already buy Goya products. Guess I need to buy some more.
1336019665735315456 2020-12-08 02:48:05 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> This !!
1335994563987714050 2020-12-08 01:08:20 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> These judges don‚Äôt want these decisions on their plates. Easier to dismiss and kick it up to the next level than to rule in favor of the plaintiff and incur the wrath of the other side. Not surprised one bit.
1335982418860400642 2020-12-08 00:20:04 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @Wizard_Predicts He should not have taken the case then.
1335982342935093251 2020-12-08 00:19:46 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Like it or not. Many public officials that recognize as GOP are not fans of Trump. Especially Bushies. Do not be fooled by party affiliation pay attention to where they stand or rule on issues. Not surprised at all about the ruling in GA.
1335981828172369926 2020-12-08 00:17:43 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Expected.
1335710725818490883 2020-12-07 06:20:27 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Uhmmmmm
1335709884910809089 2020-12-07 06:17:07 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @tracybeanz Happens 99% of the time. I just scroll through. If its really ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù you‚Äôll know.
1335707742133215239 2020-12-07 06:08:36 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @PhyreGoldMAJIC Surprised she even agreed to an interview. Took her long enough to lawyer up.

1335374369753878530 2020-12-06 08:03:54 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @awstar11 He‚Äôs trying to get back into the GOPe.
1335372133975863297 2020-12-06 07:55:01 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> God. Some people really want bloodshed. Stupid is correct.
1335370688765583360 2020-12-06 07:49:16 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Must read.
1335365337454403590 2020-12-06 07:28:00 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Thank God it‚Äôs a free country where people can go wherever they want. Gumzilla can fuck off.
1335342024380313603 2020-12-06 05:55:22 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Wood appears to be as corrupt as those he is accusing.
1335293862051508226 2020-12-06 02:43:59 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I would call this emotion versus logic. Wood is all emotion at this point.
1335291766543671299 2020-12-06 02:35:40 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Clearly, no one is listening to what you have to say and they are ignoring your request. Maybe if you would‚Äôve shown a  more forceful hand in the beginning they wouldn‚Äôt be ignoring you now. Just a thought.
1335259642625187842 2020-12-06 00:28:01 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> A lot of them need to be primaried.
1335242032084824067 2020-12-05 23:18:02 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> This
1335241792657174528 2020-12-05 23:17:05 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @davereaboi @SecStudiesGrp Not surprising. The GOPe did the same thing to the TeaParty. Use them for their worth, then discard them.
1335241149733367809 2020-12-05 23:14:32 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> There is no such thing.
1335238179931230210 2020-12-05 23:02:44 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Trying to stay relevant.
1335226320641548290 2020-12-05 22:15:36 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> LOL!! Love it!!
1335221118693756928 2020-12-05 21:54:56 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> This isn‚Äôt all on DJT. GOPe has some responsibility here too. A lot in fact! Not seeing them lighting any fires under asses. GOPe would prefer DJT go away he served his purpose and they are ready to move on. That‚Äôs pretty clear.
1335218711234568194 2020-12-05 21:45:22 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs a hypocritical asshole.
1335109746148294658 2020-12-05 14:32:23 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @BlondeJustice5 @shipwreckedcrew Yes, I guess we‚Äôll see.
1335040208706940930 2020-12-05 09:56:04 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @BlondeJustice5 @shipwreckedcrew Yes, but SCOTUS has been activist of late.
1335038213287768066 2020-12-05 09:48:08 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @Cernovich @UrUnpaidPundit @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs if he wins.
1335037551686594561 2020-12-05 09:45:30 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> God you‚Äôre such a fucking drama queen. Cuomo got you on a leash gumzilla?
1335034135396675584 2020-12-05 09:31:56 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @HulluSasha @RealJudasGoat Agreed. Many aren‚Äôt old enough to know.
1335033963635765248 2020-12-05 09:31:15 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> The chaos is starting to ramp up. I‚Äôm beginning to think that DJT is less concerned about staying in office than he is blowing it up on the way out. üçøüçø
1334973714220322823 2020-12-05 05:31:50 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @shipwreckedcrew Been saying it for a while. SCOTUS wants nothing to do with this.
1334971942231830528 2020-12-05 05:24:48 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> And visa‚Äôs for foreign workers. Don‚Äôt forget the visa‚Äôs!

1334638991400955904 2020-12-04 07:21:46 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @Wizard_Predicts Thank our public school system. Civics and the US Constitution test haven‚Äôt been taught in decades.
1334631481575170048 2020-12-04 06:51:56 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Nobody cares.
1334597289323737106 2020-12-04 04:36:04 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @C_3C_3 @GaSecofState @GovKemp More than that needs to happen to them.
1334595789654470656 2020-12-04 04:30:06 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Just a few.
1334512449052176386 2020-12-03 22:58:56 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Revoke his pardon
1334323418112679939 2020-12-03 10:27:48 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Bold move, but this is where it was always headed.
1334300115910209538 2020-12-03 08:55:12 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Disgusting

1334263890805448704 2020-12-03 06:31:15 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> There is going to be a bloodletting within the GOPe. DJT is going to rake them. It will start off slow then pick up steam. People are pissed.

1334250365483700229 2020-12-03 05:37:30 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @johncardillo @realDonaldTrump They want their 15min of fame to blow it up. Hard pass.
1334243718564634627 2020-12-03 05:11:06 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> He loves him his 15 minutes of fame.

1334223375212945414 2020-12-03 03:50:15 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> If voters in GA take Powell‚Äôs advice about not voting ‚Äúunless their vote is secure‚Äù then they get what they deserve. Powell is officially off the reservation.

1333192979150999557 2020-11-30 07:35:50 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> So DJT says a lot of stuff is coming out next that will shock us all and yet he says the DOJ is MIA. I'm sure more election stuff will come out but we've seen so much is anyone really going to be shocked? seems like a shell game to me. Guess we'll see.

1333131257899782148 2020-11-30 03:30:34 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> GOP Establishment will treat MAGA like the Tea Party. They do that at their peril.
1333097136766980097 2020-11-30 01:14:59 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> It‚Äôs a possibility, but a lot to bite off at one time.

1332077255032528897 2020-11-27 05:42:21 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yes. But it‚Äôs like he failed to see the overreach that the governor (and Mayor) have done in the past. I‚Äôm probably wrong but the conservative wing was going to not going to let it happen again.

1331213277876154369 2020-11-24 20:29:12 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Some of us are of the activist mindset but most are not. Most do their civic duty when it comes to voting.

People are more worried about being locked down now than what a Biden admin might do to them later. Seems legit. Have to live in the here and now.
1331207965794242560 2020-11-24 20:08:06 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> The longer this takes the more people will start to accept a Biden win. It‚Äôs the flip side to the coin. We keep hearing this going to drop or that is going to drop, a tease here a tease and still nothing. Lots of wild speculation.

1330914823832555520 2020-11-24 00:43:15 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I look at it this way. I‚Äôm not going to worry about any of this until Inauguration Day. If DJT team has the goods so be it.

1328008822833745924 2020-11-16 00:15:51 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> One other thing. If it‚Äôs really so massive why say anything? Lock the case up and let it drop.

I also think that if he loses he will burn the Brits and the Aussies for their roll in the dossier. #ScorchedEarth

1327377190984568832 2020-11-14 06:25:58 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Long game is to win more state legislatures and a majority in Congress to get some amendments added to the Constitution. Voter ID etc.
1327376848771293184 2020-11-14 06:24:36 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I care less about DJT winning than I do about fixing this shitty system.

No HRC emails even tho Pompeo said they would be released before 11/3. While it‚Äôs early in the recount process it‚Äôs getting late in the game and I‚Äôm not sure releasing it now even helps. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1326878968037990403 2020-11-12 21:26:12 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> You‚Äôre a big part of the reason GA is in the mess that it‚Äôs in with not doing a better job regarding mail in ballots.
1326871125163323392 2020-11-12 20:55:02 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I‚Äôm pretty much done watching all the news until something really breaks. Lots of speculation and innuendo right now. It‚Äôs still way early yet so I‚Äôm not discouraged but it‚Äôs kind of boring until the rumored bombs drop. If they drop at all.
1326871124173582337 2020-11-12 20:55:02 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I think some of their increased ratings is artificial. Like me it‚Äôs aüñïto Fox. But when this all dies down how do they keep their viewers with more live programming? Anyway, just some thoughts from the cheap seats.
1326871123301199872 2020-11-12 20:55:02 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> They need a live 6am weekday show. Very few are turning them on Sunday mornings for their religious programming, so I would dump that and get more live programming.
1326871122223239168 2020-11-12 20:55:02 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I know everyone is on the @newsmax kick, but like I did with Fox, I only watch certain programs. They have a long way to go. A lot of folks jumped from Fox to Newsmax to send a message but that doesn‚Äôt make them better. I think they need to step up their game.
1326736667491917825 2020-11-12 12:00:45 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Enough talk. Time put the cards on the table.

1325784221995167752 2020-11-09 20:56:05 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> If DJT runs out the clock and uses the state legislatures to get elected it‚Äôs going to be hell out there. Gonna be a ton of calls for new constitutional amendments to ‚Äúfix this‚Äù. And everyone will finally learn some civics.

1324715532445229058 2020-11-06 22:09:29 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Nothing is over until DJT concedes. I‚Äôm not seeing that happening any time soon, so keep your powder dry folks.
1324714958127587328 2020-11-06 22:07:12 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @RBPundit Yeap. A lot of whining out there. We aren‚Äôt even out of the first inning.

1324708480322883586 2020-11-06 21:41:28 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeap. Weak governor with no leadership.

1324492512317313024 2020-11-06 07:23:17 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Pretty sure this is just a counter to Biden‚Äôs remarks earlier.
1324491536952893440 2020-11-06 07:19:24 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @sethjlevy Yeap. Kind of quiet now though.
1324487796694941702 2020-11-06 07:04:33 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @IngrahamAngle They are going to steal it.
1324486615331471365 2020-11-06 06:59:51 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> DJT making remarks from WH this evening. I would be FUCKING STUNNED if he concedes. Need to hold the line here folks.

1324482581438570497 2020-11-06 06:43:49 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I mean after a while it gets tedious. Nothing ever drops. My favorite was last week that all sorts stuff was going to happen 3 days before the election. #Crickets
1324476165545992192 2020-11-06 06:18:20 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I know DJT is counter puncher but its getting close to the wire here. So pull the pin on whatever you have up your sleeve.
1324475703040102402 2020-11-06 06:16:29 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @Jim_Jordan Then fucking do something.
1324471339802103816 2020-11-06 05:59:09 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @FoxNews calling PA for Biden is just perfect. Get woke go broke. Cocktail parties await.

1324469479355666432 2020-11-06 05:51:45 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Remember, @KarlRove is a Bushy and part of the swamp. Remover that when you hear him speak.

1324461459892568065 2020-11-06 05:19:53 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yes. But I refuse to accept a ‚Äú Patriot Act‚Äù type solution to address these issues. Been there, done that.

1324455346597933056 2020-11-06 04:55:36 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Remember, Lindsey was McCain‚Äôs butt boy. Old habits die hard.

1324454544387035137 2020-11-06 04:52:25 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Lindsey and Mitch have no problem with DJT losing. They got theirs.

1324020155899351044 2020-11-05 00:06:18 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeah
1324019410126983168 2020-11-05 00:03:21 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeap. They no different than the others now.
1323998119617564677 2020-11-04 22:38:45 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> They better not or the electorate will stay home in the next cycle.
1323985903413506051 2020-11-04 21:50:12 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> This is how the legal challenge starts. This will end up in PA SC only to go to SCOTUS.
1323982705042870273 2020-11-04 21:37:29 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @CottoGottfried Heap. Just going to take a few days/weeks. We are now entering the hard part of game.
1323968163659264001 2020-11-04 20:39:43 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @ericbolling There was no red wave or silent voter wave either. That‚Äôs how you beat fraud.
1323965469901160448 2020-11-04 20:29:00 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> If Biden is elected I am more worried for my kids future. It‚Äôs sad that Americans have gotten so softy that they want the government to take care of them instead of doing it themselves.
1323963389845114880 2020-11-04 20:20:44 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yep
1323963022294032384 2020-11-04 20:19:17 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @NikkiUSA7 It‚Äôs more than that. The propaganda that both sides put out is a disservice to populous
1323959086388576259 2020-11-04 20:03:38 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> LOL!
1323948099556040710 2020-11-04 19:19:59 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @KenGardner11 So no Red Wave.
1323935574051479553 2020-11-04 18:30:13 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Talk about a ground game. FL knew how to court the Hispanic vote. TX and AZ GOP have a lot to learn.
1323935060593172481 2020-11-04 18:28:10 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Lots of people pining for HRC emails that we never released. Red meat for the base but ultimately DOA.
1323934723144601600 2020-11-04 18:26:50 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Lots of fake pundits out there with their different theories about things that never do to fruition. Insider source here or there but nothing ever solid comes forward.
1323933161554935808 2020-11-04 18:20:37 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> I‚Äôve heard a million times that they couldn‚Äôt cheat if it was close. Where was this red wave that was supposed to crush it.
1323793764360605697 2020-11-04 09:06:42 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Uh huh.
1323785920211013635 2020-11-04 08:35:32 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Don't watch Fox

1323695354064347136 2020-11-04 02:35:40 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Leave nothing to chance.

DJT needs to do his job (he will nominate a candidate) the Senate needs to do their job (they will vote on said candidate).

1307119310121439232 2020-09-19 08:48:23 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> This is why any Senator saying DJT should wait (Murk, Sue, Mitt) should not be serving in office, Their job is to advise and consent. Vote no if you want but either way be counted.
1307116048626397184 2020-09-19 08:35:25 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Lots of weak kneed people out there.
1307114259281838081 2020-09-19 08:28:19 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @RBPundit Yeap! Bring it!!
1307113313244008449 2020-09-19 08:24:33 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeap, so I am not going to fell bad if Mitch does the same.
1307112909798023168 2020-09-19 08:22:57 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Kind of important, but the chattering class and TDS folks will ignore.
1307112730135011329 2020-09-19 08:22:14 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> again, why wouldn‚Äôt he? He nominates, the Senate is in charge of the confirmation. Its up to Mitch to get the votes in line.
1307111253073170434 2020-09-19 08:16:22 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Susan Collins has a decision to make and I‚Äôm not sure she has the stones to be tough in a tight race.
1307110796313399296 2020-09-19 08:14:33 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Seems kind of simple. DJT nominates a candidate and lets the Senate do their thing. if DJT stays quiet there is no heat on him. Mitch is a big boy, so he can handle the heat.
1307109461765558279 2020-09-19 08:09:15 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> It will get worse this time around.

1301328997406724101 2020-09-03 09:19:45 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Gonna be a long night in DC
1301327355668029440 2020-09-03 09:13:13 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Ethan Strauss isn't exactly conservative.
1301207867341582342 2020-09-03 01:18:25 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> LOL!
1301201522823434241 2020-09-03 00:53:12 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @ihatethemedia @BreitbartNews Fair point.
1301200865236332545 2020-09-03 00:50:36 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @BreitbartNews Nobody really like LeBron anymore outside of the sport.
1301200098957950982 2020-09-03 00:47:33 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Tweet of the day here! ‚§µÔ∏è Amazing that our chattering class still ignores the EC or tries to justify something different to suit their narrative.
1300934104813383685 2020-09-02 07:10:35 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Yeah, the system is too rigged for a common folk type guy to run let alone win. Too much money at stake for the different political machines.
1300900902971334658 2020-09-02 04:58:39 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @PolAgnostic No, but I still think the UN is a bit much.
1300894219473760257 2020-09-02 04:32:06 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> ü§î
1300893644174569473 2020-09-02 04:29:48 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @PolAgnostic I‚Äôd laugh. The UN has no standing here. DJT wouldn‚Äôt allow it.
1300890981915602945 2020-09-02 04:19:14 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Gee, really?!?
1300886292956418049 2020-09-02 04:00:36 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> He will delay.
1300877250276077570 2020-09-02 03:24:40 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> Is this The Onion?
1300869126517395458 2020-09-02 02:52:23 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @PolAgnostic Less than 5% chance on insurrection charges and zero chance Biden‚Äôs are extradited.
1300848825033256960 2020-09-02 01:31:43 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> If Trump loses (doubtful at this point) Flynn will be pardoned.
1300842285857464326 2020-09-02 01:05:44 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @ihatethemedia I‚Äôm happy to be proven wrong but that‚Äôs what it looks like. If had that power to do this all along what took these guys so long?
1300841523836313604 2020-09-02 01:02:42 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> What took so long? This is not like these guys are a new thing.  Glad he‚Äôs doing it now, but it looks like the harassment he received last week was the catalyst. Not the best look to me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1300599892482682882 2020-09-01 09:02:33 +0800 <2NinerSavoy> @BigJoeBastardi May not matter.
