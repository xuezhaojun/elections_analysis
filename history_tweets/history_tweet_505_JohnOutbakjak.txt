Trump conversely has made many foretelling tweets with uncanny accuracy because that IS his style. I agree with Lin on this one.

Logic tells me that it wouldn't pass muster by the Dems in any event, in case of a situation ..."enemies foreign or domestic", because Trump's duty then would be to uphold the Constitution.
1343724864645951488 2020-12-29 09:05:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dwmzmm I should have asked you first! You're an ol' space junkie from way back.

1343721133862895617 2020-12-29 08:50:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown @South72Trump I ask a lot of questions. Here's one you may know, because I don't. Does Trump signing the Covid Bill yesterday, negate his ability to enforce the Insurrection Act, because the Dems has sneaked that provision in there prior to this?
1343714716128927745 2020-12-29 08:25:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown I posed a question. That's why I asked it.

He’s ready to send 2K today, now this moment without the added 5,000+ pages of Pork. Despicable Socialist.

I don’t think he could ever walk down a public street again with any confidence. He would ruin any chance at Potus 2024.

The lead character “ Jack Bauer” had to infiltrate a group and the test question was: “ What are we?”, Jacks correct answer: “we’re Patriots!”.
1343035166415974400 2020-12-27 11:25:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JonMutoza I’ll say this. At the end of this saga, Trump will know where Every single person stands.

1342932913684316161 2020-12-27 04:38:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CuriousRabitt @cftn77 Just for sake of discussion, assume for a moment that Melissa was hired only to clean glass etc. Why then would that negate her ability to see &amp; hear what was going on? This is a special type of Liberal Arrogance on display here from Dominion.

This could “maybe” go out to Mar 4th, based on some research. Words “Election like no other”, keep ringing in my head.

I do believe in Peace on Earth, I do believe in Protecting all children, as they are innocent, but I’ll be damned to let this Election get stolen from us, particularly since Trump WON, in a Landslide. 🇺🇸🤠
1342568633277378561 2020-12-26 04:31:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher ...too long! I’m okay with it, it’s the folks out of work, locked out, stressed out due to The Plandemic, that’s a BIG issue for me.

1342546932120502273 2020-12-26 03:05:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown Here’s a thought...just HOW did Joe Biden win his Primaries, as he was coming in near dead last until his miracle comeback? Just who counted those stinking Votes?

1338199559470661634 2020-12-14 03:10:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Honestly, I used to have great hope for a Dominion type system. However when you get a total radical  communist like Eric Coomer stating on the record that he can fix it at midnight, with the flip of switch, it breaks the link of the chain. It’s over.
1338198781049753600 2020-12-14 03:07:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Amen!
1338197940779696128 2020-12-14 03:03:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Beijing didn’t win.
1338196793180372992 2020-12-14 02:59:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown @realDonaldTrump @X4Rose Figure of speech, to outline a possibility. If such &amp; such wins, then this is likely to occur, type of statement. I thought it was well stated &amp; predictive. Trump’s old tweets have been VERY predictive.
1338195245251489792 2020-12-14 02:53:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He probably did win! Who is EVER going to trust ELECTRONIC Voting again?
1338193689395412992 2020-12-14 02:46:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ORGANlCROBOT @WordSpkr Correct.
1338192053662990336 2020-12-14 02:40:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Trin20201 Was it on TV? Was it recorded, as I would like to go back &amp; watch? Trump answered perfectly nonetheless as it was a typing partisan hack trying to ask a loaded “gotcha” question. The Democrats should just call themselves “ The Gotcha Party”, it’s all they do.
1338191271211384832 2020-12-14 02:37:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @WordSpkr I am a student of History. Not everyone likes to study it, but I like it to learn from the past, to prevent a bad future, whilst living in the NOW.

1338186970233630720 2020-12-14 02:20:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @doqholliday Fair enough. Just found it an “odd” comment. Also, if he had nothing to fear or hide, he’s run off like a little rabbit this morning. Carry on. We have an Election to finalize! 🇺🇸🤠🇺🇸
1338186314114498560 2020-12-14 02:17:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow That’s already starting. Patriots should be able to walk down the street without getting a hat knocked off. It’s really that simple.
1338185686059372544 2020-12-14 02:15:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @doqholliday How come John Reese’s last tweet, said he needs to make his account smaller? Who in the Hell does that? I just found that a real weird “off” comment?

1338023843294658561 2020-12-13 15:31:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Navarre_RN That’s changing too in ways. I can’t begin to tell you of folks I personally know that work from home now Remotely, with “ Zoom” type communications &amp; also moving to other States. Facebook &amp; Guulag now want to pay them less for the privilege.
1338022330358845442 2020-12-13 15:25:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @anejills Also, note where it says, is the game being played ‘Public’ or ‘Private’. IMO 80% at least is being played Private, behind the scenes with Armies of Legal pulling all nighters.
1338019909737930752 2020-12-13 15:16:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Ted’s tweet was so good it wasn’t worthy of my added comment. That old expression of the straw breaking the Camels back is in play here. That last tax increase, the gas taxes, the Perpetual unnecessary lockdowns, supporting Antifa thugs. Add it up &amp; there is your disaster.

He’s been consistent on that issue since 1986. Plenty of videos will confirm that. Are you aware of the deals Joe Biden did with China/Ukraine? Through his son &amp; brother. Plenty of evidence there but CNN did try to bury it. I can prove that too.

1337824056356216834 2020-12-13 02:18:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @prophetamerica You’re correct. It’s only lately that that EO has been discussed. The good news is that the people who really need to know about it are very aware of. Folks like Sidney Powell, Lin Wood etc. That’s when it will come into play.

( same as Hunters laptop we got the info) Trump Team knew about Foreign Interference on Election Eve ( NSA/DoD) &amp; I’m sure b4 with Intel chatter. Trump’s a patient man in many ways. We are not.
1337818204236746753 2020-12-13 01:54:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @gretchenbarton We saw it on America’s Voice Network. We get that ‘free’ on  https://t.co/keIqrXJ5mu ( I don’t work for them) Also I have America’s Voice as free app on my iPhone.
1337817353812234241 2020-12-13 01:51:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @IdahoJim_ I’m hinting the other side ( them) know something is afoot. Even now Kamala Harris hasn’t quit her position. There’s more to it obviously.

1337813890390843392 2020-12-13 01:37:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Did anyone see “The Invasion of the Body Snatchers”? They’re here. They landed. They live in the Pacific North West.  https://t.co/B5OwHDJsK7
1337810378034536448 2020-12-13 01:23:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Gen. Flynn just completed an amazing rally in DC. President Trump circled in Marine 1 a few times. Gen. Flynn also stated that Donald Trump will be the next President 100%. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

1337676594077261824 2020-12-12 16:32:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> From a pure Political perspective, &amp; I’ve said this before, men like Trump only come along once every 500-1000 years. So here we are at a unique crossroads in our timeline of history, to have a special Star formation on 12-21-20, first in 800 years. Other Heavenly aspects also!  https://t.co/XovRiWRygC

1337657842757595138 2020-12-12 15:17:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow I didn’t hear Trump say Military would do distributions, in that it would be up to each individual state? Let me know if you heard otherwise please?
1337657269643702272 2020-12-12 15:15:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SethAbramson No worse than your 300+ threads. I’ll wait &amp; see how you react at the end. We’ll see.

One of them was Abraham Lincoln’s who also took the Oath to defend against Enemies Foreign &amp; Domestic. Lincoln took extraordinary measures to uphold his Oath.

1337506505545797632 2020-12-12 05:16:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Purely from the viewpoint of *Sociology I haven’t seen any Dems expressing a willingness to die for Joe Biden. Conversely many Patriots have expressed a willingness to go all the way &amp; die for Donald Trump over the Rigged Election. Just an observation.  https://t.co/aN7eRXqtc8

1337444171007684610 2020-12-12 01:08:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The fact that the media have tried to tell you Biden is more popular than Trump is the second greatest lie told this Century! The First greatest lie is Biden got more Votes!
1337443577064910849 2020-12-12 01:06:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Imagine if you will that Trump &amp; Joe Biden were rock groups. Trump has played to sold out stadiums &amp; sold millions of records. This fkn communist media has tried to gaslight you into believing Biden has a better voice &amp; sold more records. Biden is Garage Band &amp; sounds like shit!
1337442234401058817 2020-12-12 01:00:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dporter721 There was zero love or admiration for him in social media, from the people on his side. I’ve looked.

1337232464557662210 2020-12-11 11:07:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We live in very interesting times as this whole Election issue is going to force all members of the Supreme Court to sh!t or get off of the pot. Trump has them also, because if they are compromised, they HAVE to show their hand. Will their loyalty be to China or US? Choose wisely
1337230520808194048 2020-12-11 10:59:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @littlehummer True. I use these terms for sake of simplicity.

1337229381425500160 2020-12-11 10:55:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TX_Justus I ran out of characters. Q would always say look here not there. As if: look to China, not Russia like Schiff bitched about...following along same lines..,Media looked at Qanon but missed the EO’s If that is the case, then brilliant strategy.

1337225325932027904 2020-12-11 10:38:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TX_Justus I also believe a lot of Q’s questions, writings, drops &amp; proofs are embodied in the EO’s. Call those ultimate Proofs if you will. The Media got fooled again by ‘accusing Qanon of being (?), but failed to see the EO’s. Much now to their peril.
1337223988968243202 2020-12-11 10:33:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Yup!
1337221489620209664 2020-12-11 10:23:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> A big problem is the Media/Big Tech suppressed all this evidence before the Election. That unto itself is Election Interference. They were warned not to, but couldn’t help themselves. They are now complicit under EO2018. Too bad. Too sad.

Not only that, he had the ‘vision’ to see the properties &amp; then what could be done with them.

For example, they all decry, “ No evidence of fraud”. The dead people alone on the existing Govt. Voter Rolls disprove this. Underage Voters...easy to prove. Low information people.

Personally I don’t think Patriots are going to let them act up too much. Things be different.
1336930055616749569 2020-12-10 15:05:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PamelaAnnSnyde2 @gatewaypundit That seems to be their plan, but I don’t see it happening. She hasn’t quit the Senate. If she were confident, she would have left by now.

I’m hoping Trump can pull off this Reversal, the Truth is on his side. Biden couldn’t even qualify to be a dog catcher. ( seriously he broke his foot!)

1336782943889461248 2020-12-10 05:21:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Sneakiest thing Trump can do is at 12 noon tomorrow is to suddenly find abandoned USPS Vans in Mi,Ga,Az,Pa &amp; Wi with 8 million ballots in his favor, backdated to 11/3. The Dems would cry “That’s Cheating!” Trump: “ ZERO evidence of fraud as ya’ll have maintained!”  https://t.co/3bFz1ojHj4

1336730292824858624 2020-12-10 01:51:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @tinabiggs2 Exactly. She knows it’s over. I think Joe Biden’s Cabinet is all Kabuki Theater. If the Democrats think they can Riot there way out of this “we aren’t gonna take it”. Leave it at that.
1336729781241430017 2020-12-10 01:49:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CreationsHour Dec 8th. You Tube are now banning all conservative talk about the Election because they consider it over. Twitter will probably follow suit.

1336726909233741824 2020-12-10 01:38:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Why is Kamala Harris still a Senator? Hasn’t she sailed past her Safe Harbor date? Maybe she knows something I don’t know?

I got past a lot of who they were a while ago (18 months ???), whereupon the Message was more important to me than the Messenger. Always have felt this past 4 years was about this Election.

1336466431458742273 2020-12-09 08:23:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I believe Gen Flynn was with 82nd Airborne Division. Probably just a coincidence. “A storm is coming.”  https://t.co/B1Tb4BKVEn
1336463993695703041 2020-12-09 08:13:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LandiaDan @GenFlynn It has. We were told they wouldn’t go down easy. I can’t give false hope, but we are on the side of Truth. Look at President Trump. Does he seen rattled? There is your answer, I believe.
1336462425403453442 2020-12-09 08:07:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow @GenFlynn Saw that. Double meanings can &amp; do exist but IMO, the Election is higher priority, for now.

1336236113778733057 2020-12-08 17:08:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Life is better without Cable TV. Life is great without FOX, they screwed me on Election Eve, won’t &amp; cannot forget. Other news sources have great anchors &amp; perspectives &amp; they are free! OANN, NewsMax, America’s Voice, War Room. Various YT’s &amp; us. Yep us. we are doing great!

1335978421571133440 2020-12-08 00:04:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1stChooseGod It should be a non event. If you’re at home, there is never any disagreement if some food has gone off in the fridge. You simply toss it out. These are tainted Votes, you toss them. No questions.
1335977043595468800 2020-12-07 23:58:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The fact that none of the States Election Commissions &amp; Governors don’t even throw out the Votes from dead people &amp; underage Voters is awfully suspicious. These should be an Automatic No Vote from both sides of the aisle. These are easy to prove. Not ONE Democrat disavows these?

1335784035566555138 2020-12-07 11:11:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @r8rsforlife Tell me if I’m wrong, but in this equilibrium the Dems best strategy was to cheat. In 2016 Hillary technically wasn’t supposed to lose. Unfortunately for the Dems, weak Biden wasn’t capable of the win, therefore stuff the ballots is the best strategy.

1335777887052419073 2020-12-07 10:47:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When the Democrats gamed this Election con out, did they really plan on Trump conceding? There is no EndGame, but many going to jail &amp; worse. It’s a colossal blunder. Watch them turn on each other. In Game Theory that is a terrible miscalculation.

1335686173503545351 2020-12-07 04:42:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dwmzmm He ( Trump ) told us quite clearly last night had he lost fairly, he would walk away, but since he “knows” he won in a Landslide due to access to NSA etc. no need to concede. This is why Biden doesn’t have access now to Mil. Intel briefings, because fraud facts implicate him.

1334903701861851136 2020-12-05 00:53:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @meander061 @HunterJCullen I’m happy here knowing Trump won. You tards are having a tough time accepting it. I hope you were not in on the Coup, the Attempt to steal a Federal Election, because as Traitors the penalty is death. Have a great day. I’m back to making America Great Again.
1334892575153561600 2020-12-05 00:09:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @meander061 @HunterJCullen Yes it did. You’ll see. You keep living in denial.

Most important one will be when he overturns the Fraudulent Election, by upholding his sworn Oath to the Constitution “...against all Enemies, Foreign &amp; Domestic”...”My fellow Americans”

1333980962904948737 2020-12-02 11:47:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RealJudasGoat Clever. I’ll delete my reply.
1333980754435395587 2020-12-02 11:46:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’ve always railed against the Democrats for having no real political platform. Was also suspicious this past few months when Adam Schiff was so quiet. It’s only my intuition in that he played a big part in organizing #TheGreatSteal He’s a creep &amp; a crook but criminally minded.
1333979341156347905 2020-12-02 11:40:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @therealpitts62 That answer could be a big Rabbit Hole. Looking Glass Technology&gt; Quantum Computers&gt; Game Theory. Straight out listening to the other side comms? Some of the predictions are mind blowing. The critics dismiss it broadly without studying it. Makes you think though.

1333665062175744000 2020-12-01 14:51:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Democrats have done some really crappy disgusting things these past few years. Russia/Mueller/ Impeachment Hoaxes. False witness Judge Kavanaugh. The “idea”of Antifa rioting &amp;looting, but this stealing the Election crosses the Line. Joe Biden will NEVER be fucking President!

1333603845587357696 2020-12-01 10:48:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The fact that all 5 battleground states stopped counting at the same time, “Demonstrates prior coordination by election officials in five battleground states.” Then they used HAMMER and Scorecard, plus Dominion, to move Joe Biden into the lead. It is a ‘mathematical impossibility

1333597889730285569 2020-12-01 10:24:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> To be sure though, The Dems were in on this one. The 4am ballot drops are your clues there. I do believe though Foreign influence will be proven to be a factor. Hunter Biden’s Laptop alone shows ties to China Bigly.

1333596338781515779 2020-12-01 10:18:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> ...so even though the Democrats think they won, a software switch in Germany linked to a Foreign Actor could have changed the outcome of a US Election. Trump has no recourse but to uphold The Constitution.
1333595667105603584 2020-12-01 10:15:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> On Election Eve when Trump/NSA/Homeland Security &amp; DOD are watching Votes being transferred from Trump to Biden in RealTime, how do we know it wasn’t Iranians or China.

The 80 million Votes are shown only by the Democrats  who have cheated. The Fraud is being proven. Beyond that you are out of your league. You have no idea. You are not in the know.
1332969033386246144 2020-11-29 16:45:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Mareq16 Agreed. This is a tough period of time for all info now. No cliche, but it is Information Warfare. Trump's tweets are very telling. His one about Biden not having the 80 mill. Votes is a Marker to me.
1332968286246473728 2020-11-29 16:42:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Mareq16 Been here for 5 years now. Rarely, if ever any of the predictive dates ever pan out. Not saying NEVER, but extremely rare.

1332958408056573952 2020-11-29 16:03:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @realRobertBiden Trump is NOT going to make a statement about Biden not having the 80 million Votes if he can't back it up.
1332957086565613568 2020-11-29 15:58:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @realRobertBiden Trump will show that Biden doesn't have the votes. I was using Poker as an analogy. You see in this "game" Trump is accusing them of cheating, &amp; he will prevail, because they did.
1332956320580866048 2020-11-29 15:55:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @patrisia_pol He doesn't need to. Correct.
1332951410971840512 2020-11-29 15:35:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Don't the Dems realize they are fkg with the wrong guy? Trump owned 5 Casinos FFS &amp; is calling Biden's bluff. Show me your 80 million fkn Votes? Gunfight at the OK Corral. Trump didn't do 4-5 rallies a day in cold weather, get Covid, to have these fuckers steal his  poker chips.
1332948742358503424 2020-11-29 15:25:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RobbersonJon Trump's tweet drops some bombshell clues. He's calling Biden's bluff.👇 https://t.co/pPaaUhIsNY
1332948171090132993 2020-11-29 15:23:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @realRobertBiden Spot on Robert. I think all will be revealed. See what I just retweeted on Trump. Trump dropped a bombshell tweet yesterday, with BIG clues.
1332947575108894721 2020-11-29 15:20:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Important, Trump is almost saying I will concede if these conditions are met. Trump's statement is BOLD, like Poker. He's calling Biden's bluff. Show me your 'winning' hand, he says. Next clue: He says (Biden) has a BIG unsolvable problem. in that, HE CAN'T PRODUCE THE VOTES.
1332945937728110592 2020-11-29 15:14:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @realRobertBiden Okay, I get it. I think Trump has all the info or goods on him. I think you are aware of the damaging information obtained on son Hunter's laptop.

1332941010066759681 2020-11-29 14:54:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @realRobertBiden Why are you stating like that? As in he's finished? This is still a process that you have to go through.
1332926642923028484 2020-11-29 13:57:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DarleneIronCity It’s beyond Gaslighting now to absolute pure F...B...S Innocent people simply say, sure take your time, investigate what you want. We are not seeing that here. Fortunately again, Trump is quite aware of the BS. God Bless that man for his Patience.
1332925132805869568 2020-11-29 13:51:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We are accusing the Democrats of using a corked bat &amp; juiced ball to win the World Series,  AKA The President. If you didn’t use a corked bat/juiced ball you have nothing to worry about. We are going to examine every bat, because demented Joe Biden didn’t win 80 million Votes!
1332923203103035394 2020-11-29 13:43:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dlynnleo Serious?
1332922953256763392 2020-11-29 13:42:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How do I know the Democrats cheated 100%? From Chuck Schumer, Kyle Griffin, the Celebrities, Blue Checks down to the peasants with 0-4 followers have ALL said, in lockstep, it’s over, nothing more to look at it. BULLCRAP, If you are NOT guilty of cheating, we look at the books.

1332838567073046529 2020-11-29 08:07:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I know the proof of Election Fraud is being revealed as we speak, but the real Proof is what we feel in our hearts.

All votes were being “recorded” as they were being taking from Trump &amp; added to Biden. No different to a CCTV in a 7/11. All this is done as a normal course of NAT SEC. So they “see”it &amp; also know “how”.

There is a limited window of time here for you to #WalkAwayfromFraud You admit you Voted for Biden, we will never understand as to why, but nonetheless he is your guy. Now you have found out about the Election Fraud walk away from it &amp; disavow it. Do it.

1332630013393289217 2020-11-28 18:18:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Oddly enough, none of these reporters have ever mentioned Trump’s EO 2018 about Election Interference &amp; it’s consequences. But please do keep up the Cool Cat Commie reporting. Trump played golf today, missed a put &amp; had a diet coke &amp; two scoops of ice cream.

I say he has the Black Box from Election Eve, where they were monitoring the Votes being changed in real time. It’s an actual recording. The NSA Monitor the Election under the auspices of NAT SEC - it has to be this way.

1332380850453843968 2020-11-28 01:48:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trackrat591 Agreed. If you read all the Lefty comments they believe Biden was just so popular to get 80 million votes &amp; of course they refuse to accept any evidence of a crime.

1332177479130251265 2020-11-27 12:20:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom Bookies put their money where there mouth is. It would be a great feature on Twitter, instant bets. Third party escrow holds the funds. Put up or shut up. 🤠 You would need the Escrow as Liberals welch on their bets.
1332176464595152896 2020-11-27 12:16:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ That’s what I had in mind. This guy is all over this. Has an account here &amp; knows about paper nano technologies. You probably follow him. Exclusive Interview: The Fight to Protect Your Vote with Lt. Colonel Ton...  https://t.co/hg1ae8TcGE via @YouTube
1332175106370543617 2020-11-27 12:11:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LarryBiggins Of course!
1332174615284645888 2020-11-27 12:09:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ Exactly same concept with our Currency. You can print a good copy but without the correct paper stock/ threads/ watermarks. It’s VERY complex what they can do. Even the fibers in the paper. Nano holes, Light filtration etc. etc.
1332173904547201025 2020-11-27 12:06:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LarryBiggins Depends where you live. This time NG. will step in immediately. No more games.
1332173608861384704 2020-11-27 12:05:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom Yes. Notice they are not paying out. Our family tried to place a bet on Trump via (Predict. It) wouldn’t take it. They were oversubscribed. ( They have to balance the bets for payout.)
1332172742079041536 2020-11-27 12:01:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ It’s very possible. We may never know at the Public Level exactly how, because then it becomes a NAT SEC issue. We’re thinking Russians/Chinese/Iran were going to hack the Election, not the friggin Democrats. They are a Domestic Enemy in my book.

1332168969327808512 2020-11-27 11:46:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LarryBiggins The MSM all have the same talking points, trying to sway a Court of Public opinion. It means nothing.
1332168297819762690 2020-11-27 11:44:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LarryBiggins Good Question. Many have thought about it. My take, they are so blinded in their hatred of Trump, they will take the win even if cheating. They cannot even look at facts. This I’ve noticed from the top down. Strange in a way. If our side did it we would disavow. It won’t work.

1332160587896291329 2020-11-27 11:13:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @daltonposse I didn’t read too much different except the fact it was “inserted” on Record. Maybe to remind everyone? That’s the best angle I have. Why do it otherwise? Trump’s been tweeting for months, watch out for Election Fraud.

All the naysayers reject, but don’t cite any proofs. Like a Liberal argument. Oh well. 🤷‍♂️
1332128827376496645 2020-11-27 09:07:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ Noticed the same thing. Only conclusion now is the projection from their end is so strong, they subconsciously know it’s over. They are at a point of denying a dead body on their front doorstep.

1331690744101277698 2020-11-26 04:06:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JoeBiden You might want to tune in to Donald Trump testifying now in Pennsylvania, instead.

1328399557969932288 2020-11-17 02:08:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I believe Sidney &amp; Donald Trump. They don’t make the Statements they did, if they cannot back it up.

1328374600552509446 2020-11-17 00:29:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Apparently not all the Left know yet they have lost? They will. Soon.

1328266470384492544 2020-11-16 17:19:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @donaldrusso994 Doesn't matter. Trump won. His EO of 2018 is going to be enforced. Any attempt ANY, to alter the outcome of the Election will nullify it. Trump also tweeted that out yesterday a case law in 1994 also. It's over. Not a good day to be Complicit Media as ALL assets will be seized.
1328264003387224067 2020-11-16 17:09:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dear Joe @JoeBiden now that you have lost we expect you to concede graciously. Remember, we are all Americans now &amp; this is a Time To Heal.

Now, if you are in on it, you can actually lose all your assets. If you want to know more feel free to DM me. Thanks for playing. To be blunt. GAME OVER.
1328262432343552001 2020-11-16 17:03:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Hippygi16992014 Nothing much. Trump won. It has to roll out because the MSM are Complicit. It's a deep sh!t type of thing.

1328243656856272896 2020-11-16 15:49:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Never bet against Donald Trump!
1328242682972442624 2020-11-16 15:45:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The whole time the Left/ Media were freaking out about Q &amp; Anons, they focused on us hard. Made big accusations. That’s okay. They not once focused on the EO’s, particularly the one from 2018. More of the genius of Q. Look here not there. Well that 2018 EO cost them the Election.

I’m thinking tomorrow of shoving the 2018 EO up liberals asses, because that’s the guts of the takedown. If you attempt to cheat or interfere in the outcome of an Election you lose! How perfect? 🤠
1328238624526139394 2020-11-16 15:29:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dannyshanor Oh I know. I’m just being super careful &amp; cautious. It’s going to be a little tricky but we’ll get through that part.
1328237096667021317 2020-11-16 15:22:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dannyshanor I get your comment, I really do, but we will have to cross that bridge. I think I know a few things that can happen but we advocate peace on our side, but we will defend family &amp; property.

1328223421914746880 2020-11-16 14:28:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MarkSZaidEsq We don’t give a flying fuck anymore we just won the Election. Thanks for playing. Game over to be blunt. Oh, if you were knowingly involved in the Treason to steal the Election, get some good representation. All assets can be seized.
1328222361997373440 2020-11-16 14:24:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He just stole  the Election back from us! No son, it’s a return of Stolen Property!
1328221635829121024 2020-11-16 14:21:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @gentXray He did. He warned them two years ago. I’ve studied those EO’s and they are works of Art. I’ve never heard the MSM mention any of them once! When he said : “I’ve caught ‘em all!” Well, he has!
1328220997053419521 2020-11-16 14:18:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When Fox stalled the Election Count on Nov 3rd, that was an attempt to [Knowingly] alter the Results of a Federal Election. See EO 2018. I predict the results will stand exactly at that moment. FOX Corporation for playing that stupid game will have all their assets seized!

1328165976592982016 2020-11-16 10:40:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This will end up being the Democrats undoing. Trump won by so much, the Democrats had to go into overdrive in the middle of the night to create millions of Votes. This is an easily provable statistical anomaly. A few only Votes they could have swung. Arrogance will be their fall.

We still have to “prove” our case, of which, I believe we will. She said earlier they have a “firehose” of Evidence.

1327823218258808832 2020-11-15 11:58:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DancingCurious No wonder Trump has had the world on his shoulders. It’s 65 days to Jan 20th, our guys are working triple overtime. The pace now is breathtaking.
1327822563104362496 2020-11-15 11:55:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RetVet2016 Bit of a bombshell. Just love the way she so casually drops that with her southern accent.
1327822172216147968 2020-11-15 11:54:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GM062616 I know this all ties into Trumps EO on Election interference. Geez, all my research today indicates these guys are stealing elections around the world. A real World Wide Web! Biden is in deep trouble.
1327821343841079297 2020-11-15 11:50:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GM062616 Thanks! I had just watched the video &amp; my jaw dropped.

To be aware. If Q had promised a second term we would have been complacent. Human Nature. Everyone, Patriots have worked their butts off. We were told,Good vs Evil.
1327501210639769600 2020-11-14 14:38:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> What I’d give for a true honest Election. Honestly, I don’t think Joe Biden got more than 17 Votes across the whole Country. No one liked that old goat.
1327498983904739334 2020-11-14 14:29:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Q never gave us a lock on the Election. By that I mean qteam didn’t predict an Election night guarantee.

This is a horrible attempted theft inflicted upon us. We will prevail as Courts want facts. This process will work its way through.

1327014664958476293 2020-11-13 06:25:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The FACT that Twitter has NEVER flagged a Biden tweet, is the same principle as having every Vote go for Biden at 3 am. Twitter is a Rigged Casino.

1326791235458248705 2020-11-12 15:37:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Fox News prepared for the Election Night Theft by having only Anti Trumpers calling the Election Play by Play results.

For example a guy runs out of Best Buy with a brand new TV in box, then gets promptly robbed. I want Donald Trump to re steal or reclaim what was stolen from him in this Great Steal Election.

1326607785732141057 2020-11-12 03:28:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> At what point does it become mathematically impossible? (...17)
1326575080751525888 2020-11-12 01:18:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Any Newspaper article, tweet, video that says : “Zero Evidence of Fraud”, is guilty of attempting to cover up the biggest political crime ever in this Great Republic. This is the theft of an entire Election engineered in one swift power grab. It will not stand nor come to pass.
1326570311353970688 2020-11-12 00:59:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JeffObvious I agree. In this instance I think there is something more. Just a hunch, that’s all.

1326564576385593344 2020-11-12 00:36:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If Biden is doing so well, how come any evidence of fraud ( Detection) is immediately covered up, censored or shut down? #1984 - no transparency!

I heard that Esper wouldn’t order the Insurrection Act. My hunch is Trump isn’t going to let people wantonly destroy cities etc.???
1326374715586326529 2020-11-11 12:02:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1111Vermillion @RepJerryNadler Exactly.

1326370329418108928 2020-11-11 11:45:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I wouldn’t want this guy representing me to get off of a Jaywalking ticket.

1326366588279291904 2020-11-11 11:30:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> In the event of a worst case scenario, an Impasse if you will, I doubt that the US Military would come to the side of Joe Biden. If the Left really want a successful Coup to take over the W/House they will need the Mil. I think Trump nullified that yesterday (Esper) &amp; today.
1326361965548040192 2020-11-11 11:11:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I now look for these ridiculous little blue warning signs from Twitler as being something of Truth in determining the Election (F)raud. These people are stupid.  https://t.co/NHvgeEA5lR

1326339421440942080 2020-11-11 09:42:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 😅
1326339251810824194 2020-11-11 09:41:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> From the Official desktop account of the Honorable Stable John Ross, this below is utter Propaganda from a dying Campaign. 👇  https://t.co/vMTQXH70mZ
1326336907551256576 2020-11-11 09:32:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @mflew2 It was was put up as a possible option 2-3 years ago. No one really knew then, but with each passing day, this seems to be it.
1326323367557787653 2020-11-11 08:38:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Er, Hunter’s Laptop tells us otherwise. All the details haven’t been released yet, but you know that? (...well, maybe you don’t!)
1326321543891181569 2020-11-11 08:31:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It’s becoming clearer to me that the MSM will never concede. That’s okay, because they don’t have the Keys to the White House.
1326318990403137536 2020-11-11 08:21:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @flasher_mig What’s wrong with checking all the ballots? We had 4 freaking years of Russia, Russia, Russia from the Dems &amp; now we cannot even get 4+ days to balance the checkbooks, so as to speak. No, the whole rush to usher Biden is straight from the Communist Playbook. “ Playbook known!”~Q
1326317310731198464 2020-11-11 08:14:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ It is.
1326315192372789248 2020-11-11 08:05:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow So much there, I just wanted to look really at the Ballot fraud first. They don’t the smell test on one Fraudulent ballot.
1326314143989735426 2020-11-11 08:01:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @arkivnerd @JoeBiden An idea whose time hasn’t come.
1326313949420113920 2020-11-11 08:01:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @michaelbeatty3 @thehill Oh Okay let’s just accept it! 😅😅😅😂🤣
1326309096434233344 2020-11-11 07:41:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe @JoeBiden As a President-Elect you are a Myth.
1326305671717904384 2020-11-11 07:28:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Trin20201 TY!
1326304865073590274 2020-11-11 07:24:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Just what is the penalty for Election Fraud (PRISON) &amp; what is it? (One of the two parties has broken every Law here, I see.)  https://t.co/T9cEGz8P95
1326301380525522944 2020-11-11 07:11:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights @HMFOGTLIWY @CISAKrebs Was giving that some thought this morning, in that the real details would be NAT SEC? Imagine if a [FA] were hacking into our Elections, this would be a safeguard. Schiff said Russia for 4yrs. after all. Like a Hammer, he was.
1326299053248765952 2020-11-11 07:01:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @paul_furber @thehill 😅 Gaslighting supplies are running low!

1326288651492360192 2020-11-11 06:20:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChadMyers333 Good tune. No, Great Tune.
1326287834701996032 2020-11-11 06:17:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe @JoeBiden Please concede in a gracious manner. let's all unite behind our duly Elected President Donald Trump. (...see no reply from The Biden Campaign!)
1326280881028231168 2020-11-11 05:49:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 😅 Democrats invent Time Travel. Ballots go back in time to be stamped before they were posted.
1326274961133064192 2020-11-11 05:26:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @kathismoak @JoeBiden Saw that. Calls are being recorded.

1326270318881644544 2020-11-11 05:07:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Biden is the threat. You don’t debrief the threat itself.
1326267008447438848 2020-11-11 04:54:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @electtek Didn’t require that great of an observation skill. Here’s more Empirical Evidence. When examining millions of Liberal’s Social Media accounts, there are virtual zero comments of adoration for Joe Biden. Much Love ❤️, has been expressed for Trump.
1326266214306361344 2020-11-11 04:51:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LaBeanBall1 @jaketapper Stopping a Coup from the Left. You always need the Military when performing a coup. Pink Hatted men can’t do that. Now all of you Biden phony ballot heads just might want to think about that?
1326262474337734656 2020-11-11 04:36:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DrBoHammer @777lonesomedove Pomp’s ain’t joking. Mid west plain talk.
1326257127061549057 2020-11-11 04:15:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> "Empirical evidence is information acquired by observation or experimentation." ...with that said, we all observed how extremely popular Trump was at his massive Rallies. Biden didn't even fill a minivan.  Joe Biden was never a loved or popular Candidate!
1326255304946806784 2020-11-11 04:07:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @20Petrichor20 I think for myself.
1326251458128351233 2020-11-11 03:52:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JeffObvious He said it, exactly how I would. Both parties understood &amp; it was in a jocular but truthful manner. Art of direct communication.
1326251076266323969 2020-11-11 03:51:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @20Petrichor20 50/50 Everything is not always clear. Flu shots have been around for years. Some of my family have them. Some don’t. I do not.
1326249964373094400 2020-11-11 03:46:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Caution to all MSM. Gas supplies are running low. Please use your Gaslighting comments sparingly. Thank you for your cooperation.
1326249081262403584 2020-11-11 03:43:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Some of them are beginning to notice.  https://t.co/2UGWLaRtXO
1326247054142631937 2020-11-11 03:35:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This displays serious retardation in thinking. 👇
1326245552015646721 2020-11-11 03:29:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @stewart_temby It would be United Nations, but frankly I wasn’t thinking of that, but nice take! 👍
1326235252843409408 2020-11-11 02:48:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is a National Security risk being on the payroll of #CCP Then again, so are you. Do you have a second passport? Make sure the Country you go to doesn’t have an extradition Treaty with the US. Have a nice day.
1326234265261023232 2020-11-11 02:44:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PeterZeihan Picking a candidate with Dementia is never a good strategy. Trump filled stadiums with thousands, Biden couldn’t fill a minvan. You might want to reassess the meaning of “popular”, otherwise your credibility is sinking lower than the Pollsters.
1326223666804269057 2020-11-11 02:02:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Sh!t! We thought the Russians were going to hack our Election? We had no idea it was going to be the Democrats! 😉
1326223164297285632 2020-11-11 02:00:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Democrats should be pleased we Monitored the Elections! Adam Schiff has been telling us for 4 years of the Russians. Why so serious, now?
1326222598082949121 2020-11-11 01:58:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BarbHaugen Yes. Good point. We had every right to monitor the Election in case the Russians? Infiltrated our Voting system. We weren’t expecting our own kind to cheat on us were we? 😉
1326222046863323137 2020-11-11 01:55:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @QuarkToro @ScottAdamsSays Except in this instance it is a fascist takeover. Trump hasn’t started one war. He’s been reducing troops.
1326221513599582208 2020-11-11 01:53:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Clever question. 👇
1326218052556386304 2020-11-11 01:39:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trust the Science. You see in the end, those phony numbers don’t lie. It’s just like a business declaring phony revenues, in order to attract investors.
1326217461511843841 2020-11-11 01:37:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @nathanjessuprig It no longer exists. He had it for 2 days.
1326214675336290305 2020-11-11 01:26:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Is there an “ Un-Office of President Elect?” Asking on behalf of a group of Coup plotters.
1326212698615414784 2020-11-11 01:18:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @franky_thompson A lot of Union workers were forced to participate in the Scheme, with the threat of losing their jobs. More will be revealed.
1326211733719982080 2020-11-11 01:14:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Democrats: “ Even though we got caught cheating in the biggest ballot harvesting scheme in history, Donald Trump set us up. It was a set up!” Communist Logic Defined.

1326196277562888198 2020-11-11 00:13:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AL233111 They probably weren't given all the details, so as not to let it slip, but I'm being serious here, with Joe's condition, he couldn't help it. Part of the symptoms.
1326195507224481793 2020-11-11 00:10:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChristopherLknb Only so many characters in a tweet, but you're right. This was a POWER GRAB, A Coup.
1326195086292520962 2020-11-11 00:08:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> "We did it Joe",  "We nearly pulled off stealing the entire fcking Election"
1326194469595541505 2020-11-11 00:06:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChristopherLknb Yes, but THEM not us. They either didn't see it or were too stupid to continue.
1326194147594629120 2020-11-11 00:04:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We, can handle, the Gaslighting, that's pretty laughable to us...but the actual cancelling, burning, destroying &amp; falsifying our Votes on Election Eve, that's a NO! Now we take you down.
1326193091464753159 2020-11-11 00:00:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Part of our Plan, was letting the Democrats execute their Plan. Simply put, we let them rob the bank, except the Bills have been specially marked. What did our friends say in the early days?  "How do capture a Wild Animal?", as always  the answer is  A TRAP.
1326190669623255040 2020-11-10 23:51:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> That's right. Now f*ck them.
1326188427759382533 2020-11-10 23:42:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights Someone {they} believe. A deprogrammer. One who can break the spell. Someone who wants to avoid execution.
1326187600122507264 2020-11-10 23:38:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MoonmanPatriot 👍
1326187479897051138 2020-11-10 23:38:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> One of the biggest flaws in the Democrat Plan was demented ol' Joe himself. He gave us two VALUABLE  clues.  1. I don't need your Votes to get Elected!  2. We have the biggest Vote Fraud Plan in progress! Now understand this.  This hoax was very planned . "Oceans 11" style level.

1326033156705718273 2020-11-10 13:25:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump's grabbing all the fraudulent Dem Voters by their Pink Pu$$y Hats!  https://t.co/APqVFqOgtA

1326030712353423360 2020-11-10 13:15:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GrannyGi4Trump Honestly, how do you let Joe Biden know, that he is the biggest threat to this Country? Duh!
1326026322313801729 2020-11-10 12:58:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GrannyGi4Trump Who else would take my Lollipop away? 😅

1326014534918709248 2020-11-10 12:11:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump is on the threshold of breaking Twitter. Those childish notices, saying that you are not old enough to read his tweets or discern for yourself only creates a “Streisand Effect!”

Untraceable? Because twit isn’t going to turn people in, when they are in on the Great Steal? There was a lot of texting on Tues nite to Steal.
1325844283451039746 2020-11-10 00:54:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @catturd2 Okay, I sniffed this out. Mark Zuck. gives 100 million to help Elections. He hires the workers, they get food on the job, they burner cellphones with his private encrypted messaging service. There is video everywhere of youngish people delivering Unchecked backpacks at Poll loc’s  https://t.co/JwdGxxgtIm
1325839440573444105 2020-11-10 00:35:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @catturd2 I wonder what method of communication the Dems were using to conduct their illicit theft in real time? Chat Rooms, what’s app? Signal? ...( cell phone texts are too easy to trace? NSA?), anyone have any idea, because this was still a very coordinated &amp; quick theft, with time?
1325836125118763010 2020-11-10 00:22:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Our good friend has said for years look at the Map, find the Keystone? There have been many keystones or markers along the way, but PA is the Keystone State. President Trump recently held an historical Rally there. For a good reason? Trump Team will focus on PA Vote fraud.  https://t.co/j5DRx9Wmzi

(Landlords can get in real trouble to discriminate against renting,  based on someone's skin color or religion. Business get in trouble for ageism. Similar Principles.)

1325665901367029760 2020-11-09 13:05:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Amethyst_DJT My TL is full of bad jokes. Does anyone remember laughter? I miss the good vibes of the Trump rallies. I know Trump will prevail, but even now the Press-Select Biden is fkn depressing. Just the thought of those two morose commies makes me ill.
1325665140885217280 2020-11-09 13:02:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @VeritasVital My theory is {they} want an excuse to keep masks on for after Jan 20-2021, when Trump starts his second term.
1325664589279686656 2020-11-09 13:00:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dems are getting a little panicked that Trump has no intention of leaving. (...relax, legally, Count Every Vote, case heard in Court)...but you can read it in their comments. Nervous much?

1325646994187055109 2020-11-09 11:50:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @cyntheses @patton6966 I never got the final take on what that really meant, maybe after Jan 20-2021 that might be revealed. So many drops seem obscure, then the light bulb can go off. Plenty of double &amp; triple meanings are meant to confuse {Them} also.

1325631707333058561 2020-11-09 10:50:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Here’s another clue from our friends. The Dems knew Joe Biden couldn’t win a Fair Election, therefore they had “nothing to lose” by attempting a Bloodless Coup with a Fraudulent Vote Steal. May have worked on anyone else except our man Trump.  https://t.co/wPI9sOYhfc
1325629456338153477 2020-11-09 10:41:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Some of you may be asking, Why? In 2016 with Hillary Clinton, {They} never thought she would lose. In 2020 with Joe Biden, {They} never thought he would win.

1325530520063631360 2020-11-09 04:07:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @melanie52746044 Yes, I found them also at about 2am 😅...they would be probably but a handful of authorized Fed/State printing contractors. We may never know if the paper itself was encoded as every State was different in its Ballot. Not knowing would make it a Sting. Dec 14th is deadline.
1325520469093617665 2020-11-09 03:28:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EllenKoko Yes, but my argument is simply this. We waited for the Supreme Court for him? He’s a Grade A Hypocrite!

1325507062244106240 2020-11-09 02:34:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trump_gigi We all waited for the Courts to let him win. I was with him.

1325506074200268801 2020-11-09 02:30:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Amethyst_DJT The fact that he cannot give Trump the same Courtesy the Courts gave him.
1325505261537124354 2020-11-09 02:27:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Ungrateful little bastard! I waited nervously &amp; anxiously for him for over 37 days, for every Vote to count. Even marched peacefully on the sidewalks to Count ‘em all. Don’t ask me how I really feel, might not give you the answer you want me to. Oh Well!  https://t.co/yg7ra0fDof

This will turn into a Tribal Drumbeat for them. Trump will NEVER concede, because he won. He also can’t hear the drumbeats, he’s playing golf.

1325479466961760256 2020-11-09 00:45:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @tracybeanz He wanted to win fair &amp; square, that’s why! However, he knew the potential for thievery- exactly like the Cops will use a bait car in the Hood. After the Dems did steal the car, Plan B, goes into effect. Let’s call it “ Insurance”, shall we? We learned that from Peter Stzrok.
1325353515925958656 2020-11-08 16:24:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @matthew_phenix @russ_ayers Thought Crime is not yet a Crime. They had to steal it first, now we take them to Court. Yes, we have to prove it, no it's not difficult to prove.
1325349283365752832 2020-11-08 16:07:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ Yes, I won't spread that type of info, but his behaviour is Hot &amp; Cold. That we can say.
1325348462867570688 2020-11-08 16:04:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ I didn't know he "actually' was, but the behaviour is off. I used to have some employees that were Manic, so I'm somewhat familiar with it.

1325340947299725312 2020-11-08 15:34:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @melanie52746044 They just updated all their Voting systems. The DEMs thought the Paper Ballots would be Key to Ballot stuffing, Covid-19 ✅, because they are really good at it, hence 600,000 Fresh Votes for Biden were just minted, except on the wrong Encoded paper.  https://t.co/vAy4L6xT4z
1325339968164622338 2020-11-08 15:30:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If this is indeed The Sting it really is Fooking Genius. It's like printing perfect $100 bills , except not on the right specially encoded paper.
1325339495592468482 2020-11-08 15:28:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Rogue States like Cali, thinking they have the entire recipe of Water marks &amp; special inks , which they are allowed to do send out the "Copy" of their Recipe to China who prints what they think are good ballots. Everything is perfect about them, except they are not on QFS paper.

1325338081499652096 2020-11-08 15:23:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This Cue drop is I believe the Keystone Drop re the Paper Ballots. If the DHS/cisa delivers Govt. Approved Blank Paper only to the States, they are then free to design &amp; print w/ USPS approval. The “Sting” is the special encoded blank paper. Consider it Unmarked Currency.  https://t.co/0iri4lNdce
1325335016168022016 2020-11-08 15:11:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow if DHS supplied the QFS paper then that really is a fooking bombshell. (They may not supply direct but have Govt. approved suppliers.) Do you realize what this means?

1324881121440509952 2020-11-07 09:07:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @twp459 @charzdesigns It does have that special quality about it, that so many of us recognize.
1324880727821856768 2020-11-07 09:05:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @gadgetfreaksta I’ve used it many times before, as you probably know...but that’s probably the reason.
1324875684842364929 2020-11-07 08:45:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Years &amp; Years of practice have prepared Donald Trump for this moment in time.  https://t.co/HCf4fpvF0U
1324874388404011008 2020-11-07 08:40:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ExciterAural 👍
1324874156031180800 2020-11-07 08:39:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 No.
1324849409629188096 2020-11-07 07:01:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It's time to call this race for Trump.
1324848610953945088 2020-11-07 06:58:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> THIS DAY IN HISTORY. {The point being, this took nearly 5 weeks. This time in 2020, it could be longer &amp; nastier, because socialists don't go down easy.}  Gore concedes presidential election to Bush, Dec. 13, 2000  https://t.co/4jQSMOutG0
1324842299252121600 2020-11-07 06:33:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Russians hacked our election and pushed a lot of fraudulent ballots into the system. We need an audit. Just to be sure.
1324840435882184704 2020-11-07 06:25:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Donald Trump has good Insurance.  https://t.co/XHB5pqSNL6
1324824744919666688 2020-11-07 05:23:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EatsMao I've got a lot of faith. Even going to take some time off. Been going hard at this for years now. I'll still be here though.🤠
1324820202693910528 2020-11-07 05:05:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EatsMao I've read this back and forth many times &amp; it seems to say, maybe we will, maybe we won't. Out of my hands for now. I say we've got this, one way or another.
1324814590325125120 2020-11-07 04:43:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EatsMao The website has a lot of info. Depends on each State, the way I’m reading. Anyway, more than ample evidence other than this.

1324790256726544384 2020-11-07 03:06:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers 😅 👍
1324787908780335104 2020-11-07 02:57:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 5:4 is the new 5:5
1324771847016079360 2020-11-07 01:53:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1_Decided_Voter @prayingmedic Good point.
1324771562474545153 2020-11-07 01:52:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Information Warfare.
1324771396510085120 2020-11-07 01:51:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @prayingmedic If “our” side now has seeds of doubt about the Watermark story, you can be sure the “other” side does too. Information Warfare is very effective in working two ways. The “other” side will speed up their counting process &amp; won’t be ordering any new ballots overnight from China.
1324751078219370497 2020-11-07 00:30:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I see dead people.  https://t.co/QdEOGK3NhG
1324750282589233153 2020-11-07 00:27:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Plenty of big name Dems strangely quiet. Biggest US Election re count in history &amp; not but one word?
1324744420000845824 2020-11-07 00:04:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I don’t see why We The People can’t file a class action civil law suit against the @DNC for Election Fraud?
1324743721749893120 2020-11-07 00:01:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When Senile @joebiden said :” I don’t need you to get elected!” at one of his massive 4 person rallies, he wasn’t kidding. No wonder they kept him in the basement.
1324627119364739073 2020-11-06 16:18:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dems counting fake ballots as if their lives depended on it.
1324619438964895745 2020-11-06 15:47:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @akiagrey @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump Try to keep up. 5-4
1324617470573899776 2020-11-06 15:39:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @akiagrey @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump Over for Biden. Get some rest. Thanks for playing. 5-4
1324614288464515072 2020-11-06 15:27:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Poof! Gone
1324613785059950592 2020-11-06 15:25:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Incoming. Tweet storm.  https://t.co/9edZkvmWfO
1324613392561135617 2020-11-06 15:23:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EddaMonaco Don’t forget he got a building permit in the City of New York. He fought those guys for years, so he is battle hardened! 😅
1324611954619547648 2020-11-06 15:17:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Shakespeares Macbeth sums up the US Election process: “Fair is foul and fouls is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air.”
1324610596537470976 2020-11-06 15:12:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EddaMonaco He lives for this. Don’t tell anyone.
1324610232199176193 2020-11-06 15:11:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How come Joe Biden isn’t requesting transparency in the ballot counting process? Oh, that’s right, he’s the bastard cheating in this instance.
1324609763078930434 2020-11-06 15:09:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I mentioned earlier today, Biden won’t be asking for recounts? That would be a fool’s errand. This will all play out. Don’t worry.
1324604538913845248 2020-11-06 14:48:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Amethyst_DJT Haha...Twitter steals followers like Dems steal votes!
1324604288455200768 2020-11-06 14:47:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers You stole this from me bro, I had my tweet watermarked!
1324603529990844416 2020-11-06 14:44:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Like most of you, have been really focused on the Election &amp; it’s subsequent Coup. Each day, I think I’ve followed back more followers than ever. I’m still less than what I was 3 weeks ago. I’m now going to steal followers. Old Dem trick!
1324600665922961408 2020-11-06 14:33:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Must be them violent qanons.
1324600035019911168 2020-11-06 14:30:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Going to keep the Profile Eyes Rigged for Red, until every last damn fake ballot is scanned in this Country!  https://t.co/Nbd9Epw3q1
1324595657580056577 2020-11-06 14:13:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Past proves Future.  https://t.co/YwGUyDy0ZU
1324592040743559169 2020-11-06 13:58:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 @politico Bigly.
1324590762453946368 2020-11-06 13:53:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Our 1A has been under unbelievable assault here, particularly last past 2 months. Our own President FFS! Just too many others for me to name. You know who they are. Imagine now if Joe Biden &amp; The Traveling Kamal succeed, what would happen to the 2A. Society on a precipice.
1324588905207746563 2020-11-06 13:46:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> America’s favorite Mayor, can’t even get his tweets liked! They’ve even blocked that. Even when twit cheats it can’t win.  https://t.co/lxYUWdld62
1324587129918271488 2020-11-06 13:39:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trust the Science? After another Election fiasco, the Pollsters false numbers of trying to measure something that couldn’t be measured! @FrankLuntz I would like fries with my order please?
1324569914418495490 2020-11-06 12:30:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LaurieSmith1000 @hollywdharriet This seems to go along with the dots that anons are connecting re watermarks &amp; careful releasing of ballots. Many people are now confirming this.
1324541573837643776 2020-11-06 10:38:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MastodonOz @russ_ayers Unfortunately we are at a stage where more is going on behind the scenes. This is a Legal Warfare level now. Behind closed doors. Evidence is mounting. Check out Gateway Pundits recent tweet about the Dem calling fraud. He got thrown out of the Counting Ballots area.
1324533987012849664 2020-11-06 10:08:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JuliansRum @AwakenedOutlaw I prefer to win. Declas after that.
1324532639542358018 2020-11-06 10:02:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers @MastodonOz Even today at Trump’s Presser, he was laying out the case. Everything we’ve spotted, he &amp; his team knows. Actually they know more ( Mil intel!)
1324531024869564416 2020-11-06 09:56:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Amber_305 I know. All the chicks dug him.
1324530768182349829 2020-11-06 09:55:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @P51leahy More than you can ever know.
1324526334501031936 2020-11-06 09:37:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 He represents all of us. Very Focused.
1324525965750411265 2020-11-06 09:36:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 That number may not be too far off.
1324525653320896513 2020-11-06 09:34:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MastodonOz Agreed. In the middle of this storm, so as to speak. Wasn't like we were not forewarned.
1324525181348446208 2020-11-06 09:33:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers @MastodonOz I did see that. Makes sense.
1324524996933283840 2020-11-06 09:32:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Grateful then as I am now.
1324524528664416261 2020-11-06 09:30:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 Same way the Dems drop ballots off at 4am.
1324520632743157760 2020-11-06 09:15:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Reported to Twitter for  lying.
1324517075755266048 2020-11-06 09:00:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JackKlemeyer @familyman20181 What if the Dems tried to steal an election? I got plenty more where that came from.
1324514040463306752 2020-11-06 08:48:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @droseseest @artificialcaged I hate them both. I only tweet to myself anyways.

1324504760322461696 2020-11-06 08:11:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Please expand Gitmo today, for all the lying complicit Media.

1324487274214563840 2020-11-06 07:02:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @nonSibi_sailor Correct. Particularly since he won.

1324392848733581312 2020-11-06 00:47:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Resorting to screenshots thanks to Jack Stalin.  https://t.co/LzjBSSKDsK

1324385112507641856 2020-11-06 00:16:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Let’s see if Joe Biden demands a recount, ANYWHERE!
1324384797465014277 2020-11-06 00:15:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ladyLBlady @RandallLaframb1 I needed a headline!

1324378661542219776 2020-11-05 23:50:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BrettLaGrave @AnnTheo5 😅
1324376576595615746 2020-11-05 23:42:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Democrats, just stop. We are now just simply laughing at you.
1324376261364342785 2020-11-05 23:41:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HigherKingdom This attempted heist is just like the two buffoons trying to break into the house of Home Alone. It’s such an absurd comical attempt by the Democrats.
1324375363347124224 2020-11-05 23:37:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Gee, how?
1324374752153100290 2020-11-05 23:35:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Guy walks into a bar, with 138,399 ballots...

1324373275317686275 2020-11-05 23:29:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Media have just tried to gaslight us with the Biggest Lie in modern history. What was that lie? Joe Biden is more popular than Donald Trump.
1324371866182627329 2020-11-05 23:23:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Democrats. Delete your Party.
1324371128454836225 2020-11-05 23:20:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @martingeddes Haha! Looking like Chumps! Nice word play Martin!
1324257503757021184 2020-11-05 15:49:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hollywdharriet One day at a time. ( ...you’re probably right!)
1324256575750459392 2020-11-05 15:45:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I did like Joe Biden’s last Campaign slogan: IF YOU ARE GOING TO STEAL, STEAL BIG!
1324255988149493760 2020-11-05 15:43:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Brokaw probably knows the real outcome. By getting in early, he gets first bite. (...when the Left turn, stand clear.)
1324255081663848448 2020-11-05 15:39:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hollywdharriet My thoughts also.
1324254077404897280 2020-11-05 15:35:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> People around the World are literally saying, How come every extra Vote or Missing Ballot crops up ONLY in Joe Biden’s favor? Not one extra Vote has been found for Donald Trump. They are laughing at us! #BananaRepublic
1324252818920779776 2020-11-05 15:30:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Folks, as far as Joe Biden is concerned, we’ve been had!
1324252505333620737 2020-11-05 15:29:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CrazyBlackDog7 That’s exactly my point.
1324252360009412609 2020-11-05 15:29:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MrDaneCW Haha! Never take the helicopter after having had breakfast with a Drug lord.
1324251710420709376 2020-11-05 15:26:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @aqpatrons Yes, but I think James Woods said, Joe Biden couldn’t even get enough people to fill a mini-van, yet this fraud gets 70 million Votes? Donald Trump was pulling more people than Led Zeppelin. CRIME OF THE CENTURY!
1324250538523811840 2020-11-05 15:21:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MrDaneCW 😆...he was!
1324250433800474625 2020-11-05 15:21:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @therealbaconcdr Mine wasn’t that good, but Thanks.
1324250087858450433 2020-11-05 15:19:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JuliansRum False equivalence. ( ...and not that good either.)
1324249190357106688 2020-11-05 15:16:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> What, he got How many Votes?  https://t.co/y54TCtrRGB
1324248293266780160 2020-11-05 15:12:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @FKTVis IKR!
1324247500241408002 2020-11-05 15:09:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is supposedly more popular than Barack Obama.
1324247072040652800 2020-11-05 15:07:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> All of Joe Biden’s Votes, are just a Myth!
1324245434097758208 2020-11-05 15:01:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Man with Dementia gets most Votes      ever. Now that’s Memorable!
1324243883815960577 2020-11-05 14:55:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @purplexrczball This is true. The Public will never know.
1324237856672370689 2020-11-05 14:31:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hollywdharriet In what way? Things they will do or them getting exposed?
1324236536779481088 2020-11-05 14:26:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> So, our President Donald Trump has had to endure two attempted take over Coups in 4 years! These are extremely Desperate People, to do such Desperate things.
1324235713773068294 2020-11-05 14:22:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 I did see that today. Definitely Rat’s Nest material.

1324233495246368768 2020-11-05 14:14:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Mareq16 @zsh3 Git? English expression?
1324233216551612417 2020-11-05 14:12:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Mareq16 @KatO94409307 Literally just thinking which Dem is going to be exposed as the Criminal Mastermind behind the THE BIG STEAL? Probably this guy &amp; Norm Eisen. Trump used to say if you’re thinking, THINK BIG. These Dems say, if you’re lying, LIE BIG.
1324229370152562690 2020-11-05 13:57:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TrumperWavin MIC 🎤 Drop. ( will be huge if true.)  https://t.co/CmRRuVZgYi

1324212829772152832 2020-11-05 12:51:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @gettinolda I liked the drama of that scene.
1324211678611869697 2020-11-05 12:47:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Finding 100,000 Votes suddenly for Joe Biden at 4am &amp; not a one corresponding Vote for Trump did it for me.
1324210737229672449 2020-11-05 12:43:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m old fashioned, but I loathe people trying to rig Elections.  https://t.co/mHELlPH1z1

1324165900258340865 2020-11-05 09:45:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights Are you hinting that the Chy Nese had the “recipe” to print counterfeit ballots? If that is the case they are renowned for their ability to counterfeit US Currency.

1324026403315093504 2020-11-05 00:31:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @KIKINOKC They called any Biden states immediately &amp; delayed calling the Trump states. Mass Media collusion &amp; complicity.
1324025234714849280 2020-11-05 00:26:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When Fox announced last night that Trump had the 273 Votes ( or the path to it?), I noticed it all went dead around the spectrum. Was this the Whistle to alert everybody to stop &amp; shut it down? Seems a very pre planned moment in time.
1324024107722133510 2020-11-05 00:22:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Not much Covid talk today.

1323895877514129408 2020-11-04 15:52:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Who says the #CCP Media has to call the Election? Don’t the FEC &amp; DOJ have a say? Basically then I have to wait until Donna Brazile &amp; Chris Wallace say so? That ain’t right!

1323881259915898881 2020-11-04 14:54:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon It’s playing out exactly how they said. You would need to wait until the actual outcome of the Election. That could be 2-3 days, weeks or months. I’ve always said, they fight till the bitter end. NEVER EASY. I wouldn’t hold back one way or the other.
1323878625888792578 2020-11-04 14:43:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JuliansRum @DigiDiva2020 An attempted Coup. There is no other way to describe it.

1323876270090801152 2020-11-04 14:34:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I reported Joe Biden’s tweet for being misleading. What the Hell!
1323864777588830211 2020-11-04 13:48:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @liquidlaugh I still can’t believe there are so many idiots that voted for him. He couldn’t even do that short speech without a teleprompter &amp; Jill Biden whispering to him what to say.
1323855673025703936 2020-11-04 13:12:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @linda84920254 I got the Popular Vote number from WarRoom / Steve Bannon. The gun owner part was a gag line, however the new gun owners are massive over here, in the millions.
1323852941074182144 2020-11-04 13:01:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Donald Trump is now 2.5 million Votes ahead on the Popular Vote. All of them new Gun owners.

1323547213419573248 2020-11-03 16:47:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hollywdharriet I'm in the Temecula Valley region..about 1450 ' elevation..almost on the edge of the green zone to desert..huge wine growing area here. Good star gazing. I'll sit outside nearly every night. (Dumped Cable TV!) Look at the stars, meditate &amp; compose the next tweet!

1323539496428691458 2020-11-03 16:16:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hollywdharriet My picture had lost one of the eyes time I got the phone out, but it was more like the Opera Mask. It did freak me there for a bit, as I couldn't believe what I was seeing.The moon was so bright it was very vivid.  https://t.co/jgb5O6wCCh
1323535380314910721 2020-11-03 15:59:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 That should do it for me. Trump has Won!

1323529525305638913 2020-11-03 15:36:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The other night on Halloween, sitting outside the beautiful Blue Harvest Moon was shining through the clouds &amp; created a perfect Halloween Mask. It was almost freaky. Only lasted about 2-3 minutes. My crappy old iPhone couldn’t grab the image well, but it was very 2020.  https://t.co/m1BGlQIFR4

1323516225205334016 2020-11-03 14:43:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow He's also claiming there is no wall, so much video evidence it's not even funny. You're also correct about the revenues. There are other intangibles, not easy to calculate. If we make washing machines here, it's jobs here and no tariffs. It's beyond Jim. He's a d*ck.
1323513691971686405 2020-11-03 14:33:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is why we laugh at you.
1323512958589153280 2020-11-03 14:30:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GregReports I was laughing so hard, had tears running my face. Zoom in on the photos, you can see Trump is fully aware &amp; he can't stop grinning. That's gonna be a heck of plane ride back to DC sharing that story.
1323511346399379458 2020-11-03 14:24:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Never seen anything like it. I don't think Trump was tired at the end, he was just nursing his voice to get through &amp; he did it. Fkn amazing.
1323508170656903168 2020-11-03 14:11:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RealbbSasha1 He knew it &amp; couldn’t stop laughing.

1323493291535466496 2020-11-03 13:12:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Soonergirl_kp Moderate compared just to the others. Not so much as support in any bills or ideas. Big flip flopper. He just didn’t come across like the extreme Commie section, like the Squad.

1323488677461286912 2020-11-03 12:54:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @nxtmrssmoltz I’ve heard that from many people. It’s possible. I don’t think he’s that good of an actor, but to put it all in perspective, doesn’t matter that much. Just want him to lose &amp; Trump to win. Get the Universe back to One.
1323488148366635008 2020-11-03 12:52:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Soonergirl_kp I’ve never really liked JB ( not much a fan of any Dem), but I always thought he was a Moderate ( I was wrong again), but the picture on the left is the angry bastard I’ve always disliked. Guy on the right is just an angry feeble old man. I may become that, but I’m not running.
1323486573866803202 2020-11-03 12:46:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Controla_Virus He looks feeble now.
1323484922162544640 2020-11-03 12:39:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Soonergirl_kp Then or now? I’m not trying to be wise here, because now he looks mummified.
1323484243444469762 2020-11-03 12:36:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AdrewsChad @SpyGateDown I have always said, they count votes well. We’ll see how it works out. Empirical evidence alone points to Trump.

1323483253500620800 2020-11-03 12:32:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trump_gigi I’m not there yet, might stroll on over. My family have accounts. Living in fear of being censored here is tiresome.
1323482676318269440 2020-11-03 12:30:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Amrch1 Despite all my disdain of him, I didn’t wish him any ill will on that front. Zero.
1323482350580236289 2020-11-03 12:29:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown If you go back &amp; analyze from day 1, they haven’t made a correct call. Russia, Mueller, Kavanaugh, Impeachment, Covid , Masks. Simply Hating Trump is NOT a Political Platform. Have you heard a single idea from them?....picking Biden , there’s another Gem!
1323481077638332417 2020-11-03 12:24:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @61_kerry 100 million Democrats in America &amp; they had to pick that one?
1323480892275187714 2020-11-03 12:23:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @FanninRyan Yeh, not a good look with him either.
1323480785538613249 2020-11-03 12:23:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trump_gigi Everything I’ve read is that they pump him up &amp; it wears off. Trump has even said it himself.
1323480514779492353 2020-11-03 12:21:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TimothyHooker9 @JoeBiden I haven’t seen much of that version.
1323480138378473473 2020-11-03 12:20:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RJB06953045 That’s a strong theory. I’ve heard of other diseases, but the observed appearance can’t be denied. His cognitive skills are clearly displayed when Trump plays the video clips at the rallies.
1323479518703620096 2020-11-03 12:18:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trump_gigi Honestly, I haven’t thought of that angle. In 2020, anything is possible. Especially from very desperate people like the Dems.
1323479033988837377 2020-11-03 12:16:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @61_kerry You remember James Carville? he tweeted out that he thinks it will all be over by 10 O’clock tomorrow night! In Biden’s favor ( of course not I say), then I remembered this.
1323478446731743233 2020-11-03 12:13:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is how he looked about 24 months ago. The decline has been rapid.  https://t.co/q7xMms1mow
1323471179814891527 2020-11-03 11:44:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @barula I agree. I can only say Thank Goodness this is the last one. Even from my perspective, you probably can’t convince anybody else at this point. He knows what he is doing. Marathon, not a Sprint.
1323470629710909442 2020-11-03 11:42:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Just spitballing here, but we may know a little more by this time tomorrow night.  https://t.co/MqBar33se1

1323307360748630017 2020-11-03 00:53:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RobertPLewis Can you describe it in one tweet? Elevator Pitch please?
1323298482795368448 2020-11-03 00:18:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Let’s Finish This!
1323295048901910528 2020-11-03 00:04:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SummerSoulstic1 It’s an expression. put “I” there if you wish.
1323294497225076739 2020-11-03 00:02:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Michael99846133 Ron was my guy. He was suppressed also, now we know the Federal Debate Commission is a Private Company. Therefore the debates are rigged by never allowing for a third or more choice. Trump knew this though from Tea Party days.
1323293313043058688 2020-11-02 23:58:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @WordSpkr No.

1323176222537392128 2020-11-02 16:12:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @politicalfarm @pam78701 Considering that’s 15 years ago, they really don’t look too much different now.
1323174131928428544 2020-11-02 16:04:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BS_Detector2020 It’s the flying objects that can hit him in the back of the head I worry about! I hedged my bet on that tweet. He’s cool, but not immune to being injured. 😅
1323173394985086977 2020-11-02 16:01:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @USAPippa About 100 cars. Here in SoCal that’s about the normal number of cars driving through a popular hamburger joint here called Inn-N-Out.

1323172363085651968 2020-11-02 15:57:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hardy_wightman At the time, we knew no better. In hindsight, I’m a genius.

1323170149831118850 2020-11-02 15:48:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This to me will go down as JB’s Handlers best tweet. They are acknowledging the whole “he” never comes out of the basement relentless attacks from Trump &amp; it’s subtle nod to their own lost Campaign. This is Trump’s reality of your world, not what you have perceived it to be.
1323167183103356928 2020-11-02 15:36:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DanSwanson1965 Ok. Listen if you get that Time Machine to work, keep me posted please. Couple of errands I would like to attend to. 🤠
1323165649355460608 2020-11-02 15:30:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DanSwanson1965 What? Attacking Mitt? I haven’t started yet, if that’s the case.
1323164179415531521 2020-11-02 15:24:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @droseseest Tomorrow, is the first day for the rest of your life.
1323159697470353409 2020-11-02 15:07:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Angel5Christine @retireddan2001 My comment tonight is based only on what we know about him NOW. In hindsight, I was in exactly the same boat as everyone else &amp; didn’t know anymore than anyone else. It was at the time A Rock &amp; a Hard Place choice.
1323157340875468800 2020-11-02 14:57:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SaberX01 Great comment. Watching Trump tonight you realize, he’s Light Years ahead of everyone. (...probably why the Left hate him, they can’t catch him, he’s too quick.)

1323142553357615104 2020-11-02 13:59:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ He operates at a different frequency. He then adjusts it to take it in from the crowds. It's a positive energy, as the crowds freely give it. Maybe it really is Pure Love.
1323140611554177024 2020-11-02 13:51:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump now going to visit Joe Biden &amp; bring some pudding.

1323109729091031041 2020-11-02 11:48:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GuidoFawkes1776 I'm thinking along those lines also.

1323087388470435840 2020-11-02 10:19:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Here we have, Stephen King, prolific writer &amp; novelist experiencing  dreaded writer’s block. There is nothing good he can say about his Candidate. Welcome to the horror of the Biden Zone. You will experience complete disorientation for the next 48 hrs.
1323085178755932161 2020-11-02 10:11:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Some may call this satire. I think it’s Truth. Fact checked ✅ by me.  https://t.co/2deuKxXuBi

1323061461132865536 2020-11-02 08:36:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @4TrueTime Correct. I’m talking his performance on stage not out in the world. Big difference.
1323061134014910464 2020-11-02 08:35:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @YDCtaco @Cernovich Full Disclosure. He is.
1323060224500985856 2020-11-02 08:31:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador It seemed plausible.
1323058855824089088 2020-11-02 08:26:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom I think so, however it shows a very high level of confidence in your ability to display the level of incompetence in your opponent. (...it’s my style, just ❤️ it!)
1323058011204591616 2020-11-02 08:23:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Make of this what you will, but some close family tried to place a sizable bet on Trump to win. No insider info, just thinking Trump has a reasonably good chance to win. After opening acct at  https://t.co/LRBvr9GtmK notified, taking no more bets on Trump.  (Balanced for payouts.)
1323054304354213889 2020-11-02 08:08:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Has this been done before in political history where our Candidate, Donald Trump, saves his breath by playing extensive video of the opposing Candidate Joe Biden? We are now at the point we can play Joe Biden’s entire speech at our Rally. Boggles the mind. Joe is Comedy Central!
1323047940135374849 2020-11-02 07:43:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Where are they?  https://t.co/DUh0PYXX2M
1323020962460176385 2020-11-02 05:55:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> All of Biden’s &amp; Harris so called Rallies are only meet &amp; greet events for the qualified donors. They know Trump supporters would outnumber them. We’ve witnessed another massive scam by the Democrat Crime Syndicate. How do they siphon the money into overseas accounts? Epstein.

1322979265940369408 2020-11-02 03:10:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Sad news for Joe &amp; Hunter Biden fans. Their TV show “ ONE &amp; HALF DUMMIES “ has been cancelled effective Nov 3rd. It made a lot of money initially with packaged Syndicated deals with China &amp; Ukraine, but USA interest has dropped dramatically &amp; rather suddenly.  https://t.co/3Q0KkcWDh2

1322962808481329158 2020-11-02 02:04:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The very small risk of Covid-19 is far better than the risk of Biden-20. You’ll See.

It is extremely cold there now 38 degrees with a strong Wind Chill factor.  A true Warrior amongst Patriot Warriors. Stay safe everyone. 🇺🇸🙏🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸
1322944532091072512 2020-11-02 00:52:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump is playing a damning video now of Biden praising China over the years. Not to be missed is how badly he has aged this past several years. Old. Fragile. Feeble. NOT SUITABLE FOR PRESIDENT!

1322842073964240896 2020-11-01 18:05:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SaberX01 Oh, I go after ‘em in comments. Big name popular accounts on our side. Their usual method is what I call a snarky Hit &amp; Run Reply. Followers low. There are some legit ones say 5k-7k who have the stupid resist &amp; blue wave. It’s a bit of a sport for me. Used to be a pro! 😅
1322839249159254017 2020-11-01 17:53:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeniseD80678926 @ChuckSteeleSr What I do know what he was surprised about is the depth &amp; width of what we call the Swamp or Deep State. Very few that I’ve come across here knew either.
1322838437611724802 2020-11-01 17:50:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr No spinning. Alone in that office, late at night. It’s a Divine Hand. You’ve also seen all the cool group prayer pics with him. The hands all reaching across. I’ve followed his career/life since about 86-87.
1322836471217152000 2020-11-01 17:42:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SaberX01 Lately when I reply they don’t answer back. Some that do are even nice. Wrong but nice.
1322836031356375040 2020-11-01 17:41:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr I’ve seen that spiritual growth in him. I’ve seen that as clear as the trees growing behind my home. He wasn’t even that comfortable mentioning the word “God” in the early days. He said early: “ can you believe, I’m holding my Mother’s Bible!”
1322835164737622016 2020-11-01 17:37:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr @SteveHiltonx I agree.
1322833162603429888 2020-11-01 17:29:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JaneJca3 Not a common US expression, though I understand it. 🤠
1322832186072948738 2020-11-01 17:25:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Your perception may vary but I don’t think Donald Trump looks to be a day over 63. Joe Biden to me looks 84. In actuality Trump is 74, Biden is a few weeks from 78. I didn’t put any pictures, besides they’re everywhere. At minimum I’m saying there is a 20 year difference in look.
1322829117306236928 2020-11-01 17:13:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Does Donald Trump seem rattled? Nope.   https://t.co/ZbKBkLiC19

1322812530461351937 2020-11-01 16:07:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Racy1Eva I got that part. It’s difficult to read on the phone, it refreshes quicker than Twitter &amp; pop up ads saying I need to get emails from New Yorker, er, no I don’t. I’ll try again in the morning on muh desktop.
1322809215195381761 2020-11-01 15:54:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Racy1Eva Thanks..I’ll check it.
1322808008695373824 2020-11-01 15:49:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I have never found one tweet with one decent thing said positive about Joe Biden &amp; this is from the LEFT.
1322807094345490432 2020-11-01 15:46:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is Unemployable, by any true measure of any standard.
1322806682863329280 2020-11-01 15:44:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @aleoniea Makes Zero sense. By rights he shouldn’t have any more than 40% ( generous), Probably down to 20%. Never have seen a more flawed Candidate than Joe Biden. He is unemployable truth be known.

1322792575388971008 2020-11-01 14:48:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers Confession. I didn’t mind this. I was more Stones/ Beatles/Who.
1322792207540051968 2020-11-01 14:46:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Whenever I’m at a Party always bring up James Bond &amp; Pussy Galore. Drives the Feminists crazy! Never get invited back. Oh, well. ( In memory Sean Connery &amp; Honor Blackman. RIP.)  https://t.co/yWwND0bAj5

1322770173221199872 2020-11-01 13:19:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Techwench2 It looks good. I haven’t watched a movie since Jan 15th? About the the time of Wuhan Flu starting. Even during lockdown. Too busy watching all THIS around me.
1322769511880089602 2020-11-01 13:16:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lsborland Looks like I’m starting to get the memo. They really want my Soul. F... that.

1322767906208280579 2020-11-01 13:10:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CootLoot Another Biden gem. I honestly hope the Trump Presidential Library keeps like an electronic Jukebox of all the Biden Gaffes. Fun for the whole family. When I visit it one day priceless memories.

1322765674729541632 2020-11-01 13:01:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> What genius in the Harris/Biden Campaign came up with this last desperate tagline slogan: “Battle for the Soul of the Nation” ? What does it even mean? Is it the working title for the next Star Wars movie? I defy any Dem or Anybody to remember this slogan in the morning.  https://t.co/xsovdJ7mXQ
1322755885987373057 2020-11-01 12:22:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Texas_gal12 Truth be known, BO is probably a better dancer, but he just moved slow for geriatric Joe. ( ... you don’t need to dance Joe)
1322755162344058881 2020-11-01 12:19:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MikeGinn777 I’ll bet he couldn’t wait to high tail out of there. I don’t watch football anymore ( duh) but when you are in the stadium, your teams down 55-9 last quarter, you wanna get away.
1322754144445231104 2020-11-01 12:15:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @gmp18 They never show it.
1322753886994620416 2020-11-01 12:14:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> They’ve managed to keep this down  on the little q side of things ( quiet, that is) Speaking to an old pal of mine today, overseas. He’s not overly political &amp; the first thing he said was: “ You’d think they could find a better qualified candidate!” I was gobsmacked, he’s right.
1322748556734705664 2020-11-01 11:53:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow I knew that. These laser eyes have become telepathic! 🤠😅

1322735061624446976 2020-11-01 10:59:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @leslie_gaddy Never a good sign to be changing Campaign slogans...nothing then is memorable. I'm a little biased, so with me nothing memorable about Biden.
1322732581469650945 2020-11-01 10:49:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GaryHub05057599 That was a tough call for me. Sorry. That dancing though...? 😅

1322721050556207104 2020-11-01 10:04:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GregReports That picture from 2016. Yes. You can do a search but a range back then was lowest about 85% chance of Hillary winning, with the averages between 91-98%. From memory this was all about 2 weeks &amp; less till the Election. They Gaslit this to hell.

1322686293537550336 2020-11-01 07:46:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You mentioned Trump working overtime, but what about Joe? Where’s Joe, where is he? As far as ending the Madness of the Killer, I would have to block you, but on Comedy Central you’re funny.

The language in some of the Verses are different now to what I grew up with. For example the Lord’s Prayer is now different. I have other verses also. “The Wolf” laying down with the Lamb. The “Lion”?

1322426618325823489 2020-10-31 14:34:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CannellJan Insanity is correct, because none of these folks are talking of any harm to other beings. Now there are other groups here &amp; on YT that commit violence, destroy property etc. This cannot continue.
1322420753686429696 2020-10-31 14:10:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RJB06953045 This is dangerous for our Society to go down this slippery slope. I think in the Senate hearing the other day they asked Mark Z &amp; Jack if any Libs had been canned. Answer = Zero

1322390167982796802 2020-10-31 12:09:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @courtguap0 Cruz was a good opponent, I simply preferred Trump. Trump began to (k)ill the rest of the Republican Field. Entertaining how he destroyed them. I had always known Hillary was corrupt from personal friends in Arkansas. The drug deals, all real. In summary Open Borders/Wall &amp; Trade
1322389249161752576 2020-10-31 12:05:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @courtguap0 Trump is coming down escalator. My wife says, that’s it, he will be President. I said he’s brash, may not appeal to everyone. Day 2 I’m listening..,he’s making sense. Open Borders &amp; making stuff here I’m understanding the message. The rest of the field looked weak. Rubio/ Bush.
1322388332500807681 2020-10-31 12:02:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @courtguap0 Keynote talk at a Real Estate conference. He hardly spoke about RE but said he hated us being in wars with young men being so injured. ( he wasn’t against war, only unnecessary war.) Great speech. Driving home, my wife said he would be a great President. ( Noted.) FF to 2015. ...
1322387342502457344 2020-10-31 11:58:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @courtguap0 I’ve followed him since about 86-87. Even went to his office in 91 to discuss taking a retail space in Trump Tower. ( did not meet personally but the experience was A+)...we only opted out of the deal as I was West Coast with young family. Fast forward 2007 Trump is giving...

Frankly it’s not illegal to take money from foreign countries under the right conditions. What galls me is Joe Biden is denying it? You’ve seen the video of him bragging to Ukraine about not getting the 1Billion? Maybe not if all you get is CNN?

1321862924793573377 2020-10-30 01:14:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @4heartandsoul Why duck your head &amp; run inside like a scared rabbit, when your brother is the frontrunner in all the polls?
1321857516565794816 2020-10-30 00:52:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tucker asks, “ Who’s reading his texts?” 🤔

1321850477588328449 2020-10-30 00:24:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It appears that Tony “Bobcat” #Bobulinski has bitten the tongues of Joe &amp; James Biden &amp; most of the Media.
1321847141019512835 2020-10-30 00:11:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DancingCurious Thank You! 🤠
1321846169027313664 2020-10-30 00:07:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RickCrainium That’s the one, Thank You!
1321843575219351552 2020-10-29 23:57:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I can’t find the video clip, but yesterday a reporter was attempting to get some answers from James Biden ( Joe’s brother &amp; partner/adviser?) He shouted back several times “leave me alone!” Strange indeed. If my brother were frontrunner Candidate I’d be singing his praises etc.
1321842219788111873 2020-10-29 23:51:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Record low numbers of flu deaths in 2020? How can that be? Don’t tell me that regular flu deaths were also attributable to Covid? Say that ain’t so, Joe @JoeBiden  Did you guys just lie again to attempt to hurt Donald Trump?
1321840098988625922 2020-10-29 23:43:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @paulamac25 Sad &amp; Pathetic.

1321673472330772482 2020-10-29 12:41:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 If they can really Track those documents, yes. Unfortunately UPS/Fedex don’t have a camera tracking the package down the line, but they can narrow it down to the last person Scanning the package. We’ll see. ( I have lost some packages over the years &amp; sometimes you get lucky.)
1321669002012209153 2020-10-29 12:23:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Oddly enough, I’ve tried scanning Biden’s crowds. With no one there at every rally, it lets me know that this isn’t normal. It’s wrong that a Candidate running for President can’t get a soul to attend.
1321667416678526976 2020-10-29 12:17:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ApTnFlagsOut Tucker did make the missing package part of his segment, that’s for sure. That’s a lot of people tonight who viewed his show to find that out. Valid what you said.
1321665586791768066 2020-10-29 12:10:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ @Grayman1995 Good point.
1321659827253256192 2020-10-29 11:47:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @wild_borneo @MiaFarrow Trump hates war. She doesn’t know much about him. His Doctrine is Peace through Strength.

1321658876731686913 2020-10-29 11:43:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Grayman1995 Doesn’t seem right. Has her account been hacked? She’s not capable of love.
1321652518074556416 2020-10-29 11:18:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is either telling the truth about having no business dealings with China, or telling the world a big fat lie. His “actions”, even without the confirmation of texts, phone calls &amp; emails from Tony #Bobulinksi indicate the latter. A complete refusal to answer is not good
1321647385596977154 2020-10-29 10:57:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador It is! (...gold is still cool though.)

1321636238378455040 2020-10-29 10:13:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @szymon12463 It just seems to me, to pilfer Documents that someone would have copies of reeks of a certain desperate level.

1321620586817232896 2020-10-29 09:11:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @shadowwolf541 No. I’m still not sure why he would need even paper copies? We all send high res scans via email these days unless a “Wet Signature” is required. Could have been “bait”, but I don’t see why? Tucker knew this was biggest interview of his career, time was of essence.

1321608206204895232 2020-10-29 08:22:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tucker had been in Los Angeles to interview Tony #Bobulinski , therefore had requested the Confidential Documents be sent overnight.
1321607669736615936 2020-10-29 08:19:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Holy shit. Tucker just said that he had important Hunter Biden Docs overnighted to him by a major carrier ( NY to LA) and they disappeared around 3 am from the sorting facility. VANISHED! Don’t tell me Deep State isn’t playing for keeps. The Documents on Hunter are real!
1321604798681145345 2020-10-29 08:08:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> #Bobulinski is telling the truth.  https://t.co/gTVdLp6dIF

I'm searching for words, but what he ran, his Empire, is a Criminal Enterprise. He is compromised . He is a National Security Risk &amp; this must must not come to pass.

1321315911991775232 2020-10-28 13:00:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This excellent thread by Mollie, will summarize Tucker Carlson's interview with Tony #Bobulinski  ( The entire interview is difficult to find. Deep State digging in.)

1321310852436402177 2020-10-28 12:40:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HigherKingdom @AdamSchiff I'm looking....other sites like Bitchute, that type of thing. It will crop up.
1321310298700161032 2020-10-28 12:38:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HigherKingdom @AdamSchiff I just noticed that. Whoa! Whoa! I just finished watching it. DEEP STATE&gt;DEEP PANIC
1321307833359618048 2020-10-28 12:28:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ddvoss @ashleykingsley I used that link...Thanks it was great! Nice to be awake.🤠
1321307002614796288 2020-10-28 12:25:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Pnw_Carpe_Diem Yes. I read all it. Confirmed.
1321306828895068161 2020-10-28 12:24:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> *The political Prince of Darkness. Not that other one.  He is now after all The "Chairman" of the Democrat Party. He told us this in his own words at the Debate.
1321306064621625349 2020-10-28 12:21:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @scotty_kiker @Ding7Bill accurate.
1321305646424334343 2020-10-28 12:19:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Amethyst_DJT Not at that level,  I get it, politically he's it. He even told us at the Debates he's the "Chairman" of The Party now.
1321305174644871170 2020-10-28 12:17:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Songbabe109 Nice!
1321305042582970368 2020-10-28 12:17:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HerpesMichael Depend's how good the tweet was.🥴
1321304844062347266 2020-10-28 12:16:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tony #Bobulinksi has irrefutable evidence tonight to confirm what we thought we knew. I now know why Joe Biden said it's going to be a Dark Winter. Joe Biden is in fact The Prince of Darkness.
1321303785705263110 2020-10-28 12:12:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @40dayz40knights I got sick of the Hot/Cold routine. Ann Coulter does that. One reason Trump resonates with me, he hasn't changed his tunes too much in 30-40 years. Every video of his past proves that. Biden on the other hand, changes like a leaf blower.
1321302342344560642 2020-10-28 12:06:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Grayman1995 👍
1321302213428453377 2020-10-28 12:06:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @QArmy1973 After tonight he is. I know I am not the only one who is simply "Sick &amp; Tired" of being "Sick &amp; Tired" of the Dem lies. I think I've seen every good Spy/Political thriller movie out there. Nothing comes as close as these Dems &amp; their new Prince of Darkness the lying Joe Biden.
1321299718207668225 2020-10-28 11:56:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The ENTIRE reason Tony B. came forward is because Adam S. accused him of this being another Russian disinfo. Tony demanded Adam S. retract that statement. In Tony’s eyes Adam is calling him a traitor to his Country. Tony served with honor in the Navy. It’s a big deal. A real BFD.
1321296521283936256 2020-10-28 11:43:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @galloy_tammie Honestly, he's on my maul list.
1321296228827672576 2020-10-28 11:42:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tony #Bobulinsky is a big hungry bear &amp; Adam Schiff is looking a little tasty right now. Run Adam Run. Hunters becomes the Hunted.
1321295454517317635 2020-10-28 11:39:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @galloy_tammie I'm pissed, but Tony has the Facts on his side. Truth is a beautiful thing to behold. The right people saw this tonight. The Real Chairman on AF1 saw it. Essentially, that's what really matters. Adam Schiff better be looking for a very remote cabin.
1321294457694785538 2020-10-28 11:35:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> #bobulinsky Thank You Tony . Thank You Tucker. So many take aways from that powerful interview. Just think @AdamSchiff just like Hunter left his Laptop, you tonight just played that Russia Card one time too many. You poked the wrong bear Son &amp; he's coming after you. Good Luck!
1321292655335247873 2020-10-28 11:28:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RealJamesWoods Thank You James. I’m proud to be just one of 2.6 million. Yeah, that feels good.
1321290368684642307 2020-10-28 11:19:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RealJudasGoat Probably the best interview I’ve ever seen. Tony is telling the gospel truth. Adam Schiff had better not get within 6 ‘ of Tony B.
1321289346373341188 2020-10-28 11:15:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Chairman @JoeBiden You are a gd son of a bitch pathological liar.
1321280612716535808 2020-10-28 10:40:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Not finished with the interview yet, but we need to deny @JoeBiden any plausible chance of winning. (...Tony Bobulinski is very, very credible.)

1321269411085336576 2020-10-28 09:55:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers I often have a nap 20-40 min, feel incredible afterwards. The nap is different type of sleep. You’re not allowing your body to into full 6-8 hr sleep mode. It’s like a Twilight mode. I like it.
1321261769331933184 2020-10-28 09:25:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @wjarbuckles1 It’s true, but it’s okay. So many great people here in class taking notes!
1321261446416617472 2020-10-28 09:24:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Treep52 I will. Question...will CNN/ MSNBC continue to deny this? I don’t need a lot of convincing, I’m up to speed on a lot of this... (except the most important last hour!)
1321260528866529280 2020-10-28 09:20:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @henvar72 Nice. Trump can put that on the Jumbo Tron at the Rally.

1321258863123808257 2020-10-28 09:13:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Ghostlmmortal I’m not kidding, but it’s okay. I’ve got plenty of great people here who have it &amp; I can re watch it. Where we go one we go all, except Stable John who fell asleep.

1321257633068662784 2020-10-28 09:09:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Well that is embarrassing. Seriously I had a nap during the Bobulinski Interview on Tucker. Did I miss anything?
1321245557944315905 2020-10-28 08:21:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Silver_Tape_ Probably not.

1321240189373566976 2020-10-28 07:59:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RogueAlexz Biden rally today. There is some video on twitter here today, of him walking down some stairs to the podium. Looks like an occult ritual to me.

Every scene we are seeing I don’t think has even been written into one movie. Closest I can think of is Series “24” &amp; that went for 8 seasons?

Again Trump is correct in saying, he was never qualified to accept that position, which he himself basically agrees. What we didn’t know was Big Guy getting a cut.
1320599537057103872 2020-10-26 13:33:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TX_Justus True. We can always blame autocorrect &amp; worse still say we got hacked.

1320561127051329536 2020-10-26 11:01:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You see, I’m making a point. Trump our Master Showman in Chief hammered home every day the slogan. Make America Great Again. He even changed it from KAG, due to Covid, back to MAGA. I think it helps. Come to think of it. Joe didn’t do one rally. I know. The Science.

1320539457825587200 2020-10-26 09:35:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> My bad...this was screen grabbed by Pro Trumpers, whilst Biden was doing a live Fundraiser.  My God...the man is a walking grenade. What can I say? Digital War. Moves. Counter Moves.
1320538293256089600 2020-10-26 09:30:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @delmartian4 He is...but notice the clip is from a Pro-Biden Group. If Dan Scavino posted Trump with a flub like that he would lose his job. Things are not adding up? Twilight Zone here.
1320537275814400000 2020-10-26 09:26:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This was right in front of me , I missed it! This video was posted by a Pro-Biden Group. WTF? is going on? Are folks trying to just torpedo his Campaign like they did to Bloomberg, with the Gay Ice Cream? Up is Down, Down is Up. Are they just getting ready to make the excuses?

1320526754176380928 2020-10-26 08:44:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights @skyfallingsoon I think so re the last sentence. President Trump won’t allow that. Trump also held back for very strong valid reasons. Nothing will become organic from the Left &amp; Patriots will not be intimidated. Not this time.

1320503333556109312 2020-10-26 07:11:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It’s off of the charts. I had others comment, Nurses etc, saying the anger are also signs of the Dementia. “ You ain’t happy!” Joe.
1320502671967547392 2020-10-26 07:09:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RealJamesWoods Why not? Really. They put a fake picture of Rudy Guiliani up from the Borat movie. I’m not playing nice.

The economy was doing pretty well &amp; the massive inflation that peanut farmer Jimmy Carter had bestowed upon the Country was in the rear view mirror. Things were going well.
1320497751415681024 2020-10-26 06:49:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GuidoFawkes1776 Should be a great business.

1320496570203131904 2020-10-26 06:44:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GuidoFawkes1776 Yes!

1320487307397402624 2020-10-26 06:08:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChadMyers333 Chaos won't last long. It won't be organic. I remember protesters quit several years ago after they were not paid. Good Patriots are not in the mood for needless violence. That's all I can say.

1320483077567639553 2020-10-26 05:51:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @COsweda Carlos, there is something really strange about the Biden/Harris Campaign &amp; I can't explain it. Any thoughts?
1320482632321298432 2020-10-26 05:49:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @joannferg Yeah...it's just something. I'm not a Thomas Wictor, so I don't have the eloquent words to describe it, but it's definitely very strange.
1320480044028887040 2020-10-26 05:39:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Something is really off &amp; amiss with the Biden Campaign. (I'm quite aware of the Placeholder Theory). So many questions? (Ha...Comey!)  Running, trying to lose? (Harris payoff $$$)  I do expect a Trump Win, the enthusiasm is off of the charts.
1320478235948298240 2020-10-26 05:31:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow I saw that this morning. That is SO plausible. I'm talking in general about, well let's put it this way, for a while there our beloved WhiteHouse was a BathHouse. Leave it at that. Trump mentioned so many little clues about the general condition of the WH. It all makes sense now.
1320476995298357249 2020-10-26 05:27:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @0nearewe Nothing to surprise us there.

1320475499722752000 2020-10-26 05:21:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I only read about what Hunter was up to yesterday, but got enough information to make this statement. I want to thank Melania Trump for fumigating and disinfecting the White House before she moved in. (They had to have known.) Smart. Very Smart.

1320397367535779846 2020-10-26 00:10:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Biden just called another LID. I think every vote that his been cast for him shall be considered null &amp; void. Next Election should be Nov 2024. Yeah, that should do it.

1320286343218352129 2020-10-25 16:49:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me It was something like that. Thanks. Maybe that was it. I thought I saw one with the red tie draped around his neck...but this would have worked. In the end I liked that one I chose, kinda dramatic, almost noir. 👍🇺🇸🤠
1320284190974242817 2020-10-25 16:40:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Thanks. I was looking for the picture of him walking across the lawn without a tie, end of the day &amp; when I saw that pic WOW! I often wonder what it’s like for him in The Quietest Moments? I’m sure there’s prayer &amp; guidance from JFK &amp; Abe. He just talks about it too often.
1320277976554954753 2020-10-25 16:16:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Sometimes it’s not your speeches, not your rallies (3x Today), not your Peace deals, trade deals...it’s the quietest moment like this at the end of the longest day, I have the utmost respect for what you carry on shoulders. Thank You, Mr. President @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/CAtN1RnBqS

1320275121915883521 2020-10-25 16:04:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow You got it. Quite clever really. The whole Q operation/ scheme/ marketing is one of the greatest ideas in History...particularly in this our first True Cyber era &amp; the Digital Wars we are encountering. I even resisted Twat for years, not caring where someone ate lunch.

This is not done in a bad banner but to keep a finger on the pulse of Patriots for what we want. 1A, 2A etc. I know you’re into software &amp; this can be done.

1320264257565454416 2020-10-25 15:21:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Another little interesting I like about Trump. We all know at heart he likes to talk at the Contractor level with some choice language. Not once has he ever said, GFYS bitch to any of the reporters. Jim Acosta included. He should have. I’ve never seen a more rude disgusting bunch  https://t.co/GMR44iTOm6
1320262619094155269 2020-10-25 15:15:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It’s 100,000 BC. I’m not leaving the cave. There’s a Dinosaur out there man!
1320262195024834560 2020-10-25 15:13:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Great Point. If Joe Biden was stupid &amp; dumb not to know his son was on the Board of Burisma earning $183,000 a month, he would never be my President. What a dumb ass!
1320260412907024384 2020-10-25 15:06:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @spetry9 They went back &amp; found an old tweet of mine in which I had recommended that Hillary should face a ......squad before dawn. Had to delete it. I thought it was reasonable. I even offered a last meal &amp; cigar. They didn’t see it my way.
1320258494964981760 2020-10-25 14:58:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SSG_PAIN You’ll also notice that the MSM has never mentioned the powerful EO’s that Trump has executed. Interesting because they can strip away all your assets for human trafficking. Dec 2017.
1320254590315495425 2020-10-25 14:43:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’ve never mentioned this once in 33k tweets, but if I thought Q or Anons were into some nefarious evil stuff, would have walked away 2 + yrs ago. I’ve lived long enough to see the good &amp; the bad. All the folks I mingle love their families, their Faiths, their Country &amp; Trump.
1320253554607620098 2020-10-25 14:39:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Infiltration not Invasion. I’m noticing these anti Q attacks that were ramped up this past several months were in anticipation of all the news we are getting. These @CNN @MSNBC hacks, this Witch Savannah Guthrie also, are ALL in on it. They propagate an evil sickness.
1320252075297566720 2020-10-25 14:33:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ Agreed.
1320250224774836225 2020-10-25 14:25:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ That’s pretty messed up isn’t it?
1320250120768679938 2020-10-25 14:25:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @terryca53306307 Think there was a kew drop stating that. If not it’s Orwell. Lot of creepy things are not right with this World now. Fortunately Trump &amp; many good people are aware of this. ( ..,that includes us. We are the Good Guys. I have no desire to be on Their side.)
1320248790314487808 2020-10-25 14:20:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @filmdude63 I was thinking today, would have been an irony had Hunter been into the Shower thing? Maybe?? I’ve followed Trump since 1987, having dabbled in RE &amp; business. Visited his office in 91. He’s always been a clean freak/ germaphobe, so when those stories came out my Radar went up.
1320247457314304004 2020-10-25 14:14:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I agree. Heck I think the NY post is still banned here for what emails? 2020 An Election like no other. My theory is on Hunters computer were details of The Dark Winter. Far greater implications for humanity than his one night stands.
1320246002276728832 2020-10-25 14:09:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SaberX01 I’m trying to take a lot of this in, but the ChyNa people releasing this are anti communist within the Country. Makes sense. I did business in Hong Kong for 35 years, they hated the Mainland. ( ..,even more so now!)
1320245069232758784 2020-10-25 14:05:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The information coming out is metaphorically like a dam bursting. ( I know, I know). I don’t know how Twat can stop it. Hunter’s dalliances only really show he is complicit &amp; compromised. (CP ??) Information on Joe Biden is beyond repair for him. Biden is done.  https://t.co/QkfAkOnNx3
1320240298010636289 2020-10-25 13:46:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SaberX01 @brenner_colleen Wouldn’t you consider that everything we do is a bit uphill? Probably why we get frustrated. I’ve said this so often, but look what Trump does for us everyday. I still think millions of us banging at the keyboards helps. I have to believe that. (...not easy.)
1320238690271064065 2020-10-25 13:40:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DarleneIronCity He did.
1320236857309851648 2020-10-25 13:32:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hmcd123 Yes. She’s a Democrat.
1320236719812214785 2020-10-25 13:32:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Side note. I chose not to R/T any Hunter Video links today ( not a Saint, just wasn’t interested), but my point here is Twitter shut everyone &amp; every link real quick, yet they were real pleased to share the fake Rudy Guilani Borat scene. Imagine if Don Jr. had a tape? No ban!
1320232705582272512 2020-10-25 13:16:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Blackstonecomms @3days3nights That’s pretty common. Happens frequently. They will come back. ( I’m fairly sure)...though I have seen that before they ice an account. Can’t even believe we are having this discussion. ( The Censorship)
1320231535673442309 2020-10-25 13:11:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Blackstonecomms @3days3nights I noticed 3d is restricted, but then I click again  it comes good. I’m surprised that 3d would be, because he is certainly smart enough not to R/T anything salacious about Hunter Biden. I know we are all shadow banned &amp; losing followers.

1319552337581535234 2020-10-23 16:12:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Hey Big Guy @JoeBiden You've never explained why you had to drop out of the Presidential Race in 1988?
1319552040125689856 2020-10-23 16:11:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @4heartandsoul It was 3,500 years ago...long time ago 1974. The music was good then. It wasn't angry. You could listen to entire Albums. They were cohesive. The music would take you places as you sat on Bean Bag chairs!
1319551062060060673 2020-10-23 16:07:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SantinosCigars You get it. It's a hassle but it's also a fail safe option.
1319549955200040960 2020-10-23 16:03:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MoparChris669 Not hard to figure out. I forgot to add to muh original tweet, HE KNEW. These birds all flock together.
1319549656221716480 2020-10-23 16:02:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @4heartandsoul Saw them perform live. One of the few groups I've seen that were the same live as studio album. True musicians.
1319548997866983424 2020-10-23 15:59:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He all but did. He asked about "Big Guy"...subtle but good.
1319548705603633153 2020-10-23 15:58:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SantinosCigars There never has been. It's so you can't change a tweet unless you delete it.  Imagine Joe Biden with an edit option?
1319545707020185600 2020-10-23 15:46:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow ...bit of info overload lately, which is fine. Part of me is glad the so called Debates are out of the way, because they are never really satisfying anyway. It was even getting a glimpse of being better when Trump asked the questions of Joe direct. Didn't get an answer, but still

1319528027949199360 2020-10-23 14:36:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You never know when those Aha 💡 bulb moments hit. I’ve been criticizing Joe Biden pretty hard this last 12-18 months. ( rightly so.) Among his many dreadful character flaws, have been calling him steadily a Liar. The Aha is, he’s a freaking Pathological Liar. The worst Liar!
1319526410793349120 2020-10-23 14:29:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ShirtlessPundit Definitely was the most “comfy” of the Debates including Savannah’s Play Pen.

1319515756585861122 2020-10-23 13:47:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> In his 47 years Joe Biden has successfully created one job for his son Hunter, as a bagman, which has enriched his family with millions of Foreign $$. So there’s that.  https://t.co/EQKrj5BIww
1319502507656187909 2020-10-23 12:54:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @17_3_161815214 Nah. Being a smart ass is what I live for.
1319502189472018432 2020-10-23 12:53:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @61_kerry Out of Chris Wallace, Savannah Guthrie , Kristen Welker is the tallest midget in the room.
1319501300711616512 2020-10-23 12:49:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Donald Trump built his debate performance on a Solid Foundation ( ...as a good builder would + he just knew Joe was lying thru his dentures re Foreign Income.) Joe Biden’s debate performance was built on a House of Cards. That’s the difference.
1319500155331043330 2020-10-23 12:45:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I probably just don’t appreciate just how good President Trump’s debate performance was until after the Debate. I know why. Was too busy being a smart ass live tweeting it. Won’t do that next time.
1319499294450171906 2020-10-23 12:42:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @61_kerry I was impressed because I thought President Trump would get “ angrier” ( as he should 😅), but he was very measured &amp; focused. He set some nice little traps which Joe fell into.
1319498047575871488 2020-10-23 12:37:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Fight Club Rule. Never look at your watch during a debate.
1319496972475138048 2020-10-23 12:32:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> As we all know the MSM has been largely crickets on Hunter’s Laptop. Tonight the Donald Trump brilliantly introduced to millions, by planting the seeds of doubt about Joe Biden’s corruption. It was skillful as he didn’t ram it down the audience’s throat. Just who/what is BigGuy?
1319495005782695938 2020-10-23 12:24:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @imglover Aha! We have the Best memes! Kek. 🐸

1319491567162253314 2020-10-23 12:11:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LaTxGal I thought that was Trump’s basic winning point tonight. Biden kept saying, “ I’m gonna fix it” &amp; Trump hammered back every time, “ Why didn’t you?” It left Biden with no response as there was none.
1319486335149768704 2020-10-23 11:50:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Go.
1319485858634887168 2020-10-23 11:48:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Quick thought. Joe Biden’s 47 years in Politics is basically One Half a Century. Ponder that!

1319483486382665730 2020-10-23 11:39:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> To sum up Joe Biden’s debate performance tonight in his words he says he NEVER received a penny in Foreign monies from anyone. Let’s just see how that works out for him, as he also said to judge him on his character. Okay.  https://t.co/ZTYg6tjl2U

1319465864605806592 2020-10-23 10:29:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is by far Trump’s best performance. Joe comes across as angry, it’s just him. His projection is tiresome, but his biggest problem is he always says “ I will do this” &amp; Trump has pounded him all night: “ well then, Why didn’t you?” Very Effective!

1318768971559047170 2020-10-21 12:19:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ I think Stanley Kubrick’s last movie “ Eyes Wide Shut” was a harbinger of things to come. It was a little out there at the time. I liked it as a fan of Kubrick’s work, but many didn’t. It wasn’t a cheery film.

I realize it has to be a Public Relations item in order to win over undecided or Biden Voters who will realize Joe is a crook. It has to be that way.
1318588109706063872 2020-10-21 00:21:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Simple question here. Shouldn’t our Dept. of Injustice be looking into the Biden Crime Family accusations? Not that difficult for them...they have ALL the resources. Technically the MSM should be reporting after the charges are filed. Not up to us to make the case. Hate to say it
1318584708469436416 2020-10-21 00:07:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @kylegriffin1 I can’t even look at Kyle Griffin profile pic. He is a reincarnated Nazi Youth. Worked in the Propaganda Dept. under Goebbels.
1318583371442778113 2020-10-21 00:02:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Has anyone ever seen a negative hashtag on Biden, since they have been on Twitter? No need to reply. Save your valuable digital ink. There are none. Welcome to the Manifesto.
1318580969893289984 2020-10-20 23:52:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Julie36869154 Look here, not there.
1318567845480026116 2020-10-20 23:00:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @wjarbuckles1 I think you will find Chy-Na/Iran work close together on many deals against their enemy, which is us.
1318566819288903680 2020-10-20 22:56:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I don’t care where you stand politically. For example, accusations now about Hunter Biden accepting monies &amp; funneling back to his father Joe Biden. All the he said, she said means nothing to me. The solution? Follow the $$$$. Forensic Accountants can trace ALL money=Answers.
1318563808005124099 2020-10-20 22:44:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Interesting how the Left always blame Russia. Never China. 🤔
1318562810461257728 2020-10-20 22:40:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden pimped out his drug addicted son Hunter, to sell America out.

1318426345060265984 2020-10-20 13:38:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ORGANlCROBOT Why not! What a show, what a show!

1318423947927375873 2020-10-20 13:28:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Imagine if you will. This coming Thursday Night. Donald Trump walks out onto the Debate stage and hands Joe Biden a laptop. “ This is Hunters. I believe he is looking for it.” 🎤 drop.
1318421714959622144 2020-10-20 13:20:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I used to look over at my neighbors yard &amp; think the grass is really greener on the other side. Found out today, it’s just Artificial Turf.

1318416964570685446 2020-10-20 13:01:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When Joe Biden brags about giving $1Billion in aid to Ukraine, then withholding funds until the Prosecutor is fired...then he gets a CUT of said funds paid back to him, that is Taxpayer money that YOU paid &amp; he has stolen it from YOU! Trump should have him arrested at the Debate.  https://t.co/PjkGoxpiRj

Who knows, maybe one day we find out it’s some form of parasite...like in those B grade Sci-Fi movies. Something is up. Check out all the pics of Antifa from Portland Police!

1318358886202580993 2020-10-20 09:10:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Lane_From_Nola @RealRLimbaugh My reply in what to tell Savage, is a take off on Scaramucci replying to the debate moderator Steve Scully, caught lying, by saying he was hacked : “ What do I tell Trump?” Been listening to Rush since 92. I know his sense of humor. He would get my comment. I don’t listen to MS.
1318358003838373888 2020-10-20 09:06:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Lane_From_Nola @RealRLimbaugh Just to clear things up. This was Michael Savage today. Real low class.  https://t.co/OMncxf2U0i

1318298075107008512 2020-10-20 05:08:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ruseriousrtnw Purely as an observer, I think Joe has run a real “lazy” Campaign. Politics aside, Trump is the harder worker.
1318297649347375104 2020-10-20 05:07:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DuckMdd I understand but I think of the two she had a more “ legitimate” ( bad word I know) Campaign by lowly Dem standards.
1318296661349732354 2020-10-20 05:03:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Liz_Estes He is not even of sound mind to cast a Vote for himself. Ineligible all round.
1318296231257337857 2020-10-20 05:01:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Whether you agree with me or not, (...better that you do, no sense in both of us being wrong.) Hillary Clinton ran a better Campaign in 2016 than Joe Biden has in 2020. His has been a very lackluster, unenthusiastic Campaign &amp; now he is exposed as being a genuine criminal.
1318293297673113600 2020-10-20 04:49:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Dems are saying Joe Biden is ahead Nationally by about 11 points, exactly as they were telling us Hillary was, at exactly this same time in 2016. #Trump2020 🇺🇸  https://t.co/kjWL2bjx2G

1318208133227933697 2020-10-19 23:11:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 15 months ago would have been better than with 15 days to go. These guys can’t even order foot long Subs at Subway in that amount of time.

1317957477736927233 2020-10-19 06:35:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SweeneyMomma @JackPosobiec I understand that. His statement was simply mathematically impossible. He’s a strange bird.

1317955954386718720 2020-10-19 06:29:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You can make of this what you will, but I called @JackPosobiec out yesterday for his ridiculous q tweet- he’s always been anti q. He blocked me which is okay, but something is up about him, that’s all.  https://t.co/25uL6MmPaD

The payments made to him via his son Hunter from Ukraine,Russia &amp; China have made him subject to blackmail &amp; compromise. He is a National Security Risk! The #CCP own him thru Bank China.

I'm sure though there might be some little commie upstart Dem Mayors or Gov's that may try to pull some stunts. Wouldn't put it past them? After all, the Mask wearing is a scam unto itself.

1317637607405223937 2020-10-18 09:24:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @IWill1947 Zero. I guess what I'm saying is,  if a Nazi guard with a gun is standing at Voting booth &amp; says wear your Mask or you can't Vote? I'm saying wear the damn mask to cast a vote for Trump. If you try not to wear a mask to prove how right you are &amp; he shoots you dead we ALL lose.
1317636441803927552 2020-10-18 09:19:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @VincentCrypt46 What if you actually identify as a Robot? Not a Bot, ...a Robot. Hmmn.

1317625913547268096 2020-10-18 08:37:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PhuShore Smart.
1317625732055461889 2020-10-18 08:37:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Most people have shown some common sense, by saying only if absolutely, necessary. Which is the correct answer to give Trump a Vote. There were a couple of stoics that said never under any circumstance. They also would not put the Oxygen Mask on while the plane is going down!
1317624645739188227 2020-10-18 08:32:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You created just ONE in your life, for Hunter, then took 50% of his paycheck. Way to go Pops.

1317623630990168065 2020-10-18 08:28:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DuckMdd Consider a mask going behind enemy lines for a special mission to Win the War.
1317623348847837186 2020-10-18 08:27:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @FloreFlos That really is my whole point. I hate &amp; loathe masks with every molecule within me. But his VOTE is more important.
1317622751889223680 2020-10-18 08:25:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DuckMdd I applaud some common sense. Thank You.

1317619397263945730 2020-10-18 08:11:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AdamSmi56523745 Thanks for your Vote. Your stubborn pride is more important.
1317619196566540288 2020-10-18 08:11:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Weak argument, no one is talking about the drug addiction. We are talking about the corruption. ( what's this Hunter's Fervent Wishes?) Big take away...she is acknowledging the existence of Hunter's emails! This folks is the real deal. More to be revealed.
1317616259039518720 2020-10-18 07:59:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BarbHaugen I'm with you. That was my original intent to establish.
1317615533701832704 2020-10-18 07:56:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BarbHaugen That's all I'm saying. Vote for Trump &amp; then never wear another one forever. It's tyranny.
1317615183754244096 2020-10-18 07:55:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @scupp_anon87 National Mask Burning Day Nov 4th. Why Not?
1317614981798481921 2020-10-18 07:54:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1978NCAAChamps1 @4annegs I understand, but what if it was No Mask then you can't Vote? Big difference. I'm saying, hold your nose, wear the damn mask, because Voting for Trump is more important. I also think there will a a mask burning day on Nov 4th.
1317614379987206145 2020-10-18 07:52:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @K3T3R @SmilelyLoriLynn It was world wide. Only so many characters in a tweet. You will see good history books written about this whole debacle very soon. It was complex, cunning &amp; sinister. It's Trump vs The World. Trump is Winning.

They don't work anyway...says so on the side of the Box! It was a control mechanism by Dems to secure Votes. Just another Crooked Scheme.
1317611575583281152 2020-10-18 07:40:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SusanCarmona1 Exactly. Every situation is unique &amp; different. That's on old expression from where I come from.

1317610080242520065 2020-10-18 07:34:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LivFree20 I think it's being realistic. The whole thing has been a control mechanism to help the Dems. IMO. I think Trump will win on Nov 3rd, and it will fade away quickly. I live in SoCal &amp; people are wearing them less &amp; less. Just an observation on society.
1317609225179197440 2020-10-18 07:31:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @QaRon18 Well done. I pick my battles.

1317608563129286657 2020-10-18 07:28:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LivFree20 I think they will die a natural death on Nov 4th.

1317607162248491009 2020-10-18 07:23:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> For all the people that will crawl across broken glass to Vote for Trump, will you wear a mask to Vote?

1317562338241736704 2020-10-18 04:25:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump’s 2 Scoops of Ice Cream got more air time &amp; discussion than the Hunter Biden’s emails story which is arguably the biggest October story of 2020. The MSM Media is just the Advertising/PR Dept. of the @DNC &amp; does it ever show. Same as it ever was.

1316994026936004608 2020-10-16 14:46:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @pierce_lorene @anglo13 @SavannahGuthrie Thanks for noticing! Her job was to rattle President Trump &amp; get him in a Gotcha Trap. She failed. The President was assertive, not angry &amp; his thinking is too quick. Really quick.
1316991587805638656 2020-10-16 14:37:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We’ve had so many drops &amp; clues on this one. I think “ those that scream the loudest “ slogan was modeled after him.
1316990183095431168 2020-10-16 14:31:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JacksWorstnigh2 Rings a bell. Birds of a feather. That’s the polite answer.
1316989894187642881 2020-10-16 14:30:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @masuruha2 They like to give it to us. President Trump has taught us to give it back to them twice as hard. We wouldn’t have known otherwise. I don’t have any better explanation.
1316988471744090113 2020-10-16 14:24:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Hi Adam: “ What’s going on?”  https://t.co/ycITFviovK
1316985317002375169 2020-10-16 14:12:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Would you like to stick your neck out &amp; debate me on that?
1316977915670667264 2020-10-16 13:42:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Smile an everlasting smile.   https://t.co/cckTVAXUFq
1316974247307317248 2020-10-16 13:28:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown My Money, My Choice. ...there’s my answer.
1316973880242802689 2020-10-16 13:26:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me Bookmark this.
1316970568290324480 2020-10-16 13:13:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Haha! Notice in the original it looks like a reflection of someone with a towel around their waist. You can see the shoulder outline, but the shower handle obscures the face.
1316969138447855617 2020-10-16 13:08:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Hey @SenSchumer This is after the debate. Does President Trump look tired? Your hair plugs must be coming loose again.  https://t.co/gaUAlPfKP5
1316966286216265733 2020-10-16 12:56:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ncsunsetlover Same way they added a fly to Mike Pence, they remove the fangs!
1316966020502986755 2020-10-16 12:55:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @notonmywqtch Makes sense.
1316965067037036546 2020-10-16 12:51:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @jarzynma @trump_gigi Cuba better, or the Aleutian Islands off of the coast of Alaska.
1316964801000710145 2020-10-16 12:50:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @jarzynma Something like that. Wake up everyday &amp; simply don’t need any aspect of them in our daily lives.  They want to Tax ( You ) to keep up Their lifestyles though.
1316963039216914434 2020-10-16 12:43:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Did you hear that?  https://t.co/HlBOjAxLhq

1316954971896750082 2020-10-16 12:11:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AnOpiner @beardly01 @ChanelRion The content is probably accurate, the style of writing doesn’t seem right? Wouldn’t you post this as a pure Anon? Anyway, with 18 days to go, I’ll quote Trump from aways back: “ You’ll find out!”
1316953206249918464 2020-10-16 12:04:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DickCheeseburg1 With a Gif like this, why yes I do.
1316952995997896709 2020-10-16 12:03:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Is there any way that we can actually legally divorce ourselves from the Democrats? We don’t need these users &amp; abusers in our lives, but they sure as heck want us around to tell us what to do. Naturally we are going to need a good settlement from them for ruining 4 yrs for us.
1316952044738125824 2020-10-16 12:00:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @notonmywqtch They do!

1316947366726062082 2020-10-16 11:41:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DickCheeseburg1 Thanks. Just like waiting at an airport for 4 hrs in between flights. That’s another slow ride of time.

1316945314876690433 2020-10-16 11:33:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trump_gigi Here’s something strange for you. I go over &amp; read the lefty comments under say Alyssa Milano etc. &amp; they  think Savannah was a champ &amp; Trump got pulverized, then I realize we are living in Parallel Universes!because none of us are living in their Bizarre World! Not for a second
1316944091012354050 2020-10-16 11:28:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 18 days till the Election. How come time is slowing down?

1316925294415106049 2020-10-16 10:13:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @VAGirlForever @SenSchumer Seriously...he didn't look tired. If he was we would have noticed. Trump was actually pretty pumped up at the end...they loved his smile!🤠

1316915944694927362 2020-10-16 09:36:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> F*ck a duck Chuck, is this all you've got? Trump looked more than ready for another hour.
1316915573901721601 2020-10-16 09:35:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Some folks in NBC audience tonight are asking, what's this Qanon thing? I hope we can do them proud. Peace is the Prize.
1316913809198600193 2020-10-16 09:28:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Even though her face is blurred, she represents millions of fine American women who are but part of the Silent Majority. We love You!
1316912453486284806 2020-10-16 09:22:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Why the hell would you do that? Trump put shit on Antifa. The ones who are doing the looting &amp; rioting. We are all about peace Bro!

1316910162469408768 2020-10-16 09:13:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Savannah came out of the gate quick. She was like the drunk at the bar. Trump was too strong for her and wore her down. He was assertive but not angry. Masterpiece Theater.
1316909193027309569 2020-10-16 09:09:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @montana2552 You are Tony after all!

1316908345048051714 2020-10-16 09:06:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AnnieVarrr He calmed her down at the end. The man is a Lion Tamer.

1316900125751476226 2020-10-16 08:33:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump handled the Qanon question really well. He made HIS point &amp; he didn't denounce (why should he?)
1316899278971760640 2020-10-16 08:30:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Guys if you ever marry someone like Savannah, get an annulment. I promise you will be better off.
1316898741735940096 2020-10-16 08:28:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If President Trump _________ Savannah, I'm still Voting for him!

1316883535743967232 2020-10-16 07:27:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Germanchick1973 Still wise as a backup. What {They} did today could be a test run. Not much {They} won't stop at to protect precious Joe. The Hunter Laptop may be a bigger expose than what we even knew about. The real sick thing is FBI sat on it for 9+ mths. Deep State is DEEP.

1316810731526840320 2020-10-16 02:38:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HandsomeSean1 No. Even though Hunter is a drug addict, the main issue is to expose the corruption of the crooked deals that Joe &amp; Hunter cooked up to enrich themselves, but worse still are the acts of Treason to sell out our Country. They are both high level Nat. Sec risk &amp; Joe is ineligible.

It won’t change our Votes for this generation but its our duty to protect the next. Not wasting muh time on this planet to see this happen. Fortunately I’m in great Patriot company here.
1316779805937811463 2020-10-16 00:35:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is a National Security risk.
1316779492010938369 2020-10-16 00:34:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @internetusr It is. I can’t sugar coat it.
1316775945357860865 2020-10-16 00:20:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This tweet is aging really well. Joe Biden isn’t though.
1316772752930422785 2020-10-16 00:07:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Jcashfan33 What we’ve seen this past 4 yrs is just an attempt to cover it all up. I can see Trumps valid frustration. Weak laws protect them, because (they) write them. Many RINO’s involved also. I guess we just carry on &amp; Vote Trump.
1316772084475785217 2020-10-16 00:05:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Jcashfan33 My last thoughts last night before drifting off is what horrible tangled web of lies &amp; deceit for the entire Obama Administration. It was run as a Crime Syndicate with all players getting major deals. Cue has mentioned so many times the Slush funds at taxpayers expense.

1316604261128572928 2020-10-15 12:58:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon It’s beyond awesome. Trump just doesn’t do rallies, it’s a complete show. A total experience. Sound, light, action &amp; cameras. Biden Team have virtually zero production values, although he’s a difficult one to prop up &amp; make look good.
1316603110261886980 2020-10-15 12:53:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CoreyG471 Welcome. Pretty smart how to figure out threads on your first day.
1316602581574057984 2020-10-15 12:51:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @beardly01 This time of year have to give certain stories anywhere from 24-36-48 hrs to percolate. Now the Biden story this morning immediately resonated because Cue has been dropping enough clues + Burisma admitted in court to bribes + Biden bragged on tape about the 1B$. Expect crazy.

1316580268078063616 2020-10-15 11:22:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1FreeInhabitant I did a few weeks ago also. I could see a certain deepness &amp; direction he was heading in. The history of any &amp; all Religions is a real tough subject in which to become an expert on. Particularly in what I saw was such a short relative period of time. I know he is young 26? ...
1316578651681427456 2020-10-15 11:16:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lex31555 Surprisingly fair interview IMO. I liked the fact that the host let the guest answer the questions without cutting off or talking over.
1316576197153677312 2020-10-15 11:06:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BenKenobi_F1 @mflew2 The tagline of “Where’s Hunter?” was planted many many months ago. From a marketing viewpoint it’s very memorable.
1316563681950408705 2020-10-15 10:16:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Kalozap @StormWatchGirl @TwitterSafety @PressSec Moves &amp; Countermoves. Beautiful isn’t it?
1316561630285557762 2020-10-15 10:08:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TheNickDeRose Sure. He’s forcing them now into bad errors, mistakes &amp; risky moves. He did the same with Dr. Fauci &amp; CDC. During the Republican primaries he did so against 16 others. I also believe he caused Bloomberg to stumble badly. He was a concern, but only because of his massive $$$.
1316560293116297217 2020-10-15 10:03:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump is breaking Twitter.
1316558841354485761 2020-10-15 09:57:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Again want to thank @TwitterSafety  for blocking White House Press Secretary’s account @PressSec Kayleigh McEnany. If a Nuclear Missile is heading straight for us, we will never f.....g know about it!
1316557241625976833 2020-10-15 09:51:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Just want to thank @twittersafety for censoring Joe Biden’s emails today. We dodged a bullet there. This means other Countries can’t see them also &amp; never be in a position to blackmail Joe Biden right?
1316551314596274178 2020-10-15 09:27:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Iceberg Ahead! There is so much moar. (... Pops was taking half of Hunter’s income. Love you Dad.)

1316547096313425920 2020-10-15 09:11:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LawNuse Don't know, but what if this was blackmail &amp; everything was just released today, because Hunter couldn't afford to pay the required terms? Stranger things have happened this past 4-5 years.
1316545420940595200 2020-10-15 09:04:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I don’t know, but who filmed it? Someone posed a theory to me today that there was no laptop left for repair, but this is all blackmail released. In other words Hunter didn’t pay up!
1316544429994385409 2020-10-15 09:00:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m glad Dad’s been pulling the Lids everyday, because I’m so f.....g wasted &amp; out of it.  https://t.co/YKLqTRldb6

1316253455648919552 2020-10-14 13:44:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I think Adam Schiff is going to try Impeach Qanon. Good Luck with that!

1316219629249810432 2020-10-14 11:29:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @idontneednostin We know the enthusiasm level is real &amp; conversely Joe Biden has virtually zero, for a whole host of reasons. Honest Trump supporters are going to turn out en masse to place an honest Vote. I 🙏 votes are counted properly. All you can do?

1316207532394733569 2020-10-14 10:41:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers He has been awfully quiet lately. I consider him one of the backroom boys cooking up dirty deals late at night. He is a ringleader. An ugly bastard too, but smart, evil &amp; ugly.
1316206477435039744 2020-10-14 10:37:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> One of the many reasons Joe Biden is a lousy candidate, is that as a salesman, no one is buying what he is selling. Plenty of PANIC to go around.

1316079613655699456 2020-10-14 02:13:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump yesterday unleashed his secret weapon, his October Surprise. It’s: JOE BIDEN
1316056490461990912 2020-10-14 00:41:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Oct 13-2020 This day in History.
1316055536303964165 2020-10-14 00:37:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Donald J. Trump's popularity is breathtaking!

1315898398004838400 2020-10-13 14:13:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @StoneofYourOwn I didn’t think Trump would have his double in the front row, too obvious. Might be okay to have close by to fool the crowd or journalists for security reasons.
1315897878523514880 2020-10-13 14:11:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @StoneofYourOwn The Japanese Trump. I didn’t speculate, because I just didn’t know. Thanks!

1315543999969550337 2020-10-12 14:45:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @spetry9 So many media were complicit in the cover up. They would be turning themselves in. As Trump keeps saying: “ Biggest Scandal in US Political History!”...you’d think someone would want to cover it. 😅
1315542404003368960 2020-10-12 14:38:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RogueAlexz Solar chargers are pretty easy to come by. They have come down in price this past 2 years.  https://t.co/iv8nt8Ec99
1315541294949691393 2020-10-12 14:34:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RogueAlexz Amazon also have them. Different carriers have different plans, but pay as you go appeals to me as it would be used rarely. The solar charger is separate. Any should work to power up a cellphone. I have one, just moved so it’s in a box, until I can find it.
1315540467472269314 2020-10-12 14:31:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RogueAlexz The tweet was tongue in cheek about people who get away, then fill the need to be addicted to the cell phone whilst enjoying serenity of nature.

1315531279073382400 2020-10-12 13:54:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is about 3 weeks away from entering a nursing home. My best guess. Nov 3rd or 4th.
1315530816932335616 2020-10-12 13:52:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dems have zero chance of really attacking ACB’s religion, because if it’s a cult/crazy/wacky - it’s exactly the same one the Nancy Pelosi &amp; Joe Biden follow. Let them fire at themselves. Dumbest Political Party in modern times.

1315436896776978433 2020-10-12 07:39:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> As a small business owner I wouldn’t even hire Joe Biden to be a greeter at the local supermarket. His people management skills are borderline atrocious. He simply is not qualified to be CIC of the Great Republic of the United States.

1315425032542146560 2020-10-12 06:52:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @martingeddes I sell on AMZ as a 100% independent supplier. Thousands of Mom &amp; Pops do. We have no other way of storing &amp; shipping Inventory. We make many ( &amp; doing more) manufacturing in USA. Goods are of excellent quality &amp; very competitive prices. I understand however.

1315359343038984192 2020-10-12 02:31:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DazeDonkey All this notwithstanding, I got turned off years ago with all the creeping Liberalism in the plots. I think it started with “ The Hand the Rocks the Cradle” &amp; the Liberal Cuck husband being an idiot.
1315355193207189504 2020-10-12 02:14:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dls00741 @Beer_Parade Did something similar. I also have a respect for those frontline folks. I talk to everyone I meet...I question them directly, they HATE wearing the masks all day. It’s unhealthy ( Staph?).
1315350731394752512 2020-10-12 01:57:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Yes.
1315350494483673089 2020-10-12 01:56:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beer_Parade As much as I admire all my fellow Patriots not wearing a Mask ( I don’t 99%), until this Mask Madness ends, which it will, I defy any of you to take an International Flight? You simply cannot get on the plane. Also ER visits? Just saying.
1315336966838218752 2020-10-12 01:02:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown Hatred is a Vision Blocker.
1315334338276286464 2020-10-12 00:51:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Donald Trump has a genuine vision for America’s Future. The Democrats Vision is Perpetual Slavery of Humanity under their Control. Think I’m kidding? It started with Masks in March 2020.
1315332969066762242 2020-10-12 00:46:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This, is how Donald Trump thinks. I couldn’t post a picture of how Joe Biden thinks, because there was nothing there.  https://t.co/HgH5iSBXzA

1315200262605205504 2020-10-11 15:59:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump had said, when they look back at him from a future time, declaring the MSM Fake News, will be considered one of his achievements. I believe that, now with what we know.

1315156246832377858 2020-10-11 13:04:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @FathomThat1 Even Donald Trump acknowledged on RUSH, that Hillary Clinton was “ smarter”, by that he meant more clever evil being aware. He also stated that Joe Biden is just “not there”.
1315155204300435457 2020-10-11 13:00:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hmcd123 @Americanlll Not this brand of watch, but the winding mechanism is more clearly scene. Not to be a conspiracy theorist but it’s easier to see the time like this without drawing attention &amp; moving your eyes. That is wearing inside your wrist.

1315127397050589184 2020-10-11 11:09:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow I think Trump is right ( ...as usual ) Biden is the sacrifice/placeholder for Harris. Even though she is unpopular, she is the choice of the Progressive Radical Left. She’s a scary Dude in real life.
1315121894161489922 2020-10-11 10:47:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is the worst candidate ever to run for US President.

1315072813485547521 2020-10-11 07:32:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CarrieKikki We keep spray bottle by the shower with Vinegar+  teaspoon of PalmOlive Dish soap. Spray on the glass, leave 5&lt;mins, rinse off. Maybe once every 10 days use a micro fiber cloth to sparkle finish. Wasted years on fancy cleaners/sponges to remove Calcium/Lime stains! Life changing.

1315066489578287104 2020-10-11 07:07:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> One of the strangest takeaways from 2020 is that the Citizens of Seattle, Portland, Chicago &amp; New York will most likely re elect the same Mayors again! Time will tell. For me, it makes a great case for the beautiful small quiet towns across America. 🇺🇸

1315034508438073344 2020-10-11 05:00:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Real support for Joe Biden would only be 20-30% at most if true results &amp; reporting were known. GasLighting from Media &amp; Fraudulence in Ballots makes up the difference. There is close to zero enthusiasm otherwise.

1314630894485815296 2020-10-10 02:16:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Rush Limbaugh today very astutely pointed out that during the 2 hours on the air with President Trump, uninterrupted, not once did the President demur, deflect, delay, lose train of thought or cough. Could Joe Biden do the same?
1314629203644432385 2020-10-10 02:10:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I was on the fence about Voting, but after hearing President Trump so clear, vibrant &amp; healthy today, he's got my Vote.
1314628140786802690 2020-10-10 02:05:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump on Rush Limbaugh today:  "The people are smarter than the Media!"
1314612663704457216 2020-10-10 01:04:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> let me be perfectly clear. Scully was not hacked because Scaramucci REPLIED to him! These two are nothing but lying dog faced pony soldiers.
1314608797210431493 2020-10-10 00:48:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BoSnerdley 1. Can Rush ask our President please: When does Joe Biden release his full medical report &amp; mental evaluation? No one has a clue? 2. President Trump can ask Joe Biden, why did he have to drop out of 1988 Presidential Race? ( he was caught lying!) 🇺🇸
1314602918322946048 2020-10-10 00:25:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @unseen1_unseen Good question. Great answer.

1314438553737129986 2020-10-09 13:32:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Scaramucci I'd like to see Joe Biden medical physical please? He's nearly 80 and doesn't look good? Been coughing a lot, into his hand. He sometimes doesn't seem there? Missing a lot of time on Campaign trail with constant Lids. We need this transparency as Joe himself says constantly.
1314434927744614400 2020-10-09 13:18:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon just noticed. thks

1314417043853115395 2020-10-09 12:06:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @treewall2 @cjtruth @JuliansRum The night after the Debate Trump was in Duluth MN?...it was really cold, he cut the speech short by about 30 minutes &amp; he was speaking very quickly. (...sign of I’m not feeling great, let’s wrap this up.) I made comments about it that night.
1314415637029027841 2020-10-09 12:01:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon @Christy43250353 @PhillyQ_ @TheOnlooker18 @Bruno062418 @Beer_Parade @All50News @cjtruth @patton6966 He knows Exactly where it came from. Probably to within 1 metre with co ordinates.

Trump did face the torpedo with the cocktail of new medicines. Had he been infirmed longer, {They} would then make the case he wasn’t well enough to be the Candidate. Good vs Evil.
1314413420184133633 2020-10-09 11:52:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon @Christy43250353 @PhillyQ_ @TheOnlooker18 @Bruno062418 @Beer_Parade @All50News @cjtruth @patton6966 I got some minor flak for entertaining the idea that the Covid was an assassination attempt at the Debate. Only Repubs became ill? Dems operate on a very Sick F...k strategy. It’s hard to fathom.
1314410136690028545 2020-10-09 11:39:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow @SteveScully @Scaramucci Exactly. Read Scaramucci’s reply some 20 mins later after his panic attack. Greatest bullshit reply I’ve seen since Adam Schiff at Impeachment. It’s cleverly worded to give plausible denial, but Stable John decodes lies easily.  https://t.co/hsNhPRkRK4

1314401332204167169 2020-10-09 11:04:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I can’t read Trump’s mind, but he is the sort of guy to go into the Lion’s Den just to expose them. He will taunt &amp; mock. Think like a Cat playing with a mouse. It’s fun for Trump. He enjoys this.
1314400658464755714 2020-10-09 11:01:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Wanted! These two men tonight caught rigging the next Presidential Debate. @stevescully @Scaramucci  https://t.co/B346d5aJqJ

1314395114769281024 2020-10-09 10:39:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @wehrme_awake I’m focused on the 1% that rule the 99%. I can’t tell you how many Catholic friends &amp; family, I have. They are all decent people from both Political Parties...they all hate or dislike this Pope, who is with his top people is the 1%...( Example)
1314393743932313600 2020-10-09 10:34:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lilspec03 That too. ✅ Demand transparency. (...can you believe that Goebbels tweets that out every second day demanding transparency!)
1314393264867274754 2020-10-09 10:32:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @paul_furber Let’s see Biden’s records now? He is nearly 80 &amp; doesn’t look good. You need a steady hand and mental acuity to have access to the Nuclear Codes. I’m actually being reasonable.

You know you are operating within a full blown Communist Platform, when there has NEVER been a trending hashtag against Joe Biden. Look tonight &amp; see what bullsh*t trends are against Donald Trump.

1314383454268583936 2020-10-09 09:53:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TTay1223 I was neutral on him, but he amped it up a notch or two last night.
1314383137984536576 2020-10-09 09:52:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom Whether you believe me or not, had President Trump shown such a decline, I would have spotted it. It’s Country over Politics.
1314380320280506368 2020-10-09 09:41:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom It needs to be pushed. You need to be of very sound mind to have access to the Nuclear Codes.
1314379868046462977 2020-10-09 09:39:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @__LRB__ It was good, wasn’t it? Makes you realize that this Is No Country for Old Men, like Biden. President Trump looks &amp; bouncers around like a guy 53-63.
1314378835912056838 2020-10-09 09:35:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I want to see Joe Biden’s complete medical exam results. He’s nearly 80 &amp; he doesn’t look well. President Trump had every known test last weekend &amp; he looks &amp; sounds terrific.

I believe Trump was throwing Biden off with purposeful interruption, as Biden’s prep was all based on linear ( memorized ) thinking. Wasn’t pretty, but was effective.

The AOC crowd can't name a thing about Biden. Can't blame them, he's done nothing. All the Left's comment are against Trump. Never Pro Biden.

1314035094512832513 2020-10-08 10:49:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon You will see the real Kamala &amp; she's a ......
1314034882134245376 2020-10-08 10:48:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Ladydi05D Honestly, I was impressed. This debate isn't my normal Cup of Tea, but I'm glad I stuck around. Had some Cue drops incoming to fill the slowness!
1314034372324913152 2020-10-08 10:46:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Pence was such a gentleman, he pauses enough. He didn't allow Kamala to get angry enough. Quite brilliant really. Harris proves she really is unlikable &amp; a real LIAR. I couldn't do this w/Trump....his mind goes at Warp Speed.
1314030336460771328 2020-10-08 10:30:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @montana2552 I get that. I just don’t think it changes dynamics, as in the outcome.
1314029737514201088 2020-10-08 10:27:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Moderator is a Communist. They just can’t stop with the loaded questions. Kudos to Pence for not letting him get to her. #VPDebate
1314029299578494976 2020-10-08 10:26:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I will not be lectured by the Vice President! ~ Kamala ARROGANCE! #VPDebate
1314028238306377728 2020-10-08 10:22:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> At the end of the day, this debate accounts for Zero. #VPDebate
1314027560452255744 2020-10-08 10:19:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Now she is playing the Arrogant card. Never good. #VPDebate

1314022129701068800 2020-10-08 09:57:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Someone got bored during the #VPDebate  and began dropping.  https://t.co/KOEhlhqyux

1314017481967595520 2020-10-08 09:39:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @gracejohnmom 😅 ..don’t go there.
1314016895104815104 2020-10-08 09:36:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Kamala is a lying dog faced pony soldier.
1314016728477646848 2020-10-08 09:36:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Nit_Lion Scary isn’t she?
1314016263639756802 2020-10-08 09:34:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EdwardCIB Yes. Pence is disarming her. It’s difficult for her to get scrappy &amp; throw mud, Pence just keeps giving her Roses. He’s very specific. She goes off tangent.
1314015774311284736 2020-10-08 09:32:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @montana2552 Yes. 👍
1314014941037223936 2020-10-08 09:29:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Pence is disarming her, by being the gentleman. Kamala isn’t used to that. Not in the way you think, but she prefers scrappy debates. He’s good...from the pure debating aspect.
1314014330552115200 2020-10-08 09:26:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I can’t disagree with that.

1314013285562294272 2020-10-08 09:22:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> CNN anchors are texting each other. They’ve got nothing to talk about after the debate finishes.

1314008053369323522 2020-10-08 09:01:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EdwardCIB I don’t care, seriously. Working to get Trump re-election done. Not much else matters. No point in moving to Australia if Biden wins, is there? Victoria is a Gestapo state now. Maybe South Australia. Adelaide is a beautiful city.
1314007229121486848 2020-10-08 08:58:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 The word “unsustainable” comes to mind. There is never enough revenue generated from fans at games. If no one is watching, Advertising $ fade away. I’m not going to let them know.

1314002151635447808 2020-10-08 08:38:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trishtweety They are shutting us down left, right &amp; center. A friend of mine said, wow, you picked up a lot of followers this last month. I said No, they just shut all the good ones down. He then said, yeh, your tweets are still crappy!

1313975514189553664 2020-10-08 06:52:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I've seen quite a few Cue drops referring to Red October, but today's 4824 was quite the stunner. It was the biggest baddest Reddest October yet!

1313693526568235009 2020-10-07 12:11:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump has been tougher on Chy-Na more than anyone. This cue team has been busy at work since + got back to work. Maybe that’s a coincidence.  https://t.co/DPNZk9HBYz
1313692139054800896 2020-10-07 12:06:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @masuruha2 The evidence is there. Part of me thinks the President needed enough Judges in the right places ( even SC)...so decisions could be made. Look for example at the horrible partisan hack Judge, that Gen Flynn has had to put up with. That’s not justice, that’s being vindictive!

1313672393945018368 2020-10-07 10:48:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Did this broad look at any Cities the Democrats have ruined. Business ruined. People’s lives ended due to unnecessary murder? Journalistic Slut.
1313671636772556803 2020-10-07 10:44:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 I’ve seen more accounts doing that lately. Kind of takes away the open forum aspect.
1313670086348034048 2020-10-07 10:38:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 I hate that. I was trying to be fair to give her credit as it was the first one in my TL.
1313667360448892928 2020-10-07 10:28:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @beardly01 I knew something was up when President Trump landed home so “magnificent” last night. The unhinging was too great. I couldn’t figure it out at the time. Dem insiders must have got the word re declas &amp; they all went 4am.
1313666516324212737 2020-10-07 10:24:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @99Cindygrice Declas by President Trump tonight. See his tweets.
1313666106540748806 2020-10-07 10:23:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @echas3wi Just from memory, when Donald Trump was Campaigning I saw the Dems use violence to stop his  appearance in Chicago. They blocked the road in Arizona. Since then it’s worse with Antifa/BLM. I have a zero tolerance attitude towards that. Don’t like the Dem lies either.

Irrespective of Party affiliation? Even the Left has no shortage of hatred for Donald Trump, yet none of them, not ONE can extoll any virtue or sing praise to Joe Biden.
1313592751057850369 2020-10-07 05:31:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @protestsupply The same people that ran the Polls in 2016 are ( I don’t know how), still in business today. If you compare, the results they claim are nearly identical as 2016. Expect Biden to increase his lead this next two weeks. (Hint: all bogus)

1313349768035233792 2020-10-06 13:26:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If a Karen or Ken says that doesn’t work you bullshit them back ( they deserve it!) by saying this is the latest Nano Particle Electrostatic Technology that Filters &amp; “Science” has proven these to be 3.142 times (be exact!

1313348647732486145 2020-10-06 13:21:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I love capitalism. These folks have invented a completely useless breathable mask. I don’t wear one 99% of the time, but if you need to do an overseas flight or to visit an ER this can work until the Covid crap settles down. I get anxiety from masks.

Besides Joe, science says you are going to lose the Election &amp; you took bribe money from Burisma. You’re really fooked man.

1313303583777906689 2020-10-06 10:22:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SavageDystrophy You have to take a ticket.

1313301985685196802 2020-10-06 10:16:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HigherKingdom We’re gonna need our own Awards Ceremony. Put your thinking cap on for some names? Methinks all the people on the Academy have TDS.
1313301452840865792 2020-10-06 10:14:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @71_blazer Never name them do they?
1313300737850437632 2020-10-06 10:11:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom Watch the Tik Tok videos coming out tomorrow of the sheer panic. They will be acting like we are being invaded by Aliens in War of the Worlds.
1313300345871720450 2020-10-06 10:09:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom He’s acting. The 4am puppet masters have put it out to make it appear that Potus  is not well, blah, blah, blah. The crying &amp; desperation is to appeal at Your emotional level to lure you into a False crisis.
1313299647406903296 2020-10-06 10:06:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SurferPatriot Tis ok.
1313299561780178944 2020-10-06 10:06:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher No.
1313299515902836737 2020-10-06 10:06:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher The trip code is inside the red rectangle. Every cue drop has a trip code. It’s a unique identifier, much like using two factor ID to access your bank account. It’s to prevent hackers. Cue has had to reset “his” code many times (17?) because of repeated attempts to hack in.  https://t.co/DLtSvU9IuI
1313297632635228160 2020-10-06 09:58:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @WhiteRiceCowboy Collecting his thoughts. I’m just playing offense now. Now focus on Biden.
1313297357342081030 2020-10-06 09:57:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @leighgoodison @CherMreD Yes. Who can forget? Then he got into his classic Fredo meltdown. Good times.
1313297034212900865 2020-10-06 09:56:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @patriot1Herb His voice is raised like a school girl. Weird.
1313296746529792000 2020-10-06 09:55:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher I never did figure Wray out. Some are just enigmas that we find out near the end IMO. Good decodes though, because soon now answers will be coming.
1313296240734466048 2020-10-06 09:53:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> That’s all been debunked. He was overcome with joy &amp; composing his thoughts. Now let’s go &amp; look at what that sick f*~k Biden said today about being with 4 year olds. Can’t can you because you are another patsy for #CCP. We know.
1313289108416995328 2020-10-06 09:24:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SurferPatriot I’m good. Restart your phone/desktop? Maybe?  https://t.co/ASZ3OcwcM1

1313282653626408968 2020-10-06 08:59:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1FreeInhabitant @stuartpstevens Something about the Never Trumpers. We sort of know where the Democrats stand, but the Never Trumpers just live in a Political Purgatory. Literally no one wants them.
1313280242945978368 2020-10-06 08:49:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden. Anything you say from herein can &amp; will be used in a Court of Law. Hunter also, if we can find him.

1313274912576995328 2020-10-06 08:28:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> That was a Kek of a homecoming for our President. Reading through many Lefty comments there is always the standard “Hate Trump” coming from them. Have you noticed that not one Lefty account has ever said anything positive about Joe Biden? Interesting huh!  https://t.co/W9RtaVATJr
1313272036068782082 2020-10-06 08:17:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador It’s like the ending of Independence Day. Killed the aliens with a Virus in that one also.
1313271599429107712 2020-10-06 08:15:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador Haha! It was great too! 👍
1313271277574975490 2020-10-06 08:14:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @pheadrick @realDonaldTrump I went through Headick’s timeline. As with most Liberals, every comment is hatred about Donald Trump. You have yet to make one good comment about Joe Biden. We here know why, there are none. You are a phony. Another useless eater.
1313264318461296640 2020-10-06 07:46:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @kate_awakening @OnEdgeOfWonder Got you a follow. The past can be a yawn. The future is Golden.

1313256593232781313 2020-10-06 07:15:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dianevalead Yes &amp; yes.
1313255935184257024 2020-10-06 07:13:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador 👍 It will be a “beauty”. As a guy who likes history, I am thinking that if President Trump is re elected ( he has a very good chance), these last several days will be considered a Turning Point.
1313255134244208640 2020-10-06 07:09:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RobSealeJr1 Yes!

1313233652176674817 2020-10-06 05:44:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We call it the #CryingRoom. Get used to it.

1313223757972955136 2020-10-06 05:05:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> So now all the Liberal Media is NOW against the Science of every Doctor? Liberalism: Pick a subject, any subject &amp; become an instant Expert based on how you feel?

1313216101149368320 2020-10-06 04:34:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Shouldn't Joe  Biden drop out of the race, since Burisma have admitted to bribing him in a Court of Law &amp; we have proof of funds received? Delete your account while you are at it. Useless eater.
1313215325781913600 2020-10-06 04:31:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I mean, just how difficult is it really?
1313208074845388801 2020-10-06 04:02:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I had to stop at: "I think"...thats the real problem there! Tardistan News Network.
1313204168945876992 2020-10-06 03:47:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Legitimate Questions. (...if you think for yourself, you ask {Q}uestions. Reminds me of a group of Mil Intel Anonymous Source?)
1313196455314690048 2020-10-06 03:16:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Sherman is on #CCP payroll. Prove me wrong, Gabs!
1313195897988153345 2020-10-06 03:14:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @noles2552 @JuliansRum ✔️
1313195710334918656 2020-10-06 03:13:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> After the Election, when Donald Trump has won...that last job as a "Never Trumper", won't look good on your resume. Good Luck!
1313195216757641216 2020-10-06 03:11:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dsade2 Yup! Now multiply that for a generation with infiltration &amp; MSM propaganda, you end up with a crop of Antifa. Check out their mug shots from Portland Police. It's like a Meth Head convention.
1313194514744401921 2020-10-06 03:09:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ARC4Freedom Tangled Web. It was coordinated throughout the World. Donald Trump was &amp; is that much of a threat to them.
1313193988849983488 2020-10-06 03:06:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump is leaving the hospital.
1313193602474942467 2020-10-06 03:05:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @noles2552 Mr. Karenstein then...even better.

1313189978780782592 2020-10-06 02:51:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ARC4Freedom Big Picture. It’s all connected. Stay with me.
1313188998211198976 2020-10-06 02:47:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If Donald Trump &amp; Don Jr. had received bribe money from Burisma, as they have admitted in court under penalty of perjury, this would be the biggest story in the world. Not yesterday’s story about Trump wearing a mask. Karen MSM has been screaming for mths...wear a mask. HE DID!
1313179097967726600 2020-10-06 02:07:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @QNukem Powerful, really.
1313165483286302720 2020-10-06 01:13:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Things don’t look good for the Dems on any front. They might have time to sneak one more Impeachment in before the Election.

1313151780100870144 2020-10-06 00:19:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @8Notables I slept in...only read yours now, so I didn't copy your tweet. Great thinking BTW! 😅  https://t.co/T1hG2PHhC6
1313150854522761232 2020-10-06 00:15:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher the takeaway is, the tweets are of sound mind. Short, coherent &amp; to the point. Perfect.
1313150027494166529 2020-10-06 00:12:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Especially after their meltdowns yesterday. Karen's be gone. (... at least for a while, the world will be better off. )
1313148715712933900 2020-10-06 00:07:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher He must be feeling better. The medication might rev him up a bit, but he’s not driving!

1313000652121935872 2020-10-05 14:18:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Ronald Reagan met a young Donald Trump in 1987, at this historic meeting.  https://t.co/0ms0jeGAWU
1312994818369310720 2020-10-05 13:55:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Honestly, I just don’t get it? Yesterday afternoon a lot of high profile Dems were wishing President Trump a speedy recovery. He did just that &amp; today now they are calling him a fkn murderer!
1312993627098890242 2020-10-05 13:50:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @southernmissfo1 I just tweeted a YT video. Search 1988 Joe Biden Plagiarism.

1312987843237617665 2020-10-05 13:27:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Biegenzahn @BDevlin1 👍
1312986942502432769 2020-10-05 13:24:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Songbabe109 Hahaha! One acid trip too many... However he, Joe Biden &amp; Nancy Pelosi would understand each other  just fine. That was great!
1312985552757555200 2020-10-05 13:18:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If (IF?) there is another so called debate, I would love for @realDonaldTrump to directly ask Joe Biden, Just how did you get thrown out of the 1988 Presidential Election? (...for those unaware, he was caught lying &amp; plagiarizing!) ..oddly enough, nothing has changed in 32 years.
1312983467664187392 2020-10-05 13:10:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BDevlin1 Just did it! ( how do I get back the 3 1/2 weeks of my life wasted not knowing this?)
1312982281653415942 2020-10-05 13:05:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @kathismoak I know. Sickening.

1312973079308505088 2020-10-05 12:29:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I follow him. As you well know, people just don’t show up in your feed...it’s part of the AI suppressing algorithm.
1312971256224866306 2020-10-05 12:21:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Our Mil Intel team has been a little quiet, particularly with what I would call a “scare event”. I guess now with 29 days to go, what would you call this...last  quarter or even 2 min warning? Not much room for error in high stakes game.

1312962072544567298 2020-10-05 11:45:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m reading that Joe Biden is ill. The thing is I can’t confirm that, but the point is, if he is {they} will cover it up. President Trump didn’t cover up his Covid diagnosis. Immediate transparency &amp; straight into good medical care. All we are seeing is Jill Biden &amp; Joe sneezing.
1312960733496262656 2020-10-05 11:40:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> All the Blue Checks freaking out today about President Trump having a masked SUV ride with the blessing of highly trained Doctors, and yet not a one of them condemned the thousands of rioters out in the streets. The hypocrisy spreads thick with the Left.
1312952497326051329 2020-10-05 11:07:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 Senator Biden on his way to work.
1312941943953870848 2020-10-05 10:25:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Cool. ( ...really cool!)
1312940470129946624 2020-10-05 10:19:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If you wear a mask you are now a killer. Liberal Illogical Logic.
1312932214187782145 2020-10-05 09:46:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PeachMint17 ...to nowhere.
1312931459728961537 2020-10-05 09:43:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> New narrative creeping in. Joe Bribe ‘em Biden is purposefully keeping crowds low so according to science he doesn’t affect them with Covid. If you believe this I have some prime land in the desert to sell.
1312917820221448192 2020-10-05 08:49:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I just have been noticing that all over the board. Bear in mind had that been Joe Biden leaving today in the same situation, would have been a mass Media Collective Cheering. Therefore they are all full of sh!t.
1312916789328662528 2020-10-05 08:45:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Bruno062418 I have a real good hunch as to who makes her payroll. Secondly, had that been Biden leaving the hospital she would be tweeting tears of joy.
1312912384076341248 2020-10-05 08:27:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @StaubGreg That’s a favorite word. Had Joe Biden, left the hospital today, the Left would cheer.
1312910995841376256 2020-10-05 08:22:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He’s wearing a mask, Karen.
1312908344772841472 2020-10-05 08:11:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Meanwhile occurring in a parallel Universe today. Joe Biden left the hospital this afternoon, recovering from Covid, to wave to the crowd from inside his SUV. The Media: This is so exciting. This is incredible. He is well. He lives. We love you. -(I’m grateful, Trumps Universe!)
1312904243100045313 2020-10-05 07:55:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This has been such a wonderful uplifting day for all Patriots. Our President is getting super healthy. So many diverse groups are coming over to our side now. I’m just waiting now for the last group to get onboard the Ark. #NeverTrumpers for Trump! 🇺🇸

1312889010470092800 2020-10-05 06:55:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump won the Election today.

At least he won’t get Covid today! 😅 I could be wrong, but I think those regular SS Suburbans have bullet proof glass, but are nowhere The Beast level...so yeah, there is a security risk. I can’t argue that.
1312879480478654464 2020-10-05 06:17:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SavageDystrophy @raymondgolembi1 Of course! 👍 One last thing to consider. He is not a politician. He doesn’t put his finger in the air to test the wind.

1312877007319916545 2020-10-05 06:07:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChiMom19638497 Yes. Not everything is a conspiracy.

1312618241957584896 2020-10-04 12:59:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> A fully recovered Donald Trump could do Holographic rallies &amp; thousands &amp; thousands would attend across the Country.

1312575679880335360 2020-10-04 10:10:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @sharlycan @1791Jtf17 @anon_fa_mous When you see it for yourself, with your own eyes, that is liberating, as no one has had to force you. Congratulations, I mean it. 🤠
1312574355189055490 2020-10-04 10:04:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher He was in the debate prep room.
1312564567982006272 2020-10-04 09:25:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom Remember Blasey-Ford &amp; her preposterous lies about Justice Kavanaugh. She’s 15 at a party with no witnesses, no time, date or location &amp; the Mafia MSM lapped up this hogwash. They tried to destroy an innocent man.
1312562937949638657 2020-10-04 09:19:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LawNuse I watched “24” Jack Bauer. I did love the show. 🤠
1312561001238126592 2020-10-04 09:11:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m sure this is just all a coincidence! (...debate Prep room. Aerosol in a vent? Like tiny little arrows released from a quiver full of Covid.)
1312558159894986752 2020-10-04 09:00:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Shocked!
1312534726414987265 2020-10-04 07:27:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump should give Joe Biden a call. Just check up on him &amp; see how he is doing?
1312532739300622336 2020-10-04 07:19:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I wanted to share a Covid-19 joke with you all, but decided against it, as 98.6% of you won’t get it.
1312531619736027136 2020-10-04 07:14:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HigherKingdom After 5 years you have to get a couple of good ones in! 😅
1312531040515158017 2020-10-04 07:12:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I just saw our dear President alive &amp; doing quite well. It’s now very apparent that the MSM are the ones that are near death.
1312529851190976512 2020-10-04 07:07:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Science says you are going to lose the Election. I believe in that.
1312529620495818752 2020-10-04 07:07:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1FreeInhabitant @realDonaldTrump @Scavino45 Nice to see him! ( really NICE to see him.) 🇺🇸
1312521758994440194 2020-10-04 06:35:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The backfiring of this news cycle will be Epic.
1312521407113297920 2020-10-04 06:34:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Left prefer comforting lies.  https://t.co/3ylzRmFhp4
1312517463997771777 2020-10-04 06:18:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @8Notables Well said. God is in the word “Good”
1312516926329909248 2020-10-04 06:16:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @factn0tfeeling I’m impressed! 👍 It really is (IMO), breaking out of a hypnotic spell. From before your birth, kindergarten to college. The propaganda placed on you. Write a book on it &amp; self publish your story.
1312502533760327682 2020-10-04 05:19:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @factn0tfeeling Congratulations on waking up &amp; snapping out of it. That is really quite a feat!
1312499628386914304 2020-10-04 05:07:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Bruno062418 @GenFlynn Like your decodes, but mostly like Corgis! 🤠
1312494516750827526 2020-10-04 04:47:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ceajs1 True. I just like the camel’s style. The way he takes care of business.
1312494022359826432 2020-10-04 04:45:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He is not a well man. He gets a kick out of doing this in public.
1312491390215942144 2020-10-04 04:35:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Why are you still even here?
1312490962971619328 2020-10-04 04:33:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Songbabe109 Lol!
1312490896705822720 2020-10-04 04:33:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow She shouldn’t be worried about it, technically, but as others have said, she is worried about that giant Q tip being tainted.
1312489103905058816 2020-10-04 04:26:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Has anyone else been feeling like the Camel? Had to stop myself from responding to the vile Left all day yesterday. Who am I kidding, feel like this all the time now.   https://t.co/6ACIZl1cTT
1312452617717465088 2020-10-04 02:01:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SiriusBShaman “Q”
1312451140588429314 2020-10-04 01:55:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Call out the instigators Because there's something in the air We've got to get together sooner or later...
1312298282110971907 2020-10-03 15:47:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AwakenedOutlaw @CherylHswood I do that too, not for everyone but the chosen few. I forgive but don’t forget. Sometimes I would like to place a bet with these folks, but being Democrats they wouldn’t honor the bet.
1312290604655628288 2020-10-03 15:17:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Biegenzahn All except me &amp; thee!  😅
1312289316882665473 2020-10-03 15:12:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Mary_Jai1 @stormypatriot21 She did. Different role. ( in name) Probably similar. She has been one of Trump’s personal trusted employees for many years. My guess it’s a loyalty/trust/honesty thing, which in these times is the rarest of gems.
1312288240993357824 2020-10-03 15:07:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr Thanks. I’ll look into it.
1312285905395228673 2020-10-03 14:58:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Been trying to stay away from direct attacks, I failed.
1312285501139738625 2020-10-03 14:56:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Kurt_SDMF 🎯
1312285251624869889 2020-10-03 14:55:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I’m hitting the hay soon. Going to program that one in. In a way, it’s stating the obvious, but journalists don’t do that anymore, they are all just opinion columnists/communists.
1312284708206571520 2020-10-03 14:53:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Kurt_SDMF How would it be if some of them thought of coming up with some ideas? Infrastructure, new cities, economic zones etc? Nah, Communism is easier...just bleed the proletariat dry. Bernie &amp; Nancy are fine examples.
1312282820656603136 2020-10-03 14:46:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Biegenzahn One day. My family moved accts there, but rarely use it. We must have the Stockholm Syndrome by staying here and being abused.
1312281993942499328 2020-10-03 14:43:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr What’s your natural for BP? Please. (...blood pressure?)
1312280768710807553 2020-10-03 14:38:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr I’m embarrassed to admit, but have been feeling fragile today. Hope no one sees this. 🤠
1312280000800849921 2020-10-03 14:35:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon He did didn’t he? There is an excellent Gif floating around here today...captured his expression perfectly.
1312279594376912897 2020-10-03 14:33:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon That helps sure. How do you target this so precisely?
1312279020818448387 2020-10-03 14:31:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> ...and we wonder after 4 years of phony hoaxes, fake Impeachment, planned riots, why we don’t trust the Democrats. Nothing is beyond these criminals.
1312278316255076353 2020-10-03 14:28:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr I know. We’re good. My minds been in a bit of hyperdrive. What’s that old expression: Something rotten in the State of Denmark? Something rotten here.
1312277739903217665 2020-10-03 14:26:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Just amazing. The last 10 days?, yet these people have been pretty darn careful last 6 months. Maybe I watched too many episodes of “24”
1312277143552839680 2020-10-03 14:23:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Biegenzahn The Overlords threw him off of here. This was a repost from Parler, which I’m not on. I think it’s a clunky platform, might get better. I like being here behind enemy lines. Danger is my middle name! 😅
1312276347113201664 2020-10-03 14:20:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @4Wqhero The HCQ is cost effective, so the Big Pharma hate it. In Africa virtually no Covid, all are on Anti Malaria meds...quinine. Go figure?
1312275726813413377 2020-10-03 14:18:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChuckSteeleSr I said it’s another viewpoint. When you make a fine Whiskey, all the ingredients are “distilled”. That’s what we are doing.
1312273214618300416 2020-10-03 14:08:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JulieHeading1 We never were Conspiracy Theorists, only Factual Realists.
1312272726745210882 2020-10-03 14:06:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Patriot_Talk_76 @JoeKoyne Tiny poisonous arrows. Nano sized. Effective delivery mechanism. These lying bastards like to deceive us right in front of our eyes. Evil gets a kick out of that.
1312271509008781313 2020-10-03 14:01:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @narelleford @dallasmom53 @cosmicStar55 You’re talking about the riots? Please run along. This is the adult section.
1312271029222273024 2020-10-03 13:59:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Now here is another viewpoint from Joe M. If all of the people who have been suddenly infected get quite well this next two weeks, then that would bode well. Trying to keep an open mind, but since I have zero trust in the Mafia Democrats it’s difficult.  https://t.co/y0dg1r1jPP
1312268456901832704 2020-10-03 13:49:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ssl57 No you’re not. We are only dealing in known facts.

1312266311527923713 2020-10-03 13:40:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @editor_wp Hate to use the words, but Contact Tracing shouldn’t be difficult. I’m going to have to plug this into the sub conscious &amp; sleep on it ( if possible LOL!)...it’s bugging me.
1312265088494043138 2020-10-03 13:35:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MelvinChapman @DanSwanson1965 Shades of LV Massacre...we never found out what really happened?

1312262112832442371 2020-10-03 13:24:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @editor_wp Birds of a Feather.
1312258646932299778 2020-10-03 13:10:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @cbosley15 I saw you rioting. You weren’t following protocol.
1312258345588330497 2020-10-03 13:09:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @editor_wp They have that.
1312257744947216385 2020-10-03 13:06:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @loudclown @FKTVis Assassination Attempt with a biological weapon. Now who would have a motive! Democrats &amp; China. They sleep together.
1312257344483389440 2020-10-03 13:05:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Been pondering that this past 30-45 minutes. What the hell? Something is up. Can’t place my finger on it, but we know of at least two events. The Debate &amp; ACB Rose Garden. Assassination Attempt with a biological weapon? Been done before.
1312254036486180864 2020-10-03 12:51:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @mfindingtruth @carolynn_june @KristopherSnake Cool!

1312236964444164096 2020-10-03 11:44:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @mariama69292644 Check out the President’s tweet just now or see my last one!

1312227615936139265 2020-10-03 11:06:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is precious. James can frame this one. It’s a keeper!
1312226331216629760 2020-10-03 11:01:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Moon &amp; Mars are dancing beautifully together tonight. Can’t get a good pic with cellphone, but if you look up into the sky, at the wonder that which is before you, it’s there.
1312222778997657600 2020-10-03 10:47:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Yes. I’m of the opinion that this was not planned ( getting the flu/ covid). Based on that thinking today then is wait &amp; see. Look at WW2 and the best laid plans put on hold due to inclement weather. Definitely twists &amp; turns. Kew team posts many times when + is traveling/rally.
1312212798819069953 2020-10-03 10:08:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> In the very near term future President Trump will even be thanking his haters re his Covid &amp; subsequent recovery. Why? Because it only makes SOB’s like him stronger! 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇸  https://t.co/5LWJfMTYFK

1312192458772508672 2020-10-03 08:47:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Someone has to say it. President Trump will most likely sneak out at night undercover &amp; return in the morning.
1312182489314594816 2020-10-03 08:07:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @729Baker He’s had it in for Trump forever.
1312180320653864960 2020-10-03 07:59:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Pre Debate. This man spotted on stage wiping down President Trump’s microphone. Can you identify him?  https://t.co/0nn5ABJ78m
1312170717652217856 2020-10-03 07:20:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Midnigh77653086 Like Melania’s trusted phone buddy? 😀
1312165949974355968 2020-10-03 07:01:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Any surveillance video of who set up the microphone &amp; podium at the Debate? It’s not that I don’t trust anyone, I just don’t trust anyone.
1312144369223299073 2020-10-03 05:36:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PleinAirs There is nothing else as of now.

1311938098872283137 2020-10-02 15:56:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @daltonposse @POTUS Thanks. This is probably standard procedure. No different to having two AF1’s available at any time.

1311907799064961024 2020-10-02 13:56:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden @JoeBiden Get tested now. #TestBiden
1311907563437350912 2020-10-02 13:55:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Yes. Good thinking. start a hash tag. #TestBiden
1311907192954519553 2020-10-02 13:53:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @beardly01 I've been saying for years: 33,000 Cameras in Vegas (Casino Capital) &amp; not even 33 seconds of Video? I had very close people staying on the Strip that night.( None injured 🙏)...but we know of others. No one could talk about it for the longest time. We will never know.
1311905916376080384 2020-10-02 13:48:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AdamWheeldon4 Good tip. I did that about 5 years ago. That's how I started. I was a professional twit hit man. It's all I did. After a while they become energy Vampires. What I do now flows nicely for me.
1311903863570534400 2020-10-02 13:40:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Left are bringing out their finest already. Don't engage these sub-humans. They are not worthy. If Joe Biden were ill, we all would hope he would recover &amp; lose the race naturally. Yes there's a difference between us. I wish all the Left well.

1311899777299177472 2020-10-02 13:24:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Expect incoming Tweets from @POTUS whilst under quarantine. It's a sure bet.

1311887944983085057 2020-10-02 12:37:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The biggest mistake Democrats can make now is to think that President Trump is down for the count. Risk that thinking at your own peril.
1311887445567270912 2020-10-02 12:35:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe can't even buy enthusiasm. How sad is that? Pathetic man running a pathetic Campaign from an equally as weak political party rooted in lies, hate &amp; socialism.

If you haven’t followed it from day 1 or 2 can be a little mind boggling TBH. Sadly a lot of the bigger accounts that were good at explaining all this have been mu......d by jack.

1311855905898524672 2020-10-02 10:29:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Proved your point John. Sometimes in life though, are the prize &amp; price equal?

Side note: he threw Jeffrey Epstein out of the same club for hitting on underage girls.

Trump telling Biden “Don’t ever tell me you’re smart again!”, was freaking EPIC, knowing Biden finished bottom (near?) &amp; then got tossed out of the 1988 Pres. Race for lying &amp; plagiarism. He’s a big mouth loser.

1311547849838977024 2020-10-01 14:05:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trailrunner12 We saw how the Dems tried to throw Barr off thought with that fiasco hearing. It didn’t work, Barr didn’t take the bait as he is naturally a clear thinker. Biden, has to struggle to keep his thoughts straight, earpiece or not. Trump was successful therefore in throwing Joe off.
1311547056910004225 2020-10-01 14:02:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trailrunner12 That line of thinking that you are alluding to would also apply if Biden did not have an earpiece. All of Biden’s rehearsals are based on linear thought A&gt;B&gt;C. Trumps interruptions cause him to go A&gt;C.

What Trump did last night was a stealth attack in broad light in front of millions &amp; very few saw it. In plain sight. It was masterful.

1311524067275534336 2020-10-01 12:31:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HandsomeSean1 Biden sold out the Green Deal, threw BLM under the bus. Had no answer at all re lack of Law Enforcement &amp; committed massive perjury on Live TV, denying he &amp; his sons crooked deals. Trump then calmy said, We have it all. So good!
1311523226514673664 2020-10-01 12:27:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HandsomeSean1 So they say. Trump said he heard tonight that Biden doesn’t want to do anymore. No wonder. Trump basically rolled a grenade over to Biden &amp; he wasn’t aware he had exploded.
1311521676228661249 2020-10-01 12:21:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HandsomeSean1 There were some super smart people here in our little corner that fully decoded it. Once I put the pieces together, it was like Trump you stable fn genius. ( Carlos O. was great on that.) I’m still thinking about it!

Not angry but very very focused on the time being now. Speech was a little shorter than usual, but it was very cold in Duluth.

His speaking style more up tempo, faster delivery. Not anger, but some impatience. Probably still pissed at the double teaming last night &amp; was brutally cold in Duluth. Message Delivered. Message Received.

Our family did until we saw the Bolshevik Revolution take over the Democrat Party. I think now Trump has broken the Uniparty.

1311343190297862145 2020-10-01 00:32:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeplorableMikeG Yes! Moment I saw this one , knew it was going to backfire.

1311342173099405313 2020-10-01 00:28:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow In Biden's mind he won, because he STOOD UP to Trump. If you analyse The Debate, Biden had to give up so much in order to do so. (Green Deal, Law &amp; Order, Defund the Police?) Trump was Rope-a-Doping him.
1311341519576600578 2020-10-01 00:25:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ZakiyahBatYah @JoeBiden Stay on Twitter. You need us!😅 You can only lead the horse to water... (If Trump was to blame for economy, why did nearly every Country in the World shut down over Covid fears?)
1311333882139082752 2020-09-30 23:55:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ZakiyahBatYah @JoeBiden Trump interrupted Joe on purpose, like a boxer in the ring. This was to throw Joes train of thought off. It was ugly to watch, but it worked. Joe was jumping from one statement to the next. It’s a pressure test. Joe started to get angry. It worked.
1311332541001916417 2020-09-30 23:50:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Has Joe called today’s Lid yet?

1311331004091490306 2020-09-30 23:44:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dems now strategizing how to prevent @JoeBiden doing any more debates. The lies will include Trump doesn’t play by the rules, he’s a bully blah, blah, blah.

1311202132280795136 2020-09-30 15:12:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lightanchor1 Watch it, even without the volume. Trump barely moves his head or shoulders. This is one calm dude at work. He is surgically dissecting Biden here.
1311201283047485440 2020-09-30 15:08:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> No need to pick up the phone. He’s a placeholder. Others in the Dem Party {They} are calling the shots by organizing &amp; orchestrating the riots. Monies collected are funneled back into DNC coffers. It’s a well documented Criminal Organization. RICO should apply.
1311199655535849473 2020-09-30 15:02:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 5/.Lastly Joe did appear lucid enough, therefore he can stand trial. Trump put Joe Biden tonight just where he wanted to. That includes Chris Wallace. He was just an annoying sand fly. End.
1311198582792364033 2020-09-30 14:57:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 4/. I forgot, Trump also forced Biden to admit that he had no backing “ Not One” from any Police Agency. Embarrassing. Biden looked weak on Law &amp; Order tonight. But sure, he stood up to Trump telling him to “shut up”. It’s going to be a very costly lesson for Joe Biden..
1311197730887200769 2020-09-30 14:54:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 3/. In front of us he stood up to Trump by declaring no wrongdoing re Burisma/Russia &amp; China involving Hunter. Trump thought otherwise by concluding that he “had it all” on Biden. ( sounding like Q?) Biden looked flummoxed...
1311196823869034496 2020-09-30 14:50:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 2/ .the tough guy. Just like he told Burisma, you’re not getting the Billion $ on video. Look at however, just what he had to give up, in order to be “tough” in front of Trump. To AOC’s progressives he sold out the New Green Deal. To BLM he sold them out on defunding Police...
1311195902866931714 2020-09-30 14:47:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If this was a Chapter from the Art of War, Trump tonight let Biden think he had won the debate. Biden has prior to explained his disdain for Guys like Trump. In Biden’s mind tonight he stood up to Trump. He sneered &amp; jeered at him. Showed little to no respect. Biden being the ...

1311187998059315200 2020-09-30 14:15:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Yes. It was scrappy &amp; ugly, but Trump scored the points he NEEDED to. Biden nearly lost his temper several times, very close. Biden was disrespectful, but I was surprised the drugs they had pumped into him kept him in the match just long enough.

1311178592772997120 2020-09-30 13:38:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SweeneyMomma It was scrappy but Trump scored more hidden points than meets the eye. Biden doesn’t support New Green Deal. No Police support him. He claims zero wrongdoing on Burisma, China...I believe Trump has “actual” evidence. He was rude, his temper flared. Cognitively the drugs worked.

1311156859105996800 2020-09-30 12:12:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Since Biden admitted tonight on Live TV, that he is the Democrat Party now, I just want to introduce him to a couple of lovely kids he got with the package deal. Joe meet Antifa &amp; BLM. You’re just gonna love them.

1311126530731331584 2020-09-30 10:11:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Chris Wallace is still a prick.
1311125981290061824 2020-09-30 10:09:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Anything to do with Law &amp; Order, Biden can’t respond. Trump asked Biden who in Law supports him? Trump said, go ahead we have time. Biden said we have no time! 😅
1311124511161380864 2020-09-30 10:03:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Jcashfan33 I don’t know what they are TBH, but the way he is handling this. The bias is overwhelming.
1311123670090182657 2020-09-30 10:00:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We know! Thank you handlers 👍
1311123475772235777 2020-09-30 09:59:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump , Law &amp; Order...(shining example.) Joe simply has no response
1311122077445840897 2020-09-30 09:53:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Chris Wallace is a prick.
1311118351314296833 2020-09-30 09:39:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Linz775 Yes.

1311114052001701889 2020-09-30 09:22:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe: Shut up man! (...not good!)
1311113540384690176 2020-09-30 09:20:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CarrieKikki It’s horrible!
1311113451725488128 2020-09-30 09:19:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Where’s Hannity...he can jump in too?
1311113188037914624 2020-09-30 09:18:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump is getting under Joe’s skin.
1311113045955944448 2020-09-30 09:18:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe: I beat Bernie Sanders Trump:Not by much! 😅
1311112144197267456 2020-09-30 09:14:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DigiDiva2020 Me too...off the rails!

1311094373279436805 2020-09-30 08:03:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @meme_maga Desperate I would say.
1311094158065451008 2020-09-30 08:03:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EdwardCIB You’re right!
1311093650814771200 2020-09-30 08:00:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LawNuse @atomicladybug 👍🇺🇸❤️
1311089975685869570 2020-09-30 07:46:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ZakiyahBatYah There’s no way. Self deprecating humor can often be pretty good. Trump did it great on SNL. This one fell flat IMO. I can’t criticize the handlers. Not much left in the quiver.
1311088531960336384 2020-09-30 07:40:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DigiDiva2020 Right Side Broadcasting. Bunch of good guys. ( &amp; gals) Can I say gals? What the heck.
1311087523116974081 2020-09-30 07:36:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Nice try. This didn’t work for Bloomberg either. Still, you are desperate, it’s worth a shot.
1311086746998681600 2020-09-30 07:33:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lex31555 @PiamentaShimon Those Eyes!
1311086169803780097 2020-09-30 07:31:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Be really cool if Q nominated Trump for another Nobel Peace Prize. Stir the pot a little!
1311085060833959936 2020-09-30 07:26:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Your risk reward ratio is covered. They are still negotiating in the background, I’m reading.
1311084483907473408 2020-09-30 07:24:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SurferPatriot IKR. 😅 In fairness to me I didn’t go into all the details did I?
1311084108513071104 2020-09-30 07:23:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @meme_maga Totally. Everyone is different, but after 3 pm, I’ll take the nap over the coffee. Sometimes though coffee is all you can do.
1311082898120818689 2020-09-30 07:18:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @meme_maga 🙋‍♂️ Thought I was the only one!
1311080455127482368 2020-09-30 07:08:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> * I apologize for the bathroom humor. I thought I was better than this, but apparently I’m not! 😅
1311078494906925056 2020-09-30 07:00:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lex31555 Thank God, Trump doesn’t have shake his hand. First time I’m agreeing with Social Distancing!
1311078045550129153 2020-09-30 06:58:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HermesVeritas Pre-paid. Lot of folks do this.
1311075977334681602 2020-09-30 06:50:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ruseriousrtnw 9 pm EST.
1311075554032934913 2020-09-30 06:49:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m setting the timer alarm on my phone at the 30 minute mark, so I can see Biden squirm uncomfortably in his suit as he takes his first dump.
1311058397458956290 2020-09-30 05:40:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How’d the drug test work out?
1311044691941498882 2020-09-30 04:46:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Gee! All those pesky conspiracy stories that that Mil Intel guy has been dropping on the chans, appear to be coming in as factual now. Those proofs can be a real son of a bitch.
1311043906990088192 2020-09-30 04:43:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BardsFM If just one Democrat Voter per 100 people see that Joe Biden isn’t quite right in the head &amp; not fit to serve, then it’s all worthwhile. It’s not for those that KNOW. Entertainment is okay for me. 🍿
1311042999699210240 2020-09-30 04:39:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DarleneIronCity Good point!

1310983557897048064 2020-09-30 00:43:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump is feeling comfy today. Kek.
1310982469022220289 2020-09-30 00:39:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador I haven’t thought of it from that angle. Panic in Biden Camp. Trump though is playing with the strong hand in this instance.
1310981501111218176 2020-09-30 00:35:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 9-29-2020 Let the unraveling of the Democrat Party begin. The jig is up.  https://t.co/oBuE27Q092
1310978064990396417 2020-09-30 00:21:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher Same. Understand though the Democrats had arguably 100 million to choose from as a Candidate. “Common sense” says you don’t put someone with Dementia in as your candidate. Families unfortunately see this every day with loved ones. It’s a dreadful mind robbing disorder.
1310977114879922178 2020-09-30 00:17:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BS_Detector2020 @JoeBiden I live way out. Nothing. Check out War Room Pandemic. Biden Team making last minute desperate changes to Debate rules. Trump has been right all along.
1310976675547553792 2020-09-30 00:16:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Looking better by the hour.
1310976502977101824 2020-09-30 00:15:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Democrats &amp; .@JoeBiden Team at Defcon Level2. Media also.  https://t.co/8AwOLcP79K
1310968532872568832 2020-09-29 23:43:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> MSM &amp; DNC very nervous about @JoeBiden. They simply can't keep the facade up any longer.
1310965826120372225 2020-09-29 23:33:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Just STOP! Stop it now. Quit. Get off of the stage.
1310964055054495745 2020-09-29 23:26:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> .@JoeBiden is not FIT to be President. It's over!
1310856718356627456 2020-09-29 16:19:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 94% of polled @CNN viewers say Joe Biden won the Debate tomorrow night. #FakeNewsPracticing to be #FakeNews

1310849772345913345 2020-09-29 15:51:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ORGANlCROBOT @realDonaldTrump Chris Wallace to Joe Biden: “ Favorite ice cream?” ...that’ll be the tough question of the night.
1310848774198026240 2020-09-29 15:47:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ORGANlCROBOT @realDonaldTrump That’s his trained Safety Answer, to avoid going ANY further. Watch for it.
1310845449754959872 2020-09-29 15:34:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Well Schatz, Hunter &amp; Joe took 1.5 Billion, so there’s that.
1310844987576209409 2020-09-29 15:32:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Disagree. No taxes now. My money. My choice. They print it. We believe in it. It’s always been that way, but the dirty secret was to invent taxes to perpetuate it.
1310843621902413824 2020-09-29 15:27:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If ( IF) Joe Biden does show up tomorrow night all drugged up &amp; ready to go, he is still like a Box of Chocolates. We don’t know which Joe we are going to get. Angry Projecting Joe or feeble forgetful Joe? Which one @joebiden ? 🍿🍿🍿
1310842692641812481 2020-09-29 15:23:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m really enjoying my own account just before the Election. Trump the Master, has taught me to speak what’s on my mind. Thank you Donald! Greatest President in a 1,000 years.
1310841889046708226 2020-09-29 15:20:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @editor_wp There is only ONE Walsh. Eagles Joe Walsh. This one is an impostor.
1310841589795758082 2020-09-29 15:19:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This tax thing was served up as a Nothing Burger in 2016. When the Dems repack a pile of crap, it’s still a pile of crap.
1310840756265865217 2020-09-29 15:16:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Don’t flatter yourself.
1310838495787675648 2020-09-29 15:07:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Both these events cannot occur at the same time. One has to give.  https://t.co/reHRfLVobs
1310822398430568448 2020-09-29 14:03:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Hey Joe @JoeBiden, I heard today that you refused to take the drug test that President Trump asked of you. Maybe Hunter could take the test for you? ...................Oh, never mind!
1310820739927269381 2020-09-29 13:56:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Jeremyview Happy Ending. 😅

1310782430505177088 2020-09-29 11:24:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This mail in ballot scheme is looking weaker by the hour. Yet Big Brother Twat insists still to put little warning labels to tell us how good it is. Who is influencing who here?  The futility of puerile thinking. It doesn’t do their bodies good.
1310781030471663617 2020-09-29 11:18:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dwmzmm The real good news is, the Boss knows about it. We don’t have to send out 33,000 tweets to bring it to his attention. Wonder if the DOJ  will get the memo?
1310780191824699392 2020-09-29 11:15:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @P51leahy But they’re actors, they are so cool.

1310760785832894465 2020-09-29 09:58:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @shadow_voter Back in the day, way back the E ticket was used for the Best rides at  Disneyland, Space Mountain! Thunder Mountain etc. Seeing that Aurora from the Space Station is an Ultimate Ride then. The most expensive Ticket!
1310760024109543424 2020-09-29 09:55:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JonMutoza Winner. Winner. I know, we used to have Annual passes!

1310703682707623936 2020-09-29 06:11:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I guess you are on the ticket. Chief Handler &amp; Consummate Liar in the Cover Up.
1310703139411034115 2020-09-29 06:09:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @westieTX @JoeBiden @DNC Power. Lust for Power. Power for Power’s sake. Control over you. Those at the top of the Communist Pyramid live very well at your expense.
1310700699093667841 2020-09-29 05:59:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I will tell you what the real LID on the .@JoeBiden Campaign is. The LID is the giant cover up of his onset Dementia. His decline has been rapid &amp; the @DNC are in a state of desperate PANIC.
1310656559408508929 2020-09-29 03:04:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You’re disqualified for not taking the drug test! Your hands will never touch the Nuclear buttons. Now FO.
1310652320472944640 2020-09-29 02:47:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ChadWebb2020 The ultimate test, is to put money on it, in a large enough amount that the result could put a dent in your finances. Even for me now it’s 50/50, therefore not worth the bet.
1310651743894528000 2020-09-29 02:45:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LassieTrump I’m not a big believer in them. Not a popular opinion around here but, 🤷‍♂️
1310651040094584832 2020-09-29 02:42:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Here is the final result. Obviously not scientific, but is it any worse than a CNN poll showing Biden 77% chance of winning? Tomorrow night we find out.
1310636465345499137 2020-09-29 01:44:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You wrote the fkn laws, as you tweet from your new lakeside home.
1310633510227460097 2020-09-29 01:32:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How would the Left react if Donald Trump had refused a drug test today at Joe Biden’s request?
1310632251810488320 2020-09-29 01:27:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 💥 💥 💥 1   2   3 !

1310622772943441922 2020-09-29 00:49:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Bubblebathgirl Need to shut themselves down for Election interference &amp; Voter suppression.
1310621983139196929 2020-09-29 00:46:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LindaLou5265 @JoeBiden He wants to run for the highest office in this Country? This should disqualify him today!

1310618778288271365 2020-09-29 00:34:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is juiced. Prove me wrong @JoeBiden

1310541099690201088 2020-09-28 19:25:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LewisMCowan1 That plus. Criminal act -treason to knowingly let a senile person have access to nuclear codes?
1310539991215292416 2020-09-28 19:20:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dr. Jill Biden is complicit.
1310538542850867201 2020-09-28 19:15:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ExciterAural @cjtruth Of course.
1310537860609527808 2020-09-28 19:12:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Democrat Party will go down in history as one of the world’s most corrupt criminal organizations. Nothing to be proud of. It’s a stain.
1310532619533086720 2020-09-28 18:51:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The way to Make America truly Great Again is to Vote every Son of a Bitch lying dog faced pony soldier stupid bastard Democrat out of office. It’s my fervent wish that we obtain a super majority. #Trump2020

1310367171290173441 2020-09-28 07:54:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ExciterAural Genius!
1310366775083556866 2020-09-28 07:52:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Direct quote from  Goebbels Joe Biden: ------------------ Trump is like “Goebbels,” said Biden.  “You say the lie long enough, keep repeating it, repeating it, repeating it, it becomes common knowledge…I think people see very clearly the difference between me and Donald Trump.”
1310347901839659009 2020-09-28 06:37:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bdwoot Probably then the same process Hunter Biden did to borrow 1.5 billion?
1310347399286587392 2020-09-28 06:35:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Why would you prep anyways to debate a birdbrain like Joe?

1310333669806977024 2020-09-28 05:41:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @noles2552 Thanks Tony! Love you man.
1310332759823405056 2020-09-28 05:37:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DudeKing12 I'd have to lock muh self in a basement &amp; practice it too!😅
1310332153696153600 2020-09-28 05:35:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Meth heads won't get this: A tax loss carryforward (or carryover) is a provision that allows a taxpayer to carry over a tax loss to future years to offset a profit. The tax loss carryforward can be claimed by an individual or a business in order to reduce any future tax payments.
1310330225092255744 2020-09-28 05:27:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Sparty80GoGreen Joe can implode quite nicely on his own. Trump at most will have to trigger a few buttons.
1310329905591119872 2020-09-28 05:26:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> {They} want to play that game? Okay. Release Returns ofDiane Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Joe &amp; Hunter Biden. F around &amp; find out.
1310327659306520576 2020-09-28 05:17:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Sparty80GoGreen Have Joe recite the Pledge of Allegiance...

1310313305307664384 2020-09-28 04:20:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PleinAirs Terrifying when they are in on it. What the hell have they promised her?
1310305735847206917 2020-09-28 03:50:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Can Steroids affect you? I’m just curious.
1310303047835246593 2020-09-28 03:39:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I never cared until...👇
1310302077751451649 2020-09-28 03:35:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @paul_furber I’m mostly likely to be thrown out of my cult as I haven’t been attending meetings. Oh well.
1310299409813397505 2020-09-28 03:24:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @eightoridle @17ThankQ Trump knows that, but he raises the question by sowing the seeds.
1310298700124549120 2020-09-28 03:22:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @8Notables Been a real opener for me. I didn't realize The Swamp is THE ABYSS.

1310280133433937920 2020-09-28 02:08:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Spare me bad hair plug man. What was so “Affordable” about it? It’s been a freaking nightmare &amp; disaster, you dumb bastards.
1310277570391232512 2020-09-28 01:58:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Caught lying in 1988. Had to quit the race. It’s now 2020, there you go Joe @joebiden , lying again.
1310277069062848512 2020-09-28 01:56:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1FreeInhabitant The concept is cool, I just feel it doesn’t resonate with me on a daily basis.
1310276715441127424 2020-09-28 01:54:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> .@joebiden literally got thrown out of the 1988 Presidential Campaign for being a liar. Nothing has changed. None of the MSM have dared to challenge him on this &amp; all we have got is #FartingCrickets
1310274995218575361 2020-09-28 01:47:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Take the drug test @joebiden , C’Mon Man! If not that how about a lie detector test?...let us know about all those colleges you attended &amp; grades you got. Oh, wait you got thrown out of the 1988 Presidential race for being a fn liar!
1310267940831244288 2020-09-28 01:19:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MpathEe I believe it’s real. Some say an act.
1310266753033752576 2020-09-28 01:15:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EverydaySchmoes Possible?

1310264788497260544 2020-09-28 01:07:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Man who vote for demented sleepy Joe, have rock in head.
1310245348938407936 2020-09-27 23:50:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeplorableGoldn @Breaking911 Biden has a dreadful temper.
1310127977531727883 2020-09-27 16:03:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @KittygirlTara Trump has been alluding to this in his rallies by also saying that Biden is too weak &amp; feeble to engage World Leaders...Putin, Xi &amp; kim jong-un etc.
1310123404729544705 2020-09-27 15:45:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How can Joe Biden appear on the World Stage if he can’t even appear on his backyard patio? #Trump2020
1310122636207300608 2020-09-27 15:42:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 I never thought they had ANY candidate that could beat Trump. Also thought their whole message of “Let’s just Hate Trump” was poor. Lastly the whole Burning, looting, Rioting &amp; murder, as Trump would say: “ That’s a real beauty!” Weak pathetic Party really.
1310120156547354626 2020-09-27 15:32:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeplorableGoldn @Breaking911 Poorly I would think. I’m thinking now that Trump won’t come on so strong, but more so with pushes &amp; prods to let the world see ( &amp; of course the prospective voters), that Joe really has lost his mind &amp; is not qualified to be President.

It can’t exist without lies to fuel it. It’s all a giant lie created by the Masters of Illusion. I can go deeper, but will leave it at that.
1310068259480166407 2020-09-27 12:06:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> My favorite feature of these Rallies are the Bread Crumbs like this. Since the fake MSM never report anything of value or positive about Trump, this is it. These are fireside chats for us. He’s talking to YOU. Effing awesome comms. Direct Drops!
1310067236552339458 2020-09-27 12:02:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Lane_From_Nola @in2wishing Spot on! 🤠

1310063731179573248 2020-09-27 11:48:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @davidfrum Where’s Biden, you stupid bastards?
1310063173840433152 2020-09-27 11:46:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump two days prepping? I don’t think so. He’s ready for that stupid bastard.
1310054598850215936 2020-09-27 11:12:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Shem_Infinite Sending out a tweet now is a mild form of PTSD, because it could be your last one. What's so great about that?

1310037999489445893 2020-09-27 10:06:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It’s 4am. Last I checked, Trump is President, none of these clowns are.
1310036687259488256 2020-09-27 10:01:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SurferPatriot Trump always looks good in a tie. He has the best collection I’ve ever seen &amp; no guy I know can tie a knot the way he does. It’s impeccable. I wear my Trump ties to special events. It lets all my Dem relatives know! 😅
1310032272662261762 2020-09-27 09:43:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights My faith is stronger, the dynamics of “good vs evil” seems simple, but is complicated. Deep Swamp shall we say? I’ve followed Trump since 1987 &amp; his faith is growing stronger also. It’s obvious to me at least.
1310026091449393153 2020-09-27 09:18:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ABOwarrior ...and to think this is from 2008, 12 years old technology! Today’s they just can’t show it to us.
1310023550229602304 2020-09-27 09:08:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I like a lot of colors (duh), so not gonna let the Dems ruin my love of blue.

1309981434895986689 2020-09-27 06:21:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @P51leahy Interesting enough Trump only has to watch him destroy himself. Trump may give a little poke or prod to push him along. It’s better this way.

1309975471229026304 2020-09-27 05:57:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @westieTX It's a show! When the Left get ugly as they will, Trump &amp; Senate will let them. Expose themselves. It's just Votes now. Anyone fence sitting/Undecided will see it. The Senate could confirm her by midnight today if they so wished.

1309967838954708992 2020-09-27 05:27:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trumps Key comment at the very end. Just said softly whilst the family is walking to the stage: “Thank You Senators for being here today, This will be easier than what you think.” 💥  https://t.co/BWjD2ktIqo
1309965601335517184 2020-09-27 05:18:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Oh, How they will Howl!  https://t.co/bs65DnrWnQ
1309963512471416832 2020-09-27 05:10:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador Sometimes you just have to make a call. I was 50/50 🤠
1309959888450117633 2020-09-27 04:55:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @scotty_kiker V.

1309948209108668417 2020-09-27 04:09:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> *show ...🤬
1309942937455718401 2020-09-27 03:48:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @beardly01 Been thinking this through. We know Trump can verbally crush him. The best strategy IMO is for Trump to let him destroy himself. It’s all about Votes. Any fence sitters/Undecided can see then for themselves that Biden is mentally “not fit” for the job. Votes Matter.
1309940263985455104 2020-09-27 03:37:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Twitter needs to shut itself down since its Trends section clearly violates its own policy of influencing Voting. Honest Trends would show Trump leading in every area possible. #TwitterTrendsAreRigged
1309939331335819265 2020-09-27 03:34:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HerpesMichael What if he walks on takes one question, then “feigns” anger over Trump being Unconstitutional? then walks off in disgust? Like Nancy ripping Trumps speech in Jan. The Left would cheer this defiance. Anything possible with the Dems. State of Panic.
1309923778575519744 2020-09-27 02:32:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @beardly01 I’m leaning to Won’t show up. But I’m hoping he will, because I really want to see Trump at his best.
1309923108682301440 2020-09-27 02:29:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Will he show up or won’t he?
1309921520261578752 2020-09-27 02:23:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is .@JoeBiden making his  typical Rally appearance today.  https://t.co/lxsu3zCFDG
1309917639746052096 2020-09-27 02:07:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We need someone who can get up in the morning &amp; go to work. You ain't it!
1309917200782827520 2020-09-27 02:06:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @time2_hammer 😅 This one is TOO good!
1309904763153047553 2020-09-27 01:16:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Songbabe109 Yes. I’m sure others pointed it out to her.
1309901691085496320 2020-09-27 01:04:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @thoslyons I’m so sorry to hear. 🙏
1309897332566028289 2020-09-27 00:47:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Songbabe109 Kirstie now gonna get some junk mail coming in? PO BOX?
1309894801362268162 2020-09-27 00:37:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> {Biblical...reads like Q?} The presidential elections in November represent an epochal challenge, a biblical challenge, the outcome of which will be decisive not only for the United States of America but for the whole world.  https://t.co/zORjR9LAj8
1309891342349135877 2020-09-27 00:23:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Er...you can’t even get off of your ass to Campaign, how the hell do you think you can take action? Joe are you Quivering?
1309888944704610304 2020-09-27 00:13:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden...another day off! The Libs are saying he’s prepping for the debate...spare me...he’s had 47 years!

1309726482948788224 2020-09-26 13:28:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers @JoeBiden So do I! 😅
1309725583467708417 2020-09-26 13:24:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> .@joebiden I will be ready to lead day one! Remember that bullshit you said? Of course you don’t. Pudding is being served.
1309711153069580290 2020-09-26 12:27:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Congratulations! Then you must be one of three supporters attending Joe Biden’s enthusiastic get togethers. The other three are reporters.
1309707469447245824 2020-09-26 12:12:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ORGANlCROBOT Yes. Best frozen mango I ever had.
1309705070410227713 2020-09-26 12:03:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Would love that, but you would still infiltrate &amp; tell us what to do. No, we are just going to vote you out.
1309703559538077697 2020-09-26 11:57:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Guided by a laser beam of pure light. Very accurate I hear. 🤠

1309688582869643264 2020-09-26 10:57:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tomorrow we reload our Quivers.
1309680151676907521 2020-09-26 10:24:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CallscinowRon Depends.
1309679586964205571 2020-09-26 10:22:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 10:20 pm on the East Coast. President Trump wrapping up a powerful energetic rally &amp; a super busy day. Joe Biden is reported to be in a fetal position sobbing uncontrollably.  https://t.co/7H0zc6gjEo
1309678967964672000 2020-09-26 10:19:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DigiDiva2020 @KurtSchlichter Correct. Ridiculous concept for a Poll.
1309671639668289537 2020-09-26 09:50:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> #TrumpRally Newport News Virginia. Crowd chanting : “We love Trump!” He’s on 🔥 tonight.  https://t.co/r6Fw2K0wMs
1309669077179277313 2020-09-26 09:40:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @kj_blackburn_o IKR! 39 days...expect more. Desperate people do desperate things.
1309667080740823040 2020-09-26 09:32:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> #TrumpRally Newport News Virginia. President Trump succinctly explaining that everything said against him this past 4 years is : “ Bullshit!” (...I salute you 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸)
1309662681159278593 2020-09-26 09:14:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> There are things more powerful than Twitter shutting down our accounts. Truth is a powerful force of nature.  https://t.co/K5tMSbtlst
1309660164660711427 2020-09-26 09:04:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TTay1223 @Twitter @jack No, but they are trying a Hail Mary to influence the outcome this next 39 days, which itself is an irony.
1309657832690647041 2020-09-26 08:55:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RobertRKimball @paul_furber Nice graphic. You have to ask yourself, Is any of this going to cost Trump any Votes?
1309657302471905280 2020-09-26 08:53:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LasertroutMedia I waited. News seems to travel here kinda quickly, but with everything going on you try &amp; be accurate.
1309656110937198593 2020-09-26 08:48:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Well then, Son of a B*tch.
1309655331471912960 2020-09-26 08:45:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Does anyone else see the problem here? I recommend everyone report the misleading bullshit polls that show Biden is in front, because he is not. EVERY MISLEADING POLL VIOLATES TWITTER RULES!  https://t.co/3PORD7A8th
1309652350991122435 2020-09-26 08:33:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Okay if Rick says ACB...now I know my ACBs. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1309651378944405511 2020-09-26 08:29:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @mcfelixson I don’t know at this point.

1309644456665124865 2020-09-26 08:02:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me @Sim427 Good song title: “ Sally gets around” 😅 related to Runaround Sue ( Susan Rice)
1309641003372929025 2020-09-26 07:48:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Sim427 @LJT_is_me It’s a contender.
1309640421014872065 2020-09-26 07:46:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @paul_furber Just from my mortal observations, Ginsburg’s death has bought about a seismic shift in direction from the Dems. Actually sheer PANIC is the correct word.
1309638556663468032 2020-09-26 07:38:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me That’s the one.
1309632517561958400 2020-09-26 07:14:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hollywdharriet I’m not 💯 sure, but this much I am sure of. He is crooked &amp; so is his Dad.
1309631113652912128 2020-09-26 07:09:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers Kamala has more appeal. ( Kamala is at zero.)
1309630700371365888 2020-09-26 07:07:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me It’s HER to me. Who else could yield &amp; want that power in that moment of time?
1309630426034520065 2020-09-26 07:06:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Barnes is getting a little shilly around here.

1309618668297310213 2020-09-26 06:19:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Deception in front of your very eyes. They don't care anymore.
1309594077906612224 2020-09-26 04:42:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bless_freedom Trump has been playing it at the rallies...it's been sticking.
1309587697309081606 2020-09-26 04:16:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I've seen your face before, my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am Well, I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been It's all been a pack of lies
1309564834761994241 2020-09-26 02:46:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Biden Campaign @JoeBiden is now dead. They just don't know it yet. Dare I say: The Walking Dead. (...Where's Joe?)  https://t.co/oWD7t2HkYW
1309560592198377472 2020-09-26 02:29:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Not sure how the legal process works at this late stage, so any predictions become moot.
1309560269270466560 2020-09-26 02:27:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon No idea. I'm a watcher now.
1309560150466813952 2020-09-26 02:27:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> With what we now know, this has aged poorly.
1309559225903767553 2020-09-26 02:23:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LindaLou5265 ✔️
1309557891163013120 2020-09-26 02:18:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SavageDystrophy Joe Biden.
1309557286923190274 2020-09-26 02:16:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He doesn't want to win. His team know s he can't. No ground game across the Country for Joe Biden. I read today, that some will be taking the easy way out.  The dynamics ALL changed after RBG passed.
1309553178568876033 2020-09-26 01:59:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I propose a simple new Rule. Kayleigh it’s time now to ask the Reporters some questions! 1. Who do really work for?
1309550640083816448 2020-09-26 01:49:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> As of today antifa (.) com still redirects to joebiden (.) com. If you support Joe, you are supporting Domestic Terrorism. There simply is no other way to state this. ( ...the ocean backdrop is just to run deep, that’s all.)  https://t.co/lKHlue9z6x
1309542400436572160 2020-09-26 01:16:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @UG0TTRUMPED @JuliansRum Congratulations!
1309538131847254020 2020-09-26 00:59:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador After 5 pm tomorrow.
1309537574461927425 2020-09-26 00:57:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Left have actually turned into what for so many years they said they despise. #Trump2020
1309535520582590465 2020-09-26 00:49:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Here is an example. We just learned yesterday that had Gen Flynns case been dismissed, we wouldn’t have learned the bombshell revelations that Techno Fog revealed.
1309534543829856256 2020-09-26 00:45:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow I don’t always enjoy it TBH, however the sub-plots are rather fascinating. We just don’t fully know , “ who did it? “ yet. Pass the popcorn please? 🤠
1309533234653405185 2020-09-26 00:40:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is flimsy at best. 😅
1309531761861259264 2020-09-26 00:34:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TheKillShot82 Then I’m in good company. 🤠
1309530074161410050 2020-09-26 00:27:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Silent Majority is Running Silent &amp; Running Deep.
1309511941447016451 2020-09-25 23:15:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Grayman1995 All talk &amp; no action. They NEVER leave.
1309510312882708481 2020-09-25 23:09:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dan’s personal account. He’s pissed. As he should be. DC means Deep &amp; Corrupt!
1309378186673676288 2020-09-25 14:24:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m guessing about one week from the Election, Huffington Post, CNN &amp; MSNBC will be giving Joe Biden a 98% chance of winning.
1309348400073076737 2020-09-25 12:25:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TrumperWavin 5:5 Austin. Posted. (😅)

1309346994222059521 2020-09-25 12:20:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Beautiful. Very #SpaceForce.
1309343099844358144 2020-09-25 12:04:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Watch him Win.
1309342140313423872 2020-09-25 12:01:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Lady_Miss_M Yes.
1309341941448937472 2020-09-25 12:00:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @billnowickisr No statute of limitations on plagiarism. Technically Joe should have been disqualified. Those lies just don’t disappear. Still, Dems just move the goalposts as they go along.
1309339583356702732 2020-09-25 11:50:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hmcd123 I literally understood what they were saying. I operate at the level of  say, A Golden Retriever. Whenever the Dems are on the floor, they talk in circular jargon. Trump is the same with me. He resonates.
1309337909829406721 2020-09-25 11:44:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lex31555 @JoeBiden Exactly!
1309337054082265088 2020-09-25 11:40:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hmcd123 Great. They both spoke well. I understood them.
1309334858682961920 2020-09-25 11:32:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden. Empty words, from an Empty Vessel.  .@JoeBiden
1309333941128552448 2020-09-25 11:28:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MikayesFiona 👍
1309333467428081665 2020-09-25 11:26:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> First? @JoeBiden Would this be in the same manner that you Campaign? Trump is up &amp; at them everyday. That big sack of potatoes Hillary, the one thrown into the Van, Campaigned more than you. You’re really a lazy dog faced pony soldier.  https://t.co/ecpRb57dww
1309327830099005441 2020-09-25 11:04:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I see RED people everywhere. #Trump2020  https://t.co/aMii4C6syS
1309326257251704832 2020-09-25 10:58:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MikayesFiona Congrats. I’m sure you could feel it in the air tonight. ( not just Phil Collin’s song) ...the electricity, the bonding ...good Vibes.
1309325686029447169 2020-09-25 10:55:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me Great Thread Lori. I do think Trump will win. The usual suspects will have a hissy fit, but I believe it will die down for several reasons. It won’t be organic. They won’t get paid. No pay, no riot. Finally good citizens will be willing then to put an end to it. IMO
1309309712492453889 2020-09-25 09:52:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me Haha skid mark! 😅 I’ll read it thanks.
1309308456227151872 2020-09-25 09:47:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @FotherTyme @LJT_is_me When you have a major Election just weeks away, you don’t just “change horses in mid-stream” The Dems never do anything without a good valid crooked reason. We may never find out, but the PANIC from them is real.
1309306934743375874 2020-09-25 09:41:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me He’s not even trying now. Something about RBG passing has changed the entire dynamic. Maybe they thought the Supremes would allow the fake mail in ballots with Comprised Roberts giving a 5-4 victory. Similar to the hanging Chads fiasco Bush-Gore.
1309305526472196096 2020-09-25 09:35:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @VincentCrypt46 My Life with the Q team.
1309305357936685057 2020-09-25 09:34:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @yigsstarhouse Not from Nancy’s quiver, I guarantee that!
1309304919581536256 2020-09-25 09:33:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is the schedule for our Human Dynamo President tomorrow. Sad sack @JoeBiden has said he will be ready from day 1. I don’t think so!
1309304272383664129 2020-09-25 09:30:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me Where’s Joe? Who is he?
1309297214276079621 2020-09-25 09:02:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 👀
1309286037609299968 2020-09-25 08:18:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DazeDonkey True. Just 2-3 minutes of research or listening to Trump cleared that baloney up.
1309285623082098688 2020-09-25 08:16:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @8Notables Paranoia. That’s what running it.
1309281543467143168 2020-09-25 08:00:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @VincentCrypt46 Great Idea! No disputing crowd size + Dan gets special clearance to fly in the No-Fly Zone!
1309234704873218048 2020-09-25 04:54:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is a walk on extra, on "The Walking Dead."
1309234235895545856 2020-09-25 04:52:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It should be really interesting to see how the Democrats de brainwash all of their Voters from the Mail-in Ballots scheme. They got them so terrified with Mail-it- In, now they have to get off of their asses &amp; Vote. Washing Machines. FULL SPIN CYCLE!
1309232483246813184 2020-09-25 04:45:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JuliansRum Nice! 👍

1309201626968674304 2020-09-25 02:42:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PeterZeihan @obront If you can't see Biden has some serious cognitive issues, takes away a lot of your credibility. Biden lacks any serious enthusiasm &amp; people are fed up with Democrat sponsored riots. Read the Tea Leaves.
1309192322828005376 2020-09-25 02:05:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I’m taking the rest of the day off. Putting a lid on it.
1309189919500201985 2020-09-25 01:56:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HigherKingdom Had to put the word “verbal” as a preface. Hated having to do it. 🤠
1309189557263327232 2020-09-25 01:54:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1FreeInhabitant Nothing anonymous anymore. Pros &amp; cons with that. ( taxman you rec’d $1, now we take 33 cents.) Gold/Silver would still be anonymous.
1309187966837776384 2020-09-25 01:48:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @knup9876 Even better. Great television. Let the world see.
1309186671519215618 2020-09-25 01:43:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DailDawson1 Exactly.
1309186304324767744 2020-09-25 01:41:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump probably is doing close to zero time prepping for the so called debate. Why? Because Trump knows what he is talking about. I hope he makes a verbal piñata out of Biden. Gloves are off.
1309160102662987780 2020-09-24 23:57:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SnarkishDanno More plausible than anything else I’ve seen. The worst one of all was that Hunter Biden one. Not even close. Google : HYPERFLESH

1309156960957157377 2020-09-24 23:45:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Looking back, we can clearly  see as to why Joe Biden lost the Presidential campaign. He  didn’t do any campaigning!~Joe Scarborough November 4-2020  https://t.co/0YFMh8WEs1

1308979507307708417 2020-09-24 12:00:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tough words @joebiden from someone who lacks a sack to debate @realDonaldTrump
1308969446975963137 2020-09-24 11:20:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> More than enough are awake. It’s called Insurrection.

1308948538114547712 2020-09-24 09:57:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Sparty80GoGreen Yes &amp; Yes again. Two scoops.

1308903217036754944 2020-09-24 06:56:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I like President Donald Trump.  (...I guess now that's now  considered hate speech.)
1308893606749581312 2020-09-24 06:18:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @gholland04 @POTUS I have a handheld one for our business packaging, it’s wonderful. Can also use in water filtration. They have these as robots for hospitals, cruise ships, hotels &amp; air planes. Way of the Future.
1308892091666268169 2020-09-24 06:12:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dildomcfaggins @peintress3 You wouldn’t be able to shut MSDNC up about it, however Biden is the only Candidate I’ve ever seen with more than one elephant in the room.  ( Dementia, Plagiarism, weird hair sniffing fetish, total corrupt Business deals, bad temper)- Trump is right.
1308880618382647298 2020-09-24 05:27:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AperSonOfEarth I’m just focusing on the Election &amp; winning that for now. After that, we can look at all this.
1308879703529447425 2020-09-24 05:23:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AperSonOfEarth Sorry,but it’s not obvious to me.
1308877881364316168 2020-09-24 05:16:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JazzyJo20 I’ve noticed though, if I’m losing them, others are also. More of an observation of coordinated trickery.
1308876097052909569 2020-09-24 05:09:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How do you lose followers when you are gaining them?  Oh, I know. I’m playing in a rigged Casino with loaded dice!  https://t.co/bjwaDBSysA

1308869504315817993 2020-09-24 04:43:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @time2_hammer Spine! About time.
1308847519263322120 2020-09-24 03:15:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @time2_hammer That would also result in rejection too, wouldn’t it?
1308845992402472960 2020-09-24 03:09:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Only a rumor, I can’t confirm, but heard the reason Joe Biden has been not seen is that he underwent emergency Brain Transplant Surgery. Unfortunately the New Brain rejected him.
1308844204936884228 2020-09-24 03:02:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Serious. I went online looking for Biden’s Campaign schedule for today. Can’t find a darn thing? I was going to make a comparison with side by side pic.
1308843653180387328 2020-09-24 03:00:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Timely. Today. 9/23/20  https://t.co/s9t4Kd1gn5
1308839097826521093 2020-09-24 02:42:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I think this is from last year. He has deteriorated significantly worse in this last 12 months. Frankly it’s been rapid.
1308838051121164288 2020-09-24 02:38:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This video is the 100 % authentic Joe Biden. Famous for his anger, temper &amp; caught out in lying therefore having to deflect. He is terrifying!   https://t.co/OFEwLgcwBC  https://t.co/v9CLqC0XdV
1308836089038331905 2020-09-24 02:30:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Twitter’s autocorrect has been worse than ever lately? Is there an Election coming up?
1308835497565880320 2020-09-24 02:27:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DebHawn I’ve lived long enough. Truth is a good “side” to be on. You can be calm &amp; the facts ultimately reveal themselves. Lies become a serious problem when you plaster them onto top of each other.
1308834897084252160 2020-09-24 02:25:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @aviatorstack Hard to squeeze massive into a single tweet, but I think my basic concept is correct.

1308828704953565184 2020-09-24 02:00:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If this is all Bigger Than You Can Imagine, it means that the US Taxpayers have been &amp; are being fleeced. It’s not just direct Taxation. It’s money going overseas as Foreign Aid &amp; coming back in as slush funds. Example Hunter Biden. All will be revealed.

1308807996978282497 2020-09-24 00:38:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hmcd123 It cost me a lot of money in order to become humble.
1308803519722319872 2020-09-24 00:20:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Drum up massive enthusiasm for Biden? That is your problem right there.
1308655045118799874 2020-09-23 14:30:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SSG_PAIN @Biegenzahn @georgesoros @Twitter @jack @WarNuse @NSAGov @NSACyber One of my favorites. I think she only followed about 45 people &amp; I was honored to be one of them. Her account was a moving History of our times. It was important.
1308649088397631488 2020-09-23 14:07:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @COsweda I can’t wait to watch it. Consider it, Reclaiming some Time, although if his handlers can come up with a way to wriggle Biden out of it they will. They’ve covered him up thus far with a friendly media, but a Debate is their single worst nightmare.
1308645354183643137 2020-09-23 13:52:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hollywdharriet @RealJamesWoods @Gigi58Janjop10 I’ve read aspects of what you saying, so could be plausible. He may have been put up just to lose, he really is a lousy candidate. Also he or (they) may think this would give him some sort of immunity from criminal Burisma charges &amp; crooked China deals involving Hunter?
1308636195467849728 2020-09-23 13:15:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeplorableMikeG Very similar. In 2016 he had to make the sale. His manner now is quietly very assured, without letting up. He still repeats the core phrases, but it’s the off script stuff I’m trying to hone in on.
1308635409727905792 2020-09-23 13:12:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DPatriot1776 @FirstRateAgent @BardsFM She did. Something we discussed in DM. She had a strong hunch they were coming for her, as she has been giving it all lately.
1308634069966573569 2020-09-23 13:07:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ABC ABC. You get one of my secret sauce clues. SOROS&gt;ANTIFA Go!

I also remember Kavanaugh, phony Russia, Fake Mueller, Phony Impeachment Attempts &amp; Antifa arson riots &amp; murder (David Dorn) I love you James but keep your foot on the pedal. Trump is not backing off one inch.

1308606497979420674 2020-09-23 11:17:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Same. I’m been watching the recent rallies and am just in awe. Whole lot of reasons...but the way he is handling the Campaign. Peak performing, in order to Win.

It would have been a TKO against any other, of that I’m sure. “ Only Rosie O’Donell.” 😅 You can’t rehearse for that quick of a comeback.
1308304338784198656 2020-09-22 15:17:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lroy479 I agree. After the 43 days is up we’ll appreciate the gaffes &amp; make threads about them. So much material.

1308277673274335232 2020-09-22 13:31:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CindyBe87902296 I’m 💯 good. My wife is Catholic. I’m independent Christian. Big Catholic family, none of them like this Pope. Probably not a good analogy but they all support the football team,but can’t stand the current coach.

1308274130857283589 2020-09-22 13:17:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CindyBe87902296 Absolutely. Not always, but how come the corruption is nearly always at the top. I’ve lived long enough to know this. I went to the Vatican in 2003. Noticed a lot of money spent there. Been to poor villages with sheds for Churches, felt more comfortable.
1308272476405727232 2020-09-22 13:10:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LaTxGal He ( Trump ) looks very cool in that Tux!

1308267675554988032 2020-09-22 12:51:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @realBHill Everything about Biden is depressing.
1308267107440709633 2020-09-22 12:49:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @phantom_final That works! 🤠
1308266910207717376 2020-09-22 12:48:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @phantom_final I’ve sent many tweets with a photo &amp; one or two words only. Maybe tomorrow will be better for you.
1308266612139548672 2020-09-22 12:47:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher Trump has alluded to this many times &amp; frankly he would have been harder to beat. The young Antifa’s buy into socialism easily, as if it’s something cool. ( they can’t explain what it is however when questioned.)
1308266053567303680 2020-09-22 12:45:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher I used to think that way, but THEY put him up as the nominee &amp; had plenty of time to do so otherwise. How come no Democrats call Joe Biden out? ( ...many know, believe me.) If Trump couldn’t speak for 2-3 minutes I would speak up. That probably is the difference.
1308262650434916352 2020-09-22 12:31:36 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher I’m trying to find a clip that someone mentioned how Joe got caught today? &amp; was off camera, wanting to go home! His deterioration this past 18-24 months has been rapid. We may never know behind the scenes if he was coerced or even drugged/MK to do this. They do Control him.
1308260804228124673 2020-09-22 12:24:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Looks exciting. Both guys in line are like a couple of eager puppy dogs.
1308259366903062528 2020-09-22 12:18:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher This style of dialogue refers to the Democrat Party policies that brain dead Joe would be subject to via his handlers. It’s a real fine line Trump is walking &amp; I think he is doing a great job.
1308258851083284480 2020-09-22 12:16:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher Trump is in a mild dilemma actually. He’s knows Biden has Dementia &amp; virtually says it : “He’s shot!” Other times he goes 🤷‍♂️ &amp; says “Who am I kidding, he’s not his own man &amp; has handlers!” Thirdly he talks as if Joe is a third person...JB will screw up trade, do bad deals.
1308256795194925056 2020-09-22 12:08:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @phantom_final I said too much. Read the picture.

1308220403823702016 2020-09-22 09:43:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Way better chess players than me here, but this seems a real Checkmate move by Trump. The Constitution has Trump supported 100% on this. It’s cut &amp; dried, black &amp; white...call what you want. DONE DEAL.

1308127203738054656 2020-09-22 03:33:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The criminal Democrats don’t do anything without a reason. Massive change in plans from #RBG passing.

1307939409539428353 2020-09-21 15:07:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Leaked questions from the upcoming Debate: " Mr. President Trump: "What is the current President of the Ukraine wife's maiden name, could you spell it &amp; when were they married &amp; what city please?" Mr. former V.P. Biden: " Ice cream, Chocolate or Strawberry?"

1307773664574631936 2020-09-21 04:08:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump at his rallies is shooting 3 pointers all over the court. Incredible, with ease. Feeble Biden can barely pick up the ball to make (even unlimited) free throws. I just can’t see the Debate happening?

1306838557600804864 2020-09-18 14:12:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Racy1Eva His descriptions are “reading my mind”. It’s uncanny!

1306808399846240259 2020-09-18 12:12:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Shem_Infinite @sasky1959 I agree. This was as good as any. His delivery &amp; cadence was amazing. He is not doing what I call a “pressure sell”, he was almost like saying: “ well, this is it &amp; it is what it is.” NOTHING was forced or contrived.
1306806887212412929 2020-09-18 12:06:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MeghanMcCain @CNN I saw Trump tonight. He doesn’t look too rattled. Bonus. I understood every word he said.
1306806417274228736 2020-09-18 12:05:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CovfefeJohn2 I wonder if the debate goes on Trump might actually say in response: “Huh?...What did you just mumble?”
1306805822299594753 2020-09-18 12:02:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @CovfefeJohn2 Yep. Trump tonight said of Joe’s Made in America, How Original!

Their blind hatred of Trump has exposed the fact that they have no platform or ideas. Hate is not enough. Biden is damaged. actual damage being done now &amp; hope to cheat to win. It will fail.
1306436844813385728 2020-09-17 11:36:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @777lonesomedove On top of that are the statistics. You know the Truth however. That’s the glue the binds our corner of twitter together.

1306434354717966337 2020-09-17 11:26:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When I saw Trump enter the Lion’s Den of ABC last night &amp; the super calm, I’m not rattled way he handled it, that moment I knew this is the Final Stretch of the Marathon.

1306404491223203840 2020-09-17 09:27:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HigherKingdom Thanks. I watched the clip ( unfortunately), then playing it in slo mo, you could see the Moment. It’s a casting call to remake The Exorcist!

1306393709232099329 2020-09-17 08:45:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BeavDaniel Exactly! Imagine the outcry if Trump linked to Stormtroopers (dot) com or something remotely like that? 🤷‍♂️
1306387547413598208 2020-09-17 08:20:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RedPillRabbie @dkraft So true. Lamest thing ever seen.

1306278248943251458 2020-09-17 01:06:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Dear @twitter @facebook @google @cnn @msnbc @nytimes nothing is working is it? You can’t stop it now. It’s kinda embarrassing. It used to work. We are The Awakened.
1306275002040295424 2020-09-17 00:53:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The level of enthusiasm for Joe Biden is simply NOT off of the charts...it’s flatlined. Twitter sees no point in creating fake accounts for him, their best strategy is to take out influential accounts &amp; create bots to change the Conservatives narrative. Nothing is working.  https://t.co/BmJLbyIsm2
1306265755021787136 2020-09-17 00:16:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @AwakenedOutlaw Yeh, we are going to have to work real hard to overcome that level of excitement &amp; enthusiasm that Joe Biden has! {sarc}

They've managed to stage a lot of things now, particularly with a complicit media. Trump only has to ask Biden to state The Pledge of Allegiance.
1306092144025772032 2020-09-16 12:46:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EllenKoko It is &amp; that’s the very point. The words are controversial &amp; Trump is just going into Ultra Troll mode. Another option is he can delete it if he didn’t know. Fun for all.

1305665423950581762 2020-09-15 08:31:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @annepaezNOLA From my limited experience Jewish people can be extremely Liberal or Very Conservative. Don’t all societies have a dualistic split of ideas &amp; ideals?

1304525470055067648 2020-09-12 05:01:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I don’t know. But what I do know, things are not what they appear to be &amp; things are not adding up. Logical thinking can be a b!tch.
