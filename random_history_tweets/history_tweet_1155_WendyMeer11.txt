1344067363101159426 2020-12-30 07:46:45 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @ValentineMagic So unbelievable. Thank you so much for trying. If only she knew how many try to reach her. Maybe try a note in a white envelope with a handwritten return address. I find mine get through. NOT that you should have to do that. This is her legal mail. They are denying her rights. ‚ù§Ô∏è
1344035991363989504 2020-12-30 05:42:05 +0800 <WendyMeer11> DENIED on Appeal! It‚Äôs a disgrace.
1344032754997067777 2020-12-30 05:29:14 +0800 <WendyMeer11> 22 days... and counting down. Please return USAF Veteran Reality Winner home to her family.
1344022374719643655 2020-12-30 04:47:59 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Why is the young Veteran who rang the alarm bell &amp; has been silenced &amp; imprisoned for the better part of four years left out of every discussion? Pardons. Russia. Prison. Covid...   She deserves better. Realty Winner lost her freedom. Not for many or fame. She‚Äôs a hero in prison.
1344008903919595520 2020-12-30 03:54:27 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @bjwinnerdavis and myself came on Twitter to advocate for Reality. Mainstream Media was NOT giving her persecution attention &amp; what little media she received was the DOJ‚Äôs narrative. If it weren‚Äôt for Thomas helping to amplify, we would still be lucky to grab a RT. #Grateful
1343959898879631361 2020-12-30 00:39:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> That‚Äôs been the problem all along - hasn‚Äôt it? Reality Winner has been left out of the conversation. Most people have no idea she‚Äôs been silenced and imprisoned for almost four years.
1343953901012320258 2020-12-30 00:15:54 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Please, take a moment and think about this. This happened almost four years ago and Reality‚Äôs sacrifice has been left out of the conversation. This young Vet was politically persecuted &amp; remains silenced &amp; imprisoned.  She rang the alarm bell! It‚Äôs time to bring her home.
1343913847900536832 2020-12-29 21:36:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @jaketapper It‚Äôs long past time to #FreeRealityWinner   Please have her mother @bjwinnerdavis and sister @WinnerBrittany on your show to discuss her persecution.

1343236402356629509 2020-12-28 00:44:49 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner lived in a filthy warehouse, eighty-plus women, one shower, couple of toilets. No Services. No Programs. This was Pre-Covid. This was part of her transfer to prison. They flew her across country in long underwear, not allowing her to keep her jumpsuit. It‚Äôs true.  https://t.co/OSCx47nFEU

1343230493500829696 2020-12-28 00:21:20 +0800 <WendyMeer11> We must fight for her release. Reality Winner has spent the better part of four years fighting for her freedom.  Denied Miranda. Bail. Trial. Forced to Plea... she‚Äôs just trying to survive under Covid lockdown conditions who contracted Covid herself.
1343229102795460610 2020-12-28 00:15:48 +0800 <WendyMeer11> A Whistleblower support group tried to help break the silence and bring awareness of what was happening to Reality Winner by putting up this billboard in Augusta, GA.

1343196240008380416 2020-12-27 22:05:13 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And with the outbreak of Covid-19, Inmates have not seen their families in almost a year. They are treated sub-human, jammed together in units under lockdown conditions, denied sunlight, proper nutrition, programs and humane treatment.   This system is punitive and cruel.
1343195152853196800 2020-12-27 22:00:54 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner‚Äôs record-breaking sentence, no vulnerable non-violent inmates sentence should turn into a death sentence. Why  no Compassionate Release?

Reality always says to me... ‚Äú If you can just help one person today, you can change the whole world.‚Äù  She lost her freedom trying to do just that on a grander scale. Reality tries to do everything she can to help others that are also trying to survive in prison.

1338255118471487489 2020-12-14 06:50:58 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Why was Reality Winner not worthy for Compassionate Release. She meets all criteria.

1337114933167841280 2020-12-11 03:20:17 +0800 <WendyMeer11> At least she was not immediately arrested, denied miranda. silenced, locked up, denied bail, tortured in a rural jail until she pled all while the MSM said NOTHING!  But, yes I agree. The full weight of the system could come down upon her. We must not let there be silence.

1337037376137424897 2020-12-10 22:12:06 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Today is 1,285 days this young USAF Veteran has been silenced and imprisoned.   She‚Äôs been denied due process every step of her persecution- Most recently, Compassionate Release. @JoeBiden please help her. She‚Äôs suffered much too long for her act of patriotism.  https://t.co/rRENdB8AXl
1336842200416653314 2020-12-10 09:16:32 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Thank goodness that she was not immediately arrested and denied Miranda and a bail like Reality Winner.  Reality was persecuted in silence. Media only reported the govts narrative. We must be vigilant not to let that happen here.

She was forced to plea to survive. Unfortunately, prison has not proved to be much better especially with Covid.

1336756242992279552 2020-12-10 03:34:58 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner is in grave danger. She did contract Covid. She is trapped in an infested prison in Texas.   The 11th Circuit Court denied her Appeal for Compassionate Release.  We can‚Äôt allow the Government to turn her record-breaking sentence into a death sentence.

1336689321735299073 2020-12-09 23:09:03 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Please, we need many large platforms to amplify. Reality Winner is a medically vulnerable USAF Veteran. She meets all criteria for Compassionate Release. She has been denied due process since her arrest June 3, 2017. Reality was Forced to plea.  DENIED a BAIL by the same court.üëá
1336679205619306496 2020-12-09 22:28:51 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It sucked. Especially when she found it she was denied Compassionate Release. Again.  #FreeRealityWinner

1336433343173447681 2020-12-09 06:11:53 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Yesterday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Denied her Appeal for Compassionate Release even though she meets all criteria.   This medically vulnerable USAF Veteran cannot get home confinement to save her life.  #CompassionateRelease4Reality
1336432526450159616 2020-12-09 06:08:38 +0800 <WendyMeer11> That would be amazing - since she‚Äôs already served the better part of four years behind bars.  Reality Winner deserves your attention. Many, many supporters will never understand why she has been completely left out of the Russia election interference conversation. It‚Äôs NUTS!
1336429366662803461 2020-12-09 05:56:05 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @DianeAnanda @ColumbiaCounty üëá
1336371382410678274 2020-12-09 02:05:40 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Once more Reality Winner is DENIED Compassionate Release by the same judges that kept her behind bars with no Bail.  No Miranda. No Bail. No Trial and Forced to Plea after one year and 83 days of torture in a rural GA jail.   She meets all criteria and is medically vulnerable.
1336326245349380100 2020-12-08 23:06:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Denied Compassionate Release on Appeal by the 11th Circuit Court. Reality Winner meets all criteria for home confinement.   Does this court want her record-breaking sentence to become a death sentence? Why is this decorated USAF Veteran not worthy? She‚Äôs suffered long enough!!!!
1336323993943461892 2020-12-08 22:57:22 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Brittany made this video last year. I honestly thought in my heart of hearts Reality would be released on home confinement by now. She was just denied on Appeal. Again.  Apparently a young woman, a decorated USAF Veteran who meets all criteria isn‚Äôt worthy to the 11th Circuit.
1336322581079547905 2020-12-08 22:51:45 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Unfortunately Reality‚Äôs birthday sucked! Denied Compassionate Release. Again.  Reality cannot catch a break to save her life.  No Miranda. No Bail. No Trial and Forced to Plea after being threatened with 10 yrs. She never saw daylight after her arrest.  #FreeRealityWinner

1336313687053832194 2020-12-08 22:16:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Two young women. Both #TruthTellers  Let‚Äôs make sure that @GeoRebekah is protected. Reality Winner was persecuted in silence, media repeating the narrative of those persecuting her.   The media is already supporting her. Unfortunately, Reality Winner did not receive the same.  https://t.co/0bPsj3HezU
1336311890184708097 2020-12-08 22:09:16 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Another young woman, Reality Winner was treated similarly. 11 Armed Male FBI agent stormed her home, interrogated and then arrested her on the spot. She was NEVER Mirandized, Denied a Bail &amp; locked up in silence.   Big difference. She is free to speak.  https://t.co/BHuZsLKoM9
1336307100075618304 2020-12-08 21:50:14 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner NEVER had a chance to defend herself. From the day she was arrested, she NEVER saw the light of day. She could NEVER defend herself. The media was silent. Our elected Representatives were silent as well.

1336296406081007617 2020-12-08 21:07:45 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Only in Trumps America. Maria Butina was released early and sent home to a hero‚Äôs welcome.   Reality Winner remains silenced and imprisoned denied Compassionate Release on Appeal.
1336290197462536194 2020-12-08 20:43:04 +0800 <WendyMeer11> He didn‚Äôt... even though Reality had just been denied Compassionate Release and he was actually talking about his difficulty away from his family in prison. Why Michael? It was the perfect opportunity. You have access to media we do not. We need your help.
1336288802323697664 2020-12-08 20:37:32 +0800 <WendyMeer11> USAF Vet Reality Winner remains silenced snd imprisoned denied Compassionate Release for providing the receipts of this very interference.   Please have her mother @bjwinnerdavis on your new show. MSM has not covered this story. Will you?
1336286213238648832 2020-12-08 20:27:14 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This is where Reality Winner lives. She was denied Compassionate Release on Appeal by the 11th Circuit Court.   She meets ALL criteria. The cruelty of her persecution never ends. #FreeRealityWinner

Ask Reality Winner if it‚Äôs possible. Oh sorry, you can‚Äôt - she‚Äôs silenced and in prison!
1336137739142565888 2020-12-08 10:37:15 +0800 <WendyMeer11> They have been denying her legal mail. Just another form of retaliation against her. Reality‚Äôs being denied her basic human rights in many ways while incarcerated.

1336122236101660675 2020-12-08 09:35:39 +0800 <WendyMeer11> We can‚Äôt let that happen. Reality Winner was persecuted in silence. We have to keep Rebekah front and center.
1336121379742248963 2020-12-08 09:32:15 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Unbelievable finding when the BOP to this day has NEVER responded to Reality or her attorneys. Just another tactic to keep Reality Winner behind bars in a Covid-infested prison.
1336120448682258434 2020-12-08 09:28:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Let‚Äôs make sure we keep the volume up on this. We all know what happened to Reality Winner in silence. This young woman is going to need our support and our collective voices.

1336039524057681926 2020-12-08 04:06:59 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Exactly! Reality is not rich or well-connected. She can languish in a Covid-infested prison even though she meets ALL criteria for release. She only served her country in the USAF and earned commendation. Oh right, that service was weaponized and used against her. I forgot.
1336038895797096452 2020-12-08 04:04:29 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @joshgerstein @theintercept The retaliation continues. Reality Winner never stood a chance with that court.

1334885756133838849 2020-12-04 23:42:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It is disgusting. Isolation. Retaliation... all to continue to punish and break her for being a patriot. This young Veteran has suffered beyond measure. @JoeBiden please help asap. Thank you.
1334883621350625282 2020-12-04 23:33:50 +0800 <WendyMeer11> So grateful to @alisongrinter for doing everything she can to support Reality legally through this horrific nightmare! We look to the future and the new administration to assist Alison!

1334606195387228163 2020-12-04 05:11:27 +0800 <WendyMeer11> She can be compassionately released on day 1. She meets all criteria. All the rest can come later. She needs to be released.  Reality Winner has been denied Compassionate Release by the same judge who sentenced her and denied her a bail! The 11th Circuit Court sits on her Appeal.
1334582315532607490 2020-12-04 03:36:34 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Meanwhile... still waiting. Not well-connected or rich, Reality Winner has been waiting on Appeal for months after the same circuit judge who denied her a bail and gave her a record-breaking sentence denied her plea for compassionate release.  She contracted Covid in prison.
1334578303534059520 2020-12-04 03:20:37 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Leigh Winner was 25 yrs old and a decorated Veteran of the United States Air Force when she put her country first and acted to bring us the truth about an attack on our voting infrastructure in 2016.   For her act of Patriotism, Reality spends her 4th birthday in prison.

1333405320706658311 2020-11-30 21:39:36 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This is largely due to Reality Winner‚Äôs Alert of Russia‚Äôs interference into the 2016 Presidential Election.

1332883581794967552 2020-11-29 11:06:24 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This happened at the beginning of her transfer process after spending one year and 83 days in a rural GA jail. Heartlessüëá

1332808216451878922 2020-11-29 06:06:55 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Just as Reality Winner warned us. She remains silenced and imprisoned to this day while all those who conspired against us are free.  This young USAF Vet has suffered beyond measure. She needs our help. Please make sure your voices are heard.  Compassionate Release!
1332803573890101250 2020-11-29 05:48:28 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This üëáüëáüëáüëá This is on my mind and the mind of many Americans. We must address this injustice.   Reality Winner has been silence and imprisoned for the better part of 4 years!
1332802951706972160 2020-11-29 05:46:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @OhioBaylorFan @UNSEATpac @ElaineYbarra5 Her sentence for the action (in the public interest) she took responsibility for was clearly to make her an example. She‚Äôs a USAF Vet, a young woman - not to be used as an example. That‚Äôs not justice.   No Miranda. No Bail. No Trial after being held 1 year and 83 days in a cage.
1332758007940263946 2020-11-29 02:47:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Tazmarac @UNSEATpac It‚Äôs so involved but you can look at the court docs at  https://t.co/kQHoCwbPmX
1332757699403112454 2020-11-29 02:46:11 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Tazmarac @UNSEATpac And her sentence and treatment were beyond the pale. She meets all criteria at minimum for Compassionate Release. The narrative the DOJ painted was false. And due to the Espionage charge, all parties were gagged. Reality never even got a bail.
1332733139509194752 2020-11-29 01:08:36 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @TheRealSonno @Townbiznessman @RepAdamSchiff She‚Äôs safe when she‚Äôs returned to her family. She has suffered far too long. #FreeRealityWinner Compassionate Release which she meets all criteria for now! Like Michael Cohen and Manafort got!
1332732744766541824 2020-11-29 01:07:01 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @TheRealSonno @Townbiznessman @RepAdamSchiff I beg to differ. She was congratulated by a guard when she got her positive Covid diagnosis. She only received Tylenol. She was moved to an overcrowded unit of neo-nazi‚Äôs and has been pepper sprayed. She is trying to survive with water-down soap under lockdown...the list goes on.
1332727214597578752 2020-11-29 00:45:03 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @JanTeegarden @UNSEATpac And the media has primarily been complicit as well. She‚Äôs not important enough or well-connected enough. Every time they were going to do a story on Reality Winner it NEVER happened. There have been articles, but virtually no TV Media other than the false narrative after arrest.
1332726837219385347 2020-11-29 00:43:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @JanTeegarden @UNSEATpac Speak up? Say her name when they spoke about the election interference. When they revered those who blew the whistle. Why was her name ALWAYS left out? The Senate Intel Committee and Mueller both used the info she released. Again, most Americans have no idea who she is.
1332726193536323587 2020-11-29 00:41:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @WhitehurstJr Yes, we need a pressure campaign that does NOT stop until Reality Winner is released. She should not have to spend her 29th birthday on December 4th (her 4th since imprisoned) in this in prison. She‚Äôs spend too much of her 20‚Äôs behind bars.
1332725450297270272 2020-11-29 00:38:02 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @UNSEATpac I also personally feel that the fact she was denied bail and silenced was the knife in the gut. Most Americans had no idea what was happening to Reality. There is far greater support which equals pressure. Unfortunately, Reality has had to suffer so greatly all these years.
1332724335287689221 2020-11-29 00:33:37 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @UNSEATpac That‚Äôs very true. It‚Äôs been heartbreaking and maddening all at the same time. Her record-breaking sentence was clearly retaliatory directed by the Jeff Sessions DOJ. They celebrated its young woman‚Äôs demise. It makes me sick.  https://t.co/Bbdv978ChM
1332713099414163463 2020-11-28 23:48:58 +0800 <WendyMeer11> We can‚Äôt let that happen. She‚Äôs suffered much too long. #FreeRealityWinner   At the very least, she meets all criteria for Compassionate Release. She has already suffered with Covid and is continuing to battle lockdown conditions in a filthy TX prison.
1332698116408156160 2020-11-28 22:49:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @LOLGOP I‚Äôve been pushing as hard as I can since her arrest. Thank you so very much for bringing out the fact that she‚Äôs the only American in prison... No Miranda. No Bail. No Trial and Forced to Plea after being tortured for one year and 83 days. She needs strong voices now, please.

1324129366809464833 2020-11-05 07:20:16 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And Reality Winner remains silenced, imprisoned and under COVID lockdown.

She‚Äôs the inspiration. The injustices done to her, the cruelty, the unfairness... we have to keep trying to bring awareness for Compassionate Release!

These inmates are being treated horribly with lack of soap, nutrition - even chairs. No where to even sit. It‚Äôs intentional. It‚Äôs harmful.

The only one in prison is the young USAF Veteran who blew the whistle. It was bigger than she ever could have known. Reality Winner remains silenced and imprisoned to this day.

She has spent her 20‚Äôs in prison. How about having her mother @bjwinnerdavis on to talk about this young USAF Vets silencing and imprisonment for her selfless alert?  https://t.co/W1ZyKrgYSs
1321557965699166208 2020-10-29 05:02:27 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality was persecuted in silence. Not well-connected or rich, the MSM media ignores her sacrifice.

1319248059767922688 2020-10-22 20:03:42 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner brought us the truth back in 2017 about Russian interference into voting infrastructure. Who do you think they wanted elected?  She remains silenced and imprisoned to this day for bringing us the truth. #FreeRealityWinner

She remains silenced and imprisoned to this day battling Covid and horrific lockdown conditions.   That‚Äôs the thanks this patriot received for her Alert!

1319011364887797760 2020-10-22 04:23:10 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Hey Michael, Chris highlighted Reality Winner‚Äôs persecution when no one else would. He has tweeted her imprisonment and record-breaking sentence is ‚ÄúNuts‚Äù.   If appropriate, can you please try and let America know Trump has a USAF Vet silenced and imprisoned. Most have no idea.

1318907094259695617 2020-10-21 21:28:50 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This is why the DOJ took the hardest-line approach every step of the way in persecuting Reality for releasing that key government document in 2017 - handing down the longest sentence ever imposed to a whistleblower remaining in federal custody well beyond the 2020 election.
1318906403231322112 2020-10-21 21:26:05 +0800 <WendyMeer11> As Reality Winner  reminds me...If you can just help one person today, you can change the whole world. She lost her freedom trying to do just that on a grander scale.   The truth is, the powers that be would love for you to forget that Reality Winner ever existed. Let‚Äôs Get Loud!  https://t.co/ahfIKxzlkr
1318711346117120000 2020-10-21 08:31:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @buckbyers2 @DavidDark To further elaborate... This is the way the DOJ treated a USAF Veteran who not only served her country instead of accepting a full ride to college but tried to save our democracy from election interference.
1318710019085533187 2020-10-21 08:25:43 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @buckbyers2 @DavidDark When Reality was transferred in the dead of nightafter spending one year and 83 days in a rural GA jail denied bail, she was dropped off at Baker County Ice Detention in FL for a few weeks.

1318526736099909634 2020-10-20 20:17:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And the persecution continues and Reality Winner continues to suffer. She battled Covid and is trying to survive in severe lockdown conditions. This is wrong, America.

1316884276273610753 2020-10-16 07:30:52 +0800 <WendyMeer11> 1230 days is much too long for this young USAF Veteran to suffer. The DOJ MUST stop fighting Reality Winner‚Äôs plea for Compassionate Release and the 11th Circuit Court stop stonewalling her Appeal!

1316820831486521344 2020-10-16 03:18:46 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner remains imprisoned for blowing the whistle on Election Interference when NO ONE else would.

1316801563822874624 2020-10-16 02:02:12 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner brought us the truth. For her act of patriotism she was...

She lives in a cage. #Covid positive

1316796328953995266 2020-10-16 01:41:24 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner‚Äôs treatment and record-breaking sentence sends the ‚Äúchilling‚Äù message that if you are not rich and not well connected in this ‚ÄúInjustice system‚Äù, you will be abused.

She has suffered beyond measure in the very country she spent her entire young adult life serving. #FreeRealityWinner
1314910440460357632 2020-10-10 20:47:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I have tweeted a portion of this email. Reality wrote this when she was taken in the middle of the night across country in only her long underwear from Baker Ice Detention Center in FL where she landed for a while to this ‚Äúfacility‚Äù I use that word lightly in Oklahoma.  https://t.co/2WJWWRYBvK
1314909254432821248 2020-10-10 20:42:50 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Let‚Äôs Never forget, Even the Election Asst. Comm. warned the states of election interference because of Reality Winner. This administration did NOT want the American people to know! This is why Reality still sits in prison to this day.  https://t.co/2Ao901NbuG
1314905722644242432 2020-10-10 20:28:48 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @jsambalindo @MichaelCohen212 We‚Äôre you able to mention Reality on @donlemon last night? I wasn‚Äôt able to catch the show? The hosts have invited @bjwinnerdavis on to talk about Reality and then bumped the segment. It‚Äôs been incredibly disappointing. You have the power to make this happen. Thank you.
1314904148471623680 2020-10-10 20:22:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Mainstream media has been complicit in the silencing of Reality Winner. She may not be rich or famous, but she is a young woman, a patriot. Her political persecution deserves coverage. She‚Äôs been denied help at every turn. Imagine how she must feel? Thank you for your commitment.
1314721741898473473 2020-10-10 08:17:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @DaxGigandet He must free USAF Veteran, Reality Winner who has been a political prisoner for the better part of four years. Why? Because she is a patriot and was made an example with a record-breaking sentence for truth telling about election interference.  https://t.co/G9BFM61zwv
1314681681224306690 2020-10-10 05:38:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Wow! I just came across this old tweet. I remember how mad the court was for any advocacy for Reality. Her persecutors wanted her to suffer in silence. Myself and @bjwinnerdavis drove to find this billboard to try and find hope. We are still trying to find hope...
1314675772267823105 2020-10-10 05:15:04 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Snookbitenaples She got skewered! Remember 11 armed male FBI agents came for her. No Miranda. In those court docs you will see the judge never even ruled on the Appeal based on No Miranda.
1314672761680392192 2020-10-10 05:03:06 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Snookbitenaples When the full weight of this administration came down upon her led by Jeff Sessions, they did whatever they wanted and the court in GA backed them up. If you are interested, all her court docs are here  https://t.co/MNKNedoJp2  It was a shit show.
1314662760354115584 2020-10-10 04:23:21 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Snookbitenaples It was unfortunate. But imagine... she was held in a cage 23.5 hrs per day in a rural jail basically deprived of basic needs and endured being assaulted. After one year and 83 days she pled... to survive...and get out of that jail. Remember, no bail was allowed.
1314661906829979648 2020-10-10 04:19:58 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And Reality remains silenced and imprisoned to this day.
1314656674003800064 2020-10-10 03:59:10 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Snookbitenaples Public pressure can work wonders. We have to make sure he hears our collective voices! She has already served an unbelievable amount of time and the Espionage Act charge never fit. He can take a look at the persecution. No Miranda. No Bail. No Trial. Forced to plea to survive!

1313439973887090689 2020-10-06 19:24:26 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I know what it's like for a family to be torn apart and the sadness it brings," Cohen said. "If I can help to alleviate that, I'd feel slightly better about myself."  https://t.co/ik2vTQasKZ

1313269478407524352 2020-10-06 08:06:57 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @MichaelCohen212 @bjwinnerdavis Forever Grateful. Reality has suffered beyond measure for almost four years. She‚Äôs been persecuted in silence. You can change this. Your voice. Your words. Your heart. Thank you.  https://t.co/B6DymfFFmo

1313237323136540672 2020-10-06 05:59:11 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @MichaelCohen212 Thank you so very much. Reality was persecuted in silence. Your voice could bring such awareness. Would you consider having Reality‚Äôs mother @bjwinnerdavis Billie Winner-Davis on your podcast? BTW @Rosie has tried to help gain awareness for Reality since her imprisonment.  https://t.co/GxY9FhYzeU
1313226947644870663 2020-10-06 05:17:57 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner remains a political prisoner to this very day. She is suffering greatly. She is battling Covid and retaliatory lockdown conditions. These inmates are vulnerable and need our voice. Please join me in calling for her Compassionate Release.
1313194427406524417 2020-10-06 03:08:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Can Dr. Fauci independently verify that Trump is #Covid+
1313193283338866689 2020-10-06 03:04:11 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And the irresponsible and dangerous behavior continues...
1313192904538632193 2020-10-06 03:02:41 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @AmandiOnAir This is statement is so incredibly irresponsible I am just punching air!
1313174442948923398 2020-10-06 01:49:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @DavidDark @ChrisMurphyCT She deserves your voice, Senator.
1313168314923876352 2020-10-06 01:24:58 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @MeidasTouch Explain to older people who believe that Trump is the one who is keeping ‚Äúpre-existing‚Äù conditions rather than wanting to get rid of them. I have to explain the difference between the mandate he got rid of vs what they care about - their healthcare. The disinformation took hold.
1313152277373427712 2020-10-06 00:21:14 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Let‚Äôs take a little walk down memory lane... To this day Reality Winner STILL wakes up every damn day in prison, Covid+ in horrific lockdown conditions. The prisons are weaponizing Covid to take rights away from inmates at will. The conditions are horrifying.
1313148735048888320 2020-10-06 00:07:10 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Unfreakingbelieveable!
1313090885429719041 2020-10-05 20:17:17 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @VoLinxx Yes many people. Young and Elderly.
1313090227225989122 2020-10-05 20:14:40 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Exactly! This makes me sick. And on and on... so sorry for your loss.

1312924019050590208 2020-10-05 09:14:13 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @ValentineMagic @audiomagnate @ACLU That‚Äôs horrible. And Reality is missing out on the support.
1312915165709565952 2020-10-05 08:39:02 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @JoeBiden And please do not forget about the young USAF Veteran Reality Winner. She has been a political prisoner of this administration and denied basic rights. She was made an example. She is the only one in prison while Trump‚Äôs cronies are all free.  https://t.co/Uu4uy7YxcX
1312886154795065345 2020-10-05 06:43:46 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Exactly! I keep hearing he is going to be on the campaign trail. He is not in the clear.
1312885540287582210 2020-10-05 06:41:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> He just made a joke of Covid. The disease that has killed over 200,000 Americans.
1312875209494589440 2020-10-05 06:00:16 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And all the resources he took from the hospital. All the people he exposed. This is outrageous and disgusting. When you think of loved ones who were separated from their people and all alone. He pulls this stunt.
1312874483632533505 2020-10-05 05:57:23 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Pass it on...
1312871378933219330 2020-10-05 05:45:03 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And just exposed more people to his Covid infection! I‚Äôm sure as far as the stunt, Trump just said ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù...
1312867675383754753 2020-10-05 05:30:20 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Agree 100%
1312866070156513281 2020-10-05 05:23:57 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @wayne_citizen @promising123 @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs up to her supporters to change that if true. Reality Winner was the first political prisoner of the Trump Administration.  https://t.co/26W2frF2Xg
1312855388614725632 2020-10-05 04:41:30 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Vote! We can then inform the new administration with an army of supporters to #FreeRealityWinner
1312846303332904962 2020-10-05 04:05:24 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Meanwhile, we are still waiting.... Just another example how the court treats the ‚ÄúHaves and Have Nots‚Äù and decides if they ‚ÄúWill or Will Not‚Äù hold a hearing.   Reality Winner‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt appear to be worthy of the ‚ÄúExpedited‚Äù hearing that was stated. Covid? No big deal, right?
1312829167562559488 2020-10-05 02:57:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @alisongrinter My thoughts exactly. But you said it better!
1312801539682119681 2020-10-05 01:07:32 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Not only don‚Äôt we matter, we are so insignificant that when our fellow Americans get sick or even die, ‚ÄúIt is what it is‚Äù....   VOTE!

1312766018452938754 2020-10-04 22:46:23 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner has been targeted since the day 11 armed FBI agents entered her home to arrest her. She has been denied Miranda. She was denied a bail so she could not defend herself. She was silenced and denied a fair trial for 1 yr and 83 days before her FORCED PLEA @ACLU Please

The powers that be can now deny just about all services and claim it‚Äôs because of Covid. From religious services, to programs... these inmates have nothing! As usual, Reality is trying to help others inside however she can...
1312745324964974595 2020-10-04 21:24:09 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I write her name on the beach in the hope that one day she can walk this beach, smell the salt air, run and be free.

1312734748092104706 2020-10-04 20:42:08 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Target. Retaliation. Persecution. On this #SundayMorning @ACLU where are you? You helped Michael Cohen. Please, help Reality Winner. She‚Äôs being denied Compassionate Release even though she meets all criteria. It‚Äôs Criminial. She has suffered so long. Please.  https://t.co/gS8lo27mDh

1312538813349027840 2020-10-04 07:43:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> The detention centers and prisons are able to ‚Äúhide‚Äù behind the Covid pandemic and get away with torturous conditions. No one is allowed in... it‚Äôs a perfect storm of abuse.   We must bring voice to the atrocities happening in these facilities.

1312500266038484992 2020-10-04 05:10:23 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Many have reached out to this congresswoman. Supporters actually begged this Rep on behalf of Reality and the women of Carswell enduring these horrific lockdown conditions. The medically vulnerable are being denied even the most basic rights!

1312484353713135616 2020-10-04 04:07:09 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @collectorcoxy25 We just keep trying to break thru all the noise and chaos in every way we can on social media. If Mainstream Media would interview her mother @bjwinnerdavis that would be huge. Reality cannot speak for herself. And when @JoeBiden takes office, we make sure he hears us.
1312413821252894721 2020-10-03 23:26:53 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Mine too... her persecution is so wrong and incredibly sad. I really thought the people could exert enough public pressure after all this time to at least get her out on Compassionate Release.   But as usual, the mainstream media ignores her imprisonment.
1312409388234272769 2020-10-03 23:09:16 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @jpanzer @bjwinnerdavis Thank you!
1312385744699297793 2020-10-03 21:35:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Yet, Reality Winner remains behind bars to this day battling Covid and lockdown conditions. The DOJ continues to fight her plea for Compassionate Release even though she meets ALL criteria. Please amplify that Reality Winner should be Compassionately Released NOW!
1312374846702133253 2020-10-03 20:52:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @TheBeatWithAri @MichaelCohen212 This is a political prisoner üëáüëáüëáüëá
1312374594058285056 2020-10-03 20:51:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> No, Michael Cohen, you are not a political prisoner. But I know a young woman, a young USAF Veteran who is... Her name is Reality Winner. You should speak out for her since you get media and she does not. She contracted Covid in prison and is being denied Compassionate Release.
1312369697933979648 2020-10-03 20:31:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> As Trump contracted Covid given an experimental ‚ÄúCompassionate Release‚Äù drug &amp; hospitalized, let‚Äôs not forget those who receive NO treatment with their diagnosis. Inmates suffer in lockdown conditions.  Reality Winner has been denied ‚ÄúCompassionate Release‚Äù not the drug but home.
1312365045725134848 2020-10-03 20:13:04 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Meanwhile, Reality Winner and many of inmates contracted Covid. They try to survive under horrific lockdown conditions. Many of these individuals are medically vulnerable and forgotten.   The DOJ continues to fight Reality‚Äôs Compassionate Release and ignore others. Unconscionable
1312071555447427072 2020-10-03 00:46:50 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @thgreatdeceiver She‚Äôs been tortured with neglect...
1312070335102058496 2020-10-03 00:41:59 +0800 <WendyMeer11> The ‚ÄúDenier in Chief‚Äù and all around him receive the best medical care. What about those afflicted with Covid, at no fault of their own, who are neglected and receive little to no medical care? Do there lives matter less?
1312020948296572930 2020-10-02 21:25:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner and many of the inmates at Carswell contracted Covid. They try to survive under horrific lockdown conditions. Many of these women are medically vulnerable and forgotten.   Meanwhile, the DOJ continues to fight her Compassionate Release. Unconscionable.
1311842760065003521 2020-10-02 09:37:41 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Will they be caged like Reality Winner was with NO Miranda, Bail or Trial until they are forced to plea? That‚Äôs what the DOJ did to the young USAF Vet who tried to SAVE our democracy.  Asking for her mother @bjwinnerdavis

1310722682623856640 2020-09-29 07:26:54 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner also brought us the truth. The document released was 100% correct about Russia interfering in the 2016 Presidential Election. Unfortunately, she remains silenced and imprisoned to this day DENIED home confinement still serving her 63-month record-breaking sentence.
1310721481882697740 2020-09-29 07:22:07 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Or did he? Remember, Reality Winner warned us of Russia election interference and was immediately silenced and locked up. And now, we have the Senate Intel refusing to tell us what they know. Why is our electoral process classified? The people have a right to know the truth!

1310684089876459521 2020-09-29 04:53:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> James Comey memos show the FBI under pressure from President Trump to prevent her from leaving her Augusta, Georgia, home during her interrogation. ‚ÄúI said I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message," Comey wrote...‚Äù  ‚ÄúHer‚Äù is Reality Winner
1310682137968943106 2020-09-29 04:45:47 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @audiomagnate Absolutely! Skewered in every possible way. She needs to be released on home confinement.
1310675402021572610 2020-09-29 04:19:01 +0800 <WendyMeer11> We need many powerful voices to help! Reality Winner was denied Compassionate Release by the District Judge who denied a bail &amp; sentenced her. Her fate now lies with the 11th Circuit Court stonewalling her Appeal until November. Reality needs home confinement. Powerful voices?
1310631713807241216 2020-09-29 01:25:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And now he‚Äôs home... served about a minute - while Reality Winner is Denied home confinement.
1310630995469762561 2020-09-29 01:22:34 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And Manafort didn‚Äôt serve anything close to his time. Released to home confinement, while Reality Winner meets criteria, gets Covid and is Denied home confinement.
1310618960166096897 2020-09-29 00:34:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> She can take Reality Winner‚Äôs place!
1310579484551151617 2020-09-28 21:57:53 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Each day that passes and Reality Winner remains imprisoned, Covid+ under these lockdown conditions, more damage is done. How long is she supposed to hold on? She is tired and frustrated and feeling hopeless. We need an uproar, America. She meets all criteria for home confinement.
1310552356120129539 2020-09-28 20:10:05 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Look what happens in Trumps America? Maria is back in her motherland hailed a hero.   We have our hero locked up and gave her Covid.
1310551974606188545 2020-09-28 20:08:34 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner remains silenced and imprisoned to this day. She has battled covid and horrendous lockdown condition in a TX prison.   Meanwhile, the DOJ is still fighting her Compassionate Release Appeal even though she meets all criteria. Retaliation? Where are you @ACLU

Reality has been silenced &amp; imprisoned every day since. Media you MUST report on this persecution.   Why is she left out of the conversation?  https://t.co/gjsHYdVTHy
1310391685558546434 2020-09-28 09:31:38 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Yes!
1310363865042034689 2020-09-28 07:41:05 +0800 <WendyMeer11> If the Jeff Sessions DOJ had NOT gotten away denying her a bail and charging under the Espionage Act, she could have defended herself. Denied a defense and with lack of public pressure due to the secrecy, she was doomed from the day 11 Male (armed) FBI agents entered her home.
1310361963025838080 2020-09-28 07:33:31 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner alerted about Russia interfering into the 2016 Presidential Election. It was clear by her document, this was not Fake news.

"I said something about the value of putting a head on a pike as a message," Comey wrote.   This is what happned to Reality Winner.
1310331247680458752 2020-09-28 05:31:28 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It‚Äôs been almost four years of this political persecution. The retaliation continues as the DOJ continues to fight Reality Winner‚Äôs Compassionate Release plea. Still waiting for a decision under appeal in the 11th Circuit Court - so long she contracted Covid.

1310326916138840064 2020-09-28 05:14:16 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This is terrifying for the American people. All Trump has done his entire presidency is threaten and frighten. .. and when he can follow though. We have to fight with everything we‚Äôve got not to let this happen. There‚Äôs too much suffering, already.
1310317456565641223 2020-09-28 04:36:40 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Rosie @PauletteParis1 Holy! That is so not right.

She‚Äôs being denied Compassionate Release even though she meets all criteria. It‚Äôs Criminial. She has suffered so long. Please.
1310309262883782660 2020-09-28 04:04:07 +0800 <WendyMeer11> That‚Äôs exactly what the DOJ did to silence Reality and continue with the ‚Äúfake‚Äù news narrative. Reality and her family need her home. She‚Äôs suffered much too long ...

1310256022469177345 2020-09-28 00:32:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Not today. Not any day. Reality Winner MUST be Compassionately Released. She meets all criteria. Continuing to punish her is pure cruelty. She‚Äôs battled Covid and remains in lockdown conditions.   The DOJ needs to stop fighting. They already won. She‚Äôs suffered beyond measure.
1310243333294489600 2020-09-27 23:42:08 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Amplify @jennycohn1 Our very democracy depends on it!

1310202411563323398 2020-09-27 20:59:31 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner has served 3/4 of her sentence. Manafort &amp; Cohen did not. She is a decorated Vet. They are not. She is a TruthTeller. They are not. They are home,  Compassionately Released. Reality Winner remains in prison under lockdown conditions. She met criteria. They did not.  https://t.co/yeK1hAKMu2
1310201112398622735 2020-09-27 20:54:22 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It‚Äôs long past time for Reality Winner to be granted Compassionate Release. She meets all criteria. Paul Manafort is home. Michael Cohen is home. Reality Winner is in prison. The one who has served more time than both of them combined! #SundayThoughts  https://t.co/zU3Ccdd2rN
1310003226939359233 2020-09-27 07:48:02 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And can we also please take a look at the political persecution of Reality Winner? She is still in prison for alerting us of this very interference. She brought us the truth and was silenced and locked up. A political prison in the USA.
1309992048691474432 2020-09-27 07:03:37 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @bjwinnerdavis And the way that Mainstream Media leaves her out of every conversation is hard to take. She alerted almost four years ago about this very election interference. Cohen, Manafort, Stone, Flynn... all of them - at home. Reality Winner. Prison. The hypocrisy is very hard to take.  https://t.co/sxzQp3NVmg
1309990529669697538 2020-09-27 06:57:35 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @DTuniman @bjwinnerdavis 11/23/2021 - she has already spent more than 1200 days imprisoned. 1 yr and 83 days of that time was in a rural Georgia jail because she was denied a bail.  Her treatment is a true travesty and irreperable harm has been done to this young women. Why? Because she is a patriot.
1309985172897619968 2020-09-27 06:36:18 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Caygeeeeee @ResisterSis20 Thank you Very much for that. You can always visit  https://t.co/kQHoCwbPmX for more info.

1309956152919298054 2020-09-27 04:40:59 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality was persecuted in silence. Not well-connected or rich, the MSM media ignores her sacrifice. The DOJ ruined this young Veteran, denied a bail and forced to plea after 1 yr &amp; 83 days with no trial. She is trying to survive under lockdown conditions in a TX prison.

Reality is in prison. The one who alerted!!!!

1309843942305869825 2020-09-26 21:15:06 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner rang the alarm bells Alerting of  interference in the 2016 Presidential election.

1309839268098052096 2020-09-26 20:56:31 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Rise up, America! This was wrong during her persecution and it‚Äôs still wrong. Reality Winner remains behind bars denied Compassionate Release to this day.
1309838513240788994 2020-09-26 20:53:31 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner was disappeared by the Jeff Sessions DOJ. Silenced and locked up for revealing Interference into the 2016 Presidential Election. Reality went to the Free Press anonymously. For that patriotic act, she received a record-breaking sentence. It was celebrated. Shameful  https://t.co/iUy5TIsYwM

1309580374771666944 2020-09-26 03:47:46 +0800 <WendyMeer11> .@sruhle as you talk about Russian interference in your interview @JoeBiden please don‚Äôt forget to mention Reality Winner. She alerted us about this very interference in the 2016 election. The Jeff Sessions DOJ swiftly imprisoned her under the Espionage Act. She remains locked up  https://t.co/nKnG1o3TVv
1309575128745943041 2020-09-26 03:26:56 +0800 <WendyMeer11> He doesn‚Äôt care... If you live in Florida please continue to take precautions.
1309569237225222144 2020-09-26 03:03:31 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And now this same court is trying to disenfranchise Floridians who served their time and have every right to Vote. 64%  of Floridians agreed to restore felons' voting rights. The ballot initiative required a supermajority of 60 percent support to pass. This is straight up BS!
1309558896768540672 2020-09-26 02:22:26 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Over 1200 days and counting...

1309526696706674692 2020-09-26 00:14:28 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Yet, he walks free and Reality Winner, the young USAF Vet and NSA Contractor who brought us the truth remains silenced and imprisoned in a Covid-infested prison in TX.  The DOJ is fighting her Compassionate Release even though she meets all criteria. No Miranda. No Bail. No Trial
1309525650173235200 2020-09-26 00:10:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Meanwhile, The media never questioned the false narrative the DOJ used on Reality Winner. It was similar to how they ‚Äúpainted‚Äù the Mueller Report before it ever came out. And when the media just repeated these untruths  - held without Miranda or Bail - persecuted to this day.
1309480416085237763 2020-09-25 21:10:34 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I feel so off every damn day. It‚Äôs like you showed up at the most important meeting of your life with your shirt on backwards and inside out. We must fix this. I‚Äôm going to Vote in person now. I‚Äôve changed my plan.

1309453862038843393 2020-09-25 19:25:03 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This is the same court that denied this young woman BAIL on Appeal. This court has been called out as being ‚Äúout of step‚Äù by Justice Sotomayor and is now on the wrong side of history disenfranchising ex-felons in FL  voting rights.

1309218579980615689 2020-09-25 03:50:08 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Russian internet trolls hired U.S. journalists to push their news website, Facebook says  https://t.co/pH9Gyy8Qp5
1309216894516367361 2020-09-25 03:43:26 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @AlanRay07 She was persecuted in silence.most have never heard of her. If the public had known, there could have been support and pressure.
1309195066381041667 2020-09-25 02:16:42 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner got 63 months. She contracted Covid in prison. She is currently in a max security prison nicknamed ‚ÄúThe House of Horrors‚Äù.  Are we fair yet?
1309189965532794880 2020-09-25 01:56:26 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I agree! Why do you leave Reality Winner out of the conversation every damn day? Is she not rich enough? Important enough? Michael Cohen‚Äôs mug is on tv daily. Reality Winner deserved so much better. The media is complicit in her suffering. Public pressure may have saved her.
1309189085416783873 2020-09-25 01:52:56 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This is straight up BS! Reality Winner got 63 months for trying to WARN AMERICA about election interference. She was denied all due process along the way. That‚Äôs what happens when you get charged under the Espionage Act. Where are you @ACLU??? Look at this disparity. We need help
1309184930950402048 2020-09-25 01:36:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner has spent over 1200 jailed for WARNING about election interference. Never Mirandized. Denied Bail. No Trial. Forced to Plea after one year and 83 days of torture in a rural county jail. She is Covid+ and being denied Compassionate Release. She got 63 months!
1309182904279461888 2020-09-25 01:28:22 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This makes me sick! It‚Äôs long past time to release Reality Winner. She‚Äôs suffered long enough for trying to save our democracy.
1309174358632476672 2020-09-25 00:54:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @joncoopertweets @JoeBiden Are they strategizing how to remove him when he refuses to leave?
1309112717781987333 2020-09-24 20:49:28 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @jennycohn1 @AlexandraChalup It brings me back to every other day, our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù saying if this administration does this or that, if this president does this or that, we are in a constitutional crisis. Well, we‚Äôve been in one. We are in one. We keep fighting... thank you, Jenny.

1308902400695193601 2020-09-24 06:53:45 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @jennycohn1 I don‚Äôt know, Jenny. Strange things are happening. I‚Äôve heard of tweets deleted @donwinslow tweeted he was having a problem. I personally lost 200 followers over night and a hundred or so more the night before.
1308901998490791936 2020-09-24 06:52:09 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And the fuckery in Florida continues...
1308901713596813314 2020-09-24 06:51:01 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Why? Why were they dismissed? If the administration would have listened, Reality Winner would not have needed to come forward with the receipts. To this day, I‚Äôll never understand why not one elected official - even now - has acknowledged her.
1308882623008251904 2020-09-24 05:35:09 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @donwinslow Yes, I lost a few hundred followers today.

1308867667936374785 2020-09-24 04:35:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner informed the states of Election Interference in 2016 when NO one else dare. Why was this information kept from the states? Why was she immediately silenced &amp; imprisoned with a record-breaking sentence? She remains behind bars to this day. #FreeRealityWinner
1308864498296664066 2020-09-24 04:23:08 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner alerted us back in the 2016 election that Russia interfered in our election. She remains in prison to this day. She never got a bail. She never got a trial. Oh did I say she was never Mirandized?   And the DOJ has been fighting her Compassionate Release!
1308863693363478530 2020-09-24 04:19:56 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It was chilling back in 2016 when you ignored the Alert by Reality Winner. Why is she still in prison? Those who did the interfering last time are not.   It‚Äôs time to help Reality Winner @SenBlumenthal She has been politically persecuted for over 1200 days. Do something, sir.
1308862923343826944 2020-09-24 04:16:53 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner rang the alarm bell after the 2016 Election and you know where she is? Prison. You know where all those who aided in the interference are? Writing Books, Podcasts, making millions. It just makes me sick!   It‚Äôs long past time for Reality come home. Raise your voice
1308782779983958017 2020-09-23 22:58:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I agree! What‚Äôs on my mind today and every day is a young Veteran who is being politically persecuted in the United States. Her name is Reality Winner. Her crime - bringing the truth about election interference to the American people. Please join me in texting to help Reality.
1308782006172557313 2020-09-23 22:55:20 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @BarackObama This üëáüëáüëáüëá This is on my mind and the mind of many Americans. We must address this injustice. Reality Winner has been imprisoned over 1200 days!  https://t.co/aLj1vRHxd5

1308745681306353664 2020-09-23 20:31:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner‚Äôs ‚Äúcrime‚Äù was alerting America about the Russian attack on our election systems.   Silenced and imprisoned for more than 1200 days.  Never Mirandized. Denied Bail. No Trial. Forced to Plea to survive.  Now the DOJ is fighting her plea for #CompassionateRelease  https://t.co/q50MmQjTjX
1308734445168533506 2020-09-23 19:46:21 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This nightmare MUST end. Compassionate Release for Reality Winner. Why is she still in prison while those who harmed our country are home?
1308582634554118146 2020-09-23 09:43:07 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And then Jeff Sessions nailed her to the wall. Reality was denied bail, kept in a jail, and has been subjected to a public smear campaign by ‚Äúthen‚Äù Jeff Sessions‚Äôs Justice Department. She was the first whistleblower charged under Trump and her treatment was/is unprecedented.

1308553552470708225 2020-09-23 07:47:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @huntjal @Media Exactly!
1308516823424471041 2020-09-23 05:21:36 +0800 <WendyMeer11> The Mueller Report and the Senate Intel used Reality Winner‚Äôs document release on page 51. She was never mentioned by name. It‚Äôs time for media to report on her political persecution. She‚Äôs suffered for more than 1200 days denied all kinds of rights. Let‚Äôs address this - Finally.
1308514938353315842 2020-09-23 05:14:06 +0800 <WendyMeer11> USAF Veteran and NSA Contractor Reality Winner rang the alarm bells, at her own peril, back in 2016. She is the only one in prison. It‚Äôs long past time to cover this underreported story. Did I say she‚Äôs the only one in prison for telling the truth!
1308513090598731776 2020-09-23 05:06:46 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner MUST be granted Compassionate Release!

1308507289855422465 2020-09-23 04:43:43 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner did contract Covid. She is still enduring a torturous lockdown in a facility known as ‚ÄúThe House of Horrors‚Äù. Reality was congratulated by the guard as she received her positive result. She was also retaliated against for telling her sister about the treatment.

There couldn‚Äôt be a more relevant time to include her as Russia is once again  interfering in the 2020 election just as she warned about in 2016.
1308489685702971392 2020-09-23 03:33:46 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Right on! It‚Äôs not cool to take the people will away. We voted on this!

How much longer should this young woman have to suffer? Please tweet @media. We must bring pressure for her to be released to home confinement.  https://t.co/AM7CME4ElD

1308389374963396609 2020-09-22 20:55:10 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @SharingAlaugh She was/is persecuted.
1308389117722591233 2020-09-22 20:54:09 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @mamastronomy Just to be clear, Reality Winner signed a ‚Äúforced plea deal‚Äù. She was staring down 10 years for releasing that document to the press - anonymously. But she was found out... she will NEVER be allowed to make a dime off of this persecution. Very different than Michael Cohen...
1308161442793828353 2020-09-22 05:49:27 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @aclu why can‚Äôt you at least help with her Compassionate Release? You helped Michael Cohen because of retaliation. Reality has faced retaliation for almost four years! Why, because she brought us the truth!

1308156759287234562 2020-09-22 05:30:50 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I‚Äôve noticed that ‚Äúmany‚Äù who have come forward have written a book. Reality Winner has NO book. She‚Äôs been silenced &amp; imprisoned. She contracted Covid. Denied Compassionate Release.   All those complicit in her silencing who have a platform to amplify her persecution, why?
1308153900265070593 2020-09-22 05:19:28 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And... they are still walking around freely and Reality Winner remains silenced and imprisoned, denied Compassionate Release. Retaliation anyone? Where is her help. Where are you Mainstream Media????  Doesn‚Äôt Reality Winner deserve a mention given she brought us the truth?
1308144323733737472 2020-09-22 04:41:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It‚Äôs been over 1200 days.  Reality Winner, at the very least, deserves Compassionate Release. She suffered long enough and contracted Covid. Here‚Äôs the deal - just because she is NOT rich and famous doesn‚Äôt mean that she doesn‚Äôt matter. Michael Cohen is on tv every freakin‚Äô day!
1308143262880980993 2020-09-22 04:37:12 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And now Michael Cohen has been granted Compassionate Release along with Paul Manafort. Where is Reality Winner. Still in Carswell Prison, often referred to as ‚ÄúThe House of Horrors‚Äù.   Not a peep from even one elected official about this travesty of justice.

1308106661974994944 2020-09-22 02:11:46 +0800 <WendyMeer11> We know the opposite is to be true... Russia hated Hillary and wanted Trump.

1307418827077169152 2020-09-20 04:38:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> If you‚Äôd like to take a look back... Reality has spent more than 1200 days politically persecuted. She has since contracted Covid while the DOJ fights her appeal for Compassionate Release even though she meets ALL criteria.

She rang the alarm bell about election interference in the 2016 election. She‚Äôs served more time than any that harmed our country.   Why is the DOJ fighting her compassionate release?

We need to create enough public pressure that her persecution can no longer be ignored. At minimum, Reality deserves compassionate release, home confinement. She‚Äôs suffered enough.
1306944669415284737 2020-09-18 21:14:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> The media never questioned the false narrative the DOJ used on Reality Winner. She rang the alarm bell back almost four years ago.

1304781915791265792 2020-09-12 22:00:25 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Where are you 11th Circuit Court? Reality Winner was Denied Compassionate Release by the same District Judge who sentenced her. Why can‚Äôt Reality Winner access the Appeals court after the court approved an EXPEDITED Appeal request? They have waited so long she got COVID.

1304773094658187266 2020-09-12 21:25:21 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Media should make this right by reporting on this injustice today.

1304768661987696640 2020-09-12 21:07:45 +0800 <WendyMeer11> The media never questioned the false narrative the DOJ used on Reality Winner. It was similar to how they ‚Äúpainted‚Äù the Mueller Report before it even came out. And when the media just repeated these untruths  - and she was held without Miranda or Bail, the persecution took hold.

1303039254667440128 2020-09-08 02:35:42 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This film tells the extraordinary story of 25-year-old NSA contractor Reality Winner who disclosed a document about Russian election interference to the media and became the number one leak target of the Trump administration.
1302973827228499968 2020-09-07 22:15:43 +0800 <WendyMeer11> *prisoner...
1302973601637896193 2020-09-07 22:14:49 +0800 <WendyMeer11> He served about a minute and is free on home confinement. How did he receive Compassionate Release so quickly?
1302971366111678466 2020-09-07 22:05:56 +0800 <WendyMeer11> The Mainstream Media loves him. He has dirt on Trump, whatever that means anymore. Reality Winner doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúdirt‚Äù on Trump. She is a patriot. She brought us the truth when no one else would. Yet, do you hear her name mentioned - EVER on tv? She needs CompassionateRelease
1302970505780236288 2020-09-07 22:02:31 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This man conspired to harm America. He was placed in a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù camp prison environment for ‚Äúrich‚Äù offenders where he used the time to write his book to make millions.  Meanwhile, Reality Winner,  lost her freedom alerting us all of election interference is still being tortured.
1302966180173565953 2020-09-07 21:45:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> When will their voices be heard? These women aren‚Äôt rich and powerful and suffering in inhumane lockdown conditions.   Why aren‚Äôt non-violent offenders being released to home confinement as promised?  We need an uproar @amnestyusa @ACLU
1302963503825903621 2020-09-07 21:34:41 +0800 <WendyMeer11>  https://t.co/5U1XTNA38r
1302962966879444992 2020-09-07 21:32:33 +0800 <WendyMeer11> We have a political prison in the USA. Her name is Reality Winner. This admin arrested, silenced and locked her up because she alerted about Russia‚Äôs interference into the 2016 Presidential Election when NO ONE ELSE would.   She  is being denied CompassionateRelease. #Covid+  https://t.co/CnmSvtB4hF
1302738851526565888 2020-09-07 06:42:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Neither Crystal Mason or Reality Winner apparently know the ‚Äúright‚Äù people. Neither rich or well-connected. Reality and Crystal met at Carswell Prison. They both deserve so much better from this country. We have to fix this, America.
1302736627656273920 2020-09-07 06:33:10 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @DiegoDubois54 Me too.
1302734066823974914 2020-09-07 06:22:59 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner.
1302617235089915904 2020-09-06 22:38:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> While Michael Cohen promotes his book and will earn millions, Reality Winner remains silenced and imprisoned denied Compassionate Release.   She meets all criteria. Reality has served the better part of 4 yrs. If only she was well-connected and rich. Would she be out?

1302397480332599297 2020-09-06 08:05:31 +0800 <WendyMeer11> This is a tough pill to swallow... how much time did he serve before granted home confinement? Reality Winner served the better part of 4 years, contracted Covid and meets all criteria. The govt will make sure she never makes a dime off her experience. Have a good show on @Maddow

1302320087303684098 2020-09-06 02:57:59 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @RoAnnaSylver @WinnerBrittany I think she‚Äôd like books on this list. Very current. Just a suggestion. She‚Äôs interested in so much.  https://t.co/zSga9yOqkt
1302316058116845570 2020-09-06 02:41:58 +0800 <WendyMeer11> They were unnecessary and hurtful. Please at least give this some thought. You used this young woman as an example in your article, the same way this administration made her one.  https://t.co/NEP9uMh2Ci
1302314050844610562 2020-09-06 02:34:00 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Dr. Dark tagged Reality‚Äôs mother because all that matters to her is that we fight for her daughter. You wounded her mother with you‚Äôre unnecessary words. They felt like a cruel afterthought. Sir, those words were nothing to you, but beyond hurtful to those who love Reality.
1302277208065572864 2020-09-06 00:07:36 +0800 <WendyMeer11>  https://t.co/rohYiGR4iE
1302275403726422018 2020-09-06 00:00:26 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I believe Dr. Dark asked you to ‚Äúrethink‚Äù your lack of empathy for Reality. ‚ÄúI'm no longer a Republican and I have no empathy for Reality Winner, who knowingly broke the law.‚Äù And to please not write misogynistic comments about a young woman, A USAF Veteran who has no voice.

1302239259785560064 2020-09-05 21:36:48 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @jf_darwin They haven‚Äôt been allowed visitation for months. And for Reality, only immediate family was ever permitted. But thank you so very much. Please continue to keep watch what is happening at that prison. We need to continue to expose the inhumane treatment of the medically vulnerable
1302237252983156736 2020-09-05 21:28:50 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @PropheTessMeW Reality has been traumatized throughout this process beyond belief. Her treatment has been cruel and lack of due process unjust. What she has had to endure for releasing one document to ring the alarm bell when no one else would is unfathomable. This young woman is a hero.

1302230078047301633 2020-09-05 21:00:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner brought us the truth. For her act of patriotism she was...  Denied Miranda Denied Bail Denied a Trial Forced to Plea... to survive after 1 year and 83 days in a rural GA jail.   She thought prison would be better. She was wrong. She lives in a cage. #Covid positive
1302229695791083521 2020-09-05 20:58:48 +0800 <WendyMeer11> For all my years advocating for USAF Intelligence Specialist, Reality Winner, I could NEVER for the life of me understand why her service to this country was weaponized against her. Now I do. The person heeding the charge to persecute, views her as a ‚Äúloser‚Äù and a ‚Äúsucker‚Äù.  https://t.co/gcR1JtkO3x

1302038016475762688 2020-09-05 08:17:08 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner did contract #Covid19.  She meets all criteria for Compassionate Release. Why can‚Äôt this USAF Veteran catch a break? She‚Äôs already served the better part of 4 years behind bars.   Why? Because she put country before self. She needs our voice now. Please help.

1301980940869267457 2020-09-05 04:30:20 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @TrueUSAorg You already had me in tears.... we‚Äôve been fighting so hard for so long to try and bring awareness to her political persecution. It‚Äôs been so difficult to make traction. #Grateful beyond words. And grateful to all you have honored in your poignant video.
1301977434783395840 2020-09-05 04:16:24 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Thank you for all of those who have sacrificed. We miss all those lost to injustice. And we await the day Reality Winner is released from prison and is home with her family where she belongs.  Thank you @TrueUSAorg
1301947758857859074 2020-09-05 02:18:29 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @MCEA1969 The harm that has been done to her is immeasurable. She never stood a chance.   No Miranda. No Bail. No Trial. Forced plea. Now she is living in torturous lockdown conditions #Covid+ denied compassionate release.
1301924972374482950 2020-09-05 00:47:56 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Strandjunker Agree! And let‚Äôs remember that Reality Winner not only lost her career, but her freedom trying to warn us. She remains silenced, imprisoned and #Covid+ to this day.   Step up, your country needs you.
1301904500157018112 2020-09-04 23:26:35 +0800 <WendyMeer11> If only Reality Winner‚Äôs document release about Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election would have gained traction. Instead, both the alert and the young woman were tossed away.   Reality Winner remains imprisoned to this day in Ft Worth, TX.
1301876027652800512 2020-09-04 21:33:27 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner has suffered much too long. With all that we know, it‚Äôs clear she was railroaded and locked away.  She is seeking Compassionate Release. Reality meets ALL criteria. The 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, GA holds the key to home confinement. Waiting... #Covid+
1301666364768350208 2020-09-04 07:40:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Crystal Mason went to prison for voting.  Reality Winner went to prison for protecting it. The two met in prison and became friends.  Trump tells Americans to vote, twice while Barr defends it. Who should be punished in this situation?

1301664135009243137 2020-09-04 07:31:28 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Crystal votes to be a good citizen in good faith. Trump tells Americans to Vote twice. Who should be punished in this situation? #2SystemsOfJustice in the USA  Shout out to @TheBeatWithAri for mentioning Crystal. It would be awesome if you highlighted her persecution. It‚Äôs wrong.
1301612793578377217 2020-09-04 04:07:27 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Yet, the only one who brought us the truth, the only one who was out for her country - not herself... remains silenced, imprisoned and #Covid+  It‚Äôs long past time for Compassionate Release for Reality Winner

1301282336223440898 2020-09-03 06:14:20 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Just more and more fuckery. We are in for the fight of our lives.
1301267595719475201 2020-09-03 05:15:45 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I‚Äôm tired of feeling so angry and upset Every Damn Day.
1301259654522167296 2020-09-03 04:44:12 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @BriereJim For now we are safe from Jeff Sessions. He did lose the runoff! Let‚Äôs hope his evil self never holds office again.
1301232490238091264 2020-09-03 02:56:16 +0800 <WendyMeer11> I haven‚Äôt read a more perfectly simple yet truthful statement. Officials. Do. Nothing.

1301218281743962112 2020-09-03 01:59:48 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @AvaResists @gil4cosd9 No, sorry that wasn‚Äôt worded well. I was referring to the 1 doc she released.
1301190983179210753 2020-09-03 00:11:20 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @gaslitnation @jennycohn1 Jenny Cohn is a National Treasure who has worked tirelessly on not only exposing false narratives,  but always offering solutions concerning our vote! Thank you, Jenny. Fantastic episode as always!
1301185521582997506 2020-09-02 23:49:37 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner‚Äôs release was an act of conscience. She‚Äôs a soldier. She did what soldiers do. She put her country before herself trying to protect our democracy when no one else would. #AmericasDaughter
1301184438294978560 2020-09-02 23:45:19 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Reality Winner was also a hero for doing same. She remains silenced and imprisoned to this day. #Covid+ Fighting for Compassionate Release.
1301184010798985219 2020-09-02 23:43:37 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And young USAF Veteran Reality Winner also knew that was false. Look what our govt. did to her? She‚Äôs suffered beyond measure for trying to bring us the truth about our democracy being in jeopardy.
1301182911287353344 2020-09-02 23:39:15 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And when NSA Contractor Reality Winner alerted us, she was swiftly arrested, silenced and locked up    She has remained behind bars with little to no due process. The DOJ continues to fight her Compassionate Releae Appeal while the 11th Circuit stonewalls it. Where is her access?

1300973836691742722 2020-09-02 09:48:28 +0800 <WendyMeer11> And that same DOJ, back in 2017, made sure that Reality Winner, the young NSA Contractor who blew the whistle on election interference thrown into jail, then silenced and imprisoned.  Today, her request for Compassionate Release is being fought by the DOJ. Reality is #Covid+
1300970401036673026 2020-09-02 09:34:49 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It‚Äôs time. #CompassionateRelease for Reality Winner. It‚Äôs time...
1300965671191408645 2020-09-02 09:16:01 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @Titus_Esq So they can just never rule... just like the suppression hearing?
1300964457217224704 2020-09-02 09:11:12 +0800 <WendyMeer11> How much longer will Reality Winner have to wait for a positive home confinement ruling? She meets all criteria. She‚Äôs served the better part of her sentence. She is medically vulnerable. Her family needs her home!
1300958805463838720 2020-09-02 08:48:44 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Inmates incarcerated at the only federally-run medical prison for women in the country say they have been subjected to a ‚Äúhouse of horror‚Äù over the past few months.  As of Tuesday, 73 women have signed onto a potential class-action suit against Federal Medical Center Carswell,

Reality meets all criteria for home confinement. These vulnerable women are being tortured.

1300877910484582405 2020-09-02 03:27:17 +0800 <WendyMeer11> Remember this! Reality Winner was never read Miranda rights. The same court of Appeals in the 11th Circuit NEVER ruled. They are doing it again concerning her Appeal for Compassionate Release.   That‚Äôs not ok, right ‚Å¶@RepAdamSchiff‚Å©   https://t.co/n0vUw19TVZ
1300868947101745152 2020-09-02 02:51:40 +0800 <WendyMeer11> It‚Äôs long past time for Reality Winner to be granted home confinement. Why is the DOJ fighting this medically vulnerable Vet‚Äôs Appeal for Compassionate Release?   If they would stop fighting her, maybe the 11th Circuit Court would finally rule. It‚Äôs been over 3 months! Come on!

She is a medically vulnerable young woman in a Federal Medical Center.   Why won‚Äôt the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rule? How long can they stonewall - it‚Äôs been since MAY!
1300791793714331657 2020-09-01 21:45:05 +0800 <WendyMeer11> @McDutchoven And get a special interview on @60Minutes   Thank you @LynnSmithTV for covering this most underreported story - the political persecution of USAF Veteran Reality Winner  throughout her persecution.  https://t.co/qnhGsSgzbZ
