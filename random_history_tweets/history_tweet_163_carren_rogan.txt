1336336447469539328 2020-12-08 23:46:51 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris You mean Dr. Fauci who told us not to wear masks unless we were sick?

1335953398068355074 2020-12-07 22:24:45 +0800 <carren_rogan> Americans are hard workers. Government should not limit its citizens.
1335952463728357376 2020-12-07 22:21:02 +0800 <carren_rogan> @cnnbrk Is this new. I believe the White House has said wear a mask for months. Is Biden going to dictate that everyone must wear a mask rather than leave it up to the states?  That would be new.
1335242687822368777 2020-12-05 23:20:39 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing Maybe if Trump felt some of that love it would have helped him change his heart. Jesus wants us to love those that are difficult to love.
1335242266785542146 2020-12-05 23:18:58 +0800 <carren_rogan> @amyklobuchar I‚Äôm sure she will go back to private life and have a great job if she wants one. It was important to stand up to the teacher‚Äôs union. Children should not be forced to go to failing schools.
1335241959963766784 2020-12-05 23:17:45 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AOC Housing and education are personal choices. Live within your means. Work hard and put in extra time to get promoted from your entry level job. Be employed so you can have health care at a reasonable cost. We are not victims if we live in the USA.
1335241459818172417 2020-12-05 23:15:46 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden How long before you take over?
1335241357212966912 2020-12-05 23:15:21 +0800 <carren_rogan> @ACEBASEBALLDEV As a high school athlete in the 80‚Äôs we received PE credit if we played a sport. Practicing everyday was much more difficult than any PE class.
1335215091961237508 2020-12-05 21:30:59 +0800 <carren_rogan> Just let it go. Keep your heart happy. Don‚Äôt waste your precious time or energy.  https://t.co/Lh3qS62goY

1334525577135595520 2020-12-03 23:51:06 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Why is it ok to claim they are falsehoods. You should present the news and let the readers decide.

1325564401341095936 2020-11-09 06:22:35 +0800 <carren_rogan> It is not our job to decide who should die. All life should be protected-unborn, convicted, elderly, ill etc.

1325463522835312641 2020-11-08 23:41:44 +0800 <carren_rogan> The media is going to have to redeem itself if people are ever going to give them credibility. Hoping they will now be more unbiased and act like journalist instead of pundits.

1319992107029901313 2020-10-24 21:20:17 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV If the virus particles are able to get through most masks except N95 or higher- what type of mask will be mandated.
1319991308509995009 2020-10-24 21:17:06 +0800 <carren_rogan> Children are amazing

1319632567281291271 2020-10-23 21:31:36 +0800 <carren_rogan> @ChrisLittle25 Omg how awesome would that be for both your babies to be at one school!!
1319632074534457344 2020-10-23 21:29:38 +0800 <carren_rogan> @toddkressvb Much better debate!!  But of course it was because there was a female moderator lol!!
1319631730261823495 2020-10-23 21:28:16 +0800 <carren_rogan> Women are just better!!!
1319631526385061890 2020-10-23 21:27:28 +0800 <carren_rogan> Apparently Joe didn‚Äôt think Obama was affective as president.
1319631125879361536 2020-10-23 21:25:52 +0800 <carren_rogan> @jelani9 He was talking about Presidents.
1319630609447256064 2020-10-23 21:23:49 +0800 <carren_rogan> @cnnbrk At least the Trump administration is being transparent and letting people know. Obama admin knew this too but never did anything or let Americans know.
1319628988260716545 2020-10-23 21:17:22 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BBCWorld What is going on with the occupation of journalist. We need real journalism in a world where social media allows any story to be spread. Journalist need to research and prove or disprove not give their opinions.
1319628437443776514 2020-10-23 21:15:11 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV @JoeBiden And Biden has been part of that institution for 47 years.
1319396321745391617 2020-10-23 05:52:50 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing Unless you keep electing the same people who have done nothing to help our minorities.

1318908485715824641 2020-10-21 21:34:21 +0800 <carren_rogan> We need to empower our citizens not make them more dependent on government. Government will not make you independently or financially stable.
1318908038431072258 2020-10-21 21:32:35 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Still a threat

1318906683926679552 2020-10-21 21:27:12 +0800 <carren_rogan> This is awful!!!
1318905857694961664 2020-10-21 21:23:55 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP As a private citizen not as an elected politician.
1318905408065576962 2020-10-21 21:22:08 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BillieJeanKing @jessmendoza Hopefully not because she‚Äôs a female but because she‚Äôs best announcer.

1318902612192841729 2020-10-21 21:11:01 +0800 <carren_rogan> @hankrsmith Especially when the two choices are the ones we have this election cycle.
1318902198907142149 2020-10-21 21:09:22 +0800 <carren_rogan> @abuvthefold Good  reform. Hopefully someone will invent a ‚Äúknocker‚Äù so that police are not put in dangerous positions.

1318899571729326083 2020-10-21 20:58:56 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV They were asked to turn shirt inside out not turned away. We need to stop limiting free speech. BLM shirts, MAGA hats, etc.  Bring back freedom of speech!
1318898482577575936 2020-10-21 20:54:36 +0800 <carren_rogan> @JohnFugelsang That‚Äôs a good one!  Well done!
1318896346766639104 2020-10-21 20:46:07 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV This is crazy. Election Day should be the deadline. There is no reason except procrastination that would prevent someone from getting ballot in by Election Day.
1318895260748177408 2020-10-21 20:41:48 +0800 <carren_rogan> POWERFUL!                          https://t.co/nHJ3fJvd4U

1318519904228737025 2020-10-20 19:50:16 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BBCWorld Do you seriously believe a country that has millions of Muslims in concentration camps?  They own Biden of course they want Biden.
1318516482616270848 2020-10-20 19:36:40 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Organized by antifa but obviously antifa let‚Äôs others take the blame.
1318515747228975104 2020-10-20 19:33:45 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing 99% of the country wants the same thing. Education reform and criminal justice reform is how we get there. Let‚Äôs empower everyone!!!
1318514919504027649 2020-10-20 19:30:28 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden It will just increase cost of living because businesses pass those increases on to the consumer. It will increase unemployment because businesses will not be able to hire. It will increase the amount of money our government will spend and that certainly is not good.

1317819503762460672 2020-10-18 21:27:08 +0800 <carren_rogan> @dantoujours Not a single Biden has said these emails are fake.
1317818167859810304 2020-10-18 21:21:49 +0800 <carren_rogan> Only a very ignorant person would still believe this quote. Facts matter.
1317813057628868609 2020-10-18 21:01:31 +0800 <carren_rogan> Please retweet this @YouTube let the SGT Report have their channels back. Censorship needs to stop.  This is not ok.
1317454683250806784 2020-10-17 21:17:28 +0800 <carren_rogan> @GlblCtzn @violadavis Yet because she was poor in the USA she was able to overcome and live the American dream. Teach others how you got out of poverty. Show them the way.

1317082076328448000 2020-10-16 20:36:51 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BarackObama Theres not enough poll workers.  I know many who have waited longer for concert tickets or sporting events.
1317081778830663682 2020-10-16 20:35:40 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing Yep unfortunately some people just don‚Äôt care.
1316827945390964736 2020-10-16 03:47:02 +0800 <carren_rogan> Well deserved!! Congratulations
1316717321097019396 2020-10-15 20:27:27 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Do the democrats realize that if the SCOTUS is split 4-4 on Obamacare the decision reverts back to the lower court?  This case will not strike down Obamacare but the scare tactics are useful to the dems.
1316445046850363394 2020-10-15 02:25:32 +0800 <carren_rogan> What a game!!  Way to go Lancers. So proud of @RoganPj

1315996604957184003 2020-10-13 20:43:35 +0800 <carren_rogan> @toddkressvb Cancer sucks!!!
1315995921281417216 2020-10-13 20:40:52 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Be careful what you wish for. With a 4-4 decision on ACA it reverts back to the lower court decision that struck it down.
1315995461724131328 2020-10-13 20:39:02 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing I think it‚Äôs because most of the money goes towards white men and their political campaigns rather than to the inner cities to create opportunities and education for black lives.
1315995035125665792 2020-10-13 20:37:21 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AOC Faith should never be an excuse.

1315993776570142721 2020-10-13 20:32:20 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KristenClarkeJD It means many are voting!!  It‚Äôs awesome that participation is so high!!
1315993396385906690 2020-10-13 20:30:50 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing I don‚Äôt think I have ever voted in a presidential election where the lines were not super long. Love seeing long lines because it means people are involved and voting.
1315635984931983360 2020-10-12 20:50:36 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV No student should know the political leanings of a teacher. Good teachers are masters at this.

1312843379349356545 2020-10-05 03:53:47 +0800 <carren_rogan> @MichelleTeg I find it very hard to believe Obama would have been able to do this.  I guess he could be that good but I doubt it.
1312842994203140097 2020-10-05 03:52:15 +0800 <carren_rogan> @MichelleTeg Thanks for sharing

1312397943387893760 2020-10-03 22:23:47 +0800 <carren_rogan> Respect Life!!!  The willful killing of precious life is so wrong. We are not God and should not decide who lives or dies. All lives unborn, old, convicted, etc.
1312397180364369921 2020-10-03 22:20:45 +0800 <carren_rogan> @EricBoehm87 Hopefully the law passed in January Right to Try for terminally ill can be applied to Covid. Trump was a big advocate for this law.

1312026629011537920 2020-10-02 21:48:19 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AOC Seriously are there no adults in Washington!!!!
1312026214211743744 2020-10-02 21:46:40 +0800 <carren_rogan> @RexChapman Has Biden activated Antifa?  He doesn‚Äôt denounce them. People are responsible for their own actions. These fringe groups are disgusting.
1312025658697175040 2020-10-02 21:44:27 +0800 <carren_rogan> Way to go Lancer!!! Beautiful inside and out!

1312023068680744960 2020-10-02 21:34:10 +0800 <carren_rogan> @RunAdrianMyers Gotta love running!
1312022480966557699 2020-10-02 21:31:50 +0800 <carren_rogan> @fkerley99 Oh wow that‚Äôs fabulous!!!  Cherish the moments.
1312022214389182466 2020-10-02 21:30:46 +0800 <carren_rogan> @CaraSpencerSTL Wow these were all legal shells fired from legal guns?  It‚Äôs time to enforce the laws and hold people accountable. Do we ban cars after a drunk driver kills someone?
1312005683416629255 2020-10-02 20:25:05 +0800 <carren_rogan> Both sides have great goals. If Congress did it‚Äôs job and compromised to bring the best of both together, we all benefit. Both sides also have issues. Teach LOVE!  https://t.co/sJYzUjv9y3
1311644746998329345 2020-10-01 20:30:51 +0800 <carren_rogan> Nice job Lancer!
1311643960792711168 2020-10-01 20:27:44 +0800 <carren_rogan> @brannonmc Amen
1311640273152290823 2020-10-01 20:13:04 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BernieSanders Don‚Äôt worry the Harris administration is almost in.
1311640126846636034 2020-10-01 20:12:29 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris And Biden hasn‚Äôt changed from the man you said voted against helping blacks. He panders first votes and accomplishes little.
1311639369325871105 2020-10-01 20:09:29 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris I keep hearing about voter suppression but no one is able to give me an example. It‚Äôs illegal so it should be easily fixed when identified.
1311638238591954949 2020-10-01 20:04:59 +0800 <carren_rogan> @RexChapman They are pathetic just like antifa.
1311637846206410758 2020-10-01 20:03:26 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing After 47 years of using blacks Biden is now going to change. The choices are awful.
1311637509093437441 2020-10-01 20:02:05 +0800 <carren_rogan> @chrissyteigen May God hold you tightly. I‚Äôm so sorry.
1311637193652305922 2020-10-01 20:00:50 +0800 <carren_rogan> @benshapiro Trump needs to take responsibility for a bad debate. Why say Stand By?  Just stupid he got played.
1311636624338497539 2020-10-01 19:58:34 +0800 <carren_rogan> @NBCNews Do descendants of slave owners pay the reparation? Or is it tax payers which would include blacks and others who had nothing to do with owning slaves?
1311635485329174533 2020-10-01 19:54:03 +0800 <carren_rogan> @IlhanMN At least he believes in the Constitution. He won‚Äôt be president forever but God help us if we reject the Constitution.
1311309943820124162 2020-09-30 22:20:28 +0800 <carren_rogan> @jemelehill Biden‚Äôs right there with him
1311309545214443520 2020-09-30 22:18:53 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing So sad. Definitely didn‚Äôt say to go F up but focused on the far left instead. Really bad answer.
1311309207602372608 2020-09-30 22:17:32 +0800 <carren_rogan> @thattrad We are all sinners. Who are you to judge another human being?
1311308976584355845 2020-09-30 22:16:37 +0800 <carren_rogan> @RobertGarciaLB He certainly did!  Bar was so low how could he lose. The debate was a joke on both sides. What a circus!
1311308636237463552 2020-09-30 22:15:16 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing Seriously you think Biden is the guy. Why would he change his views of black people after 47 years in politics?
1311308419022888962 2020-09-30 22:14:24 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Nope should have talked about what he‚Äôs done and made certain points about Biden.
1311307910656520192 2020-09-30 22:12:23 +0800 <carren_rogan> @realDonaldTrump Take responsibility for an awful performance. Focus on what you‚Äôve done.
1311307577674919937 2020-09-30 22:11:04 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BBCWorld The dems need to read that they wanted to impeach on voter fraud. Trump‚Äôs issue is the problem with sending ballots out and not being able to verify. Look up how many ballots are tossed each election.
1311024302465089538 2020-09-30 03:25:26 +0800 <carren_rogan> No problems at all
1311023561612709896 2020-09-30 03:22:29 +0800 <carren_rogan> Compromise is the only way our government works as it‚Äôs supposed to. Obama and now Trump need to use executive action to get things done because Congress is useless.
1311021518038630402 2020-09-30 03:14:22 +0800 <carren_rogan> @sgodefroid_ This is very sad. Let go of your anger and hatred. There are great ideas on both sides. Biden isn‚Äôt a role model either.
1311020874607124481 2020-09-30 03:11:48 +0800 <carren_rogan> @NBCBLK @BerniceKing Get rid of politicians who have been in office for decades perpetuating the systemic racism in order to maintain power. The politicians are wealthy and live large while many of their supporters struggle day to day. Vote them out.
1310950648947634181 2020-09-29 22:32:45 +0800 <carren_rogan> @Sia_Sia_Sia_ @AP Be careful what you wish for. God bless the USA
1310950438942973955 2020-09-29 22:31:55 +0800 <carren_rogan> @realDonaldTrump Because he‚Äôs not obligated. This is silly. Focus on jobs and the economy you‚Äôre better at that.
1310589984735453187 2020-09-28 22:39:36 +0800 <carren_rogan> Loving @serenawilliams hair today!!  Finish this match!!

1310587910966607872 2020-09-28 22:31:22 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Hopefully they remember where they came from and why they picked the USA.
1310587744909959170 2020-09-28 22:30:42 +0800 <carren_rogan> Happy people are not mean. Pray for mean people they are hurting inside.
1310586860113195010 2020-09-28 22:27:11 +0800 <carren_rogan> @Claire_Kellett @KMOV Page realizes he can‚Äôt control the schools anymore.
1310586516708691969 2020-09-28 22:25:49 +0800 <carren_rogan> @NCAAVolleyball @VBCoachFranklin @ClemsonTigers Do not listen to anyone who tells you that you do not have the right to vote.
1310584631851388929 2020-09-28 22:18:20 +0800 <carren_rogan> @toddkressvb Love it
1310584308889985024 2020-09-28 22:17:03 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing @ClintSmithIII Slave trade began in Africa with blacks selling blacks. We were a British colony. Our history as a country began in 1776 and then the Constitution was created that ever since we have been trying to reach its ideals. We need to continue to become a more perfect union everyday.
1310581147752169472 2020-09-28 22:04:29 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BernieSanders Congress can close tax loopholes but until then they are available to all.
1310579969471533056 2020-09-28 21:59:48 +0800 <carren_rogan> Recheck your history.
1310577640747814912 2020-09-28 21:50:33 +0800 <carren_rogan> @PastorDScott I‚Äôm not sure conservatives do themselves any good attacking someone who wants to vote for Biden. Conservatives should be talking about how their policies help all. Fifty percent of the country will vote for Biden and being rude is a turn off. Lead by example.
1310185847208148992 2020-09-27 19:53:42 +0800 <carren_rogan> @vanessagrigor I guess you‚Äôre not for women‚Äôs rights.
1310185253005336576 2020-09-27 19:51:21 +0800 <carren_rogan> @SenWarren Was Obama‚Äôs nominee illegitimate too?  You are supposed to be an expert when it comes to all things political. Read the Constitution or RBG‚Äôs quotes about the president‚Äôs job.
1310184165367783425 2020-09-27 19:47:01 +0800 <carren_rogan> Very creative

1309477363323932674 2020-09-25 20:58:26 +0800 <carren_rogan> @coopmontana But fun to watch
1309477167139639303 2020-09-25 20:57:40 +0800 <carren_rogan> @Pontifex My mom always taught me to leave something (ie world) better than you found it. God is in charge but we should do our part.
1309475859137540097 2020-09-25 20:52:28 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV Would it matter- Hillary said she would accept election results and didn‚Äôt. Who cares what they say. Let‚Äôs see what they do.
1309475247616405505 2020-09-25 20:50:02 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing Yes let‚Äôs get rid of all the politicians that have been in office for decades building their power on the backs of minorities. Pandering at election time then not doing anything to help real change. It‚Äôs insane to think that somehow this time will be different.
1309474236189343746 2020-09-25 20:46:01 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BBCWorld God bless the USA where freedom of speech is protected. Praying that doesn‚Äôt change despite the woke culture.
1309473069182922757 2020-09-25 20:41:23 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV Sad
1309472858402422784 2020-09-25 20:40:32 +0800 <carren_rogan> @greta But I felt the same with HPV
1309472211221262337 2020-09-25 20:37:58 +0800 <carren_rogan> @greta A bill that if it became law would end up at the Supreme Court. That would be as interesting as a bill for term limits in Congress that would need Congress to pass.
1309100493994631171 2020-09-24 20:00:54 +0800 <carren_rogan> Never saw the movie but read the book and fell in love with the Bears, Sayers, and Piccolo.
1308022932950732803 2020-09-21 20:39:03 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV You can
1308022587407167489 2020-09-21 20:37:41 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing Is there anyone around still who owned slaves and should repent?  How about looking forward working together on actual things that will help. Criminal justice reform, police reform, jobs, healthcare etc.
1307678517006659584 2020-09-20 21:50:28 +0800 <carren_rogan> You know who I‚Äôm talking to!!!  https://t.co/Hcbxf5A11E
1307663690825707523 2020-09-20 20:51:33 +0800 <carren_rogan> @brianschatz The Constitution would need to be amended. It‚Äôs a bigger deal than one person. Relax it will not be illegal.
1307663061482967040 2020-09-20 20:49:03 +0800 <carren_rogan> @ewarren Why use words like fight. We vote in our country to create change real change. Vote for leaders who will actually do what you think they should do.
1307662308571852801 2020-09-20 20:46:04 +0800 <carren_rogan> @mckenna_keil This is what‚Äôs wrong with our country right now. As citizens of the USA we can vote for who we think is best for the country. Many pro-lifers vote for Biden is that ok? Do you see my point.Telling someone they can‚Äôt do something is antiAmerican. Vote Biden vote Trump just vote!
1307660310854209537 2020-09-20 20:38:07 +0800 <carren_rogan> @Surplusinterupt @AP Well that‚Äôs very unfortunate because it sure would help their cause.
1307382887336083458 2020-09-20 02:15:44 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Crazy how it‚Äôs a big earth with China being a huge polluter and most tragic climate events are here.
1307291165675450373 2020-09-19 20:11:16 +0800 <carren_rogan> @HillaryClinton I‚Äôm hopeful there will be many more like her who fight for what they believe in with respect and in a way that makes others want to join.
1307290781405782017 2020-09-19 20:09:45 +0800 <carren_rogan> @donnabrazile That was a lame duck session. A new president was definite.

1307290179036741637 2020-09-19 20:07:21 +0800 <carren_rogan> @NikkiHaley You mean the Harris administration?
1307289562255888389 2020-09-19 20:04:54 +0800 <carren_rogan> @GavinNewsom That was a lame duck session. There was going to be a new president.
1307289333121122309 2020-09-19 20:03:59 +0800 <carren_rogan> Let‚Äôs all help those less fortunate.
1307288817540444166 2020-09-19 20:01:57 +0800 <carren_rogan> @SenSchumer If Trump is re-elected he would not be new so leave the seat open till 2025?
1307286632551387137 2020-09-19 19:53:16 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AriBerman The senate is not based on population that would be congressmen.

1305844112449507329 2020-09-15 20:21:12 +0800 <carren_rogan> Love this!!!
1305843595098951680 2020-09-15 20:19:09 +0800 <carren_rogan> @realDonaldTrump Why?  We live in the USA where you can support anyone you want.
1305843433731432448 2020-09-15 20:18:30 +0800 <carren_rogan> @jsolomonReports The organizers should apply for a thanksgiving day protest permit instead.
1305842350795755520 2020-09-15 20:14:12 +0800 <carren_rogan> @davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The beauty of the USA for now. Everyone is entitled to voice their opinions. God help us if we lose our right.
1305841761504432130 2020-09-15 20:11:51 +0800 <carren_rogan> Was there any doubt!
1305841541076971526 2020-09-15 20:10:59 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris Looking forward to the Harris administration!!
1305841357429395456 2020-09-15 20:10:15 +0800 <carren_rogan> @coopmontana I hope you have a great day!!
1305841002020773888 2020-09-15 20:08:50 +0800 <carren_rogan> It‚Äôs all how the media twists it
1305839982079356934 2020-09-15 20:04:47 +0800 <carren_rogan> @jacquisneal It‚Äôs amazing how many Hollywood people think we care about their opinions. It‚Äôs their right to express their opinions though.
1305839216849494016 2020-09-15 20:01:45 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP Tell me again how we got out of the ice age without humans. Climate change is real but it‚Äôs bigger than humans. We should leave the environment better than we found it, just like everything else, because it‚Äôs the right thing to do.
1305838440731340801 2020-09-15 19:58:40 +0800 <carren_rogan> Thank you
1305838206777274370 2020-09-15 19:57:44 +0800 <carren_rogan> God help us
1305837577241591810 2020-09-15 19:55:14 +0800 <carren_rogan> @RunAdrianMyers They clapped after the moment of silence to show support. I truly believe they were booing the Texans not the actions of the players.
1305836916181528579 2020-09-15 19:52:36 +0800 <carren_rogan> Congratulations Ryan!!  Maryville is lucky to have you. So excited that mom gets to keep watching you play.
1305835988732850176 2020-09-15 19:48:55 +0800 <carren_rogan> @RexChapman @realDonaldTrump Why would you panic
1305835386929901571 2020-09-15 19:46:32 +0800 <carren_rogan> @geniebouchard Congratulations on your wildcard to Roland Garros. Well deserved!
1305514753079607298 2020-09-14 22:32:27 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AlexZverev Thank you for a great match. Looking forward to watching your next major final!!
1305495814127734788 2020-09-14 21:17:11 +0800 <carren_rogan> Thank you @GrandParkSports for another great weekend. @RoganPj so proud of you! @SportsForceBB @stlprospects @BillyOConner_XU @CoachFurlongXU @JordanTabak23  https://t.co/lSiGaZI8I4
1304872068291403778 2020-09-13 03:58:39 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BenjaminSWatson Could have been booing Texans for staying in the locker room
1304391945897283590 2020-09-11 20:10:48 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing The democrat run cities have maintained power using minorities to do so.
1304388218457141251 2020-09-11 19:56:00 +0800 <carren_rogan> @SteveKerr Yep and unfortunately some stupid things get you in real trouble.
1304384090628665346 2020-09-11 19:39:36 +0800 <carren_rogan> Thank you!  Freedom is not free. #neverforget  https://t.co/fmNxIiZgVS
1304146970907475970 2020-09-11 03:57:22 +0800 <carren_rogan> Let‚Äôs make sure they know we care and they matter.  https://t.co/4AqP5jQ3o4
1304140075274510336 2020-09-11 03:29:58 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BBCWorld Hopefully our government will try to stop it this time.
1304138938936971265 2020-09-11 03:25:27 +0800 <carren_rogan> @davidswanson Great example but it‚Äôs not just white Christians.
1304137712476327936 2020-09-11 03:20:35 +0800 <carren_rogan> Let‚Äôs go STL county!!
1304136221388570624 2020-09-11 03:14:39 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris Wow he knew more than scientists. Trump must be a genius.
1304135977250754560 2020-09-11 03:13:41 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AP If he released sooner then it wouldn‚Äôt have an impact on the election. Politics is more important than lives apparently.
1304135774980444168 2020-09-11 03:12:53 +0800 <carren_rogan> @SenWarren No because NY put them in nursing homes.
1304133620693692426 2020-09-11 03:04:19 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing @TheKingCenter Is peace possible without violence
1304133117993680896 2020-09-11 03:02:19 +0800 <carren_rogan> @CNNPolitics Playing it down is not concealing. His task force had news conferences everyday. Ask Dr. Fauci.
1304132612269764608 2020-09-11 03:00:19 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KMOV No
1304132272405217281 2020-09-11 02:58:58 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing There can be peace and justice. The violence is not helping minority communities. It‚Äôs being used to keep white men in power by making blacks dependent on government.
1304131218011828224 2020-09-11 02:54:46 +0800 <carren_rogan> @AlexZverev @AndreyRublev97 Look at those sweet babies
1303791591757426702 2020-09-10 04:25:13 +0800 <carren_rogan> @TellyBrown10 Such a shame!!!
1302944538055639046 2020-09-07 20:19:20 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing 1619 is history but not USA history. We need to teach how the slave trade started and who got rich in Africa because of it. USA history began in 1776.  Since then we have continued to become a more perfect union.
1302942822052573187 2020-09-07 20:12:30 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing Amen let‚Äôs love all our neighbors.
1302942251908243458 2020-09-07 20:10:15 +0800 <carren_rogan> Way to go Mitchel!!!!  Best of luck.
1302941730669563904 2020-09-07 20:08:10 +0800 <carren_rogan> @nytimes @BerniceKing Sold by Africans to British colonists. This was not the USA.  Our history began with the Declaration and then the Constitution which clearly states ‚ÄúAll men are created equal‚Äù. Our founding fathers challenged us to become a more perfect union.
1302940830534172672 2020-09-07 20:04:36 +0800 <carren_rogan> Many are starting to realize they‚Äôve been used for decades
1302940644873207808 2020-09-07 20:03:51 +0800 <carren_rogan> @JoeConchaTV It‚Äôs a rule. Why should rules apply to some and not to others. Top players should be held to a higher standard if it‚Äôs going to be different not a lower one.
1302716238003609602 2020-09-07 05:12:09 +0800 <carren_rogan> @coopmontana Make sure you get your work done
1302611498209079299 2020-09-06 22:15:57 +0800 <carren_rogan> Forgiveness the key to love and happiness. Never forget you are loved!  https://t.co/oaK7WubBdf
1302586962117881858 2020-09-06 20:38:27 +0800 <carren_rogan> @MichelleTeg @IlhanMN Thanks for sharing I got a giggle!!  Much needed humor during these difficult times.
1302350213697490945 2020-09-06 04:57:42 +0800 <carren_rogan> Keep working Nick!!
1302349953017221123 2020-09-06 04:56:39 +0800 <carren_rogan> @IlhanMN Healthcare is a service provided by healthcare workers. It could easily be free if those workers didn‚Äôt want to be paid but that wouldn‚Äôt be fair either. Everyone has access to the ER. Employment generally gets you healthcare.
1302214242725244928 2020-09-05 19:57:24 +0800 <carren_rogan> @dannygokey I don‚Äôt think Jesus has the capacity to hate. Jesus loves racists and wants them to let Him into their hearts so that they too can love.
1302212899998494726 2020-09-05 19:52:03 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing The Constitution states ‚ÄúAll men are created equal‚Äù. It was built with a perfect union in mind and our job is to continue to form a more perfect union everyday.
1302211801006903296 2020-09-05 19:47:41 +0800 <carren_rogan> @andyroddick No one is forced to stay or play to begin with
1302071120607277056 2020-09-05 10:28:41 +0800 <carren_rogan> @johnltrautmann Just an interesting idea I hadn‚Äôt thought about. I remember the reaction to the Patriot Act. No judgement on if it was good or bad.
1301956617358004226 2020-09-05 02:53:41 +0800 <carren_rogan> @thelancerfeed NOW!!!
1301956545731850248 2020-09-05 02:53:24 +0800 <carren_rogan> @BerniceKing If we start with respect we can move towards relationships. Truly knowing others will end racism.
1301955577812262913 2020-09-05 02:49:33 +0800 <carren_rogan> Interesting point of view
1301955264774537219 2020-09-05 02:48:18 +0800 <carren_rogan> I see some beautiful people. Hope all the boys play well today!!
1301862550070534144 2020-09-04 20:39:54 +0800 <carren_rogan> @NYGovCuomo Open the state
1301862385368604674 2020-09-04 20:39:14 +0800 <carren_rogan> @KamalaHarris He wants to open. The governors decide when their states open.
1301861459153035274 2020-09-04 20:35:33 +0800 <carren_rogan> Nice job lancer!!!

1301490882923958272 2020-09-03 20:03:01 +0800 <carren_rogan> @coopmontana You‚Äôre not dumb. Learn from everything that happens in your life.

1300615467049127944 2020-09-01 10:04:26 +0800 <carren_rogan> All children deserve access to a quality education. Online school is hurting the most needy.
1300615101137944576 2020-09-01 10:02:59 +0800 <carren_rogan> @keithboykin We should never defend vigilante behavior but understand it will get worse if this lawlessness continues.
