1329398855549509632 2020-11-19 20:19:20 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @cj_campisano Same for the in-person teaching I do here in the UK! Also what building is that? It doesn't look like my Anthropology lecture halls when I was an undergraduate ASU.
1328642383152615424 2020-11-17 18:13:23 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @DrGBuckingham @CareyDP1 how cool.

1322494850353254400 2020-10-31 19:05:17 +0800 <AleAliSousa> An important history - racism and prejudice impact whose contributions get acknowledged in comparative brain &amp; behavior research. It's never to late to cite someone for their contributions.

1314505814191886336 2020-10-09 17:59:43 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Hosting our first online Brain and Behaviour Seminar - now onto the second talk by Jermaine Ravalier about  research on social workers @Ravalier @BSUHealCognit  https://t.co/tVs2DthpLX
1314500253358460928 2020-10-09 17:37:37 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Great talk by @Ravalier - love the reference to 'Cheddar Man' @CheddarGorge_ in the context of black lives matter in the UK
1314491083926179840 2020-10-09 17:01:11 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Join us right now!
1314309073538555937 2020-10-09 04:57:56 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @leberandy But if the synchronous lecture is also recorded, isn't that the best of both?
1313420036921491462 2020-10-06 18:05:13 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @sofievalk where are the optimists?
1313398597002711041 2020-10-06 16:40:01 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Nice points by Dan Lieberman. Some people think I don't have a car and  cycle &amp; walk because I love exercise. In fact it is because I hate exercise and need the motivation :) Also, I don't understand gym memberships, shouldn't I earn money for my calories?  https://t.co/GlCpc9pUD3
1312052871991627782 2020-10-02 23:32:36 +0800 <AleAliSousa> It turns it my past self was in a much better place to talk about FOXP2 then me after a two hour lecture so I just rolled with it.  https://t.co/KWeKjb7TzP
1312050112147992576 2020-10-02 23:21:38 +0800 <AleAliSousa> At the end of my lecture on Human Evolution I went to a bonus slide about FOXP2 &amp; IT STARTED TALKING FOR ME. I realized it was because I had dragged the slide from a PPT with audio and tried to explain to the students: That is not me speaking, that is my past self!!!
1311949118189826048 2020-10-02 16:40:19 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Can we get lightsabers in every lecture hall please?
1311751303450767360 2020-10-02 03:34:16 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @RobinMazumder @WhereAmINow Congratulations!
1311559221855612928 2020-10-01 14:51:00 +0800 <AleAliSousa> A full day's worth of lecturing Bio Psych in person to students in face masks while simultaneously live streaming to students at home. Jaws tell us a lot, remember jaws?

1307775843167502336 2020-09-21 04:17:12 +0800 <AleAliSousa> This is so funny
1307772277614874625 2020-09-21 04:03:02 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @ElenCaldecott Can I hear please?
1307772193502265346 2020-09-21 04:02:42 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @EvoNeuro Which ones do not?
1307193825576845313 2020-09-19 13:44:29 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @vipiai @GregoryHickok A great question, what does 'doing something' mean. Not just for brains, for anatomy more generally. Both hands seem to share a general function, but many left hands never write and never have a language related function. There should be correspondence in brain.
1306625782308130816 2020-09-18 00:07:17 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @WascherClaudia No such thing as too many backups :)
1306329132553338880 2020-09-17 04:28:30 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @StephesMax @OpenAcademics @n_wiggenhauser Yes, but use scheduled send for limiting emails to work hours. I know many people work out of hours, but that is time me to focus.
1306267284374257664 2020-09-17 00:22:44 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @DrGBuckingham This is a simplification, since "funding" does not equal total resources used.  Resources are not distributed equally across research groups.  It is possible for a person with more funding to actually have fewer resources available for a project.
1305904019697815552 2020-09-16 00:19:15 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @JordiPaps @StephesMax Almost certainly
1304489551470252032 2020-09-12 02:38:39 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Women were 24% more likely than men to study female bird song.
1304487523549417472 2020-09-12 02:30:36 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @DrDawnAlbertson @MattHancock Sorry to hear this :(
1304014567631192064 2020-09-10 19:11:14 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @ProfMarkMaslin I wonder how many kids spent lockdown learning how to criticise government (watching press conferences...)
1304011069002788864 2020-09-10 18:57:20 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @amesoudi Could some of that be done by the publishers themselves?
1303073505743982599 2020-09-08 04:51:48 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @davidrfeinberg @nyuprimatology I think it's a huge advantage to experience different fields...
1302873705643728896 2020-09-07 15:37:52 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @nyuprimatology @davidrfeinberg Hmm... I was asked to give a lecture on human origins to begin a module on biological systems, but this makes me think I should do that for intro neuro / cog as well -- although not in the textbook.
1302870549631246336 2020-09-07 15:25:19 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @IzzyFitton The local housing standard is an exploitation. I figure that there would be less demand due to some students staying at home, I guess not?
1302528080003690496 2020-09-06 16:44:28 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @nyuprimatology @davidrfeinberg People who study all sorts of animal models have no idea about their natural history. This applies to psychologists, including evolutionary psychologists.  It is shocking to anthropologists who focus in human natural history, more than microevolution.
1302526795003179008 2020-09-06 16:39:22 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @nyuprimatology @davidrfeinberg Evolutionary psychologists come from psychology. Unlike anthropology, there is no 'core' paleontology, archaeology, phylogenetics. Natural selection is covered but not natural history. Interdisciplinarity can solve this.
1302524105590288388 2020-09-06 16:28:41 +0800 <AleAliSousa> 🤔
1302510855729434624 2020-09-06 15:36:02 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @IzzyFitton It's terrible. Are other cities not like this?
1302181905497022464 2020-09-05 17:48:54 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @CTennie @MichaelProulx @amesoudi @PsychScientists Oops 🤭 I will keep looking for the actual one -- seems super helpful for defining the concept.
1302178411641737219 2020-09-05 17:35:01 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @CTennie @MichaelProulx @amesoudi @PsychScientists Thanks that's helpful!!!
1302178303592280064 2020-09-05 17:34:35 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @CTennie @MichaelProulx @amesoudi @PsychScientists Maybe this  https://t.co/DkPRP8sqM2
1302176247489986560 2020-09-05 17:26:25 +0800 <AleAliSousa> By "your species" mean the one(s) you study, whether or not it is humans.
1302175874385575941 2020-09-05 17:24:56 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Importance of knowing your species and its natural history!
1302136137998372865 2020-09-05 14:47:02 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Explore your data: 'The most notable “discovery” in the dataset was that if you simply plotted the number of steps versus the BMI, you would see an image of a gorilla waving at you'  https://t.co/IYBcPvwViQ  https://t.co/C1riZuWh6v
1301364806163877889 2020-09-03 11:42:02 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @amesoudi Thanks - those are more reasons social should not simply mean conspecific -- the status of the individuals matter too.
1301362835688218624 2020-09-03 11:34:12 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @amesoudi Oops I think you answered it and I accidentally deleted your response!!!!
1301361679628939265 2020-09-03 11:29:37 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @CTennie @MichaelProulx @amesoudi @PsychScientists Or if "mind" is not part of it, perhaps a lot more species (without nervous systems) have "social learning". Maybe they have Culture0.
1301354082599424001 2020-09-03 10:59:25 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @CTennie @MichaelProulx @amesoudi @PsychScientists Does social learning require an affordance gained through recognition of 'individual' (and maybe 'mind'),  regardless of species/robot copied? So, is learning from conspecifics without something like theory of mind is just using the same mechanism as asocial learning?  2/2
1301353700829659136 2020-09-03 10:57:54 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @CTennie @MichaelProulx @amesoudi Apparently social does not simply equal conspecific learning, based on Alex's examples. So, instead, could the term "social" refer to a kind of affordance?  also asking action psych  @psychscientists 1/2
1301000402444447748 2020-09-02 11:34:02 +0800 <AleAliSousa> @SpeciesTypical @JoHenrich @MGurven Any examples where personality is not so flexible, e.g., due to status, population size... or species diffs?
1300997236105637889 2020-09-02 11:21:27 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Does "social" assume a species composed of similar conspecific individuals.  What about colonial organisms like Portuguese man o' war? Is there a nervous system requirement? What if affordances towards different conspecifics (or other species) varies?
1300997176466735104 2020-09-02 11:21:12 +0800 <AleAliSousa> Nice thread. @MichaelProulx  and I have actually been stuck on the first step: definition of "social" @amesoudi  can you help?
