1334921398268141570 2020-12-05 02:03:57 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @VitoGesualdi Didn't boogie pretty much beg him to show up? This rewriting of history is pretty hilarious tho.
1334920141906321409 2020-12-05 01:58:58 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Hol up, moving to Florida so I can vote for this man.
1334803342883770369 2020-12-04 18:14:51 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> I hope the vaccine makes me retarded enough to enjoy this.  https://t.co/OHCIV5MkwC
1334585374950232068 2020-12-04 03:48:43 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Yo how crazy would it be if @VitoGesualdi was Qanon.
1334525850511958019 2020-12-03 23:52:11 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Oh, so its woke to call eugenics illegitimate, but I ask one question about these vaccines and I'm a science denying bigot. ðŸ™„
1334523940765650947 2020-12-03 23:44:36 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @CrippledJesus @HacktheMovies Also yes.
1334523894309548035 2020-12-03 23:44:25 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @HacktheMovies @CrippledJesus Yes.
1334522329683070976 2020-12-03 23:38:12 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @BasedLAComedian I'm so fucking sick of being alive.
1331496231294685186 2020-11-25 15:13:34 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> 1. Sick here sore you disgusting maggot 2. Why do you always have so much spit in your mouth? Its disgusting. You can literally hear it sloshing around your face while you went on this psychotic tirade.
1331122167388524544 2020-11-24 14:27:10 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Guys I don't think Juice WRLD understood what lucid dreaming meant.
1327131158480629760 2020-11-13 14:08:19 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @MadKing1981 looks like a pizza delivery guy who also sells his grandmothers percocet.
1326575035360882688 2020-11-12 01:18:29 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> I wanna start a buisness where I sell the dead name identities of black trans women as mail in ballots
1324742599152992256 2020-11-06 23:57:02 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Tony from @HacktheMovies crashed my great grandmothers funeral and was making lewd gestures behind my mourning aunts while they said their last good byes. He also refused to remove the truck nuts off his vehicle and demanded to lead the funeral procession. SHAME.
1324741721423491085 2020-11-06 23:53:33 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Even if there's an explanation for all of the alleged fraud and Biden won legitimately the right will never believe it and will scream and threaten mutiny till they're blue in the face. Its going to mirror the lefts reaction in 2016 because they are exactly the same in every way
1324736675831074822 2020-11-06 23:33:30 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @VitoGesualdi Peas in Mac and cheese

1324386860953751554 2020-11-06 00:23:28 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Imagine writing a ten thousand word essay about the election on fucking facebook.

1311122919272128513 2020-09-30 09:57:18 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Watching Biden try to squeeze a sentence out of his potato brain is physically painful to me.
1311122510516228096 2020-09-30 09:55:40 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Wallace pleading with trump to stop interrupting is fucking adorable.

1308865596260601856 2020-09-24 04:27:30 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @SpudLovely @LABasedComedian Yes
1308825357412372484 2020-09-24 01:47:36 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @LABasedComedian No limits on how fast you can make it spin aside from your wallet
1308825109998841863 2020-09-24 01:46:37 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @LABasedComedian A strip clup where you can pay to make the pole spin faster.
1308453136449888257 2020-09-23 01:08:32 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> You need to calm the fuck down.
1308439770029273098 2020-09-23 00:15:25 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> I've dealt with a few of (((them))) today and they all had complaints about their health. Well maybe if you did keep that bloodline so tight your heart would be larger than a crab apple.
1308431832376107011 2020-09-22 23:43:52 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> I held the door at 7-11 for an 80 year old woman, and the cashier called me simp.
1307532062463848449 2020-09-20 12:08:31 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @HacktheMovies This is the saddest thing I've ever read. Happy birthday.
1307529846105538561 2020-09-20 11:59:42 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> RGB looked like one of the council members from Metalocalypse.
1306963420533620739 2020-09-18 22:28:56 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> Hear me out. What if next election, we elect Michael Scott for president. Not Steve Carell, the character Michael Scott. A team of Jewish comedy writers scripting his presidency, obviously there would be a bit of improv if things went off script but hell it could be fun right?
1305426339865014273 2020-09-14 16:41:07 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> I'm white and thats ok.
1305240413888970752 2020-09-14 04:22:19 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @TimJDillon Are you having a stroke?
1303924986307063809 2020-09-10 13:15:17 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> I promise to only ever share clips of, of age women sexualizing them selves, because I'm not a fucking creep like the rest of you #SaveOurChildren creeps
1303152962240475144 2020-09-08 10:07:32 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @LABasedComedian mojitos are traditionally served in collins glasses but a rocks or double old fashioned glass is fine. Those copper tins are usually reserved for mint julep. Though I don't know how traditional the addition of a spider is.
1302324488202260480 2020-09-06 03:15:28 +0800 <JonBreakBadNews> @Darthredx @LABasedComedian Working on a new show. There were creative differences between us so we decided it was best to just end that.
