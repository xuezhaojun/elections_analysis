1343976607720079360 2020-12-30 01:46:07 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @The_Truth_II Been very good.
1343975669395578880 2020-12-30 01:42:24 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @The_Truth_II I think most are like that. Blood tests have stopped for the time being unless you go the hospital and most appointments over the phone which l heard somewhere might become a permanent thing in future. But the GP nurses are still seeing people at least in mine they are and have

1341479886825922566 2020-12-23 04:25:03 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @Alarcos @rupert_pearse These scientists are supposed to have the best brains in the country predicting this and that and yet they couldn't predict that if the worse came to the worse they would need more trained staff to fill these places?
1341476376877133824 2020-12-23 04:11:06 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @Alarcos @rupert_pearse Then why pay out in the first place. Surely they knew this.
1341476077265424393 2020-12-23 04:09:54 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @rupert_pearse Yes l read about the lack of staff. What a waste! All that money could have been used in training staff. What about the doctors they passed early are they not available?
1341473380869009414 2020-12-23 03:59:12 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @rupert_pearse Can l ask why the Nightingales are notj being used to ease this pressure?

1338819517342945281 2020-12-15 20:13:41 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @GaskellsHouse It was worth a trip. Picked up two Steven Hawking books. One of which l was going to order online if the price was right. Now no need!

A year unable to plan anything for fear it goes tits up and 1 person l know who had Covid well that's what they were told but not sent to hospital. Just told to stay home and rest and take tablets.  Like most do with cold or flu.

Why not just give a brief history on one page if they really want people to learn. Its wore than click bait.

1335869657467801600 2020-12-07 16:52:00 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @manairport Are there many flights out of the airport these days. I saw one the other day. Are they going to Europe?

1335544851081949190 2020-12-06 19:21:20 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @jb46teddybear It certainly won't make it easy. Its bad enough now.
1335540990157975552 2020-12-06 19:05:59 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @stjohnambulance I find this a ridiculous waste of money. Did people not know how to wash their hands before?
1334019201628041220 2020-12-02 14:18:57 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @eliascampus @Mermaids_Gender Um. Kiera was 16 when eventually put on blockers? They can get married at 16. Hardly a kid. And 20 when had surgery? An adult who consented. She made a mistake fair enough but that is not the GIRDs fault. She went ahead when she could have stopped way before 20.

1333260132810190868 2020-11-30 12:02:41 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @The_Truth_II And people are still falling for it. If you say its not all about the virus you just get called a conspirator as l have been. It is dividing people. Some people go through a whole life time and still don't learn anything.
1333258958505713665 2020-11-30 11:58:01 +0800 <GEmmettMouse> @The_Truth_II True.

It was thought bring everyone together under the same umbrella meant together we are better. But then some of the L community not all wanted the T taken out as they said LGB was sexual orientation and T

If people want to stay locked up let them and let the rest get on with it without the government telling everyone what to do. Some folk will be needing the government to tell when to use the toilet next.
