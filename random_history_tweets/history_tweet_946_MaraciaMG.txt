1337192765575327751 2020-12-11 08:29:33 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @ott_deb I don’t trust him either. As Dan Bongino says the Obama/Biden administration was the most corrupt in history
1337182147820613632 2020-12-11 07:47:22 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @ott_deb That’s what Rush was saying today. Obama is still calling the shots and he wants Harris as president. That’s why the ok was given to the media to cover the Hunter Biden story
1337179571804909574 2020-12-11 07:37:08 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @Frank24292275 @EmilyCompagno Now you know what it feels like to be a conservative where every media outlet is nothing more than a democrat mouthpiece
1336793553528377345 2020-12-10 06:03:14 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @Brnchiggins1 @agentm0m This suit is saying that these states changed their election laws through their judicial or executive branches, not their legislators. If states change laws correctly or at all, no need to worry

1331364867278839809 2020-11-25 06:31:34 +0800 <MaraciaMG> Sidney Powell on @LouDobbs just now said that she is certain the Trump presidency will be saved.  #TheFive

1329500715539197953 2020-11-20 03:04:06 +0800 <MaraciaMG> Did Fox News even cover the Trump team news conference? I watched on Newsmax

1321251731553112072 2020-10-28 08:45:35 +0800 <MaraciaMG> Since Tucker’s ratings are the highest of any cable channel, I’m hoping people are finally seeing what the media doesn’t want them to see, despite Twitter not letting #Tucker trend   #Tucker

1319434926249435139 2020-10-23 08:26:14 +0800 <MaraciaMG> No wonder the democrats won’t utter the words “China virus” #Tucker
1319396587538423808 2020-10-23 05:53:54 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @pantangeli I believe it. I either mute Dana or FF through her turn
1319393193251753984 2020-10-23 05:40:25 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @OtisthePatriot @TheJuanWilliams Exactly. I used to think democrats in my family would finally see the light but they just go with the dem talking points
1319390286435450884 2020-10-23 05:28:52 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @Sunnydais538 I felt the same way and didn’t vote for either him or Hillary in 2016 but I’m absolutely going with him now.  Biden and the corrupt democrats scare the daylights out of me
1319331597485821959 2020-10-23 01:35:39 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @DrShayPhD Happy Birthday Dr. Shay  https://t.co/fIcfzfXHVI

1318921116753289227 2020-10-21 22:24:33 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @ThorDeplorable That’s why when the trolls start their nonsense on #Tucker I’m somewhat glad because at least they’re hearing what MSM isn’t telling them

1318755091462107136 2020-10-21 11:24:49 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @leatoo @JoeTalkShow @shimmeringmoon Biden doesn’t answer ANY questions! And if someone tries to ask anything harder than what flavor milkshake he ordered, he flips out. Are you for real?
1318717628618317824 2020-10-21 08:55:57 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @RamblingRabli @TuckerCarlson Well then your life will be no different when Biden raises your taxes, makes us dependent on foreign oil (until fossil fuels are gone for good) has you paying for everyone’s college and health care for illegals, and sends your job to China ... but trump is mean

1316118587963252747 2020-10-14 04:48:18 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @bullybelleTN I bet she was promised something to drop out of the primaries

Court packing is adding MORE than the original 9 members. It is NOT replacing a member. Geez why do I feel like I have to explain this nightly to the trolls?

And who knows if that really was her dying wish or just another ploy by the left to put off the nomination. If the Dems had the chance they would do the same

1314388934898733056 2020-10-09 10:15:16 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @ScarletRobinson Yep because crime concerns me as does the rioting that the country has gone through all summer

1314388262253981696 2020-10-09 10:12:36 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @mattmacdonald Plenty of POC live in my neighborhood so racism isn’t an issue....crime is though. Most Americans are definitely not in favor of late term abortion. I don’t suppose you want to see cognitive tests from Biden’s doctors. That should concern you

1314384667819290624 2020-10-09 09:58:19 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @mattmacdonald Biden wants the ability to put low nome housing n the suburbs. Democrats want abortion up to and including the moment of birth. Look up Gov. Northam in Virginia
1314384239102775296 2020-10-09 09:56:37 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @ScarletRobinson Low income housing in the suburbs is something Biden wants to do

1314383579204517889 2020-10-09 09:54:00 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @smashdaddy95 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity It’s true. Gov.  of Virginia took heat for it last year. The mother can decide if she wants the baby while the medical staff keep it comfortable. It’s part of the democrat platform. No limits n abortion up to and including birth
1314382839727742981 2020-10-09 09:51:03 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @t1dcutiepods The governor of Virginia enacted a law that lets the mother decide AFTER birth if she wants the baby or not. The medical staff would keep the child comfortable pending her decision.

1313953350480732163 2020-10-08 05:24:25 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @uncorkedseasons He’s always looking at his notes when it’s his block and doesn’t listen to the others’ answers to his questions. That’s why he usually doesn’t argue during his block
1313838855749992448 2020-10-07 21:49:27 +0800 <MaraciaMG> How do we get the word out to voters about the declassified documents? If the MSM won’t cover the biggest story in our nation’s history how can voters make an informed choice?

1311712515521482752 2020-10-02 01:00:08 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @johnrobertsFox Now I expect you to ask the Biden team why when you go to the Antifa website you are asked to contribute to the Biden/Harris campaign. Why are t you badgering their team with questions about a far left violent org. soliciting donations for them?

1310371277971038209 2020-09-28 08:10:32 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune And Biden used his political position to enrich his entire family. Still waiting to read a Tribune article on this. Of course since you just endorsed Biden because Trump is “mean” I won’t be holding my breath

1309135378339819522 2020-09-24 22:19:31 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @jonwchgo @TheDarthXander @chicagotribune And Hillary said Biden should not concede under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Where’s the Tribune on this?
1308963860129501190 2020-09-24 10:57:58 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @romellcummings Nope not at all. Peaceful is not looting, throwing objects at cops, arson, or shooting cops as just happened in Louisville
1308960294945857538 2020-09-24 10:43:48 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @romellcummings Key word “peaceable “
1308935088063885312 2020-09-24 09:03:38 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @AtwellAmelia @jenaj3 @GovPritzker They knocked 3 times. Yelled “police”. She was not asleep and her name was on the warrant. BLM lies

1308925157206097923 2020-09-24 08:24:10 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @TanerSteve Same here. We’ve even tried the local Fox station in Chicago but it’s only marginally better

1308561626258386949 2020-09-23 08:19:38 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @YouGotCeezed Then how do you know what it says in his record?

1308559945395253248 2020-09-23 08:12:57 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @Stevethebull2 I thought Tucker said he was there working as a lifeguard

Every newspaper, every social media site, every mainstream news outlet, movies, all pro-left garbage. We’re called racists, white supremacists, xenophobes, homophobes. Youre the ones that live in an echo chamber
1308165096112259072 2020-09-22 06:03:58 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @jhhhfjmgs I’ve been wondering that too. I wonder if he fell.

1307122785639108609 2020-09-19 09:02:11 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @sp1coli1983 @FoxNews Exactly. Why should our country be held hostage everytime the left disagrees with something
1307115011681255424 2020-09-19 08:31:18 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @LieDemsLie And rioting
1307112466766327810 2020-09-19 08:21:11 +0800 <MaraciaMG> I’m irate! Why should Republicans back off just because Democrats are going to throw a bigger tantrum then they already have ? #Tucker
1307109497979187200 2020-09-19 08:09:23 +0800 <MaraciaMG> Republicans are way too nice. The democrats would a appoint a SCOTUS  in a heartbeat if the situation were reversed #Tucker

1306796559963742208 2020-09-18 11:25:53 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune And if Biden had been president he would never have closed our border to China or Europe because that would have been xenophobic. Of course Biden can’t remember what happened today much less 9 months ago....fool!
1306795082134302723 2020-09-18 11:20:01 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune Trump also spoke about it at the State of the Union Address. You know the speech that Pelosi ripped up?
1306794740311089152 2020-09-18 11:18:39 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune On January 24 the Senate held a briefing on the coronavirus while the House was in the middle of impeachment proceedings. At the same time Pelosi said the briefing was just “a distraction” from the impeachment.

1301316807324839936 2020-09-03 08:31:18 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @ItsElementary__ She would have sued I’m sure
1301313825124294662 2020-09-03 08:19:27 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @Notyourmother17 @MZHemingway It’s so sad. The stylist was just on Tucker and said she’s receiving threats to burn down the salon. Her business is pretty much ruined
1301305471853355010 2020-09-03 07:46:16 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @JackPosobiec Gee that was fast. Has this been verified?
1301304204510846977 2020-09-03 07:41:14 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @JackPosobiec Wow! This salon and others in S.F. are probably going to to be out of business due to the pandemic and she wants an apology from them?
1301303516166860805 2020-09-03 07:38:29 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @MZHemingway What I don’t get is, she’s a multimillionaire so why can’t she just have someone come to her house to do her hair?
1301279295428603905 2020-09-03 06:02:15 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @Sara_BARISTA @dbongino pointed out today that Biden said he would also reverse the Trump tax cuts which effect the middle class. So either way taxes go up

1300960117026848768 2020-09-02 08:53:57 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @LanderTyson I wonder how he got them? And who taped him? Would Cohen secretly tape his BFF?
1300914308533161984 2020-09-02 05:51:55 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @TwitersWorse He said kids are not “super spreaders” and science has shown that

1300620747010867202 2020-09-01 10:25:25 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune That’s what happens libs when you threaten to defund the police
1300620378642014213 2020-09-01 10:23:57 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @LeftisRight20 @chicagotribune Yeah that’s why he keeps asking democrat mayors to let him send in the national guard so conservatives can continue to riot. Don’t fall for the MSM’s latest talking point. Dems didn’t care until it started to hurt Joes poll numbers
1300619304891711488 2020-09-01 10:19:41 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @chicagotribune You can stop now @chicagotribune. We’re not falling for it anymore.
1300618224896278528 2020-09-01 10:15:23 +0800 <MaraciaMG> @fstop414 @Marc5758 @chicagotribune Right it’s those conservatives rioting, looting, setting fires, and shooting each other in democrat states with democrat governors.
