After the war certain things changed and the Croats gave up the three finger because there was a desire to distinguish the cultures. It morphed into a Serb thing.

No one has spawned more impersonators. And those impersonators happen to be on the same drug cocktail as a 50s housewife.

1331088748050849792 2020-11-24 12:14:22 +0800 <borisjela> @marcus_brown_95 I completely accept the position that there is cool hip hop. I admit I don’t know the Griselda boys, but Pusha T pre-dates the era of pharmaceutical drug rap. But kids in high school are not listing to Lord Willin’ or Hell Hath No Fury anymore.

The Proud Boys should pick whichever of these brands is most successful and make that their official brand. If Amazon then decides to remove it, move on to the second most successful brand. Rinse, repeat.

1311771365087891462 2020-10-02 04:53:59 +0800 <borisjela> The Proud Boys conversation is retarded. The anti-PB crowd has repeatedly presented themselves as the “adults in the room.” Yet they continue to willfully deny the reality of the PBs. Political theatre in 2020 is a production of Cats put on by the local sanitarium.

The problem these novelists face is that they, or their ideas, are out of fashion. Or they’re simply not writing anything that resonates. History is moved by transgressive thinkers, not conformists.

There a 0% chance war does not start back up at some point in the not too distant future (say our lifetime). US intervention to prevent that is simply kicking the can down the road.

That said, economic normalization will not bring peace there. The war isn’t over. US showed up and broke up a fight but both sides are just waiting for US to leave so the fight can start again.
