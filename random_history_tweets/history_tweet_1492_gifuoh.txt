Back in September, he could‚Äôve put the screws on reluctant Republican Senators and forced them to vote in favor of a much larger stimulus bill. Heck, he might‚Äôve won re-election that way. His electoral calculus never made any sense to me.
1341547603012423680 2020-12-23 08:54:07 +0800 <gifuoh> @Norm28Eric @KellyO Trump could, theoretically, tighten the screws on members if they have to vote on this again (after a veto). To override a veto, Congress needs two-thirds of both chambers. Unclear if the votes would still be there.

And, this would require calling Congress back into session and hoping that all the votes in favor that were there the first time still vote in favor.

Here‚Äôs the deal: The Federalists content moderation isn‚Äôt election interference. Twitter‚Äôs content moderation isn‚Äôt election interference, either.
