1337340154961420290 2020-12-11 18:15:14 +0800 <sapgasm> It's fairly clear the EU are going down the root of hoping no deal will destroy @BorisJohnson and the tories so they can hopefully get a replacement who will give in to their demands.

1335001213033713664 2020-12-05 07:21:06 +0800 <sapgasm> @rarelyused123 @DecalT17 So your saying in the future supermarkets will shell millions out on food that can't sell, do you realise how stupid you are.  We can't be overrun now or in the future if it can't be sold because no one would invest in it, and cheek to say I don't understand, you're delusional

1334996903323430912 2020-12-05 07:03:59 +0800 <sapgasm> @Gareth_Hale_84 Are 48% whining interesting.. Most remainers who accept democracy accepted the result, the remainiacs even drove them away from the cause. Everyone doesn't want whats best hence the relentless failed campaign, drama, hassle remainers have subjected the country to last 4 years.

You can't have a deal if other party wants to make you a colony, Unless you want us to roll over so Barnier can take the clothes off your back. Remainers only ever talk the country down. #pathetic

1334990997089112067 2020-12-05 06:40:31 +0800 <sapgasm> @rarelyused123 @DecalT17 So we can't be overrun then because no one would and is purchasing this food that can't sell, your logic is flawed #tryharder

1333873629810003968 2020-12-02 04:40:30 +0800 <sapgasm> @DavidVidecette Restrictions not harsh enough for labour, they think abstaining means we won't punish them, parliament as a whole is responsible.

1333844604249137152 2020-12-02 02:45:09 +0800 <sapgasm> Labour think that by abstaining they will avoid any blame from the destruction lockdowns bring, they can't be more wrong, parliament needs to be punished as a whole, destroy our lives and jobs, you vote take theirs when the time comes.
1333841881252376576 2020-12-02 02:34:20 +0800 <sapgasm> @RhonddaBryant @BorisJohnson Do you realise you lied in this statement? The deaths are not daily and are within 28 days of an alleged positive test.

1328472570698543107 2020-11-17 06:58:37 +0800 <sapgasm> @GavinBarwell It's pretty simple, what the EU is wanting goes against the whole reason for leaving.

How about actually saying how insane it would be for us to be under the eu's control after leaving, as it would have all been pointless.

1324075105891340291 2020-11-05 03:44:40 +0800 <sapgasm> Reason why trump has struggled this election is because of the targeted campaign for the youth vote, we all know academics push the lefts agenda just like here in the UK, sooner or later tories will make the same mistake then they'll never see power again.
1324072792590065665 2020-11-05 03:35:28 +0800 <sapgasm> . @realDonaldTrump I like you man pure energy but bow out gracefully, 4 years of Biden will be enough to even change some minds of his die hard fans when they start to suffer.
1324067590755549186 2020-11-05 03:14:48 +0800 <sapgasm> America will riot

1323905219298811905 2020-11-04 16:29:35 +0800 <sapgasm> Anyone else thinking trump might have this snatched away?
1323882626940358658 2020-11-04 14:59:49 +0800 <sapgasm> This what the tories should have aimed for
1323866902112870400 2020-11-04 13:57:20 +0800 <sapgasm> If @realDonaldTrump wins again he needs to go after social media bias like a raging bull, especially twitter with the bs out keeps pulling.

I'd rather a labour term than a conservative party who don't conserve

He doesn't need the attention he knows what's needed is a party for the silent majority as both 2 main parties have lost sight of voters.

Honestly this is why you aren't taken seriously, you really need to get your obsession over brexit seen by a mental health professional.

1316112738242961412 2020-10-14 04:25:03 +0800 <sapgasm> Dear @piersmorgan please answer me this. If we lockdown again for 2 weeks, then 4 weeks after cases rise again, what's next? Millions of us are hanging on to our jobs by a fingernail, people are dying from other illness, mental health through the roof, you've tunnel vision.
1316111525086662657 2020-10-14 04:20:14 +0800 <sapgasm> @paulwaugh It's not an alternative, wasn't his plan and also  it's horrendous for the population and economy.
1316110755712958464 2020-10-14 04:17:10 +0800 <sapgasm> @piersmorgan 6) GMB failed to have a respectful and reasonable debate with Ministers, instead of constant barrage of abuse and interruptions.

1316088097130655744 2020-10-14 02:47:08 +0800 <sapgasm> @piersmorgan The reason people in these polls support restrictions is because they are getting paid to sit at home and don't realise the implications of doing this. Remember when polls showed we were going to remain in the EU and  have prime minister Corbyn........ Look how those turned out.

1316077559797428225 2020-10-14 02:05:16 +0800 <sapgasm> @piersmorgan @Keir_Starmer Sage don't have to weigh up every other issue from their plans, a leader has to weigh up the pros and cons and another lockdown will be a disaster, mentally, physically and horrendous to the economy. Cases will rise again after break ends and we unlock it offers nothing.
1316069632688693248 2020-10-14 01:33:46 +0800 <sapgasm> @piersmorgan Next stage of the epic doom chart that never happened.

1316061150224809986 2020-10-14 01:00:04 +0800 <sapgasm> @lewis_goodall Yeah that they are still unelectable, hate the tories and want to use the situation as a political weapon at the publics cost.
1316057643425976327 2020-10-14 00:46:08 +0800 <sapgasm> Left and media are lapping up Starmer's offer to inflict more damage.
1316056223972831237 2020-10-14 00:40:29 +0800 <sapgasm> @wallaceme Lunatics trying to force gov into a loose loose situation.
1316055732652060672 2020-10-14 00:38:32 +0800 <sapgasm> @peterkyle @Keir_Starmer @BorisJohnson No, he's wrong, after the break, cases will rise anyway and more economic and mental damage will have happened, even WHO are not warning against lockdowns.
1316050573809025024 2020-10-14 00:18:02 +0800 <sapgasm> @wesstreeting @Keir_Starmer It's a horrendous plan, after break ends and cases rise because they will, then what?
1316050131519766528 2020-10-14 00:16:17 +0800 <sapgasm> @JuliaHB1 @BorisJohnson He will cave in
1316049045807300615 2020-10-14 00:11:58 +0800 <sapgasm> .@BorisJohnson will cave to @Keir_Starmer demand and its the public who will suffer for it, when cases rise again after it ends.  R.I.P more jobs, mental health, freedoms and our lifestyles that are already hindered.

1316045879455907842 2020-10-13 23:59:23 +0800 <sapgasm> @DPJHodges Pretty obvious starmer's aim is to try cause havoc and when a break fails, will use as ammo against the gov come election time because tories, boris ect ect....
1316043056764850176 2020-10-13 23:48:10 +0800 <sapgasm> @tomhfh What they need to ask is cases will rise after the break so what damage will be done by then
1316042629537239041 2020-10-13 23:46:28 +0800 <sapgasm> @DrDomPimenta @GuidoFawkes No it's stupid.
1316042581499936768 2020-10-13 23:46:16 +0800 <sapgasm> @GuidoFawkes Why cases will only rise after the break. Absolutely pointless, he's just trying to force govs hand.
1316041102034599936 2020-10-13 23:40:24 +0800 <sapgasm> @tnewtondunn Nothing to see here, will just be him moaning about the gov but then backing them, regardless.

1316003824440692737 2020-10-13 21:12:16 +0800 <sapgasm> This would see thousands of remainers and the left arrested if given the same treatment, we get called nazi daily.

1315728878061707266 2020-10-13 02:59:44 +0800 <sapgasm> @MattHancock You can't keep us locked down in the hopes of a vaccine that many of us won't take anyway. You are destroying millions of our home and working lifestyles for a virus with a 1% death rate.

1315668756484567040 2020-10-12 23:00:50 +0800 <sapgasm> Someone needs to point blank ask @BorisJohnson on TV / parliament how he thinks he can keep restricting if infection and deaths don't fall, is he willing to really destroy our freedoms and jobs in his quest. This can not continue.
1315666635064311808 2020-10-12 22:52:24 +0800 <sapgasm> . @Keir_Starmer so predictable, lots of moaning, zero ideas or strategies to aid the gov. Yet keeps backing them.

1315558313266941952 2020-10-12 15:41:58 +0800 <sapgasm> @coyleneil You complain and yet labour are backing every move the gov make, we know you want a catastrophe to play party politics come election time and the public is the sacrifice for your goal.
1315552807399890944 2020-10-12 15:20:05 +0800 <sapgasm> @JamesHeartfield For, as they want as much damage for the gov as possible, all ammo come election time, this is their game plan, and the public are a small price to pay for a result.

1304136136856670210 2020-09-11 03:14:19 +0800 <sapgasm> @JohnHealey_MP @UKLabour Interesting seen as you were ignoring those very voices not long ago and suffered a great defeat.
1304133711408041984 2020-09-11 03:04:41 +0800 <sapgasm> @JuanckersGhost You just know courts will rule against the gov, its how they roll.
1304117083861659654 2020-09-11 01:58:36 +0800 <sapgasm> @clynn561 @LabourList @RichardBurgon You still won't see zero covid and you'll destroy millions of jobs and industries in the meantime.
1304112658954809344 2020-09-11 01:41:01 +0800 <sapgasm> @Spud0009 @LabourList @RichardBurgon Correct, herd immunity is the right action to take.
1304111367776067586 2020-09-11 01:35:53 +0800 <sapgasm> Please enlighten us all @RichardBurgon how you will get covid to zero with currently no cure.....

1304106007048716289 2020-09-11 01:14:35 +0800 <sapgasm> @MichelBarnier The problem is you've put trying to control us over actual trade a quest to try show power and superiority, bad faith from day one and yet you've all claimed we are "friends".
1304094915580907520 2020-09-11 00:30:31 +0800 <sapgasm> Boom! üá¨üáß
1304082151965708291 2020-09-10 23:39:48 +0800 <sapgasm> Our friends remember......
1304026428267266048 2020-09-10 19:58:22 +0800 <sapgasm> @Femi_Sorry Do you realise how pathetic you are?
1303806839725920256 2020-09-10 05:25:48 +0800 <sapgasm> They aren't, they are fighting for it, unlike you and your lik. #Delusional
1303801279798534145 2020-09-10 05:03:43 +0800 <sapgasm> She isn't, she's not a friend to her own country either. Just like labour.
1303744943874363404 2020-09-10 01:19:51 +0800 <sapgasm> @calvert_3 @SebastianEPayne Majority is a majority, stop with the excuses.
1303732329723105281 2020-09-10 00:29:44 +0800 <sapgasm> @calvert_3 @SebastianEPayne Its a clear mandate, your denial isn't a good look.
1303731545098932225 2020-09-10 00:26:37 +0800 <sapgasm> True story.....  https://t.co/l0Z3oa2bT3
1303411164156694529 2020-09-09 03:13:32 +0800 <sapgasm> @Femi_Sorry Spent 10 minutes deleting and rewriting a tweet more like.
1303409090882940928 2020-09-09 03:05:18 +0800 <sapgasm> @Markle481 @GuidoFawkes You don't have to be an MP to have power, hence why farage is one of the main reasons we are out of the EU, isn't it fantastic üòâ
1303390735920750595 2020-09-09 01:52:21 +0800 <sapgasm> What a lunatic
1303372438449852417 2020-09-09 00:39:39 +0800 <sapgasm> @coyleneil Remember when labour could be trusted?...... Me neither.
1303371049854263299 2020-09-09 00:34:08 +0800 <sapgasm> @SWso155 @foucalt42 @talkRADIO @Iromg @TiceRichard Probably not but nothing is set in stone and the treaty is irrelevant in my eyes when it was the basis of a deal being made.
1303369453577543682 2020-09-09 00:27:47 +0800 <sapgasm> @Femi_Sorry The desperation is real for femi.

1303366841910341632 2020-09-09 00:17:25 +0800 <sapgasm> @PaulBrandITV @Keir_Starmer The rejoin dream was always dead.
1303365154952839168 2020-09-09 00:10:42 +0800 <sapgasm> @BethRigby @Keir_Starmer @SkyNews Starmer needs to get a grip is clear the EU doesn't want a reasonable deal.
1303361570173587464 2020-09-08 23:56:28 +0800 <sapgasm> Hilarious üòÇ
1303246782189666304 2020-09-08 16:20:20 +0800 <sapgasm> @DanCarter1990 @Nigel_Farage Someone tell Dan treatys can be ended and laws can be changed, he thinks once something is written its set in stone....
1303039500680077317 2020-09-08 02:36:40 +0800 <sapgasm> Nothing to see here... Just another labour mp supporting illegal and damaging activity. How does one cancel a planet? I'd like to try the same with jupiter.
1303035359559811072 2020-09-08 02:20:13 +0800 <sapgasm> Perfectly normal to stab people you like folks üëç
1303032097611943937 2020-09-08 02:07:15 +0800 <sapgasm> We've got to feed other people's children and now pay for broadband? Why not just abolish any parents responsibilities....
1302930317276262401 2020-09-07 19:22:49 +0800 <sapgasm> Remainiacs have always had clouded judgement, if the EU doesn't want a reasonable deal that isn't us submitting to every demand, then the WA is irrelevant.
1302910011723657216 2020-09-07 18:02:08 +0800 <sapgasm> Media still haven't realised its not opponents boris needs to worry about, its us who gave him the power to get the job done, deal or no deal and no delays.
1302902356447764480 2020-09-07 17:31:43 +0800 <sapgasm> @BarrySheerman Like when labour said they would accept the result of a referendum to the electorate and then changed their mind?
