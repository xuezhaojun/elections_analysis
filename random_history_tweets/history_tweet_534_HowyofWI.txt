1343683029101895687 2020-12-29 06:19:33 +0800 <HowyofWI> I saw all of this, but didn't say anything until she got too frustrated with it.  I said: "01:10 is the right timing."  She said: "I did 01:30 and stopped it on time."  I said: "But you stopped it at 00:45."  She looked at me in all seriousness and said:  "That's morning math."
1343683027684229122 2020-12-29 06:19:32 +0800 <HowyofWI> My wife stumbles out of bed early this morning. She puts a frozen Starbucks  in the microwave.  Years of experimentation has shown that 01:10 is the perfect timing.  She hits 01:30 (preset) and stops it at 00.45.  She seems befuddled that it is still hard as a rock.

1343464230847131648 2020-12-28 15:50:07 +0800 <HowyofWI> Why is it that Congress gets to decide when they get pay raises?  A) It should be a referendum in each National Election every 4 years and voted on by their Bosses (the American voters.)Or,  B) It should be the same as Social Security/Federal Cost of Living increases. Or,

Where it says something that you try to like or re-tweet has been deleted, yet it has not?  (If you click on the tweet, refresh that page, then you can like/re-tweet.)  Like some form of passive/aggressive censorship.

1337674748768215041 2020-12-12 16:24:47 +0800 <HowyofWI> Dems always clean up after the wanton excess of the R party.  Makes it a lot harder to make progress, when you have to start behind by spending energy on cleaning up a past mess first.  Wish we would learn not to give these R's the keys to the kingdom, even temporarily.

1337326997903695872 2020-12-11 17:22:57 +0800 <HowyofWI> One thing that still nags at me...  So many of the pro-Trump ads showed stock footage from Russia or satellite states.

1333921076359868416 2020-12-02 07:49:02 +0800 <HowyofWI> I'm still not convinced that this is aimed at Trump.   I have a sinking feeling that it is an attempt to discredit the Press-Elect...  Hard to tell without any specifics...

1333883900687495177 2020-12-02 05:21:18 +0800 <HowyofWI> Depending on how he treats Barr now, maybe we will get some testimony out of Barr when the #TrumpCrimesCommission starts?
1333883899131387911 2020-12-02 05:21:18 +0800 <HowyofWI> Barr will find out shortly that loyalty with Trump is a one way street.  Not what you have done for me, but what have you done for me lately...  Trump is shaking with terror and this puts a major nail in his coffin.

1331026548254765056 2020-11-24 08:07:13 +0800 <HowyofWI> Never did.  Blocked him, too.
1331026401194102785 2020-11-24 08:06:37 +0800 <HowyofWI> @RepKatiePorter  is the (not so secret) weapon!
1331003340046659585 2020-11-24 06:34:59 +0800 <HowyofWI> Breaks my heart. 💔  I lost my younger son (he was 28) in 2012.   A parent should never have to outlive their child.
1331002407376080898 2020-11-24 06:31:17 +0800 <HowyofWI> Hitler's henchmen did not, for the most part, like or respect him. Many were trying to kill him, while following his orders in all things.  Many were playing lip service, secretly plotting to take his place.
1331002406130348035 2020-11-24 06:31:17 +0800 <HowyofWI> I think you have to be really damaged Not to secretly hate him, even as you support him.  There is nothing admirable about him. Raw power could be the only attraction.
1331001757229588480 2020-11-24 06:28:42 +0800 <HowyofWI> I both love and hate zoos.  On the one hand, I love seeing the animals.  On the other, now matter how nice they are, a cage is still a cage.
1331001511388860418 2020-11-24 06:27:43 +0800 <HowyofWI> To them, the new political folks (as I was told when I got there) are just "the flavor of the month."  You ignore that at your peril.  And keep in mind how much damage has been done by the Clown Car administration over the last 4 years...
1331001510398976002 2020-11-24 06:27:43 +0800 <HowyofWI> Biden/Harris have chosen outstanding people to hit the ground running, but the vast majority of staff who actually get stuff done will be Career Civil Servants.  Building trust with them takes time.
1331001509362982914 2020-11-24 06:27:43 +0800 <HowyofWI> A whole new group of people, learning on the job how to run a government as complicated as ours, filled with dedicated Career Civil Servants (who for the most part are really, really good at what they do) takes time to shake out.
1331001508180209664 2020-11-24 06:27:43 +0800 <HowyofWI> One thing to keep in mind:  Manage your expectations.  Biden, having been VP, is probably better equipped than anyone, but the first year and a half of the 1st Clinton Presidential term was VERY rough.  It is NOT a political campaign any more - it is GOVERNING.
1330997396604674051 2020-11-24 06:11:22 +0800 <HowyofWI> At least he is honest (for once).
1330997134104145927 2020-11-24 06:10:20 +0800 <HowyofWI> I was thinking "American Greed" myself...  "Stacy Keach narrates this dissection of the dark side of the American Dream, a survey of how far some people go to become rich, no matter the cost to themselves and those around them...."
1330995771752243200 2020-11-24 06:04:55 +0800 <HowyofWI> Gee, why would he get that impression?  But, when you scrape the bottom of the barrel, you get slime.   And slime oozes, (see photo).

1325592343903342593 2020-11-09 08:13:37 +0800 <HowyofWI> We should place the 540+ separated children with loving temporary host families, rather than have them sit in cages.  But it should be UNPAID, so the families are doing so out of love, not gain.   I would help. How about you?
1325591296736714757 2020-11-09 08:09:28 +0800 <HowyofWI> Wow.   They cannot let that fantasy go, can they?  Love the anti-Semitism in plain sight...

1325382030927007744 2020-11-08 18:17:55 +0800 <HowyofWI> MoscowRonJohnson is one of them!
1325381438678687744 2020-11-08 18:15:34 +0800 <HowyofWI> Should add the line:  "Conveniently located between the Crematorium and Dildo Shop!"
1325380922200436736 2020-11-08 18:13:30 +0800 <HowyofWI> Definitely Not.  Unlike Nixon, the Trump Org's crimes are too extensive and has warped our norms and legal system too much.   They MUST be prosecuted to ensure that this NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN!!!!
1325378261350817793 2020-11-08 18:02:56 +0800 <HowyofWI> And #MoscowMitch. 14% approval and 80% of the vote?

1325374305547530240 2020-11-08 17:47:13 +0800 <HowyofWI> Enjoy the next 2 years, Ron.  Come 2020, you are toast.  #DefeatMoscowRonJohnson2020
1325372092389466112 2020-11-08 17:38:25 +0800 <HowyofWI> Thank you to The People!!
1325371777992765440 2020-11-08 17:37:10 +0800 <HowyofWI> Where is the Bar Association through all of this?  Several of Trump's legal team should have their licenses revoked.
1325370197549719554 2020-11-08 17:30:53 +0800 <HowyofWI> After watching Joe and Kamala speak, I went to bed (instead of dozing on the couch watching the overnight news for once) and slept for almost 6 hours!  First time in 4 years!
1325369771030876160 2020-11-08 17:29:12 +0800 <HowyofWI> Much love and well wishes to @maddow - hope she will be back and COVID-free soon!

1325362943068958720 2020-11-08 17:02:04 +0800 <HowyofWI> I did last night, for the first time in 4 years.
1325362430038433792 2020-11-08 17:00:02 +0800 <HowyofWI> Now, who does the photo remind me of... hmmmmm...
1325362253395324928 2020-11-08 16:59:19 +0800 <HowyofWI> In his personal bank account where it will be "safe."
1325361753258135557 2020-11-08 16:57:20 +0800 <HowyofWI> Four Season Landscaping (other than being conveniently located between a crematorium and a dildo store) was probably the only place in Philly with enough fertilizer stock on-hand to power Rudy's little legal shitshow...

1325350791616606209 2020-11-08 16:13:47 +0800 <HowyofWI> How long before she jumps Jr. for greener pastures?  Leaving him with a wrecked marriage, kids that will grow up despising him, and hopefully no money... and, if the world is fair at all, a prison record...
1325350080082219009 2020-11-08 16:10:57 +0800 <HowyofWI> Important point!  All of it, before and after 2016 needs to be investigated - not for revenge, but to ensure that this never happens again and to restrengthen our Democracy.
1325349674782486531 2020-11-08 16:09:20 +0800 <HowyofWI> Add that to his financial troubles...
1325349465474142208 2020-11-08 16:08:31 +0800 <HowyofWI> Well said!!

1325204406367776768 2020-11-08 06:32:06 +0800 <HowyofWI> I ginned all of these media stories about "how divided this nation is" - like its NEWS!!  The divisions were VERY clear when Trump "won" in 2016 - but the press didn't care then.   Only after Trump blew a divided Nation apart do they recognize it.

1325148093050859525 2020-11-08 02:48:20 +0800 <HowyofWI> When makes me wonder - will there be some sort of Odessa Network for Trumpers?
1325147799021817857 2020-11-08 02:47:09 +0800 <HowyofWI> Back at you, Doc!  Your insightful postings helped keep me sane!

1325133143217758209 2020-11-08 01:48:55 +0800 <HowyofWI> Finally Trump knows how Hillary felt - but in her case it was true.  Trump, however, will not handle it so gracefully...
1325011604786835457 2020-11-07 17:45:58 +0800 <HowyofWI> Love this thread - my favorite "story time" treatment.
1324983215518609410 2020-11-07 15:53:10 +0800 <HowyofWI> At least now we are all going to be able to wake up from this nightmare.  There were times when I feared it would never end...
1324911353396670465 2020-11-07 11:07:36 +0800 <HowyofWI> If he wanted to lose, he would have conceded already.  He is desperate to avoid prison.
1324910090617561088 2020-11-07 11:02:35 +0800 <HowyofWI> I am just surprised that the "blue line" flag isn't against the law...  Definitely violates "flag etiquette" and disrespects Old Glory...

1324712953111785473 2020-11-06 21:59:14 +0800 <HowyofWI> I want the Mueller investigation reopened. I want the insider trading investigations reopened. I want the voting in KY investigated.  Most of all - I want a fair but AGGRESSIVE Attorney General appointed by Biden.  None of this "let it go and heal the Nation" crap.

1324465601675431938 2020-11-06 05:36:21 +0800 <HowyofWI> Polls versus votes with this large of a difference should trigger an investigation by the Feds. (If we had a real DOJ)  I'd also look at Collins and Graham.
1324464758066733056 2020-11-06 05:33:00 +0800 <HowyofWI> Especially since Trump would not have won in 2016 save for the EC...  Dems have been saying this for 4 years. But I guess it is lime #MoscowMitch's rules -  they only apply when it will hurt Dems...

1324330999103315969 2020-11-05 20:41:29 +0800 <HowyofWI> The new DOJ may put a few of the R senators in prison, though...   They have gotten away with a lot of shady stuff since Barr came along...
1324328092064731138 2020-11-05 20:29:56 +0800 <HowyofWI> From prison?
1324326489324736512 2020-11-05 20:23:34 +0800 <HowyofWI> Maria has really gone off the deep end since Trump came along...

1324284096688889856 2020-11-05 17:35:07 +0800 <HowyofWI> Hopefully, all that will be solved by some prison bars.  Unprecedented, but an argument could be made that a convicted ex Potus is not eligible for any of that...

1324206763986558978 2020-11-05 12:27:49 +0800 <HowyofWI> Remember when Dems wanted to contest the suspicious 1-2% Trump wins in several swing states in 2016, and the R's said "you should just accept the results"?
1324157618542305281 2020-11-05 09:12:32 +0800 <HowyofWI> BREAKING: We can defeat Senator Kelly Loeffler. Chip in now to take back the Senate for Democrats.  https://t.co/BpYz77krrS

1324079924689424388 2020-11-05 04:03:48 +0800 <HowyofWI> Thank you, fellow Wisconsinites!!
1323955396806139910 2020-11-04 19:48:59 +0800 <HowyofWI> @WilliamRyan2016 Yep - forgot to add that to Plan B!

1323949972539277313 2020-11-04 19:27:25 +0800 <HowyofWI> The R's have always be better at setting the narrative:  Joe bad for the economy Joe against fracking Joe shut down the country Joe is a socialist  Once out there, you can refute all you want, but it is like being accused of a crime on page 1 and it being corrected on page 60.
1323948387390074881 2020-11-04 19:21:07 +0800 <HowyofWI> Democracy dies in plain sight.
1323947888767082497 2020-11-04 19:19:09 +0800 <HowyofWI> Plan B, since 2) above didn't work:  A)  Invalidate mail-in votes B) Pack the Supreme Court to hand him victory.
1323947887651364865 2020-11-04 19:19:08 +0800 <HowyofWI> I have come to believe that the Cry-Baby-In-Chief's Covid plan all along was:  1) Let the virus run rampant 2) Stop voting by mail 3) Scare Dem's away from the polls with disease 4) Get HIS people to show up and vote, regardless of risk
1323937333859766272 2020-11-04 18:37:12 +0800 <HowyofWI> Even if you ignored the last 5 years - Trump's "speech" last night should embarrass and enrage anyone who voted for him.
1323892710982488064 2020-11-04 15:39:53 +0800 <HowyofWI> @Lady_Star_Gem Might as well go for 3!

1323596135714402305 2020-11-03 20:01:24 +0800 <HowyofWI> @bblock29 @Laura_Rachelle_ @ProjectLincoln They taught us Dems how not to bring a knife to a gunfight, and how not to snatch Defeat from the jaws of Victory!  I will be forever grateful.   Hopefully, this same team can reconstitute the R party into a thoughtful, reasonable conservative counterpoint.  The balance is good.

1322073593346445312 2020-10-30 15:11:22 +0800 <HowyofWI> Just watched "The Family Business: Trump and Taxes" on  @Showtime   Half-hour documentary about the team at the NYT who delved into the money laundering of Fred Trump's cash to Trump and his family - avoiding gift and inheritance taxes.  And that was just the beginning.  Wow.

1321790631837159435 2020-10-29 20:26:58 +0800 <HowyofWI> Though to be fair, the whole GOP sucks all on its own...

1321788669762699264 2020-10-29 20:19:11 +0800 <HowyofWI> I'll admit that I enjoy shooting - at paper targets.  The need to kill other living, feeling, thinking beings for "sport" is something I will never understand.   It is a form of psychopathy - just a step away from killing other humans.

1302796365899149312 2020-09-07 10:30:33 +0800 <HowyofWI> 4) Review International trade agreements for fairness and simplicity. A shipment from Europe to U.S. sails right through, with little or no paperwork. For us to send a package to Europe, it is bogged down in customs fees and other charges and endless paperwork. Why?
1302796364896755714 2020-09-07 10:30:32 +0800 <HowyofWI> Right now, they are not allowed to compete.  2) Take away the retirement pre-funding mandate - no other agency or company is required to do so.  3) Stop raiding USPS' cash in good times. Congress should  not be allowed to do so.
1302796363802054656 2020-09-07 10:30:32 +0800 <HowyofWI> If we get a Dem President and a Dem majority in Congress, we should improve @USPS , not destroy it.  If we want to help small businesses export, we need to make package delivery easier, faster, and cheaper.  1) Let USPS compete with with FedEx, UPS, DHL.
