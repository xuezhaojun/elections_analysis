Nothing has been done except protections for corporations, military Industrial funds and chipping away at free speech.  You are a failure.  I don't care how much effort you have expended.

1344006804603240448 2020-12-30 03:46:07 +0800 <artramp> I hope it is abundantly clear as evidenced by the complete failure of the govt to take care of the citizens during crisis, opting to fund war and profiteers with our tax money... That we no longer have a functional government.  I don't care whose fault you think it is.

1343630682866634752 2020-12-29 02:51:32 +0800 <artramp> Holidays are often times a trigger for vulnerable families, there is an increase in the need for beds every year.  Incidents of DV have increased since covid, employment has been irregular, and schools are closed. (don't open schools to combat DV, do work on better shelter).
1343628998186659841 2020-12-29 02:44:51 +0800 <artramp> I have been on both sides of the desk.

You can make all the "right" choices and still end up on the client side of the desk.

1342319020364627968 2020-12-25 11:59:28 +0800 <artramp> we discussed it and decided to celebrate soltice instead.

Solutions are hard to invent and harder to implement  But in the end, choice is an illusion and the only thing we can really do is practice trying, with compassion- with a caveat strict boundaries/ zero tolerance abuse
1341980838963998722 2020-12-24 13:35:39 +0800 <artramp> @caitoz Would be er asking that it is the fault of the system that consumerism and working 90 hrs a week is the problem, do blame the women.  And vice versa.   They were trained that way, and so we're we. It's not their fault they were raised in a hellscape but not allowed to feel.
1341980361983606784 2020-12-24 13:33:45 +0800 <artramp> @caitoz Our gen of men was taught a model for success that is a complete failure.  They didn't fail because of lack of hard work but because the code is bad. The protocol is faulty because capitalism is designed to make everyone buy more shit and be a better consumer.  But money masters
1341979457179947008 2020-12-24 13:30:10 +0800 <artramp> @caitoz How can we actually fight that?  It's almost contraintuitive, but the only way to do it is expand the definition of what "success" means, and teach next generations not to base masculinity in winning competitions but in winning cooperations  I don't think we can fix our gen
1341978043456229378 2020-12-24 13:24:32 +0800 <artramp> @caitoz We are already equal before the theater of negotiations started.  Not treated equally, obviously but just in the sense that it is something owed or deserved.  My mom's ancestors were matriarchal, my fa mysoginist.  If a woman disagrees it is a threat and display of disrespect
1341976900814553088 2020-12-24 13:20:00 +0800 <artramp> @caitoz I don't think we had much choice in the matter.  They said "oh yeah? You wanna be equal? Well when you can do what I do all day, then we might consider it."  So we all went I can do it AND the laundry!!  But somehow the maths got broken.  Our demands were lost in translation.
1341975814968000513 2020-12-24 13:15:41 +0800 <artramp> In a time when the whole world is crashing down and making kids feel traumatized, find ways to help them feel supported and nurtured.

When capital is not the motive of production, the entire understanding of economics must shift.  Example: How many shirts does a company need to make in order to sell ONE?

1339373666606301184 2020-12-17 08:55:41 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 You too. Be well.  It's not just me having a personal issue, it is millions with no voice. I'm just doing my best to educate because nobody knows these facts.
1339373364184379395 2020-12-17 08:54:29 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 Housing cog takes up to 8 years to climb a list, some lists are closed except for random lotteries which homeless ppl are not alerted to by any system. They have to check every week.   Emergency shelter grants 90 days, transitional housing grants 6 months.
1339372727853957121 2020-12-17 08:51:57 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 Yes. War monies should be reallocated to take care of our own most vulnerable.  I actually feel lucky in comparison to some of the ppl who are going through this maze
1339372429492162560 2020-12-17 08:50:46 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 You can get extended but have to prove circumstances by obtaining doctor reports and quarterly recertification. Most doctors have a fear that they will be labeled as fraudulent and abhor signing these reports. Often refuse to do so.
1339371863160442880 2020-12-17 08:48:31 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 Also, dshs requires that you apply for both ssi an ssdi in order to get welfare benefits during the wait time, but only allows for 60 months lifetime benefits, 5y short of the wait. During which you have to comply with medicaid doctors, which are much different than your VA bens
1339370066794536962 2020-12-17 08:41:22 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 But over the last 20 years they replaced all the fed adjudicators (judges) who systematically deny ssdi.  All the ss lawyers closed offices. I know bc I watched it happen during my application process, and those of the ppl I met during my time at shelters.
1339369392585334784 2020-12-17 08:38:42 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 Yes
1339369333588312065 2020-12-17 08:38:28 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 extreme suffering with no support while they wait for the term to end so they can receive ssi instead of ssdi.  I know most ppl really don't know unless they have been there or witnessed it -such as social workers and shelter advocates.
1339368484501741568 2020-12-17 08:35:05 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 Yes, they are threatening to cut ss rt now.  Most urgently ssdi which is insurance from employer.  But the courts have already cancelled this by rubber stamping disability denials while waiting for the 10 year time requirement since last employment, causing suffering ppl 10y of
1339367826675486721 2020-12-17 08:32:28 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 This happens to ss retirement as well, when income is fixed and the accumulation of pay determined by previous income is low and there are no other retirement benefits or savings.
1339367360457674752 2020-12-17 08:30:37 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 As a ward of the state a disabled person loses their self determinism and no longer has the right to choose their doctor, medical treatment, housing etc.
1339366967384281090 2020-12-17 08:29:03 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 ,which is a full time job. There is no one stop shopping. No free rent, electricity, transportation, medical etc. Each resource has to be collected indi which is impossible for a pp who is designated as disabled. P are required to become ward of state in order to get needs met.
1339366311806189569 2020-12-17 08:26:27 +0800 <artramp> @LeeFeller1 Ssi is $783/ month which is a punitive economy.  Have you lived or raised a family on a welfare budget?  1)if all the cops worked properly, it might be different but they don't.  2) if you are considered disabled to work, you are still required to coordinate all of the agencies
1339365610241716224 2020-12-17 08:23:40 +0800 <artramp> Unfortunately, the state has prerequisites for dispensing those securities which leaves a significant demograph vulnerable, homeless, abused.  It is useful because it provides terror factor for the ppl who are obedient to the state, fearing this vulnerable status enough to comply
1339364013512085505 2020-12-17 08:17:19 +0800 <artramp> @TheMarieFonseca I saw that. ‚ù§Ô∏è
1339363929496031232 2020-12-17 08:16:59 +0800 <artramp> It is the actual social security whereas the SS from the state is a punitive and humiliating resource. They are in direct competition, so mutual aid has to be stopped or the fires will burn.  It is almost impossible to fight the system if you are dependent on it for survival.
1339363927801524226 2020-12-17 08:16:59 +0800 <artramp> The reason that the state tries to crush mutual aide is because it threatens the state.  Mutual aid is literally the org that is growing parallel as we wait for capitalism to eat itself and will be the only org that has potential to support hand after the fall.

And of course, imo the divinity of kings is a grift.  Which is not to say that mythologies are also inherently a grift- but are succeptable to being used as a tool of mass manipulation.

1338252923239768066 2020-12-14 06:42:15 +0800 <artramp> @bigneon_glitter The sovereignty is both supported by and manipulated by the merchant class, persuaded into economic military actions to support more accumulation and hording of resources to support both.    But we are calling it "democracy" and "free market"   Citizens are not represented.

1336027934188994560 2020-12-08 03:20:56 +0800 <artramp> @brettachapman @UvKLvr47 It's like Bayer buying Monsanto and claiming they have no legal responsibility for the crimes of Monsanto.

Succession of European governance (land back) has been successful in other parts of the world but the incorporation of an "independent" nation within the continent is a legal singularity. I find it problematic.
1336023850706817025 2020-12-08 03:04:42 +0800 <artramp> @brettachapman @UvKLvr47 Because they all refer to the doctrine of discovery as justification.  Hiding behind a distinction of the incorporation of an entity separate from the previous american genocide and the current american genocide assumes acceptance or legal justification if the former.

1330572065833795584 2020-11-23 02:01:15 +0800 <artramp> Yes, both.
1330565850844205057 2020-11-23 01:36:34 +0800 <artramp> Towels, sheets and blankets were always walking out the door so those are also awesome donations.  Tissues are great during the fall and winter.  Right now many shelters are running Xmas angel drives so kids can have pressies. Check your local. Must be unused bc of covid.
1330564614581485569 2020-11-23 01:31:39 +0800 <artramp> Usually, shelters have closets full of hygiene products because ppl who donate make assumptions about homeless ppl being unwashed, which is a disgusting myth. IDK how it is rt now with covid, so ask shelters for their needs list.  Certain sizes of diapers are also low in supply.
1330564064368492548 2020-11-23 01:29:28 +0800 <artramp> But women do need it, especially escaping DV and seeking employment- so buy it new please.

1330564062397120513 2020-11-23 01:29:27 +0800 <artramp> I have been homeless, lived in emergency shelters and transitional housing.  Womens shelters do need underwear, but some ppl find it humiliating to wear someone else's old socks and underwear.  I personally don't feel that way.  Used make-up is also not appropriate to donate.
1330562023743127552 2020-11-23 01:21:21 +0800 <artramp> PRO TIP:  DO NOT DONATE USED UNDERWEAR TO MUTUAL AID OR UNHOUSED.  Sell it on fetish sites and use the money to buy new underwear for mutual aid and unhoused.  üòù

If it was rebranded and sold as another type of device, I would agree with you.  It could also be used as a pastry decorator with frosting.

1330017437383737344 2020-11-21 13:17:22 +0800 <artramp> Homelessness is a crime in the US  The US causes homelessness by instituting capitalism which demands a poverty class.  This is manufactured crime.  Prisoners are forced into labor.  This is the newest legal form of slavery.

Employers don't want ubi because they would then be required by competition to have a safe and healthy work environment with benefits.
1329966665468059648 2020-11-21 09:55:37 +0800 <artramp> Doing nothing is actually really painful, which you would know if you had any experience with chronic illness.  -bored out of your brains.  Lazy human is a faulty argument against UBI.  The result would more likely be higher productivity in the field chosen by said lazy human.

I have met some awful ppl who use it as a shield for awful behavior, disguised as tough love.  Results are dangerous, like when kids end up in foster care because of power and control issues.  Happens mostly in unpaid volunteer work.
1329961025559429121 2020-11-21 09:33:12 +0800 <artramp> @RandomPodPerson @VivetVeritate I have been on both sides of that equation.    It really depends on whether the "giver" is sin washing or compelled- such as teaching or social work.  There are so many archetypes who choose altruistic endeavors, each for different reasons with different outcomes.
1329960411169386496 2020-11-21 09:30:46 +0800 <artramp> @RandomPodPerson @VivetVeritate There is little or no social reward for doing the right thing especially if it is contrary to political gain.

Before that, there was at least a modicum of morality and minimum of liability  But it has always been the tool of oligarchs &amp; patriarchs

1326420705492262921 2020-11-11 15:05:14 +0800 <artramp> @ECroydon When I lived in CA with a foster couple, every single child was black or brown, their parents in jail.  Same as the women's shelter.  All the kids went to white affluent homes.
1326420383906541569 2020-11-11 15:03:57 +0800 <artramp> @ECroydon H was adopted I to a uber british colonist church of england abuser who said she was filthy but there was a rider that she was only supposed to be placed in another native home.
1326419654785576960 2020-11-11 15:01:04 +0800 <artramp> @ECroydon I'll wait for more diverse feedback before making any difinitive conclusions   Most of my friendships are parachute or drive-by because I am literally a shut-in so I understand that as well.
1326418932673155073 2020-11-11 14:58:11 +0800 <artramp> @ECroydon I do, that's why we are chatting.  I have mixed feelings about it.  But I was brave and opened my face hole.  I definitely agree with everything you related, but I also have this sinking feeling about tokenization, writing ppl the way they should have been treated.  IDK.
1326418049357012993 2020-11-11 14:54:41 +0800 <artramp> @lilfae2 The WA state sos numbers were objectively ridiculous.  But so was the primary count.  "Who cheats best" is the literal election protocol we have somehow adopted.
1326417597794017281 2020-11-11 14:52:53 +0800 <artramp> @ECroydon Yes. But I think it was much much worse.  I am snowcahontess, pass as white.  But the stories I heard from my family and friends about first nations schools and foster care and illegal adoptions are so much more abusive. Again, very cynical. Also lived in Oklahoma for a year.
1326415493461401600 2020-11-11 14:44:31 +0800 <artramp> @ECroydon I would LOV3 it if it was really true.  Maybe I am just too cynical.
1326415328780439554 2020-11-11 14:43:52 +0800 <artramp> @ECroydon I think the strong black girlfriend iconography is lazy.    The writing of her character was lazy because she was only around when protagonist was in need of major scaffolding.  Also, mythological considering it was the 60's  Ugh tokenization that makes wypipo forgive themselves

1326399948884205569 2020-11-11 13:42:45 +0800 <artramp> I think fraternal orders can run 501c3 4 and even hold sp corps and b corps.

1325705489527631873 2020-11-09 15:43:13 +0800 <artramp> Example  It is extremely stressfully living in public housing because I could lose it, on a whim... because of any reason disguised as a lease violation.  It is very quiet here, no social gatherings ever happen. Neighbors always on high alert.
1325704679980818433 2020-11-09 15:40:00 +0800 <artramp> The reason mutual aid is so powerful is because we have a huge demography of people dependent on the state to survive... Disability as example  If we find ways to support the vulnerable, we are no longer vulnerable... We are empowered and don't fear retaliatory threat of survival

1325384813226815489 2020-11-08 18:28:58 +0800 <artramp> Now we see the violence inherent int the system   https://t.co/fls2Zgtqm4

1325265535299248128 2020-11-08 10:35:00 +0800 <artramp> Glad your guy had better fraud than the other team's fraud this year,  Nothing changing for the most vulnerable, still tragic pain and suffering.... No time to be dancing over a razor thin margin, do the work now that you have time to breathe...

1325262582639288320 2020-11-08 10:23:16 +0800 <artramp> I mean, rather than automatically and systematically rejecting their platform and words have you ever done the work to discover why?
1325262270578917376 2020-11-08 10:22:02 +0800 <artramp> Have to ever done nvc with a gop?  Ask yourself this....  What needs are not getting met which create incentives for ppl to vote republican?

1325223507744075776 2020-11-08 07:48:00 +0800 <artramp> Please allow yourself to be very happy trump is being ousted, that's a win... Sort of...  But don't for a second think anybody "won".  Unless you think we won a lot of work...  Fighting both wings...
1325217838886367232 2020-11-08 07:25:28 +0800 <artramp> @RobinADupuis @Terrilltf When is the right time?
1325208995582205954 2020-11-08 06:50:20 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya Rather than divide ourselves by definitions created to divide us.
1325208881711124481 2020-11-08 06:49:53 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya It's a little bit pointless to identify with such antiquated ideologies and archetypes that were written by who? In the time of what? When information is being shared at the speed of light.  It's time for a language that makes us allies,a community of resources
1325206146865483776 2020-11-08 06:39:01 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya But I would have just pulled the branch to the side of the road.  Libertarians don't want to pay for the excessive beurocratic ridiculous of calling firefighters and a gaggle of cops to a fallen tree branch.  Which is a legit complaint. But how to liberts take care of the branch?
1325205364204212224 2020-11-08 06:35:54 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya As it is now, if a branch falls on the arboretum road, five cop cars are dispatched to redirect traffic for 6 hours while we wait for dot to show up with their union and 12 ppl cut it up and away...  Which is why libertarians are annoyed bc resources should be precious.
1325204284791615489 2020-11-08 06:31:37 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya So the difinitive argument is this...  Libertarians don't want to pay to fix the pothole, anarchists find a shovel.
1325203983586091010 2020-11-08 06:30:25 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya At occupy, simultaneously worldwide social media platforms popped up, supporting and promoting alternative need and publications.  Autonomously -bc no leader said it should be done or organized groups, they each organized themselves.
1325202379839451139 2020-11-08 06:24:03 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya But there is a significant ven between the two which is why Bernie could attract some folks from libertarian and why he has such a broad following.
1325202092949086212 2020-11-08 06:22:54 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya So if you are comparing libertarian to anarchist, the difference comes out in the mutual aid.  Lib has no plans for how to do the work they don't feel the need to pay outside their family and community via taxes
1325201638655619074 2020-11-08 06:21:06 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya Because anarchists found needs and addressed them.  ICT teams popped up all over the globe, providing their time knowledge and energy.  They organised themselves, expertise and resources were donated to a commons.
1325201159993262080 2020-11-08 06:19:12 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya The anarchists were all busy showing us how it's done while all the ppl were standing on boxes replying to media about the demands, the theater of general assembly...  Most ppl missed the fact that thousands of ppl swelled in the streets for months... How?
1325200713631236097 2020-11-08 06:17:25 +0800 <artramp> @NicoleNonya It's not as simple as no leadership.  Anarchic societies raise leaders based on their ability to take on a task, then once a task is complete repeat for the next task.  Imagine the ppl who were organizing all of the needs around occupy wall St, feeding, organizing waste etc
1324955131171909632 2020-11-07 14:01:34 +0800 <artramp> As a genx, breaking the glass ceiling is a huge milestone. So congrats KH, you did that. I am proud.  But identity politics is nowhere near something to celebrate bc KH policies cause so much suffering.   Do better.

1324323261258240001 2020-11-05 20:10:44 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly This is exactly what our socialist party is going for, but our voting system precludes the ability for a 3rd party to flourish.  It's a bunch of ridiculous policy requiring a minimum % of voted to qualify for a space on the ballot.  And the voting process itself is fraudulent.

1324319071681179648 2020-11-05 19:54:06 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly Our social security and disability income is punitive poverty.  $783 per month, lower than median rent when landlords require income to be either 200%-300% of rental fees.  Public housing takes years to access while there's literally 5 empty dwellings for each homeless person

1324317048466415616 2020-11-05 19:46:03 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly I personally advocate for that all the time.  It's not up to me, it's up to the able bodies who mostly seem to be mesmerized by the political theater and penalize the revolutionaries, social justice advocates.  Right now it's very exciting though, I hope the passion keeps growing

1324313396305518593 2020-11-05 19:31:32 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly necessary.  We could have direct democracy in our living room if the old money lost its stranglehold on the labor force.
1324313049268854784 2020-11-05 19:30:10 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly Ah.  Most of the socialist movement here is democratic socialism- which supposedly distinguishes itself as power held by people, not by the state.  I don't know within the modern complexity we can still use these terms defined in a time when any kind of representative govt is ...
1324311692440993792 2020-11-05 19:24:46 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly All the "democracy" is theater. Most is for is, some is for the rest of the globe.  Other countries don't need as much idealogical persuasion bc we have such a disgustingly massive military Industrial.  I wish I had any power to apologise for it
1324310408564367366 2020-11-05 19:19:40 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly I agree, but still doesn't answer the question.  This country is a kleptocratic fascist fiefdom dressed up as a democracy.   Trained since birth in exceptionalist mythology.  It is so painful.
1324309513634160645 2020-11-05 19:16:07 +0800 <artramp> Check how they are collecting the data and who they are collecting it from.  Land lines? Geography? Isms? (gender, color, ability,  employment etc)
1324309511637626881 2020-11-05 19:16:06 +0800 <artramp> All the polls showing Bider winning landslide were propaganda and public relations, just like hrc.  You have to read the demography. I learned how they are messing with polls when I looked at cnn primary WA state exit polls.  They skew their data pools by heavy cherry picking.
1324307820498485254 2020-11-05 19:09:23 +0800 <artramp> @pier_elly So, let me rephrase.  What is the "everything" that we have here that makes it so wonderful that we are least socialist?

1324270449895768064 2020-11-05 16:40:53 +0800 <artramp> I am so confused.
1324270008990461952 2020-11-05 16:39:08 +0800 <artramp> Obviously,
1324269313348362245 2020-11-05 16:36:22 +0800 <artramp> So, now we have to VASTLY improve recovery programs in order for this to be an effective pilot program we can use to reference and support...
1324268022274535425 2020-11-05 16:31:14 +0800 <artramp> President Karen?  Is that you?

1324217294751330304 2020-11-05 13:09:40 +0800 <artramp> They must be somewhere arresting blm for standing on a sidewalk.  Federal crimes of election interference don't seem to take precedence over jaywalkers with dangerous words on their signs.
1324216812255371264 2020-11-05 13:07:45 +0800 <artramp> Where are all the cops in riot gear?
1324215557470629888 2020-11-05 13:02:46 +0800 <artramp> @BrianOSheaSPI Exactly.  It is all by design.  So what do we do for/ about the millions of ppl who are disabled by this system... While we are building a new one?  How do we keep our most vulnerable safe?
1324199690225635330 2020-11-05 11:59:43 +0800 <artramp> Om This is getting exciting.
1324199472260239360 2020-11-05 11:58:51 +0800 <artramp> The existence of poor people is depressing.  Why do we need an impoverished class?   Don't you fucking dare point at poor as being responsible for any policy decisions, no less as a perpetrator of even holding the slightest power as a voting bloc.
1324198601686347776 2020-11-05 11:55:23 +0800 <artramp> Those children seem to be the most imminent threat to keeping the peace!!!
1324198156079259649 2020-11-05 11:53:37 +0800 <artramp> The cops are arresting families and children first?  Seems kind of retaliatory and intimidation  I've never seen this before.
1324194660550549505 2020-11-05 11:39:44 +0800 <artramp> What is the difference between "racist" and "comfortable with racist policy"?
1324192206664527879 2020-11-05 11:29:59 +0800 <artramp> @realfrostylady Probably best to take a break anyways
1324191803130589185 2020-11-05 11:28:22 +0800 <artramp> Where are the riot police?
1324191272051990532 2020-11-05 11:26:16 +0800 <artramp> They have a really weird definition of riot.  Is it a gathering of 3 or more people?
1324191098659483648 2020-11-05 11:25:34 +0800 <artramp> Where? I see no riot.
1324190882153656321 2020-11-05 11:24:43 +0800 <artramp> Can I have some demons, I'm bored and want to play.

1324146750173507585 2020-11-05 08:29:21 +0800 <artramp> @FIKC37 Given that the DNC platformed the author of the crime bill, and then turned out to vote for him, I think half may be a low estimate.
1324143325096468480 2020-11-05 08:15:44 +0800 <artramp> Is it only me that thinks that a political party recommending no masks and stop the vote demos might be a platform not for policy but for collecting rcog data about right extremists?  I mean it's rlly obv after abandoning bussed-in supporters to suffer in freezing temps
1324142418443186176 2020-11-05 08:12:08 +0800 <artramp> @CortanaV Better to not use conditioner

1324139101667250176 2020-11-05 07:58:57 +0800 <artramp> They don't want to win, they want better excuses to "fail" to maintain status quo.

1323590234605383681 2020-11-03 19:37:57 +0800 <artramp> @DonSather2 @BethLynch2020 do it.
1323590104120610817 2020-11-03 19:37:26 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon above all, self care.
1323589808371871745 2020-11-03 19:36:16 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon what are your resources, ability and compulsions telling you to do?  make a people's internet  grow hemp  I have no idea.  Only you can figure that out, and don't let anyone tell you you're doing it wrong.
1323589153901080576 2020-11-03 19:33:40 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon there are a lot of tactics, depending on our abilities and resources.  I struggle with this because I am disabled, and must be creative.  information, humor, love, sustainable resources, horticulture that includes medicine.  build infrastructure to survive the fall
1323586036966944768 2020-11-03 19:21:16 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon I have never seen a good defense against this. so many ppl have their identities and self worth/ value, ID tied up in the rewards system, recognition... which is one reason ppl are infighting so much.  NVC communication is helpful but v difficult as common practice.
1323585212802981888 2020-11-03 19:18:00 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon a stamped signed piece pf paper does not make anyone qualified or educated.  It means you learned how to make a prof satisfied.  real wisdom and education is learning how to learn.
1323584613726343170 2020-11-03 19:15:37 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon so they have a really effective protocol to break up dissent.  mostly it is divide and conquer, stimulate infighting.  See BIA/ AIM/ Leonard Pelltier/ Anna Mae Pictou  and then threatening violence and blacklisting, impoverishing the mutual aid etc
1323583912266772480 2020-11-03 19:12:50 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon and now, they are the leading population of brunching liberals.  completely immune to the truth.  how do we serve a collective awakening to the selfish generation?
1323583413614358528 2020-11-03 19:10:51 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon yeah, boomers dropped the ball.  I remember when brokaw dod the Boomers!, he said dude, you all fucked up.  you dropped the ball.  you became selfish consumers and forgot about changing the world.  of course I am paraphrasing
1323580687216115712 2020-11-03 19:00:01 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon having said that, social services (usian socialism) has done much more to bring self determinism to the impoverished and the erosion of this is terrifying.  it needs to be restored.
1323580069466394630 2020-11-03 18:57:34 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon I do know there was a short period of time after wwII and before regan when it seemed like things were coming up... and it all went downhill after the reganism.  I believe a lot of that was a collective theater that did not include most marginalized.  Not malicious but ignorant.
1323579183969153029 2020-11-03 18:54:03 +0800 <artramp> wetiko programs the human biocomputer to think and behave in self-destructive ways.   ...  an autoimmune disease perversely attacking the very life it is trying to protect.   https://t.co/C1UKcIND2F
1323577775744184320 2020-11-03 18:48:27 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon first nations describe the colonists as having widespread wetiko virus.  It's like an AMA psychological disorder.  Not everyone has it, but we are living in an epidemic.  https://t.co/UkEXbQ5HIM
1323573279395770368 2020-11-03 18:30:35 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon wetiko is the description of a virus resulting in self cannibalism, a species suicide by a thousand cuts and manifesting symptomology of an insatiable greed.  "may you get what you desire" is a curse, not a blessing.
1323572174267969536 2020-11-03 18:26:11 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon of course
1323572090482536450 2020-11-03 18:25:51 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon google "wetiko", there are some good books.
1323571751092068352 2020-11-03 18:24:30 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon I understand.  it can be so overwhelming.

1323569457743106049 2020-11-03 18:15:24 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon lol
1323569378126802944 2020-11-03 18:15:05 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon I pray hardest over our need for information access, that the internet does not become as fucked up and compromised as the msm media.  I mean, we would have to go to the library to learn things again. lol  rip aaron &lt;3
1323568799069609985 2020-11-03 18:12:47 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon for middle class white people, yes.
1323568646208192512 2020-11-03 18:12:10 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon the only thing we can actually do is educate our kids about the education they are receiving.  I told my daughter that the edu is useless, it's the social structure you have to learn how to navigate.  They teach memorization and hierarchy, who deserves a kowtow.
1323568119101546496 2020-11-03 18:10:04 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon naw, it was always this way.  The system is designed to create the underclass desperate.  Longing for a time before it was bad is just grief and mourning fo the time before you realized everything they taught you in school about this country was fiction.
1323566420576251904 2020-11-03 18:03:19 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon I wonder how this will all effect the charter school / privatization issue.
1323565811663998976 2020-11-03 18:00:54 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon yes, it is a huge impact on the most vulnerable, who don't have access to technology, fiber, school breakfast and lunches, after school programs etc.  Daycare shut down, how do we keep employed while the kids are at home?  Is it another reason for CPS to snatch the kids?
1323564842553278471 2020-11-03 17:57:03 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon toilet paper

1323563611235577858 2020-11-03 17:52:10 +0800 <artramp> @ElleArmageddon if the school system requires it, they must also provide the resources for it secret password is McKinney Vento Act
1323544162323456000 2020-11-03 16:34:53 +0800 <artramp> nah, bidin would pardon him he doesn't need to self pardon.

1323530685391478785 2020-11-03 15:41:20 +0800 <artramp> @FriedrichPieter I am in WA, same thing is true here.  Any solid blue state, any solid red state has a bunch of room for 3rd party votes in order gain platform and funding to influence national talking points
1323530272315355136 2020-11-03 15:39:41 +0800 <artramp> @FriedrichPieter right.  3rd parties need the mandatory minimum votes more than the duopoly, to get onto the debate floor in order to redirect and influence the corporotists who set the agenda.

1322876563763851265 2020-11-01 20:22:05 +0800 <artramp> So  Explain how a party is pro forced pregnancies because life is sacred  But also supports "herd immunity" responsible for so many deaths.  They are mutually exclusive in a population growth economy....  Who has the latest covid death demography?

1322814919809527808 2020-11-01 16:17:08 +0800 <artramp> @CosmicTrimtab let me rephrase qnon is a deep cover pied piper psyop exposing the most alt right wing racist nazi scumbags and making them look like complete idiots.  I love qnon.  they are fucking hilarious.
1322814198355689472 2020-11-01 16:14:16 +0800 <artramp> I did not expect that from him.  always lovely to be pleasantly surprised.

1322812571104153601 2020-11-01 16:07:48 +0800 <artramp> has anyone seen this from any news source other than this tweet?  just wondering since it's sensational in a way that it would be covered all day by multiple sources.
1322811213122711552 2020-11-01 16:02:24 +0800 <artramp> wheres my pants  I'm going to walmart and buy a gun
1322809707023589377 2020-11-01 15:56:25 +0800 <artramp> isn't it ironic that the libertarian platform actually erodes the liberty of self determinism, except for the billionaire class which is, in fact, anarchist?  lololol gag
1322795635607658496 2020-11-01 15:00:30 +0800 <artramp> It took 9 years to go from newly disabled unemployed and homeless to USDA housed with ssi income. The stress exacerbated and accelerated my illness.  Now that I am housed, it would still take up to 3 years to change my address.  gotta do better.
1322792611522912256 2020-11-01 14:48:29 +0800 <artramp> I have been thinking about this a lot lately because as inadequate as the system is- it is still a better outcome than the result when I ask my family for assistance.  FIX the HOUSING toggle.  FIX SSI all the local ssi atty offices closed... WHY? because it is broken.
1322791814143766531 2020-11-01 14:45:19 +0800 <artramp> Separating housing, food, ss disability and other cash assistance into different orgs costs more in administration, limits benefit to people and allows huge gaps in accountability- each can blame the other for shortcomings and mistakes.
1322791811669061632 2020-11-01 14:45:18 +0800 <artramp> Since Regan (at least) social services have become more and more institutionalized, restricting the liberties of our most vulnerable populations.  Disabled, DV survivors, abject poor into a position from which there is little hope for improvement.
1322789493129191429 2020-11-01 14:36:06 +0800 <artramp> Expanding services with M4A, UBI, EDU, all forms of socialism that provide individuals with the power to choose- which is in direct conflict with how "socialism" is portrayed in politics.
1322789411357032448 2020-11-01 14:35:46 +0800 <artramp> So even in the current broken ass pathologically underfunded social svs system, I am empowered.
1322788233286098945 2020-11-01 14:31:05 +0800 <artramp> If I ask for help from a mission based org, 501c3 or even my family, I give my power to make choices about my qol. Even as seemingly insignificant as buying food  Privatization requires concessions compromises or allow choices to be made for me. This is a fact, not subjective.
1322785647371776000 2020-11-01 14:20:49 +0800 <artramp> I'm going to hurt your brain for a minute.  socialism provides infrastructure for self determinism.  what?

Otherwise I would have been easier to end the turtle island apartheid or oust an illegal occupations of the "americas"
1322502857547935744 2020-10-31 19:37:06 +0800 <artramp> @EatYourBoss we are in fact an oligarchy, no matter what words they wrote in the founding documents which somehow made it legal to genocide and occupy lands for use of white male "landowners".  The nuance being that rather than continuing to be colonized by the monarchies,
1322499642357997569 2020-10-31 19:24:20 +0800 <artramp> seriously wtf is this
1322498843875844098 2020-10-31 19:21:09 +0800 <artramp> dude even cnn has no reference to the "imminent" cyber attacks having anything to do with russia.  you guys are fucking ridiculous.
1322498086778753025 2020-10-31 19:18:09 +0800 <artramp> I pointed out this security issue to an it friend who went on to open a business dedicated to supplemental securing win10 to hippa regs.  but again, who is actually benefiting from this direct action?
1322498084086050816 2020-10-31 19:18:08 +0800 <artramp> win 10 has never been hippa approved.  so many security issues, this is not about russia and trump.  nothing really is about russia and trump.  BUT microsoft created huge security gaps.   so who really benefits from this story?

Remember how outraged you were when he staged the rt wing event in wa state?  I mean, dur... Giuli's a totally a pedo  Nigeria? Thailand? Nukes? Something?
1319055256345456640 2020-10-22 07:17:34 +0800 <artramp> @Sarah4Justice which is why it is near impossible to come out of poverty, because we have to spend so much time chasing down resources.  Especially difficult for ppl with disabilities.  Thank you, ally, for your time and efforts.  It is appreciated and comes with v little reward.
1319054716383293441 2020-10-22 07:15:25 +0800 <artramp> @Sarah4Justice you can also check to see if there are community resources for your families to get electricity relief, here pse has a program as well as the county.    Survival during poverty is a full time job, locating and collecting resources.  It should be one stop shopping.
1319053960808783873 2020-10-22 07:12:25 +0800 <artramp> @Sarah4Justice the mv has a focus on homelessness  but also has some coverage for poverty.    Also, you prob know this already but there are low income resources for internet, Comcast has a $10-/mo program and sprint's citizens network is about $12- but you have to buy a hotspot.

I think there is still also a 501c3 legal group devoted to the subject.  Pull out your search bar and see what you can find locally. I'm in wa state.
1319049433787478016 2020-10-22 06:54:26 +0800 <artramp> @Sarah4Justice There may be a specialist, sometimes called advocate or liaison.
1319049123677433856 2020-10-22 06:53:12 +0800 <artramp> @Sarah4Justice Usually individual parents have to kickstart and go to a counselor but ultimately the osp makes the determination.  I think its time for folks to get clever.  Start with school counselor to find the next step to access higher level decision makers re "mckinney vento" magic phrase
1319047498535632896 2020-10-22 06:46:45 +0800 <artramp> @Sarah4Justice There isn't language specific to this scenario, but since bussing is not taking the budget, resources should find a way to be utilized so kids can access the tech.
1319046966093905921 2020-10-22 06:44:38 +0800 <artramp> @Sarah4Justice If the school requires something, they are in turn required to provide access to it.  See if mckinney vento act can be utilized for electricity and internet shut-offs during shot down.

Obama was identity politics, he deported and separated indigenous refugees and accelerated the downward spiral of our current state of poverty.

1319011003401596929 2020-10-22 04:21:43 +0800 <artramp> @BlackSocialists @LittleBirdSteph @Katsgoode The issue is that the capitalism keeps us from maintaining the resources needed to create community support mechanisms.  I can sometimes find the scattered in the cities, but in rural ppl are dependent on faith based orgs.   That is why we are extra poor these days.
1319008467613446144 2020-10-22 04:11:39 +0800 <artramp> Treating fiber as a utility would be a huge step forward in getting information and education to the most rural and 3rd world parts if the country, thus upsetting the political landscape.

1307552606911373318 2020-09-20 13:30:09 +0800 <artramp> It's a kind of willful cognitive dissonance.  Most decisions are made in the subconscious, which is full of questionable rogue programs for survival with social programming.  They really believe they are doing the right thing, helping the poors   But they lack basic understanding

You are a miracle  Gaia made this whole place just so we could be loved and know what that means.  That's why the bitternesses of incarnation exist, in compliment to our amazing ability to feel and share all of the compassions.

Did we miss them or are they new?  I feel like I would have noticed

Spikes are cost efficient, even though there's 5 empty dwellings per US homeless individual.

Also maybe direct them towards the radical differences btw "apprehending"  activists v racist shooters

1300664996964171776 2020-09-01 13:21:15 +0800 <artramp> ANTIFA   Is the word Racist pundits use ro redefine anti-racist white activists  In order to fear monger terrorize bougie USians into complying with their voting narrative.  Basically they are allowing the DNC to get away with a candidate purchased by one infantile billionaire
