1344062412543016960 2020-12-30 07:27:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg @SeanLangille That's blocking the vote.  It's not allowing the vote to take place.
1344061425245831168 2020-12-30 07:23:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SeanLangille Why are we getting conflicting information? They said Mitch McCowardonnely was blocking the same bill just an hour ago.
1344060235686678528 2020-12-30 07:18:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @michellemalkin More people need to do this.  Not just 1 person but groups of shoppers should resist these mask mandates.  Masks don't stop a virus.  Masks do cause health issues because of bacteria while breathing their own carbon dioxide instead of oxygen. Can learn this from 7th grade science

His pension needs to be seized and his finances need to be investigated.  His wife needs to be investigated regarding financial ties to Communist China.   No Pension!

1344036059655462912 2020-12-30 05:42:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump WHY CAN'T REPUBLICANS HAVE AN EMERGENCY MEETING AND REMOVE @senatemajldr As leader due to gross incompetence and insanity?   McCownnell cannot be allowed to go against the will of everyone.

1343990250796826626 2020-12-30 02:40:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @senatemajldr  Mitch McConnell you need to step down TODAY as leader.  @gop @GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump   GOP needs to have emergency meeting and fire Mitch McConnell today for Gross incompetence and insanity.  McConnell making GOP look BAD!
1343989601879220224 2020-12-30 02:37:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @senatemajldr   Mitch McConnell, If anything good comes out of your cruelty it will be that you have made yourself look like a monster and when you declared illegitimate Joe Biden as President Elect that now means nothing because you have lost your mind and you sold out to china.
1343988981390663680 2020-12-30 02:35:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @funnygirlmimi @senatemajldr When is his term up?  Why can't rest of @GOP @realDonaldTrump  hold an emergency session and declare Mitch McConnell incompetent and insane and replace him today?
1343988690867998721 2020-12-30 02:34:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jim_Jordan @sea5 And Mitch McConnell supports this Tyranny while at the same time refusing to pass Stimulus check Bill today.    @senatemajldr  GOP needs to have an emergency meeting and fire Mitch McConnell on grounds of his insanity.  @realDonaldTrump

1343984963905961984 2020-12-30 02:19:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Time to invoke the insurrection act in order to ensure a fraudulent Biden is not sworn in as President, otherwise there will be chaos in this country.   It is your duty to defend constitution.  PA is just one example of treason.

She kept blocking it so many times President Trump asked them to send a stand alone bill for $1200.00 and she blocked that.  She blocked a 2.1 Trillion bill right before that because she wanted millions to go to her sponsors

1343682124356861954 2020-12-29 06:15:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You need to invoke the Insurrection act.  PA, MI, AZ, WI, GA, NV,  All these states committed massive Fraud and there is Proof.  Just tweeting and depending on Corrupt Republicans to fix this on Jan 6 is futile.

They will lose their Republican seats and hopefully they won't be able to pay their mortgage.  They deserve to be homeless.

1343154478422224896 2020-12-27 19:19:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq Jenna doesn't want the President to use his constitutional power because she wants to drag this out and she wants the President to lose so she can as she said "continue the legal fight" even after Biden is sworn in.  She wants that check to keep coming!
1343153680279728128 2020-12-27 19:16:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump He needs to do more than tweet and wait and see what happens on January 6th.  If this is his plan it will be too late.
1343152839107874818 2020-12-27 19:12:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump Why is his Attorney Jenna Ellis discouraging him from invoking the insurrection act?  I don't know!  Sounds like he's just giving up. What do you think?  He has the power to stop this Tyranny.
1343152464887832581 2020-12-27 19:11:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq Force an outcome?  Are you saying you don't think fraudulent ballots should be tossed?  What are you saying jenna?  Are you working for the Democrat Party?  The Republicans did not hide ballots under tables, use machines to rig votes, ballot dumps on and on.  Democrats did it.

1341310134463578115 2020-12-22 17:10:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GWonkus @JennaEllisEsq They are illegally withholding evidence.  That alone requires Insurrection act to impound the evidence the crooked judges refuse to release.
1341309381363728384 2020-12-22 17:07:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @goptraci @JennaEllisEsq Americans should revolt.
1341309306327556099 2020-12-22 17:07:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JenSpringrose @JennaEllisEsq @POTUS @realDonaldTrump   Invoke the insurrection act.  Your attorneys and advisers are misinforming you.   Our country is on life support right now sir.
1341308169826435074 2020-12-22 17:02:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq Military stepping in to stop a violation of our constitutional right to have free elections is not manipulating the constitution.   Military needs to step in.
1341307797296672774 2020-12-22 17:01:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq Military defending the United States Constitution is constitutional.  You don't have to be a lawyer to understand that.
1341307093341462528 2020-12-22 16:58:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq Military took an oath to defend the Constitution.
1341303591043096578 2020-12-22 16:44:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq @karakirtley Not a constitutional option?  Really?  Where does it say that?  Our Military cannot supervise election audits or impound machines to investigate for fraud when an illegal unconstitutional election took place?  Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

1341302323281182720 2020-12-22 16:39:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @JennaEllisEsq @realDonaldTrump @MichaelDeLauzon @realDonaldTrump   President Trump you need new advisers!!  Find new advisers quickly!  Ones who are not cowardly.  Your attorneys should not be removing options from the table.  They are doing this out of fear.  They are cowering.  No Attorney should announce removing options
1341300485551050752 2020-12-22 16:32:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq @TheRightMelissa We need our Military to step in and stop this.  Unless you think Biden won?  Aren't you his attorney?

1341299608006262784 2020-12-22 16:28:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq @TheRightMelissa So you're advising our President not to use his power to save us from Communist takeover.  You know our elections were stolen so why would you advise such weakness?
1341299350106882050 2020-12-22 16:27:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq @TheRightMelissa The United States Military defending our Constitution and our freedom to vote is not fighting dirty.  I'm surprised a lawyer would not know this.  It is the duty of our military to protect our freedom, constitution.  Our elections must be free and honest.
1341298557148516355 2020-12-22 16:24:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @JennaEllisEsq @realDonaldTrump I knew this was going to happen.  I saw it coming.

Does Jenna Ellis think Corrupt Judges should be communist activist and rule for their party?    Was the Civil war illegal?
1341297915487113216 2020-12-22 16:21:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @JennaEllisEsq @realDonaldTrump Why would our President rule out the insurrection out?  Is Jenna Ellis giving our President weak advice.  What is wrong with the military defending our constitution?
1341296726615855105 2020-12-22 16:17:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> Judges who ruled in favor of Fraud need to all be impeached and American Citizens need to rise up and sue the MEDIA

He needs to declare martial law that's what he needs to do.  If this Coup Fraud succeeds Republican party is over and your job will be gone!
1341157366763380739 2020-12-22 07:03:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump The corrupt Judges are paid off by China.  We have overwhelming PROOF of Fraud! Please get the military involved.   Our Elections were stolen and we need to redo the election without cheating.  We have been nice long enough.  Our country and constitution are in danger.
1341142500023529472 2020-12-22 06:04:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump These Judges are traitors going against law.  They all need to be impeached, including those on the US Supreme Court.   Just disgusting!
1341140756895916032 2020-12-22 05:57:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton When the Fraud Election is allowed to succeed, China will work with our Communist leaders on guidelines and recommendations on how to form a more perfect Communist Union with China.

She refused it.  She then refused a stand alone bill for $1200.00.  Stop spreading your misinformation on Twitter.

1341102957299867651 2020-12-22 03:27:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @badevilperson @MajorPatriot That's a lie.  Republicans agreed on a much bigger bill several weeks ago but she refused.  Then President Trump offered a $1200.00 stand alone bill just for a stimulus check and she refused.   Nancy Pelosi is to blame for giving less Be truthful and stick to facts.
1341096266336403456 2020-12-22 03:00:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Military needs to get involved and stop this fraud.  Redo the elections.  American people are being cheated.

1340955576981864448 2020-12-21 17:41:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> So what happens to the American Citizen if the Communist Democrats succeed at stealing this election with the help of Communist China?  Mandatory masks Mandatory vaccines Schools closed indefinitely.  Small business permanently closed. Forced abortions  Going to church illegal  ?
1340954564501991425 2020-12-21 17:37:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jessiprincey @realDonaldTrump US Supreme Court is worthless!  Refusing to hear and see this evidence shows they are compromised.  All of them!
1340952771495747584 2020-12-21 17:30:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ruggiere_l So we know Kamala is a communist. She tweeted her support for Communism.  We know Joe Biden is a tool of China and he is compromised by China.  So if they force Americans into Communism does the Military defend our Constitution or do they just toss it in the trash?
1340951637410471936 2020-12-21 17:25:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you were President of the United States and you had overwhelming proof of Massive Election Fraud with the help of Communist China as we do today what would you do?  If you would take all 4 actions as Presdent please respond to tweet with "All 4"

He could have had the military impound   machines but he said no marital law.  Not sure why he felt he had to tweet that.
1340947473448112128 2020-12-21 17:09:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ruggiere_l @Tim_Poole_ I don't hear any Generals in our Military speaking out against Communist China stealing our elections,    our votes stolen.  I use to think the Military defended our Constitution.   Will they embrace communism on our shores? @USArmy @USNavy @USMARCENT @usairforce @uscoastguard
1340945584207753217 2020-12-21 17:01:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Dave_Benson @majortom1a President could have and should have had those machines impounded.  He could have done this by ordering the military but I guess he was worried what the media would say.  So there goes the country.

I hope they pack the court with an additional 10 or 15 Judges. The more the merrier. Make them irrelevant.   They've allowed country to be stolen.
1340935474240602114 2020-12-21 16:21:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @evilkracker @CrunchyDoughnu1 They are Cowards and Liars.  They said they loved our Constitution and they would uphold it and they refused out of their Cowardice.
1340933742806794243 2020-12-21 16:14:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @brianhusted5 It can't be any worse.  The Supreme Court has already destroyed America.  Our country is gone because of them.  Pack the court.
1340883555946119168 2020-12-21 12:55:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Is President Trump going to use all the Power God gave him to fight this Coup?  He tweeted that martial law is fake news.  So he won't use our military to defend our Constitution?  Can we trust congress on jan 6?  I don't trust Congress.
1340878620227616768 2020-12-21 12:35:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Americans will lose their 2nd amendment within 1 year.

1340878125970800641 2020-12-21 12:33:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> The left committed massive election fraud with the help of communist China.    They are planning on using our military against us.  Our own Military Generals are quiet while the steal is going on because they are in on it.   Our Constitution is gone.    Supreme Court treasonous!
1340877556011081728 2020-12-21 12:31:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi You refused a $1200.00 stand alone stimulus Bill several weeks ago.  You had a hissy fit because it did not give money to your donors.  It was a 1.2 Trillion dollar bill.    You Pelosi are to blame for Americans losing their homes and children going hungry.
1340868539029209089 2020-12-21 11:55:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HeliJoc @GeorgePapa19 They are throwing us a bone!
1340865418534084608 2020-12-21 11:43:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> The United States Supreme Court is WORTHLESS.   If they allow this fraud election to succeed please do not defend them when the Communist Democrat Left packs the court.    When we really needed them they were not there. They are now irrelevant.

1340851229014990848 2020-12-21 10:46:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Time for President Trump to be bold and brave and not worry about "WHAT THEY THINK". SAVE USA
1340802094802948096 2020-12-21 07:31:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto It's not possible.  Communist China is going to have control over the Biggest, strongest Military in the world if we allow this election to be stolen.  This is a coup!
1340801833325891584 2020-12-21 07:30:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump Do American realize what will happen to all of us if this fraud Coup succeeds and communist China takes control of our Military?  Do Americans realize we are on the brink of the biggest Tyranny the world will ever see?
1340801282223718400 2020-12-21 07:28:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PhilipPower13 So we just wait until Jan 6 and that's it?  We trust congress?

1340798942976516098 2020-12-21 07:19:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @liquidlaugh Which gives you an idea why we can't trust Congress to do the right thing on January 6th.
1340798494638964738 2020-12-21 07:17:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PhilipPower13 He already tweeted that "martial law" is fake news.  He's just waiting for Jan 6th and trusting a corrupt congress to undo this coup.  This was a communist take over of America.  If you think Covid lockdowns are bad you haven't seen anything yet.

At the very least he should command the military to impound those Dominion machines but he's not doing that.  It's as if he has no power.  @realDonaldTrump
1340794912950763521 2020-12-21 07:03:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JayRiseUp @GolightlyGrl427 I know  All that fighting and postponing for $600.00.  Nancy Pelosi is a terrible negotiator.  Several weeks ago she could have gotten a deal for 1200.00 but she refused. "let them eat cake" @SpeakerPelosi

1340792520586919936 2020-12-21 06:53:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you trust congress to do the right thing on Jan 6th and overturn an outright fraud, coup election you are setting yourself up for a very big disappointment.   President Trump should be impounding those Dominion Servers by Military order.    He is still commander in chief.

US Supreme Court has committed Treason.   Relying on the Feckless Supreme Court or waiting until Jan 6th is futile.

Cowards.   Jan 6 is when our Constitution will be gone.
1340773462030237698 2020-12-21 05:37:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KHerriage @bfraser747 Several weeks ago Nancy Pelosi @SpeakerPelosi refused to allow a $1200.00 stand alone bill to go out to Americans.  She's the reason it was reduced to 600.00
1340772727053897728 2020-12-21 05:35:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gigithrives @w_terrence His own tweets.
1340772520765530112 2020-12-21 05:34:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ruggiere_l Jan 6 is when they flush our country down the toilet.  President Trump won't bring in our military to make our elections honest.  I guess they don't live up to their oath to defend the constitution.
1340771642142720000 2020-12-21 05:30:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They don't think it was rigged they KNOW it was rigged because Proof is everywhere.  You are the commander in chief.  Use your power to impound those machines.
1340770452436750337 2020-12-21 05:26:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah He is commander in chief yet he won't bring in the military to impound those machines or do an audit or redo the elections.  Military took an oath to defend our US Constitution.  Appears they are doing nothing.
1340769987917537280 2020-12-21 05:24:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Kay59720620 Proof of election Fraud is everywhere.
1340769745767809024 2020-12-21 05:23:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ohheckorama @w_terrence Time to be realistic if you ask me.  You don't stop defending your country because it's Christmas.
1340769198469869570 2020-12-21 05:21:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @noMoreCucks @mattgaetz We should not be waiting until Jan 6 to stop this steal.  Dominion voting machines should be impounded by our military immediately.   Waiting until Jan 6 is a trap.
1340767411021082624 2020-12-21 05:13:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DebiC37936 @realDonaldTrump Nothing will be done because our congress is run by a bunch of cowards.
1340767157332791300 2020-12-21 05:12:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realjunsonchan @CiciGtz Are you sure about that?  President keeps tweeting proof of Fraud but it appears all he is going to do is wait until Jan 6.  He does not seem to want to use our Military to defend our constitution and impound those machines.   He's just waiting to see what happens jan 6.
1340766723272654848 2020-12-21 05:11:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DebiC37936 @realDonaldTrump Just like when he allowed Do Nothing AG Jeff Sessions to keep his job for 3 years.  He listens to cowardly advisers who are leading him down the wrong path.
1340766343889448960 2020-12-21 05:09:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DebiC37936 @realDonaldTrump Proof of fraud daily and he even tweets it yet he doesn't use his power to correct it.  He's commander in chief of our Military.  What happened to the Military's oath to defend the United States Constitution?  Free and honest elections are not part of the Constitution?
1340763229576855553 2020-12-21 04:57:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> Just do nothing.  Don't demand Justice.  Don't dispute anything.  Just wait for January 6th and trust your Congress to do the right thing.   Nothing to see here.  The RINO Congress will save you from the coup on Jan 6
1340762752629948416 2020-12-21 04:55:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @John47070623 @w_terrence Our country was literally stolen by Socialists communist China.  He should be bringing in the Military to do a new election.   This is total 🐂💩 We see the proof daily yet we are waiting until jan 6 to lose our freedom.
1340761319390113792 2020-12-21 04:49:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @w_terrence Why did President Trump refuse to call in the Military to save us from a Communist Coup.  This was not an election.  We have the proof.
1340760565329788928 2020-12-21 04:46:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump More Proof every day of Fraud yet officials who certified this fraud are not held accountable.
1340760331732144128 2020-12-21 04:45:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Of course David Perdue is saying this right before his election to get the vote.  Do you really believe he will do it after he is elected?  I don't.
1340759894660501504 2020-12-21 04:44:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lawindsor @realDonaldTrump They will say that now but I don't trust any of them to do the right thing on Jan 6.  Why is nothing being done now?
1340759713848336384 2020-12-21 04:43:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @realDonaldTrump Do you really trust the RINO's in Congress with the fate of our Republic?  Really? Just waiting until January 6 to watch them hand over our country to communists who committed a coup?
1340757990752698368 2020-12-21 04:36:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump What are you going to do about it?  Why aren't the machines being impounded?  Nobody gets arrested for certifying a Fraud election?   Just wait for January and trust the Corrupt Congress and let them Steal our country and force us into communism?
1340589807949422592 2020-12-20 17:28:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RaymondBurchJr1 @KZambon @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump She can't because she's just a parrot mimicking her Communist Parties lies.  President Trump saved lives and the Democrats like Nancy Pelosi encouraged travel and going into crowded places.  All on video.
1340550275577200641 2020-12-20 14:51:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AlexaBroadbent WE just wait and wait and wait.
1340550002070802435 2020-12-20 14:50:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @smalltownglobal @realDonaldTrump I hope that's the case.  I really do.  Otherwise this country is gone.
1340549580677476352 2020-12-20 14:48:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AlexaBroadbent I need to just stop watching news and not come on twitter for a while.  Someone let me know when this nightmare is over.
1340549155865837570 2020-12-20 14:46:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AlexaBroadbent We have all the evidence, poof of blatant Fraud.  Courts are corrupt and won't hear it.  Each day goes by more proof yet nothing happens.
1340545468359569412 2020-12-20 14:32:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LynnWoodcock2 @realDonaldTrump It's the only way this communist take over election fraud will be stopped.  Need to impound dominion machines and hold mayors, governors accountable for treason.
1340544578118512641 2020-12-20 14:28:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Very disappointed to hear you say it's fake news.
1340544250916655104 2020-12-20 14:27:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump What are you doing about it?

1340543030705627137 2020-12-20 14:22:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump President just tweeted there will be no martial law.  I guess he's hoping on jan 6 the corrupt, criminal republicans in Congress will do the right thing and overturn the Fraud coup election but it won't happen. They are corrupt.  He has the power to stop this now.  Why won't he?
1340541891012481024 2020-12-20 14:17:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @John47070623 @realjunsonchan @realDonaldTrump Rights of ordinary citizens are already suspended without Martial law.
1340541666189406208 2020-12-20 14:16:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Sweetemmilyn @realDonaldTrump Without Martial law our country is going communist.
1340541034455953408 2020-12-20 14:14:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realjunsonchan @realDonaldTrump He just said no Martial law so I guess he's not doing anything.
1340522649554849792 2020-12-20 13:01:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 @realDonaldTrump He needs new advisers.
1340520459188617216 2020-12-20 12:52:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> Something good for President Trump must be going on because suddenly today getting a wave of Leftist trolls again...  That always means they are afraid of something that's happening.
1340519158807547906 2020-12-20 12:47:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 @realDonaldTrump That's what i've been saying. If we wait until January 6 for Congress to stop this fraud, coup it's over.  Those backstabbers will betray America.   I guess he's not going to do what he should and bring in the military?  So sad.
1340516131316985856 2020-12-20 12:35:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gatewaypundit His Lawyers should have advised him to do this a long time ago...
1340507325451231233 2020-12-20 12:00:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1blantdaddy Yes, has the FDA approved it yet?
1340504111200886785 2020-12-20 11:47:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @w_terrence They are not left wing thieves, they are Communists attempting to steal an election with the help of China.   This is a coup.
1340440921230385152 2020-12-20 07:36:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SenToomey  You just want attention?  12 hours of fame. It's not your money.   https://t.co/lK2yPPPi3f
1340433965597949953 2020-12-20 07:08:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MajorPatriot Brian Kemp doesn't care if he gets recalled.   He's got so much China bribe money stashed away he never needs another Government check ever again.
1340433572310654976 2020-12-20 07:07:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> If we are just waiting for January 6 in hopes of our Corrupt Republican Congress to right this wrongful, fraudulent stolen election then we have lost this fight.   Something needs to happen soon if Justice is to prevail.  Commander in Chief needs to do something @realDonaldTrump
1340424120203239427 2020-12-20 06:29:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kmindeye @MajorPatriot Those states knowingly certified Fraudulent elections no question about it.  They won't subtract illegal votes they know and see themselves.   Supreme Court is treasonous. Our Military who took an oath to defend our constitution are doing nothing. WHY?  President has the power.
1340421309226831873 2020-12-20 06:18:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kmindeye @MajorPatriot If Justice were going to prevail we'd already see Military stepping in to supervise and conduct a audits or new elections.  President is commander in chief and he's tweeting about January 6?   Can't trust corrupt Congress to fight this coup jan 6..  Why won't he do something?
1340420558391898112 2020-12-20 06:15:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MajorPatriot @Cindy123go I'm not so sure about that.  Our President is the Commander in Chief and the US Military took an oath to defend our Constitution yet nothing is being done.  We just see tweets.  Enormous proof of Fraud/coup and courts and politicians are all corrupt.  Yet nothing is being done.
1340407359382802432 2020-12-20 05:23:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Most "republican politicians" are too weak.  They fold!  They will fold in the face of communism which is what they are doing now.  We have the proof of fraud.  Take it to Military courts.  We cannot depend on the Politicians.  This was not an election it was a Fraud Coup.
1340405660991643651 2020-12-20 05:16:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump If you don't do something soon like invoke the Military to protect our constitution and our elections then we will be locked down forever.  What are you going to do?
1340403859408134144 2020-12-20 05:09:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump So we know they certified a fraud election and that is illegal.   when are you going to declare martial law and have our Military supervise audits or a new election?
1340234534705528834 2020-12-19 17:56:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> Isn't it illegal to fire a whistle blower for outing fraud?

We need Military to supervise forensic audits or new elections.  @realDonaldTrump  We cannot afford to wait until Jan 6 and allow corrupt congress to betray America and legalize this Fraud.

1340222186414514179 2020-12-19 17:07:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @EmeraldRobinson He use to seem to be so patriotic and sure was a disappointment after what he said after the fraud election.
1340221757161017344 2020-12-19 17:05:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @EmeraldRobinson Yes, he did go against our President.  I remember.  Not too bright of him to purposely follow her though.

1340220918098874369 2020-12-19 17:02:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @EmeraldRobinson It would be really stupid to follow her purposely knowing his wife or anyone else can see.  So maybe an accident?
1340220548844949506 2020-12-19 17:00:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @EmeraldRobinson It's possible it could be someone he followed and her profile could have seemed innocent and then later she could have changed her profile to what she really is...  Just giving him the benefit of the doubt.

If they are going to do signature ballots they need to do it in all counties not just one and it needs to be a full forensic signature audit.   @realDonaldTrump  President Trump needs to bring in the Military to supervise.  We cannot wait until Jan 6.  Congress is corrupt

Something needs to be done soon.  Please at the very least have the Military get involved.  Impound Dominion machines and whatever else necessary.   Action not words.

There is no reason to allow them to hide evidence.  We have a right to those machines.  They are destroying and withholding evidence.  Time to act sir.

1340021524699303936 2020-12-19 03:50:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> So our US Supreme Court "essential workers" are working out of their home hearing cases on Zoom?  How's that work?  They reportedly closed the courthouse down in March.   Are they really doing anything?   Sounds to me like they are taking an indefinite vacation.
1340019764857466880 2020-12-19 03:43:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 We can't have our Supreme court working out of their home offices.  We have a serious problem and they should never be closing the Supreme court.  this is shocking.  I had no idea they were working out of home.
1340019292075507712 2020-12-19 03:41:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FleetingHevel I find it hard to believe our Supreme court is working out of their homes.   If so then we have a serious problem in this country.
1340018674170675205 2020-12-19 03:38:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Ronny_Malone The US Supreme Court should never be closed.  We pay taxes!  If they are essential workers they need to show up to work.  We don't pay them to work out of home in their pajamas.
1340018382444191744 2020-12-19 03:37:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @SexCounseling The Supreme Court Judges are also "essential workers" yet they closed the court house in March and have apparently been working from home.  This is getting scary!  Lazy and cowardly Judges.
1340017888569135105 2020-12-19 03:35:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> The US Supreme Court, the highest court and most important court in America reports that the 9 Judges "essential workers" closed the court and have not reported to the court house since March.  Aren't essential workers suppose to report for duty?   What is going on?
1340016013002194947 2020-12-19 03:28:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> Supreme Court spokesperson said that the US Supreme Court Justices have been working out of their home since March.  So basically the US Supreme Court even though "essential workers" get to be lazy and not report to the court House.  They are doing nothing for this country.

Cannot trust Congress or the courts.

1339886712210612224 2020-12-18 18:54:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @arelab13 @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @BillWhiteNY @marklevinshow @GovMikeHuckabee @RichardGrenell @MariaBartiromo @Scavino45 @LouDobbs @jbinnall @SaraCarterDC @POTUS Yes no more talk.  Time to defend our Constitution.  This is really scary to see the Supreme Court behave this way.  This is the time of behavior that takes place after a country has been taken over by communists.
1339884244735160320 2020-12-18 18:44:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kylegriffin1 The American people are going to sue Dominion Voting machines for every penny they own.
1339876254430851072 2020-12-18 18:12:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Insurrection act needed more than any other time in our History

1339855420777582597 2020-12-18 16:50:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump A forensic audit.  Needs to be done under military supervision.
1339855215378382849 2020-12-18 16:49:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realjunsonchan @realDonaldTrump He needs to declare the insurrection act or Martial law whichever is required to clean this mess up.  The courts are too corrupt to be honest and we cannot trust politicians in congress.   We need military to supervise a full on audit or redo this fraudulent election.
1339853685300494336 2020-12-18 16:43:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @vlb55jr @wendydcoe @word1988 @RepMoBrooks @TTuberville Court Judges are corrupt and working for the Democrat Communist party.  We cannot trust the courts or congress. We need the Military to come in and supervise a total forensic audit or a redo of this Fraudulent election.  @realDonaldTrump   Marital law is needed.
1339853066820935680 2020-12-18 16:40:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is blatant election fraud and there is PROOF.  The actual illegal ballots speak for themselves.   End the Fraud please  @realDonaldTrump   Please bring in Martial law and have the military supervise either a new election or forensic audit. We have the proof.
1339795345966915584 2020-12-18 12:51:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jaymart3323 @LaurenWitzkeDE @realDonaldTrump They blackmailed him
1339791938283687936 2020-12-18 12:37:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LaurenWitzkeDE @realDonaldTrump Judge Roberts needs to be investigated. He use to be very conservative and somebody blackmailed him.
1339791446451183616 2020-12-18 12:35:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @puckster23 @realDonaldTrump The courts are tainted, corrupt.  Time to get military involved.  Either audit this election forensically or redo the election with military supervision and Voter ID
1339791121858215938 2020-12-18 12:34:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ransom54 @realDonaldTrump The President is commander in Chief and the Military took an oath to defend our constitution.  Foreign interference in physically altering our election with fraud and ballot dumping, Dominion machines is an attack on our constitution.  President has a duty to bring in military
1339789421365739522 2020-12-18 12:27:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KokeReport @realDonaldTrump Amy Coney Barrett proved to me that she is not pro life. At least we learned some truth.
1339788578478411777 2020-12-18 12:24:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rromona @realDonaldTrump They did not follow the constitution, they followed their fear.
1339787841035853824 2020-12-18 12:21:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realjunsonchan @realDonaldTrump Yes, Insurrection act is needed or we will be living under a Communist China Regime.
1339787524475027456 2020-12-18 12:20:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JohnFromCranber @realDonaldTrump President Trump will not allow rioting once Martial Law is invoked but the Cowardly Judges on the Supreme court are too stupid to figure that out.
1339787209579266048 2020-12-18 12:18:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Studying law is not that difficult.  It's not a difficult area of study.  They are just cowards hiding behind a law degree.
1339786378553397248 2020-12-18 12:15:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 How about we call the new party the "American Party"  ?
1339785677341294593 2020-12-18 12:12:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump If Amy Coney Barrett was a true pro life person she would have voted with Alito and Thomas.   As a Catholic and a pro life American, I am extremely disappointed in her failure to act.  She has put babies in the womb in great danger by her actions.
1339785092844011522 2020-12-18 12:10:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Judge Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett lied to the American people and lied to the Senate and to you Mr. President.   They basically lied on their interview.  They could care less about our freedoms, our right to a fair election and our US Constitution.
1339783524115644420 2020-12-18 12:04:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump The US Supreme Court is worthless now.  If this Fraud election Coup is allowed to succeed the Democrat Communists will pack the supreme court and now that they are worthless It doesn't matter.  Supreme Court will never protect children in the womb.
1339782857170960384 2020-12-18 12:01:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Justice Roberts is compromised.  He needs to be investigated.
1339782559459262465 2020-12-18 12:00:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please do not wait until January 6th to resolve this FRAUD on the American people.    Either redo this fraudulent election or do forensic audit of every ballot.   You have the power to do this...
1339782189513240576 2020-12-18 11:59:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JasonWarrant3 @Angevin1170 @jilldotter @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Unfortunately the American people may have no other choice unless they want to be locked down indefinitely
1339781902295654402 2020-12-18 11:57:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump It's all fake!  They set aside 20 rooms in the entire hospital fo Covid and when those rooms are full they scream "overflowing"  IT'S A SCAM! Fake crocodile tears coming out of nurses doing 3 minute interviews with fake news.
1339781187825364994 2020-12-18 11:55:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No matter what happens Never Concede Mr. President.  Never give this Legitimacy to Fraud!  Never!

1339780206404374529 2020-12-18 11:51:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They should all resign except for Clarence Thomas and Alito.   The rest of those Judges have contempt for the Voters in this country and the US Constitution.
1339779574775730176 2020-12-18 11:48:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump We cannot wait until January 6 to remedy this Communist Election Fraud Coup.  We have the Proof.   Also cannot trust congress.   Please act now sir!
1339768698689581062 2020-12-18 11:05:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You have the evidence and PROOF of Election Fraud. These States won't even subtract the votes that are invalid.  Enough!  We can't wait until Jan 6th.  Something needs to be done before then.  If they won't admit Fraud please have military supervise a new election.  Voter id
1339768122568396801 2020-12-18 11:03:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Why are these states refusing to throw out votes we know are invalid?  This needs to stop!  It needs to go in reverse now. We cannot wait until January 6th.  Please act now. Use your power.
1339767971724447744 2020-12-18 11:02:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> And these people who put out the video and support this are trying to steal this election in order to have power over our Military.  Very Scary
1339766229377019904 2020-12-18 10:55:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Don't depend on Congress to be honest.  Biden must concede or we need a new election.  Don't wait until Jan 6.   You have the power to stop this.
1339765520388694018 2020-12-18 10:52:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kaiaka @realDonaldTrump We already know and have the ballots showing duplicate votes for thousands, non citizens by the 1000s, and it goes on and on yet they want to keep these votes counted.  Why aren't they tossing those?  Time for higher power to intercede.
1339765024311504899 2020-12-18 10:50:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kaiaka @realDonaldTrump I hope he's not depending on Senators to give us our Freedom back.   Only the Commander in chief of the US military at this moment can do that.  Courts and congress are feckless.
1339764421636227074 2020-12-18 10:48:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  We need to either do forensic audit of our elections or redo this election.  We cannot sit and wait until January 6th and we cannot trust congress or the courts.   We have the proof.  REDO THE ELECTION OR AUDIT ALL OF IT.
1339763045203988481 2020-12-18 10:42:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Please defend the US Constitution and use all the power God gave you! We cannot trust our courts or our Congress to do what is right.   This election needs to either be audited or completely redone with voter ID.  Our votes were stolen.
1339762481577611264 2020-12-18 10:40:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Livre__Opiniao @realDonaldTrump I hope he's not waiting until January 6th to resolve this.  Congress cannot be trusted.  two or 3 senators making comments that they May or will object is not enough.
1339762119009431553 2020-12-18 10:39:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @PaulJonna We need martial law.  Military needs to step on and either audit with Military supervision or do a new election and demand ID to prove you are a citizen.  President cannot depend on corrupt courts or corrupt congress on jan 6.  It wont happen with them.  Too corrupt.
1339761661310160896 2020-12-18 10:37:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kaiaka @realDonaldTrump Just because there are 2 or 3 senators saying they will or "may" object does not stop the steal.  It needs to be stopped NOW!  Courts are corrupt and our Senators last minute deals they will get paid off or compromised before Jan 6 Only Military can resolve this enormous treason
1339760865537478657 2020-12-18 10:34:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealKyleMorris @realDonaldTrump @TTuberville The time for being nice to criminal Democrats who committed Election fraud is over.  We cannot go on more days to resolve Fraud.  We have overwhelming proof and we should not have to wait for Jan 6    Must defend our right to vote.  Our votes were stolen.  We don't trust Congress
1339760143056076801 2020-12-18 10:31:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Bring in the Military sir.  We need Military to supervise either audits or new elections.  Time is of the essence.  This fraud cannot go on.
1339759663487672322 2020-12-18 10:29:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Do not depend on the courts or Congress to resolve an election we know and have proof was fraudulent.  We have the proof.  We need to redo the election with Military supervision.  Make everyone have ID.
1339758930499518466 2020-12-18 10:26:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @PaulJonna The Judges in California continue to side with our Governor because they are not Judges they are political activist and most do not care about the US Constitution.
1339758639326773248 2020-12-18 10:25:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You are Commander in Chief and it is military's responsibility to protect and defend the constitution.  Ensuring elections are free of foreign interference of fraud is part of defending our Constitution.  You need to Declare Martial law and have Military supervise a new election.
1339757312228032513 2020-12-18 10:20:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @B24bomber4Daddy @seanhannity Worry about Hunter after we've secured the election.
1339757152416612353 2020-12-18 10:19:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PaulJonna @MaryFass3 These Judges need to be impeached.  We should not even have to argue in order to keep our religious rights granted to us in the US Constitution.
1339756695279419392 2020-12-18 10:17:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @B24bomber4Daddy @seanhannity If they are allowed to steal our election and this election Fraud coup succeeds, Hunter Biden will land a job in the White House working for his illegitimate President Father.  We need to focus on fighting the Coup Fraud and not let them steal power.
1339755864207446016 2020-12-18 10:14:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @goldens_only @seanhannity @senatemajldr Exactly.  Talking about Covid and Hunter Biden is just ignoring our stolen election.   If this Fraudulent election is allowed to succeed Hunter Biden will be given a job working in the White House and lock downs will sky rocket.
1339754213371387904 2020-12-18 10:07:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity   Thought about giving you another chance but your talking about Hunter.  Not about Election Fraud.  Our election stolen.  Talking about Hunter and ignoring the election Fraud right now does not help.   Turned the channel.
1339728183139037184 2020-12-18 08:24:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You won the Election.  We cannot let them steal our election and steal our votes.
1339517495342899201 2020-12-17 18:27:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> It's just communism.  It's not about Covid.

1339492621727584258 2020-12-17 16:48:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> He should if he has any integrity and if he wants to keep his job.
1339492353556402176 2020-12-17 16:47:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jsolomonReports @realDonaldTrump Evidence, proof of Fraud just keeps pouring in daily and the Media and Democrat Politicians keep saying "prove it", "where's the evidence".  Courts refuse to hear cases because they don't want to see the evidence.   Judges working as political activist.  Corrupt Courts.
1339491488103768064 2020-12-17 16:43:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MurderFancier @costellodaniel1 Also, the United States Military does not need the FBI or CIA.   US Military is capable of conducting their own Investigations.
1339484285703659520 2020-12-17 16:15:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  As commander in Chief it is indeed the Presidents responsibility to insure that the US Military protect and defend the United States Constitution which means protecting the countries elections from fraud and foreign interference.

Democrat Politicians sleeping with Chinese spies and Republican Politicians taking Chinese bribes.   Complete Corruption.  Has the word corruption come up so often it means nothing any more?

1339372389407154183 2020-12-17 08:50:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> There is Evidence and proof of FRAUD everywhere already.   We know President Trump won because we have proof but the left Media and Communist Democrat Politicians are trying to hide it.
1339371997076176897 2020-12-17 08:49:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> The goal of the Left Democrat Communist party is to close all churches down permanently.    Democrat Party hates God.

1339369056793554944 2020-12-17 08:37:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> It took Dominion CEO 6 weeks to appear to a hearing because Dominion needed time to figure out what Lies to use and hide the evidence.   Dominion CEO is a LIAR.

Close down @walmart and @target, @costco  Airlines pack people in like sardines.  Stop closing small business while rewarding big empires. This is not about Covid any more.
1339365492356616192 2020-12-17 08:23:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> The "voting machines" should have been seized the day after the rigged election.   The Liberal Communist Judges in those state Courts did not want to release the evidence.   Corrupt Judges,  America is full of Corrupt Government officials and the Media stinks.
1339365051757600770 2020-12-17 08:21:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> Rigged Election.   China and the Democrats rigged this.

1339163726180597763 2020-12-16 19:01:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tedcruz   If you want to keep your job you better speak out against corrupt traitor Mitch McConnell.  He is complicit in the communist Fraud election coup and siding with Biden.    The Republican Party will be gone if this fraudulent election is successful.    You say nothing?
1339155054801027072 2020-12-16 18:27:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @atensnut We better hear GOP Senators and Congressmen speak out against him and he must step down as leader immediately if they all want to have jobs.

1339132633582694400 2020-12-16 16:57:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @liquidlaugh Once in a while I think to myself why didn't I go into politics after college.  It's so easy, all you do is lie, backstab and collect cash bribes.  After that thought comes into my head I think.  Nah, could not look at myself in the mirror If I was one of them.

God is merciful but he is just.  This country will see the  wrath of God if it continues on this evil path.   President Trump is our last chance
1339125458462416899 2020-12-16 16:29:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump The State Courts rule in favor of their political affiliation and the US Supreme court rules against the constitution for fear of their own irrelevance.    Selfish cowards.

1339071935787888641 2020-12-16 12:56:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Perpetualmaniac I'm angry that two swing states waited 6 weeks to subpoena machines, hard drives.  They gave them 6 weeks to destroy the evidence.  It should have been seized day after election.  Losers wait 6 weeks to subpoena it.  Pathetic losers.
1339065002615926784 2020-12-16 12:29:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jsolomonReports Did Fauci get vaccinated?  He should get one for rabies too.

1339063907575496707 2020-12-16 12:24:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We won't even have a country left if they really steal this election.  Wisconsin and Michigan bragging how after their hearings they just now subpoena the machines, hard drives etc.  They gave them 6 weeks to destroy evidence.  Should have done that on day after election.
1339056982448242689 2020-12-16 11:57:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AZGOP Should have been a law in place that if election machines are used and an election is contested it can immediately be seized.   Our Supreme Court is worthless.  Courts are activist Judges working for Democrat Party.  There is no Justice in USA
1339056464413933568 2020-12-16 11:55:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AZGOP Transparency?  Integrity?   It took 6 weeks.  Were those machines or evidence left unattended for 6 weeks?  How much evidence was purposely destroyed?
1339055087881080833 2020-12-16 11:49:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RallyNate Nice!  6 weeks later they vote to Subpoena everything and after they destroyed the evidence how much is left?
1339048288729792512 2020-12-16 11:22:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CountessNorika American Party ?

1339047727708028929 2020-12-16 11:20:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CountessNorika Republicans are too cowardly.   We need a new Party after this.
1339047457615798272 2020-12-16 11:19:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  And @senatemajldr  Mitch McConnell is a traitor who is committing treason
1339047080342351873 2020-12-16 11:17:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> But it took 6 weeks to be able to subpoena the evidence.  How much evidence did the criminal communist Democrats destroy?   They finally give up the evidence after 6 weeks unattended?
1339038487622774784 2020-12-16 10:43:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They will create "new strains" of the virus.

1338570195497959424 2020-12-15 03:42:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> Every States Electors should cast their votes for President Trump.  Trump clearly won the election on 11/3/2020.   Everything after that was FRAUD

1338562740772773888 2020-12-15 03:13:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Acosta @PressSec Nobody should respond do you.  By doing so gives you legitimacy.  You are an illegitimate "reporter" and you are irrelevant!   Fake News
1338561868718243840 2020-12-15 03:09:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> A corrupt "conservative judge" in Wisconsin joined other corrupt judges and voted against overturning over 200,000 fraudulent ballots.  The corrupt "conservative" Judge weighed in and said it was denied because Trump waited too long to file.    These Judges are committing Treason
1338558581990281216 2020-12-15 02:56:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thecjpearson @DavidShafer Thank you David Shafer and CJ Pearson.  You are both Patriots.  Prayers go out for both of you  🙏

1338440828587393024 2020-12-14 19:08:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DebbieSchooley3 I have no doubt this is a communist takeover.  Communist China is behind the Dominion machines and printing millions of counterfeit ballots working with the COMMUNIST Democrat Party to steal this election.   USA is in danger.  Where is our Military @realDonaldTrump
1338440209042554880 2020-12-14 19:06:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WhiteJacketPink Yes we are.  It's happening in front of our eyes.
1338439469100253185 2020-12-14 19:03:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why did our country ever do business with China?  Why?  https://t.co/txQGwOL3DS
1338439000307027968 2020-12-14 19:01:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TombStoneWyatt Every day since the election we have been getting huge breaking news on election fraud.  We have overwhelming proof yet it is being ignored by the media and the courts.
1338437131627163651 2020-12-14 18:54:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> We are going to need to start getting information from our old Encyclopedia books because Google has been eliminating History and facts.    Please refer to older encyclopedias.    Google is erasing information that shows how dangerous communism is.  Only tainted information.

1338429309770375170 2020-12-14 18:23:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> Kamala Harris sent a tweet not long ago showing her belief in Communism.  China Virus (Covid) and this stolen election was not a coincidence. China is a communist Country Does everyone understand what communist governments do to their people?  We can't let them steal our country.
1338428401992912897 2020-12-14 18:19:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers @Soh1006 We have to pray for him and for USA.  There are at least 80 million of us who are thinking the same thing.  We must all stick together.

1338423514714402816 2020-12-14 18:00:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> When does our Military uphold their oath to defend the United States Constitution?  https://t.co/nf0BSbhXLD
1338422086897844227 2020-12-14 17:54:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LeahR77 @sea5 Yes and our Military took an oath to defend the Constitution.  I keep wondering when that will happen.

1338419584454430720 2020-12-14 17:44:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @RodgerDoggers What a shame she was not picked.  Nothing but duds.
1338419008396115970 2020-12-14 17:42:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @RodgerDoggers Amy Coney Barrett is not a good Catholic.  Her vote put the lives of millions of pre-born babies in danger.  Her vote put our religious freedom in danger.  At least we know she's not a saint.
1338415207123599361 2020-12-14 17:27:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @RodgerDoggers Should have picked her.  Conservatives from Cuba understand what Communism is.  Amy Coney Barrett is not too smart.  Her not having notes did not impress me.  So what.  Look how she turned out to be.
1338413475236782080 2020-12-14 17:20:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers When I saw her get sworn in walking up the stairs with President her body language and yes her eyes just made me thing she was going to betray him and our constitution. I kept telling myself maybe I was wrong.
1338412110716436480 2020-12-14 17:14:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah @realDonaldTrump Concentration camps
1338411597266526209 2020-12-14 17:12:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah @realDonaldTrump And defund the Police in Urban areas outside the city.
1338411103324278786 2020-12-14 17:10:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Democrat Socialist Communist party stole this election with the help of Communist China.  They had help.     We cannot let them steal power.   They want to close this country down and DEFUND POLICE Departments across the USA and then go after your 1st amendment.
1338409699394273280 2020-12-14 17:05:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 Despicable cowards!  That's why the job should have term limits.
1338408884403200000 2020-12-14 17:01:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ishoulddowhat @Soh1006 Huh!  Not sure but could very well be.  If so no wonder.
1338408741130027008 2020-12-14 17:01:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 They are afraid of the left mob and think those who support our President and our country are going to just sit and take this?  They thought wrong!
1338408490381893632 2020-12-14 17:00:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 Still, that just shows how weak and two faced the 3 newer Justices are.  If I were one of those new Judges I'd go to the media and report Chief Roberts for intimidating the Judges.
1338407867536142336 2020-12-14 16:57:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 I believe that's pretty close to how it went down.  Chief Justice John Roberts should be arrested by the Military for TREASON.   Americans who want their freedom need to rise up and fight  this tyranny!
1338406177776914433 2020-12-14 16:51:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ishoulddowhat I agree.  Big mistake.  One of Presidents deep state advisers recommended her.  I was suspicious of her after I saw her get sworn in.  Something about her.
1338404548835115010 2020-12-14 16:44:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> I have absolutely no respect for the Supreme Court.   Except for Justice Clarence.  Even Justice Alito played games with the American people.   Amy Coney Barrett is two faced and dishonest.
1338402444082999296 2020-12-14 16:36:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> Airlines, Walmart, Target are aloud to operate but Churches are forced to close?  If they are going to close our churches they need to close down the airlines, @walmart @target, liquor stores.    No picking and choosing.
1338401362602729472 2020-12-14 16:32:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> Their is evil in the air in America.  I can feel it.  Democrat Socialist Party working with China to steal this election and cowardly courts, politicians are running away.   Pray for President Donald J. Trump and the United States of America.  President Trump won.   Pray for USA
1338400811353665539 2020-12-14 16:29:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ScottBaio They should close that ledge to the Public.  That is too dangerous.
1338400601269362688 2020-12-14 16:29:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ScottBaio People should not be allowed to do that.  It's dangerous.
1338400069049929728 2020-12-14 16:26:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeFreedomLove @realDonaldTrump We have overwhelming Proof of FRAUD in all 6 swing states.   Evidence and proof is stronger each day.  They will NOT get away with this FRAUD ELECTION.
1338399636977983488 2020-12-14 16:25:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump COUNT LEGAL VOTES  The millions of illegal votes must be cancelled.
1338399179446501376 2020-12-14 16:23:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rvengosh @realDonaldTrump Yes we are a nation of LAWS and Election Fraud is against our laws and you cannot Certify FRAUD. He is not conceding to FRAUD.
1338398478876037120 2020-12-14 16:20:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @su_flaherty @JoeFreedomLove @realDonaldTrump Because the courts so far refuse to SEE THE EVIDENCE. Corrupt State Courts not hearing cases.   Read Read Read.    We have overwhelming evidence of Election Fraud in all 6 swing states and the Proof won't go away it will just get stronger.  Dominion machines are a FRAUD
1338397233910202368 2020-12-14 16:15:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @2ATamara @realDonaldTrump I hope and pray you are right.  Democrat party is pure evil.

1338324901271195649 2020-12-14 11:28:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JonathanTCasey They already kicks us off their platform and censor us.
1338324631996882945 2020-12-14 11:27:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JonathanTCasey Good!  Nobody will be on their platforms.  Advertisers will pay other platforms.
1338323978184609792 2020-12-14 11:24:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Do it now!!!
1338323810873851909 2020-12-14 11:23:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> Repeal Section 230

1338322345753100289 2020-12-14 11:18:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kevinjerrystarr Even Democrats who are on these platforms will benefit if they push their liberal congress/senators to back the repeal.  This should be a bipartisan bill to repeal.  Would be nice if President could just do EO.  Everyone would benefit and could get some cash.
1338320276459716609 2020-12-14 11:09:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Hey you guys.  If Section 230 is repealed we will be able to sue for serious cash from these "platforms" that have discriminated against the American people and interfered in our elections.  We would be able to join a class action lawsuit.  Many of them.     Repeal Section 230
1338319145562034177 2020-12-14 11:05:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Please sign an executive order removing section 230 protection from these big tech "platforms" so we can sue them for discrimination.

1338315531019939841 2020-12-14 10:51:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Implement Martial law and also an Executive order cancelling Big Tech Section 230 legal protection.

1338276217233928192 2020-12-14 08:14:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> It has been proven that Dominion counting machines gave thousands and thousands of Trump votes to Joe Biden and they won't allow complete forensic audit.   Copies of ballots in hundreds of thousands were seen by observers before they were kicked out of counting rooms  FRAUD

1338273964318019585 2020-12-14 08:05:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Democrats have put conservatives, Christians and all people of faith and morals on a list.   After they put us on a list they stole our election with massive proven FRAUD.  Don't let these thieves, bullies have power of your Military!  Biden Lost.   They cheated!
1338273511966527489 2020-12-14 08:04:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TomFitton @SenatorLoeffler @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump Why do I not hear Loeffler and Perdue fighting, speaking out against this fraudulent election COUP?
1338272398387236864 2020-12-14 07:59:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto Supreme Court is worthless.   Cowards!
1338272009097080833 2020-12-14 07:58:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KeithGal0504 Democrat Party legalizes, promotes and encourages Abortion taking the lives of human Babies in the womb all the way to birth and infanticide.  Party of evil steals election and says supporters of President are on a list?   President must protect Americans.  @realDonaldTrump
1338271262200659968 2020-12-14 07:55:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KeithGal0504 And she said more than just that.  She knew.   Why won't the states allow forensic audit, signature audit with envelope count of the votes? They want to hide their fraud but we already have a mountain of proof that this is fraud.
1338269351808397313 2020-12-14 07:47:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi @SpeakerPelosi  Knew about this Fraud, cheat, coup! She made comments about it well before the election.
1338268538864193538 2020-12-14 07:44:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @weejockmaley This cowardly, pampered Supreme Court is a sham!
1338267428195713025 2020-12-14 07:39:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal Like our Cowardly Supreme Court?
1338263151318425601 2020-12-14 07:22:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @robert_crosby20 @RL9631 We have huge evidence of Fraud.  Proof!   Yet the Liars keep saying "no evidence"  They cheated.  President Trump won this election.
1338262528510500864 2020-12-14 07:20:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoanHol24893501 @MaryFass3 @realDonaldTrump How do you think we can do forensic audits of the votes if the violent left won't even allow observers when they counted the votes? It needs to be supervised.
1338261943417630720 2020-12-14 07:18:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoanHol24893501 @MaryFass3 @realDonaldTrump It is the Military's job to protect and defend the United States Constitution.
1338260213791563776 2020-12-14 07:11:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Implement Martial Law.  Military needs to do a forensic audit of the votes.    This is an emergency.
1338258155923369985 2020-12-14 07:03:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> Don't let the Democrats have power of the United States Military.  They cheated, they lied and they also put us on a list...   What do they plan on doing to people on that list?
1338257952038211586 2020-12-14 07:02:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Since the FBI wont do their job please ask the Military to look into why the Democrats have put us on a LIST.  Why are we being put on a list?  What are they planning? Concentration camps?  Seriously, why are they putting us on a list?
1338257513985163264 2020-12-14 07:00:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal I think they are planning on putting us in trains and shipping us to concentration camps.   This is why they planned this Fraud election to take power and then do something to us.  They already said we are on a list.
1338257205632495617 2020-12-14 06:59:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ScottFishman @Francis36961488 President Trump won.  They all committed Fraud (COUP) Evidence is overwhelming yet the liars keep saying there is no evidence.   They will not get away with this.
1338256701783298048 2020-12-14 06:57:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal They sill force us to have mass outside and won't let us go inside our churches.  They want to destroy our churches.
1338256369107910658 2020-12-14 06:55:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @richard71574332 @realDonaldTrump Liar.  Proof of voter fraud everywhere.  1000s of affidavits, photographs, videos.  Overwhelming proof.  You're a liar.
1338255969097113602 2020-12-14 06:54:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please bring in our Military to Supervise Forensic audits in all swing states.  This has to be done with strong military supervision.  Our votes were stolen.   Observers also witnessed copies of the same ballots.  COPIES
1338255348822470656 2020-12-14 06:51:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They kicked out Republican poll watchers (observers) and counted in secret.   We have videos, affidavits.  This occurred in all swing states.   Bring in military and redo elections.    Our votes were stolen.
1338253395904266240 2020-12-14 06:44:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Make them do a forensic audit of the ballots.  Bring in the Military.  You have every right to do this.     Our votes were outright stolen.
1338253107667456000 2020-12-14 06:42:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They refuse to do forensic audits to eliminate fraud in the count and they had plenty of time to do that.  They don't want the fraud exposed any more than it is.   They kicked observers out and counted in secret. That alone invalidates the election.  Bring in the Military.
1338251536812523520 2020-12-14 06:36:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgersColorado He will never win.  Biden lost.  If Biden is sworn in this is a coup.
1338249977710034944 2020-12-14 06:30:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why doesn't the Supreme Court televise hearings? Their decisions are the most important cases which impact our lives and these Judges are so pampered that they don't have to be televised?
1338209646671106048 2020-12-14 03:50:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Donald J. Trump won the election on 11/3/2020  They stopped counting when he was winning in a landslide in order to reset their Dominion Voting machines to cheat.  We will not accept Fraud.
1338073525194608644 2020-12-13 18:49:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealMattCouch @Matthew_4_Trump I've never been tested for Covid and masks are stupid.
1338072801928876034 2020-12-13 18:46:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BernardKerik @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @RNC @GOP Especially the spineless maggots in the Supreme Court who lied and said they would uphold the Constitution.  Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.   Traitors to the US Constituion, the President and the American voters.
1338071002836692993 2020-12-13 18:39:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Barnes_Law @macmastermkt Why is it that everyone who is white is called a racist. This Wisconsin Judge is the racist.
1338070399746072577 2020-12-13 18:36:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ishoulddowhat @Soh1006 Well said! Please follow back!
1338067933394731008 2020-12-13 18:27:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ishoulddowhat @Soh1006 I believe many of these "conservative" politicians when they first get elected are sincere and something happens to them when they get in there.  Peer pressure, not enough outside support?  Bribes?  These Judges though I feel like they put on a con before they got nominated.
1338065276164689920 2020-12-13 18:16:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @von912 Loving the constitution,  Upholding the Constitution.   Being a conservative.
1338064903949537280 2020-12-13 18:15:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @ishoulddowhat I could care less if they pack the Supreme Court now.  I don't care.  Make those 3 snakes irrelevant.  Supreme court is useless now.  Now we are fighting communism thanks to them. Damage done
1338063222654398464 2020-12-13 18:08:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ishoulddowhat @Soh1006 After she was sworn in when she was going up the stairs with the President something about her body language was off and just made me think she was going to betray him.
1338062846848978945 2020-12-13 18:06:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ishoulddowhat @Soh1006 haha true!!  Hire the best person for the job.  Words of wisdom.
1338061882360430594 2020-12-13 18:03:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LilaGraceRose Alex Jones was right.
1338059645168963584 2020-12-13 17:54:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LilaGraceRose I did notice that.  Everyone bragging about how smart she was and had no notes.  Big deal if she had no notes.  So what!  Doesn't mean shes good.
1338059302548824064 2020-12-13 17:52:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy Murder is not reproductive freedom.
1338059151088340994 2020-12-13 17:52:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy It's not ok to murder children in the womb and infanticide is not ok either.  Your church is not of God.
1338058823928479744 2020-12-13 17:50:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy Then your church is the church of Satan.
1338058618575306754 2020-12-13 17:50:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LilaGraceRose Yes, I'm sure he wonders who he can trust.  Who are his advisers?  Is that a secret?
1338058008597696512 2020-12-13 17:47:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy What's not ok is killing children in the womb.  Yes God loves everyone but not everyone goes to heaven.   Evil people go to Hell.   Abortion is murder.  It's evil.
1338057057539248129 2020-12-13 17:43:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy Abortion is murder.  A baby is not a womans body!    If you have an abortion you are killing another human being.   Life Begins at Conception.    You mock the bible and you mock God.
1338056160306315265 2020-12-13 17:40:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> Abortion is murder! If you support abortion, vote for a politician who legalizes, supports abortion you are committing moral sin and you will go to hell.
1338054065205379072 2020-12-13 17:32:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy Trump did not lose.  You cheated.
1338053844865978368 2020-12-13 17:31:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy Pro choice is murder.  You mock God and you mock the Bible and the 10 commandments from God.  Most Americans are against abortion.  Your proud that you help to murder babies?    That's sick.
1338053378530689025 2020-12-13 17:29:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LilaGraceRose It's a shame that 3 new Supreme court Judges lied and said they were pro life and yesterday they refused to hear the Texas case thus putting the lives of millions of babies in danger.  So many evil people in the world.  They lied to get power.
1338052745828257793 2020-12-13 17:26:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy Swearing him in won't make him President.  More people voted against him that the fraudulent counterfeit votes he obtained.  By the way,  you support an evil party.  Abortion is murder and you support it.   Good luck when you have to answer to God.
1338051925405646848 2020-12-13 17:23:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 They sold their soul to Satan.  I feel bad for the 2 older Judges Alito and Thomas.  3 new Judges coming on the bench claiming they uphold the constitution they vote with the ones who don't.  They make me want to vomit.
1338050583056449537 2020-12-13 17:18:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy You keep lying.  There is Fraud and it is overwhelming.  I can go on and on. Videos, photos. affidavits, whistle blowers and more.  Why do you insist on lying??  This wont end with Supreme Court.  We won't stop fighting this Fraud coup!  There is proof.  Biden cheated.  PERIOD
1338049590830923779 2020-12-13 17:14:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Democrats legalize aborting children in the womb, taking their lives all the way up until they are born and infanticide.  Truly evil people in an evil Party. They have no morals. They are enemies of God  Thank you Mr. President for being on the side of God!
1338048233684135936 2020-12-13 17:08:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   God Bless you Mr. President!    You are a good man and God knows how much good you have done to help save the lives of pre-born babies and those already born.    You have helped Americans put food on their tables and expedited the Covid vaccine.   Thank you
1338046100691795968 2020-12-13 17:00:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 I guess he felt it would be easier politically to chose a woman nominee for justice because replacing one but he chose the wrong woman.  He chose a snake.
1338045512356794371 2020-12-13 16:58:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 I know. Can you imagine being back stabbed by 3 Judges he gave those jobs to and they lied to him and told him they would uphold the US Constitution and this is what they do to him.  Judas Judges!
1338045042485673984 2020-12-13 16:56:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CassandraRules My Great grandmother use to get mad and call people a horses  You know what.....   hehe she was from the horse buggy time right when cars were on the road with horses
1338044631699746817 2020-12-13 16:54:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CassandraRules Right!  Makes people sound really uneducated!
1338044362282790921 2020-12-13 16:53:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CassandraRules She followed me a long time ago and then she unfollowed so I unfollowed her back.  She's kind of snobby.
1338043750623277059 2020-12-13 16:51:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CassandraRules but I do call liberals liars and their 🐂💩  So there are ways you can use certain words.  😃
1338043385941118977 2020-12-13 16:49:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CassandraRules Yes that's bad and you can use other words that are just effective. God does not like bad words.  When I'm alone I will sometimes slip and yell something at the TV when a liberal is lying.  LOL but definitely not good to do it where everyone can see or hear.
1338042249767075840 2020-12-13 16:45:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 LOL, he wrong a book "A republic if you can keep it" and he destroyed the Republic!!  What a creep he is!   Treason!  He just cares about money for his book.
1338041912670896128 2020-12-13 16:43:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 All 3. Gorusch, Kavanaugh and Barrett are cowards and liars.  And Kavanuagh the way they went after him and we fought for him and he steps on our constitution.  They are all 3 Backstabbers.  We don't the Supreme court any more.  They are worthless.  snakes!
1338040566483877888 2020-12-13 16:38:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CassandraRules You should see how many Leftist trolls came out of nowhere the last 3 days harassing and using filth words to me.  I had to block hundreds.  Twitter allows them to do this to us but if we do that we get suspended. Repeal section 230
1338039867880529920 2020-12-13 16:35:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> Actually telling me there was no Fraud?  It's laughable.  Getting news from CNN?
1338039614989221888 2020-12-13 16:34:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BoAxel2 After this let them pack the court.  Why not? What we have right now is a worthless bunch of cowards except for two of them.
1338039263158444032 2020-12-13 16:33:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy Since you don't know what you are talking about don't make ignorant statements. There is overwhelming evidence of fraud.  Case was not about Fraud.  Stop tweeting misinformation
1338038836367040514 2020-12-13 16:31:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy You obviously did not read the suit and you don't know what your talking about!! The Case was about constitutional law and those states broke it.  Not hearing it was not because there was no fraud.  There WAS FRAUD.  They did not hear it due to standing. Tons of evidence of fraud
1338037657838895109 2020-12-13 16:26:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> I don't think Supreme Court Judges should get to keep their jobs forever unless there is a way to impeach them without it taking tons of red tape etc.  Amy Coney Barrett lied on her job interview.  She lied to the President and to the Senate and the American people.
1338036371135496193 2020-12-13 16:21:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LilaGraceRose Amy Coney Barrett who claims to be Catholic and Pro life lied to our Senators and to our Pro Life President.  Yesterday when she refused to hear the Texas case along with 19 other states. She put the lives of millions of Pre born babies in danger and our religious liberties.
1338034102172229633 2020-12-13 16:12:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MissWinMa So sad.  The last one nominated, Amy Coney Barrett was the biggest liar of all.  "I love and will always uphold the Constitution"   She lied to the senate and to the President.
1338033091479097344 2020-12-13 16:08:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ToneNewEra @DJVadim @realDonaldTrump Democrats are nothing but despicable liars.  The Anti God Party.  Party that supports aborting babies in the womb all the way to birth and infanticide.  of course they going to keep lying and denying blatant Fraud.  We have proof and they still deny.  Democrat liars and thieves.
1338032479890857989 2020-12-13 16:06:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RPatriot77 I hope he had better advisers now.
1338032221911846916 2020-12-13 16:05:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RPatriot77 @Matthew_4_Trump Not we.  You mean cowardly snake Republicans.
1338031596625018883 2020-12-13 16:02:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoelBeRowdy NO she did not do her job.  You're only saying that because she defended Fraud and illegal crimes against constitution.  Anything else she would do you'd say she didn't do her job because your a big liberal and you support fraud.  She did not uphold the constitution.  She lied.
1338030305479852033 2020-12-13 15:57:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NRodibaugh @Scotus Is there an actual authentic twitter account for SCOTUS?  the one you tweeted to above is a news feed about SCOTUS.  I'd love to tell them how I feel about them.
1338029397312356352 2020-12-13 15:54:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 @Barnes_Law She's a snake!
1338028544958451713 2020-12-13 15:50:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LivePDDave1 @raiden991 They make me want to throw up.
1337998861520883712 2020-12-13 13:52:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> Amy Coney Barrett is deceitful. She said she'd uphold constitution! She's a liar!   Shame on her!  She needs prayer! Shame on the other two traitors Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.  I don't care if they pack the US Supreme court any more.  Pack it and make those three snakes irrelevant.
1337997108708708355 2020-12-13 13:45:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> As a practicing Catholic I am very hurt that Amy Coney Barrett lied to the Senate, the President and the American people by Claiming to be Catholic yet yesterday her refusal to hear a case has put more unborn babies in danger and has caused danger to our religious liberties.
1337995317329870848 2020-12-13 13:38:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> Yes the 3 cowardly newly appointed Justices did vote for churches, however by their refusal to hear the Texas case along with 19 other states proves that they really don't care about your religious rights or pro life.  They will never overturn Roe vs Wade.  Weak, cowardly rats.
1337994770761707522 2020-12-13 13:36:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> Regarding the US Supreme court, I had a gut feeling that the 3 cowardly Justices President Trump nominated would betray him.  We already saw Gorsuch and Kavanaugh vote with the liberals months ago.  I sensed Amy Coney Barrett was fickle. Basically all 3 are Cowards/backstabbers.
1337980480264708096 2020-12-13 12:39:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They won't let us speak freely in the public square which is social meida.  We need to pick landmarks in our cities and meet and congregate, speak freely as to what we are going to do to get our freedom back in this country.  What's the plan?  We can't stay in our homes.
1337976905832644609 2020-12-13 12:25:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We need to get out of the house.  The lock downs and curfews are to keep us divided and separated.  We need to have meeting places in our cities so we can discuss our options.
1337975203150741504 2020-12-13 12:18:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Is there a back up plan?  Are we meeting in town halls, parks, convention centers?  We need to congregate.  Covid is an attempt to divide us, separate us.  Our Votes won't free us because our elections are stolen, rigged.  We can't trust Twitter to unite us.  Whats the plan?
1337973418050768899 2020-12-13 12:11:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The Left Democrats attempting to steal control of the  Military have been saying they put us on a LIST.   They already have Media, FBI, DOJ in their pocket.  What are they planning to do to Americans on that LIST?  First take away Americans 1st amendment then what is their plan?
1337971307439218689 2020-12-13 12:03:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @aTeXan575 @TRUMPMOMENTS411 What's this about?
1337971012256714753 2020-12-13 12:02:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> The radical Far left Socialist communist attempting to steal power and take control of the Military have said they put us on a list.  What does this mean?  I take this as a threat.  It scares me and should scare every American.   What are they planning to do with that list?
1337970382712664064 2020-12-13 11:59:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President, the Left Democrats have threatened us and said they are putting us on a list   They have no problem aborting children in the womb all the way to birth and then infanticide.  What do they plan on doing to us born on the list?  Protect us from them.
1337968100520562689 2020-12-13 11:50:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @F_ScottinTexas @pvtjokerus @JaneyEJones857 Do we have a choice?  Either that or they take away everything and put us in concentration camps. They already threatened us and told us we were on lists.
1337967062300258304 2020-12-13 11:46:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @USATRUMPMAN1 That's a long 15 days.
1337966034976849922 2020-12-13 11:42:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump People who don't know what communism is need to do some research.  Stop calling it Socialism equals Communism.  It is dangerous.  Democrat Party is dangerous, vicious, immoral.   Can't let them take power.
1337958232342421511 2020-12-13 11:11:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> Left is going to tax the hell out of us and will raise property taxes and sales taxes so high nobody will be able to afford real estate, personal Property This is how they will implement communism. Property will no longer be yours if you can't pay the taxes   And no 1st amendment
1337955200225615872 2020-12-13 10:59:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @amixpestcontrol @Matthew_4_Trump It's getting real.     Or should I say more real.

1337951280245866497 2020-12-13 10:43:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @obinagaoda I was forced to stop going to church because our Church leaders are too cowardly to fight. Closed our church doors.  Jesus does not want us to be cowards, he indeed expects us to fight for our faith.
1337950815143641089 2020-12-13 10:41:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Or hear them say "its just real estate, its just a deed".  "If you can't afford the 60% increase in new property taxes you must turn it over to the state so others can share your home"
1337950096315437058 2020-12-13 10:38:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CinderellaRx I've had 3 of blue check mark trolls chime in on my timeline to get their followers to call names too and I blocked all 3.  They think because they have blue check marks we are all impressed.  They are losers. Their blue check marks are stupid.
1337948589981462529 2020-12-13 10:32:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant We can't vote them out because our elections are RIGGED, STOLEN by the Communists in this country working with China.   Exactly why the Military needs to step in and defend the US CONSTITUTION   @realDonaldTrump
1337947986534363136 2020-12-13 10:30:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RudyCerda Gaslighting.    Stupid dumb liberals used it on CNN and their puppet zombie viewers use it all the time now.
1337942071022260224 2020-12-13 10:07:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I hope our men and women in the military have a plan to save our country.  Voting does not count any more.  Our votes are cancelled and will be in every future election.   If our winning votes cannot stop Tyranny  we have a big problem...
1337940566437363713 2020-12-13 10:01:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant There are approximately 80 million of us who've had our votes stolen. Why can't all 80 Million of us impeach them?
1337940126907830276 2020-12-13 09:59:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I gained 10 lbs because my gym was closed.  Finally doing isometrics and walking more.  I had a great gym work out routine those bast^rds closed our gyms down.    They want us weak!   They want us unhealthy.   Covid is the Flu.
1337939624891596800 2020-12-13 09:57:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> What happened to TREASON???  Our Country does not prosecute any more for Treason?  Is it just a word that means nothing?

1337938672381882370 2020-12-13 09:53:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Can we the people all 80 Million of us who voted for our President see that the Judges who were too lazy and cowardly to hear the Texas case are impeached.  Surely this many of us can impeach these Judges!    ?
1337938160710402049 2020-12-13 09:51:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> Look at what the US Supreme Court did to our Country!  Think about what they did!  Outright refused to hear a case with merit because they say 1 state (Texas) out of 19 had no standing! What about the other States who were screwed over? They are just too Cowardly and Lazy to hear
1337937502091407361 2020-12-13 09:48:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile @Cindy58130871 Jill Biden gives me the creeps.  She's just as creepy and Joe.
1337936619966353408 2020-12-13 09:45:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> Just like "Justice" John Roberts did, Kavanaugh, Barrett and Gorsuch all lied to the President and Senate and said they follow the Constitution and love the Constitution.   I wish I never supported any of them.    THEY LIED!
1337935768593997825 2020-12-13 09:41:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ksorbs They quarantine healthy people in Communist Countries.   The Left in America are following the playbook Of Communist China!  It will get worse if Biden illegally seizes power of our Military.
1337935146901594113 2020-12-13 09:39:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> The US Supreme Court Judges are too lazy to hear the most important case in the History of this Country.   They are Lazy and good for nothing.   Probably working out of the house in their pajamas because of Covid.
1337934172694872064 2020-12-13 09:35:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> Judges who rule from the bench by creating law are breaking the law.  Activist Judges who make their left wing political rulings based on Politics to help the Communist Democrat party should be arrested by the US Military.    TREASON

Proof was submitted.  They (all the courts) refuse to hear a case.   Go tell your lies to your Democrats.  I did not ask to tweet with you.   Democrat Party is evil.   End abortion!

1337927694558720001 2020-12-13 09:09:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal They just want to eliminate business across America so we can turn into a 3rd world country and end up like Venezuela.

"no standing"  That's total BS.   They are just worthless cowards.    We no longer need them.   I had doubts about Coney Barrett.  She's a fake.
1337925808069873664 2020-12-13 09:02:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Cindywegscheid2 The fact that there are people like you who support abortion of babies in the womb all the way to birth and infanticide is scary.   Now run along and stop trolling me.
1337912252318375937 2020-12-13 08:08:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> Count only legal votes and President Trump wins in a landslide They won't allow signature audits or forensics auditing of machines, ballots because they cheated.   Bottom line.  @realDonaldTrump

They betrayed the United States Constitution and the American people who's votes were stolen.   Please declare Martial Law and audit the votes for signatures and audit machines.  Have military supervise.

1337613806541787137 2020-12-12 12:22:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> The left is giving themselves away on Twitter.  The Trolling, name calling and harassment from the Left communists on Twitter can give you an idea how they harass, threaten politicians, Judges.   These people are horrible evil monsters.

I wish I could say something to them and tell them what I think of them.  To be honest I had a feeling Barrett would betray him but not all 3.  Wow!  what horrible people.

1337589124111339523 2020-12-12 10:44:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @realDonaldTrump They are terrible I agree but they are cowards.  He did not know they would betray him.
1337588079352156160 2020-12-12 10:40:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @realDonaldTrump huh?  Are you blaming him?   SCOTUS and RINOS caused the steal but our fight is not over.
1337584818767314948 2020-12-12 10:27:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jsutherland53 @adamkelsey @TexasGOP Get lost !
1337584356823425025 2020-12-12 10:25:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Declare Martial Law, audit the ballots, signature verification.  Audit the dominion machines.   Bring in Military to supervise or redo elections.
1337575731921002497 2020-12-12 09:51:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> No more stimulus bills
1337574775946846209 2020-12-12 09:47:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> The US Supreme Court is useless.  They went against the law of the land (our constitution) and destroyed the country.    Go ahead and pack the courts.  They are irrelevant now.
1337572400850817024 2020-12-12 09:38:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 Cowards and backstabbers

1337549389137514496 2020-12-12 08:06:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump YES SECESSION  President Trump won the election on 11/3/2020 The rest is FRAUD
1337548316985282560 2020-12-12 08:02:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @marklevinshow Will these lead to civil war?
1337533788130140160 2020-12-12 07:04:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @VickiLynn47 @RealCandaceO Yes but they should still be aware.   I read the suit and it also includes affidavits of fraud.....
1337529060512022529 2020-12-12 06:45:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealCandaceO Are the Attorneys informing the US Supreme Court Judges about this blatant withholding of evidence in GA?
1337528638913200128 2020-12-12 06:44:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AmyMek Are the Supreme Court Judges working from home in their pajamas because of the Covid excuse?   I wonder what time they get up in the morning and what time they start working?   Noon?
1337527675343101953 2020-12-12 06:40:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RedJonesAmerica @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @GeoffDuncanGA @GaSecofState I think Kemp is going to need a really good attorney because he is going to have serious legal problems regarding his actions.
1337524562972475397 2020-12-12 06:28:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AmyMek They either want to do their due diligence and accept the case, hear the case or they don't.
1337518689386594304 2020-12-12 06:04:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump If the Supreme Court is too incompetent to uphold the United States Constitution it is time to bring in the Military.
1337516238159822849 2020-12-12 05:54:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg @SexCounseling Lose Moral Authority?   With who?   Not with half the country.  The people losing moral authority are the politicians and courts who are willing to go along with this coup
1337493738000588801 2020-12-12 04:25:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg @SexCounseling It will be too late to wait.  We've waited long enough.  There is overwhelming evidence of fraud but they don't care. They even go as far as hiding the fraud and not allowing proper audits.  Trump won.   Biden Cheated.
1337493239213957120 2020-12-12 04:23:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SexCounseling YES

1337340239501639681 2020-12-11 18:15:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Kjaerringa @realDonaldTrump Oh no.  Texas did not do the same thing.  Texas did not change laws without legislators.  Now your just making stuff up.    Stop.
1337332993195589632 2020-12-11 17:46:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Kjaerringa @realDonaldTrump Actually the 4 states being sued broke constitutional law so you don't know what your talking about and you either did not read the lawsuit or you can't understand it.   If they rule if favor of Texas will you be saying the same thing?
1337329627438563331 2020-12-11 17:33:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GeorgePapa19 @margmulc12 Yes please!
1337328777144139776 2020-12-11 17:30:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PanhandleExit Yes and this is why Section 230 needs to be repealed so that people like this woman can sue Twitter.
1337328044948606977 2020-12-11 17:27:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JTudisca @Brownie55 Can we tweet the supreme court to tell them what we think about them?  Are they on Twitter?
1337327759975071744 2020-12-11 17:25:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JTudisca @Brownie55 Well then, Supreme Court needs to get to work and plan on not rushing this hearing if they even plan on getting up out of bed to get some work done and hear the case.  I think they are being lazy.
1337327376796041216 2020-12-11 17:24:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JTudisca @Brownie55 US Supreme Court website says Supreme court closed to the public?  Whats that mean?  Are they doing zoom hearings? unbelievable!  A nation of lazy people is what we are becoming.  Lazy Judges
1337320559227465728 2020-12-11 16:57:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump What really makes my blood boil is hearing these Democrats say "prove it"   That's something criminals say after they commit a crime.  The Governors of these states would not allow us to prove it because they refused signature audits.
1337315446928801792 2020-12-11 16:37:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EmeraldRobinson @TIME How do these trashy magazines stay in business?  Who buys them?

1337308562775654400 2020-12-11 16:09:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWesterhoff @realDonaldTrump You don't even know what an affidavit is.
1337308379404853249 2020-12-11 16:08:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWesterhoff @realDonaldTrump You don't know anything about law.  Affidavits are legally binding.   Please Stop.
1337258838559399936 2020-12-11 12:52:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWesterhoff @realDonaldTrump There is overwhelming proof.  You're just ignoring it. Over 1000 affidavits alone is proof.   We've also already proved Dominion machines fraudulently gave thousands of Trump votes to Biden.  Have you read the Affidavits?  Watched all the hearings?   The fraud is real.

1337254618632359936 2020-12-11 12:35:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWesterhoff @realDonaldTrump If really you watch them all then you'd know there is massive fraud and if you can do the math... You can figure out that move ballots were sent in that there were voters.  If you deny all this fraud you are just being dishonest.....  Read the constitution regarding legislators.
1337251158000189442 2020-12-11 12:21:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWesterhoff @realDonaldTrump Stop watching CNN

1337248962277883904 2020-12-11 12:12:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWesterhoff @realDonaldTrump You don't get to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who voted for President Trump with your fake ballots, dominion counting machines and kicking observers out of counting rooms.  You cheated!!  Fraud does not elect Presidents.  Biden Cheated.
1337248505245548544 2020-12-11 12:11:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @donnahartfield5 @realDonaldTrump Overwhelming evidence has already been shown.   Stop watching CNN

1337247726438764549 2020-12-11 12:07:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Then they stole our election with the help of China, Dominion machines, counterfeit ballots.  Counting ballots in secret, kicking out observers.  They want POWER.  What will they do with it?
1337246586091438080 2020-12-11 12:03:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWesterhoff @realDonaldTrump You obviously did not read the lawsuit and you have no knowledge of our US Constitution and it's laws.  sovereign states do not get to break the laws of the United States Constitution.   You're tweeting misinformation.
1337245447883091968 2020-12-11 11:58:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MilionMagaMarch Have security with you.  Don't stay alone after the event.  Stay together.   Democrat Antifa are dangerous.

1337240812418002944 2020-12-11 11:40:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Buzz_Access @realDonaldTrump Overwhelming Fraud has already been proven. Newest lawsuit regards blatant violation of the US constitution.  Stop watching CNN.
1337238008064401409 2020-12-11 11:29:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MunchPhd President Trump will remain our President no matter what the US Supreme Court says.   Biden is a Fraud

1337234807990878208 2020-12-11 11:16:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Rottinghaus_P @realDonaldTrump Wrong.  Dominion ballots are fake.   You're not good at math.
1337234082648915968 2020-12-11 11:13:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @janriley23 @realDonaldTrump It was stolen.  There is overwhelming evidence of Fraud. Not to mention observers being kicked out and ballots counted in secret.  You don't get to do that in America.   You lost.   You support Fraud.
1337233551876448257 2020-12-11 11:11:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Rottinghaus_P @realDonaldTrump He will have power and he will have 85 million Americans who voted for him supporting him.   You can't win a presidential election by Fraud and breaking constitutional law.
1337232393132904449 2020-12-11 11:07:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Christi90711921 @realDonaldTrump Stay out of this.  You're not an American, you're from Canada.  Stay out of our elections.
1337232108947828740 2020-12-11 11:05:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WINDOCTORRX US Supreme court needs to uphold the US Constitution and let the Legislators of the states decide who their electoral votes will go to or if they will not cast votes.  Peace can only be granted if the US Supreme court sides with Texas and upholds the United States Constitution.
1337229302627061760 2020-12-11 10:54:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cmunson44 Exactly!
1337229013777932289 2020-12-11 10:53:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FeliciaHardcas2 @realDonaldTrump There is overwhelming evidence of Fraud.  Proof actually.   STOP.   No more lies...
1337228652526804993 2020-12-11 10:52:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why are so many non Americans from Canada, UK and China coming into my timeline all mad and spewing hate because I support my President and I support my constitution.   They need to stay out of this fight.  They are not even Americans.   What's up with that?  Weird!!
1337227250081484800 2020-12-11 10:46:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @debegraham @realDonaldTrump Nope. You're wrong.
1337224394091896833 2020-12-11 10:35:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LeftCoastWords @realDonaldTrump The American people and 80 million who voted for our President won't let that happen.....  If anyone is going to prison it's Joe Biden and his son.
1337223164691062787 2020-12-11 10:30:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> My prayer worked wonders.  It's always good to do a little exorcism every once in a while.
1337222821122985984 2020-12-11 10:28:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LeftCoastWords @realDonaldTrump Are you for real?  LOL
1337222423343636481 2020-12-11 10:27:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> Whatever I said tonight really upset the Left wing hateful, uneducated, immoral mob!   Basically just tweeted that Constitution must be upheld.   Trump is my President until 2024   Counterfeit ballots do not elect Presidents.
1337216093601951749 2020-12-11 10:02:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump God Bless President Trump.    Saint Michael the Archangel deliver us from evil and protect our President and protect the USA and protect unborn babies.  https://t.co/obkHCplpPX
1337215601920462849 2020-12-11 10:00:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> Saint Michael pray for USA and protect us from Evil.  https://t.co/IWeJxSau7T
1337209996669407232 2020-12-11 09:38:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> The people who are trolling you one after another with fake Twitter accounts and 5 followers are the very same people who cheated in the elections.
1337209364214472704 2020-12-11 09:35:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> All the Trolls you see coming into your Timeline and calling you names for supporting your President give you an idea of how many came out with their counterfeit ballots and committed this fraud.  You can see how they operate by paying attention to Twitter.
1337208260760223746 2020-12-11 09:31:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> At this point all Liberal Communist Trolls on twitter can do is call names.  So sad to see how many ignorant uneducated immoral Liberals there are on Twitter.
1337206559391141888 2020-12-11 09:24:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> I'm having fun blocking trolls.  Bring it on.
1337205994414170112 2020-12-11 09:22:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> So many trolls are on twitter like never before.  I've been on since 2009 and have never experienced this many trolls with fake accounts.  IGNORE THEM
1337205267159629825 2020-12-11 09:19:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Leo4Superbowl @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews When that happened I stopped all daytime and only two shows at night on Fox.
1337204270790144002 2020-12-11 09:15:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Never concede!  We will not accept this fraud COUP take over of our country.  Whatever state you move to that house will be the NEW WHITE HOUSE.    We will not accept a FRAUDULENT PRESIDENT BIDEN   US CONSTITUTION IS LAW OF THE LAND AND MUST BE OBEYED.
1337203656530137089 2020-12-11 09:12:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> If Socialist Communist take over America their will no longer be a US Supreme Court.   Study communism.
1337202867317264384 2020-12-11 09:09:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump NEVER CONCEDE Mr. President.  If they steal the White House, we will always recognize you as the legitimate President.  We will NEVER accept the MASSIVE FRAUD COUP that took place.  NEVER
1337201355463659521 2020-12-11 09:03:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @adryenn Truck drivers need to deliver these ballots to the US Supreme Court Judges because we are sick of hearing "no evidence"  Let them look at all 500,000 fake ballots.  How much evidence to they want?  https://t.co/Oc1AZIptoJ
1337200277951107079 2020-12-11 08:59:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Yes, Before the election because of Chris Wallace many stopped watching @foxnews before the election and it just spiraled when they betrayed the country on election night.
1337199843307999239 2020-12-11 08:57:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump And those 19 states will continue to fight for us if they give a Communist Socialist Joe Biden illegitimate power of the United States of America.  Supreme Court does not have the last word but the people do.

1337187272966344706 2020-12-11 08:07:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Elena77493 Do they watch news?  I hope they are up to what's going on and not watching CNN

That's why. Any other lies you want to bring up?
1337172706400169984 2020-12-11 07:09:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GIMilner @jik447 @ArgyleWolf @kylegriffin1 That's an outright LIE.  There is overwhelming evidence/proof of massive voter fraud.  You're the one living in a fantasy world.
1337171851047407617 2020-12-11 07:06:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ruggiere_l Unfortunately that is what will happen if the US Supreme court cannot do their duty to uphold the United States CONSTITUTION.
1337164736455008256 2020-12-11 06:38:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto This may very well lead to a Civil war if they allow this Fraud to succeed.
1337164588509360128 2020-12-11 06:37:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto Someone tell the Supreme Court to pay attention!!!!
1337164407005069312 2020-12-11 06:36:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @leeat55 @ChuckCallesto Sad it took them this long.  They didn't even start investigating until a few days ago.
1337155584735342592 2020-12-11 06:01:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg @realDonaldTrump I've been praying constantly.    Its in God's hands but either way this turns out we must keep fighting.
1337155114360918016 2020-12-11 05:59:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mariclejr @BertmcdRm @realDonaldTrump They did more than cheat.  They worked with China to over throw our country.  Massive election fraud well planned.  US Supreme Court is feckless and we can't trust them.  They legalized abortion and slavery.   We need Martial Law.  Military needs to supervise new election
1337153784909205504 2020-12-11 05:54:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @StevenDJBaumann @realDonaldTrump Wrong! Blatant Fraud, kicking observers out of buildings, counting rooms, counting ballots in secret is an invasion.
1337153422450073600 2020-12-11 05:53:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GIMilner @jik447 @ArgyleWolf @kylegriffin1 Counterfeit ballots, Foreign machines switching votes, kicking observers out of counting rooms, violating constitutional laws by creating new laws before election without legislators subverts our republic.   We are a Republic.  We follow constitution.  You don't.
1337152702464184322 2020-12-11 05:50:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg @realDonaldTrump Kavanaugh and Gorsuch have already both voted with Liberals in past cases on Supreme Court.  I think they are too afraid to do what is right.
1337149393514840065 2020-12-11 05:37:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Sadly, you cannot trust the feckless US Supreme Court to uphold the US Constitution.  They legalized abortion and they legalized slavery.   Please declare Martial Law and demand a redo of the election with Military supervision to ensure honesty and integrity.
1337146979944603648 2020-12-11 05:27:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax  Why do you call the lawsuit against the 4 states a "long-shot" attempt to overturn FRAUD?  Not only Fraud but those 4 states broke the laws of the constitution by changing laws without Legislators.   Obeying our Constitution is a "long-shot" ?   https://t.co/tT1NxNETXA
1337127654080712705 2020-12-11 04:10:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Declare Martial law and redo the elections.  Have Military supervise so we have honest elections.  Observers were bullied, harassed, threatened and kicked out of the counting rooms.   Kicked out of the buildings.    This alone invalidates election no matter what court says.
1337116326188314630 2020-12-11 03:25:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lancegooden @realDonaldTrump They should have been investigating the clearly rampant Fraud weeks ago.  They did this to stall and run out the clock in order to elect Joe Biden.  They know he cheated.
1337113259325833217 2020-12-11 03:13:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BertmcdRm @realDonaldTrump Martial law.  Re do the election supervised by Military.   No more Fraud
1336982578620891136 2020-12-10 18:34:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BertmcdRm @realDonaldTrump If SCOTUS is too cowardly to follow the US Constitution SCOTUS will NOT have last word.  The American people will have the last word.   Will not accept this Fraud in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
1336981746957447171 2020-12-10 18:31:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JamesDoss50 @KTLA @jcoffeebean Just the fact that poll watchers were kicked out, harassed, threatened alone invalidates the election in those states.  In United States of America you do not count votes in secret.   And you don't change election rules unless you are Legislators.    Must obey US Constitution
1336978340884828160 2020-12-10 18:17:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BertmcdRm @realDonaldTrump They harassed, bullied, threatened poll watchers and counted ballots in secret.  This alone invalidates the election in those states. 1000s of affidavits.  The refuse to verify signatures.  Fake names, dead people.  So sick of these liars saying "no evidence"   🐂💩

1336969618460561408 2020-12-10 17:42:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @steveliesman Election Fraud.   Refusal to verify signatures.   Biden Lost!

1336958529698054144 2020-12-10 16:58:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> They keep saying "there's no evidence"  FBI needs to take all 500,000 of those counterfeit Biden ballots to the US Supreme Court during the hearings!  @SidneyPowell1

1336866047266181120 2020-12-10 10:51:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @twins_american I did not side with a liberal.  I don't trust the courts If they do not side with the laws of our constitution on this then President Trump has the right to declare Martial law and redo this election with military supervising.
1336854533352292352 2020-12-10 10:05:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @twins_american I still doubt the Supreme court.  I stated what their duty is. I still don't trust them. Hopefully I'm wrong.
1336849390896484357 2020-12-10 09:45:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> I read the lawsuit. Bottom line is the states violated the laws of US Constitution by making laws without the Legislators.  The Constitution is very clear on this.   It is the duty of the Supreme court to correct this violation of the US constitution and Legislators must overturn
1336809248781582341 2020-12-10 07:05:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ik1tt3n @realDonaldTrump Where states blatantly cheated.
1336807962870915072 2020-12-10 07:00:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> How do countries get taken over by communism?  What we are seeing now.  Anyone who rejects Martial law and military supervising elections to be done LEGALLY does not care if this country goes communist.   Saying "oh that's too extreme" is stupid.   Being weak is what ends freedom
1336805985290076160 2020-12-10 06:52:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  If at any time in the history of our country Martial law was needed the most that time is now!  If elections are not redone, supervised by the Military we will never have a free election process again.   You won't be doing this for you.  Do it for our Country!
1336801580339798016 2020-12-10 06:35:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Declare Martial Law.  Military needs to supervise elections so they are done honestly.  We need to redo the elections in the states that cheated and violated our election laws.  We were not allowed to observe.  They counted in secret.   That alone invalidates.
1336801050641121280 2020-12-10 06:33:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah Bill Barr is committing Treason.
1336800307573997569 2020-12-10 06:30:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Fattiresrock @MajorPatriot Yes it is.  They cheated nationwide

1336797836671766528 2020-12-10 06:20:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MajorPatriot I think he should declare Martial law and redo the election in those states.  Those elections were illegal.
1336797236810772481 2020-12-10 06:17:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> What are the first legal steps needed in order to impeach Supreme court Judges for not enforcing our laws?  Does it start with a petition?  Does anyone know?

1336792593271648256 2020-12-10 05:59:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @evilkracker Is the US Supreme court going to continue to be arrogant and cowardly with almost have the states suing over the illegal election or are they going to do their job?

1336771026324058112 2020-12-10 04:33:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump The US Supreme Court is arrogant and has contempt for the American voters.  Our votes were cancelled.  The PA lawsuit was solid.  PA broke election laws and the Supreme Court tossed it aside without explanation.  Arrogant Supreme Court!
1336769840367845376 2020-12-10 04:29:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> God Bless you President Trump!  We pray for you daily!   The left in this country are evil.  They legalize and support abortion murder of children in the womb and infanticide.  They destroy peoples lives with lies, slander.  They are Demons!
1336768647411298304 2020-12-10 04:24:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @liquidlaugh I believe President Trump @realDonaldTrump needs to declare martial law because we have mountains of proof of Election Fraud in this election.  People were also pushed out of counting rooms.  The US Supreme court  are 9 Feckless people in black robes.
1336766139108446208 2020-12-10 04:14:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump US Supreme Court is Feckless.

Declare martial law, get the military to redo the election honestly, fairly!

We can't depend on tainted courts.    Not for yourself but for the sake of future generations of Americans please do everything in your power.
1336592610262061060 2020-12-09 16:44:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @petemorristwit @pastoralview Same with me.  I was blocking one after another.
1336591265735999488 2020-12-09 16:39:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> Corrupt Governors, Secretary of states, Judges and even the Supreme Court do NOT have the right to violate Americans voting rights. We cannot trust tainted Courts.    Please give the American people an honest election.  Declare Martial law and allow honest elections.
1336589755195170820 2020-12-09 16:33:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  There is overwhelming proof of massive Election Fraud and observers were bullied and kicked out of counting rooms. Votes counted in secret, hundreds of thousands of invalid votes found.  Please implement martial law, bring in military to redo elections honestly
1336540548451115010 2020-12-09 13:17:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Put energy into Legislators who can decertify.
1336540275498336258 2020-12-09 13:16:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> Concentrate on Legislators and support them.  US Supreme court is distraction, wasting time running out the clock.
1336532399643975681 2020-12-09 12:45:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> concentrate on state legislators electoral votes to stop the steal.  Don't let SCOTUS distract.

Need to stop the steal by concentrating on Legislative control of electoral college votes.  US Supreme Court is feckless.  Don't let them waste our energy and time.  False hope.
1336521208171413506 2020-12-09 12:01:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you think that the US Supreme Court is going to make a Just decision with the Texas case you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  They don't care about the Constitution.  They proved that today by tossing the PA case no explanation.  Just allow states to break laws.

I'm done with this.  Legislator needs to fight for electoral votes.  It's the only way to stop the steal.    SCOTUS playing games with Americans.  Shame on them!  It's disgusting!
1336510060944494594 2020-12-09 11:16:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AngelMcPatriot @Kayem623 The Supreme court is doing the same thing they did with the other lawsuit. Asking the other side to comment so they can they say they won't listen and are done.   Can't trust the US Supreme court with this.   They are playing games.
1336503880297766913 2020-12-09 10:52:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They will also go after your 4th amendment and take away private property.  Deeds to homes will be worthless.

1336447958837985283 2020-12-09 07:09:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @ruggiere_l NASDAQ and S&amp;P will collapse if we allow this election to be stolen by China and the Communist left Democrats.
1336446652442263552 2020-12-09 07:04:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Our laws no longer matter.  Constitution no longer matters.

1336445565341556738 2020-12-09 07:00:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kcinor @Best_Handgun @JTBoilerMWG @marklevinshow If the laws can be broken to the point of stealing a Presidential election and nobody does anything then why are we following any laws.  Laws no longer matter.   Integrity no longer matters in America?
1336444368194965507 2020-12-09 06:55:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto is our SCOTUS filled with nothing but worthless Cowards who refuse to enforce our laws?  Does our SCOTUS want to see a CIVIL WAR?  Why do we even need them any more?
1336440896619905025 2020-12-09 06:41:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> Are SCOTUS a bunch of cowards too?  Worthless?
1336432113961193472 2020-12-09 06:07:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @charliekirk11 This is the reason we have election fraud and China behind it.  We have people like Swalwell leaking top secret intelligence to China.
1336431030203371523 2020-12-09 06:02:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SexCounseling Communism.  China is using the Democrats to implement communism
1336426337444061184 2020-12-09 05:44:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TXAG We will never accept a Fraudulent election in America.   Thank you Texas!
1336418682184986625 2020-12-09 05:13:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @veronabyjenib @CountyofLA It's communism.  Using a virus with a 99% Survival rate to control the population.

1336417827033477121 2020-12-09 05:10:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bandmom74 China is doing this.  Using the Democrat Politicians to implement communism.  Not Socialism....  Communism.
1336417171216297984 2020-12-09 05:07:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @100Trump45 Where was there alerts and stay home orders during the Swine Flu?
1336411818999250944 2020-12-09 04:46:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Redistheway1 When they start texting your phone its a big warning sign and I'm not worried about the virus.  I'm worried about our freedoms being attacked for a virus that has a 99% survival rate.   What happened to the FLU?
1336410946697248768 2020-12-09 04:42:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Communist Democrat Trolls are out in large force on Twitter today.   That means they are worried.    It's a good sign.
1336410745764888576 2020-12-09 04:42:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> is it just me or is everyone else getting attacked by trolls on twitter today?   They must be really worried that the SCOTUS is aware of their Fraudulent election
1336410278217465856 2020-12-09 04:40:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> A virus with a 99% survival rate is being used to implement communism.  The Flu no longer exists
1336409809269080064 2020-12-09 04:38:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bandmom74 I got the same thing on my phone and just tweeted in a while ago.  Now they are sending us text messages demanding we stay in our home and wear a mask for a virus with a 99% survival rate.    This is just communism.  They are using a virus to implement communism.
1336409196888092673 2020-12-09 04:35:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto That's because these far left Judges are about to be impeached for harassing General Flynn after the President already pardoned him.   General Flynn's family should sue Judge Sullivan.

1336405181198553088 2020-12-09 04:19:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> This has gone too far!   My state just sent out an emergency alert on my phone telling me to stay home and wear a mask.   This is communism folks.   Better fight hard to get President Trump in.  https://t.co/3eVicLiQiP
1336400562649108480 2020-12-09 04:01:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Acosta Yes he did win.  This is still America.  In America you don't win a presidential election by counting votes in secret, illegally kicking out observers, bullying observers, counterfeit votes, machines that delete votes.   The evidence/proof of Fraud is OVERWHELMING
1336399740041265152 2020-12-09 03:58:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rabbit_nasty @AmyMek He forgot to mention how they bullied observers, illegally kicked observers out and boarded windows up so they could count in secret.
1336398183602089984 2020-12-09 03:52:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO May as well not do a Stimulus at this point.   Nancy Pelosi screwed over the American people and it could have been done 6 months ago but she refused because she only cares about herself.  People have already lost everything because of her.  @SpeakerPelosi
1336392909432578048 2020-12-09 03:31:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> Anyone else sense evil when these far left communist trolls come out of no where on Twitter and call you names after you send out a tweet?  There are so many wicked people on twitter.
1336392230261596160 2020-12-09 03:28:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @CherylVoss2 It's a shame our church leaders are so weak!
1336392072086003713 2020-12-09 03:27:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DC_Draino @ShawnQuinn83 General Flynn's family should sue Judge Sullivan for everything he owns and he should be impeached and not allowed to practice law.
1336391716002123778 2020-12-09 03:26:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg So basically the Democrats are saying "It's not normal to catch us cheating"?
1336390895063556098 2020-12-09 03:23:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LichenCraig Thanks for the update.  I really feel like I'm living in the twilight zone!  The courts need to just erase those fraudulent votes from those states that committed election fraud.  Let our re elected President do his job until 2024
1336389407134294016 2020-12-09 03:17:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WINDOCTORRX In America we don't elect Presidents by breaking laws, blocking observers, counting votes in secret and flooding the counting rooms with counterfeit ballots from China.
1336388934381662208 2020-12-09 03:15:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Rockprincess818 @CauseofourJoy Yep, bought and paid for some time ago.
1336388720165937152 2020-12-09 03:14:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> What's going on.  Just logged into Twitter and no news on SCOTUS yet?   Wasn't that today?
1336385373216206848 2020-12-09 03:01:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Please implement martial law and redo the elections
1336269923782283265 2020-12-08 19:22:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers If the court does the right thing (big if) and the Antifa decide to do more riots I have no doubt President Trump will bring the Law down on them within a couple hours.  Martial law and military will be removing them and putting them in Prison where they finally belong!
1336268242373935116 2020-12-08 19:15:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers God may give us one more chance.  Say a prayer tonight.  Tomorrow.  Maybe by a miracle the SCOTUS will do the right thing and stop this fraud.   I won't hold my breath

1336266358623858691 2020-12-08 19:08:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers They deserve it.  They are sending themselves there.

1336263971280568321 2020-12-08 18:58:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers They reap what they sow.
1336263674911023106 2020-12-08 18:57:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers I hope these evil politicians enjoy their wealth, gifts, power while they are here on earth because they won't be able to take it with them when they go to hell.
1336262093662691328 2020-12-08 18:51:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers Years ago Politicians could go to prison for even sympathizing with Communist and that was for a good reason.  Communism is evil.   You're right.  Today they flaunt it in our faces.   It's disgusting.
1336261543592226817 2020-12-08 18:49:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers Many if us are exhausted fighting fraud and corruption.  I've done about all I can do and now It's time to pray and leave the rest to God.  No matter how this turns out God will win in the end.

1336256937197858816 2020-12-08 18:30:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers If they allow this Fraud, COUP to be successful I am done too.   Unless our Military steps in and defends our constitution and the President declares martial law this country will be communist within 6 months.  If people think Covid-19 is crazy they have not seen anything yet.

1336237082642038785 2020-12-08 17:12:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Phyllis94584953 Pray tonight! Pray for our country and for President Donald J. Trump.   Pray that the evil fraud in this election perpetuated by the Democrats is exposed.
1336236382528839680 2020-12-08 17:09:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> Say a prayer for our country and for President Donald J. Trump.   Please say a prayer that God touches the hearts of Judges and Legislators to move them to invalidate the Fraudulent election.  We know Trump won and the evil left cheated and we have the proof.    We have to pray!

1336151891764334592 2020-12-08 11:33:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto Sidney Powell is correct.  What is happening in our country is not a free election it is a communist take over.  China is assisting the Democrat party to tear down this country.

1336146080363204608 2020-12-08 11:10:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MikeEmanuelFox @tedcruz Please tell Senator Ted Cruz the December 8th and December 14th dates are flexible.  The constitution only dictates the Jan 20th date.  He should know this.  When he spoke tonight he kept emphasizing those dates as if they were not flexible.
1336135541629177856 2020-12-08 10:28:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealNotMyCircus Remember, Ted Cruz lost against Trump.  I am worried he still has some jealousy there.   I'm not sure I can trust Ted Cruz and especially when tonight he kept emphasizing we are out of time because of December 8th, 14th.  Only Jan 20th is stated in Constitutional law.
1336134998886248448 2020-12-08 10:26:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NaylorFran @realDonaldTrump @marthamaccallum Nobody is talking about what happened in Arizona today.  Legislators were out in the street speaking loudly fighting this Fraud.  They are going to decertify the fraud.  Why is nobody covering this?
1336134589232807936 2020-12-08 10:24:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> I just listened to Ted Cruz and he kept emphasizing the December 8th and December 14th date as if those dates have to be strictly held.   Constitution only dictates Jan 20th.   Can we trust Ted Cruz to make this case before the US Supreme court?

State courts consisting of communist Democrat Judges who are political activist for the Democrat party instead of enforcing laws. Corrupt Judges.  The Americans people won't let Judges or any Court allow this Fraud.

1336054751381708802 2020-12-08 05:07:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LuckyWTheStr8Rt Fox who?
1336053659424096256 2020-12-08 05:03:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won the election on 11/3/2020  What you see occurring now is a communist takeover of your country.  People with power are being blackmailed, bribed by the communist Democrat Party to go along with this outright Fraud.   The American people will never accept this
1336052175919665152 2020-12-08 04:57:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @Rosemar42894219 If the courts allow this Fraud to succeed there will not be a "peaceful" transition of power.   Constitution cannot be trashed with a fraud coup.
1336051756447350784 2020-12-08 04:55:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AngelWarrior321 @realDonaldTrump There cannot be a "peaceful" transition of power when they are stealing an election with Fraud, denying observers, counting in secret. Counterfeit ballots. Proof of Fraud.  Legislators, Judges, including the supreme court cannot force a Fraudulent takeover of USA.
1336048278337507330 2020-12-08 04:41:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Main stream Fake News Media is encouraging Antifa to attack us.
1335911029843234816 2020-12-07 19:36:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kaiaka @realDonaldTrump We only have less than two weeks left.  President can still save our country if he immediately... immediately..... fires Wray and Bill Barr.  Get someone good in there immediately who can do the job.  Has to be done swiftly.
1335910295810666496 2020-12-07 19:33:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is what will happen here if we let them steal this election.  Covid-19 and the election fraud was perpetuated by China and the Democrat Party.  If they steal control of this country it will go communist within months.
1335909666543476736 2020-12-07 19:30:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @vivelafra @newsmax We are running out of time.  President Trump should get a new AG in there tomorrow.  It's been over a month and Barr has done nothing!
1335909050773475329 2020-12-07 19:28:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is so sad that Bill Barr has been doing nothing and it's been over a month since the election.  He should be charged with Treason and President Trump should fire him immediately.  @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  We are almost out of time.
1335898253406085121 2020-12-07 18:45:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump needs to fire Bill Barr and get an AG in that position immediately who can do the job while there is still time.  @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
1335897819522056192 2020-12-07 18:43:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @senatemajldr
1335897253303611394 2020-12-07 18:41:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @P8R1OT Then he should resign tomorrow so President Trump can get someone in their who's not afraid to do their job.
1335896919701245952 2020-12-07 18:40:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax Who does Bill Barr use to go out and investigate?  Are they a bunch of Democrats that go out and "investigate"?
1335894189460975616 2020-12-07 18:29:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidJHarrisJr GOP House members should have demanded Bill Barr to investigate the day after the election.  They wait until now?
1335893914885128194 2020-12-07 18:28:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GodIsgo60677661 @DavidJHarrisJr Then for the good of their country they should just resign rather than destroy the country for all of us just because they are cowards
1335892991391625217 2020-12-07 18:24:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidJHarrisJr So he hasn't done anything?   What does he do?
1335892754862198784 2020-12-07 18:23:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTforAmerica Donald J. Trump
1335892289370013696 2020-12-07 18:21:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidJHarrisJr Regarding these Attorney Generals and congress people, What happens to these people when they get these positions?  Are they being blackmailed?  Bribed?  Intimidated?  Peer pressure?  What's the deal?  Why can't they be strong?
1335891727891120128 2020-12-07 18:19:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidJHarrisJr Rumor has it Bill Barr said he's planning on resigning next month.  President Trump can still save this country by firing Barr tomorrow and replacing him with someone who can do the job.  We don't have time for Bill Barr's games.  @realDonaldTrump
1335888051449384961 2020-12-07 18:05:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr  Love our President but his weakness has been allowing 2 Attorney Generals to stay on the job after betraying him and this country.  Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr both horrible Attorney Generals.
1335887156246585344 2020-12-07 18:01:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EmeraldRobinson @nytimes It's a shame Bill Barr doesn't just resign right this minute so President Trump can get someone like @JudgeJeanine Judge Jeanine in there to stop this Election fraud coup.  @realDonaldTrump President should just fire Barr tomorrow.  We don't have time.  This AG committing Treason
1335886101072936960 2020-12-07 17:57:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte @AltaConervative No.  I wish you would refer to them as Democrat Socialist Communists.  They should not be called Democrats any longer.  They are tyrant communists.
1335885762668027905 2020-12-07 17:56:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Sassychickie @drdavidsamadi If the coward Governors, legislators or courts allow this outright Election fraud these communist dictator Democrats are going to take away deeds to peoples homes.  It's going to happen and it will start within 6 months after they take power.
1335878401991720962 2020-12-07 17:26:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @aaronjcarpenter @CucuillinSkyes Yes this is big.  We keep getting tons of evidence and proof of Election fraud daily yet FAKE NEWS REPORTERS sound like parrots repeating the same mantra "there is no evidence".   Someone somewhere needs to stop this insanity and take the illegal votes away from Biden.
1335867892663894017 2020-12-07 16:44:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Crose_1978 @BrianKempGA @KLoeffler @atlpressclub @POTUS @RepDougCollins @LLinWood @SidneyPowell1 What is Brian Kemp hiding?   Please investigate Brian Kemp and his Secretary of state.  There must be a reason they don't want to call a special session.   Perhaps they don't want to get caught?
1335858407585140736 2020-12-07 16:07:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DCfegan @realDonaldTrump We pray daily to God to expose this corruption and fraud.  Keep praying.    Democrat Party is evil.
1335858012586528770 2020-12-07 16:05:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HartshipJ Nothing.
1335857830444691457 2020-12-07 16:05:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @drdavidsamadi That's what I have been asking!  The flu is also deadly to elderly or those with other illnesses.  It appears they are counting the flu as Covid-19
1335806322059608072 2020-12-07 12:40:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The left is trying really hard to start a real civil war in this country.
1335805409492230150 2020-12-07 12:36:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @GeoffDuncanGA We are so disgusted with this Fraudulent election!  Mr. President you won in large numbers.  If This Georgia Governor endorses this Fraud and Supreme court stops this Fraud we must prosecute this Governor immediately.  Please bring in martial law and full force of the military
1335794097852858368 2020-12-07 11:51:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @teresalhrab @BrianKempGA @KLoeffler @atlpressclub @GaSecofState Brian Kemp is going to need a really good Attorney.
1335790981946339330 2020-12-07 11:39:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SherryMAGA @JamesDoss50 No!
1335789601160491010 2020-12-07 11:33:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> In the United States of America you do not get to count votes in secret.  You can't physically push out observers and every ballot must be legal.   Physically kicking out observers invalidates the election in those states.  You need to stick to being a "singer/actress"
1335788966100967425 2020-12-07 11:31:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> Wrong!  We are witnessing Tyranny from the left Democrat Communist Party.   President Trump is a wonderful President and he will be our President for another 4 years.  In USA we only count legal Votes.
1335787035575996416 2020-12-07 11:23:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> Yes we have overwhelming evidence of Election fraud but lets remember this:  Observers in swing states were physically kicked out and not allowed to observe which automatically invalidates those elections.   They were not allowed to count in secret.    You can't do that in USA
1335786079375355905 2020-12-07 11:19:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CBS_Herridge @misspete64 @DNI_Ratcliffe I have absolutely no respect for Durham any more and could care less what he's doing at this point.  He should have prosecuted these criminals BEFORE the Election.  Same goes with AG Bill Barr! They withheld truth from Americans before the elections.  That's just Treason!

1335784110720086016 2020-12-07 11:12:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ernieHHI @Lisa2HM @gatewaypundit Not only is hiding ballots under the table illegal but counting them in secret violates election law.  Not to mention they scanned them multiple times into the Dominion foreign counting machine.
1335782681007648768 2020-12-07 11:06:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sarahgoughy Fake news is abusing we the people.   What is in that video you are tweeting is not abuse.  It's freedom of speech and the Bully Media does not call our elections  The media is abusing us and encouraging Antifa to physically attack us.     Your tweet is a lie.
1335782317613182976 2020-12-07 11:04:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @brianstelter You the liberal fake media are the one who are abusing us.  You the Media are abusing us with your lies and disrespect.  You are abusing us when you are encouraging Antifa to physically attack us.

1335781383344570370 2020-12-07 11:01:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JeMari81 Thank you for the follow back  😃
1335781058034352129 2020-12-07 10:59:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ringinabell @dedelouwho532 @JedediahBila No, it's because they are use to cheating and they didn't think this fraud would be contested and looked at this carefully.  Besides hiding those ballots  under the table they violated several other election laws.
1335779971827023881 2020-12-07 10:55:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump And now they violated Federal Law cheating with Chinese Counterfeit ballots and Foreign ballot counting software/machines. Observers kicked out and votes counted in Secret alone invalidates election  President Trump needs to implement marshal law.    Fraud must be prosecuted.
1335778971913388034 2020-12-07 10:51:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden You cheated and the election is being contested.  You were already caught red handed on video cheating in GA.  Observers in swing states were kicked out and not allowed to observe which automatically invalidates those elections.   This is a Republic and you can't count in secret.
1335777177099366400 2020-12-07 10:44:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dedelouwho532 @JedediahBila They were not standard.  They were suitcases with wheels full of counterfeit ballots hidden under a table and pulled out and counted in VIOLATION OF SEVERAL ELECTION LAWS.
1335775955499900928 2020-12-07 10:39:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealRLimbaugh They denied observers.  That alone invalidates the election in those states where they counted in secret.
1335775608580653057 2020-12-07 10:38:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JeMari81 You never followed me back.  follow back and I will answer that question.
1335768374123536384 2020-12-07 10:09:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @drdavidsamadi Why are younger and healthy Americans being forced quarantine instead of those older and vulnerable and the sick?

He is just stalling and trying to run out the clock.   He is NOT sincere!    Going on a TV show to make himself appear to be on our side.
1335724309730316288 2020-12-07 07:14:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter won't let me read timelines.  When scrolling down to read timeline tweets you can't retweet because Twitter keeps moving it back to the top of the timeline.   Anyone else noticing this?   Twitter is doing a lot of secret dirty tricks to stop us from retweeting.

1335722906186252288 2020-12-07 07:08:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BrianKempGA @IngrahamAngle @KLoeffler @Perduesenate You are being deceptive.  You go on a TV show to reaffirm what you already said.  What you need to do is call a special session of the legislature but you are stalling on purpose because you are NOT sincere.
1335721086789402624 2020-12-07 07:01:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> How many people have died from heart attacks, other diseases brought on by the enormous stress from forced lock downs?   Mental health and Physical health.  I'm so sick of hearing these Doctors, Nurses with big egos coming on Twitter bragging about their "essential frontline job"
1335716753230319616 2020-12-07 06:44:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LLinWood @edmcbain1 Espeically Governor Kemp @BrianKempGA and Governor Doug Ducey @dougducey   Both traitors and they are violating Federal and local laws.

1335714696268140544 2020-12-07 06:36:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Craig_A_Spencer Thank you for your update.  You get paid a lot of money to do your "essential job" at 4 AM on the "frontline"   With that said what about the other physical and mental diseases people are dying from due to lock downs?    Do people no longer die from the flu during flu season?
1335713355651170306 2020-12-07 06:30:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @ScottAdamsSays  And kicking Republicans out and denying transparency itself on day one of the counting is Fraud.
1335711925632524289 2020-12-07 06:25:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump With that said there is overwhelming evidence of fraud and those liberal Judges who refused to hear cases and refused to acknowledge blatant fraud should be arrested by the US Military.
1335711083194007552 2020-12-07 06:21:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump If the Cowardly Republican Legislators or the Supreme court does not fix this the Americans who voted for you will fix it.    This Fraud will not be accepted.
1335709830103756800 2020-12-07 06:16:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump These Governors should have never allowed foreign companies to count our votes in the first place.   The Republican Governors who have certified these votes have committed treason.

They just rode in on President's coat tails.  Without him they would have just lost.   I am shocked that they are not fighting for him.

I know you can see my tweet.   Are you fighting for President Trump?  What have you done or will you do about the election fraud?  You said nothing tonight.  Please answer the question.

1335186394096967684 2020-12-05 19:36:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CBSSacramento What is your point in this ridiculous video?  You defend Gavin Newsom and shame a Sheriff who contacted Covid just because the Sheriff is not a Tyrant like Newsom.   Report truth.   What is the mortality rate of Covid?    You can catch it outdoor dining but not Walmart?
1335179893269655556 2020-12-05 19:11:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ABC Why don't you report truth?  He's even closing OUTDOOR dining.  Why is Walmart, Target, Costco allowed to be open.   People are sick of media lies.   Even Democrats are getting sick of this.
1335178207981531137 2020-12-05 19:04:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal The Doctors and Nurses are pushing for this because they are lazy.  Doctors and Nurses want shut downs so they don't have to deal with patients.  California has always had overwhelming time frames in hospitals in past Winter Years.
1335176582579671040 2020-12-05 18:57:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GretaLWall Not true.  Hospitals are not at that capacity.  We've had over crowded ICU's in past years and never had lockdowns like this.  Gavin Newsom and the Democrats are working with Communist China to destroy this country.
1335175885620559872 2020-12-05 18:55:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Why are Walmart, Target, Costco and other big corporations allowed to stay open?  Gavin Newsom is going after small business owners.  This is an example of what to expect nation wide if Democrats steal this election.
1335172285351612416 2020-12-05 18:40:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Time for President Trump to implement marshal law and arrest these Governors, Mayors who are violating the US Constitution. In swing states have military conduct new elections.

1335163582321815552 2020-12-05 18:06:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mpg25mary This was well planned and coordinated.  Communist China assisted the Democrat Socialist party in this.

1335162838558470145 2020-12-05 18:03:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump This appears to be the end of the Constitution in America.  If Democrat communists are successful with this coup, within a few months worse things than lockdowns will begin.  Once they steal our votes and seize power their hostility will magnify enormously. Tyranny escalates.

If citizens do not comply there will be huge fines and arrests. Property will be seized.

If election is stolen, communism will soon follow.  Similar happened in Venezuela.
1335158556815847425 2020-12-05 17:46:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @snowstorm1944 I have no doubt that even many wealthy elites (celebrities) who never thought it would affect them will lose their wealth with new laws, unusual tax codes. We will see far more unusual things happen that Covid-19 and lockdowns.  Things will escalate. Covid will be an excuse.
1335157560031133696 2020-12-05 17:42:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Theassamihippie I hope and pray not but lately have a gut feeling perception that if they succeed we will see worse things than Covid-19 and lockdowns. It will escalate.  Communist China is behind the scenes helping achieve this.   I feel it.
1335155055104839680 2020-12-05 17:32:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> If the Democrat (Socialist Communists) succeed in stealing this election I predict within 6 months of their control that Americans will begin losing property rights. This will be accomplished using covid and taxation. Middle class will be eliminated.  Many wealthy lose everything

1334667687859953666 2020-12-04 09:15:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidJHarrisJr Perhaps Bill Barr should make a statement then?  Where is he?  We see Fraud daily and he's doing nothing.

You showed weakness and contempt for the Witnesses.

Where was the respect for the witnesses?  NONE!  You should at the very least apologize for your biased statement.  The Representatives had no respect.  Two even called the witnesses liars.

1334611636980600832 2020-12-04 05:33:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork @realDonaldTrump The courts and JUDGES in this country are CORRUPT and they violate the laws of the US Constitution.
1334611478247182336 2020-12-04 05:32:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork @realDonaldTrump We need to do Forensic audits in all these states.  If these Politicians or Judges (courts) refuse to hear cases, continue with their aiding and abetting Criminals in this Fraudulent Election Coup President Trump needs to implement martial law.  Judges are not above CONSTITUTION
1334610043371540481 2020-12-04 05:26:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   The American People will not accept these Feckless Politicians and Courts (Judges) who are outright trampling on our US Constitution.   We need martial law!  Judges and courts are not above the Constitution.
1334609180393492480 2020-12-04 05:23:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> Mr. President,  Please enact martial law and arrest these politicians and judges who are implicit with this massive Election Fraud.  Evidence is overwhelming.   Courts refusing to hear cases are committing treason.   We need a new election without dominion and without post office
1334606775266361344 2020-12-04 05:13:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please let us know which Republican Senators are siding with Big Tech so we can vote them OUT of office!
1334606463239553024 2020-12-04 05:12:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA What about your Attorney General?  FBI?   What are they doing?   Why do we pay taxes to go to these agencies?  How do we know they are not tampering with the ballots while all this is going on?
1334605248594206720 2020-12-04 05:07:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Implement Martial Law. Force a new election.  No Politicians or JUDGES (Courts) have the right to spit on our constitution.   We the people will not accept this FRAUD!
1334602348736335877 2020-12-04 04:56:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @YorkieSpace @TrumpWarRoom @BreitbartNews It's difficult finding honest places to get news.  You have to search for it.
1334602261805191169 2020-12-04 04:55:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @YorkieSpace @TrumpWarRoom @BreitbartNews I use to get up in the morning and always go to the drudge report for years.  Drudge sold out and turned left so then I would somewhat go to Foxnews website until they turned left.  I recently last several months started going to Breitbart and now had to stop.  Too much betrayal
1334601339549061120 2020-12-04 04:52:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Nicogat1 @RumorFlies She's talking the same way as yesterday and she was not slurring.    Enough!
1334599950089351168 2020-12-04 04:46:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal Democrats don't want to advance.  They want to go back to horse and buggy days.
1334482917196611590 2020-12-03 21:01:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 You won't get a pass!  Presumption is also a sin.
1334482539214303232 2020-12-03 21:00:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 No,  and I don't have long hair and I have no idea what a Letter jacket is.
1334482147600519169 2020-12-03 20:58:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 Why do you support evil politicians?   Do you not care about your soul?   What are you going to say to God when he asks you why you supported Politicians who murder the innocent in the womb?
1334480286852075521 2020-12-03 20:51:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 No, whats sad  is someone like you who supports an evil party that legalizes and supports murdering children in the womb.
1334479306618101760 2020-12-03 20:47:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 Are you saying you're Catholic?  If you are then your a fake Catholic and your a heretic.  If you do not follow teachings of the church you are a heretic.
1334479006142357504 2020-12-03 20:46:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 Oh I've read it and I know my faith.   If you support abortion murder of children in the womb you are in mortal sin.   Don't you even tell me about my faith.  I know it and I follow it.   Democrats are evil.
1334478250857254913 2020-12-03 20:43:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bishopoftyler With our churches still shut down or mass being forced outside, rosaries in church stopped etc.  It is very hard to grow spiritually.  Our Bishops need to stand up for our faith and for the faithful.   We should not be forced out of our churches.  This has gone on too long.
1334477624739913733 2020-12-03 20:40:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bishopoftyler We need a Bishop Sheen or a Mother Angelica.  We need another Mother Teresa!
1334477020969934848 2020-12-03 20:38:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bishopoftyler We need good Bishops like you, however, how many souls lost because of lukewarm Bishops or Bishops who really should not be Bishops.....  If you know what I mean.
1334475875920699395 2020-12-03 20:33:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 I believe anyone who votes for a Democrat is in mortal sin.   If you support Democrats your evil.
1334475148980731907 2020-12-03 20:30:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lrihendry Yep, take all the Biden votes and run those through 10 times.  All the votes for Trump just run through 1 time.
1334473539890544640 2020-12-03 20:24:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 The people voted for President Donald J. Trump  President Trump won!    You support election fraud.   That makes you a Traitor.

1334471675803361280 2020-12-03 20:16:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PennyMulligan1 @SidneyPowell1 @pnjaban We need to start a new party.  The American Party.    Especially if our election is stolen by China and the Democrats.
1334471139247095808 2020-12-03 20:14:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @LLinWood @GenFlynn @abigailcfrye @DanScavino Too many republicans turning into RINOs.   We need a new Party.   "The American Party"
1334469699015385088 2020-12-03 20:09:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> What are your thoughts on what Breitbart is saying? I personally don't trust Breitbart news any more.  They seem to be turning into another Drudge.
1334468215016026112 2020-12-03 20:03:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @clarissamehler @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPChairwoman The evidence of Election Fraud is overwhelming!
1334467537170440194 2020-12-03 20:00:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @clarissamehler @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPChairwoman I think we should call our new Party The American Party
1334466854815817728 2020-12-03 19:57:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LLinWood  Thank you for all you are doing to defend our Constitution and our President.  FYI:   @breitbartnews is no longer trustworthy.  They are turning a hard left just like Drudge.
1334465424348463109 2020-12-03 19:52:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @danhill2011 @Cherub973 I know a lot of Republicans and all of them are mad as hell about this blatant fraud.     The evidence is overwhelming.     Bill Barr is sleeping on the job.  @realDonaldTrump
1334464876945686529 2020-12-03 19:49:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ritescenter @BeeNewsDaily Most of the Election Poll workers in Michigan behave the same way Cynthia Johnson does.   Cynthia Johnson is a Bully  and disregards the law.
1334464132779626498 2020-12-03 19:46:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> If our Judges all turn out to be DIRTY COWARDS and the Democrats and Communist China succeed with this Election Fraud Coup, we need to start a new Party.   Our country will already be taken over by Communists because of the cowardly Republicans in the party.  GOP will be gone!
1334462981619372032 2020-12-03 19:42:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @drdavidsamadi Merry Christmas Dr. Samadi!
1334462855697993730 2020-12-03 19:41:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Don't forget to tell everybody that Fox News Website is also fake.
1334462457947979777 2020-12-03 19:40:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 No i don't and you don't agree with me on monetary or diplomatic if you support the biggest election fraud in history.  If you support this your a communist.
1334461313498587136 2020-12-03 19:35:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte huh?  I would hope not.
1334460889722839040 2020-12-03 19:34:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 Typical Liberal Communist Democrat.   When you can't come up with facts you call names.
1334459281328930817 2020-12-03 19:27:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lynchrome @Lizzard899 In a CORRUPT Michigan court by a CORRUPT Michigan Judge!!
1334458888674926592 2020-12-03 19:26:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq It is also unacceptable for the chairman Matt Hall @RepMattHall to tell the witnesses to have respect for the representatives when those representatives intimidated disrespected the witnesses, even called them liars.    Melissa Carone gave them a taste of their own medicine.
1334456855423119360 2020-12-03 19:18:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq Isn't it illegal for a State Representative to intimidate and dox a witness?  My first thoughts were why did she ask for the witnesses maiden name and write it down?    This is why people are afraid to testify.
1334455994726768641 2020-12-03 19:14:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Ride2LiveRealtr @realDonaldTrump And if this illegal Coup is successful then what?
1334455717361668097 2020-12-03 19:13:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> China attacked the United States with Covid-19  China sent a "how to manual" to the Democrat Party in order to take away our constitutional rights using Covid-19 as an excuse!   China helped the Democrat Party financially and strategically in the biggest Election Fraud in history
1334454214810976257 2020-12-03 19:07:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SCPatriot39 You are correct.  Yes, time for martial law. We can't allow this to continue.    I don't care how these courts rule.  This is a Fraud and no corrupt courts or politicians can violate the United States Constitution.  Judges cannot spit on our constitution.
1334453479960576000 2020-12-03 19:04:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Please declare martial law and arrest these Democrat Governors, Mayors who are complicit in this Election Fraud.  This is an attack on our freedom.  A blatant attack on our US Constitution!  Evidence is Overwhelming  Hire a new AG!
1334452934520659969 2020-12-03 19:02:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 California in 2018 and 2020 used machines to steal Republican Votes in Republican strongholds.   Republicans need to stop being so stupid.  Wake up!
1334452539635290120 2020-12-03 19:00:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Our Country is being attacked by China.    China is working with the Democrat Party to bring America into Socialist Communism by enormous election Fraud with fake mail in ballots and foreign machines deleting our votes.   President Trump must declare martial law!  Hire new AG.
1334450617704611840 2020-12-03 18:53:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   End the Income Tax.   Stop taxing our income!
1334449281143513088 2020-12-03 18:47:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> If they can steal an election in order to thrust America into Socialism, Communism please sign an executive order ending the income tax.  Our tax dollars cannot go to fraud.  You  are and will remain our President.  We won't accept Fraud.  @realDonaldTrump
1334446070282129408 2020-12-03 18:35:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump needs to declare Martial Law and the Military needs to begin arresting the Democrats involved in this China-Democrat Election Fraud Coup!  @realDonaldTrump   Mr. President,  Hire a new Attorney General immediately.  Fire Chris Wray.    implement martial law
1334443135632515074 2020-12-03 18:23:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EmeraldRobinson These Michigan Legislators were ARROGANT, DISRESPECTFUL AND RUDE to the Witnesses and I was so Happy to see Melissa Carone let them have it! They had it coming!
1334442206967435266 2020-12-03 18:19:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump  US Constitution is the law of the land.  These Democrat Governors and Mayors need to be ARRESTED AND THROWN IN A MILITARY PRISON.  Mr. President, please hire a new Attorney General.  Declare MARTIAL LAW
1334441616065654791 2020-12-03 18:17:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 We need to stand up for our Constitution in this country.  NO SOCIALISM   NO COMMUNISM  ELECTION FRAUD WILL NOT BE ALLOWED.
1334441153110765568 2020-12-03 18:15:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Cuomo is EVIL and so are the people who vote for him.
1334440879172435970 2020-12-03 18:14:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 We all need to start going out and marching in the streets!!
1334440461302288385 2020-12-03 18:12:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TrumpWarRoom Has Trump War Room stopped supporting President Trump?  @BreitbartNews  Breitbart is another Drudge report.  Why are you retweeting them?    They sold out!
1334439226272694272 2020-12-03 18:07:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TrumpWarRoom Was your account hacked? Why are you attacking Lin Wood?   Breitbart by the way has turned LEFT.
1334438080401399809 2020-12-03 18:03:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Did you hear the Witness today in Michigan say the Poll workers in Michigan were racist and discriminating against white republican men. Kicking them out and arresting them.
1334436934328827904 2020-12-03 17:58:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @amy_polvadore @realDonaldTrump @JamesDoss50 The whole world saw how the Michigan Legislators intimidated, harassed and threatened the witnesses today.
1334435661001080833 2020-12-03 17:53:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @amy_polvadore @realDonaldTrump @JamesDoss50 It appears that way.  How was she elected?  Shouldn't she be arrested for this?
1334434688375480320 2020-12-03 17:49:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @amy_polvadore @realDonaldTrump @JamesDoss50 Yes, D-Rep C.A. Johnson intimidating her and asking for her maiden name.  Why?  Was she trying to get Democrats to harass her?  It was horrible how these Michigan Legislators treated the witnesses.  It was refreshing to see Melissa Carone go off on them.  They had it coming!
1334433907102470146 2020-12-03 17:46:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump @sendavidperdue @RepDougCollins I stopped going onto Breitbart's website a month ago @BreitbartNews.  Ever since google censored them they changed and and went Left.  Something happened.   Same as Drudge
1334432898770845697 2020-12-03 17:42:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> What irritates me is the Chair later told Witnesses to "have respect for the Representatives who ask questions"  Why should the witnesses have respect for a "representative that calls them Liars? Other Reps were also hostile to the witnesses.
1334428921861787649 2020-12-03 17:27:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RumorFlies She was NOT slurring.
1334427443369627648 2020-12-03 17:21:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lizzard899 Melissa Carone was very clear and coherent.  Her voice is relaxed by nature. Listening to the entire testimony she was very thorough and those Legislators were arrogant and rude to the witnesses so I'm glad Melissa gave them a taste of their own medicine.
1334425940479209472 2020-12-03 17:15:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @amy_polvadore @realDonaldTrump @JamesDoss50 They were very disrespectful to the first Witness who was on a long time.   I was happy to see Melissa Carone put them in their place.
1334424518333370369 2020-12-03 17:09:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @amy_polvadore @realDonaldTrump @JamesDoss50 Did you hear the lead Legislator tell the witnesses to have respect for the legislators even though it was the Legislators who were totally disrespectful to the witnesses and that one woman Legislator calling them liars.  Respect works both ways.
1334420919641460736 2020-12-03 16:55:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lizzard899 @Kayem623 She was smart and she was relaxed!!  She was not drunk.  Why do you even think that?   She made those legislators look like fools.
1334420158241144832 2020-12-03 16:52:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lizzard899 @Kayem623 After the way they treated and intimidated the first witness they needed to be told off.  She was Great!!  I loved her!!

1334419411306856448 2020-12-03 16:49:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ItalianGroyper1 @nebing She was hostile and asked the first witness her maiden name and then left the bench. Did she tell her friends to harass her and dox her?  Why did she want her maiden name and write it down?  What reason?
1334418745960198144 2020-12-03 16:46:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> We don't need to watch our President's speech today from Fox News website when we can watch the whole thing un interrupted without seeing your fake reporters cut in to spew their hateful propaganda!
1334417718129278976 2020-12-03 16:42:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bodacious2012 @DavidWaddell5 @lynn_weiser They were all talking through their masks while they were 30 feet away from witnesses and 10 feet away from their other legislators.  I think those Michigan Legislators looked ridiculous talking through their masks!   They are WEAK and too cowardly to do what's right!
1334417017743392768 2020-12-03 16:39:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KristinFisher   You have no talent.   You're not a reporter or a Journalist.  All you do is repeat the same old media propaganda lies.  There is OVERWHELMING evidence of huge ELECTION FRAUD and if you worked just a little bit you'd be reporting hearings in Michigan and Arizona.
1334415887533654016 2020-12-03 16:35:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KristinFisher  Have not watched Fox News for 30 days.  Starting today I wont go to your Foxnews website.  You posted Presidents speech today but instead of the speech you interrupted it with Kristin Fisher's Anti Trump rhetoric.  She also stated misinformation about Bill Barr.
1334411129456508928 2020-12-03 16:16:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidWaddell5 @lynn_weiser I think they are cowards
1334340784535965696 2020-12-03 11:36:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PamelaWwg1wga @KelemenCari  She also intimidated the first witness asking her maiden name.

1334329089008668673 2020-12-03 10:50:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  President Trump needs to sign an emergency executive order restricting or closing down Twitter.
1334303596293234688 2020-12-03 09:09:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork @RudyGiuliani Legislator Matt Hall  "i hope you can be respectful to the representatives answering the questions here today"   The representatives are the ones who are not respectful.   What a joke.
1334300285670342658 2020-12-03 08:55:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork @RudyGiuliani Isn't it illegal for this 1 Legislator to be making a scene and intimidating witnesses asking their maiden name?
1334269500892479490 2020-12-03 06:53:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please retweet the full speech of President Trump today.  It is being censored everywhere.   We need to get this out.  https://t.co/ww2DHSE7AQ

1334266825568206849 2020-12-03 06:42:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tdmanwight @stillgray It's a shame we don't have a US Attorney General to go after these criminals perpetuating this fraud.
1334266245747625985 2020-12-03 06:40:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SJPFISH We don't have a US Attorney General.  He is more concerned about his career with Joe Biden than doing his current job.
1334261007980511233 2020-12-03 06:19:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> Will Attorney General Bill Barr do what's best for this country and gracefully resign so we can actually have an AG who prosecutes crimes and does not allow the Deep state to alter his decisions?
1334259745507606528 2020-12-03 06:14:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kaiaka @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump for 3 years he made the mistake of keeping Jeff Sessions and now he is making excuses for the Current corrupt AG.  So sad.
1334258906231578625 2020-12-03 06:11:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump We need an Attorney General right now.    Your current AG is more concerned about his Career with Joe Biden and the Deep State.   Hire a new AG.  What do you have to lose?
1334258233477742592 2020-12-03 06:08:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RonnyJacksonTX @realDonaldTrump We need a new Attorney General immediately!

Later they find out their vote never got counted after pushing the green button.  35 affidavits.

1333356867930603520 2020-11-30 18:27:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> Everyone needs to listen to this interview with General McInerney.  "someone had a printing press" regarding over 1000,0000 counterfeit ballots, duplicate ballots dumped after they stopped counting in six states.   https://t.co/aj6m9VOMlQ

1333180732437499905 2020-11-30 06:47:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL @catturd2 Probably working with the FBI and DOJ on their Coup to turn American into a communist country.   Generals can't speak out?   The silence is deafening.

1333175915308748800 2020-11-30 06:28:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec  When does the US Military live up to their oath and defend the United States Constitution?   Do they just sit around and allow it to be destroyed by communist Judges and politicians?   Nobody in the Military says a word?
1333175372360257536 2020-11-30 06:25:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Barnes_Law @JackPosobiec Because the signatures are printed on counterfeit ballots and the circles are field in by a printer.  If you audit the ballots you'd find no stop duplicate signatures.   This election process is a complete FRAUD
1333171800419647489 2020-11-30 06:11:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> FBI is a useless organization.  Why did the FBI allow foreign machines and software to be brought into our country?  They knew about these machines and they did nothing.
1333170957372985344 2020-11-30 06:08:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> It is data dump FRAUD.   Anyone with just 4th grade math skills knows this is mathematically impossible.
1333166713626451970 2020-11-30 05:51:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto I hope there are cameras on at all times keeping an eye on these cheaters in Georgia facility buildings where the machines are.  Who's keeping an eye on the ballots?  These Cheaters will not stop covering up their crimes.

1332989698243870720 2020-11-29 18:08:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BrandonStraka We need to demand paper ballots only.  Walk in only.   Must show ID.   It's that simple.   Democrats don't want this because they want to cheat.

1332981479429705728 2020-11-29 17:35:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JohnMStubbins @truckerbooman Yep, China makes all kinds of gadgets and sells them to the USA.  So Printing a million counterfeit ballots would be super easy for China or for any wealthy liberal to print in their own home.   Just an expensive printing machine, lots of ink and paper.  George Soros has the $$$

1332978819980947456 2020-11-29 17:24:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Another sighting....  Anyone else seeing these drones? Is Gavin Newsom doing this??
1332978211374780417 2020-11-29 17:22:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @liquidlaugh We need to find out what that secret is because he has betrayed this country and he is betraying the Constitution.

1332976312256925697 2020-11-29 17:14:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Cernovich It is clearly obvious that Justice Roberts was compromised and blackmailed to vote with the Liberals.  Can someone please investigate as to what he did so that at the very least we can impeach him or ask him to resign.
1332973857909604352 2020-11-29 17:05:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SebGorka Why is he "Chief" Justice Roberts?  He needs to be demoted.   He's also been compromised or blackmailed.  He claimed he was conservative so he lied to the Republican Senate to get confirmed.  He should be impeached.
1332924043306045441 2020-11-29 13:47:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealMattCouch Every CEO of Dominion voting machines needs to be arrested immediately.

1332922067256102914 2020-11-29 13:39:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump You are 100% correct.
1332921378505330694 2020-11-29 13:36:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump These Democrat Governors implementing curfews, closing business/churches are COMMUNISTS, Marxist. No different than Stalin. Democrats are already taking lives of babies in the womb all the way to birth and supporting infanticide.  If there was no 2nd amendment they would abort us
1332920518287060993 2020-11-29 13:33:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Apathy got us here!
1332919484969979904 2020-11-29 13:29:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Our Founding Fathers knew about Tyrant people like Cuomo and Gavin Newsom, Biden and they understood because they themselves escaped Tyranny and had to fight for their freedoms, religious freedom and they fought for our freedom.  We cannot let them take it away.
1332918755421110272 2020-11-29 13:26:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Soon these social media sites we won't have access to.  I believe that's how badly they want to separate us.  Are we being proactive? Do we have other places to meet to stay in touch and to coordinate
1332918338683473921 2020-11-29 13:24:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @Matthew_4_Trump American Patriots against Communist Democrats who hate America.
1332918051050643459 2020-11-29 13:23:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They don't want us to congregate. They are using this Virus as an excuse to separate us and bring Tyranny and Socialism upon us.   We need to find other ways to congregate other than Social media.  Social media sites are working with Communist China and the Commie Democrats.

1332917209430016001 2020-11-29 13:20:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We are living in Tyranny now.  Unbelievable to see our Local and Federal Government destroying business, attacking Jewish and Christian Americans for practicing their faith.   Our Government is trampling the Constitution and the American people can't let this continue.
1332916585007259649 2020-11-29 13:17:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I hope and pray our Military does the right thing and stays on the side of the United States Constitution they took an oath to defend.

1332881580742742016 2020-11-29 10:58:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump That's what happens in Socialist, communist countries.  Did the people of New Mexico vote for the Communist Democrats?  Are they enjoying the lines?
1332861941618937856 2020-11-29 09:40:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 Yes they did.
1332860473272791040 2020-11-29 09:34:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 Which is why it is impossible for President Trump to be ahead in Michigan by 300,000 votes at 2 AM election morning and then to see at 4 AM all 300,000 of his votes vanished.
1332859239207845889 2020-11-29 09:29:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @karenwatson53 Because they lied months ago the last time they testified under oath and they got away with it.  The congressional hearings are just clown shows.   Department of Justice lets them lie under oath and get away with it and they know it so they keep lying.
1332858850207174656 2020-11-29 09:28:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JudgeJeanine @cyndeeEC Huh?  So now they are censoring our text messages?  OH No they don't!   Where are the attorneys out there.  Sign me up for a class action lawsuit.  Make them pay us $$$   They can't censor our texts.  BS!
1332857144895447040 2020-11-29 09:21:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Is this what they want?  Military silent and allow a communist coup to FRAUDULENTLY elect communist government dictators?  Shameful!  Are the Generals ordering their privates to shut up and not say a word as our Countries Constitution is being destroyed in front of their eyes?
1332856125515988992 2020-11-29 09:17:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @obinagaoda All Generals and ex Generals should come out and defend our country and stop this fraud election.
1332854530564788226 2020-11-29 09:10:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @obinagaoda I'm really suspicious and starting to believe many of them are in on this coup!  Sorry I feel that way but I have to be honest with how I feel.   You are right! They are too silent.  Don't they care about our country?  Other than ordering their men below them?
1332853195861684224 2020-11-29 09:05:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @obinagaoda Their silence is deafening.
1332851802576830464 2020-11-29 09:00:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @obinagaoda I feel like in my bio I should change "support our military" to " I want to support our military"
1332851132226363392 2020-11-29 08:57:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @obinagaoda It's sad.  Once in a while you hear a general saying they defend the constitution but just words and rarely heard.   Yes, President is commander in chief but the military Generals and above can speak.  I feel the Military has abandoned the American people.  Working for Deep State
1332850192735821827 2020-11-29 08:53:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @G_TheOriginal @klyn625 Now it is extremely clear whey Democrat communist party does not want voter ID.   They cheat
1332849745249718272 2020-11-29 08:51:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Our Military needs to decide which branches are going to defend our Constitution.  They took an oath to defend it.   Sadly, I am starting to lose confidence in our Military.  Someone should be speaking out besides just our President.

1332844275227246592 2020-11-29 08:30:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @julieagannon @SidneyPowell1 Twitter is censoring the links to Sidney Powells court complaints.  I clicked on the link friday and it worked.  Clicked on the link Saturday and it went to a twitter site saying the link was unsafe.
1332842091525722112 2020-11-29 08:21:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WINDOCTORRX @murphysdad4 They want Americans to wear masks in order to weaken their immune systems thus have total control over the people.   Democrats are Communists.
1332841737094512640 2020-11-29 08:20:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @domedog311 He should fire FBI Director Chris Wray.  Our tax dollars wasted.

1332839862609670145 2020-11-29 08:12:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Twitter is censoring people from speaking in communist countries and now doing the same in America.  When will Twitter be  held accountable?  Why was Big Tech allowed to lie under oath?

What a bunch of Liars they all are.   That's why we listen to the President and the White House.  Not the Democrat Media.
1332817048729133056 2020-11-29 06:42:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Main stream Media is LYING to you!   Don't listen to them.    Listen the the President and the White House.  President Donald J. Trump won this election.

1332799256793497600 2020-11-29 05:31:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Herhealthynews @Matthew_4_Trump yeah, especially on the rare occasion I have worn one and I coughed all day after wearing it because of the fibers you are breathing mixed in with Carbon Dioxide.   Doctors should be sued for suggesting we wear these things.
1332798784707862529 2020-11-29 05:29:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please terminate section 230 with an emergency executive order.  Big Tech is a threat to our National Security on a daily basis.
1332797427577806848 2020-11-29 05:24:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Which proves what real Doctors are saying.  Masks will not prevent a virus.
1332670507636850690 2020-11-28 20:59:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Pontifex But you support Politicians who legalize killing unborn children in the womb.  Catholic Democrat Politicians in the United States are supporting, legalizing laws to abort children in the womb and infanticide and you smile at them and say nothing.  You allow them communion.
1332669175278432256 2020-11-28 20:54:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> Repeal Section 230.  Sign an emergency executive order.   Protect our National Security.  @realDonaldTrump
1332668283913261056 2020-11-28 20:50:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @elagrew @reaITrumpForce True!   following back is the considerate thing to do.

1332666284459261953 2020-11-28 20:42:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Pontifex Then why do you allow Catholic Democrat Politicians who legalize and promote Killing babies in the womb and infanticide to receive Holy Communion?  Why do you support and encourage them?  You do nothing.

1332267397194006528 2020-11-27 18:17:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GermanNerd1990 @realDonaldTrump Why do you liberals call truth conspiracy theories?   It's not a theory it's a fact.   You are lying.   Why do you lie?   Conservatives, Christians are the only group censored and you know it.  STOP
1332267020155383808 2020-11-27 18:16:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GermanNerd1990 @realDonaldTrump Nope.  I've read it and I know lawyers who wrote it.  You're mixing apples with oranges.  You cannot discriminate against one group either...    They are publishers and they will lose their 230 protection.  Nice try though.
1332266377894248454 2020-11-27 18:13:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 Best thing to do to get rid of that hangover is first thing in the Morning eat Turkey.

1332265381499604993 2020-11-27 18:09:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GermanNerd1990 @realDonaldTrump You don't know what you're talking about.  Read the law on Section 230.   The facts are they are acting as publishers and have a special immunity and they are Censoring, editing one group of people.   No use arguing with you if you can't be honest.   stop wasting my time
1332264541942530048 2020-11-27 18:06:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GermanNerd1990 @realDonaldTrump 230 was granted in late 90s to at that time AOL and other chat rooms etc, (platforms) so that people could SPEAK FREELY.  It was created so there could be FREEDOM OF SPEECH on the internet.  For speech platforms.   Twitter, facebook are censoring ,EDITING our speech as publisher
1332263091166343168 2020-11-27 18:00:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah I just dress sloppy when I'm staying home.  Even when I go to the store I don't dress up.  Why bother?
1332262820881211393 2020-11-27 17:59:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TrumperWavin That's because Twitter is worldwide and they are now a threat to our National Security.  Section 230 gives them immunity from lawsuits and this is dangerous because they are acting as a publisher.
1332261989918277636 2020-11-27 17:56:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump He said "immediately"   We don't need the Senate.  We need our President to sign an EO.  President can act when there is a threat to our National Security.
1332261594823237632 2020-11-27 17:54:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RyanAFournier President Trump said "immediately" that means he needs to sign an executive order.  For security of our country he can do this because Twitter is a threat to our security.
1332260601922351104 2020-11-27 17:50:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GermanNerd1990 @realDonaldTrump It cannot be both a publisher and a platform.   You are promoting MISINFORMATION

Anything that threatens the physical well-being of the population or jeopardizes the stability of a nation's economy or institutions is considered a national security threat. Twitter is a threat

What Twitter is doing is totally illegal.  President is right.  Twitter is a National Security threat and he should sign an Executive order YESTERDAY and end section 230 or just shut twitter down.
1332254821328424962 2020-11-27 17:27:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Write and SIGN an EXECUTIVE ORDER immediately and terminate Section 230.  If Big Tech does not like your Executive order let them take it to the Supreme Court.  Please just do it Mr. President.  Sign an Executive Order.

They can exist, they just can't discriminate  and claim they are a free speech platform.   They are either a Publisher or a Platform.  Can't be both.   People should be allowed to sue Twitter.   No more immunity.
1332251823567093761 2020-11-27 17:16:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump Twitter must be shut down immediately.  Meaning now.  Executive Order.   To heck with Senate.
1332251516548255744 2020-11-27 17:14:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump The Federal Government should shut down Twitter immediately.

1331810240916901888 2020-11-26 12:01:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile As many times as I get headaches and fatigue does that mean I've had Covid more than once?

1331805002344534017 2020-11-26 11:40:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @willchamberlain Did the Biden Bullies scare you?  Were you compromised and too scared to fight?   Pathetic
1331803984001069062 2020-11-26 11:36:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @willchamberlain You're a terrible Lawyer.
1331802469433708545 2020-11-26 11:30:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> They are working on cancelling birthday Party's inside your home and blowing out candles on the birthday cake will be illegal due to the Covid.
1331791625706606592 2020-11-26 10:47:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lvgirl2617 It doesn't.  That's proof they cheated.

1331790291062276096 2020-11-26 10:42:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AOC Nancy Pelosi wants children to go hungry.  President Trump offered a Stand Alone Bill for a $1200.00 stimulus check that would have gone out in 24 hours and Nancy Pelosi REFUSED. So enough of your lies AOC!  Blame your leader Nancy!  It was her call.
1331789877642313729 2020-11-26 10:40:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> I fear for our Country.  Our constitutional rights to vote have been stolen. They are trying to cancel our votes.  If the courts play dirty and do not stop this blatant Fraud, our country will go into a Civil War.  Is that what they really want?  They must bring honesty back.
1331787620716662785 2020-11-26 10:31:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stuff_charlie Then there will be Civil War.  Americans cannot be forced into a Banana Republic stolen election so if the courts are that corrupt and stupid then they will open up a Pandora's box.

1331786039967371265 2020-11-26 10:25:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Real wealthy Conservative Americans think it won't affect them because they are millionaires, billionaires but they will be surprised when communism takes over first people they come after are the ones in parties who were powerful, wealthy and conservative.
1331785608948170753 2020-11-26 10:23:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sianetta @diana_west_ @BreitbartNews It depends who's working there and now running the organization.  If they are weak and cowardly they could go that route.  I'm noticing too many conservatives letting left compromise them. If it were me I'd say bring it on and Id still fight.
1331785312809304069 2020-11-26 10:22:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL @sbkfig I just think it's weird that its being filed so late at night and if it is we probably won't even hear about it or what it says.
1331784427110756352 2020-11-26 10:18:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sianetta @diana_west_ @BreitbartNews If true and it was hacked then why doesn't breitbart say so?
1331783990664073216 2020-11-26 10:17:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NettieMarieJ I've been noticing Breitbart has been real weak within the last couple months every since they were banned from google search engine.   @BreitbartNews use to be such an honest, conservative network and they are leaning left.  So sad.

1331747838255009792 2020-11-26 07:53:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @momfelix58 @ACTBrigitte Newsmax has more commercials than news. @ChrisRuddyNMX
1331744671953895424 2020-11-26 07:40:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL You too!  Happy Thanksgiving.   Yes, I just listen to the President and the White House now.   Hard to know who to trust any more.
1331743618860679169 2020-11-26 07:36:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL She sent out another retweet of something else but still nothing about if she filed or how that went.   I guess we don't deserve an answer?
1331742727696912384 2020-11-26 07:33:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SidneyPowell1  Did you file today?
1331739607029858306 2020-11-26 07:20:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL @NickAdamsinUSA Something is off!
1331738516489867265 2020-11-26 07:16:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL @NickAdamsinUSA Really odd.  You would think we would have heard something.
1331737584058318849 2020-11-26 07:12:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL @NickAdamsinUSA She just sent out a tweet on Flynn but nothing on the filing.  Kind of odd.  You would think she would make a comment?
1331737397344706560 2020-11-26 07:11:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BarbaraRedgate @SidneyPowell1 Will you be commenting on the filing today?  Did you file??
1331736182309285889 2020-11-26 07:07:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MFDinFL @NickAdamsinUSA I heard she filed today so maybe its taking her some time to make a statement.

1331734477018578953 2020-11-26 07:00:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NickAdamsinUSA Was Sidney Powell not able to file today?  It is 6:00 PM in Georgia and courts are closed.  What happened?  Anyone know what's going on?
1331733646961565699 2020-11-26 06:56:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KaitMarieox Yes, In the United States of America elections are not won by blatant Fraud.  Joe Biden Lost.

Counterfeit ballot dumps, software that erases votes, Secret counting, kicking observers out of rooms.  Cheating is not the will of the American people.
1331719414811541505 2020-11-26 06:00:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Wing3Bob @TheDemocrats @JoeBiden Yes, the Democrats cheated.  They do this every two years in California and they thought they would take the Cheat process Nationwide but TOO MANY EYES WATCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS so they got CAUGHT!

1331714943494746112 2020-11-26 05:42:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Fraudulent Democrats tried to unseat our President in 2016 and they tried again with Election Fraud.     Biden LOST

1331547394018746368 2020-11-25 18:36:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Donald. J. Trump won the election on 11/3/2020  He will be our President until 2024

1331471091378704384 2020-11-25 13:33:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @danielledsouzag @SidneyPowell1 They have been cheating in California for several years.  In 2018 candidates (incumbents) in Republican stronghold districts won on election night then days later huge leads gone via mail in ballots. Counted by same software?   They took the cheat Nationwide, now all eyes see it.
1331467908145299461 2020-11-25 13:21:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gatewaypundit @SidneyPowell1 If there are 6000 false Biden votes there are more.

1331422228072652800 2020-11-25 10:19:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> Don't confuse anger for hate.   It's OK to despise evil.   It is called righteous anger.

1331418077884366850 2020-11-25 10:03:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bjyphillips @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Fox News told their staff not to like or retweet Trump supporters.  Hannity use to retweet and like tweets and he stopped and he then unfollowed thousands of us.    It's not just that they are snobs it's also because they are micro managed by Fox News Liberal Producer hacks!
1331416802576850945 2020-11-25 09:57:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @allenbarr1 @JoeBiden I will NEVER unite with a Party that Kills babies in the womb all the way to birth and even after they are born.  I will NEVER unite with a Party that embraces communism and wants to take away my Constitution.  They can go to the Devil.
1331413712792502272 2020-11-25 09:45:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KernsNini Yes, that's all they care about.   What good will their money be when we get taken over by Communism?
1331413315566792704 2020-11-25 09:44:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle Do you think Chris Wallace did a good job moderating when he basically debated the president and disrespected our President during the moderation and afterwards every hour on Fox news??
1331413094812196866 2020-11-25 09:43:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle Are any of your tweets original or is everything you tweet the same scripted material from your liberal producers who tell you what and what you cannot say on your show?
1331410958313426946 2020-11-25 09:34:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bjyphillips @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Fox News committed election Fraud as far as I'm concerned.  They helped those states and they knew why the counting stopped.
1331410628808900609 2020-11-25 09:33:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> Fox News is so deceptive.  Notice how they are using Tucker and Laura to try and get viewers back today?    It's hysterical.   Both Tucker and Laura do not have free speech at Fox News.  They do as they are told by their producers.  Don't fall for it.
1331409322950025216 2020-11-25 09:28:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle And almost all Trump voters stopped watching Fox News, @foxnews including your show.
1331408896460615680 2020-11-25 09:26:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @toddstarnes I say Joe Biden has a Patriotic responsibility to turn himself in for election Fraud.  He mistakenly admitted on live TV that he and his party committed fraud.    Its on video.  his dementia caused him to confess it.
1331407930634113026 2020-11-25 09:22:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @justonepatriot @allenbarr1 @TuckerCarlson @JoeBiden Sorry but we don't watch Fox News any more.  It's gone from our TV
1331407689767821314 2020-11-25 09:21:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile The sad problem is we can't even trust the FBI
1331407321654730756 2020-11-25 09:20:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile I wonder how many other Shredding companies destroyed ballots that we don't know about.  How many got away?
1331406081969426432 2020-11-25 09:15:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> Do Democrats even change their underwear?    They don't change their masks.
1331405098887483392 2020-11-25 09:11:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @GaSecofState Seeing so many of these Democrats responding on here saying "the envelops were discarded" in hopes that the fraud is successful is disgusting.  Democrats are disgusting people.

1331397985435930624 2020-11-25 08:43:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @GaSecofState I believe Sidney Powell.  Brad Raffensperger and Governor Kemp are corrupt and it will all be exposed when she files.

1331364591801040897 2020-11-25 06:30:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Magirly9 Especially when there are more votes than registered voters.
1331364232269422592 2020-11-25 06:29:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump I am concerned about What kind of Generals we have in our Military.  It is scary to hear a General say he wants to get rid of "America First" .
1331362040170987520 2020-11-25 06:20:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> If the courts play into this outright Fraudulent election and do not stop this fraud there will no longer be a Republican Party  @GOPChairwoman @GOPSenate @GOPLeader @GOPChairwoman  @realDonaldTrump

1331188155198803968 2020-11-24 18:49:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 I watched too.  I saw Trump leading by 300,000 votes at 2 AM and checked at 4 AM and that 300,000 lead vanished.  And remember they "stopped counting"...   Think about that. US Supreme Court better not be dirty.  They better fix this because we will NEVER accept this crap.

All his ideas are from CNN Fake news.  He just reads their articles and regurgitates their crap slightly disguising it.

Dominion machines switched votes!    Dominion machines deleting votes.    Poll watchers kicked out of rooms.  Employees covering windows with paper.  Secret counting.

1330815485101838338 2020-11-23 18:08:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GovLarryHogan Biden is the only one who will be conceding.  You miserable, corrupt Governor!    President Trump won!!    You need to resign from your Governor position because you are Corrupt to the core.
1330814319622144003 2020-11-23 18:03:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GovLarryHogan President Trump won the election by over 10 Million votes.  Governor Larry Hogan is a corrupt Governor.

1330812196796829696 2020-11-23 17:55:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GovLarryHogan  I am embarrassed that their are "republican" Governors like Larry Hogan making ignorant statements to the media.  Banana Republic you say?   Fraudulent elections with machines switching votes, counterfeit ballot dumps early AM is the banana republic.

1330805552977383424 2020-11-23 17:29:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @amazon I definitely don't trust them after this and it was sneaky the way they issued me a credit without telling me why.
1330803343023738886 2020-11-23 17:20:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @amazon Lesson learned.... When you buy a product on amazon call the manufacturer to make sure its not counterfeit.  Actually Amazon should know if a seller is authorized to sell particular product especially medicine.
1330802430800379905 2020-11-23 17:16:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @amazon @LaCatholicState @Boehringer There was no "we will find out and get back to you".  You would think they would investigate or at least tell you they will find out.  I was informed after already using the product.  id like to know what was in it.
1330801848601640960 2020-11-23 17:14:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @amazon Other than issuing me a refund I had no idea I was getting or why, Amazon also did not seem to be concerned when I asked what was in the product if it was counterfeit.  Amazon told me they don't know.  Do they care?  Does anyone care?
1330801415367712770 2020-11-23 17:12:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @amazon @LaCatholicState @Boehringer  I also called Frontline and they told me that they are aware of the counterfeit but they do not know what was in the product.  They did not seem concerned either.  Please correct me if I'm wrong but I was told Boehringer owns frontline. Hard to find.
1330794748378955776 2020-11-23 16:46:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> Do not buy pet products from @amazon    I purchased Frontline on Amazon and it was counterfeit. Amazon is suppose to make sure sellers are authorized. They did not tell me it was counterfeit until 10 weeks later I noticed an unauthorized credit to my card and had to call and ask.

1330653202904018945 2020-11-23 07:23:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RepLizCheney Liz Cheney, you also cannot credibly distance yourself from Socialism because you are trying to cancel my vote.  You pretend you are against socialism and you criticize Democrats while at the same time you are working for them.   You disenfranchise over 73 million American voters
1330652003664416768 2020-11-23 07:18:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MountainMama215 Yes,  lets make this a MAGA Christmas.

We have evidence across the country of election fraud on video!! They keep saying there is no evidence.  Just covering up windows with cardboard, kicking out observers is enough evidence alone but there is much more!
1330646660712603650 2020-11-23 06:57:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> Liz Cheney and Chris Christie want ILLEGAL votes to be counted.  They want your votes to be cancelled.    These two are not Republicans.

1330637027411329025 2020-11-23 06:19:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RepLizCheney   Stop calling yourself a Conservative.

1330449295636647936 2020-11-22 17:53:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump is our President and will be our President until 2024.    If the courts are also dirty, corrupt and allow Democrats and communist China to get away with this election fraud we will never accept Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.    There will be no transition to fraud

Military will need to make a decision on which branches will go with the Constitution they took an oath to protect.
1330372024880025601 2020-11-22 12:46:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GeoffRBennett This fraud is going all the way to the United States Supreme Court.  President Trump won with 83 Million votes.

1330004484596977665 2020-11-21 12:25:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jerobyn10 @GKeile Nope,  i was a fan of hers too but she's turned to the left big time.
1330004099513733122 2020-11-21 12:24:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile @nikkinbc I unfollowed her and Tucker yesterday.
1330002017486442503 2020-11-21 12:16:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice Us little social media conservatives have also been ringing the bell for years before "social media personalities" were a thing on twitter and nobody believed us.
1330000554995503104 2020-11-21 12:10:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> Now we know why President Trump said more than once that he won big.    This fraud was massive and it will be exposed soon
1330000017872936961 2020-11-21 12:08:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @__Robyn_ @John_F_Kennnedy @TuckerCarlson @newsmax FBI and DOJ should be investigating and indicting on this fraud.   They are not lifting a finger to assist.  Nothing.
1329999784187314178 2020-11-21 12:07:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @__Robyn_ @John_F_Kennnedy @TuckerCarlson @newsmax Attorney Sydney Powell said her small team of lawyers are working as hard and fast as they can when this goes to court it will make FBI, DOJ look really bad and expose them too.  Right now DOJ or FBI are not doing anything nor did they try to prevent this.  THEY KNEW!!!
1329998498368876544 2020-11-21 12:02:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> The evidence on election fraud is overwhelming!
1329998369331134465 2020-11-21 12:01:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @__Robyn_ @John_F_Kennnedy @TuckerCarlson @newsmax Evidence pouring in daily.  The lawyers are overwhelmed with evidence.  Foreign countries, Iran and China helped with this Fraud.
1329997814760235008 2020-11-21 11:59:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Fire Chris Wray
1329983502897401856 2020-11-21 11:02:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson  Is it true you're a registered Democrat?
1329978516360687616 2020-11-21 10:42:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @directorblue @TuckerCarlson Instead of inviting people to his show why doesn't he do some investigative reporting and stop taking it out on Sydney Powell.
1329976542429024262 2020-11-21 10:34:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @brian_tiernan Exactly.  Every time you turn Fox News on you are supporting corruption and Communism.
1329975046324948993 2020-11-21 10:28:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @vinnyanm1 @SidneyPowell1 @GOPChairwoman @JennaEllisEsq @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump They know about it.
1329972483601039360 2020-11-21 10:18:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> Today will be 17 days I have not turned on Fox News and I won't turn it on again.
1329972165651755008 2020-11-21 10:17:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LindemannPamela @chuckwoolery Lord please help President Donald J. Trump and expose this evil fraud perpetuated by the corrupt left wing socialist Democrats and their corrupt Media.   Amen.
1329971543644856320 2020-11-21 10:15:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi President Trump 2020-2024  Joe is not our President.
1329971106262839298 2020-11-21 10:13:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angela47995865 Biden should concede immediately and stop putting our country through this Fraud.
1329970748480397312 2020-11-21 10:11:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @chuckwoolery @MRMitchnet DOJ and the FBI are worthless and a waste of taxpayers money.
1329970337652457473 2020-11-21 10:10:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angela47995865 It was a huge Landslide!  They had an "insurance policy"  Stopped counting and brought in the counterfeit votes
1329969813356044290 2020-11-21 10:08:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> RESIST
1329969761334169600 2020-11-21 10:07:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump was elected President of the United States on 11/3/2020 and no matter what anyone says even the courts, he will be our president until 2024.  We know what is happening now is outright Fraud!
1329969006548193282 2020-11-21 10:04:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Edward22J @steph2monaco @TuckerCarlson Especially to Tucker.
1329968712930062337 2020-11-21 10:03:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Melissawins1 This time around we will see indictments.
1329968257248346114 2020-11-21 10:01:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Donald J. Trump was elected by the American people on 11/3/2020
1329967346832666625 2020-11-21 09:58:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump is right again as usual. When he says "I won by a lot!"   He has all the info.  Media will again eat crow.
1329966181642485760 2020-11-21 09:53:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> I'm so glad today everyone has cell phones with video cameras.  So much proof showing PA covering their windows with cardboard and paper to stop observers from watching them count the votes.  Making observers stand 30 feet away and giving them binoculars.  So much Fraud!
1329964018258231296 2020-11-21 09:45:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @christy_bishop President Trump won 400 electoral votes.   They could not handle it.  They had "insurance" and stopped counting the votes in order to give them time to do their dirty deed.
1329962925973405697 2020-11-21 09:40:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cochran_bob Recall and do the election over without dominion software or mail in voting.  Show id to prove who you are.
1329962345028751360 2020-11-21 09:38:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> Georgia Governor Kemp refuses to audit counterfeit ballots.  He is complicit in election fraud and the DOJ must investigate this man.
1329961903938965506 2020-11-21 09:36:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> Dominion software Laptop and Key stolen from storage before elections in PA.  Key gives access to manipulate vote tabulation on hundreds of thousands of votes.
1329960540328783874 2020-11-21 09:31:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Donald J. Trump won his reelection on 11/3/2020 by a Landslide.
1329959635491586049 2020-11-21 09:27:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Media said counting was to stop on election night yet they sure counted those hundreds of thousands of ballots shoved through the back door.  All for Biden!  They think Americans are stupid.
1329959184847097858 2020-11-21 09:25:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Hundreds thousands of Ballots Dumped in early hours of the morning after election night when they "stopped counting"  and 96% for Joe Biden proves complete Fraud.
1329941540253306880 2020-11-21 08:15:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump @GovKemp Governor Kemp is a criminal and he is complicit in election fraud.   A new election will need to be held in Georgia and Governor Kemp needs to immediately resign from office.
1329940897904041985 2020-11-21 08:13:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork @realMikeLindell Please bring in security forces to protect American citizens from violent Democrat Antifa terrorists.
1329911686711578624 2020-11-21 06:17:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax Don't be like Hannity and interrupt.   Please let your guest finish their sentence.
1329892911098470402 2020-11-21 05:02:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thedailybeast Why aren't the Navy Seals dragging Obama to Prison for Treason against this Country and spying on a United States President?
1329737496280715266 2020-11-20 18:44:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @meinter01 @BoSnerdley They are fake.
1329729042619121664 2020-11-20 18:11:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> What is being done about this?  @realDonaldTrump  Where is Bill Barr??
1329728737282166787 2020-11-20 18:10:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realMikeLindell  Please stop sponsoring Fox News.
1329723240688697350 2020-11-20 17:48:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dbongino @zeebusie President Trump should fire Durham.  Durham is worthless.  This should have been done months ago and he was too cowardly and waited until after the election.  I don't even want to hear Durhams name any more.
1329719373276307460 2020-11-20 17:32:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> I trust them too but I don't trust Tucker Carlson @TuckerCarlson
1329718985273688065 2020-11-20 17:31:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LuckyWTheStr8Rt @FoxNews @SidneyPowell1 @TuckerCarlson @comcastcares Funny because I'm also thinking of getting rid of my provider.  I only kept it all these years (15) because of Fox News.
1329718653583978496 2020-11-20 17:30:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LuckyWTheStr8Rt @FoxNews @SidneyPowell1 @TuckerCarlson I'm curious to know how that works.  Do advertisers pay them less money?  Do advertisers leave them?   I will enjoy watching them shrivel up fade away. This will be fun. 🍿  🤣
1329717076471136263 2020-11-20 17:23:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah Fox News people will be looking for new jobs no matter what happens.  Nobody is watching them now and especially after Tucker and Laura turned a hard left the last few days.
1329716115094704130 2020-11-20 17:20:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LuckyWTheStr8Rt @FoxNews @SidneyPowell1 @TuckerCarlson I wonder how much money Fox news has lost within the last two weeks of nobody watching?
1329715108243591168 2020-11-20 17:16:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LuckyWTheStr8Rt @FoxNews @SidneyPowell1 @TuckerCarlson a few days ago on his show he said his show is not going anywhere and that it's actually expanding and that the producers want it to expand.   Expand into what?  After today he's lost more viewers.  They are a clown show now.
1329714313616003072 2020-11-20 17:12:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @LuckyWTheStr8Rt @FoxNews @SidneyPowell1 Fox news is history.  Spent many years supporting them.  I use to have the TV on weekends on all day.  Would come home from work for years and just turn Fox news on.  After 16 days not watching that channel its actually a breath of fresh air.
1329709840457863168 2020-11-20 16:55:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @flasher_mig @IngrahamAngle @JennaEllisEsq @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 @FoxNews I have been trying to convince a few friends, family who still watch Fox news in the evenings and they wouldn't because they liked Tucker and Laura.  Now they stopped completely.  Those two shows were the last hope for Fox and that's gone.
1329709405193920514 2020-11-20 16:53:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yesnicksearcy @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 Because Tucker Carlson gets paid big bonuses to do and say what his Communist Producers at Fox News want him to say and do.  Tucker is a greedy Millionaire Puppet.
1329705761002250245 2020-11-20 16:38:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @atensnut So Fox News probably gave Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham a big bonus to turn on Trump and they accepted.   So sickening to see people slither and crawl for money.
1329705228606738437 2020-11-20 16:36:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Yep, I unfollowed Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham today.   These people along with most on Foxnews @foxnews should retire.  Their careers are done.
1329704711239258113 2020-11-20 16:34:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CubHayden @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle Everyone will be able to read the information when the law suit is filed and the evidence is submitted in court during the hearings.   TV show hosts are not judges.   Tucker Carlson is a clown.
1329704021938950144 2020-11-20 16:31:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CoryBooker You don't care about love.  You support and legalize murdering preborn children in and out of the womb.  Abortion, infanticide.   You have no respect for life.
1329690187668996097 2020-11-20 15:36:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BeauMattLaFave @DiamondandSilk God Bless you!  Keep up the fight against evil.
1329689207317569536 2020-11-20 15:33:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @TuckerCarlson I really hope Fox news goes bankrupt and off the air.
1329688993953300480 2020-11-20 15:32:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @TuckerCarlson No, I did not know that but thank you for informing me.  It makes sense.  I'm sure Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham received a huge increase from their producers to continue to go after our President in their passive aggressive fashion. They do anything for Cash.  Pathetic.
1329687731643973632 2020-11-20 15:27:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle   I unfollowed Laura Ingraham
1329687493680144384 2020-11-20 15:26:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson I unfollowed you
1329687392735744002 2020-11-20 15:25:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bubblebathgirl Both Laura Ingraham and Tucker sold their soul to Fox News Communist Producers who pay them to say and do exactly what they are told.
1329687108181585922 2020-11-20 15:24:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Joy_Villa @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 A layer does not display evidence on a TV show before litigating in court.   Tucker is a fool.
1329682036290777089 2020-11-20 15:04:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LuckyWTheStr8Rt @FoxNews He's mad because she won't come on his show and helps his ratings.
1329681852789977088 2020-11-20 15:03:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JacquelineManos @newsmax @gregkellyusa Newsmax and One America News  Oann are good.
1329681638175895554 2020-11-20 15:03:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Whatisgoingon19 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle I think Tucker made himself look bad.  He is doing exactly what his producers are telling him to do and say.
1329681167272951809 2020-11-20 15:01:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @YMimmo @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle You know they don't have freedom of speech on their network @foxnews and the Producers tell them what and what they cannot say.   If they cared about their country they would leave and join Newmax or Oann.  Fox news pays them millions to do as they are told.  Pathetic
1329666318740586497 2020-11-20 14:02:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LuckyWTheStr8Rt You're right!  I'm sure Sidney Powell does not trust @foxnews Fox News and they are telling her to reveal her evidence on his TV show.  No lawyer would do that.  It is done in court.  Not on Tuckers failing TV show.
1329665908017545216 2020-11-20 14:00:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @100Trump45 @IngrahamAngle Laura Ingraham is just Jealous she could never make it as a lawyer and would never be part of President Trumps legal team.
1329665558414061568 2020-11-20 13:59:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @100Trump45 @IngrahamAngle Laura Ingraham sold her soul to Fox News Liberal communist TV Producers.  She must be getting a big increase for betraying us.
1329665273662631936 2020-11-20 13:57:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KayaJones Pray for our country and Pray for President Donald J. Trump Pray that God protects us and brings this country back to him.
1329664712590585863 2020-11-20 13:55:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CASuperrunner @MarshaBlackburn Not if we keep praying.   Massive Fraud on Data Dumps.  Huge evidence.  When lawsuit is filed we can read it.    Courts will be forced to overturn.
1329663794151231489 2020-11-20 13:52:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarshaBlackburn Like a snake it will try.  It will strike out at us but it will not win.
1329663660822724608 2020-11-20 13:51:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealMattCouch @nebing Karl Rove has always been a big and I mean BIG RINO.  Fox news is pathetic.  Even in the evening people are tuning out.
1329663187289980929 2020-11-20 13:49:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> I'm so happy I made the correct decision to completely stop watching @foxnews even at night.  Even the two shows I liked @TuckerCarlson and @IngrahamAngle, I had a gut feeling that these two people would betray us and I was right.  Have not watched Fox news for 16 days.  So happy
1329662395535347712 2020-11-20 13:46:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RL9631 @gailsline @MAGA2ARIGHTS @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 Sidney Powell does not trust Fox News @foxnews.   Why should she?  Besides, she has said enough and she's not going to go on his show to release evidence when that is to be released in trial not on a TV show.  Especially a fake network
1329657607691198464 2020-11-20 13:27:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ElijahSchaffer Evidence is provided in Court not on Tucker Carlson's TV show.  @TuckerCarlson

1329652105401966592 2020-11-20 13:05:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 @RL9631 @gailsline @MAGA2ARIGHTS @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 @FoxNews Wow!  Many conservatives still turning on Fox News in the evenings to hear Tucker and Laura and now Fox is losing more ratings from the left over evening viewers.
1329651579146813441 2020-11-20 13:03:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 @RL9631 @gailsline @MAGA2ARIGHTS @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 @FoxNews Sidney Powell CANNOT bring up all their evidence when it is going to court.  Any lawyer who would do that would be committing legal malpractice.
1329642183704469506 2020-11-20 12:26:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson  Tucker Carlson and @IngrahamAngle  Laura Ingraham both bought out by their Communist Fox news producers.   TURN OFF FOX NEWS.  Never turn it back on.
1329640847382519816 2020-11-20 12:20:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden You're a fraud!  You cheated big time and the truth is being exposed.
1329639154720784386 2020-11-20 12:14:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SherJustSaying Communist Media in America are the enemy of the American people.
1329623033980485632 2020-11-20 11:10:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They cheated.  96% of Biden Votes from 135,000 is mathematically impossible.  You won the state of Michigan.   The US Supreme court better do their job and stop this FRAUD
1329616459052453888 2020-11-20 10:44:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @VERBAL_CHANCLA Trump won the election.  All the rest is smoke and mirrors from the left.   Election fraud.
1329616068533309446 2020-11-20 10:42:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Moderates?  That's just another word for Cowardly.
1329615707135385600 2020-11-20 10:41:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JustCallMeTong Maybe God is about to do something.  He is patient and forgiving but he is Just.
1329614720723079168 2020-11-20 10:37:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto @JaxMobile Where is Bill Barr?  He needs to start indicting these poll worker employees in management.
1329614305495379968 2020-11-20 10:35:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JustCallMeTong hmmm,  what would cause that?
1329613705412108290 2020-11-20 10:33:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FrankD1992 Oh there will be a great separation alright because the Americans who still have spines won't accept a communist takeover of this country.  It's just a shame we have so many cowards today.
1329612305810694144 2020-11-20 10:27:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FrankD1992 Sadly it appears you are right.  I never thought Americans would be this cowardly.
1329611244328808450 2020-11-20 10:23:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @100Trump45 Yes, the Chinesecommunist Viris.   Well planned take over of the United States working with Democrats
1329602330803617794 2020-11-20 09:47:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte The producers are being stupid.
1329566253564923904 2020-11-20 07:24:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> We are now living in a new Communism.    Covid Communism  The Left and Cowardly right use a virus to take away your freedom and Americans rolled over and allowed this.   Tyrant Governors being allowed to act as dictators.  What happened to land of the free and home of the brave?
1329551639766650881 2020-11-20 06:26:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Whatever happened to civil disobedience?   Are Americans like marshmallows now?
1329547836820582400 2020-11-20 06:11:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @realDonaldTrump @justin_hart They (The communist Democrats) have been cheating like this in California for several years and they decided to take it Nationwide. Now everyone's eyes are on their Cheating where when it was just California they got away with it.  They won't get away with this one.
1329374825261907969 2020-11-19 18:43:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealMattCouch Who the hell is he?   Nobody is putting their poisonous vaccine in my body for a virus with a 99% survival rate.
1329373679457689600 2020-11-19 18:39:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SecPompeo @netanyahu @realDonaldTrump Netanyahu betrayed us and he betrayed President Trump.  I hope the people of Israel elect a new leader.
1329364294715097088 2020-11-19 18:02:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LamastusK @ACTBrigitte @FoxNews For a long time I only watched Tucker and Ingraham but now I won't watch any Fox News.  I just heard today that Laura Ingraham is veering left.
1329363787296559104 2020-11-19 17:59:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Whatisgoingon19 @ACTBrigitte @GretchenCarlson @FoxNews I think when many of these Fox News anchors interviewed for their jobs they pretended to be conservative and kept up the act for years.
1329363238035755009 2020-11-19 17:57:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte I haven't watched Fox news for 15 days and I won't turn it on again.

1329360235241193474 2020-11-19 17:45:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @CoriBush If they don't have the money and time they can go to a trade school.  It's their choice.  They can work and pay for their tuition which is what I did.  If they sign for a loan they agreed to pay it back.  Make them pay.
1329359806788866048 2020-11-19 17:44:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CubanAmerican72 @DavidJHarrisJr Make Wisconsin pay for it!  They don't demand anything.   I hope and Pray the US Supreme court DOES THE RIGHT THING and makes all these states pay for the Election Fraud they have perpetuated on America
1329358711567970304 2020-11-19 17:39:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @CoriBush Nobody has to go to college.  It's not a human right.  That's an absurd statement!

We will NEVER work with "progressives"   Major election fraud has taken place.  President Trump WON this election.  If US Supreme Court does not stop this Fraud there will be no peace in this country.
1329355240760504321 2020-11-19 17:26:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @harborgirl21 @SebGorka @VetApologist @IngrahamAngle @AOC @FoxNews I'm so glad I have resisted and stopped watching Fox News.  I liked Laura Ingraham and Tucker but will not turn on Fox news and give them ratings.  So sad to see Laura Ingraham fall in line with the libs.  Karl Rove is a clown.  Stopped listening to him years ago.
1329353948138926080 2020-11-19 17:20:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SebGorka @IngrahamAngle @AOC @FoxNews I'm really disappointed to hear Laura said this.    It makes me wonder if Fox News producers are putting pressure on them to spout this Far Left nonsense.  If so Laura should leave Fox news.
1329343890457968641 2020-11-19 16:40:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  These are Facts.  Hard evidence.  Facts!  yet Twitter interferes with our election and censors and ads tag lines stating this is disputed.   You can't dispute facts.  Repeal Section 230.
1329302196089806848 2020-11-19 13:55:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KatherineTrunk @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul @OANN They (Democrats) don't want honest voting system like that because they obviously want to cheat.

1329298430993203200 2020-11-19 13:40:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @justin_hart You won Wisconsin.  This fraud cannot stand!   Regardless of courts or judges this fraud will NEVER STAND.   President Trump won the election on 11/3/2020
1329297679004749828 2020-11-19 13:37:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq So they tried to change the rules during the election?   Is that even legal?

1329218015926239232 2020-11-19 08:20:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax Way too many commercials.

1329211107865620480 2020-11-19 07:53:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax Government needs to take their big nose out of our family gatherings.   We are sick and tired of hearing the same old Bull💩about Covid.  It has a 99% survival rate.  Why aren't you talking about that? What happened to the FLU?  Did it turn into Covid?
1329206126370455553 2020-11-19 07:33:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChrisRuddyNMX @realDonaldTrump @newsmax You are on a 90 day probation period.  We will watch but don't bend to the dishonest media.   We will not tolerate it.

1329202577804726272 2020-11-19 07:19:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CountessNorika @LLinWood @realDonaldTrump They are lazy and corrupt.  Sitting around raking in their government paycheck from our hard earned tax dollars, eating like Kings and doing nothing.   It's disgusting!
1329201629254455297 2020-11-19 07:15:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CountessNorika @LLinWood I think we need a new Attorney General.   Where is he? @realDonaldTrump
1329201311636619264 2020-11-19 07:14:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @davereaboi After Chris Wallace did a terrible job as a moderator where he debated our President and argued with him and defended Joe Biden, Fox News then shoved Chris Wallace in our faces every other hour on almost every program on Fox News.  Big mistake.   @foxnews
1329200673854918657 2020-11-19 07:11:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @iheartmindy @LLinWood When President Trump tweets more than once "I won the election", I have no doubt he knows something Big. Something that we don't know yet and it will come out hopefully soon...  @SidneyPowell1
1329198844244938754 2020-11-19 07:04:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> Georgia is so fortunate to have Kelly Loeffler fighting for them!  She is amazing!
1329196926453964800 2020-11-19 06:56:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> "Reverend" Warnock should be ashamed of himself.  We must support Kelly Loeffler.
1329196204614328322 2020-11-19 06:54:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump I wonder how many more boxes of ballots from Republican districts are being hidden in cupboard, cabinets, closets?  This Election is a fraud and an attack on our freedom  Audi every ballot.   Must have signatures.   Check for counterfeit Printed ballots with perfect bubbles.
1329191222515097600 2020-11-19 06:34:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Please tweet that to the President so he can see it.

1329186959751749634 2020-11-19 06:17:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @momfelix58 @FoxNews @ainsleyearhardt Because she's part of the dishonest media.  She only cares about selling her book.
1329185994902388736 2020-11-19 06:13:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> A ton of people stopped watching Fox and friends when @ainsleyearhardt  Ainsley Earhartd lectured Ted Cruz for criticizing Chris Wallace and she defended Chris Wallace in an attempt to shut down Ted Cruz.   @foxnews deserves to lose all their viewers.
1329182836541124608 2020-11-19 06:00:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GovMikeHuckabee These liberal Journalist try to act so "moral" yet they are frauds because they all support murdering babies in the womb and infanticide.  These people are immoral and they don't care about truth.
1329182429123284992 2020-11-19 05:59:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SnakePlisken10 SCOTUS should just toss out all the illegal votes.  That right there will end the fraud and President will be in White House 4 more years.
1329178101159346176 2020-11-19 05:42:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte I'd love to see Sidney Powell bring forth a class action law suit against CNN on behalf of the American people who have been lied to.
1329174494611603458 2020-11-19 05:27:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte We will never unify with violent Democrat Socialist and we will never accept a Fraudulent election if the courts do not stop it.  Courts must do what is right and stop the fraud.
1329173862236389376 2020-11-19 05:25:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Start checking cupboards and closets where they are hiding ballots!    check conference rooms under desks, behind fixtures.   They are hiding ballots.  When they realized they were being watched they could not destroy them so they hid them.    There are more.  You need to look
1329173301504032769 2020-11-19 05:23:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Must do audit and check for signatures.   Reports of thousands of ballots circled only for Biden and no other person on ballot.   Circles perfectly filled suggesting the ballots were printed with choices selected.  MUST AUDIT.
1329172725097660417 2020-11-19 05:20:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump A thorough audit needs to be done.  How many more Boxes of ballots for President Trump are hidden?  This is not accident it is outright Fraud! @realDonaldTrump
1329171958752165888 2020-11-19 05:17:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MajorPatriot Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham should leave Fox News and join Oann or Newsmax.   I liked them but can't turn them on because I won't give Fox News ratings.    Glad to see they are losing money.
1329170553664536576 2020-11-19 05:12:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PresElect_Ryder Democrats work for the Devil.
1329170394809470976 2020-11-19 05:11:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The CIA invented the word "conspiracy theorist" in order to silence people and label them in a negative way so that people would not listen to possible truth.
1329169111142727681 2020-11-19 05:06:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you allow The Democrat Socialist Communist to succeed with their massive Election Fraud be prepared to lose everything you own.    Schools will be closed, freedom of religion will end. Your property will be taxed so high you won't be able to afford a home.
1329168240627511296 2020-11-19 05:02:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won the election on 11/3/2020.   The rest is pure Fraud.  This is disputed only by the people who are part of the Fraud which includes Twitter, Democrats and the main stream lying media.
1329167766780137472 2020-11-19 05:01:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Bill Barr needs to start arresting these people who are threatening canvassers.   What is he doing about this?  He needs to act now.   Where is he?
1329167408792125440 2020-11-19 04:59:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal I'm sick of hearing about this virus.  It has a 99% survival rate and they are using it to implement communism.  No not Socialism    Communism.

1329166147942379520 2020-11-19 04:54:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Congress needs to pass a bipartisan bill and take away Section 230 protection from Twitter.  With more Republicans picking up seats in Congress this can be done.  Repeal Section 230
1329165678155231232 2020-11-19 04:52:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Why isn't the FBI arresting the people who are threatening Republicans Canvassers?    What is the DOJ doing?  Where is Bill Barr  We need to end the Income Tax because we should not be forced to pay these agencies our hard earned tax dollars.
1329165125211758592 2020-11-19 04:50:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump The American people will not allow this Fraud to succeed.

1329163090051485697 2020-11-19 04:42:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They sent in boxes and boxes of Counterfeit ballots all for Biden after the election count stopped.   Every ballot must be audited carefully and checked for signatures.   If this is not done our elections are worthless.
1329162005144510464 2020-11-19 04:38:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> These Democrat Reps need to be ARRESTED for threatening board canvassers on how to vote.    Why are we not seeing this happen?? @realDonaldTrump
1329160475834138626 2020-11-19 04:32:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal How many more signatures do they need and are they still accepting signatures or is it too late for people to keep signing?

I'm sure most of them only had one choice selected and that was for Biden.

The state needs to have a thorough audit and signature check.  If they don't do it hopefully the US Supreme court will make them do it.   We will soon find out if we have a shred of Justice in this country.

1328957415887425538 2020-11-18 15:05:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant @BroStreetJoy I'm not sure.  We have been betrayed so many times I'm not sure I trust the Judges will rule against this fraud.    I've seen Kavanaugh and Gorsuch Cower and vote with the Democrat communists before and Roberts was once an honest Judge and he was compromised and turned left.
1328956458185216000 2020-11-18 15:01:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte I won't accept the results EVER.   If the Courts don't stop this Fraud we will never accept the results.   Sorry to hear you would.
1328955375232675841 2020-11-18 14:57:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @allenbarr1 @newsmax Yes but it just goes to show you how many loyal viewers Fox lost because they stepped all over us and we finally had enough.  I'm not watching Fox at all.  Not even Tucker.  I won't give that network ratings any more.

Remember that when you are tempted to turn on their network in the evening.   Don't do it

1328790185883041797 2020-11-18 04:00:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> Listen to Jack Dorsey lie through his teeth.  Is he  under oath here? Twitter is censoring the President of the United States of America on a daily basis.

1328635327896903680 2020-11-17 17:45:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter has been the worse of all social media for censoring and discriminating against every supporter of the President of the United States of America.  Twitter interfered with our elections and has worked day and night to disenfranchise the votes of 73 Million Americans.
1328633686191874048 2020-11-17 17:38:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter is Censoring the President of the United States of America.  Twitter is Censoring the biggest leader of the Free world.  Let that sink in.  This is what they do in communist countries where they attempt to overthrow governments.
1328632896102404096 2020-11-17 17:35:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SaraCarterDC @USCMom92 Civil Disobedience!
1328631846414938112 2020-11-17 17:31:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax Isn't perjury a felony crime?   Twitter CEO's all lied.  Dorsey lied to Congress and said Twitter does not interfere in the election process and after that hearing he censored the President of the United States 58 times.
1328630663856095233 2020-11-17 17:26:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EmeraldRobinson I think everyone is going to soon hear the word Scytl soon.  Even the lying Main Stream Media won't be able to censor that word...

These Ballots need to be looked at.  How many counterfeit ballots were dumped off at 4 AM?
1328624033772969984 2020-11-17 17:00:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @weejockmaley He is the leader of the Free world.  If he says he won he does not think he won he knows something we don't know.   Regardless what the outcome of this election, Twitter and other social media are going to be in big legal trouble when this is over.

1328615044662263811 2020-11-17 16:24:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @theadam_davis @RealMattCouch President Trump is very confident he won so something happened that the public is not yet been told.    We saw ourselves at 2 AM election night President Trump was 300,000 ahead in Michigan and when we looked at 4 AM all 300,000 of his lead had disappeared...    Definitely a coup
1328611542485458945 2020-11-17 16:10:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thehill It was not an election it was a coup and the cheaters will be caught.
1328571289473331203 2020-11-17 13:30:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @shush19 @BretBaier @GaSecofState Bret is not a "journalist" or a "reporter".  Bret sits behind a computer retweeting fake news instead of doing what a reporter does such as getting up off your chair, going out and seeking truth.   Election Fraud is rampant and we will not accept it.
1328570750270402561 2020-11-17 13:28:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BIGpaulie913 @BretBaier @Barnes_Law Bret is not a real "journalist" or "reporter".  He sits behind a computer and retweets garbage instead of doing what real reporters do such as go out on foot and report the TRUTH.
1328570447781359616 2020-11-17 13:27:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dcostanzo4444 @BretBaier He's not a "journalist" or a "reporter".  He can't go seek truth himself, instead he retweets some bogus liar on twitter.
1328570064094851074 2020-11-17 13:26:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BretBaier Why don't you be a real "reporter" and go out and seek truth instead of retweeting someone else's lies?  Georgia never verified the 100s of thousands of newly DUMPED BALLOTS that came through the back door at 4 AM.
1328569707969081345 2020-11-17 13:24:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EWErickson Enough of your LIES: Georgia never verified the 100s of thousands of newly DUMPED BALLOTS that came through the back door at 4 AM.
1328555208582914048 2020-11-17 12:26:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> How many more ballots have been hidden that we have not found?  This should not be like an Easter Egg Hunt.    @Gasecofstate  Raffensperger should step down too.
1328553375290429440 2020-11-17 12:19:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump These Governors need to be arrested by the US Military and put in Military Prisons.    Enough of this crap.   They are little communist dictators.

1328550745331798019 2020-11-17 12:09:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> Time for Class Action lawsuits against Paypal, Streamlabs, and Tiktok.    Also if they are receiving any Federal funds whatsoever all those funds must be stopped.
1328550344889040896 2020-11-17 12:07:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NickAdamsinUSA The US Supreme court better follow constitutional law or this country may be headed into a Civil War if they allow the Left Wing Democrat Communist Party to give power to Biden via Election Fraud.
1328531716290478080 2020-11-17 10:53:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BrianKempGA    You broke constitutional law by helping Stacy Abrams and the Democrat Party and changing rules right before an election thus bypassing legislator.    Did you really think you'd get away with this fraud?  How much were you paid?
1328527187801120769 2020-11-17 10:35:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Georgia just found 1200 ballots for Trump that were not counted.  How much more of this fraud will be found and why won't the Governor demand audits?
1328526854232309763 2020-11-17 10:34:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Recall these states elections and do it over again.  This time with walk in voters only and have ID to prove who you are.  Paper count only,  No foreign software counters.   Stop the Fraud
1328526058711183360 2020-11-17 10:31:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The "Republican" RINO Brian Kemp Governor of Georgia along with the "Republican" RINO Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger both made deals with the Democrats to overstep current law and help them steal the election. @GovKemp @GaSecofState  RECALL THE ELECTION.
1328467951184351235 2020-11-17 06:40:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DC_Draino @jerseytigger123 Either that or there will be a civil war.   Americans will not be ruled by someone who won via Fraud
1328464885630513153 2020-11-17 06:28:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Shaughn_A2 @ljcambria I thought it was illegal to have our votes stored in a computer.    We need to redo these elections in swing states with Dominion and have only walk in votes with id.  Paper votes.  No computers.

1328456905463762944 2020-11-17 05:56:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Anatharfrost @patriot123123 @GaSecofState All the more reason to cancel the GA Election and have a new one without cheating.
1328456474868080640 2020-11-17 05:54:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JulieP0811 @GaSecofState @RepDougCollins @GovKemp More than losing your vote he should be arrested.  He's complicit in election fraud.  He made a deal with Democrats and changed rules without legislator.  That means GA Election will be cancelled by high court.
1328455720937799681 2020-11-17 05:51:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CIndyStarbuck @GaSecofState @VictoriaQWeaver Because the Georgia Secretary of State is a fraud!

It is their responsibility to act.    Your Sec of State violated constitutional law and made changes without the legislator.
1328454305569931266 2020-11-17 05:46:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @nn1964yue @GaSecofState Yes he did.  Secretary of State of Georgia Brad Raffensperger broke constitutional law and changed rules without legislator to help Democrats steal the election.  By doing so that makes Georgia States election null and void.    You need a new election.
1328453483893125121 2020-11-17 05:42:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @YPastorsteveg @GaSecofState @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA @georgiagov The Secretary of State broke constitutional law by changing rules without the legislators.  Legislators of GA are not doing their due diligence to take action against the fraud.  Your Republican Governor is a coward.
1328452115895762945 2020-11-17 05:37:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Zack_1189 @GaSecofState The GA Secretary of State is a crook.
1328451319879716864 2020-11-17 05:34:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @201Anne @GaSecofState I was surprised to hear that they were allowing computers to hold voter data!  This is total Bull💩  Between the software Dominion and the ballot dumps at 4 AM all for Joe Biden this demands a TOTAL NEW ELECTION
1328450707758800896 2020-11-17 05:31:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @arelab13 @GaSecofState Why won't they verify signatures?  is the Secretary of State of Georgia hiding? Was the Georgia Secretary of state paid off by the Democrats to steal this election?
1328449668578086912 2020-11-17 05:27:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @htommy998 @GaSecofState Recall the Election.  We need a new election without election Fraud.  No mail in ballots.   Vote in person and have ID to prove who you are.
1328449145846173703 2020-11-17 05:25:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GaSecofState   You made a deal with the criminal Democrats to help them STEAL the election. You violated the constitution and overstepped the legislators of GA.   Georgia election will be cancelled and a new election will have to take place because of your deceitful actions.

1328417193516666885 2020-11-17 03:18:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA We need to audit the ballots and toss out the hundreds of thousands of ballot dumped counterfeit ballots that arrived through the backdoor at 4 AM after the election.
1328412666226823169 2020-11-17 03:00:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They are hiding their fraud

1328281583485239296 2020-11-16 18:19:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheMoralLibert1 @ChuckCallesto Yes and I'm so sick of the uneducated, ignorant, dishonest media saying there is no evidence.  They would deny evidence if it bit them in the As$.  Affidavits are evidence.  People, whistle blowers are evidence.   Anyone with the slightest knowledge of law understands that.
1328280984161140736 2020-11-16 18:17:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> Pray for our country.  Pray for 4 more years of President Trump Pray God exposes the fraud to the world.  Ask the Holy Spirit to help President Trumps lawyers and protect all his people and give them insight and wisdom.
1328280681005236226 2020-11-16 18:16:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> Keep Praying for President Trump and that God exposes the evil lefts election fraud.  Keep reminding yourselves how they stopped counting when Trump was winning by a landslide.    Don't listen to the media.  Listen to President Trump and the White House.   President Trump won!
1328280143186386945 2020-11-16 18:13:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KayaJones It's obvious 100s of thousands of counterfeit pre-printed Ballots were dumped around 4 AM after the election with just Joe Biden filled out.   They planned this and that's why they stopped counting when Trump was winning by a landslide.
1328279393534296066 2020-11-16 18:11:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You won hugely!!
1328278807233511424 2020-11-16 18:08:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheMoralLibert1 @ChuckCallesto They need to recount the legal votes, not just recount the same votes.   Audit and recount.  Audit every ballot.   I have no doubt there are 100s of thousands of duplicate, counterfeit ballots added early in the AM after they stopped counting the votes when Trump was winning.

I had no idea they were using computers and let alone connected to the Internet.  We may need to recall the elections in those swing states and have a new election  walk in only.  No mail in ballots unless from military

1328270626553876480 2020-11-16 17:36:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Count all legal votes  Discard the illegal Fraudulent votes.  Discard all votes where poll watchers were denied access and votes counted in secret. (illegal)  TRUMP WINS
1328268234353565696 2020-11-16 17:26:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte President Trump knows more than the public or fake media knows and he is confident.   When he says he won.  He won.

1328251138253090816 2020-11-16 16:18:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto The People of Michigan better come forward as whistle blowers for the election Fraud taking place there unless they want Gretchen Whitmer to take away all their freedom permanently.  Giving Power to Democrats will make it 20 times worse.

1328241116055932928 2020-11-16 15:38:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Because the Fake News Media is complicit in Tyranny and working with the Socialist Democrat Left Party to bring USA into Communism.

1328130942007853056 2020-11-16 08:21:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Qtah17 They said they were going to stop counting and at 2 AM Michigan had trump up by 300,000 votes.  Then when we checked again at 4 AM all 300,000 vote lead disappeared.   This is FRAUD

1328115532810186753 2020-11-16 07:19:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidHerzstein Parler had to update their servers because they were getting more traffic than they could handle.  I was able to log in last night.    I can't wait for President Trump to close Twitter down when he joins Parler.   Twitter will be worse off than Fox News.  @realDonaldTrump
1328114986669903872 2020-11-16 07:17:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidHerzstein I also noticed that the day before yesterday and yesterday.  I am seeing old tweets and less people on.    Went on to Parler last night and its super busy.
1328110740692078592 2020-11-16 07:00:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Keep pleading to God.  Don't stop!  Ask him every day to hear his people.   Continue daily asking him to protect President Trump and put him in office 4 more years to finish cleaning this country from Evil.   Democrat Party is evil.  Democrat Party hates God.
1328109097321840641 2020-11-16 06:54:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> What happened to the Flu?   Did it merge and turn into Covid?
1328108577425293313 2020-11-16 06:52:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KayaJones When is this Fraud going before the US Supreme court?  All 73 Million Americans who voted for President Trump need to be there.
1328108276395831296 2020-11-16 06:51:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> Don't stop praying.  Make God hear you every day.   Pray loudly to him if you can.  Make him hear you daily.  God hear your people.   Protect America from evil Democrat Party.    Protect President Donald J. Trump and put him in office for 4 more years so we can cleanse the evil.

FRAUD is the only way this could have been done.

1328095369348087808 2020-11-16 05:59:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Georgia blatantly defied Judges order to allow election count observers.   All votes that were counted in SECRET must be tossed out!  We will not accept this criminal fraudulent process.

1328089945957777408 2020-11-16 05:38:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JudgeJeanine @Jim_Jordan Toss out all votes after those 4 swing states stopped counting on election night.  President Trump won.  That's why those sneaky cheaters stopped counting.     All votes that came in later after they stopped counting need to be put in a garbage bin.
1328088088409563136 2020-11-16 05:30:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> The reason why not even 1 Republican lost their seat but instead gained seats is because President Trump was on the ticket and they also voted for TRUMP.   We can NEVER accept Fraud in our elections.       President Trump won on election night 11/3/2020  AUDIT THE BALLOTS.
1328086765584826368 2020-11-16 05:25:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Trumps leads were not done in slow motion.  When they "stopped counting" In Michigan at 2:00 AM of election night he was 300,000 votes ahead of Biden and when I checked at 4 AM that lead was completely wiped out.  It's not possible.    FRAUD is the only answer.
1328084564900683778 2020-11-16 05:16:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump Can we please get Lin Woods to sue Twitter for discrimination and interference in an American Election?
1328084196678529024 2020-11-16 05:15:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump The Federal Government should close down Twitter.   It is illegal what they are doing censoring the President his supporters only.    Close Twitter down.

1327847811291906048 2020-11-15 13:36:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RachelandWolf True.  Either Evil or stupid or BOTH
1327847568160694272 2020-11-15 13:35:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump If they do steal it and get power we need to unite on the right.  They don't want us to congregate though but we will do so regardless.  They cannot take away our freedom.  I hope the Military takes our side.

1327842589400199168 2020-11-15 13:15:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant @charliekirk11 Biden was NOT elected and if the Courts Lie and allow a fraudulent Biden to take power we will NEVER accept the results of a stolen illegal election.
1327841206940835840 2020-11-15 13:09:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @charliekirk11 Because the Democrat Party is sending the thugs out to attack us.   This is what they will do if they gain power.   Democrat Party is violent anti God Party.
1327840394428628993 2020-11-15 13:06:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump These Democrat Antifa Cowards who vote for Joe Biden are Domestic Terrorists.  This cannot continue.  We cannot allow Biden and the Democrats to STEAL an election and bring this country down to COMMUNISM.  Send in the Military Mr. President.  Use your Power.
1327839633485434881 2020-11-15 13:03:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Antifa is the Democrat Party.  The violent Party of Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi who want us to Unite.  We will NEVER united with these thugs.
1327837921336983552 2020-11-15 12:56:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> When does the United States Military live up to their oath and protect and defend the United States constitution against foreign and domestic enemies?  @USArmy @USArmyReserve @USMarineCorps @USNavy @usairforce @uscoastguard  Will our Military allow Communism to reign in USA?

1327794272943316992 2020-11-15 10:03:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray And they want to take away your 2nd amendment right to bear arms.   They want to take away your right to call the police too.
1327789147298304000 2020-11-15 09:42:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sassyMoNasty @SandraSmithFox Sandra Smith showing how dishonest she is to all of us by not apologizing and instead acting like she never said what we heard with our own ears and saw with our own eyes.   How arrogant can someone get?

Thank you for not watching.  I also watched many years now I won't turn their channel on.
1327788063351664640 2020-11-15 09:38:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mackywac77 @EmeraldRobinson @SandraSmithFox She has the nerve to lie to us about it as if she never said it.   Yes someone played the clip of the guest that she was referring to when she said what she said.    Lying about it afterwards just makes her look worse.
1327787583103852545 2020-11-15 09:36:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PurdueSean1 @CurtisHouck @FoxNews @SandraSmithFox @newsmax @OANN Instead of apologizing she  tries to LIE her way out of what she SAID.  Fox news producers telling her to lie to us.   TURN OFF Fox News.   TURN IT OFF FOR GOOD
1327786708872486912 2020-11-15 09:33:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @johnnydollar01 @SandraSmithFox She did not set the record straight. We heard what she said off mic and it was in regards to that very guest in the clip.   She's just lying.
1327786473303597056 2020-11-15 09:32:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lgalli4 @SandraSmithFox She's a liar like most of them on @foxnews.  Her  Fox News producers put her on to lie after the fact instead of apologizing.  Disgusting!
1327786102573334529 2020-11-15 09:30:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SebGorka @SandraSmithFox It was real.  We heard you Sandra and we know what you said. We can hear.  We have ears.  You were mad because the guest on your show said Fox does not declare the winner.  Stop lying Sandra.  You were referring to the guest in the video.   You can't lie your way out of that.
1327781512587087872 2020-11-15 09:12:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is what the Democrat Communists want to do to all of us if we "unite" with them.  I will NEVER unite with them.
1327771330641489923 2020-11-15 08:32:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MyJoze @realMikeLindell That's what Fox wants.  Using you to turn on their network and give them ratings.   Tucker, Hannity can leave the network or you can watch clips on the internet of their show.  If you turn on Fox news you are supporting the Left.
1327765014963384320 2020-11-15 08:07:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump These thugs are the people that want to take away your 2nd amendment once they get you to "unite" with them.   These thugs are the people who will defund and get rid of the Police Departments across the nation if Joe Biden takes office.    We will NEVER unite with these thugs.
1327764147279261697 2020-11-15 08:03:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They want to scare us from protesting in the streets.  We need to organize and defend ourselves when going out in the streets and this just convinces me that we all need to go out in the streets and protest without fear.   FIGHT BACK

A recount does not prevent FRAUD. Unless this Secretary of state is covering up the Fraud then he needs to do a complete AUDIT.  We the people are watching. 👁️ Transparency only or NEW ELECTION

1327531926404534273 2020-11-14 16:40:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ScarfyConly Joe Biden will be conceding. You don't lose to cheaters.
1327522690899595266 2020-11-14 16:04:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 They lied.  Jack lied to congress.   Regardless the outcome of this election they will not get away with lying to congress and interfering in our elections.  They also broke election laws.

1327487630540300291 2020-11-14 13:44:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Sadly, many Americans have no spine.  There will need to be a fight if Americans are going to defend their liberties/constitution.   Will the military be on the side of those who are trampling our Constitution?  Has the Military betrayed their oath to defend it?  We shall see
1327486661777707008 2020-11-14 13:40:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They say history shows no country has held onto their form of government longer than 200 years.  Sadly it appears this country is going to fall into socialism/communism.  It won't be pretty.
1327482458242052096 2020-11-14 13:24:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @atensnut @misstrumpladydi I refollowed you.

1327402182866395136 2020-11-14 08:05:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter is hiding tweets that have to do with the election.   It's obvious.   I've been on Twitter since 2009 and somethings off today....
1327401180578803713 2020-11-14 08:01:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> Something is off with Twitter you guys! Not getting information.  I think many tweets are invisible.  May want to go to Parler.
1327400096099573760 2020-11-14 07:56:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> What is going on today?  Why am I only seeing old retweets? Is Twitter making tweets invisible.

1327393023118872576 2020-11-14 07:28:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile I think Barr is  useless.   So sad for our President.
1327392786203570178 2020-11-14 07:27:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ronnieverruto Georgia is conducting a FAKE RECOUNT.    Demand a real Recount. @realDonaldTrump
1327392548772450306 2020-11-14 07:27:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ronnieverruto This is not a recount!  A true recount means that both Republican and Democrats must inspect each ballot.   @realDonaldTrump   Stop the Steal
1327390796341907456 2020-11-14 07:20:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please tell your Lawyers that the GA Recount is not being done properly.

1327387899822706688 2020-11-14 07:08:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile Is the Georgia recount a real recount?  https://t.co/k1Kq321TFl
1327374260608765952 2020-11-14 06:14:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NikkiUSA7 @atensnut Sandra Smith is incredibly arrogant and dishonest.  Wow!
1327365215302742016 2020-11-14 05:38:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @halgregory5 @EmeraldRobinson @SandraSmithFox And still waiting for an answer from @realMikeLindell Mike Lindell to see if he is going to stop sponsoring @foxnews. Does he still want us to buy his pillows or will he advertise on another network?
1327174028650377216 2020-11-13 16:58:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Dominion voting should be illegal.
1327173184223776770 2020-11-13 16:55:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @classygal21 @RealJamesWoods This is why Fox News will go bankrupt.  Nobody is watching them now.  @FoxNews
1327171302461825024 2020-11-13 16:47:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bandmom74 I had to completely stop watching Fox news after election night.  Before that I was only watching a couple shows in the evening.  Now I can't even watch at all.  Every time you turn on Fox news you are helping the Democrat Party.  Fox news betrayed America.
1327169973358186498 2020-11-13 16:42:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump This is a more factual accurate election result Map.  https://t.co/NAomUdOkF3
1327167558407974913 2020-11-13 16:32:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> Listen to our President.  Listen to the White House. The media is LYING to you! President Trump won the election on 11/3/2020 They stopped counting when they knew he was winning after they determined how many more counterfeit ballots they needed to produce.
1327089400220508160 2020-11-13 11:22:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump If we allow Biden/Kamala to steal this election with the massive Fraud they will close down the entire country again.
1327074669946552320 2020-11-13 10:23:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newtgingrich @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle We're done with Fox News.   Go on another network please.

1327072138142965760 2020-11-13 10:13:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EmeraldRobinson How much money is Fox losing?  I wonder how many advertisers are leaving?   Do the advertisers pay Fox a lot less money?
1327062803534860289 2020-11-13 09:36:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gowings12 ummm,  I don't think so...
1327061746201202688 2020-11-13 09:32:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheLeoTerrell @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Go on Newsmax or Oann.  We can't watch Fox any more.  Not even in the evenings.
1327060391386439683 2020-11-13 09:27:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Tucker should leave Fox.  We will watch video clips after his show but will not tune into Fox News channel.
1327038367188455425 2020-11-13 07:59:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @funnygirlmimi Yes, it's as if they want to show how they look inside so they go out of their way to look that way outside.
1327038093602426881 2020-11-13 07:58:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> I agree.  They need to move faster.
1327036834317144064 2020-11-13 07:53:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pnjaban You're only following 2000 people so it's not us who are sending you DMs.
1327036475129561088 2020-11-13 07:52:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto @FormerLiberal74 Because they cheated and they don't want to get caught.
1327033703499927552 2020-11-13 07:41:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile How low do you think it will go?    Will it even survive Penny stock status?
1327032030706626560 2020-11-13 07:34:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> Thanks to President Trump:
1327031224351682560 2020-11-13 07:31:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax @realDonaldTrump @ChrisRuddyNMX The Fake Press and the New York Times are guilty of Election Fraud.  They are complicit in the Fraud. @nytimes

1327029759256084481 2020-11-13 07:25:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CubHayden @EvanAKilgore I think sometimes he has bad advisers when it comes to hiring certain people.  He's not a politician.
1327029265037099008 2020-11-13 07:23:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BillClinton The election is not over.  Joe was not elected. Stop spreading misinformation.

1327027491035246592 2020-11-13 07:16:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MAGAJulesS Right!  Why stay with a News Corporation so corrupt and dishonest that they went so far as to sway an election with lies.    I won't watch anyone on Fox News.

1327026697699409920 2020-11-13 07:13:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CubHayden @EvanAKilgore Hiding under his desk!  He may be worse than Jeff Sessions was.
1327024175937032192 2020-11-13 07:03:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson Dude, you made big bucks working there.   You're rolling in cash and can afford to quit and join another network or start your own.  Get out of there.  It's a sinking ship.
1327021945527812098 2020-11-13 06:54:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah We should all be marching/picketing with signs.  What is DOJ doing about this?  Where is Bill Barr?  Is he hiding under his desk like Jeff Sessions did? The liars in the Media should be arrested for Treason.
1327021556925485058 2020-11-13 06:52:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @maga_rose @catturd2 She thinks its stylish but she looks like a complete fool with a muzzle on.
1327014288200855553 2020-11-13 06:23:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChrisRuddyNMX @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Keep your network honest.  Just because we left Fox and are watching Newsmax does not mean we are stuck.  There is other competition out there.   You are on a probationary period.   So keep it truthful.
1327013802714439680 2020-11-13 06:21:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Herhealthynews @catturd2 Great idea.  They are wearing disposable masks and not throwing them away.

1327012775659409408 2020-11-13 06:17:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 Maybe the masks are making it worse?   People are constantly wearing the same mask every day and touching their masks constantly.
1327012398989864961 2020-11-13 06:16:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won.  Don't listen to the Media. Listen to the President and listen to the White House.   Massive election fraud taking place.    Dominion software tabulating Trump votes for Biden.    Poll workers hiding ballots from observers.       Media is lying to you.  🐍

Intentional and unintentional.   We should NOT be using computer software to count our votes.    This needs to STOP
1326988149608779776 2020-11-13 04:40:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax @seanspicer How do you audit a ballot from 10 feet away?   This is pure nonsense!
1326987395133128704 2020-11-13 04:37:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax @seanspicer Word is out that this Newsmax host speaking in this clip is a never Trumper and he has shown that on the airwaves.   Perhaps Oann is a better choice?
1326985823057657856 2020-11-13 04:30:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @OANN Why did it take a Judge over a week to rule on a law that already exists?  Should have been ruled in 1 day
1326985016211951616 2020-11-13 04:27:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealJamesWoods Twitter should be shut down by the Federal Government.  They are censoring too hard to hide election fraud.  It's obvious.  They lied to congress.
1326983671203516416 2020-11-13 04:22:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JamesDoss50 @imjdsharp @realDonaldTrump @ChanelRion @OANN They have been cheating in California for years and they decided to use California's cheating plan across the USA.

1326982325393969152 2020-11-13 04:16:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Google was censoring them before the election.  Not sure.  They were never this timid in the past.
1326981938624675841 2020-11-13 04:15:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1776Stonewall I knew this was going to happen and I had no doubt they would be printing millions of fraudulent ballots.  That's why they stopped counting when President Trump was winning. They saw the tally and knew how many more ballots they needed to pump into the machines
1326980819047440384 2020-11-13 04:10:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Have you noticed how timid Breitbart website has been the last few days?  As if they are afraid now.
1326980336274706433 2020-11-13 04:09:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Thanks.   We need to make sure @newsmax remains truthful and if they are going to turn into Fox news I'll stop supporting them real fast.
1326979634190143489 2020-11-13 04:06:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 @BreitbartNews   I hope Breitbart is not going to end up like Drudgereport.   Somethings up with them.
1326978419192549377 2020-11-13 04:01:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @SenJohnKennedy @MariaBartiromo @TheJusticeDept We have no law and order coming out of our Justice Department.  It's really sad to watch them betray our President and the American people.
1326977963963740160 2020-11-13 03:59:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @scrowder @realDonaldTrump Big Tech needs to be sued by we the people.

1326976216155344896 2020-11-13 03:52:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BreitbartNews  Please don't turn left like the Drudge Report did.
1326975495804579840 2020-11-13 03:49:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> Breitbart website seems timid the last few days.
1326974524273790981 2020-11-13 03:45:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Readingpets @realDonaldTrump @ChanelRion @OANN President Trump won!  They attempted a coup by spying on his campaign in 2016.  People should be in prison.  Bill Barr needs to do his job.   They tried for 4 years to unseat a duly elected President and now they are doing it again via election FRAUD

1326848360754503686 2020-11-12 19:24:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @carolepheart @SandraSmithFox @FoxNews I think most of these fakes at Fox News pretended to be conservative to get a job there.  I'm so glad they've been showing their true colors the last few months. This one just got caught on a hot mic.    Don't ever trust Fox news again.
1326845664899166208 2020-11-12 19:13:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Any contested election cannot be called.   The media outlets like @foxnews who declared Biden the Winner are full of S^it.
1326845383373332481 2020-11-12 19:12:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mlynne3 @Ziggyfan_1 @Pismo_B @FoxNews @SandraSmithFox Amen! I'm sure many who work in the media and Democrat Politicians are possessed.  The Democrat Party is possessed.
1326844282595020800 2020-11-12 19:08:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Trumps ahead.  https://t.co/sYZxYA5e2j
1326843397651394561 2020-11-12 19:04:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jimrutenberg @KathrynAMurdoch @NYTnickc @reidepstein This alone is all the evidence you need.  In America it's against the law to cover windows and kick out poll watchers to stop them from watching ballots being counted.  Anyone who denies that fact is just a liar.   https://t.co/hHzcXYMARD
1326841494355894275 2020-11-12 18:57:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> Yes,  Communist China mass printed millions of counterfeit mail in ballots.  I have no doubt.  China planned this.  Biden probably knew all about it.
1326838172987260928 2020-11-12 18:44:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 I wonder if Twitter is suppression tweets or making them hard to see.
1326838035477008384 2020-11-12 18:43:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Nothing new.  like it froze
1326837951511232512 2020-11-12 18:43:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Yes, I noticed that!!!
1326837850608824320 2020-11-12 18:42:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Yes,  I believe we are headed towards a civil war if they are allowed to cheat and put Biden/Harris in the White House.  We won't recognize our country.  If you think Covid was crazy wait and see what's going to happen if these Communists take power.
1326837223367405568 2020-11-12 18:40:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jmbenson1491 @lanaurey They can print counterfeit ballots already filled out with the candidate filled in.  That's one of the reasons why PA refused to allow poll watchers to see the ballots.  They all look the same.
1326836532494262272 2020-11-12 18:37:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Yes, they need to just be honest.  Lets not even use the word conservative.  HONEST.  You are right.
1326835361591353346 2020-11-12 18:32:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Well, no network will be perfect and for the most part they are very conservative (honest).   Fox is right up there with CNN.  Ive been complaining about Fox for a long time. (years).  I'm glad people are waking up.  Too bad it took Fox sabotaging our election to wake them.
1326833812433592321 2020-11-12 18:26:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Maybe they fired him.  I think they will be really good for a long time because they want ratings from us.  We can always stop watching them too if they get out of line.  Fox has been bad for years and we put up with it so I'll take Newsmax over fox. Oann is good too.
1326831943388864513 2020-11-12 18:19:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @cjtruth ? What did Newmax do?   So far they've been great.   What clip are you talking about?  I don't have them on my tv yet
1326831089327906816 2020-11-12 18:15:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Ziggyfan_1 @Pismo_B @FoxNews I feel sorry for her husband if she has one

Just the fact that they denied observers to watch the counting is fraud.   You Democrats are immoral, evil people.  You worship abortion of babies in the womb and you condone infanticide.  It's easy for you to lie.   God is on our side!

1326759747337420800 2020-11-12 13:32:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealOmarNavarro I wonder how much money Fox news is hemorrhaging.  Do advertisers pay them a lot less money?
1326758924733706240 2020-11-12 13:29:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealOmarNavarro I dumped Fox News and will never go back.   The couple good people who are still on i will watch video clips on the internet.   No way am going to let them betray me again.
1326754700205592576 2020-11-12 13:12:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realMikeLindell   Is Mike Lindell still advertising on Fox News?  I hope not.
1326753587431550976 2020-11-12 13:07:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, isn't there something you can do about Twitter violating the election laws by constantly censoring every tweet with evidence of election fraud?  Why is this allowed?  Government should shut them down.
1326747278216990721 2020-11-12 12:42:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bisonfred @EmeraldRobinson @FoxNews You should not turn on Fox news at all.  Not even for Tucker or Laura Ingraham.  Watch their videos later on the internet.  Every time you turn on Fox News you help Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
1326745714223845376 2020-11-12 12:36:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thepeterjpappas @EmeraldRobinson @FoxNews They can't undo the damage they created.  Fox News caused many people to not vote when they lied and called states way too early for Biden.  We can and will never watch, not even Tucker or Laura.  Hopefully they leave Fox news.   We cannot give them ratings.

They created it let them lose all their wealth and if we go socialist I and millions others will protest and demand the Government seize their assets.
1326718496932155393 2020-11-12 10:48:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @M_hilco @Melissawins1 @KathrynAMurdoch Is Cher or Lady Gaga paying their fair share?  I don't think so!  It's not fair for them to hold on to millions of dollars.  The Socialist Government MUST take away 95% and give that to the people.  Their mansions used for homeless.

We will demand their mansions be given to the Government for all the homeless and poor the liberals care so much about.
1326715831489720320 2020-11-12 10:37:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MMFlint  You have too much money!  If you succeed in your push to bring this country down to Communism, Socialism the American people will demand the Government take away your wealth. Open your mansions up to the homeless.   You will be allowed thousands not $ millions Fairness

If we are going to destroy our economy and force everyone to live in Socialism, Communism why allow the ones who forced it on us to keep their property, enormous welath?  More people should think this way.

No, if we have to live in poverty so do they!!

1326710477796175877 2020-11-12 10:16:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @M_hilco @KathrynAMurdoch Tax them a 95% tax rate
1326706534512955393 2020-11-12 10:01:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @M_hilco @KathrynAMurdoch If we the American working class have to suffer under socialism the rich celebrities and liberal media heir's must not be allowed to retain their wealth.    Government will have to take away their mansions, fancy $300,000 cars and government must deplete their bank accounts.
1326705044318662657 2020-11-12 09:55:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KathrynAMurdoch Open all your mansions for the poor and homeless to live in.  Move into an apartment and give your money to the poor.   You're too rich!
1326704432239710210 2020-11-12 09:52:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @M_hilco @KathrynAMurdoch If we lose our country to socialism, communism we all need to petition the government to take away their wealth.  People like the Murdoch's must open their mansions up to the homeless.   I am not kidding.  If we go commie they need to take away their wealth.
1326703952151236608 2020-11-12 09:50:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> If we lose our country to Communist Socialism thus losing our companies, jobs etc.  We all need to then petition the communist, socialist government to go after the rich celebrities and take away their exceedingly huge cash assets and mansions.
1326703221922914304 2020-11-12 09:47:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> Tonight is my 8th night of not watching any Fox news.    It was a hard habit because I really enjoyed watching Laura and Tucker but they will be fine.  They should leave that network.   I feel so much better not turning Fox News on.  Breath of fresh air.
1326702446593286144 2020-11-12 09:44:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Melissawins1 @KathrynAMurdoch If this country goes Communist/Socialist because of people like this, I will petition our government to take away their millions and take away their mansions.
1326702075254771713 2020-11-12 09:43:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @M_hilco @KathrynAMurdoch If this country ends up a socialist country I want the government to also take away the wealth from these rich news station owners.
1326701633028304897 2020-11-12 09:41:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KamVTV @KathrynAMurdoch I hope Fox News is sued for knowingly and illegally cooperating with election Fraud.  The owners of the company should all be sued.

1326683624985423873 2020-11-12 08:29:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CIndyStarbuck @KathrynAMurdoch Kathryn Murdoch sits around in her multi million dollar mansion and drives enormously expensive cars while she works hard at destroying the lives of Working American families.  It is truly disgusting to see these super rich commie snobs work so hard to destroy American Citizens.
1326677873080463362 2020-11-12 08:07:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CIndyStarbuck @KathrynAMurdoch If and when this country is destroyed and turns communist the same government these wealthy heirs endorsed will take away their entire bank account.  If USA goes Commie we will demand they lose their millions.  Demand it.

1326676089389735936 2020-11-12 08:00:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> What Twitter is doing by Censoring all evidence of fraud during this elections is criminal.    Department of Justice needs to do something NOW.    @realDonaldTrump
1326673103406051328 2020-11-12 07:48:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SUPERLIFE @Matthew_4_Trump Americans will have no choice.  Our Constitution cannot be taken away and our Military needs to defend it.
1326672457319673856 2020-11-12 07:45:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you voted for Joe Biden and kamala Harris you are ignorant and Un American.   You hate our freedom and our Constitution and you will regret it months from now if our election is stolen by your Marxist politicians.
1326671640730611712 2020-11-12 07:42:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I know people don't like to hear this but I believe if this election is stolen they will go full on Marxist and this country will go into a civil war.  I hope and pray that does not happen but the left is the one pushing this.
1326669813880483841 2020-11-12 07:35:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Joe Biden is going to close down restaurants and barber shops and CHURCHES again....  It's coming if they steal this election.   Mark my words.
1326669505225895936 2020-11-12 07:33:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump No you don't and no way in hell are they putting their vaccine in my body.
1326669107308081152 2020-11-12 07:32:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> People are sick to vote for a man who speaks about the hair on his legs and how his hair turns blonde and how he sees roaches etc..    Biden is not fit to be President and we know he did not win.   They planned this election fraud months ago and we need to demand indictments.
1326667873402593280 2020-11-12 07:27:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Twitter should not be allowed to interfere in our elections by Censoring the overwhelming evidence of Election Fraud.  Federal Government should close them down.
1326663694315515904 2020-11-12 07:10:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump I'll watch your clip later but not turning Fox News on in my home.  It would behoove you to move to another network that has integrity.
1326663434302181376 2020-11-12 07:09:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Praying for President Trump ever day!    This is not about Republican vs Democrat it is about Good vs Evil.  President Trump is Good.

1326650795664658438 2020-11-12 06:19:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Melissawins1 Yes!  I am just as happy.   Can't wait to make my victory speech in Washington DC or Washington State,  No,  I mean Colorado?   Does it matter?
1326650373717729280 2020-11-12 06:17:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LichenCraig @Angevin1170 Thank you for your support and hard work getting me where I am.   Looking forward to my Victory speech in  Nevada,  I mean Arizona,  no wait.   No, its gonna be in Washington DC State.
1326649181713301504 2020-11-12 06:13:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 Yes, we will all come together.  Just not with the other side.  Just us.
1326648604958683136 2020-11-12 06:10:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LichenCraig @Angevin1170 Yes they will.  Please remember to call me by my rightful Title.  I declare It.
1326647531330129920 2020-11-12 06:06:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 My campaign spent an enormous amount of time and money to achieve this victory.   As your President-Elect, I look forward to uniting all who voted for me.
1326646071943065601 2020-11-12 06:00:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> I clearly won.  Where is the media and why aren't they reporting my win.   All the voters were counted in the Kitchen, at the dog park and outside the Walmart Parking lot.   I am your President.

1326644474122956800 2020-11-12 05:54:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> Thank you for your votes.   I already won among all my friends.  I can't wait to begin my job as President.

The law or the constitution never said the press has the right to lie to the American People.  There freedom of the Press but not Freedom of Fake Press to spread Propaganda Lies.   They must be honest with the American people
1326640866581123072 2020-11-12 05:40:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleysJadefav It's unbelievable how irresponsible, immature and dishonest the Media is today. Just like Drudge Report, I not only stopped watching all Fox news but also stopped going to Fox news @foxnews website.    We are done with Fox News.
1326485418351550466 2020-11-11 19:22:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> Arrogant Fox News is crumbling.
1326481068279570433 2020-11-11 19:05:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump Me too.  I saw the 4 AM dump.  300,000 votes for Donald Trump in Michigan just disappear.    The DOJ better prosecute these cheaters for election fraud and throw the book at them.  Years in Prison.
1326480541470715904 2020-11-11 19:03:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JamesOKeefeIII @Project_Veritas @jacobbogage Richard Hopkins should also demand AOL stop posting false headlines.  I hope adds AOL to a lawsuit along with the Washington Post.     https://t.co/2jU701tYM6
1326477365468405762 2020-11-11 18:50:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 We need to all be loud and speak up.  https://t.co/1lfElqNc4H
1326470683518406656 2020-11-11 18:23:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec He should sue the Washington Post
1326468245331664897 2020-11-11 18:14:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Thanks!!
1326467495193055238 2020-11-11 18:11:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 I hope it causes chaos so the courts, including the US Supreme court think twice before allowing Democrat Communists to steal the election with this election Fraud across the country.
1326466341230948354 2020-11-11 18:06:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 I don't see a link
1326465772458143750 2020-11-11 18:04:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BretBaier You're not covering news.  You're spreading propaganda.  This election is contested due to massive Election Fraud and if you were covering news you'd be covering the evidence which is overwhelming.
1326461413372518400 2020-11-11 17:47:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FoxNews He's not President-elect.  He was not elected and you are an irresponsible, pathetic and unprofessional network.  All you do now is copy fake news CNN.  So glad your viewers are leaving.

1326458422670159874 2020-11-11 17:35:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BetsyGoesGlam @catturd2 @FoxNews No need to send them an email.  Will never watch Fox again.

1326456365838082048 2020-11-11 17:26:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Cernovich Let's hope they lose more viewers.

1326401799486640128 2020-11-11 13:50:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DC_Draino This is the 7th night I have not watched Fox News and my stomach already feels better.  I have more appetite and more energy.   Why do people torture themselves when they keep watching that station only to get betrayed repeatedly?  By Bye Fox News.  Never again
1326401080121569283 2020-11-11 13:47:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 @35Leosa They will be hand counted and there will be Republican observers.
1326400722913685504 2020-11-11 13:45:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pastorlocke @1stAD123 Amen!
1326398104136978435 2020-11-11 13:35:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @GKeile The Socialist Democrats in our state cheat like you would not believe.  They control the storage of the ballots and not enough people are watching them.
1326397603752316929 2020-11-11 13:33:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MichelleSteelCA Congratulations Michelle!   🙂
1326396960312528898 2020-11-11 13:30:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dlgarrison @TheRISEofROD Imagine what she must look like with no makeup.
1326395006664454144 2020-11-11 13:23:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They cheated big time!   We need to RECOUNT EVERY SINGLE LEGAL VOTE.
1326394681907965953 2020-11-11 13:21:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant @DiamondandSilk I just find it scary that anyone would approve of an electronic software to count votes.  Also most of those software counters are connected to the internet.    We need to hand count every ballot and inspect every ballot and make sure it is a LEGAL Ballot.
1326393061828648962 2020-11-11 13:15:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant @DiamondandSilk Who approved to allow computer software to tabulate votes in a Presidential election??
1326392513473736705 2020-11-11 13:13:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Actually if they steal this election they will try to take away our constitution and bring in communism and it will only lead to a civil war.  There will be no uniting.
1326391186920255489 2020-11-11 13:07:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 @realMikeLindell @newsmax @OANN And if Mike Lindell runs his ads on Newmax and Oann I will be sure to tell my friends and family.   Just please not Fox News.  Please because we wont see the ads any more.
1326390741350952960 2020-11-11 13:06:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @JessicaGKwong Polls are BS.  We already know that now.   I don't want to see any more polls. They are all fake

1326387057334374400 2020-11-11 12:51:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal i just sent him another tweet.  A little more stern.  lol
1326386954922029056 2020-11-11 12:51:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realMikeLindell   We are fine buying your pillows, sheets etc as long as you don't advertise on Fox News.    Please stop!
1326386368373813249 2020-11-11 12:48:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal I'm sure he's mad at what they did.  He can find other places to spend his money advertising.
1326386128107302914 2020-11-11 12:47:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal I think we are just disgusted and our stomachs can't take any more of Fox News.  Look how refreshing and honest Newmax and Oann are.   No reason to stick with Fox when they are like CNN
1326385064805081090 2020-11-11 12:43:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal I tweeted Mike Lindell from my pillow twice asking him to stop advertising on Fox News.   I heard me might and hope he does.
1326384776547364865 2020-11-11 12:42:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal They may go off the air.
1326384527976099841 2020-11-11 12:41:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @FoxNews A few friends and family stay to me "but Laura and Tucker are so good we should still watch them"  I tell them to watch clips and not to worry about them.  They are rich and can leave for another network any time.  Giving views to Fox News helps Biden.
1326384115759931394 2020-11-11 12:39:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gop @GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @tedcruz @senatemajldr  If GOP doesn't start getting brave and bold there won't be a Republican party.  Were headed to Socialist because of their weakness
1326382576559382528 2020-11-11 12:33:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @FoxNews I was down to only watching Tucker and Laura for about a year and now I'm not watching anything on Fox.  It no longer exist for me.
1326382314742566913 2020-11-11 12:32:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @95Revere Tucker tweeted a portion of his show yesterday.     The only way I will watch any of these guys is clips.  I won't turn on Fox news again.  As far as I'm concerned that network is gone.
1326378372713287685 2020-11-11 12:17:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @100Trump45 yeah, the clip I saw for tonight was no big deal.   We are not missing anything.
1326376011815149573 2020-11-11 12:07:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Mitrophan_Ruth Thanks!!
1326375930059763712 2020-11-11 12:07:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RichardBoyer719 The producers at Fox news have gone full blown commie.
1326375610286043136 2020-11-11 12:06:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Mitrophan_Ruth @RobertSteck13 @YouTube There is no link
1326375418463723520 2020-11-11 12:05:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please Please Please   Do not ever turn on Fox News again you guys.  I know there are a couple good people there but  you can watch clips later.  They will be fine.  They have made lots of money and can afford to leave Fox news.  What they did to Judge Jeanine is terrible.
1326372816309137409 2020-11-11 11:54:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> I'm no longer watching Fox News ever again.  President tweeted today that Hannity was going to do a show regarding evidence.    Must not have been too good because Hannity never tweeted any part of his clip and I dont see anything on Twitter.   Keep Fox News OFF
1326371743737421824 2020-11-11 11:50:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> Don't let these Communists steal an election  Election Fraud.     I'm so sick of hearing these liars on the media say there is no evidence.  Media is full commie
1326370616677601280 2020-11-11 11:46:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tam4trump @sito0625 They keep saying "no evidence" in the media because they are liars and they are totally ignorant and have no idea what evidence is.
1326369624783347712 2020-11-11 11:42:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryAnn4Trump @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr He needs to fire Wray yesterday!
1326369337851039744 2020-11-11 11:41:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BdieforGOP @JamesOKeefeIII He has a legal case against the Washington Post and against Twitter.
1326368366349570051 2020-11-11 11:37:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @UlyssesJeffers2 @JamesOKeefeIII If we allow these thugs to steal our election this country is going to go full blown Marxist.
1326365187008421888 2020-11-11 11:24:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gop @GOPLeader @SenateGOP @gop
1326364429361926145 2020-11-11 11:21:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealOmarNavarro I find it hard to believe Twitter can't be sued for this.
1326360864367144960 2020-11-11 11:07:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump I hope the postal man Whistle Blower that Twitter is censoring in this tweet sues Twitter.
1326360272148160514 2020-11-11 11:05:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @nedryun @realDonaldTrump I think the most illegal ballots are the counterfeit ones they printed box loads and box loads as insurance in case the President were to win.  That's exactly whey they stopped counting when he was ahead and the dumps occurred at 4AM
1326359799273943040 2020-11-11 11:03:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ScottAdamsSays Just the same way they are telling us we are bad for not believing the lies about Covid and that we must wear a mask while driving.
1326359194681765888 2020-11-11 11:00:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 I think they will
1326358147829673984 2020-11-11 10:56:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 We need too all bite the bullet and I know it's hard because there are still a couple good people left on Fox News but if we turn the station on the network gets ratings credit and the credit does not go to Laura or Tucker it goes to Fox News and they hate us.
1326357766298955777 2020-11-11 10:55:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @stillgray The Liberal communists produces at Fox News are probably making it really difficult for the last couple good people left at Fox news.  They should leave Fox news.
1326356503490539521 2020-11-11 10:50:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @stillgray Who said that?  Why?
1326356312611909634 2020-11-11 10:49:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 Best to watch clips on the internet etc....
1326356224086994945 2020-11-11 10:49:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 Yes it will.
1326338731637309440 2020-11-11 09:39:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray Which is why we don't watch Fox news any more.   Even the few good people left it is not worth giving Fox ratings.   Watch Tucker and Laura via clips on the internet.   Every time you turn on Fox News it gives them relevance and they continue with their fraud.
1326338136918552576 2020-11-11 09:37:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Are they manufacturing more counterfeit ballots in Alaska? @GovDunleavy   Election Fraud

1326335581467537408 2020-11-11 09:26:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> Recount every ballot Recount  Recount  Recount  Recount Recount Inspect the ballots for fraud. Inspect the ballots for fraud. Inspect the ballots for fraud. Inspect the ballots for fraud. Inspect the ballots for fraud. Inspect the ballots for fraud.  Prosecute cheaters
1326332991208091649 2020-11-11 09:16:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Twitter is a Publisher.   They must not be allowed special legal protection against lawsuits when they are outright censoring everyone on Twitter who supports a President during an election. It's outright criminal behavior.  Akin to Communist China tactics.  Repeal section 230
1326331873354678273 2020-11-11 09:12:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KO92792 We know they cheated.  They won't get away with it.

1326329710452723717 2020-11-11 09:03:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter is referring to this tweet as sensitive content.

1326306124870557696 2020-11-11 07:29:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SheriffClarke @newsmax Any conservative who watches Fox News is supporting the destruction of our Constitution.   For the few remaining good people on Fox news it's best to watch a clip.  Don't turn on their Fox News channel because if you do you're just helping Joe Biden by giving Fox $$

Fox News assisting Socialist Communist Democrat party in cheating in order to bring this country down.  Turning on Fox News channel is the same as spitting on your constitutional rights.  Don't enable them

I will watch their clips on the internet but cannot turn on fox news.  They are using Tucker and Laura to get us to watch in the evening for their ratings only.  Tucker and Laura need to leave.  They have the  wealth and ability to leave Fox

1326293598006988805 2020-11-11 06:40:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BretBaier @Sen_JoeManchin When Rupert Murdoch passed away his sons and their liberal, Anti American wives gradually and purposely destroyed the network. @foxnews is just another CNN.   We won't even watch the few good people left on your network because we refuse to give you ratings.    We can watch clips
1326292789982687232 2020-11-11 06:36:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BretBaier @Sen_JoeManchin This election is being contested and there is OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE of Election Fraud in several states but Foxnews @foxnews Ignores it and calls Biden the winner.   Media does not determine the winner.   Fox news is irresponsible and dishonest.
1326291940548079616 2020-11-11 06:33:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @BretBaier @Sen_JoeManchin I wonder if Bret Baier is going to delete his tweet today like he did just the other day when he didn't like the response.   Bye Bye Fox News
1326291725023768576 2020-11-11 06:32:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @BretBaier @Sen_JoeManchin Hey Bret Baier and @foxnews Fox news, we are done with Fox News.  I am no longer turning on Fox News.   Fox News is dishonest and is a Propaganda Machine for the Democrat Socialist party.   I hope Fox news goes Bankrupt and gets pulled from the airwaves.
1326291066232864768 2020-11-11 06:30:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @karenwatson53 It's outright FRAUD!
1326285425472806914 2020-11-11 06:07:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CubHayden He's a liar!
1326284935947169794 2020-11-11 06:05:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump President Trump won this election on 11/3/2020 by a landslide.   Remember they said they "stopped counting"? ?   They stopped counting LEGAL votes.   They counted the illegal COUNTERFEIT ballot dumps that occurred between 2-4 AM in the morning.
1326283758027251712 2020-11-11 06:01:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> Joe Biden is not only an embarrassment for our country he is also dangerous.   He is 78 years old and his memory is slipping really fast.     He's dangerous because he won't be able to finish his Job during the first term and Communist Kamala will become President.
1326282781295484928 2020-11-11 05:57:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @karenwatson53 Yes, that's exactly what happened!  They said they were going to stop counting.  I checked at 2 AM and Michigan had Trump leading by 300,000 votes.  I checked again at 4 AM and his 300,000 lead was GONE.  Vanished!
1326282307683057664 2020-11-11 05:55:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden States stopped counting the ballots on election night because President Trump was winning by a landslide.   4 AM COUNTERFEIT BALLOT dumps were counted even thought they "stopped counting"  Illegal, COUNTERFEIT ballots spit out by your printers don't get counted.    It's Fraud!
1326280995423678465 2020-11-11 05:50:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden You lost the election.  Illegal ballots will be tossed.   States who illegally kicked out Republican Poll watchers will have Ballots tossed because they were counted illegally.    Hiding your cheating by kicking observers out and taping cardboard boxes over the windows is FRAUD!
1326279513462861824 2020-11-11 05:44:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> Joe Biden just made a statement that 71 Million Americans are an embarrassment.   The man who can't remember where he is and campaigned from his basement.
1326278774904692736 2020-11-11 05:41:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> No Joe, @JoeBiden  you are an embarrassment!  You can't even remember where you are.     America did not vote for you.  There is an abundance of evidence of election fraud.     Ballots to be recounted and inspected and you lose this election.  You can't win an election by Fraud.
1326270125859729408 2020-11-11 05:06:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TruthAssassinX9 @ChuckCallesto @foxnews ratings are going down the toilet.  Let them continue to ruin their own company.  TURN OFF FOX NEWS
1326269076637806594 2020-11-11 05:02:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @philipsknowlton Kicking out poll watchers and taping pizza boxes over the windows so they can't watch them count vote is election fraud and those ballots must be thrown out of the count because they are illegal ballots.  PERIOD.   We cannot let them cheat in front of our eyes.
1326268329988743168 2020-11-11 04:59:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @philipsknowlton Amen!  The Media is lying to Americans.  There are only a few good media outlets that are honest.    Massive election Fraud and and the EVIDENCE is Overwhelming, yet these puppet media keep denying the truth.
1326260250580692992 2020-11-11 04:27:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Angevin1170 @newsmax @OANN For the couple good people that still work at Fox news in the evening, I'll just watch their video clips on the internet.  Not falling for @foxnews trap to bring me back in the evening.  I want Fox news to go bankrupt.
1326259766671233024 2020-11-11 04:25:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @charliekirk11 Yes and Bill Barr needs to indict Biden if that's what he's doing.
1326259398440742912 2020-11-11 04:24:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jenaann1027 @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Tucker, Hannity and Ingraham should be looking for a new network to work at.  They are all 3 millionaires and they can afford to leave Fox News.  I don't fee sorry for them.  They just stay because of the $$$.  If they love this country they should go to work for Newmax or Oann
1326254033498112002 2020-11-11 04:02:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> Tonight will be my 7th night not turning on Fox News.   hard habits hard to break but they made it easier for me on election night.   Watch @newsmax or @oann  You can also watch video clips afterwards.
1326249909960364032 2020-11-11 03:46:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> Went to court in PA to allow poll watchers to move 6 feet closer.  When court ruled to move watchers 6 feet closer the PA sheriff moved the counters 10 feet further away and threatened to arrest poll watchers when they objected.
1326245602011746304 2020-11-11 03:29:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> Michigan and PA denied poll watchers from watching the counting.  This is clearly election fraud and those ballots counted while they locked poll watchers out must be thrown out.
1326242680326610944 2020-11-11 03:17:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @VJMachiavelli @newsmax @RCNconnects @ChrisRuddyNMX @johngizzi People need to call their cable, satellite providers and insist they air Newsmax
1326238924390326274 2020-11-11 03:02:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 I also heard that.  If not watermarked it should have been done.
1326238062846767104 2020-11-11 02:59:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Twitter lied to Congress and said they do not and will not interfere in our elections and they are still doing it.  They must be held accountable for this massive censoring
1326236943236046848 2020-11-11 02:55:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @nevrcomplicated @MrsHaley2011 @TuckerCarlson He's a millionaire now.  If he care so much about us or his country he should speak out about his own leftist network that betrayed America and then leave.  He can afford it and can go to another network.  He's not making minimum wage.  I don't feel sorry for any of them.
1326235912343220224 2020-11-11 02:50:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers You're right.  They are all over priced.  Cable and satellite.
1326235500554772480 2020-11-11 02:49:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @gop @GOPChairwoman @SenateGOP @GOPLeader @gop   Why is Alaska not done counting?  More Fraud?
1326111469906223105 2020-11-10 18:36:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> Keep it up.  Don't watch Fox news.  Watch @OANN @newsmax
1326096585260855296 2020-11-10 17:37:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realMikeLindell   Please stop advertising on Fox News.  Fox News lied to us and betrayed us.   Fox news betrayed this country.
1326095792566726663 2020-11-10 17:34:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Donald J. Trump won the election on 11/3/2020
1326088602053304320 2020-11-10 17:05:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Twitter should be shut down by the Federal Government for lying to Congress
1326088375602835456 2020-11-10 17:04:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump If they steal this election it will create division in this country like you have NEVER seen!
1326087914283954176 2020-11-10 17:02:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump If they steal this election we are no longer a free country.  People will try to be upbeat about it and say in 4 years we can do this, do that but in reality the good President Trump did, all that hard work will be gone.  They will destroy this country in a matter of months.
1326087289974427648 2020-11-10 17:00:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Good vs Evil.  Democrat Party is Evil.  That is where we are.
1326085584029315073 2020-11-10 16:53:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Yes, whats up with Alaska?   Less population in that state so you know the votes have to be counted by now.  It's frozen. What are they trying to pull in Alaska?   This is insane!
1326082442847924227 2020-11-10 16:41:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> How much longer are we going to let them force masks over our faces, close our schools, close our churches, take away our freedom of speech, raise taxes and take away your 2nd and 4th amendment and now trying to STEAL an election? How much longer do Americans put up with this?
1326081886507077633 2020-11-10 16:38:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mygippiebird Yes, good word to describe them.   Also vicious because they are animals.  They murder unborn babies in the womb and want to do it all the way to birth and even infanticide. So nothing is sacred to them.  Look what they did to Judge Kavanaugh.  They are truly evil people.
1326081032718671874 2020-11-10 16:35:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RyanAFournier @catsim7 As soon as they begin rioting President Trump will stop the riots in one day.
1326080662168690689 2020-11-10 16:34:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> One thing good that came out of Twitter is we have been able to see the true colors of people.  See how wicked Democrats really are inside.
1326080208286347264 2020-11-10 16:32:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant @The_Eric_Yost I am behind them too!  I hope they go on strike and show the world we won't put up with cheating.
1326080025469222912 2020-11-10 16:31:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> Did George Soros pay these people on Fox News to defend socialism and lie for Biden?  Were they paid off?  Weren't these people at one time decent conservatives?
1326079353545871360 2020-11-10 16:28:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray @McKGraKucPauNad These goons are lying puppets who keep saying their is no evidence when there is OVERWHELMING evidence and Affidavits, Software "gliches" giving Biden trumps votes, witnesses, photos, videos of election fraud, kicking republican observers out, on and on!   They deny reality.
1326077805541556224 2020-11-10 16:22:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Perch313 @SeldenGADawgs @catturd2 Same here.  Keep Fox news turned off!  Find a replacement!
1326075107874283520 2020-11-10 16:11:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 @MMLW61 Watching old TV shows i recorded in the evening instead of Fox news.   Gunsmoke, Bonanza and King of Queens.  Kind of refreshing for a change.
1326045594452815879 2020-11-10 14:14:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FLOTUS Thank you for fighting for the American people.
1326045340051546113 2020-11-10 14:13:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto Trump won
1326045286284759040 2020-11-10 14:13:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto I knew this was happening when I saw Trump lose his 300,000 lead in Michigan after 4 AM after ELECTION NIGHT
1326044171740745729 2020-11-10 14:09:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Woke2008 @JudyWoodruff How do these people look at themselves in the mirror?  So dishonest!
1326043444783902720 2020-11-10 14:06:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @vlb55jr We definitely need to find some attorneys who will bring a lawsuit against these people who are threatening us.
1326043145251909632 2020-11-10 14:04:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bendur6 @JudyWoodruff She's seen the evidence.
1326043025970089990 2020-11-10 14:04:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Woke2008 @JudyWoodruff She knows the truth.  She just won't speak truth.
1326042809426534402 2020-11-10 14:03:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @eyesoftheirish1 @JudyWoodruff They keep lying and saying there is no Evidence when there are going to be hundreds of affidavits.   These people are not journalist.
1326032667972759552 2020-11-10 13:23:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews We're done with Fox News.  We will watch Tucker or Laura on video clips afterwards but no way are we giving them ratings.  We won't turn Fox news on.  No ratings at all for them.  bye bye @foxnews
1326031679488548865 2020-11-10 13:19:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NeverWasABot @JudyWoodruff 136 swown Affidavits and more coming.   They can't continue saying there is no evidence. The evidence of election fraud is OVERWHELMING.   When these puppets keep saying "there is no evidence" we need to just laugh at them.   Pathetic.
1326030406693498880 2020-11-10 13:14:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MiriamRoseMc @JudyWoodruff They don't investigate they are just propagandists for the Democrat party.  They tell lies.  They don't accept truth.
1326029995655847938 2020-11-10 13:12:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JudyWoodruff  That's because it was not free and fair.  Your side committed blatant Election Fraud.  Your side kicked out all the poll watchers which is illegal.  Your side used counting software that gave thousands of votes to Biden that belonged to Trump.    Be truthful
1326027393014771712 2020-11-10 13:02:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @allenbarr1 Let's keep praying every day!  God wants us to turn to him.   Before I pray for President Trump I first think how hard he worked for us at all those Rallies and all those people.   Then I say a prayer for our President and for our country and for the Fraud to be exposed.
1326025860726484992 2020-11-10 12:56:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> Wow!  threatening to come after your livelihood if you don't  conform to their Fraud.  Is this a sample of what they do to compromise members of the court, (Justice Roberts) and members of Congress (Mitt Romney) others? threats? blackmail?
1326020765146206210 2020-11-10 12:36:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RedWingGrips @MaryFass3 Especially if PA and Michigan were in play.
1326012798782959616 2020-11-10 12:04:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle Thank you for tweeting this Laura.  We no longer watch @foxnews and will never be able to watch your show because it gives Fox ratings.  I hope you leave Fox News so we can follow you.   It is difficult not being able to watch.   Good luck with your show.
1326012141397106688 2020-11-10 12:01:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> CNN should be sued.  Look at how they twist the news.  "unsupported allegations"   The allegations are supported by half the country.
1326010537537269762 2020-11-10 11:55:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> Fox News producers did this.  @TuckerCarlson
1326009996098760705 2020-11-10 11:53:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson @foxnews Fox News Censored @PressSec when speaking today.   This is akin to what they do in Communist China.    I hope Fox news loses so many viewers they go bankrupt.
1326005720584613888 2020-11-10 11:36:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MadDogVela Took me a year to convince my mom to stop watching Fox News.  She feels bad for the conservative people like Tucker, Laura and said they work there etc.  I reminded my mom that these people are multi millionaires and they will be just fine if she stops watching.
1326004297784438786 2020-11-10 11:30:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MrsHaley2011 @TuckerCarlson Tucker's producers wanted him to tweet this because its called damage control.  They want us to tune in at night because their ratings are tanking.  Don't fall for it.  They betrayed us and they lied. They viciously attacked our President.  They were complicit in election Fraud
1326003656269864961 2020-11-10 11:28:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NRepasky @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews We are just the little working people.  I could never imagine making as much money as these hosts do on Fox news and to think all these years since 1997 I promoted Fox News and watched them daily along with everyone else.  We made them rich and they betrayed us.
1326003135492452354 2020-11-10 11:25:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LDL337 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Fox news went after our President maliciously.  Fox news can never be trusted if you want the Truth.
1326002820949045248 2020-11-10 11:24:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @twosmiles5 @TuckerCarlson Fox news hates our President and Fox news hates us.  I hope their ratings go below CNNs
1326002559593504769 2020-11-10 11:23:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BMW2006 @TuckerCarlson But if you turn Fox news on even to watch Laura, Hannity and Tucker you are giving Fox news ratings.  It's best to wait and see it on a video clip.    Every time you turn your TV on to Fox news it helps Joe Biden.
1326001854556241920 2020-11-10 11:20:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @krcotney @TuckerCarlson My faith not fully restored in Tucker unless he sends a personal tweet acknowledging that his company he works for is run by liberals and they lied.
1326001557159043072 2020-11-10 11:19:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Shannonsheeha18 @TuckerCarlson If "they heard us" is true like Tucker said why didn't Tucker admit that his own network lied and assisted in election Fraud?  Why can't be be brave and send a tweet telling us @foxnews decision desk are liars? Sorry Tucker.  Not coming back to Fox.
1326000876243230720 2020-11-10 11:16:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KernsNini @TuckerCarlson President Trump won the election on 11/3/2020  The rest is FRAUD
1326000596554444807 2020-11-10 11:15:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @digger_geensen @TuckerCarlson @fedagentmark Yes,  Everyone please, if you like Tucker and Laura watch them on video clips on the internet.  Do NOT turn your TV onto Fox News.  The producers are using these two to get you to stay.   Don't give Fox News ratings.  The owners hate you.
1326000269096673281 2020-11-10 11:14:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SouthTX_ @TuckerCarlson Tucker and Laura  @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson  should leave and go to work for Newsmax or Oann.  @foxnews will do to them the same thing they did to Judge Jeanine.   Fox news is Evil
1325999736034217984 2020-11-10 11:12:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cckwr @TuckerCarlson @Yodie49784194 Newsmax and Oan.   More to come!!!!
1325999597823483906 2020-11-10 11:11:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellsBellsSC @TuckerCarlson Tucker, you are financially well off because of your faithful conservative viewers who use to watch Fox News.  You can afford to quit and go to work for an honest network and take in less money.   If you really care about your country leave Fox News.  We can't watch it any more.
1325998871894319104 2020-11-10 11:09:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CyberRabid @daverich503 @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I'm fine watching Tuckers videos that he sends out but will NOT give Fox News channel ratings.  We don't watch Fox News any more.   Thanks for the video Tucker.
1325997618221084673 2020-11-10 11:04:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson We will never trust Fox News.  They are liars.
1325997203861590016 2020-11-10 11:02:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson I agree with you but you are wrong when you were talking about polls and said that Trump was down 3%.   Trump won.
1325989651987931136 2020-11-10 10:32:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson @foxnews allowed you Tucker to speak freely because they are losing billions of dollars from loss of viewers.   We will continue to watch any videos you send out but we will NOT watch Fox News Station.

1325985832570818561 2020-11-10 10:17:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice @TuckerCarlson We are not watching Fox news regardless how good Tucker and Laura are.  We can watch clips like this but we won't watch Fox news.   Viewing Fox news is giving legitimacy to election Fraud.    bye bye @foxnews

1325979983416762369 2020-11-10 09:53:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jim_Jordan Because they were cheating.  Why else?

1325978816821436423 2020-11-10 09:49:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr @TuckerCarlson Stop watching Fox news.
1325978745203617792 2020-11-10 09:49:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr @TuckerCarlson WE are not watching Fox News.  You should not watch it either.  I know Tucker is good but when you turn on Fox news you are helping the Democorats.
1325978039654604800 2020-11-10 09:46:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant @wemophil Same here!  Turning on Fox News is basically supporting Joe Biden.
1325977623919423489 2020-11-10 09:44:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealMattCouch Can we believe him?
1325977503647768577 2020-11-10 09:44:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto God hear our prayers!  Hear us Lord.   Help your people Lord and defend the unborn in the womb.  Dear God please expose this election Fraud.  Hear us Lord!  Thank you Lord!
1325977191654416386 2020-11-10 09:42:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Legally all those votes must be cancelled.  They are illegal ballots.
1325977032841256960 2020-11-10 09:42:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please pray that God gives Bill Barr courage to fight this election fraud coup.  Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to enlighten all inspectors where to look and find every aspect of Fraud.  Pray US Supreme Court is blessed with integrity.
1325976463145754624 2020-11-10 09:39:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ShannonBream Thanks but still not watching Fox News any longer.  old habits are hard to break.  For the sake of freedom and election integrity we are done with Fox news.
1325975788043161600 2020-11-10 09:37:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Assetwrs @wemophil Amazon will be difficult but I'm working on cutting back to start.
1325975230074953728 2020-11-10 09:35:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @wemophil @TuckerCarlson @realMikeLindell  Please stop advertising on Fox News.  They have betrayed our country.
1325974844542889984 2020-11-10 09:33:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please don't look at this as a boycott. Look at is as saving your country from Tyranny!  Please let these advertisers on Fox news know that you will stop buying their product.  And stop buying it.  Really do it. Old habits are hard to break but we can do it for freedom. @wemophil
1325974148259012609 2020-11-10 09:30:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @wemophil @TuckerCarlson Thank you Wendy!!!
1325973832478326784 2020-11-10 09:29:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KelleyTori After a couple more weeks we will be over the habit. Tucker and Laura will be ok.  They made a lot of money working there and they will be able to leave and find another network or start their own.
1325973267656581121 2020-11-10 09:27:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump Yes
1325972746451316737 2020-11-10 09:25:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is my 6th night of not watching a couple good hosts on Fox News.  It's kind of like when you stopped smoking. it's hard to kick it but I am so happy I am doing it. I love our President and I cannot give ratings to a network that betrayed us and is complicit in election fraud
1325971821489868800 2020-11-10 09:21:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump TYRANNY
1325971636340707328 2020-11-10 09:20:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> No need to watch your favorite hosts on Fox News.  President Trump and others will send us the clips.   Don't watch Fox News even if there are still a couple people who are really good.   Turning on Fox news gives support to this Coup.  Don't do it.
1325971187596292096 2020-11-10 09:19:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Whatisgoingon19 @RonnyNWood @dbongino What they did to Judge Jeanine was the icing on the cake.
1325970797832278016 2020-11-10 09:17:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 The two or three people that are still decent on Fox News can afford to leave and join another network.  Tuning into Fox news even to watch your favorite host helps steal the election by giving Fox News ratings.   Hard habits are difficult to break but we can do it!!
1325970142405165057 2020-11-10 09:14:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RonnyNWood @dbongino Anyone who continues to watch fox news is giving them ratings and they are helping the Democrats steal this election.   Watch it later on internet clips.  Do not record or watch Fox News if you love this country.
1325968952510435329 2020-11-10 09:10:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> Don't tune into Fox News.  If you do you are supporting Joe Biden.  Yes, Tucker and Laura are great but you can watch video clips on the internet after their show.  Even recording their show gives Fox News money and ratings.  Tucker and Laura are wealthy and they can leave Fox.
1325967940286521344 2020-11-10 09:06:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Rockprincess818 We won't watch Fox News.  Even though I like Laura and Tucker a lot we will watch the clips later on the internet.   Can no longer tune into their network. They betrayed us and they are complicit in stealing this election.  They support Tyranny.
1325967494310363136 2020-11-10 09:04:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> Keep it up.  Don't watch Fox news regardless of the couple good hosts in the weekday evenings.  If you turn on Fox News you are not a Patriot.   Any ratings to Fox news helps steal this election. Stop!  Watch clips of your favorite host on the internet later.
1325967131276582912 2020-11-10 09:02:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SheriffClarke Tucker, Hannity and Laura Ingraham are good but we can no longer tune into Fox News.  We can watch their clips later on the internet.  They are wealthy enough to quit and find another network @OANN @newsmax or start their own.  Giving Fox news ratings helps steal the election.
1325966415074004993 2020-11-10 09:00:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte It's hard to tell.  I think Chris Wallace is one of the worse.   No longer watching Fox at all.  The good host we will watch clips on the internet.  Hopefully they move to another network.  They have the ability to do that.
1325965972486774784 2020-11-10 08:58:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MikeMan67771347 @FoxNews How did you find out?
1325965772309422081 2020-11-10 08:57:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> It's 5pm, 8 eastern time  I am not watching Fox News.  Tucker is great but he can find another network and he's wealthy enough to leave them.  Watch clips later on the internet.  Who else is not watching Fox news no matter what?
1325965448878329856 2020-11-10 08:56:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you are turning on Fox News you are supporting election fraud and the stealing of an election.  Watch clips later on the internet.   Do not support Fox news, regardless who is hosting.    Turning on Fox news helps the Democrats.  Don't give them your rating.  Not even 1 viewer
1325963502691872768 2020-11-10 08:48:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @US_FDA President Trump Won this election. Americans will not tolerate this Election Fraud.
1325959376453001216 2020-11-10 08:32:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NancyAmerican @Beverly04990771 @TuckerCarlson Watch it later on video clip from the internet.  If you turn on Fox news your helping the Steal the election by giving them  your rating
1325959120013291521 2020-11-10 08:31:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WinningWwg1wga @TuckerCarlson @newsmax @OANN Tucker will be fine.  He's made millions and is a very wealthy man.  He can leave Fox news and go to work for an honest network.  We like him a lot but we can no longer stomach Fox news.
1325958555053125632 2020-11-10 08:28:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @wemophil @TuckerCarlson Please give us that list of advertisers.   I swear I will not buy their product if they continue to advertise on Fox news.   Is there a list??  I won't even call this boycotting.  I call it being an American.
1325948249975345153 2020-11-10 07:47:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Joe Biden will never be my President.  STOP THE STEAL
1325948064935280641 2020-11-10 07:47:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> Most of my family and friends have decided NOT to turn on Fox News in the evenings even thought there are a couple good remaining people on the network.  @FoxNews   Tuning into Fox News no matter who the host is just gives Fox News ratings and $$.  Fox news hates you!!
1325947571773169664 2020-11-10 07:45:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> I understand there are still a couple good people left on Fox News in the evenings but PLEASE don't tune into Fox News.  Watch it later on clips on the internet.   Do not watch @foxnews.  They are not your friend.
1325947234165301248 2020-11-10 07:43:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Fox news is going to lose billions of dollars.   Billions!  I kid you not.
1325946891255701504 2020-11-10 07:42:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson Leave @foxnews and we will follow you to another network.  @newsmax @OANN   We think your great but we cannot tune into Fox News any longer.   Eventually they will do to you what they did to Judge Jeanine
1325946426099073024 2020-11-10 07:40:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> Patriots, please wish Tucker well but do not turn on @foxnews   Watch the clips of his show afterwards on the internet.    Just tuning into Fox News helps them with ratings and helps support the election fraud.
1325945824061267970 2020-11-10 07:38:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson We really like you a lot Tucker but we will watch the clips.   Can't watch Fox news any longer.  We cannot support a dishonest network.  They are only holding on to your show for ratings.   @foxnews
1325944695919239173 2020-11-10 07:33:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SandraSmithFox We will never watch Fox news again!  @FOXNEWS   You are complicit in Election Fraud
1325944170934988800 2020-11-10 07:31:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @hrkbenowen No, we are done with the NFL
1325942532128169984 2020-11-10 07:25:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec It's a shame they didn't do that earlier.

1325937917391499266 2020-11-10 07:06:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> Attention Patriots,   You need to start retweeting every tweet you see that shows  Election Fraud because the Media won't do it.   Copy the links and email and text also.  Just liking a tweet is not getting the message out.  You need to do more than that.
1325937433372884995 2020-11-10 07:04:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Acosta The Media is complicit in Election Fraud and we will never accept this fraud.   You have no integrity.
1325937017742503936 2020-11-10 07:03:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won the election on 11/3/2020
1325935816728670209 2020-11-10 06:58:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile @Tim_Poole_ @FoxNews Every time you turn on Fox News  you are helping them with the Steal by giving them ratings.    For the few good people on Fox News just watch the clips on your computer.    Do not listen to the news, listen to our President and the White House.

1325912068386557952 2020-11-10 05:24:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @victor7015f It is not easy to find honest networks.  Thank God for the few we have.   @OANN @BreitbartNews @newsmax
1325911746884689920 2020-11-10 05:22:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> Fox news @foxnews is evil
1325911192473280512 2020-11-10 05:20:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> There is evidence across the country of massive election fraud.  The puppets in the media who keep saying "there is no evidence" are either total idiots or outright liars.
1325910303951876096 2020-11-10 05:17:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> The 6000 ballots were for Trump went to Biden.  This was a computer "glitche".  There are more in other states.  Their will be more "glitches"  Call it what you will.   Bottom line it is election fraud.
1325906551010287616 2020-11-10 05:02:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> Rampant Voter Fraud in 5 states.   Anyone who keep saying "there is no evidence" is a LIAR
1325905930274304000 2020-11-10 04:59:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax Joe Biden is the loser.
1325905782798364672 2020-11-10 04:59:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newsmax No, we the American people are not going to allow the Media and the Democrat Left criminals to steal our election.  There is an abundance of evidence throughout the country that they cheated.
1325905162209173504 2020-11-10 04:56:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jtsaward There is an abundance of evidence of election fraud and we all know it.   Don't listen to the media @foxnews.     Listen to the President and the White House.   Media is LYING
1325904426624675841 2020-11-10 04:53:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rrice78793 It's disgusting to see how complicit the media is in this Fraud, especially @foxnews Fox News.
1325903909936771073 2020-11-10 04:51:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jackthomasltd Hopefully they have trustworthy security.  Those ballots should all be locked up.
1325902258349899776 2020-11-10 04:45:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump We know you won.  We saw it ourselves on Election night and we saw the ballot dumps at 4 AM
1325901825325723649 2020-11-10 04:43:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Twitter continues to break election laws and Censor our President.   Where is Bill Barr.   Close Twitter down!!!  Close it down!!!
1325901431954534400 2020-11-10 04:41:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Don't listen to the Corrupt Media or Politicians.   President Trump won the election.    Listen to the President and to the White House.   Turn off Fox News
1325746326462607360 2020-11-09 18:25:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ArmyBratt68 @KamalaHarris Pray that God intervenes!  This is going to court.   Massive election Fraud.

1325741649364840450 2020-11-09 18:06:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> If Biden/Harris are allowed to steal this election.  What do you think is likely to happen if Democrats take power and  push through their radical Socialist agenda?
1325733510112444422 2020-11-09 17:34:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @donaldrusso994 @realDonaldTrump Yes, keep retweeting our President.   Do not listen to the Media, they are lying to you again!  Listen to our President and listen to the White House.
1325729145553219589 2020-11-09 17:17:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump It's not difficult to print up ballots with the candidate already selected.   Rich Democrats have access to expensive printers probably in their homes.    They manufactured 10s of thousands of additional ILLEGAL ballots.   This was well planned.
1325727287627505665 2020-11-09 17:09:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump The same thing happened in Michigan at 4 AM
1325726072965492737 2020-11-09 17:05:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You WON!  They stopped counting when you were ahead so they could bring in the boxes of additional illegal, counterfeit, duplicate ballots for Biden.  They planned this and the Media is complicit in the fraud.   We will NEVER unite around a Biden/Harris coup.  RESIST
1325723753045581825 2020-11-09 16:55:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Donald J. Trump won the election on 11/3/2020  The Media working with Criminal Democrat Politicians stopped counting the votes win they saw Trump was winning and they brought in the illegal boxes of illegal, counterfeit, duplicate ballots all for Biden in early AM.

1325715677202673664 2020-11-09 16:23:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @OzymandiasX225 @momfelix58 @marklevinshow There is a mass exodus of people leaving Twitter to sign up for Parler due to the non stop Censoring and suspending on Twitter.   Be patient, Parler does not have as many servers yet so it's slower than Twitter.  They are working on improving it.
1325613265657896963 2020-11-09 09:36:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @momfelix58 @marklevinshow Lots of people leaving twitter and parler doesn't have same capacity.  Probably need to add more servers.  People leaving Twitter daily due to censoring.

The Socialist, Marxist left committed massive voter fraud in several states with massive paper mail in voting ballots.   They broke federal election laws  President Trump won.  They cheated.

Election Fraud

Election Fraud rampant before our eyes in several states and votes must be recounted.    This country could be headed to a civil war
1325532420385382400 2020-11-09 04:15:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Americans will not allow the Media to bully us into accepting FRAUD.   Do not concede.  Litigate this.   Do not listen to the liars/bullies who are trying to steal this election.

1325385226407747584 2020-11-08 18:30:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> Yep, that's how frogman Bret Baier talks alright.
1325384800841027585 2020-11-08 18:28:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 I accidentally turned Fox News on today and after I turned it back off, it was too late and I had to open up all the doors and windows to get some fresh air.  🤢🤢🤢
1325382687717171200 2020-11-08 18:20:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah After Chris Wallace showed his his hatred and bias and debated the President instead of moderating the debate Fox News then started putting him on almost every hour on their network.  Fox news is a FAR LEFT network now.  We stopped watching.
1325377250103996416 2020-11-08 17:58:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MichaelCoudrey It's another tool the Democrats used to conduct election fraud in PA, GA, Wi and Arizona using a software counter and they say their was a "gliche" that gave several thousand votes to Biden that belonged to Trump.  Instead of admitting they cheated they said it was a "gliche"
1325372582300823552 2020-11-08 17:40:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Woke2008 I'm not turning Fox News on any more.   They make me sick to my stomach.  I can't stand it any more.  We are done with them.
1325372103101571072 2020-11-08 17:38:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump I think he should write up an executive order and take away their section 230 protection.  They will take it to court but in the meantime it would shut them down from censoring us for a while.
1325369009605275648 2020-11-08 17:26:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> Not a single Republican poll watcher was allowed to observe the counting of ballots in PA @foxnews and Media joins in on the fraud by declaring Biden a winner.
1325361308028432384 2020-11-08 16:55:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> We will NOT accept the outcome of a Fraudulent election @FoxNews
1325360875251748866 2020-11-08 16:53:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> Boxes contained ballots that had similar pen and similar handwriting
1325359509741531136 2020-11-08 16:48:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews  Hey Fox news, here is more evidence.  law suits are coming and media does not decide who the President is.
1325358110945337345 2020-11-08 16:42:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Church_Militant @RudyGiuliani This is the worse outright election fraud.  Huge election fraud.  They broke federal laws one after another.    President Trump won this election.
1325355670326050818 2020-11-08 16:33:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> Did you hear that @foxnews  dishonest news.   There is no President elect.  The election is being contested. Media does not decide who the President is.
1325355290066251778 2020-11-08 16:31:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO @Church_Militant Joe Biden is a fake Catholic.  He is a heretic and he goes against the teachings of the Catholic Faith.  Abortion is murder.

1325341983947194368 2020-11-08 15:38:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte So are their ballots disqualified?  Do they recall that election and do a new one the honest way with no mail in ballots and observers watching?

Now the Democrats have moved their illegal, fraudulent method nationwide.  Their mistake is now everyone is watching and on to them.    Recounts must be mandatory and illegal votes tossed.
1325245060795883522 2020-11-08 09:13:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EricTrump When will they be inspecting and recounting??
1325242737067651072 2020-11-08 09:04:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @toddstarnes Pennsylvania has to have a new election.  No mail in ballots and must be monitored.   Pennsylvania government officials must be arrested for defying the Supreme Court.  Where is Bill Barr?  FBI?
1325241641381187584 2020-11-08 09:00:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Media wants to keep telling the lie over and over again that Biden won.  They believe if they keep telling the lie over and over again you will believe it.  President Trump won the election.  After the election they began their coup. Duplicate, counterfeit ballots   Trump won
1325240894560202752 2020-11-08 08:57:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won on election night 11/3/2020.  Don't listen to the MEDIA  They are lying to you!   This was a coup and it's going to court.
1325233862356598785 2020-11-08 08:29:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, Twitter is blatantly censoring you and all of your supporters and attaching fake news articles to the tweets.  This clearly makes Twitter a Publisher not a platform.  Please sign an executive order today to stop them.
1325230835184775169 2020-11-08 08:17:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Irishrainy They are bad.
1325229760805392384 2020-11-08 08:12:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Project_Veritas I was saying this six months ago.  They printed 100s of thousands or more additional counterfeit ballots.   It is not difficult to do.  Rich Democrats and people working for George Soros have expensive printers and know how to print.
1325226550585774080 2020-11-08 08:00:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RyanAFournier @toby_dorena @realDonaldTrump The media is trying to make the coup legitimate.  We know they cheated big time.   Count only legal votes.
1325221080521302016 2020-11-08 07:38:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews    Biden was NOT elected President.   You are a communist network.
1325219790357626880 2020-11-08 07:33:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @100Trump45 He already proved to us he does what he says.  I know President Trump will get a lot done these next 4 years.  I am so excited.   Celebrating!!
1325218866541162497 2020-11-08 07:29:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> Doing multi texting to family and friends.  Everyone needs to text their family and friends and not rely on just social media.  Get the word out that President Trump won and the fraudulent votes will be tossed.   They cheated.     text and email people.
1325218563058098176 2020-11-08 07:28:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   During your 2nd Term please enforce all election laws so this never happens again.   So thankful you won!
1325218303069990912 2020-11-08 07:27:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> First thing President Trump should do 1st day of his second term is repeal section 230.
1325217686331088896 2020-11-08 07:24:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won the election.     Don't listen to the Media.   Media does not certify who won.   Recount every legal vote and toss out every illegal, fraudulent, counterfeit ballot.
1325216936108589056 2020-11-08 07:21:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Americans will not accept a communist socialist Government.

1325194583580368897 2020-11-08 05:53:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @marklevinshow @luv18wheels We need to find some attorneys and bring forth a class action lawsuit against AOC.   She cannot be legally immune from threatening us just because she is in congress.
1325193296906350593 2020-11-08 05:47:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lrihendry @AndyEinstman The MEDIA does not decide who won.  Don't listen to the Media.  Listen to President Trump.    Major election fraud was planned months in advance.   This is a coup
1325186476385005575 2020-11-08 05:20:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Acosta That's why we have recounts and inspections.   We already have evidence of massive voter Fraud and this coup will be exposed soon.   Election Fraud.

1325174012016668674 2020-11-08 04:31:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> Turn off Fox News.  Don't listen to the Media.  Listen to our President.   Listen to our President.

1325173481340719104 2020-11-08 04:29:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> They cheated.     Don't listen to the media.  Ignore the vote tallies they are showing on their maps.   There is ample evidence of Fraud in all 6 states who stopped counting on election night.

1325165763141857283 2020-11-08 03:58:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> The Media does NOT decide who wins the election.  The electoral college first meets to vote. The states have to certify who won.  No certification will take place until the courts make their decision on the fraud.  Don't listen to the Media.  Don't watch Fox news.
1325163516190318592 2020-11-08 03:49:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> It is we the people against the communist media and communist politicians.  Don't listen to the media.   Listen to the President.   Massive cheating, machines tallying Trump votes for Biden, not allowing observers, duplicate, counterfeit ballots dropped of early in the morning.

1324992969397579779 2020-11-07 16:31:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BretBaier  There is hard evidence of election fraud everywhere throughout the united states.  Yes  EVIDENCE.   Stop lying to your viewers.  @foxnews you are now classified as FAKE news.

1324984263578587136 2020-11-07 15:57:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden The illegal votes will be tossed out and the software that gave you President Trumps votes will be reversed.

1324918989164670976 2020-11-07 11:37:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> The liars, cheaters on the left are using Covid as an excuse for their actions at illegally refusing to allow poll watchers during the counting of the votes.  If you allow them to steal this election they will lockdown the country, defund police and take away your 2nd amendment
1324915823668948992 2020-11-07 11:25:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> Bags and boxes 1000s of ballots being dropped off at 2 to   4AM  in GA, PA, MI, AZ and Nevada at the last   minute and they all happen to be 100% for Joe Biden.   They didn't even try to make it look realistic.

1324807253606559744 2020-11-07 04:13:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump The Socialist Left stopped counting votes on election night because you won and they had to go print more ballots for Joe Biden  That's what happened.    Take this all the way to the US Supreme court and recount and inspect every single ballot.
1324801665992589312 2020-11-07 03:51:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please don't listen to the liberal Pundits speaking their (opinions) on Fox News or any other network.   We have evidence across the country of massive election Fraud.  The Democrats worked with foreign entities to cheat and steal this election.    RECOUNT  Take it to court
1324800573594480640 2020-11-07 03:47:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> Mail in voting is  FRAUD
1324799984819085312 2020-11-07 03:45:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal We  need a list of the wobbly, cowardly Republicans who are not fighting back so we can be sure to vote them out of office when their term is up
1324799788630470656 2020-11-07 03:44:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> We are not going to let them steal this election with their massive Election Fraud.   We fight this tooth and nail all the way to the US Supreme Court and we recount every ballot and we cancel every illegal ballot  In America you don't get to be President by Cheating.
1324799306818375681 2020-11-07 03:42:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Likeshesays @PedroGo34406894 @SparkyDamian @dlbetz They don't want it to work that way.  They cheated.  They refused to allow poll watchers.   That means their votes dumped off at 4 AM all for Biden get cancelled.  That's the law and that's how it works.
1324798771587387394 2020-11-07 03:40:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal Major Election Fraud in all 6 of those states.
1324795436931014656 2020-11-07 03:27:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore RECOUNTS.
1324794474958970880 2020-11-07 03:23:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HKrassenstein It's fraud and so are the counterfeit ballots
1324794208402644992 2020-11-07 03:22:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore NO.  They cheated big time
1324794143705616394 2020-11-07 03:21:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal The election is not over!
1324668565140566017 2020-11-06 19:02:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lsferguson Notice how these huge amount of votes come in for Biden between 2:30 to 4:00 am when everyone is sleeping
1324666464951939079 2020-11-06 18:54:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JFKjrQ @WinningWwg1wga Oh my gosh!!  Disgusting network
1324666133652279296 2020-11-06 18:53:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonnaCar62 No way did Biden win Georgia.  They are cheating every night at 4am
1324664193451085824 2020-11-06 18:45:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Time4JusticeUSA @sirhottest Yep.  Like I said, nobody is watching these ballots getting counted and its happening when everyone's sleeping.
1324662547912425473 2020-11-06 18:38:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sirhottest The Democrats are cheating like hell.  They said they will do anything to stop President Trump from being President.  They will do this with every remaining state. Nobody is watching them.
1324661334554808321 2020-11-06 18:34:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr No way did the people of Georgia elect Joe Biden and why is it taking them days to count the remaining 10% and all of them coming in for Biden.  LOL This is why we have to do a recount and count only the legal votes.
1324660633963393024 2020-11-06 18:31:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq I don't believe the people of Georgia voted for Biden. That's why we are doing a recount to count the LEGAL votes.   This is election Fraud.  Plain and simple.
1324658468012261377 2020-11-06 18:22:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1776Stonewall They are printing ballots in the wee hours of the morning.
1324658146330120192 2020-11-06 18:21:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TocRadio Nope.  recounting all of them and also Arizona will be taken away from Joe.  They gave it to him prematurely.
1324656867285463040 2020-11-06 18:16:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte We won't let him steal it.   GA is automatic recount.  They will all be recounted.  This is Fraud
1324649604873289730 2020-11-06 17:47:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @piersmorgan This is not big news.  We know they cheated and its now a tie and there will be a recount.  We already know this.   You must be desperate for attention.
1324648380648189952 2020-11-06 17:42:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah Evidence is everywhere regarding voter fraud.  @foxnews is right up there with Fake News CNN.  I've been telling my friends and family for years now to stop watching Fox news.  Finally they are listening to me.
1324647696431394817 2020-11-06 17:39:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @fooschamp95 @DitchettsDevon They stopped counting because Trump was winning and they needed to go print more counterfeit votes.
1324646778713436161 2020-11-06 17:36:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton Of course!  They printed more ballots for Joe.
1324646336617091074 2020-11-06 17:34:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SparkyDamian @dlbetz @Likeshesays President Trump won the election already on November 3rd, 2020.
1324645184043438080 2020-11-06 17:29:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @fantasticlegs @realDonaldTrump The Democrats have been manufacturing votes in California for years.  That's how they won in republican stronghold districts of the state.   Now they are spreading their cheating technique Nation wide but they forgot that everyone would be analyzing their fraud.
1324644367357730817 2020-11-06 17:26:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BNONews They cheated.   Recount on its way.
1324643597107437568 2020-11-06 17:23:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RocktheJJs All legal votes.    Not illegal votes.
1324643331897499649 2020-11-06 17:22:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Therese38538165 @ChuckCallesto I hope that is true.  I really do.   Not sure though because each state is different.
1324643208538648578 2020-11-06 17:22:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sie2sienna That's why we can't stop fighting.  We can't let them get away with this.
1324636510998593538 2020-11-06 16:55:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ToddKrieger1 @KalaDeeDee @realDonaldTrump Trump won Tuesday night.  We are just fighting another coup! It's not difficult for rich Democrats to buy expensive printers and print massive amounts of voter ballots.  They are printing hundreds of 1000s of them and dumping them off  at the voting centers in boxes.  All Planned
1324632967168184320 2020-11-06 16:41:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ThatIsNotMyD0G @TeamTrump @FoxNews @arnonmishkin @AP Can we tell their advertisers we will boycott them if they advertise on Fox News?  We need to start fighting back against Fox news.
1324630664268840960 2020-11-06 16:32:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews @FoxNewsSunday   Sue Fox News for refusing to retract.  This was done purposely because they are bias against President Trump.
1324629588526288896 2020-11-06 16:27:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @carriesheffield @TeamTrump Yet even after a Judge ruled and ordered PA to allow observers the PA election officials break Federal law and defy the Judge.  @realDonaldTrump   Our Dept of Justice needs to move in and arrest the election officials in Florida who are cheating and defying Federal Law.
1324628569394352128 2020-11-06 16:23:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @FoxNews @arnonmishkin @AP Why can't these networks be sued for not dropping their false calls?  Fox news should be sued.
1324627321043607552 2020-11-06 16:18:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @mschlapp Why are we paying Federal taxes when this cheating is aloud to go on across the United States and these states breaking laws not letting poll watchers/inspectors come in.  Where is Bill Barr?  DOJ?   So with that said do we stop paying our taxes?
1324623962857381889 2020-11-06 16:05:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Americans need to sue big tech for this.  Regardless of Section 230 they can be sued.
1324623531129278464 2020-11-06 16:03:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews still has not changed their election map and has Arizona for Biden in blue on their map.   Fox news is the network that inappropriately gave Arizona to Biden.  Fox news is TRASH
1324622291456552964 2020-11-06 15:58:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @PamBondi Democrats are illegally bringing in boxes and boxes containing hundreds of thousands of ballots for Biden that they printed on their computers after the election Tuesday night.   Democrats won't let poll watchers come in to inspect the ballots because they are illegal.
1324621297255555072 2020-11-06 15:55:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> Remove all the hundreds of thousands of illegal votes.  We need our people to get in there and inspect the ballots and we need to see election officials in PA arrested for Voter Fraud.
1324619846206648320 2020-11-06 15:49:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter is interfering in our elections by censoring everyone.
1324619545101824000 2020-11-06 15:48:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @RepDougCollins Toss out all those illegal votes and arrest election officials are committed this Fraud on the American people.
1324619360481103873 2020-11-06 15:47:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Toss out the hundreds of thousands of illegal, counterfeit votes.  Boxes of them that they sneak in at 2 or 4 in the morning.  Those sneaky bas^ards!
1324618991663419393 2020-11-06 15:45:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Well said!   I'm keeping my eyes out for our GOP leaders who are weak and hiding under their desks.  We won't allow coward GOP leaders to let Socialists steal our election and commit voter Fraud.
1324618591971340290 2020-11-06 15:44:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TeamTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Right on.  Democrats can go straight to the Devil if they think they are going to cheat and we are going to just give them our country.   We need to prosecute them.
1324611929470509059 2020-11-06 15:17:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @debjnich @DaveMit75010125 I think you're right.
1324591640300777473 2020-11-06 13:57:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> Trump won his re election on Tuesday November 3rd and six states stopped counting when he won.  Now tomorrow will be November 6 and they are still counting and adding new ballots and 95% are in Bidens favor.   This is not an election it's an illegal coup.
1324590787980533760 2020-11-06 13:53:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yourrant @kgully1980 Why are we all paying taxes???

1324586358829064193 2020-11-06 13:36:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden You stopped 6 states from counting the votes on election night because President Trump was winning and you needed to stop counting so you could print additional ballots.   It's called election fraud.
1324586028795981824 2020-11-06 13:34:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden Your faith is in the Devil.  You evil man.   My faith is in God
1324585717670969346 2020-11-06 13:33:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec For what?  What's going to happen?   I want to see election officials in PA arrested for breaking federal law.  Military needs to go in their and shut Pennsylvania down for Voter Fraud.
1324584445383356417 2020-11-06 13:28:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JamesDoss50 Why should we pay taxes for a Government that was put in place by voter Fraud?
1324583936387764227 2020-11-06 13:26:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @4usa564 @RandyWr16505387 They won't get away with it ever.  We will never accept this.
1324583797539565568 2020-11-06 13:26:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won on Tuesday night.   States can't stop counting ballots just because he was winning.   That's now how it works.  That's cheating.
1324583462196576257 2020-11-06 13:24:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Donald J. Trump was re elected on November 3rd, 2020.  Democrats and the deep state are at it again trying to erase the results of an election.
1324582665731809280 2020-11-06 13:21:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @I_am_MrRick @RandyWr16505387 Rich Democrats have the resources to have expensive printers in their homes.  They are printing ballots by the 100s of 1000s.  The reason they stopped counting the votes on election night in 6 states is because Trump was winning and they needed to print additional ballots
1324581275139629056 2020-11-06 13:16:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HillaryClinton You cheaters.   Only LEGAL votes get to be counted.
1324581110366441472 2020-11-06 13:15:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rhondam04225028 @HillaryClinton Wrong Hillary Clinton,  We count every LEGAL ballot.  Not boxes of Ballets that arrive at 4am all for Joe Biden printed from your expensive printers paid for by George Soros.   Only Legal Ballots get counted
1324580096242405377 2020-11-06 13:11:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Sassychickie @EvanAKilgore Trust God and pray that when the Civil war comes we win.
1324571583835336704 2020-11-06 12:37:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We should definitely recall all the states where the Democrats stopped counting on election night.  They stopped so they could print more votes for Joe Biden.    Its that simple.
1324567166331416577 2020-11-06 12:19:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BreitbartNews  You need to update your Election Map and turn Arizona Red.   President trump at 225
1324565398847594496 2020-11-06 12:12:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MMLynch01 @BreitbartNews Actually having enmity for wicked people is not evil and it is not a sin.  It is a natural inclination.
1324547484916486147 2020-11-06 11:01:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto Because Trump won.  He wins then they pause so they can go print more ballots.   This is unbelievable.  What is our DOJ Bill Barr doing?   PA also broke federal law by refusing poll watchers to observe 136,000 votes.  Those votes are now illegal and must be tossed out.
1324546837722787840 2020-11-06 10:59:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Bill Barr needs to start making some arrest in PA.  They are breaking Federal election laws non stop.   What is Mr. Barr doing?
1324544981306990592 2020-11-06 10:51:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> Pennsylvania counted 136,000 votes illegally not allowing poll watchers to observe those ballots.     The law requires those 136,000 votes to be subtracted from tallies.  They are illegal votes.
1324544169675681795 2020-11-06 10:48:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BreitbartNews    You need to update your Election May and turn Arizona Red.   President trump at 225  https://t.co/PPiZKTgiae
1324538693768503298 2020-11-06 10:26:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity @FoxNews Why do you still have Arizona marked blue for Biden when you know fully well and just announced Trump won Arizona?  https://t.co/wi5iMSqDcv
1324538266050162688 2020-11-06 10:25:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity  You announced Trump is ahead in Arizona now yet @foxnews your liberal, dishonest producers called Arizona for Biden prematurely and they still have it  marked blue on your map! Fox news needs to correct this and apologize and someone should be fired.
1324530526959460353 2020-11-06 09:54:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore YES
1324529863588413441 2020-11-06 09:51:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Just4RealGirls @seanhannity @fox It's hard to watch Tuker, Laura and Mark when the ticker tape on the bottom of the screen still gives false election results.
1324519772805947392 2020-11-06 09:11:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EthicalHackerXs @Amberfiremusic I believe the Military will need to arrest Governor Whitmer for this.

1324509846306123777 2020-11-06 08:32:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle More accurate and honest calls.   Keep in mind Trump is still leading in most the states that are still "counting".  At this point the question is what are they counting.  https://t.co/fUCoZsqZfu
1324509286475591680 2020-11-06 08:29:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> Honest election results below.  President Trump is now ahead in most other states "still counting"  https://t.co/ijjsaYkDW4

1324504492826480640 2020-11-06 08:10:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Project_Veritas Why not beak the story now?  If you have the information the longer you wait to release it the worse things get.
1324503135067361280 2020-11-06 08:05:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork I'm do glad President Trump did not answer questions from those dishonest reporters.  Bravo!
1324496424759783424 2020-11-06 07:38:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork President should just speak from the oval office without reporters.  I hope he ignores their questions.
1324493495520780288 2020-11-06 07:27:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NickAdamsinUSA @RandyKAdams1 We definitely will not accept the outcome of a coup

1324484262964293632 2020-11-06 06:50:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Razorsmack1 I only watch Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham.   I'm sure soon they will leave or be forced out of Fox News and then I won't watch anything on that network.
1324483883954442240 2020-11-06 06:49:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @staceychilders6 @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @Mike_Pence Please show me the tweets where he endorsed our President before the election.  I see nothing.
1324483672364392448 2020-11-06 06:48:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kaylow77 Wealthy Democrats and those funded by George Soros have been busy printing counterfeit ballots.   This is the reason the Media stopped calling the states for President Trump on election night.  They needed to know how many ballots to print to steal the election.
1324481020855382017 2020-11-06 06:37:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump US Supreme Court needs to issue a Stay.  President Trump won on election night.
1324480684111454209 2020-11-06 06:36:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BrandonStraka unbelievable what Twitter is doing.
1324479975966138370 2020-11-06 06:33:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @charliekirk11 @CherylVoss2 Why hasn't the US Supreme court issued a Stay?
1324474805182058496 2020-11-06 06:12:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle @trumpgirl290 US Supreme court needs to issue a STAY to stop the cheating.

1324471320709509121 2020-11-06 05:59:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CBS_Herridge @Magician1958 @MajorCBS of course Bidens legal team would say they are not cheating.  Cheaters are not honest.
1324469734843195394 2020-11-06 05:52:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP @Mike_Pence You refused to endorse the President before the election because you were afraid of losing your tax exempt status.  You should have endorsed him before the election.
1324465978227400704 2020-11-06 05:37:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tedcruz Then we have a right to RECALL that states election and start over without the Post Office getting involved.
1324465650677501953 2020-11-06 05:36:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 @RubyLaw16 It won't
1324465012056887296 2020-11-06 05:34:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> We will not accept the outcome of a fraudulent election.

1324460629176979457 2020-11-06 05:16:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump We need to recall those elections and start over without getting the Post office involved.
1324458833163382784 2020-11-06 05:09:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump I think we need to do recall elections in all those states where they stopped counting on Tuesday night.  No mail in ballots.   Redo the elections.  Recall the elections there.
1324458614443057153 2020-11-06 05:08:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GOPLeader @moulton_anne What is AG Bill Barr doing?
1324456769301573633 2020-11-06 05:01:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Republicans need to do more and where is our DOJ?  Where is Bill Barr?
1324455019375026178 2020-11-06 04:54:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EricTrump We need to redo the elections in these states.   have another election
1324453941988347904 2020-11-06 04:50:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Project_Veritas Just do it.
1324453548638138368 2020-11-06 04:48:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO It would have been nice if you had done that before the election.
1324330245520912385 2020-11-05 20:38:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @alvigib @CindyHall13 @realDonaldTrump That's what President Trump said.  He was right.

1324329073691095041 2020-11-05 20:33:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KingBee0102 Lets hope she's as good as we think.  Judge Roberts was suppose to be really good when he was appointed and he cowered and votes with the Liberals now.  I hope Judge Barrett does not change.
1324325400852357123 2020-11-05 20:19:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KingBee0102 So 2% not reported.  I'm wondering what the tally is for the two of them reported.  Will 2% change anything?  Why haven't they called it?
1324324084268724224 2020-11-05 20:14:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KingBee0102 Thank you for telling me.  That is really good to hear.  Even though he's really probably ahead 10 points.   Lets hope and pray he stays at that lead.  Perhaps Michigan is backing off on their cheating because they know they have been caught.
1324320590996516864 2020-11-05 20:00:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IvanTheNuc @reubing @realDonaldTrump That is what they are doing.They are printing counterfeit ballots but more than 100,000. They are doing it in every state. Rich Liberal Democrats have printers that can do this. It's not difficult. Democrats abort babies at 9 months, They don't care about breaking election laws

If we cannot recount the ballots and get rid of the counterfeit ballots then we need to have a brand new election (with ID) in those states.  We can't let them force tainted ballots on us.
1324304189086855168 2020-11-05 18:54:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @McKGraKucPauNad 🙂
1324303418169589760 2020-11-05 18:51:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @_Steve_777 Yes he was.  President Trump won on November 3rd.
1324303171464777731 2020-11-05 18:50:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DixT3 I'm sure their Corrupt Tyrant Governor in Michigan is involved in this massive voter fraud.   Thank you for sharing the Veritas link.  Unbelievable!
1324302627669078016 2020-11-05 18:48:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryISDDALLAS We need voter ID.
1324301856143675394 2020-11-05 18:45:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cupcake4120 Precisely!  You are correct.  The Media stopped calling it and we were told they STOPPED counting.  They did stop counting but somewhere between 2 and 4 in the morning 300,000 ballots were added within one or two hours in Bidens favor creating a tie.  They think were stupid.
1324298483491196928 2020-11-05 18:32:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @domedog311 It is too easy to cheat so they do it.  No voter ID laws.  The Left abort babies all the way to birth so they have no problem cheating in an election.
1324297709990236161 2020-11-05 18:29:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kenn_guilstorf We definitely need to check signatures on ballots and they need to inspect those ballots to see if they are real or counterfeit.  Toss out the counterfeit Biden ballots.  Boxes of 10s of 1000s of Biden ballots delivered and they are all for Biden only........     INSPECT
1324296844894089217 2020-11-05 18:25:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @155thMed Good point!  Thank you!
1324296549728333824 2020-11-05 18:24:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BrusjeHvar Amen!  We must keep the faith.  God works in mysterious ways.  Keep praying for President Trump and for our Country.  God help us!
1324295886642442242 2020-11-05 18:21:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gracehills1989 I'm so glad you also saw that.   I also did not sleep after seeing it happen.  Lets all keep praying for our country and for our wonderful hard working President.
1324295383569244160 2020-11-05 18:19:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Greekgal44 Yes, the ballots need to be inspected.  They need to toss out Democrats counterfeit ballots.
1324294637666791424 2020-11-05 18:17:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1BDSMOFO I knew this would happen.  I knew they would massively counterfeit ballots.  Wealthy Democrats can afford expensive printers in their homes that will print ballots.  It's not difficult.  They don't care about breaking federal laws.  They are doing it.
1324291065986252802 2020-11-05 18:02:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jdtipton31 @realDonaldTrump Expose the election fraud and prosecute to the fullest extend of the law.
1324287665290670083 2020-11-05 17:49:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BruceKe37219059 Yes, I remember.  They cheated in OC a strong majority Republican strong hold.  Democrats cheated in California with counterfeit ballots and they are now doing it across the country.  That's what we are seeing today.  The same type of ballot cheating started in California.
1324286022507667466 2020-11-05 17:42:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @4usa564 Thank you for that information.
1324284362511151107 2020-11-05 17:36:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @willy64853469 And they need to find and throw out the counterfeit ballots.

1324186839566090240 2020-11-05 11:08:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lcpinco Yes, it has to be redone and the ballots need to be checked for forgeries, counterfeits.    We can't let them cheat.
1324172398392832000 2020-11-05 10:11:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @reubing @rose33090 This is what they have been doing in California for several years.  The Democrats cheat and Stupid Republicans allow it to continue.
1324171674564976640 2020-11-05 10:08:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> Trump clearly won Michigan and Wisconsin.  I saw with my own eyes the cheating.   At 2AM President Trump was up 300,000 in Michigan .  Two hours later at 4AM that 300,000 lead just disappeared.  Recount every single ballot and inspect every ballot.  They cheated @realDonaldTrump
1324140101434134528 2020-11-05 08:02:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @upcyclealleykat @mikeandersonsr They are cheating everywhere.  I wish Republicans would do more about this.

1324138141280694273 2020-11-05 07:55:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Franklin_Graham @BillyGraham As a Christian and especially a leader you need to speak the truth about the evil occurring in our country and not withhold truth because you are worried about your tax exempt status.    I am very disappointed in you.  You act like your running  a business.   Very sad.
1324134914501963776 2020-11-05 07:42:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Do we have a backup plan?
1324131972726185984 2020-11-05 07:30:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DLoesch @JWright756 Because they are cheating.  They don't want to get caught.
1324126449951928321 2020-11-05 07:08:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton @Matthew_4_Trump It was 300,000 Trump was up.  I looked at 2am and he was up and then two hours later his 300,000 lead was just gone.
1324112642118545408 2020-11-05 06:13:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews   Fake News Fox News called Michigan for Biden.  Last night at 2am President Trump was up 300,000 votes in Michigan then magically at 4am all 300,000 votes were cancelled.  Where did the 300,000 votes come from at 4am?  Even Fox news said they stopped counting.
1324111092310683648 2020-11-05 06:07:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec Where's the video they said they were releasing?
1324106898639998978 2020-11-05 05:51:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Is anyone else concerned and aware about counterfeit ballots that Democrats can print by the millions?  With all this delay is there a process to inspect these ballots?   They are just going create more ballots for Biden.
1324105782594469889 2020-11-05 05:46:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealRLimbaugh   Did Twitter suspend Rush Limbaugh? Not one tweet from him today.
1324105477253341184 2020-11-05 05:45:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr Every mail in ballot needs to be inspected.   They are printing counterfeit ballots.
1324104865094623233 2020-11-05 05:42:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealCandaceO They are actively deleting our tweets and Censoring the Presidents.
1324104654616080384 2020-11-05 05:42:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealCandaceO And in the meantime what about the counterfeit ballots they've printed?
1324103958437113858 2020-11-05 05:39:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We need other ways to communicate.  They created social distancing to stop us from lawful assembly.  They don't want us to congregate.   Do we even have a plan?  What happened to all those oathkeepers?
1324103337428492289 2020-11-05 05:36:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @molotovmouse Assemble, meet in convention centers, town halls.  We can't rely on Social media.  They are shutting us down
1324102331315572742 2020-11-05 05:32:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> Hey you guys,   Twitter is actively deleting our tweets.   I am not kidding.    Not only censoring but actively deleting tweets.
1324101287453941760 2020-11-05 05:28:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> Are we going to let them cheat?  We know they are printing bogus ballots.   I hope you all realize this.   The numbers last night in several states clearly were a Trump Victory.  PA he was up by 700,000.
1324099912435331073 2020-11-05 05:23:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TomFitton Has anyone answered the question as to WHY they stopped counting last night when President Trump was ahead?  The media would not call states for President Trump when he clearly won.  This is sinister.   Are people just going to tweet and talk about it or take action to stop it?
1324099278613090304 2020-11-05 05:20:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile In the meantime the Democrat Socialist are printing ballots to cancel our Presidents votes.     The longer this takes the more time for them to cheat.    They have been doing this in California for the last 20 years.
1324098313021353985 2020-11-05 05:16:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice Twitter is censoring our President.  Last night and out of control today.   They think Biden won so now they are going full throttle Censorship.   They need to be sued
1324097806215245824 2020-11-05 05:14:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> He thinks Biden won so in his fear he attacks our President.
1324097007514841088 2020-11-05 05:11:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Franklin_Graham God wanted you to speak out and tell your sheep not to vote for evil Democrats but you remained silent.  You were afraid to endorse President Trump and speak out against the evil, Godless left all because of your tax exemption status.   I hope you are happy
1324096497772752897 2020-11-05 05:09:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 They stopped counting last night because they were losing.  They had to stop counting so they could print enough ballots to cancel President Trumps lead.    I will not accept the outcome of a fraudulent, rigged election.   THEY CHEATED.
1324096074374508545 2020-11-05 05:07:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump @TomFitton And what's going to be done about it?  They stole an election right before our very eyes last night.
1324095565462859776 2020-11-05 05:05:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won: Michigan:          Trump 51.7%     Biden 46.7% Pennsylvania     Trump 55.7%     Biden 43.1% North Carolina  Trump 50.1%     Biden 47.7% Georgia             Trump 50.5%     Biden 48.3% Alaska               Trump 61.4%      Biden 34.7% 70 Electoral votes stolen
1324095249753415680 2020-11-05 05:04:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> They don't want us to congregate or assemble because they want us separated.  They are using Covid to divide us and keep us apart.  We need to meet in townhalls, convention centers and get united and figure out what we are going to do to fight communism
1324093878098563072 2020-11-05 04:59:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump While you are still President please bring the law down on Twitter and Facebook.  Do it today
1324093668953743360 2020-11-05 04:58:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump They are finding ONLY Biden votes.    Yes it is sad but what are Americans going to do about it?  Sit and let Marxist steal the election?  The left Kills babies so they have no problem cheating.  Inspect every ballot.  Recount every ballot.
1324092874850365442 2020-11-05 04:55:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump 4 am Michigan subtracted 300,000 votes for Trump.   I looked at 2am and you were up then two hours later at 4am I looked and you lost all those votes.   This is total BS
1324092408389271552 2020-11-05 04:53:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump At 2 AM Michigan had you up by 300,00 votes then at 4 AM They cancelled your  +300,000 votes.  In two hours they found (printed) the votes to cheat and defeat you.   They stopped counting at 10:pm because they were losing.  We need to insist the numbers last night stay the same
1324091867298889729 2020-11-05 04:51:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump He means millions of ballots that they started printing last night.  It's not difficult to create counterfeit ballots when each states is different.  Criminal wealthy Democrats have sophisticated printers in their home and they are printing ballots for Biden.
1323987241006292992 2020-11-04 21:55:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @atensnut In two hours Michigan between 2:00 to 4:00 am canceled 300,000 of President Trumps votes.  Somehow they created additional ballots to help Biden and now its a tie.
1323986481224953860 2020-11-04 21:52:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won last night but because of the rampant cheating he may not take power.   Also because of many of the pastors and Bishops refused to tell their flock not to vote for evil Democrats and because of this an evil party takes control.
1323985833444077568 2020-11-04 21:49:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Franklin_Graham Why didn't you tell people who to vote for?  Anyone who votes for a Democrat is in mortal sin.  Democrat party hates God and they worship abortion.  I hope you enjoy your tax exempt status.  Now abortion will increase because the party of evil is taking over.
1323985042536722432 2020-11-04 21:46:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Franklin_Graham You care more about your tax exemption rather than being bold and telling your flock not to vote for a Democrat.  Because of your timidity and more concern over a tax exemption status you failed to endorse President Trump and now a marxist anti God party is taking over USA
1323981283077152770 2020-11-04 21:31:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LouLouKing8 Michigan was one who stopped then at 4am they found more ballots and now its a tie. Trump was 300,000 ahead until mysteriously they found ballots and in two hours added them
1323974602570096640 2020-11-04 21:05:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KernsNini They stopped counting the votes last night and went to print additional ballots and in the early morning they added them to cancel Trumps ballots.  It's that simple.   They cheated like they said they would.
1323973350515904512 2020-11-04 21:00:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> I posted this two hours ago people.   In less than two hours Michigan somehow obtained additional votes (printed them?) and now its a tie in Michigan.  How?  Trumps 300,000 gain lost in a couple hours.  https://t.co/n4ULtS5xFx
1323972757558800384 2020-11-04 20:57:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CYBERFRIEND I posted this two hours ago and then Michigan is now a tie?   Oh how they are cheating.  They are adding ballots.  They stopped counting last night in order to find ballots  https://t.co/n4ULtRNWNZ
1323972415483904000 2020-11-04 20:56:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Mah_MAGA_Gandhi Just two hours ago I posted this and now biden has gone up to 49.1%.  So they stopped counting last night then early AM they added ballots.  They are cheating @realDonaldTrump   https://t.co/n4ULtS5xFx
1323971835667468289 2020-11-04 20:54:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> 49.1% Two hours ago I obtained and posted the data for Michigan.  Biden at 46.7%.    Now they have Biden at 49.1 and Trump at 49.3.  They are oh so cheating!  Wake up people! Don't let them.  @realDonaldTrump
1323969784275374080 2020-11-04 20:46:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Mah_MAGA_Gandhi @Phyllis94584953 omg,  they are outright cheating.  They did the same thing with Wisconsin.
1323969236012691459 2020-11-04 20:43:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bubblebathgirl At 4AM is when they added them.    They stopped counting when the saw Trump was winning then waited til 4am to finish "counting"
1323967647587790850 2020-11-04 20:37:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Sue1Peach @EversFam @GcMomx5 How many ballots have they printed since they stopped counting the votes last night once the saw the were losing?    Will Secretary of State do anything?
1323967071789576192 2020-11-04 20:35:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mil_ops @MaryFass3 They are cheating.  Right now they are printing ballots to cancel out Trumps ballots.  That's why they stopped voting last night at 65 to 80% reporting.  by the time they "finish" voting the additional ballots will be added to the stack. Thats why elections have deadlines
1323966133771280384 2020-11-04 20:31:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Stephan01348570 What are you celebrating?
1323965745261289473 2020-11-04 20:30:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FiveRights @MaryFass3 Americans are going to sue Twitter regardless of Section 230
1323965521805504517 2020-11-04 20:29:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @robcicero1 @jody_mazzarese Yep,  Communism.  Not socialism.   communism
1323965305127727106 2020-11-04 20:28:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jody_mazzarese I think we picked up a couple seats.  Not enough.  That just goes to show how stupid and morally bankrupt American voters are.
1323964612383961092 2020-11-04 20:25:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr Their children will have no future.  I hope they are happy.
1323963835695312896 2020-11-04 20:22:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @woodfireQ That's a good reason for war but where are the warriors?
1323963755974123523 2020-11-04 20:22:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @woodfireQ But they are doing it.  Wisconsin they stopped counting then at 4AM miraculously Biden was a few thousand ahead after Trump had a large lead.  It took them until 4am and suddenly Biden won.
1323963350657630209 2020-11-04 20:20:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dadgumbug They cheated.  The question is are Americans going to fight back or accept the stealing of their election.  Do Americans want their children to lose their freedom and grow up into communism?
1323962853997518848 2020-11-04 20:18:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PHYS878 American children will group up into a communist world.  Business will be shut down.  The new Green deal is coming.  Tax increases of 55% are coming.   Police will be defunded.  You are no longer safe
1323962238814752769 2020-11-04 20:16:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> Once they print counterfeit ballots for Joe Biden to cancel the Votes for Trump how can that ever be stopped?  Once it's done is there even a way to go through the thousands of ballots and find out if they are legitimate?  Probably not.  Looks like our election was stolen.
1323961737981304832 2020-11-04 20:14:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> They are printing ballots.   After reporting 65 to 80% of the counting they realized Trump was winning so they stopped counting so they could go fetch and print additional ballots to cancel Trumps for a Biden win.
1323954016510902273 2020-11-04 19:43:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KDemurchyan @KernsNini @m1dn7ghtrider They were handing out sharpies to senior citizens who came to vote.
1323953425285984257 2020-11-04 19:41:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Kimball1Kelly @mitchellreports They stopped counting when they saw President Trump was winning.  The % of counted votes were high and there was no way Biden could win. @mitchellreports  Media does not call the winners either.   President Trump won!
1323953019248025600 2020-11-04 19:39:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mitchellreports You people in the Fake Media don't determine who wins.  You call it for someone.  President Trump called it for himself because of the facts and the numbers.  He won several states that you refused to call and stopped counting. Enough of your lies and cheating.
1323950781473546241 2020-11-04 19:30:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 We are headed into Communism (Not Socialism).  This is a takeover of our Government.  Never do we stop an election just because the President is winning.  Americans need to fight.  We need to get our military to stand up for us. Defend out constitution.  They took an oath
1323949783547957248 2020-11-04 19:26:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> Can we trust our US Supreme court to implement Justice and stop these states from electoral votes. They just stopped the election when our President was winning. Is this America? What if these Justices vote in a tyrannical way?  Does the military step in to defend constituion?
1323948863732867072 2020-11-04 19:23:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @robcicero1 @AndersonMari7 It is certainly very dark times.
1323948611730767875 2020-11-04 19:22:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> It is so hard watching our country crumble at the hands of Marxist who are stealing an actual election.  A sick feeling in my stomach watching this.  Electoral votes stolen from our President. Our President should just call in the Military and put a stop to this.    So sad
1323944742191730688 2020-11-04 19:06:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KernsNini @AndersonMari7 Time for the United States Military to get involved.  Communist are stealing our election.  God knows how many fake ballots they are printing right now.  I've been telling people for years this is how they've been cheating in California.  Nobody listens.
1323943378560581632 2020-11-04 19:01:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lklfaith We all have to fight this.  Not just President Trump.  The American people cannot allow them to steal our election and force us into communism.
1323943058543505409 2020-11-04 18:59:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AndersonMari7 This is something that can warrant a Civil War.   It is very serious.
1323941006199283713 2020-11-04 18:51:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton It was literally stolen
1323935564463157248 2020-11-04 18:30:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Dave6971 @MaryWarrick18 Yes, I forgot to add the 10 electoral votes to Wisconsin.   President was way ahead and Wisconsin stopped their voting but at 4am they sneaked in additional ballots they found somewhere to cancel Trumps.  So 80 electoral votes stolen
1323934992389398528 2020-11-04 18:27:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SimplyTanyas They stole another 10 from Wisconsin.  At 4am Wisconsin added enough votes to cancel president Trumps and put Biden slightly on top.  Those 10 I forgot to add to the list
1323934577975439361 2020-11-04 18:26:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bodacious2012 @islander4716 This will cause a Civil War.  State Governments cannot steal an election when the candidate they are cheating for is a communist and wants to destroy our country.
1323933881892925442 2020-11-04 18:23:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stephaniebynum @bennyjohnson @TuckerCarlson Fox news is out of my home.  I only turned it on for a while tonight when i could not figure out whey the counting stopped in the states President was winning in.  Counting never stopped in states Biden was ahead in.
1323933500894978048 2020-11-04 18:21:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @islander4716 Fox news was criticizing President Trump all night.  All the pundits.  Fox news is TRASH.   @FOXNEWS   Trash news
1323933215376072705 2020-11-04 18:20:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please add the other 10 electoral votes that were stolen In Wisconsin.  President Trump was way ahead and they stopped counting then at 4AM they came up with just enough ballots they found to cancel the Presidents.    https://t.co/n4ULtS5xFx
1323932427979354112 2020-11-04 18:17:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tracied51 @RonCentrelloJr Are those the ballots they found to cancel President Trumps votes?   President Trump was way ahead so they stopped voting, found more ballots in their attics and trash cans.   The ones they printed and hid for tonight.
1323932030191632385 2020-11-04 18:16:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bfie56 I forgot to add President Trump won at the top so deleted and reposted.   No edit on twitter
1323931760095186945 2020-11-04 18:15:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stephaniebynum They stopped counting when they saw they were losing the election.
1323931516095717377 2020-11-04 18:14:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stephaniebynum No, its not over but while we are all sleeping and working within the next 8 hours how hard is it for the Marxist Criminal Democrats to create fake ballots to come up with more votes to cancel President Trumps?  Not hard at all.  They just print them. We are not a communist USA
1323931015560097793 2020-11-04 18:12:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah Fox news can go straight to the Devil.
1323930816188014593 2020-11-04 18:11:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bfie56 Which post?  This one?  https://t.co/n4ULtS5xFx
1323928476458520576 2020-11-04 18:02:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bfie56 They just now came up with additional votes for Wisconsin to give Biden a small lead.  It took them til 4AM to find enough counterfeit votes to cancel President Trumps win.
1323928049914507266 2020-11-04 18:00:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> When did it start taking a little state so long to tally all their votes.   It took til 4AM to come up with more votes to beat President Trump?   I smell Fraud
1323927689242189825 2020-11-04 17:58:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why would it take them so long to count the Wisconsin votes.  Trump was ahead and its 4AM eastern time in Wisconsin.  Did it take them til 4AM to cheat and create more votes to beat Trump?
1323926352672612358 2020-11-04 17:53:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump won: Michigan:          Trump 51.7%.   Biden 46.7% Pennsylvania     Trump 55.7%    Biden 43.1% North Carolina  Trump 50.1%    Biden 47.7% Georgia             Trump 50.5%    Biden 48.3% Alaska               Trump 61.4%    Biden 34.7% 70 Electoral votes stolen
1323915464792141824 2020-11-04 17:10:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DudzikPatty @ACTBrigitte He won.  President Trump won tonight.   They refused to finish the remaining few votes because he was winning.  They are going to cheat
1323913907140882434 2020-11-04 17:04:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tahntahn76 @RonCentrelloJr Tonight after President spoke the Pundits, on Fox news criticized our President.   Fox news is crap
1323910281223786497 2020-11-04 16:49:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DiamondandSilk President Trump won!  They stopped counting when they knew he was winning.   That's what this is all about.  Right now they are creating counterfeit, duplicate ballots to cancel our votes.
1323909556729122819 2020-11-04 16:46:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump After President spoke about the fraud tonight  Fox news @foxnews Pundits @marthamaccallum @BretBaier, Chris Wallace criticize our President.   Feckless and disgusting.  I can't watch Fox news any more. I only turned it on to get news on why the voting stopped.
1323906023673847808 2020-11-04 16:32:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ScottPresler @nebing @realDonaldTrump And Georgia and NC
1323905344947453954 2020-11-04 16:30:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON TONIGHT
1323905121097445376 2020-11-04 16:29:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CHIZMAGA Before they stopped I already did the math and he won GA, MI, WI, NC and Pennsylvania.  Media was calling states for Biden but not states Trump was winning at same % of counted votes and candidate tallies.   THIS IS A FRAUD AGAINST AMERICAN VOTERS
1323904562894286848 2020-11-04 16:26:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AOC Count the votes you stopped counting because you were losing!
1323904326717243394 2020-11-04 16:26:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews  The media, particularly Fox news just stopped calling states for President Trump.  States with % rations he clearly won yet they called them for Biden.   Americans know you are liars.   President Trump won tonight.  You don't stop counting just because your losing
1323903401718030337 2020-11-04 16:22:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DanaPerino  Hey Dana, we don't care what Ben Shapiro tweets!  President Trump won!  If you the media can call a win so can he if the numbers prove it.  The numbers proved he won several states and you and disgusting Fox news are backstabbers and liar.
1323902084488388608 2020-11-04 16:17:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We should do it now
1323901970533412864 2020-11-04 16:16:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PatriotKimmie @JamesDoss50 @FoxNews Fox news is trash and most the people on their are trash.  Chris Wallace is disgusting
1323901751980822528 2020-11-04 16:15:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @AmyMek Yes, I knew he won when I figured media would not call PA, GA, WI and Michigan and the % counted were in 65 to 70 % range and President ahead big lead. Then the media would not call it for Trump yet they call it for Biden with lower %.   This Tyranny is a night mare.  God help us
1323901090836832256 2020-11-04 16:13:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NinaB42662116 @MarkDice @NaturalNewsSHTF Twitter also is censoring the President tonight.  A clear violation of federal law.
1323900829313634304 2020-11-04 16:12:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bbputinwork @MarkDice Michigan Trump won too
1323900752276779008 2020-11-04 16:11:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bbputinwork @MarkDice So is PA AND WISCONSIN
1323900553932410880 2020-11-04 16:11:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice That's what I kept tweeting.  He was winning in those states also GA.  I was studying he % of votes counted vs the candidates tallies and the Media would not call those states for him yet they called for Biden states with same % or lower.
1323900003295744001 2020-11-04 16:08:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We need to all go march in the streets.  I'm willing to march in the streets now.
1323899831966822401 2020-11-04 16:08:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I'm done with social distancing and masks.
1323899556535259136 2020-11-04 16:07:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump President Trump won.  He is President for 4 more years.  Those states must stop what they are doing immediately.  My fear is how do we stop them from sneaking in the fake ballots?  Where is this headed?
1323899194583646208 2020-11-04 16:05:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump This can't be accepted and Americans must fight.  At this moment they are creating duplicate ballots to make up for the wins President Trump had tonight.  I was watching the numbers on % votes counted vs candidate tallies and Trump clearly won. Media would not call his states.
1323895211815137281 2020-11-04 15:49:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CarlosCruz2016 @Anthea06274890 @realDonaldTrump WAR
1323894919820267521 2020-11-04 15:48:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> I watched the numbers tonight and the percentage of votes counted vs the number President Trump and Biden had clearly showed President Trump won and the Media was not calling those states for President Trump.  They stopped the election to cheat.  President Trump was right.

1323886708148953089 2020-11-04 15:16:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why can I hear Brit hume and Martha Macallum in the background speaking on Cspan?  Are these outlets working together?  They forgot to lower their microphones.
1323882449919643648 2020-11-04 14:59:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GoldenlawSuze @islander4716 There will be a civil war.  They are stealing this election in order to take away 1st, 2nd amendment and all of the constitution and implement communism

1323806350346874882 2020-11-04 09:56:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray Sorry to hear that.  These people keep voting for the same political hacks that have been in office forever and have done nothing for their cities.  So ignorant of them.

1323558236335742977 2020-11-03 17:30:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray When he wins and they start rioting I don't think he's going to ask the Complicit Democrat Governor, mayors if he can send in the military.  He's going to just do it.   Law and Order will prevail with Trump
1323557095338205184 2020-11-03 17:26:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray @realDonaldTrump On November 4th Twitter will be irrelevant.
1323545383683854336 2020-11-03 16:39:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I prayed for that!    Dear God please bring us even a bigger victory tomorrow than the one we had four years ago.  Please reelect President Trump with unquestionable victory tomorrow.   Everyone please keep up the prayer!!!
1323541943553388546 2020-11-03 16:26:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump If Joe Biden were to become President everyone will be out of a job except Government employees.
1323538336443555842 2020-11-03 16:11:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump God Bless President Trump!  Prayers for President Trump and his family!!
1323537406264397824 2020-11-03 16:08:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> Pray for a big victory for Donald J. Trump tomorrow.   He has worked so hard for the American people.  I hope he gets a good night sleep tonight.  Ignore exit polls.  They are always wrong and they do this to discourage you from voting.
1323537009344876544 2020-11-03 16:06:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal It's possible.   Many business owners and people who have lost their jobs are fuming mad at Gavin Newsom!  Especially his recent decree telling us how many people we can have in our homes etc.  These Democrats think they are Kings/Queens.
1323444421031981056 2020-11-03 09:58:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> Covid-19 has a 99% Survival rate. Don't live in fear.  Don't listen to the fear mongering Left Democrat Communist Party and Media.   They are lying to you.   Keep your freedom.  Fight for your freedom.
1323444203272065025 2020-11-03 09:57:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> Save America!  Save your jobs!  Save your business!  Save the lives of preborn and born babies!  Save lives from the vicious, violent Democrat left rioters.  Stop unconstitutional lockdowns!     President Trump will save your jobs/business.  Vote for President Donald J. Trump
1323443322556313600 2020-11-03 09:54:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Stewart7Donna @bodacious2012 @JohnWDean Yes and the more life the Democrats take the thirstier they become.  This is why they don't care about destroying a persons name with lies, slander, libel.  Look what they did to Judge Kavanaugh and his wife.   Democrats are immoral, cruel, vicious.
1323441934145236992 2020-11-03 09:48:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I think it is backfiring!   People don't want to be locked in their homes.  It's not in our genes.
1323441067769802752 2020-11-03 09:45:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> Democrat Party is the Party of hatred and Racism.   Democrats fought to keep slavery in USA.   Republicans fought to end Slavery.    Democrats have not changed.
1323433191185641472 2020-11-03 09:13:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> America cannot afford 4 years of Racist Joe Biden and Kamala Harris running the country.   America needs to continue with our President who cares about the Black and Hispanic Americans and their communities.   President Trump reducing unfair Prison sentencing and creating jobs.
1323432481912057856 2020-11-03 09:11:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork @realDonaldTrump When is the next Rally?  Is it this one in Kenosha?  When's it start?
1323431382979260418 2020-11-03 09:06:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bodacious2012 @JohnWDean We need to get back to honoring (integrity) in America.  People forget what Integrity is and why we need it.    Democrats lie constantly.  They are the party of abortion.  Once they start taking lives of pre born babies they can't stop their charade of terror across the USA.
1323430705628663809 2020-11-03 09:04:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @bodacious2012 @JohnWDean His mind is a dishonest one.
1323430509590925312 2020-11-03 09:03:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryyMcCoy @JohnWDean Vote all Democrats out of office.  We need a safe America.  We need safe neighborhoods and safe cities.  We need Mayors and Governors who stop violence not encourage it.   Democrat Party is party of Chaos and violence.   Keep your city safe and vote Republican all the way!
1323429887428890624 2020-11-03 09:00:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JohnWDean What does it say about the Democrat Party and Joe Biden who encourage the Domestic Terrorist Rioters and say nothing when they burn down cities?   It says we need to vote Democrats out of office tomorrow and we need to stop them from defunding the police.   Law and order
1323429110736023552 2020-11-03 08:57:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JohnWDean The Domestic Terrorist rioters are not under Trump they are under the Domestic Terrorist Democrat Governors and Mayors who are allowing the violence and not calling in National Guard.  Rephrase your question honestly.
1323428451861188608 2020-11-03 08:55:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @MEC02081229 Joe Biden is a RACIST and so is Kamala Harris.
1323428168330477568 2020-11-03 08:53:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @marthamaccallum  snake man Brit Hume on Maccalum's liberal talk show said that Biden was right and "the notion that trump mishandled the virus is well known and in the polls"  What a sleazy, disgusting lie! @brithume   Your network @FoxNews is going to end up like CNN Ratings
1323425024120770560 2020-11-03 08:41:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump I have a lot of friends in California who are Hispanic and voting for President Donald J. Trump.
1323424144847855617 2020-11-03 08:37:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @marthamaccallum @FOXNEWS  Fox news is not covering the last few Trump Rallies but if Biden were speaking they would be covering the rally.  We are on to you Fox news!  Your liberal producers are destroying your network!
1323418759780917249 2020-11-03 08:16:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> I just voted for President Donald J. Trump for President.  MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA MAGA
1323369716623175680 2020-11-03 05:01:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Mpskr4 Good question.  It won't end well if they cheat.   We definitely won't accept the outcome of a fraudulent election.   Every new vote that pops up out of know where needs to be examined and signatures checked.
1323355900275351552 2020-11-03 04:06:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PatriotRally @Matthew_4_Trump Yes, you don't have to be a Doctor to understand when your government is lying to you.   God gave us Common sense and instinct for a reason.
1323355232747708416 2020-11-03 04:04:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump It's all about power and control.  215,000 is not even the real  number of Covid-19 deaths.  It's half that. They included Flu deaths, cancer, heart attacks, car accidents as Covid in their numbers.   Even CDC's Dr. Birx admitted this on live TV.  And what happened to the FLU?
1323352315990978560 2020-11-03 03:52:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> The reason there are more Covid-19 cases is because America is doing more testing that any other country.  We now know that the death rate is very low.    The Media and the Democrat Governors are using this Virus to LOCK YOU DOWN.   They are lying to you.
1323351828658991104 2020-11-03 03:50:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> Covid-19 has a 99% Survival rate.   Millions contract it and 99% recover.  Don't let the Media scare you.  The media and Democrat politicians are lying to you.  Stop voting for Democrats.  The only way to stop the lies and misinformation is to vote Republican all the way.
1323348574063652864 2020-11-03 03:37:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump What the Democrats are doing today is very similar to what Hitler did in the beginning of his reign of terror.   Americans need to wake up fast!
1323348172769357825 2020-11-03 03:36:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The Media and Democrats behind closed doors are laughing at the people they control because they are so easy to manipulate.
1323347830811947008 2020-11-03 03:34:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Especially on the local 30 minute news stations,  CBS, NBC, ABC.  People who don't have cable or other forms of news believe these lies.
1323346563628900352 2020-11-03 03:29:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Praying for a Trump Landslide so we don't have to go through chaos for two weeks.   Unlike 4 years go this election is different.  More Democrats leaving their party to vote Republican.  More independents voting Republican.
1323345495117320192 2020-11-03 03:25:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They attacked him and his family non stop with Slander, fake Russia collusion investigations, false allegations, non stop obstruction.  President Trump deserves another 8 years to make up for the 4 they stole.
1323342774993760256 2020-11-03 03:14:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MichaelT_45 @JoVotes45 @JackPosobiec  If voting goes beyond November 3rd the tallies should not be announced until voting is done.
1323342631653441536 2020-11-03 03:14:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MichaelT_45 @JoVotes45 @JackPosobiec   They are listening to the polls in each state and if Biden is down they are creating counterfeit, duplicate ballots.  They've been doing this in California for years.  When everyone votes on Nov 3rd they will wait for the tallies so they can adjust their cheating
1323341527758774274 2020-11-03 03:09:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PanhandleExit @hollandcourtney @KatherineWolfr2 @realDonaldTrump Communists Kamala Harris and Joe Biden and their Democrat Communist party are  using a virus with a 99% Survival rate to scare people and Media Fear Mongering the Virus in order to destroy Business/jobs and bring in Communism.
1323221711198715904 2020-11-02 19:13:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realMikeLindell @realDonaldTrump He should be up over 50% in Minnesota.  It's a shame that Americans are so ignorant and immorally bankrupt that they could vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

1323211664473255936 2020-11-02 18:33:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pyramidmedicine The Democrat Party is a Dangerous Party.  They need to just change the name from Democrat Socialist Party to Democrat Communist Party.

1323208824661049345 2020-11-02 18:22:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @recklessteeaa Yes.  The Democrats have not denounced Antifa or BLM rioters.
1323207924622131200 2020-11-02 18:18:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KamalaHarris You're a Communist.  Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin were evil and so are you.
1323207245505572866 2020-11-02 18:16:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @robbystarbuck @KamalaHarris I've been telling people for years that the Democrats are Communists, Marxists.   Socialism is just a nice word for communism.
1323204290018648070 2020-11-02 18:04:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ScottPresler @sea5 Thank you for your hard work and for being keenly aware that the Democrat Left is going to be cheating on Tuesday.   Need to watch the vehicles who take the ballots and make sure the ballots are delivered safely and counted.  We need to watch the people who are counting.
1323200102790426624 2020-11-02 17:47:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealJamesWoods I pray to God for a Trump Landslide.    God help America and save it from the violent Far Left Democrat Party.
1323199187979104256 2020-11-02 17:44:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SicarioScott @Eliz_Hightower @FloridaDude297 They are using Joe Biden as a prop and plan on making Kamala the President.  Dems trying to fool their own voters because the voters did not want Kamala as president.  She came almost last place in the debates.  No one liked her.   Far LEFT Dem party deceiving their voters.

Nobody can afford Obama Care and the coverage is horrible.   Democrats caused many people to lose their Doctors.  Joe Biden lied and said we could keep our Doctors.

1323043435368992769 2020-11-02 07:25:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you vote for Joe Biden you are actually voting for Kamala Harris.  Do you really want her to run the country?
1323042974234636288 2020-11-02 07:23:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris:  They will go after your business, your jobs, your 2nd amendment and get rid of 911 emergency assistance.  They will de-fund police and the 911 emergency system will be useless.  They will send Antifa to riot and destroy Suburban homes.

They will regret it all their lives as they live under Tyranny and communist rule.  They will lose everything they worked for and never get their freedom back in their lifetime.

1323000693830070287 2020-11-02 04:35:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is what you hear about happening in Communist China not the United States.  These Governors are following Communist China guidelines.   This is Communism.   Covid-19 Survival rate is 99%    It's time to open up our country!
1322999650111029248 2020-11-02 04:31:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> Governors are abusing their power!  They have no right to force business to take peoples names and numbers.  This is total BS. They are using a virus with a 99% Survival Rate to implement COMMUNISM in USA.
1322998458769313792 2020-11-02 04:26:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle @GovWhitmer The death rate of Covid is very very low.  Governors are using Covid-19 to give them power.   American people need to take away that power and send a message on Tuesday!
1322998103968944128 2020-11-02 04:25:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> This reminds me how Adolph Hitler operated in Germany and the other countries he took over.   These Democrat Governors are on power trips.  They think they are Kings and Queens or Dictators!

1322811678040289285 2020-11-01 16:04:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @girlscouts How RUDE and cruel of you to congratulate a fine woman who became a member of the Supreme Court with a photo of her next to the other members and then you delete the tweet?  The tweet was not political but you made it political by deleting it.  You should be ashamed of yourselves

Democrats will be cheating up the yin yang.

Media has been exposed!
1322461285250785283 2020-10-31 16:51:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @smalltownglobal @realDonaldTrump I pray and ask God to let President Trump win by such a huge landslide that it won't matter how many votes they need to count after Nov 3rd.

1322398173487267840 2020-10-31 12:41:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you think the rioters are going to stop rioting if President Trump does not get elected you are wrong!   If the Democrat Party takes power they won't stop rioting, tearing down business, looting until the Dem Party gives them everything they want, including your suburban home!

Even when they know something is false they spread it.  The last administration repealed a law that enables media to lie to us.  it needs to be reversed.

Almost all upper management is useless.   There are people below FBI Director Chris Wray that seem to run the FBI.  They protected Hillary Clinton and now Joe Biden by hiding evidence.
1321899709787635712 2020-10-30 03:40:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We certainly don't need the FBI.   They are a tool of the Democrat Party.  They were infiltrated long ago to protect Criminal Democrat Politicians like Biden and Clinton.
1321762260256137216 2020-10-29 18:34:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarshaBlackburn Repeal Section 230 Regulate Twitter, facebook and Google.     Same way they regulated the telephone company and utilities.  It needs to be done!  It's time.
1321761618095611905 2020-10-29 18:31:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @navyrick111 @ViKu1111 @jack @Facebook @tedcruz Past due.   It is time!    Regulate them.
1321761309113741312 2020-10-29 18:30:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why does Twitter think its their job to continuously tell us that we must trust mail in voting?  Why is Twitter tagging peoples tweets and telling the reader that mail in voting is safe?  How is this not election interference?
1321760511583608833 2020-10-29 18:27:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SebGorka @PDdeplorable OK, the officer involved needs to SUE Bernie Sanders for this statement.  Please don't tell me that Bernie Sanders can't be sued because he's a politician.
1321759428559859712 2020-10-29 18:22:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ViKu1111 @jack @Facebook @tedcruz If you watch Jacks eyes you can see once in a while he looks away and is reading a teleprompter when he's answering Ted Cruz questions.  Someone is helping him answer the questions.
1321748546077351937 2020-10-29 17:39:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @RealJamesWoods Jack does not appear to be sober.  Did you see his eyes?  As if he just came out of a dark room.
1321747265451515904 2020-10-29 17:34:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarshaBlackburn Great Job questioning these Social Media Bullies!    So good to call out foreign countries/dictators.   Twitter is indeed censoring our President.
1321741658820542464 2020-10-29 17:12:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> So true 👇👇👇
1321741282381713409 2020-10-29 17:10:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @StateofusAll He's definitely lost control but he knows what they are doing regarding censoring.  He's lying.
1321735205925883909 2020-10-29 16:46:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NyeForgeWorks @vijaya @Twitter @Facebook I'm trying to figure out why they are labeling my tweets as offensive?  I don't use bad language.   Makes no sense.
1321734993375162369 2020-10-29 16:45:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah What was the tweet??  What did it say?
1321734310488023040 2020-10-29 16:43:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NyeForgeWorks @vijaya @Twitter @Facebook Yes they are and they need to be reigned in.  They are a danger to our freedoms and to our US Constitution.
1321733278487834624 2020-10-29 16:39:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NyeForgeWorks @vijaya @Twitter @Facebook Maybe when people reply to jack he punishes us?  https://t.co/j4nx4JUFS7
1321732733178052608 2020-10-29 16:36:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NyeForgeWorks @vijaya @Twitter @Facebook really?  Wow!  Maybe because I've constantly been retweeting Tony Bobulinski?  Or maybe because I replied to Jack?
1321731529270194177 2020-10-29 16:32:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pazja07 @jkotrides We have State run Media now.  Pray for President Trump and for his victory.  His victory is ours.  We need to save USA.
1321731169323417600 2020-10-29 16:30:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NyeForgeWorks @vijaya @Twitter @Facebook @tedcruz open and listen to the video of Marsha Blackburn call jack out and tell him that he's allowing foreign countries to come on twitter and influence our elections.  She really hit a nerve with him.    https://t.co/FeDGDjdHgp
1321729708761911298 2020-10-29 16:24:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NyeForgeWorks @vijaya @Twitter @Facebook They will be regulated and I think it's coming soon!
1321729266682273792 2020-10-29 16:23:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NyeForgeWorks @vijaya @Twitter @Facebook Thanks for telling me. I guess they think its offensive because they don't want us repealing Section 230?  They are  liars and Twitter lied again today before Congress
1321723295641735174 2020-10-29 15:59:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pnjaban @TuckerCarlson At least we can take comfort in knowing that the majority of the  electorate in the USA  now know that the media is corrupt and complicit in covering up for Joe Biden.  It's no longer a suspicion but a fact.  They will never be trusted. @abcnews @cbsnews @CBSLA @NBCNews @MSNBC
1321713770184364032 2020-10-29 15:21:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jennife15496769 CNN is Fake news and it's going to end up bankrupt from many many lawsuits in the next couple years.
1321713144851435520 2020-10-29 15:19:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tyler_casper Wait...  maybe when I was a baby
1321713067978235905 2020-10-29 15:18:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tyler_casper Never
1321710892736675840 2020-10-29 15:10:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rpgajewski1 @FoxNews @MaryFass3 @RepAOC Nope,  I do not find her attractive at all and her personality makes it worse.   Melania Trump is an older woman and AOC can't hold a candle to Melania's beauty.  These magazines don't know what real glamour is.
1321692338314309632 2020-10-29 13:56:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MZHemingway @ddwiese Who was the shipper?  I'll be sure not to use them.
1321691458710073346 2020-10-29 13:52:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jack Let people speak without being suspended and censored.  It's really not a difficult concept.
1321691159261933568 2020-10-29 13:51:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jack We do not have free speech on the internet.    230 was derived to insure free speech but you are suspending us for speaking.   That's why it is going to be repealed.  In 2009 we were laughed at when we told people why you were suspending us.  Now congress knows.
1321689700688486400 2020-10-29 13:45:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jack Your employees are all liberal and have been suspending conservatives for no reason. No rules violated.  Liberals on Twitter falsely report and your liberal employees suspend us. It's been going on since 2009.  They can block if they don't like us. Why do you have a block button?
1321683752158863361 2020-10-29 13:22:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rose33090 That's why the President is on to them and they need to be caught and prosecuted.  We cannot allow them to steal the election.
1321682164065267712 2020-10-29 13:15:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FoxNews @MaryFass3 AOC is NOT attractive.
1321681414404780033 2020-10-29 13:12:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jaizem Pelosi is signaling that their will be massive voter fraud, CHEATING to help Joe Biden win.  They are working with social media and the post office to steal the election and we must not let them
1321677628961533953 2020-10-29 12:57:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> Wow!  Rep Marsha Blackburn is on to Twitter exposing them for allowing foreign governments to influence American elections on Twitter.  She is smart!   Twitter is a danger to our country.  Facebook too.
1321676503176810497 2020-10-29 12:53:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ArthurSchwartz @Shawna_7777 And those 7.56 Million viewers will tell their family and friends and everyone they know on Social Media that Biden is a Criminal.
1321675739549192192 2020-10-29 12:50:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Herbert_L_Reed I think our Government should close Twitter down!  Facebook too.  They are dangerous.
1321671301929394182 2020-10-29 12:32:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @philipsknowlton So am I.  You called them what they all are.  Cowards!  Even wealthy, powerful people who see this is wrong are cowards, afraid to use their power.
1321669419735511040 2020-10-29 12:25:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @my3monkees We use to hear about other countries with State run media and we were thankful that it was not that bad here.  Now it is  here.  Our News Media is ran by government politicians. This is what happens before countries enter into communism.
1321665853130092547 2020-10-29 12:11:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump  Repeal Section 230
1321664384624594944 2020-10-29 12:05:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice Anything they dispute they call a conspiracy theory.
1321663458203459585 2020-10-29 12:01:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealMattCouch @OldGeek64 I'm so sick of @foxnews they will be the new CNN once CNN goes bankrupt and closes their doors.
1321662217662603269 2020-10-29 11:56:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice @Acosta Jim Acosta, you are a liar and you work for a fake news organization that promotes hate and lies.   CNN is Fake News!
1321655880371220481 2020-10-29 11:31:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @charliekirk11 The Media is the enemy of the American people and enemy of truth.
1321650747637858304 2020-10-29 11:11:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kevincorke @kaylow77 Lot of Liberals at Fox News.  I'm sure they were listening in and easily able to find out where the package was.
1321646791058620416 2020-10-29 10:55:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Dekedog @kevincorke @MikayesFiona It was stupid to ship those that way.
1321646385523912705 2020-10-29 10:53:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kevincorke @kaylow77 @TuckerCarlson Is your producer who mailed the package to you a Democrat?  Could he have mailed it empty and sold the contents to the Biden cartel? Why would you ship something this sensitive and important via a carrier?   Please tell me you made copies?  Please.
1321644211708387331 2020-10-29 10:45:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheOtherTurk @LegendaryEnergy Irresponsible of Fox News.
1321641724939153409 2020-10-29 10:35:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cmunson44 @LegendaryEnergy Fox News has tons of money to do that rather than using a carrier who they claim they "never had problems with in the past".     Ridiculous.
1321639615934078976 2020-10-29 10:26:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump If this story was reversed and it was VP Mike Pence you know that Twitter and Media would have the story plastered everywhere.  Headlines everywhere.   This is election interference.   Media suppressing the story.   They are complicit in the corruption.
1321638246913241089 2020-10-29 10:21:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LegendaryEnergy @luv18wheels I know.  I hope they were copies.   He said they never had a problem with that carrier before but have they ever been documents that important?   Geesh.  Irresponsible of Fox News.
1321617272658513920 2020-10-29 08:58:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @thebradfordfile Yes, it was highly irresponsible to ship those documents that way.  Should have been flown in by a person they know.  You are correct.  I hope they were copies.  Totally irresponsible!
1321616447106408448 2020-10-29 08:54:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GeorgePapa19 @Brandjosh123 FBI are a bunch of leeches living off the taxpayers and doing nothing for our country except covering up for criminal politicians.
1321616036387385348 2020-10-29 08:53:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AP @pnjaban You forgot lying under oath.
1321615742555414528 2020-10-29 08:52:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thebradfordfile @Soh1006 Those Documents should not have been sent that way.  Hopefully they were copies
1321613895476289537 2020-10-29 08:44:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tedcruz @Craftmastah @jack @nypost He lied last time and nothing happened.
1321601713799790592 2020-10-29 07:56:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> It's difficult to read people's tweets when their words, letters are all capitalized.  I know they probably think we can see it because its bigger but it's actually harder to see.
1321597546628706304 2020-10-29 07:39:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KamVTV Media is complicit in covering up criminal activity.  FBI should be investigating fake news organizations.
1321597216268587009 2020-10-29 07:38:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kerrwilk @robbystarbuck Which explains why he's too lazy to shave.
1321596806036295680 2020-10-29 07:36:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump YES but get out and vote!   We cannot take any chances because the Democrats are cheating as we tweet.
1321595577784676352 2020-10-29 07:31:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TuckerCarlson Tuning in only to your show and Lauras.  @IngrahamAngle
1321593123605078016 2020-10-29 07:22:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Topsy71452 So those words can allow anyone to do whatever they want.  The magic words?
1321589124181057541 2020-10-29 07:06:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SteveScalise @MawPatriot I have been suspended in the past for no reason.  Did not break any rules.  They just did not like the fact that I support my President.  So it's a lie when they say its due to any other reason.
1321588453042085888 2020-10-29 07:03:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BigmindLoa @drdavidsamadi Twitter outright lied last time.   Congress does not hold them accountable.   We are sick of the shows.   Action please.  @tedcruz
1321587473244303360 2020-10-29 06:59:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Anthea06274890 Congress should not allow zoom hearings.  They should make them show up in person.
1321585344890859522 2020-10-29 06:51:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @drdavidsamadi Google, Twitter and Facebook were brought in to hearings not long ago and they basically lied.    We need action not more endless hearings.
1321556024474521602 2020-10-29 04:54:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @deneenborelli @jack @nypost Why does Congress make them take an oath not to lie?    They lied last time they were there and Congress never does anything when they commit perjury.   Also they should make them come in and not do this from zoom.  They should appear personally.
1321555566557237248 2020-10-29 04:52:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TomFitton @Twitter @jack @nypost He can't afford to shave?
1321553887195615235 2020-10-29 04:46:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson They are purposely withholding information from the American people.   Election Interference is from the Media not Russia.
1321553647487000577 2020-10-29 04:45:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Why can't American Citizens bring forth class action lawsuits against fake news for reporting LIES to us?  Freedom of the press never meant freedom for press to LIE to American people.  It needs to Stop!   Congress must act.
1321551959170510852 2020-10-29 04:38:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @BreanneTolson1 Thank you Mr. President.  Yes, repeal section 230 and break up the google monopoly.
1321548562925199361 2020-10-29 04:25:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump And Jack told Senator Cruz they do not have the power to influence the election.   He knows that's not true.
1321374658738876418 2020-10-28 16:54:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 The fake Media needs to be arrested for crimes against the American people for Treason.
1321371572150521856 2020-10-28 16:41:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> Every Christian needs to get out and vote for President Donald J. Trump.   The Democrat Party hates God.
1321368446513209344 2020-10-28 16:29:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JumzyRau @GeorgePapa19 @Q_alitheia2018 We can't assume that it will be a landslide.  We must all continue to pray and vote.  This could be a very close election and stressful because Democrats are cheating.
1321367881309851649 2020-10-28 16:27:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 The Liar Adam Schiff I looked at his twitter page and he's tweeting lies about Trump resort.  You would think he give lying mouth a rest after he just caused the Bidens to be exposed because of his lies.  Doesn't anyone in the Dem Party tell him to shut up?
1321366851213955074 2020-10-28 16:23:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 When will we have Justice in our country?  Will will it happen?  Will it ever happen?
1321366126694076417 2020-10-28 16:20:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> Adam Schiff's continuous lies finally caught up with him.
1321365449066467330 2020-10-28 16:17:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @lalapuj @BigRose25 @MZHemingway Adam Schiff's constant lies blaming everything on Russia finally has caused major problems for the Democrat Party.    Whistle Blower told Bidens to make Adam retract his lies but they refused....  Now Biden and Democrats in big trouble.   Adam Schiff in trouble with his party now
1321359031772934145 2020-10-28 15:51:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> Joe Biden needs to step down from the race.

1321300024861622273 2020-10-28 11:57:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tracybeanz Yes, they need to stop playing games and stop being cowards and bring in Justice.
1321296228022390789 2020-10-28 11:42:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They wear masks to hide their faces. Crime is up everywhere because of this masking up hype.
1321294930053107715 2020-10-28 11:37:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealVinnieJames Yes, we cannot stop praying.  God is helping us but we have to keep asking for his help.     Left wing politicians/media are very evil people.
1321293801370066945 2020-10-28 11:32:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> We all need to email and text this link and any others that shows the evidence that the main stream media wants to hide for Crooked Joe Biden
1321292363625603074 2020-10-28 11:27:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealVinnieJames We need to email our friends and family.   Text friends and family this interview and other evidence the Media is hiding..

1321287165637177346 2020-10-28 11:06:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JevonWilliamsVI @FBI Why did the FBI remain silent when they had the evidence in Hunters laptop?

1320861036925210626 2020-10-27 06:53:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> Joe Biden came out of his basement today and stood 25 feet away  from the fake media who were asking him baby questions.  Joe Biden never took his mask off while speaking because he wants to make it clear to America that if he is elected President he will lock down the country.

1320650508604878848 2020-10-26 16:56:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mvanbrocklin @PatriciaHeaton They don't understand because they could never give that up for God so instead they attack celibacy, chastity.    IMO these people who want priests to marry like protestant ministers are just watered down Catholics.
1320649810639089664 2020-10-26 16:53:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seann3201 @PatriciaHeaton So does God have good reasons.   Just because they cannot control their desires does not mean someone who is holy, follows teachings of the church and imitates Jesus Christ Can't.   Chastity, being celibate for Jesus Christ is HOLY.
1320647422020775941 2020-10-26 16:44:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @scottmjablonski @PatriciaHeaton Worldly people cannot understand the sacrifice of a priest who takes vows of Chastity, poverty and obedience.   Blessed be the pure of heart.
1320644020863791107 2020-10-26 16:30:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PatriciaHeaton Orthodox/Anglican churches are not Catholic and these problems magnified after Vatican II.  But just an FYI for you.. Every denomination has bad apples.
1320643381840605184 2020-10-26 16:28:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JuanaLaLoca573 @PatriciaHeaton I second that!  A priest to me is someone  I know is totally imitating Jesus Christ to the fullest.
1320641799581413380 2020-10-26 16:21:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AbbyJohnson @PatriciaHeaton Yes and following the teachings of the church not throwing away celibacy.  Priest and nuns who give their whole to God and to the souls of their parish will be rewarded.     Promote purity and the rosary.
1320640087265140737 2020-10-26 16:15:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PatriciaHeaton We need a Pope who will bring back the Latin mass and daily rosary in all churches world wide.  Kneel before Holy Communion.  Have respect for the Holy Eucharist.  We don't need a Pope to start marrying priests.  That won't solve the problems it will make things worse.
1320639468244594688 2020-10-26 16:12:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PatriciaHeaton Who is going to pay for the Priests family?  Will the priest get a job?  Having a family takes a lot of work, especially when you are not wealthy.....  The sheep of the church aka parishioners should be the main focus for the priest not a wife and family to take care of.
1320638499607883776 2020-10-26 16:08:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PatriciaHeaton Ministers of all denominations have been caught up in abuse/perversion, scandal not just the Catholic Church.   The Catholic church is larger so more scandal can be found. A good priests lives his vows of Chastity.  Some take vows of Chastity, poverty and obedience.
1320637714094436352 2020-10-26 16:05:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PatriciaHeaton Celibacy is Holy and pure. Jesus Christ was and so was his Mother.  All their lives.  We call a priest Father because he is our spiritual father. Bad priests will do bad things and break vows so if married do we want to see them cheating on their wives?  Chastity is HOLY

1320210159042322432 2020-10-25 11:46:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> Biden's past being exposed and people are realizing that Joe Biden is racist.  So is the entire Democrat Party.

1320203940571430914 2020-10-25 11:22:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jayobtv You need to stop defending terrorists and you need to stop supporting those who hate the jewish people.    She has a right to be afraid of these organizations.  They are dangerous.
1320202329300164608 2020-10-25 11:15:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Mask shaming is a scheme that was devised by the far left socialist who want to take away the constitution.   A dirty trick and the sheep just fall for it.

1320196849966276608 2020-10-25 10:53:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealJamesWoods President Trump wins Twitter will be out of business.  Section 230 is right around the corner.   Social Media took a gamble by deciding to interfere in the election thinking Biden will win.  They will lose big $$$$
1320192128597671936 2020-10-25 10:35:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> Hey patriots, if trolls pop up on your conversations and they attack President Trump don't try to argue with them or tell them how ignorant they are.  They are reporting you to Twitter and Twitter will suspend you at the blink of an eye.  They work for Twitter.  Just block them

Wondering if this is a trick and they want us to think they are losing so as to stop us from going out to vote.    Lets not fall for their tricks.  Everyone needs to go out and vote for President Trump.

Despicable.

Did you see Nancy Pelosi wearing her mask at a podium talking through her mask and yet nobody within 30 feet?   These people are sick in the head.

Nothing about his lies last night. We need real Press in this country.  These networks are not American Press.    So dishonest.   Makes me sick.
1319703865302806528 2020-10-24 02:14:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> lol   Is this a joke?  Biden, you lied all night last night and most obviously when you denied that you said you were banning fracking and we have you saying you will ban it on video.
1319703528286220288 2020-10-24 02:13:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KarenMy26623876 Hard to tell because he has so many of them.  I'm sure he has basements in each mansion.

1319701230633902080 2020-10-24 02:04:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump After all the hard work these last 4 years at building up our country's economy and peace relations and then recovering from Covid the last thing we need are Democrats to step in and undo all the Good accomplished.

1319556798513246208 2020-10-23 16:30:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattCubstead @w_terrence LOL  Biden clearly lost the debate and even lied to the American people about his stance on fracking.  We have the video.
1319555879138594817 2020-10-23 16:26:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Scaramucci Which debate did you watch?  Were you drinking? Trump won. Biden also lied about fracking.  He's on video saying he's going to stop fracking.
1319555459078975490 2020-10-23 16:25:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DiamondandSilk That number is too high.  Somethings wrong.

1319544220177215496 2020-10-23 15:40:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RodgerDoggers @marklevinshow I know.  I thought about that before the debate.  Knew he would lie about fracking and the China money laundering.  Would be nice if he had an ipod with the video on it.   He needs to plaster it all across the country in TV ads starting tomorrow!
1319539911741956096 2020-10-23 15:23:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kelly4freedom @TDelyfer What's said is so many don't care about integrity today.
1319538672249663490 2020-10-23 15:18:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr I know.  I couldn't believe he would like on live TV to millions of Americans when he is on video more than once saying he will ban fracking.
1319535913496539137 2020-10-23 15:07:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Italianmike @guardian449 Actually I was surprised she was so professional and kept her bias to herself.  Unlike Chris Wallace who couldn't control his bias against Trump.
1319528523019681794 2020-10-23 14:38:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ClayTravis President Trump cleaned his clock.
1319528108542754816 2020-10-23 14:36:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You won BIG tonight.

1319489540784967680 2020-10-23 12:03:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LilaGraceRose No mention in the debate because the moderator and network are Democrats.  That's not our Presidents fault.  Now they have a mute button so he has to stay on topic.
1319489183434436608 2020-10-23 12:01:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DrBiden You have no empathy for preborn children.
1319489056904941568 2020-10-23 12:01:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DrBiden Integrity, honesty is on the ballot and Joe Biden has none of those qualities.   He even lied about fracking tonight and we have him on videos saying he will stop fracking.

1319487685149351937 2020-10-23 11:55:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Why would anyone vote for someone who has the nerve to outright lie on live TV when we have him on Videos saying the opposite?
1319487396409294848 2020-10-23 11:54:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte We listen to Cspan callers and they are more honest than the pundits on Fox news.   I'd rather hear Americans call in and comment about the debate than the clowns that were on tonight.
1319487133740982273 2020-10-23 11:53:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Biden wants to close down the entire oil industry.  I wonder what Texas and Oklahoma think about that?
1319486317680492545 2020-10-23 11:50:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden How much money is China giving you?
1319485654619729921 2020-10-23 11:47:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden You lied on live TV about fracking.  We have videos of you saying you will BAN FRACKING.  Recent videos.  YOU'RE A LIAR and you CANNOT be trusted.
1319485116708655105 2020-10-23 11:45:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice And Fox News pundits tried to call it a tie.    We watched Cspan and actual Americans were able to call in to comment and say who won.  The callers were much more intelligent and more respectful than any of the Fox news pundits.  Fox news really at new low level @FoxNews
1319484544752340993 2020-10-23 11:43:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SharylAttkisson @DaneSenser TRUMP WON
1319484185568923648 2020-10-23 11:41:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealRLimbaugh @realDonaldTrump Can you believe Joe Biden actually lied on live TV and said he never said he was against Fracking yet we have numerous videos of him saying he wants to get rid of fracking.     President needs to plaster that video on every network daily in the USA
1319483646990974976 2020-10-23 11:39:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump That's because the Democrat Networks are picking the topics.  Never heard about prolife either.
1319483310712655872 2020-10-23 11:38:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Run this ad in all states letting them know what a Liar Joe Biden is and add that he said he is closing down the oil Industry.   Wow!  Closing the oil Industry?  That will bring USA down to a 3rd world country.
1319482925490995201 2020-10-23 11:36:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Joe Biden outright lied.    Why do people vote and support outright liars like Joe Biden?
1319482488738041856 2020-10-23 11:35:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Please run more ads in Wisconsin.   A friend of mine said there are tons of ads for Biden and few for you.
1319480649661595648 2020-10-23 11:27:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JunoSirius And do you notice how they put the worse on during debates?
1319480508544237569 2020-10-23 11:27:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @millerrhodes @BentleyK @FoxNews I'd rather listen to Cspan and hear Americans call in rather than dishonest Fox News pundits calling it a tie.   Chris Wallace insulting our President.  Even Dems calling in are not as insulting and disrespectful as Chris Wallace.  Fox news Sucks.
1319478716691435521 2020-10-23 11:20:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @marklevinshow @BelievingGood President Trump won the debate.

At the beginning of the debate Wallace insulted President Trump saying he interrupted 146 times last debate.    Why is Fox news rubbing Wallace in our face?  They must want to lose viewers and $$
1319477908566519816 2020-10-23 11:17:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TexasHairapy @LucasLey2 @FoxNews @CNN @TuckerCarlson I guess Fox News wants to lose their viewers $$ because millions are tuning out.

1319441775883243520 2020-10-23 08:53:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> I heard @foxnews Chris Wallace just insulted our President saying he interrupted the last debate 146 times.  Chris Wallace is a hack liar and Fox news stinks.
1319439128593788928 2020-10-23 08:42:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> Wow!  A liberal Democrat neighbor of mine said she does not like how the Media is protecting Joe Biden and only asking President Trump tough, hateful questions.  That changed her vote and SHE IS VOTING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP! @abcnews @NBCNews @CBSNews @MSNBC
1319429157734891521 2020-10-23 08:03:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bubblebathgirl I rarely watch Fox news during the day so I'm glad I didn't have to See their BS.   Fox news consist of a bunch of cowards who were sold out by the left liars.

You did an excellent job exposing 60 minutes @60Minutes and Lesley Stahl @LesleyRStahl as nothing more than Far Left propagandist for the Democrat Party.  Unbelievable how she would deny FACTS.  She was rude and arrogant.

Going into a debate we know is a set up big time.  They are going to constantly mute his mic and more.  He may end up having to leave the debate on live air.   It's a set up.
1319052102056857601 2020-10-22 07:05:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr The Debate Commission is campaigning for Joe Biden.  Tell your dad, our President to push back and demand fairness.  If they can't do that he has every right to seek another network who can and he should bypass the Debate Commission because they are acting illegally.
1319051686841708545 2020-10-22 07:03:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr Our President should cancel this upcoming debate and demand a non biased moderator and fair debate rules.

If you are going to close it down please open it up and give housing to the homeless in California.    This would be the charitable thing for Disney to do if Disney really, truly cares about people.

1318786478281928704 2020-10-21 13:29:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Mr_PharaohMan @sunbreese Yes, sadly the FBI is a worthless organization.  Full of terrible corruption.  I don't think the corruption is just all from the top.
1318785526451687426 2020-10-21 13:25:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @hrtablaze @sunbreese I'm a Californian born here and this state is a mess.  In 2016 4.5 million Californians voted for President Trump but there are so many Communist Democrats in this state even if he won the state they would cheat and successfully destroy the ballots.  Bad corruption in California
1318783011001823232 2020-10-21 13:15:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> Can you just imagine how some of these Democrat Governors in closed door rooms with their Democrat cohorts are laughing at us probably saying:  " haha, lets do another TOILET PAPER shortage on these stupid sheep"
1318782175794221056 2020-10-21 13:12:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> Can you just imagine how some of these Democrat Governors in closed door rooms with their Democrat cohorts are laughing at us probably saying:  " haha, lets do another toilet paper shortage on these stupid sheep"  America was not designed for dictator tyrants
1318778596605874177 2020-10-21 12:58:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please post the interview.  We want to see it.   Full transparency on the fake news media.
1318774538008621061 2020-10-21 12:42:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is what the Democrat Party promotes, supports and legalizes.  Anyone who votes for a Democrat is just sick:
1318773848406257664 2020-10-21 12:39:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> Anyone else get robot calls on their phone saying: "thank you for taking this poll and recording your preferred Candidate as Joe Biden"?  From a blocked number?     I never took a poll and I'm not voting for Joe Biden that's for sure.
1318762973184225282 2020-10-21 11:56:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1CuriousTadpole @ACTBrigitte The last debate that fake "moderator" told him he had to discuss a different topic and tried to tell him he couldn't talk about that subject.  This next debate they are going to be disrespectful to our President and try to mute him.  @realDonaldTrump   Demand non biased moderator
1318762082297245696 2020-10-21 11:52:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Textimama Thanks back to you!  Yeah, Twitter is always busy removing our followers.  We are use to their unfair ways.  Sad to say.  That will change one day when Section 230 is repealed.
1318756733376815104 2020-10-21 11:31:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec @lylestoner Nope
1318755990733377537 2020-10-21 11:28:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte They are going to mute our President.  They want to make him look bad.
1318754499607973889 2020-10-21 11:22:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> Mostly Democrat Politicians are afraid of Google because it knows their secrets.
1318754093700034560 2020-10-21 11:20:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Rockprincess818 @Soh1006 The majority of American women love President Trump and respect him for looking out after the safety of all of us.   Law and order is important.  Without it we live in very dangerous times.
1318753212019605505 2020-10-21 11:17:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> Also, they say the Google Mini does not listen in or spy but it does and once I woke up at night to a loud sound from the speakers and it sounded like somebody moving paper around their desk or work space.  Definitely paper sound.  I unplug it at night now.   Creepy Google
1318752766194380801 2020-10-21 11:15:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> Just for fun I bought a little Google Mini a few months ago and keep it near my nightstand.  Once in a while I enjoy asking what the weather will be, current news etc.   I notice it won't answer certain questions such as "is twitter censoring people" etc.  It protects its own.
1318715914481627137 2020-10-21 08:49:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump DO IT   Let us see the Interview NOW.   We need transparency with the Media.  Americans need to know.
1318705636717162496 2020-10-21 08:08:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JamesOKeefeIII @MarkDice @Google You forgot to mention that Google is spying on us.  If you have a Google Mini be careful.  They say they don't listen but I know they do.
1318683031800926210 2020-10-21 06:38:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump POST IT.   Please post it.
1318682892906553344 2020-10-21 06:37:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Who in your Campaign is advising you?  Why did you even go on that liberal dishonest network this close to election and why are you agreeing to do a debate with a moderator who deleted her twitter account to hide her hateful tweets?
1318681744283873280 2020-10-21 06:33:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> Since Twitter is forcing us to reply when retweeting we should add comments and make sure you copy the person who originally sent the tweet @JackPosobiec  Joe Biden is hiding in his basement.
1318681178753302528 2020-10-21 06:31:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> Repeal Section 230  @ruggiere_l  Social Media and Main stream media are on steroids now interfering with the election.   It is a crime what they are doing.
1318679618409263105 2020-10-21 06:24:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Don't consider posting it, just do it now.
1318679543553564672 2020-10-21 06:24:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Demand kristen welker be removed as moderator on next debate or cancel.  These debates are Total BS and we are sick of this.  Debate Commission is setting you up.   Muting your mic, changing topics to help Biden.   Push back.
1318678811823677440 2020-10-21 06:21:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @AndrewKirell These Democrat blue check marks make me laugh.  So its ok for the Biden Campaign to mask shame all of us but when a Liberal hack "journalist" doesn't wear her mask its just fine.   Democrats are hypocrites!!!!
1318662055969267713 2020-10-21 05:15:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You can never trust the Main stream Media.   Please demand a neutral moderator for this week.   If they can't be fair have a debate with a different network.
1318661027433607168 2020-10-21 05:11:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump The Media hates the American people.  They are dishonest and lazy.  Except for a few outlets.
1318660108885241856 2020-10-21 05:07:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cristinalaila1 @TheDemocrats Yes, get out and vote!  Join the millions who are Walking Away from the Democrat Party.   Vote Trump 2020
1318659198092079104 2020-10-21 05:03:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 @Soh1006 Repeal Section 230
1318557968745533447 2020-10-20 22:21:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JPAlderdice @KamalaHarris @GOP @SpeakerPelosi Democrats are liars
1318557615929102341 2020-10-20 22:20:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton Nancy Pelosi and yourself are the reason why Stimulus checks were not sent out to the American people two months ago.  Stop lying to the American people.  All you do is lie.
1318557214853005312 2020-10-20 22:18:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HillaryClinton You're a communist
1318555766228471814 2020-10-20 22:12:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CNN is Super FAKE news
1318552992350720003 2020-10-20 22:01:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> Unbelievable.  Democrats blaming everything on Russia again and calling us Russian bots.   These people are just sick liars.
1318546005957038080 2020-10-20 21:33:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte They worship abortion and are enemies of God and lack purity.  Purity comes from God.
1318494584196902912 2020-10-20 18:09:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls @GOPChairwoman @GOPoversight @senatemajldr @NRSC @RandPaul @tedcruz @OANN @WestJournalism Maybe he figures it's too late to fire him being two weeks til election however, its not too late to make a very important decision.  Hire someone to finish the job Bill can't do.  At least get a fair moderator in there.  This whole thing stinks.
1318492289472188417 2020-10-20 18:00:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @BillStepien Hey Bill Stepien,  It's not "fine" to agree to send our President into an off the charts unfair debate organized by an illegal "debate committee" who is blatantly discriminating against a candidate and favoring another.   You need to do more than send a letter.
1318491665212977152 2020-10-20 17:58:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @realDonaldTrump @BillStepien He needs to do more than send a letter.
1318491237783982080 2020-10-20 17:56:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Then why are there so many stupid Americans voting for her?  Don't they realize that She's going to push Joe Biden aside and she will be President?  Why are people in this country so stupid?  Or are they all just evil or both?  Democrat party is immoral and they hate God!
1318489946898931715 2020-10-20 17:51:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @KellyannePolls This "Debate Commission" is operating illegally.  Discriminating against a candidate.  Now it changed the topics.  It was suppose to be about foreign policy but the illegal Commission changed it to other topics in order to help Biden escape questions on stealing money from China.
1318488497204834305 2020-10-20 17:45:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity Why aren't the Campaigns negotiating?  Who in the Trump campaign is approving of these debate terms? The Debate "moderators" keep lecturing and saying the campaign approved of the terms.  Mr. President. who is agreeing to this? @realDonaldTrump
1318488009428250629 2020-10-20 17:43:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> Joe Biden is a Criminal.
1318487119589896192 2020-10-20 17:40:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity Communist China is obviously infiltrating this country via the Democrats and Joe Biden.  This only use to happen in Communist China and now our social media, media and now a "debate commission", all run by left government.  Yes, Ran by the state.  Trying to sink us into COMMUNISM
1318486668588904448 2020-10-20 17:38:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @realDonaldTrump Yes, Republicans need to be tougher and fight back.  This Debate is a total fiasco.  President must push back on this.  Have two moderators.  Get another one who is Republican.
1318486104257908741 2020-10-20 17:35:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dbongino @2717PRODUCTIONS God help us!  Pray daily!  It is so sad to know that people in this country can vote for a Politician that lies and supports killing children in the womb.  A party that promotes all immoral acts, hates God.  Democrat Party is pure evil.  Anyone who votes for a Democrat is sick.
1318483561880539136 2020-10-20 17:25:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @suesuesbeo9 @RealEricCarmen The "debate commission" in DC composed of members who hate our President, pretending to be fair but in reality the Debate commission is operating illegally, discriminating against a candidate they don't like.  It's obvious and its disgusting.  Close it down
1318483082849124353 2020-10-20 17:23:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @senatemajldr Don't give the Far left Socialist Democrats time to cause trouble.  Cast the vote tomorrow, latest Wednesday.  The Committee is taking too long.
1318482830700150784 2020-10-20 17:22:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @senatemajldr If you wait until "later this week" you give Democrats time to pull some evil trick out of their hat and it will go over into the weekend giving them more time to have secret dirty meetings on how to smear the Judge.  Then Monday comes accusations and we go on and on.
1318482052816105473 2020-10-20 17:19:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @senatemajldr @becky2923b Later this week??  Do it early this week!  The longer you wait the more time you give to the hateful, slanderous Democrats to cause trouble.   Get it done tomorrow.
1318480196240986114 2020-10-20 17:12:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @realDonaldTrump @VP @GOPoversight @GOPChairwoman @senatemajldr @RNCResearch President Trumps Campaign managers are giving him bad advice and sending him into a totally unfair debate which is a trap to attempt to make him look bad.   At the very least get rid of the biased moderator.  There is no excuse for this
1318479761606201345 2020-10-20 17:10:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is exactly why we need SMALLER GOVERNMENT.  There is an actual "debate commission" that taxpayers pay for and they illegally discriminate against one of the candidates.  They do it openly and obviously.   Close it down!
1318479139913883648 2020-10-20 17:08:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yes Mr. President, the "debate commission" changed all the topics to assist Biden, now they want to mute you on top of the biased moderator who deleted her twitter account to hide her hateful tweets against you.  We deserve better.  At least demand a non biased moderator.
1318477198869766145 2020-10-20 17:00:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LeahR77 @RealityBoost The "debate commission" is running an illegal operations on taxpayer dollars and should be closed down.   @realDonaldTrump  President Trump at the very least should demand a non biased moderator.  His campaign is being weak.  The Biden Campaign asked the commission to mute.
1318476157692514304 2020-10-20 16:56:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealRLimbaugh @realDonaldTrump This coming debate is rigged even more.
1318474933320642560 2020-10-20 16:51:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @becky2923b @ofHolyTrinity @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He has a right to a fair debate.  He can say No to the moderator at the very least.   They just keep changing the rules and topics to help Biden.  It's obvious.  Everyone knows.  He needs to pushback.  We still have two weeks
1318474053343039489 2020-10-20 16:48:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @seanhannity As long as she doesn't run for Congress.
1318473501171347459 2020-10-20 16:45:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @becky2923b @ofHolyTrinity @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Why can't he find another network?  This debate commission needs to be closed down.  They need to face charges for illegally rigging a debate
1318473118902489088 2020-10-20 16:44:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @seanhannity yeah, that's why I unfollowed her.   She use to like everyones tweets.
1318472607428038656 2020-10-20 16:42:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ofHolyTrinity @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yes it is demoralizing.  Are tax dollars paying for this "debate commission"?  It's a fraud and what they are doing is illegal.
1318472352083050496 2020-10-20 16:41:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump The word for Shannon Bream just popped into my head.   She's feckless.  Can't trust her.
1318471964361568256 2020-10-20 16:39:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump I agree. Whoever the campaign managers are now are just in it for the moment.  leading our President into a totally unfair debate put out by a commission illegally rigs a debate for the Democrat party is just disgusting and we should all speak out.  President should say NO
1318471252558835712 2020-10-20 16:36:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump President Trump should replace this debate and demand another network does it.  To heck with the "debate commission" that's run by a bunch of People who hate our President.  It needs to be closed down.  Their discriminatory practices are illegal.
1318470486515314689 2020-10-20 16:33:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump Shannon Bream on her show she said to the campaign manager that we don't know Biden lied.  Does she live on the same planet we do?
1318470173750226945 2020-10-20 16:32:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump President Trump should push back and demand at the very least that they put on a NON BIASED Moderator.  I mean this is just ridiculous. This "debate commission" needs to be shut down.  It's a sham!
1318469178861367298 2020-10-20 16:28:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump His last campaign manager Brad Parscale its a shame had some personal problems.  He was a GOOD AND TOUGH Campaign manager.  Whoever is taking his place is they are weak
1318468658356576256 2020-10-20 16:26:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump So I heard his campaign communications manager say the same words tonight  "its fine"  so they are telling our President "its fine" and making him go into a debate that's set up to make him look bad.  They will mute him and try to make him look bad.
1318468349383225346 2020-10-20 16:25:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump I noticed at the rally today when talking about this coming debate and how bias he said "but thats fine".  He is listening to these weak campaign managers who are not being tough on debate negotiations.   Bidens campaign asked that fake debate commission to mute the mic

1318467390552772608 2020-10-20 16:21:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump I agree.  I think it's a trap!  I tweeted just a little while ago and called out his campaign manager because I think they are advising the President poorly and not fighting for fairness.
1318466796870012930 2020-10-20 16:19:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JeMari81 Next time can you allow us more than 1 word?
1318465650952597505 2020-10-20 16:14:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @seanhannity Yes I think so.  Also made some accusations against Corey Lewendowski before the midterms.
1318464303167459328 2020-10-20 16:09:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @seanhannity She still supports the President.
1318463723141410817 2020-10-20 16:07:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Your campaign communications manager Tim Murtaugh was on Shannon Bream and he said "the debate commission is biased against you and biased in favor of Biden but thats fine"   Changing rules, muting your mic, changing subjects, Anti Trump moderator is NOT fine
1318462671994302465 2020-10-20 16:02:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @seanhannity ahhh I remember now.  Thats why she blocked me!!!!   Thank you for the reminder!!!
1318462518025625600 2020-10-20 16:02:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte President Trump should demand a non biased Moderator.  This bogus debate commission picked a biased Democrat, new mute mic rules, changed all the topics all to help Joe Biden.  It's disgusting and his campaign needs to fight harder for him and make it fair.  @TimMurtaugh
1318460747286867968 2020-10-20 15:55:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @seanhannity She blocked tons of conservatives.  She must have had someone doing that for her.
1318460318348050437 2020-10-20 15:53:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @hawks12thmanfan @ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump @TimMurtaugh Yes, Shannon Bream, Joe Biden did LIE.  He said he knew nothing about his sons Business.   What part of  "I knew nothing" do you not understand Shannon?  It's obvious you are defending Biden and it's sickening!  People still care about Truth and Integrity.  Fox news lost all that
1318459242932707329 2020-10-20 15:49:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @hawks12thmanfan @ShannonBream @realDonaldTrump @TimMurtaugh No Mr. Campaign Manager Tim Murtaugh, it's not fine that the debate commission rigs an unfair debate and changes the topics to favor biden 5 days before the debate.  No, its not ok to add a mute button.  Changing rules to help Biden is not ok.  Cancel debate or demand Fairness
1318458471424032768 2020-10-20 15:46:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @hawks12thmanfan On @ShannonBream  Trumps Campaign communication Manager said "We know the debate commission is biased against the president,biased in favor of Biden but THAT'S FINE"  Are they advising our President it's fine?  Seriously? I'ts fine?  Why is it fine? @realDonaldTrump @TimMurtaugh
1318429382663286784 2020-10-20 13:50:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ThatIsNotMyD0G @RealJamesWoods FBI should investigate him but unfortunately they are just as corrupt.
1318428171574849536 2020-10-20 13:45:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ThatIsNotMyD0G @RealJamesWoods Better to come out to the authorities and the press and reveal the truth and ask for protection rather than destroy the country.
1318426845482688512 2020-10-20 13:40:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice @benshapiro Why are you two going at it?

1318418252846882817 2020-10-20 13:06:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JanelleCantre12 A mute button along with a radical left wing Democrat moderator.   It's out of control.
1318418121787543553 2020-10-20 13:05:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MAGAshop2020 NO, FBI is worthless!    I guess they use to be good in the 60s, 70s, 80s
1318417083554656256 2020-10-20 13:01:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JanelleCantre12 Yes, they now want to censor the president.   The Tyranny never ends.  President Trump should demand a neutral moderator and no mute button.
1318404256630673410 2020-10-20 12:10:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> President should insist on a neutral moderator.   She should NOT be the moderator.  And now the commission just made a new rule requested by Biden for a mute button.  @realDonaldTrump   President Trump needs to say NO to this rigged debate.
1318394560070909953 2020-10-20 11:32:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why is President Trumps Campaign managers agreeing to these totally unfair debate terms?   @realDonaldTrump  President should DEMAND a neutral moderator.  This is absurd!

1318389446266421248 2020-10-20 11:11:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalGOPJew @laralogan @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, please demand a neutral moderator.  Don't do this to yourself.  Your campaign manager is not doing his job to allow this.
1318388549486456833 2020-10-20 11:08:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> All the more reason for @realDonaldTrump President Trump to insist on a neutral moderator.   His Campaign managers should say NO to this moderator.   Totally UNFAIR
1318388162096328706 2020-10-20 11:06:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dbongino President should demand a neutral moderator.  The Trump Campaign is being too weak.
1318387868222410752 2020-10-20 11:05:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr Who on the Campaign is negotiating debate terms?  Why can't the President bypass this debate commission and go on another network?  Now the Biden team asked for and received a rule change to mute the President.
1318385737771880449 2020-10-20 10:57:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @shawnr2121 @DrMartyFox @realDonaldTrump President Trump should find another network willing to do the debates fairly.  This is total BS and his campaign should be tougher.   https://t.co/1cYBrky41j
1318383830395281408 2020-10-20 10:49:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> Mr. President, why are your campaign managers being so weak when making debate terms?  Biden's campaign asked for the Mute button to silence you and make you look bad.  @realDonaldTrump  Dump this next debate moderator and find another network.
1318376226587770881 2020-10-20 10:19:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoVotes45 @marklevinshow All those ballots should be inspected.  They are most likely going to be Counterfeit ballots.

1318375368781299713 2020-10-20 10:15:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DeAnna4Congress @realDonaldTrump  Twitter is on a rampage suspending/censoring spree on steroids.  Twitter is interfering in a United States Presidential Election.   Repeal Section 230
1318372810541076480 2020-10-20 10:05:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is exactly what happened:  Joe Biden is hiding!
1318368156407062528 2020-10-20 09:47:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Demand a new moderator and do not allow moderator to mute your microphone.  Debate Commission is trying to help the Democrats and is biased, making new rules few days before debate. Pick another network and bypass the debate commission
1318356947700101120 2020-10-20 09:02:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> Isn't that racism?  Favoring one race over the other? How can that even be legal?

1318335745359179776 2020-10-20 07:38:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> If Biden/Harris cheat their way into power in November and take away your constitution, shut down America, Shut down freedom of religion, what do you think will happen?

1318331431278366720 2020-10-20 07:21:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile @SenSchumer  Does this mean Senator Schumer is resigning? A Senator is now allowed dereliction of duty!  Which Democrat is replacing him?   Senate works for the people.

1318328960145477633 2020-10-20 07:11:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RevPatriot17 If Biden drops out, Kamala Harris will take his place for President and she will chose Hillary Clinton for VP.

1318325262296117248 2020-10-20 06:56:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We need to fight for constitution!  No Judges can rewrite our constitution. The US Supreme courts cowardly Justice Roberts voted with the communists to shut down our churches. This is a violation of our constitutional rights. Military needs to defend our rights. they took an oath

1318323707450806272 2020-10-20 06:50:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @drdavidsamadi @Matthew_4_Trump Social Media should be sued for censoring Doctors.  Who do they think they are?  Twitter/Facebook are not Doctors.  They have no License to practice yet they are doing it on their "platforms" Repeal Section 230
1318323424444362752 2020-10-20 06:49:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump If I get Covid I will just take Hydroxychloroquine with vitamin D.   It's saving lives and weve seen hundreds of Doctors and patients testimonials.
1318322976584998915 2020-10-20 06:47:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump There should be a law that mandates if a celebrity says they will leave they must keep their promise.   Otherwise they are merely interfering in our elections by threatening their mindless fans.
1318322520257261569 2020-10-20 06:45:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The only way to regain our freedom is by voting for President Trump.     We are not voting for a Pope or a preacher we are voting for a President.
1318321987375149062 2020-10-20 06:43:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The CDC is corrupt to the core.  Dr. Fauci is lying to America
1318321816113311744 2020-10-20 06:43:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Sparty80GoGreen @Matthew_4_Trump Yes he is. The Democrat Party Politicians are possessed by Satan and his demons.   Democrat socialist communist party is the party of Satan!  Don't forget that.
1318321444900737024 2020-10-20 06:41:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump If Joe Biden is elected President he will close down the entire country during a 98.9% Survival rate "pandemic"  If you own a business you can say goodbye to it and if you planned on opening your dream business you can throw that dream in the trash.
1318321009011773440 2020-10-20 06:39:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump How does a pandemic have a 98.9% survival rate? I don't think any other Pandemic in world history has had a 98.9% Survival rate.   🤔
1318320481938808833 2020-10-20 06:37:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Maybe it will take losing their homes and constitutional rights and putting them on Trains while wearing their masks?  All to stop the spread?
1318319583523082240 2020-10-20 06:34:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They (Democrat Socialist Politicians) including Dr. Fauci are using Covid-19 as a scare tactic in order to destroy our churches and cause division.  Not even a Judge on the US Supreme Court can rewrite our constitution.  Freedom OF religion means not closing our churches.

1318313606845362176 2020-10-20 06:10:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump According to Democrat "science" Covid turned into the flu.
1318313444030902272 2020-10-20 06:09:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NYACC1978 @Matthew_4_Trump The Hypocrite Democrats are NOT listening to the science.  Twitter/Facebook/Youtube are censoring 1000s of Doctors and even Immunologists from telling us mask and social distancing is a political stunt.
1318313070704291840 2020-10-20 06:08:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I've never had a flu shot and I'm not getting a Covid Flu shot.  I've only worn a mask when I absolutely had to in order not to get kicked out of somewhere. Forcing me to get a shot.......That's where I draw the line.  NO NO NO
1318312625873117184 2020-10-20 06:06:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We know masks don't work against Viruses.   It's all for show and power.

1318300465457606657 2020-10-20 05:18:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr @BreitbartNews  Breitbart headlines read  "Joe Biden’s Transition Co-Chair Hosted Hunter Biden-Linked Chinese Elites at Obama White House" They need clearer, stronger headlines.  This headline means what?
1318294631495258112 2020-10-20 04:55:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @joecollins43rd @MaxineWaters It is so refreshing to see someone run against Maxine Waters who actually cares about the citizens who live there.

1318291235895832576 2020-10-20 04:41:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto Trump campaign needs to stop asking and start telling.  Why did the Campaign manager agree to all these Liberal Moderators????

1318258326979801089 2020-10-20 02:30:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump President Trumps campaign is not negotiating well on debate terms.   Why are all the moderators Democrats?   They should demand a new moderator for this coming debate because she is a liberal and she deleted anti Trump post on Twitter to hide her bias.

They already had them come to congress just recently and they lied to congress.   You're right we need action now not talk and more threats.

1318128229341827072 2020-10-19 17:53:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> Everyone retweet this, email and text  it to your family and friends.

1318126568644898817 2020-10-19 17:47:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray Us regular Conserv folks without blue check marks have been suspended, censored regularly and we have been screaming about it to congress for YEARS.  I remember since 2010 and nothing done.  Now they are doing it to bigger accounts due to election.   Truly election interference.

1318106577853845506 2020-10-19 16:27:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RBReich Stop spreading lies.  The Democrat Party is the party of lies and racism and the world knows it now.  Only evil people vote for Democrats.

After wearing a mask for 5 minutes I have to pull it down to breathe.  Breathing Carbon dioxide every day can't be good for the human body.
1318103032656130049 2020-10-19 16:13:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @drdavidsamadi @EvaLB5 People are breathing their own Carbon dioxide.   That can't be healthy for the body.   I'm very healthy but after wearing a mask over my face for 10 minutes I need to pull it down to breathe.   People wearing masks for long periods of time have to be abusing their bodies.
1318100851706138625 2020-10-19 16:05:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @chanchan73 @thehill LOL   How old are you?  Are you a baby?  The polls are total BS.  Same polls said the same thing in 2016.  Can you remember that long ago.   Polls mean absolutely nothing.
1318100410846990337 2020-10-19 16:03:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @StateofusAll @eyesoftheirish1 Yes, Joe Biden used his son to steal money from China and Russia to enrich the family.  We need to find out what secrets Joe Biden gave to China and what financial transactions occurred.  Joe Biden's checking, savings accounts must be audited going back the last 10 years.

1318098101484150786 2020-10-19 15:54:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @100Trump45 Yes, increase in helicopters also however these are small drones and not the kind you can buy at an electronic store.   They are apparently very fast and if lose control or drop to the ground they self destruct.

1318093160904421376 2020-10-19 15:34:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> Has anyone else seen small drones flying around in Southern California?  Reportedly flying by windows over sidewalks and flashing lights (taking photos/recordings?)  Rumor has it Gavin Newsom is behind this to spy on us.

In 2016 the Democrats cheated with ballot harvesting, duplicate ballots, counterfeit ballots etc.   We need to be vigilant this year and catch the Democrats cheating and report them to the authorities asap.

1317376362022252544 2020-10-17 16:06:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Sob916 Our FBI is Corrupt, worthless!
1317375798995681284 2020-10-17 16:04:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pittman_george @lanaurey Twitter is still blocking the NY Post and has not unlocked their account.  It looks like Twitter is just asking for Lawsuits!
1317374182129242114 2020-10-17 15:57:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> Regarding Law and Order.  When President Trump is re elected who should he fire in January?
1317369784061763585 2020-10-17 15:40:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jeepen_LewisE @wendyp4545 Covid-19 exposed Democrat Governors across the nation that they are Power hungry, narcissist dictators.  In other countries dictators take away freedom and it gets worse from there.  Socialism, communism, death camps.. Democrat Governors are Dangerous.

Joe Biden did not want President Trump to stop China from traveling into our country.  President Trump saved lives.
1317367727904845825 2020-10-17 15:31:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SavannahGuthrie President Trump has millions of black supporters and he meets with them regularly.  For you @NBCNews to accuse him of racism is disgusting.  You people are the real racists.

1317320386925588488 2020-10-17 12:23:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pstjeffanderson @GKeile We need to continue to encourage all to vote for Trump and not be complacent.   The Biden Campaign Democrats could be trying to trick us by having few people show up.  Trying to get us to be complacent.
1317319916739907584 2020-10-17 12:21:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Why aren't they asking Joe Biden if he has denounced his racist ties to KKK?   Joe biden has constantly made racist remarks.

1317313979853594624 2020-10-17 11:58:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @NBCNewsPR @SavannahGuthrie @NBCNews NBC producers obviously put her up to that or she would be fired for her obnoxious behavior.  American public are disgusted with the Media.  2 friends told me they have relatives who are Democrats but because of the last two moderators they are voting for President Trump.
1317313388465172480 2020-10-17 11:56:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @NBCNewsPR @SavannahGuthrie @NBCNews @realDonaldTrump   No more moderators unless it is a conservative.   Mr. President.  Talk to your campaign manager and ask why your campaign is agreeing to these terms?   Go do a debate on @OANN One America News and choose a conservative moderator.
1317311729223618561 2020-10-17 11:49:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @NBCNewsPR @SavannahGuthrie @NBCNews Between her and liberal Chris Wallace they proved indeed that the Media is the enemy of the people.    The hatred and bias she showed was through the roof.  She was disrespectful to our President and her producers encouraged her to do this.  Americans see this and will vote Trump
1317310699060654081 2020-10-17 11:45:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump President Trumps campaign manager should not agree to these kind of debate or town hall terms.   Next Moderator must make an announcement at beginning and state that they will not debate the candidate.
1317302381176971264 2020-10-17 11:12:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @eric_lombrozo @jack @Twitter 1996 Congress gave them section 230 protection so as to allow public platforms to allow people to speak freely and the platform company not be liable.  Since Twitter is now censoring and acting as a publisher they disqualify themselves for section 230 protection.
1317300151904432130 2020-10-17 11:03:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SrFezza @jack No, its still blocked

They called Jack in just a while ago and he lied and we had to watch communist senators praise twitter.  It was sickening to watch.
1317299052732502017 2020-10-17 10:59:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @jack He will just lie again before Congress. That's why he's rushing to change policy again.  He did that last time when he was shadow banning everyone.  Then he told congress it was a gliche and fixed.  He's doing the same thing now.   Passive aggressive
1317298730165440513 2020-10-17 10:57:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JamesDoss50 @jack Twitter has done the same thing to me.  Also I was suspended for 7 days because I criticized the AG for not indicting.   They said my tweet was hate speech.   Can you believe that bs?  That's why they censor conservatives
1317298326534942720 2020-10-17 10:56:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MinimalLifist @MarkDice @jack If they want to keep their section 230 protection they need to stop censoring and allow everyone to speak freely, not just leftist Democrat Communists.  They have suspended one blue check conservative after another on here yet he lies and says they don't censor conservatives.
1317297893712175105 2020-10-17 10:54:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Rockprincess818 @jack He's trying to put it back into the bottle.  He did not think there would be huge backlash and they probably thought they could block the story and not get caught.  That's how bold they have gotten.
1317297665617453058 2020-10-17 10:53:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Rockprincess818 @jack He is only changing their policy because they are being called into Congress and he needs to be able to con them again.  He did this last time after shadow banning everyone then change the policy formula right before being called into Congress.
1317293980325797888 2020-10-17 10:38:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealRLimbaugh @realDonaldTrump Joe Biden and the Democrat party will destroy Social Security.

1317290432867397632 2020-10-17 10:24:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr Now we know why Joe Biden criticized our President when he stopped travel to US from China to protect Americans from the China Virus.   Joe Biden wanted China to spread the disease
1317269219176632321 2020-10-17 09:00:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thebradfordfile @matt112158 The entire world now knows the Media covers up for Crooked Democrat Politicians.  Not one mention of the Hunter/Biden Scandal released by the NY Post.   World knows Media is fake news @abcnews @CBSNews @NBCNews @nytimes @MSNBC
1317264805686771713 2020-10-17 08:42:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi Children are going hungry because Nancy Pelosi refused to take President's offer to send out stimulus checks to the American people.  It would have taken one day to do this but she refused to have a separate transaction.  She wants your children to go hungry.
1317249910903771136 2020-10-17 07:43:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi Nancy Pelosi refused to pass a stimulus package to help the American people.   Nancy Pelosi even stopped the President from sending a stand alone bill to allow a stimulus check to go out separately from the bill.    Americans have lost their homes because of Nancy Pelosi.
1317245401334870017 2020-10-17 07:25:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  The Far left Liberal Democrat Communist Party is obsessed with Masks.   If they take power you will be wearing a masks every year when the Flu Season breaks out.     The Democrat Party will shut down your business any time they want.  Flu will be their excuse!
1317244704283529218 2020-10-17 07:23:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  A free country does not lock down healthy citizens.  A free country does not allow a ruling group (Democrat Party) to dictate how Americans live.  End the Lockdowns They are unconstitutional and the Tyranny from the LEFT DEMOCRAT PARTY must stop
1317236447586312192 2020-10-17 06:50:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  If you vote for Joe Biden and you have a business you are a complete fool for voting for him.  Democrats will shut down your business when the next Flu season comes along.    Even if there is a 99% survival rate for a virus they will close you down.
1317235406304284673 2020-10-17 06:46:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 When is the next rally?  I hear our energized President is doing lots of them while Biden takes basement breaks. Is there another rally this afternoon?
1317179813086470144 2020-10-17 03:05:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Therese38538165 Yes, they are enemies of God
1317179694563745792 2020-10-17 03:04:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Therese38538165 Yes it is.  I wonder where the Democrats meet at night to practice their demonic satanic worship rituals?
1317178812619108354 2020-10-17 03:01:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACampaNajjar @DarrellIssa @JohnKasich @Schwarzenegger You are airing blatant dishonest advertisements against Darrell Isa regarding his business.  PPP was legitimate. He did nothing wrong.     We won't vote for you because you are lying.   We need honest people in Washington and you are a dishonest puppet for Nancy Pelosi.

1317032572786855936 2020-10-16 17:20:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ik1tt3n If they think they can kill human children in the womb and and get away with it by blurting out at the last minute "im sorry".  No, it does not work that way.  It's called presumption.
1317030478763880451 2020-10-16 17:11:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> The worse sin that can be committed is abortion.  God will not tolerate it.
1317030139465584640 2020-10-16 17:10:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> Our lives are short on earth but eternity is forever.  If you support abortion you are supporting the legalization of murder.  If you support abortion and vote for Politicians who legalize and support abortion you are choosing a life of eternity in Hell.
1317029564992819201 2020-10-16 17:08:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> Abortion is murder.    Democrat Party is focused on promoting abortion all the way to when the baby is being born and trying to come out of the womb.   If you support abortion you are an evil person.  If you vote for a Democrat you support abortion and you are guilty.
1317028959297576960 2020-10-16 17:05:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr I don't find her attractive at all.
1317028350238445568 2020-10-16 17:03:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 All the Democrat Party cares about is being able to kill children in the womb and now all the way until 9 months before birth and even after the baby is born.   Any human being that supports this is a murderer.
1317027401340080129 2020-10-16 16:59:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BatholithLivin @AntonioSabatoJr She truly is evil.  All liberals who support, promote abortion are evil and they are probably possessed by demons.  That moderator appeared possessed to some degree.
1317026735112613889 2020-10-16 16:56:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 Next debate the moderator must make announcement that he/she will NOT debate the candidates and if he does they don't have to answer.  Make the announcement on live TV before debate starts. Trump campaign must stop accepting unfair, biased debate terms. @realDonaldTrump
1317026109037318144 2020-10-16 16:54:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 The wrath of God has been held off by those who pray and fight this evil.  A day will arrive when Gods wrath will come and just as Jesus said people will be asking the mountains to fall on them.  President Trump was an answer to prayer.  If Trump does not win Gods wrath comes.
1317022134904836096 2020-10-16 16:38:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> Abortion is murder.  Politicians who promote, legalize abortion of God's human children in the womb will go to hell.    People who vote for Democrats and support the Democrat party are also supporting Abortion and will face Gods wrath on judgement day.    You are bad people.
1317020579057160192 2020-10-16 16:32:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @joelockhart You owe a lot of people an apology sir.

1316953291545247749 2020-10-16 12:05:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump @GOP congress has allowed this to go on for years.  We the people have been warning you about Twitter and facebook and asking you to do something about Section 230.  You guys ignored it and let the problem get bigger.  You need to just close them down.
1316952202473312259 2020-10-16 12:00:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump President Trump needs to send military out to every voting location in the country.  No more messing around with these people who threaten violence.  Arrest them and  stop letting them out of jail.
1316949862882136069 2020-10-16 11:51:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarianDClough Yes, google is a huge monopoly and a threat to freedom.  Google works with Communist countries to censor their citizens.  If Twitter, facebook cannot let everyone speak freely then our government should close them down. No censoring.
1316948940424609793 2020-10-16 11:47:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @angelzplay @MarianDClough Im on Parler. it is slow and somewhat clumsy.   I sent a few hello messages and nobody even responded.  It needs more work.  It's a shame some billionaires are not investing in making it better but for now its best alternative to twitter. Google can close down gab not sure parler

1316928576793563138 2020-10-16 10:26:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DC_Draino Which is why you need to not rush into marriage and date and get to know who you are marrying!
1316921855392030720 2020-10-16 10:00:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SexCounseling She lost the debate.

1316904783035437057 2020-10-16 08:52:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle This moderator keeps trying to trick President into saying something.
1316903643547865088 2020-10-16 08:47:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle President should stop answering her questions and tell her he's not going to debate her.
1316903387334643712 2020-10-16 08:46:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle I was thinking the same thing.  so unfair!
1316903176390516737 2020-10-16 08:45:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> This "moderator" is a joke.   Will she ask Biden tough questions?  who else has had enough of media being totally biased and unfair???
1316899943286628352 2020-10-16 08:33:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal Nothing to see here — yet From likes to Retweets and a whole lot more, this is where all the action happens.
1316899823459602432 2020-10-16 08:32:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal When I look it says: "nothing to see here"
1316896770618650624 2020-10-16 08:20:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why is she debating the president?  Is she running for office?
1316896017233506306 2020-10-16 08:17:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden You are so dishonest!   You wanted President Trump to continue to allow China to travel into the US and infect us.  He closed travel down and you protested.

1316894129507323904 2020-10-16 08:10:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SexCounseling Censorship, but of course they will call it a Technical difficulty.

1316850621337591808 2020-10-16 05:17:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SenTedCruz @Dancelo25230715 With all due respect sir,  You have already Subpoenaed them in recent past.  They lied to you.    Just draft a bill and repeal their section 230 legal protections.  Anything else you do is just for show.
1316848718948122624 2020-10-16 05:09:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1RedPatriot @AjitPaiFCC @FCC Is he a Democrat?
1316848608650485760 2020-10-16 05:09:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1RedPatriot @AjitPaiFCC @FCC You are correct.  We can't trust him.  He's just now showing himself in order to save his job.   Facebook, Twitter have been violating laws for several years.
1316843743526354945 2020-10-16 04:49:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump
1316842721848422400 2020-10-16 04:45:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AjitPaiFCC @FCC You should recuse yourself for not doing anything about this years ago.
1316841109994180608 2020-10-16 04:39:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AjitPaiFCC @FCC How long have you had your job?  Why should we trust you when you've allowed Twitter and Facebook to violate the laws for over 10 years.  Where were you?  Who suddenly makes you the King?
1316840747119730689 2020-10-16 04:37:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AjitPaiFCC @FCC Twitter is no longer a Public Platform.   People are not allowed to speak freely unless we are Democrats.   Twitter is a publisher.
1316838977354133504 2020-10-16 04:30:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kilroyjc @prageru @AjitPaiFCC @FCC Yes it is but @AjitPaiFCC thinks he can interpret what it is in order to assist big tech.    That's not his job.   REPEAL SECTION 230
1316837138218938368 2020-10-16 04:23:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> Is this guy @AjitPaiFCC a Judge?   Why does he clarify what Section 230 means? @realDonaldTrump  We know what section 230 is.  It was created to allow people to freely speak on Public Platforms for Non Publishers Platform.
1316836537095516160 2020-10-16 04:21:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @prageru @AjitPaiFCC @FCC I dont understand why Ajit Pai thinks he has the power to interpret a law passed by congress in 1996  We know section 230 was passed in order to allow freedom of speech on internet sites for non publishers.  It was passed to assist platforms such as AOL, compuserve. Repeal it
1316835676785045504 2020-10-16 04:17:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sandyleevincent @realDonaldTrump @AjitPaiFCC Why are you saying you need to interpret Section 230?  We need to repeal it completely.  We know what it is.  When internet started Congress gave internet public platforms protections if they allowed FREE SPEECH.  THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING FREE SPEECH REPEAL SECTION 230

1316680975493939201 2020-10-15 18:03:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DawgMamaFl @JasonMillerinDC @nypost I feel the same way.   You have to be either evil or just stupid to vote for Biden
1316680356498599937 2020-10-15 18:00:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO @warmerdaze Repeal Section 230.  Make Twitter a Publisher and remove their legal protections.
1316679178205323264 2020-10-15 17:55:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DawgMamaFl @JasonMillerinDC @nypost Yes, anyone who can vote for him is a Traitor.  I agree.

1316669846180917250 2020-10-15 17:18:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @laralogan I remember when it happened in 1996 and Internet was new and AOL was glad that congress created section 230 so people could SPEAK FREELY on AOL and other Public Platforms.  If Facebook, Twitter won't let us speak then they can't have platform section 230 protection.
1316666120019931138 2020-10-15 17:04:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MZHemingway Our Congress needs to Repeal Section 230.  Make them Publishers.  They can't be both.   https://t.co/anBiN89nCQ
1316665776636481536 2020-10-15 17:02:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @80sMetalGaga @BuzzPatterson Time for them to be straight forward, do their jobs and get this country back to the American people from the Socialist Communists.  We don't have time for their games any longer.  Especially our DOJ not indicting anyone!!
1316664924832100353 2020-10-15 16:59:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @80sMetalGaga @BuzzPatterson Confirm her already!  So sick of seeing these circuses. She's more than qualified.  They need to confirm her and get to work doing other things.
1316664572913180674 2020-10-15 16:57:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> A liberal is saying this:
1316663654020857857 2020-10-15 16:54:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @80sMetalGaga @BuzzPatterson Yeah, they are clowns.
1316663491277668352 2020-10-15 16:53:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @80sMetalGaga @BuzzPatterson There is a difference between knowing (understanding the constitution) and memorizing it.   He was stupid to ask her.  Like he's giving her a quiz?  She should ask him a question regarding the senate.  I'd love to see him get quizzed off guard.
1316662856218107904 2020-10-15 16:51:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @80sMetalGaga @BuzzPatterson Why was he asking her that question?  Only see this clip.   She did a pretty good job answering his question.  Petitioning....  she knew it.    He had to look it up before he asked her.
1316660370820325377 2020-10-15 16:41:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dpudvay @luvmytude @ronfromsandiego @RepMattGaetz I remember in 1996 when AOL was in need of Section 230.  Congress created a bipartisan bill section 230 to protect public platforms from being sued if they allowed freedom of speech.  Repeal their section 230 and problem is solved. The "private company" can be a publisher.
1316659624980869125 2020-10-15 16:38:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> Here is the answer.   I remember in 1996 when AOL was in need of Section 230.  Congress created a bipartisan bill section 230 to protect public platforms from being sued if they allowed freedom of speech.   https://t.co/anBiN89nCQ We need to repeal their section 230
1316658897260695555 2020-10-15 16:35:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dpudvay @luvmytude @ronfromsandiego @RepMattGaetz You are uninformed.  Twitter is NOT a Publisher.  It is a Public Platform.  It does not matter if they are a "private company" In 1996 congress gave them section 230 protection as a platform to give people freedom of speech.  https://t.co/anBiN89nCQ
1316656265192370177 2020-10-15 16:24:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @luvmytude @ronfromsandiego @RepMattGaetz If the "PRIVATE COMPANIES" claim they are a public platform but deny a huge population of our country the freedom to speak while allowing the other side to speak then we revoke their section 230 and we can sue them.  Let them be "private"
1316655897473552384 2020-10-15 16:23:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @luvmytude @ronfromsandiego @RepMattGaetz These "private companies" are not private.  They also go into Communist China and other countries and work with communist to censor the citizens who are living in Tyranny.   Read up on what Section 230 is.  It is a protection for these "private companies" for allowing free speech
1316653894584262656 2020-10-15 16:15:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ronfromsandiego @luvmytude @RepMattGaetz It's not a private company. They are controlled by the communist Democrat Politicians.  It is also publicly owned and it is a monopoly It is a huge Anti American conglomerate and it now controls the public square.  This is the digital age.  Let everyone speak or close it down.
1316651633057566720 2020-10-15 16:06:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RepMattGaetz How about Congress draft a Bill and take away their section 230 protection.  That's your job right?
1316650003805339648 2020-10-15 15:59:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BuzzPatterson The Democrat Communist Party basically owns Twitter and Facebook and our Main stream Media so really our Media and Press is run by Communist Government.
1316648854813515777 2020-10-15 15:55:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BuzzPatterson We the little people on Social Media have been screaming at the top of our lungs to our  Republican Congressmen/senators, telling them we are all being suspended, censored.  It's been going on since 2010 on Twitter.
1316648510859608064 2020-10-15 15:54:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BuzzPatterson They are going after Christians and our churches too.  Twitter would love to be able ban any mention of God.
1316641836111290368 2020-10-15 15:27:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> We have been screaming at the top of our lungs to congress and the President for years telling them that we the little guys are getting suspended, censored on a daily basis and its been going on for years.  Now Government is just finding out about it.   @realDonaldTrump
1316641137025712128 2020-10-15 15:24:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PressSec @Twitter They are communists.  Twitter works with Communist China to censor their citizens.  Google does the same thing.
1316587275191349248 2020-10-15 11:50:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton I'm seeing my family this Thanksgiving.  We've had enough of communist dictators telling us how to breathe.
1316579716120207360 2020-10-15 11:20:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonaldJTrumpJr @Just4RealGirls Why has congress allowed Facebook/Twitter, Google to advance communist Governments and silence American Citizens?  They have gotten too big!  Dangerous!
1316577635451858945 2020-10-15 11:12:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jack @RubinReport @nypost Trump supporters are suspended daily and the reason from twitter is that our beliefs are Hate Speech.  If you want to appeal you are locked out for months. According to twitter supporting the United States President is hate speech.
1316575567790006272 2020-10-15 11:04:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jack @RubinReport @nypost Not true.

1316546839919751168 2020-10-15 09:10:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LorraineHirsch @drdavidsamadi Wrong!  Social media is the new Public square and if they allow communists liberals to speak they have to allow all.    Your excuse is not legitimate in the digital age year 2020
1316545814139822081 2020-10-15 09:05:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @paphotog @drdavidsamadi Repeal Section 230 immediately  @realDonaldTrump

1316527997302833156 2020-10-15 07:55:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile Again?  Twitter is definitely interfering with United States election.

1316491029437063168 2020-10-15 05:28:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr President needs to do something about all this Censoring, suspending on social media sites right before the election.  Election interference is from US Social media sites not Russia.
1316490327008505857 2020-10-15 05:25:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GKeile I have been tweeting over a year that this would happen before the election.  Twitter, facebook, google will censor and suspend non stop.   President Trump should do something.  This is illegal.  Russia is not interfering in our elections, Facebook, twitter and google are.
1316320945464721408 2020-10-14 18:12:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thedailybeast She also explained that she is refusing to send Americans any Stimulus because she does not want to help Trump with the Economy.    So she wants to make the economy worse.
1316320349345050624 2020-10-14 18:10:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @washingtonpost @wolfblitzer did a great job asking her the questions that Journalist should ask and she was terrible with her answers. American people are hurting and she refuses to approve even a stand alone stimulus check.  She said she's refusing because it will help Trump with Economy.
1316314785256886272 2020-10-14 17:47:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @trish_regan The President even tried to make it easy and told her if Congress cant agree on a complete relief bill they can send him a (stand alone) Stimulus bill and that way a check could go out to the American people.  This can be done quickly.  She still refused.  Shame on her.
1316314053136904192 2020-10-14 17:45:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BRoss7547 @JWDowning1980 @SpeakerPelosi She's terrible!

The President even said if they cant work out a deal to just send him a (stand alone bill) for just the stimulus check to go out to the American people which could be done in one hour but she refused.

People in this country are hurting and need that stimulus and she refuses to help.  It's not her money.  Pelosi is helping her party lose in November.  American people won't forget this when they go vote.  They will vote Dems out.
1316305605041156096 2020-10-14 17:11:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Zack_TLO @wolfblitzer Has Nancy Pelosi even actually ever debated someone?   I'd love to see someone debate her.  She wouldn't be able to handle it.

She's feeding herself 14.00 ice creams bars from her $40,000 refrigerator in her huge mansion while she refuses to send Americans their 2nd stimulus check.  She's a greedy selfish creep.
1316301266121715714 2020-10-14 16:54:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SaraBellLv @duartecomacho @SpeakerPelosi What is he talking about?

1316235210439094272 2020-10-14 12:31:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  @TheDemocrats  The Democrats don't want you to feed your families or pay your bills.  They are super quick and eager to make you lose your jobs/business in the name of Covid and when it comes time to help you they refuse.    Democrats are cold, selfish and cruel
1316232385944457217 2020-10-14 12:20:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> Watch the full interview.  It's even better
1316232161712771072 2020-10-14 12:19:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @thebradfordfile We need to see more people challenging her.  Why aren't there reporters asking her these questions?    Is she invisible?
1316231914232049664 2020-10-14 12:18:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckCallesto Can the House and Senate declare her unfit for office and pass the stimulus bill?
1316231531325607938 2020-10-14 12:17:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Ingalan6 @vjbrooks12 We don't need to worry about Fake Polls.  Nancy pelosi is the true poll that proves Democrats are going to lose in a landslide.
1316230217753485312 2020-10-14 12:11:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi  A week ago President Trump asked you to send a stand alone bill allowing Stimulus checks to go out to the American people and you refused that too.   You just want the American people to starve.  You are starving children causing people to suffer.
1316228568687370242 2020-10-14 12:05:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> Democrat Party is going to lose more and more voters because Pelosi is starving Americans and denying them relief  President Trump offered for them to send him a stand alone bill in meantime for Stimulus check and she refused that too.  Stop voting for Democrats!
1316227686545514497 2020-10-14 12:01:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellyannePolls @wolfblitzer @Mediaite @SpeakerPelosi  She does not care about her constituents.  They are homeless and now she wants all of America to be homeless and go hungry because she would not even pass a stand alone stimulus check the president offered.   Pelosi and the Democrats are losing voters daily.
1316227159283789824 2020-10-14 11:59:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonnaStua1 @ErrolWebber She's a horrible, horrible person.  She keeps saying she cares about her constituents.  Sure, maybe her friends in San Francisco but she is PURPOSELY Letting Americans suffer.  Each day gets worse for them.    She's just evil
1316226232229359618 2020-10-14 11:56:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @barnabus65  This shows the entire embarrassing interview.  She just lost it so many times.

1316223856210714624 2020-10-14 11:46:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> How embarrassing.  Biden's campaign manager is ignorant and doesn't know what the Constitution says.

1316142455276793856 2020-10-14 06:23:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @arelab13 @MortweetsC @CBSNews Yes she was prepared and you're not suppose to go into an interview with notes and you're not suppose to be looking at your resume.  If you are doing that it could be why you never heard back.

1316135001839165440 2020-10-14 05:53:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Because Americans who vote for Democrats are immoral baseless people.
1316129935879143424 2020-10-14 05:33:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @w_terrence @realDonaldTrump Media is creating fake polls to entice donors to give money to Biden's Campaign.

1316113239004966912 2020-10-14 04:27:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AngelWarrior321 Republicans in Senate need to wrap these "hearings" up and  just vote her in.   All Democrats want to do is attack and slander in order to stall.
1316104227693846528 2020-10-14 03:51:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman @GOP @GOPLeader  Republicans campaigning November need to speak out and tell Americans that when they win House/Senate they will immediately pass a stand alone bill for a Stimulus check to go out to the American people.
1316102498688495616 2020-10-14 03:44:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Just about all of the Democrat Politicians are Segregationists.

1316093098326327299 2020-10-14 03:07:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SenSanders We are not in the middle of a pandemic.  We are at the ending stages.  You just want Covid to go on forever.
1315967505886662657 2020-10-13 18:47:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump What happened to your request for them to send a stand alone bill only for Stimulus checks?  Pelosi refuses to do anything.  Americans are hurting and need relief. How hard is it to send out checks?  System is already in place. They can't walk and chew gum and the same time?

1315940949634158594 2020-10-13 17:02:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr Absolutely correct!  After what they did in Benghazi blaming it on a video,  spying on Americans, President Trump, Russia Hoax.  It never stops.  How can we believe anything coming form those liars!
1315940236313018369 2020-10-13 16:59:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> So now Democrat Party is advocating to take away Social Security.   Really scary!   Get the word out please.   Vote Republican in November
1315939661701734400 2020-10-13 16:57:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr Can we believe anything that Administration told us?
1315938241552347136 2020-10-13 16:51:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Do billboards!
1315938051948830720 2020-10-13 16:50:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump And the polls keep lying in order to get donors to give money to Joe Biden's campaign.  They did the same thing in 2016.  That's why you can't trust polls today.
1315937742782521345 2020-10-13 16:49:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> And President Trump has been saying this all along.  It's the power hungry Democrats who want to close our country down and destroy peoples lives.
1315936882862166016 2020-10-13 16:46:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> The CDC @CDCgov  Is playing politics.

1315841600115798016 2020-10-13 10:27:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> The CDC @CDCgov  has spoken to the American people through the voice of Dr. Fauci and has proved to us that we cannot trust the political organization CDC.   It is a political organization.
1315841168274407424 2020-10-13 10:25:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CDCgov  Why is Dr. Fauci parading around the country going on liberal Trump hating News shows and talk shows?  Why is Dr. Fauci lying and saying he is not a political person while at the same time he disrespects our President.  Why did the WHO admit that Lockdowns are bad?

Those who mock him and pretend to love him while refusing to follow his commands will not enter into heaven.

Stop the Democrat circus smear campaign. Vote tomorrow.  They tried to destroy Judge Kavanaugh with slanderous lies why allow them to do this to Amy? No more hearings after today
1315746775391629313 2020-10-13 04:10:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Why 4 days of hearings?   After what they did to Judge Kavanaugh and his family, smearing him with false accusations one slanderous lie after another and bringing on a woman who falsely accused him then obtained wealth from a gofund me page.  Just do 1 day confirmation then vote!
1315732237162225664 2020-10-13 03:13:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Hearing should be 1 day 5 hours.   Then vote.

1315432160354955264 2020-10-12 07:20:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Suspend Social Media.  Why wasn't Section 230 repealed years ago?  Stop Social Media's Election Interference.
1315425362117976064 2020-10-12 06:53:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> Social media sites who censor before an election should be closed down immediately until election results final.   What Social Media is doing now is silencing truth and interfering with our electoral process.  @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President, please sign emergency executive order
1315424722004275200 2020-10-12 06:51:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kaiaka @Patriotpride14 They are going to take away all forms of communication from us.  They are doing it now.   They are censoring our President.
1315424518983221248 2020-10-12 06:50:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WeWillBeFree82 @Twitter Social Media giants are out of control.  President Trump needs to sign an emergency executive order temporarily closing all social media sites who are censoring until after the election is final.   @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President, please sign emergency executive order.
1315423779305123843 2020-10-12 06:47:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Please sign an emergency executive order and temporarily close down social media sites that right now censoring, suspending Christians, conservatives, moderates for speaking their voice.  This is illegal (section 230) and must be stopped immediately.
1315422236090589184 2020-10-12 06:41:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @samanthamarika1 President needs to just close down twitter, facebook and any other social media sites who are interfering with the election   Sign temporary Executive order closing them until after election.   Repeal Section 230 @realDonaldTrump
1315421976895184896 2020-10-12 06:40:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealSLokhova Repeal Section 230 @realDonaldTrump  Sign an executive order and just close all social media sites down until after the election
1315421188768686080 2020-10-12 06:37:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stirednotshakn They are censoring and suspending everyone who is not a Socialist Communist Democrat.    @gop @GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump  President Trump needs to sign an executive order and shut down all social media sites until election is over.  Repeal Section 230
1315420662807191553 2020-10-12 06:35:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> So many people on twitter pushing for censorship and communism.   This is really scary.
1315418864285491200 2020-10-12 06:27:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Patriotpride14 @realDonaldTrump  Our President needs to sign an executive order ASAP stopping them from censoring us.  What social media is doing is the REAL Election interference.
1315417449446039552 2020-10-12 06:22:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheAesculapius Yes, they control the CDC.  CDC is infiltrated with socialist Democrats.  CDC now just a political machine for the Democrat Party.
1315416116332654592 2020-10-12 06:16:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Patriotpride14 Google can close down Parler in a heartbeat.  Ham radio is actually a good idea but they can shut that down too.   If they can shut down the entire economy they can shut down all forms of communication and THEY WILL
1315414425944219648 2020-10-12 06:10:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg @realDonaldTrump  President is still President and he should act now and sign an executive order stopping social media sites from censoring, suspending this close to an election.  Emergency Temporary Executive order.  He can do this.
1315414029045702656 2020-10-12 06:08:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @GOP @GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader @DonaldJTrumpJr  Why all these years did the Republican Congress refuse to remove Section 230 from these Social Media sites who are Publishers not platforms? Why did you allow Socialist Google to have power over the American people?
1315412530848690177 2020-10-12 06:02:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DD_amdg Americans need to figure out how they are going to communicate with one another if the Democrat Communists take over this country.  Nobody is being proactive.  If they win we won't be allowed to speak on social media.  This country will be communist.
1315411945831362560 2020-10-12 06:00:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> The only reason we still have our Constitution is because in 2016 We had Social Media.  Now the Left Socialist Government runs all US Press and Social Media.  If they take over in November they will close your accounts and control all forms of communication. Lockdowns.
1315410920751857664 2020-10-12 05:56:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> If the Democrat Communists cheat and take over our country in November they are going to shut down our social media accounts.  They are going to lockdown the entire country so we won't be able to communicate here or out in public town halls.
1315410350360027141 2020-10-12 05:54:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> We need to find alternate ways to communicate besides social media.  If our country is taken over by these communist socialists they are going to take away our communication.  They are doing it already so once they take over they will do it 100%.
1315409416737320960 2020-10-12 05:50:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  @GOPChairwoman @GOP @GOPLeader  Repeal Section 230 Also now is time to sign temporary Executive order immediately to stop Twitter, Facebook from Censoring before an election.   Do something now!
1315408836413419520 2020-10-12 05:48:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @steph_rotramel @ryanstruyk She must not know many people if she does not know anyone over 60 not on a medication.  Why even make that statement?
1315407970788806656 2020-10-12 05:44:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> It use to be only communist countries where government controlled media.   Today the Far Left Democrat Socialist Party controls all media and now they have moved in and control 98% of Social media sites.   We are being lied to on a daily basis.   Censored and lied to.
1315406985274093568 2020-10-12 05:40:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Please sign an emergency temporary executive order repealing section 230 and close twitter and facebook down for their illegal election interference.  They are Censoring, suspending every Conservative on their "platforms".  They are a publisher not a platform.
1315406265112121344 2020-10-12 05:37:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Google, Social Media sites such as Facebook, Twitter have too much control over our lives and now are Censoring Americans from speaking truth before an election. Something needs to be done immediately.  Please sign temporary Executive order repealing section 230
1315404487658405888 2020-10-12 05:30:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ruggiere_l The @CDCgov Is now using disease to assist the far left and help implement socialism.   CDC now a political organization.

Power hungry politicians are using Covid as an excuse to implement socialism.   Lockdowns = Communism  This is still America and we have a constitution.  Constitution  does not allow a virus to erase its laws

He knows fully well who and what they are.  He is complicit.

1315217402603343874 2020-10-11 17:07:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ruggiere_l God does forgive, however these people are presuming they can just say they are sorry at the end.  It does not work that way.  That is presumption.  No true Christian can vote Democrat.   Voting for a Democrat Politician is indeed a mortal sin.

Reduce the money that's going to bail out states and unnecessary tracing and give the American taxpayer 1600.00 per adult. At this late time 1200.00 is to small.   Give to the people not the states.

1314857433035010048 2020-10-10 17:16:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> Oh, and this goes for athletes too.  They are immoral people with money trying to make themselves look saintly. They are the opposite of a Saint.
1314856882041835520 2020-10-10 17:14:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> When a Hollywood actor, singer goes to get an award and brings up politics and attacks our President with their propaganda, remember that these people are NOT Saints.  They are of the world and they are not only immoral and wrong but they don't give a dam about you.
1314855307143598081 2020-10-10 17:08:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pnjaban @TeddyD74794010 Harmeet, Twitter is doing this to almost all Trump supporters.  EU shadow ban test if you type different users you can see what I am saying.
1314854686940229632 2020-10-10 17:06:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mygippiebird Yes, except they receive royalties.  Every old TV show that airs the networks, have to send them a check.   You're right they use Politics to make people think they care but its really about them.  its "look at me, I'm a good person".  its about them.
1314854089222569984 2020-10-10 17:03:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> I had a friend who was a liberal and loved all the celebrities and bragged how they give so much to charity.  She was so into these celebrities that she thought that if you give to charity that's all you have to do and your a good person.  WRONG.  You must do more than that.
1314853642529202176 2020-10-10 17:01:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> I laugh thinking back about the "most popular", "prom queen" etc back in High school.  What are they doing now? Just popular people picked by peers to be front/center.  Same thing with these celebrities pushing their lies.  Just popular from the spot light but their souls empty.
1314852721900412928 2020-10-10 16:58:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> Hollywood celebrities, actors, singers are just people nothing more.  They eat sleep and poop just like you do. Oh except they eat much better and have a Millions more than you and they get special favors from the Government but remember they are just people with money/spotlight.
1314852064883732480 2020-10-10 16:55:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> If the United States is taken over by Socialist (Democrats) and the economy collapses, you won't own your home any more. You won't own anything. The rich Hollywood Celebrities, singers you worship won't be there for you.  They will get to keep their wealth but you wont.
1314851540344037376 2020-10-10 16:53:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> Hollywood Celebrities use politics to get attention.  They pretend they care about their fans or the American people. They are continuously raking in millions without working for it.  When you have a crisis in your life can you call them for help?  No, so don't believe their lies
1314850246220947456 2020-10-10 16:48:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why do people seem to worship these super rich celebrities, Singers, Hollywood actors, comedians?  Don't they understand that these celebrities could care less about them or their struggles in life.  Politics for them is one of their "hobbies".  They don't care about their fans.
1314849236509319168 2020-10-10 16:44:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Drestradamus He is working overtime.  We need to pray more.  Speak out too.  We cannot just pray and be silent.  And Vote. Vote Pro Life.  Vote for President Donald J. Trump.

That's how they think they can win the election by calling everyone a racist.   Its called segregationism.  They want to separate us by the color of our skin.  Democrat Segregationist are racist.

1314826456489365504 2020-10-10 15:13:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @tweetheart2020 @realDonaldTrump Seems like every day someone is suspended.  They don't want Trump to win.  It's a big gamble because if he wins Section 230 is going to be repealed.  They are doing this to themselves.
1314783083221053440 2020-10-10 12:21:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> Have you guys checked to see if you have been shadow banned lately?  Twitter is censoring all of us in different ways.  temporarily suspending for no reason and if you try to appeal it you will be permanently suspended.   They are now going full throttle you guys.
1314780926828658688 2020-10-10 12:12:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Can someone please do an updated list of the bigger influencer accounts who have been suspended within the last 6 months.   I just noticed Bill Mitchell was permanently suspended.  Christians, conservatives are disappearing on Twitter.
1314779505467117568 2020-10-10 12:07:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> I hope Laura Loomer wins Florida's 21st congressional district.  She will help repeal section 230
1314778958454349824 2020-10-10 12:05:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> Mr. @realDonaldTrump  President, they keep suspending daily and Censoring those not suspended. 1
1314778459667746816 2020-10-10 12:03:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> Wow!  Twitter is suspending everyone and even censoring our President.   Repeal Section 230 @realDonaldTrump
1314777892778254342 2020-10-10 12:00:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SenatorDole @realDonaldTrump Thank you sir for telling us the truth. This "debate commission" should be closed down.      Any debates going forward should be done by a moderator who allows each candidate to ask each other questions. No more hand picked questions by the moderators. No more Democrat Moderators
1314775664294158341 2020-10-10 11:52:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MandaraJr @CuddleTalk @KamalaHarris @VP She made a complete fool of herself.  America can do better than this.
1314768337247764480 2020-10-10 11:22:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> How many Americans lost their lives when even though Nancy Pelosi knew the Coronavirus was spreading she told people to go to China town and go to crowded places.   How many people listened to Nancy Pelosi and because of her they contracted coronavirus?
1314767517638828032 2020-10-10 11:19:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi @RepRaskin Why don't you spend this kind of time and energy on helping the American people?    You only focus on hate.  Your heart is cold.
1314766141730902016 2020-10-10 11:14:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi Americans waited and you refused to help them.  Because of Nancy Pelosi Americans who were hanging on by a thread lost everything.  Nancy Pelosi is a power hungry BULLY!  She only cares about getting trillions of dollars to her donors not the American People who need help.
1314764876011597828 2020-10-10 11:09:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WinningWwg1wga @SpeakerPelosi @RepRaskin Our Military to took an oath to protect and defend the United States Constitution should be arresting her and putting her in a military prison for treason.
1314764251819515905 2020-10-10 11:06:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> All Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats can do is OBSTRUCT and since Nov 2016 they refused a peaceful transition.    Instead of helping the American people with Covid Relief/Stimulus check, Nancy Pelosi continues to try to subvert the American Electoral process.
1314759170034266112 2020-10-10 10:46:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @newtgingrich @lizpeek Nancy Pelosi caused millions to lose their homes because she kept playing games.   Every day that goes by people struggle because Democrats like @SpeakerPelosi sabotaged the relief bill.  If this is ever passed it will be too late.  Blame Pelosi.   Vote Republican November 3rd.

1314710810002817024 2020-10-10 07:34:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you vote for Biden/Harris you will regret it.  You will weep!  You will have a bleak future and your children/grand children will have a sad future too!  Think before you vote.

1314336654740520960 2020-10-09 06:47:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> LOL  So Joe Biden doesn't want to answer a question because he doesn't want the media to report it?
1314335344582553600 2020-10-09 06:42:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KazikBaer Red States need to organize a think group and find a way to deny Democrats from moving into their states.
1314334596104765440 2020-10-09 06:39:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EricTrump @dhinakaranrajan President should refuse to do a virtual debate.
1314332910225244160 2020-10-09 06:32:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AngelWarrior321 @SSbridges51 Absolutely.
1314332367759138816 2020-10-09 06:30:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They blacmailed Jeff Session and they did the same thing to current AG.
1314331776282550272 2020-10-09 06:28:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DarrellIssa In 2018 Democrats cheated with ballot harvesting in Republican districts.  Republicans winning on election day and then votes coming in days later erasing those wins.  Republicans need to contest and demand recounts and do investigations.  Cheaters need to be prosecuted.
1314330478837522433 2020-10-09 06:22:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Antifa and Blm are already going after the suburbs.  If Democrats win in November there will be no police to call when your home is being attacked.  They are doing with business and now they are moving on to homes.
1314327470225596416 2020-10-09 06:11:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @christina_bobb @realDonaldTrump @POTUS At what point does the US Military step in and defend the United States Constitution?  Didn't our Military take an oath to defend the United States constitution against foreign and domestic enemies?
1314326632195256321 2020-10-09 06:07:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump She didn't get away with her lies.   She only got away with it with the fake media and her crooked Democrat Party.  Americans know she's a liar.
1314326394873147392 2020-10-09 06:06:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RepMarkGreen @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Can someone answer this question please.    At what point does our United States Military uphold their oath to protect the United States constitution from domestic enemies?
1314325860569157632 2020-10-09 06:04:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> huh?  Kamala Harris Fabricated almost everything she said. Non stop lies.  We have recent vidoes to prove her lies.   Why would anyone want her to be VP?
1314325405029916672 2020-10-09 06:02:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Someone please get Nancy Pelosi a good Psychiatrist.  She needs help.

1314324040358584320 2020-10-09 05:57:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> Impeach Nancy Pelosi @SpeakerPelosi
1314323139396952064 2020-10-09 05:53:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please vote her out office in November and get an intelligent person to represent NY-14 This nonsense is getting old
1314321840341307393 2020-10-09 05:48:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump CDC lied and said millions would die from Covid and when they said that they said 'DO NOT WEAR MASKS".  So then when CDC realized people were angry about their fake numbers the cdc said to wear masks to make it look like that's what saved America.    All lies from CDC, media
1314321047919845376 2020-10-09 05:45:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump The real death toll from Covid is not 200,000.  The real death toll is equal or less to the Flu.     They manipulated the numbers and CDC Dr. Birx admitted it on live TV.  Hospitals coded cause of death as Covid even when that person died from cancer, auto accident..

1314320090691596288 2020-10-09 05:41:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump 98% of people survive Covid.   We are going on 9 months of this nonsense.  They first said it would be a lockdown for 2 weeks.  Americans hesitantly agreed.  Now they want it to be permanent.  The left is using Covid to destroy the United States.

1314136613455241217 2020-10-08 17:32:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Mike_Pence @CubanAmerican72 Thank you for not letting that moderator stop you from defending the president from another slanderous Kamala Harris Lie. Presidents Campaign management need to put a stop to unfair debate rules where moderators try to cut you off without defending yourself. @realDonaldTrump
1314133034233262085 2020-10-08 17:18:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealJamesWoods @LindaGarriss Nothing but lies out of Kamala's mouth tonight.  How did the Democrat Party get where they are?
1314132823972831233 2020-10-08 17:17:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> Democrats are not following the science: @VP @KamalaHarris
1314129978452180992 2020-10-08 17:06:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> Just one of Kamala's bold lies to the American people during the debate tonight on Live TV.
1314126511390171136 2020-10-08 16:52:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> Tulsi exposes who Kamala Harris really is:

1314121867939123200 2020-10-08 16:34:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pnjaban @TellTheTruth1 It's sad that we are at a time in America that a Democrat VP Candidate can stand up and outright lie numerous times to Americans on Live TV and this is acceptable to their party.
1314113655991013377 2020-10-08 16:01:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NukinEgr @juliedepo @SVNewsAlerts @NYGovCuomo exactly.   If she doesn't religious liberty she should move to Communist China.
1314110969203679232 2020-10-08 15:50:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @1776Stonewall @lynn_weiser He also has the Orthodox Catholic Vote and Christian Evangelical vote.
1314106686324371461 2020-10-08 15:33:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Maricristy @mshson Yes they are hypocrites.  I'd say almost all of them.
1314106439061835782 2020-10-08 15:32:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @realDonaldTrump  President Trump needs to find out who in his campaign is agreeing to these debate "rules".  Whoever is doing the debate negotiations is doing a really bad job.
1314105036914319360 2020-10-08 15:27:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump @VP @seanhannity Can you believe the fake polls going around saying Kamala Harris won? LOL   Kamala Harris was a total failure tonight and she even lied several times on live TV.    Unbelievable!
1314103203823198209 2020-10-08 15:19:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DebTown45 @FoxNews Fox News has Wallace on constantly since the debate and is sending a signal to us that they approve of Chris Wallace and his outright biased, arrogant, obnoxious Non Neutral moderation of the debate.    Fox news giving their conservative viewers the middle finger.
1314099046697426944 2020-10-08 15:03:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @VP Joe Biden is NOT a Practicing Catholic.  Joe Biden is a fake Catholic who does NOT follow the teachings of our Catholic faith.  Joe Biden is an apostate, heretic.

1314065266397986816 2020-10-08 12:49:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @EddieZipperer Many, many ignorant Americans today don't know or care about flip flopping and still vote for these liars.
1314065053981659142 2020-10-08 12:48:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LisaMarieBoothe I couldn't imagine having to listen to that voice every day and wake up looking at her every day.   scary thought.
1314064056014139392 2020-10-08 12:44:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte I believe President Trump should be allowed to serve a 3rd term because of the obstruction and hell the Democrats put him though his first term.
1314063763063021570 2020-10-08 12:43:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump USA is turning into what the Founding Fathers escaped from.
1314053049652920320 2020-10-08 12:00:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> For those pundit's on Fox news tonight @foxnews Who said the VP debate does not make a difference...  That is an outright lie!  The debate tonight gave President trump 100s of thousands additional votes.   VP debates do matter.   Harris was exposed as a liar.

1314033446042300418 2020-10-08 10:42:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjdtwit @FoxNews I watched the debate on Cspan.  I can't take fox news continuously putting Chris Wallace on every segment.  It's obvious Foxnews has gone to the left.
1314032501757669376 2020-10-08 10:38:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> Cspan was great for watching this debate tonight.   I can't watch @foxnews any more.   Can't stand listening to Chris Wallace.  Fox news continuing to force their viewers to leave.
1314031000100372481 2020-10-08 10:32:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @VP Mike Pence won this debate.  The media will make fools of themselves (again) if they lie and say otherwise.   Mr. President,  get your campaign to stop these unfair debate rules.
1314028524341084163 2020-10-08 10:23:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> As a Californian I can confirm that what @VP said about Kamala Harris and her record as a prosecutor in California is true.  She did NOTHING for the black community.
1314027834487103488 2020-10-08 10:20:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> Kamala Harris is a segregationist.  Race baiting is evil.
1314027708209197056 2020-10-08 10:19:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Many Democrats have left the Democrat Party because they are against Racial Segregationism.    Please, if you are one the few Democrats who want to stop Democrat Segregationism and you realize all human beings no matter race are created by God, speak out!  Segregationism is evil.
1314024831256420353 2020-10-08 10:08:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JRGIMBEL @realDonaldTrump @marklevinshow President Trump needs to take action and get a NEW debate negotiation manager.  Every Candidate must have a chance to respond to accusations.
1314024575303249920 2020-10-08 10:07:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> Kamala Harris and the Democrats just want to scare the American people.  Fear mongers.
1314024341969854464 2020-10-08 10:06:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> Joe Biden is NOT a practicing Catholic.  Joe Biden is Catholic in name only.  A Catholic cannot support, legalize abortion.  Joe Biden is an apostate, heretic.   A catholic in bad standing.  He goes against church teaching.  @KamalaHarris
1314024028563144706 2020-10-08 10:05:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Who in your campaign is negotiating these ridiculous Campaign rules?   Please replace your new Campaign manager and cancel all future contracts and do new debate contracts with acceptable rules.
1314023474671742977 2020-10-08 10:03:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> I'm sick of this BS!  They won't let Mike Pence respond to Kamala's slanderous lies.   @realDonaldTrump   President Trump needs to get a new Campaign manager.   These debate rules are UNACCEPTABLE.
1314021656046653440 2020-10-08 09:55:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> Mike Pence needs to bring up Russia and the declassified information.
1314020932860563457 2020-10-08 09:52:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> Kamala Harris has a horrible voice.
1314018252561891329 2020-10-08 09:42:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> Do a FACT CHECK on Kamala Harris please.  She's lying on live TV saying Biden will not ban fracking yet he said it many times on camera.  She's such a LIAR.     WOW!
1314016632772063232 2020-10-08 09:35:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> I love how VP Pence just exposed Kamala as a Liar on live TV.   YES!!
1314014344481447937 2020-10-08 09:26:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> Mr. @VP    Don't compliment her.
1314013780112596992 2020-10-08 09:24:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @VP Mike Pence is doing great in this debate and exposing Kamala as a complete fool.
1314008758549270530 2020-10-08 09:04:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LilaGraceRose Kamala Harris does not speak for men either.
1314008297595260928 2020-10-08 09:02:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Foxnews does not want us to tune into their station any more.  They have Chris Wallace blathering on and on before the debate starts.  Turned to Cpan

1313968916792713216 2020-10-08 06:26:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kylegriffin1 Because the media withholds truth and they lie to the American people.  Fake headlines every day.

1313816014048563200 2020-10-07 20:18:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz @marthaonfire Really we shouldn't have lost the house in midterms. With the great job President Trump has been doing and the crazy BS coming from the Democrats it makes no sense. They say history shows midterms the minority wins house blah bla.  Problem is people with no morals, no brains vote
1313815056774119425 2020-10-07 20:14:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lrihendry @DanielMestas LOL    Funny but TRUE

1313814346057699331 2020-10-07 20:12:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MatthewJshow @CNN @StCollinson CNN is not news!  CNN is owned by the Democrat Socialist Party.  Every time I see CNN headlines I laugh the same way i did when in line at the grocery store and looking at inquirer or sun magazine.  "Martians with two heads taking over earth", "The moon is falling".  CNN is trash
1313813117629939713 2020-10-07 20:07:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz Why not declass it sooner?
1313812885114560512 2020-10-07 20:06:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz @marthaonfire One thing good about all this is we are now aware that they are planning on cheating.  President is aware and has brought it out in the open.  I think they will get caught.
1313812514287742978 2020-10-07 20:04:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz @marthaonfire No, I'm sure they laughed all night long when they cheated in 2012.  Just like how he spied on President Trump.  They are just evil people.
1313811869442793477 2020-10-07 20:02:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz @marthaonfire Republicans are too nice and need to wake up and if they cheat we cannot accept the outcome of their fraud.
1313811569898266625 2020-10-07 20:01:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz She did not win popular vote.  They cheated.
1313811444534632457 2020-10-07 20:00:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz They cheated here in California.  The Democrats harvested ballots, counterfeit in strong majority Republican districts in OC.  Republicans won on election day then days later ballots appearing out of no where.  They are taking that formula nationwide
1313810756672970752 2020-10-07 19:57:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dmaj1 Shouldn't be that way at all.   All should be allowed to speak. Repeal Section 230
1313810560434147328 2020-10-07 19:57:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cindyleepenn1 Same here.  when he wins I hope he moves on to Parler so we can all leave and see Twitter have a hissy fit.

1313807932534845440 2020-10-07 19:46:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @willbarrett_1 @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your service to your country!  God Bless you!!
1313807574244814854 2020-10-07 19:45:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SaraCarterDC @willbarrett_1 @realDonaldTrump I wish he would have declassified this earlier though..  Its a lot to catch up on.
1313807387271196672 2020-10-07 19:44:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @joerodriguez192 I hope President Trump moves over to parler some day
1313807138381197312 2020-10-07 19:43:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @joerodriguez192 You are spot on!  Wow,  Yes, notice when you see the left on twitter and their hatred, lies etc.  Hard to see that in people before social media.  Now we can see exactly what these people are.  Demonic.
1313806743294541825 2020-10-07 19:41:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> I am on parler.  Have not been using it often but please follow me and say hello if you are on.    My @ is the same as this one.
1313806047308517378 2020-10-07 19:39:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> Sometimes I feel guilty when I log into Twitter knowing that I am in a way supporting an evil company that is ran by immoral communists who thrive on destroying the United States Constitution.    I hope President Trump moves to Parler after the election.
1313805423368044544 2020-10-07 19:36:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> We are not just campaigning against immoral, wicked Democrat Politicians, we are fighting against hell itself.   Pray every day for President Trump and the USA and ask God to once again save us from the Evil, Godless Left.   We can't stop praying.
1313804819631464449 2020-10-07 19:34:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mlidke @JohnFromCranber @Frankhe1 @NikkiHaley Worse than the party of Karl Marx.  I don't think those communist back then worshiped abortion, infanticide while pretending to believe in God.  The Democrat Party is Passive aggressive communism on steroids.
1313803658111320067 2020-10-07 19:29:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz @marthaonfire Remember that feeling when waking up and Obama won again?  I fear that every time we have an election.  I thought it was going to happen last election but thank God Hillary Lost.
1313802757900443648 2020-10-07 19:26:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz @marthaonfire You're right.  If more go on Parler it would improve its technical performance I'm sure.
1313802438705438720 2020-10-07 19:24:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Metlwiz God forbid we lose.  If we do I won't be on here but if we win I will stay long enough to get Section 230 repealed.   Look how many lunatics voted for Hillary.  God help us if Biden wins.  If he wins this won't be America any more.   Where do we go? Even Ireland is turning commie
1313800746693877761 2020-10-07 19:18:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> If section 230 is repealed you will be able to sue social media sites who unjustly suspend you or remove you from their platform.   Please vote for President Trump and when he wins demand congress repeal section 230.
1313799320785678336 2020-10-07 19:12:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> So True!  Destroying business, restaurants etc and the mask mandate is just the beginning.  If Biden wins in November this country is going commie
1313798322134503424 2020-10-07 19:08:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you are not allowed to defend yourself on Twitter or say what you believe in because others may be offended by your beliefs then why does Twitter have a Block button?
1313797582787731461 2020-10-07 19:05:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> When Libs comes out of no where, tweet me I wonder should I block or answer? Should I dialogue, debate?  Defend myself when called a name etc?  You can't do any of that on Twitter or you get suspended. I remember when AOL came out you could argue, debate.   Repeal Section 230
1313795985076678656 2020-10-07 18:59:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> Every once in a while I wonder, why do we all come on to Twitter when we know its ran by a bunch of communist sitting at their desk laughing while suspending Christians, conservatives, moderates and anyone else who does not fall into line with their socialist agenda.
1313795308908806144 2020-10-07 18:56:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JewhadiTM @reshas He has issues.

1313794646531739648 2020-10-07 18:53:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mnsotawife Isn't it sad that you have to be afraid when arguing with a liberal on here because twitter will suspend you? I can't wait until Section 230 is repealed.
1313794448577327104 2020-10-07 18:53:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mnsotawife I have a Parlor account but its really slow and awkward. They need to make it better.
1313794230670688257 2020-10-07 18:52:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SglNewYork @AantonAgrippine @Matthew_4_Trump I have a right to not be discriminated against and to walk into the store and buy food in order to live and exist and these stores and going along with a communist regime.  I wash my hands and I don't cough or sneeze on people.  The masks they are wearing are a symbol. its a joke
1313792914460299266 2020-10-07 18:46:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> Who else wonders every time you send a tweet if Twitter is going to suspend you because you are saying something that goes against their Liberal Socialist agenda?
1313792253840683008 2020-10-07 18:44:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kerpen Nancy Pelosi is very effective at destroying her party and handing over the House, Senate and Presidency to the President in November.   We should thank her.  January the Trump Congress will pass a better bill and it will be retroactive.

1313790047301193728 2020-10-07 18:35:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SglNewYork @AantonAgrippine @Matthew_4_Trump I didn't ask how much they were, I asked if you were going to buy it for me?  If so buy me 50 of them, otherwise don't tell me what I need to wear to the store to buy my food.
1313789503887212544 2020-10-07 18:33:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @WinningWwg1wga @catturd2 @NBCNews They (fake news stations) are all hateful and dishonest and they hate the American people.  @abcnews  @cbsnews  @nbcnews  @MSNBC   @CNN
1313787782716776450 2020-10-07 18:26:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> Repeal Section 230
1313787570837315584 2020-10-07 18:25:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NBCNews Nancy Pelosi did that not the President.  NBC is dishonest.
1313787166548398081 2020-10-07 18:24:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why does Twitter keep censoring our President when they don't like his politics. They just censored his factual statement on flu death numbers from the past.   It scares me that our congress is allowing twitter to say they are a public forum. They are NOT.  Repeal Section 230
1313784649093509123 2020-10-07 18:14:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SglNewYork @AantonAgrippine @Matthew_4_Trump Are you going to buy it for me?
1313784535440531458 2020-10-07 18:13:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @davidwebbshow @drdavidsamadi Repeal Section 230 Twitter is NOT a Public Forum.  Twitter is acting Publisher.  They cannot be both.
1313784119143399425 2020-10-07 18:11:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jennybethm @jack @drdavidsamadi In 1996 congress gave AOL and other sites section 230 protection as a public Forum to not be liable what others say so to give internet freedom of speech for Americans. I remember this. AOL faded away, Google, Twitter GREW and want to be both forum and publisher.   CANT BE BOTH
1313782815905865729 2020-10-07 18:06:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @gatewaypundit @drdavidsamadi @realDonaldTrump Twitter is not a Public Forum.  Twitter is a Publisher and must be classified as such.
1313782215407407104 2020-10-07 18:04:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @realDonaldTrump I can remember in 1996 when congress passed the law to give internet sites (AOL chat rooms) etc freedom to let people speak freely and not be accountable. Purpose to allow free speech. AOL faded away, Twitter took over and began censoring Christians, Republicans, Moderates.
1313780300594380800 2020-10-07 17:56:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @realDonaldTrump Twitter is not a public forum.  Twitter is a publisher.  You are not allowed to speak freely on twitter  unless you are a liberal Democrat.   Everyone should watch this video. Can you get enough donations to get this video on TV? Need to educate the public on Section 230
1313778673472872448 2020-10-07 17:50:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth @realDonaldTrump I can't wait until we repeal section 230.  The litigation will help many of us not just financially but it will preserve our constitutional right of freedom of speech.  Social media is today's town square.  All must be allowed to freely speak.
1313771970685595650 2020-10-07 17:23:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Democrat Party is evil

1313758489085313024 2020-10-07 16:30:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Is there still Justice in America?  How and why are these people not in jail?
1313757904709709825 2020-10-07 16:27:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> What really scares me is that there are so many stupid, immoral people in this country who will vote for Joe Biden.   Stupid and Evil is a really bad combination.

1313749053197352961 2020-10-07 15:52:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @atensnut These Democrats actually worship the Mask! They endorse fear.    I think they use to call these kind of people "Fear Mongers"  The worse kind is is a politician.
1313745576341561344 2020-10-07 15:38:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ksorbs They closed our gyms because they want us weak.  Working out, lifting weights, machine weights builds a strong immune system.  They want us to lose muscle mass and have heart attacks.  Thank the CDC and Dr. Fauci
1313739489852891136 2020-10-07 15:14:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump He was in his HOME.  Democrats and media now want us to wear our masks in our home.  President was at home on his balcony.  White house is his HOME.
1313739266447482880 2020-10-07 15:13:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi won't give the American people anything unless she gets her Trillion dollars jammed in the bill for her donors.
1313737820263964672 2020-10-07 15:07:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @SpeakerPelosi This is the Democrats last chance to save face with the American people.
1313736864377962499 2020-10-07 15:04:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @SoCalValleyGal Nancy Pelosi is a Hypocrite and now the whole world knows it.  So Democrats elected a hypocrite to be House Speaker (twice).   Pelosi only wears a mask in front of the camera.

Not to mention it makes it hard to breathe wearing one and it's a statement of submission and does not protect against virus unless its surgical medical grade
1313692217899315200 2020-10-07 12:06:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Topsy71452 @JRubinBlogger What about the hundreds of thousands of ballots that won't make it to and from the Post office and the ballots in the mail truck shoved behind the seats and the "mis delivered" mail?
1313685986933571584 2020-10-07 11:42:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Ive gone into the grocery store without mine and nobody has said anything to me.  If they do I'll just buy my items and leave.
1313657049469784065 2020-10-07 09:47:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Hearings should be heard for 5 hours in 1 day.  Then vote.  No more circuses from Democrats.

I think President Trump needs to start sending in the Military to arrest the Governors, Mayors, Judges who are attacking constitutional rights.   Military took oath to defend constitution.   WHERE ARE THEY?
1313639664482316288 2020-10-07 08:37:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump This is tyranny and it cannot continue in America. Indicting Americans for their constitutional right to bear arms and defend their lives, property.  How can this be happening?  Is Bill Barr doing something?  @realDonaldTrump   https://t.co/T2y9Ou1uH0
1313637002735095811 2020-10-07 08:27:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump If this continues it won't end well.  I think most Americans are patient but there will be a point where this will have to stop.
1313636079933616129 2020-10-07 08:23:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Amazing to see how easily some Americans give up their freedom.
1313634755406045184 2020-10-07 08:18:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Democrats are Communists.  This will be the new normal way of life if Democrats take control.
1313632375021031424 2020-10-07 08:08:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Write up an emergency Executive order.  If the Democrats fight it that exposes them for the contempt they have for the American workers.

If not the new maj Republican House/senate can pass the 1.6 trillion Relief Bill retroactively in January.    Democrats just want money for their donors.
1313603658689306624 2020-10-07 06:14:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GOPLeader Democrat Politicians obviously dont care about feeding children or they would have agreed to a Bi Partisan Bill
1313600339732434944 2020-10-07 06:01:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi You should be ashamed of yourself!

1313595200472662016 2020-10-07 05:41:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jadeitie1002 @SpeakerPelosi No, this was Nancy Pelosi's plan all along.  If she cared about the American people she would not have put 1 trillion dollars in the bill for her personal desires that had nothing to do with Covid relief.

1313582392473317376 2020-10-07 04:50:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi   Pelosi represents the Democrat Party.   They don't care if Americans go hungry.    Selfish, rich greedy Democrat Politicians.

1313579831095775232 2020-10-07 04:40:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Democrats just lost the house, senate and presidency.   Republicans will draft a Retro active Covid Relief Bill and pass it in January.
1313578779176886273 2020-10-07 04:36:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MartinPujdak @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi  does not want a deal.   Nancy Pelosi wants a Trillion dollars for her donors and she could care less about the American people.   If Nancy Pelosi and Democrats cared about the American people they would have passed a BI PARTISAN BILL strictly for COVID RELIEF
1313578159103569921 2020-10-07 04:33:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JulieReichwein1 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi  If Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats cared about the American people they would have passed the Bi partisan bill of 1.6 Trillion for the American people.  Pelosi wants an additional TRILLION for her donors.   That is not Bi Partisan.

The reason Americans won't get a stimulus check is because of Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress.   Vote Republican.
1313575951691771904 2020-10-07 04:24:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please draft the highlights of the Stimulus Bill now so that Americans know what to expect.   Cut all the waste and  send a check for $1500.00 to each American Citizen taxpayer and retired social security recipients.

That's all the Democrats had to do to help the American people but they are too power hungry and greedy!
1313571162845188096 2020-10-07 04:05:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi wants a trillion dollars for her donors.    The Democrats don't care about Covid-19 relief.  They want to shut down our jobs and economy before the election.   Democrat politicians care about their own selfish needs.
1313569815840268290 2020-10-07 04:00:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi You refused to negotiate for the American people and now we will not receive a stimulus check.   You wanted a TRILLION Dollars for your donors!
1313566302586322944 2020-10-07 03:46:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JStein_WaPo @SpeakerPelosi  Because Nancy Pelosi refused to put out a bi partisan bill.  She wanted a trillion dollars for her donors.

Now they say Covid floats around the air for long periods of time.   Anything can float in the air depending on room currents.  People need to ask why is CDC politicizing disease?

It won't pass because she put $$$$ in the bill that has nothing to do with Covid-19 relief but goes to her donors needs.    If you do not get a Stimulus check it is because of Nancy Pelosi.

The Democrats crowned her House Speaker and she refuses to help the American people.  She wanted money to go to other sources unrelated to Covid-19. She refused to keep it simple and just send check

Taxing people for reparations on something 155 years ago is not going to fly.  Federal Government will step in and stop it.  It is unconstitutional unless the money is given voluntarily.
1313063505428242432 2020-10-05 18:28:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Cernovich Americans ancestors fought and died in the Civil war to free slaves.   Slavery ended 1865.  155 years ago.
1313060230616342532 2020-10-05 18:15:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dusha_al Get another one if you can.  It will help a lot!!
1313058793488433152 2020-10-05 18:09:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LaurelCatherine @SeanPenn I like celebrities who don't use their wealth to destroy other Americans chances at reaching success the way they did. They use America's capitalist System to become Rich/famous then try to destroy it for us.
1313057301310234624 2020-10-05 18:03:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TomFitton Hydroxychloroquine saves lives.  Numerous Covid patients and doctors testimonials.
1313054765983567875 2020-10-05 17:53:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SeanPenn Most Americans, the ones who have even heard of you don't like you.   I forgot who you were and I would not even recognize you if I saw you.  Hollywood Celebrities irrelevant. Give all your money to the poor.  You definitely did not earn it.
1313053498200584192 2020-10-05 17:48:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CortesSteve  No more debates with Liberal Moderators.  Also Fox news had President Trump at camera side view  while Biden was camera face forward in attempt to make Biden LOOK better. Make cam placement fair.   Town Hall not a good idea especially with another leftist moderator.
1313047416724090880 2020-10-05 17:24:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dailycallout On twitter search type in Chris Wallace and you only get about 70 tweets and it ends.   Twitter is protecting Chris Wallace.   Scary when you see social media at work for Democrat Party.    Election interference big time!
1313046353988055041 2020-10-05 17:20:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cupoambition @mspdcali Definitely can see resemblance
1313043935153983488 2020-10-05 17:10:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryWarrick18 @CHIZMAGA His voice is irritating.   He has no talent.  His producers give him scripts to read.  He's just a liberal hack.  uneasy on the eye and his voice uneasy on the ear.   Way over paid.  A robot can do his job.
1313042372167573504 2020-10-05 17:04:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @paulsperry_ @realDonaldTrump  President Trump needs to replace his new Campaign Manager while we still have time to run a campaign.  President should not have to take more questions from Liberal moderators who hate him.
1313041807568039936 2020-10-05 17:02:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @courrielche I've never trusted Chris Wallace.   All he does it read scripts that his Liberal Producers on @foxnews @FoxNewsSunday  give to him. He has no talent. I can do his job and I look MUCH better than him.  Why do these untalented weasels get these super high paying jobs?
1313040682328584196 2020-10-05 16:57:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bubblebathgirl Because Chris Wallace is a liar and a hypocrite.  He is biased against our President and so are the producers of @foxnews @FoxNewsSunday
1313040127191523329 2020-10-05 16:55:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KurtSchlichter @CortesSteve I don't watch @foxnews @FoxNewsSunday any more but just watched the video clip and Chris Wallace was disgusting.
1313039639142232064 2020-10-05 16:53:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 @foxnews career is over.   They won't fire Chris Wallace He will cost them billions of dollars, lost viewers, lost advertisers, lost revenue.  I rarely watch Fox news any more! @FoxNewsSunday
1313038372378533888 2020-10-05 16:48:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheMikelCrump Unless Fox news @foxnews wants to lose viewers and advertisers they better fire Chris Wallace.  This is one of the most unprofessional men on the airwaves.
1313037667857125376 2020-10-05 16:45:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FOXNEWS @FOXNEWS Fox news makes me sick to my stomach!   What a trashy network!
1313036412774567937 2020-10-05 16:40:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @robbystarbuck President Trump needs to replace his new campaign manager
1313035533325459457 2020-10-05 16:37:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ReadMoreBible I Know he is God!
1313035211928563713 2020-10-05 16:36:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr Think about how many personal bankruptcies will be taking place in NY.  The Bankruptcy courts will be unable to process.  It will take months for people just to file.
1313034155932884992 2020-10-05 16:31:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AnnCoulter Chris Wallace should be fired from @foxnews  He is obnoxiously biased and ridiculous.
1313033274340458497 2020-10-05 16:28:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @catturd2 @Jennife15496769 I rarely watch Fox News and never on weekends.  What did he say?  I'd love to see video collages of his meltdowns
1312942727206563840 2020-10-05 10:28:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @padretwo59 @NPR Yes, if taxpayers are funding NPR it needs to STOP!
1312941967890808839 2020-10-05 10:25:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump You are absolutely Awesome!  You are the most awesome President USA has ever had.    We thank God you are our President!
1312941332353048577 2020-10-05 10:23:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NPR Is NPR still receiving federal funding?
1312939340830437376 2020-10-05 10:15:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Orangezipple1 Interesting.  Must have been difficult making those in the old days before machines.
1312938245034897408 2020-10-05 10:10:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> Hey you guys, please copy President Trump in your tweets and let him know how bad Twitter is censoring all of us.  thousands and thousands of President Trump supporters being suspended for no reason.
1312933472378314752 2020-10-05 09:51:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump @Rosemar42894219 I'm so sick of this total Bulls$t from the Democrats.
1312932488524623872 2020-10-05 09:47:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ToddWhirley @DanRather You'd think he's just go crawl under a rock and stay out of the spot light.

1312890372494745601 2020-10-05 07:00:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> And the Democrat Marxists are upset because President Trump is doing much better.   So sick to see these Democrats react in such a wicked fashion.
1312889490227167232 2020-10-05 06:57:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DanRather Weren't you fired for using forged documents on your "news" station?
1312881112469831680 2020-10-05 06:23:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rabbit_nasty @realDonaldTrump If they (social media sites) cannot let all people speak freely especially before an election they should be fined heavily and closed down for DISCRIMINATION at the least.
1312880683157577728 2020-10-05 06:22:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @rabbit_nasty @realDonaldTrump Our Congress needs to act and stop these social media sites.
1312880563678711808 2020-10-05 06:21:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> I agree.  Time to to revoke their business licenses.  @BigmindLoa
1312879019868602368 2020-10-05 06:15:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> I have been saying this for over a year that closer it gets to election twitter will ban everyone except the Marxist Left and its happening.
1312878694965288960 2020-10-05 06:14:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump
1312878307654811648 2020-10-05 06:12:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BigmindLoa @Matthew_4_Trump This close to election Twitter, Facebook, Google is suspending us and making Americans afraid to speak out for fear of being suspended.  It's now happening DAILY and getting worse.  Twitter, facebook, Google interfering with election by silencing your voice. @realDonaldTrump
1312877477929250817 2020-10-05 06:09:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BigmindLoa @Matthew_4_Trump Twitter suspended @drdavidsamadi  Dr. David Samadi for tweeting facts and his opinion.  Social media is the Town Square and if Social Media wants to Censor us and control elections then we need laws to close social media down starting with eliminating Section 230 @realDonaldTrump
1312871418338574336 2020-10-05 05:45:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Last time I commented and criticized the person in charge of the DOJ Twitter suspended me.  We have no freedom of speech and In USA Democrat Politicians are above the laws.
1312870619449487361 2020-10-05 05:42:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> Americans fought and gave up their life in the Civil war to free the slaves 159 years ago.  Governor Newsom needs to be recalled.   I hope people are signing the petition.
1312698686716039168 2020-10-04 18:18:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr Then it will be time for God to bring forth the Chastisements.   Once America goes that's when the wrath of God begins.
1312698158581833729 2020-10-04 18:16:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> Don't be surprised if tomorrow it is your turn and when you log onto Twitter your account will be suspended for breaking no rules just because they are silencing all of us so they can help Joe Biden win.     Goodnight.
1312697735892537346 2020-10-04 18:15:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Remove their legal protection section 230.   Twitter suspending all Trump supporters, even Doctors with professional opinions:  https://t.co/38hCt0vVdw
1312697158764621824 2020-10-04 18:12:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Twitter suspended him for this opinion  https://t.co/HGZbuFPd7J
1312696878039875584 2020-10-04 18:11:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Twitter on suspending spree before election to silence your supporters:  https://t.co/grqhWBZvqv
1312695469248659457 2020-10-04 18:06:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter suspended this Doctor for ensuring us that President will be fine.  Any Doctors that speak truth regarding Covid are suspended from Twitter.  When will Congress remove their legal protection 230 ?
1312694290515062784 2020-10-04 18:01:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> Is this what Twitter Suspended Dr. David Samadi for?   How much longer is Twitter, Facebook going to get away with doing this to people?
1312692907900461057 2020-10-04 17:55:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @jennybethm @jack @drdavidsamadi You are seeing what Twitter is doing to more famous people but please realize that Twitter is also suspending us and others for merely supporting our President.  Every day someone gets suspended for NOTHING. Just being conservative.....

1312669293385977856 2020-10-04 16:22:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq @AppleReality Because they want to lose their section 230 and become a publisher.

1312665776734662656 2020-10-04 16:08:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KellzBellzzah @SenSchumer @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump So the Democrats want to pack the Supreme court?  Does that mean they want more than 9?  OK, so that means we can do it too?  if we get house, senate, presidency can we put an additional 15 conservative Judges?
1312663942267723776 2020-10-04 16:00:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SeldenGADawgs @JoshNBCNews @NBCNews NBC Hates American electorate.  It's more than 63 Million now who love President Trump.

1312655697922850816 2020-10-04 15:28:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Tee2TheDub @LoraAConnor Great observation!  Yes and her body language when she's calling Joni Ernst dishonest you can tell she's the one who is dishonest. Her face shows Joni exposed her for the Liar she is.
1312654841831854080 2020-10-04 15:24:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @elonmusk @lexfridman Then why didn't you come out and make a statement on twitter rather than a little reply to someone else's words?  With all the gobs of money you have you're afraid to speak your own mind?
1312651669709090816 2020-10-04 15:12:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> If we allow Democrats to cheat and take power and win in November this country will experience the worse depression the world has ever known.  Our country will be gone.  There will be no more USA.

1312648735675936769 2020-10-04 15:00:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DAccampoFamily So sorry to hear that.  Can you sue the company that fired you?  Was it legal for them to force you to wear a mask?  Many people cannot wear mask long periods of time due to health issues.  Wearing a mask is not healthy.
1312647637720424448 2020-10-04 14:55:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @marklevinshow Media are propaganda machine for the Marxist Democrats.

1312627915633291265 2020-10-04 13:37:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Tee2TheDub It's now becoming all so real.
1312623863272886272 2020-10-04 13:21:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Tee2TheDub It seems like this is a test.  We can't buy groceries without a mask.  How far off are we from forcing microchips in us?
1312620728831811586 2020-10-04 13:09:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I agree but it seems like this is where we are going if Biden is elected President.  I fear we will spiral into Communism quickly.
1312619016796553216 2020-10-04 13:02:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> If government mandates that masks must now be warn permanently because of Covid and also Influenza will you comply?

1312515665555861504 2020-10-04 06:11:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Republicans running for Senate, congress need to speak out while campaigning and let Americans know if MAGA wins house/senate they will immediately pass Stimulus bill.  This needs to be mentioned in campaigns immediately..

She does not want to help Americans
1312512906706132994 2020-10-04 06:00:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Foxnews  only has a few conservative, moderate people on their network now.  Have you noticed since the debate they have put Chris Wallace and John Roberts on the airways constantly.  They are doing it on purpose.  They are siding with the LEFT wing Democrat Marxists.
1312512420305223680 2020-10-04 05:58:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore @MalBerry86 Yes it is.  He possesses most of the Democrat Politicians.

She won't even agree to send stimulus checks to the American people because she wants billions of dollars to go elsewhere for things that have nothing to do with Covid-19.
1312499100663783424 2020-10-04 05:05:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @wdunlap @realDonaldTrump In the meantime People have lost their business/jobs.  Government caused this....  That's why we need a stimulus.  Paycheck protection program saves jobs.
1312497996043485185 2020-10-04 05:01:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Jones17Charlene @surfaceplug Being that the Department of Justice does not enforce our laws more and more people continue to break the laws.  A recipe for chaos.

1312488920651722758 2020-10-04 04:25:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @exsailor62 @Matthew_4_Trump People are using disposable masks and  using the same mask over and over again.  Touching the outside of the mask when they take it off then touching other things in their home.  Its just a joke.
1312488414164312064 2020-10-04 04:23:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi  Nancy Pelosi refuses to help Americans and she enjoys her $15.00 ice cream bars from her $45,000 refrigerator in her multi million dollar mansion, private hair styling sessions with no mask while the American people go hungry.

1312312508099764224 2020-10-03 16:44:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> She also refuses to help the American people with a 2nd Covid-19 relief Stimulus bill.    She's a Greedy, selfish person.
1312311665443053568 2020-10-03 16:40:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> Being that Pelosi sabotaged the 2nd stimulus bill, payroll protection and stimulus check, Republicans need to announce a plan for January to help the American people.  Campaign on this and let American people know GOP majority in house, senate will pass Stimulus Bill.
1312310974293012480 2020-10-03 16:38:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle Pelosi refusing to help the American people only helps re elect President Trump and Democrat Party to lose seats in senate and congress in November.

1312308415717203968 2020-10-03 16:28:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi Thank you for helping the Democrat Congress lose seats in the Senate and Congress.  Thank you for helping re elect President Trump.      Your refusal to help the American people will ensure Republicans take the senate, Congress and Presidency.     Bravo!
1312307637317300224 2020-10-03 16:24:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi Your refusal to send Americans a Stimulus check and to renew the paycheck protection program ensures that Republicans will win the House, Senate and President Trump will be re elected.
1312306982422937600 2020-10-03 16:22:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi You deliberately cancelled a 2nd stimulus Bill because you think by making Americans suffer it will hurt the economy and stop President Trump from being elected but what you actually did was stopped the Democrat Party from being elected.  You helped re-elect Trump.

1311770577976188931 2020-10-02 04:50:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DeAnna4Congress Why isn't the Democrat Party condemning the actual Violence from Antifa, Blm we see occurring right now in our streets daily?

1311762988819390464 2020-10-02 04:20:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Don't do the next debate unless the moderator is a Republican and supports you for President.   Why is your campaign agreeing to left wing Democrat moderators who support Biden????
1311762420667281408 2020-10-02 04:18:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> These people are not Journalists or reporters they are flat out Marxist activists working for the Biden Campaign.   They should NOT be allowed to debate.  They are their to ask questions not argue and debate.  This is disgusting.

1311530362904821760 2020-10-01 12:56:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump President Trump needs to say that next time they start the racial division segregation questions.  Democrat Politicians are racist segregationists.

Not unrealistic at all.   They are cheaters and crooks.  President needs to demand next debate there is an inspection.

He's cheating.  That's probably how he got the statement regarding Kellyanne.

1311247820712628226 2020-09-30 18:13:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> Yes, Joe Biden is a LIAR and a creep and any American who votes for a Democrat is a creep and an enemy of God.

1311232439142940672 2020-09-30 17:12:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Twitter suspends for no reason now.  We can be suspended for saying anything they don't agree with.   Anyone else sometimes worry that your tweet will cause you to be suspended? Follow rules but still get suspended.  I'm so glad President Trump is on to twitter.

The debate structure, rules were stupid. @foxnews @FoxNewsSunday Fox news is a failure of a network.
1311229772630958080 2020-09-30 17:01:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @kilmeade Chris Wallace is the worse moderator in the world. Rude, abnoxious, arrogant and bias.     Definitely not professional
1311228035757006848 2020-09-30 16:54:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EricTrump And its happening in California too.  Joe Biden says it doesn't exist just like he says Antifa doesn't exist.

After tonight they will lose billions of dollars.  Mark my words.   @OANN needs to host the debates
1311226211687776256 2020-09-30 16:47:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @benshapiro Oh, really? I did not hear what he said but sounds just like him.  That debate structure was total BS.  2 minutes to speak and Wallace would not allow President even 10 seconds to correct lies from Biden.  Chris Wallace is a hack
1311225105146458112 2020-09-30 16:43:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump They want Job Biden to be allowed to spew lies and then not let President Trump rebuke the lies.  President Trump did the right thing but speaking when Joe Biden lied.   @foxnews and Chris Wallace are disgusting.
1311222836757889025 2020-09-30 16:34:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KamalaHarris You and Joe Biden wanted to stop President Trump travel suspension entry into USA.  President Trump saved millions of lives.  If you were President you would have let them in and allowed Covid-19 to spread to 3 million.  https://t.co/PXAOS44DMs
1311221067281653761 2020-09-30 16:27:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris The United States Constitution disagrees with you.
1311217515469570050 2020-09-30 16:13:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> End Segregationism
1311217426827108352 2020-09-30 16:12:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> AOC is an example of a politician who is a Segregationist.  The goal is to separate American Citizens by race for political and $ purposes. (Using people)  Nancy Pelosi is also a Segregationists.    Most in the Democrat Party are Segregationists.   Segregationism is active Racism
1311215448000610304 2020-09-30 16:04:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> Democrat Politicians who constantly call another human being a racist in order to create racial division are Segregationist.    Segregationism is active racism.   Please if you are a Democrat within your party and you are not a racist please denounce your parties Segregationism.
1311213719184007173 2020-09-30 15:58:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> Many Democrats have left the Democrat Party because they are against Racial Segregationism.    Please, if you are one the few Democrats who want to stop Democrat Segregationism and you realize all human beings no matter race are created by God, speak out!  Segregationism is evil.
1311211682023182336 2020-09-30 15:50:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> A Segregationist is a person who separates citizens by their race or the color of their skin. Segregationism is Immoral and dangerous because it is racism in action. A political party (Democrat Party), (green party) intentionally racially dividing its citizens to hate each other.
1311208494217875458 2020-09-30 15:37:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> Please join me in denouncing racial segregation groups such as the Democrat Party and the Green Party.  Democrat party is segregating Americans.  Democrat Party is separating us by race to create racial division, Hatred.  94% of Democrat Politicians are Racial Segregationists.

1311190080078315521 2020-09-30 14:24:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte President Trump's new Campaign manager should be replaced immediately for agreeing to the terms of this sham debate.
1311189878206472193 2020-09-30 14:23:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte We need at least one debate where the moderator is not debating the President.
1311184265996984321 2020-09-30 14:01:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> Democrat Politicians are Segregationists.   Constantly causing division by race is Segregation.   They Segregated by race when they fought to keep slavery and they continue to segregate us today.
1311183046880579584 2020-09-30 13:56:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> Democrat Party are Segregationists.  They divide us by race.  They are the party of hate
1311181542366928897 2020-09-30 13:50:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CovfefeKatie @AOC They are hateful racists.  AOC is a Segregationist.  She wants racial division and spreads hate.  They hate people who have white skin?  It seems like that is what this is about!  They hate
1311180664998305792 2020-09-30 13:46:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CovfefeKatie @AOC She's a segregationist.  She divides USA by race.  That is what the Democrat party is doing.  They are the true racists.
1311180152026456064 2020-09-30 13:44:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CovfefeKatie @AOC Her point is that anyone with white skin is now a racist.  Isn't that racism?  Because of our skin color we are bad?  That's what she's saying.  She is the racist.
1311176603985035265 2020-09-30 13:30:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BretBaier President Trump won because Chris Wallace was rude, biased and a total jerk.  @foxnews is a disgrace!
1311175974470344704 2020-09-30 13:28:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @CIAspygirl I've never seen a moderator be that strict where as not to allow someone to clarify when someone outright lies about them.  They have always given them a little time.  Wallace was hellbent on helping Biden during this debate. It was so obvious.  @foxnews better fire him.
1311173947610681347 2020-09-30 13:20:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @CIAspygirl Basically my point was that when Bidens two minutes were up after spewing lies and it was Trumps turn Wallace would not even give him 2 seconds to defend himself against lies.  Wallace saying this is a new question etc.  Total BS.  No way to run a debate. Trump was right to speak
1311172922132717568 2020-09-30 13:15:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte Yes,  that is the first thing I said after the debate.
1311172334963761152 2020-09-30 13:13:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @CIAspygirl I do think President Trumps new Campaign Manager should be replaced.  They should have never agreed to the terms of this debate and they should have gone with @OANN.  Next moderator needs to be a genuine republican.  No more Democrats or Rino Moderators.
1311171805147660288 2020-09-30 13:11:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SoCalValleyGal @CIAspygirl 2 minutes each and he ask Trump question first then saves same question for Biden 2nd.  When Biden spews lies Wallace won't let President Trump have 10 seconds to rebuke the lies.  Total BS.  Trump did what he had to do in order to get the truth out.
1311168840504541189 2020-09-30 12:59:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle @BradJacksonSr1 They won't be able to continue with their tyranny on the American people.  If they don't stop it will end in Civil War.  Americans are a free people.  Constitution cannot be trampled by politicians or by courts.
1311167738698592261 2020-09-30 12:55:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealCandaceO My Democrat neighbor watched it and made up her mind to vote for President Trump because Chris Wallace was a jerk.  So needle did move.

1311159306625064960 2020-09-30 12:21:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DonnaWR8 @Herhealthynews He's evil.  Just a tool of Satan!  Democrat party is evil.
1311157947746009094 2020-09-30 12:16:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec Chris Wallace ended his career tonight.  He was terrible.
1311155078997237763 2020-09-30 12:05:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump And Joe Biden says there is no evidence of voter fraud.  Is he lying or has he just been in a basement too long?
1311154537399427073 2020-09-30 12:02:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Chris Wallace was extremely rude and would not allow even 10 seconds to defend yourself after Biden spewed his lies.   It was obvious he was not acting as a moderator.
1311153652350902272 2020-09-30 11:59:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> Chris Wallace just ended his career tonight.  Presidential debate 2020

1311150579125608448 2020-09-30 11:47:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec @SeldenGADawgs Presidents new campaign manager should be fired.  Should have never agreed to these terms for this debate.   It was ran terribly.  President could not even defend himself after Biden lied because of a 2 minute rule?
1311149679959142400 2020-09-30 11:43:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JennaEllisEsq President Trumps new Campaign manager should be fired.

Should have been done with @OANN and should be allowed to respond back to lies made by Biden.  Wallace would not let President defend himself for even 10 seconds.  @realDonaldTrump
1311148466152718336 2020-09-30 11:38:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DallasFlamesFan I don't know one person who had Covid
1311146265581744128 2020-09-30 11:30:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> Chris Wallace should be fired for his constant disrespect, interrupting President Trump and siding with Biden  @foxnews
1311144472110010369 2020-09-30 11:22:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RSBNetwork @realDonaldTrump President Trump needs to replace his new campaign manager for agreeing to this kind of an unfair debate and chosing Chris Wallace. Why didn't they do the debate with @OANN ?  Why agree to be strictly forced to 2 minutes and not allowed to defend yourself against outright lies?
1311137883164610560 2020-09-30 10:56:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @vetsandfriends @Shawna_7777 @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Chris Wallace lost the debate.
1311136038501232640 2020-09-30 10:49:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump clearly won the debate even though the moderator Chris Wallace continuously defended Joe Biden and would not let the President defend himself on lies from Biden.

1311126444873977857 2020-09-30 10:11:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews   Chris Wallace is constantly interrupting the President and he is very rude to the President.  What kind of "moderator" is he?
1311120397631250432 2020-09-30 09:47:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @foxnews  is a disgrace
1311118412878282752 2020-09-30 09:39:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden Joe Biden does not send out his own tweets?
1311112379267051522 2020-09-30 09:15:25 +0800 <Surfingcity> Is Chris Wallace debating the President?  He won't let him speak.
1311100072289951746 2020-09-30 08:26:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @vicksiern @realDonaldTrump @Jali_Cat They cheated the same way in Orange County, California in 2018 in Majority Republican population district and that's how they gained seats.   They cheated.
1311096920203358208 2020-09-30 08:13:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @sgokrepki @MajorPatriot @JoeBiden Let him know it starts at 10:00 pm Eastern
1311086687838109697 2020-09-30 07:33:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle Biden is going to look like a frozen, confused deer in the headlights tonight.
1311086215819526144 2020-09-30 07:31:27 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump   Biden has been rehearsing his answers from the questions they gave him ahead of time.  Please ask him questions that he won't know how to answer.  When you answer make sure you ask him questions.
1311085665367461889 2020-09-30 07:29:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle @4GODUSAandTRUMP Not if his electronic hearing device malfunctions.  He won't be able to hear the answers and he will be confused.
1311084802510974976 2020-09-30 07:25:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JackPosobiec They shouldn't be allowed to vote.
1311084496100323329 2020-09-30 07:24:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ABirkshire @AnnCoakley4 Pray that Biden, Pelosi and the Democrat Marxist Party are exposed tonight for the evil they are.
1311081446359007232 2020-09-30 07:12:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @echo369ss @LaraPatriot Honestly I would not doubt if they surgically implanted a device deep inside his ear.   I pray if so that it malfunctions big time.
1311080822233997312 2020-09-30 07:10:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @AnnCoakley4 @sailorJack2019 I said a prayer and asked the Holy Spirit to Help President Trump tonight and expose the Democrat Left for the evil party they are and expose how incompetent Joe Biden is.   God be with President Trump always!
1311080307567681536 2020-09-30 07:07:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LaraPatriot @Bud_Doggin The only reason the Biden campaign would refuse to have inspectors see there are no electronic hearing devices in Joe's ear is because their is one.  What other reason would they refuse?

1311078442482376704 2020-09-30 07:00:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> Wow!  This is why Nancy Pelosi sneaks into get her hair done and wears no mask.  Only wear a mask on camera because its "political theater"
1311077067576934401 2020-09-30 06:55:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @steelcitycrazy Joe may fall asleep.   Doesn't he usually go to bed at 10:AM?
1311076452759035904 2020-09-30 06:52:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Pray Joe's listening device malfunctions.
1311076276648640513 2020-09-30 06:51:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> President Trump should refuse to debate if the Biden Campaign refuses to remove Biden's listening device.   Why would they refuse an inspection other than he is wearing one?
1311060067467161602 2020-09-30 05:47:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump With what is occurring in our country with rioters and domestic Terrorist the President of the United States has the power and should use it to bring the Military in and protect every voting location in the United States.
1311059666059718657 2020-09-30 05:45:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Send the Military in.
1311059240828641280 2020-09-30 05:44:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Project_Veritas Twitter is shadown banning the President of the United States and adding political bias content to his tweets so of course they would have no issue shadow banning you.  They are working for the Biden Campaign.

1311051051680718849 2020-09-30 05:11:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump I'm sure Biden has a hearing device tucked in his ear so someone can help him with the questions and @foxnews probably secretly gave him the questions ahead of time.
1310893092652765184 2020-09-29 18:44:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @steelcitycrazy No customer service any more.  I think they are just using Covid as an excuse to be lazy.  How longs it been?  8 months of this?

I support our police but I don't like how they handled this.
1310885574325145606 2020-09-29 18:14:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bob8967Bob @Lucy115438221 @EM_KA_17 @Savingworld88 Yep, we will find out what happened.  I hope his wife was not making false allegations.  scary to know you can be out in your front lawn drinking a beer in shorts and get tackled and arrested.  There must be more to the story.
1310884945024483330 2020-09-29 18:11:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bob8967Bob @Lucy115438221 @EM_KA_17 @Savingworld88 Why didn't the first officer tell him to get on the ground? Not gullible here.  I'm honest!   So is the plan to start going to the suburbs and tackle drunk white guys in short shorts?

1310874805592178688 2020-09-29 17:31:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bob8967Bob @Lucy115438221 @EM_KA_17 @Savingworld88 LOL   He was wearing tight shorts.  Maybe the officer who tackled him needs to get his eyes checked?

He had no weapons in his hand and he was chit chatting with another "officer".  NO THREAT!!!  could have put handcuffs on him.  Unnecessary force.  Over reaction.  No respect. I saw and heard what I needed.  Common sense

Hey, lets see the little tough guy tackle the rioters or is he too afraid.  So this was his tough guy moment?   I think it was disgusting.
1310870317095514112 2020-09-29 17:13:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bob8967Bob @Lucy115438221 @EM_KA_17 @Savingworld88 He was wearing NOTHING but shorts and no shirt!  There was an "officer" standing there talking to him.  the wanna be tough guy with ego came running towards him and didn't give him time to do anything just body slammed him.  Is drinking beer illegal???????????
1310868948104044544 2020-09-29 17:08:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TJYoungCO @sodagrrl @EM_KA_17 If someone is suicidal and they are standing outside in only shorts unarmed and not resisting and talking to the officer who said "relax" there is NO reason for the one "officer" to body slam him into the ground.   Are they too afraid to do that where the riots are?
1310867403803303936 2020-09-29 17:01:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkSpires3 @EM_KA_17 There was no reason to tackle him and cause physical harm to him.  He must have been a Democrat
1310866463918415872 2020-09-29 16:58:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Eddie7757 @EM_KA_17 knocked him on the ground for no reason.  Just standing there in nothing but shorts.
1310865868796997632 2020-09-29 16:55:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EM_KA_17 And they used excessive force.  That "officer" who body slammed him trying to prove he's a big bad, tough man by body slamming an intoxicated man in shorts who is not resisting just standing there.
1310864805004156928 2020-09-29 16:51:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Gabriel4Justice @charliekirk11 @Alanmillett3 90% of the media are enemies of the American People.  They are outright lying and withholding information.   Our Constitution gives freedom of the press but NOT freedom of the press to lie and deceive us.
1310864217621192704 2020-09-29 16:49:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CHIZMAGA I think it's getting close to stocking up on paper towels, toilet paper and food again.

Not saying she did that but he is innocent until proven he did what she said and no reason to body slam him.
1310863151395528707 2020-09-29 16:45:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CHIZMAGA Choices have fun out.  The Democrat Marxist Party is violent and dangerous.  Either way the election turns out we will have war.  Either our President will win and they will violently "resist" or they will outright CHEAT and Americans will be forced to defend the Presidency.
1310862589501399040 2020-09-29 16:42:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @slh2813 @carolinasassie @parscale Yes it was excessive force and unnecessary. He was standing only in shorts and not resisting after being told to come forward and relax and the "officer" body slammed him because he thought he was a big man, tough guy body slamming a drunk man in shorts with no weapons.
1310861724568805376 2020-09-29 16:39:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CHIZMAGA Oh we are definitely headed to a Civil War.  It's coming.

1310860337378291714 2020-09-29 16:33:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CHIZMAGA He and Wray will definitely be looking for new jobs after the election.
1310859173488259072 2020-09-29 16:29:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryFass3 @CHIZMAGA They conned us.   Sad.
1310858607471153152 2020-09-29 16:27:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CHIZMAGA @MaryFass3 He ran out the clock.  I mean how long has he had that job? What's he done?
1310857841788346370 2020-09-29 16:23:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CHIZMAGA @MaryFass3 I agree.  In the beginning they kept saying how good he was and showing that photo of him where he looks tough and serious.  Funny no other photo of him.  He's definitely not interested in Justice.

If you can go to walmart, Target, Grocery store, liquor store, gas to fill up your car or anywhere else you go you can go vote and YES voting in person is the BEST way if you want your vote counted.

1310849789077016576 2020-09-29 15:51:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoshuaVats @MaryFass3 There are so many strains of Influenza that they don't even know if the Flu shot will help anyone.  All I know is putting a virus in your body regularly doesn't seem right.
1310844659187421185 2020-09-29 15:31:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump What has FBI Director Chris Wray been doing about the massive corruption still occurring int he FBI?  FBI tried to over throw our election and will they try to do it again?
1310843530969899009 2020-09-29 15:27:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @CNN Why is CNN allowed to pose as US Press?  Aren't there some sort of guidelines that demand Press in USA be truthful and factual?  At the very least CNN should have their business license revoked.
1310842815832711168 2020-09-29 15:24:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SallyGold @realDonaldTrump Voting by mail is not secure.  The Post office loses my mail regularly and they deliver it to my neighbors down the street.  The US Post office also lets mail sit in their truck for days, weeks and it ends up late in your mailbox.

Everyone believed them and now its been almost 9 months.  They kept milking and and are still milking it to hurt the economy before the election
1310840192312340481 2020-09-29 15:13:50 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NYGovCuomo Not for long.   Tyranny will end on November 3rd and you will be arrested for your crimes.

1310838553606193152 2020-09-29 15:07:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Investigate Twitter for Election interference.   They are adding political notes in opposition of your tweets.  They are suspending Americans who support the United States President.   Daily suspensions and censoring before election
1310837539989725184 2020-09-29 15:03:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 @realDonaldTrump Pray every day for USA and for President Trump and his victory.   They are evil but God will win is we pray
1310837315485351937 2020-09-29 15:02:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 @realDonaldTrump Isn't it creepy to see how blatantly they are going after us and our President?  So obvious!
1310836926270726146 2020-09-29 15:00:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 @realDonaldTrump They are suspending Trump supporters daily. They are not a platform they are a political arm campaigning for Joe Biden. Jack Dorsey is nothing but a liar.

1310836268536799232 2020-09-29 14:58:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 @realDonaldTrump What they are doing is illegal.  They know if Republicans win the House, Senate and presidency they will lose their section 230, be investigated and sued.  They will end up going bankrupt.
1310835546197876736 2020-09-29 14:55:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cbch54898101 What has been decided?
1310835369558958081 2020-09-29 14:54:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 @realDonaldTrump Tucker Carlson called them out on this a couple days ago.  How the hell do they get away with this?
1310835105590509570 2020-09-29 14:53:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @invisibleme45 @realDonaldTrump Yes and its scary.  They need to have their legal section 230 protection revoked immediately!  They have no facts they are using propaganda to encourage voter fraud.
1310834623308378112 2020-09-29 14:51:42 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you want your vote to be counted do NOT vote by mail.
1310834348912857088 2020-09-29 14:50:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Twitter is interfering with the election by adding political notes to your tweets.

1310778873869553666 2020-09-29 11:10:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you vote for a Democrat you are an enemy of God.
1310777595303047168 2020-09-29 11:05:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ShannonBream Americans don't care about President Trumps taxes.  They care about massive voter fraud and are sick of the medias old tired attacks on our President.   Be a real Press and cover the massive voter fraud that's occurring across the USA.
1310775871507062784 2020-09-29 10:58:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle Wow!  Just like Hannity!  Thanks for the 10 seconds covering the massive voter fraud.   This is how the Democrat Marxist are going cheat to make Biden their President and dictator for a socialist communist America.  Media not covering illegal activity.
1310773973836165125 2020-09-29 10:50:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @NorsePole567 @charliekirk11 She also got away with it.  All these Government "elites" Democrats get away with Felonies.

1310773042558058496 2020-09-29 10:47:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Massive voter Fraud uncovered and media, including Fox News not even covering it.
1310762161686208512 2020-09-29 10:03:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle Why aren't you starting the show covering Voter Fraud?      Are Fox News producers controlling  you the same way they control Hannity now?  Unbelievable!   So sad.
1310761132160765957 2020-09-29 09:59:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity  Your show has turned into watered down lemonade.   Wow! So big of you to give Veritas 4 minutes time and in  beginning you say "if there is proof" right before you air the video showing proof. "innocent til proven guilty"?  Did your producers tell you to say that?
1310758448791867393 2020-09-29 09:49:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryBranham3 @CHIZMAGA You don't know if what she told him was true.  You're just going buy what she told the police.
1310758358312390656 2020-09-29 09:48:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MaryBranham3 @CHIZMAGA What part of the video were you unable to see with your eyes?  He was clearly standing outside giving himself up yet he was body slammed.  Totally unnecessary excessive force.  Please be real.
1310757153724981250 2020-09-29 09:43:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity What's wrong with you?  Voter Fraud rampant and you keep saying "up next" and wait to the very last few minutes of your show to air Voter Fraud.   I turned your show off AGAIN
1310730051181191168 2020-09-29 07:56:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @QTAnon1 I still text with my fingers.  Less mistakes.  Thumbs too big

Can we really trust @foxnews ?  They hired Donna Brazile after she gave Hillary the Questions in advance.
1310729144951398400 2020-09-29 07:52:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @annvandersteel Big tough police officer trying to show everyone what a big man he is by tackling a drunk man peacefully standing with only shorts on, no weapons.   Pathetic!
1310728565084704768 2020-09-29 07:50:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CHIZMAGA Right. Big tough "officer" trying to prove what a BIG MAN he is body slams a man who is wearing only shorts and standing by talking to another office who called him over and said to "just relax". So if you are not part of a terrorist group Antifa or Blm excessive force is ok.

A mask mandate and closing down my church is against the united states constitution.  Not to mention that this is not a plaque.

When I was a teenager my parents and siblings all left the house to get one and I told my parents I'm not going.   I think its just weird putting a flu virus into your body.  I rarely get sick.
1310710306688049153 2020-09-29 06:37:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoshuaVats @MaryFass3 I heard that not only do many of these vaccines not work but they also have side affects that cause accelerated aging, dryness of skin and other problems.

1310474615781691392 2020-09-28 15:01:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> This is not only Voter.  They are taking ballots away from Senior Citizens.  It is also Elder Abuse.   What is the FBI doing?  Nothing?
1310473614928441344 2020-09-28 14:57:11 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mirandadevine @Project_Veritas This is also happening in Republican districts in California.  They did it in 2018
1310473383205765126 2020-09-28 14:56:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @michellemalkin @Project_Veritas Why is FBI Director Chris Wray still allowed to keep his job.  He should be fired.  @realDonaldTrump
1310471951589154817 2020-09-28 14:50:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Too many Marxist Democrat Politicians being allowed to break our federal laws.  She should be in jail.
1310470670770339840 2020-09-28 14:45:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CNN How do you stay in business?   You're not a news organization.
1310412376944963584 2020-09-28 10:53:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump They're a bunch of losers
1310332613035323392 2020-09-28 05:36:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @pnjaban Twitter is on a suspending spree again.  Conservatives are being trolled and suspended unjustly for no reason other than they support the current President of the United States. Online Censorship/discrimination is real.
1310328684306264064 2020-09-28 05:21:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @QTAnon1 No
1310326350943674369 2020-09-28 05:12:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GuardFreedom45 @mel_faith1 I only hope she votes accordingly.  Justice Roberts fooled everyone into thinking he was a conservative and look what happened.
1310320871005855744 2020-09-28 04:50:14 +0800 <Surfingcity> If you vote for a Democrat you are an enemy of God.  No excuses.
1310182494365347840 2020-09-27 19:40:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TomWick15 @search4rr Senator Richard blumenthal also lied and said he was a vietnam veteran.   How do these people get elected?
1310176343812833280 2020-09-27 19:15:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @EvanAKilgore Amen!
1310175868392677376 2020-09-27 19:14:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DeAnna4Congress Amen!   They closed our churches.  They denied family from visiting their loved ones while dying in hospitals.  They denied families from attending funerals.  How are these not crimes against humanity?  Open our churches.  Visit the sick.
1310174031723683841 2020-09-27 19:06:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> Regarding your little comment  "well there are so many different ways we can go there"  No there are not different ways.  Jesus Christ spoke out against the luke warm.  He means what he says.  @ShannonBream
1310169576366247937 2020-09-27 18:49:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mommagolfer @JimCaviezel Amen!  Church leaders of all denominations need to stand up and defend the faith.
1310168800352825344 2020-09-27 18:45:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CaviezelJames Thank you for speaking out against religious persecution in USA.   We need more people like you to speak out.
1310168007281238016 2020-09-27 18:42:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChristianPost Our Bishops in USA are appeasing the secular world who hates the church.
1310167712077762560 2020-09-27 18:41:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> I hope all Bishops and Priests are listening to this man because he is 100% speaking truth:  @ocbishop
1310166698452951041 2020-09-27 18:37:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @FrMatthewMary1 @Bishopoftyler @YouTube More laity need to rise up and support the faithful leaders of the church.  This goes for Catholic and protestant.  We must all stand together to defend our faith.    https://t.co/TrfzCFoeqv
1310163240987447296 2020-09-27 18:23:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RannAtious @Bishopoftyler @YouTube All churches, Catholic, protestant need to stand up to religious persecution. I cannot believe in America families were denied the right to visit their dying relatives.   These are crimes against humanity.   OPEN THE CHURCHES,  Visit the Sick.
1310161502318460928 2020-09-27 18:16:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden That's not how the Constitution of the United States works.   Are you really running for President of the United States of America?
1310160639818571777 2020-09-27 18:13:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> Anyone who votes for a Democrat or supports the Democrat party is an enemy of God.
1310158209055768582 2020-09-27 18:03:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> @david24261 @sylviadolores2 @MRibnek @Bishopoftyler @YouTube Melinda is not right and neither are you.   If you vote for a Democrat you are not Catholic.
1310155330551123970 2020-09-27 17:52:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Bishopoftyler @YouTube Thank you for sharing this.  The sheep are definitely being scattered, separated and many gone.  Many sheep still not lost and are standing still not knowing which path to take and waiting for their shepherd to guide them the safe, right direction.  Time is of the essence.
1310145799913746438 2020-09-27 17:14:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr They attack orthodox (real) Catholics. They have been attacking us for years.   Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are not real Catholics.  They are what we call heretics and they do not follow the teachings of the church.  They are Catholic in Name only.
1310145184521355265 2020-09-27 17:12:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> I read it.  No truth.  Pure Lies!
1310143947893739521 2020-09-27 17:07:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SenBlumenthal The Democrat Party is not legitimate.

1310140420924424192 2020-09-27 16:53:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @senjudiciary Forget the "challenging" hearings.  Why do you want to allow Democrats to spew more hate and lies, slander.  Look what they did to Judge Kavanaugh.   Skip the fake hearings. Just vote and confirm her.
1310136533945479168 2020-09-27 16:37:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @oahuheather @pinkbeachlady Same here.
1310134727467171847 2020-09-27 16:30:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Barnes_Law She may not be perfect but she's the best person for the job at this time.
1310127132174024708 2020-09-27 16:00:23 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ACTBrigitte They are going to create counterfeit, duplicate ballots for Biden.  When President Trump wins on election night they will know how many votes to magically come up with.  We need to stop them from cheating  @realDonaldTrump
1310093940838690816 2020-09-27 13:48:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity Regarding your show a few nights ago...  You referred to Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi as "Practicing Catholics"   That is false.  Pelosi and Biden are fake Catholics and are Heretics.  They go against teachings of the faith and should not be receiving Holy Communion.

1310060523023527936 2020-09-27 11:35:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MarkDice Remove their Section 230

1309975644109848576 2020-09-27 05:58:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @prayingmedic Why not October 1st?  Make the hearing last no longer than 2 days and confirm her on October 3rd.
1309972766553067520 2020-09-27 05:47:00 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Nope!  Never even had a flu shot.

1309801088300638209 2020-09-26 18:24:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeyCawbs They are pushing too hard for mail in voting.  They are criminals with power and money so they will create millions of counterfeit ballots and after election night when Trump is the winner they will come up with the additional (uncounted) Biden ballots they need to cheat.
1309796933360205825 2020-09-26 18:08:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeyCawbs What are republicans doing to be proactive and stop the cheating?  You have every right to be worried.
1309795986655473664 2020-09-26 18:04:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Lrihendry @lola_goetz Post office constantly loses my mail or delivers it to my neighbors.  Don't trust them with your vote
1309795169240137730 2020-09-26 18:01:17 +0800 <Surfingcity> @stillgray He's not.  Media is lying again.  Just like in 2016
1309794082256875520 2020-09-26 17:56:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO No more "confirmation hearings". Just bring it to a vote.
1309779220860604421 2020-09-26 16:57:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CouchPotatoSJW @yfcyfcyfc2 Twitter and facebook with help of Google are doing all they can to cheat, lie to American people.  They are suspending Trump supporters daily.  No accountability for these sites.
1309778052331704327 2020-09-26 16:53:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @yfcyfcyfc2 @CouchPotatoSJW They should not have immunity from being sued.   Remove section 230 so they can be sued.  Not only are they censoring but it is also discrimination.
1309772378449129473 2020-09-26 16:30:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @ChristianThink3 @HawleyMO It is not just censorship.  It is also discrimination.  They are allowing liberals and celebrities to say anything yet suspend us just because we support our President....  I don't understand why there is not a huge Class action lawsuit taking place already.  $$$
1309771456583143424 2020-09-26 16:27:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO It is not just Censorship is its also discrimination
1309770939941363712 2020-09-26 16:25:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO I would love to take them to court.  We need lawyers to begin litigation.
1309770635963367424 2020-09-26 16:23:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO Where do we sign up for class action lawsuit?
1309770555906695168 2020-09-26 16:23:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @HawleyMO Thank you for staying on top of this.  Twitter, facebook continue to suspend us for no reason other than supporting our President.  I have proof in the email twitter sent me when they suspended me for 7 days for absolutely no reason other than supporting  @realDonaldTrump
1309768458863665153 2020-09-26 16:15:09 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Ejs77467848 @w_terrence @alx I hope and pray to God that we win the senate, congress and presidency so we can remove section 230 protection from these sites.
1309767653528018944 2020-09-26 16:11:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PATRIOTREBEL9 @realDonaldTrump  Twitter and Facebook are Publishers.  This site is not a platform.  We are not allowed to speak.   Remove their legal section 230 protection.
1309766960985432064 2020-09-26 16:09:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PATRIOTREBEL9 Yet Twitter is allowed to continue with daily suspension of Americans just for supporting their president.  I was suspended for 7 days for replying to Tom Fittons tweet where I criticized Bill Barr for not indicting Comey and others.  Since when is that against the rules?
1309765604149096451 2020-09-26 16:03:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @w_terrence @alx Twitter is suspending conservatives daily for merely having conversations.   This is on purpose.  They are campaigning for Biden.  They  should lose their section 230.
1309763407160078337 2020-09-26 15:55:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DeAnna4Congress They are evil.
1309730803144777728 2020-09-26 13:45:31 +0800 <Surfingcity> @cjtruth Twitter suspended me for 7 days and said I broke rules because I replied to Tom Fitton's tweet and criticized Bill Bar for not indicting.  No rules broken yet they said I broke a rule.  They are just going after all Trump Supporters.  They should lose their section 230.
1309712741427326976 2020-09-26 12:33:45 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Please send a message on Parler.  Give Twitter something to think about
1309712385796575232 2020-09-26 12:32:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> My @ is the same on Parler.   Parler is not as fast as twitter and kind of slow but if we all join it will get better.  If you go on Parler please follow me.    Twitter is not going to stop discriminating against you on here.  Time to learn new system

1309680617647349760 2020-09-26 10:26:06 +0800 <Surfingcity> Is it just me or is anyone else noticing that your tweets disappear after you tweet the President?

1309676859018285056 2020-09-26 10:11:10 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CouchPotatoSJW Why would anyone buy Stock from a company who abuses American Citizens by censoring them, unjustly kicking them off their "platform" because of their beliefs.  They discriminate and censor and they are acting as PUBLISHERS
1309672738177478656 2020-09-26 09:54:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President,  Americans who support you are being suspended on a daily basis on Twitter.  They are not breaking rules.  Twitter is acting like its being done due to "mistakes"  If one appeals they just lose the person in the system.  Please remove section 230
1309670111033225216 2020-09-26 09:44:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @CouchPotatoSJW Twitter is suspending President Trump supporters on a daily basis for no reason.  If you chose to appeal you will be basically permanently suspended because they "accidentally" lose them in the system.  Pure Censorship.   No accident.
1309600838990479360 2020-09-26 05:09:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We stopped watching 90% of Fox News and only watch a couple hours in the evening.
1309439772314619906 2020-09-25 18:29:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TDufon We've been hearing about it for years.  Nothing ever happens.   I won't hold my breath.
1309406699845902336 2020-09-25 16:17:39 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump We need to see people being arrested and sentenced for Voter Fraud.  Voter fraud is illegal and laws need to be enforced.
1309401535386771461 2020-09-25 15:57:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump People who commit voter fraud should be arrested.  What is being done?  If people know they can get away with voter fraud they are going to do it.
1309400797638082561 2020-09-25 15:54:12 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump What are we doing to prevent this?  Are we being proactive or are we just sitting by and watching it happen?
1309290958102511616 2020-09-25 08:37:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @shwood Is it as bad as the flu?
1309239077380603905 2020-09-25 05:11:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please remove section 230 protections from Social Media sites.  They are suspending us for no reason other than we support you.
1309222893067202560 2020-09-25 04:07:16 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MattWolking Who discarded the votes?   They need to be arrested.   Need to begin enforcing the laws.
1309213421540274176 2020-09-25 03:29:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DavidJHarrisJr @ConservativeKER I've been saying this for years.  I wish our Government would stop allowing the "press" to lie to the American people.  Isn't it treason?  Aren't there laws against Media constantly lying?
1309211509155741698 2020-09-25 03:22:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @DeAnna4Congress The left politicians are inciting violence and these social media sites are assisting them while suspending conservative, moderate Americans.
1309210826390208512 2020-09-25 03:19:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TheJusticeDept @POTUS @WhiteHouse In the meantime Twitter and facebook are censoring, suspending anyone who supports the United States President.   They are allowing the left to do anything in order to destroy our democracy and bring in socialism/communism.
1309206137955205120 2020-09-25 03:00:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> Twitter suspended my account for 7 days for absolutely nothing. (no rules were broken) It will happen to you too.   They are going after Trump supporters, conservatives and moderates because of the election.  @realDonaldTrump   Please remove section 230 protection.

Democrats are really good pathological liars.
1306530840810156032 2020-09-17 17:50:01 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KarluskaP Poor forest management, neglect of clearing dead trees, underbrush and arson are the reason for the fires in California.  These Democrat Socialist are constantly using tragedies to twist truth and lie for political gain.

The Media we have now works for the Socialist Democrat Communist Party and they are a propaganda Lie Machine for Pelosi and the Democrats.  Freedom of Press does not mean Freedom for them to LIE and deceive.  It's treason!

1306411816117923840 2020-09-17 09:57:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JoeBiden The "virus" is not Covid-19, its you and the Democrat Party.
1306409769867948032 2020-09-17 09:48:55 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity   Accidentally left the TV on after Tucker Carlson only to hear Hannity ask Lindsey Graham baby questions.   Took Lindsey this long only to say he appreciates James Comey coming in to speak.   What a joke.  Turned channel.
1306376833173053440 2020-09-17 07:38:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @annytwelve @SpeakerPelosi No, i'm reading Nancy Pelosi's bill.     Go spread lies and deceit somewhere else.

The Bill that the Democrat were pushing had billions of dollars in it that had NOTHING to do with Covid-19 Stimulus check or payroll loans.   Stop lying.  Nancy Pelosi is a disgusting person.
1306370716942569472 2020-09-17 07:13:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi Americans are losing their homes, business, live savings because of you and Governor Gavin Newsom.  You caused their mental health disorders.
1306370429892792321 2020-09-17 07:12:36 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi You don't care about mental health of Americans.  You proved this by destroying their business, savings and  refusing to pass a Stimulus Bill because you are GREEDY  Stop tweeting your BS and stay inside and eat your $15.00 dollar ice cream bars from your $40,000.00 refrigerator.

1306368790968414211 2020-09-17 07:06:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump People have already lost all their savings, small business permanently bankrupted.  They were waiting for 2nd Stimulus but it never came thanks to greedy Nancy Pelosi and Democrats.  @SpeakerPelosi  Pass the damned bill this week or stop talking about it.
1306365936094474240 2020-09-17 06:54:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @dbongino @TikiTiQue President Trump said he is "monitoring the situation about 2 years go.  Why hasn't he signed an executive removing their Section 230 legal protections?  @realDonaldTrump  This will get worse closer to election.  They are censoring all of us.
1306345009810006016 2020-09-17 05:31:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Suspend their paychecks.  Why are we paying them?
1306172428926689280 2020-09-16 18:05:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KamalaHarris Liar!  CDC finally came out with the numbers and it's only 9,700 deaths from covid and the Democrats are responsible for allowing China to import Covid into the country.

1306002752066056192 2020-09-16 06:51:35 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KarlEspo Yet Twitter is ok with their far left celebrities and antifa threatening people and they don't censor them.
1305979579752828928 2020-09-16 05:19:30 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi Nancy Pelosi only cares about Nancy Pelosi.     Nancy Pelosi caused the Covid Relief bill to stall by putting all kinds of Pork in it giving money to places that have nothing to do with Covid.   She's a fraud.   Gets her hair done illegally while lecturing about Covid rules.

We don't have separate drinking fountains etc.   Whatever racism is left in this country comes out of the Democrat Party.
1305765957638348800 2020-09-15 15:10:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @PasReport @MMMcC54 The Left is going to cheat by counterfeiting and duplicating millions of Ballots for Biden.  They are going to cause Mass confusion on election night.   It needs to be stopped now before it happens.  @realDonaldTrump

1305754448027762688 2020-09-15 14:24:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GovernorTomWolf Influenza is more dangerous than Covid.  Are you going to make masks and social distancing, business closure, religious persecution your new normal forever?  You are just a Communist.

1305750223545749511 2020-09-15 14:08:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GovernorTomWolf  The Communist Governor who hates Freedom and hates the US Constitution wants to appeal because he insists on being a communist dictator.
1305748523950854145 2020-09-15 14:01:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GovernorTomWolf  A victory for Freedom!   A victory for the United States Constitution.   There will be more court victories to come and Democrat Communist will all be voted out of office.  They should get no pensions!
1305746411112210437 2020-09-15 13:52:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @GovSisolak Department of Justice needs to see that Governors, and all Government workers who cheat are arrested and imprisoned for voter fraud.

1305435447250747392 2020-09-14 17:17:19 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GregoryEck You notice they won't do that if physically fit MEN are sitting at those tables.    Cowards!

1305433489982984192 2020-09-14 17:09:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 It's unhealthy wearing masks.  You are blocking oxygen intake.  I notice it as soon as I put one on.
1305432928373977089 2020-09-14 17:07:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 I put one on just so I can get into the Grocery store without being kicked out or harassed.  Sometimes I don't wear it and stick it in my pocket and have it hanging out.

1305431512410542081 2020-09-14 17:01:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why are these companies allowed to assist Domestic Terrorism?  @realDonaldTrump   Where is the DOJ, FBI ? Why are these "business" Corporations not being closed down?
1305430427625111553 2020-09-14 16:57:22 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr That's horrible.  He should be arrested.

1305429151298383872 2020-09-14 16:52:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @mikeandersonsr @realDonaldTrump Trump rallies are PEACEFUL PROTESTS.  Democrats should love that.
1305428768312320007 2020-09-14 16:50:46 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 What pisses me off is that people are so stupid they are believing this hoax!   Still wearing masks, still afraid to get closer than 6 feet to another human being.  This is just total BS.  When do people say ENOUGH?

1305424706648989696 2020-09-14 16:34:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @OD_ant @MaryWarrick18 Which is why the Democrats plan on cheating by using mail in ballots and counterfeiting, duplicating millions of ballots with votes for Biden.

1305246024571600902 2020-09-14 04:44:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KurtSchlichter @JoeBiden Because they are both Domestic Terrorist groups and Joe Biden and the Democrats support Domestic Terrorism.

1305072404897525760 2020-09-13 17:14:43 +0800 <Surfingcity> @selfdeclaredref @BuckeyeProud20 How did the BLM rioters know that these officers would be transported to the hospital?
1305071946363674625 2020-09-13 17:12:53 +0800 <Surfingcity> Nancy Pelosi is a vile, selfish woman who only cares about what's in it for her.  Nancy Pelosi purposely saw that the Bill to help American people would fail.  Vote Republican if you want to feed your children.
1305066846748512257 2020-09-13 16:52:37 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealJamesWoods @GoVols37872 Thank God!
1304948017380827136 2020-09-13 09:00:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Anthony Fauci is not even a practicing Physician.  He also failed to let Americans know that Hydroxychloroquine is a life saving drug.  How much longer do we have to listen to this Quack?
1304896204229111809 2020-09-13 05:34:33 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Pray for rain.
1304896079062736897 2020-09-13 05:34:03 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump peter strzok should not be going on talk shows.  He should be in jail.  Same for James Comey.    Why is our DOJ allowing these criminals to write books and go on talk shows?
1304894728178003968 2020-09-13 05:28:41 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump @LizMacDonaldFOX @realKTMcFarland These "Democrats" are Criminals.  They don't care about laws and they won't stop at destroying evidence by wiping cell phone data.   They are now moving on to Cheating in the election via US Mail...  Are we going to allow them to cheat?  Please have police at every polling place.
1304893441394880512 2020-09-13 05:23:34 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump And now the same Left Socialist Criminals who were part of the Mueller Scam are working on a new scam called Vote Fraud.  Mail in voting.   People mailing in duplicate ballots.  Ballots being "lost" and destroyed.
1304708063643930624 2020-09-12 17:06:57 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 I agree.

1304528525693775872 2020-09-12 05:13:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Sign an executive order and help the American People.   Democrats are the ones who pushed for closing business and destroying peoples lives.    Fix it without them.
1304527897101697024 2020-09-12 05:11:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi  Nancy Pelosi refuses to pass any Stimulus package bill unless it has billions going to causes that have nothing to do with Covid relief.    Pelosi says  "its all or nothing"     If you wonder why you are not receiving help you can blame Nancy Pelosi and Democrats.

They did not care who they chose to be the Presidential Candidate because they know they have to cheat.   Mail in Ballots, duplicate ballots, counterfeit ballots.  Overload the system, cause chaos and cheat to win...
1303272499262582784 2020-09-08 18:02:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @TodayWithJulius @sea5 Covid is BS!  They are using Covid to steal the election.  Election Interference.  Left want to bombard our system with duplicate, counterfeit ballots for Biden. They have done this locally in the past with mail and now they want to do it nationally. @realDonaldTrump   Stop them!
1303270886774943745 2020-09-08 17:56:07 +0800 <Surfingcity> Why does Kamala Harris walk like a man?  She dresses like a man and acts like a man.  Is this her new look?
1303270660072861697 2020-09-08 17:55:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @KamalaHarris LOL  You won't win unless you succeed at cheating with the millions of counterfeit votes you plan on using.  I think you are all going to get caught.

Some days we don't get our mail for two or three days in a row, not even advertisements.    When that happens I know something is up.   We always get ads
1302754901659799552 2020-09-07 07:45:47 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump  President Trump needs to sign and executive order and stop this nonsense.  If people want to vote they can get off their butt and go to the polls.  They can go to Walmart but they can't go vote?

If Americans don't start standing up to Socialism they won't have computers to tweet on because their money will be gone and they will all be living in tents.

Weather forecasters predicting non stop excessive heat for the next 2 weeks.   All we need is 1 decent rainfall to stop this.   Pray for Rain in California!

They support taking the life of preborn and born innocent human babies.   This is pure evil and so are the people who vote for these evil politicians who support it.

He also never asked Graham tough questions regarding his "all talk, no action" history.  Also Hannity constantly interrupts guest right when they are about to announce something Big.  He likes to hear himself.

You just got caught breaking the law and sneaking into a Hair Salon with no mask and you have the nerve to tweet this BS!  At the least you should lay off the tweets for a while after getting caught on video breaking Covid rules.

Lecturing us on wearing masks and then you break the law and sneak into a hair salon!  You are such a fake in every way!  Shame on you.   Retire!

1302171244633104385 2020-09-05 17:06:32 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Soh1006 @realDonaldTrump President Trump needs to remind Americans what she did with the 2nd Corona Virus Bill, stuffing pork in it for her agenda not Americans who need the money to buy groceries, pay bills.    She eats $14.00 ice cream bars from her $40,000 refrigerator, breaking laws to get hair done.

Are they for real or has Twitter suspended them?  Are they a real group?  Are patriots organizing and is their a plan in place to protect our freedoms?   Where are the townehalls?
1302169826866073601 2020-09-05 17:00:54 +0800 <Surfingcity> @liquidlaugh Why hasn't President Trump fired FBI Director Christopher Wray yet?   Wray is a snake and he's not doing his job.  @realDonaldTrump
1302169113893117952 2020-09-05 16:58:04 +0800 <Surfingcity> @realDonaldTrump Please remind Americans that Nancy Pelosi is the reason they are not receiving a 2nd Corona Virus Stimulus check.     She took away American Jobs, destroyed American business and then she purposely saw to it that the Stimulus check bill would fail.
1302167755278278657 2020-09-05 16:52:40 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi  The reason you will not be receiving a 2nd Stimulus check after the Left destroyed your jobs and business is because Nancy Pelosi Refused to bring forth a clean Stimulus Bill.     Nancy Pelosi wants you to suffer financially.

He needs to not worry about Media also.   Time to use power is now not later.
1302166600821272576 2020-09-05 16:48:05 +0800 <Surfingcity> @SpeakerPelosi You Nancy Pelosi denied a 2nd stimulus check for the American people because you crammed the bill with enormous funding for things that had NOTHING to do with Corona virus relief.  You set the bill up to purposely Fail because your nothing but a Selfish Hypocrite.

I kept the mask in my pocket just in case there was a scene because I need groceries but I'm not going to make it easy for them.   They  will have to refuse to sell me my groceries first.
1302146914402533378 2020-09-05 15:29:51 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump My prediction is they are going to manufacture 100s of thousands of fake ballots...    They did this in Republican Counties in California and they are now going to do it nationwide.   President should sign an Executive order to stop this.  @realDonaldTrump
1302146403116834817 2020-09-05 15:27:49 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Yes,  no more absentee ballot voting either.   I'm taking my ballot to the voting booth and so are my friends.    We've had enough of the cheating.

The people who believe masks work should protect them from those not wearing a mask.    All of this is BS and Left is using health scare to help Joe Biden get elected.
1302143334408830976 2020-09-05 15:15:38 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump We need to win the House, Senate and Presidency and when we do we need to put pressure on the Republicans to arrest the corrupt Left Politicians who are breaking almost every federal law you can think of.  President needs to use all his power.
1302142102965350403 2020-09-05 15:10:44 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Do we have a list of companies who are giving money to BLM Antifa?  We need to send out reminders every day of who these companies are.   They are giving money to violent Criminals.

They had no right to close down churches over a virus.  Constitution protects right to religious freedom

1300652957562671104 2020-09-01 12:33:24 +0800 <Surfingcity> @MrAndyNgo So are they rioting because they are all above the law and police cannot defend themselves?
1300652599234887680 2020-09-01 12:31:59 +0800 <Surfingcity> @OldGeek64 @philipsknowlton @EagleEyeFlyer @BreitbartNews Not if hundreds of thousands of ballots are counterfeit through the US Post office who works for the Democrat Party.  Pray that their plan is soon exposed before election.  Ask God to expose this soon so we can stop it.

1300649137189183488 2020-09-01 12:18:13 +0800 <Surfingcity> @JordanSchachtel @KurtSchlichter @CalebJHull Are you referring to November 4th after the election?  Is that when the Media and the hypocrites Democrats will no longer care?
1300648913674752001 2020-09-01 12:17:20 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton @OldGeek64 @EagleEyeFlyer @BreitbartNews I wonder if it has gotten so bad that men and women are so cold and evil, they no longer care about the future of their own children?

1300648193860931584 2020-09-01 12:14:28 +0800 <Surfingcity> @BannedDeplorab1 If ignorant people vote for the Democrats we won't have police in this country.  Women and children will not be safe.  Men will not be safe.  Nobody will be safe.   You won't be able to call the police for help.
1300647691450376193 2020-09-01 12:12:29 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton @OldGeek64 @EagleEyeFlyer @BreitbartNews Will Americans be like sheep if the Democrats succeed with their plan to use the Post Office to cast thousands of counterfeit votes across the country?  Will they roll over and accept this and live in Socialist communism?   This is where its going.
1300646400863027204 2020-09-01 12:07:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> @philipsknowlton @OldGeek64 @EagleEyeFlyer @BreitbartNews They must want illegal labor for their companies and they figure they can just use their wealth and go to another country and live lavishly while regular Americans suffer under Socialism.
1300646071161380865 2020-09-01 12:06:02 +0800 <Surfingcity> @OldGeek64 @philipsknowlton @EagleEyeFlyer @BreitbartNews They are going to cheat with the help of the US Post office and use hundreds of thousands of counterfeit ballots to elect Joe Biden illegally.  Social Media will then disconnect all of us.  There seems to be no plans in place to prevent any of this or deal with it.  Very scary
1300645045377277952 2020-09-01 12:01:58 +0800 <Surfingcity> @RealJamesWoods Why isn't she arrested for inciting violence and aiding and abetting Domestic Terrorists?   Where is the FBI?  Military? Why are they allowed to get away with inciting violence?
1300644582846205953 2020-09-01 12:00:08 +0800 <Surfingcity> @OldGeek64 @philipsknowlton @EagleEyeFlyer @BreitbartNews The Democrat Socialist have billionaires like Soros to pay to destroy our country and bring it to communism.

Where are all the powerful, wealthy Republican Patriots who have power to assist in taking our country back?   Don't they care about the future of their children?  Why is this happening?
1300640853476564992 2020-09-01 11:45:18 +0800 <Surfingcity> @michellemalkin Will the National Guard just kneel again to the rioters?  Perhaps the Marines or the Army need to take care of this?
1300638321094270976 2020-09-01 11:35:15 +0800 <Surfingcity> @are_washington Absolutely!
1300633680516272129 2020-09-01 11:16:48 +0800 <Surfingcity> @Matthew_4_Trump Should have been done 3 months ago.  Lets just hope they don't kneel to the rioters.
1300628556213411840 2020-09-01 10:56:26 +0800 <Surfingcity> @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Wow!  Laura Ingraham, you hit the ball out of the park tonight!  Great job interviewing the President tonight.  You asked all the questions we were hoping you'd ask!!
1300609539260125184 2020-09-01 09:40:52 +0800 <Surfingcity> @GlamGabber All the major fake news stations @CBSNews @NBCNews @abcnews @MSNBC @CNN had her photograph on every TV in the world but when a Conservative is murdered by a Left Wing radical Democrat Antifa Group they hide it.   Truly disgusting.    Thank you Mr. President for your tweet for Jay
1300603617854943232 2020-09-01 09:17:21 +0800 <Surfingcity> In Charlottesville when a woman lost her life by being run over the Media was broadcasting this every day on every news station in the world but where is the Media Coverage for Jay?
1300601752043925504 2020-09-01 09:09:56 +0800 <Surfingcity> @seanhannity Sean Hannity tonight did not mention that the Trump supporter that was shot by Antifa is now deceased.   Sean just said he was shot.
