1343567932119511041 2020-12-28 22:42:11 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Tell any historian, anthropologist or other academic there isn't a unique culture to Britain and they'd laugh in your face.
1343567904298688514 2020-12-28 22:42:05 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 I'm not sure you realise how retarded this view is.  Saying Brits don't have a unique and distinct culture is just false. It's as ridiculous as saying that America doesn't exist.
1343566106955493377 2020-12-28 22:34:56 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 There have in fact been MANY revivals to keep these native Traditions and culture alive against the tide of Modernism.  Eg one of my favourite singers is Peter Bellamy who led a revival of English folk songs.  You're just speaking nonsense.
1343565838167764993 2020-12-28 22:33:52 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Also this isn't true. Many ancient techniques are still used in rural Britain by farmers, gamekeepers and just general natives trying to keep their culture alive.  And things like festivals, songs etc are still a part of our culture. We still celebrate it.  .
1343564666988064770 2020-12-28 22:29:13 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Neither do the Native Americans. Most NA live in modern societies.  This isn't an argument.
1343564486272315394 2020-12-28 22:28:30 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 You say this yet fail to respond when challenged.  It seems a bit funny to go all over Twitter posting the same comment hundreds of times when you can't defend the position that Brits don't fit that criteria.  I'll keep asking everytime you copy and paste the same comment then.
1343562741097914371 2020-12-28 22:21:34 +0800 <OrStout> @spenzbill @HumanRi56 But this doesn't fit Saz narrative so she pretends they don't exist.
1343562636965900289 2020-12-28 22:21:09 +0800 <OrStout> @spenzbill @HumanRi56 We actually have much MORE and OLDER historical sources for deep cultural connection to the land than Native Americans do.  We have plenty of ancient British sources on bushcraft, medicinal recipes, other techniques using the land, songs, poetry, festivals and other Traditions.
1343560698329227270 2020-12-28 22:13:27 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 @spenzbill Why don't you think British populations apply under that definition?

1343185856572645378 2020-12-27 21:23:58 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Except you couldn't counter what I said. You brought up having a connection to the land as part of the culture, which the native British cultures 100% have.   You can't provide a counter argument because what you're saying is ludicrous nonsense.
1343184795770232832 2020-12-27 21:19:45 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 @spenzbill And under every definition you've provided, we have all shown the British peoples apply to it.

1342927591062335489 2020-12-27 04:17:42 +0800 <OrStout> @MartinH93013115 If YES: then how are you any different to left-wing, progressive globalists who want to destroy any part of our culture and tradition that doesn't suit their modern ideology?  If NO: then you're not in favour of the fox hunting ban.
1342927572485754881 2020-12-27 04:17:38 +0800 <OrStout> @MartinH93013115 I think you've been led astray by nonsense media tbh.  No matter what you think about it the simple question remains:  Do you think taking part in any of our indigenous culture and traditions should be a criminal act and punishable by the state?
1342925014279065604 2020-12-27 04:07:28 +0800 <OrStout> @cliveswinsco Am I supposed to care? Good.  And linking me to hunt sabs? Lol hunt sabs are violent terrorists who abuse women.  Get off my feed, anti white scumbag.
1342924541643935745 2020-12-27 04:05:35 +0800 <OrStout> @AidanKiely2 @Scruton_Quotes .... then why aren't you worried about thousands of animals dying the same way in the wild?  The reality is there is no difference between shooting a fox and letting a hound kill it.  There are zero valid arguments against fox hunting other than a weak appeal to emotion.
1342924496458686467 2020-12-27 04:05:24 +0800 <OrStout> @AidanKiely2 @Scruton_Quotes And yet the point remains no matter what faux outrage you act out.  Thousands of animals die in the exact same way every day.  If Fox Hunting was so innately, hideously cruel that it warrants punishing it (a part of my ancient culture and tradition) by the state....

Your original position was English culture didn't have any connection to the land.  2) So? This is caused by a divergence from Tradition towards modernism.  Most Native Americans also live in modern societies.   Null point.

Real British cultures and completely and utterly connected to the land.  The NHS is not part of our culture, it is a MODERN institution.  Most modern Native Americans also use modern USA healthcare. This doesn't mean they don't have a cultural medicinal....

The point of indigenous status to protect the oldest population and their culture and traditions.  Making its so it is only the very first hunan population, even if that population doesn't exist anymore (eh the WHG), completely invalidates the real

I mean as in out population doesn't follow them.

No of course not. You'd still think they were indigenous because they're the first surviving population with a clear ethnic and cultural identity.

It's utterly ridiculous to say the Maori should be afforded indigenous rights despite being in New Zealand 700 years whilst the British aren't indigenous despite being there 4500 years.  And you know that definition is ridiculous.

So you don't think the Sami are indigenous then? They wouldn't apply under you strict definition.

The Anglo-Saxons took the land for force.  This is an argument for recognising an indigenous population and defending them.

The Sami are far more mixed than Northern Europeans and the Native Americans were made up of three different migrations.  Yet you can easily identify them as indigenous groups right?

The English are indigenous to England because they're the first surviving inhabitants with a clear ethnic and cultural identity.  The Neolithics don't exist as a separate population anymore. They were mixed into the Bell Beaker folk.

When in reality these are basic ideas almost everyone understands  I've explained everything you're asking multiple times

1340037496122580994 2020-12-19 04:53:30 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs I've already said this.  https://t.co/sLlqkUKo1C
1340020328337207296 2020-12-19 03:45:17 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs Good for them. I have nothing against them.
1340020004025188353 2020-12-19 03:43:59 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs Our existing English population still exists with our clear genetic and cultural identity. And as that group we have a right to identify as a indigenous population. Just as the British Celts had a right and a right to reject demographic replacement by the Anglo-Saxons.
1340019974744772609 2020-12-19 03:43:53 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs The Anglo-Saxons only became part of the indigenous population because they affected ALL of the population over a momentous change and then resided there for centuries with a homogeneous ethnic and cultural identity.
1340019937616736259 2020-12-19 03:43:44 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs No you really didn't. You made another pea brained point that ignores logic to try and further your agenda.  People can be properly indigenous and I've already explained this.  No foreigners can be indigenous whilst there is an existing population.
1340001179649097728 2020-12-19 02:29:11 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs You're part non indigenous.
1340001105120530433 2020-12-19 02:28:54 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs Yes exactly. The AS were invaders. They were not welcomed. They fought for that land against the natives.
1339998587816718347 2020-12-19 02:18:53 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs 1) No. I don't. That's the average definition I have always heard. The first population who have a clear genetic and cultural identity.  2) No it doesn't. A foreigner in Britain can't be indigenous because the first surviving population exists.
1339992354221121538 2020-12-19 01:54:07 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs 2) They're the same people. The BB and AS merged just like the WHG, Neolithic farmers and Beaker folk.  I know you understand this so why are you asking?
1339992335120273408 2020-12-19 01:54:03 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs 1) It's not my definition. Most people would consider indigenous peoples to be the first surviving population.  We are that.  Under such a definition the English apply as indigenous OR no group on earth does. Not the Sami or Native Americans.
1339990187179438080 2020-12-19 01:45:31 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs And   B) The AS have been here a long time, around 1500 years, as a clearly defined ethnic and cultural group.  The Native Americans were made up of three different migrations and the Sami are far more mixed than NW Europeans. But you can identify them easily right? It's not hard
1339989892030410753 2020-12-19 01:44:20 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs No. It's actually REALLY simple. You're just asking inane questions about the genetic history of Britain to make it seem like you have a point.  The BB and AS decended English are indigenous because:  A) We have a significant amount of legacy to the indigenous BB.
1339985896653918210 2020-12-19 01:28:28 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs have trace elements of previous groups such as Neolithic farmers, WHG etc.  So I have no idea what you mean when you're asking after these populations. They have merged with the Beaker folk.  And no that doesn't mean we aren't indigenous.
1339985786956091394 2020-12-19 01:28:01 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs When I say "Iron Age British" I just mean the population there at the Iron Age before AS arrived. Should have just said pre- Anglo-Saxon since you're getting so confused.  There are no separate populations. They have merged. The Bell Beaker folk who came to Britain...

1339973271173918720 2020-12-19 00:38:18 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs The populations prior to the Bell Beaker genetic replacement don't exist as a separate population anymore.  Groups like WHG were mostly wiped out with some assimilation into the population.
1339972743677304837 2020-12-19 00:36:12 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs The Anglo-Saxons themselves arrived here over 1500 years. That's more than double the Maori have been in NZ around 700 years.  There you go.
1339972722647048194 2020-12-19 00:36:07 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs 2) English are indigenous because they have been here as a homogeneous, clearly seen ethnic and cultural group with legacy back to the Bell Beaker genetic replacement about 4500 years ago.  There is no separate population.
1339972684604723202 2020-12-19 00:35:58 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs 1) Actually I've already perfectly explained who the indigenous English are if you read my both my comments.  Your attempts to feign ignorance and meaningless rhetoric don't change than I'm afraid.
1339967290058694656 2020-12-19 00:14:31 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs The indigenous English are the population I stated. A small amount of migration eg some French during the medieval period and the small amount of Huguenots do not change that. They didn't have a significant effect on the population.
1339967229585203204 2020-12-19 00:14:17 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs Maybe because you're pretending to be ignorant because you think you've got some really clever, groundbreaking point coming.  You don't. I've heard this a million times. It's all really quite boring.

1339667747786137607 2020-12-18 04:24:15 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs They know what they're talking about? Pope didn't even realise WHG weren't Africans.  They had no counter arguments to anything we said.  Even if you deny the existence of an indigenous English population, to suggest they came of well in that exchange is a bizarre thing to claim.

Native Americans or Sami wouldn't be indigenous then. As I pointed out to her the Native Americans were made up of three different migrations and the Sami are very genetically mixed.

They only maintain the indigenous status of non-whites because they know that is the leftists only selling point: that they seem "kind" and "anti-racist".  .
1339524728231440384 2020-12-17 18:55:57 +0800 <OrStout> @D__2__1 @WilliamCassing1 @SurvivetheJive Yes spot on!  People like Tom Booth are clever. They know under the real definition of indigenous we white Europeans fit just like the Sami, Native Americans, Maori or any other group.  I suspect:  The real reason is they deny the status of indigenous all together:
1339520598054154240 2020-12-17 18:39:32 +0800 <OrStout> @D__2__1 @WilliamCassing1 @SurvivetheJive You guessed it. I just addressed this actually.  The line of argument they were taking switched suddenly throughout the thread.   https://t.co/wEcfyUlu6c
1339513571152162818 2020-12-17 18:11:36 +0800 <OrStout> @SurvivetheJive
1339513432001966080 2020-12-17 18:11:03 +0800 <OrStout> 5) complexion.  Ok fine but this makes no sense. WHG complexion would have no bearing on what makes a group indigenous. So why was it brought up?  These people are not arguing in good faith.
1339513395486322689 2020-12-17 18:10:55 +0800 <OrStout> 4) Their entire stance is a mess of contradictions.  Rachel originally claimed that the original inhabitants of Britain were black. When I pointed out black is a genetic term meaning Sub Subharan African - and thus WHG aren't. Then I am told she was only referring to skin
1339513317950451713 2020-12-17 18:10:36 +0800 <OrStout> 3) If they believed this then why was Rachels argument about aDNA analysis being supported at first?
1339513236526428163 2020-12-17 18:10:17 +0800 <OrStout> 2).....the category of indigenous.  And then suddenly the entire argument serves by all three of them. It's no longer about ethnicity but about these groups relationship to European colonialism.  This is completely changing the goal posts.
1339513121988366336 2020-12-17 18:09:49 +0800 <OrStout> 1) Booth's response is a complete switch of the goalposts and reveals a lot here.  Rachel's original argument was that the British can't be indigenous because of aDNA analysis.  We point out this make no sense, as by this logic, groups like the Sami also wouldn't fit ....
1339505171597053952 2020-12-17 17:38:14 +0800 <OrStout> @BAJRjobs Cry more.
1339496952283709440 2020-12-17 17:05:34 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @SurvivetheJive @Tess_Machling @preshitorian Oh right so you deny the real concept of indigenous?  I'm sure the Native Americans, Maori and Sami would love if you told them "you're just a nation of immigrants. If not for colonialism you shouldn't have your indigenous rights recognised".
1339493964404183045 2020-12-17 16:53:42 +0800 <OrStout> @SurvivetheJive @Boothicus @Tess_Machling @preshitorian Lol I've told them this and none of them have been able to provide a counter argument other than Booth going "eh but we don't have much legacy from the HG".  Such a dumb argument. By their own standards the Sami aren't indigenous. Yet they never said that? It's only ever whites.
1339337637174374400 2020-12-17 06:32:31 +0800 <OrStout> Imagine pushing this. Literally encouraging young women to be whores and degrade themselves.  This genuinely vile. She's a psychopath.
1339243418342617088 2020-12-17 00:18:07 +0800 <OrStout> 2) Also interesting how their conclusion is always "everyone is indigenous apart from whites".  This is just blatantly anti-white.
1339241855461060608 2020-12-17 00:11:54 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @preshitorian The original inhabitants of Britain were closest to white Europeans. And yes white Europeans have a direct link to the WHG.   The Bell Beaker genetic replacement was a 90% genetic replacement, not 100%.
1339241671977033731 2020-12-17 00:11:11 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @preshitorian Literally everything you're saying is meaningless.  WHG are like white Europeans. They are genetically very similar compared to the difference between Europeans and Africans. Fact.   The fact there is some genetic difference between WHG and white Europeans doesn't change that.
1339240633660305415 2020-12-17 00:07:03 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @preshitorian 2) Accept she refused to acknowledge that WHG weren't African.
1339240611979948032 2020-12-17 00:06:58 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @preshitorian 1) Talking about skin pigmentation is a dumb thing to do when discussing the idea of being "indigenous". Theres no link there. That makes no sense.  So ok maybe she was talking about skin pigmentation but in which case her argument in the original tweet is completely incoherent
1339213475978031105 2020-12-16 22:19:08 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @preshitorian You know full well that generally if you refer to someone as "black" in genetic terms it means Sub-Sahran African.  WHG were not SSA.  It's dishonest.  Only Europeans have a direct link to the WHG.
1339213202945679360 2020-12-16 22:18:03 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @preshitorian They are. They plot very close to Europeans on a PCA. They plot no where near an African.
1339179531870081024 2020-12-16 20:04:15 +0800 <OrStout> @Boothicus @preshitorian Why are you not calling her out Tom? She claimed the original inhabitants of Britain were black.  You know that's false. WHG were not black. They were genetically like white Europeans.  You worked on Cheddar Man so I know you know what WHG are.  Why are you not correcting her?

1339118676033888259 2020-12-16 16:02:26 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian @preshitorian According to Rachel neither the Sami or the Native Americans are indigenous.  The Sami are FAR, FAR more mixed than Northern Europeans.  And the Native Americans were made up of THREE different migrations.  This means neither fit her standards.  https://t.co/o4oyY49pA8

As I told you 4 hours ago. Black is a genetic term normally referring to Sub Saharan Africans.  WHG were not SSA.   WHG were white European. Their skin complexion does not change that.

1338916425109532674 2020-12-16 02:38:46 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian 1) We don't know how dark his skin was so it's meaningless to bring it up.  The recent Cheddar Man reconstruction, which I'm guessing is what you're thinking of, is what could technically be possible, not what he definitely looked like.
1338912751662600198 2020-12-16 02:24:10 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian Intimidate. Where did I do that?  Why are you lying?
1338912594392920064 2020-12-16 02:23:32 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian WHG were not Africans. They were white Europeans with a slightly darker complexion.   They plot like white Europeans on a PCA.  https://t.co/zPLJIxBjVJ

1338907840803729411 2020-12-16 02:04:39 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian So you post false information and then say "who cares" when I prove you wrong?  Wow you're not presenting yourself well. Pretty dishonest thing to do. I hope you don't write your academic papers in this way!  Good to see you concede I'm right though.
1338906408687968256 2020-12-16 01:58:58 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian WHG were genetically white Europeans. Only white Europeans have ancestry and are directly linked to the WHG.  This is pretty basic stuff. I shouldn't have to be explaining this too you.
1338906315293331459 2020-12-16 01:58:35 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian You do realise white and black are genetic terms right?  "Black" means Sub-Sahran African in genetic terms.  If you had an albino African is that person then white? No they're still black.

1338903295872688129 2020-12-16 01:46:36 +0800 <OrStout> @preshitorian @JamesWindsorGI They were white. The very first inhabitants of Britain were the WHG.  WHG were white Europeans genetically, even if they had a slightly darker complexion.  I have no idea where you're getting this idea from. No genetic study supports your view.

That would be seen as distasteful and sad.

Too them, if they can achieve independence, then they are breaking away from the "Imperialist, Fascist British Empire" and will return to the glorious socialist utopia.
1338214116801048578 2020-12-14 04:08:02 +0800 <OrStout> @BigRonReturns @SpergFestive One reason is that they are completely deluded. They have this complety made up narrative of  Britain.  They've been brainwashed (because they're dim people) into believing that the Tory's represent some kind of thin line between Fascism.

But it's not connected to sacrifice. They didn't sacrifice people just to make skull racks lol.

Its a quote with zero context saying that maybe some of them were captives for sacrifice.  And yes I do know better than this archaeologist because that's nonsense.

Large scale human sacrifice was only an Aztec Empire thing that was largely done to control people.  It does not represent Meso-American societies as a whole. Sacrifice normally was generally small scale and done too prisoners of war etc.

Meso-American civilizations as a whole however were incredibly based. They were societies that embodied Traditional principles and honoured religion, castes and aristocracy.

Do you actually have any idea what I'm talking about?  2) Actually we can't that easily. If we found houses from say, 850AD in England we might have no idea if it was Anglo Saxon or "Viking".

Think about what you just said in relation to your first response...  And the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fought amongst themselves. Yet Bede attests to a common English identity.

The "Vikings" were genetically and culturally the same as the Anglo-Saxons.  The Normans were also v. similar but left little genetic trace.   What you're saying isn't a substantial answer. I've explained this. By your own logic no indigenous group in the world exists
1334597298454732800 2020-12-04 04:36:06 +0800 <OrStout> @NeasaLee @bluberrysoda @JonixpiSy @tfirstelizabeth @AnEnglishGent1 Nonsense and I've already explained this in the thread.  The Sami are far more mixed then us yet are considered indigenous.  The Native Americans were made up of 3 migrations yet are considered indigenous.

No different to the few migrations that formed the Native Americans.
1334596678775615489 2020-12-04 04:33:38 +0800 <OrStout> @NeasaLee @bluberrysoda @JonixpiSy @tfirstelizabeth @AnEnglishGent1 No one. But I hardly think it matters since the Anglo-Saxons would be the first living population.  If, hypothetically, they found there was some people living in New Zealand prior to the Maori would you then deny them their indigenous rights? Of course not.

As I said I was actually dumbing it down for them.  The "Celtic" population are actually the Bell Beaker decended population genetically.

1334594830308151296 2020-12-04 04:26:17 +0800 <OrStout> @NeasaLee @bluberrysoda @JonixpiSy @tfirstelizabeth @AnEnglishGent1 2) were also made up of several migrations. But you don't deny the Native Americans are indigenous right?

The English are a mix the original British "Celtic" population and the Anglo-Saxons. So they are indigenous because they have significant genetic legacy to the "Celts".  Like I said the Native Americans....

Population genetics are proving time and time again there has been clear population structures throughout North Europe since ancient times.  We have actually changed very little.  Native Americans most likely changed significantly more.
1333542983250141184 2020-12-01 06:46:37 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu Arthur Kemp wrote a book where tried to go through a lot of the definitions of indigenous and prove how the British people fit into it.  It's not necessarily the best piece of literature out there but it raises some really interesting and good points. I recommend it.  https://t.co/GancLO9Vg2

1333542686628978692 2020-12-01 06:45:27 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu Yes groups like the UN and EU have seemingly been silently fiddling with the definition of "indigenous". Presumably to try and twist it in case the issue ever gets raised in mainstream politics and media again.
1333535611827990528 2020-12-01 06:17:20 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 8) We are not uniquely "a nation of immigrants" because of the Anglo-Saxons. In fact we are way more homogeneous with very little genetic change.
1333535578776887299 2020-12-01 06:17:12 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 7) The EU recognises the Sami as indigenous despite them being more mixed and arrived later than Northern Europeans.  It makes zero logical sense to label other groups as indigenous whilst saying the English aren't.
1333535536124997632 2020-12-01 06:17:02 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 6) If other groups are indigenous then so are we:  Native Americans were also originally made up of a few different migrations a few hundred years apart.  The Anglo-Saxons arrived in England over 1500 years ago. Indigenous groups like the Maori arrived like 700 years ago.
1333535470416965644 2020-12-01 06:16:46 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 5) ----- This basically leaves us with this: the English are mainly decended from two people: the original British Celts and the Anglo-Saxons.  Two very similar white, North West European groups.  This makes us way more homogeneous that most groups in the world.
1333535407959666691 2020-12-01 06:16:31 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 4) ---- It's also worth noting that British Celts are not that dissimilar to Anglo-Saxons. They come from the Bell Beaker genetic replacement which were genetically and culturally like Germanics.
1333535296915443714 2020-12-01 06:16:05 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 3) ---- Angles, Saxons and Jutes are again one genetic and cultural people. They're simply just different tribes of the same people.  That's why we label them as the Anglo-Saxons.
1333535217492107265 2020-12-01 06:15:46 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 2) ---- Groups like the Picts aren't a separate people. They are part of the same genetic and cultural group as all British Celts.  Picts were basically just a state that controlled major regions of Scotland for a bit.
1333535126752546819 2020-12-01 06:15:24 +0800 <OrStout> @BasileusComic @leastimnotu 1) Basically:  ---- Romans left no genetic or real cultural trace. They were simply an empire that came and went.  Just like the British in India.  So we can discard them.
1333531182319984640 2020-12-01 05:59:44 +0800 <OrStout> @thatyetidude The indigenous English people can easily be identified as the British Iron Age Celt and Anglo-Saxon decended people.  To deny this would also mean you'd have to deny every other population, Native Americans, Maori etc their indigenous rights.
1333531163735052288 2020-12-01 05:59:39 +0800 <OrStout> @thatyetidude Basically the English are extremely genetically homogeneous, only majorly consisting of two very, very similar white North West European groups. And this only came about via invasion.
1333531075818217475 2020-12-01 05:59:18 +0800 <OrStout> @thatyetidude ....Anglo-Saxons and British Iron Age Celts.  And this isn't even significant since the Celts were decended from the Bell Beaker genetic replacement, which were literally genetically and culturally like Germanics....
1333530995979669504 2020-12-01 05:58:59 +0800 <OrStout> @thatyetidude ...."British Iron Age Celts".   Picts are just a Kingship state of these. Just like East Anglia were a  Kinship state of Anglo-Saxons.  The Anglo-Saxons are once again one people.  So basically the English are primarily decended from only 2 groups:....
1333530873367584773 2020-12-01 05:58:30 +0800 <OrStout> @thatyetidude Yes and I've addressed this claim multiple times.  First you just proved yourself to be completely ignorant of history and genetics.  "Picts", "Celts" and "Britons" are not a separate people. They are all one genetic and cultural group which you would label...

Genetically they were like modern white Europeans.  And they shared facial features of Europeans - European style nose, eyes, hair etc.

You seem to be getting confused because you're conflating skin complexion with genetics and race.  When you refer to someone as "black" is is a GENETIC term. Black means the genetic groups of Sub Subharan Africans.  A albino African is obviously still black

You've made that up.  Go ask any geneticist and he'll agree with me.  By the time humans arrived in Europe they were already genetically distinct. Early dark complexioned Europeans were not black, they were genetically white European.

We are not all cowardly traitors like you.  Also you realise loads of people met with Hitler right? He was literally seen as a great man by most of the world until his expansionism in the East.
1330097560611131392 2020-11-21 18:35:45 +0800 <OrStout> @AntBholah @_Eng1ish 3) You know nothing about Mosley or his ideology if you think he would have turned Britain into a vassal state to Hitler.  He specifically said he'd fight a war with Hitler if Britain was attacked.
1330097500586467331 2020-11-21 18:35:30 +0800 <OrStout> @AntBholah @_Eng1ish People in WW2 held closer views to the BUF than they do to modern left wingers.  And Mosley had huge support all over the country. A significant proportion of those who died in the war would have been BUF sympathizers.

1330097361054560257 2020-11-21 18:34:57 +0800 <OrStout> @AntBholah @_Eng1ish ... Fascists were nationalists and patriots. They would always support their country over their ideology.  2) The majority of soilders would be labelled as "fascist white supremacists" by people like you.  The majority of soilders were conservatives, nationalists and patriots.

Which leaves guns. Which isn't any more "humane" than trad fox hunting.  A bullet can easily hit a now vital area and not kill the fox. I've seen it many times.
1330087929960673283 2020-11-21 17:57:28 +0800 <OrStout> @HaroldTheYeoman True. But even from a pure cultural aspect it should be legal.  It's one thing disliking hunting for sport, it's completely different making it illegal.   The idea that one of our long cultural traditions can be punishable by the state is repulsive. That is genuinely Soviet level
1330086360133361665 2020-11-21 17:51:14 +0800 <OrStout> @AntBholah @_Eng1ish You realise the BUF fought for Britain right? Some of the first British personnel to die in WW2 from Germans were members of the Suffolk Blackshirts.  The British Union of Fascists, many veterans from WW1, gave their lives fighting the Nazis.  Mosley was a fascist, not a Nazi.
1330075468503146498 2020-11-21 17:07:57 +0800 <OrStout> @Fyrdsmann And fox hunting isn't an exclusively upper class sport. Plenty of average people take part in them.  I don't see the issue with that anyway. I celebrate the Traditional, conservative upper class.
1330075242555985920 2020-11-21 17:07:04 +0800 <OrStout> @Fyrdsmann They do need to be hunted though to keep their population in check (the only way you could advoid this is by reintroduction of wild animals like wolves and boars. But we don't have remotely enough green space for that yet).  Trad fox hunting is a good way to help with this.

So what?  They mixed with the current indigenous population to form English people.  So what?

Yet you two keep rambling about nonsense in hundreds of tweets lol:  --- The Romans left no genetic trace.  --- There is an identifiable English ethnic group. ANY geneticist will attest to that.

I'm not sure where you've got this notion from that it was so mixed you couldn't identify them?  There was still identifiable genetic groups around the Roman Empire.  We can tell.

There were no genetic changes during that period.  The population remained the same. There was no influx of any foreign DNA.

The Romans left basically no genetic trace and we have proved than time and time again.  You're obviously lying because you don't know the first thing about genetics.

What makes them indigenous and not us?

A white man born in America is not Native American is he?  There is an identifiable Irish genetic group. There is an identifiable English ethnic group.  This is all pretty simple. Quit playing dumb.

The Traditional idea of the family - a married monogamous male and female have and raise children is one that had pertained throughout all cultures and time periods.  Just because you read the opposite in a left wing media article doesn't mean it's true.

He outlines why possession of drugs like cannabis are simply not enforced in the UK which is why we have such high usage. Prior to the 70s/80s we enforced it and had very little usage.

1326881920924278784 2020-11-12 21:37:56 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar I'm not answering cuz it's a silly question.  I've said this several times: Everything you say is meaningless unless you can define everything you have implied in specific detail with specific figures.  The idea of reparations or guilt is completely indefinable abstract nonsense.
1326872824624123906 2020-11-12 21:01:48 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar And how many millions were saved from the slave trade by Britains Naval action during the 1800s?  How many millions of blacks have been directly benefited by Britains 50 years of foreign aid, the thousands of charities etc etc?  You're opening up a can of worms lol.
1326872756470870016 2020-11-12 21:01:31 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar It would be interesting to see your views. Do you think Britain should pay reparations of the slave trade and feel guilty about it?  If so define EXACTLY why.
1326872711486976005 2020-11-12 21:01:21 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar I think you're missing the point. The point is what you're saying is completely indefinable.   There are literally incalculable numbers of variables in what you're saying.
1326867221587570692 2020-11-12 20:39:32 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar What measures? Define them exactly?
1326867144341151744 2020-11-12 20:39:13 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar It's sort of an irrelevant point - the point remains there have been far more British slaves than slave traders.
1326867090221969409 2020-11-12 20:39:00 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar This is meaningless drivel designed to make yourself think you're smart.  Did all slave traders go on to have children?  Most sailors probably already had children and tens of thousands were rescued or bought back by the British.
1326864801767845889 2020-11-12 20:29:55 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar 2) The number of Brits captured by the Barbary pirates is higher than the number of British slave traders. Pretty obvious.
1326864773036843008 2020-11-12 20:29:48 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar 1) And you could say the exact same about literally any country. The North African invasions and slave trades into Europe, the Arab slave trade, the Ottoman Empire, the Mongolian Empire, the Aztec Empire etc etc etc. What's your point?

1326830479992107008 2020-11-12 18:13:32 +0800 <OrStout> @Metakosmia @roundbarrel @AyoCaesar Here's a fact: A white British person is more likely to be decended from a slave taken prisoner by North Africans Barbary pirates than he is to be decended from a slave owner of blacks.  That shows how insane the entire concept of reparations is.

Churchill himself was opposed to non-white immigration. Etc etc.  As I said even in 1968 as much as 80% of the population supported Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech.

Even if they were anti-Brexit: Go ask them if they think Nigel Farage is some evil racist like they fought to defeat in 1939. Their answer will almost certainly be no.

My Grandfather held ultra nationalistic views that would get him labeled a "racist Fascist" by the left wing thugs.

1324478278074322945 2020-11-06 06:26:43 +0800 <OrStout> (9) Next time you're blackpilled think of Robert and his spider. Fight on against vastly disfavorable odds like he did.  Like that spider we can try and try again until we succeed.   Don't let failure get you down.  Victory is possible.  https://t.co/q1jZoOVOcF
1324478097094266880 2020-11-06 06:26:00 +0800 <OrStout> (8) Robert went on from that day to reclaim his country. For years he did not give up. He fought fiercely and bravely as shown by his victory at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314  His fight helped win his countries independence in 1328.  A man who made himself a national hero  https://t.co/gqZK5VgY9S
1324477596709593089 2020-11-06 06:24:01 +0800 <OrStout> (7) 'Six times,' thought Robert, 'have I fought and six times have I lost'  Only on the seventh attempt did that spider succeed  Robert saw his own struggle reflected in that one small spider. He found his inspiration from it to try fight on despite overwhelming odds facing him  https://t.co/4BmOIVZeMG
1324477250532712461 2020-11-06 06:22:38 +0800 <OrStout> (6) During his time there  he noticed a spider on the walls of the cave.  The spider had been trying to build its web and Robert noticed every time it failed, it resiliently tried again.  Six times did it fail.  https://t.co/B9eRNivoqz
1324477094081036289 2020-11-06 06:22:01 +0800 <OrStout> (5) Robert subsequently fled into hiding in a cave near Dumfries and Galloway with only a few loyal men.   Robert spent the winter there in the cold, his spirits broken, thinking of giving up.  https://t.co/trfF8ixTvB
1324476938468163585 2020-11-06 06:21:24 +0800 <OrStout> (4) Yet another defeat ruined him.  Robert now had nothing left. Most of his troops were gone, his country was occupied and after several events his wife and daughter were captured by the English.  https://t.co/SwYD5PS9Ya
1324476819475697665 2020-11-06 06:20:56 +0800 <OrStout> (3) In 1306, just months after having been crowned King of Scots, Robert suffered yet another humiliating defeat to Edward I's men in the Battle of Methven.  Robert had already fought a long war against the English occupation of Scotland but had failed time and time again.  https://t.co/CMqZuhCaPX
1324476503627833344 2020-11-06 06:19:40 +0800 <OrStout> (2) So I thought I'd tell a story of Robert the Bruce, the legendary medieval Scottish king, as an example of fighting in the face of seemingly hopeless odds.  https://t.co/83otPMi89I

1324362318608846848 2020-11-05 22:45:56 +0800 <OrStout> @SaxonNewfie .... Trump will go down in history as "a literal racist fascist who almost made the USA into a evil dictatorship".  Some of us might know the truth but I guarantee most people will be brainwashed.

They found one Scandinavian woman from the Viking Age buried with a weapon and used it to say that pre-Christians had no concept of gender roles and that women fought as much as men.

By your logic atheists have ignored or suppressed science just as much as religion.

The church was normally at the forefront of academic debate and led science. It's just Hollywood myths that have led to this idea that it was the opposite.

And this arose because of specific circumstances.  By in large the church had the opposite affect of what you're saying.
1322671851903090689 2020-11-01 06:48:38 +0800 <OrStout> The very beginning of secularism is paved in blood you ignorant arse.  Secularism has killed countless.  Macron shows he is completely ignorant of his own history.

And there was as much scientific progress during the deeply religious Medieval period as the 17th and 18tg centuries. And most of this progress was led by the church.

And they did care about race to some extent. They viewed Northern Germanic as lower than them.  And Septimius Severus, a Emperor from Africa himself, was quite racist against blacks.

1321213280480858114 2020-10-28 06:12:47 +0800 <OrStout> @WilliamCassing1 @TerribleWyvern @TheAngrySaxon2 @BjornchrR @bronzeagemantis Exactly. I don't think it does mean "bare shirt" in any translation I know of.   It means bear shirt - as in wearing a bear pelt. There is no indication this was associated with going bare chested.   More like this:  https://t.co/cFVOVy1Fl5

They would wear animal skins but this is not associated with going bare chested.  They would probably have looked like this:  https://t.co/bTD8Q0R4JK

There are two things here:  1) The Old Norse word meaning "to go berserk" - ie simply meaning to go mad in battle. Anyone could do this.   Not associated with going nude.

For example Anglo-Saxon kings claimed legacy and blood ancestry from Woden to claim legitimacy.  What we see is a relgious based caste system.

They were very hierarchical.   The idea of "all men born equal" wouldn't even be understood by original pagans.

You've literally fallen for left wing propaganda.  Paganism was MORE authoritarian and hierarchical than Christianity.  3) The majority of Christians are degenerates.

It's is specifically anti equality and pro a form of caste system.

When the dogs catch the fox they tend to go straight....

I never said it was essential but foxes do need to be hunted. Traditional fox hunting helps that. It is environmentally, agriculturally and even economically beneficial.

And this is me just picking the first item I see. If you properly plan meals, look for discounts etc etc yeah I reckon I could do about £30 for a family of 4.

How many people would do that nowadays?  Me and my family rose from being completely poor to being land owners because we were resourceful.

That's the point I'm getting at.  People moan they can't feed their children whilst buying expensive ready meals and owning latest iPhone.

Eg they extended funding for Universal Credit and have given £63m given to councils to solve these problems.

I actually support the free meals scheme.  But people moaning about the government is not a substitute for being a shit parent. Food is not expensive. Mostly if you can't afford to feed your children it's your own fault.

Not taking into account discounts:  All the items mentioned:  The chicken, noodles, sweetcorn, bread, butter and potatoes came to £6.50.  But that includes a whole tub of butter and loaf of bread which could do a few breakfasts.

1320364088753520641 2020-10-25 21:58:24 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Original humans in the Americas are just as genetically different to modern Native Americans as Neolithic Europeans are to the Bell Beakers.  Once again: if you're saying we aren't indigenous then no human population is.  And they are culturally different.
1320363560086740992 2020-10-25 21:56:18 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Why does 10% mean we aren't indigenous? Who decided that?  And your comparison to mice etc makes it clear you don't understand what it means when people say "we are 90% genetically similar to mice". That's a completely different thing to what we're talking about.
1320362967066693632 2020-10-25 21:53:57 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Neither do Native Americans.  The culture and language of the first settlers is different than the 1500s culture of when Europeans arrived there.
1320362765538762754 2020-10-25 21:53:09 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 False.
1320359460968321025 2020-10-25 21:40:01 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 4) Sorry. There are indigenous British peoples no matter what angle you look at it. To deny that would make the entire conception of indigenous completely defunct.
1320359352553832455 2020-10-25 21:39:35 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 Just like we are the first surviving population.  And we do have genetic legacy from  the Neolithic and Mesolithic anyway.  The Bell Beaker genetic replacement was about a 90% replacement. Which means we still have some genetic legacy from them.
1320359298652905474 2020-10-25 21:39:22 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 2) people there before them, including evidence of ancient Europeans in the Americas. Genetic replacements occurred and now Native Americans are the indigenous peoples.  Why? Because they're the first surviving population with a clear genetic and cultural identity.
1320359227022508035 2020-10-25 21:39:05 +0800 <OrStout> @HumanRi56 1) No logic in your argument here.  Under your definition no one in the world is indigenous then. Indigenous is just a defunct word that doesn't apply to any human populations.  Every modern population in the world wasn't the very first people there. The Native Americans had

You realise "white" and "black" are genetic terms right? Not visual terms.  4) Yes. Cheddar Mans stock, the WHG are genetically white Europeans.  They plot like the Indo-Europeans.

It's a genetic term.  2) People claimed the Irish weren't white for political reasons and general autism, not anything based in reality.  I don't care. It's irrelevant.  3) Indo Europeans didn't introduce white skin.  WHG most likely had

We can see when the influx of Germanic DNA entered the British gene pool. It was AFTER Rome left.  2. Again so you admit that the only people in the British gene pool are genetically similar North West white Europeans?
1319939125634531329 2020-10-24 17:49:45 +0800 <OrStout> @NorthumbrianRep @FreeNorthNow 1. Even in 360AD there were still large scale rebellions against Romes rule.  You don't know what you're talking about.  2. Again there is no genetic trace left by the Romans, no matter what ethnicity they were.  They were an empire who came and left.

1319936851864670210 2020-10-24 17:40:43 +0800 <OrStout> @NorthumbrianRep @FreeNorthNow 1. Yes I have. Read my thread.  You haven't addressed the argument.  2. Yes and all those groups where genetically and culturally similar North West white Europeans.  So you're saying only North West white Europeans can be Northerns? Nice.

The beginning of WW2 is irrelevant. The communist threat had been prevalent since 1918.  You're showing a lack of understanding.

If you don't think Fascism was a reaction to communism the you don't understand basic history.  2. Wrong about what?  3. My ideology? I'm a radical Traditionalist and monarchist.

And fascism was literally self defense against communism. That was literally 80% of the ideology lol.  2. Once again: I don't care lol.  I'm just laughing at how quickly commies start crying.

The only instances of polygamy we have are a FEW elites such as Phillip II.  You're cherry picking. The bit you quote about old men was due to very specific circumstances to sustain the family.
1318990440729817097 2020-10-22 03:00:01 +0800 <OrStout> @IVNOAERIS @diiinkers @seeking_Trad You're embarrassing yourself now.  1. How am I backing up? Of course they had tutors.  Your logic is like saying modern children weren't raised by their parents because we send them to school.  2. You're changing the subject.

Monogamy during marriage was the norm.  The only examples of polygamy we have are a few elites in Macedonia like Phillip II.   3. I didn't mention pedophilia.

It was banned in Sparta and Thebes I believe.  And it was mocked by Aristophanes plays.  Lot more complex than you make it out to be.  Homosexuality and pederasty was for sexual pleasure only.

You just inferred that there weren't indigenous Native Americans or Maori.  I'm asking you to confirm that. Say it. Say "I don't believe there are indigenous Native Americans".

That's the point.  You gladly screech on about how Brits aren't indigenous and "immigration is good" yet you wouldn't say the same to a Native American.

Everyone came from somewhere else?  So you're saying there are no indigenous Native Americans? No indigenous Maoris? No indigenous South Africans?  Or are we only not indigenous because we are white?  Wow that's racist.

There's not a logical way at looking at this issue where the Briton and Anglo-Saxon white English aren't the indigenous peoples.

They are considered indigenous because they're the first surviving inhabitants with a clear genetic and cultural identity. The Anglo-Saxons arrived over 1500 years ago.

Because that would make them the first surviving inhabitants who have a clear genetic and cultural identity. They are the original inhabitants that survived.

The Anglo-Saxons being genetically similar to the Brits anyway  So we have significant genetic linage from the people you claim are indigenous. So how wouldn't we be the indigenous peoples?

No they're simply their own unique indigenous people.  The English, for example, are indigenous despite being a mix of Anglo-Saxons and Celtic Britons. We are indigenous because:

Everyone mixed with local peoples because of the nature of invasions. Native Americans are a mix of genetically similar tribes. Are these therefore not indigenous?  Native Americans near Mexico mixed with Meso-Americans.

Just because there were some mixture with local tribes who were genetically and culturally like us doesn't mean we aren't indigenous.  If you think that then you don't believe that ANY human people are indigenous

If you deny that you would also have to deny the Native Americans, Maori etc are indigenous. They are just as "diverse" as us.

So what you're really saying is the English are only a mix of two people: Germanic tribes and "Britons".   This is NOT diverse. Celtic Brits are NOT very genetically different from Germanics.

Genetically and culturally indistinguishable.  Normans were a mix of Scandinavian "Vikings, Celtic Gauls and Germanic Franks. So no different from the English.  Right now: The English are only about 40% Germanic. So you're wrong.

Just like East Anglians were a separate nation of Anglo-Saxon English.  Romans left no genetic trace on Britain. They were simply an empire that came and went. So we can discard them.

Firstly you don't seem to understand who the groups are.  "Britons" and "Celts" are confusing terms but they're the same genetic people you're thinking of.

This is hardly diverse.  So no British people are incredibly homogeneous, more so than most nations around the world.

It is a set of values, practices and ideas worked out by a huge study of religion and history.  There is a completely "rational basis" for it.   It's just you don't understand it because you're completely ignorant.

This is the view that extends beyond one time period in one country. The overall view that is generally perennial throughout all time periods.  The values Ancient Greece had came as a divergence from primordial Tradition.
1317758026011561986 2020-10-18 17:22:50 +0800 <OrStout> @sweatylargesse @diiinkers @seeking_Trad 7) And in Athens gay people were blocked from certain positions of office.  By today's standards Ancient Greece was extremely anti-LGBT.  D) The overarching relgious view has been one of homosexuality being negative and the prevalence of the nuclear family.

Homosexuality was routinely mocked eg Aristophanes plays. And it was banned a number of time throughout the Ancient period eg it was banned in Sparta and Thebes for a short while.

Because the nuclear family as depicted in the 50s imagine was held important in Ancient Greece.  B) Homosexuals could not marry. Couples "in love" did not exist. Gay sex was purley for sexual pleasure

It looks through all religions and cultures throughout all of history to find values that are perennial. Again this is incredibly complex and hundreds of books have been dedicated to this.

And British Celts were decended from the Bell Beaker genetic replacement - thus genetically similar to Germanics anyway.

They were a mix of "Viking" settlers and the French - the French being a mix of the Germanic Franks and Celtic Gauls. Just like the English were a mix of Germanic Anglo-Saxons and Celtic Brits.

The way animals would perceive pain and suffering is completely different to how a human perceives it.  The idea animals are like humans and should be saved from nature is blatantly absurd psudeo-morality.

It was basically just a communist riot - commies who were brought in by busses from around England.  But Hope not Hate never let facts stand in their way of pushing an agenda

And genetic studies have shown, including this very paper the media article try to manipulate, show that VA Scandinavians did not mix with other groups around them like the Sami.

The first settlers were already genetically white.  Eg groups like the WHG (Western Hunter Gatherers) who, whilst they might have had a darker complexion than modern Europeans, were genetically white European.

The migration out of Africa was extremely slow. By the time humans arrived in Europe, coming from the Steppes and parts of Asia, they were already genetically Proto-European.

Everyone admits there were some merchants, sailors, clergymen etc. But it was overall very homogeneous and very white. To suggest it was some kind of diverse paradise is ignorant to recent population genetics.

It's just that sometimes sub contractors or the builders don't do their job properly or it isn't properly looked at by the building inspector.

1305816649845608449 2020-09-15 18:32:04 +0800 <OrStout> @cheddarmandna 3. Actually all different races have different levels of different species DNA. Eg blacks have high levels of Homo Erectus and whites and Asians have high levels of Neanderthal and Denisovan.  So what you're saying isn't accurate.

You don't understand genetics.  2. We're also all decended from apes and fish. That doesn't mean we are apes or fish. This is dumb logic.

And secondly they GOP don't hold like any of these values anyway.  Again Fascists literally wrote against these very sort of people. They are the complete opposite of what fascists wanted.

Points 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 13 could all apply to literally any ideology that is turning more extreme or just using certain rhetoric to try and gain support.  Points 1, 2 and 12 could apply to any ideology like

We don't see those "signs" amongst the GOP at all. They still embody literally all the ideals Fascists hated.  2. These "signs" are hilariously vague to the point of meaningless.

Before you were arguing communism was good in Russia and life expectancy and the economy collapsed after the fall of the USSR.  No you're saying it wasn't real communism.  You're not being consistent.  So which is it?

By the 70s the Soviets were finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the economy.  The fall in GDP after the fall of the Soviet was a BECAUSE of communism, not because of capitalism.

It was built off dogy ideas that failed in practice along with corruption, suppression of people and suppression of their satellite states.

Both ideologically and physically.  Which is hugely contrary to the communist narrative, who say Fascism is "capitalism in decay".

1302974889847123971 2020-09-07 22:19:56 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 Yes. There are unique indigenous English peoples, Irish, Welsh, Scottish etc.  British is just a collective term for all indigenous people, like Europe is a collective term for all indigenous peoples there. I'm using it because it makes things simpler.
1302974435633385472 2020-09-07 22:18:08 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 ... invasion.  Jews are culturally and genetically distinct and different. They are nothing to do with the indigenous people here.  You're just listing events or invasions.
1302974394831077381 2020-09-07 22:17:58 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 There is a unique English identity. Our culture has always been unique. I'm sorry but it's simply false and ignorant to imply otherwise.  Vikings are the same as Anglo-Saxons as I said.  Norman's were mainly a leadership change. There was still an English identity after their...
1302971708849127426 2020-09-07 22:07:18 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 8. A Maori is clearly genetically and culturally distinct from another indigenous group on some far flung Polynesian island, for example.  There is no logic in what you're saying. You're just broadening the definition of indigenous which would change every group in the world.
1302971488446930944 2020-09-07 22:06:25 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 7. This wouldn't go down well with these indigenous peoples because they know they are genetically and culturally distinct, even if they are mixed and have a common origin.  Just like Britain is distinct from Germany.
1302971281462243329 2020-09-07 22:05:36 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 6. So according to you there is no indigenous, let's say, Ethiopian? There are just indigenous Africans? There is no indigenous Native Americans to the landmass of Canada? There are just natives of the entirety of the American continent? Etc
1302971236172128259 2020-09-07 22:05:25 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 5. Just like there is a unique German indigenous group etc etc.  Everyone in the world is mixed with other local people like this because that human history: many invasions and empires.   .
1302971120908410880 2020-09-07 22:04:57 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 4. Again looking at the Anglo-Saxons - the original Celts and Anglo-Saxons came together to form a unique English genetic and cultural identity around 1500 years ago due to very set circumstances and an INVASION.  So for these reasons there is a unique British indigenous group.
1302971051907985408 2020-09-07 22:04:41 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 3. The English are uniquely English for example. No other European is genetically identical to the English.  Along with a unique English CULTURE. Whilst similar to other NW Europeans, there is a completely unique culture to England.
1302970976787984384 2020-09-07 22:04:23 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 2.  (And that Germanic DNA was similar to the British Celts anyway).  So for that reason alone there are unique British indigenous people etc.  And leading on from that, as I said, there is a unique British genetic cluster and identity.
1302970898841042944 2020-09-07 22:04:04 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 1. But we are distinctly British:  The British people still have genetic linage to the very original existing inhabitants of these islands. The Anglo-Saxons, for example, never replaced everyone in England, they just added some percentage of Germanic DNA.
1302956532158660609 2020-09-07 21:06:59 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 * each European country
1302955858989666304 2020-09-07 21:04:19 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 But there is as if pointed out. Each European has, whilst linked, a unique genetic buildup associated with the original inhabitants.  Could you please tell me why you believe there is a European indigenous label but not a British one because I'm failing to see your logic.

1302954072996278272 2020-09-07 20:57:13 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 5. I'll once again just direct you to this extremely comprehensive genetic study which shows how the Romans did not leave a significant genetic trace and how there are separate genetic differences between the English, Welsh, Scots etc which thus make us uniquely indigenous:
1302953950380011520 2020-09-07 20:56:44 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 4. If you admit there are different genetic clusters between NW European countries then there you are: the British are indigenous.  Why would you think they aren't?
1302953731412164608 2020-09-07 20:55:51 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 3. I'm afraid I don't see your second point? Are you denying there are different genetic clusters associated with each NW European country? Because no geneticist would claim that.
1302953657407856641 2020-09-07 20:55:34 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 2. 2. Ah so you admit there is a indigenous NW European of the British Isles, North France, Scandinavia and Germany then?  Interesting. That's progress.
1302953593935405058 2020-09-07 20:55:19 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 1. Are these proper genome-wide studies? Or just media articles?  Because genetic testing has shown next to no genetic lineage from the Romans.  There is trace amounts of Italian found in some regions of the UK, but it did not affect the genepool in any noticeable way.
1302944934643859456 2020-09-07 20:20:54 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 1. Yes.  2. Individual nations are also indigenous.  There are clear genetic clusters associated with each country eg English, Welsh, Irish and the Scots.
1302944614329077762 2020-09-07 20:19:38 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 What group are you referring to? Re read my comments.
1302944368907685888 2020-09-07 20:18:39 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 We have the right to be recognised as indigenous. The UK government has denied that. See Kemps book (pictures below) for information on that and why we should be indigenous.  https://t.co/Z4530kdMif

1302925879354560512 2020-09-07 19:05:11 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 6. The white British are indigenous just like the Native Americans, and it makes no logical sense to say otherwise.
1302925766682914819 2020-09-07 19:04:44 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 5. What you're suggesting is like saying there is no such thing as a Native American because the Apache and Comanche tribes mixed over conflict. Obviously an stupid narrative right?
1302925697657208834 2020-09-07 19:04:28 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 4. All of those groups you mentioned are genetically and culturally similar (relatively) North West Europeans.  And all of those genetic changes came about because of invasion and war almost or over 1000 years ago.
1302925636042973185 2020-09-07 19:04:13 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 3. And the Normans were also largely Germanic since Gaul was conquered by the Franks AND Normandy was created by Viking invaders. They left little genetic trace as well.  So what you really mean is Britain is Celto-Germanic. They are the indigenous peoples of Britain!
1302925508791939073 2020-09-07 19:03:43 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 2. Just like the British empire in India.  The Anglo-Saxons and Vikings are the same Germanic peoples. Genetically identical basically. They are just separated by a few hundred years.  The Picts are a Celtic nation. We know of no Pictish DNA.
1302925406367035392 2020-09-07 19:03:18 +0800 <OrStout> @RichardBLow6 1. Strange comment. This is a wholly illogical narrative often used by people to deny Brits their indigenous rights. Firstly the Romans are not British. They left basically no genetic trace to us. They were simply an empire that came, struggled to control the natives, and left.
