1342600835180736513 2020-12-26 06:39:18 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC Yeah. Like Israel.

1342595855040311296 2020-12-26 06:19:30 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC Again.. You have been unable to demonstrate that. Israel has no resources, limited manpower, and associating with them fosters a lot of resentment from other states.
1342595524126453762 2020-12-26 06:18:11 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC Yeah that's fine. No handouts though.

1342594323779624962 2020-12-26 06:13:25 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC The US doesn't need to give Israel money in order to facilitate trade.

1342593076657856512 2020-12-26 06:08:28 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC Yeah and the US doesn't need Israel to produce them.
1342592207505797122 2020-12-26 06:05:01 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC 😂 Bro you wouldn't even have a state if it wasn't for Anglo-American control over the ME.
1342591783545548802 2020-12-26 06:03:20 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC I don't think the US should be giving money to any foreign state that isn't an immediate ally in wartime. I think it does very little to help the average American citizen.
1342590744230559746 2020-12-26 05:59:12 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @of_axes @AIPAC I'd rather have no one buy them than literally pay for them twice. Produce something else for export. Preferably something that improves the human condition rather than makes it worse.

1331821952483389441 2020-11-26 12:47:52 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @yates_647 @CBCNews Yeah racism is such an issue that we're bringing in hundreds of thousands of non-Whites every year.
1331817415269777408 2020-11-26 12:29:50 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews Uh yeah because there was no evidence to convict them for such.
1331816228051185669 2020-11-26 12:25:07 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews Last I checked, the system does not allow it. Where it has been confirmed to occur there have been legal consequences for the officers involved. I'll keep waiting for your evidence of systemic racism.
1331814862310289408 2020-11-26 12:19:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews Not indicative of systemic racism. Try again.
1331814714058399746 2020-11-26 12:19:06 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews You are referring to an individual case in Saskatchewan which is not indicative of nation-wide systemic racism.
1331814021989855241 2020-11-26 12:16:21 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews You gave me zero examples of systemic racism. Sorry. Try again.

1331813469042126851 2020-11-26 12:14:09 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews Just because you say there's systemic racism doesn't make it so, the onus is on you since you are the one making the initial claim.

1331209995409559554 2020-11-24 20:16:10 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive So end that then. What you are proposing is two wrongs make a right. All I am defending here is civilization. There's a reason why the Soviet Union collapsed.

1331207263227424768 2020-11-24 20:05:18 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive They're not underfunded. You get poverty reduction with employment opportunities, not handing people free shit. I don't agree with militarization of the police and I think we should end the drug war. This would eliminate half of their budget on it's own. No need to defund.
1331204763438952448 2020-11-24 19:55:22 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive Bullshit. We've been doing that already without defunding the police. I don't understand what exactly you hope to achieve by reducing their funding.
1331204325583032320 2020-11-24 19:53:38 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive "Defunding the police" on it's own, without addressing things like drug policy is a really stupid idea.

1314093423843041281 2020-10-08 14:41:01 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @karengeier @TwitterSafety @FBI Really I'm just interested because Joe Biden seems to think that the Proud Boys and Kyle Rittenhouse are white supremacists(when they aren't). Overuse of that term along with the word "racist" is going to end up with actual white supremacists opposing you.

1311213151128621059 2020-09-30 15:55:51 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @dopeschemes @Sarah_Colero No we aren't. We are not complicit in genocide any more than anyone else in any other country in the world.
1311212814829260800 2020-09-30 15:54:30 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Sarah_Colero This is why women shouldn't be allowed to vote.
1311212557986934791 2020-09-30 15:53:29 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @thomasjuneau Bullshit. You people are deranged.
1311212385538060288 2020-09-30 15:52:48 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @azmiluv No it hasn't.
1311193445885710336 2020-09-30 14:37:32 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I didn't know black people weren't allowed to leave. Interesting.
1311193143564533766 2020-09-30 14:36:20 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol yeah and I don't see how that makes white people racist.
1311192222549839873 2020-09-30 14:32:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Who is running those schools?
1311192072330846208 2020-09-30 14:32:05 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Ok.. I don't see it having to do with you being white. Are black people in Detroit not allowed to succeed? Which laws are keeping them down?
1311191750585782272 2020-09-30 14:30:48 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Then so can the blacks in the inner city.
1311191585770668033 2020-09-30 14:30:09 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Nope. If anything the reverse is true. See: diversity quotas in college admission and in hiring
1311190828635877376 2020-09-30 14:27:08 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Agree*
1311190773296226304 2020-09-30 14:26:55 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol we're kinda going around in circles at this point. I guess we'll sgree to disagree.
1311190570052792321 2020-09-30 14:26:07 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC How do we fix that? Do white coal miners in West Virginia have privilege?
1311189898519552000 2020-09-30 14:23:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC So if I were to say that black Americans are privileged, you would agree?
1311189456859389956 2020-09-30 14:21:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Again the fact remains that several ethnic groups make more money than whites in America. How do whites have an advantage?
1311188950015447041 2020-09-30 14:19:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC They have to work harder than... who? What would you consider an even point?
1311187123710709762 2020-09-30 14:12:25 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Ok so immigrants are privileged?
1311186893808242688 2020-09-30 14:11:30 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Well you just accused the Proud Boys of being white supremacists, so...
1311186717802672128 2020-09-30 14:10:48 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I have no idea. Why do you think white people are so privileged despite making less money on average than Filipino Americans?
1311186215849340928 2020-09-30 14:08:49 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Yet they are far outperformed academically and make less money annually than several Asian ethnic groups and obviously Jews. Again, I'm not seeing this power disparity with whites and blacks.
1311185781982220288 2020-09-30 14:07:05 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Because you live in a woke area and presumedly agree with them politically. Just look at how the media twisted the Covington story last year.
1311184860187369473 2020-09-30 14:03:25 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I don't really think that's the case. I would argue that calling everyone racist and antagonizing whites is what is causing the division.
1311183500888899590 2020-09-30 13:58:01 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Yeah.. guns.. I think if you were to just look at white communities, the US is actually safer than Canada.
1311182663152267271 2020-09-30 13:54:42 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Maybe I'll check it out.
1311182543572664320 2020-09-30 13:54:13 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol you really want to talk about shootings? More people get shot in one weekend across the US than right wingers have shot since Trump got in office.
1311181999223328768 2020-09-30 13:52:03 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Is it really? How many buildings have been burnt down by right wing extremists lately?
1311181727721828352 2020-09-30 13:50:59 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC He's not a standard politician, and he pisses off crazy leftists.
1311181447269691393 2020-09-30 13:49:52 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Yeah so are the Proud Boys
1311179576698171392 2020-09-30 13:42:26 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm not consuming right wing media. Did Joe Biden condemn antifa?
1311179444950904832 2020-09-30 13:41:54 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Ok, fine. I just don't like when the term white supremacist is improperly tossed around.
1311178899989069824 2020-09-30 13:39:44 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm not seeing it.
1311178813846548482 2020-09-30 13:39:24 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC No but if it was it wouldn't make him any less black.
1311178648456658946 2020-09-30 13:38:44 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC So are antifa and much of BLM. How come no focus on that condemnation by the media?
1311178432936583169 2020-09-30 13:37:53 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Is he a white supremacist too?
1311178338300497920 2020-09-30 13:37:31 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Nope. I know one guy who is though. He's black.
1311178216778936322 2020-09-30 13:37:02 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC We didn't have left wing lunatics burning down the city though. They mostly just did their protesting vs. imaginary injustices.
1311177822279434243 2020-09-30 13:35:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol the Proud Boys aren't a white supremacist group, so... What?
1311177668285599746 2020-09-30 13:34:51 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Sure sound like it too. I'm just thankful you guys left most of the destruction and arson to the US cities.
1311177189434499072 2020-09-30 13:32:57 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm just curious about your concern. What if it was an order?
1311176899666890752 2020-09-30 13:31:48 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm confused. Perhaps you have had one too many tonight.
1311176537010470914 2020-09-30 13:30:21 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Ahaha you know it well I take it.
1311176411638624257 2020-09-30 13:29:51 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Because I feel like it.
1311176058473979904 2020-09-30 13:28:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Maybe it was, what's it to you?
1311175741657288704 2020-09-30 13:27:11 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @dave25097396 @NickAdamsinUSA I'm afraid you are the one who is delusional. The irony is that calling every white person you disagree witb a white supremacist is more akin to being a white supremacist.
1311175096439115777 2020-09-30 13:24:38 +0800 <roberthegreat91> Debate was so cringe.
1311174936837459968 2020-09-30 13:24:00 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC That would be awesome, but ofc you know it's not true.
1311174713021018112 2020-09-30 13:23:06 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @ABC Did he also condemn the Mongol horde?
1311174449547431936 2020-09-30 13:22:03 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @nowthisnews Proud Boys aren't white supremacists, so.. I don't understand this stupid tweet.
1311174197847220225 2020-09-30 13:21:03 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Reuters I'm more outraged that he didn't condemn the Westboro Baptists.

1307942979940876288 2020-09-21 15:21:21 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Chief15Doctor @gbellseattle It means something better to have an outstretched arm with your palm to the ground.
1307942395758157825 2020-09-21 15:19:02 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Hessian_Mohd I'm referring to it's member nations and the people in them, who have improved the human condition via a significant amount of scientific discoveries and advancements in the last few hundred years. I think we agree on the structure of the EU itself.
1307935091197345792 2020-09-21 14:50:00 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Hessian_Mohd I think members of the EU have made more than enough contributions to improving the human condition. Not really sure what you're referring to here exactly.
1307911824952655873 2020-09-21 13:17:33 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Hessian_Mohd But the international power and influence that they project is more to do with the petrodollar than anything.
1307903472239546369 2020-09-21 12:44:22 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Hessian_Mohd I agree with you to an extent... The fact remains that the government of Saudi Arabia is almost entirely a Western prop.
1307896154030563329 2020-09-21 12:15:17 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @bopinion Nope. I'll only invest in it if a white person does.

1304201369256108032 2020-09-11 07:33:31 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @PattyHajdu @JustinTrudeau @TAIBU_CHC Shut the fuck up, bitch
1304201081925312512 2020-09-11 07:32:23 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @ESDC_GC @CanadianPM @CCOHS Make sure workplaces are safe AKA make sure they are abiding by racial quotas.
1304199610332835841 2020-09-11 07:26:32 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @CanadianPM You mean to suppress dissent.
1304197202248634373 2020-09-11 07:16:58 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Breaking911 Sounds like more systemic racism to me.
1304196279417831424 2020-09-11 07:13:18 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @JennyChachan They're all leftists anyway. The sooner they die, the better.
1304195972998758400 2020-09-11 07:12:05 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @CBC @cbcradio What's the difference between CBC and a bucket of shit?  The bucket.

1304122963109851136 2020-09-11 02:21:58 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @lonita @TheSpec @Mattatthespec Yeah you're right. It's about the City trying to get more money from the province to waste on empty bicycle lanes and two way conversions.

1304073258342391808 2020-09-10 23:04:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @TheSpec @_barrygray_ The City wastes a bunch of money to increase traffic congestion.
1304067267689435142 2020-09-10 22:40:39 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaximeBernier Yep.. The left has gone full retard.
1304065571718410240 2020-09-10 22:33:55 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @CPAC_TV Leftist nuts just got the systemic racism they've been screaming about.
1304064422000852992 2020-09-10 22:29:21 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @CanadianPM Utter garbage. Canada is now the racist country the left wanted.
1304061278772658178 2020-09-10 22:16:51 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump China put the Uygurs in camps b/c they denied the Armenian genocide.

1303874527328382978 2020-09-10 09:54:46 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @annikataraa @Trevornoah I agree, they can. Let them do it and all of the woke people can move there to flourish.

1303709904751005697 2020-09-09 23:00:37 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @frentanyI Aha

1303703074347909123 2020-09-09 22:33:29 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @RyanAFournier Neither of them deserve it but I support the idea for no other reason than to piss off the left
1303702640384266241 2020-09-09 22:31:45 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @KyleKulinski Well that would actually make the most sense... Though I think we all know Obama is not gonna have his revoked anytime soon.
1303702183108653056 2020-09-09 22:29:56 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Public_Citizen Sure. Just y'know.. wait until there's a real pandemic to point this out.

1303700251069554690 2020-09-09 22:22:16 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @TheSpec @Mattatthespec Or just stop pretending that Covid is a big problem.

1303699181941542915 2020-09-09 22:18:01 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @TheSpec @HamiltonPolice LOL the hate crime unit. You know if whoever did that wanted to be offensive, they could have at least drawn it the right way.

1303651210730373120 2020-09-09 19:07:23 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @TheSpec @mackaycartoons Having the element of force on your side is a big plus when you're trying to mess with people.

1303647780804714501 2020-09-09 18:53:46 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @atrupar Sounds pretty sane and rational. No wonder so many are against it.
1303646871127289856 2020-09-09 18:50:09 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @BBCBreaking Sounds extremely stupid, so I'm guessing it will indeed happen.
1303119736729931776 2020-09-08 07:55:30 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @RoKhanna Because he's a politician who knows how to rile up his base of supporters.
1303079192167354368 2020-09-08 05:14:24 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @DanBilzerian That's why I identify as black.
1303078897181958151 2020-09-08 05:13:13 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @TheSpec Yeah well... It's Canada. Harder to have a sensible right wing platform in a country dominated by left wing extremists.
1303047063026962437 2020-09-08 03:06:43 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @AminahSheikh Yeah but... No right on red
