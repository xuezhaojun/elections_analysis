1343299986369490955 2020-12-28 04:57:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ScorpioGlitch My Credit Card company is closing my account, rejecting the fraud charges, and giving me a new card and number. My cell phone company fixed the fraud issue I had and I don't pay a bill for a month.

1343270123310899205 2020-12-28 02:58:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Anyhow, it's probably no coincidence that since Credit cards and phone companies are outsourcing our information to foreigners in India, that I have fraud charges on a credit card and had fraud charges on my cell phone. Thank you Chamber of Commerce &amp; Big Tech. You dumb fucks!

1342281463702687744 2020-12-25 09:30:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm an AMERICAN!
1342281387756429312 2020-12-25 09:29:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This isn't the 1940's Dave. You better take a look at your little Antifa party. Look at their plan and beliefs.
1342280719402491904 2020-12-25 09:27:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are actually going to do the reverse. You are going to CREATE actual fascists by supporting Marxism / Communism. Americans DO NOT WANT COMMUNISM or MARXISM. We are a CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC.
1342279881162420224 2020-12-25 09:23:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> No Dave, it is YOU that is brainwashed and I suggest you search engine and do some research on America Antifa. They are supposed to be declared a National Terrorist group by now. How do you NOT know this?
1342279463200022529 2020-12-25 09:22:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Being Antifa is not just "anti-fascist"! America's Antifa are Marxist Communists and they want to dismantle ALL government, law and order, purge the police, and install Marxism.
1342278441517907970 2020-12-25 09:18:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I asked you if you took that screenshot from CNN? Everyone  knows CNN is anti-America and is definitely Anti-Trump. They lie all the time!
1342278062843551745 2020-12-25 09:16:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Uh no Dave, the majority are NOT. If you are Antifa, you are against Americans in your nation. I can't believe you don't know this.

1342277099432923141 2020-12-25 09:12:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Dave says he is Antifa and that they are peaceful. LMAO Uh...the Media SUPPORTS Antifa, LOL The media is anti-American.
1342276671932665862 2020-12-25 09:11:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Seen videos of your violence for 4 years now. You even tried burning down a Church across from the White House. You also tried to set the White House on fire. You are absolutely insane. No patriot AMERICAN supports Antifa. You are America's enemy. They want to dismantle our USA!

1342243958211158016 2020-12-25 07:01:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are a Communist. You actually should be in jail.
1342234007036186627 2020-12-25 06:21:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @MinscTheRashemi AGREE
1342228372471083008 2020-12-25 05:59:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> In late 1800s story circulated that German immigrant, August Imgard, set up the first American Christmas tree in Wooster, Ohio, in 1847. Story of Imgard appeared often in newspapers as a holiday feature. Basic version was Imgard after arriving in America was homesick at Christmas
1342227209856184320 2020-12-25 05:54:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Christmas was declared a federal holiday in the United States on June 26, 1870. The first eggnog made in the United States was consumed in Captain John Smith’s 1607 Jamestown settlement.
1342226382361948161 2020-12-25 05:51:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MinscTheRashemi Yep. White European culture and White American culture.

1342225309475733506 2020-12-25 05:47:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Christmas songs such as "Do you hear what I hear?" are White culture.

1341882691650777090 2020-12-24 07:05:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You have no friends.
1341877010608615426 2020-12-24 06:43:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL that you think the GOP likes Trump and is his "party".

Why do you avoid blaming both parties? Are you that sucked in by Democrats and Communists? Why should illegals get $1800 and Americans $600?
1341827195191357440 2020-12-24 03:25:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @W20192021 @impressionist81 LMAO hahahaha
1341826054885924866 2020-12-24 03:20:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MrJosepL @PeckPolitics @Lightenupfranc2 @realDonaldTrump Thank Democrats for raising wish list items amounts for things that have nothing to do with COVID relief then. I mean giving millions for gender studies in Egypt is going to help people in America that lost their business because of China virus ammirite?
1341822558782500872 2020-12-24 03:06:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What about a church that is "Muslim only" or "Black only"? How much are those worth? How much is a "Jew only" synagogue worth?
1341820310899859458 2020-12-24 02:57:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Maybe you don't have enough problems or issues in your life that you got the time and energy to stalk Trump's twitter and select me out of hundreds to respond too? Gosh, you must be VERY bored in life. Oh yes Trump created the virus that spread across the world and killed folks.
1341819069595590657 2020-12-24 02:52:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yes it's not the Democrats locking down cities and destroying small business. It's the Senate and the WH?
1341818518451482633 2020-12-24 02:50:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Illegals feed us, NOT the farmers or the truckers hauling the goods according to Heriberto. He says we should thank illegals because we were able to hunker down in our homes for an entire year while illegals kept America running!
1341818178247208965 2020-12-24 02:49:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Wait...so you are saying small Businesses went under and the American people lost jobs but were able to hunker down in our homes thanks to illegals? That we should thank them and it's great that Congress passed a bill that gives them $1800 but only American citizens $600?
1341817687186546689 2020-12-24 02:47:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The Cares Act did pass, we received stimulus checks. Why are you discussing back in April / May? BOTH parties have been doing political theater all YEAR long. You act like it's just the Senate. It's ALL OF CONGRESS. But yeah....Orange Man Bad ammirite? I guess you just want $600.
1341817093155643398 2020-12-24 02:44:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @hoseman1105 Thanks!!! :)
1341816478799196160 2020-12-24 02:42:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The Care Act was passed this year. Did you not get your $$$? Or have forgotten about April. Democrats control the House.  We can do this all day!
1341812778198298625 2020-12-24 02:27:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You proved my point. You are sucked in. You are the one that is a waste of time and think Biden is your savior. Merry Christmas. Can't wait until Biden raises your taxes next year.
1341812022997102592 2020-12-24 02:24:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You act like the Democrat Majority House is great because they wanted more than $600 for Americans but ignore that they also wanted to give illegals $1800 and they passed a bill doing just that. Educate yourself that there are two branches of Government and they all PASSED it.
1341810539094282241 2020-12-24 02:18:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Just stop Donna. You are so one-sided and can't stretch your mind to blame both sides. It's really sad. But whatever.

1341806005450121220 2020-12-24 02:00:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Larry is Canadian but has BIG dreams about America. Shouldn't you be worrying about Canada? It's looking a bit messy up there Pal.
1341804711922561024 2020-12-24 01:55:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are telling me to research....did you read the 5,000 page bill? Even Congress didn't read it😂😂😂😂But I like how you claim you read 5000 pages and know this is all Mitch's fault.
1341804175794049024 2020-12-24 01:53:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You crack me up. A bill could have passed months ago before the election and Trump even then said to send $$$ to Americans. I've been here all year Donna.
1341803114719031297 2020-12-24 01:49:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I will take it as a compliment whether you want me too or not :) THANK YOU!
1341802201484849154 2020-12-24 01:45:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay well then you got me there Donna! I guess you want $600 instead of $2000 for Americans.
1341801533550292992 2020-12-24 01:43:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I enjoy being a #fuckers but I didn't realize you had access to Trump and knew he requested the bills to be attached and the Congress that has been against him for 4 years just pleasantly complied and did what he said. 😂😂😂😂😂
1341800975636557826 2020-12-24 01:40:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh you spoke with Trump and this is what he said? 😂
1341800634346041345 2020-12-24 01:39:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL this lady thinks Mitch wrote the entire bill and is responsible along with Orange Man Bad. Says I am the one ill-informed when I said Lobbyists wrote Pork Bill. 😂😂😂😂😂
1341799538319831042 2020-12-24 01:35:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't even like Mitch, but he didn't write this bill. Lobbyists wrote it and all of Congress supported it except a handful of Republicans. Stop your nonsense.
1341799153698021378 2020-12-24 01:33:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yes and I am sure it was Mitch that put in the bill that billions be given in foreign aid and Egypt for gender studies. You people crack me up!
1341797994870546433 2020-12-24 01:29:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Here is another person that doesn't know we have two legislative branches in Government. The House which is currently Democrat majority and The Senate which is Republican majority. Is it my job now to educate?
1341797498688565251 2020-12-24 01:27:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LMAO at "Moscow Mitch". Our entire Congress are Communists and work with China. Plus owned by Israel. You think it's Russia😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1341797067627393025 2020-12-24 01:25:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Nice mental gymnastics you got there so you can hate orange man bad and love the Demoncrats and blame just the GOP.

1341646842283569152 2020-12-23 15:28:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL okay sure Henry....you act like I haven't been here all year.

1341603695801348096 2020-12-23 12:37:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Are you dumb? Have you not heard of Victorian apparel or Edwardian? Those are English clothing styles.

1341049416388665344 2020-12-21 23:54:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> No matter how many American statues come down they will never let you live in peace. You will never be forgiven for being born White no matter what side your ancestors fought on in American history.
1341048295280545794 2020-12-21 23:50:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Every Confederate statue that is removed, are they saying if you have an ancestor that fought on that side, they are bad people and so are you? Is it wise to continue to remove history like this? I don't think so. We should be removing members from Congress instead.
1341032524882075649 2020-12-21 22:47:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @mrfurious911 Well you probably should focus on minorities such as African Americans, they have the strongest in group preference. You get them to give up their identity as Black, then you can come hound White folks when you accomplish that!

1340469384402382848 2020-12-20 09:29:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Sounds like you want a permanent 60's woodstock concert. I have to disagree.
1340466517423640576 2020-12-20 09:18:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I absolutely hate seeing my home page and how POLITE media is now that they have Biden. It's gross and shameless and SO obvious. These people need shut down and soon.
1340466175537504258 2020-12-20 09:16:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So legalize it like we are doing drugs and we can just be Weimar x 1000? Everyone stoned and fucking? What a great society for kids!

1339275161615413248 2020-12-17 02:24:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Spanish speaking radio stations in your nation is not assimilation, it's saying I'm not going to bother to learn your nation's language and culture. If you can't speak English how and why are you here? How did you pass a citizenship test? Must mean you broke in &amp; here illegally.
1339119483168886785 2020-12-16 16:05:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Rediscovery18 Agree, my point was in regards to children who are abducted and sold into sex market.
1339118431069745153 2020-12-16 16:01:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Jill Biden is a so called "doctor" like Michael and Obama were so called "lawyers".😂😂

1339113739308703747 2020-12-16 15:42:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Kendall00791917 Agree!
1339113394721447936 2020-12-16 15:41:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We are all familiar with the phrase "you can't please everyone" so why do we tolerate and try to please the crazy portion at the expense of an entire nation? Sex work is not work. Tell that to girls who are sold into slave sex trade. AOC is absolutely despicable!
1339108031838220291 2020-12-16 15:20:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Mentally disturbed leftists take something that is not normal and is 1 or 2 percent of the population of a country and force the normal majority population to conform to their lunacy. This however is only a fraction of how they destroy a civilized society.

I got him nice button down shirts and when he opened the gift he said "oh..nice...gentleman shirts!" He cracks me up! He is 9 years old. I wasn't expecting him to call them that.

1339062534033338368 2020-12-16 12:19:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I let my nieces and nephew open half of their presents tonight, I just can't help it, lol. I have no regrets though because one of my nieces said "I had the best day of my life" when she was leaving and I heard it. Makes me SO happy! I wish things had been different &amp; I had kids.

1334272902993227776 2020-12-03 07:07:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KahlGordon Thanks for the suggestion friend!
1334175641202290690 2020-12-03 00:40:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Mainstream media / journalism is just atrocious. I can't even stand to look at my internet home page anymore. 100% negative Trump coverage. It's all left wing articles. No conservative / right news even shows up. So tiresome.
1334041064647368707 2020-12-02 15:45:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AntiWhiteness Absolute Commie bullshit.
1334039690396258305 2020-12-02 15:40:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DavidGoliath48 DEFINITELY. I should have added that because they are radicalizing Americans by the minute with their bull crap.
1334037355737526272 2020-12-02 15:31:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CEOErickHayden Where are the American European organizations that get to make "agenda's"? Oh that's right we don't get any and when we do get something it's for ALL RACES and religions. I think we have had enough of Jewish policies. They are always opposite of what Americans vote for.
1334034490176512002 2020-12-02 15:19:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It's not Trump that is radicalizing Americans...it's the DC cabal "Big Club" that is radicalizing Americans. We are sick of their shit!
1334033624761561088 2020-12-02 15:16:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Its shit like this that pisses me off. He just skates on by. No one is EVER held accountable in DC. Just us normal average American folks get punished for simple things like speeding! It's so effing ridiculous. Now he gets a cushy job teaching? WTF.
1334008647798714370 2020-12-02 13:37:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So I guess this has happened to a TON of people today! Not just me.

1333622775001583617 2020-12-01 12:03:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @technician9999 @LassMacarthur Agree. They should fix it!
1333622522068283392 2020-12-01 12:02:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianHe51818219 @LassMacarthur 😂😂I actually took this entire year off of dating, LOL Yeah, I'm sure a lot of men don't know much about gas lines, takes a real handyman :)
1333622092722475008 2020-12-01 12:00:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @technician9999 @LassMacarthur My brother said he watched for 10 minutes and then it went out. Turned gas off and back on too. Yes, it's still under warranty, I am calling the number tomorrow.
1333621709128278017 2020-12-01 11:59:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @monkeybutthinks Yep!
1333621597299761159 2020-12-01 11:59:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianHe51818219 @LassMacarthur bahahaha I know right? I plan to go back to dating soon!
1333621362280308737 2020-12-01 11:58:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @love_whiteppl hahaha yeah, I am getting it taken care tomorrow, cuz that just won't fly! haha
1333616100416892933 2020-12-01 11:37:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SiegAmBach 😂😂😂😂😂😂👍
1333613788994695168 2020-12-01 11:27:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Simplyceltic2 Yes, thank you!!!
1333613549072080897 2020-12-01 11:27:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Pinandpuller That is a top suspect.
1333609590278250499 2020-12-01 11:11:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TheRealZafak @LassMacarthur My basement flooded back in April and that is why I bought this new one, LOL
1333609375374733314 2020-12-01 11:10:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 Yep, on the one I replaced, had to change Thermocoupler seemed like every 6 months.
1333607156151701504 2020-12-01 11:01:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LassMacarthur It's Gas. Only 7 months old and it will light, it just won't stay lit.
1333606810859794435 2020-12-01 11:00:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Simplyceltic2 Yes, but it's still under warranty. So I want to check with the company first :)
1333593813311434753 2020-12-01 10:08:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Colby_Malsbury Thermocouple is definitely one of the suspects. I still want a technician since it's only 7 months old and under warranty.
1333591968551755776 2020-12-01 10:01:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JellyBe77861003 yeah, it's so dumb cuz it's only 7 months old! Frustrating.
1333591437359927296 2020-12-01 09:59:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Hunter79Matt 😂
1333591233483169792 2020-12-01 09:58:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So I purchased a water heater in April and now it won't stay lit. Will have to call tomorrow and find out what the heck is going on. Little things like this stresses me out. I have no hot water!
1333590154569715715 2020-12-01 09:54:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PeckPolitics Agree. Not my fight and they vote against me anyhow.
1333588527007887360 2020-12-01 09:47:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Gross. Do NOT do this.  https://t.co/7sGu1SBoZd
1333588359332192258 2020-12-01 09:46:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I have seen so many Trump signs still posted up in Iowa. Pretty cool. We are definitely Trump country. Trump can be President of Iowa. I'm okay with that :)
1333587586758144000 2020-12-01 09:43:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I got a 6ft wide x 4ft old green school chalkboard for free. Can't wait to let my brother's kids draw to their hearts delight on it. When I was a kid I loved writing on the chalkboard at school.
1333585056468770816 2020-12-01 09:33:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Iowa flipped a 14 year Democrat house seat red by just a victory of 6 votes. Crazy close! Would be nice to get rid of any sanctuary city spots now.
1333584210804813825 2020-12-01 09:30:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @remrami9 From information I read, it was a surprise attack. They welcomed the Indians in that day and then the Indians did a surprise attack.
1332409628685201409 2020-11-28 03:43:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TGRZZZ9 No, I am from Iowa.

1331692749289091074 2020-11-26 04:14:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @wesmoms1 I just found out late last night that there was already a settlement for Black farmers called "Pigford" settlement. Of course some blacks "lied" and it was riddled with FRAUD and tax payers paid for it. Another transfer of wealth based on lies!
1331692208777539585 2020-11-26 04:12:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TetraQuasar4 You cracked me up with this comment, hahahaha
1331692085636968454 2020-11-26 04:11:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TetraQuasar4 LOL I think we made up because he followed me again later. But yes I need a much older man :)

1331523198207352833 2020-11-25 17:00:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> WTF. These New World Order communists need reigned in, yes Biden is one of them.

1331474201522425858 2020-11-25 13:46:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SouthPoleRJ @14froger14 @SelimSeesYou LOL you guys!
1331466528718524416 2020-11-25 13:15:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What a great idea!
1331464503695974401 2020-11-25 13:07:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There seems to be a problem with lying and exaggeration. But nobody corrects it! Except Scott here, but how many Americans saw this and now believe it?
1331463261359890432 2020-11-25 13:02:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This was an act of war and a majority of Americans don't even know it.
1331456871908208641 2020-11-25 12:37:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoGuiltStoic Sorry. I will try to do better.
1331447900992319488 2020-11-25 12:01:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Trump flu? LOL it originated and started in China! Is Trump responsible for the flu there too? What about the sorrow of the men who have died in the wars we fight for Israel to exist? You ever think about them or nah?
1331437579724595203 2020-11-25 11:20:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @punished_spirit 😂😂

1331432784976556036 2020-11-25 11:01:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> When did education take a down turn? Where in the timeline is that pivot occur? Find that and then see what happened / changed. But left leaning teachers and Marxist Professors, along with those that deeply hate White Americans and our nation are a HUGE problem.
1331430960529887233 2020-11-25 10:54:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianHe51818219 Thanks, I blocked it.
1331428904695951362 2020-11-25 10:46:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> How many illegals and fake votes in that tally there Dan?
1331427568604614656 2020-11-25 10:40:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nightwatchB5 They going to arrest me for speech? I haven't done anything illegal.
1331427009969475587 2020-11-25 10:38:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Uh...maybe you should. I mean you think you are oppressed and that I have some magic "white privilege". Anyhow, I don't give a crap what you think or what you have to say. It's repeated drivel. It's like you are all programed to say the same things, LOL
1331426036190490625 2020-11-25 10:34:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> yeah uh...cuz I own a horse. You mad I don't use my real name? I know how you all like to harass people.
1331425587953537024 2020-11-25 10:32:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why do you guys do this to Americans whose ancestors, like my Great Grandfather who fought in WWII, refer to everything you don't like being "Hitler" or "Nazis" when it's 2020? Please tell me why my Great Grandfather would NOT regret saving you? Thanks!
1331425190685925376 2020-11-25 10:31:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> OMG....let me guess...are you Jewish by chance?
1331424840981606402 2020-11-25 10:29:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You sound mentally unstable. But then again, most of you usually are!
1331394055096446982 2020-11-25 08:27:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> For crying out loud....LET OUR PEOPLE GO! Stop discriminating against White people and importing foreigners into OUR education / universities! END diversity quotas &amp; Affirmative action and let the BEST MAN win!
1331393764099825665 2020-11-25 08:26:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Maybe we wouldn't struggle against China besides of course the selling out of jobs and manufacturing that took place. But if we didn't have Affirmative Action and discriminatory race quotas, perhaps if we elevated smart innovative people based on their intelligence we would soar!
1331392429577138180 2020-11-25 08:21:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FabricsData @odinroot Yes, just need to get the ball rolling.
1331391387129012233 2020-11-25 08:16:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @goodforharriers @maldrannon @NationalistTV @DarrenJBeattie White people better start fighting for their civil rights and against this blatant discrimination. Either we have what they call "equality" or we don't. Giving preferential treatment is NOT equality. So do they want equality or not?
1331391036585893889 2020-11-25 08:15:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @goodforharriers @maldrannon @NationalistTV @DarrenJBeattie If anything Booker's anti-White hate for White farmers needs to be highlighted. Look at how many have struggled that didn't sell out to large Big AG. This is a national DISGRACE to highlight one race's plight over another race. FUCK that noise!
1331390649015427073 2020-11-25 08:14:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @goodforharriers @maldrannon @NationalistTV @DarrenJBeattie He can't over look what has ALSO happened to White farmers in America. This bill should blow up in his face and blow up HARD with laughter and mocking! He should be shamed for it completely out of Congress!
1331390251261186048 2020-11-25 08:12:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @goodforharriers @maldrannon @NationalistTV @DarrenJBeattie White people can't even buy land. Many of us don't make enough money. If they give Blacks free land, all hell will break loose. Look at all the White farmers that have been pushed out had to sell their generational farms. Booker's bill is OUTRAGEOUS &amp; shouldn't EVEN be written.
1331389622119751685 2020-11-25 08:09:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @odinroot @FabricsData Men, lets fight about religion AFTER we win! Now is the time to unite against our enemies :)
1331387753389494273 2020-11-25 08:02:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Shut the fuck up. this shit is getting old.
1331387541245849600 2020-11-25 08:01:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> A patriot should purchase it and turn it into a Nationalized America first ONLY network. Or maybe all of us Americans chip in and buy it just to shut it down forever!
1331383432212078594 2020-11-25 07:45:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cattitude622 @JNJNews UNBELIEVABLE.
1331383372212559876 2020-11-25 07:45:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL What did you donate to the White Male suicide rate? What about drug abuse among poor White areas? Oh sorry....I forgot only Black people get donations from Billion dollar corporations...my bad!
1331382439625842688 2020-11-25 07:41:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Also I am not a leader....but I am ready to fight for what I believe is right. All of this just doesn't go away with Senile Senior and Immigrant Kamel toe. They are sadly mistaken. I'm waiting to see exactly what Trump is going to do. #StandingBy
1331381578732351489 2020-11-25 07:37:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember we have to direct our energy to those at the top and upper mid levels of the pyramid. They think Biden radicalizing White Americans &amp; Trump supporters will give them the civil war of white and black. I refuse to give it to them that way! That's how Soros makes $$$$$
1331380713661280256 2020-11-25 07:34:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JenniespromoK Yeah exactly would rather go out with a fight then bowing down to this crap! They need to be made miserable and every move they make obstructed but LEGALLY of course. Whether it's lawsuits to tie them up, or annoying protests, twitter swarming their feeds, burning up phone lines.
1331379770723082246 2020-11-25 07:30:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Anyhow, just had to get some of this off my chest. Things get bottled up inside when years go by and Congress / Elites don't listen and do exactly the opposite of what we vote for and what we want. They don't deserve our "unity". They split us a long time ago! #AmericaFirst
1331379309039284226 2020-11-25 07:28:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Not promoting violence or burning shit down like the left Antifa / BLM, but remember our enemies have names and addresses. We have the right to peaceful protest as we see fit. We do NOT have to make this easy for them, they have done nothing but obstruct what we voted for!
1331378230163611665 2020-11-25 07:24:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Friendly reminder when the media, shitlibs, Elites, Politicians, and every Globalist attacks Trump they are really attacking YOU, for your political voice, your vote, that put him in office and that he represents a WHITE person. Believe me, it's personal, VERY personal!
1331377159936614405 2020-11-25 07:20:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Get involved in your city council, your local government. Be ready! My govenor Kim Reynolds is already compromised. There is a settlement office in Des Moines, may or may not be Jewish led. But I can protest &amp; knock on doors in my county if they attempt to undermine our voice!
1331376482342608899 2020-11-25 07:17:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If they attempt to bring in any, KNOCK ON DOOR. Educate your neighbors that tax dollars fund bringing them here, then fund them for 3 months on welfare and many NEVER go off the welfare and they are NOT tracked. You aren't helping refugees when you are destroying your own nation.
1331375824512167937 2020-11-25 07:15:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember we can still fight the Refugee Contractors locally! They have been flooding us with hostile and foreign cultures that don't belong here using OUR TAX DOLLARS, getting bloated on hating White Christians since the 1980's! ENOUGH of that outdated destructive program! END IT
1331374795330555912 2020-11-25 07:11:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Really I haven't. It's the same old people, same enemies, same thing over and over. Until we remove them, nothing will change.
1331374351720075265 2020-11-25 07:09:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> They are too busy policing our speech as it is and putting labels on Trumps tweets! They don't have time to "improve" twitter.
1331373195618816006 2020-11-25 07:04:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I went further than that. I unplugged the television back in 2017.
1331372389062602754 2020-11-25 07:01:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Is there some hidden law in the Constitution that says you have to worship Brown and Black people and hate the Founders and European founding stock *me* in order to be in Congress or ANY position in the government we built? Like WTF is going on? I'm ready to shut this crap down!
1331369812765892612 2020-11-25 06:51:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember, Trump donated his salary for 4 entire years! None of those fucks in DC would EVER have done that. You have no idea how much I despise those skin walkers right now! #PissedOff
1331369378693214209 2020-11-25 06:49:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> GOP talking about being the "minority party" now, They really make me sick. They are all about pandering to identity politics for EVERY race except White people. If you speak for White they send out a massive campaign to dis-avow you in YOUR OWN COUNTRY. FRAUDS, the whole lot!
1331368678462550017 2020-11-25 06:46:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So now after 4 years of HARD CORE pandering to blacks about some made up fantasy called "BLEXIT" the GOP and their hacks are pushing for Hispanic / Latino now since for the first time ever a small portion of them voted for Trump. LOL anything to avoid addressing WHITE people.
1331367313174630402 2020-11-25 06:41:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Trump's not perfect and we didn't hire him to be polite and angelic. I can't believe some of these turncoats that say "civility" and need "politeness" when we have raging Angry Black and Brown politicians &amp; had a violent year from Antifa &amp; BLM destroying 2 billion in damage cost.
1331366438385414146 2020-11-25 06:37:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Marco Rubio has a "lazy eye" and I don't trust him. He looks and acts shady has hell. Never going to like that guy. He probably writes amnesty bills on his days off just for fun!
1331365822296707074 2020-11-25 06:35:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> "America First" is the real movement that Trump started. It's not going away whether the serpents remove him from the equation or not. They don't understand this. We aren't going back to sleep!
1331364665327226881 2020-11-25 06:30:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Obama talking about controlling the internet and what gets out to the masses. These are the REAL TYRANTS but the left cheers them on while it works in their favor....for NOW. The left really are useful idiots. Obama is using Netflix to test the waters!
1331364079877894146 2020-11-25 06:28:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Media and serpents denying any global new world order, yet are promoting "Build back Better" and be friendly with China not only in America, but Canada and Europe. LOL but it's just a conspiracy they say!
1331363453903265792 2020-11-25 06:25:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> United States Chamber of Commerce hates American workers. If you are White European American they TRIPLE hate you. Pretty crazy the people that built the Government and entire system are the most resented in the system that they built that they use against us! This is nuts.
1331361848000729091 2020-11-25 06:19:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Middle America really deserves to have it's own Washington DC. WE need to close up the global embassy in the Northeast!
1331352800987635712 2020-11-25 05:43:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Tom04261935 You are welcome too :)
1331352498360229891 2020-11-25 05:42:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Tom04261935 😂👍😊
1331349167785046020 2020-11-25 05:29:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Tom04261935 hahah it's the truth! LOL
1331347980927066115 2020-11-25 05:24:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> United States of George Floyd and the Republic of "I hate White people".
1331347424825266177 2020-11-25 05:22:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @odinroot Nothing more suicidal for a nation than granting citizenship to ONE MILLION legal immigrants EVERY SINGLE year and giving them voting rights to change and affect our nation when they have ZERO skin in the game!
1331343576656179207 2020-11-25 05:06:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If White European and you are aware of what is happening and going on with all the Anti-White policies and hate, don't get crazy &amp; lose your job. Quietly build network in your community, invest for YOUR children, don't donate to anything &amp; stop helping people that hate you!
1331341765819949059 2020-11-25 04:59:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> No one is looking out for poor White or even White middle class. We have to unite and take care of ourselves. No one is coming to save us. We only have each other!
1331340457192927236 2020-11-25 04:54:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KingBaldwinIV I adore your praise King!!!!!!
1331340377094238214 2020-11-25 04:54:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> White people better start investing in and helping other White people because Politicians in Congress aren't going to give you shit! They only want to help Black and Brown skin tones. Our children are discriminated against. Better think of their future now, shit is going bad!
1331338889299169280 2020-11-25 04:48:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AwokenNord I like rope!!!!
1331338770285797380 2020-11-25 04:47:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AmericasGolden Funny you should say that. My thoughts for Civil war have been ramped up the last few days. If it happens, we have to war with the Elites! Fighting blacks and browns foot soldiers is a WASTE of time. The elites want us to do that. We have to fight the top of the pyramid on down.
1331338270677082117 2020-11-25 04:45:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Corey Booker is a HUGE mistake.
1331337251440226306 2020-11-25 04:41:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Uh....I take issue as a poor White European American that you are going to give 160 acres to ONE race in what you all call the "melting pot". Sounds pretty fucking racist to do that. Black supremacy? P.S. there is already minority loans for farming. DISCRIMINATION
1331336519785861127 2020-11-25 04:38:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Matt Klapper is volunteering to pay the "Bailout" that will happen when they realize farming = actual work 365 days in a year, and they can't make their payments on the loans!
1331336029375180804 2020-11-25 04:36:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Farming is A LOT OF WORK. No days off EVER! Just saying, if that is "racist" then so be it. Work is racist I guess.
1331335182046126086 2020-11-25 04:33:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> OMG...I see "Paul Ryan" trending. Uh....no thanks! Hate that guy.
1331334672081711107 2020-11-25 04:31:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> When you have a politician saying to just quietly let the Elites handle the crumbling nation around you and not attempt for any type of "Greatness" but just decline! I think that freaking Politician needs booted the hell out! That's like telling your child just be dumb, accept it
1331334010983866371 2020-11-25 04:28:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Bloomberg and Bezo own their OWN radical left media outlets. There is a problem when our Elite ruling class owns the propaganda being pumped and dumped on us. Now they put their dirty paws into our elections. These are not men of Good Character by the Founders standards.
1331332964777652226 2020-11-25 04:24:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Marco Rubio saying Biden's "Ivy League" cabinet will see us over our decline as a nation. That's the problem! These fucks think they are BETTER than us average Americans. They ignore our demands and votes and they run our country as they WANT and they have DESTROYED this nation.
1331332250756116482 2020-11-25 04:21:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I am shocked that this is so hard for so many people to grasp. Think about it! It's like me going to Africa as a foreigner and saying I am going to take care of Africa and vote for it's best interests when I have NO roots there or skin in the game! They are all FRAUDS.
1331331717362290690 2020-11-25 04:19:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Bush, Obama, Clinton, Biden....they are all the same freaking political party. It's part of the DC club that rules over us and doesn't even represent us in any shape or form. It's a total global business being run with OUR money for their profit ONLY. I'm fucking sick of it!
1331331105346236416 2020-11-25 04:17:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Marco Rubio is the example of why recent and 1st generation immigrants should not be allowed in Political office and making decisions for a nation they have NO roots or historical ties to whatsoever. Just because he says or does something good ONCE, does not make up for the bad.
1331330369971507203 2020-11-25 04:14:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Trump needs to go full scorch earth on these serpents. Leave no rock un-turned, expose everything, de-classify, and  give as much power to us as he possibly can for us to fight against the abominations in our country. #MakeElitesScaredAgain #EnemyOfThePeople
1331329093871284229 2020-11-25 04:09:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Told you illegals would vote for Biden. His "amnesty" was a dog whistle! How you like them illegals in our country now? Still feel sorry for those scabs? It's us or them. There is no longer an in-between. Congress solution to their inept ability to enforce law is always amnesty.
1331327206992334850 2020-11-25 04:01:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FBawroski 🥰
1331327063555530753 2020-11-25 04:01:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ Yeah, Biden didn't even have Oprah shilling for him 24/7 hahaha
1331325842086121475 2020-11-25 03:56:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @politico Translation: "Long washington experience = Establishment Non-Patriotic globalists will continue to line their rich pockets selling out what is left of America.
1331325203004067840 2020-11-25 03:53:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> "America's decline" just said so nonchalant that we are crippled and falling apart, but it will be done politely and orderly by our "Ivy League" elites! LOL is there anything more demoralizing Rubio would like to tweet? Just take the bullet to the head America you can't be GREAT!
1331324294597636100 2020-11-25 03:50:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> These serpents really hate us. They want 2 make sure we NEVER have a voice in our own nation. These are the moments that create revolution and revolt. They think we are too comfy in our life styles, too fat, too dumb, and too easy to control to do anything. #MakeElitesScaredAgain
1331323452779753472 2020-11-25 03:47:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Pinandpuller That's a negative NO!
1331323376422547456 2020-11-25 03:46:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Still can't believe the media thinks we are so retarded that they keep selling the idea that Biden was a more popular candidate than Obama and received the most votes in history. LOL I really can't stand those serpents. #EnemyOfThePeople
1331322620265033729 2020-11-25 03:43:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> In 4 years we won't even be called America anymore, shitlibs and the Black Caucus will rename our nation "United States of George Floyd". Corporations will have stations set up for White European Americans to wash their Black and Brown coworkers feet over their lunch hours.
1331320963955372034 2020-11-25 03:37:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If we mass deported illegals like a sane Nation would do when it's reached 30 million of them, this wouldn't be a issue now would it? Shitlibs love their tacos and curry and orgasm at the site of burkas! Re-open those China tourist birthing stations too! Yippee!
1331320243378065411 2020-11-25 03:34:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Well this is what amnesty does. WE won't even be a nation after 4 years of this senile man. He can't wait to unload the migrants on us. We just love our fat central American welfare recipients with kids in tow and one on the belly to birth in our hospital for free. Yay!
1331318455774097409 2020-11-25 03:27:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh so the Black Caucus decides for the entire of America to change Military property names now? I guess they think "George Floyd" is suitable? I mean do they want to rename everything in our country after MLK? Can't just leave things alone, always something on the list to attack.
1331168407790776320 2020-11-24 17:30:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ChuckGrassley @GrassleyWorks Heard a rumor on twitter that Grassley is FOR the amnesty of 11 million illegals. I live in Grassley's district, voted for him and if he grants law breakers citizenship I will NOT vote again &amp; my little mouth will run opposition all over the county!
1331165944417316864 2020-11-24 17:21:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Nothing to see here....just a Jewish guy admitting they push multiculturism in European majority countries.
1331160362067120128 2020-11-24 16:58:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It was all by design. I'm appalled at what the elite class has done to small business owners.
1331158678473502720 2020-11-24 16:52:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I made a small vanilla cake and ate it in 2 days. If I get fat, it's my own fault. 😂
1331157308840308736 2020-11-24 16:46:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Biden selected John Kerry.  JOHN FUCKING KERRY folks! LOL  If you can't see what is going on, then I don't know what else to say.
1331156916282789889 2020-11-24 16:45:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LMAO at the GOP thinking it will exist without Trump. They are dumber than I thought! No Trump then no GOP. The GOP was dead already before Trump.
1331155871796178951 2020-11-24 16:41:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So weird that everyone Biden is appointing is someone I despise. This is not a coincidence what they are doing. It's everyone from "the big club" to finish off their destruction of a nation they stole from us. #1776
1331155050522157056 2020-11-24 16:37:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If you are White European American OR if you are a Trump voter / supporter, the ruling class / establishment "big club" really, really hates YOU. I'm not letting them cancel shit! I will be celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with family!
1331154091922370561 2020-11-24 16:34:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I really despise the media. I don't think there is any redemption for them after everything they have done to us. No mercy, no forgiveness for that lot!
1330004301499027456 2020-11-21 12:25:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Mikesports5 LOL and we are told we need to vote in more Angry Black Women into power. Uh...no thanks!
1329998137122041860 2020-11-21 12:00:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @USRebellion1776 Yep. They don't want White people to see what has been happening and the racial hatred that inside our nation against us. They want to quietly take over then go full South Africa on us. How dare AL politician highlight the war on whites they say! Stay sleeping!
1329992561549828096 2020-11-21 11:38:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Ears2Hear2 😂👍
1329985974743560194 2020-11-21 11:12:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> White European Americans brought the idea of "Libraries" and built them in America. The Library is White European American culture. #WhoWeAre #AmericaCulture #EuropeanCulture #AmericaFirst #ancestors
1329984932110852096 2020-11-21 11:08:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You aren't from America remember? You aren't even BORN in our nation. You do not belong in Congress.
1329981363144040448 2020-11-21 10:54:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @sendaulas A White man.  https://t.co/3QJSnJZuSA

1329980693183668228 2020-11-21 10:51:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Friendly reminder, European Americans established Libraries in our nation. Also the "Library" is Latin. Libraries originated from Alexandria / Middle East / German / Russia so is European in it's origin.  https://t.co/GAh22uOMXp
1329977084513562626 2020-11-21 10:37:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TQ________ I hope so! I refuse to allow this to continue and my brother's children pay for it. We have to fight for civil rights of White people. IT's insane what has been allowed against us in our OWN nation.
1329975591681056768 2020-11-21 10:31:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why is this racial hatred acceptable just because she isn't White? Wouldn't her jaded hate affect her ability to edit and not be bias? When does a job because a personal revenge on one race of people?
1329974580702801920 2020-11-21 10:27:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If they were White supremacists how did you even get a job working there? That doesn't make any sense. Why would a library that staffs so called "White Supremacists" even hire you? Sounds to me like you just hate White men AND White women and use a racial slur against them!
1329972916071636992 2020-11-21 10:20:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @3502zippo You aren't edging in on anything, we are all a team!
1329968910762975233 2020-11-21 10:04:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KingBaldwinIV OMG. LMAOOOOOO
1329967807090614273 2020-11-21 10:00:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Is there too much "Brown-ness" in Libraries in the Middle East or Africa? Is there too much "Chinese-ness" in libraries in China? Do you realize how ridiculous you are? Why must you ruin everything?
1329967317187432451 2020-11-21 09:58:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Can you write about ANYTHING else besides "muh racism" "muh Whiteness"? Do ANY of you have any original ideas at all? I mean seriously...."whiteness in Librarianship" in a European founded America majority since 1960, uh yeah...the Librarians WOULD be "White". Not complicated!
1329957764714651649 2020-11-21 09:20:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nativesouthronx I think you are super nice, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

1329589361168539649 2020-11-20 08:56:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I went to a shop local event this afternoon with 2 of my Aunt's. Had a great time. Remember to support your Main Street :)
1329585395970039809 2020-11-20 08:40:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yep, I saw it. I posted screen shots that night.
1328659151455727616 2020-11-17 19:20:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @UvaisAkhtaev @CityBureaucrat 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1328656665244262400 2020-11-17 19:10:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @projectcamelot @OneVoiceUS Biden campaign purchased "India bot farms" to help like and push his tweets. Even his twitter is a FRAUD.
1328642499854917633 2020-11-17 18:13:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DejaRu22 @PirateBronze Example: The Kardashian series rotted the brains of so many women. Sex in City rotted the brains of so many women.
1328636561781649408 2020-11-17 17:50:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Weird.....media says "New World Order" is a conspiracy theory and anti-semitism, LOL  But it's okay when Trudeau and Beetlejuice say it and acknowledge it exists.
1328631636704063489 2020-11-17 17:30:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LeeSmithDC I tweeted something similar saying that it's like everything is going back to 2016 with them inserting Biden. All the old establishment being put back into positions, etc.. to finalize the last push to transform America permanently. Example: Open borders, 500K refugees.
1328622076366893056 2020-11-17 16:52:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DonnaFiducia @USA_Infidel247 I would like some statistics as well. Breakdown who exactly owns this debt. If it is women, what did they study exactly? I don't think Americans should pay off the debt of radicalized female shitlib feminists that hate men and think our nation is racist.
1328618480946581505 2020-11-17 16:38:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RealFamousMorti @PrisonPlanet hahaha true!
1328608321025216512 2020-11-17 15:58:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PrisonPlanet This guy sounds bonkers and dangerous. In a healthy nation he would be put on a National Security threat list.
1328607149774270466 2020-11-17 15:53:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoGuiltStoic 😂😂
1328601486285299713 2020-11-17 15:30:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't like Graham, but there is no way in hell he said that. You are grasping in thin air now because you are FRAUDS.
1328600865385668610 2020-11-17 15:28:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TomFitton @tfamilyfriend Bezos is becoming dangerous. What am I saying...he already is dangerous. Owns his own radical left media Washington Post for crying out loud.
1328595593606934536 2020-11-17 15:07:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @YoDatElefant They know if the truth came out and was talked about, their entire freaking system CRUMBLES. Every narrative by the media CRUMBLES...the entire "rainbow" Empire CRUMBLES.
1328594898988228608 2020-11-17 15:04:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @YoDatElefant How are we going to address and fix the problem, when they are hiding the facts from the American people?
1328592959131045890 2020-11-17 14:57:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @YoDatElefant So tired of their lies. Protecting the Black image by sacrificing White Americans lives. Americans deserve to know the truth that Black on White crime is a huge threat. It's dangerous and people get hurt because of it. They hide facts for "racial harmony" at the expense of lives.
1328556206730973184 2020-11-17 12:30:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I have adopted a lot of language from the right on twitter. For this I thank you :) Been reading your tweets for 4 years now.
1328553051079192576 2020-11-17 12:18:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jleach8888 YES, that is normal! hahaha we are meant to go together, but we aren't twins, LOL
1328552651928334336 2020-11-17 12:16:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JadenPMcNeil This is what they will do to all of our children that don't think the way our Communist Elites, Media, and nutty liberal tyrants want them too! This is why I fight. I refuse to hand this type of nation to my brother's children.
1328551735355449352 2020-11-17 12:13:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JadenPMcNeil This young man is being de-personed and nobody in Congress cares. This is America now. Whew! Yay for us.
1328550280863035397 2020-11-17 12:07:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Also I don't get the entire competition thing happening among our Women and Men. It's designed to pit us against one another. I have NO problem with my future husband being smarter or more intelligent than me, in fact I prefer it! I will be smarter in some things than him as well
1328549073306198021 2020-11-17 12:02:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RupertVonRipp Yeah, perhaps if we didn't have the 1965 Immigration act and our country INVESTED IN AMERICANS instead we could probably be at a 4 day work week at this point in history. But they decided to make us 3rd world instead!
1328548215680081920 2020-11-17 11:59:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MabelGator6 @HumbleMonke I do agree that work performance and ATTENDANCE goes in to consideration at evaluation times for raises and promotions.
1328545109244309505 2020-11-17 11:46:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HumbleMonke LMAOOOOO
1328544659132608513 2020-11-17 11:45:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I mean I get that this is psychological warfare and propaganda being pushed on us. But what worries me is do we have a lower IQ thing happening that people are actually participating in it and believing it? I understand that some of this is to do with the whole "equality" push.
1328544118851637248 2020-11-17 11:42:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @johniescoffee AGREE
1328544032235122688 2020-11-17 11:42:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @wcg1111 Yeah, I don't go into a damn hissy fit when I have to ask my baby brother to open the pickle jar because I can't get it! Also I prefer a boyfriend be bigger and stronger than me! It's normal.
1328543346676133888 2020-11-17 11:39:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Just like the gender thing. For thousands of years we have had male and female. Even in archeological digs and evidence they don't say, this 4,000 year old skeleton is a transgender that identified as a he/she! I'm really tired of the psychological war tactics being done on us.
1328542279552917504 2020-11-17 11:35:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't understand how in the last decade, people are struggling to understand that yes Men are biologically stronger in physical strength than Women. This has been a norm for thousands of years! Yes, in some rare outlier exceptions a large woman may be stronger than a small man.
1328540938298400770 2020-11-17 11:30:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @lexyacc10 Yes, the whole "Build Back Better" means build back into the hands of the top 1% and shadow globalists. It means going BACKWARDS and giving them MORE power than before!
1328539978025070593 2020-11-17 11:26:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RealFamousMorti @IowaGOP @IAGovernor Believe me if some of our GOOD men decide to run for office, I will support them! I have stated I want STRONG men that will take our country back.
1328538906611109898 2020-11-17 11:22:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RealFamousMorti @IowaGOP @IAGovernor But where are the men of good character stepping up? Men of good character don't want to be politicians. This is a problem! The lady in Delaware is a Nationalist and she is more brave and outspoken then our Republican men.
1328536792749006849 2020-11-17 11:13:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15  https://t.co/JjLYXo66eS

1328535618004070401 2020-11-17 11:09:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RedSqrlNuts Yeah, I had to block.
1328534136009740289 2020-11-17 11:03:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CorintheansXIII @CTLRB I am going to block it. I'm done with it!
1328531002524917765 2020-11-17 10:50:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You got upset that I will not wear a mask and I expressed disappointment with Kim about in regards to the mask mandate, among other things such as Refugee Resettlement and racial profiling insanity. I live here, I think that is okay that I do that in my own state ya know!
1328530335525724160 2020-11-17 10:48:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is what I tried to explain to this person when I said South Korea is a homogenous nation. This person doesn't understand land mass, population, nor age groups, and demographics. Just complaining at random folks that live in Iowa, LOL
1328529773350490124 2020-11-17 10:45:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman I know, they never understand that logic though!
1328528644768030720 2020-11-17 10:41:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Move to South Korea and stop harassing Iowan's is what I would suggest for you :)
1328528244707127296 2020-11-17 10:39:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So Iowans have complied VERY WELL with following mask restrictions according to your article you provided. Doesn't sound like WE are the problem!
1328527887553662976 2020-11-17 10:38:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So then why are you bitching at me and you don't even live in Iowa! I think you have serious issues and might be a control freak. Why don't you worry about your Dallas city and focus efforts there instead of tweeting at Iowan's.
1328527473928245249 2020-11-17 10:36:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Well there lies your problem! What are the demographics in your city? Why aren't they wearing masks? P.S. I live in Iowa and I was tweeting about Kim Reynolds, whom I voted for, and you barged in to tweet at me? Stay in your lane next time in Texas mmkay? Now buzz off.
1328523807812964354 2020-11-17 10:22:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Did you go out and census every single American? Do you live in a city?
1328523108152717312 2020-11-17 10:19:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You cannot compare America who has 360 million people to a country that has 51 million people. Do you not even see your insane logic there? Also South Korea is a homogenous nation.
1328522659399933952 2020-11-17 10:17:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor I am talking about Iowa where I live.  If you want to go out and enforce a mask on every single American that's your dream. I have been talking about Iowa. Also did you go and count every American to get your 65%? LOL Go away with your propaganda. You are a waste of time.
1328519364258263041 2020-11-17 10:04:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor Iowan's have been using the 6 feet apart in all public locations around me. Menards, Walmart, Grocery store, etc..where also it is required to wear a mask. So what in the heck are you even talking about? Do you live in the city?
1328518752426725376 2020-11-17 10:02:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor What is the age group of deaths? P.S. I wear a mask in every store that it is mandated to do so. Where did I not comply? I choose to NOT wear a mask when interacting with my family. IF you don't like that, you can buzz off. I don't care about your personal feelings on my life.
1328517657017126912 2020-11-17 09:57:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor Yes, that is why I have moved on to tweet about other subject material and you keep tweeting at me over my disappointment with Kim. Who exactly here is having a meltdown? LOL
1328517031830941708 2020-11-17 09:55:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor Okay, you win. But please stop saying meltdown. LOL Expressing concern over an entire year of us attempting to "flatten the curve" and ramping up restrictions again is not a meltdown. It's my opinion.
1328516035729907712 2020-11-17 09:51:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor You can't see the coincidence of this coming out a week before Thanksgiving? Also I am not having a mental meltdown, I am merely expressing my freedom as an American and my opinion.
1328515243778183170 2020-11-17 09:48:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor "Along with face coverings being required indoors, all indoor gatherings must be limited to 15 people and all outdoor gatherings must be limited to 30 people. This includes non-religious wedding and funeral events."
1328514536526147584 2020-11-17 09:45:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> P.S. Defund NPR a communist propaganda outlet.
1328514387209048064 2020-11-17 09:44:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL farm equipment is now "sexist". You realize that for hundreds of years men of all sizes weights have farmed. Why didn't you address this issue when a man is 5'8 and 160 pounds versus a woman that is 5'4 and 160 pounds? Could it be that yes we have biological strength diff?
1328511763122417664 2020-11-17 09:34:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor Tell me where this statement indicates ONLY in public indoor spaces? Until I see her say "everyone indoors" means in public spaces and NOT in family homes for private family get together celebrations then it can be construed to mean so!
1328511283243724806 2020-11-17 09:32:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CTLRB @IowaGOP @IAGovernor  https://t.co/w4G5HUGnNs
1328510838517477378 2020-11-17 09:30:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Grassley even sent out a public blast email that for Thanksgiving they are not doing their large family gatherings and wearing masks in support of Kim Reynold's mandate mask operation.
1328509432389627906 2020-11-17 09:25:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Good, as it should be! No more biased Jewish progressive media.
1328507914210979840 2020-11-17 09:19:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> One of the largest disappointments for me was voting for Kim Reynolds, thinking she was actually a Republican. @IowaGOP @IAGovernor She caved on Refugee Resettlement, is pushing "racial profiling" progressive non-sense, now wants you to wear a mask inside your own home.
1328504593131728897 2020-11-17 09:05:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @mrcleansedotcom It's a "she".
1328504094835830785 2020-11-17 09:03:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Weird...yet you are supporting some "racial profiling" nonsense against Police officers in favor of NAACP? Are you a radical Progressive hiding in a Republican pant suit?
1328502381563310082 2020-11-17 08:57:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Kim has been influenced by liberal radicals. In Des Moines she is surrounded by them and continues to push Progressive far left agenda wish list items. It's becoming a real problem. If she is not capable of having a backbone in a liberal hotbed, then we need a Governor that can.
1328500170967961600 2020-11-17 08:48:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It has been an entire year of government control. Iowan's have been more than compliant. You won't stop COVID just as you can't stop the Flu from spreading every year. Kim is no better than Joe Biden at this point.
1328499451632230400 2020-11-17 08:45:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm not going to wear a mask in my own house with my family. If you want to try and break down doors on private property to enforce this, by all means go ahead and try :)
1328478033251012611 2020-11-17 07:20:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FAIRImmigration @NationalistVot1 @JMichaelWaller
1328477115344433154 2020-11-17 07:16:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You sound very GREEDY! It's all about money, never about what it is doing to the American people. This is why you are not a Nationalist but a rootless Cosmopolitan globalist. You put Corporate interests OVER human beings.
1328471867443843077 2020-11-17 06:55:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @flufferstuffs 😂
1328276960938774528 2020-11-16 18:01:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cuckcityy @chris_b4 Woman chiming in here. With your eye color you can do a lot of different hair colors and it will good. But I like the one closer to your natural color. It looks effortless, soft, and feminine. Very pretty! But you should do what YOU like :)
1328273291400851456 2020-11-16 17:46:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jcbonthedl @Interstate_85 Agree! F**k that media elite scum bag! In all the cancellation the left does of people, he is one they should have taken out!
1328258255785750528 2020-11-16 16:47:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Real Veterans rising🔥
1328247154603921408 2020-11-16 16:02:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BaconIlluminat1 Same.
1328244585534005249 2020-11-16 15:52:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PacifistPassive Thanks, and I'm just thinking out loud. We won't know anything until it's all investigated. But we should be pushing and supporting the investigation and audits. As Americans we deserve to know what happened and the TRUTH.
1328242859082997760 2020-11-16 15:45:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vincevega68 Accommodations must stop! We should NEVER have to bend the knee! Our nation was founded by NOT BENDING THE KNEE!
1328240037142597632 2020-11-16 15:34:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvranBrian Yes, I was live tweeting screenshots election night and Trump was winning. I saw it all happen, then the shutdown! LOL  #StillWithHim
1328239409129541632 2020-11-16 15:32:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Now Fauci fraud talking about more lockdowns and keeping us all apart. Biden talking about dark winter and nationwide masks....are they trying to squash the American people who are rising up against the political machine? Just feels "off". Something is going on with the serpents.
1328237986383687680 2020-11-16 15:26:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Late night thinking....what if our grassroots revolt is growing  and the Elites / Establishment did fraud in our election to demoralize us in an attempt to crush our dissent with them?  #StillWithHim #MAGAMillionMarch #AmericaFirst
1328236125752856577 2020-11-16 15:19:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What if Trump did win in a landslide and we are more numerous than we think? What if most Americans are actually aligned and our divisions solely lie with the liberal cesspool cities and Prog areas? #MakeTheElitesScaredAgain #StillWithHim
1328234433716101120 2020-11-16 15:12:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> 1 of the reasons I have not left twitter and become active on the GAB and Parler site is because the left has chased the right out academia, the cities, at their workplace, Church and the public square! I refuse to let them have twitter and another victory. Power grabs must STOP.
1328232568001605638 2020-11-16 15:04:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Please note, I have NOT watched the video!
1328232424455753728 2020-11-16 15:04:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh and also Left-leaning Rise Up DC is lying. We seen the videos. But this is what the left does, deny deny deny!
1328231893322633217 2020-11-16 15:02:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I would like to note again that DC is not used those who voted RED showing up at our capitol. This is going to be an ongoing issue that I have to keep hammering on! DC is too liberal and not a political neutral place. This is a DISASTER for America. It must be broken up.
1328230115537539072 2020-11-16 14:55:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CCM1956 @MistyCa91971213 Is she related to Soros?

1328210023915327488 2020-11-16 13:35:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Bmac50170838 It does seem to trend that way doesn't it!
1328209330559135745 2020-11-16 13:32:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DaveDiametric Really? Well I don't know anything about that sorry! I was just sharing a childhood memory!

1328208389894180864 2020-11-16 13:28:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Ronald Reagan had a fitness program for schools to participate in and I remember I got a iron on patch and a "certificate" faux signed by him in the 80's. 😂😂
1328207443873107970 2020-11-16 13:25:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AnnCoulter @AmericasGolden I do agree that Universities are parasites that should NOT be let off the hook for taking advantage of students access to federal student loans. They EXPLOITED this loophole.
1328206202292088837 2020-11-16 13:20:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MarkDre63207272 LOL
1328205981059264513 2020-11-16 13:19:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Good question, I don't have the answer. But I do know that most people that willingly commit crime usually lack a moral compass anyhow, so other crimes and bad behavior is highly likely!

1328204121720180737 2020-11-16 13:11:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Yep that is like me moving to Mexico and telling them to get rid of "day of the dead" because it offends me. Of course I would NEVER do that! But must be in my DNA ;)
1328203802546216960 2020-11-16 13:10:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HeatherEHeying I'm not surprised. Asians score high on tests, so they are going to get moved out and get to be discriminated against like White's now. Cool...let's see how they like that!

1328202028686905344 2020-11-16 13:03:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DaveDiametric Because we are currently "occupied" terrority!
1328201573940535298 2020-11-16 13:01:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Mostly peaceful BLM protestor.
1328197845816631297 2020-11-16 12:46:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ColumbiaBugle It's so mind boggling that our nation is split and we aren't even united as a country and he is talking about Syria, LMAO These people blow my mind.
1328197318177329152 2020-11-16 12:44:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DaveDiametric @ostrachan I think he means in a general purpose. Obviously there are situations outside of the norm.
1328196278652694528 2020-11-16 12:40:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cazalas7 @HTX_illuminati All we can do is spread the message! Wake them up to look at different point of views, not what has been pounded into their head by indoctrination and white guilt.
1328183290189246464 2020-11-16 11:49:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Foreigners should not be allowed to ABUSE Freedoms our Ancestors put in place!
1328182766144466946 2020-11-16 11:47:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Freedom of Speech was established in our nation by European Americans (White) and any foreigner that comes to our nation to bash White European Americans &amp; hate our nation, complain they want to CHANGE it, should not be allowed to use our freedoms AGAINST us. DEPORTATION is best.
1328180386065735682 2020-11-16 11:37:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nwopuppet My GAWD though must do something about the indoctrination of women in Iowa! What on earth is happening at our colleges?
1328179350009679877 2020-11-16 11:33:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @harovdadawg @MEMcovfefe4 Exactly why Americans value free speech and always have! It's engrained in our DNA and those that here in our country trying to stifle our voices are in for a very large backlash!
1328177705179820032 2020-11-16 11:26:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @johniescoffee You are American for sure,  I approve :)

1328177214710554624 2020-11-16 11:24:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Example: That Singer millionaire and what he did to that small Nebraska town! He should be shamed from public life yet he will never feel the pain his actions caused. He lives in an ivory tower surrounded by others just like him. He feels NOTHING.
1328175871144972288 2020-11-16 11:19:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Rodin451 I continue to say "Merry Christmas" it's VERY American to do so :)
1328174359102492672 2020-11-16 11:13:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> One of the so called benefits of multi-culturism is when "Merry Christmas" became controversial &amp; was changed to "Happy Holidays" after 100 years in the United States of America, Christmas was established as a federal holiday on June 26, 1870. Change the people change the nation.

1328164076309114881 2020-11-16 10:32:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @sellersj17 Yes, GREAT idea!!!!!!
1328163945333596160 2020-11-16 10:32:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts Yep and they are NOT nationalists! Agree 100%
1328163582371041280 2020-11-16 10:30:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HunterAndrews35 I agree!
1328163155269267456 2020-11-16 10:29:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RoarLions2 @rdr70024 I do agree that someone of Jewish descent should not be lecturing or deciding about Thanksgiving and Christmas. Or deciding whether Churches should be closed or open. I think that is over stepping big time. It's not really their place to do so and should sit down!
1328162521707126786 2020-11-16 10:26:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Something Americans need to bring back is shaming of the traitors in our nation. They are allowed to walk free among us after exploiting our people and our resources. The founders would NEVER be okay with that.
1328161839675543552 2020-11-16 10:23:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts Yes, hardly Nationalist at all! Actually goes against everything Nationalism and Patriotism advocates for!
1328158334831255554 2020-11-16 10:09:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @prussiancroat @DavidSc91604412 Nope, ONLY HATE for any past wrong doings which is NOT placed on ANY other race in the entire world! Even some races that have done and committed far worse atrocities! Yet they export our wealth to the upkeep the world as "foreign aid". Why should we when we are SO hated!
1328155532235059201 2020-11-16 09:58:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DavidSc91604412 It is true that they advocate for mass immigration and foreigners, put forth globalist policies, anti-White and Anti-nation organizations. But we cannot deny the sellout that occurred among our own. Politicians and GREED gave NO opposition to these horrid policies. Traitors.
1328154404059553797 2020-11-16 09:54:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DavidSc91604412 They discard us like used up old equipment and machinery! We aren't EVEN HUMANS to these disgusting serpents!
1328153959803056129 2020-11-16 09:52:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RupertVonRipp Yes and now they are trying to push "reparations" lol  it's NEVER ending and goes on and on and on. ENOUGH, we have had it!
1328152673355493382 2020-11-16 09:47:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @InsydeMan @canucklaw1 Someone needs to do a study / experiment on how masks affect a person's oxygen levels. They have those little machines you can put a person's finger to give an oxygen reading.
1328149517762441217 2020-11-16 09:34:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MoodySolaceZeta @vestenatangian Yes, they aren't nationalists. They lack patriotism and loyalty to their own people and nation. They will go set up shop in a foreign land and exploit the people there to make money. They are NOT the same as a Nationalist.
1328147878154559489 2020-11-16 09:28:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MoodySolaceZeta @vestenatangian You are speaking about Elites. You and I are not on the same page here.

1328146814009282561 2020-11-16 09:24:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What has been done to the White working class, the White poor, and White middle class in our nation the last 100 years is ATROCIOUS! Taxes, Taxes, Taxes, jobs outsourced, foreigners pouring in, NO REPRESENTATION in government all to BENEFIT others and to be the most hated race.
1328146183626371072 2020-11-16 09:21:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why was it the middle class White American families duty to be taxed on their labor 2 provide trillions of dollars given  nearly every single nation in this world? Their jobs outsourced helped build China's economy. Affirmative Action denied them work. Free benefits 2 foreigners.
1328144967810883587 2020-11-16 09:16:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Red_Pilled_2016 THANK YOU my friend!!!!!!
1328142558351020032 2020-11-16 09:07:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Let's say we gave and invested in our own people...how many of us would own our homes by now, no mortgage, and have SEVERAL children? But instead ruling elites and Politicians sold OUR FUTURES to foreigners and illegals instead. We have been BETRAYED. #wewereneverasked
1328141936574783488 2020-11-16 09:04:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Let's say this version of America happened instead of 1965 immigration act! Would families be wealthier and have had MORE children and increased fertility rates? I like to believe so! Wages would have risen, people would have been less stressed about finances &amp; opportunities.
1328140579881029636 2020-11-16 08:59:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @l_am_Not_Sure @ColumbiaBugle @DarrenJBeattie hahah yes, sorry you would definitely have to be familiar with your own community to know where to go and what doors to knock on.
1328140255581642753 2020-11-16 08:58:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts hahaha
1328137945593864197 2020-11-16 08:48:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @wally2k316 He thinks he is a model, LOL
1328136977737281538 2020-11-16 08:45:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Can a White European male go to ANY nation and receive free college tuition and affirmative action? Nope. They don't even get that in their OWN nations either. But foreigners and POC, even illegals can get free education / tuition. What is going on with this picture🤔
1328136359463284736 2020-11-16 08:42:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Would like to add to this; A White male has to have a freaking disability to get any benefits and even then most are denied because they are WHITE or be a Veteran. But POC and foreigners get affirmative action, welfare, Billions donated from Corporations, minority loans, etc..
1328134439034101768 2020-11-16 08:35:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @WileEDude I think he is a pediatrician? Which is scarier....has no business with that attitude being around children!
1328130452159418369 2020-11-16 08:19:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @janeofthewester Indeed! People like that come to take advantage of America's system and then bitch about that system and are ungrateful towards Native Americans!
1328129212583211009 2020-11-16 08:14:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Also I am curious. Your family isn't even from America, yet you came here from Columbia to a FREE country that was established and fought for by European Americans and you are bitching about "racism"? If we are racists...how the hell are you in Medical school in our nation? 🤔
1328128647815974914 2020-11-16 08:11:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HeartofTarkus Yep!
1328127891645853696 2020-11-16 08:08:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HeartofTarkus Yes, very wise thing to so :)
1328127684434604033 2020-11-16 08:08:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @l_am_Not_Sure @ColumbiaBugle @DarrenJBeattie Maybe would have to go an old fashion route of fundraising. Door knocking and snail mail.
1328127264899338241 2020-11-16 08:06:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Back2Work2020 LOL
1328127078559080448 2020-11-16 08:05:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So you are a first generation American? Can you tell us if you used Affirmative Action or any assistance that is provided for foreigners or people of color? Did you receive benefits over an American White male who is denied all benefits in America unless he is a Veteran?
1328126023452520449 2020-11-16 08:01:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is a really dumb tweet and that's all there really is to say here. I wonder if this tweet would work in Africa and any healthcare there? Also I would contact this person's hospital and ask for a different doctor if you are White and a patient. Do not trust! Very scary!
1328121365849845760 2020-11-16 07:43:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BasedDialectics @ColumbiaBugle @DarrenJBeattie Agree. Excellent point. We do need an Elite donor class of our own.
1328119628791427072 2020-11-16 07:36:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ColumbiaBugle @DarrenJBeattie Maybe we should start fund raising. People donate to things all the time. What if we set up a campaign to fund raise to create a new organization? Just throwing it out there.
1328117266039402498 2020-11-16 07:26:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HeartofTarkus Yeah but if someone has the virus and they go into the store with a mask on, they go around and touch many items with their hands, then someone else picks up that item and takes it home. The mask does NOTHING.
1328108410341105664 2020-11-16 06:51:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LQ_QEE 😂👍
1328107790863376384 2020-11-16 06:49:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I am selling a Walnut bed, a couple that I do not know came to look at it. They didn't wear a mask, neither did I.  The mask hype is dying!
1328107145225711622 2020-11-16 06:46:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The mask phase is slowly crumbling. They know this...it is why they are trying to ramp it up again. Everyone around me ONLY puts the mask on when going into a store that makes it mandatory. When it's not mandatory in a store, no one is wearing one. A mask should be voluntary.
1328081030591500290 2020-11-16 05:02:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TheLastRefuge2 I was here. I remember this being spoken about in 2016 on twitter.
1328079941330739201 2020-11-16 04:58:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BasedMelania I'm afraid it doesn't get better either. I absolutely hate being single.
1328075875326304259 2020-11-16 04:42:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @itsJeffTiedrich My Great Grandfather fought in WWII and helped free Jeff's people, I am going to celebrate Thanksgiving in his honor as a FREE American and will not wear the mask!
1328074533149028354 2020-11-16 04:36:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Again, another mentioning "nazis" but this time using it to play on your empathy to get you to give up your American freedoms and wear a mask. Psychological tactics.

1327850073665974272 2020-11-15 13:45:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yes, you are right. We are in a war....and we must NEVER relax. Time to bring the strong arm. Bring the hammer!
1327848290822598656 2020-11-15 13:37:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cattitude622 We are supposed to be a First Nation not 3rd world. Total disgrace! I feel bad for you. I hope we can make things safe again.

1327842076780802048 2020-11-15 13:13:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Exactly they don't show mercy, neither should we. Even GOD in the bible destroyed tribes with his armies and showed NO MERCY. Do NOT let these beasts use your morality against you, they don't have any MORALS.

1327827456485683202 2020-11-15 12:15:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> THIS HAPPENED IN OUR NATION'S CAPITOL for crying out loud. This is NOT acceptable and we will NOT allow them to run Americans out of our OWN FREAKING CAPITOL. DC belongs to the AMERICAN people &amp; should be SAFE!
1327826240112365569 2020-11-15 12:10:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If Republicans were like the Democrats...they would call emergency hearings in Congress tomorrow about the violence from radical left Democrat voters foot soldiers Antifa and BLM and they would CONFRONT Democrats face to face asking them if they condone and support what happened.
1327818608089718784 2020-11-15 11:40:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AnneCEmmerich77 ...and of course our Enemy of the People Media won't be tracking and harassing Biden about this. But if the shoe was on the other foot, they would be talking about this for 2 weeks straight!
1327817825889775617 2020-11-15 11:36:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SonOfJapheth @LibertyPact 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍
1327812743638999040 2020-11-15 11:16:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @laurapmccrack @RobinEnochs Yes, reading your bio is sounds like something I would have written myself! hahahaha Welcome aboard Sister :)
1327780149161570304 2020-11-15 09:07:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @odinpodcast LOL tell us how you really feel!
1327779696306757632 2020-11-15 09:05:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CringeNat11 Good! Because I like her movies.
1327773360302874624 2020-11-15 08:40:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ColeClarke That is such an under rated tweet. It really is as simple as that. You did a POWER tweet.
1327772724605964289 2020-11-15 08:37:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I can't believe they tweeted this while their foot soldiers BLM / Antifa is attacking innocent Americans in our nation's capital. Wait...yes I can believe they tweeted this. We must dismantle and end the Demon party.
1327770694327930881 2020-11-15 08:29:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MadMikeTexas @OneVoiceUS @VonWehunt Thanks!
1327769979090051072 2020-11-15 08:26:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> OMG. I can't even with this crap tonight.
1327769141453971461 2020-11-15 08:23:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Phin_48 LMAO well to be fair, we have had to pent up ANY path of release the last 4 years. Some of us would probably explode on any impact!
1327768453382549506 2020-11-15 08:20:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @native_texian 😂😂
1327768219126538244 2020-11-15 08:19:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 YES, you are SPOT ON. They have helped incite this stupid "nazi" brainwashing that has caused this divide in Americans.
1327767562663374855 2020-11-15 08:17:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @unmitigatedrage @MrAndyNgo I understand!
1327763875257790464 2020-11-15 08:02:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @osvanska Same, hahahah after seeing those videos of what they did to Americans in our capitol, I am trying to not fedpost, hahahah but I am so PISSED.
1327763294476787717 2020-11-15 08:00:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @love_whiteppl hahahahahahaha
1327763066143068162 2020-11-15 07:59:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @unmitigatedrage @MrAndyNgo Because they know in DC they will get thrown in jail, not Antifa or BLM. It's the problem of DC being too Progressive left and our capitol is not a neutral place anymore. BIG PROBLEM for us Americans that aren't Progressive terrorists. WE have to break up that place up!
1327762609207209984 2020-11-15 07:57:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HeartofTarkus You are welcome.
1327762426947923968 2020-11-15 07:56:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @mike_macinnish1 Definitely. I don't want future children to have to deal with this. It's not right and they don't deserve that!
1327762252183838726 2020-11-15 07:56:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HeartofTarkus I just liked and retweeted, LMAO
1327762074706071552 2020-11-15 07:55:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 If my nephews want to visit our capitol in the future, he should be able to do so and fly the American flag and show his patriotism as a FREE AMERICAN in his OWN NATION. We deal with this and we clean it up!
1327761470956986373 2020-11-15 07:52:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Melody7473 Back at you Sister Patriot :) AMEN!!!!!!
1327761030299197440 2020-11-15 07:51:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @mike_macinnish1 EXCELLENT. My county is RED. I hope others are networking off line as well.
1327760477233971200 2020-11-15 07:49:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 Yeah, can't even have your children at a patriotic peaceful protest in our Nation's CAPITOL in BROAD DAYLIGHT for crying out loud. This has gone WAY too far and this is NOT what we are going to leave our children. WE deal with this NOW in our lifetimes!
1327758509736407040 2020-11-15 07:41:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Velcro108 @CookieFreshPimp Thank you, I followed you back :)
1327757406110093314 2020-11-15 07:36:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @native_texian Yes, we all share the same enemies.
1327757071505383425 2020-11-15 07:35:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AAugust1970 Thank YOU!!!!
1327756728990109702 2020-11-15 07:34:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Loosey39671884 Trump drove out into the rally today. But I am not going to sit here and argue with you about Trump. IT isn't pro-active and it doesn't elevate us in anyway. It's bickering that helps the left. Sorry, I got better things to do with my time.
1327756253641256961 2020-11-15 07:32:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Anyone against the Bolshevik Color Revolution and their BLM / Antifa footsoldiers I consider an ally at this point. I don't care if you are Christian, Pagan, non-believer, or whatever. We unite and take this thing down. I'm tired of seeing Americans treated this way &amp; beat up!
1327755303157436417 2020-11-15 07:28:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @unmitigatedrage Go check out @MrAndyNgo twitter. He has videos posted of BLM / Antifa thuggery.
1327754299183673344 2020-11-15 07:24:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Anyhow I stand with the my fellow Americans / Trump supporters today. They didn't go there to be violent. It's completely from the thugs in DC that think they own the nation's capitol. Trump supporters didn't do anything to deserve thug violence &amp; it's a SHAME DC is like that!
1327753497090150402 2020-11-15 07:21:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This also comes back to the idea that we have to break up DC. It's too progressive / liberal and no longer a neutral place for Americans with opposing views to peaceful protest or even try to show opposition to the centralized power there. VERY DANGEROUS. BREAK IT UP.
1327752286626603009 2020-11-15 07:16:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There were children and families there today in our Capitol. If we can't make our OWN CAPITOL safe for American citizens, we have failed as a nation. This is really messed up and I have never seen anything like this. Broad daylight thug behavior, not even in the shadows, in open!
1327751497350864898 2020-11-15 07:13:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jazzetc Yes, I do agree we are much more civil in our behavior. I don't know if that is a blessing or a curse right now!
1327750868545003520 2020-11-15 07:10:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Like someone already tweeted. We have to defeat our Ruling class / Elites / Establishment and MEDIA!!!! Then the footsoldiers is just light duty that can be taken care of swiftly.
1327750323264495617 2020-11-15 07:08:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm not saying to go out and get violent or start a civil war. I'm saying that we have a RIGHT to defend ourselves &amp; discussion needs to take place on who is at the top that is preventing these thugs from being thrown in prisons long term. Obviously these are footsoldiers.
1327746911168835584 2020-11-15 06:55:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> These anti-White's/Communists cannot continue to treat Americans this way in our Nation. Been 4 years now we have tolerated it. If people start fighting back, I better not hear one dis-avow or "we're better than that" from soft Conservatives / broke back GOP. People are fed up.
1327746018369298432 2020-11-15 06:51:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You can't even go to DC the capital as a FREE AMERICAN to peacefully protest and stand with your President. I'm sorry, but this is NOT the America I grew up in. It's despicable what BLM Antifa thugs are doing. I'm ready for this cold civil war to be dealt with, swiftly, no mercy.
1327741776145358849 2020-11-15 06:34:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DailyCaller Is the "unity" and "healing" Biden speaks of?
1327738722163568644 2020-11-15 06:22:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @cyclisthater14 Oh shocker....another Jew American comparing today's march to Nazism. They seriously can't stop themselves. It's so absurd and I can't be the only one getting sick and freaking tired of it! OUR GRANDFATHERS helped rescue them and they call us Nazi's!
1327735013085995010 2020-11-15 06:07:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @VonWehunt Antifa BLM thugs think they are so tough and own the streets, but what they don't realize is that we aren't allowed to deal with them legally. Once law is gone, they are in a world of hurt soon.
1327731758570364934 2020-11-15 05:54:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We don't need this Anti-White in Congress. Enough of this crap!

1327369479542673409 2020-11-14 05:55:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> P.S. I'm an American and Donald Trump is still PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES and I will be celebrating Thanksgiving holiday as a FREE American citizen. They can't arrest 350 million people &amp; I will be celebrating the holiday with family.
1327357464153640965 2020-11-14 05:07:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> YES. Fire him. The same guy that denies the violence of BLM and Antifa for the entire year! Get rid of him NOW!

1327023279463395333 2020-11-13 06:59:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> One of the things I feel most betrayed by that doesn't get mentioned much is that Mainstream Media and journalists have been hiding reporting Black on White crime. They want us living in bubbles and hide what has been happening. This is just ONE of their lies! #EnemyofThePeople

1326950329909383168 2020-11-13 02:09:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DavidHriblan Yeah and they never donate to any families that are murdered by Black on White crime either. Always a one way street!
1326941499376939010 2020-11-13 01:34:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rebornhuman2 Yep but your taxes paid to resettle these refugees! Isn't that awesome? hahahahaha NOT!!!!
1326940011254738944 2020-11-13 01:28:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh really? Affirmative Action sure pays good! Wish my brother who is a White male could get access to everything he wanted in the American dream...you know since he is an actual freaking American!
1326938565310296067 2020-11-13 01:23:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So a half a MILLION refugees in 4 years. 500,00 migrants that don't match our culture. P.S. Biden's plan is to make White heritage Americans an absolute minority for 2024.

Then they wonder why we feel the way that we do, hahahaha I am not longer even nice anymore! Civility is gone with those people.
1326783366398685184 2020-11-12 15:06:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GOPLeader @Not_A_Hostage17 Oh hell no! We have had the worse Congress in over a decade, now she wants to allow vote by "text" so she can sit her ugly ass in her giant mansion and not do ANYTHING remotely considered actual productive work for the American people. I am so tired of sand baggers.

1326723883781795840 2020-11-12 11:09:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> YEs I saw that! EXCELLENT NEWS!
1326719943358996487 2020-11-12 10:54:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Fake accounts are popping up and during this time it's important to make sure they are fake and not spreading crap that isn't verified trying to make Trump supporters look like idiots. There is a fake Eric Trump, Fake Rudy, etc.. might be someone being funny, but this hurts us.
1326718786670653441 2020-11-12 10:49:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Good grief....don't breed in Portland. Offspring is looking really "off" there!

1326696145113018372 2020-11-12 09:19:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KingBaldwinIV @EuropeanRevolt Well and I think German WWII when I see it. I'm mostly American, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland DNA heritage. So I would think something that encompasses all Americans and then something that encompasses European would be better. JUST my two cents and I'm no leader, so?

1326694728679776256 2020-11-12 09:14:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @EuropeanRevolt It's sort of like building a "brand" and then marketing that brand to the American people.
1326694298230943751 2020-11-12 09:12:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MarkFen08382362 @native_texian I rarely use youtube so don't know?
1326693086634848257 2020-11-12 09:07:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @EuropeanRevolt IMO Americans don't identify with the swastika flag. I didn't even know what that was before twitter. It's foreign to me and holds no meaning to me. Just my two cents. Symbols can be important in movements, it gives the public a way to recognize a group / organization.
1326691393826336769 2020-11-12 09:00:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> *were   dang it!!!

1326690974744109067 2020-11-12 08:59:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why were the BLM supporters there today? Trump supporters where there because 70 million Americans want a clean and fair election. Sounds to me like BLM was there to cause trouble, like always!

1326680459955367936 2020-11-12 08:17:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LHAxelrod1 LOL no not at all. He listens to a lot of music that is relaxing and doesn't even have lyrics or singing in it.
1326679863240126464 2020-11-12 08:15:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @native_texian LOL I can't even remember all the words now. But I would do it in a "male" country voice twang and it was hilarious. Well to me of course, he hated it but tolerated me doing it every morning, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

I just am against them calling it marriage and treading on my beliefs. Figured the compromise would be "civil union" but don't call it "marriage". But your idea is good! Hope I remember it!

So I feel my test results are off because of that. Thanks that you admitted that, makes me feel better :) I had trouble with marriage question. I think homoglobo is overboard and needs restricted, but okay with civil unions

In hopes that eventually that would be a married man with a family who owns their own home. If someone who was good with research and statistics could see what the results of that would look like?
1325708635914326016 2020-11-09 15:55:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee @DukeofKen @Europinion_ @Griffith_Grif Maybe I should take this test. Sometimes that stuff is fun. Is the link what's at the bottom there then?

I don't have a husband exactly what man are you asking me to give my voting rights up for? LOL I like you, you are smart, I have no issue with your beliefs and that you want patriarchy. But I am not giving up my vote, I'm sorry. Not happening. Hope we can still be friends :)

The only way you are going to get what you want is to build an entirely different country. Look at all the women in Government right now. Wishful thinking really. I'm sorry! We aren't Amish.

LOL But let me say this, the men in America from what I see are a mess, just like women. No way am I going to give up my vote for soy boys. Asking women like me to NOT vote in current elections is suicide. Maybe 50 years?

I just voice my opinion and how I really feel on here from what I am seeing and even been attacked on here. Seen others get attacked by media and radical left and their lives destroyed. I have no clue what the numbers are, just know Trump #'s.

So I will most likely mention that to people once it get's going and is in a good spot. Probably will open an account for $5 and hold it for my nephews when they are older.

I'm not doing anything illegal anyhow, so I'm quite boring, LOL

1325693391007526912 2020-11-09 14:55:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @DukeofKen @Griffith_Grif It also seemed like they promoted health and fitness as well. Which I thought was good. Men feeling better about themselves by being fit, women being more feminine. Really just natural human nature. But I have never had a conversation with Spencer, I watched a video of him once.
1325692974358032386 2020-11-09 14:53:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @DukeofKen @Griffith_Grif Sure there was some men that were fed up and could definitely scrap and fight. But I really think that was a reaction to Antifa and radical violent leftists as well. I felt like everything was really a reaction to what the left was doing. Just my two cents, LOL as an outsider!
1325692498027700225 2020-11-09 14:51:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @DukeofKen @Griffith_Grif I still don't understand the intelligence agencies interest in it really? The tweets I would read weren't violent and many of them seemed to be "virgins" as well and just against degenerate Modern society. Spencer is intelligent though &amp; I think many looked to him for guidance.
1325692053888643072 2020-11-09 14:49:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @DukeofKen @Griffith_Grif Yes, my understanding just from reading tweets from a couple years ago because I haven't joined anything, was that there was no leader really, they felt they didn't have that and it was just a community of sorts..but Spencer definitely came out on top &amp; was labeled as such.
1325690696326590469 2020-11-09 14:44:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @DukeofKen @Griffith_Grif IT definitely got demonized by Media and all the left rag journalists which is pretty much all newspaper and social media outlets. But I understood that the alt right had legitimate grievances and I liked that they promoted traditional ideas. But I support a lot of groups on here

But I never joined alt right because I have an issue giving up my right to vote. I mean I am an older woman, own my own home, come from revolutionaries, am single, I can't do it.

1325676046046408705 2020-11-09 13:46:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif @Europinion_ Two of my Aunts take it seriously, one Aunt though doesn't give a crap and would have her mask hanging off her face like it was a scarf instead. I freaking laugh at her, so hilarious!
1325675303147085825 2020-11-09 13:43:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif @Europinion_ I also think though that Americans are getting tired of the violence too and riots. I have riot fatigue, LOL I have zero tolerance for it at this point. If they were in my area I would be seriously pissed off &amp; want it shutdown immediately.
1325674764980137984 2020-11-09 13:41:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif @Europinion_ AGREE. When it first was being talked about on twitter that COVID arrived, I mentioned to my Aunt about someone from Des Moines airport caught it and I said people are scared, and she said she wasn't worried. 3 weeks later after MEDIA, totally different &amp; was scared 2 get it.
1325673097094193152 2020-11-09 13:34:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Thank you! We are all so very tired of you. GO AWAY FOREVER!!!!!
1325671999696474112 2020-11-09 13:30:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif @Europinion_ People have power to influence other people right? Materials, propaganda, has influenced people. But really I don't know. It's like someone who was an alcoholic and then has to be sober for the rest of their life. It's a difficult task.
1325670750246871040 2020-11-09 13:25:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif @Europinion_ That is a great question! I suppose we would have to look at studies in the past of "de-programming". Maybe living in a different environment and living among people that don't think like that? For example, you take a child from one place &amp; place them in another would they adapt?
1325669671295733761 2020-11-09 13:20:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @Griffith_Grif It's also like the way they feel and think about Whites has become "religion" to them. They literally worship at the altar of hate every single day!
1325668764176818176 2020-11-09 13:17:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BollocksD @Griffith_Grif @Europinion_ LOL
1325668456688128007 2020-11-09 13:16:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ @Griffith_Grif Everything is an attack, that is part of the problem too. You cannot have a conversation with them because they are ALWAYS defensive and you are already the enemy.
1325667296753422340 2020-11-09 13:11:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif @Europinion_ Wow! My mind is blown as well from that story! They can't deviate though from indoctrinated thoughts and HATE.
1325666606173851649 2020-11-09 13:08:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Yes, I almost believe it is a psychological disorder and the mind never leaves the realm of victimization. They can never truly be free because they are bound to that forever.
1325663321962508288 2020-11-09 12:55:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ But it doesn't matter, because they lack the "empathy". They will NEVER EVER have empathy for us. They are not capable of it.
1325662966994391045 2020-11-09 12:54:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Yeah, they use ONLY use our history to weaponize against us! It's hypocrisy and they leave out the rest of the world. Plus they only cherry pick out the events they want too when highlighting our history against us. I'm sick of it.
1325661574879703047 2020-11-09 12:48:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ ....and even if some of the White race did gain Institutional power in their OWN nation how is that wrong? I don't go to Africa and tell them that if Black Africans in their top institutions means they have power over me and must give it up. RIDICULOUS.
1325661103507075072 2020-11-09 12:46:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ EXACTLY...there was always some class warfare among White's. White peasants that lived in squalor and horrible conditions, starvation, and debt...you telling me they had "institutional power"?
1325660472918618114 2020-11-09 12:44:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TuneItMore1 @Europinion_ Or anyone that deep down HATES you and wants REVENGE.
1325659995019599873 2020-11-09 12:42:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @C0staEd Yes, that is what all this tribal behavior they are doing comes down too. White will have to participate whether we want too or not. They are forcing us too. If we stay quiet, we will have ZERO resources and ZERO representation forever. They do NOT care about White people.
1325659357246271488 2020-11-09 12:39:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ It's really disgusting for someone to be in her position and be so blunt about being ONLY FOR BLACK POWER. What would she say if an English man had a White power fist? Would she be okay with that? I have a feeling she would get him fired &amp; his life ruined!
1325657801235066881 2020-11-09 12:33:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why do you have a black power fist in your twitter handle? Who exactly are you trying to rule over and why? Are you only representing "Black" people in your position or all people? Very confusing!
1325654654005473281 2020-11-09 12:21:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts 🥰😘
1325652718229270528 2020-11-09 12:13:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So tired of giving away shit to people who did NOTHING to earn it. Nobody has to work and earn respect. We just give our resources away because "muh immigrant" "muh diversity". Our ancestors are rolling so hard in their graves there must be a hole in the middle of earth by now!
1325651671964393472 2020-11-09 12:09:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @leninpiano Absolutely! Agree 100% you hit the nail on the head!
1325651307512926209 2020-11-09 12:07:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AbsurdlyBlacque @DavidSc91604412 AGREE!!!!!!
1325651136829861890 2020-11-09 12:07:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I refuse to play along with the wet dreams of our corrupt Media and Elite vulture capitalists who are having political orgasms over a mental patient Biden and a rootless clown Kamala. #StillWithHim
1325649810922360832 2020-11-09 12:01:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_Nibelungenlied I will NOT accept them. I stand with my President and I will reject those fraud phonies!
1325648845099950080 2020-11-09 11:58:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Donald Trump EARNED my respect. I saw him pelleted by journalist horrible questions, media harassment 24/7, he fought against the Establishment that wanted Rubio/Haley as their dream ticket in 2016. He weathered a STORM to his victory. Fucking Biden / Kamala was "placed" quietly!
1325647622246457344 2020-11-09 11:53:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Ruling Elite class is FORCING Kamala down our throats, celebrating a woman of color as first VP. She didn't EVEN EARN IT. She didn't EVEN EARN our RESPECT. They PLACED her in that position and forced a false victory and celebration on us that she didn't even weather a storm for!
1325646513637351425 2020-11-09 11:48:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> She is detached and has zero planted roots in my nation. Her loyalty can never be trusted. We can't even trust our American Establishment! There is no Patriotism, their is no understanding or appreciation of what Americans have forged, built, and overcome. Just minorities!
1325644960310448131 2020-11-09 11:42:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> How does an anchor baby immigrant like Kamala understand my grievances as a Generational Heritage American? She can't. This is why they should not be granted the highest authority and power in government in my nation. I don't trust her.
1325636776216719360 2020-11-09 11:10:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_RadicalReality You are welcome!
1325636544359755778 2020-11-09 11:09:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @WmPatrickHenry We never should have gotten rid of mental institutions.
1325636016552763392 2020-11-09 11:07:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Sometimes you drop a penny in a wishing well and that wish comes true! Not holding my breathe though, she is a spoiled brat, she likes attention!
1325635294864027652 2020-11-09 11:04:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @dark_speaks @gatewaypundit LMAO at that picture they used of Biden, he looks like a mentally challenged person, hahahahaha Bravo!
1325634850615943168 2020-11-09 11:02:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Will a immigrant feel any pangs or grief when a historical figure like George Washington the father of our nation is removed because he is White? Will she appreciate the White working class that labored in factories that created wealthy Elites during the Industrial Revolution?
1325634219922644993 2020-11-09 11:00:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> How is someone that is a immigrant a win for me when she doesn't respect my Nation's history and says I am bad because I am White? Her family didn't go through an American Revolution, Civil War, or even the Great Depression or Dust Bowl. How is that a win?
1325633214283730944 2020-11-09 10:56:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is PATHETIC communist propaganda. I don't even know how you are even still in business in 2020. Shouldn't you be bankrupt and gone by now?
1325632558999199745 2020-11-09 10:53:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Advocacy4theDev No way. That adopts the craziness into normal society. That has been the problem. It's a constant snow ball effect. Have to draw the line. Entertaining absurd fads as National beliefs is dangerous! Politics is not Hollywood, fashion, and fads. IMO.
1325631360732717061 2020-11-09 10:48:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Advocacy4theDev Lady/Ladies
1325630064239796225 2020-11-09 10:43:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The radical left wing in America makes crap up as they go and expect the entire nation to just follow along. Like this new "pronoun" crap and the media using "President-elect". Also that men who think they are woman experience a menstrual cycle. This needs to STOP. Fantasies!
1325625565924253696 2020-11-09 10:25:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Delete your account!
1325621122738642944 2020-11-09 10:07:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We don't EXIST in their world at all. When we do, it's to replace us and tell us to shut up while we die in the darkness. UNBELIEVABLE! To see it and watch it all over again is so frustrating. I will NEVER unify with those people.
1325620683167178752 2020-11-09 10:06:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This behavior is what alienated MILLIONS of Americans in the first place and why we voted to Trump as an outsider. We want them GONE. They completely IGNORE us. They are the most disgusting Elites I have ever seen!
1325620063857217537 2020-11-09 10:03:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> They are seriously removed from reality. They are acting like the rest of America doesn't even EXIST out of this fantasy bubble they floating in right now.
1325618561704992768 2020-11-09 09:57:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rickywarwick3 @Interstate_85 😂I just can't believe results have not even been verified and they are just moving along with their fantasy!
1325617701776191489 2020-11-09 09:54:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It's really bizarre watching the Progressive fantasy world playing out with media and a fake President / VP. They really live on some other planet of their own.
1325595826568237062 2020-11-09 08:27:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JoeRudyard It is an issue that will need to faced with. They vote 78% for Progressive policies.
1325595469989498880 2020-11-09 08:26:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LMAO No matter how you try to sell it, chopping off your private parts is still chopping off your private parts! The only vibe Biden has that I get is pedo vibes! Stay away!
1325594303364820995 2020-11-09 08:21:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Hello there! I'm White and I am American in case you have forgotten.

1325564118116528128 2020-11-09 06:21:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Now do if we reversed unlawful birthright citizenship by non-citizen parents?
1325563859638366210 2020-11-09 06:20:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Thanks for supporting me becoming a minority in my own nation when my family has been here since 1600's! I appreciate you shrinking my voting voice! Thanks bigot!
1325559016106446850 2020-11-09 06:01:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Wait Just a Minute! Some Very Good News May Be Coming  https://t.co/4YkIlMc1zJ
1325550709736173569 2020-11-09 05:28:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JadenPMcNeil Agree that the Washington Post should not be allowed to use it's NATIONAL platform and that it is a media POWERHOUSE to go after a average American student with no such resources! The Washington Post have become activists such as SPLC and are no longer "journalists".
1325546135893774336 2020-11-09 05:10:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AustinVittetoe @joallen_ @IowaStateU @IASTATE_Pres jargon [ˈjärɡən] NOUN special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand.
1325544244891824129 2020-11-09 05:02:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @hoodyfirst @joallen_ @IowaStateU I'm embarrassed that you think that anyone who might have Christian beliefs that it's okay to call them a "homophobe"! Or that you think just because someone is against the Marxist Black Lives Matter organization that makes them "racist"? How absurd! People have rights you know!
1325543419394072583 2020-11-09 04:59:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @woody5211 @joallen_ @IowaStateU Please stop drinking soy and have yourself some REAL milk again! Good grief.
1325542930317242370 2020-11-09 04:57:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @sunandinsulin @joallen_ @IowaStateU You have "fuck" in your bio Marisa and you are complaining about other's freedom of speech? I find it disgusting that you have "fuck" in your bio and promote "BLM". Why does everyone have to think like you? You have zero etiquette!
1325542516192587784 2020-11-09 04:55:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @karlys23_ @joallen_ @IowaStateU You have "fuck" in your bio. How is that not disgusting? Sit down.
1325542325465067521 2020-11-09 04:54:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @emmaaday17 @joallen_ @IowaStateU Explain to me Emma, how Black Lives Matter and Abolish Ice is acceptable "speech and behavior" compared to anyone who doesn't think and feel the same way as you? I would love to hear how you have "rights" but no one else does if they don't "worship" your ideas! How Tyrant!
1325541839672406017 2020-11-09 04:52:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @IowaStateU @emmaaday17 Emma has "Black Lives Matter" and "Abolish ICE" in her bio. Is leftist jargon and beliefs the ONLY beliefs students are allowed to have? Isn't college a place for "debate" and "freedom of speech"? Or is Emma's beliefs going to be FORCED upon every single student?
1325541387601924099 2020-11-09 04:51:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @alainaporth @IowaStateU @emmaaday17 Because how are you going to punish Iowan's for "free speech"? Why is leftist jargon and organizations the only speech allowed on campus? Leftists aren't the only one's that have "Civil Rights" but hey...you do you lady! Glad you are in Texas!
1325539553533431809 2020-11-09 04:43:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @pheebzbuffay_ @IowaStateU @hannahoyibo @joallen_ Yes, and that lady seems to only promote "Black Lives Matter".
1325538160554745856 2020-11-09 04:38:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AustinVittetoe @joallen_ @IowaStateU @IASTATE_Pres Are you okay with "Black Lives Matter" being promoted on campus? You think it's okay for students to FORCE others to use leftist jargon like "pro-nouns" when they don't believe in any such thing? You sound like a tyrant that only believes rights and speech go one way.
1325536043257442307 2020-11-09 04:29:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I hope University leaders are aware that FREEDOM of SPEECH still exists in Iowa. Tread lightly and don't even think about treading on Civil Rights of those who don't believe in absurd "Pro-nouns". IF they don't have rights, neither does Black Lives Matter students either.

1325322181803450369 2020-11-08 14:20:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Corner_Boy3 @KingKirmudgeon Oh...you were joking! hahahahh

1325311414064525314 2020-11-08 13:37:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If Trump supporters can't see that everything is going back to what it was before trump, GLOBALIST, ESTABLISHMENT control and the DC SWAMP club, including Israel, then I don't know what else to say. They are putting their boots on our necks!
1325308689172062208 2020-11-08 13:26:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CagneyPowers He moved the embassy for them and SO MUCH more. BACK STABBER!

1325295443409047552 2020-11-08 12:33:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It sure would be nice though if we didn't have activists / haters running our media. They don't even investigate anymore. It's just Washington Post and New York times tips &amp; sources which are left activists. It's a national and even an international disgrace. #UnPlug @Matrix

1325291755504365569 2020-11-08 12:19:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Not to mention all the FOREIGN fake votes! No way China didn't help. Hell Biden has "India bot farms" that pushed like buttons to make him seem popular because he couldn't compete with Trump. It's all FAKE bull crap!
1325291190477008901 2020-11-08 12:16:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Lottie_Web Thank you!!!!
1325290711533629443 2020-11-08 12:15:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Biden saying he will amnesty 11 million illegals to me seemed like code to tell illegals to vote in the damn election! I want all LEGAL votes counted and every single illegal vote that cancels out an actual American voter's kicked the hell out of the counting! #AuditTheVote

1325287828847202311 2020-11-08 12:03:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> People on the right always come in from behind whenever leftists and the media run with some fabricated story or event. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Whether it's a hoax that gets exposed a week later or criminal activity, etc.. They always lead creating a GIANT MESS &amp; truth comes later.
1325287126724915200 2020-11-08 12:00:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What I have learned the last 4 years is that media takes a narrative WITHOUT evidence and runs with it, splatters it all over our nation, then a few days later Trump comes in with the truth and cleans the mess up. I have no reason to think this is different. #EnemyofThePeople

1325271118924705792 2020-11-08 10:57:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Wasn't the last poll taken among Americans like 56 to 65% were against more immigration into America? How in the hell does Biden win an election when he is going to amnesty 11 + million illegals? Things aren't adding up around here. LOL
1325270494275379201 2020-11-08 10:54:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Capo_Regole IT's true, hahahahaha brand new citizens should NOT be participating in our elections. It's suicide! They don't know ANYTHING about what is going on, they have no loyalty to what we built here. IT's ABSURD!

EVERY American left or right should be freaked out and upset about that. That is NOT okay! You can never trust them EVER again.
1325209193826054148 2020-11-08 06:51:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I won't back down, the left wants you to lose your strength and just give up. Media is trying to demoralize you so you abandon Trump.

1324942598801338369 2020-11-07 13:11:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TweetBrettMac UNBELIEVABLE the lengths they go to. So FAKE and manufactured.
1324941405635174400 2020-11-07 13:07:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif Oh my gosh, that sucks. You were in such a beautiful area, I remember your pictures. Yes, a bit more freedom here if you stay out of the bigger towns of course. :)
1324940378085224450 2020-11-07 13:02:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Griffith_Grif P.S. I hope you are doing well friend! :) Take care!!!

1324939136135012353 2020-11-07 12:58:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Kicklighter_uir @Volkisch19 @DizardThunder YES!!! I tweeted a graph showing the HUGE spike in trade deficit and selling out over the beginning of Obama / Biden Presidency a day or two ago!
1324938565994811394 2020-11-07 12:55:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RupertVonRipp @DizardThunder Well hey it can be interpreted many ways hahahaha
1324937892511232002 2020-11-07 12:53:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DizardThunder I have pent up anger for Biden because of that "minority" video where he is all happy about getting rid of European founding stock.
1324937621265637376 2020-11-07 12:51:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DizardThunder I agree with your point though! He is not mentally fit and is just a puppet. He probably has no idea at all what was done. They plan to replace him anyhow with Kamala. It's sad really.
1324937031101919232 2020-11-07 12:49:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DizardThunder Actually I will keep my tweet.
1324936890806661120 2020-11-07 12:49:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DizardThunder True that he is too far gone mentally to even know that operatives committed Fraud. I do agree with you on that. I will delete.

1324934208415031296 2020-11-07 12:38:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You committed FRAUD on millions of American voters and tainted our election process. You are the ENEMY. Not to mention all your previous crimes and back door deals!

1324904819119829000 2020-11-07 10:41:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TrumpsRump5 @pdabrosca To be fair....I am sure the Lincoln Project conned so many of you and kept it hidden they were being supported by Progressives like AOC just out of "Trump hate". You probably had no clue they teamed up with the left to take Trump down.
1324904536272723968 2020-11-07 10:40:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TrumpsRump5 @pdabrosca You just donated/ supported to put PROGS in the government that vote to take away everything you hold dear. They hate your flag, hate your country, and they HATE guns. Not trying to kick ya when you are down, but man....big mistake!
1324904094063005696 2020-11-07 10:38:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TrumpsRump5 @pdabrosca LOL Rick's Lincoln Project teamed up with AOC and the progressives, who want to take away your guns, LMFAO you got SCAMMED and HARD. You just funded a grifter who will take the money and run.
1324903071370125317 2020-11-07 10:34:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts @BasedMelania See...I'm with you...I have a problem releasing them into another country when they hate us so much. They will always be raging for war. Prison, like Gitmo is a better option.
1324891433216708611 2020-11-07 09:48:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KingKirmudgeon @Aristos61950328 @nedryun Yep :)
1324891209865826304 2020-11-07 09:47:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RupertVonRipp But I am happy that they did....cuz now they are calling on them to fund their bullshit for Progressive orgs, LMFAOOOOO
1324890908731518977 2020-11-07 09:46:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RupertVonRipp My GOD....the Lincoln Project teamed up with Progressives. DISGUSTING.

1324887844205301760 2020-11-07 09:34:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @IIlllIIIlIlIllI 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1324878325685346306 2020-11-07 08:56:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JackPosobiec Remember they inspired a man to shoot Republicans at a baseball game. She encouraged this list and potentially could inspire someone out of her 9.8 million followers to become radicalized and do something like that again or WORSE.
1324875943769468933 2020-11-07 08:46:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JackPosobiec Now Congress members need to file an ethics complaint against AOC for encouraging intimidation of political choice and potential terrorism against Americans.
1324863058280407040 2020-11-07 07:55:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Look at what these radicals and Elites, Big Tech, Congress, CIA did to our nation. You can't even openly speak the name of who you voted for, when you could do so only just 8 years ago. This is not my America, we are occupied and we are not Free. Disturbing changes happened.
1324843224230514688 2020-11-07 06:36:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 @P11Bettyboo @DailyCaller 🥰
1324840866612236288 2020-11-07 06:27:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TulipDiana @SIoaneRanger No of course not. In fact left wing violence is supported and encouraged on twitter!
1324838762094993408 2020-11-07 06:19:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 @P11Bettyboo @DailyCaller You are so SWEET!!!!!! I am in not interested in anything at this time though ;)
1324838361371156482 2020-11-07 06:17:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ForLapua @P11Bettyboo @DailyCaller My point is she is a sitting member of Congress with a 9.8 million following sending out that type of rhetoric during a highly divided nation on edge. Unacceptable!
1324837841348841477 2020-11-07 06:15:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yes, agree! That would be the minimum of consequences for her behavior on twitter calling for the threatening and compiling a list of targets (Americans).
1324837101398040579 2020-11-07 06:12:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DHSgov Amy Siskind is keeping a potential list for terrorism against American citizens.
1324835958567690240 2020-11-07 06:08:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What does Amy plan on doing with this list? Inspiring terrorism and to shoot up ball games? What is too far for you?
1324832337037828097 2020-11-07 05:53:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @P11Bettyboo @DailyCaller This is a list compiled to PUNISH Americans in some way, shape, and form. How is this not threatening? This is to silence anyone from choosing who they can politically support / donate too and VOTE for in our United States of America. This is very serious!
1324829123286601729 2020-11-07 05:40:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @P11Bettyboo @DailyCaller Shouldn't some Congress members file an ethics violation against her? This is domestic terrorism.
1324827041565388807 2020-11-07 05:32:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Zerklass @odetoapoet @DailyCaller Of a couple elites! Not 70 million fucking people! GTFO
1324821968437288963 2020-11-07 05:12:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DanCrenshawTX Doesn't matter to you because Israel wins either way. Your life goes on taking $$$ from donors while Americans lose jobs to H1B, Affirmative Action, while you pretend to play "politician".

1324610284141555712 2020-11-06 15:11:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @xlividx Well it's really hard to digest at first. It took me a good 2 years seeing it before I actually had to believe it. It was like there was a barrier that wanted to reject that maybe it was just coincidence, but too much evidence now that it is unavoidable, you have to look at it.
1324607904209657856 2020-11-06 15:01:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @blacksunguy No, because I have been on here for 4 years now. I am just saying that it's one of the most shocking things to my system since becoming politically active.

1324557491695439873 2020-11-06 11:41:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Did your ancestors here in America fight to give you those rights? Oh no...you were brought here as a "refugee" and you nit pick against Americans who want to restrict immigration into our own country after a MASS RAPID migration, the fastest in the world has happened.

1324528364695232512 2020-11-06 09:45:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @freedomsauce He could have....I unplugged from media in 2017. So I have not watched Dobbs since then. So I have no idea ?
1324527646911377409 2020-11-06 09:42:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @freedomsauce Okay!
1324526909099749378 2020-11-06 09:39:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @freedomsauce I like DOBBS. I don't watch media anymore.
1324524398062292992 2020-11-06 09:29:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> When I still plugged in to Media back in 2016, it was DOBBS who I watched :) He has not grifted one single time. Holds the line for 4 years now! TWO THUMBS UP

1324507579922419713 2020-11-06 08:23:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Saxon9Skandi The men that understand the difference between "spirit" and "feminist" are GREAT partners :)

1324494730256961536 2020-11-06 07:32:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @WesternVan123 I would NEVER do that my friend :)
1324494553760567297 2020-11-06 07:31:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @POTUSWayne LMAO I do know what you mean :)
1324494174759067649 2020-11-06 07:29:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> When I look at compromise and sacrifice over the last 60 years, it has been on the side of the RED voter conceding freedoms to the BLUE voter. ENOUGH. We have no more freedoms to give them! They now want your political voice silenced completely. That is NOT AMERICA! Full stop!
1324493684738576395 2020-11-06 07:27:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @pamtime22 Thank you for the encouragement friend :)
1324491539964461064 2020-11-06 07:19:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CustomsFatman OMG. We have to get organized. We can't allow this to continue!
1324491065316003843 2020-11-06 07:17:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 Yeah that tweet and replies is ATROCIOUS and you are probably right, most are Every Single Time
1324490759609995269 2020-11-06 07:16:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I know I am a woman, I know I am not a leader....but so help me GOD I will not live under their BOOTS! I will revolt!
1324490166803877891 2020-11-06 07:13:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jleach8888 Yes, my friend. That is exactly what I am talking about. We have witnessed the worse transformation of our nation from good to bad!
1324489857469681665 2020-11-06 07:12:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @paultykwinski1 They are Communists!
1324488802270908418 2020-11-06 07:08:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I hate to say it because I do love my country, I'm gen X. I've seen the good, now I have seen the bad. We have to break away from the Cities / Liberal cesspools. It's obvious they are no longer Americans. I don't think we can live and share a nation. They are tyrants!
1324487574069645312 2020-11-06 07:03:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> After reading the responses under that Anti-American tweet, these leftists are some of the most ruthless, non-feeling, and tyrant people I have EVER seen in my life. They care about nothing but forcing their views and power on EVERYONE. I will NOT live under their boots!
1324485424593719296 2020-11-06 06:55:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is war.
1324484838901092362 2020-11-06 06:52:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are disgusting and Anti-American. Is this what you call "freedom"? Let's replace the Red States voters? You are no better than those that place regime change on foreign countries. Fucking REPULSIVE!
1324484167824977920 2020-11-06 06:50:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This person thinks this is what America is. Go to Red States and populate them so you can out vote them and displace them in their own native state. Disgusting!
1324483349579239424 2020-11-06 06:46:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Look at this fucking Anti-American. Wants to politically replace American voices and their votes in 3 states!
1324483001158348800 2020-11-06 06:45:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Disgusting and non-American. You don't vote how we like, so we are going to move to your area and fucking FORCE our voting on YOU!
1324478258696642560 2020-11-06 06:26:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> They are preventing this tweet from being liked and you have to quote in order to even retweet it. This is war.
1324472679890669577 2020-11-06 06:04:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 Yes, agree....we should not have to live in their madness. I'm 45 years old and never had to address genders and pronoun shit. This is all recent crap and I won't bend to it!

1324294611800629248 2020-11-05 18:16:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Advocacy4theDev hahaha I don't know, I have never really been in any group. Just a wanderer I suppose. I had some alt right followers once, I think they all got banned :(
1324293484090695682 2020-11-05 18:12:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Advocacy4theDev LOL I try to stay up to speed with the jargon of the right, that is one I know! hahaha

1324288523403448320 2020-11-05 17:52:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ 😂😂😂😂😂 I watched it at least 10 times or more.
1324288338480824321 2020-11-05 17:51:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rebornhuman2 hmmm....good question. Definitely I am more racially aware. I am also becoming more tribal. The only way Civic Nationalism works is if one ethnic group is the majority and other groups are 10 to 20% of a nations make up. In my opinion.
1324287164193087488 2020-11-05 17:47:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ LMAOOOOO that part of the movie cracks me up! Blood Sport, a classic!
1324286778791075846 2020-11-05 17:45:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rebornhuman2 hahaha I used to like that song. Now knowing what I know and how they treat like some world anthem, I can't stand it!
1324286496690655234 2020-11-05 17:44:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Yes without twitter and Trump happening, I would still be living in my bubble in normie land! hahaha
1324285673432559618 2020-11-05 17:41:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ yeah, I learned quick they don't want actual solutions, LOL
1324285224142938117 2020-11-05 17:39:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JordanBPeterman I was too pretty much. LOL
1324285095172284416 2020-11-05 17:39:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @theSammyBananas Yes, he spotted me on his feed within minutes and blocked me, LMFAO
1324284807782825984 2020-11-05 17:37:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rebornhuman2 Because I genuinely cared I guess. I saw he was divisive and I hadn't been on twitter before politically. This was before finding out what POC really thought about White women. I had never been exposed to their hate before. Looking back now I laugh that I was brainwashed.
1324281786407550977 2020-11-05 17:25:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Just remembering when I came on here in 2016 for primaries &amp; I was normie &amp; nice. I went on that Tarique black guys twitter &amp; said Blacks should get real leaders in their movement to inspire more than rap artists, some other tweets, and he blocked my right away. LMAO good times!
1324263764233998336 2020-11-05 16:14:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RmChrStun Just wait until all the virtue signaling White libs find out they voted for a slave owner, haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

I'm already fired up, so definitely not a good time for a calm collected conversation. Plus they always call us "dumb" or "bitch" etc. &amp; I have ZERO PATIENCE for it today!

1324200676315041794 2020-11-05 12:03:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianHe51818219 You got job loss and displaced in your own nation! Oh and you foot the tax bill that brought him here!
1324200262249123842 2020-11-05 12:01:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why do we have a Vietnamese refugee? Like WTF and he brags in his bio about benefiting from Affirmative Action and displacing American White males. This is a disgrace.
1324199795158884353 2020-11-05 12:00:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> She got 185,442 votes in a BLUE state on a very BRAVE and outspoken platform, missed by 105K votes. Wouldn't call that a failure, LOL. Almost 186K felt the way she does. WE are here to stay! You are a refugee, we don't have to keep you and you are UNGRATEFUL.

1324180197759946754 2020-11-05 10:42:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> China has been busted in Iowa for stealing hybrid corn seeds. Many other cases of China getting busted here in America. Just recently a bunch of spies and Communists at college universities. These are legit cases. Look them up yourself!

1324159398567174145 2020-11-05 09:19:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh great wise one, tell me all the Black women that gave me my right to vote here in America. I will wait......
1324159130777669635 2020-11-05 09:18:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So what are you going to do when the globalists and Anti-White's find your new pocket of safety? They are doing this to every single White European nation, not just America.
1324158710466437121 2020-11-05 09:16:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay then. You leave. But my extended family is here and goes back to the 1600's. I couldn't imagine leaving all them behind. But you do what you feel is good for you. But a majority of us don't have $$$$ to just flee America &amp; start new lives in Europe.
1324157995195027461 2020-11-05 09:14:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So because of one single election where Hispanics voted for GOP, they should grant amnesty to 11 million border hoppers that broke the law and didn't care enough about borders anyhow? I think that is a bad move.
1324156757216735235 2020-11-05 09:09:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PeckPolitics @realDonaldTrump If there is any of us left. We will be forced underground. They are going to punish every single Trump voter. This is not good.
1324153377018810370 2020-11-05 08:55:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FoxNews You are a shitty leftist moderate CNN at this point. So glad I unplugged.
1324152693749911554 2020-11-05 08:52:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BasedWesteros Are you a heritage American? I am going to take a stab and say you aren't.
1324151230680178689 2020-11-05 08:47:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yeah and I saw you suggested the hill to die on is Northern Japan. LMFAO you are going to build an enthno state in Japan. That does me a lot of good dude and my family. Geez thanks! I will most likely die here just like my Ancestors.
1324150708585877504 2020-11-05 08:45:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @IIlllIIIlIlIllI @A_Dixie_Girl Well I don't even know what blocklist or who it even was, it was a very long time ago. LOL
1324150413113937921 2020-11-05 08:43:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> White women fought to even give you the right to vote. Suffragettes were White women. So fuck off.
1324148807010078725 2020-11-05 08:37:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @A_Dixie_Girl I signed up to a block list, so if you are blocked it isn't that I done it personally.
1324146451786682370 2020-11-05 08:28:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianFinch201 Into government and the White House again too.
1324131702533464065 2020-11-05 07:29:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ThomasAhern10 LOL
1324125577889153027 2020-11-05 07:05:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm done with this disagreement between us. There are more important things going on right now, like a fucking election being stolen from those of us that DID vote &amp; support our president. Have a good day!
1324125262523600897 2020-11-05 07:03:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We agree to disagree. I believe in using every pathway, person, and outlet, and MANY strategies, versus...just Trump complaining tweets helping the MSM and enemy who already beat up on him like fucking punching bag. You don't even have ANYONE to replace him! You come empty handed
1324123646504304640 2020-11-05 06:57:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay....where is your people? Where are you organizing this? The only thing I have seen is NJP and that hasn't even gotten off the ground yet. You get something solid and going, then you come recruit me. Otherwise this is just all talk and no walk.
1324122973058588680 2020-11-05 06:54:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm not asking you to be sorry for anything. I'm asking you not to hate on me for supporting him in additionally to supporting other Heritage American start ups, tweets, and pro white policy ideas, etc..
1324121978966593536 2020-11-05 06:50:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Punishing Trump in my opinion is like punishing all the White people that did vote for him. I'm not going to divide like that. If you all want to go around hating Trump supporters then do your thing. I don't want any part of that. I think it's retarded. I voted&amp;I don't regret it.
1324121034363199497 2020-11-05 06:47:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You don't like Trump. Okay. Well I on the other hand believe he is a stepping stone. I don't like everything he does. I'm not a cult member. But I won't let blackpills blind me to not see what he has done, even if small, helps. Just how I feel and I am not sorry for that.
1324120416055689216 2020-11-05 06:44:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Also please tell me what you are doing, besides complaining what Trump did or didn't do? You didn't vote for him, then fine. But why go around and complain to those of us that are using him to our advantage and trying to fucking do something positive? I don't get it?
1324119488451747842 2020-11-05 06:41:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Cutting refugees cuts the enemies like HIAS that use taxpayer $$$ to dispossess natives. You haven't even covered the benefit of putting those fucks out of work. What is the scale of that? Big, in my opinion!
1324119025291612162 2020-11-05 06:39:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> He didn't increase H1B. He made it harder forcing Big Tech pay their foreign slave labor higher wages. They currently suing Trump Administration right now. Why would they SUE him if he helped them? Doesn't make sense. As far as jobs, that's less welfare you have to pay for, LOL
1324118264725884930 2020-11-05 06:36:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LjungBergkamp @AvianSoul1 Like I said, we agree to disagree.
1324118011389902855 2020-11-05 06:35:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LjungBergkamp @AvianSoul1 I don't want your blackpills today. If you think your odds are better with Biden /Harris in office when it comes to WAR, then I really don't know what to tell you. My job is to protect MY FAMILY and who would serve that best in office when WAR happens. I feel that is TRUMP.
1324117438749909003 2020-11-05 06:32:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ Yes, hahaah lets have an additional flowing of foreigners across our border and more refugees and warm enemy bodies that we would have to war against!
1324116374147530752 2020-11-05 06:28:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SFWfe1 AGREE. I guess Richard Grenell or whatever has already started suggesting breaking and moving DC.
1324115913768079362 2020-11-05 06:26:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SFWfe1 If they broke up DC and de-centralized it by moving some of it to middle America, this would happen MUCH MORE and on a LARGER scale! It's why DC must be broken up!
1324115515346923520 2020-11-05 06:25:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Many Governors resisted National Guard support. You forget that an American President is supposed to work for everyone in our Nation. That said what he did for Whites: Decreased Refugee's, Cut immigration, Supported ICE, Welfare cut for illegals, No brother wars, Halt CRT.
1324114387960008704 2020-11-05 06:20:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Seeing European Americans protesting, even if on a small scale, makes my heart race and gives me hope!
1324112184293707776 2020-11-05 06:12:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LjungBergkamp @AvianSoul1 You act like there isn't decades of opposition built up in our Government and one man can do everything on his own without being a King or Dictator. Which would have alienated a lot more people than doing what he had to do in order to win. We agree to disagree.
1324111373643714560 2020-11-05 06:08:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LitWhen A modern William Wallace, LOL
1324111267502706695 2020-11-05 06:08:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Bingx34 It's out of stock!
1324110658556801026 2020-11-05 06:05:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LjungBergkamp @AvianSoul1 Yes, this is all Drumf's fault. Give me a fucking break.
1324106008784982016 2020-11-05 05:47:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This my man is my animal spirit! GOD bless him!!!!! Let's goooooo!!!!
1324105152035434497 2020-11-05 05:44:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZBeeblebrox42nc @dmartosko GAWD....we have so much to expose and so much work to do. It's so overwhelming. They are all FRAUDS!!!!
1324103516756082690 2020-11-05 05:37:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @dmartosko I hope they investigate AOC's twitter as well. I think she has foreigner followers to inflate her popularity on here.
1324102876763983879 2020-11-05 05:35:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @dmartosko Disgusting and pathetic! Everything they do is built upon lies and is FAKE!
1324099467952402440 2020-11-05 05:21:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Deadpool_Maxe @celticviking14 Yes, it will be that, but much worse! Every historical structure, statue, all paper documents such as The Constitution, all of it will be GONE and so will the people who built America in the first place.
1324092570889236488 2020-11-05 04:54:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 Yes, I see your point.
1324091508870516740 2020-11-05 04:49:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 I don't know anyone can claim to be a Heritage American ally or White European ally if you voted to put my family in harms way and path. You want me dead just like the enemy. That is how I see this and I consider it betrayal. That is how I feel right now.
1324090681506336773 2020-11-05 04:46:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 I get that voting doesn't change much. But sorry YES it does matter who the fuck is in the Whitehouse when collapse happens! That person needs to be Trump.
1324090227502260224 2020-11-05 04:44:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 I understand all that. But if you voted for dystopia, you voted for my family's death sentence. You are on the side of "going to rape your children, starve to death, and they think it's funny" globalist crowd. This isn't the movies, this has real consequences.
1324083362890395652 2020-11-05 04:17:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ EXACTLY it's much easier to fight a war with current Demographics then what Biden / Harris is planning to do to us. A vote for them is a vote for death against me and my family. I see it no other way!
1324082204876673025 2020-11-05 04:12:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If you voted for Biden who is going to grant amnesty to 30 million illegals &amp; pour in 100K in refugees the next 4 years who will overwhelm us &amp; cause death to my family, you aren't funny! I find no humor in putting Kamala in the Whitehouse. You are not an ally.
1324064619279851521 2020-11-05 03:02:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What is happening?
1323919325191983105 2020-11-04 17:25:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Kathy Griffin still trying to be relevant and is a total complete failure and PATHETIC and violent! Bankruptcy and shunned from society is the only path for that creature!
1323916660961648641 2020-11-04 17:15:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @frog_armored 😂😂😂😂😂That sounds like a great wall my friend. I endorse your wall, LOL
1323915600855445504 2020-11-04 17:10:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rebornhuman2 I know! Everything is upside down!
1323915454419767297 2020-11-04 17:10:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Stay off America's lawn!
1323913274291834881 2020-11-04 17:01:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It's mind boggling how you expect heritage Americans who descend from those that built the Government that you try to subvert every single day to just give up their rights and nation. You are a PARASITE.
1323911731610005504 2020-11-04 16:55:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CassandraRules Great...stabbings in our Capital now. Enriching.

1323900021943816193 2020-11-04 16:08:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @IIlllIIIlIlIllI Don't tease me like that, LOL hahahaha
1323899004011294720 2020-11-04 16:04:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are a piece of crap.
1323888477562437634 2020-11-04 15:23:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ Yep. She has the imported demographics she needs. Only way to reverse is to make a law that Refugees can't run for office in our Nation.
1323882787368259587 2020-11-04 15:00:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> One of biggest disappointments for me tonight is my Northern neighbor Minnesota. It's really sad. I don't blame all the Red Patriots, they can't help that a radical along with her imported voters have conquered areas. Those areas will remain cesspools unless they deport.
1323881701966290949 2020-11-04 14:56:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SelimSeesYou It was the sign and Trump flag I put in my yard. LOL   just kidding, LOL  but for real, did put it out by the highway, LMAO
1323880358006444033 2020-11-04 14:50:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @sassy_ia It's the cesspool's!  https://t.co/jp3WYZi2xt
1323877481783398400 2020-11-04 14:39:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @sassy_ia WE need a LAW that a refugee NOT born in America cannot be in office!

1323826470029086721 2020-11-04 11:16:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FBawroski Hopefully it's early voting counts.

1323824893868343297 2020-11-04 11:10:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> CNN mention Maricopa county......said demographics and suburban voters rejecting Trump.

1323799563912830976 2020-11-04 09:29:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ForLapua That is not called! That is the early vote count.
1323799281040527360 2020-11-04 09:28:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> CNN just mentioned an area in Texas that they said have a lot of new DIVERSE voters and said Diversity isn't a Trump vote.

1323795318442463234 2020-11-04 09:12:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Every time CNN mentions the inner cities results, they say African American democrat vote. They understand that demographics matter.
1323793802864242690 2020-11-04 09:06:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Leftists love to talk about popular vote so I would like to note I am pretty impressed with Trump hanging in there and doing good on popular vote so far.
1323792888170483712 2020-11-04 09:03:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Those North East White states, Vermont, etc...imagine being White and voting Biden. Are they retarded? They are majority White and Biden wants to make them a minority in their own nation. Wow.

1322689283170488322 2020-11-01 07:57:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CormacBrock LOL just some guy over in India that thinks he is madly in love with me and uses social media to stalk me.
1322687929358163972 2020-11-01 07:52:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ 😂👍
1322685685233582081 2020-11-01 07:43:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy Yes, you nailed it. I am a romantic :)
1322684497251438592 2020-11-01 07:38:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy hahahah I would probably trade it all for love though :) But thank you!!!!
1322684334332088322 2020-11-01 07:38:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ No, trust me you don't. He used to message my Dad and my friends begging them to ask me to unblock him and to talk to him. He has done some messed up stuff.
1322682484514017281 2020-11-01 07:30:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy Nope. Just classic and plain :)
1322682328922099713 2020-11-01 07:30:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ Yes, he is madly in love with me. Even creates fake dating site profiles and uses White men pictures into trying to trick me into talking to him. He has been doing this for 3 years now! Stalks my facebook, my band stuff I did too!
1322681105326215169 2020-11-01 07:25:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy No, it's like a craftsman / bungalow style I think?
1322680904607825920 2020-11-01 07:24:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FBawroski OMG.  well I have no one on speed dial. LOL
1322680781253316610 2020-11-01 07:24:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> He is from India and I think he might be crazy. 😂😂
1322680410065817602 2020-11-01 07:22:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy No, I have a house and corner lot in a small rural town. I wish I had land :)
1322679906090835969 2020-11-01 07:20:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FBawroski I don't know man.....I think a relationship should come before the sex part. LOL
1322679645532266502 2020-11-01 07:19:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ LOL nope that is one that hasn't happened to me, LOL
1322679430712578050 2020-11-01 07:18:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FBawroski LMAOOOO 😂😂😂😂😂
1322679304526925825 2020-11-01 07:18:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy LOL I am not going to sell my house and move to Utah in false hopes to hunt for men. LOL You are funny! :)
1322679092458803202 2020-11-01 07:17:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ That's an understatement hahahahaha :)
1322678987768909825 2020-11-01 07:16:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh one more thing while I am in my revealing state of personal issues. I have had a foreign stalker for 3 years now. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂No, I don't want to talk about it, LOL.
1322678503981096960 2020-11-01 07:15:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @EdwardCIB She has a son.
1322678164334718978 2020-11-01 07:13:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Abnormal things seem to always happen to me. Most things that happen to me don't happen to a lot of people. I'm always like this 5%. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂#LifeisStrangeSometimes
1322677642408185861 2020-11-01 07:11:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy Yes I am, haaaaaaaaaaaaa I just turned 45 this summer. I mean I could definitely get away with a 38 year old man. But anything younger would be selfish of me especially if they wanted to have a bunch of kids. That just wouldn't be right. Unless he has a bunch of them already.
1322677044988252160 2020-11-01 07:09:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bluedogred33 Thank you!!!!
1322676805237673984 2020-11-01 07:08:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy Are you saying I should move to Utah and become a "cougar"? hahahahaha LOL
1322676549267673099 2020-11-01 07:07:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @paultykwinski1 Yes that stuff is great! I just mean me tweeting about my ex boyfriend. LOL
1322675723669327872 2020-11-01 07:04:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy LOL I would rather find a gentleman and a better man and settle down :)
1322674816562900994 2020-11-01 07:00:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @paultykwinski1 hahaha I just don't want to talk about to much personal life to a bunch of strangers online. It's not classy to air dirty laundry! I try to be classy :)
1322674236381667328 2020-11-01 06:58:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy Maybe I will someday, LOL
1322673086123151362 2020-11-01 06:53:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay, now back to our normal political programming! No more personal life talk. Thanks for listening! #MovingOn
1322672473188552707 2020-11-01 06:51:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ hahaha we do, we live in rural small towns, LOL She was very convenient for him!
1322671876188049409 2020-11-01 06:48:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee Never end the lengths you go to search for love. It's quite romantic if you ask me! The right woman will find it attractive and adorable. Never give up. :)
1322671650169643015 2020-11-01 06:47:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee He hated women because the two girlfriends he had before me had cheated on him. So he was very angry at women. But he fell in love with me and trusted me. I helped him to heal. But he never changed his idea of marriage. Perhaps he will now. He is 34 now. It's time.
1322670344352763904 2020-11-01 06:42:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee I understand....but please understand that I spent 7 years living with him, it was like we were married just not official. I realize I will need to come to terms to be happy for them. I will get there eventually.
1322669988164108299 2020-11-01 06:41:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy I thought that maybe he had some vengeance in his heart when he purchased a home with 10 acres only 10 minutes from my house. He would stop by after we broke up because we parted as friends. I think he would have done things differently, but he said I was "gone".
1322669608336302082 2020-11-01 06:39:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Eman_Resu2020 Yes, maybe GOD saves the best for last? I hope I will have a much better future for sure :)
1322669383370637318 2020-11-01 06:38:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CorintheansXIII Yes, I will thank you!!!
1322669243373096964 2020-11-01 06:38:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy hahaha well I had to heal from it all. It's been 3 years since we broken up. But him and her are recent. I am ready for someone new :) He went with rebounds and such. Already had a year relationship with another girl and broke her heart, LOL Now onto my cousin!
1322668918696271872 2020-11-01 06:36:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Eman_Resu2020 Yes Sir, I agree completely!
1322668795849265152 2020-11-01 06:36:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee Yes, you are ready! Good luck in finding her :)
1322668619344601088 2020-11-01 06:35:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee I married young at age 23. So I had experienced marriage already. He had not and hated women, didn't have any intention of ever marrying one.
1322668328759054352 2020-11-01 06:34:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee It's not all his fault. I had been heart broken and given up on the idea of marriage as well when we met. We both did not want marriage &amp; were fine living together. It was I who fell in love with the idea of marriage again. But that is not the only issues we had. A lot happened.
1322667980518547456 2020-11-01 06:33:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee Well I must be honest. There was a huge age gap between us but we loved each other regardless. When we began I was 36 and he was 25. If I hadn't started pressing marriage, he would have been fine living with me longer than 7 years. He thinks marriage is an institution.
1322667385027993603 2020-11-01 06:30:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy Yes, I suppose when some people are that lonely, they will sacrifice anything to satisfy their needs. They obviously are perfect for each other and have no guilt. Things will never be the same among us though. There is no going back after this.
1322665979193761792 2020-11-01 06:25:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Since she is family I will have to attend their wedding, LMAO I mean it's just all so ridiculous!
1322664755379818496 2020-11-01 06:20:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JellyBe77861003 Agree!
1322664323664302080 2020-11-01 06:18:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GobanPuppy Yes I know. It's testing me my friend. A huge test!
1322663633470500864 2020-11-01 06:15:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @D71392911 Thanks friend!
1322658672544305152 2020-11-01 05:56:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MarkDre63207272 Yes, I agree. It's crazy! Like a soap opera!
1322658509981364227 2020-11-01 05:55:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KulakAmerican72 Well I haven't found one yet. LOL I suppose that this situation with them makes it more frustrating for me too. He has someone and I do not. Makes it very hard.
1322658297481146371 2020-11-01 05:54:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @laugh_having LMAO I would NEVER be with a man like that, that is crazy talk, hahahahaha
1322658179801600001 2020-11-01 05:54:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It just sucks that I didn't get a "clean" break. Normally you break up with someone and you never have to deal with or see them again. This is NOT a normal situation. If we had kids, yes. But we don't. Seeing him at every family function is out of the norm.
1322657815979298819 2020-11-01 05:52:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cyclist66 Actually that is VERY good advice. Thank you friend!!!!
1322657676409638912 2020-11-01 05:52:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> One more thing....if he puts a ring on her finger in the future, it's going to kill me. Because I could NOT get him to do it for me and I gave him 7 years of my life that I will not get back. That is all. Just had to get that off my chest. It's bad enough they moved in together.
1322656727125413891 2020-11-01 05:48:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I will return to family functions when I am ready and know that I can control my temper. Today is not that day.
1322656473684561925 2020-11-01 05:47:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rdr70024 @ReDanjojo You would think so and do it on my behalf. I didn't do anything wrong here. But this has shown me that they are VERY selfish and driven by their own needs. I would NEVER have done this to either of them.
1322656173682761735 2020-11-01 05:46:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't know, but yes eventually I am going to have to be the better person. I cannot allow him to drive a wedge between me and my family. Family is all I have &amp; I can't let him take that away from me. I am strong, I will over come this with dignity and grace.
1322655729027874821 2020-11-01 05:44:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cyclist66 He didn't even have the balls to come tell me himself after everything him and I had been through together. My cousin only called to tell me because my Aunt FORCED her and said it was the right thing to do!
1322655448764469248 2020-11-01 05:43:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cyclist66 No, him and I split up because we were fighting over the topic of "marriage" and other things in our relationship. We parted as friends &amp; he would still stop by to check up on me. Then he slept with my cousin &amp; they moved in together. He did not cheat on me, but it feels that way
1322654481440370689 2020-11-01 05:39:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @D71392911 When I tried to talk to him about it, he is just like "why do you care?" LOL they act like it's no big deal what they are doing. So I guess I just have to get passed it eventually.
1322653326085890048 2020-11-01 05:35:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jack_venator LMAO
1322653212227358721 2020-11-01 05:34:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @D71392911 Yeah I have thought about that. But do I want to allow this man to drive a wedge between me and my family? I will return to family functions when I am strong enough and ready &amp; to control my temper. Last time was not a good example, him and I got into an argument.
1322652552253636608 2020-11-01 05:31:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CagneyPowers 😂You are awesome! Thanks for making me smile!!! I needed it!!!!😊
1322651392906067971 2020-11-01 05:27:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KulakAmerican72 Well I have not spoken to her in an entire year.
1322651026378444800 2020-11-01 05:25:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @native_texian Yeah cuz we parted ways as friends. But sorry a friend doesn't do that. There are a million other women out there he could have been with instead!
1322650752754601984 2020-11-01 05:24:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cyclist66 Well he is VERY charming! She is under his spell.
1322650611335221248 2020-11-01 05:24:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @D71392911 She asked me after they had slept together and been seeing each other "secretly" for 2 weeks. It wouldn't have mattered if I said they couldn't do it. They are grown adults. They had done it and were going to do it anyway. She ONLY told me because my Aunt forced her too!
1322649343531376640 2020-11-01 05:19:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vigilant_cowboy LOL
1322649173267795971 2020-11-01 05:18:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @paultykwinski1 LOL that happened last time. He tried to speak to me at my Aunt's birthday party and I blew up! I'm not going anymore until I can handle seeing them together among my family.
1322648907193716742 2020-11-01 05:17:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ They said they didn't plan for it to happen....it's just happened they say! LOL
1322648778676097026 2020-11-01 05:16:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't normally tweet about personal life misery, but today I am skipping our Family Halloween celebration because I don't want to deal with seeing him and her together. He has ruined every family function for me. It's really sad.
1322648309975207936 2020-11-01 05:15:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ReDanjojo Well I am told that I have to be the "better" person in this situation and tolerate it.
1322648188545830917 2020-11-01 05:14:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vigilant_cowboy I know. But my family says I need to be the "bigger" person and just ignore it. LOL They say I am the oldest niece and it's my cross to bare to not let it ruin the family holidays.
1322647690338017281 2020-11-01 05:12:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CormacBrock Yes, I have been dealing with it for an entire year now. Not fun!
1322647442412679170 2020-11-01 05:11:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @_KingsParty_ Yeah, it's really messed up.
1322647057602142209 2020-11-01 05:10:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Imagine having to see your ex boyfriend who you lived with for 7 years, have no children with, but get to see at every Family function and get together because they hooked up with your cousin. #MyLife #RuinedHolidays

1322001668796567553 2020-10-30 10:25:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Reminder about our Elite Media. They took the fraud / fabricated "Trump invited by Putin had prostitutes piss on him" dossier and ran with that as Russian collusion for years. Helping Pelosi &amp; J elites tie up Trump with impeachment. They brainwashed Americans. #EnemyofThePeople

1321991730699390978 2020-10-30 09:46:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Fewer foreign workers means more job opportunities for Americans. It's time to #ReinvestinUS and remind all employers that #RecruitmentBeginsAtHome! #HireAmerican #ReduceForeignLabor

1321974480214917120 2020-10-30 08:37:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Mass immigration has become a "weapon" used by our enemies. It's time to invest in Americans &amp; take a long pause on immigration. When it is being used to destroy our nation, it is no longer organic and healthy immigration.
1321973816424308737 2020-10-30 08:34:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ShawnaGoFree Amen that you do my friend, AMEN!

1321972683442106368 2020-10-30 08:30:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> "Revenge" mass immigration into Western Civilized European nations is real. It is not a conspiracy theory. These people want you dead.

1321931613421342720 2020-10-30 05:47:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @dufrianord Do not fear! I have been linked to Viking ancient DNA samples and I have brown eyes and brown hair. Although it was dirty blonde when I was a kid. They will NOT take Viking heritage from us with their dirty tricks!

1321709337832808448 2020-10-29 15:03:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @candylotus @SPimpernel13 @whois_John_Galt @i_aver Yes, that is why some parents grouped together and contacted the DOJ about CRT and requested an investigation! They can do this now!
1321708790887129088 2020-10-29 15:01:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @i_aver @whois_John_Galt @candylotus :) sounds good friend!

1321707183084572672 2020-10-29 14:55:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee @i_aver @candylotus Yes, have to start saving things. They keep rewriting things and shifting blame. It's really frightening.

1321702183574900736 2020-10-29 14:35:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @i_aver @candylotus But yes, I agree they have a direct line to the President's office through Jared.
1321702028326932482 2020-10-29 14:34:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @i_aver @candylotus True, but OJ's have their own education schools / methods and they don't receive any CRT training.
1321699644586496002 2020-10-29 14:25:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @i_aver @candylotus Well I didn't see any Orthodox J's penning the President to end CRT. I honestly believe Trump ended it because it's wrong and goes against the civil rights of White's. Just my two cents friends.
1321698514343206912 2020-10-29 14:20:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee @i_aver @candylotus No way! I don't believe it😂😂😂😂😂😂What a surprise!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1321698096905072640 2020-10-29 14:19:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @i_aver @candylotus The J's created it for sure. But Trump didn't end CRT for the J's. That is absurd.

1321687693701619712 2020-10-29 13:37:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman YES, agree!!!! Well said.
1321687388993867776 2020-10-29 13:36:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 okay, will keep that in mind friend! Have a GREAT night :)
1321687031270035456 2020-10-29 13:35:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CaveDwellin I have thought this as well! That the GOP is becoming the Democrat Party. It is us Nationalists and America First, MAGA's that are becoming the Republican party. It's really strange...but I swear it feels like it is happening this way.
1321686510568177665 2020-10-29 13:33:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 He was a MGTOW guy...and when I changed my mind about marriage again....we butted heads. He still viewed it as in institution. We agreed to disagree and went our separate ways. That is all I will say. Thank you for your concern though lass :)
1321685165220024320 2020-10-29 13:27:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 Sir, I was in a 7 year relationship that ended in 2017. I have only been single 3 years. I'm a romantic and very loving.
1321684334001197057 2020-10-29 13:24:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ValorisTrajan I understand! No problem. I get it, I really do. I am just looking at many paths is all. I feel I can support lots of groups as long as we all have some sort of common bond or goal.
1321683828629512192 2020-10-29 13:22:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 Yes, LOL I am hahahahaha
1321683734127648768 2020-10-29 13:22:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 I know what I want...and it's just going to take time to find it is all. I thought it would be faster, I've been single for 3 years. Not a great selection, pool of men my age and I live in a small rural town. Many things against me, LOL

1321682851725774849 2020-10-29 13:18:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 No, I am not young. I turned 45 this summer. I worry all the time about meeting someone and that my life is just wasting away.
1321682524481966080 2020-10-29 13:17:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 Well I had a crazy foreign stalker, was experiencing frustration with trying to meet decent men and date, and just got burnt out. I will go back and very soon!!!!! Probably after the election is what I am thinking.
1321682013926154242 2020-10-29 13:15:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ValorisTrajan Yes, I see it. But I think it's still important to have a fringe on the GOP to help push some things mainstream. Just my thoughts though.
1321681550128386048 2020-10-29 13:13:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ gosh, thank you again.
1321681302479949824 2020-10-29 13:12:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @candylotus YES my friend. You get this :)
1321681172754214912 2020-10-29 13:12:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ValorisTrajan Always have a Plan A, Plan B and even a Plan C and Plan D!
1321681053514452993 2020-10-29 13:11:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ValorisTrajan This ensures that if the hijacking of the GOP is not successful, well we have this other party over here that is built up. We should encourage BOTH of these paths in my opinion. But hey..what the heck do I know? LOL
1321680455742164995 2020-10-29 13:09:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ YOU are so sweet!!!!!! Thank you my friend.
1321680296706777088 2020-10-29 13:08:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ValorisTrajan I am actually for both ways. I am for hijacking the GOP and supporting something outside of the GOP. This is what I mean about having all types of alternative pathways in fighting this mess. Not putting all eggs in one basket. We need MANY strategies!
1321679812767920128 2020-10-29 13:06:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 Well I did take this year off from dating, LOL so I sort of do it to myself. ahahaha

1321677780229251072 2020-10-29 12:58:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Hunter79Matt Why though? He won't beat Trump? Seems like a waste of time.
1321677068493611008 2020-10-29 12:55:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KulakAmerican72 @LDF120 I understand. I liked that he cut the refugee's down to 15K. Ended the critical race in federal tax paying departments. Some other things he did I liked, etc.. enough for me to give him 4 more years. Instead of letting Kamel Toe waltz into the Whitehouse.
1321676417072091137 2020-10-29 12:53:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay, fine. You can leave my twitter feed anytime now. I'm a sellout according to the rules in your head. Good bye!  https://t.co/6bybV3NJeI
1321675844868280327 2020-10-29 12:50:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I disagree.....the GOP is only alive because of Trump. He has a built in fan base that will continue to fight while he is in office. But hey it's okay for us to agree to disagree on this one. No harm done.
1321674056777740288 2020-10-29 12:43:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I think we already determined the enemies. It's all of DC and donors, Elites, Media, J-left etc...so I don't know what you mean?
1321673768490700800 2020-10-29 12:42:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @native_texian @western_bestern Cuz a follower of mine called her Kamel Toe and I loved it so I sort of stole that from them, must admit where credit is due! I didn't come up with it.

I couldn't allow Ernst to be replaced by a fraud who wasn't even born in Iowa. Greenfield has NO business running! So I did what I had too :(

1321608083072843778 2020-10-29 08:21:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RiderVet @realDonaldTrump I don't feel that way. He reduced Refugee Resettlement down to 15K. ISIS is gone. He ended Critical Race teaching in Federal tax paying departments. I like his stance on China. Yes, he could have done more, understand he was uprooting a system that's been in place for decades.
1321607027634962432 2020-10-29 08:17:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RealDrRusty I kept my word :) I said I would give him 8 years back in 2016. Well I did my duty and I stayed loyal. My work is complete :)

1321603707117723656 2020-10-29 08:04:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianDotWalker Thank you Sir!
1321603217436876804 2020-10-29 08:02:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Either I see them embrace Nationalists / America First candidates or I'm gone! GOP doesn't deserve my vote and has done NOTHING to earn it. They don't even speak for me as a poor White in my own nation!
1321602817694511110 2020-10-29 08:00:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> P.S. I plugged my nose and voted Joni Ernst today as well. I couldn't bear allowing ACT BLUE who is pouring millions into Progressive Left candidates like Theresa Greenfield (who wasn't even born in Iowa) to wreck my state. But looking forward the GOP doesn't care about White's.
1321601661752741893 2020-10-29 07:56:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ValorisTrajan Yes I have noticed and I am tired of the bullshit.
1321601318528667650 2020-10-29 07:54:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I voted for Trump today, because I kept my word from 2016 when I said I would vote for him twice. He is now playing Identity politics by coming out with Platinum plans for Latinos &amp; Blacks. My question is as a loyal White American voter...what is there for my people? Don't @ me!
1321600028155273217 2020-10-29 07:49:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RealDrRusty Yeah I do...out of my White inherited courtesy ;)
1321599543235018753 2020-10-29 07:47:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Where in the hell is the Platinum Plan for Heritage White European Americans? You know....the one's that have been the majority of tax slaves since the beginning of the federal income tax? No politician will even utter the word "White" in our own freaking country! WTH!!!
1321598319764885509 2020-10-29 07:42:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Wait....are you saying diversity of Muslims and Africans in London didn't build this magnificent castle, but Medieval Europeans did?
1321597672755777536 2020-10-29 07:40:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Exactly....they are just spinning wheels and will NEVER make a move. Are we going to need to start scheduling massive protest marches on Big Tech CEO's homes and business? You know...like what the left does whenever they want something done.
1321596572577206278 2020-10-29 07:35:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NGPhDBio @HumzaYousaf They got to go back.
1321592813604245507 2020-10-29 07:20:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> *were   dang it!!!
1321592705881964544 2020-10-29 07:20:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The other two who weren't wearing the masks where men. I was the only female non-masker.
1321592503569682432 2020-10-29 07:19:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AzVisigoth I am glad you found something. We need a European American magazine for Women. The POC get Latino magazines and Black magazines. Where is ours?
1321591059995074560 2020-10-29 07:13:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AzVisigoth I can't look or read any of them. I get "specialty" magazines now if I buy one.
1321590759179587585 2020-10-29 07:12:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Note: I did have it with me and set it on the counter. Carried it on my wrist and did my business. I was one of three that weren't wearing one.
1321589635584315392 2020-10-29 07:08:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @oggupito I'm going to have to visit Scotland, one of my ancestrial homelands before it is Africanized or Middle Easternized. So fucking sad!!!!! :(
1321589377965936640 2020-10-29 07:07:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @oggupito Good grief. How are we going to unite as Europeans on a whole front against what is happening in European nations? This makes me very sad!
1321588778209890307 2020-10-29 07:04:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AzVisigoth Yep...I agree completely. I only receive some of these magazines if they are free. I won't pay for the idiocy!
1321585952867946496 2020-10-29 06:53:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I didn't wear my mask to Vote today, LOL nobody said a word to me nor asked me to put it on. #Rebel
1321585348540047361 2020-10-29 06:51:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Teen Vogue is officially for Blacks only now. Do not subscribe your White European daughters to this trash!
1321584286420578310 2020-10-29 06:47:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FrankieFlames YEP....EXACTLY!!!!! I have seen enough evidence.
1321582637841108993 2020-10-29 06:40:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FrenRight Agree....they are still brainwashed and don't understand that the majority of POC absolutely despise &amp; HATE White people. It took me a good year to two years to see it and realize it. You might have a nice Black friend or nice Muslim Arab in your circle, well they our outliers!
1321578510855643139 2020-10-29 06:24:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't think you should be in ANY free Western Nation, especially Scotland. Your tyrant way of thinking does not match Western Civilization. Are you or your ancestors even Scottish? What the hell is wrong with you?
1321576747612123138 2020-10-29 06:17:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NYTDaniel Is that guy even Scottish? WTF.
1321573639758749699 2020-10-29 06:04:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> 1940's are over dude....I suggest you get some therapy. P.S. stop slandering Americans who are German heritage. Your holo didn't happen here &amp; we are tired of you blaming German Americans.
1321572491723264005 2020-10-29 06:00:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BillyBubbadixie Agree! The mildest sentence would be exiled from our nation.
1321570812609073159 2020-10-29 05:53:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yes come out of the shadows you weak feminine turncoat turds! Let us see you and know your names! #PussyBoy
1321570363218763777 2020-10-29 05:51:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are a turncoat TRAITOR! You should be shunned from society!
1321567794291482624 2020-10-29 05:41:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @naturesfinestz We share a dream my friend!
1321567318984564744 2020-10-29 05:39:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Now that I have voted Trump for four more years, I have stayed true to the vow I made 4 years ago that I would vote to give him 8 years. I stayed loyal to my word. Now I am free &amp; I can look for Nationalists to support!
1321562058425540612 2020-10-29 05:18:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So Miles Taylor is a traitor and turncoat against Americans who voted Trump. Okay got it. What an embarrassing excuse of a White man. Shame on him.

1321558066349965312 2020-10-29 05:02:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BillyBubbadixie Joni Ernst was up for election this time.
1321554571718807553 2020-10-29 04:48:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Just got home from in person voting at my county Auditor's office and voted Donald Trump for President. I have done my duty as an American and voted against the Color Revolution.

1321301570231914499 2020-10-28 12:03:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Max5p56 Yes, I already know that :) I still believe in love though. I still have a romantic inside me dying to get out. No worries my friend, I am very much aware of reality and how expectations don't always meet that.
1321295527615565837 2020-10-28 11:39:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SnowDuchess1 a huge F :( 😢😭

1321281830369243142 2020-10-28 10:45:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't understand MAGA's that want to protect and restore Christianity in America and at the same time say they will vote for Ivanka (who denied Jesus Christ to become Jewish for Jared) as their female choice for President. Don't @ me, I am just FYI'ing here!

1320983265172488192 2020-10-27 14:58:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Pinandpuller Here you go! Rebecca is a 2020 British romantic thriller film directed by Ben Wheatley from a screenplay by Jane Goldman, Joe Shrapnel, and Anna Waterhouse. The film is based on the 1938 novel of the same name by Daphne du Maurier
1320982980542767105 2020-10-27 14:57:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Pinandpuller I don't know, I didn't watch the credits, LOL Sorry!
1320982237488336897 2020-10-27 14:54:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Pinandpuller Yes. Not everyone will enjoy it though! I love scenery, wardrobe, old homes in films...so this was right up my alley :)
1320981474108182528 2020-10-27 14:51:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Western_Annie Well it was already 2 hours long. I would have watched 3 hours of it though if that was the case :)
1320979989907574784 2020-10-27 14:45:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Western_Annie I'm sorry. I am a weirdo film person though, so I don't usually expect others to like what I enjoy, LOL
1320967351341355009 2020-10-27 13:55:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Nostalgia is really great sometimes!
1320966157143285760 2020-10-27 13:50:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KathyMschotschi Lily was stunning! Very classy.
1320965666619490304 2020-10-27 13:48:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KathyMschotschi They all actually nailed their roles in the film, in my opinion.
1320965300691623937 2020-10-27 13:47:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KathyMschotschi Oh I know, that lady played that role to perfection. GREAT ACTRESS.
1320965100044509186 2020-10-27 13:46:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @oggupito Yes, she was stunning in the film and her style was perfection!
1320964792929181696 2020-10-27 13:45:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KathyMschotschi I would watch it again for sure!

1320964394717745152 2020-10-27 13:43:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KathyMschotschi Nice, I loved it too!!!! So glad to hear other's liked it.

1320962913205669888 2020-10-27 13:37:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I watched the movie "Rebecca" year 2020 last night for free. I really loved the leading actress wardrobe throughout the film. Absolutely LOVED the old mansion in the film. The husband was very handsome to look at too!
1320959697923592193 2020-10-27 13:25:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BigRiverSalmon It is one of my favorite clips. The hypocrisy he caught that guy in was AMAZING.

1320946433818767360 2020-10-27 12:32:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KyGrifter Yeah an entire NATION had to change it's culture in Congress to accommodate a Refugee that wasn't even born on American soil. Pretty crazy huh?
1320942294594428928 2020-10-27 12:15:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nitsch_robert @Magnus___14 In my opinion they are all a National Security threat. We just aren't allowed to deal with it like it should be dealt with.
1320941847997485060 2020-10-27 12:14:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nitsch_robert @Magnus___14 In a UNITED and healthy nation that funding would have been shut off and radicals dealt with.

We may have to sacrifice a few of those cities, let them fall to ruin. Then establish order again in those areas. Heck I'm just spitballing, LOL Need Law and Order.
1320940832581656577 2020-10-27 12:10:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nitsch_robert @Magnus___14 Yes, that is why I said I worry in a national divorce that foreign troops would be put on our soil through the liberal areas. They would even use the U.N. who is just itching to throw Trump out.
1320937616473206785 2020-10-27 11:57:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Based_Seltzer @JoeRudyard Yeah, I was shocked when I found out how so many of them hate America and White people. I didn't think foreigners that had come here were like that. They imported way too many that are here for all the wrong reasons too, just to pillage jobs and no actual LOVE of the nation.

1320927025859801088 2020-10-27 11:15:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JNewcomer5 @CagneyPowers @WokeCultWM EXCELLENT news! Please do!!!!! No one is coming to save us, all we have is each other.
1320925829199781888 2020-10-27 11:10:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts @CagneyPowers @WokeCultWM That is why we can't kick the can down the road. WE have to take action NOW.
1320924635102351360 2020-10-27 11:05:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Earlier when I was speaking that we need strong Nationalist Men to do the jobs weak GOP broke back men in America won't do....such as removing this domestic threat from our Government and prosecuting her.
1320922481125969925 2020-10-27 10:57:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If anyone in Congress thinks we are a racist nation, then they should forfeit their taxpayer paycheck and resign. They obviously hate America, didn't even take their oath seriously &amp; want to restructure our country. We DESERVE BETTER than this! We didn't do anything wrong!
1320920604804059138 2020-10-27 10:49:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CagneyPowers @WokeCultWM LOL hahahaha
1320920084680945665 2020-10-27 10:47:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CagneyPowers @WokeCultWM I hope we are getting married soon!
1320919517892104194 2020-10-27 10:45:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CagneyPowers @WokeCultWM The GOP is compromised and owned. We need NEW Nationalist Men that can stomach what needs to be done to save this Republic. Just my opinion. No more coddling and baby talk &amp; not taking the radical left threats seriously.
1320918928089063424 2020-10-27 10:43:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PonderAndAct @Magnus___14 Damn straight they would. You got that right.
1320918586932813824 2020-10-27 10:41:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CagneyPowers @WokeCultWM YES. It's time to get TOUGH AGAIN. I'm talking HARDCORE ass whippings and STRENGTH. Current GOP is weak and back broken! We need NEW MEN that understand what is going on and don't play around and get TOUGH!
1320918041304145925 2020-10-27 10:39:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @WokeCultWM It might be better to take down the ruling class / establishment first. Then we have the power to prosecute according to law and order. Which would take care of leftist radicals.
1320917699321569283 2020-10-27 10:38:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @WokeCultWM Yes, agree. We not only have to deal with radical leftists, on top of that they have the backing of the ruling class and establishment and GLOBAL power support. We really are the under-dogs in this situation.
1320916738112978944 2020-10-27 10:34:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @WokeCultWM Yes, that is why I think we need to start prosecuting these threats as like you said "domestic Terrorism". It would shutdown that shit real quick if they had to serve prison time for being a domestic threat / terrorist in our country. Then we could avoid war all together.
1320916356565532673 2020-10-27 10:32:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Magnus___14 It would almost be better to have a civil war versus just willingly giving it them. Because I worry about foreign troops landing on our soil through the weak liberal feminine areas.
1320915912321622016 2020-10-27 10:31:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Magnus___14 The issue would be foreign nations like China and others infiltrating and getting their troops on our soil through these weak liberal areas. This is why I don't want to give up ANY ground to them. They would be conquered by foreign enemies straight away.
1320915284669141000 2020-10-27 10:28:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Apparently not! There is too much rot!
1320915125499551751 2020-10-27 10:28:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Magnus___14 Then re-conquer them and take it back! They don't deserve ANY of it.
1320914904040222720 2020-10-27 10:27:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @WokeCultWM That is a very good question Sir. They are talking about changing the foundation of an entire nation. If we were a healthy UNITED country we would be treating them as domestic terrorists. Then this bullshit would stop ASAP! They take advantage of our Freedom of Speech.
1320912953726636032 2020-10-27 10:19:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yo it about the popular vote, LMAO I am not going to be ruled by California and you will NEVER get us fly over states to agree to that type of bullshit EVER. Screw off!
1320911933218918401 2020-10-27 10:15:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> ....and here you have it.....the Constitution is "racist". This is why every day I am becoming a larger supporter of kicking people out of the country or national divorce.
1320911589579608069 2020-10-27 10:13:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Already tweeting about getting rid of the "Constitution". Just going to skip over tearing the rest of our statues down and jump right to shredding a founding document.

1320765376427339778 2020-10-27 00:32:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why didn't Kushner discuss this on live television today?
1320764509271805953 2020-10-27 00:29:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Bette Midler with her far left Jewish radicalism has officially ruined me ever enjoying or watching Hocus Pocus again. Thanks for nothing Bette :( #BetteMidlerRuinedHalloween

1320281207205224455 2020-10-25 16:29:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I hope the man I end up with is aware of everything that is going on, red-pilled and up to speed. Because honestly I don't want to have to explain it. Anyhow....I got to go to bed. Good night. Be well.
1320280244390121473 2020-10-25 16:25:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HeritageAmeric6 You should press her hard to have a BLM &amp; Refugee party at her home, LOL and tell her no White folks can come, just non-white's!

1320275707751288832 2020-10-25 16:07:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The thing is....I don't want to take the bullets and arrows for the Chelsea Handler radical left American Jew types. I'm sure many European American women would feel the same. Why do we get blamed for their actions? It's really MESSED up.
1320275006404820992 2020-10-25 16:04:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @goodforharriers NO!!!!
1320274896790970370 2020-10-25 16:03:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> One of the things that bothers me is that radical American Jews like Chelsea Handler get called White. So then us White European women get blamed and called bigots and privileged. So we take the arrows because they call her "White" instead of "Jew". IDK...whatever.
1320273014273998848 2020-10-25 15:56:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The morally corrupt dude that doxed the Nuns should be put in prison in the Middle East. Shouldn't even get fed on taxpayer's dime in one of our luxury prisons! Yes, I am serious.

1320266843525910528 2020-10-25 15:31:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LMAO you cannot appease these people, it is NEVER enough. It's constant and never ending. But I laugh that Wintour is getting ate by her woke employees! P.S diversity is zero White skinned people.

1320264417511178240 2020-10-25 15:22:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The way that my own Country / Government has turned their backs on White men, especially poor White men whose ancestors bled in wars &amp; worked their factories, pisses me me off to the moon and back! Instead they pander to foreigners and newly arrived minorities. #ForgottenMen
1320258296650006529 2020-10-25 14:58:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Uh..yeah...I'm not going to listen to this bullshit every day and hard working White American workers don't need to hear this bullshit in their nation. Her and her family should never have been allowed to migrate to our country. She has zero ancestors.

1319718631878610946 2020-10-24 03:13:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I called my 9 year old nephew "Muscle Man" because he lifted a stuck window up and he said "Well actually I am half bone. Dad calls me "Boney Man". LMAO it's because he is tall and skinny right now growing through a growth spurt. Anyhow he cracks me up.

1319440060899594240 2020-10-23 08:46:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @justicemercy1 Yep, it's just not designed for potatoes so I don't understand why they say it is, LOL But hey at least now we know right?
1319438617392107521 2020-10-23 08:40:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DMatterus hahaha they do look strange. But these will get cleaned, peeled and then cut into 1 inch cubes for soup :) Definitely can't use them for baked potato. I can also slice them and make fried tators :)
1319438134459961344 2020-10-23 08:38:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Nature_and_Race P.S. you aren't showing up in my notifications when you respond to me. I have to click on this thread to even see your responses! Crazy.
1319437515556868096 2020-10-23 08:36:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Nature_and_Race I grew green onions this year in a small metal tub. Next year I am going to grow large onions.
1319437058478379008 2020-10-23 08:34:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Nature_and_Race Hey...I like that idea. I happen to like onions and garlic too. I use it a lot in my cooking! I hope I can remember your tip next year!
1319435766003630081 2020-10-23 08:29:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Raggmuffx3 LMAOOOO that's true, we didn't vote for him to be a singer, but after viewing that I might vote for him as a singer just to piss them off, LOL
1319432158495244288 2020-10-23 08:15:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TuneItAgain Never heard of that method.
1319431523830059010 2020-10-23 08:12:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Capo_Regole @Nature_and_Race 😂😂😅I will need more potatoes! hahahaha
1319431351754522624 2020-10-23 08:12:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Deplorable_PA 😂👍
1319430448188194816 2020-10-23 08:08:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Nature_and_Race Well I know how to do it in a grow bag, but next year they are going in a garden in the ground. I watch giant big potatoes, LOL :) But yes, you are right....potatoes for when times get tough!
1319429757453410304 2020-10-23 08:05:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Deplorable_PA This was pretty easy but took FOREVER and you get like one meal out of it. Not worth it.
1319429500405452802 2020-10-23 08:04:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @paultykwinski1 hahah yes, next year they are going into the ground, LOL
1319429365235650561 2020-10-23 08:04:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If it was Obama and Michael was twerking beside him, you would literally have an orgasm. But oh no....it's Trump having some normal fun.
1319426752163287040 2020-10-23 07:53:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @paultykwinski1 Yep, the grow bag does not give you large russet potatoes, this is why I do not recommend the grow bag.
1319425630279290881 2020-10-23 07:49:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KrzysztofExin Well they are dirty and fresh out of the potting soil, so they look weird right now. LOL
1319425249793003521 2020-10-23 07:47:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman Yeah, I don't have a truck so probably best for me to just plant mine in the ground next year.
1319425014832181248 2020-10-23 07:46:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman Now we have two not recommending the grow bags. You and me, LOL hahaha
1319424757037662209 2020-10-23 07:45:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ReadyFighterOne Do you hate potato chips? I have sliced and made baked homemade potato chips before. But no worries, you don't have to eat these, LOL
1319424162142867457 2020-10-23 07:43:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman But I have plenty of yard space that I can do a very large garden. I just did porch gardening this year and wanted to give the grow bags a try.
1319423881845854209 2020-10-23 07:42:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman I never thought about that. I was also wondering about a stock tank?
1319422494588194822 2020-10-23 07:36:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So I tested growing potatoes in a "grow bag" and I just dumped the bag to view my results. Not too bad, however I do not recommend the grow bag &amp; next year will be planting potatoes in the ground for bigger results. Need to clean them &amp; will make a fine potato soup though :)  https://t.co/OSNpYNGX68
1319413366193008645 2020-10-23 07:00:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Good grief....hang tough my friend. You have my sympathies!!!!!

1319412888507961344 2020-10-23 06:58:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Much hasn't changed for me either.
1319408141369593856 2020-10-23 06:39:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Europinion_ Hi there! Yes I remember you :) So happy you found me and I hope you are doing well too friend!
1319398323321712641 2020-10-23 06:00:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BoyFrenMoody76 Not to mention how many times he has been kicked by horses, bitten by dogs, up all hours of the night, etc.. It is a LOT of work. Physical and mental.
1319397888699600897 2020-10-23 05:59:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BoyFrenMoody76 Yeah, my Vet gets called in the middle of night during calf season. If he didn't love animals, that would be annoying to him and everyone would suffer, including the animals. It's not a job to take "lightly".
1319394244642115586 2020-10-23 05:44:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rdr70024 Indeed she was!

1319359187114217475 2020-10-23 03:25:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> All we can do is just support those that create lawsuits against Brandy Zadrozny. Of course a Bolshevik propaganda network such as NBS is going to form a shell around their Communist hitwoman. We are at war folks &amp; until we win and remove the Media empires, stop watching them.
1319356039498694661 2020-10-23 03:12:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SLYR123 hahahaha well it's stupid and she has the balls to yell at a Native British woman just because she asked her to stop being divisive and grateful.

1319345706235252736 2020-10-23 02:31:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Robert0Guiscard DISGUSTING.
1319344955115081730 2020-10-23 02:28:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rebornspirit5 Yeah, I know and this what they imported into her country and EXACTLY what they want! For us to be outnumbered and conquered!
1319341009344540672 2020-10-23 02:13:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So cool for you to decide people that built a civilization are the one's in the wrong. LOL You just want what Penny's ancestors created and her to just give it away and GOD forbid she say something or be called "racist". Fucking stupid.
1319337369447837706 2020-10-23 01:58:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bluedogred33 I saw someone defending her on my feed! So I opened it up and saw DISGUSTING pile on!
1319335888296595456 2020-10-23 01:52:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You sound like another Shaniqua.
1319334981903187971 2020-10-23 01:49:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If you look under the comments of this, you see nothing but everyone ganging up on Penny, who is a native of Britain, has ancestors that stretch far back that established the civilization that this "BRITISH BORN NIGERIAN" is degrading her. DISGUSTING. Penny did nothing wrong.
1319332665686970380 2020-10-23 01:39:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL isn't Diversity so great? What is a British born Nigerian? If born in China is that like a Chinese born Nigerian? How about a Brazilian born Nigerian? So many possibilities with this. Mexican born Nigerian. Honduran born Nigerian!
1319316235876749312 2020-10-23 00:34:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL you do realize that White children are already minorities in America. So you going to mandate that they be represented and their tuition waived? I sure hope so!
1319315762725724161 2020-10-23 00:32:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So tired of this anti-White bullshit in my country.

1319115337946832896 2020-10-22 11:16:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> MSM activists that pose as reporters / journalists want us all punished, ruin our lives, and prefer us dead. We seen on Tucker tonight NBC news hires a female hitman to dox Americans. Will she lose her job? Will she be sued? Something should be done, tired of sweeping under rugs!
1319114438818095104 2020-10-22 11:12:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Obama still prances around in Western culture attire of suit and tie like the fraud he is. We all know, so why doesn't he just come out in his robes and Middle East Islam attire?
1319097442395193345 2020-10-22 10:05:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DavidSc91604412 @LouisCarrillo75 I blame the media, because they did NOT depict him for what he really was!
1319092255454625792 2020-10-22 09:44:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> OMG.....all the blue checks are coming out to defend their communist co-worker who doxes Trump supporters and ruins American lives. So disgusting.

1319078219136389126 2020-10-22 08:48:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is anti-White and you are saying that rural white voters that don't have college degrees have sons that are crackheads? FUCK YOU.
1319077934745948160 2020-10-22 08:47:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Hold the fuck up ........ why did you pick "rural White voters" as an example and comparison to crackhead son of a politician and one that GOT RICH with dirty money deals? You racist POS.
1319060541378334721 2020-10-22 07:38:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Was Omar worth it? Of course not, END this program from the 80's that made Contractors RICH and brought foreign cultures that didn't assimilate.

1319056571125669888 2020-10-22 07:22:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are so repulsive. One crime is one too many that can be prevented if law was enforced.

1318835655041056769 2020-10-21 16:44:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Something definitely fishy going on with twitter. It just feels all off and really does feel like everyone is being held back. If the gates were lifted there would be a massive overload of Patriots and right wing tweets. Anyhow, good night!

1318770166327660544 2020-10-21 12:24:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It's shameful if any White suburban mom votes for child molestation with a Biden vote after knowing of Hunter Biden. Disgusting.
1318760563598557191 2020-10-21 11:46:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JordanBPeterman @HBatakus It is weak and gross.
1318759060594921473 2020-10-21 11:40:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is what Forbes chose as a rising star under 30 years old. WTF.

1318718811906990085 2020-10-21 09:00:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @oggupito He is definitely a leftist but infiltrates as a Republican. He did say he was going to switch to Democrat, not sure if he has yet or not. He is a fraud.
1318716483124551682 2020-10-21 08:51:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JordanBPeterman Oh GAWD....so glad you dodged that. HUGS.
1318715892201607169 2020-10-21 08:49:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JordanBPeterman Is that where you would have been placed? In the HR department? We dodged a bullet my friend! We really did.
1318714043822231552 2020-10-21 08:41:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So glad I didn't end up in a HR department head hunting for affirmative action and diversity quotes against qualifying White European Americans. Shameful.
1318710052157640706 2020-10-21 08:25:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Biden who is rejected by the American people himself, keeps picking all the rejects. Kamala was rejected on her Presidential bid and Democrat John Kasich was rejected when he tried running against Trump in 2016. These rejects just don't GET IT. WE DON'T WANT THEM.

Some people are drawn to drama &amp; don't feel normal without it. It's very weird. Stay away!

1318324349942845445 2020-10-20 06:53:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @wrinklemelster OMG...I am SO jealous!!!!!!!
1318324238093352962 2020-10-20 06:52:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman My basement is an old unfinished basement though. My house was built in 1910, but it's a large basement. My garage is a two car garage, unattached from the house :)
1318323986640429057 2020-10-20 06:51:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BronzeAgeShaman Yes, why? You want to move in? LMAO
1318323491062558722 2020-10-20 06:49:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Welp, it's officially cold and I am going to have to go into hibernation mode. Old Man Winter and I are not friends, LOL
1318320008028688387 2020-10-20 06:35:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SauvageBeau Well yes, a Veteran Memorial with a cross had to be removed from a small town. Foreigners at meat packing plants. Then getting attacked on twitter because I'm White.
1318319478392967168 2020-10-20 06:33:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CalmRunnings I still believe in getting married young. My experience is NOT a normal example. What occurred in my experience was very rare. My family and tons of my friends married young like me and they are all still together :)
1318318636222812161 2020-10-20 06:30:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SauvageBeau Happened here on twitter since 2016.
1318318288468955136 2020-10-20 06:29:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SauvageBeau Twitter radicalized me, LOL
1318318134680485890 2020-10-20 06:28:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RangerJohnAllen Awesome! No wonder we follow each other hahahahaha I did Classic Rock of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Janis Joplin, to 80's hairbands, Poison, Pat Benatar, etc., to GNR to some Pop.
1318316931368235008 2020-10-20 06:23:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> P.S. I went through a long phase where I felt ashamed and REALLY embarrassed to have to admit that I was "divorced". Especially when dating someone new and worrying what they would think of that and what their parents would think of it when finding out about me.
1318316347147825154 2020-10-20 06:21:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SauvageBeau I will say though that I do remember a phase where I thought "Republican meant for the Rich". I thought the Democrat party was for the poor.
1318315579229470720 2020-10-20 06:18:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SauvageBeau I can't really say because I have voted for both Democrat and Republican in the past. I voted Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump. I never considered myself to be anything really?
1318315166560325632 2020-10-20 06:16:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RangerJohnAllen Classic rock to alternative 90's.

1318295045041233921 2020-10-20 04:56:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The skeleton in my closet is I had a failed marriage. I married young, my first real boyfriend. I have been divorced for 18 years, never re-married. I am over the fear that I will choose the wrong person and I hope to have a successful marriage like my Grandparents. That is all.
1318292501938262018 2020-10-20 04:46:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> With all the drama going on in the DR, I feel that I must make this known about me. I'm not in any political group, DM groups, or part of anything. Just by myself on here, worried about the future. It scares me that folks on the right attack the right. That is all I want to say.
1318291801975836673 2020-10-20 04:43:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I have always loved singing/music. I sang my first solo in the 5th grade, sang in a Country band for a year I was 21, then sang in a Rock Cover band for 13 years on the weekends. Not very trad, yes I know. But it was some of the best times in my life, kept me out of trouble.
1318275721123553280 2020-10-20 03:39:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rdr70024 That is awesome! I'm so happy you are going to do this too :) She is going to be so happy!

1318068334106234881 2020-10-19 13:55:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jfmarlin It was! I will remember their little happy faces that day FOREVER. I want to do it again soon, LOL

1318054362095157248 2020-10-19 13:00:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JordanBPeterman To see them SO happy and so excited was the best present really....more of a present for me than for them, LOL We made a good memory that day :)
1318053716025659392 2020-10-19 12:57:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Friendly reminder, everything costs $1....so they got to fill the cart with whatever their hearts desired! I'm going to do this again before they get too old and it's "not cool" anymore, LOL :)
1318052744285085696 2020-10-19 12:53:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I never said but....Thursday I took my twin nieces and my nephew to the Dollar Tree and let them pick out everything they wanted. LOL I did it as an early birthday gift. I spent $60 but it was worth it. They were so HAPPY and acted like they had just won the lottery! It was FUN.
1318050151420887045 2020-10-19 12:43:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DesertCatsRule Yes, I don't have a saw :( He has the tools.

1318049801527828480 2020-10-19 12:42:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Anyhow, I got 4 new gutter downspout extensions, a pair of replacement exterior shutters, and some outdoor motion lights. Now just got to install it all and I am ready for fall rainy season!
1318048515818401792 2020-10-19 12:37:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> My stepdad is coming next weekend to help me repair the wall under a window that got wet and ruined. I need him to measure, cut, and hang dry wall because I don't know how! But I am going to help. #IfIOnlyHadAMan #Family

1317651225337335814 2020-10-18 10:18:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The older lady who gave it to me for free said she had her mother's China in it. All that is requested is that I do a "pay it forward". She said can be something as small as buying someone's coffee at the gas station.
1317650556647837696 2020-10-18 10:15:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I am much better now :) Borrowed my brother's truck, grabbed my baby brother and we went and picked up a free hutch that I can display our mother's China set in.
1317554669066031104 2020-10-18 03:54:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> P.S. a guy that goes by the name "Ice Cube" helped negotiate fucking billions of dollars to be directed to one race in America. Fucking clown world x 1000. Yet White Americans are discriminated against by fraud affirmative action and Diversity Industry, just LOL..just fucking LOL
1317551388956700674 2020-10-18 03:41:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I have to log off, I seen enough for today on here in under one hour to piss me clear the fuck off for the rest of the day. Be back later.
1317550962773512192 2020-10-18 03:40:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There should be ZERO freaking hiring quotas / diversity bullshit and affirmative action abused by every single race used against WHITE AMERICANS in their OWN NATIONS! Our Ancestors didn't create this nation for it to be given away &amp; their descendants discriminated against! WTF!!
1317548668027883520 2020-10-18 03:30:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> "share of Gen Z voters who are Hispanic is significantly higher than the share among other groups of voters" White Gen Z is a minority? Why do we still have Affirmative Action? So sick of this shit.
1317547127820648453 2020-10-18 03:24:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SirajAHashmi @LaurenWitzkeDE You are the reason why young White girls think it's okay to hiking in Middle East and then get raped and their heads lopped off. People need to see the truth!
1317545926941134852 2020-10-18 03:20:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You f**ks always want to hide the truth when it doesn't fit your narrative's.

1317356859960033281 2020-10-17 14:48:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Was hanging out with my Aunt today &amp; I saw a Biden/Harris sign in a yard and I said "OMG..they have a Biden/Harris sign, can't believe they're voting for them, what psycho's!" and my Aunt said "They probably think the same about you for voting Trump" then we laughed, Good times.
1317354923164602368 2020-10-17 14:41:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> .....and you are showing a photo of Sass the ASS. It's not secret he was at the private meetings with Paul Ryan in attempts to try and stop Trump from winning the primaries in 2016. This is total propaganda and lame.

1316531741440475138 2020-10-15 08:10:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If Jewish power and malevolence doesn't exist, then what are you worried about? Or are you saying there is evidence out there for people to research on their own and come to a conclusion that Jewish power exists? You cannot "censor" Americans because Soros is Jewish, so absurd!
1316506627890196481 2020-10-15 06:30:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Hurr durr yeah that would be so funny! Meanwhile Biden gets 8 to 10 people that show up, but you don't think that is funny do you Kylie?

1316488565237395456 2020-10-15 05:18:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> They have created words and racial slurs against White (European) people such as "White-lash". When actually it's in reverse and is Anti-White's who want White's to be silent and discriminated against in their own Nations. When you hear this word, understand they hate White's.

Otherwise walk for awhile then go sit in the vehicle pouting. LOL

We would go walk in fields, ditches, and river banks. The heavy rains would wash away dirt uncovering some. Or if a farmer plowed a field and dirt was freshly tilled up.

1315856859090255872 2020-10-13 11:28:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why are you living like a "White European American" in America? The closest you could get to Indian culture that lives as the past I think is in Amazon. You could always go there, because I am sure "American Indians" won't want you on their land reservations we gave them.
1315856304024498176 2020-10-13 11:26:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What country did Indians create? What country are you living in right now?

1315418164772118528 2020-10-12 06:25:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The FBI top brass all needs fired. The American people no longer trust them. We never even found out much of what happened in Vegas with shooting all those people at the country concert. Plus they were part of a treasonous coup! I mean WTF.
1315417595445743616 2020-10-12 06:22:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember the Republicans that were shot at from a radical left supporter during the baseball game? We have all witnessed the terrorism of the left. Yet FBI has to "create" any radicalism on 4-chan &amp; by infiltration on the right. Then say "muh White Supremacy". I am sick of it.
1315411871252480006 2020-10-12 06:00:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So now in Denver Colorado, you can shit in the street legally &amp; get shot in broad daylight by Media assassinators for being a "Trump voter". Whew...we sure have "progressed".

1315388905441701888 2020-10-12 04:28:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @coogler16 Awesome! Yes I told this guy if anything happens to my property, I will file a police report. There are cameras on the property across from mine that sees a wide area.
1315388602835259396 2020-10-12 04:27:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> After the election and cast my vote for Trump, like I said, I will be looking for Nationalist / American First candidates to support. The GOP is just way too weak for me.
1315386959741804544 2020-10-12 04:21:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BenEJohnson1 I agree Trump couldn't have been more protective of his base. I'm voting for him for getting refugee resettlement from 98K down to 15K, and for ending CRT in Federal Tax support. Third reason is to see liberals and media cry.
1315385942463651840 2020-10-12 04:17:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I am going to vote on election day. He is also a leader of my Republican GOP in my district. He is aware I voted for Trump and knows me personally. So I can't say if he would have spoken to me about voting if he hadn't known me.
1315384656389431298 2020-10-12 04:11:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JohnFiliss @VONWEHUNTSHOW Yes, people are scared. This is not America.
1315381964833255424 2020-10-12 04:01:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> He is going to come back this week and set a sign up in my yard. I told him this isn't our America when you can't openly support a President. He said yes, it's Communism. He said little old ladies are watching "The View" on television &amp; he was worried about that.
1315381247888314368 2020-10-12 03:58:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee Yes! I agree!
1315380979557687296 2020-10-12 03:57:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I had an 60 year old man stop at my house and ask if he could put a Trump sign in my yard. He said in Des Moines and Ames he said there are people that are scared to put a Trump yard sign up. This is never happened before in Iowa. He is very worried about what is happening.
1315379977618165763 2020-10-12 03:53:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee He ran the front desk too, he was doing it all. I was impressed! He also was super cool, friendly and really nice! I talked to him for a bit.
1315379343158280194 2020-10-12 03:50:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I watched a good movie last night "The Lie". Great plot twist in it if you like thriller types.
1315378857202024451 2020-10-12 03:48:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @charitystartsat Yes, I did forget to mention that! It's given by the State's too!
1315378473955926016 2020-10-12 03:47:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee I did see a young White male that owned one of the small motels we stopped at in South Dakota. I couldn't believe it, I almost thought he wasn't real, LOL He was busting his tale too, served sausage biscuits and gravy for breakfast! Construction workers fill up his motel rooms.
1315377851697369088 2020-10-12 03:44:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee I could see that affecting why India nationals have purchased all the gas stations and motels. Many Whites may not be interested or like you said want to go to college and just work for someone else. Sad!
1315376387356790787 2020-10-12 03:39:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cabinfervor_ @canucklaw1 Hispanic is considered "Hispanic" when applying for a business loan, but is considered to be "White" when reporting crime statistics by the media. LOL
1315374942570115072 2020-10-12 03:33:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Anyhow would be a good project for an investigative journalist to look into. How did all these foreign nationalities acquire all these gas stations and motels?
1315374282051125249 2020-10-12 03:30:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KahlGordon EXACTLY.....so I don't know what that dude is talking about. LOL

1315369120620326914 2020-10-12 03:10:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Cabinfervor_ @canucklaw1 The SBA deems anyone who is Black, Hispanic, Native American, or Asian American to be socially disadvantaged.

1315036642902769666 2020-10-11 05:09:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RichardSalPhD Well I am a rebel. I do it and I won't stop :)
1315036500678107136 2020-10-11 05:08:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> That is all for today, thank you for letting me express my thoughts and opinions today. I am off now to go spend time with family. Have a great day and keep your chin up!
1315035187751931905 2020-10-11 05:03:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Now with the declining of the White poor male American population, Government is now sending outreach to your poor White American daughters and new migrant foreigners to fill the ranks in our Army / Military. Soon the poor White male won't even be pandered to even by them! #Sick
1315034354960171008 2020-10-11 04:59:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> No Politician has spoken of how Government has taken advantage of the poor White American male into enticing them to join the Army / Military because it's their ONLY option for work &amp; help with college funding. It's been their pipe-line for warm White bodies to be used for war.
1315033221810315264 2020-10-11 04:55:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> When Trump won the election, Media, Coastal Elites, Anti-White journalists, and snobby liberal rich lashed out at the White American poor population for voting Trump. They were called "rednecks" "racists" "bigots" and the "last gasp of White's". They have been hostile since day 1
1315030261566976004 2020-10-11 04:43:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Soon, poor white families would only have 1 or 2 kids instead of 6 to 10 like their Grandparents. This was celebrated and encouraged by Media and our hostile anti-American elites. While the poor White families tax money was sent as foreign aid to feed billions in 3rd world.
1315028808441958400 2020-10-11 04:37:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> They allowed and encouraged the break up of the nuclear family that was the heart that held strong families, especially the poor together. Discouraged these people turned to birth control because they could no longer afford large families. Cost of living went up, wages went down.
1315027596808159233 2020-10-11 04:33:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Rich non-Patriotic elite/Government did NOTHING when poor White Americans began having BOTH wife &amp; husband go to work to make ends meet. Instead was disguised as "feminism" and pro-Woman labor force sham called "equality". These workers have not received a raise since 1970's.
1315026630218330113 2020-10-11 04:29:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @conniezey1 @mrcleansedotcom Thank you!
1315024354531565568 2020-10-11 04:20:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Many poor White American men and women that had never voted before came out to vote for Donald Trump in 2016 because he was the first man in decades that spoke about our factories that were sold out to China &amp; Mexico. They were left with nothing in the small towns they grew up in
1315018833070034944 2020-10-11 03:58:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Capo_Regole ❤️Thank you so much for appreciating me!!!!!!!!!!!! HUGS.

1315015315898720258 2020-10-11 03:44:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bstovalljr @arthur_oslund FACT CHECK = TRUE
1315014975207940096 2020-10-11 03:42:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Poor White  American men who are born into poverty, poor small towns that were raped and pillaged by Oligarchs then abandoned when no longer needed, are laughed at for unfortunate circumstances &amp; told how they have "White Privilege". Yet are discriminated against by our own Gov.
1315012733616697349 2020-10-11 03:34:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> American White European people are NOT allowed to invest in their poor White populations. It is deemed "racist". Yet Rich Blacks can invest in poor Black neighborhoods. Even White people can invest in poor Blacks. Poor White men are just given drugs and alcohol until suicide.
1315011971792723970 2020-10-11 03:31:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Politicians don't talk about how our nation has treated neglected the Poor White male living in the remains and ruins of small towns. Where they have turned to drug abuse.  We can talk about poor Blacks &amp; unfortunate circumstances, but don't you DARE speak of the poor White man.
1315010377139326978 2020-10-11 03:24:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Politicians will use broad vague terms such as "working class" to avoid saying the Poor and broke White European Male. You can't even say the word "White" in our freaking nation without hostility and accusations of racism. So the poor White male is never addressed or spoken too!
1315009624093884416 2020-10-11 03:21:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There is absolutely ZERO Politicians in our United States Government Congress that speaks nor cares about the forgotten poor White American male. They will speak about poor Blacks, but they do not dare speak about poor White men. It's a fucking disgrace and is considered "taboo".
1315008478805716992 2020-10-11 03:17:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There is no Government program offered to help a poor White European American man in his own nation. He is denied any empathy or support. His only options are to join the Army / Military to help with college and training. But a foreign man qualifies for many programs through Gov.
1315007337061650433 2020-10-11 03:12:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Government programs that offer welfare, loan assistance, business start-ups, organic farming, etc.. are all anti-White towards the poor White European American male. The very same men whose Ancestors built the nation, are excluded from Government programs. DISGRACEFUL.
1315006242868391936 2020-10-11 03:08:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Government provides low interest loans &amp; even free money grants to minorities. A poor White European American male with roots in our nation does not qualify for these loans or business start-ups. Even organic farming is being sold by Government. Poor White men denied access.
1315003651660881920 2020-10-11 02:57:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Instead of investing in Americans living in hard hit economic zones throughout our country, Government sold small already established businesses such as gas stations, motels, etc.. to foreign people. Instead of investing in poor Americans, Government invested in foreigners.
1315002357118365698 2020-10-11 02:52:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Across America you can see the "fake" propped up economy that many independent businesses (Motel 6, Motel 8, former Best Western's, Gas Stations, small grocery stores) would have died after those original owners retired, because Government helped foreigners purchase them. #Fraud
1315000829523488770 2020-10-11 02:46:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Foreign nationalities from India, Pakistan, etc.. are given Government minority low interest loans to buy up small gas stations, grocery general stores, motels, etc.. across our nation. They sell America's inheritance to foreigners and not the American people with roots in USA.
1314999853156569095 2020-10-11 02:42:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bluedogred33 @GovBillLee Yes my Governor Kim Reynolds has also show support for Refugee Resettlement for the Jewish contractors in Iowa to make money off taxpayers and dump cheap labor into small towns across Iowa.
1314998288035328005 2020-10-11 02:36:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Refugee Resettlement into America has become a national security threat. The program began in 1980's and after 40 years we see the negative results of bringing foreign cultures into our homelands. END the fraud money scheme of Refugee Resettlement now!

1314813021173280769 2020-10-10 14:20:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jcr_6234 @DMatterus Night night!!!!

LOL I get a lot of 55 to 65 that message me on the dating app. The guys in their 40's are quiet, they hit the like and want to meet you and then never say anything. The guys in the late 30's chat you then disappear. LOL
1314812124997312513 2020-10-10 14:16:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DMatterus @jcr_6234 @IcebergAttorney @f3eb88a9ee68f4c @Western_Annie I've had some crazies too. I had this guy that was a raging alcoholic and he was pissed that I didn't want to give him a "chance" he yelled at me, called me names. I even had a stalker. I just had to leave the dating scene for awhile.

But he can definitely influence her. Women can be insecure and low self esteem. I think we all go through that phase and it's unbearable for those around us LOL

Some are just oblivious to what is going on. Living in bubbles!

Also in my age dating range...there aren't many attractive men left, LOL haaaaaaaaaaaaaa Oh and I get the one's that don't even have a license or car asking me out, LOL
1314804918927196160 2020-10-10 13:48:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jcr_6234 @IcebergAttorney @f3eb88a9ee68f4c @Western_Annie Like I love to flirt, but it's like they skip the entire process of getting to know someone and if you are compatible for a serious relationship and want to go straight to having sex. It's like step one....and jumps to step 10.
1314803856338038784 2020-10-10 13:44:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jcr_6234 @IcebergAttorney @f3eb88a9ee68f4c @Western_Annie It's gross. They will message me like one day, ask me for my number, then start sexting me and I am like "dude, I don't even know you!" LOL and it turns me off. Because then I know he just want to have sex and not a serious relationship.

No, I did think we were going to end up getting married, so I didn't push for marriage. Now him and my cousin live together and he is with her now, LOL I wasted 7 years! I should have stayed with the one I was with at age 34.

1314762493483462657 2020-10-10 10:59:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Trump gets pelleted with lawsuits from these immigration lawyers / Refugee Resettlement Contractors that have gotten rich off the system. I have to credit him for managing to get it down to 15K. Maybe if we can keep him in office, we get rid of it all together!
1314762036279160832 2020-10-10 10:57:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yes we want  be ZERO and to end the program. There is a better way and better solution than the old 1980's act. BUT given how bloated and well paid the orgs have been scamming that system for years....for Trump to get it down to 15K is practically a miracle. Because they sue!
1314759817257521152 2020-10-10 10:49:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Ears2Hear2 @candylotus @WereCovfefe Taxpayers paid for Omar to come to our nation. Tell me how that has benefited me as a taxpayer and American citizen? It's the opposite, she brought her culture, hates my nation and it's people, and is in Congress!
1314759243321561088 2020-10-10 10:46:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Ears2Hear2 @candylotus @WereCovfefe Taking in refugees isn't solving the issue. Otherwise it will continue and be a burden to the middle class and lower class taxpayers of a European / American nation. These orgs that have robbed us for years can go to those countries and set up shelters or whatever they want.

1314757774040014849 2020-10-10 10:40:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @candylotus @WereCovfefe Knew it! That is why she is bitching....it's cutting her scam of skimming money off of taxpayer funding!
1314757442559934465 2020-10-10 10:39:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 He thought it was funny, LOL
1314755971542114304 2020-10-10 10:33:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 Thank you! But it is the DOJ that must do something!
1314755505714233345 2020-10-10 10:31:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There was a Black guy in a department next to mine who told me he was calling in on Martin Luther King day, telling the boss he wasn't going to work. I said "Are you worried you will get fired?" He laughed and said "What are they going to do? Fire me? They can't, I'm Black".
1314754099661938688 2020-10-10 10:26:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is why I think Government needs to do more. DOJ should have a site where folks can apply their cases anonymously. Just like for H1B fraud, you can report it. These are FEDERAL agencies using CRT with tax dollars. If this was being done to Blacks, there would be OUTRAGE.

1314751212470898688 2020-10-10 10:14:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ZedDez15 I would file lawsuit that my Civil Rights were violated.
1314750458116878336 2020-10-10 10:11:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AccurateCaption Yes, it's a giant elephant in the room and NOBODY with a large platform or even in our Congress is talking about it.
1314749661408907264 2020-10-10 10:08:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Critical Race Training and Racial Sensitivity training is in violation of White European Americans civil rights according to:  https://t.co/UcOki8WOID
1314748508923203585 2020-10-10 10:04:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Would George Washington sit through a "Critical Race training" or "Racial Sensitivity Training"? No, because it's demoralizing, degrading, hateful, completely Anti-White, and does not belong in the United States of America. If you hate White people that MUCH, you should leave.
1314744801548472326 2020-10-10 09:49:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> American radical left Jews really hate White people. Their attacks on European Americans is relentless! It's a huge problem.
1314743944790540289 2020-10-10 09:45:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Why? There are Black dating sites. There are Jewish only dating sites. There is even a Filipino dating site. Maybe it's because "White" is used? Perhaps try European American? Although you shouldn't have too.
1314742876715311105 2020-10-10 09:41:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The gravy train flowed for all of you since the 1980's. Refugee Resettlement Act is outdated, it's 2020 and the world has changed. Also it is NOT the responsibility of taxpayers to pay for foreign cultures to come here who never assimilate. You can go to their nations help there!

1314638262493949952 2020-10-10 02:46:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianHe51818219 I thought that was you! Welcome back!
1314636313954603011 2020-10-10 02:38:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bluedogred33 Same experience here. The last two years I spent at a Corporation I was in an all female department, I suffered massive depression and was miserable. I even spoke to my family doctor about it. The stress those women put me through!

1314631920764977152 2020-10-10 02:20:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> How is the defunding of this and kicking them out of New York going? Is anyone working on kicking this org out of America? They are making up words and causing division in the United States of America. Foreign orgs need KICKED OUT now!

1314426216993128448 2020-10-09 12:43:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RedeemedCat @Seven_Crimes Thank you by the way for the FREE BOOK! I saved to my computer so I can read it and check it out!
1314425166332596224 2020-10-09 12:39:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So Christians of different denominations flee from Europe for religious persecution, come here and founded a brand new nation and now 400 years later are persecuted again in their own nation. The upside down of this clown world is so messed up!
1314423654302785539 2020-10-09 12:33:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Mikesports5 I know, I think she wants attention. It's a sickness. Even I have been mistaken for working somewhere, I must have looked like I knew what I was doing, LOL

But when Politicians and Government is pushing it....there is DEFINITELY an AGENDA behind it! LOL
1314421855575576576 2020-10-09 12:26:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RedeemedCat @Seven_Crimes Yeah, it's popularity began 1940 and changed from meaning  a "jew that converted to Christianity" to "Judeo Christian values based on the Bible and the Torah". Like a religion civil union or something and 1948 or whatever "Israel" was founded &amp; America became joined at hips!

1314418966165680128 2020-10-09 12:14:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TuneItAgain @Seven_Crimes 😂😂
1314418860280418304 2020-10-09 12:14:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RedeemedCat @Seven_Crimes I am just making names up, LOL Because Christians now are grouped with Jews, the bible and the torah. "Judeo-Christian" is what they are calling it. So I was saying Islam is a branch so it would be "Judeo-Islam"
1314417442131767296 2020-10-09 12:08:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Seven_Crimes Well to correct it would be "Christian-Islam"
1314417010684690434 2020-10-09 12:06:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Seven_Crimes My opinion is that it is a way to force the American people to be forever bound to having to support Israel or be a colony of Israel. Why is the Judeo-Christian pushed at sart of 1940 at same time of establishing "Israel"? I don't think it's a coincidence.
1314416372202471425 2020-10-09 12:04:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Seven_Crimes Islam is a branch off of Christianity. So are we going to start saying "Islamo-Christrian"? Or are we going to say "Judeo-Christian-Islamo". I mean it's getting all too absurd.
1314416000515932161 2020-10-09 12:02:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Seven_Crimes All I know is that the term was used in the past as a Jwe converting to Christian but started getting popularized around the 1940's as a political, civil-religion use. I'm sorry but our country was not built around the Torah. Christianity stems from Judeo, but they aren't same.
1314414945392644099 2020-10-09 11:58:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Seven_Crimes What is that?

1314385067360256006 2020-10-09 09:59:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DannoBlammo Yeah, I am by myself on here, I would hate to lose my account. But it's out of my hands really.
1314384797762977799 2020-10-09 09:58:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I know I can't be the only American that is tired and I mean tired of hearing the word "racist" because we don't want to be made minorities after 400 years &amp; if we are, that we would like some advocation and some civil rights. Do we not get equality? It baffles me.
1314383726386778113 2020-10-09 09:54:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DannoBlammo LOL not really. I don't want to lose my account. But I have considered having a troll account because they have made me so angry before, LOL
1314382992782102530 2020-10-09 09:51:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DannoBlammo We must share the same type of "fire" and vengeance inside us, LOL hahaha because that sounds like something I would do. LOL hahahahahahaha

1314381141642809345 2020-10-09 09:44:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DannoBlammo I know, I am so horrible at that. I get my feathers ruffled. Dang it.

1314380894510231567 2020-10-09 09:43:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> People don't want White(European) Americans to talk about their race wanting advocation and representation in our nations. We get called racist and hick! It's seriously messed up. If my Ancestors knew this would happen, they would have rioted in 1965 against the Hart-Celar act.
1314380288672268289 2020-10-09 09:40:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SLYR123 Wow. I like using Ancestry because it is linked to my DNA test. Helps me find my ancestors.
1314380009834979331 2020-10-09 09:39:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DannoBlammo I did block. Thanks.
1314378207538425857 2020-10-09 09:32:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are a liar and if you were a real American of American heart, you wouldn't have called me a "hick". Now politely go harass someone else like you seem to enjoy doing and make sure they are American too! LOL
1314377796001697792 2020-10-09 09:31:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Go away or I'm going to block. You were demanding of me to show proof from the very start. But you don't hold yourself to the same demands. You are just trying to get out of posting an Ancestor like I did. What are you scared of?
1314377006151274496 2020-10-09 09:27:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are lying. I can't take anything you say in good faith now. Not after the conversation we had and you still haven't provided one ounce of proof. Good bye and good night!
1314376286740021253 2020-10-09 09:25:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I've even posted records of my Grandfather's that fought in American Revolution. But you can search my twitter, I am not doing your fucking leg work for you because you like to harass Americans on the internet.
1314375957634056194 2020-10-09 09:23:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What I posted to you I have already posted before. You were trying to see if I came from the South and was going to call me a racist. Then when you found I came from the North....you called me a hick! You are just a piece of crap that likes to harass actual Americans.
1314375164566687744 2020-10-09 09:20:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SLYR123 Really? They have all of it? I have trouble reading the Quaker records....the writing is small and the the cursive isn't the clearest.
1314374641767591936 2020-10-09 09:18:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Because you are a fake pretending to be an American and you go around harassing ACTUAL Americans on twitter and call them "racist" and "hick". You are a liar and you thought you could catch me in a lie. But I am 100 percent unashamed and proud American.
1314374177625911298 2020-10-09 09:16:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL you think you hurt me with "hick"? hahahahaha I'm still going to kick your ass out, LOL
1314373923493081090 2020-10-09 09:15:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I've taken a DNA test, and yes I use to sites. Now quit beating around the bush, show me an Ancestor of the war please. Like you demanded that I do!
1314373661034512389 2020-10-09 09:14:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DMatterus :(
1314373450673385475 2020-10-09 09:13:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You still haven't shown me a clip like I did you of one of your Ancestors from the Civil War because you were SO adamant that I showed mine and kept saying fucking "crickets" and you know you fucks like to dox.
1314373212453695488 2020-10-09 09:12:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What are you talking about? Yes, I have lots too, thousands according to Ancestry. It's shows like 1K+ for cousins, LOL  I still don't understand what your problem is and why you are bothering me.
1314372565100638208 2020-10-09 09:10:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't understand what you are trying to say. No, so far my earliest is 1620 and he was a Carpenter. But I am still working on my tree, it's a lot of research and I take long breaks.
1314371937716625408 2020-10-09 09:07:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay, you have ancestors like me that fought every single war, cool. Now show me one from the Civil War.
1314371679884382210 2020-10-09 09:06:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Show me an Ancestor of yours in the war please.
1314371584057110530 2020-10-09 09:06:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm not insecure, LOL I talk about my ancestors all the time and in fact you could find posts about them from me, LOL I am VERY open. I am very proud :)
1314371370445352964 2020-10-09 09:05:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay, I showed you an Ancestor of mine because you were being all bossy and accusing of me. Now it's only fair that you show me one of yours that fought in one of America's wars. Let's be equal here.
1314370950897504258 2020-10-09 09:03:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Show me an Ancestor of yours now, since I showed you one of mine! Let's be equal in our playing here shall we?
1314370818038804480 2020-10-09 09:03:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Okay it's your turn now! How many wars have your Ancestors fought in for America?
1314370511762317319 2020-10-09 09:02:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm still building my tree on Ancestry. Why does it matter what side my Ancestors fought on? You sound like you might be a racist against Americans. I think you need to fuck off.
1314369697572368384 2020-10-09 08:58:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> No, I have two Great Grandfather's that fought in the American Revolution. One that fought in the French Indian War, I have a Civil War Union Grandfather, I have grand fathers in WWI and WWII. What are you wanting?
1314368851304472577 2020-10-09 08:55:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Are you trying to dox me?

My connection is my Ancestors, who fought every war clear back to the the French Indian and American Revolution. They fought so I could be free. They settled and made towns, schools, farmed. I love this land.

1314361459627917314 2020-10-09 08:26:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KunchokTendar I agree! They really do dominate on using Celebrities and minorities to get votes. They are disgusting.

1314347533204967424 2020-10-09 07:30:45 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> How come neither party announces it's going to have an Irish American actor pander to Irish Americans to vote! Or we don't have a Scottish American speaker motivating Scottish Americans to vote! Or why don't they hire an English American to speak to voters?
1314346343566118912 2020-10-09 07:26:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Puerto Ricans? Shouldn't it be Americans? Oh that's right we have Americans, then we have little mini nations of certain ethnicity inside America. Got it.

1314066081590411264 2020-10-08 12:52:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> For those crazy ass libs saying "she's a woman, she should get to talk, and he shut up and listen". Foreign leaders aren't going to give a crap that Kamala has a vagina. If she can't handle herself without sassy eye rolls, etc., she is NOT a leader and has NO business running.
1314064366271180800 2020-10-08 12:45:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JasonDerekLee He is not a man. He has been dominated by feminism and struggles with his virtue signal takes to be trendy and liked. He is lost and doesn't even know who he is. :(
1314063090850422784 2020-10-08 12:40:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If it existed she wouldn't have been on that stage tonight and running on a 2020 ticket. If it existed she wouldn't have been Senator. If it existed, Obama would not have been President 2 terms.

1314041219090178048 2020-10-08 11:13:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FirstZoomer Yes Sir, that is correct and something that must be addressed in forth coming years!

1314040315687428098 2020-10-08 11:09:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So apparently there was a fly at the debate and he decided to cast his vote for VP Pence. Even the fly chose Pence over Kamala, hahahahahahahahaha
1314038880560132096 2020-10-08 11:04:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @jeanniology @atkinastarling You got that right! EXACTLY.

1314038012053991426 2020-10-08 11:00:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It's because they have now had two leftist Progressive Democrats as moderators. The moderator in a normal country would be "neutral".

1314031811006287872 2020-10-08 10:36:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I am reminded again why Mike Pence and Donald Trump go together so well. A very nice balance. Pence fills Trumps weaknesses and vice versa. A good team.
1314030097985409026 2020-10-08 10:29:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If folks are wondering why I am not watching debates this year, because I pulled the media / cable plug in August of 2017. I refuse to support their Communism. I do recommend Tucker Carlson, alternative media, etc..
1314029369808039936 2020-10-08 10:26:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I think Mike Pence must be a modern day example of what the founders meant when they said "men of good character".

I think it's safe to say that Kamala is a straight up bi^(h, and not very approachable or likeable. That doesn't sound very American at all. I hope it turns off many Americans, in fact I know it will.

1313950019393933317 2020-10-08 05:11:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So......Project Inclusion is a top priority and not actual training to protect our nation which is what the Army is intended for? WTF.
1313949553993953287 2020-10-08 05:09:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> OMG....this looks weak as fuck! Delete this immediately. YIKES. This is not exhibiting strength or intimidation to foreign enemies.
1313947699801096192 2020-10-08 05:01:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KarlThorburn @arthur_oslund Even females compete with other females, LOL trying to be the prettiest or most desirable to get what they want.
1313947279108210688 2020-10-08 05:00:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KarlThorburn @arthur_oslund The issue is that White European men are not being allowed to compete! Even if they score higher or are more qualified for a position, affirmative action candidates trumps them!
1313946631704907790 2020-10-08 04:57:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @rugnoram Because we have been brainwashed and the only race that has been taught to share everything we create and have with others.
1313946017297989633 2020-10-08 04:55:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @KarlThorburn @arthur_oslund Competition has been a part of human nature since the beginning. Men competing for female mates all the way up to civilizations with war tribes conquering other civilizations, to modern day sports like the Olympics.
1313939115981844480 2020-10-08 04:27:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @JoeRudyard I am all for extending a pause on immigration for longer :)

1313936795499991041 2020-10-08 04:18:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It is just as dangerous for a nation to import and upper Elite class as it is to import a lower welfare class. Immigration is tricky! Let's take a pause on immigration for at least 10 years and invest / educate in our own population.
1313935619098320896 2020-10-08 04:13:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Sweeptheleg141 @HateJunkie LOL you mean it didn't make you want to vote for Biden? 😂😂😂😂😂😂

1313934281316749318 2020-10-08 04:08:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @mrcleansedotcom I don't think those courses are called that in high school. But you get what I mean that our children are being taught about "white privilege".
1313933624857841664 2020-10-08 04:06:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @mrcleansedotcom I do think that Critical Race  or what they are trying to spin as "racial sensitivity training" has affected our young adults psychologically / mentally. I think we have to consider that damage has been done.

NO those students would be suspended &amp; it would be deemed "hate". But we allow this treatment towards Christians and it's atrocious!

1313629386755768321 2020-10-07 07:57:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I sure would like to know when Americans voted to elect and crown the United States Chamber of Commerce to give Americans inheritance and jobs away to foreigners and wealthy non-Patriotic bug people! #WeWereNeverAsked
1313596801732272130 2020-10-07 05:47:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Meanwhile Soros and the other billionaires funding the Communists laughs, his fat belly shaking with glee!
1313596371065278465 2020-10-07 05:45:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't see any Germans running around hitting folks over the head, burning American flags and rioting in Portland. To say they are Antifa is pure fucking garbage brain disposal talk. One of the most stupidest fucking things I have read today. Yeah, it's the Germans, LOL
1313594109542772746 2020-10-07 05:36:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Imagine blaming what is going on in America and the chaos of our nation in 2020 on the "Germans". Fucking shameful.
1313593752020189184 2020-10-07 05:35:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We have Americans of German descent that migrated here BEFORE 1940. How do you think they feel about this tweet? What if you said "The Arabs gave us ISIS and Islam" or "The Africans gave us Somali refugees and Islam"? When will you all stop blaming Germans for your problems?

1313578286581198856 2020-10-07 04:34:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> IF you had told me 20 years ago that I would be bitching about how White European men are being treated in their own nations, I would have thought you crazy! But having young White nephews that are going to be thrown into this mess has changed EVERYTHING for me. #Family
1313577267990323201 2020-10-07 04:30:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> One of the things that really pisses me off is that our taxpayer government allowed millions of paper citizens into our nation that take advantage of the "freedoms" in America to trash talk our history, men, women, and children. I will never forgive that act of betrayal.
1313575291122528256 2020-10-07 04:22:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @AvianSoul1 Thank you dear friend!!!!
1313574988805541893 2020-10-07 04:20:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nitsch_robert Yes, don't ruin your life and have your family starved to death. Timing is everything. When it happens, it must be large, organized, and planned. If they are attacking you, then they are NOT rw women that you should be associating with!
1313573945363361793 2020-10-07 04:16:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> However, I am not sure it would be wise or safe to send them away, prison actually may be the better option. We will have to vote and decide on what the American people want to do. They could go to their homeland &amp; start an uprising which is a precaution we have to consider.
1313570993957412865 2020-10-07 04:05:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ReadyFighterOne They didn't think we would allow ourselves to be taken over by utter re&amp;*^ds that would twist the words to mean something else!

1313570311330242560 2020-10-07 04:02:21 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> When building this nation, all those big Whig fucks didn't care about "minority quotas" and "diversity quotas" when they filled their factories with White European American men, women, and children!
1313568605016076297 2020-10-07 03:55:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Thank you all who left suggestions on the book question I had. Others can look at your comments if they are interested and make decisions on buying old books.
1313568158280822785 2020-10-07 03:53:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is fucked up beyond belief and not okay.
1313567811873189894 2020-10-07 03:52:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Imagine being a White European American male descended from an ancestor that fought in the American Revolution, established a free nation, and then in 2020 colleges, media, journalists, corporations, saying they have to hire a paper citizen minority and they are just too White!
1313566050303254529 2020-10-07 03:45:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @mikefromslough1 @Tarnseele (((Their))) money
1313565759776448512 2020-10-07 03:44:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Imagine if some infiltrator migrated to China, then puts out propaganda against Chinese men, turns their female population against those men, calls them "racist", enforces the hiring of non-Chinese men, then feminizes those men. Wouldn't be allowed there, only America.
1313563941239427072 2020-10-07 03:37:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Repatriation is a controversial subject, but for many of the infiltrators &amp; enemies, it will be necessary.
1313563395178876930 2020-10-07 03:34:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Mikesports5 Yes, they created many young orphans in Ireland as well. Not to mention the atrocities against Irish women such as rape.
1313562872417579010 2020-10-07 03:32:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Snake_Style87 That is what pisses me off about that piece of trash dude! He isn't even a native in European nations.
1313562523438911490 2020-10-07 03:31:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The enemy has done well and been quite successful in splitting apart American European women and American European men. This has been one of their tactics, we see it in the decline of marriage &amp; that they have turned American White women against their own kind.
1313561796654047232 2020-10-07 03:28:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DenV0_0 He is disgusting.
1313561683810492422 2020-10-07 03:28:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> With the feminizing of men, the discrimination against men, I think it's important one of our main focuses to returning to a healthy society is to #MakeEuropeanMenGreatAgain
1313560404350701572 2020-10-07 03:22:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This guy is an anti-White and hates White Americans. His entire twitter feed is nothing but "muh blumf" "muh racism" "muh fascist". Appalling that he thinks he is speaking for Americans.

1313545385701445643 2020-10-07 02:23:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This here. My thread
1313544935166148615 2020-10-07 02:21:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SauvageBeau They don't call them "the fighting Irish" for nothing :)
1313541191284273152 2020-10-07 02:06:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So if those of Jewish heritage dominated the Atlantic Slave trade, does that mean they are responsible for enslaving the Irish and enticing them out of London into indentured service? Just thinking about this today.
1313540676357951489 2020-10-07 02:04:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoRiotsAllowed @CanisAzureus We get to pay "reparations", lucky us huh?
1313540304260169733 2020-10-07 02:03:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BrianHe51818219 Yes and there are memoirs speaking how African slaves were treated better because they were "property" and well taken care of versus the Irish.
1313539819394469889 2020-10-07 02:01:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CanisAzureus Apparently the Irish get screwed over and get a holiday in America. St. Patrick's day.
1313538302633484290 2020-10-07 01:55:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Agree. Why are we only taught about African slaves in Colonial America and not that the Irish were the first used in labor? Later being replaced by Africans. Is it because if the Irish being of white skin takes away a victim narrative?

1313220246636040193 2020-10-06 04:51:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Between the 1630s and the American Revolution, one-half to two-thirds of white immigrants to the Thirteen Colonies arrived under indentures.[6] Half a million Europeans, mostly young men, also went to the Caribbean under indenture to work on plantations.

In fact, so many Irish were forcibly imported for a time that in some Caribbean colonies, like Barbados, they constituted the largest ethnic group on the island.

1312557280232198146 2020-10-04 08:56:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh...by showing that the NFL and NBA is majority Black players and unequal representation of White players?

1312545417041715202 2020-10-04 08:09:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There are, literally, only 3 reasons why Lowe tweeted:                1. He frequently wets the bed, even when napping.             2. Low Testosterone around zero %.                                      3. His testicles have gone missing &amp; are in someone's purse.

But I don't support giving special funds to only ONE race in America like that. Unless it is stated as "reparations" then it's discrimination against every other race.
1311589574657933312 2020-10-01 16:51:37 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ReadyFighterOne @Achilles777777 There was also a tweet reply asking what if your Black family came after 1865, are they going to be left out? hahahahaha what a fucking mess! Going to have people that aren't even descended slaves wanting a piece of the pie.
1311588301397274624 2020-10-01 16:46:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Achilles777777 What if a White family has had a member murdered recently because of Black on White crime and then making that family who never owned slaves pay reparations to Blacks that have never been slaves. Ouch...that's going to hurt!

The largest transfer of wealth I have ever seen to ONE specified race of people in span of a few months. The entire thing is bank-rolled not to mention the funding by Soros &amp; other Jewish orgs.
1311285990699552769 2020-09-30 20:45:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Jack46562503 No, you are wrong. You think China would still be Chinese culture if it was 90% African and 10% Chinese.
1311285513018580992 2020-09-30 20:43:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Jack46562503 Okay, fine. But it's best to end this conversation now. I find no value in it. Have a good day wherever you are at.
1311284677328728064 2020-09-30 20:40:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> No, only White European nations are targeted for mass immigration.
1311283648369438722 2020-09-30 20:35:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You talked about American exceptionalism. America superiority. It was in one of your tweets. You don't think Americans should take pride in their own country. Don't ever come here, stay away from America &amp; stay the fuck out of our business. Thanks!
1311282781725560840 2020-09-30 20:32:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You don't even live in America. You don't know the personal stories of people that had their business burned down. Please leave my twitter. This tweet of yours is repulsive!
1311282229386059776 2020-09-30 20:30:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are the one with accusations claiming the Proud Boys are fascist. I haven't called anyone in this conversation fascist. You are the one that has been trying to attach "labels" to justify your dislike of the PB's. I don't even know the PB's.
1311281179056836608 2020-09-30 20:26:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Jack46562503 @NoGuiltStoic LOL the only thing unrealistic is your response Sir!
1311280667527974923 2020-09-30 20:24:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Jack46562503 @NoGuiltStoic I agree you have been civil and better at that than others. However, you aren't even an American and that makes everything you think and say about my country non-credible. It also makes me less interested in your opinions because you aren't my fellow country-man.

Would China be Chinese if they allowed Africa migrants to inhabit their country and cities at 90% African and 10% Chinese? No, African culture would dominate and replace the Chinese culture. You have to be discriminating about choices.  I laugh at "neutral"

Before you say Islam is a religion, not a culture....it does direct their beliefs, behaviors, and yes their culture. To say that is "neutral" is laughable!

What was the founders culture? You are saying their ethnic backgrounds didn't influence their culture? Are you saying the Quakers in early America was a mixture of mestizo and chinese? LOL
1311269772542255105 2020-09-30 19:40:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Shut up. I am not even going to talk with you. Your tweet is low intelligence. Good bye.

If they were they we wouldn't have anything such as Mexican culture, Japanese culture, etc.. They are distinct from each other. Stop your bullshit. If you don't like America and Americans just say so, stop with the garbage takes. It's annoying.
1311268958876598272 2020-09-30 19:37:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Jack46562503 @NoGuiltStoic But you are able to go to those other continents and enjoy their culture right? Because they preserve their cultures as a cohesive ethnic majority right? So you are saying that Americans can't be proud of their culture nor preserve it because that is fascist. You are a hypocrite.
1311266275298021376 2020-09-30 19:26:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Jack46562503 @NoGuiltStoic So you think China's culture is better than European culture? Or you think Saudi Arabia's culture is better than European culture? Do you think Mexican culture is better than Australia's culture? Do you think all culture's are the same and equal?

1311255266369974274 2020-09-30 18:43:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoGuiltStoic @rochellepigman I just get this feeling that it's all excuses made up just to punch White European Americans. To be honest.
1311254609625837568 2020-09-30 18:40:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> How are the Proud Boys fascist?
1311254417933570053 2020-09-30 18:39:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Well how come more White unarmed people are shot by police than Black people but there is only what you call "civil disobedience" for Blacks? I mean shouldn't you riot for who is shot more?
1311253369957355520 2020-09-30 18:35:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoGuiltStoic @rochellepigman Sounds like Herbert Marcuse might be a Bolshevik? All the signs are there!
1311248395269558278 2020-09-30 18:15:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoGuiltStoic @rochellepigman Bolshevism is Marxist political thought &amp; political regime associated with formation of rigidly centralized,cohesive &amp;disciplined party of social revolution,focused on overthrowing the existing capitalist state system,seizing power establishing  "dictatorship of the proletariat".
1311247239638126596 2020-09-30 18:11:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LMAO so you are saying the right to bear arms since the founding of our nation is fascist? You folks crack me up, but you are scary too in how your mind is so warped!

1311234175031279618 2020-09-30 17:19:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If you believe in self-defense, according to radical media and their indoctrinated cult you are a "nazi"  "White Supremacist". So be sure to let Antifa beat you over the head with a bat, crush your skull, and turn you into a vegetable mental state to prove you aren't racist! LOL

1311224805555830785 2020-09-30 16:42:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The tribe at New York Crimes comes out swinging to defend their tribe member. I sadly am not shocked!

I'm not saying anything about whether it was good or bad. Just showing media hypocrisy. NO ONE has had to sign ANYTHING condemning ANTIFA or BLM violence this year!
1311219191903645697 2020-09-30 16:19:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> BLM and Antifa violence for an entire year in 2020 and democrat operative Chris Wallace "muh Proud boys".
1311217422045765633 2020-09-30 16:12:49 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @OneVoiceUS @JDiamond1 I saw the videos, I saw the tweets, I saw the MOB that was unleashed on those people that day. But media holds the narrative and power and they do what they always do, protect and defend the radical left!
1311216321149972480 2020-09-30 16:08:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @OneVoiceUS @JDiamond1 AGREE and I am not saying that I supported Trump signing that. It was pushed by the radical Congress and they didn't even condemn ANY of the violence on the left. I'm just saying that he already condemned White Supremacy, but they keep re-hashing it.
1311215751609679872 2020-09-30 16:06:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> "lawmakers" we are not a serious country.
1311214512738103298 2020-09-30 16:01:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Joe Biden not only wants to lockdown the entire nation if he is elected, he will allow the radical left to put us all in work camps. This is not a sarcastic tweet. These people absolutely HATE us.
1311213209165201408 2020-09-30 15:56:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @OneVoiceUS @JDiamond1 Yeah, media hacks like to pretend to forget he did this in 2017. It's done and they need to stop their bullshit harassing him for something he has already done.
1311212653730246658 2020-09-30 15:53:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Achilles777777 Yep and they NEVER ever fucking hound Democrats to condemn ANY of the violence I am so sick of it. I can't wait for the full climax decline and replace of media.

1309986944785547264 2020-09-27 06:43:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> They don't track it because it means replacing every single White European in their nations &amp; it's a scam and is discrimination against anyone with White skin.
1309986062060658688 2020-09-27 06:39:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @DarrenJBeattie She has "race scholar" in her bio. What in the hell is a "race scholar"? Maybe means anti-White! Of course she defends fake history, it's about as fake as her!

1309220199632195585 2020-09-25 03:56:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The past 4 years I've been politically active on twitter, I always noticed a saying that I would see sometimes pop up in my feed..."Never forget / forgive what they have taken from us". Every day, this makes more and more sense to me.  We are not allowed to have anything good.

1309217795431899137 2020-09-25 03:47:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember when America was filled with a majority of GOOD hearted people! Of course we had some bad seeds, but nothing like what is happening today.
1309216032737951746 2020-09-25 03:40:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We are dealing with some of the worse people and most evil people known to human kind. They are not good people folks!
1309214796886274051 2020-09-25 03:35:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Reminder that none of this has been organic in it's roots. From mass rapid immigration, opioid drug, male suicide, feminizing males, targeted indoctrination, child gender confusion &amp; sexualizing children, anti-White hate, Color Revolution, etc., it is all by design &amp; intentional.
1309212010081644544 2020-09-25 03:24:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> They want you to consume, splurge on yourself, NOT think about the nation and the type of people America will be in the future. They get angry when they see pictures and White American families. They want you to die and wipe yourself out while they breed in unsustainable numbers!
1309210897899020289 2020-09-25 03:19:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't have children, but my brother does and I look at them as my own. Having children changes everything. I now look into the future,  what obstacles they will have in their life, such as Anti-Whites. This is why they want us 2 B childless, selfish, only think of ourselves.

1309058320444121088 2020-09-24 17:13:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> These anti-Whites are way too fucking comfortable in teaching classes like this. White Americans have been way too polite.
1309055729077190656 2020-09-24 17:03:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> "Abolish Whiteness" is attack on European Americans. There are college classes and corporate training sessions called "Abolish Whiteness". Let me put it this way "Abolish Blackness" "Abolish Native Americaness"....it wouldn't be allowed! It's a racial attack, STOP IT NOW!
1309051991889530881 2020-09-24 16:48:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @lunastargazer1 @Zioinfiltration I hope so!
1309051847496413184 2020-09-24 16:47:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> P.S. if you taze me because I am outside and NOT wearing a mask, I will sue you! For one, you don't know if someone has a medical condition &amp; can't breathe through those masks, 2ndly that is a fucked up thing to do to someone in the first place! What America is this?
1309048519085432832 2020-09-24 16:34:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If you had told me 20 years ago that this would be happening, I wouldn't believe you and would laugh in your face. What is happening this year is not America. It is something very ugly and sinister.
1309046701446098945 2020-09-24 16:27:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I can't believe that in my Nation riots, harassing diners, burning down businesses, shootings, looting, domestic terrorism has been allowed for nearly an entire year straight!

1309040293786914820 2020-09-24 16:01:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts @Kyzak9 Shucks, thank you Richard!!!!!!
1309040174597369858 2020-09-24 16:01:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ReactionaryIan I know....it's VERY FRUSTRATING and it takes every ounce of me to not boil over!
1309039541022580738 2020-09-24 15:58:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Kyzak9 😊
1309038410338836482 2020-09-24 15:54:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Kyzak9 Thank you kindly!!!!! :)
1309036791383687176 2020-09-24 15:47:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Nick is an example of harsh reality that needs to be faced up to by White Americans that have welcomed these people into our homeland. Some, like Nick, will need to be sent back. Nick's way is dividing up power among tribes that came post "65". My way is deport Nick.
1309034654490669056 2020-09-24 15:39:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Wolfengang1 I know the feeling friend......I KNOW!!!!!
1309033634939179008 2020-09-24 15:35:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Here is his best tweet as paper citizen in a nation his ancestors didn't establish. He talks about power and equal treatment, yet somehow he was able to migrate to America, has a blue check, given the same rights as me, and able to openly bitch about America's past &amp; White people
1309032756190511105 2020-09-24 15:31:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Another thankful and grateful legal paper citizen that has come to America to lecture us about our history &amp; thinks White people should hand over all their assets, government positions, etc. to what he calls "people of color". Just yay!
1309030364015452162 2020-09-24 15:22:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is an awful and mis-leading tweet. It has been proven that people such as Susan Rosenberg, George Soros, even support from Communist China party is behind the funding &amp; organizing led by proud lesbian Black women leaders. To pin this on White men is absurd &amp; atrocious!
1309027733113053186 2020-09-24 15:11:46 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Like I said....the LARGEST transfer of wealth I have EVER seen just for one race of people has happened this year. These Corporations want middle class and lower class White people, who pay taxes to go broke &amp; die.
1309021519146819587 2020-09-24 14:47:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> No wonder they didn't want you outside in the sunshine and under lockdowns! Our ruling class hates us! Media hates us!
1309020348348760064 2020-09-24 14:42:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LMAO this dude is still trying the ol' Russian bot trick of 2016.
1309010980618338311 2020-09-24 14:05:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL hahahahahahahaha

1309008433346220039 2020-09-24 13:55:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Wolfengang1 @USATODAY OMG Wolfengang, LOL hahahahaha
1309008135139586049 2020-09-24 13:53:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @USATODAY Gross! Imagine the sexual harassment and groping they probably get from NFL and NBA players. Why doesn't the majority black NFL (70-75% black) want young White female blondes on their flights instead of Black women? Are they racist against their Black womenz?
1309006082388496385 2020-09-24 13:45:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @ReactionaryIan The only time I enjoyed the mention of "Joe Walsh" was at my caucus this year when nobody knew who the hell he even was, LMAOOOOOO
1309003845167714305 2020-09-24 13:36:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Castrated and limping along......that sums up Joe Walsh.
1309002194579083265 2020-09-24 13:30:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @seraphim2311 So much disinformation has caused so much distrust. The paranoia is real. But I don't think Trump was part of their plan. She was supposed to win. That is how I bring myself back to reality :)
1309001590486052864 2020-09-24 13:27:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @seraphim2311 You aren't alone! I have even moved further and harder right than I shock myself, LOL haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahaha I really think we are feeling what is a normal reaction to this chaos in our nation.
1309001284163440640 2020-09-24 13:26:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @seraphim2311 I agree, I don't know what it's going to be called, but something will and has to be done as a reaction to this. This cannot continue and be sustained.
1309000327497216000 2020-09-24 13:22:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @seraphim2311 I really don't know what it is, LOL I have never studied it. My tweet was sarcasm. :)
1308996682173026306 2020-09-24 13:08:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RoninFL92761543 @Costco LMAO
1308994297904205826 2020-09-24 12:58:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> However, it does appear that he shit himself. Yes, these people rule over us and we pay them! LOL
1308993243019960320 2020-09-24 12:54:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Helping Eisen and his minions in this "color revolution" and the impeachment that is all for a coup to overthrow our President is very tiring for blubber man Nadler! He could be "faking" to get a lighter sentence in the future, like Weinstein tried doing, LOL

1308978666903400449 2020-09-24 11:56:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Reminder....the city settled and gave millions of dollars to Taylor's family, EVEN though there is no charges now. Yet two cops got shot at and there are protests. It is NEVER enough for those who "hate".
1308975730768965632 2020-09-24 11:45:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> How does Iran, Saudi, Turkey, China, Africa, etc.. feel about this anti-racist world? In America, non-white's (the global majority) is given the same rights as me, but MORE than any White man. Also, fix your neck, it's way too long!
1308970996372779008 2020-09-24 11:26:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @RacistClip 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1308966588217987074 2020-09-24 11:08:48 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @apolitical367 "May I get a crumb of political advocacy and representation, Sir?"
1308965935852793857 2020-09-24 11:06:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Really? That is what fascism looks like.....hmmmm I might have to consider this "fascism" thing then? You are telling me fascism = Law and Order ?
1308962998573314050 2020-09-24 10:54:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Weird....Black Lives Matter received billions of donations from Corporations this year, one of the largest transfer of wealth I have ever seen to one race alone. Anyhow, the posts and the timeline of CBS twitter feed this year has been nothing but anti-White hate.
1308958187589120000 2020-09-24 10:35:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CrassusT hahahahaha thanks friend, I accept "YES" hahahaha :)
1308944333765308423 2020-09-24 09:40:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PunishedSturges 9 Black families bought land in Georgia to build an all Black city / town. They support each other. We should support those that are brave enough to start organizations for European Americans. I'm disappointed in the lack of support right now.
1308943885599756289 2020-09-24 09:38:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PunishedSturges Why does this White man have less than 500 followers? What a disgrace that is. Are we not looking towards the future of what anti-White America in 2040 will be like? Why are we not supporting his idea and encouraging him in a hostile time?
1308938596666269698 2020-09-24 09:17:35 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Costco is oppressing Palmento Cheese founder by removing it's product because he does not support BLM. This is really crossing freedom of Political association / beliefs. What other "goods" have they removed because of this? Very dangerous for them to get involved like that.

1308933448091013123 2020-09-24 08:57:07 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Revive "Main Street". Costco, Walmart, and Amazon should not be deciding our nation's political and religious beliefs by removing goods from their shelves if they don't subscribe to supporting globo-homo or terrorist organizations, Antifa &amp; BLM. #MonopolyRule

1308925551076347905 2020-09-24 08:25:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I didn't get anything I wanted except for participating in my brother's children's future. I guess one win is better than none!

1308919793504878594 2020-09-24 08:02:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I am really tired of the limp dick media trying to make Markle a thing of power and importance in America. We don't care! Move on already for crying out loud.

Yet here I am on twitter for 4 years now supporting my President and fighting the rising anti-White hate &amp; Color Revolution.
1308895400980553729 2020-09-24 06:25:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @FFBond4_USA Thank YOU!!!!!!
1308891500726583297 2020-09-24 06:10:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I used to think it was funny how obvious it was that FBI and DHS were so anti-White and making this claims while Black on White crime is high &amp; we say the burning of our cities for almost a year. But now it pisses me off. It's insulting they think we are this stupid!
1308888954276589573 2020-09-24 06:00:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Imagine being called names like "racist" stopping you from pointing out concern that our nation has changed &amp; if you are White they want to you dead, broke, and to torture your kids as minorities in the nation our ancestors built. They want you to be a silent minority. #NoThanks

I got pissed when I saw him and his new girlfriend went to Chicago to the same piano bar that him and I did when we were dating, LOL I can survive without Facebook for sure, twitter no!
1305947222832488453 2020-09-16 03:10:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @pinochetbelle I was not allowed to post ANYTHING about him on my facebook either. LOL When his siblings would, he would get pissed at them! He hated social media.
1305945855573340170 2020-09-16 03:05:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @pinochetbelle LMAO hahahahaha that is my ex! He had ZERO social media.
1305915671113588737 2020-09-16 01:05:33 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @kepola58 Fact check = TRUE!!!!
1305769286493970432 2020-09-15 15:23:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Wow! Wish I could speak in the same amazement tones looking at Detroit today :(
1305766165101203456 2020-09-15 15:11:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Washington? I think it is pass time to stop this shit. If the name "Washington" offends you, then you shouldn't even be here!
1305765222154731521 2020-09-15 15:07:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BreitbartNews LOL
1305748033083240448 2020-09-15 13:59:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL the things our media come up with always resorts back to "Nazi" or "White Supremacists". So stupid.
1305726150820462592 2020-09-15 12:32:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PK_Tech_Vermin All he does is tweet about ending the Electoral college. I'm so sick of him. Comes to my country and tweets about going to popular vote. FUCK him! Another ungrateful paper citizen!
1305714178854969344 2020-09-15 11:44:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I don't know what you are talking about.

1305673780719759360 2020-09-15 09:04:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> The year 2020, when you open your wallet and health masks fall out instead of cash bills.
1305598937173295105 2020-09-15 04:06:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Done with my Monday thoughts for now. Got to run some errands. Be back later.
1305598768688041985 2020-09-15 04:06:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You used to send your children off to college after high school graduation to become intelligent, respectable, and great contributors to society. Now they come out of college un-recognizable and radicalized against their nation and it's people.
1305595982529396742 2020-09-15 03:55:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Dangit!!!! *you're

1305595233095352322 2020-09-15 03:52:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> "Oh...your white...and fought for our nation, probably have PTSD from what you've seen? Well just take a seat....right now we have to remove a WWII mural in Rhode Island because there is too many White people in it and it makes anti-Whites uncomfortable"
1305594077396729857 2020-09-15 03:47:39 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TQDHausfrau Thank you my friend!!!! I am having a Monday rant, LOL
1305592940329304065 2020-09-15 03:43:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoMoreBroWars I hate the Obama "changed America". I was born in the 70's. America was still filled with "good" then.
1305592251029086209 2020-09-15 03:40:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Let's get back to when "temporary" actually MEANT "Temporary" !!!!!!! 20 freaking years, deport them NOW.
1305591651155480578 2020-09-15 03:38:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. We deserve this White Pill after the yucky year we have had with lockdowns and riots!
1305589946695258116 2020-09-15 03:31:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Birthright citizenship never meant crossing a border illegally and squatting out a baby! You will NEVER convince me that the Founders meant that as "birthright". GTFO of here with that bullshit!
1305588642744860685 2020-09-15 03:26:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If you were born in America but both of your parent's are illegals, I do not consider you a legitimate American citizen.
1305586474214133760 2020-09-15 03:17:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> White children growing up, like myself, had to meet the standards to pass each grade in school. If you didn't, you were held back to re-do that grade over again the next year. Now we have 8th graders that don't even know how to freaking READ or speak English. WTF!!!
1305585681062858753 2020-09-15 03:14:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I can't stand manipulative society that has taken advantage of our ability to "empathize". These are EVIL people with ZERO morals.
1305582423594459136 2020-09-15 03:01:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What is the point of studying and working hard to get into a college like Harvard, when someone can have a 2.0 GPA &amp; doesn't even have to pass basic criteria, exams, gets admission right away because they are the "preferred" skin color? How is this strengthening a nation?
1305581013641441280 2020-09-15 02:55:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh you can't compete with White Europeans and Asians? No worries, we will get rid of SAT's and GPO's. We can't raise standards around here, but we can lower them, LOL CLOWN COUNTRY.
1305578075699269636 2020-09-15 02:44:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Any White South African family that wants to come to America should be top priority and the top refugee candidate for our nation. I mean we have let them import American hating, White hating non-White, Islam supporters into our country by the 100K's, since 1980. WTF!!!!
1305574088149262336 2020-09-15 02:28:13 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Your movement isn't looking so good when you are protesting on behalf of someone who likes to stab people and has a criminal record to prove it. So tired of this shit. A serious country would shut that shit down straight away.
1305570866219159552 2020-09-15 02:15:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Every single urbanite &amp; city dweller knows what the "bad neighborhood" is and where it is located in their cities. They avoid driving through it and walking through it, but call everyone "racist" if speak out about it and why it's dangerous. LOL such hypocrites.
1305569546422620160 2020-09-15 02:10:10 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Reminder that in America some people aren't even allowed to show support for the President of the United States or they will lose their freedoms &amp; job. This is NOT the same nation I grew up in &amp; I want it back.
1305566712931254275 2020-09-15 01:58:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Way too many people in America are incapable of expressing gratitude and respect of others. The current state of society behavior, especially on college campuses, is disgusting. We need to return to discipline and honor.
1305564993824403457 2020-09-15 01:52:05 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nwopuppet America wouldn't even EXIST if it weren't for White European men. To oppress a race to benefit foreigners &amp; paper citizens in the nation they created is fucking clown world and I am sick of it.
1305564134109581312 2020-09-15 01:48:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @nwopuppet What this government has done to White men whose ancestors created that fucking government, is an atrocity.
1305556543660752896 2020-09-15 01:18:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Apparently "equality" according to our elites &amp; non-Whites means: Civil rights for non-Whites, no civil rights for White people.

1304586496444436483 2020-09-12 09:03:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL you are okay with violence and the fact that more people die of Black on White crime because it doesn't fit your narrative of "I hate White people for something 200 years ago, and they also were the first to END slavery in the world, those fucking bigots" FUCK off.
1304584664376578049 2020-09-12 08:56:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> ...and your people do this TODAY in 2020.  https://t.co/iFSXrdhPL5
1304535560426487808 2020-09-12 05:41:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I have my brother's kids tonight and my niece says to me "saying no, no, no, no is not the polite way and is a bad idea! saying no thank you is a better way and a good idea" She is 6 years old :) Anyhow, be back later, gotta get quality family time now :)
1304516182687592448 2020-09-12 04:24:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> 16.4 million watched this garbage? Come on.....let it go folks! Once it's gone, we can build something back again with ZERO politics.
1304505747947036672 2020-09-12 03:43:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vanhandling Well I would have appreciated your support instead of pointing out flaws in my rebuttal to the enemy. Anyhow, no matter. Have a great day.
1304504611701743617 2020-09-12 03:38:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vanhandling Well we are either together, or we are on opposite sides. There is no in-between. That is all.
1304504290904596487 2020-09-12 03:37:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vanhandling The Axis of what? I am defending White people and trying to raise awareness of Anti-White hate. What is your purpose?
1304503799034400775 2020-09-12 03:35:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vanhandling Whose side are you on? Why are you defending the enemy that came on my feed and spout nothing but lies and called me and Kaitlin names? Weird....
1304503377930452993 2020-09-12 03:33:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vanhandling Yes, but the point is...they brought up the holocaust because I was defending Kaitlin Bennett for being attacked on a college campus. Completely off topic and trying to change the subject matter.
1304501718202429440 2020-09-12 03:27:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @vanhandling No, but Americans were on the ships weren't they?
1304500338427416578 2020-09-12 03:21:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts @slawandspan I had to block that fucking imbecile. Making the attack that happened on Kaitlin Bennett about the fucking Holocaust. UNFUCKING BELIEVABLE. These people are unbearable!
1304499297837342723 2020-09-12 03:17:23 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> That was an attack on fucking AMERICANS. You are really pushing hard to be relevant in this discussion. FUCK OFF.
1304497753557479425 2020-09-12 03:11:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm not a White supremacist you garbage can! But any White person that doesn't agree with you tyrants you like to call names. It's fucking childish and stupid as fuck and it's getting really fucking old.
1304497291340939266 2020-09-12 03:09:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are disgusting. 9/11 happened ON AMERICAN SOIL. The holocaust didn't happen here in America.
1304495927529549824 2020-09-12 03:04:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> That is still a recent event in this fucking century! Not fucking 1940's. You are UNBELIEVABLE and it's time for you to get the fuck off my twitter feed.
1304494492163112961 2020-09-12 02:58:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Also if the Holocaust isn't up for debate, why in the FUCK is it constantly brought up in fucking 2020? I agree, it's time to let that fucking debate rest in fucking peace. It's an insult to call Americans "Nazi's" when our Great Grandfather's fought in the fucking war.
1304494024653508609 2020-09-12 02:56:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You are the one that brought up the fucking Holocaust. I didn't because it's fucking 2020 and I am tired of you all using it to twist and bend folks to your will. My Great Grandfather fought in WWII. Now in Rhode Island, they want to remove a mural because too many white folks!
1304493333847379976 2020-09-12 02:53:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bervonrechts Thank you. I am just worried for my brother's kids and how they are going to be treated in their own nation.
1304492823471894531 2020-09-12 02:51:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @BelEsm127 Yes, but I get tired of the stolen land bullshit. So I like to use that to show them.
1304492472597450753 2020-09-12 02:50:16 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PandoraSpox1 LMAO what a weasel!!!!
1304491356048498690 2020-09-12 02:45:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh and so do you condemn Mexico for having a majority of Mexicans in their government? Do you condemn Africa because they have a majority of Africans? What about China? No, you only bitch about European nations. We are the only one's forced to hand power over to foreign born.  https://t.co/h8ImRYQeGs
1304490890342391809 2020-09-12 02:43:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You have absolutely no idea what is going on. WE have an occupied government and it's not by White Americans that love their country. One of the departments is filled with foreign born employees!  https://t.co/h8ImRYQeGs
1304490214245662720 2020-09-12 02:41:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> You never answered my question. If Black Lives Matter movement didn't believe in the holocaust, what then? Would you deny all of them basic civil rights like free speech?
1304487985501671426 2020-09-12 02:32:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Nice anti-White hate you got there, but I am not impressed!
1304487594504392704 2020-09-12 02:30:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Stay in your lane idiot! Europeans were here first.  https://t.co/uhqP66T3aQ
1304487190416809984 2020-09-12 02:29:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Never heard Kaitlin Bennett deny the Holocaust. If she did, so what? What the fuck does that have to do with how people behave towards White folks on college campus? If a Black person denied the Holocaust, but was on campus saying black lives matter and was attacked what then?
1304486102154317824 2020-09-12 02:24:57 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Stop worrying about your White kids being a minority and that every day non-Whites talk about revenge and what they are going to do to them! Screw off dude. My worries are legit.

1304195433821097985 2020-09-11 07:09:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @LoSmitty Definitely anti-White, Anti-American Communists are part of "the plague".

1304188363583434755 2020-09-11 06:41:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Defending Kaitlin Bennett I got called a "colonizer", threats that I will soon be a minority in my own nation. We have a problem, people are taught to hate White people. What can't be reversed, will need to be removed from our nation. Our kids don't deserve this treatment coming!
1304187314042736641 2020-09-11 06:37:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Sensiblesmurf Yes and also calling a White American a "colonizer" is anti-White hate and is also Anti-America hate!
1304186689397633025 2020-09-11 06:35:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> What do you think could happen in two decades? This story hasn't been written yet. Many outcomes, many possibilities. The more you people show your future plans for White's in America, the more White people wake up. Thank YOU for that!
1304185266412847105 2020-09-11 06:29:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Hmmm...there is at least 180 million White people in America and it only took 300 Spartans to stand up to the Persian army. Don't under-estimate us. But thanks for your racist opinion. You taking a victory dance before victory is fucking adorable!

1304171914911535104 2020-09-11 05:36:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Mainstream Media doesn't give a shit about physical attacks on Kaitlin Bennett because she is WHITE. If she was a black lady, it would be non stop coverage and the attackers lives would be ruined forever among death threats to their families.
1304170610592014337 2020-09-11 05:31:18 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @grumpfuk OMG.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂The unexpected tweet to come across in my feed. LOL

1304161838448496645 2020-09-11 04:56:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Probably not a coincidence a giant push for sexualizing children by Netflix being done as the largest groper of children and women Joe Biden is running for president. All things go hand in hand in clown world.

1304134872760549381 2020-09-11 03:09:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Seeing reports that Antifa members starting fires in Oregon. What empty shells of human skin get off of burning down forests &amp; causing environmental damage to nature? The media, journalists, and Democrat party are silent. Are they going to defend these arsonists? They love Antifa

1303874393404211201 2020-09-10 09:54:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I comment because Hollywood is part of the destruction happening in America and the culture wars.
1303872956976820229 2020-09-10 09:48:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @GazeWest I love the natural scent of a man, when he is my boyfriend. Some cologne's give me a headache! I like the smell of their shampoo, deodorant, and when out of a shower, something like Irish Spring soap smells GOOD.
1303871563184451594 2020-09-10 09:43:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I'm not the one to talk to anyhow. I don't support Hollywood at all. You need to talk to China and the Jewish elite of Hollywood. But I like how you have "pushes the hands", if diversity is so great it shouldn't have to be forced.
1303870874236465153 2020-09-10 09:40:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Another hoes mad :(
1303859743287640065 2020-09-10 08:56:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Joe Biden has the energy of the dead guy in "Weekend at Bernie's". He couldn't campaign as hard as Trump did in 2016.  https://t.co/jpFCU8dda2

1303576639444578305 2020-09-09 14:11:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Hey remember that time in America when they shut down small businesses causing many to go bankrupt, never to come back due to lock-down Covid, but allowed Walmart to stay open, LOL Yeah I remember too!
1303576093400629249 2020-09-09 14:08:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> That POS Crenshaw working at Anti-American ACLU really thought that Sandman shouldn't be allowed into ANY university in America. WE have got to shutdown the ACLU. It's nothing but radical leftists. Nick Sandman did NOTHING wrong. Screw those Commie's!
1303570457149542400 2020-09-09 13:46:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh nice, if POC get safe spaces, why do you have a problem with White's having one? IT is the radical left that is all for segregating again. They hate White people. Sounds like you might hate them too?

1303553588963299328 2020-09-09 12:39:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @no_silenced Instead of POC just creating their OWN show with an ORIGINAL idea, they just take classic White shows and put Black people in them. Aren't they embarrassed that they can't make something original of their own? Why copy everything from the past?
1303551891452948480 2020-09-09 12:32:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Hey remember that time in America when Billionaire Corporations donated to BLM / Antifa to terrorize Americans, burn down businesses, defund the police, and march during the so called Covid outbreak? Yeah I remember, LOL
1303547490881482753 2020-09-09 12:15:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @CollegeFix So our Great Grandfathers fought in World War II just so anti-Whites and foreigners can have their murals removed in our nation? We need to close down Universities until we can figure out what in the hell is going on.
1303540756553052161 2020-09-09 11:48:29 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Wouldn't a better solution just be making a "POC" category? But nope, just burn the whole thing down, LOL
1303539618852352005 2020-09-09 11:43:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Can't wait for Hollywood Oscars to give an award to a really shitty crappy movie that no one has even watched just because "diversity". Then folks watch the shitty crappy movie and dunk on them with bad movie reviews &amp; say what in the hell was they thinking? LOL Good times ahead.

1303505692943409157 2020-09-09 09:29:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If I EVER hear of "white privilege" or anything anti-White being taught to my 2 nephews and 2 nieces, all HELL will break loose and reign upon the enemy on my warpath. I can go from complete sweetheart to raging warrior in seconds.
1303503145792933890 2020-09-09 09:19:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Joe Biden hates the suburbs. It's all part of him and Obama's "hope and change" bullshit that transforms every inch of America into 3rd world hell holes. It's anti-white.

1303498828801339392 2020-09-09 09:01:53 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @charitystartsat Mine was Missouri Ferguson riots I seen on Television, and the removal of a Veteran's Statue memorial that had a cross on it in small town Iowa.
1303495886752841728 2020-09-09 08:50:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I have a neighbor that is still upset about Nancy Pelosi ripping up Trump's addressing the nation on national television. It's amazing to find out what sticks in the mind of the average American that radicalizes them against the Democrats. It pleases me :)
1303492991655522305 2020-09-09 08:38:41 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Reminder that Valerie Jarratt lives with Obama. This is NOT normal.
1303491118806560769 2020-09-09 08:31:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Many folks just want to get this election over with so they can re-open their states and get back to work. They all know this is a huge fraud being used as political games. They are disgusted by it.
1303490625661272064 2020-09-09 08:29:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> It is so obvious after seeing live footage of Biden that he is not capable of writing his own tweets and responses. Just like how his Presidency will be, the establishment / Obama handler's will be running things. Scam artists.

1303094695401328640 2020-09-08 06:16:00 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Reason 3,245 people hate the media. They turn a blind eye to why there are stabbings happening every day in European nations that took in 3rd world migrants and still push migrant immigration invasion is good talking points.
1302992600677392385 2020-09-07 23:30:19 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> On Labor day I am thinking of my Grandpa, who worked every day of his life since he was 16 years old, married &amp; raised 6 kids with my Grandmother but died before he even got to retire at 62 years old. I guess that is White privilege or something? #GoneButNotForgotten #MissYou
1302991448783155203 2020-09-07 23:25:44 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Look, I'm a nice person so I would remove our corrupt media very politely :) I would tell them nicely to please exit the building and don't come back ever. 😊
1302987035226107904 2020-09-07 23:08:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember in 2020 the corrupt Media is the SAME exact corrupt Media from 2016. These people have not been removed and are still up to their old tricks. There is no redemption for this crooks and liars. Trust will never be recovered. These people HATE YOU for voting Trump.
1302983512589508609 2020-09-07 22:54:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @SnowDuchess1 Why is ADL hovering over twitter, ANYTHING a White person does as sarcastic or using humor towards outrageous lies on Egyptian history?

FFS.
1302690597342453763 2020-09-07 03:30:15 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> These radical fucks can just fuck off! We don't owe anything. Everyone allowed into America benefits off what our Ancestors built.
1302687983523557376 2020-09-07 03:19:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I love how Billionaires, Jewish activists, Radical Professors, communist media talk about America paying reparations when working class Americans haven't received a raise in pay since 1970's and are living on credit. Yeah someone who makes $15 to $28 bucks an hour is 3/4th jobs.
1302686223111258113 2020-09-07 03:12:52 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PaulSmithLumber Rising cost of living and not rising wages has caused millions of Americans to have to rely on credit to get by. The system is this problem.

Yet Commie's are allowed to cut off credit card usage &amp; send mobs to our towns. Something very wrong with set up. Americans are getting tired of being held back.

1302137676821299200 2020-09-05 14:53:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Yep...just as I tweeted earlier today that the closer to the election, the enemy of the people media will be ramping up their attacks on Trump, the far right, and Trump supporters and definitely on White Americans. Even if they have to make it up with fresh bought flags and FEDS.
1302130336923615232 2020-09-05 14:23:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @thotkrimesfugg Professor at Stanford I think and of course in California. A progressive communist that supports over throwing the President. Yet his job isn't threatened at all living in his leftist utopia! Imagine openly talking about over throwing President in the 70's at a large college.

They aren't even always true in their convictions, it's just that they are hurt or angry inside &amp; must find a way to lash out at you.
1302104899967123456 2020-09-05 12:42:54 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @bloodmessenger haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa yes, she probably does! Some women LOVE to argue!

1301987817338400769 2020-09-05 04:57:40 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HideawayCabin hahaha yes and I got apples for him.
1301985675219267585 2020-09-05 04:49:09 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HideawayCabin It's been so hot here like some sort of tropical jungle I didn't get to ride! But fall is on it's way and I plan to spend some time with horse :)
1301985192740106240 2020-09-05 04:47:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So weird I had just typed up a tweet saying the Media will start ramping up their attacks on Trump, the far right, and Trump supporters and Lizard Krugman sent out a tweet doing just that, LOL  These piece of shit activist journalists are so predictable and sick.
1301984144369610752 2020-09-05 04:43:04 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @HideawayCabin BEN!!!!! I hope you are doing well my friend! It's been a long time no talk!
1301983236340494336 2020-09-05 04:39:27 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember when a guy shot up a Republican baseball game? Remember all the folks getting attacked after the RNC this year by radical left mobs? Your lies are so twisted and grotesque because you hate Americans. Delete your account you lizard!
1301982093019353088 2020-09-05 04:34:55 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PeckPolitics I get the feeling he probably sends donations to Antifa.

1301967754388484097 2020-09-05 03:37:56 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We are getting close to the election so just a heads up, remember the media (enemy of the people) will start ramping up their attacks on Trump, the far right, and all Trump supporters. Even if they have to make shit up! NEVER TRUST them.

1301359265597325313 2020-09-03 11:20:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Man....what I would give right now for a boyfriend with strong hands to give me a good neck and shoulder rub! #BenefitsofHavingaMate I have a headache.
1301355520981377025 2020-09-03 11:05:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Hell at this point just let us order direct from China and cut bastards like Bezo out of the deal. LOL Good grief. They have really messed everything up in this country.
1301354873066315776 2020-09-03 11:02:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I like how in America you get two shopping options....Walmart or Amazon! I'm told this is progress and is a good thing! Now Amazon is hiring illegals in our nation, LOL Just keeps getting better and better for the little guy, the average American ammirite? LOL #ThanksforNothing
1301354048256442368 2020-09-03 10:59:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Fuck these Elites! They do NOTHING for us! They crush small businesses and form monopolies. I lived just fine before Amazon came along, I will live just fine when it's gone!
1301352892100681730 2020-09-03 10:54:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So in New Jersey an illegal can and will be hired over an American. So there goes the Prog left's alibi that illegals don't take away American jobs. Or they do the jobs Americans won't do. ALL LIES! We must deport ALL illegals and end the obsession of illegal labor for Elites.
1301351348265463809 2020-09-03 10:48:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NeilMunroDC I still don't understand how illegals which are ILLEGALLY in our nation can now just work out in the open in a licensed career in our nation, LOL What a clusterfuck of a broken system that hurts it's OWN citizens. The end is nearing and it's not going to be good, war will happen.
1301350513091522563 2020-09-03 10:45:14 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NeilMunroDC I wonder how much under the table $$$$$$ they got striking this deal to benefit Bezos the Billionaire? A ship load of little girls and boys or briefcases filled with greenbacks? Perhaps both!

1301340391451635718 2020-09-03 10:05:01 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> LOL and they "claim" to be for the working class. What a friggin JOKE. So sick and tired of these people.
1301339034086764545 2020-09-03 09:59:38 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Oh cool..you get to publish a black list promoting your folks and FBI doesn't care! If I was on Link and promoted a white list of great white leaders I would be banned, called a supremacist &amp; interviewed by the FBI. Weird.
1301334524769587200 2020-09-03 09:41:42 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> 1800's Law example -The Tenure of Office Act of 1820, also known as the Four Years' Law, was passed on May 15, 1820 2020 Law example -California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill (SB) 239, which reduces penalties for knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV.
1301328044989218816 2020-09-03 09:15:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Five5OO You know I would if I could!

1301319261206581253 2020-09-03 08:41:03 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Just think....if we didn't have illegals...we wouldn't have this problem. But I am ALWAYS assured from the left that they aren't taking American jobs, LOL
1301318860872839170 2020-09-03 08:39:28 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @blompf2020 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1301317889341956096 2020-09-03 08:35:36 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> America has always been a nation that has said "Let's leave this place making it a better place for our children &amp; their future children" and apparently now that means do this only if you aren't White! Like what in the friggin hell? When did we stop caring about our own kids?
1301313137585590272 2020-09-03 08:16:43 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @NoahsArkworks I have also noticed that anything "temporary" proposed by the left seems to mean "permanent". Them using "temporary" as it's true meaning is so ironic.
1301312550928347138 2020-09-03 08:14:24 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @TJ109262 :(
1301305098455449607 2020-09-03 07:44:47 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Thanks for letting me share my thoughts today! It's been awhile and I know some of what I say I have repeated. So thanks for understanding!
1301304025690918917 2020-09-03 07:40:31 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Remember when Women and Men would settle down and create a life together, build their little world and they RESPECTED each other instead of competing and hating each other? Yeah....I remember that too. #TheGoodOldDays I never seen my grandparents treat each other like shit.
1301303355092938752 2020-09-03 07:37:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If someone made something better than me, doesn't make me HATE them or want to destroy them. Yet our Elites/Government have imported hostiles that HATE White Americans and want to take over the nation American Europeans created. Instead of being "grateful" they want to "take it".
1301302629763633153 2020-09-03 07:34:58 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @PeckPolitics Thank YOU my dear friend!!!!!
1301302383302115328 2020-09-03 07:33:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> I still get shocked, even though it happens on a daily basis, that it's acceptable and okay to fuck over American citizens and workers in America on behalf of illegals, foreigners, and recent paper immigrants. WTF! No healthy nation in the world does this to their own people!
1301300885444755461 2020-09-03 07:28:02 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Pinandpuller True, that is a bonus in Harvard's eyes!
1301300714954797056 2020-09-03 07:27:22 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Imagine holding back some of your BEST &amp; BRIGHEST people in their OWN nation to benefit foreigners &amp; to elevate lower test score candidates on the basis of skin color. Nothing fits "national suicide" more than affirmative action &amp; diversity policies. They call that equality, LOL
1301299147677544449 2020-09-03 07:21:08 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @MrExciitement Now the only requirement to get into Harvard is to be NOT White.

1301296722380029953 2020-09-03 07:11:30 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @Zioinfiltration Yes, many Biden supporters love little girls and not in the healthy sort of loving way, but a sexual way. It's the disgusting pedo movement that has been allowed to spread and thrive in our country thanks to Progs and Commie's.
1301296390799347716 2020-09-03 07:10:11 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> America since it's Founding, many White men have given their lives to establish a nation. Many White men have who have always been a majority in America fought in all of past &amp; current wars. Now our Government sends White men to anti-White classes &amp; training. FUCKING DISGRACE!
1301293824946339841 2020-09-03 06:59:59 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> We have really lowered the bar in America, so far down that it's scraping the ground at this point, and when you look around our nation, it shows. We have to get back to being the best of ourselves again. This means getting rid of affirmative action &amp; allowing White men to thrive
1301292963981651969 2020-09-03 06:56:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> When you read about America's Founders and early America, the intelligence and genius of these men is astounding. Then you look around at current Politicians and it's nothing but freaking embarrassment. From Maxine to Pelosi, to AOC to Omar, many more. We deserve &amp; can do better!
1301291018898280449 2020-09-03 06:48:50 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> If you are having trouble understanding what I am talking about....then just ask yourself this question.. "What would George Washington think of Brad Polumbo and would he support Brad Polumbo representing Conservative Republicans?"
1301285668006617088 2020-09-03 06:27:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Diversity is our strength for sexual assaults. Exactly what our country needed more of!
1301282892576968705 2020-09-03 06:16:32 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Can't believe that in 2020 America the Democrat candidate running for President of an entire nation does interviews from his basement &amp; we have to have a translator to even understand what the hell he is saying. Imagine this same thing being ran in the 70's. #TheDeclineofaNation
1301272487733399552 2020-09-03 05:35:12 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @2POLite_Society That would be true equality.
1301266218834423812 2020-09-03 05:10:17 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> Those that can't tell the difference are dumb AF or doing so INTENTIONALLY to welcome the replacement of American Europeans.
1301265747818229760 2020-09-03 05:08:25 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> There is a difference in what people call "immigrants". Building a civilization, establishing Government, pioneering and conquering the wilderness, mountains, surviving Indian attacks, forming trading towns, etc.. compared to "immigrants" of today reaping $$ from what was created
1301263966061170694 2020-09-03 05:01:20 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> This is FAKE as FUCK and shame on YOU for trying to shame Americans in their own damn country.  To make up such a thing so you can gain empathy about taking IT jobs away from American citizens is beyond REPULSIVE!
1301261978560851971 2020-09-03 04:53:26 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @gloomscroller @AmbitionNoble Well the FBI who is anti-American and of course the House which is ran by Anti-American Communists would label a terrorist group or White supremacy and that would scare off normies from joining and supporting. We need something that is ACCEPTABLE as the ADL, Hispanic, Black, etc.
1301261077393608706 2020-09-03 04:49:51 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> With the progressive and rapid diversity that has been forced upon America since 1965, note the most rapid mass immigration in the history of the world has happened here in our nation in the last 60 years, we should be allowed to have an American European organization. Fairness.
1301260132832219136 2020-09-03 04:46:06 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> @gloomscroller @AmbitionNoble It would never be accepted politically or by our Government. I'm talking about having a legitimate respected and acceptable organization that represents American Europeans as openly as Latino orgs, Asian, Hindu, Jewish orgs, ADL, etc.. instead of being called White Supremacy!

1301245401035608064 2020-09-03 03:47:34 +0800 <TanyaCornfield> So 600 Jewish organizations signed a letter to support BLM. 600!!!!! That isn't even possibly all Jewish orgs that reside in America. Yet we are NOT allowed to have an American European organization or Caucus in our own country. Just had to point out this hypocrisy, thank you.
