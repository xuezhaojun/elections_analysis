I’m not knocking the guy, just being real as far as him being a franchise saver. But, like all Houston fans, I will go on dreaming of a championship.
1336448514461675520 2020-12-09 07:12:10 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RooshWilliams It just goes to prove there’s too much money in the NBA
1336444955301179394 2020-12-09 06:58:01 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Itamar1710 I question whether or not two lead guards who can’t shoot 3s are going to create a feared tandem.

1328727624420634624 2020-11-17 23:52:06 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour You’re out of your mind.
1328578946246578176 2020-11-17 14:01:19 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Itamar1710 You guys would have said “let’s trade Bagwell and Biggio and blow up the Astros” after one of our playoff exits against the Braves. Going from 2nd or 3rd place to a perennial cellar dweller is not a move in the right direction.
1328574124118208512 2020-11-17 13:42:09 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Itamar1710 He wanted a lower payroll. He got it.
1328454606196781063 2020-11-17 05:47:14 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RobKSports Dude can’t shoot
1328454124803928071 2020-11-17 05:45:19 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour Has he learned to shoot, yet?

1327370563476746244 2020-11-14 05:59:38 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @JoshInnesShow It’s your destiny, dude. Give up the sports career and embark on the talk radio path. Rush is going to need a replacement. Just sayin’

1324802417142222849 2020-11-07 03:54:44 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour When you as much as fire a legendary coach and pass on another seasoned winner to hire an inexperienced newbie, I think I’ll take a wait and see position. I wish him the best. Big fan of his father.
1324795781698801664 2020-11-07 03:28:22 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @TexansPR @deshaunwatson He’s the only QB to ever achieve those records with a 1-6 record.

1323037942714114048 2020-11-02 07:03:21 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @BlackTexansGirl Maybe not, but there seem to be a dozen QBs better than the current version of Watson. I pray to God he’s just ambivalent until a real OC gets here.

1305370182903369728 2020-09-14 12:57:58 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @MettaWorld37 After he gets traded to LA.
1305370060916170752 2020-09-14 12:57:29 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @AdamSpolane You ain’t see nothing, yet. Les left Tillman with a solid system. Tillman is a megalomaniac that will destroy the team just to show he’s in charge.
1305368635666501637 2020-09-14 12:51:49 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Itamar1710 With his two rings?
1305367500528508928 2020-09-14 12:47:19 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @realTylerZed @joerogan @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Yeah, right.
1305363807804559361 2020-09-14 12:32:38 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @basketb82027024 @ShannonSharpe If you lose because of Patbev, you need a new roster.
1305363218093801477 2020-09-14 12:30:18 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @MichaelBerrySho You’re so right that it has me second guessing whether all the vitriol the Republicans have sold me over the last four years is true. I mean, every time they fight us, they win. It just couldn’t all be fixed where the Republicans have to lose every fight.
1305361668235579393 2020-09-14 12:24:08 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour Window is officially closed
1305358660286255104 2020-09-14 12:12:11 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour Yao was no scrub. Tracy, like Harden, looked disinterested at times and those times were often in the playoffs.
1305355336015060993 2020-09-14 11:58:59 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RexChapman Strange days, indeed. Most peculiar, mama.
1305282111683915784 2020-09-14 07:08:01 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @MichaelBerrySho @Danendom It’s OK. Tillman’s overpriced, corporate restaurants will still be open for your dining pleasure. That’s who the government picked to survive the crisis.
1305256378093764609 2020-09-14 05:25:45 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @JoeDeb8 @charleyw It’s freaky, isn’t it? All the things you say he is, and you may be right, all of the Democrats are that and worse. Yelling Trump is an asshole at the top of your lungs is going nowhere fast. Try selling the green new deal and defunding the cops- that’s your platform.
1305253791554568196 2020-09-14 05:15:29 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @nolimitleb @ShannonSharpe That’s all that was needed against Russ in the playoffs
1305253492144181259 2020-09-14 05:14:17 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RaviTalksSports @ShannonSharpe He can unnerve a baller, though
1305253262854180866 2020-09-14 05:13:22 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @ShannonSharpe Apparently, you don’t know Patbev’s history. It doesn’t mean he didn’t affect the game, though.
1305224749719654400 2020-09-14 03:20:04 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @BenMurphyTV @PeteRose_14 @MLB Sounds like you need to worry about that dumpster fire called the Jaguars and stop trying to be the MLB commissioner.
1305222411542056961 2020-09-14 03:10:47 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @chuckwoolery I thought you were dead. Your posts used to come up on my line all the time, then disappeared. Nice to see you again.
1305221882896097287 2020-09-14 03:08:41 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @noahsmom7 Very telling
1305219072246849536 2020-09-14 02:57:31 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @AdamJWexler And now Tillman will begin his egomaniacal dismantling and destruction of the Rockets.
1305218270555975681 2020-09-14 02:54:20 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @charleyw You know, I used to be a on-air radio guy, an ad man, and had my finger on the pulse of America. I was cool. And then one day, I wasn’t. I couldn’t believe no one thought I was with it anymore. I was old. Unfortunately, that’s what has happened to the Democrats.
1305212998919782401 2020-09-14 02:33:23 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @TheHoopCentral Who cares?
1305210746347958275 2020-09-14 02:24:26 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @TbirdTr3y_10 Almost as stupid as calling the Super Bowl The Big Game.
1305210275935682561 2020-09-14 02:22:34 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour Harden seems to have become a modern day Dominique Wilkins.
1305208763356459008 2020-09-14 02:16:33 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Kelly_Quinlan @CoachCollins As a certified genuine curmudgeon who’s lived through coaching changes from Carson to Johnson, I have to give Collins a ton of credit, as long as this wasn’t an opening game phenomenon. Keep it up, Jackets.
1305205884222615555 2020-09-14 02:05:07 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @PoliticalLM @BlackSundayTxns @dustinbennett76 75
1305204521593954304 2020-09-14 01:59:42 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @SteveKrak @EWErickson Yes, much like Megyn, who attacked Trump, thinking it was the popular move. Moved into swamp, sacrificed, now trying to climb back on the train.
1305025378696781824 2020-09-13 14:07:51 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @PoliticalLM VY
1304833069631897609 2020-09-13 01:23:41 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @AnnCoulter Who are you?
1304478003850891265 2020-09-12 01:52:46 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @TexasChance I had a Curtis Mathis set like that back in the day.
1304146265916223493 2020-09-11 03:54:34 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Itamar1710 Yeah, it’s all the NBAs fault
1303930951165251584 2020-09-10 13:38:59 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Burd__ Be what you is
1303911089642635264 2020-09-10 12:20:03 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @PoliticalLM Woolworths
1303910390187909121 2020-09-10 12:17:17 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @brithume Glad to hear the good news. You’re my favorite on Fox.
1303794312652652544 2020-09-10 04:36:02 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RamonRoblesJr I would too
1303741986831204353 2020-09-10 01:08:06 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @KenWebsterII Because they bluffed with it last election, then proceeded to do absolutely nothing about it.
1303470823974502403 2020-09-09 07:10:36 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @KenWebsterII The same way as if he didn’t have a thick accent
1303209219374579712 2020-09-08 13:51:05 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @SabrinaTM82 @paulsperry_ Maybe because they run the justice system
1303152081734230017 2020-09-08 10:04:02 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @BlackSundayTxns Don’t fall for it. Prepare for war.
1303013451359453184 2020-09-08 00:53:10 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @shesforRussy I’d rather have Durant than Russ for this series
1302846992301862913 2020-09-07 13:51:43 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @JoshInnesShow Do I believe that the NBA and Nike would prefer LA win and would do everything in their power to make that happen? Of course, what else is new?
1302846307799887873 2020-09-07 13:49:00 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @PinkValkyrie Of course, and visa versa.
1302843270482067456 2020-09-07 13:36:55 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @tadbbrown It rattled the Rockets vs the Thunder and the Lakers figure why argue with a proven formula? The only way to beat the rockets is to get em shaken, which isn’t that hard, then they start missing 3s and allowing fast breaks.
1302834541174968320 2020-09-07 13:02:14 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @BillAstros They usually do
1302485837788180480 2020-09-06 13:56:37 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @TuvesTongue Burn that hat
1302481732189466625 2020-09-06 13:40:18 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @PoliticalLM And they loved watching you squirm
1302127820936749056 2020-09-05 14:13:59 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @TodayWithJulius That’s rhetorical, right?
1302124646926561280 2020-09-05 14:01:22 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour Great game, but the series isn’t over yet
1301401652071727111 2020-09-03 14:08:27 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @Grilo_32 @MLB Uh, that would cost us how much? And you want that to come out of our profits?
1301401306779787264 2020-09-03 14:07:05 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RedNinetyFour Not a chance.
1301268142405148682 2020-09-03 05:17:56 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RyanToh11 @ChuckCallesto This is a story from 1995, right?
1300662761039564801 2020-09-01 13:12:22 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @RoundRockTim @PCreighton1 Buyers, sellers, it’s all the same, man.
1300661646864547840 2020-09-01 13:07:56 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @SeanTPendergast He’s hurt and he’s no Willis Reed when he’s hurt.
1300584511282057217 2020-09-01 08:01:25 +0800 <Benmcgiffert> @noahsmom7 Young, naive woman
