1344052165694742529 2020-12-30 06:46:22 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon The worst part for me is seeing China laughing all the way along with this while exploiting it at every opportunity. As we sit here weakening, other enemies get stronger. Libs aid and abet.
1344051511479787520 2020-12-30 06:43:46 +0800 <__i960> @ProjectAzorian7 @DarnelSugarfoo His account is basically a slow march into becoming @KFC_ES
1344051280868646912 2020-12-30 06:42:51 +0800 <__i960> “Please stop calling and telling us to do the one thing that would make you stop calling us.” They’re probably planning to dev-null it for as long as they can or until it becomes moot.
1344048270813761536 2020-12-30 06:30:53 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon Yep. In the past there was no choice, it was "go outside if you actually want to eat or make money." Now it's accepting and encouraging various paths that breed even more weakness - creating brittle outcomes that are just waiting to be broken.
1344047518636621824 2020-12-30 06:27:54 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon If you ask me, the problem today is that in general the masses lack any of kind of real courage or confidence towards just about anything. It's classic good times create weak men and weak men create bad times. We're headed quickly towards bad times, perhaps one foot in already.
1344046107253325824 2020-12-30 06:22:17 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon Yep. Imagine if this were 20 years ago before ultra-widespread use of the internet for everything. Everyone would be forced to leave their homes to go to work or get essentials. tHe HoRrOr!
1344040660555374596 2020-12-30 06:00:39 +0800 <__i960> Imagine how many lives are being destroyed long-term by all of this. All the jobs lost, all the businesses lost, all the relationships destroyed, all the people outright killing themselves over it. None of that magically resolves itself once covid19 is gone. It's lasting damage.
1344040164687941632 2020-12-30 05:58:40 +0800 <__i960> By no means is this saying "screw old people, they're old" it's simply pointing out the raw reality that we CANNOT save everyone, people die, there is no guarantee you'll live to 90 years old (that goes for all of us), and the trade we're making here is absolutely batshit insane.
1344039632749486080 2020-12-30 05:56:34 +0800 <__i960> We're throwing away 1000s of man-years to give the elderly a *chance* (NOT a guarantee) at another 0-10 years - and this data pretty much sucks anyway because we can't even see the cause of death, with covid vs due to covid, etc.
1344039041071599617 2020-12-30 05:54:13 +0800 <__i960> Obviously CFR/IFR goes up beyond age 60 (and that's also the case for every disease out there). My point was about restricting everyone else because of that. It's sacrificing the livelihood and sanity of the young/able to save the old/frail (57% of deaths were 80+).
1344037556858486784 2020-12-30 05:48:19 +0800 <__i960> @vaquerodepapel Not just California (BTW: there are red counties in CA where they're very much against this nonsense) but every single dem/lib/blue controlled area exhibits the same psychosis: appeal to authority and government knows best. Complete sheep.
1344037067748085762 2020-12-30 05:46:22 +0800 <__i960> SMC covid data: Aggregate cases from 0-59 years: 20183 Aggregate deaths from 0-59 years: 20 CFR of 0.0991% or 99.91% survival rate  This is *CFR* not IFR which would be even lower. Keeping restrictions on everyone in the entire county with these numbers is completely ridiculous.  https://t.co/uuteGJVGeJ

1343603006365810688 2020-12-29 01:01:34 +0800 <__i960> As usual, libs blaming the entire bullshit bill on Trump. Imagine if the bill had a line item that said it was going to close every homeless shelter in America and Trump refused to sign because of it. Would they still be clutching their pearls?

That's just the flame front coming out of the explosion. Dude there were people there saying they saw the RV and heard the announcements coming from the RV.

Look at the white mark on the bumper where a license plate is supposed to be. It's exactly the same as the surveillance shot and that isn't a stock feature.
1342941072557711361 2020-12-27 05:11:16 +0800 <__i960> @alexsalvinews Okay I think I understand why that part and the upper line look black. It's simply a hard shadow from the position of the sun that day. Here's Mar 2019 vs May 2019:  https://t.co/mKuaGqn3XN

1342939380747390976 2020-12-27 05:04:33 +0800 <__i960> @alexsalvinews BTW: This is actually the 2016 archived street view version. In order to that one you've got to move to the left part of the cul-de-sac, change the street view capture to 2016 and then move towards the driveway.
1342938336852279298 2020-12-27 05:00:24 +0800 <__i960> @alexsalvinews On the other hand, from this other angle, there's a small black square that's not in both and the top pin-strip lines aren't the same:  https://t.co/DybR4EtOzc
1342937671727947776 2020-12-27 04:57:46 +0800 <__i960> @alexsalvinews BTW: The 2007 street view looks to be a totally different make/model.
1342937124836798464 2020-12-27 04:55:35 +0800 <__i960> @alexsalvinews I believe the white mark is on top of the front plater holder which seems to be missing the front plate in both pics.

1342573747878780931 2020-12-26 04:51:39 +0800 <__i960> @das_krumel They might have parked it by the 3rd or 4th separator though. It seems quite clear to me this building was targeted.
1342573266834137088 2020-12-26 04:49:45 +0800 <__i960> @das_krumel I'm starting to think the RV wasn't parked right out in front of the official entrance but instead in front of one of the access doors as this would have likely provided more interior penetration. You can count the brick separations in the building (5th one from right):  https://t.co/Nv0O8LEoCd
1342564210862030849 2020-12-26 04:13:46 +0800 <__i960> @das_krumel @Gardengal31 Likely because of it being a suitable peering point for other providers so once it becomes established others show up as private peering is easy when in close physical proximity.
1342563263372902400 2020-12-26 04:10:00 +0800 <__i960> @mmpquinn @packetwrench @das_krumel Yep. Was just trying to make the point that they are *unlikely* to be lithium ion as that’s a natural conclusion some people may be making.
1342559498225942528 2020-12-26 03:55:02 +0800 <__i960> @whitewaterMkII @das_krumel @Jrodgers80 @Skydude22 I meant strategic in the general sense of what building to target in general and particularly what the OP was suggesting chain reaction wise with other flammable components. The people building these DCs aren’t morons though.
1342559228775464960 2020-12-26 03:53:58 +0800 <__i960> @whitewaterMkII @das_krumel @Jrodgers80 @Skydude22 Fiber is going to terminate from multiple disparate paths. It’s not going to arrive at a choke point otherwise it defeats the point of physical redundancy in addition to the fact that there’s probably runs all over the place in that area given the multiple DCs.
1342556560506032130 2020-12-26 03:43:22 +0800 <__i960> @FrankBagz @das_krumel Likely lead-acid.  https://t.co/Tvydcon7bH
1342556370340511744 2020-12-26 03:42:36 +0800 <__i960> @packetwrench @das_krumel Indeed, although probably traditional lead-acid and not lithium:  https://t.co/Tvydcon7bH

1342551168627589120 2020-12-26 03:21:56 +0800 <__i960> Hmmm. So an RV filled with explosives is parked outside an AT&amp;T DC in Nashville, announces on loudspeaker for everyone to evacuate, detonates, and the mayor seems completely un-phased by any of this as well? Yeah *intentional* certainly seems to be the case here.

You will see that things quite aren’t what they seem. Are hospitals strained? Yes. They’re strained during this time every year (which they fail to emphasize). Will you die in the street? No.

You’re basically upset that the president is demanding better for people under the guise of “hOldInG uP oUr hArD fOuGhT wOrK.”  Swamp, all of em.
1341594770863362049 2020-12-23 12:01:33 +0800 <__i960> @mtracey What are you smoking dude? Congress refused to come to a deal before the election. Your takes are under thought and “look what I can do” nonsense more often than not these days.

1341590920072839173 2020-12-23 11:46:15 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon Absolutely. The psychological profile in a nutshell is one of “misery loves company” amongst people who subconsciously like to be abused. Those who will not share their dysfunction are perceived as being against them and must be shamed.
1341590608192757761 2020-12-23 11:45:01 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon @abc7chriscristi Yep. Media is basically incapable of doing straight ahead news these days without trying to impart bias or emotion somehow. Those who can see it, see it.

1341585959121350656 2020-12-23 11:26:32 +0800 <__i960> “Moving forward we need to touch base and deep dive to attack the bottom line and make this bill truly next level. Let’s move the needle!”
1341584992393031680 2020-12-23 11:22:42 +0800 <__i960> This should be utterly unnecessary if there’s nothing amiss to be found. The fact that they’re so resistant to simple cooperation speaks loud and clear.   People just want the fucking truth.
1341584681502797825 2020-12-23 11:21:28 +0800 <__i960> Congress right now: “Damnit, next time we need to ensure we release the pdf of the bill (that none of us actually read) until after the vote”

But my real fear is that those who love liberty are losing the sheer numbers war against those who want to be abused and controlled. To me that’s the fundamentally more concerning issue long term. People need to be reminded of the liberty they take so much for granted.

The deck is completely stacked with corruption all the way down.

I mean take WI, a judge ruled that 200k ballots actually are questionable due to abuse of "indefinite confinement" but legal team has to *validate every one*.

We can't even get to that point because multiple sides refuse to even help.

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out what happened here.

It’s clear to anyone with a brain that they used mass mail in voting to pull off the scam. If they’d simply allow real signature verifications and audits the fraud would be found. Don’t understand why this is such a controversial thing.

1341560142622466049 2020-12-23 09:43:57 +0800 <__i960> @elwinslow Yep. To me it’s not even the amount per se it’s the source it came from changing how a person reacts to it. That’s bullshit. One can agree with something their “opposition” says if it’s a valid and well meaning point without letting political perception drive the reaction.
1341557641739309056 2020-12-23 09:34:01 +0800 <__i960> The unrestrained cognitive dissonance is simply amazing. Because Trump wants 2k he’s “buying them off” but the 600 that congress actually agreed to is somehow uncontroversial for them. Doesn’t matter what Trump does, these people hate ‘em regardless. No integrity.
1341556161695248386 2020-12-23 09:28:08 +0800 <__i960> Remember last week or so when people were like “gee sure would be a shame if Rudy died” and all that typical garbage? Haven’t even heard a peep about their covid infections since then.

After all “aMeRiCa dEpEndS oN iT”

1341232850834604032 2020-12-22 12:03:25 +0800 <__i960> For fucks sake, this is the kind of mindset destroying this country. Completely short term, NO PRINCIPLES, NO INTEGRITY, and bad for everyone except them.  If it were 100$ of relief would you stand by that same logic? It’s something right?
1341231790007054337 2020-12-22 11:59:12 +0800 <__i960> @HawleyMO This is SHORT TERM THINKING.
1341231201722351617 2020-12-22 11:56:52 +0800 <__i960> @trolltoll69420 @FemzForever @NamathJo @dwallacewells @AskeladdenTX And of course it’s some total Biden nut.
1341230649424838656 2020-12-22 11:54:40 +0800 <__i960> And the sound of acrobat PDF readers crying in unison could be heard nationwide.
1341229327015239685 2020-12-22 11:49:25 +0800 <__i960> The house and senate coming at everyone with “we’re working so hard to pass this before Xmas so you all won’t suffer any longer” is complete gaslighting nonsense. They’re working “hard” so they can ramrod 5000 pages of fine print through the process and then fuck off for Xmas.
1341228359468994560 2020-12-22 11:45:34 +0800 <__i960> As a result of this lack of respect they blame US for their own ineptitude. They do this because enough people accept being told that they’re the problem because it’s a dysfunctional relationship from the very beginning.  You serve at OUR BEHEST. Not the other way around!
1341227791551930368 2020-12-22 11:43:18 +0800 <__i960> Dem politicians do NOT RESPECT their constituents. They ABUSE their base because a significant part of that base subconsciously WANTS that abuse! The standard dem paternalistic/materialistic approach is abusive and borne out of control. They do not respect their constituents.
1341223947405119489 2020-12-22 11:28:02 +0800 <__i960> The fact that you, government, cannot respond to a “public health crisis” with any actual adult capacity to truly solve a problem is NOT A FAULT OF THE CITIZENS.
1341223753812828161 2020-12-22 11:27:16 +0800 <__i960> First off, this is a farce. There is capacity but it’s artificially clamped. Secondly, it’s the responsibility of government to respond to a crisis with emergency capacity if that’s really what’s needed. Not destroy the economy and lives because they’re INCAPABLE OF PLANNING.
1341185478477791233 2020-12-22 08:55:10 +0800 <__i960> @CurtisHouck You're mistaking people wanting the truth for "idolatry." None of the present outcome passes a common sense smell test.

1341133148701118464 2020-12-22 05:27:14 +0800 <__i960> This bill is complete fucking garbage and should be vetoed on sight. It’s an affront to everyone in the country that they’d even THINK of trying to pass this nonsense let alone do it. No 600$ is worth this.

1341054304979800064 2020-12-22 00:13:56 +0800 <__i960> @Shadow_man311 Even in FO4 which has similar mechanics and save file size issues you don’t get straight up corruption just bloatedness. My bet is they used fields in a structure that were overflowed given a high enough count of something and it’s not written/read correctly.
1341053807933833226 2020-12-22 00:11:58 +0800 <__i960> @Shadow_man311 It’s a combination of lazy programming and extremely rushed QA. I seriously wonder what they’ve been doing this whole year given the multiple delays (aside from covid), given that the game has probably atleast 4-5 years of real dev by now.

1340780517692608512 2020-12-21 06:06:00 +0800 <__i960> There never was any significant asymptomatic spread and this new strain isn’t shit. Stop falling for this crap over and over again.

1340772776920010752 2020-12-21 05:35:15 +0800 <__i960> This is not saying don’t try to win in GA but it does make me wonder if the drive to contest or not is also hedged against a win in GA.
1340772399499755520 2020-12-21 05:33:45 +0800 <__i960> I kinda wonder how a potential GA loss would affect the will of the senate to get more involved when it comes to contesting the general election. Seems like if they win in GA they’d be less inclined to do anything as they can retain power and continue doing what they do.
1340770210433753089 2020-12-21 05:25:03 +0800 <__i960> @misterbumface @ScotchStocks @nypost Ah yes because it’s completely beneficial for it to become *more* deadly, right? Everyone dead: virus wins! Oh wait.

1340505248528441344 2020-12-20 11:52:11 +0800 <__i960> @groo_wonderer @ScottAdamsSays I think you’re dead on.

1340497460070793216 2020-12-20 11:21:14 +0800 <__i960> It is NOT beneficial for a virus to evolve to a deadlier form that kills more of its hosts. It evolves to survive NOT evolves to kill its primary spreading agent: the host. The only goal is spread and survive. That is it.
1340496933899522049 2020-12-20 11:19:08 +0800 <__i960> @Zuleicht @OldKanart @BretWeinstein Will almost always evolve to be less deadly because spreading is the goal - not host death.
1340496698280329217 2020-12-20 11:18:12 +0800 <__i960> Yeah welcome to airborne respiratory viruses. They mutate. It’s what they do and have always done. JFC, NONE OF THIS IS NEW.

1340465352430350337 2020-12-20 09:13:39 +0800 <__i960> On top of that just what do we plan to do when the next one comes around? Keep doing this to ourselves? Thinking we’re somehow immune to what the planet throws at us as population continues to rise? There was NEVER a guarantee on anything. We were never OWED anything!
1340465078244544518 2020-12-20 09:12:33 +0800 <__i960> The “cure” is probably a 100-fold worse than anything the virus would have ever done on its own if left unchecked and people been allowed to take risks as they felt appropriate.
1340464396619825153 2020-12-20 09:09:51 +0800 <__i960> People are free to think what they want but in no sane world has damage from the *reaction* to covid19 been anywhere near proportionate to what the virus itself causes. This is complete fucking insanity.
1340460454716424192 2020-12-20 08:54:11 +0800 <__i960> Gee this sounds completely normal and sane.
1340456397335527424 2020-12-20 08:38:04 +0800 <__i960> @vaquerodepapel Maybe. The Sino-Russian alliance theories have some real substance imo. We shall see how things pan out when it comes to RU. I know for certain that mainland China absolutely does not have any of our best interests in mind.

1340402733011009536 2020-12-20 05:04:49 +0800 <__i960> And 7500+ people die per day in USA. Guess what: we’re all gonna die at some point and there’s not a damn thing we can do about that fact. Where were you for the ‘18-19 flu?

It continually amazes me how you guys ascribe zero agency to those who commit violent crime. “Oh they were just helpless and needed bread.” We have these things called expectations.

However, the mechanism is irrelevant because if someone says "you can have your freedom back if you take this vaccine" the correct answer is NOT "okay, I'll do it."

All evidence points to an *intentionally* miserable path chosen by TPTB.

1340364899591962629 2020-12-20 02:34:29 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader This whole thing is the biggest set of lies I've ever seen in my lifetime. There's about a 100 things we could have done differently that would have reduced the severity of this whole event a 100-fold.

1340362759435763714 2020-12-20 02:25:59 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader Which is why we must keep them inside and guarded from that deviant sunlight!
1340334192735911936 2020-12-20 00:32:28 +0800 <__i960> Ah yes, the precious Fed who’ve done so much “helping” for the last 30 years. Imagine foaming at the mouth over the separation between the haves and the have nots and then being pro Federal reserve.
1340332763736510465 2020-12-20 00:26:47 +0800 <__i960> @EventDrivenMgr No thanks. The risk of monetary terrorism and economic serfdom under a fully electronic currency is magnitudes higher than any risk from bad dudes with suitcases of cash. And yeah I do realize we’re already half way there as it is.

1340166926492868614 2020-12-19 13:27:49 +0800 <__i960> @jenneraub Well, she was tested and you weren't, right? You may have already gotten it and you simply weren't tested because it wasn't significant enough to get a test. Maybe she felt like she was getting sick and proactively got tested to confirm what she expected?
1340143827831595009 2020-12-19 11:56:01 +0800 <__i960> How about cutoff federal resources to Hollywood, PERIOD? Why should these entities be getting a single dime of our money?

In general, the whole testing thing is a mess, with no global or even national standards, and this makes comparisons harder.
1339833861660835840 2020-12-18 15:24:20 +0800 <__i960> @untulis @tiburonensis @lawyerkev @hknightsf If you look at per capita death rates, the US is by no means the global leader in the death rate, we're average. On top of that, the excess death rate right now isn't exactly mind-blowingly huge compared to previous years. It's somewhat elevated, but it isn't skyrocketing.
1339832909440589825 2020-12-18 15:20:33 +0800 <__i960> @untulis @tiburonensis @lawyerkev @hknightsf The US is the absolute leader in the sheer quantity and coverage of covid. At the risk of it sounding like a Trump talking point, no other country has tested more people than we have. At the same time, PCR Ct counts are higher than they need to be, and this drives case counts.

People are highly pissed off and this is an unsurprising, if distasteful, response. At the end of the day others *will* stand up for those who innocent and have no involvement.
1339036086354362368 2020-12-16 10:34:15 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom My point is, it's standard tribalism stuff, and not necessarily practiced by everyone in the particular political party - and right now the Chinese thing is of course heightened. Clearly American born or nationalized citizens are the least of most people's concerns.
1339035847824293888 2020-12-16 10:33:18 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom Disagree. Knee-jerk racial reactions are to be expected, even if they're not accurate or correct. You know this is way worse outside the US, right? Particularly any country with competing cultural groups, they're constantly racist towards each other.

As a society we've become much too sheltered and secure. She's been "quarantined" since March and apparently not once has asked herself "hmm, wait a sec?"
1339028379203325952 2020-12-16 10:03:38 +0800 <__i960> @samclark2225 Not to mention the completed retarded leap of "masks work" that is classic _correlation is not causation_ while summarily ignoring the fact that the other person was completely asymptomatic. These people lack any critical thinking skills when they're afraid. Straight liabilities.
1339027658634489856 2020-12-16 10:00:46 +0800 <__i960> @samclark2225 And of course she's "immuno-compromised" and "quarantined since March." Can't wait to see how these people handle a *real* crisis.

My point to the other dude was he was trying to equate a TDS-level response on the side of the right when the right just wants an actual honest examination of what the hell happened.

It’s basically appealing to the authority of the precious judicial system and discounting that they’re a very real political branch in this country.
1338964730933780482 2020-12-16 05:50:43 +0800 <__i960> @GoldPillBrown @BretWeinstein Once again. Politically biased. That doesn’t necessarily mean partisan (obviously there are cases where it does). Things are not so simple as a standard left vs right or democrat vs republican thing. This is outsider vs establishment and that’s how it’s always been.
1338964009479852032 2020-12-16 05:47:51 +0800 <__i960> @KevinTimms11 @Hot_Zee @BretWeinstein Okay so basically you’ve got nothing of actual import to debate with just standard TDS/never-trump nonsense replies.

1338959798633558017 2020-12-16 05:31:07 +0800 <__i960> @CharlieSand3rs @BretWeinstein We certainly don’t want a nation with he/him’s.
1338959294583074818 2020-12-16 05:29:07 +0800 <__i960> @KevinTimms11 @Hot_Zee @BretWeinstein Oh well in that case let’s not pursue any of it then. Man, you have zero long term thinking ability.
1338958774543896576 2020-12-16 05:27:03 +0800 <__i960> @trump_nasty @BretWeinstein Totally. Which is why I can’t stand all these lazily thought up false equivalences. They’re coping mechanisms by people who just want to avoid any conflict because by nature they’re scared of conflict, even when necessary.
1338958135193571328 2020-12-16 05:24:30 +0800 <__i960> @KevinTimms11 @cstoudt @BretWeinstein 100% false. Given real audits and investigations showing Biden was the rightful winner I would accept that. I wouldn’t be thrilled but I would certainly accept it if the procedures were actually followed. I don’t think you understand how the right actually thinks.
1338957485923684352 2020-12-16 05:21:55 +0800 <__i960> @wkcarter2341 @BretWeinstein Because Brett is the type fully willing to trade liberty for security. Accepting the results even if completely questionable represents “safety” to him.
1338957257535418372 2020-12-16 05:21:01 +0800 <__i960> @GoldPillBrown @BretWeinstein No that isn’t the case. The right wants investigation and their day in court. They’re being denied that by the courts because the courts are politically biased. This isn’t “not my president” TDS-ism and I wish you folks would understand this.
1338956554406522880 2020-12-16 05:18:13 +0800 <__i960> @BretWeinstein So if the system is complete garbage and uses judicial warfare and procedural games to effectively punt delving into any actual evidence then we must accept that “for the good of the nation” because “that’s the system.” ?  This is some Soviet level logic right here.
1338943315899600896 2020-12-16 04:25:37 +0800 <__i960> @baalwark He's just going out of his way to try and be a "good boy" and be vigilantly aware of not turning into what the left has become (which duh, we're all aware of that). These types are obsessed with their security blankets, even when they've seen first-hand how bad things can get.
1338942816878096384 2020-12-16 04:23:38 +0800 <__i960> Ah yes, because covid19 == polio.
1338940908524302336 2020-12-16 04:16:03 +0800 <__i960> @BretWeinstein Completely false equivalence. Stop embracing weakness out of a desire for security.
1338940637282934784 2020-12-16 04:14:58 +0800 <__i960> Here we go with those precious “norms” again, all out of a desire to feel “secure.” Might as well say eating a shit sandwich is part of “being a citizen.”
1338937847332577281 2020-12-16 04:03:53 +0800 <__i960> ICC, UN, WHO, most likely WEF as well, keep 'em comin'. All owned.

1338920822451290114 2020-12-16 02:56:14 +0800 <__i960> @RonColeman Seems kinda odd to have gotten 10 BILLION dollars and have nothing to show for it. Semi-rhetorical: where did all that money actually go?
1338910019903885312 2020-12-16 02:13:19 +0800 <__i960> Came across this comment on ZH that I feel sums up the current situation. The fundamental issue is that people feel helpless and that their ability to impact change is next to impossible.

1338877482296963078 2020-12-16 00:04:01 +0800 <__i960> @joelpollak This is John Roberts level stuff: Explicitly taking an adverse tack out of fear of being perceived as “just like them.”  You don’t have to be the equivalent of a raving TDS-style lunatic to know the entire country just got robbed wholesale and not be okay with that.

1338705013493833728 2020-12-15 12:38:41 +0800 <__i960> Ah yes, "inherit." These psychopaths helped create the crisis and are now telling you they're here to help solve it. Straight evil.
1338704138083860482 2020-12-15 12:35:13 +0800 <__i960> @keeper_cane @justin_hart All by design.
1338700191466016768 2020-12-15 12:19:32 +0800 <__i960> Health inspectors, etc. they’ll use any of their bullshit departments to force you to play along with the farce or lose your livelihood (which they’ve already just about taken away).
1338693740441964544 2020-12-15 11:53:54 +0800 <__i960> @superma81301234 @Barnes_Law You’re looking at em. Who do you think Biden and his ilk actually are?
1338693358345019393 2020-12-15 11:52:23 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero BTW, I had no idea but they remade Total Recall in 2012 starring Colin Farrell. Hollywood just keeps pumping out that original material, I see.

1338685548211232768 2020-12-15 11:21:20 +0800 <__i960> @DavidSharp84 Myself I’m critical of the game but I don’t think I’m 2.9 level critical. It’s getting review bombed as it’s nowhere near that bad. People are just pissed right now and dropping 1s and 0s in there.
1338684914372280323 2020-12-15 11:18:49 +0800 <__i960> @DavidSharp84 Well to be fair I believe you’ve oversimplified some things about CDPR *however* what you’re witnessing really is the commodification of the gaming industry as a result of Hollywood money and the such getting involved. They destroy everything in their path sooner or later.

1338649233063211008 2020-12-15 08:57:02 +0800 <__i960> "Unprecedented assault on democracy" do these fucking media clowns get tired of breathlessly rehashing this worn out empty statement? It's solely designed to advance a foregone conclusion and get you to accept the outcome they desire for you. ENEMY. OF. THE. PEOPLE.
1338648037665562626 2020-12-15 08:52:17 +0800 <__i960> Yeah, no shit: Immediately drop PCR Ct count to 25, pandemic over. Everyone enjoying their theater show with the MSM helping write the script?

1338643619356364802 2020-12-15 08:34:44 +0800 <__i960> @ConceptualJames Standard MSM psy-op in the vein of foregone conclusion/fait accompli. This is how they roll. That little detail about the electors having to be confirmed by congress and all of this making it to inauguration day unscathed? Those are just "details."
1338643099078168576 2020-12-15 08:32:40 +0800 <__i960> "I don't care because I don't visit Pornhub" that's perfectly fine, but this is the equivalent of "first they came." That pro-right/conservative site you like to visit that somehow requires monetary transfers of some sort to survive? Yeah they'll be going for that too.
1338642774132891655 2020-12-15 08:31:22 +0800 <__i960> If you look at the recent Pornhub stuff (RIP), it's a perfect example of how payment processors are weaponized. While the scenario isn't new by any means (there's been other notable cases), this will continue, and it WILL get worse. Recognize what we're heading into.

1338598263889358849 2020-12-15 05:34:30 +0800 <__i960> @MarquisDeMarche I knew these clowns were a real problem YEARS ago and we’ve given up so much since then. There’s a long list of traitors who’ve helped us get to this point too. Trump was the first guy to actually say “enough of this bullshit” and the establishments reacted predictably.
1338596491812773888 2020-12-15 05:27:28 +0800 <__i960> @MarquisDeMarche Funny, I thought the exact same thing when I read it. "This might as well be people collapsing in the street again" was my initial thought.  Trust nothing China says. Absolutely nothing.
1338595271245066240 2020-12-15 05:22:37 +0800 <__i960> Ah yes, all that "proud boy violence" during the months of May-July, WaPo. Sheesh, the media is such TRASH.
1338592751613440000 2020-12-15 05:12:36 +0800 <__i960> @DarnelSugarfoo No, it's a case of "do a shitty job, go broke." I'm sure wokeness is tied in there somehow indirectly though.
1338590580142534656 2020-12-15 05:03:58 +0800 <__i960> @RattlerGator If you're in the business of trading liberty for security, get the fuck out of the way. You do not represent the people.

Clearly that's what 95% of the cases are! Dude, when's the last time you've even been to a bar with any regularity?
1338577668925607936 2020-12-15 04:12:40 +0800 <__i960> @RattlerGator @IvanPentchoukov They'll memory-hole and suppress it as much as they can. I agree that it's important, but what matters is if anything actually *happens*.
1338577322283159552 2020-12-15 04:11:17 +0800 <__i960> Over WHAT? NYC could have been 100% open since May. Complete fucking insanity and we're going to have to either sue or fight our way out of this.
1338531670123716609 2020-12-15 01:09:53 +0800 <__i960> This is not a “2020” or “covid” created problem. This is solely a Democrat response to everything issue. NPS branches in California are simply complicit.

It’s amusing to think have rock solid 4k/60 any time soon with the continual transition to ray tracing/path tracing.

It also felt more cpu than gpu but I didn’t verify it right at the time. Still needs some optimization.

There’s no way this is one of the greatest games of all time and quite honestly I don’t have a lot of compulsion to keep playing it.

1338226270740463616 2020-12-14 04:56:20 +0800 <__i960> @DavidSharp84 Yep. This platform is chock full of dirtbag left shills and other trolls - and your point about the assumption of "good faith debate" is key. These people are Machiavellian, they have no moral code.

1338223194411417600 2020-12-14 04:44:07 +0800 <__i960> Yeah and May-July never happened. Constantly playing victim. BTW: They destroyed a sign, not an entire church (something your people would do).
1338222094648107008 2020-12-14 04:39:44 +0800 <__i960> I suggest you start now, Amy. The sooner the better.
1338221802871373825 2020-12-14 04:38:35 +0800 <__i960> @AF632 I do agree that trucks have been getting bigger (although I don't agree with what his agenda is [we all know it]). However, what's funny here is if you tack on a back seat cab to the Toyota you'll start approaching similar length. Also they should compare against modern Toyotas.

1338213701770301440 2020-12-14 04:06:23 +0800 <__i960> @GraceIPerez @ryanstruyk But the fact that 100% of Biden voters believe he's legitimate doesn't concern you at all. Simply amazing but not surprising.

1337581606408622080 2020-12-12 10:14:40 +0800 <__i960> @samanthamarika1 SCOTUS chose security over liberty here. Even the highest court in the land has zero balls to do what’s right. Any choice for SHORT TERM SECURITY equals LONG TERM PAIN.
1337579246563205120 2020-12-12 10:05:18 +0800 <__i960> So let me get this straight: blue states are basically just allowed to do whatever the hell they want within their own states and how that affects a federal election isn’t even a concern? The fact that lower courts are then weaponized against any contesting is also not a problem?
1337578699844009985 2020-12-12 10:03:07 +0800 <__i960> @willchamberlain Dude I know you think this is long term thinking but it’s actually short term. You assume some sort of magical benevolence from the other side as if it’s all going to be alright. You will see, things won’t be alright. And you will also see just what the other side wants.

1337457233114742784 2020-12-12 02:00:27 +0800 <__i960> @RattlerGator @threadreaderapp  https://t.co/NkDvYH2mzw
1337432628589256714 2020-12-12 00:22:41 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero Ah that makes sense. All places not in Chicago. :-)
1337430242269351937 2020-12-12 00:13:12 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero Where do you climb out there (outside, that is)? I thought it was quite flat.
1337429103910080513 2020-12-12 00:08:41 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero For outerwear stuff I try to stick to manufacturers making (or atleast assembling) in North America. e.g. Some of Simms stuff, some Patagonia, Westcomb (Canada). As you can imagine, the choices are not vast.
1337426942971105282 2020-12-12 00:00:06 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero I've never bought a single one of their products honestly. I have other manufacturers I buy from (for mostly fishing and camping gear).
1337426700615864320 2020-12-11 23:59:08 +0800 <__i960> @reWASDmapper @Wewru_Gaming I am almost certain said friend is asking this because of Cyberpunk 2077's garbage support of anything involving SendInput right now. So people are basically looking for workarounds.
1337418150271336449 2020-12-11 23:25:09 +0800 <__i960> Yep. But ironically they have no problem with China sourcing and using oil for the manufacture of their products. Complete virtue signaling hypocrisy.
1337277346919813126 2020-12-11 14:05:39 +0800 <__i960> @MarianRosin @Barnes_Law The decisions of said states disenfranchised their own voters. They don’t get to disenfranchise all the other states in the process either.
1337269625810083841 2020-12-11 13:34:58 +0800 <__i960> @shylockh @The_WGD I think it’s more nuanced than that but to be honest hard to explain over twitter right at the moment. I think it’s a battle between those who want to control vs those who don’t want to be controlled.

1337168730694905856 2020-12-11 06:54:03 +0800 <__i960> @RikiGuitarist They're actually completely awesome once you get the a-ha moment of how to use them. Gyro is a biggie as well. It just takes a bit of practice and inspiration from watching others who've put the time in.
1337168125532356609 2020-12-11 06:51:39 +0800 <__i960> @Theo_Chilton @mtracey AKA the twitter equivalent of "look what I can do."
1337167381932589056 2020-12-11 06:48:41 +0800 <__i960> @Theo_Chilton @mtracey He's basically just here to hear himself speak and see others react to it. It's a dopamine source for him and he seeks no real dialog with others, particularly any dialog/debate that could show him potentially in the wrong (an end of the world scenario).

1337159424113168386 2020-12-11 06:17:04 +0800 <__i960> @stillgray So are you saying I should alt-f4 my running copy of Napster?
1337157643283001345 2020-12-11 06:10:00 +0800 <__i960> @mtracey Complete BS dude. Stop trying to find a contrarian viewpoint in everything when in some cases you're just flat out wrong.
1337092697077604352 2020-12-11 01:51:55 +0800 <__i960> That everything we’ve been saying about them is basically true.

1336931181212827648 2020-12-10 15:10:07 +0800 <__i960> @CallMeTasteless Even better is if you’re a Steam Controller user and due to their totally boneheaded implementation managed to wreck both controller and KBM modes with it.  It’s 2020, why is this still an issue?
1336929378958077955 2020-12-10 15:02:57 +0800 <__i960> @cavemanO11 @jallen1315 @ReedCoverdale @tristin_rice @TulsiPress @RepGosar All that needs to happen with 230 is for it be restated to follow in the footsteps of Stratton Oakmont vs Prodigy. That is, protection can be afforded, but only if no editorializing is done. This is very much inline with common carrier style approaches.
1336892967802470400 2020-12-10 12:38:16 +0800 <__i960> @RambleTan Just wait til you actually try to play it with the steam controller and realize CDPR made some boneheaded decision to block emulated mouse input and the whole thing doesn’t work at all (not even mouse) unless in gamepad mode. FIX THIS CDPR.
1336845787175608323 2020-12-10 09:30:47 +0800 <__i960> I feel like this lady is in Cyberpunk 2077 at some point.

1336845088236826625 2020-12-10 09:28:01 +0800 <__i960> You’d think if you read books by both Hitler and Pol Pot that you’d CERTAINLY understand the type of individual who’d reduce access to books.

1336818358142943233 2020-12-10 07:41:48 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero Certainly I think we both agree that if people are gonna go at it, that perhaps a divide more similar to 30+ years ago or so would be more healthy overall. But we are here now - we don't necessarily have to like it, either.
1336818054039138304 2020-12-10 07:40:35 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero Of course it isn't, that's what i meant by "radical centrism," i.e. being so hellbent on being in the center to the exclusion of the other sides perceived as the real "radicals." What I meant by "pick a side" is that given a more and more divided people, "no side" is a luxury.
1336805601528012800 2020-12-10 06:51:06 +0800 <__i960> @bradheath @MarthaKelly3 "News to Nixon" in an election that most people agree was directly affected by outright fraud. Do you even think when you try to appear smug?
1336805031132102657 2020-12-10 06:48:50 +0800 <__i960> Presuming you were doing this (isn't this what you've been preaching?), based on your own outcome here, what difference would it make?

1336804149535502336 2020-12-10 06:45:20 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero @shipwreckedcrew Well here's the problem, we both know all of that. We also know that radical centrism isn't going to do anything. In a preferred world, it *should*, but not with the way things are going now. Nobody demands you pick a side, but if shit goes south, then I say best pick a side.
1336799591845359616 2020-12-10 06:27:13 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero @shipwreckedcrew I prefer the guy who broadcasts what he’s about rather than the guy that tries to pretend to be your friend but will sell you down the river just the same. And obviously I’m anti-wokeism.
1336799313368739840 2020-12-10 06:26:07 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero @shipwreckedcrew I mean all that “were gonna heal America” mumbo jumbo. Completely nonsense.
1336799140160876549 2020-12-10 06:25:26 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero @shipwreckedcrew Honestly in a way that’s my underlying point. However DJT never said (other than “drain the swamp” [still valid]) he was choosing a bunch of pious cabinet members whereas Biden has been broadcasting his virtue for a while now and then does the exact same thing.
1336798345784803329 2020-12-10 06:22:16 +0800 <__i960> @86FnutRCFofZW1t @Sharigirltn @bennyjohnson I couldn’t imagine what gave it away 😂
1336784534424100864 2020-12-10 05:27:23 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero @shipwreckedcrew Well he did apparently have experience with Xi already, but I'm certainly not contesting your point. However I think the real point is that Biden is just filling positions with his own personal swamp of token pols that MSM/dems like.

Nobody is looking for Trump to claim they won California, what they're looking for are battleground states where votes are quite close and nowhere near 7 million. Do you guys ever debate honestly, or is it always games?
1336148218598461441 2020-12-08 11:18:54 +0800 <__i960> @patriot_raging @tedcruz Bring it on.
1336147974636797952 2020-12-08 11:17:56 +0800 <__i960> @stevetures @tedcruz You realize that the other side’s votes count too right? You realize you’re cool simply disenfranchising them as long as your side wins, right? If the votes were counted illegally or through an illegal change of process then complain to the state not those seeking fair process.
1336119554859171842 2020-12-08 09:25:00 +0800 <__i960> Better step up your game.

1336101361423773697 2020-12-08 08:12:42 +0800 <__i960> Nah. I'm not about advancing the surveillance state, and I don't care if I happen to walk by someone who had covid because it's meaningless.
1336054255233331201 2020-12-08 05:05:31 +0800 <__i960> @ElectricAmish @ABugandaFlea @JoshAnimator @CNBC I wasn't actually arguing in the direction of more government control, I was more so making a point about how seatbelts are a false equivalence in the first place. Lotta libs like to point towards seatbelts as well.
1336045531701731328 2020-12-08 04:30:51 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom It's the friggin' left. They no longer remotely resemble your classic 60s-era liberal whatsoever and have transitioned to full blown left-wing authoritarianism and communism-style bullshit.
1336044059178061824 2020-12-08 04:25:00 +0800 <__i960> They speak to us like we're children. They command us with voodoo and then blame the result on everyone else when said voodoo yields nothing.
1336043735138725888 2020-12-08 04:23:43 +0800 <__i960> @ABugandaFlea @JoshAnimator @CNBC Thing is, 99.9% of people don't do too well with accidents at speed (&gt;55-65 mph) where a seatbelt would actually make a difference. That's not even close to the same as a vaccine or even catching covid19. The risk profile is insanely different.
1336042980919050240 2020-12-08 04:20:43 +0800 <__i960> Complete madness.

1336041771889958914 2020-12-08 04:15:55 +0800 <__i960> See, this is what the MSM is about folks: advancing an agenda and being an unofficial arm of whatever political play they want happening. True journalism would involve questioning the moral implications of this, but they dispense with any of that and provide one side only.
1336038609128812546 2020-12-08 04:03:21 +0800 <__i960> @JFNYC1 Yeah, it's so much better picking them up off the beaches as people just chuck 'em anywhere and they end up in storm drains, etc. Fucking bullshit.

It's the same deal with their "rules for me rules for thee" governors as well. Everything about the left lacks integrity. It's who they are, morally.

You can say whatever you want but this one extremely important point cannot be ignored.  You just like this “fact checking” because it fits a narrative you’ve already subscribed to.

Is that judge also admonishing poll workers when they throw out ballots with unreadable signatures?

I don't mind huge hops though.

1334740874501050368 2020-12-04 14:06:37 +0800 <__i960> @contrarian4data @Lee47590755 @paxitarchy @Cernovich Yeah.. I guess my point with these videos, and the Georgia one, is that overall there certainly seems to be a lot of "thou doth protest too much" going on from the side that claims everything went squeaky clean. My bullshit meter has been high for a while now.
1334740358903648257 2020-12-04 14:04:34 +0800 <__i960> @contrarian4data @Lee47590755 @paxitarchy @Cernovich I've been enjoying the videos @thevivafrei and @Barnes_Law have been putting out as they've been level-headed and fair on what fraud is likely vs what is tinfoil. I also find the utter lack of integrity evidenced by lower courts and various election bodies to be a morale killer.
1334736475779289088 2020-12-04 13:49:08 +0800 <__i960> @thebradfordfile BLM and Antifa are probably dusting off the umbrellas and BMX armor suits in preparation.
1334735413479493637 2020-12-04 13:44:55 +0800 <__i960> @contrarian4data @Lee47590755 @paxitarchy @Cernovich In general I'd be more inclined to side with libertarian stances on most things (with some exceptions), but I know without a doubt that election changing fraud happened in this election and the left is flat out Machiavellian enough to do it. Truth matters most to me, not my guy.

This is basically the equivalent of witch-hunting without even knowing what the whole story actually is yet. On top of that, if she *is* involved with something, it's best not to open up her identity to other forces who might not want her to speak at all.
1334695015927349248 2020-12-04 11:04:23 +0800 <__i960> @BotCordial Gotta love the little circle-jerk. Wasn't she basically calling him a rapist a year or so ago?
1334694313544978432 2020-12-04 11:01:36 +0800 <__i960> Gonna sound tinfoiley, but imagine some kind of dystopian hellscape where they mandate vaccines, subtly alter them under the radar, and then secretly unleash an _actually_ dangerous variant of covid or similar to wipe out anyone not obedient enough to take the original vaccine.
1334693583698346004 2020-12-04 10:58:42 +0800 <__i960> @USADeardorff I'll be heading to the black market, pronto.

1334585696858738690 2020-12-04 03:50:00 +0800 <__i960> This guy is author of “Wisdom of the Crowds.” Maybe he should have instead wrote “Weakness of One Individual”
1334546614845759489 2020-12-04 01:14:42 +0800 <__i960> @Beezerally @ScottAdamsSays The right is the more likely side to side with an actual real 3rd party. The left won’t breakaway because said 3rd party is likely not going to represent their interests in the first place. We can’t just blindly vote for something desired and then lose every single time.
1334546356103307264 2020-12-04 01:13:40 +0800 <__i960> @Beezerally @ScottAdamsSays I didn’t say it isn’t even possible. I said it isn’t even possible RIGHT NOW. Look, in order to even get to this point you need a populist candidate and a separate party entirely. You think the extremely loyal dems are just going to break way and go with this?
1334518641908473859 2020-12-03 23:23:33 +0800 <__i960> @Beezerally @ScottAdamsSays Agreed that that’s a much preferable place to be in. The issue is that that’s not even close to how things are today and in the long process of getting there, if ever, one needs to vote for the party that loses them the least limbs, if you will.
1334518030211014656 2020-12-03 23:21:07 +0800 <__i960> @acesaver @FightVsWokeism @DrewHolden360 @wallabychamp I agree with you there that mass wide scale or systemic fraud akin to what Powell/Wood are pursuing isn’t even remotely the winning avenue to take. It’s all the other issues in the major battleground areas that are the right thing to be pursuing. That’s where the real fraud is.

1334341114547998720 2020-12-03 11:38:07 +0800 <__i960> @amartmn @DrewHolden360 @wallabychamp He completely understands it he just feigns that’s he doesn’t. In reality it’s a bunch of hand waving meant to say “he lost, and I’m perfectly okay with that.” Most of these guys aren’t actually interested in any real dialog they just want to see themselves being “heard.”
1334339533496705026 2020-12-03 11:31:50 +0800 <__i960> @DrewHolden360 Ignore all the dominion stuff and what do we have? A bunch of fraud. Is that fraud somehow less equal to the fraud you want us all to be concerned about? Because it certainly seems that way.  We should be concerned about fraud but not so much that it allows Trump to win, right?
1334338655209496576 2020-12-03 11:28:20 +0800 <__i960> @DrewHolden360 @Rothbard1776 Great. Wisconsin. How about the other 3-4 that did nearly the exact same thing? This is just absurd that we’re going to sit here and pretend some serious shit didn’t just go down and try to write it off as “bEcAuSe pEoPlE jUsT dOnT lIkE tRuMp!”

1334330992656453633 2020-12-03 10:57:53 +0800 <__i960> @xgwakex @DrewHolden360 @wallabychamp IMO it's very simple, it's "I don't like Trump, I don't want Trump to serve another term so I'm going to look the other way and pretend a whole bunch of ridiculous stuff didn't just happen and write it off as another typical election." That lacks integrity, bigtime.
1334329918033784832 2020-12-03 10:53:37 +0800 <__i960> @DrewHolden360 @wallabychamp I feel like I'm in absolute crazy-land these days as there are completely legitimate concerns by the Trump camp on what went down in various states with election bodies resisting all introspection under the gaslit guise of "there are no problems here, just accept the results."
1334329492894932992 2020-12-03 10:51:56 +0800 <__i960> @DrewHolden360 @wallabychamp This isn't a case of "yeah there was fraud, so what? there's always fraud." This is a case of multiple battleground states doing everything in their power to help enable said fraud and a giant legal battle just to simply get them to CROSS-CHECK THE VOTES.
1334329143685652480 2020-12-03 10:50:33 +0800 <__i960> @DrewHolden360 @wallabychamp Dude, even if we flat out ignore all of the Dominion conspiracy theories, etc. we still have a huge problem: mass mail in voting with FREQUENT violations of election protocol and ignoring of checks and balances. This is *on top* of all the bizarre statistical outcomes.
1334285695767089152 2020-12-03 07:57:54 +0800 <__i960> @TRHLofficial You know what's funny is the first time I saw this a couple of days ago I read it as one of those "political compass" memes. I was like "why the lib-right so angry?"

1334284567918731264 2020-12-03 07:53:25 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 @no_silenced I cannot believe you LiTeRaLlY buy into this. The whole Russia thing might as well be peak leftist tinfoil at this point. Why even focus on it when there's 1000+ others with their dicks all up in China, an actual real threat?
1334283697655148544 2020-12-03 07:49:57 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader I just mean the whole thing of "how the fuck did we get here?" (rhetorical)

1334283167121899520 2020-12-03 07:47:51 +0800 <__i960> @Beezerally @ScottAdamsSays It's ridiculous to think Scott doesn't know that both sides are swamp-city. Look, plenty of people are aware of the garbage that exists on both sides. But saying "this all sucks, I'm not getting involved with any of it" is a losing position long-term.
1334271809454104576 2020-12-03 07:02:43 +0800 <__i960> @Jaybird95141759 @GrrlPirate @TurntableKitty @AZGOP @kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump Dude it’s 2 out of a 100. That is a HUGE margin of error.
1334242383534297088 2020-12-03 05:05:47 +0800 <__i960> Correlation between people with names like “Brooklyn” and “white” dirtbag leftists? My bet is very high.

1334241029294157825 2020-12-03 05:00:25 +0800 <__i960> Lib logic aka “anything is cool with me as long as my guy won.” Such a morally bankrupt state of affairs.
1334240718160683008 2020-12-03 04:59:10 +0800 <__i960> @brromm @AZKaren2 @AZGOP @kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump The only way to know if it’s “surprising” is more sampling. You don’t just say “oh well it could be a fluke” and leave it.

1334226921996001280 2020-12-03 04:04:21 +0800 <__i960> Hank here clearly doesn’t get it, or explicitly doesn’t want himself to.
1334226486811795456 2020-12-03 04:02:37 +0800 <__i960> @SurfOpie @tplohetski Certainly not a 50/50 balance across the two political camps. Most of the fervent lock downing has been in dem land along with most of the hypocrites.

1334208465380679680 2020-12-03 02:51:01 +0800 <__i960> @KILLSMASH @K1erry @ScottAdamsSays @StarCoreOne02 Sure, but he means if there were actual signs of fraud emanating from the republican side of things with a Trump win. Leftists would be in DC burning shit down.
1334207930132881411 2020-12-03 02:48:53 +0800 <__i960> @Beezerally @ScottAdamsSays You know, knowing that both sides are swamps ain’t exactly an original thing either? Plenty of us believe that. But do you want to be right or do you want to win?
1334206519231975424 2020-12-03 02:43:17 +0800 <__i960> @ConceptualJames Seriously. Tired of hearing about it. Attention is exactly what they want.
1334030525665660931 2020-12-02 15:03:57 +0800 <__i960> Gotta love the CNN mic... where were they when it comes to the actual underlying issue surrounding this?
1333968955342422017 2020-12-02 10:59:17 +0800 <__i960> @JackPosobiec @Project_Veritas Dude, that isn’t what they said on that call at all. Cmon man. That first one was a complete nothing burger. We know CNN is a dem propaganda arm but we cannot turn into people like stark raving mad leftists who read every trump story as if it’s some huge bombshell news.
1333962988190007297 2020-12-02 10:35:34 +0800 <__i960> I’m right/right-leaning with a healthy dose of MSM hate and even I didn’t read into that first clip the same way. The 9/11 point was just an example for  propaganda purposes not “Trump is going to cause the next 9/11!”  Hyperbolic interpretations is what the left does.
1333945829199998979 2020-12-02 09:27:23 +0800 <__i960> @Project_Veritas Most of this wasn't that much to write home about, but the "go after Lindsey Graham" part shows you they are exactly what you think they are: not journalists.
1333943542792654849 2020-12-02 09:18:18 +0800 <__i960> @TooLateBlue @RubinReport Not gonna happen. I'm from here and this is my home. :-)
1333942451447369728 2020-12-02 09:13:58 +0800 <__i960> @TooLateBlue @RubinReport What about those of us in coastal CA who are absolutely not leftists? That won't work.

1333920639946637312 2020-12-02 07:47:18 +0800 <__i960> @ZenTrends Whereby the courts tried to claim that "it's too late to pursue damages" while at the same time, if filed pre-election, never would have heard the cases because no damages had been suffered yet. The legal/judicial system isn't as clean and unbiased as we'd like to believe.
1333919942769479682 2020-12-02 07:44:32 +0800 <__i960> @ZenTrends Additionally, while I understand that you may think the legal system, especially lower courts, is supposed to be fair and balanced and hold themselves to a high level of integrity, I'm afraid that just isn't so my friend. Just look at some of the recent PA rulings ("laches")
1333919418762493952 2020-12-02 07:42:27 +0800 <__i960> @ZenTrends Honestly, just watch a few of the recent Viva Frei with Robert Barnes videos for a reasonable/pragmatic overview of everything that's involved. There *have* been judges issuing orders and doing things in response, it's not every single case being thrown out entirely.

1333825701896589315 2020-12-02 01:30:03 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 Glad we agree. Now if you're interested in signing up for an mRNA vaccine that's never before been used on humans, be my guest.

You know what bothers me about your types? You'll press forward with a short-term "victory" even though it's a long-term loss overall. That and the fact that you're willing to excuse obvious irregularities if it benefits you. No integrity.

It's laughable to anyone with even an iota of critical thinking skills that C19 just showed up on March 17, 2020 and went to town. The fact that it was relatively undetected until people began looking for it is also quite telling.

1333195099371491328 2020-11-30 07:44:15 +0800 <__i960> @realsb4feelings I have a theory that loads and loads of older but dormant twitter accounts had their passwords hacked and have been repurposed en masse. There's so many of these things that have essentially nothing about politics or Trump until either 2016 or in many cases, Oct/Nov 2020.

1331825515313807361 2020-11-26 13:02:01 +0800 <__i960> You mean your movement. I’m not part of any movement that accepts wholesale fraud as just “politics.”
1331824284998668288 2020-11-26 12:57:08 +0800 <__i960> Interesting to see how quick this dude went mask off after being terminated. Really makes you wonder what his bias was when he was still employed by our government...

1331429235840274432 2020-11-25 10:47:21 +0800 <__i960> @TradeAlerter Pretty low. There’s an entire machine against this, which is utterly sad and depressing, as they only seek to exploit the country.
1331420739895844865 2020-11-25 10:13:35 +0800 <__i960> @KyleKashuv I’m a native. It’s the east coast tenderfoot imports that I want to see leave.
1331418646908858370 2020-11-25 10:05:16 +0800 <__i960> Straight up: if Trumps wins this via the legal process, whichever route it goes, I am fully prepared for whatever comes next. If you actively want to avoid the threat of conflict, even if you know the truth is just, then you have zero integrity and do not understand America.

1330944069871177728 2020-11-24 02:39:28 +0800 <__i960> Imagine a time of the year where families can come together and celebrate the strength of family and belonging. Then imagine local governments trying to put a stop to this. What’s that tell you? That they care about your health? Absolutely not.
1330942377918300161 2020-11-24 02:32:45 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon @jurijfedorov Doing that means reducing the left’s influence to that of an ignorable yappy dog - or a giant war that separates the wheat from the chaff? I guess we could just do both at this rate.

1330928880450891777 2020-11-24 01:39:07 +0800 <__i960> As much as they’re willing to accept and it appears a large amount of them actually want this. It is our duty to deny the abused their enablement or else they’ll direct it towards us.
1330914620266057740 2020-11-24 00:42:27 +0800 <__i960> @ScottAdamsSays Probably about the same time as AP. They’re all part of the same monolith.

1330776396138905601 2020-11-23 15:33:12 +0800 <__i960> Some good discussion in this one
1330729996059492352 2020-11-23 12:28:49 +0800 <__i960> @JackPosobiec Well, I'd probably take a look around at what was on tap, wait for my drink, and then shoot the shit. Probably crap beer, but don't let this distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.

What's insane is that people have become so religiously fanatic about covid that quite a few of them sound like authoritarian pushing nut-cases.

1330572059701702656 2020-11-23 02:01:14 +0800 <__i960> So go full mask off and make all news partial and slanted? Fuck off commie.
1330364141588996097 2020-11-22 12:15:02 +0800 <__i960> @Lrihendry I don’t agree and it’s likely extremely unconstitutional.

1330022307406909444 2020-11-21 13:36:43 +0800 <__i960> @Coast__Coast @IlhanMN It's just internet slang "this ain't it, chief"... they don't know how to communicate like normal people anymore and look to the approval of their peers rather than any actual substance.

I’m not the biggest fan of the media already poisoning the well though - and I find it a bit suspect honestly.
1329991562579697665 2020-11-21 11:34:33 +0800 <__i960> @BobQuarantine @discgolfer29 @johncardillo I agree with you that they should stop with the hype. I also agree with you that if they present a nothingburger it’s going to be a complete self own.  I think our collective response in demanding proof is out of a natural desire to assert control by simply knowing more.

1329980592184647680 2020-11-21 10:50:57 +0800 <__i960> @JackPosobiec Because it’s thoughtcrime that goes against what the MSM says is truth. You know how this game goes.

1329207425157668865 2020-11-19 07:38:40 +0800 <__i960> @TradeAlerter Australia (and New Zealand) have done no crushing whatsoever. They've locked down their borders and nuked their tourism GDP (along with the remaining civil rights and hospitality industry in urban areas). Mark my words, it's just delaying the inevitable.

1328470858696777729 2020-11-17 06:51:49 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon Throw a line out. Is this east or west?
1328456627746263041 2020-11-17 05:55:16 +0800 <__i960> Because everyone knows coronavirus never hangs out at Walmart or Target. It’s obvious to anyone with 2 brain cells none of this stuff is ever consistent and not even about protecting anyone.
1328455700025020416 2020-11-17 05:51:35 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon @rhp_america It needs an “ignore all hyperbolic Nazi/Hitler/Holocaust comparisons” feature. It’s always the same shit.
1328420385705000960 2020-11-17 03:31:15 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero @RobertHarvey1 And as usual it all heads back to the Fed in some form or fashion.  I’ve said it before but there should not be any kind of bail outs for student loans. If anything it should be a bail in as the “best” case.
1328369579295293441 2020-11-17 00:09:22 +0800 <__i960> @TenNamesLater @realDonaldTrump It isn’t. Also, ahoy matey!

1328121717789655041 2020-11-16 07:44:27 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon Yep, in the sense that they finally realize the error of their ways only when the boot is directly on their neck, I get ya.

Not only are the rules of engagement different between the left and right, so are the "rules" of victory. Left has  almost no sense or ethics, honor, any of that, just pure animal level reactions.
1328119621442957314 2020-11-16 07:36:07 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon IMO, it's not that they don't get it at all. They get it and they simply don't like it. The cognitive dissonance of being pro-equity/equality of outcome but anti-electoral college/anti-senate never ceases to amaze me though. Once you hack through it's clear though: power/control.
1328100953480781824 2020-11-16 06:21:56 +0800 <__i960> @little_wrong Absolutely correct and they’ve been taught this via decades of indoctrination by the left.
1328097470992183296 2020-11-16 06:08:06 +0800 <__i960> They’ll just keep pushing this until they get their way. They’ll never stop because power and rule, not unity, is what they want.

1327776234550427648 2020-11-15 08:51:37 +0800 <__i960> Attacking people right next to a women with children. The fuck is wrong with these people. Just zero forethought and all emotion.
1327754598027718656 2020-11-15 07:25:39 +0800 <__i960> The tolerant left need to be put down.

1327743332575899648 2020-11-15 06:40:53 +0800 <__i960> @tired_fighting @JackPosobiec They’re the weakest fucks in the world. Completely depend on numbers to carry anything out.
1327743011380371456 2020-11-15 06:39:36 +0800 <__i960> Acts like a bitch as usual:  https://t.co/QAKfdZRX1o
1327742472865280000 2020-11-15 06:37:28 +0800 <__i960> Heh, yep
1327741363127865344 2020-11-15 06:33:03 +0800 <__i960> Peak fear mongering. Just grade A lies.
1327740681087983617 2020-11-15 06:30:21 +0800 <__i960> Biden is probably just watching reruns of Golden Girls while the swamp beasts choose their favorite picks.
1327729212589916160 2020-11-15 05:44:46 +0800 <__i960> I’ve seen these before, but just to reiterate: MSM == enemy of the people.
1327728639530569729 2020-11-15 05:42:30 +0800 <__i960> Or signatures at all

1327678671163781120 2020-11-15 02:23:56 +0800 <__i960> “Outnumbered and being protected by the police.” Figures. Fucking roaches.

1327656304635101189 2020-11-15 00:55:04 +0800 <__i960> @grindingdude @TuckerCarlson Fake news. C'mon man, basic due diligence.
1327648649069830144 2020-11-15 00:24:39 +0800 <__i960> Libs are always dependable for their continual self-projection:
1327641105324675072 2020-11-14 23:54:40 +0800 <__i960> @BeigeShiba Because group-think, dogma, and shaming is sO hOt rIgHt nOw.
1327640450530873345 2020-11-14 23:52:04 +0800 <__i960> @Debber66 "Ongoing"
1327640273858424833 2020-11-14 23:51:22 +0800 <__i960> @GregoryEck "Disney" not surprising at all.
1327638294516043777 2020-11-14 23:43:30 +0800 <__i960> @Nate_Cohn They don't need a better pitch, they need to simply die off as a party.
1327637139392065536 2020-11-14 23:38:54 +0800 <__i960> @NeoUnrealist Who wants to bet that antifa, being the roach colony that they are, took stock of the numbers and simply bitched out ahead of time?
1327636325080580096 2020-11-14 23:35:40 +0800 <__i960> @Patente7corso @Asif_H_Abdullah @Schuldensuehner China and AIPAC covid19 data is dubious at best. China is also great at ripping off everyone else's innovation and IP. High context, "do not question authority" societies are absolutely bad for innovation.
1327633350723477504 2020-11-14 23:23:51 +0800 <__i960> @martgarrison Because they're paid to not understand it.
1327633055192805376 2020-11-14 23:22:41 +0800 <__i960> Time for a cup of coffee and a re-read of the Unabomber's Manifesto:  https://t.co/ePbjWpQPBY
1327632586168958976 2020-11-14 23:20:49 +0800 <__i960> A broken people

1327482815747825673 2020-11-14 13:25:41 +0800 <__i960> @Castellena1 @samanthamarika1 Which just goes to show you that all those virtue signal tag lines of hers don’t mean squat when it actually comes to merit-worthy qualities that actually matter.
1327463295746416640 2020-11-14 12:08:07 +0800 <__i960> This guy is such a complete kook. Anything he says, believe the opposite.
1327462641833443328 2020-11-14 12:05:31 +0800 <__i960> @thirdgenwidget Perfect push-pull model to completely destroy whatever remains of our monetary system. The fuck is wrong with this country, seriously.
1327462348576018432 2020-11-14 12:04:21 +0800 <__i960> But you didn't, Gavin. You're 100% talk, always will be.   Myself, I don't care that you go to dinner during a "pAnDeMiC!", but don't order other people around for something you don't even follow yourself.
1327460821178302464 2020-11-14 11:58:17 +0800 <__i960> Coming to a dem-ruled city near you.
1327460216707850240 2020-11-14 11:55:53 +0800 <__i960> Truth. Don't ever think the left will just leave you alone - they won't. They can't. It's who they are.
1327446365614469120 2020-11-14 11:00:50 +0800 <__i960> Lol and here they go. These fucking people are impossible to win with.
1327414399892561920 2020-11-14 08:53:49 +0800 <__i960> @SicarioScott She's fake as fuq.
1327412953432244224 2020-11-14 08:48:04 +0800 <__i960> @ChefGruel Because Gavin says so, Chef! This is what all of us were warning folks about back in March. If you give an inch they'll take a mile and you'll have to sue for your rights back.
1327406122429423616 2020-11-14 08:20:56 +0800 <__i960> @kiswanson @AngryCardio @MorningAnswer So we should instead just take your word for it? “Source: my tweet”
1327381038872424448 2020-11-14 06:41:15 +0800 <__i960> "We won't be delivering [the vaccine] to New York until we have authorization [from Cuomo] to do so. That pains me to say that."  Media == enemy.

1327374806107340801 2020-11-14 06:16:29 +0800 <__i960> Stay optimistic.
1327371465881133056 2020-11-14 06:03:13 +0800 <__i960> @JvittalTV This is utterly false.
1327371366522187776 2020-11-14 06:02:49 +0800 <__i960> Perfect example of how absolutely garbage journalism is these days. Anyone who just watched the press conference knows this isn't what Trump said at all:

1327273553578708994 2020-11-13 23:34:09 +0800 <__i960> These people are destroying our country.

1327107763093192704 2020-11-13 12:35:21 +0800 <__i960> @KarlThorburn Back when families admired outboards together. Check out those largemouth on the wall though.
1327107155875430402 2020-11-13 12:32:57 +0800 <__i960> I don't know about you guys, but since 2015, the media has gotten so much better!
1327104835041124352 2020-11-13 12:23:43 +0800 <__i960> @thebadegg3 @GovMikeDeWine Gotta love how he has zero faith in his own people to simply trust that they'll do right by their own decisions. Of course, none of that really matters because these psychopaths aren't happy unless they're controlling everyone's lives.
1327080743005130752 2020-11-13 10:47:59 +0800 <__i960> @AmieWohrer @RaheemKassam and a side of "cOpE" as they all like to say... truly spiteful people.

1327073457645862913 2020-11-13 10:19:02 +0800 <__i960> @WarDuke80 @michaelshermer Absolutely. This should be a bail-in.

1327068387642490880 2020-11-13 09:58:54 +0800 <__i960> @GOPChairwoman @TeamTrump The amount of pro-Biden and "nEvEr TrUmP" trolls in here is just insane. Totally inorganic.
1327048185613746177 2020-11-13 08:38:37 +0800 <__i960> @pnjaban @Elex_Michaelson I already do that now honestly.
1327022779690934272 2020-11-13 06:57:40 +0800 <__i960> The manipulation and abuse from pro-lockdown types is so incredibly transparent. It's basically the same stupid shit as leftists (which is why the overlap is high): control other people as much as possible as an attempt to control one's own environment.
1327014257150500864 2020-11-13 06:23:48 +0800 <__i960> @KillLockdowns @TimTravis2 30

You also don't appear to have a lot of confidence in the human species' ability to overcome a typical respiratory virus. This isn't new.
1326940108134608896 2020-11-13 01:29:09 +0800 <__i960> @trianglman @lesleynka_LA @NextLAMayor I like how you think you’re above nature. Nature has many things in store for you.

1326922338659491840 2020-11-13 00:18:33 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader All those guys are completely content with the status quo. They just want stability no matter who gets fucked by it. "I've got mine."

1326753820353781763 2020-11-12 13:08:55 +0800 <__i960> This is like the liberal polsci version of the navy seal copypasta.
1326750898240909312 2020-11-12 12:57:18 +0800 <__i960> They’ll just keep tightening that noose.

Seeing as you pro lockdown types are heavily dependent on everyone else to survive, it’s dead in the water.
1326749478552940545 2020-11-12 12:51:40 +0800 <__i960> @EdeleMancini @DoctorOfBirdLaw @Gharphield @ConceptualJames You people have zero cognitive ability to think past a screen door. It’s all about TESTING. Ie quantity and sensitivity (CT count).  Aside from that Sweden’s death chart makes it clear their strategy worked extremely well.

1326733836542119937 2020-11-12 11:49:30 +0800 <__i960> It’s coming. Most will go right along with it too.
1326717987496194049 2020-11-12 10:46:32 +0800 <__i960> @VeritasVital Think wider on this. They’ll extend similar requirements to everything effectively strong-arming you into it if you want to live in modern society.
1326717697216798720 2020-11-12 10:45:22 +0800 <__i960> @antihero_kate This is what they want. They’ve been telegraphing it for over 6 months now.

1326708386348429317 2020-11-12 10:08:23 +0800 <__i960> @bclund SF are the typical self back-patters for doing nothing whatsoever special other than running to their bunkers a week early. Meanwhile they still had all the blue collar folk doing all the essential work and catering to the scared techies.  SF is classic Eloi vs Morlocks.

1326701708492238848 2020-11-12 09:41:50 +0800 <__i960> @JennyChachan Berkeley did this same BS. The answer is they're psychotic control freaks.

This is why the media is such fucking garbage. It doesn't serve to inform or critically think - it serves purely to advance a narrative.

1325485385741332481 2020-11-09 01:08:36 +0800 <__i960> @JoshAnimator Yep, we all called it.
1325484224728555520 2020-11-09 01:04:00 +0800 <__i960> @drdavidsamadi  https://t.co/ninWk5DlPp
1325482098933727232 2020-11-09 00:55:33 +0800 <__i960> @ADUK2019 Their poor psyche and identity can't possibly be threatened by voting for a so-called "strong man." It's truly incredible.
1325480632739266560 2020-11-09 00:49:43 +0800 <__i960> @of_mccrae @neontaster That's their job. It's the American people's job to turn them off - but they can't, or won't.
1325480121868800000 2020-11-09 00:47:41 +0800 <__i960> @little_wrong @AlexBerenson And the homeless industrial complex is always "there to help" while the city votes itself into taxation hell so they can basically do a combination of lighting 100s of millions of dollars on fire and handing the rest over to middle-men.
1325479443935064064 2020-11-09 00:45:00 +0800 <__i960> @little_wrong @AlexBerenson SF is so utterly a lost cause it's just sad. The pols/supes there basically socialize all the costs to their citizens through collective brain-washing of "imagine if you were in their shoes!" whilst largely avoiding it themselves. It'll get worse before better.
1325474616215707648 2020-11-09 00:25:49 +0800 <__i960> @mchastain81 Absolutely nobody is saying your vote is owed to them, it's about having an actual strategy here. You think voting 3rd party and then seeing the dems steal it is best for libertarians in the long-term? It's a "making a point" vote that has zero chance of winning.
1325472500151508992 2020-11-09 00:17:24 +0800 <__i960> Remember, this is an explicit attempt at demoralization of those who disagree. The media has been aggressive in this regard by how they call races for each candidate and how they call the election itself. Then to the court of public opinion that they already basically control.
1325467269871251456 2020-11-08 23:56:37 +0800 <__i960> @MarquisDeMarche It really is truly amazing how obvious everything is here and yet people are okay with it. Sadly, completely unsurprising too.
1325466988538335235 2020-11-08 23:55:30 +0800 <__i960> Wake up to the con, folks. This outcome was 100% predicted. You seriously just gonna sit here and watch all this happening right in front of you and accept that?
1325466500778524672 2020-11-08 23:53:34 +0800 <__i960> Yep, and as predicted, the media would go 100% foregone conclusion in order to psychologically manipulate the masses and establish inertia to their cause. SocMed companies pre-flighted it with their own hyper-aggressive censoring of any tweet critical of the election process.
1325464776554672129 2020-11-08 23:46:43 +0800 <__i960> But hey, a return to the institutional swamp is so much better than Trump sending out mean tweets, right?
1325460987399467008 2020-11-08 23:31:39 +0800 <__i960> @Suckbluefrog @crockpotrealism @ConceptualJames Just block em on sight. They’re roaches.

1325460496930074625 2020-11-08 23:29:42 +0800 <__i960> @Rebeckahtx @ConceptualJames The freedoms of America are the types of freedoms that require fighting for because they’ll always be under threat. Most folks don’t want to hear this or accept that reality.
1325458283008720896 2020-11-08 23:20:55 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero By and large the continual march towards stripping Americans of their 2A rights is a war that will absolutely continue. You know how this goes man, you know why they’re doing it. Dems do not want you to be able to fight back and they telegraph it over and over and over.
1325456625130328066 2020-11-08 23:14:19 +0800 <__i960> Remember when Girl Scouts announced a month or so ago “we are an apolitical organization” after their deleted female SC justices tweet? Doesn’t look like it to me.
1325456007636512768 2020-11-08 23:11:52 +0800 <__i960> @LivingIn_CA @ScottAdamsSays If hell breaks loose then it breaks loose. You don’t accept getting fucked over just because you don’t want to rock the boat or fear the reaction. Doing otherwise means you’re owned.
1325314436240863233 2020-11-08 13:49:19 +0800 <__i960> @dursk Yep, fair enough. I think it's constructive to hear you have concerns, regardless of who you voted for or what your politics are, as it shows integrity and a consideration for the process itself.
1325308166461026304 2020-11-08 13:24:24 +0800 <__i960> @DudeKowabunga @Zigmanfreud Neither AUS/NZ are done. They simply locked down and delayed the inevitable. Economic losses real.
1325308001427681280 2020-11-08 13:23:45 +0800 <__i960> @Zigmanfreud It's just TONE John. Do you seriously buy into the value of words or delivery this much? Actions always matter more than words.
1325306998531870720 2020-11-08 13:19:46 +0800 <__i960> @chriswithans Was kinda hoping for a "- Dems lose house in 2022" in here.
1325305889528557570 2020-11-08 13:15:21 +0800 <__i960> Nationally mandate PCR CT @ 30, throw in some kind of mask mandate for theatrical purposes, and pandemic "over." Declare victory.
1325304760233123840 2020-11-08 13:10:52 +0800 <__i960> @dursk You might want to ask yourself, honestly, if you're really happy about the outcome of all this. Put your thinking cap on and realize just what they put everyone through in order to justify mass mail-in voting. 1000s of small businesses nuked, adults, and children's lives wrecked.
1325303955371384832 2020-11-08 13:07:40 +0800 <__i960> @JackLaridian @BobRisigliano @Matthew_4_Trump Pronouns in bio, opinion void.

1325303042925756417 2020-11-08 13:04:03 +0800 <__i960> @Greg_Tolan Security over liberty. Too comfortable and too attached to that comfort.
1325299486256586754 2020-11-08 12:49:55 +0800 <__i960> @BrightonCap @1_lot_hero The severity of said “bad spells” was not the same from a personal liberties standpoint nor was from an actual pandemic standpoint either. By and large red states recovered faster and with less loss of individual liberty. Overall there’s no reason we should still be in this state
1325298868041392134 2020-11-08 12:47:27 +0800 <__i960> @corvo4change @ScottAdamsSays But I don’t think we’d be finding any blind allegiance just due to appointments. You have to admit here it’s a weird situation when “conservative justice” means “will abide by the constitution.” It shouldn’t be an issue in the first place.
1325298578869293058 2020-11-08 12:46:18 +0800 <__i960> @corvo4change @ScottAdamsSays I mean I agree with you in that they can achieve a hearing that’s based on constitutional law - which is what they’re supposed to be about in the first place. Just because there’s a conservative “majority” doesn’t mean it’s sympathy.
1325276185463459841 2020-11-08 11:17:19 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero They locked you up for months on end and fucked over loads of people to help ensure this result. I’m gonna assume you ain’t cool with that.
1325267538578608128 2020-11-08 10:42:58 +0800 <__i960> Has it dawned on the libs yet that if elected Biden’s already a lame duck?
1325262993907593216 2020-11-08 10:24:54 +0800 <__i960> "Joe's a moderate! A return to stability!"
1325261761969205249 2020-11-08 10:20:00 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero I hope they like their greens...  BTW: domestic consumption from imported sources is only about 13% or so. The other 87% comes from here. There's been talks on here of a "general strike" (seriously doubt it), but imagine what that'd look like.
1325254817577492481 2020-11-08 09:52:25 +0800 <__i960> @BuckSexton Yes, but to a certain extent, this is a fatal weakness of the right. They expect the other side to have similar fairness or moral code, when they most absolutely do not.
1325254282946359296 2020-11-08 09:50:17 +0800 <__i960> @GrumpyOLSoldier @bennoba They should fight it legally and if nothing is actionable or found, then concede. I realize where you're coming from but you need to consider that you're falling right into the MSM guilt trip they've laid out for you.
1325253491720220672 2020-11-08 09:47:09 +0800 <__i960> @MollyMiller951 It seems like that list they have just keeps on expanding.. hopefully it keeps going until the platform consumes itself entirely.

1325239957829476353 2020-11-08 08:53:22 +0800 <__i960> @BurialOfTheDead @newbury_eric Think about the potential liability here, no business would risk that. Also, there's no need to put lead into a piece of rubber.
1325236332264783873 2020-11-08 08:38:57 +0800 <__i960> @BurialOfTheDead @newbury_eric They’re not going to make earbuds with lead, cmon.
1325232963362066433 2020-11-08 08:25:34 +0800 <__i960> @corvo4change @ScottAdamsSays The US Supreme Court is not controlled by any political party. Civics 101.
1325231942376157185 2020-11-08 08:21:31 +0800 <__i960> @ScottAdamsSays Related to #2, there's no guarantee every registered voter is even going to vote, so unless the polls care to notice that their provisional vote counts are all of a sudden shooting up on election day, who's to say this couldn't be a route for 10-100k in each state?
1325231505916882945 2020-11-08 08:19:47 +0800 <__i960> @ScottAdamsSays 1. In the "peaceful transition" deal/trade: what leverage would he even have at that point? 2. Why aren't we considering the physical fraud route here? There were millions and millions of mail in ballots that were dumped on the country. There's no way they were all accounted for.
1325221947467165696 2020-11-08 07:41:48 +0800 <__i960> @BeschlossDC Spoiler: you are. Have fun with your newfound ratings and bullshit rags nobody will bother reading at this point.
1325220368479522817 2020-11-08 07:35:31 +0800 <__i960> "Instantly help"
1325219931554680832 2020-11-08 07:33:47 +0800 <__i960> Always with the melodrama. This party needs to be shit-canned so ridiculously hard.
1325219679309242369 2020-11-08 07:32:47 +0800 <__i960> @wirewrapping @Not_the_Bee Or alternatively making sure that you pay 20k$/year to provide healthcare for everyone else.
1325219145068154880 2020-11-08 07:30:40 +0800 <__i960> You won't last a day in the wild, pal.
1325218757120159744 2020-11-08 07:29:07 +0800 <__i960> Agreed. It's also amusing that the whole CV19 case-demic is trivially controllable by simply mandating a lower PCR cycle threshold than the ~40 we use now. Boom, cases plummet. Problem for them is due to optics, it can't be too quick. Either way we were fed a lie the whole time.
1325202469018742784 2020-11-08 06:24:24 +0800 <__i960> @naynanjani @Jared_Sawyer1 @dbongino Hilarious sense of importance you just assigned yourself there. If you think folks are like “let’s talk about this together” you’re completely delusional.
1325201618006994944 2020-11-08 06:21:01 +0800 <__i960> @GeorgeTheodore7 @Peoples_Pundit @Barnes_Law But they do know they can send out millions of unrequested mail in ballots and then let the cogs of war go to work after that.
1325198846616432644 2020-11-08 06:10:00 +0800 <__i960> @pjlehner @DavidBCollum They won’t be taking those guns, trust me. They’ll have to breed it out of people.
1325184683856949248 2020-11-08 05:13:44 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon Would never work, the coasts are way too dependent on the inland areas. In fact, the blue areas are heavily dependent on red areas from a pure survival standpoint.
1325183779992858626 2020-11-08 05:10:08 +0800 <__i960> Be prepared to show them you'll take them at their word.

1325166473568940034 2020-11-08 04:01:22 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero Lumber futures gap down open.

1325155616474583041 2020-11-08 03:18:13 +0800 <__i960> @ne0agent1c Definitely. To the left, "equality" is basically shorthand for "equality of outcome" every time. Decades and decades of this outright brain-washing, and now we have to deal with it. It won't be pretty.
1325155047357915148 2020-11-08 03:15:58 +0800 <__i960> @HylanderPaul Absolutely, and for them to think there aren't other countries out there willing to outwork us, is a fatal error. We cannot have a population of predominantly weak-willed people if we expect to last long as a country.

1325153967534338048 2020-11-08 03:11:40 +0800 <__i960> @davereaboi "Official sources" hilarious. Could it be anymore clear, folks?
1325153005264490496 2020-11-08 03:07:51 +0800 <__i960> @asarahlarson @gminnj Jesus, listen to yourselves. Do you even have any agency anymore or have you jettisoned all of it to some political party? It's absolutely pathetic.
1325151985234931713 2020-11-08 03:03:48 +0800 <__i960> @MarcusBeam1 @JordanSchachtel @HumphreyPT Vaccine against a virus that'll mutate within 3-6 months is utterly pointless. The only vaccine here is the human body itself. This ain't smallpox.
1325150696375635972 2020-11-08 02:58:40 +0800 <__i960> @SwipeWright @AP21091285 @sullydish @EPoe187 @DavidAFrench "Based on how nice a guy my opposition is, I'm completely glad they just swiped my queen."
1325148869844332545 2020-11-08 02:51:25 +0800 <__i960> They'll also deliberately try to stand in the way of any and all meaningful election reform to severely curtail or outright stop this abuse. What you're seeing here is exactly the same kind of political proceedings that occur in 3rd world countries and they want it that way.
1325148436769898498 2020-11-08 02:49:42 +0800 <__i960> Now that the mass unrequested mail-in ballots genie is out of the bottle, expect Dems to try and use this for every single election, including mid-terms, going forward.
1325145184338759688 2020-11-08 02:36:46 +0800 <__i960> @newbury_eric They’re usually the abused and self-abused types. Party of weakness.
1325141142371930118 2020-11-08 02:20:42 +0800 <__i960> Let’s start with yours.
1325131970381189121 2020-11-08 01:44:16 +0800 <__i960> @redsteeze Dunno but he’s probably on a list he really doesn’t wanna be on now.
1325131614976761858 2020-11-08 01:42:51 +0800 <__i960> @Silent_Kindling @EPoe187 He can’t. These guys love the narcissistic smug intellectualism first and foremost. That’s the dopamine source.
1325131301930721280 2020-11-08 01:41:36 +0800 <__i960> This is what we’re dealing with here:
1325131021273063426 2020-11-08 01:40:29 +0800 <__i960> Of course he doesn’t. It’s China and India first now. To all the never trumpers and dumbass libs: thanks for the self own. BTW: have fun with that senate.
1325129909878939649 2020-11-08 01:36:04 +0800 <__i960> @ConceptualJames The problem with “smart libs” is they have zero real skin in the game. But that’ll change.
1325129556991250436 2020-11-08 01:34:40 +0800 <__i960> @wtx_trading What I find the most disturbing are those willing to go along with a rigged system when it benefits them. That is truly a disgusting approach but I also hold personal integrity on a pedestal. Seems to be a dying ethos these days which isn’t a good sign for the future.
1325122115796824066 2020-11-08 01:05:06 +0800 <__i960> @wtx_trading Yep. Nothing surprising about it whatsoever.
1325120763708407809 2020-11-08 00:59:44 +0800 <__i960> @chadfelixg Seems pretty clear to me. Stop viewing them through rose lens and take them at their word.
1325105410961891329 2020-11-07 23:58:43 +0800 <__i960> @Chrsteeny @eijajdks @CanineCt @JTR_2112 @paulsperry_ Hello, where have you been this entire year? Unrequested mail in ballots.
1324963867726770176 2020-11-07 14:36:17 +0800 <__i960> @idiotJournos @JimSnowFN @BobQuarantine That only prevents bunk ballots. It doesn’t do anything about harvesting, coercion, or outright theft of mailed in ballots. A good stat to check would be how many registered who voted but who did NOT have a history of voting in recent prior elections.
1324962218610364416 2020-11-07 14:29:44 +0800 <__i960> @elwinslow @AndySwan @AOC Oh I don't disagree his personality turned off many people or that some Rs who might have traditionally voted for him did not in this case. Totally happened. But it's the sheer amount seen in *key* states that bothers me. It's also statistically off compared to nearby counties.
1324961754456100865 2020-11-07 14:27:53 +0800 <__i960> @elwinslow @AndySwan @AOC This isn't about party. If Trump were pulling out blocks of pure Trump votes from DC or Philly or Atlanta I'd be saying the exact same thing: there is something not right there. We cannot as people look the other way just because it benefits, it is wrong and hurts everyone.
1324961062781820928 2020-11-07 14:25:08 +0800 <__i960> @elwinslow @AndySwan @AOC It is absolutely not nonsense. Look at the data out there, look at the precedent sent with mass mail in voting and what we're dealing with now. Honestly, I don't care what Fox says, the media has been dead to me for quite a while now. The entire issue here is the TRUTH.
1324959305129357312 2020-11-07 14:18:09 +0800 <__i960> @elwinslow @AndySwan If the jumps were similar to that 2016 level in the charts, then I'd buy that. But there are countless statistical anomalies in this election that when combined together scream something else going on. Americans shouldn't just accept this and move on, regardless of their party.
1324953797324533764 2020-11-07 13:56:16 +0800 <__i960> @CassandraRules Yeah but his supporter's comments are just something else.

1324940453356085249 2020-11-07 13:03:14 +0800 <__i960> @jedimarkus77 @benshapiro What I wouldn't be looking forward to is the mere sight or sound of Kamala Harris in any way shape or form.
1324939955794178049 2020-11-07 13:01:16 +0800 <__i960> @eijajdks @CanineCt @JTR_2112 @paulsperry_ Ah but that's not the issue. It's the people voting *once* who never intended to vote in the first place.
1324939637140332544 2020-11-07 13:00:00 +0800 <__i960> They tear the ballot when you surrender it, so the double count isn't really the problem. Look, this is the real issue: Tens of millions of ballots were sent out with zero audit trail other than postal mail. Not every registered voter *actually votes*. Do the math from there.
1324938937366794241 2020-11-07 12:57:13 +0800 <__i960> @Vokskan1680 @jrtrevino805 @paulsperry_ 100% not true. Even when registering to vote *in person* in California, they still sent out mail in ballots to registered voters. What he is saying is absolutely how it went here in the state of CA.
1324936969042845696 2020-11-07 12:49:24 +0800 <__i960> @AOC Keep up with this talk and I foresee more than just "deleted accounts."
1324936083289767937 2020-11-07 12:45:53 +0800 <__i960> @NewYearsDani @LegendaryEnergy @LoriKemp Absolutely. The media is probably the worst thing in the world for people to pay any attention to. It's actively disinforming.
1324934087547645954 2020-11-07 12:37:57 +0800 <__i960> Libertarians, I love ya, but sometimes it's not the most important thing in the world to be "right." You don't have liberty without a republic. And you don't have a republic with commies past the gates.
1324933708273475584 2020-11-07 12:36:26 +0800 <__i960> @mfoxhunter Yep this is so trivial it's not even funny. Also the earlier guide step about "your laptop must be in airplane mode" lol. Criminal.
1324932116560322560 2020-11-07 12:30:07 +0800 <__i960> @VanJones68 Really, Van? You're truly happy with this outcome? You know whilst Machiavellian politics may illicit an end that some people think is justified, your conscious might say otherwise.
1324931274625044480 2020-11-07 12:26:46 +0800 <__i960> @fiktshun @thehill LOL, that's because it was buddy.
1324931121822359552 2020-11-07 12:26:10 +0800 <__i960> See, covid19 already on the way out, you'll keep seeing more of these, folks.
1324928944848556032 2020-11-07 12:17:31 +0800 <__i960> Pointless waste of time.
1324914492388507650 2020-11-07 11:20:05 +0800 <__i960> @PPatriot4life @mymandate @KevinKileyCA He’s referring specifically to the invalidated EO (related to mail ins) that was for California. Not all CA EOs were retroactively overturned.
1324912161441767425 2020-11-07 11:10:49 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader I actually saw on the Bloomberg stream that they basically had the same stage with all the same jeeps parked out there. I gotta say the choice of Jeep does really nail his “hitting the wall” wine mom base.
1324911445570547712 2020-11-07 11:07:58 +0800 <__i960> Thanks for wasting our time, Joe!
1324911198287007744 2020-11-07 11:06:59 +0800 <__i960> @BabeTruth13 @johncardillo Most certainly.
1324900298150748160 2020-11-07 10:23:41 +0800 <__i960> "Let's just get it over with and move on already" &lt;--- MSM psyop to try and get you to accept your shit sandwich they helped prepare.
1324890599497981953 2020-11-07 09:45:08 +0800 <__i960> It's 2045ET. Is Biden going to actually say something or waste everyone's time as usual?
1324890121041162240 2020-11-07 09:43:14 +0800 <__i960> @JBarsaUSAID @USAID @realDonaldTrump Swamp creature.
1324889267684868097 2020-11-07 09:39:51 +0800 <__i960> @SamHarrisOrg Notice the "bukkake" reference. On brand if you know what I mean.
1324888955385335808 2020-11-07 09:38:36 +0800 <__i960> @jeff_urizen @SamHarrisOrg Correct, just another weak ass male who wouldn't survive a day in the wild. Intellectualism doesn't get you out of the jungle, Sam.

1324887459713306624 2020-11-07 09:32:40 +0800 <__i960> @JcMartocci @stoicynic @peterboghossian You seek retribution regardless. Don’t ask for help when you meet real resistance because you have no idea the fire you’re playing with here.

1324886737512886273 2020-11-07 09:29:48 +0800 <__i960> @redpillblack1 @peterboghossian If push comes to shove, shoving will most definitely happen. It may not go down directly in the urban areas but outside that it’s a different ball game.
1324884394243313665 2020-11-07 09:20:29 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies an old army boot, with deluxe gravy.

1324879018227765248 2020-11-07 08:59:07 +0800 <__i960> @chadfelixg Gotta love: "I hate racism (white supremacy, white privilege, white victimhood)."  &lt;-- but if other groups want to do, it's totally cool. These people are race obsessed and projecting.
1324873578882293761 2020-11-07 08:37:30 +0800 <__i960> @DrJacobsRad @PattyHajdu Have fun opening the borders back up then. No escape.

1324868691922616320 2020-11-07 08:18:05 +0800 <__i960> Everything is a threat with these people. They don’t know a real threat.

1324867813425623042 2020-11-07 08:14:36 +0800 <__i960> @AskeladdenTX @dwbakke Additionally red states that opened quicker or exposed themselves to it faster resulted in basically driving out the virus faster. Combining that with not testing everyone over a sniffle results in getting out of it quicker. Blue state approach is basically self extending.
1324867154555019266 2020-11-07 08:11:59 +0800 <__i960> @AskeladdenTX @dwbakke The only thing that matters at this point are excess deaths because the testing data is so incredibly inconsistent everywhere both in unique samples (ie is this one person or the same person multiple times) and PCR cycles. The data is a mess. Cases don’t matter, deaths do.
1324817370162974720 2020-11-07 04:54:09 +0800 <__i960> @mtaibbi They don’t speak class. They speak race.
1324817246032551936 2020-11-07 04:53:40 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader We can’t have the people getting any kind of alternate truth now can we? Looking forward to when Jack ends up against the wall himself.

1324756229961338880 2020-11-07 00:51:12 +0800 <__i960> @realAaronBly And expect an insurrection act and widespread NG deployments because this time there’s no election to worry about.
1324755793887965184 2020-11-07 00:49:28 +0800 <__i960> @ShelleyWilde2 @dowop_robinson It’s either them or the dirtbag left accounts that spam the platform. It’s all so tiring.

The "literally Hitler" stance only works with other useful idiots and what you're not getting is that the rest of us sane people can't stand the unhinged crowd, period.

1324745609824202752 2020-11-07 00:09:00 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson Translation: "I wanted Biden to win, so this result is convenient for me even if there is zero integrity in how it was obtained." Have some fucking consistency dude.
1324744439911256064 2020-11-07 00:04:21 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson For a guy who spends months looking at stats and data you sure seem quick to just blindly accept this one.
1324743137303015424 2020-11-06 23:59:11 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader They'll understand when the boot is directly on their neck, and only then.
1324739771617300482 2020-11-06 23:45:48 +0800 <__i960> @reneeaste @CosmoDiGirolamo @mtracey They locked down the country and destroyed countless businesses and lives to justify mail in voting on a mass scale. Nobody should accept any of this.
1324733472347283461 2020-11-06 23:20:46 +0800 <__i960> @Bertie799 Covid-19 hysteria was purposively and explicitly used to justify mass mail in voting on a scale we’ve never had before.
1324733055337050114 2020-11-06 23:19:07 +0800 <__i960> @Bertie799 @hollymathnerd And of course it’s Point Reyes. Marin is full of sheltered limousine liberals and wine moms with zero actual skin in the game. They’d change their tune right quick if the marches ended up in their neighborhoods.
1324594995765018624 2020-11-06 14:10:31 +0800 <__i960> @SALagunas @apravink @UofCalifornia @UCPrezDrake Dude, no, this is playing games. We know what the propositions are about and we know the supreme court cases involved on this as well.
1324588856344080390 2020-11-06 13:46:07 +0800 <__i960> @TheHorrorNerd02 @bkmybucketlist @cahobbs_gc1996 @Peoples_Pundit Their point is they tried exactly that, believing in a fair outcome, and look at the BS we're all dealing with right now.
1324587398190100481 2020-11-06 13:40:20 +0800 <__i960> @SeamusPotStir @realPhiILacio Open to exploitation? Sure, of course. But seems pretty unlikely to me given they're totally on camera and the risk of getting caught is high. My opinion is that the election is being stolen, but I just don't think it is in this specific case.
1324586916663058432 2020-11-06 13:38:25 +0800 <__i960> @SeamusPotStir @realPhiILacio Was this the one with the video of the people sitting at the table and filling out ballots? The original tweet got nuked. If so, I do not believe there's anything amiss actually going on in that case. They're simply transcribing unscannable ballots.
1324585945044197376 2020-11-06 13:34:33 +0800 <__i960> @MrAndyNgo @JoAnnPDX Lead needs to start being used en masse on these folks.
1324585064500355072 2020-11-06 13:31:03 +0800 <__i960> @LorenaAD80 For Christ sake, try focusing on something Californians actually need rather than more bullshit regulations thrown on top of everything.
1324584063965962241 2020-11-06 13:27:05 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom @citizenj17 SF is an insane asylum. I've seen it's decline for decades now and it's simply not pretty. The city gets what it voted for. Are you in SF now?
1324583326313668611 2020-11-06 13:24:09 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom @citizenj17 I'm curious to see how it goes in LA given that they have their heads up their ass and voted for Gascon. He got run out of SF for being so bad. SF of all places!
1324582960826257408 2020-11-06 13:22:42 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom @citizenj17 IMO try to find places in nearby suburbs outside of cities. 90% of the time you don't even need to be in whatever major city people think they need to be living in, and there's way less BS to deal with.
1324582308272250882 2020-11-06 13:20:06 +0800 <__i960> If you want to repeal this, you're against American ideals, and should not be in any position of power:  https://t.co/0uxVWoXfc6
1324581778753949696 2020-11-06 13:18:00 +0800 <__i960> UC system itself right here folks. If you want to know where all the race-obsessed garbage is coming from, look inwards:
1324581261579448321 2020-11-06 13:15:56 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom @citizenj17 You dodged a bullet there, figuratively and literally. Stay away from "urban centers" if you want to have any semblance of sanity in your life. Dems don't give a fuck about their cities, it's just a racket and plantation to them.
1324579549087031297 2020-11-06 13:09:08 +0800 <__i960> @JordanSchachtel Sad thing being that in a lot of cases they moved to this country for a better life, to escape all that garbage.
1324578355920859137 2020-11-06 13:04:24 +0800 <__i960> @MacaesBruno Indeed...  https://t.co/kAjt2IH5gY
1324560213546917889 2020-11-06 11:52:18 +0800 <__i960> @JunoTyson_ @MisterBlackPill This right here. Explain how in any sane universe we’re seeing 100k+ tranches of pure Biden votes from anywhere.
1324558718512496640 2020-11-06 11:46:22 +0800 <__i960> They have destroyed countless businesses, lives of adults, and forced your children out of school to achieve this outcome.  They are now attempting to violate the will of the American people - good people who believed in their vote making a difference.  This is NOT ACCEPTABLE.
1324548739516657664 2020-11-06 11:06:43 +0800 <__i960> Completely uncensored by twitter:  https://t.co/wZhhduI3lm
1324545052400525313 2020-11-06 10:52:04 +0800 <__i960> Dems actually think their base is going to forget about coronavirus in 2 years, particularly the small business owners that got destroyed. Not gonna happen. Only lockdown loving libs will be true believers, but plenty of other people will figure out what really happened.
1324544159852621824 2020-11-06 10:48:31 +0800 <__i960> @trump_nasty @henryrodgersdc The literal embodiment of “cry more, lib”

1324532048376131587 2020-11-06 10:00:23 +0800 <__i960> @TheMadDog65 @tired_fighting @stacey_rudin We’ll see, but they can only snow so many people for so long. If it’s the gameplay by 2022 people will be pretty pissed off. Not sure where you are US wise but whilst Sweden is a nice developed country the weather is miserable. Also, very samey, very orderly. Too orderly for me.
1324531589477355520 2020-11-06 09:58:34 +0800 <__i960> @TheMadDog65 @tired_fighting @stacey_rudin If you watch the media enough over the years, which I’m sure you guys have, you’ll notice the same patterns over and over. It might as well be pure mind control at this point. My grandma used to yell at us kids “turn off that idiot box!” How right she was.
1324530986005131264 2020-11-06 09:56:10 +0800 <__i960> @BrianGoodlife Nice. You must be down south then. I’m actually from down there but I moved up here 20+ years ago.
1324530851393105921 2020-11-06 09:55:38 +0800 <__i960> @BrianGoodlife Yep. And they’re going to do the same corrupt garbage they did before. Ole Gav has already pledged his support. In reality this is about control of coastal access and it’s resources. California is incredibly corrupt and controlled by big $$$ whether people like it or not.
1324530423628660738 2020-11-06 09:53:56 +0800 <__i960> @TheMadDog65 @tired_fighting @stacey_rudin They know the people will not stand for additional lockdowns at this point and why bother, the core motive has been completed.

They’ll keep up the fear for a little while - but bit by bit they’ll peel things back until it almost never happened at which point they’ll be onto something else.

1324528898684583936 2020-11-06 09:47:52 +0800 <__i960> @stacey_rudin Absolutely. Watch the progression and media reaction over the next 6 months. Positive covid news will outpace negative and many sudden “new found discoveries” will be found. They fucked us.
1324528541736656896 2020-11-06 09:46:27 +0800 <__i960> @BrianGoodlife I’ve been keeping tabs on the various games these “environmental” groups are pulling to try and fuck with us anglers. It’s more than clear they simply want to push aquaculture (fish farms) and restrict ocean access. Just look at the whole MLPA process from mid 2000s. Corrupt.
1324528206314004481 2020-11-06 09:45:07 +0800 <__i960> @BrianGoodlife Surf fishing for perch and striper mainly off the coast in NorCal, occasional rock fishing for greenling, blacks and blues, cabezon etc. A couple times a year drift fishing for steelhead you near Redding but I mostly keep it saltwater as I’m pretty close.
1324525908506497024 2020-11-06 09:35:59 +0800 <__i960> @BillyBoysDaddy @DailyCaller Jokes on him. Biden can’t get shit done either way.
1324525672681725952 2020-11-06 09:35:03 +0800 <__i960> @philllosoraptor They’re always so incredibly melodramatic. Histrionic personality disorder and narcissism seems to run strong in lib circles, among other things.
1324524704862937089 2020-11-06 09:31:12 +0800 <__i960> @stacey_rudin Look closely though. They’ll start easing it back piece by piece now.
1324523221094334464 2020-11-06 09:25:19 +0800 <__i960> @BrianGoodlife BTW: You fish CA? I do.
1324522755606241280 2020-11-06 09:23:28 +0800 <__i960> And just like that. Covid was magically fixed. Worst part? Not a damn thing is gonna be done about it.
1324520126482272257 2020-11-06 09:13:01 +0800 <__i960> @BrianGoodlife Gotta be some Packard foundation in there somewhere too.
1324517729768910848 2020-11-06 09:03:29 +0800 <__i960> “Stunning and brave.”  Media == enemy. I cannot state on twitter what should be done to them.
1324517114099625984 2020-11-06 09:01:02 +0800 <__i960> @tomfriedman One is democrat the other is republican. I’ll let you figure out the political orientation of the “journalist.”
1324483933287796737 2020-11-06 06:49:12 +0800 <__i960> @realchrisrufo @GregOlson91 Okay so do you believe there’s suppression then? Just because one half believes something and the other half believes something else doesn’t mean those beliefs both have the same actual merit.
1324477932547448832 2020-11-06 06:25:21 +0800 <__i960> @danielkotzin Why? Because the people consent to this.
1324465168781225985 2020-11-06 05:34:38 +0800 <__i960> @GrayChevyVan @ScottAdamsSays One can only hope. They’re gonna have a bad time with the military handling it under insurrection orders.
1324458090415095809 2020-11-06 05:06:30 +0800 <__i960> @BotCordial Fine with me, let it get messy.
1324447274525622272 2020-11-06 04:23:31 +0800 <__i960> @AdamInHTownTX @benyc @varadmehta Gotta love too how it's merely about uttering the words rather than pushing back against all the garbage. Might as well have said "we must not let them hear us say it."
1324443909057961984 2020-11-06 04:10:09 +0800 <__i960> @nightsky20201 Swamp gonna swamp, happens every time.
1324436245972316161 2020-11-06 03:39:42 +0800 <__i960> @Shanghaibeast You mean like they did for the last 4 years dude?
1324431495516221440 2020-11-06 03:20:49 +0800 <__i960> @realDailyWire @benshapiro Fuck Hollywood.
1324420357923737602 2020-11-06 02:36:34 +0800 <__i960> The longer this situation goes on the more likely the media will be pushing to get you to accept their narrative as a foregone conclusion. This is why various polling centers are taking their sweet time and ignoring lawful orders for observation. They’re laughing in your face.
1324419980775940096 2020-11-06 02:35:04 +0800 <__i960> @redsteeze So because trump said something anyone with a brain knew was going to happen right when they started pushing for mass mail in voting it’s all now just a giant conspiracy? Had trump said nothing then it isn’t? Completely IRRELEVANT.
1324417373349142528 2020-11-06 02:24:42 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Sometimes you guys are so damn obsessed with being able to demonstrate cognitive dissonance that that's all it becomes about. Guess what, there's plenty of us out there capable of holding 2 or more conflicting thoughts in our head at the same time. It ain't special.
1324417101117808641 2020-11-06 02:23:38 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Dude, Alex. We all get that. But what's going on here isn't that case and you know it. Stop just blindly accepting this narrative as a done deal and start asking the real questions.
1324416018895138816 2020-11-06 02:19:20 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader In Nevada of all places. This such gutter level bullshit at this point and they're complicit in this insanity.
1324415055866155008 2020-11-06 02:15:30 +0800 <__i960> @JackPosobiec Just start arresting people. The American people will not be fucked around like this.
1324414584032161792 2020-11-06 02:13:37 +0800 <__i960> WHY IS THIS SUCH AN ISSUE FOR THEM TO SIMPLY OBSERVE?
1324404558940971009 2020-11-06 01:33:47 +0800 <__i960> If they steal this election, that's it, you will never see anything remotely resembling a realistic election again. This cannot be accepted like this - sore losers etc ignore all that stuff. Take it all the way to the supreme court.
1324397513302966272 2020-11-06 01:05:47 +0800 <__i960> @RubinReport Millions of people's lives upturned and thousands of businesses destroyed by this Dave. This is not something we should be celebrating one bit. This is something that should be having people picking up pitchforks.
1324393944743137280 2020-11-06 00:51:37 +0800 <__i960> These motherfuckers used covid fear mongering and lock downs to destroy 10,000s of businesses and millions of lives to simply try and engineer the political outcome we're seeing right now and we're all going to sit here and ACCEPT THIS?
1324390725191004160 2020-11-06 00:38:49 +0800 <__i960> @JoshAnimator @stillgray I'm getting Kshama Sawant vibes from her.
1324389400415854594 2020-11-06 00:33:33 +0800 <__i960> @TRHLofficial @FrogFromTheWell B&amp;RP!
1324389193183719424 2020-11-06 00:32:44 +0800 <__i960> @EssentialBusin7 @Bryan_E_Leib @realDonaldTrump Notice "Something Else" and "None" percentages? Not surprising at all.
1324386006473170945 2020-11-06 00:20:04 +0800 <__i960> @EarlNoahBernsby And now with Gascon in play, no one should move within 50 miles of that shit hole.
1324379185616310278 2020-11-05 23:52:58 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero He’s gonna start doing MA crosses and heikin-ashi next.
1324378367714496512 2020-11-05 23:49:43 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson If you think antifa won’t be immediately dealt with by various national guard or even military entities I don’t know what to tell you. There’s a reason Trump didn’t go balls out a few months ago and it was the election.
1324370574794059777 2020-11-05 23:18:45 +0800 <__i960> @AdamInHTownTX @Annakhait It's almost like there's a common element in play.
1324356897277845505 2020-11-05 22:24:24 +0800 <__i960> @TrumpJew The thing about dems/left, is that their entire worldview is oriented around "my perspective is the correct one, yours is wrong/uneducated/uninformed/unrefined" with everything emanating from there.
1324356426735607808 2020-11-05 22:22:32 +0800 <__i960> @ggreenwald Libertarian voters: "I'd rather be right, than win."
1324350121140654081 2020-11-05 21:57:28 +0800 <__i960> @alexplitsas Nice man. CnR or kept? All our stripers have been making their annual migration back into the bay/delta.
1324347789732540420 2020-11-05 21:48:12 +0800 <__i960> @DrewHolden360 Fait accompli
1324347593598513158 2020-11-05 21:47:26 +0800 <__i960> @kerpen You’re asking for something that would provide rational data and hence insight as to where we are and where we might be.  This is precisely why they’re not giving it to you.
1324347163460055044 2020-11-05 21:45:43 +0800 <__i960> @Zigmanfreud All by design.
1324341100555825152 2020-11-05 21:21:38 +0800 <__i960> @DenverBizGuy Their party just needs to fracture and die. Americans also need to stop simply going along with whatever they throw out there but I have no confidence that’ll happen. They’re too cucked.
1324338498850058241 2020-11-05 21:11:17 +0800 <__i960> @BlueDogLA @gummibear737 @gklegal99 I am a California native. I know what she’s about. Yes she is not a radical leftist burning the flag in the street but she is posting videos of equality of outcome which is more than just a little progressive than Biden. She’s also race obsessed and has zero integrity.
1324219438191632386 2020-11-05 13:18:11 +0800 <__i960> @Que_Sais_Je_99 @Steve_Sailer Its a market, guess they'll be forced to change their offer because the bid ain't hitting it.
1324218783276306433 2020-11-05 13:15:35 +0800 <__i960> @KarlThorburn She seems to forget that we don't grow corn, wheat, and soybeans in uRbAn cEntErS. Just starve these fucks out.
1324208824731856896 2020-11-05 12:36:01 +0800 <__i960> @SR71999 It was always such an intellectually vapid take (usually coming out of the galaxy brained centrist sphere).
1324203122474901504 2020-11-05 12:13:21 +0800 <__i960> @TheMattBeebe @EWErickson It’s basically smug-code for “told ya so.”
1324202317629988869 2020-11-05 12:10:09 +0800 <__i960> @FreakCountry76 @greta I’m sure the bankers who provide the “instant money” will find a way to make a penny off that one too.

1324201546339381254 2020-11-05 12:07:05 +0800 <__i960> @jessdvd1 @kylamb8 You can take the win but you should be absolutely furious by how it was attained. Millions of people’s lives have been uprooted by the forced reaction to this virus and now the mask is coming off.
1324200029821677573 2020-11-05 12:01:04 +0800 <__i960> @DickHippo @LegendaryEnergy It’s only through playing the root in a lower register that we can save this country. 🤡
1324199149529542656 2020-11-05 11:57:34 +0800 <__i960> @TechForcePrime @LegendaryEnergy I always find it amusing how these so called radical centrists try so hard to make it apparent how much nuance they can see in things and it’s their solemn duty to inform all their followers of said intellectual discoveries. They all seem to be demographically similar too.
1324198078228819969 2020-11-05 11:53:18 +0800 <__i960> @FreakCountry76 Are these guys even funny anymore? I haven’t read them for years and think there’s a strong correlation where their quality dropped off and a certain someone was elected.
1324197565366067201 2020-11-05 11:51:16 +0800 <__i960> @AlejandroPotre1 @kylamb8 Does it matter though? Will the vast majority of Chicagoans who basically want to be distracted until their dying day even do anything about it? Nope.
1324197112267984896 2020-11-05 11:49:28 +0800 <__i960> @jessdvd1 @kylamb8 See this is the problem with you folks. You’ll “take this win” after getting fucked over for 6+ months even knowing full well what’s going on here. How much more will you trade?
1324193728190271489 2020-11-05 11:36:01 +0800 <__i960> @unitedstateser @chiIIum @gretchenbarton No. Let’s.
1324192729400705027 2020-11-05 11:32:03 +0800 <__i960> @BobQuarantine @thehill AZ, NV. The fuck happened to these places?
1324191983707975680 2020-11-05 11:29:05 +0800 <__i960> @meganmesserly @the1codemonkey Apparently incredibly difficult to tally the votes for some reason meanwhile Florida was done yesterday without a hitch. Complete joke.

1324189343678803970 2020-11-05 11:18:36 +0800 <__i960> @WGNNews You’ve been played folks. The worst part though? You’ll accept it because you value security more than liberty.
1324189116058140673 2020-11-05 11:17:42 +0800 <__i960> @ChampionLigma The problem with Americans is that they don’t know war.

1324185517848621057 2020-11-05 11:03:24 +0800 <__i960> @AUChizad 300 million guns and its not the libs who have a monopoly on em either. Sure would be a shame to start seeing some of them used, eh? I’m all out of fucks for the humanity of leftists.
1324185234561146880 2020-11-05 11:02:16 +0800 <__i960> @GovtZombie @kerpen Lol yes. And the best part is they’ll do it right in your face. You know why? Because Americans just want to be comfortable and get their required dopamine hits each day without actually fighting for anything. They’re willing to accept tyranny as long as they get security.
1324184473722707968 2020-11-05 10:59:15 +0800 <__i960> @ApoSa888 @JoeBiden The Dem motto is “whatever it takes” and unfortunately the only way to fight this is either extensive legislation safeguarding against it or alternatively taking them head on with the same nonsense. Sadly it doesn’t seem anyone’s interested in the former.

1324179790589382657 2020-11-05 10:40:38 +0800 <__i960> Meanwhile China and India are laughing in your face. How long until you and Kamala plan to start pumping in the H1B’s as well?
1324179184487288832 2020-11-05 10:38:14 +0800 <__i960> @EWErickson You guys keep thinking we have this free and fair republic. I know it’s hard but just accept that it isn’t what you think.

1324175900355649537 2020-11-05 10:25:11 +0800 <__i960> Almost comical if so many lives weren’t destroyed in the process. You’ve been played America.

1324150171404414978 2020-11-05 08:42:57 +0800 <__i960> @Dragonlawyer2 @ZacBissonnette Well to be honest, if he wins, why would they? Covid is no longer useful to them at that point.
1324149909465952256 2020-11-05 08:41:54 +0800 <__i960> @ZacBissonnette What's Biden winning have to do with keeping schools closed? If they did indeed reopen them in unison you should be screaming from the rooftops about it, not celebrating it.
1324148437110067200 2020-11-05 08:36:03 +0800 <__i960> @stone_toss 3. Trump loss is explained away with some leftist narrative about character or personality and they double down on #2 for the next one.

1324140279671054336 2020-11-05 08:03:38 +0800 <__i960> @DarrenJBeattie "If the president doesn't speak up, I'll have no choice but to accept the narrative being served to me!"

1324125394769899520 2020-11-05 07:04:29 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom As far as the domestic issues go we’ve seen the woke left building in determination from back when even Obama was president. They will not stop, mark my words. This is institutionally burned into them.
1324124845789995009 2020-11-05 07:02:18 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom China. Who’s going to do something about China? This isn’t just about domestic issues there are very real foreign policy threats of which Joe and Kamala basically have no real position on.
1324121944501841921 2020-11-05 06:50:47 +0800 <__i960> @KingofLast @derekahunter The narrative's always gotta be framed in a way that it's Trump "stealing" something from Biden if things flip around. They know exactly what they're doing when they push this narrative as well.

1324118187491782658 2020-11-05 06:35:51 +0800 <__i960> @JoeBiden False. Your terms are acceptable.
1324118005069025280 2020-11-05 06:35:07 +0800 <__i960> @beardedmiguel I honestly do not believe that Hanlon's always applies with these folks. They aren't that dumb.
1324110989130780673 2020-11-05 06:07:15 +0800 <__i960> @Tru_rises_alt Works fine for me, you sure the post wasn't deleted, but still visible in yours or someone else's timeline?
1324106544049369089 2020-11-05 05:49:35 +0800 <__i960> @xBenJamminx WTF happened to NV anyways? 2004 was the last time it was red, right?
1324105736792678400 2020-11-05 05:46:23 +0800 <__i960> @tout_le_monde1 @luismen1991 Yep, one of the bigger threats in all of this, but even legitimate dem types voting for Biden think "everything will be fine" with basically zero foreign policy considerations.
1324102647415144449 2020-11-05 05:34:06 +0800 <__i960> They've spent the last 4 years basically fighting 2016, why would they ever stop? I see no reason to break bread with them now, either.
1324096759103016962 2020-11-05 05:10:42 +0800 <__i960> @KFILE Irrelevant.
1324095918006693889 2020-11-05 05:07:22 +0800 <__i960> @EWErickson Yeah I’ve heard additional shifts is just this completely galaxy brain concept that only applies to amazon warehouses. I mean it’s only a national election, why staff up heavy for it?
1324095394771468288 2020-11-05 05:05:17 +0800 <__i960> @aubrey_huff Nope, everyone saw it coming.
1324094511350386688 2020-11-05 05:01:46 +0800 <__i960> @DrewHolden360 That dude is so incredibly insufferable. One of the worst.
1324092389137379328 2020-11-05 04:53:20 +0800 <__i960> One of the problems the right is that they don’t take into account just how fucking devious their opposition actually is. Or alternatively just don’t fight back against it at the same level. It shouldn’t be required in the first place but enough is enough.
1324091783588933633 2020-11-05 04:50:56 +0800 <__i960> Honestly even if this thing has to go all the way to the Supreme Court and is decided by them, but viewed as “ignoring the will of the American people” (it isn’t), I don’t care. This is war.
1324083556579078144 2020-11-05 04:18:14 +0800 <__i960> Correction it was an AP reporter they were talking to but whatever might as well be the same thing at this point.
1324082971385634816 2020-11-05 04:15:55 +0800 <__i960> NPR talking to Wisconsin officials and you can just hear the little hint of glee in their voices.
1324079736302100480 2020-11-05 04:03:04 +0800 <__i960> @RealWriteWinger Fait accompli
1324077151033806848 2020-11-05 03:52:47 +0800 <__i960> @maggmountains Liberties taken will not be restored to the same state they were before it.
1324076796992581632 2020-11-05 03:51:23 +0800 <__i960> @MGB39753597 @RebelACole @gummibear737 10 hours later and look where we are. A complete fucking joke.
1324063407587295234 2020-11-05 02:58:10 +0800 <__i960> @Phillygirl741 @luismen1991 Yeah but not everywhere else? It’s like saying only this state is lazy but really loves mail in voting.
1324054952495308800 2020-11-05 02:24:35 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero It is my dream to see BLMers descend on this guy’s house and demand compliance.
1324049000488562688 2020-11-05 02:00:56 +0800 <__i960> @NumbersMuncher @Popehat Ah yes because the 2016 election was exactly the same as the 2020 election. False equivalences as usual.
1324045608542330880 2020-11-05 01:47:27 +0800 <__i960> @Bubba321B @redsteeze You won’t gain your liberty back.
1324045222641192960 2020-11-05 01:45:55 +0800 <__i960> @bclund Any improvement or holding steady with no decline, basically?
1324044150396784640 2020-11-05 01:41:39 +0800 <__i960> @KatyaSedgwick @JennyChachan @CNBC 109 *legalizes* "therapeutic" use of psilocybin. 110 *decriminalizes* possession of small amounts of various hard drugs, but does not legalize them. Manufacture or larger amounts not decriminalized.
1324039292239241218 2020-11-05 01:22:21 +0800 <__i960> There is no reasoning with these folks, only one method left.
1324038323225030656 2020-11-05 01:18:30 +0800 <__i960> @TimTravis2 All one long arm of CCP influence through one avenue or another. Happening in real time.
1324020615871832064 2020-11-05 00:08:08 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson A “mistake.” Cmon Alex you 100% know it was intentional. Hanlon’s razor simply just doesn’t apply with these folks.
1323907392862474240 2020-11-04 16:38:14 +0800 <__i960> @jonsaxon67 @SamHarrisOrg @RichardDawkins I had to unfollow him because it was just getting too ridiculous.
1323906157874835456 2020-11-04 16:33:19 +0800 <__i960> @diegooo__03 @MaxeyWen @felipe6shooter @AlexBerenson If only there were some magical way we could have people working past midnight.
1323905232166768640 2020-11-04 16:29:38 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson Never gonna happen Alex. Stop offering your hand to the dog that bites you every single time.
1323903672695152640 2020-11-04 16:23:27 +0800 <__i960> @beardedmiguel They’ll interpret everything in bad faith. You know how it is.
1323901494064656384 2020-11-04 16:14:47 +0800 <__i960> @SwipeWright 3/4 of the stuff that’s happened in 2020 has been purely within our control overall. Think about it.
1323899104154411010 2020-11-04 16:05:17 +0800 <__i960> @Rationalist69 Stop the counting of *new* votes not legitimate votes.

1323891275716653059 2020-11-04 15:34:11 +0800 <__i960> @TeachOrSwim @stratsoattack @aayoub Because some are so clearly obvious in not being contested that there’s no point? Fraud isn’t happening at the 10% different level. It’s happening at the 1% level.
1323891003573506048 2020-11-04 15:33:06 +0800 <__i960> @kerry14c @stratsoattack @aayoub They are going in there to challenge the COUNTERS. Jesus you people are just perpetually unhinged.
1323890615319293952 2020-11-04 15:31:34 +0800 <__i960> @augustePDX @stratsoattack @aayoub BLM in profile. Moron confirmed.
1323887575040319489 2020-11-04 15:19:29 +0800 <__i960> @stratsoattack @aayoub Every *valid* vote counts. They’re not going in there to falsely declare votes as invalid. They’re there to determine what is and isn’t actually legally valid.
1323886592176447488 2020-11-04 15:15:34 +0800 <__i960> @arneduncan Traitor.
1323880538130718720 2020-11-04 14:51:31 +0800 <__i960> @ricardo_rudd @stillgray Indeed. But once one realizes that they actually want the abuse by nature then it all makes sense. “I’m tired of this shit and I want to be better” is a language not spoken there.
1323879716869214210 2020-11-04 14:48:15 +0800 <__i960> @stillgray Shit hole that wants to remain a shit hole. What else is new.
1323879481652621312 2020-11-04 14:47:19 +0800 <__i960> @Howling2015 @redsteeze So bring in the next shift. This is a presidential election here.
1323878629655277568 2020-11-04 14:43:56 +0800 <__i960> @GrowtheFKUP Quick on the draw for Biden. Completely drawn out for Trump. Media == enemy.
1323877936244563968 2020-11-04 14:41:11 +0800 <__i960> @802Patriot @heathmcdonald60 @SanBernadino68 @davidharsanyi @seanmdav I think what he’s saying is that it’d be pretty clearly fraud because the statistical spread would be obviously skewed towards the dems.
1323866469038321665 2020-11-04 13:55:37 +0800 <__i960> @vortmax79 @ClayTravis Absolutely. Look how quick on the draw they were with Virginia but how cautious they were with Florida even when it was completely obvious Trump had it.
1323865932054159360 2020-11-04 13:53:29 +0800 <__i960> @maggmountains Set the stage. Poison the well.
1323865822356385795 2020-11-04 13:53:02 +0800 <__i960> Happening right in front of our eyes in real time. They’ll do *whatever it takes* to ensure Trump doesn’t have a second term.
1323865272231456768 2020-11-04 13:50:51 +0800 <__i960> @GlenWalken @AWasdovitch @Peoples_Pundit @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Casting doubt is all part of the plan.
1323864844127281152 2020-11-04 13:49:09 +0800 <__i960> The MSM is the absolute enemy of the people. I cannot express it enough how disingenuous these entities are. Complete and utter lack of integrity.
1323864613243420672 2020-11-04 13:48:14 +0800 <__i960> @BjorkDarryl He didn’t but poisoning the well is good enough for him.
1323864468355387392 2020-11-04 13:47:40 +0800 <__i960> Here comes the part where the media sows doubt into the process by preemptively acting as if Biden is the true winner so when it’s determined he actually isn’t the damage has already been done.
1323863978913669120 2020-11-04 13:45:43 +0800 <__i960> @risitasfanclub @BNONews Complete joke state that needs to crumble on itself in order to learn the error of its ways. I feel bad for people outside the tri-county area that aren’t about turning their state into an open air drug market.
1323863559806148608 2020-11-04 13:44:03 +0800 <__i960> @lyndseyfifield Because this is the part where the MSM starts pretending Biden has already won so they’ve got to take a fait accompli approach to ensuring it’s so.
1323862742764199937 2020-11-04 13:40:48 +0800 <__i960> @ChadGar40522734 @tomselliott @cenkuygur Rules for me and rules for thee. On brand for these goons.
1323862389129793538 2020-11-04 13:39:24 +0800 <__i960> @greatesteverMD @tomselliott @redsteeze @cenkuygur @realDonaldTrump These people derive their self esteem from all this identitarian nonsense. It all makes sense once you realize it’s all about them. All of it.
1323861920684781568 2020-11-04 13:37:32 +0800 <__i960> @tomselliott @cenkuygur Gotta love the “man the corporate democrats and mainstream media suck at this” comment. It shows full well what they depend on and t sure the fuck isn’t the truth.
1323848393764995073 2020-11-04 12:43:47 +0800 <__i960> @AWilliams61 @DC_Draino Gonna take time to print ‘em up.
1323847185591496706 2020-11-04 12:38:59 +0800 <__i960> @themodalice That’s not to say they don’t have some solid people (Tucker) but the network enjoys playing both sides in an advantageous (rather than fair) fashion.
1323847002048794625 2020-11-04 12:38:15 +0800 <__i960> @themodalice It was always fake news.
1323846757428547585 2020-11-04 12:37:17 +0800 <__i960> @ihatethemedia Mass importation of lib-think to red areas. It’ll keep happening too.
1323841318745894913 2020-11-04 12:15:40 +0800 <__i960> @1KatieOrr Good. This prop needs to die and never return.
1323840381507661824 2020-11-04 12:11:57 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader For when you just can’t get enough of livejasmin, right @IronFlies ?
1323840126489751553 2020-11-04 12:10:56 +0800 <__i960> @thebradfordfile Right at the 8pm pacific poll close too.
1323839739028402176 2020-11-04 12:09:24 +0800 <__i960> What else is new. The entire west coast will keep producing the same bullshit over and over even with large amounts of red counties within each.
1323839142577332225 2020-11-04 12:07:01 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader Try closing your 700 tabs.
1323834193177014272 2020-11-04 11:47:21 +0800 <__i960> @TrumpJew Good. Fuck em.
1323827695516409857 2020-11-04 11:21:32 +0800 <__i960> It’s all Bernie’s fault.
1323827516709113856 2020-11-04 11:20:50 +0800 <__i960> @acczibit Thoroughly incapable of self-reflection.
1323826977577398274 2020-11-04 11:18:41 +0800 <__i960> They still don’t get it.
1323826646588121088 2020-11-04 11:17:22 +0800 <__i960> @robbysoave How dare you say we should start thinking of each other as fellow Americans, Robby!

1323820753083535360 2020-11-04 10:53:57 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader Spoiler: that dude ends up being on top of the list.
1323820590352904192 2020-11-04 10:53:18 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @1_lot_hero If you don’t give me 3/4 of all that alcohol and whatever sneakers in the closet that might fit me then you’re a bigot!
1323817455299391488 2020-11-04 10:40:51 +0800 <__i960> @adamhousley I feel ya dude but it’s almost like you’re asking a bunch of deviant shitlords “can we please have some integrity?”
1323816824140541953 2020-11-04 10:38:20 +0800 <__i960> @primalpoly Absolutely not, atleast not voluntarily. Like hard core leftists there is no coming back. They either are forced to evolve or they’re done.
1323816105744347136 2020-11-04 10:35:29 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies Head to @1_lot_hero ‘s place and throw bullets at them instead.
1323815921903828992 2020-11-04 10:34:45 +0800 <__i960> Blame it on the Cubans.

1323805526635892737 2020-11-04 09:53:27 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson Polls have a hard time when there’s a huge chunk of people who know what the purpose of the polls are for. It’s almost like an automatic information war simply by denying them info.
1323801145249202176 2020-11-04 09:36:02 +0800 <__i960> @philllosoraptor Let’s not start sucking each other’s dicks quite yet.
1323790970819809281 2020-11-04 08:55:36 +0800 <__i960> What’s the least lib heavy election coverage streaming on YouTube right now (yeah, I know)?
1323787597764722688 2020-11-04 08:42:12 +0800 <__i960> Has the MSM called it for Biden yet? We all know they only need 1% of the vote before running with it if it’s dem favor.
1323782395057774592 2020-11-04 08:21:32 +0800 <__i960> @DennisAndSpace This sounds like a panic attack man. If you thought you were going to die out of the blue but nothing really got worse than that then it’s likely to be all anxiety driven. BP, as well.

1323757678204575745 2020-11-04 06:43:19 +0800 <__i960> @tomselliott I actually did get what he was generally talking about but he was pretty squirrelly getting there. Not well.
1323755496856150016 2020-11-04 06:34:39 +0800 <__i960> @LibertateaPirat @tomselliott No, they're voting for Kamala.
1323754723451695110 2020-11-04 06:31:34 +0800 <__i960> @Kat5Kl @rikemohome @stillgray I'm not a fan of what this guy did at all, but there's nothing about "making false statements" when it comes to free speech, especially when he didn't do it as part of an active investigation, e.g. trolling on the internet.
1323754237566709761 2020-11-04 06:29:39 +0800 <__i960> @Dj_lili59 @TomFitton Not required in all states (yes, it's insane).
1323750906614042624 2020-11-04 06:16:24 +0800 <__i960> Mayor of SF calling PA voters? How about worry about your own town lady, lord knows it's got more than enough problems to go around.
1323750734781796353 2020-11-04 06:15:43 +0800 <__i960> Honestly, I find it more sad than humorous at this point, particularly the way his party is going right along with it too.
1323749237654368256 2020-11-04 06:09:46 +0800 <__i960> @craigzimmerman6 @WEschenbach We've also done the most amount of testing in the world, period - and this isn't just a Trump talking point.

1323743183692419072 2020-11-04 05:45:43 +0800 <__i960> @inteldotwav It boggles my mind how this type of stuff doesn’t fall into common carrier status. Conceptually the hosting provider or intermediaries are doing the exact same thing a telco is doing just at a higher layer of the stack and without reproviding content of their own.
1323726997068021760 2020-11-04 04:41:24 +0800 <__i960> @Califas619 @UVeteran81 Nothing in that bmj article other than someone questioning it.

1323647941664370689 2020-11-03 23:27:16 +0800 <__i960> @ConceptualJames They just can’t do it James. This is what you get when identity is so inextricably tied to the character of their preferred candidate.
1323645091106316290 2020-11-03 23:15:56 +0800 <__i960> You're all talk.
1323644600775397378 2020-11-03 23:13:59 +0800 <__i960> @acczibit We got a live one here fellas:  https://t.co/FdF2WCnAu2
1323642241865273346 2020-11-03 23:04:37 +0800 <__i960> @spacefracking @acczibit So many of these "scene kid" types in the industry too. When push comes to shove you won't be able to rely on these people at all and the ones who really know their shit aren't obsessively wasting their time on various cons.
1323639759483252736 2020-11-03 22:54:45 +0800 <__i960> These people are insufferable.  https://t.co/PXOnYr69e8

1323499477685071873 2020-11-03 13:37:19 +0800 <__i960> @BillFOXLA @LACoSheriff @FOXLA Good. Enough of this bullshit.
1323480316841922560 2020-11-03 12:21:11 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain Yep. This narcissist absolutely exudes fakeness - which is why she was universally loathed by both Ds and Rs, yet here we are.
1323480071345106944 2020-11-03 12:20:12 +0800 <__i960> @RealBrandonDonk They didn't even check my ID when I voted in person.

1323477051714625537 2020-11-03 12:08:12 +0800 <__i960> @BobQuarantine @Bernies4thHouse You and I know this, but don't assume the general public shares the same insight or observational skills as to what's really going on.
1323476712282206209 2020-11-03 12:06:51 +0800 <__i960> @BobQuarantine @JGuez55 The issue is that "there's no reason for an incumbent to be losing against such a weak candidate" assumes a fair playing field - and it's anything but that.
1323476474259668992 2020-11-03 12:05:55 +0800 <__i960> @BobQuarantine @JGuez55 I agree with the core tenants of what you're trying to say, for sure, but I think you're discounting the real power of modern media and all the associated establishment forces out there that are 100% working against this guy from the very start.
1323475881017319425 2020-11-03 12:03:33 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain What's sick about it is that people so much desire a "return to normalcy" but what they really want is the comfortable drug of being ripped off and taken advantage of as a matter of course - because that's what they know. "I demand a familiar fleecing."
1323471539753291776 2020-11-03 11:46:18 +0800 <__i960> But remember folks. A vote for Biden is showing the establishment you mean business. 😂
1323470096040226816 2020-11-03 11:40:34 +0800 <__i960> @IsItTimeForA @BrandonStraka Prejudice in the conceptual sense of course. If the riots are so widespread that they’re threatening the stability of the nation well then insurrection it is.
1323469790002868230 2020-11-03 11:39:21 +0800 <__i960> @IsItTimeForA @BrandonStraka I’m not worried about riots if the riots are part of a Trump win. They can be shut down with severe prejudice if needed.
1323462311730798592 2020-11-03 11:09:38 +0800 <__i960> @Tyler_The_Wise Hawkish but you voted no on 20?
1323457167437963264 2020-11-03 10:49:12 +0800 <__i960> @sofiabitela @Orange_Blue_Red @snorman1776 @AlexBerenson @RealClearNews That's the way it's supposed to work in this market-place of ideas and policies. Dems brought bad policies and approaches to a myriad of issues and people are pushing back with their votes. Nobody is wed to a party.
1323454533557653507 2020-11-03 10:38:44 +0800 <__i960> @Orange_Blue_Red @snorman1776 @AlexBerenson @RealClearNews Good. They deserve to lose bigly and be absolutely punished for these lockdowns which have outright destroyed the economy.
1323454131097358337 2020-11-03 10:37:08 +0800 <__i960> @ChickinSanDiego @senatormelendez It’s just *that* which was voided. He’s done more than 50 since the state of emergency began. He’s now barred from making any new ones which override the legislature though.
1323417737012498432 2020-11-03 08:12:31 +0800 <__i960> @tlsday1p1 @JasonEMaggard @KevinKileyCA Absolutely and that part is of course very important in its own right.
1323407234659880960 2020-11-03 07:30:47 +0800 <__i960> @poltavian @AlexBerenson Weak men make for hard times. They’ve simply had it too good for too long which is why they don’t realize just how great a country we actually are at a core level.
1323405875059388416 2020-11-03 07:25:22 +0800 <__i960> @PragmaticElle @jackthere @JackPosobiec I voted today in a deep blue state and they didn’t say anything about my republican status. No issues really and I verified first hand they tore up my surrendered mail-in ballot before voting.
1323404282398269440 2020-11-03 07:19:03 +0800 <__i960> @nightsky20201 @HutamaQ2 @RudyHavenstein It's even better when you think about the raw moral hazards of all this by having lawmakers (and the public as well), heavily beholden to keeping the music going for as long as possible. "Why aren't you doing anything about this?" "Because we benefit from it."
1323403658755649536 2020-11-03 07:16:34 +0800 <__i960> @DailySignal Hey @1_lot_hero when were you gonna tell us you were actively deployed to Afghanistan?
1323403102066597889 2020-11-03 07:14:21 +0800 <__i960> @nightsky20201 @HutamaQ2 Honestly if you look deep enough, everything goes back to the Fed in some form or fashion. Ain't that right, @RudyHavenstein ?
1323400913067728897 2020-11-03 07:05:39 +0800 <__i960> @JasonEMaggard @KevinKileyCA As far as existing EOs go, the only thing I can see is that N-67-20 has been immediately voided, per the ruling.
1323400544874979328 2020-11-03 07:04:12 +0800 <__i960> @senatormelendez  https://t.co/lfh6Ky7mtu
1323400370484207616 2020-11-03 07:03:30 +0800 <__i960> @senatormelendez It does immediately void N-67-20 though:  "Executive Order N-67-20 issued by the Governor on June 3, 2020 is void as an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power and shall be of no further force or effect."
1323397066798759936 2020-11-03 06:50:22 +0800 <__i960> @BrianGoodlife @senatormelendez Oh I'm sure they'll still try to go down that road, not to mention Newsom and friends might also try and appeal this decision.
1323396566078517249 2020-11-03 06:48:23 +0800 <__i960> @SaltmeadowGroup @senatormelendez LOL, have you even been paying attention to Europe?
1323394792064053249 2020-11-03 06:41:20 +0800 <__i960> This is awesome.
1323384551960322048 2020-11-03 06:00:39 +0800 <__i960> @boriquagato It’s amazing because you’d figure this is the most basic thing to actually catch if one wants accurate statistics yet here we are.
1323376884533485568 2020-11-03 05:30:11 +0800 <__i960> @emilylhauser Insufferable garbage.
1323375376953827328 2020-11-03 05:24:11 +0800 <__i960> And all according to plan.
1323374960878911488 2020-11-03 05:22:32 +0800 <__i960> @Heminator These people do not believe in agency, self-determination, or responsibility. It's right in their wheelhouse to be blaming everyone else for their psychosis.
1323370632847872000 2020-11-03 05:05:20 +0800 <__i960> @KnomadikT @AP Sorry dude, you're responsible for your own actions. That's how it works in the real world.
1323370471002304512 2020-11-03 05:04:41 +0800 <__i960> @SageRobinson @AP Notice they're the one actually running a business.
1323370216030523393 2020-11-03 05:03:41 +0800 <__i960> @JbissellF @AP Nice gaslight. It's clearly obvious to everyone where the violence is actually coming from, champ.
1323369179353772033 2020-11-03 04:59:34 +0800 <__i960> @HylanderPaul @OccamRamon Totally.. 90% of this toxic friendship and cutting off stuff is coming from the left. It's completely inline with how they view everything else in the world.
1323367970576330752 2020-11-03 04:54:45 +0800 <__i960> This is what Democrats refer to as "creating jobs" and "stimulating the economy":
1323361985493299201 2020-11-03 04:30:58 +0800 <__i960> That pesky tolerant left again. How dare their “Trump” friends have their own views. Clearly the only solution is complete annihilation of friendship:  https://t.co/yuQt4rveEY
1323360737771757568 2020-11-03 04:26:01 +0800 <__i960> @bclund Remember using the dot matrix printers to print out super long ass banners and put them up in the classroom?
1323344063806910464 2020-11-03 03:19:46 +0800 <__i960> @exjon "I'd rather be right than win!"
1323342996050305024 2020-11-03 03:15:31 +0800 <__i960> @MealeTheo @django2310 @BryanDeanWright These kind of replies (and the other unhinged ones in this thread) perfectly validate the original tweet.
1323341386045743104 2020-11-03 03:09:07 +0800 <__i960> @jordanhroga Absolutely no cancelling here either way you vote. The right has strong convictions but they're not going to brow-beat you into agreeing with them or *cancelling* you over a difference of political viewpoint. Today's republican party is closer to classical liberalism than dems.
1323338586352091137 2020-11-03 02:58:00 +0800 <__i960> Just went and voted in person (Trump of course). While it was fairy painless (I got there 30 mins after open) I can for-see with all the covid precautions and the like that the lines could be brutal tomorrow. If you don't want to be in line until midnight I suggest voting ASAP.
1323314582891372544 2020-11-03 01:22:37 +0800 <__i960> @ScottAdamsSays Younger coworkers with entitlement complexes who don’t seem to understand that respect is earned.
1323312688823300097 2020-11-03 01:15:05 +0800 <__i960> A vote for dems is a vote for an authoritarian nanny state that wants to treat everyone like children. We are not about bowing down to authoritarian control of every facet of our lives and being told how to speak, act, and live.
1323311247312347137 2020-11-03 01:09:21 +0800 <__i960> @GenericBobSmith @JerryDunleavy @neontaster Not to mention "it's approach has given space"... Who the fuck cares, report on the actual facts as they relate to China's handling of the virus, not how political parties here are reacting to it.
1323310838116069379 2020-11-03 01:07:44 +0800 <__i960> @awstar11 Doesn't matter, these folks are part of the hit'n'run disinformation squad and they know exactly what they're doing.
1323309640306712576 2020-11-03 01:02:58 +0800 <__i960> LOL, standard lib approach. "Don't worry, we're just gonna make a couple of changes that probably won't affect you."
1323308542330236929 2020-11-03 00:58:37 +0800 <__i960> @trump_nasty These people are so incredibly pot committed to their various causes it'll be virtually impossible to get them to see otherwise. No idea what to do with these folks other than starve them of power, as they just won't leave people alone.
1323306252466757632 2020-11-03 00:49:31 +0800 <__i960> @JohnWDean It says we live amongst leftist criminal assholes that need to be dealt with.
1323278282985361408 2020-11-02 22:58:22 +0800 <__i960> You guys have been beating this horse for close to 50 years now. If you want to help, just dissolve your party of low expectations, coddling, and enablement and go do something else.
1323152567824646144 2020-11-02 14:38:49 +0800 <__i960> @JackFell13 @JdogPitler Maybe this time we’ll get to go full insurrection mode and deal with it for real.
1323146554086100992 2020-11-02 14:14:56 +0800 <__i960> @nbcbayarea How is sending in lawyers to review votes in swing states an “attack?”

1323141128120528896 2020-11-02 13:53:22 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson @realDonaldTrump This is how the “factual” media works. Report only the “facts” they want you to hear. It’s been going on for years now, decades.

1323124458781995009 2020-11-02 12:47:08 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom I'll be voting no on 16, yes on 20, and 22 tomorrow. In the meantime the pro-16 people can eat a dick:  https://t.co/D3uR6XNBm4

1323081895215706115 2020-11-02 09:58:00 +0800 <__i960> They willfully gaslight like this knowing full well that most won't ever read past the headlines, all the while knowing they're lying as they're doing it. Media == enemy.  https://t.co/I0ivkOx4lB

1322986673018335232 2020-11-02 03:39:37 +0800 <__i960> What about the leftist violence epidemic, Joe? Did you forget all about June onwards? No sane supporter of 2A would agree with this garbage.

1322981137552044034 2020-11-02 03:17:37 +0800 <__i960> Amazing "victim blaming" coming from this guy. It is you, citizen, who is part of the problem speaking your mean words which clearly contributes to these people wanting to behead you in the street and not the fact that they will actually try to behead you in the street.

1322929267840225285 2020-11-01 23:51:30 +0800 <__i960> @jenneraub This isn't the first time it's happened either, just look at the Agnos -&gt; Jordan transition in '92 and the whole Camp Agnos thing, where the city finally woke up and said enough of this bullshit. Sadly today's nutcase:pragmatic ratio is even higher, although so is SF craziness.
1322928226457448448 2020-11-01 23:47:22 +0800 <__i960> @jenneraub They have just about completely destroyed SF through these "well-meaning" (not really) policies that merely serve the political and activist class while everyone else gets to deal with the fallout. They take it to the absolute breaking point before enough people finally wake up.
1322927715733827584 2020-11-01 23:45:20 +0800 <__i960> @jenneraub And all the various "social" industries in dem-strongholds are simply dopamine feel good vectors for most of these ivory tower libs who want the feeling of helping out without bearing any of the real long term social costs. In essence their entire approach is self-centered.
1322927352431570944 2020-11-01 23:43:54 +0800 <__i960> @jenneraub The problem, in my mind, is that modern liberals (don't take this the wrong way if you're one), seem to prefer a never ending cycle of abuse, both giving and receiving (for a variety of reasons). Things like "stop enabling this" or simple tough love seem to be foreign concepts.
1322917872360804353 2020-11-01 23:06:14 +0800 <__i960> @Sfstreets415 Meanwhile the road itself is 3rd world quality. Wonder if they’ll actually deal with that or continue the never ending war on cars.

1322760635969540096 2020-11-01 12:41:25 +0800 <__i960> @MarquisDeMarche Notice how the MSM is basically totally absent on the coverage of these events, almost as if they don't want to lend any legitimacy to the fact that people are pissed off? Media == enemy of the people as usual.
1322740627939840000 2020-11-01 11:21:55 +0800 <__i960> @CaliConserv1 I do actually and I’m waiting to see if anything major happens after the election to revisit that perception.
1322732035060891649 2020-11-01 10:47:46 +0800 <__i960> Remember back in the beginning of October where libs were actually wishing death on ole Donald? Now he’s out there I’m doing 5 rallies a day all the way to the finish line.

1322540975898517504 2020-10-31 22:08:34 +0800 <__i960> @nuanceislost @BretWeinstein You can be annoyed by his personality all day. Not all of us supporters care for it either. But if you believe in the ideals of this country you’re making an extreme tactical error by voting for any other candidate.
1322540356181794819 2020-10-31 22:06:07 +0800 <__i960> @BretWeinstein There’s no need for an existential crisis if you stop tying so much of your identity to whether you’re left or right, Bret. The left you believe to be part of is gone. It’s ideals are now carried by people whom the current left would call “right.” I just call them Americans.
1322536569799020544 2020-10-31 21:51:04 +0800 <__i960> Why should what Europe and Canada want to do matter to us? And cmon man, Canada? We know which way their bread is buttered when it comes to China.
1322387362270212096 2020-10-31 11:58:10 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero Unless Trump went full China mode (which he’d rightfully be skewered over) there was no changing the trajectory. I’m of the belief that the endless lockdowns have made the entire thing worse actually (along with a whole host of other tinfoil beliefs on how they accounted deaths).
1322382315188748288 2020-10-31 11:38:07 +0800 <__i960> White male privilege of course.
1322381314289332225 2020-10-31 11:34:08 +0800 <__i960> @asiansforaa I don't give a damn who wrote it or supported it, I'm judging 209 on it's merits and it's merits are sound. Asian students who are pro-16 need their heads checked for directly voting against their interests.

1322376281812447232 2020-10-31 11:14:08 +0800 <__i960> @MoMoBagholder @loudclown Yeah unfortunately it's from 2019, so hell still hell.

New Zealand still has their borders effectively closed, economy wrecked, and tourism (7% of their GDP) floored. NZ hasn't even begun to deal with covid19, as they're simply trying to make it go away which only delays the inevitable.

Imagine voting for a proposition (16) against a proposition which is anti-discriminatory (209) and thinking you're on the right side of history.  https://t.co/AaP1iGHtjc

1322336822278590466 2020-10-31 08:37:20 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom The overarching need for control emanating from these people is what pisses me off the most. They have an insatiable need to try and control the outcome of basically anything they touch. This is why the current state of the dem party just ends up alienating more and more people.
1322333128921247746 2020-10-31 08:22:40 +0800 <__i960> @KreggJorgenson @try_thinking0 Don't discount drainage into water ways and the eventual exit into estuaries and local creeks... but yeah probably a decent amount just from assholes with zero concept of throwing away their own trash.

1322329791886848001 2020-10-31 08:09:24 +0800 <__i960> @DavidChiu How about try debating the issue on the MERITS of proposition 209 rather than attempting to negate it via character assassination/association.  See that? The MERIT of the issue. You probably don't.
1322328973011902464 2020-10-31 08:06:09 +0800 <__i960> Because this is what these pro prop-16 clowns are on about: that we should vote YES on 16 to overturn 209, and not doing so is somehow pro-racism/white supremacy. 209 is directly in line with American ideals and you want people to get rid of it? Why am I not surprised.
1322328420290736128 2020-10-31 08:03:57 +0800 <__i960> Prop 209: the state cannot discriminate against or grant preferential treatment on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, and public contracting.  WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD VOTE TO OVERTURN THIS?
1322327106093604864 2020-10-31 07:58:44 +0800 <__i960> @ThatOldSheepDog I think about the same stuff at times when seeing them, either passing by, or on a road trip etc.. "people once lived there, I wonder what happened to this place..."
1322326546116354048 2020-10-31 07:56:30 +0800 <__i960> But you just can't stop yourself from watching every single one, can you Jim? Rent free.

1322318669729263616 2020-10-31 07:25:13 +0800 <__i960> @DavidBCollum All of this data is 100% dependent on testing quantity and quality. It's basically like divining water without consistent testing data - which is why the only "truth" we have (and even that might be debatable) is excess deaths.

1321541223568474112 2020-10-29 03:55:55 +0800 <__i960> NPR talking about the social media hearings and I can hear their brains dividing by zero when going over the “holocaust denial” and “wipe Israel off the face of the earth” issues. It’s amusing to see them squirm.

1321203661536571392 2020-10-28 05:34:34 +0800 <__i960> It’s the cycle of abuse. Usually these folks come from dysfunctional homes where some form of emotional abuse was the norm. They then play that out as adults by both subconsciously demanding more abuse while also abusing others in return. Victimhood comes along for the ride.

But to be mad about something you cannot control and is completely legitimate is just butt hurt unhinged anger because you didn’t get your way.

Arguing with you people is like arguing with a child who didn’t get what they want. The child doesn’t have to like it but they must accept it.  Once again: NOT NEW. 29 SC nominations in past election years. 17/19 times confirmed. All same party.

1320919197505839104 2020-10-27 10:44:12 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom Right, I've heard all the familiar church of woke arguments for it, but Asians have traditionally been against this. It's almost like a younger generation of indoctrinated kids is now finally going right along with it. Aunties and uncles must be shaking their heads in shame.

1320918169779728384 2020-10-27 10:40:07 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom Totally. But with direct regard to this prop this seems like the last thing on earth any Asian would be supporting. This will be used to directly target their own hard-work.

1320916741329805312 2020-10-27 10:34:27 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom Not a single Asian in California should be voting yes on 16, but for some mind-blowing reason a bunch of 'em seem to be lining up to do it. I don't understand the total self-own.

1320854213551747073 2020-10-27 06:25:59 +0800 <__i960> Gotta love how the entire establishment and media apparatus is behind Biden, Democrats, and continued coronavirus lockdowns and folks are like “You know what, I’m voting for more of this. These folks have always had my best interests in mind.”
1320853225730232320 2020-10-27 06:22:03 +0800 <__i960> Yep. On top of that they almost never report PCR cycle data along with the testing data. The whole thing is just one big CF.

1320823869498740736 2020-10-27 04:25:24 +0800 <__i960> Always amusing to watch the libs/dems continuously make up all manner of reasons as to why confirming Barrett is essentially immoral and a "new low." Look, we get it, you mad bro - now go complain about RBG not retiring under Obama. Don't expect mercy for your team's fuckup.

1320541439223185408 2020-10-26 09:43:08 +0800 <__i960> @BrentSwenson2 The Bayarea is exposed to a ton of flights and travelers from China. There were folks with all sorts of weird colds back in early Feb, including myself. By that time the press was still focused on Wuhan. My assertion is there’s a chunk of the curve that was missed.
1320540994455007233 2020-10-26 09:41:22 +0800 <__i960> @BrentSwenson2 Well I’m speaking as someone from the area. It was around in Jan-Feb before they even started testing and they did close to no antibody-testing to determine prior infections. It was limited to a few studies only.
1320540448868319233 2020-10-26 09:39:12 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies Back in the day when we were bored we would actually make loop back plugs which are just an rj48 with 2 leads flipped so 1,2 goes to 3,6. You plug it into anything and it basically sees itself.
1320500055615238144 2020-10-26 06:58:41 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies I remember when we had to specifically make crossover cables if we wanted to interconnect hubs or PCs, no toggles or auto-detect or anything.
1320493578032803840 2020-10-26 06:32:57 +0800 <__i960> And now these folks rejoice with the typical back patting and declarations of "See, in SF, we listen to science!" Mass antibody testing in April/May would have exposed a much different narrative (and there's a reason such a thing never occurred).
1320492970127155201 2020-10-26 06:30:32 +0800 <__i960> I'll tell ya how they did it: by being first in line on the receiving end of the virus 2+ months before it was even being significantly tested along with a host of tech droids who quickly hid in their basements once London "Stunning and Brave" Breed commanded them to do so.
1320490600035053568 2020-10-26 06:21:07 +0800 <__i960> @toddeherman @AlexBerenson Then after they're all sufficiently reading into the new script, they'll pretend that was the old script all along. I wish we could seriously do something about these people.

The risk/reward vs covid with an &lt;50 IFR of 0.02% isn't even comparable. Not even in the same ballpark.
1320140474305318913 2020-10-25 07:09:50 +0800 <__i960> @pete7505 Absolutely. Although with the riots they have their perverse sense of "solidarity" with all of it (as long as it's not in their hood) borne out of a sense of having some kind of meaning in life, any meaning.

This is where the watch points come in super valuable because the debugger will stop only when the state of a particular variable changes - so you just let it do it's thing normally then the debugger stops execution when the problem state happens.

1320116223049228290 2020-10-25 05:33:28 +0800 <__i960> I just watched some of the Biden PA rally and it's basically shouting and slurring into a mic with all sorts of random ideas/promises. Jill Biden showed up to show him off the stage. Truly bizarre and sad.  https://t.co/VLStyhS1VJ

But when shit happens (and it does/will) it's up to a government agency (CPUC) to determine if the costs can be passed to taxpayers or not.  These same guys:  https://t.co/tC8Z5CZlqc

In crazy-land CA which refuses to be serious about actually managing its forests (remember too, Fed land also requires Fed/state cooperation), this is similar to forcing companies to hold a fire breathing show in a fireworks warehouse.
1320049425603989515 2020-10-25 01:08:03 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon @tweetstar10 As a result when some major wildfire happens that they're somehow involved with, the utility then has to recover all the costs via either investors or ratepayers - a path controlled by the CPUC, not the utility.

It's that California uses inverse condemnation laws to assign responsibility to utilities even if the utility isn't at fault while asking them to operate in a tinderbox.
1320047988035600384 2020-10-25 01:02:20 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 Yep, I certainly don't agree they should get unlimited liability protection. The issue in CA with utilities is that it's the exact opposite: pretty much no liability protection at all: you started it, it's your fault no matter what. BTW: I misspoke, it's "inverse condemnation."
1320044899572408325 2020-10-25 00:50:03 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 Oh absolutely not. Both PG&amp;E and SCE *should* be held responsible when their equipment is at fault. The issue is the level and scope of responsibility imposed on them. In California fires might as well be binary outcomes.
1320043552882126848 2020-10-25 00:44:42 +0800 <__i960> A little thought experiment: if you’re a utility and somehow your equipment sparks a wildfire through either mismanagement or an act of god, should you be responsible for any and all damage of the tinderbox that the state helped create?  According to California you should.
1320042659193393152 2020-10-25 00:41:09 +0800 <__i960> @joshdcaplan As long as California continues to abuse and use the threat of inverse indemnity on its utilities for basically any damage, even incidental involvement, this will continue.

1319790789518475264 2020-10-24 08:00:19 +0800 <__i960> @Greg_Tolan The thing about seatbelts is in reality probably less people would wear them if 99.9% of all auto accidents involved 1-2g of actual force.

1319451227185270784 2020-10-23 09:31:01 +0800 <__i960> Hmmm. IMO the way Biden reacted to that 3 million dollar statement by Trump was quite telling body language wise. His disgust factor wasn’t exactly genuine to anyone who could see through it.

1319430883112153091 2020-10-23 08:10:11 +0800 <__i960> @HPluckrose @Timcast @ConceptualJames You are advocating for indirect enablement via voting for people who refuse to do anything about them. How much more evidence do you need to see what's going on here?  You do not negotiate with terrorists.

1319398506889572353 2020-10-23 06:01:31 +0800 <__i960> @ConceptualJames I disagree with this letter in general. This is tantamount to handing the child another candy bar if they promise to go to bed afterwards. You do not do this if you want a viable long-term outcome and you do *not* enable by going along with it. Also:  https://t.co/GB4bfguT3I
1319390589574467585 2020-10-23 05:30:04 +0800 <__i960> @DennisAndSpace Absolutely not. It’s CNN that makes me throw objects at my non existent television. The press has been like this for DECADES you’re just seeing it now in full light because of who they’re dealing with. The mask is off.

1319386649806041088 2020-10-23 05:14:24 +0800 <__i960> @leo_daneel @HPluckrose @ConceptualJames This is a false rationalization. While the presence of Trump may be accelerating the speed at which the woke types head towards extremism, it does *not* change the destination. You have to remember here what's really going on, Trump is just a catalyst for these folks, not cause.

1319130401151938561 2020-10-22 12:16:10 +0800 <__i960> @eswashburn64 If he had said "you know what, we've done pretty good, problems and all" that'd alienate his "fuck America, this country needs a rewrite!" base. It's disingenuous, disrespectful, and unpatriotic to those who came before us.
1319129973475561473 2020-10-22 12:14:28 +0800 <__i960> @eswashburn64 Well as far as the abstraction goes, of course we've never been perfect. Nobody has. However what Biden is trying to imply is that we'll somehow have a higher chance of reckoning with this imperfection under him than we would someone else. It disrespects what we *have* done.
1319126293321973760 2020-10-22 11:59:51 +0800 <__i960> @eswashburn64 The next four years are going to be very difficult for you.

You guys are amazingly unobservant at times.

That ain’t the issue. Do you let your dad take you into his arms every time you’ve been away for a couple of weeks? It has a weird vibe to it.
1319121046784520192 2020-10-22 11:39:00 +0800 <__i960> @jatatisa @sportsisfun2 @LakersEastCoast @johncardillo @AriCohn Body language. It’s not an in passing moment, it’s a resting one, and that’s what makes it somewhat weird (and not necessarily the affection itself). Look you either see it or you don’t.

1319097612344066048 2020-10-22 10:05:53 +0800 <__i960> @tylltt My issue is it shouldn't even be proposed in the first place. We go back and forth on this, as a country, constantly. Take away the guns, no you won't, yes we will, no you won't. It's constitutionally protected and should be respected - because I know why they want the guns.

1319093956374769664 2020-10-22 09:51:21 +0800 <__i960> @LPFaught @KevinKileyCA It is almost certain Newsom will attempt an appeal.
1319084567261704192 2020-10-22 09:14:02 +0800 <__i960> @TheMattBeebe @redsteeze But yeah this whole thing is bunk city.
1319084443236093952 2020-10-22 09:13:33 +0800 <__i960> @TheMattBeebe @redsteeze Nah the compose bar definitely changes once the state of the particular convo loses iMessage connectivity. Once it comes back it goes blue again. In both cases though it usually requires atleast one message to have been sent via sms or iMessage respectively to change state.
1319075211963035648 2020-10-22 08:36:52 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson I don't know about you, but when I'm sick with the flu, can't think straight, and stuck in bed all day, by golly that's when I do my best work.
1319074287278456832 2020-10-22 08:33:11 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon @AlexBerenson Yep, but journals one thing, scientists another. There's a reason so many institutions exist to tell us what to believe.
1319074070017683457 2020-10-22 08:32:20 +0800 <__i960> @TheMattBeebe @redsteeze I know this thing is complete bullshit but just wanted to clarify that you can indeed have a scenario where imessage connectivity has gone away but sms still remains (even if previous imessage based messages were sent/received).
1319073091352293377 2020-10-22 08:28:26 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon @AlexBerenson Well to be fair we're not necessarily hearing from all scientists, just the loudest ones.
1319070994330390528 2020-10-22 08:20:06 +0800 <__i960> @OccamRamon @AlexBerenson Interesting how the various journals act as scientific gatekeepers, almost as if they control the truth we're allowed to see, eh? So much of this bullshit everywhere you look.

1318947051745366016 2020-10-22 00:07:36 +0800 <__i960> @luerverte First and foremost, SF represented itself as the main "city" of the bayarea and the the bayarea vibe was entirely it's own thing, as was SF itself. The city no longer resembles what it used to be and this is separate from how it's been run into the ground by the supes.
1318946559220830209 2020-10-22 00:05:39 +0800 <__i960> @luerverte Post? I'm old enough to remember it pre-dot com. What people "pine" for when it comes to SF are the early to mid-90s and prior IMO. 98 it started heating up, 99-00 full jump the shark mode and then mass exodus. Since then, elongated repeat of 99-00 into the present day hellscape.

1318713484209614848 2020-10-21 08:39:29 +0800 <__i960> Total nothing burger - and the tone of the article is clearly in the vein of "Trump talks about Biden but look at we found here about Trump!"  https://t.co/0Ahz2GVsX9
1318710571450003456 2020-10-21 08:27:55 +0800 <__i960> @Mike_n_pups IMO they fully knew what the optics would look like here, atleast half intentional.
1318710280109477889 2020-10-21 08:26:45 +0800 <__i960> @HeckofaLiberal They might have a divide by zero moment if it's found this is actually just a newer but less "lethal" strain.

Trump, don't gotta like him, but one does have to recognize he's a natural symptom of where things are now.
1318688434509107201 2020-10-21 06:59:57 +0800 <__i960> @ladoodles @HeckofaLiberal @Montaigne01 @GovRonDeSantis Indeed, and scarily there's a non-zero chance that Biden could simply bail (or be forced out) half way into his term, leaving Kamala at the reins. I honestly do not believe that to be a tin-foil hat conspiracy either. Never trade liberty for security, @HeckofaLiberal
1318686989063913473 2020-10-21 06:54:12 +0800 <__i960> @HeckofaLiberal @Montaigne01 @ladoodles Biden is totally fine with all of this insanity, if anything he'll empower governors to run even more roughshod over their constituents. At this point, Trump would basically have to murder someone for me to vote Biden. IMO the correct strategy here is to not cede them any power.
1318686097228984320 2020-10-21 06:50:40 +0800 <__i960> @HeckofaLiberal @NedAustin4 Worst yet, they prefer to not be paying attention.
1318685401033306112 2020-10-21 06:47:54 +0800 <__i960> @OrdyPackard Especially given that guy's total strawman analogy. He of course will conveniently leave out that Trump was asked to denounce "white supremacy and militias" - the latter of which IS a complicated issue. These people are so disingenuous, every fucking time.

Anything that involves humanity itself simply dealing with things naturally, as we've done forever, is ignored.

1318660745140187137 2020-10-21 05:09:55 +0800 <__i960> Another example of AP no longer pretending to do straight news.
1318658588856840192 2020-10-21 05:01:21 +0800 <__i960> @mcduff_tim But not without injecting a pat-on-the-back "flattening the curve" in there whilst ignoring 100s of years of viral research on how these things typically go.

1318657665925484545 2020-10-21 04:57:41 +0800 <__i960> @nightsky20201 Even at the least malevolent angle, they're certainly selfish and self-centered in their concerns (i.e. "this protects me, therefore I agree"). Funny how they spend so much time projecting "you're selfish and don't care about others!" towards those wanting an end to it.
1318657099400802304 2020-10-21 04:55:26 +0800 <__i960> @natoshisakamato I order all my cash directly from Amazon and Jeff personally prints it up for me. Problem solved.
1318656538072870912 2020-10-21 04:53:12 +0800 <__i960> Imagine seeing that Disneyland is effectively indefinitely closed due to Newsom's absolutely batshit insane covid19 policies and thinking to yourself "you know what, this makes sense, I'm all for this!"
1318656250293317633 2020-10-21 04:52:04 +0800 <__i960> @BethElderkin Critical thinking clearly isn't your strong point. But keep following that "science."
1318608480891150341 2020-10-21 01:42:15 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom Yep. I also don’t know how much more SF can take of blowing through close to a billion dollars a YEAR on the homeless industrial complex. The juice is huge with that one and many entities are certainly benefitting from it in an illicit fashion.
1318585948892901377 2020-10-21 00:12:43 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom Jordan was just an example. I’m talking more of the drivers of the Agnos -&gt; Jordan change.

1318570314687680512 2020-10-20 23:10:35 +0800 <__i960> @1ruthlessmom I've pretty much given up on SF finding sanity anytime soon. The city is going to have to get worse and worse until they finally have one of those "enough of this shit!" moments and vote in a Frank Jordan type. What angers me is where all the money is going.

It's not seen as a worthy expectation to aspire to and those who do escape the dysfunction are seen as abandoning the culture/tribe. Fundamentally this thinking is a victim mindset and what holds black folk back.

1317614505690497024 2020-10-18 07:52:32 +0800 <__i960> @BenignApathy @GarrettHaake They just cannot stand the fact that people refuse to listen to their BS and act accordingly based on their own perceived level of risk rather than what they're told to do.

"wE hAvE tO bELiEvE!" - it's a total and complete cult driven by misery loves company control freaks who are more concerned about themselves and you acting "the right way" rather than making this go away.
1317607614352478208 2020-10-18 07:25:09 +0800 <__i960> Typical leftist "I'm the victim trying to help you" narrative:
1317601272044814336 2020-10-18 06:59:57 +0800 <__i960> @cyantist Answer: you don’t. It’s unacceptable, period.

1317219319856525312 2020-10-17 05:42:13 +0800 <__i960> @scythyphus Dems can't govern with tough love. Their entire approach is asking the kids to "be good boys and girls now" and then being walked all over. They're serial enablers of shitty approaches to life's various quandries, and many times I've questioned if it were actually intentional.
1317218140766416899 2020-10-17 05:37:32 +0800 <__i960> @AJHodgeIV @AlexBerenson Absolutely agreed. The indemnity makes sense, but it must be something *earned* - i.e. "you want this? then you can't censor, curate, or otherwise obviously manipulate the flow of information."

I'm not giving her credit for telling everyone to go hide in their basement either. That isn't decisive, it's reactionary.  https://t.co/b54JSyv0DM

We're allowed to criticize the actions of someone regardless of those who supported it or what their reasons may have been. Look, I've got a problem with trading liberty for security, maybe you don't, but it doesn't mean it isn't seriously problematic.

Do you not remember the state capitol being occupied due to her decisive actions? There is no belittling of hardworking Michiganders going on here, so please don't put those words in my mouth.
1317215714017636352 2020-10-17 05:27:53 +0800 <__i960> @Jay_Beezy27 @brhodes So far libs have been knocking it straight out of the park when it comes to projection.

1317213748960976899 2020-10-17 05:20:05 +0800 <__i960> @scythyphus Miserable, as in day to day outright misery? No. Quality of life decrease and these endless fucking lockdowns that you basically have to ignore in order to keep your sanity? Absolutely. The state as a whole has been trending downwards for years because govt refuse to be adults.

I'm definitely never sending my SS# to any Internet site that isn't government related.

1317187677599399942 2020-10-17 03:36:29 +0800 <__i960> @ianmSC Here's how our state officials handle things (a thread):  https://t.co/14nDt6EdyY
1317176860002766848 2020-10-17 02:53:30 +0800 <__i960> "Newsom’s Chief Deputy Public Health Director called the Governor giving false COVID data to the public a “quality control issue.”"   https://t.co/xONx2QjfZn
1317176859029721089 2020-10-17 02:53:29 +0800 <__i960> "Newsom’s Public Information Officer “couldn’t answer” why the Administration failed to anticipate large volumes of COVID data after Newsom predicted 25 million cases."   https://t.co/pr6Dh7WwNm
1317176857968570368 2020-10-17 02:53:29 +0800 <__i960> "The state’s Public Health Officer as much as admitted that the Newsom Administration is locking down whole counties based not on science or what’s actually happening in the real world."   https://t.co/qCx5Cv2Xk6
1317176856722821121 2020-10-17 02:53:29 +0800 <__i960> "The State Superintendent tipped his hand that the plan is to keep most schools closed the entire year or longer."   https://t.co/mchhQl5l8p
1317176855309414400 2020-10-17 02:53:28 +0800 <__i960> The Newsom administration is run by completely inept, controlling, and tyrannical individuals whose entire job is to push an agenda to keep you in line and your tax dollars funding them. California needs to reject libs/dems from public office and take this damn state back.
1317174189388746752 2020-10-17 02:42:53 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader Yep, which would mean their machine "learning" is some half-ass simplistic image recognition thing. Cropping it would certainly change the hash of the data and definitely change how the image itself looks like to an algorithm but not the core meaning (the hard part for machines).
1317170249087688705 2020-10-17 02:27:13 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader I bet you can just mirror the images and they wouldn't catch it. Also, I guess my tensor flow prediction was true...:  https://t.co/TTGHmnxMDm
1317155864126443520 2020-10-17 01:30:04 +0800 <__i960> @RudyHavenstein Everything would be censored because anything other than straight ahead 100% fact driven “news” would be a liability. Intermediaries and providers should certainly be indemnified against what their users say or do but imo their should be restrictions on censorship as part of deal
1317153997346594817 2020-10-17 01:22:39 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader  https://t.co/zZNpmvz40T

1317131868727242752 2020-10-16 23:54:43 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader Did they waste 10 minutes asking Joe to opine on mask wearing? Every single one of these debates, town-halls, whatever have been complete garbage. The topics they ask about are reality TV noise.
1317129043511107584 2020-10-16 23:43:29 +0800 <__i960> @DixieCupSailor Totally. However I'm less concerned about how effective it is and much more concerned about a government mandating it - even if it were 100% effective.
1317128145028358145 2020-10-16 23:39:55 +0800 <__i960> This proposition shouldn't even be allowed to legally be on the ballot. All affirmative action of any sort should be illegal at the Federal level. Non-discrimination is completely fine and just (209). Racial quotas, mandates, _or similar_? Hell no.
1317123638902935554 2020-10-16 23:22:01 +0800 <__i960> Translation: we see the writing on the wall for 230 and we're trying to get ahead of this as fast as possible.
1317110768458870784 2020-10-16 22:30:52 +0800 <__i960> @shadihamid You want your president to be a “decent guy” while his administration makes various changes that’ll be bad for the country long-term. So as long as they’re nice you’re willing to accept that? I’m not voting for their personality I’m voting for how they’ll defend this country.

1316913775870705665 2020-10-16 09:28:05 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero @ZR1Trader I feel like these are just long meandering fireside chats with Joe with zero pushback from the hosts. Meanwhile 5 minutes into the Trump event and it was “wHeReS yOuR dAmN mASk???”
1316912084228231172 2020-10-16 09:21:22 +0800 <__i960> @EPoe187 Trading liberty for security. You want the instability and “chaos” to go away but this is the equivalent of taking out a short term loan on a long term losing bet.
1316905399447146505 2020-10-16 08:54:48 +0800 <__i960> I feel like the audio is so damn bad as to be intentional. How do you not get such a basic thing like close mic’ing, dialing out the feedback, and not mixing in a general room mic at these levels? It sounds like a metallic dumpster fire and this is the easiest thing to get right.
1316905080084484098 2020-10-16 08:53:32 +0800 <__i960> @LaughsFromGary @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews @cspan Seems intentional to me. And what’s up with this GARBAGE mix? Do we really need an overall room mic mixed in and this reverberant trash the entire time? This is BASIC STUFF.
1316904789725380620 2020-10-16 08:52:23 +0800 <__i960> @govrevolution9 @NBCNews Seriously. I feel like it’s intentional.
1316901579623071744 2020-10-16 08:39:38 +0800 <__i960> 20$ says not a single one of these townhall “undecided voter” plants will ask a single thing about the riots, hard left authoritarianism, critical race theory, attitudes towards the police or law and order, or ANY of that stuff. I’ve already written off the host.

1316897534170689538 2020-10-16 08:23:33 +0800 <__i960> This Trump town hall is a fucking joke. Just pure gotcha stuff, no REAL policy questions, the same adversarial questions over and over, tired material that’s been covered as naseum, with no actual attempts to learn anything new.  The media is the enemy of the people.
1316896055833681921 2020-10-16 08:17:41 +0800 <__i960> The audio on this NBC feed is garbage. Why the hell would they mix it down this way? Elementary stuff here.
1316895129186103298 2020-10-16 08:14:00 +0800 <__i960> @WillRicci There’s no point Will. You won’t win a critically minded debate about covid with people who are blathering on and on about mAsKs...
1316894766110371840 2020-10-16 08:12:33 +0800 <__i960> More and more 2020-specific melodrama-driven talking points as doled out by the media. Talk about something of actual SUBSTANCE for once.
1316893717630918656 2020-10-16 08:08:23 +0800 <__i960> 5-7 minutes on wEaR a MaSk. Move on!
1316853000770473984 2020-10-16 05:26:35 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 Also, don't get me wrong, I'm not a MAGA-to-the-end Trump lover. I don't even care for his personality or approach to many things. But I know what he isn't trying to do, and that's letting the left run this country into the ground. To me, 1A and 2A are extremely important.
1316852501547606016 2020-10-16 05:24:36 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 That's false though. What freedoms did Trump or the right take away from me? I live in California, surely you know who took away my freedoms man.
1316852261117517824 2020-10-16 05:23:39 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 As far as a free press goes, what are you talking about? The *entire* mainstream press is basically anti-Trump. Is that a dictatorship we're living in when the "fascist dictator" is pummeled daily with no retribution?
1316851952735547392 2020-10-16 05:22:26 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 What are you talking about? There has been zero disruption to the right to protest. There have been more protests this *entire year* than in a very long time. There is NO RIGHT to riot or pillage or destroy in the name of protesting, but peacefully doing it? Completely fine.
1316851432612458496 2020-10-16 05:20:22 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 Look at this entire year and how covid19 was approached. We're dealing with Machiavellian psycopaths with a serious case of will to power that we're having to sue just to get our daily freedoms back to normal and a media apparatus that goes along with it like scripted programming
1316850881124462592 2020-10-16 05:18:10 +0800 <__i960> @tweetstar10 C'mon man, surely you've been paying attention to the authoritarian left _all around us_? "degradation of democracy, discourse and society" is a vote for security and it's a false choice. You will be given a form of "security," but you won't like it in the end.
1316842824201981952 2020-10-16 04:46:09 +0800 <__i960> You sure as hell don’t have to like Trump as an individual but if you say to yourself “I’m voting for stability and sanity” then you’re making the classic mistake of trading liberty for security whilst thinking in the long run that outcome will be good for you. It won’t.
1316841982237442049 2020-10-16 04:42:48 +0800 <__i960> Every major institution and media outlet out there wants Trump gone and there is no end to how far they’ll go to make it happen. What’s that tell you? That they’ve got your back and they’re concerned about your well being and the future of this country?  Wake the fuck up.

1316838901454045185 2020-10-16 04:30:34 +0800 <__i960> No doubt twitter wouldn’t have done anything. I think what happened with Scully was he was pressured to get authorities involved and he knew he’d be found out if they pursued it and had to come clean.

1316765667765350400 2020-10-15 23:39:34 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies To be fair it could have something to do with widespread availability of rapid antigen tests vs lab-based PCR tests. There’s no way they’re PCR testing people.

They did it for years all throughout the Obama administration. It screws over massive amounts of people via eroded purchasing power and inflated assets but typically isn’t a “partisan” talking points because both sides benefit.
1316545410542923776 2020-10-15 09:04:20 +0800 <__i960> @ChadJarmingo @PennStateThor @atxNikita @risitasfanclub @TwitterSafety That’s where we differ then. If they want indemnity then they provide free speech otherwise they get no indemnity (this is how 230 *should actually be*)
1316545136084492288 2020-10-15 09:03:15 +0800 <__i960> @atxNikita @PennStateThor @ChadJarmingo @risitasfanclub @TwitterSafety Well hey I’ll give you this. We absolutely agree on that. But I disagree that Biden wouldn’t have done that. The dems would absolutely rushed out there to pump money into the markets via the Fed which is exactly what they did in 2008+ and they had zero issues with it.
1316543186655875072 2020-10-15 08:55:30 +0800 <__i960> @ChadJarmingo @PennStateThor @atxNikita @risitasfanclub @TwitterSafety Personally I'm not okay with the *intent* of 230 being eliminated. I think it's completely reasonable for intermediaries to have indemnification against what their users are doing as that's not their responsibility. However, the buck stops at censorship/curating of legal speech.
1316542343663640577 2020-10-15 08:52:09 +0800 <__i960> @atxNikita @PennStateThor @ChadJarmingo @risitasfanclub @TwitterSafety So you're pro Biden-Harris without considering that they're anti-free market in nature? I doubt that.

1316530901677862912 2020-10-15 08:06:41 +0800 <__i960> @mtracey True, although one difference is that they're actually *talking* about it rather than scheming ways to curtail it even more.

If this were Trump related none of that would matter at all and Jack himself would be retweeting it.
1316528801019432960 2020-10-15 07:58:20 +0800 <__i960> @jenneraub @penelopeonthego @micsolana Twitter (and others) are wholly pot committed to the desired outcome of this imminent election, and nothing short of actual illegal behavior (not saying this is, because technically it isn't) will stop them from trying to ensure that outcome. Hail mary play.

It has nothing to do with the "hacking" part of the claim, that's just the cover they're going with here. It's clear as day to anyone with even minimal critical thinking skills what this is about and anything else is simply gas-lighting.
1316524007659696129 2020-10-15 07:39:17 +0800 <__i960> @micsolana Meanwhile anything and everything can be thrown at Trump and they don’t do a damn thing in response.

1316496446317682688 2020-10-15 05:49:46 +0800 <__i960> It's a very simple trade: if a provider or platform wants the ability to censor legal speech they should lose indemnity and be considered a publisher as a result. This is what 230 *should be*.

1316426902748291072 2020-10-15 01:13:26 +0800 <__i960> It’s interesting (but not surprising) how the vast majority of left vs right questioning of ACB is basically split along the lines of “how will you change the constitution?” vs “how will you protect the constitution?” Tells you everything you need to know.

1314400212736045058 2020-10-09 11:00:05 +0800 <__i960> Sounds unconstitutional to me, and this is coming from someone who does not support the BLM movement but does support their right to peacefully protest.

It’s like they’ve had their heads done in for years growing up and they just go insanity mode when it comes to race and politics. Sad really.

The vast majority of these questions are about current events, current controversies, or current headline news events. Ask something about positions, policy, political framework etc for once.

1314022295103393792 2020-10-08 09:58:23 +0800 <__i960> @charliekirk11 Indeed. Went immediately to talking about Trump rather than a single millisecond on what their actual views are. It’s clear what their views are: continue the selling off of America to China.
1314021491369861120 2020-10-08 09:55:11 +0800 <__i960> @luismen1991 She’d sell out this country in a damn heartbeat. This lady should not be in any position of power, period.
1314021064851087360 2020-10-08 09:53:29 +0800 <__i960> Asked about our relationship with China and starts talking about how Trump views China? Talk about Biden and Harris’ view of China, NOT Trump’s. Actually talk about a single damn policy you represent for ONCE rather than Orange Man Bad.

On a different note though, remember how the media was telling us how "much more serious" Trump's condition was, about 3 days ago?

1313928553302429696 2020-10-08 03:45:53 +0800 <__i960> You mean Coronavirus *lockdowns*: "the World Bank report found that increasing numbers of urban dwellers have been thrown into extreme poverty as jobs dry up from coronavirus lockdowns and reduced demand."

My gut says you're not a libertarian either
1313622928236314625 2020-10-07 07:31:26 +0800 <__i960> Further evidence these clowns have no clue whatsoever about any sort of real hardship if push came to shove.

1313615931982008321 2020-10-07 07:03:38 +0800 <__i960> We’re gonna have to sue our way out of this in California. This right here is why so many people were up in arms back in March/April time when they went all in with the lockdowns. We saw this coming from a mile away and others tried to defend it as temporary.

Seek help, or at least demand trump pay rent for occupying your head up to this point for free. What is up with you people on the left and the penchant for melodrama? Life too boring and meaningless?

The point is people will restrain behavior based on the risk apparent to them. This is the way it has always been, since the dawn of time. If people are dying in the streets you can bet your ass people will be adjusting accordingly.

Just because Trump goes up there and does whatever doesn’t mean it’s mind control. See this is the fundamental difference between the left and the right. Trust in others to do what’s best for them or attempt to control what’s best for them.

1313189089655492608 2020-10-06 02:47:31 +0800 <__i960> People have been shouting from the rooftops for months now on how the lockdowns are political. Here’s an example:
1313173217582825472 2020-10-06 01:44:27 +0800 <__i960> @LDConners @RiaElinor @mccarthyryanj Your assertion is that covid == guaranteed death. Go back to the drawing board because you don’t understand risk.

Do not try and gracefully handle it because it indicates a problem somewhere else and at that point the code can not be completely trusted.
1313145687672934400 2020-10-05 23:55:03 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader Covid in a heartbeat. Without even thinking about it.

1313140639991689216 2020-10-05 23:35:00 +0800 <__i960> The left when they hear that Trump was given anti-inflammatory corticosteroids:  https://t.co/1MzeGcpXRj
1313136011954642944 2020-10-05 23:16:36 +0800 <__i960> This is what these types have been led to believe. Getting covid is now worse than getting shot.
1313135635016814592 2020-10-05 23:15:06 +0800 <__i960> @girlsreallyrule Corticosteroids are not anabolic steroids. Seek immediate psychiatric help.
1313135270129070081 2020-10-05 23:13:39 +0800 <__i960> These same deranged types who shriek “LiStEn tO tHe sCiEnCe!” think anti-inflammatory corticosteroids and anabolic steroids are the same thing. Yes Amee, clearly Trump is rage tweeting between sets of 500lb dead lifts.

1312966016847081472 2020-10-05 12:01:06 +0800 <__i960> @crufreeman @mccarthyryanj How did you take “most of the risk” and turn that into “risk is just on the visitor?” Clearly there’s risk both ways but it is not symmetric risk AND other patients are already in an environment where they’re at risk of exposure. Care to say anything about my other points?
1312965113532440576 2020-10-05 11:57:31 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain I take it this?
1312964239749902336 2020-10-05 11:54:03 +0800 <__i960> @crufreeman @mccarthyryanj A policy of a patient having to die alone without their loved ones being able to visit them under any circumstances even though most of the risk is on the visitor? Absolutely unjust and does not make sense. It’s inhumane and not warranted for a virus like this.
1312962642017841153 2020-10-05 11:47:42 +0800 <__i960> @Rosemarykenedy7 @mccarthyryanj And me thinks you view everything through a roughly black and white lens or one vs the other. I was implying they had room for judgement particularly when a loved one is dying. That is reasonable. “No one shall visit, even if dying!” is irrational.
1312949014468259840 2020-10-05 10:53:33 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain You’d figure maybe the self reflection (hah) might be warranted for these folks, but nope, completely pot committed.  https://t.co/IVDKBk4eyC
1312948169404104704 2020-10-05 10:50:11 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain She’s alluding that the reflection is not real and the entire set of photos is some kind of actual conspiracy where he’s either not there or the photos were augmented after the fact.
1312947270489260033 2020-10-05 10:46:37 +0800 <__i960> @RiaElinor @mccarthyryanj BTW in case it isn’t clear. If you have a situation with a dying loved one it seems completely sane that direct loved ones should be able to take on the risk of seeing them, particularly as covid is *already* in the hospital as it is. Stop treating this like Ebola and be rational
1312945036456153088 2020-10-05 10:37:44 +0800 <__i960> Lol. U N H I N G E D.

1312933023503900674 2020-10-05 09:50:00 +0800 <__i960> @RiaElinor @dukeblue24 @mccarthyryanj Died from it or died with it? Do not assume there’s no empathy here but on the same hand don’t assume I’m going to blindly accept whatever’s thrown out there because it’s politically convenient.

1312919296259964928 2020-10-05 08:55:27 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain But try and find anything from the ACLU related to the legality of lockdowns or emergency powers various governors have been abusing for the last 6 months, and complete crickets...
1312918754477502464 2020-10-05 08:53:18 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain Let's check in on the ACLU now...  https://t.co/rxEhFm1pWb
1312917882951458816 2020-10-05 08:49:50 +0800 <__i960> @spain_grain Totally. The Skokie-era ACLU is long gone, which is a damn shame. It's now just another compromised institution invaded by the same 'ole leftist garbage we see everywhere else.
1312917378070573056 2020-10-05 08:47:50 +0800 <__i960> @mccarthyryanj So nowhere in here were you actually questioning the policies that prevented you from being able to be by your mom's side, just implicitly agreeing with them as if they're sane and just.
1312916253258833920 2020-10-05 08:43:22 +0800 <__i960> Then when you compare this against today's right it's like there's been a complete rotation, at least from a pro civil liberties and resistance against authoritarianism aspect.
1312915758389755904 2020-10-05 08:41:24 +0800 <__i960> By far one of current left's most annoying traits (aside from their inherent authoritarianism) is the continual demands to appeal to authority (e.g. "listen to the experts"). It's a fascinating contrast against liberals of a few decades ago ("question authority!", "free speech!")
1312906136723488770 2020-10-05 08:03:10 +0800 <__i960> @HelvidiusPrisc @DrPhillipsMD Hah yep. I found that part particularly hilarious. As if the thing is actually hErMeTiCaLlY sEaLeD and they’re just rebreathing their own co2 the entire time. So many unhinged people on here more and more every day. It’s group psychosis enabled weakness.

1312903206154825729 2020-10-05 07:51:31 +0800 <__i960> @MartinSilenus3 @TheWarMonitor “The IFR would increase”. Absolute insanity. This is not how viruses work and is not the “goal” of a virus long term. Their only goal is to survive and killing hosts is directly against that. Viruses do not evolve to increase mortality nor do their hosts stop adapting as well.
1312902590057734145 2020-10-05 07:49:04 +0800 <__i960> @TheWarMonitor No respiratory virus acts like what you just described. In fact I’d say no virus in general does. If something like the above were a real concern we’d have been wiped out centuries ago.

1312825915429142531 2020-10-05 02:44:24 +0800 <__i960> @Neoavatara Instead just don’t do it and allow people to determine their own risk level? Sounds like choice all around to me.

1312034439552143361 2020-10-02 22:19:21 +0800 <__i960> @risitasfanclub Agreed, but we’re dealing with people whose brains are pretty much fried of any decency at this point and let their own self hate project outwards.

The main intent was to protect platforms from liability based on what their users post and also from being deemed publishers based on the removal of posts for certain material. The problem is the latter.

They're completely about the blind obedience to authority, as long as it keeps them safe. Pure security over liberty, and quite fucking sad to watch.

We have a regulation to prevent internet platforms from being sued by what you and I say on them, provided they are *a platform*.

This isn't a conspiracy, it's staring you right in the face.
1311810944608083968 2020-10-02 07:31:16 +0800 <__i960> @tbarnett500 @Jim_Jordan @JudiciaryGOP They’re already regulated dude. What do you think 230 is? 230 gives them *protections against liability* when functioning as a platform.

1310083211473481728 2020-09-27 13:05:52 +0800 <__i960> @CathyYoung63 @BenWinegard And my default is typically to fall into the “don’t control me” camp. Obviously we cannot fight authoritarianism with equally toxic authoritarianism but for me it’s simple: you don’t negotiate with terrorists (literally and symbolically).
1310082898985283584 2020-09-27 13:04:37 +0800 <__i960> @CathyYoung63 @BenWinegard I’m not saying that those people don’t exist as they certainly do but if you think that a “moderate” is suddenly going to make these people sane or not turn on you then I don’t know what to say. This is about those who want to control vs those who don’t want to be controlled.
1310080680848572416 2020-09-27 12:55:49 +0800 <__i960> @CathyYoung63 @BenWinegard It doesn’t just *go away*. This is like trying to fight a termite infestation by spraying a bit of paint on the wood. The infestation is still there and will be back at it the second another weakness is exposed. Why are you guys assuming this is all purely REACTION?

This is another error in so many of the predictions out there. They assume the virus (and hosts) are static.

For one, just look at any European countries case vs deaths chart (particularly now as their cases soar again). Secondly, viruses are not static. They must evolve in order to survive and in almost all cases they evolve to be less dangerous to the host.
1309556365065560064 2020-09-26 02:12:22 +0800 <__i960> And yet Alzheimer’s, dementia, and diabetes have soared in excess deaths during this period. I guess we’re just going to keep marching forward on “covid deaths” until they try and force a vaccine on everyone.

1309368326552911872 2020-09-25 13:45:10 +0800 <__i960> @sacbee_news As long as they have to deal with this ridiculous rule they'll keep turning off the power to reduce risk. In the end we all pay for it regardless. If you have an issue with this it's actually with California and not PG&amp;E because no one in their right mind accepts unlimited risk.

Useful idiot phase has been attained and no amount of contradictory information will free them from it. It’s really quite sad to watch in some ways.

Your inability to come to peace with this will just keep the hamster going while this planet has no problem regulating you and I right out of existence. Accept it.

The *cause* of the fire might as well be irrelevant, but you keep latching onto it and avoiding the real answer as to why fires in California are fundamentally always a basket-case. Management.

Another useful idiot I guess.

The climate is always changing as if everything else on this closed system we call planet Earth. Your problem here is a very simple matter of correlation != causation but you don’t actually want the truth.

Honest question: do you ever read something and stop and think: "Am I being told the entire truth here in an impartial fashion without an agenda in play?

Nobody honestly believes people will be out there physically raking floors. It *is* about forest management. If you don’t want bad fires you manage. If you don’t manage you get bad fires. You can’t have it both ways.

This is about who the Federal government is allowed to do business with in regards to CRT and similar programs. The Feds are allowed to regulate their own institutions. You're allowed to talk openly about CRT as much as you want.

It's complete leftist media under the guise of "fair and balanced" (not even close).

1308497923689259008 2020-09-23 04:06:30 +0800 <__i960> Climate change is measured over 1000s or years not months. If you want to have an honest discussion on climate change you must first start with China, India, and human population growth as a whole. Those are much more sensitive topics hence we get empty platitudes like this one:

1308198975225298944 2020-09-22 08:18:35 +0800 <__i960> @gelliottmorris All of these people continue to focus purely on *people* as if that’s the only thing a state actually provides to the rest of the country. Without all these “rural red states” you’d be completely fucked.

1308080049912836096 2020-09-22 00:26:01 +0800 <__i960> @bazyjonesy The problem with BGS is the shitty approach to everything. Not enough people and not enough management backing to make things robust, software engineering wise. Maybe MS might actually improve that.
1308079547938533390 2020-09-22 00:24:01 +0800 <__i960> @bazyjonesy Would prefer less large companies and more smaller independent ones though.

It’s all the other consistently dumb ass bugs and half ass-ness that makes it a shitty engine. Had no idea MS purchased Zenimax though. Not sure if that’s good or bad honestly.
1308065590100160512 2020-09-21 23:28:34 +0800 <__i960> I must admit, I don’t usually pay attention to Nebraska much, but when did that place go completely off the rails? Or is this just an Omaha thing?

I’m of the observation though that what we see are mobs of abused individuals in a cycle of both wanting to be abused while at the same time taking part in abusing others. As Americans (or people, really) we should be celebrating strength and not coddling weakness.

1307146608644038656 2020-09-19 10:36:51 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies Like he was gonna order anything other than “medium”.... but sure ask what the chef recommends
1307046997577400320 2020-09-19 04:01:02 +0800 <__i960> @tylltt Just try and find a way to blame Sarao for it somehow and we can make this go a lot quicker. In all seriousness all they need to do to make spoofing stop is to make it economically unfeasible by allowing it. Why coddle the algos? (Yeah I know why)
1307044562750275584 2020-09-19 03:51:22 +0800 <__i960> Yeah, the truth usually is...  https://t.co/3sYSIHzvIi

1306964132252377088 2020-09-18 22:31:46 +0800 <__i960> @LiamRamus @sentientveggie @UnelectableA @JulieJa21177914 The logic of “well the corruption that exists was created in a capitalist system” does not square with “therefore capitalist systems create corruption.” Corruption is always there, period. Fixing that doesn’t mean going to a system that encourages MORE of it.
1306963542860394496 2020-09-18 22:29:25 +0800 <__i960> @LiamRamus @sentientveggie @UnelectableA @JulieJa21177914 Absolutely not. First study human nature and how every pure socialist country has turned into a complete shit show because said nature does not change. Then understand how capitalism is supposed to provide an incentive to out-compete shitty solutions. Corruption is universal.
1306961232214196225 2020-09-18 22:20:14 +0800 <__i960> @LiamRamus @sentientveggie @UnelectableA @JulieJa21177914 We all want an environment in which health care doesn’t have the potential to bankrupt people and is affordable. That is the fundamental problem. Socializing it does not fix that because the real issue is the entire industry of healthcare and it’s embedded interests.
1306959923809402880 2020-09-18 22:15:02 +0800 <__i960> @SlickRockWeb @UnelectableA He would say the exact same thing today because what he was agreeing with wasn’t exactly controversial. “people should have dignity” != “let’s go full crazy town socialism.”  You folks have a serial problem with affirming the consequent when it comes to approaching logic.
1306958489013501954 2020-09-18 22:09:20 +0800 <__i960> @LiamRamus @sentientveggie @UnelectableA @JulieJa21177914 Nobody discounts that the US has similar social programs to what other pro-socialist countries also have. However, this does not mean that the solution is more of them, that they’re some kind of grand endorsement of it, or that widespread socialism itself is a net benefit.
1306951910436478981 2020-09-18 21:43:12 +0800 <__i960> @YLlneverfindme @CAPAction @JoeBiden Like most issues today, “fixing” them requires resolving core issues that have been decades in the making - which is hard. Jack up min wage or throw UBI out there is a hack that simply masks the real issues and keeps the problem going (which they don’t actually want to fix).
1306951389122240513 2020-09-18 21:41:07 +0800 <__i960> @YLlneverfindme @CAPAction @JoeBiden Agreed. Same thing with any arguments for UBI as well. MSM continues to focus on minimum wage and the like but refuses to discuss how the wages of low cost labor are driven down by undocumented workers or the 7-8 trillion dollars of Fed QE that’s annihilated PP of the $.
1306838462926974977 2020-09-18 14:12:24 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @YLlneverfindme Later leftist. See you in November.
1306838344307941376 2020-09-18 14:11:55 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @YLlneverfindme Publish a death threat on here right now and see how much 230 indemnifies you of any liability for that act.
1306837650880393217 2020-09-18 14:09:10 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @YLlneverfindme My desperate need for your attention? You’re the troll who gets involved in any 230 thread on this entire platform. You’re a fucking shill who pushes disinformation because you know 230 is about to get dealt with.
1306837028588281857 2020-09-18 14:06:42 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @YLlneverfindme “They’re a private company and you have a choice!” Same mindless logic every thread. Not every private company receives 230 protections, chief. You’re a shill.
1306836710198661121 2020-09-18 14:05:26 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @YLlneverfindme Yeah good stuff bro with your simps liking random posts from these conversations. You’re transparent as fuck to anyone with a half functioning brain.
1306836372133568512 2020-09-18 14:04:05 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @YLlneverfindme 230 protects platforms and intermediaries. If I drop some kind of “illegal speech” on a platform with 230 protections, the platform is protected, not ME. You’re officially completely full of shit and clearly a shill for 230 in its current flawed form.

He monitors twitter for anything 230 related and then hops in to push the pro-censorship propaganda, usually with lazy references to "lol, 1A only protects you from the government" and all that standard nonsense.
1306826884492136448 2020-09-18 13:26:23 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @YLlneverfindme Except when private businesses (aka platforms) gain special indemnity protections via section 230, then I'm just gonna pretend they're like any other private entity. Your entire approach to censorship is built on being full of shit first and foremost, dude.

1306824452915646465 2020-09-18 13:16:43 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @LenLisacchi @joshdcaplan Your entire existence on here is to respond to anything 230 related. Funny that.
1306824177828032518 2020-09-18 13:15:38 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @LenLisacchi @joshdcaplan The underlying issues involving 230's problems WILL be dealt with in due time. In the meantime, keep up with the "campaign" chief.
1306823843575549958 2020-09-18 13:14:18 +0800 <__i960> @pikachuevie @LenLisacchi @joshdcaplan Lol, dude we've been over 230 before, nutjob. I think it's amusing how you comment on EVERY twitter thread involving it though.
1306788120248147970 2020-09-18 10:52:21 +0800 <__i960> @LenLisacchi @joshdcaplan What they need to do is start having a real serious look at section 230 protections like they were alluding to some months ago. If it requires an amended or even new regulation, so be it.
1306772797440499712 2020-09-18 09:51:28 +0800 <__i960> @1_lot_hero How could they forget...  https://t.co/hHVVJUBJQ0

It isn’t April and people have a right to be seriously pissed off - honestly even without this report, there’s no reason the lockdowns needs to continue at this point in any capacity within the US.

You know you guys in NZ can’t avoid this, right? You’ll have to open up sometime if you ever want to recover that lost GDP from tourism.

1306716278137077760 2020-09-18 06:06:52 +0800 <__i960> @OffTheRunTrades @HisPaulson But I am not a single male. I don't know how you're spending goes but if you can't find a decent place in SF for &lt;= 5k / month *and* survive on 5k left over I don't know what to tell you man. Nobody reasonable should be burning through 10k/month in living expenses.
1306706282796036098 2020-09-18 05:27:09 +0800 <__i960> @OffTheRunTrades @HisPaulson Let's just pretend after tax is 120k take home (70% overall taxes), that's 10k/month. Let's pretend your rent is 5k, that's 5k/month left to pay for everything else. Both the tax and rent I gave are artificially higher than reality.
1306704720044552193 2020-09-18 05:20:57 +0800 <__i960> @OffTheRunTrades @HisPaulson Dude I live in one of those and you can EASILY survive here on that. I don’t even make that much myself.

So he’s basically cratered the local economy like all the other dem mayors out there and is now attempting to stick the public with a massive tax hike that his administration will no doubt heavily resist rolling back once people have submitted to it.
1306447976760369157 2020-09-17 12:20:44 +0800 <__i960> @unicornslaw @FOXNashville No. I LOVE the truth and demand it. It’s others that the truth offends, like this issue the entire thread is about. If you were about truth you wouldn’t be defending people who have flat out lied to others because it’s convenient to your own self centered demands to feel “safe.”

1306445674880184321 2020-09-17 12:11:36 +0800 <__i960> Because “Orange Man Bad” and the more miserable they can make you (and the rest of the country) the more likely you’ll vote for “change.” Additionally it’s always difficult to get control freaks to relinquish power given to them which is why you do not trade liberty for security.

The entire thing is pointless because it'll most likely be gone by the time any vaccine is actually safe (if *ever*), let alone, why do we need it?

Your choice of the phrase "giving a platform" indicate to me that you probably aren't or simply don't want to.
1306242748014452736 2020-09-16 22:45:14 +0800 <__i960> @likesicecream1 @rorochub2 @MeghanMcCain My point is your tweet implied the president either said that or retweeted something that said that when neither occurred.
1306242381491044354 2020-09-16 22:43:47 +0800 <__i960> @statomattic @stacey_rudin @AlexBerenson I mean just look at how SARS-CoV-1 was approached back in 2003 and that variant had a higher CFR (and probably IFR as well). There were even cases that made it to North America.

1306229504910618624 2020-09-16 21:52:37 +0800 <__i960> @PonyFortyTwo @JMichaelWaller And yes it could be argued that what Trump said is an absolute and it’s not any better and I would agree with that. Where I don’t agree is that there’s no kernel of truth in what he said. The issues with the current press aren’t even new. They’re multi-decade.
1306227674734452741 2020-09-16 21:45:20 +0800 <__i960> @PonyFortyTwo @JMichaelWaller No, you’re approaching it as an absolute it where as I am recognizing that, while a free press is required, the press must also be questioned when they have shown themselves to be consistently lacking integrity. If you can’t see the latter’s existence I don’t know what to say.

The concept of a free press is absolutely not the enemy of the people and I think we agree on that. However the current form of how the global press operates most definitely does not have the people in mind.

I also expected some other kind of reckless endangerment-like charge and possibly a murder or manslaughter charge for Rosenbaum due to lack of video evidence at the time. This doesn't mean I agree with them.

I simply said it was over-charging for political purposes not that I didn't expect *any* charges (I figured something gun-possession related would be there). B: Dude, *you* said that, I merely quoted you. This is why you need to eat your Wheaties.

Probably 90% of everyone in here agrees there should be a trial, this is independent of what they think the outcome should be.

Not once did I say that. I've simply been saying that just because the DA charges him with 6 counts of whatever doesn't mean I have to *agree* with those charges. Since when the fuck are we blindly supporting DAs?
1305681764342407169 2020-09-15 09:36:05 +0800 <__i960> @jtcope4 I definitely know people who’d vote for the left that I otherwise consider decent people all around. Don’t agree with their politics though. I don’t associate with hard-core antifa level leftists however.
1305681487165939712 2020-09-15 09:34:59 +0800 <__i960> @jtcope4 This is kind of dangerous territory though. I don’t think it’s fair to say “well they’re voting for the left therefore they’re as bad as all the policies they’re voting for.” It’s the same type of thing the left says about people on the right and it only ends up in division.

I guess we should adopt the “magatownage” judicial system: DAs declare the sentence and suspects get 15 minutes to prove their innocence but only if Enzo is in a good mood that day.

Do you still use the word "killer" there?

"vIoLeNt mOb" triggers you but it's totally okay for you to bust out the "killer with murder charges" stuff over and over. You fail your own purity tests.

It's a BS appeal to authority, won't be silently accepted, and we already went over this yesterday.

Should we just not even have the trial at all since whatever the DA says is biblical law at this point?

You don't insist it's self defense. This isn't a declaration of nuclear war, it's a difference of opinion. But you can't just let that go without attempting to control the outcome here.

However, they tried to do something that got them killed because another person legitimately felt threatened.

But I do gotta say there needs to be a bit of humanity involved if there are folks who've settled down here for 10-20+ years, especially if they have kids. "You're not a citizen, get out!" is too simplistic.

1305573342095654912 2020-09-15 02:25:15 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader @MitchellMcCall7 It's simply outrage against what a closed system does as part of it's natural progression. Those having an existential crisis over it are really more so concerned about their lack of control over it.  Certainly this doesn't mean be shitty to the environment as a result (I'm not).
1305571514264117248 2020-09-15 02:18:00 +0800 <__i960> @MitchellMcCall7 @ZR1Trader You know how else I know they're full of shit and simply playing politics? By attempting to measure the effects of "climate change" via 4 year intervals. We've got Biden saying if Trump is reelected, "climate change will get worse." Populous too dumb to even think twice about it.
1305567207045251072 2020-09-15 02:00:53 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader They go on and on and on about the climate change bogeyman but always have little to say with regard to  China, India, or the massive role of population growth. It's completely disingenuous.
1305562072571211777 2020-09-15 01:40:28 +0800 <__i960> @AlexBerenson 40-cycle PCR has huge ramifications. From case counts, to "died with covid," to relative comparisons between one region (or country) vs another, non-infectious people being forced to stay isolated and unable to receive CARE benefits &gt;2weeks, so much of it...

1305300120259321856 2020-09-14 08:19:34 +0800 <__i960> @magatownage @momofwjmj @JuiceWilliams1 @TerranceAPhill1 @Mikenike13590 @accnetwork @ESPNCFB @marvinwilson21 @FSUFootball There's a reason he fired first before "mostly peaceful skateboard" guy showed up. I find it amusing that you'd just sign up to get your ass beat to death rather than actually defend yourself, but finance MBA types aren't well known for doing too well in kill-or-be-killed events.  https://t.co/vmOanTbOjn

He knew Kyle was armed and Kyle knew Gaige was right there in front of him, fully aware. Gaige was given a choice and he chose to go for Kyle when he thought he had a chance. Ramifications were then had.  https://t.co/63IIci8Bj3

Whatever the thoughts of the mob were, Kyle also had his own. You don't take an event and myopically perceive it from only *one* angle in attempt to exert your own ex post facto mental justice.
1305296529721155585 2020-09-14 08:05:18 +0800 <__i960> @magatownage @momofwjmj @JuiceWilliams1 @TerranceAPhill1 @Mikenike13590 @accnetwork @ESPNCFB @marvinwilson21 @FSUFootball Of course. He was clearly intent on fleeing a crime scene after _calling the cops_ to report that he just shot someone. Makes zero sense. If anyone is obsessed with COD bot-level shit it’s your continually inflexible take on this.
1305295837455478786 2020-09-14 08:02:33 +0800 <__i960> @magatownage @momofwjmj @JuiceWilliams1 @TerranceAPhill1 @Mikenike13590 @accnetwork @ESPNCFB @marvinwilson21 @FSUFootball You seem to be doing this thing where you believe Kyle has zero agency as if he’s some kind of terminator shooting anything and everything and the peaceful protestors are just trying to put an end to Skynet. Kyle *also* perceived a threat and acted accordingly.

It’s clearly evident in the footage out there and it doesn’t matter if it was 1 second or 500. He forfeited his chance to back off and instead moved in for the gun. It seems to me your real beef is with a gun owner defending themselves. How dare he!

Go watch the videos again, you'll clearly see the extremely obvious pause where Gaige had a choice to back off but instead chose to reach for the gun.

"Why'd you attempt to make an aggressive move towards him, Gaige?" "I was just attempting to disarm the threat, I didn't want to hurt him."

I'll take the other side of any trade you're involved with, simply out of principle. Nobody who flexes on twitter about their "six figure job" that is ever to be taken seriously.

Looking forward to the look on your face when he's acquitted.

You are one seriously smooth-brained specimen, you know that? I'd like to sell a call option on your future, because from what I see, the upside isn't looking so great.

1304904380827619329 2020-09-13 06:07:02 +0800 <__i960> @ianmSC This is also notable (alzheimers and dementia, a bit of diabetes as well):  https://t.co/MbIMmlM5yN

1304899042086846464 2020-09-13 05:45:50 +0800 <__i960> @ianmSC Pneumonia, lung issues, excess cough, etc. Point being: let's pretend California never locked down at all and covid19 was never made into what it is now: we might all be back to our normal lives months ago, having never left them, and no one would have been alarmed.
1304898475964821504 2020-09-13 05:43:35 +0800 <__i960> @ianmSC I think what's extremely notable here is that this most likely went undetected for 2-3 months atleast until doctors started connecting the dots (but *only* after c19 was made into a big deal). Before that Dr's might have simply noted an elevated increase in respiratory illnesses.

1304880827113771009 2020-09-13 04:33:27 +0800 <__i960> @HeckofaLiberal @TreyGraves2 There's plenty of early instances of people getting it and having no known travel or contact with people knowingly who had it. Like it magically just appeared out of thin air (when in reality it was already there, just not tested for).
1304880092972118016 2020-09-13 04:30:32 +0800 <__i960> @HeckofaLiberal @TreyGraves2 There probably was no "miracle", and CA didn't go aggressive with lock-downs until March 19 anyway. Probably 1000s and 1000s of cases that were simply done and over with by this point...  then when you look at some of the data here:  https://t.co/LcT5YyhNBB

1304877622476726272 2020-09-13 04:20:43 +0800 <__i960> @HeckofaLiberal @TreyGraves2 If we look at SF's total case count as of right now, it's 10263, with a population of 883000. Overall that's 1.16% which is very low. San Mateo County is ~1.23% and Santa Clara ~0.99%. LA county is ~2.5% w/ 252k cases (10m population). NYC 2.8%. Real %infected probably 10x this.

In fact I think this has been brought up before by the press (the lower amount of cases, comparatively).

1304830117839994881 2020-09-13 01:11:57 +0800 <__i960> The only reason people are reaching for existential causes like climate change is because of their inability to come to terms with the fact that they do NOT have control here. In the grand scheme of things you either try to manage risk as best you can or you accept the risk.
1304830116824887296 2020-09-13 01:11:57 +0800 <__i960> The fundamental problem here has nothing to do with climate change. It has to do with the fact that this is what the land naturally goes through year after year and even if we were all non-existent, it would still do it.
1304829602208952320 2020-09-13 01:09:54 +0800 <__i960> Insane. Can't effectively manage the forest due to environmental concerns, but can't live near it due to wildfire concerns. What form of natural management do you WANT? You can't have unmanaged forests with natural decomposition and no wildfires.
1304822888738877440 2020-09-13 00:43:13 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies "Protect myself first" then maybeeee think about "protect residents."
1304805079862583302 2020-09-12 23:32:27 +0800 <__i960> You're completely full of shit.
1304803957777117184 2020-09-12 23:28:00 +0800 <__i960> @abco_helf @GuyJustis @MichaelWitschel @realDonaldTrump Even if we just use Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas ("takers"),  they produce 71B combined. California is the 3rd largest state in the union by size and 1st in population. It's not rocket science they have the most productive ag sector, but this doesn't mean they alone feed everyone.
1304802407612739586 2020-09-12 23:21:50 +0800 <__i960> @abco_helf @GuyJustis @MichaelWitschel @realDonaldTrump Your hyper-focusing on California and comparing it 1:1 with other states is not debating in good faith. Using the original tweet's list of "GIVE vs GET" states and USDA data, the Ag output of "GIVE" states is 167B in aggregate (42%) and "GET" states is 228B in aggregate (57%).  https://t.co/6yvqeX46PE
1304796533775200256 2020-09-12 22:58:30 +0800 <__i960> @jordanschumway It's like various lefty teacher types screaming "think of the children!" when it comes to reopening schools. In reality, they mean "think of me first!"
1304796311338668033 2020-09-12 22:57:37 +0800 <__i960> @jordanschumway One of the most ironic things I've found is the continual declarations of "selfishness" towards those who want the madness to stop and for people to get on with their lives. Seems to me the types who demand we pander to their personal weaknesses are the real selfish ones.
1304791865036738561 2020-09-12 22:39:57 +0800 <__i960> @Timcast Anyone who's seen "Kids" might recognize this...
1304789529652420608 2020-09-12 22:30:40 +0800 <__i960> @jordanschumway No. The whole thing really is that simple.
1304789269228040193 2020-09-12 22:29:38 +0800 <__i960> @Mr_Black_Cotton It's just more of the same march down the lane of normalizing any and all degeneracy and IMO you don't need to be happy about it. On another note, keep planting that cotton Mo, America needs you now more than ever.
1304787773820338177 2020-09-12 22:23:41 +0800 <__i960> @MichaelWitschel @abco_helf @GuyJustis @realDonaldTrump And this is part of the response, the fact that it came out of a Trump tweet is 100% irrelevant.
1304786101400297473 2020-09-12 22:17:02 +0800 <__i960> @abco_helf @GuyJustis @MichaelWitschel @realDonaldTrump It wasn't literal, it was a statement on the so-called "welfare" states being *critical* to the nation's food production.
1304783340231303168 2020-09-12 22:06:04 +0800 <__i960> @GuyJustis @MichaelWitschel @realDonaldTrump Just stop sending wheat, corn, and rice to blue states and you’ll see the tune change real quick.

You know the signs that say "Don't feed the bears" but people do it anyways and can't figure out why they have a bear problem? Those are Dean types.

1304776467142733826 2020-09-12 21:38:45 +0800 <__i960> @PanickedSlave @RVAFaceDoc @jhaskinscabrera Yep, and fight for the right to reopen and restore people's livelihoods. At this point there's no use convincing the basement dwellers, they'll come out when they have no other choice, lest they be left behind. America is supposed to be a country of strength, not *this*!
1304775217646952448 2020-09-12 21:33:48 +0800 <__i960> @r0b0tspider @stuffonfire @sfzombienation Hard to care about relay PLCs when people are shitting in bart cars and treating every station like their own personal rendition of Thunderdome. Technology will be approved, by the social aspects need to change immediately.
1304772971374940160 2020-09-12 21:24:52 +0800 <__i960> @humspot1 @AlexBerenson And yet the citizens of NJ (and NY) continue to go right along with it. Both states could 100% open *today* and significantly increase the quality of life for their people, but nope, "we've got an election to win, boys."
1304772674338435072 2020-09-12 21:23:41 +0800 <__i960> @KimKingsley7 @AlexBerenson The strategy is "maximum misery" in the name of swinging voters prior to the election, i.e. "this is Donald Trump's America." Politicians are actually completely fucking over their own people for 100% political purposes.
1304772096468295680 2020-09-12 21:21:23 +0800 <__i960> @kavetheman @IraAltman @AlexBerenson The reason the red/blue divide keeps being brought up is that within blue states the default approach has been economically devastating nanny-state authoritarianism whereas red states have generally made it a priority to get over it as fast as possible.
1304771820856381441 2020-09-12 21:20:18 +0800 <__i960> @kavetheman @IraAltman @AlexBerenson The name of the party is completely irrelevant, only the actual approach and results matter. The fact of the matter is that Sweden approached this in a more "American" fashion than America itself - and as a result, they're well ahead of the curve of basically everyone else.
1304770772922114049 2020-09-12 21:16:08 +0800 <__i960> @ScottHansen04 @youyanggu @_MiguelHernan His "analysis" was basically "here's a bunch of random observations, do with it what you will." You'd think he'd spend 2 seconds on just what "herd immunity" actually means with this virus, T-cells, yadda yadda, but nope, just glances right over it. Complete garbage.
1304757726929588224 2020-09-12 20:24:17 +0800 <__i960> @VorheesMusic @ktimmons541 @CBSNews @soledadobrien And you realize that comorbidity is also involved with people who “die” of the flu, right? Where were you the last 20 flu seasons? That’s right, off doing your own thing completely unaware of the thousands and thousands of people who succumb to influenza complications every year.
1304756974458814464 2020-09-12 20:21:18 +0800 <__i960> @VorheesMusic @brockatkinson Complete nonsense that you basically just made up. The data doesn’t lie, but keep trying.
1304756190933430273 2020-09-12 20:18:11 +0800 <__i960> @JohnandGloria @VorheesMusic @CBSNews @soledadobrien Ah so this same outrage was extended towards the “teens” engaging in mass protests back in June, right? Don’t even bother with the “but they wore a mask” nonsense either - we all know that was hit or miss and there was no social distancing.
1304635792023666691 2020-09-12 12:19:46 +0800 <__i960> @SlayerofDragon7 @ZettelkastenDev @michaelmalice Yeah I’m a bit old school and have basically always considered them to be the same, that is: equality of *outcome* (not egalitarianism [opportunity]) is basically what they call “equity” these days. Am I off on this?
1304620054932201472 2020-09-12 11:17:14 +0800 <__i960> @ZettelkastenDev @SlayerofDragon7 @michaelmalice Gotta agree here - there's nothing wrong with egalitarianism. What these people really want is not equality of opportunity, but instead equality of outcome - but in practice it'll just be standard commie bullshit.
1304587792140267520 2020-09-12 09:09:02 +0800 <__i960> @AdamInHTownTX @nerdytogether @scottwcoleman @MaedMan18 @ariczwy2 @ComplexSports These people have completely had their heads done in, it's incredibly sad. What they really need is a wakeup call to remind them just what their own freedom provided by this country actually means.
1304571270239940608 2020-09-12 08:03:23 +0800 <__i960> This is by far the biggest scam I've ever seen pulled on the American people as a whole. It's not that the virus isn't real, but the response is completely bat-shit insane and people are still just going right along with it without stopping to really question anything.
1304570354724028417 2020-09-12 07:59:44 +0800 <__i960> @VorheesMusic @CBSNews @soledadobrien So rather than being upset about the politicians who forcibly put you in this situation you instead get angry at these "little shits" who are clearly not at risk at all. Get your priorities straight and know who the real enemy is, dude.
1304569971880517634 2020-09-12 07:58:13 +0800 <__i960> Look at how the kids in the video are handling it, it's a non-event. Comments on the tweet however are treating it like Ebola/grandma-killers as usual. cc: @AlexBerenson
1304560736379654144 2020-09-12 07:21:31 +0800 <__i960> "Oldie" but goodie... Remember when this was the major issue of the time? How quickly things have changed...  https://t.co/88kAs3nzcA

1304533617519915008 2020-09-12 05:33:46 +0800 <__i960> @leadpacer @MattWalshBlog Myself I prefer ales that are 4-6%. This is pretty standard. I’ve drank a shitload of different IPAs, high ABV and all that. At a certain point I just want to be able to enjoy a couple of beers without getting slammed. Not a knock on IPAs though.
1304532990152912896 2020-09-12 05:31:16 +0800 <__i960> @SkubMcgee @MattWalshBlog Me too. I drink Ruination or Torpedo and it doesn’t even really phase me. I don’t get why some people are like “oMg tHiS iS sO bITtEr” like they’ve never had a cup of black coffee or something.

1304532163673513984 2020-09-12 05:27:59 +0800 <__i960> @leadpacer @MattWalshBlog It’s not like light beers don’t contain hops. IPAs are just a basic ale. Been around for 100s of years.

The data arrives in a clump-like manner which is why a rolling average is the only reasonable approach. What were the C19-associated death numbers for 9/7/2020, Alex? I'll wait.
1304431064819970050 2020-09-11 22:46:15 +0800 <__i960> Impossible to reason with people like this. Just immediately eject from the plane so the rest of the passengers don’t have to be inconvenienced by childish garbage.
1304303575489630209 2020-09-11 14:19:39 +0800 <__i960> @DC_Draino When it comes to California and PG&amp;E, never forget this concept: Inverse condemnation. It was unfairly applied to a private entity on damages well beyond their actual control and completely separate from *direct* damage due to their own negligence.
1304267462880436231 2020-09-11 11:56:09 +0800 <__i960> @RealRobWhitt @AlexBerenson 9 is such an odd number to pick too.

Nobody in their right mind would use a single day for comparison, but then again I said "right mind."

You pontificate on where the price of TSLA will be the next week and produce no Teslas. DIFFERENT CONCERNS.

However we're talking about urban vs rural interests. So just in case it's not clear: Joe Blow in some LA county suburb is more concerned with what's on Netflix tonight than how his wheat crop is doing.

So an effective weighting of votes for a *more fair* geographical representation is now _worse_ than mob-rule driven policy set by dense urban centers.

1303466182381416448 2020-09-09 06:52:09 +0800 <__i960> @LibertyOne8 @stacey_rudin The left is always about pandering to the lowest common denominator via it's default mindset of coddling the weak. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying we have to go full jungle mode survival of the fittest, but we shouldn't be long-term fucking over 95% of people for the other 5%.

You might want to research why that is sometime but until then get in line with the rest of the left trying to push for tyranny of the majority.

This ain't Singapore bro, it's 50 states across 3.8 million square miles. What's desired in California isn't necessarily *representative* of what's desired in Iowa or Nebraska.

Do you believe that just because there's less people in rural states that said states are basically out there doing nothing at all and should have the privilege of being told how to live by CA and NY?

America-conscious patriots respect constitutional rights and the opposing side's ability to speak, even if disagreed with. The other way around, not so much.

1303107092144746497 2020-09-08 07:05:15 +0800 <__i960> @ZR1Trader The amount of people I see wearing a mask in their own cars or walking outside on a trail with 50ft to the next person, masked up. Kids and parents riding by on bikes, all masked. It's like some kind of conformity test of which many seem to be rushing out to "pass."

1303097910456795136 2020-09-08 06:28:46 +0800 <__i960> @charleseblack @IronFlies You can setup as many local port tunnels as you want, can even do it all in a single ssh command. With jump desktop you can actually have that happen as part initiating the connection too.
1303097640020656128 2020-09-08 06:27:42 +0800 <__i960> @charleseblack @IronFlies Yep. IMO the best setup is forward port &lt;something else&gt; to port 22 on another box in your home net that is running sshd. Then “ssh -L&lt;local port&gt;:&lt;some-box-on-your-home-network&gt;:&lt;port&gt; remote-ip” as needed and use localhost:localport from your remote client to access it.
1303095617074245634 2020-09-08 06:19:40 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @charleseblack Also if you do go and set this up don’t run ssh on port 22 or you’ll get hammered by scanners out there. Run it on some other port.
1303095392590946306 2020-09-08 06:18:46 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @charleseblack Also to even access it remotely you’ll of course have to open up a port on your router and forward it to another box. If it’s straight vnc id say that’s sketchy. Ssh is more secure and you can then tunnel via ssh port 3389 or a vnc port which you’ll use for the remote connection.
1303094961861083138 2020-09-08 06:17:03 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @charleseblack BTW you can setup a sort of ghetto dyndns by writing a script to get your external IP and if it’s different send yourself an email or a text via email. It’s unlikely you’ll be reconnecting often with modern internet stuff. You then just run this script from your router or pc.
1303094523380207617 2020-09-08 06:15:19 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @charleseblack If your computer just crashes you’re boned usually. If explorer or something hangs and you have Cygwin installed you could likely ssh in and “shutdown /r”
1303094197323354112 2020-09-08 06:14:01 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @charleseblack They don’t do any of that they just dynamically update a DNS record (you setup something on your end to trigger an update) which you’ll query later (via just using name resolution) to figure out what your home ip is.
1303060945527160832 2020-09-08 04:01:53 +0800 <__i960> @SomeBitchIKnow The ends don’t always justify the means and without keeping a check on ourselves we become the same horrible people we despise. Sadly I wonder if this lack of a self-check is what gives the left an inherent but unfair advantage (in addition to all the other BS).
1303060564797566976 2020-09-08 04:00:22 +0800 <__i960> @SomeBitchIKnow One thing I’ll add that frustrates me about all of this is that IMO the right is definitely more fair to its opponents in self-checking what’s unconstitutional or just simply unfair. The left has no rule book - everything is fair game to them and I see that as inherently evil.
1303059509347143681 2020-09-08 03:56:11 +0800 <__i960> @SomeBitchIKnow I couldn’t personally support a blanket “no immigrants” stance, but I would support some kind of continual allegiance check on members of Congress, no matter where they come from. I do realize that’s pretty difficult to do in a fashion that doesn’t brush up against 1A issues tho.
1303035403423768577 2020-09-08 02:20:24 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @charleseblack Why are you not using rdc (Remote Desktop) with an ssh tunnel of some sort btw? Not related to the explorer crash I know but I’d imagine performance would be better than VNC. I use jump desktop to access windows boxes myself but yeah that Cygwin thing again to run sshd.
1303030089060237312 2020-09-08 01:59:17 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies @charleseblack Figure out what hosed it and go from there.. Might have nothing to do at all with remote access.

1302989485769015297 2020-09-07 23:17:56 +0800 <__i960> @kolohe711 @luismen1991 The thing that always blows my mind with the PG&amp;E debacle is the inverse condemnation clause being applied to utilities. If a fire is started by a utility, fault or no fault, they’re on the hook for *all* damage, even indirect, that results from it. This is insane.
1302986362857992192 2020-09-07 23:05:31 +0800 <__i960> @IronFlies 54% of small businesses in SF have closed permanently. Over half - and the city just sits here and watches it happen. 9900 cases and 86 deaths in SF proper (guarantee you the case count is way higher), but let’s keep living in fear.
