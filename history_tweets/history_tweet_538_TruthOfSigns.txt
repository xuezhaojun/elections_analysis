1336845567490732032 2020-12-10 09:29:55 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @BipoCowboy Thanks for this reply! Look forward to discussing once the poll is over :)
1336314473984954369 2020-12-08 22:19:32 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> For reference, a universal is "that which is of such a nature as to be predicated of many subjects". His example of a universal is "man". His counter-example is "Callias".  Source: 7.1  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK
1334273048254484485 2020-12-03 07:07:38 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> If Homer is a poet, and Homer doesn't exist, then it seems Aristotle would take a proposition like "Every poet is good" to say something about more than just the existing poets.
1334273046291636226 2020-12-03 07:07:38 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> In modern logic, "Every X" translates to "Every existing X". But there is reason to believe Aristotle would differ on this point.  In Part 11 ( https://t.co/5eBlKdZ0Bg), he claims that "Homer is a poet" is true, even though "Homer is" is false (since Homer no longer exists).
1334273044588670977 2020-12-03 07:07:38 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Aristotle identifies these 4 kinds of propositions that can be made regarding universals X, Y:  1. Every X is Y 2. No X is Y 3. Some X are Y 4. Some X are not Y (source: 7.3, 7.4  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)  What does "Every X" mean? Perhaps not what you think.
1331297042761732106 2020-11-25 02:02:03 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Is the universal / individual distinction a distinction among words or among things?   People share names, so arguably the word "Callias" can be predicated of many subjects. This seems to imply the distinction cannot be among words.   What do you think?
1331297039225925640 2020-11-25 02:02:03 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> "Some things are universal, others individual. By the term 'universal' I mean that which is of such a nature as to be predicated of many subjects, by 'individual' that which is not thus predicated. Thus 'man' is a universal, 'Callias' an individual." 7.1  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK
1331297037975957507 2020-11-25 02:02:02 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> In "On Interpretation", Aristotle distinguishes "universals" from "individuals":
1329060992387608578 2020-11-18 21:56:48 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Aristotle only considers the impact that the truth of one single-proposition has on the truth of another.  Whereas in "Prior Analytics", he considers the impact that the truth of two single-propositions has on the truth of a third.
1329060991074770945 2020-11-18 21:56:47 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Aristotle will establish what the different kinds are, and what relationships they have to each other.  This work is distinguished from his work in "Prior Analytics" in that the study is limited to pairs.
1329060989766160384 2020-11-18 21:56:47 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> The rest of "On Interpretation" is a study of the "single-proposition" (one that "indicates some one fact about some one subject" Part 8, paragraph 1  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK).
1327328093690793986 2020-11-14 03:10:52 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> It seems Aristotle either  A) would disagree that they have the same implications B) had a different notion of "equivalence" What do you think?
1327328089815343105 2020-11-14 03:10:51 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Take "Every person-born-in-May is good", "Every person-not-born-in-May is good". Don't they together have the same implications as "Every person is good"? If so, and if "equivalent" means "same implications", then "Every person is good" is non-single (contra Aristotle).
1326691127802667008 2020-11-12 08:59:48 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> But what does "equivalent" mean here? It can't mean "has the same implications", which is what it means in modern logic. Can anyone guess why? Hint: Aristotle considers a proposition such as "Every person is good" to be a single proposition.
1326689283864981505 2020-11-12 08:52:28 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Aristotle's proof offers us a general test which a single proposition cannot pass - being equivalent to multiple propositions whose subjects are such that a particular instance of one is not an instance of another.
1326689282518626304 2020-11-12 08:52:28 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> He says it is non-single because: A) it's equivalent to "horse is white", "man is white" B) "horse is white", "man is white" don't together have one significance, since "a particular man is not a horse" (I speculate a hidden lemma in "B" is "they have different subjects")
1326689280882827264 2020-11-12 08:52:27 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> But he offers an example of a non-single proposition, and the way he demonstrates it is non-single helps clarify matters. His example is "garment is white", in the hypothetical case that "garment" is significant both of "horse" and of "man" (Part 8  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)
1326689279444209666 2020-11-12 08:52:27 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> The next division Aristotle introduces is between single / non-single propositions: "An affirmation or denial is single if it indicates some one fact about some one subject" (Part 8  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK). He doesn't give a definition of "single fact" or "single subject".
1324810898712776704 2020-11-07 04:28:26 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @GijsbersVictor huge if true
1323702473954070529 2020-11-04 03:03:57 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> It seems that either Aristotle uses the terms "simple proposition" and "composite proposition" inconsistently, or his distinction is problematic. What do you think?
1323702461660565505 2020-11-04 03:03:54 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> But "Homer is", on the level of signifier, goes into composing "Homer is existent". So "Homer is existent" is a composite proposition. Thus "Homer is existent" is both a simple proposition and a composite proposition.
1323702458733002752 2020-11-04 03:03:54 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Another problem - Aristotle's definition of "simple proposition" is based on what a proposition asserts. So if "Homer is" makes the same assertion as "Homer is existent", then the latter is a simple proposition as well.
1323702455117500420 2020-11-04 03:03:53 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> But then what is the other ingredient that goes into composing "Homer is a poet"? Is it just the word "poet"? And if "poet" is not a proposition (let alone a simple one), is it really right to say that "Homer is a poet" is compounded of simple propositions?
1323702449627140104 2020-11-04 03:03:51 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> He says the latter's truth doesn't imply the former's. So "compounded" apparently pertains to the signifier, not the signified. "Homer is" is part of "Homer is a poet" because it is a sub-expression of it, not because its assertion is constituent of the latter's assertion.
1323702440655523842 2020-11-04 03:03:49 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> What does he mean by "compounded"? We get an inkling in Part 11, where Aristotle seems to claim that "Homer is" is a simple proposition within the composite proposition "Homer is a poet".  (Part 11, paragraph 9 and 10  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK).
1323702434561171462 2020-11-04 03:03:48 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> "A simple proposition is a statement [...] as to the presence of something in a subject or its absence". While a "composite proposition" is "that which is compounded of simple propositions". (Part 5, paragraph 5  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)
1323702429075066881 2020-11-04 03:03:46 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Aristotle begins his study of propositions by introducing a way of dividing them - into "simple" versus "composite" propositions.
1322213102985895936 2020-10-31 00:25:43 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Whereas in modern logic, an expression can be assigned to its grammatical category before any notion of signification or meaning is introduced. As @NavzdyVas_Abbe has pointed out, one might even say "must be" thus assigned.
1322213100934860804 2020-10-31 00:25:43 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> A similar remark applies to Aristotle's definition of "noun" and "verb" ( https://t.co/2oBzR7ueId). To him, an expression is assigned to one of these grammatical categories based on what and how the expression signifies.
1322209091066961920 2020-10-31 00:09:47 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @NavzdyVas_Abbe Haha no worries... I appreciate your questions, they make me think more...
1321934768087453697 2020-10-30 05:59:43 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @NavzdyVas_Abbe I wanted to make a claim about what is possible, rather than about what is required. Since a claim about the latter seems to me more speculative (especially when speaking in broad terms). Excited to get to Tarski and contemplate his specific claims...
1321897363720572932 2020-10-30 03:31:05 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> This approach may seem natural, but it differs starkly from modern logic. In modern logic, the language to be analyzed can be completely specified before introducing any notion of truth or meaning. I'll point out this difference again when the new approach surfaces.
1321897361778581514 2020-10-30 03:31:05 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> So he uses his notion "proposition" to specify what language he will go on to analyze (the subset of Greek consisting of "propositions"). And recall that his notion "proposition" is based on a notion of truth (they are sentences which "have in them either truth or falsity").
1321897360289632257 2020-10-30 03:31:05 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> After defining "proposition", Aristotle says he'll "dismiss all other types of sentence", because "the investigation of the others belongs rather to the study of rhetoric or of poetry." (Part 4, paragraph 3  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)
1321890877246242822 2020-10-30 03:05:19 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @Thomas_Kupka @StevenFrench4 Thanks @Thomas_Kupka for the intro! (and hello @StevenFrench4 !) After making it through your suggested material, I would be grateful for his advice on approaching OSR. I am fascinated by the possibility of moving beyond common-sense notions of identity.
1321888241558167553 2020-10-30 02:54:50 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @Thomas_Kupka Thanks @Thomas_Kupka , these gems make an exciting addition to the syllabus. Not sure if I'll be able to hold back from reading "The Concept of Truth ..." before getting to the 1930s!
1321524059700662272 2020-10-29 02:47:43 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @NavzdyVas_Abbe Sounds like a worthy challenge! haha. It makes sense that prerequisite groundwork exists. Will stay tuned for your results if you feel like sharing them.
1321498932824997888 2020-10-29 01:07:52 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @NavzdyVas_Abbe Seems like a cool line of research. Do you have any interest in analyzing the expressive content of aesthetic objects? Do you think such an analysis could be done within a theory of visual argumentation?
1321490197142523906 2020-10-29 00:33:09 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @Thomas_Kupka Thanks for responding! Is there a primary source (ie, not a textbook) that was especially impactful or inspiring in connection to your work in the philosophy of science?
1320408557636841477 2020-10-26 00:55:06 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> However, I am open to the idea that he should have approached "Dialectic" and "Rhetoric" in a more unified way. I'm excited to get to the point in history when such an approach surfaces... is there a specific text or thinker you would suggest checking out?
1320408555820883975 2020-10-26 00:55:06 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> And rhetoric, to him, is part of argumentation - "Rhetoric is a counterpart of Dialectic; [...] all men in a manner have a share of both; for all, up to a certain point, endeavor to criticize or uphold an argument, to defend themselves or to accuse." (Rhetoric 1.1.1)
1320408554281574403 2020-10-26 00:55:06 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> I think no. He admits excluding rhetoric - "Let us therefore dismiss all other types of sentence but the proposition, for this last concerns our present inquiry, whereas the investigation of the others belongs rather to the study of rhetoric or of poetry." (Part 4, paragraph 3)
1320408552159301635 2020-10-26 00:55:05 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> To be pedantic, I'd say its a definition and not a claim, so I don't agree or disagree with it. There is the question, however - does he go on later to claim that his definition includes all sentences relevant to argumentation?
1320364817643900930 2020-10-25 22:01:18 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Note that he says propositions "have truth or falsity in them", and doesn't say "are true or false". Later in the work, he will argue that not every proposition is true or false.
1320364815743881219 2020-10-25 22:01:17 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> While a proposition is a sentence with truth or falsity in it - "every sentence is not a proposition; only such are propositions as have in them either truth or falsity" (Part 4, paragraph 2  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)
1320364813529337857 2020-10-25 22:01:17 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> A sentence is "a significant portion of speech, some parts of which have an independent meaning, that is to say, as an utterance, though not as the expression of any positive judgement." (Part 4, paragraph 1  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)
1320364811818029057 2020-10-25 22:01:16 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Next in "On Interpretation", Aristotle defines two more categories of signs - sentences and propositions.
1320113936411316224 2020-10-25 05:24:23 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> So time is embedded at the very bottom level of his framework. Later on in the work, the consideration of time leads him to make a controversial claim about truth.
1320113934737809408 2020-10-25 05:24:23 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> A verb is "that which, in addition to its proper meaning, carries with it the notion of time. No part of it has any independent meaning, and it is a sign said of something else." (Part 3, paragraph 1  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)
1320113931961143298 2020-10-25 05:24:22 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> A noun is "a sound significant by convention, which has no reference to time, and of which no part is significant apart from the rest." (Part 2 paragraph 1  https://t.co/nNJKx3WqdK)
1320113930396704776 2020-10-25 05:24:22 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> Aristotle's "On Interpretation" begins by defining two categories of signs - nouns and verbs.
1319664977624649728 2020-10-23 23:40:23 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> The earliest works of formal logic are Aristotle's "On Interpretation" and his "Prior Analytics". The first is simpler, so I'll begin with that.
1319663502592704512 2020-10-23 23:34:31 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> My approach for each work : first, condense it to a list of its major claims. For each claim, I'll include the excerpt where it is developed. Then, I'll write a list of concise reflections. No reflection will reference a work other than those already studied. #ancientphilosophy
1319305649029812224 2020-10-22 23:52:32 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @WhyJenWhy Another which might be relevant - Zeno's thought experiments were arguably built to support Parmenides' monism. But they were taken by Atomists to imply atomism ( https://t.co/rFPeJcVq4T).
1319302971826593793 2020-10-22 23:41:54 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @WhyJenWhy Ok I understand now. This is a fun question.
1319252577742106630 2020-10-22 20:21:39 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @ETVPod I believe the first is Parmenides (?) At least in the West...
1319247936686096384 2020-10-22 20:03:13 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @WhyJenWhy If the thought experiment is used by many people to make a certain argument, and many people disagree with the conclusion, does that make the thought experiment commonly and thoroughly misunderstood (whether the argument is valid or not) ? If so, I would propose "Mary's Room".
1319246113396981761 2020-10-22 19:55:58 +0800 <TruthOfSigns> @evanewashington They at least share the same last name
