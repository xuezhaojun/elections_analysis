1343117365882580994 2020-12-27 16:51:48 +0800 <watoveryou> @PhillDKline When it’s the Republicans’ election it’s fraud, when it’s the Democratic’s Election it’s a lost. That picture doesn’t look right. Hillary Clinton won, Russia helped Trump steal that election, but it was ok. You reap what you sow. Get over it 🙏🏽

1328136128319414278 2020-11-16 08:41:43 +0800 <watoveryou> @realDonaldTrump Trump ran the campaign for Biden, what he said and did sicken the people and the people spoke. A loser was not what they wanted.
1328134845818613761 2020-11-16 08:36:37 +0800 <watoveryou> @realDonaldTrump Who cares what Paul Ewell writes, Biden is President 2021 🇺🇸
