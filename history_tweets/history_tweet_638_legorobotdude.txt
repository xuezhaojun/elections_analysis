1333148263952887808 2020-11-30 04:38:09 +0800 <legorobotdude> @DianaWintah Sorry to hear that, life is so fragile and it's far too easy to forget that in our day to day lives
1327874652362956804 2020-11-15 15:22:42 +0800 <legorobotdude> @gameism Yeah that was easily the strangest "side quest" that I have ever played, wonder why they added it
1325138848133894145 2020-11-08 02:11:35 +0800 <legorobotdude> @bioware Very excited for this but I wish they had modernized the combat in the first game, it's quite clunky compared to the buttery smooth 2nd and 3rd games
1323127211344494592 2020-11-02 12:58:04 +0800 <legorobotdude> @kvlly Same story here, which is why its important to call out the horrific gun control policies in Joe Biden's and the Democratic parties platform. Regulating "high capacity" magazines under the NFA will only disarm the underprivileged. ($200 tax stamp per registration)

1306910739291082760 2020-09-18 18:59:36 +0800 <legorobotdude> @onefrostylady Yeah the presentation is a big part of why they are so believable, they throw a lot of "evidence" out, some of which may be individually true, and then twist it to lead to their conclusion
1306904995124609024 2020-09-18 18:36:46 +0800 <legorobotdude> @onefrostylady Yeah I fell for the Wayfair thing too, and also consider myself somewhat skeptical. Conspiracy theories can be extremely convincing, and things aren't made better by the fact that we live in a batshit crazy world.
