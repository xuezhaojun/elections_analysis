My SJW sister and her 3 brainwashed sons who moved here from CO and are proud D voters won't be getting anything from my estate when I'm gone. They just screwed themselves bc I have no one else to leave it to. Now there will be nothing left of it after tax.

The sheriff idk. He was older, overweight but so are most of us who have been doing this job for over 30 years.

I tried humor then reasoning and finally anger, though I never got as nasty as she. She ended up uninviting me to her home. Libs r truly nasty ppl.

Her old team even asked her to come out of retirement to compete. She's so full of herself in every way but I'm waiting for her to run her mouth to the wrong blm ppl.

He just kept shaking his head and saying he had a black belt in karate and was something in some other kind of martial art. He was so humiliated and I felt so bad for him.

All that defensive tactic, martial arts stuff goes right out the window.  No one is going to sit still while you try to set up your move. Only one DT move has ever worked for me every time I've used it. The rest is bs.

It may have been by accident too. I get up at 0430 for work and one night I was tired and blocking a bunch of lib accounts. I accidentally blocked a follower but caught my mistake about 5 minutes later and corrected it. Newsmax lady has tons of followers so....
1343250353723211778 2020-12-28 01:40:15 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @alfajean Aw, they were just checking each other out.

There's an app on certain phones that can make the pic appear the way it does. I had one on my old phone. Made my bird pics ethereal.

1343209944842166272 2020-12-27 22:59:41 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @jusklntym I took a chance and followed an alleged maga account with 8 followers. On Christmas he threatened my life. I told him he didn't have the balls. His account and tweets disappeared and I never bothered reporting or even unfollowed him. He was on a train when I followed him back.
1343208909209808896 2020-12-27 22:55:34 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Donadeedooda For the most part they're all talk. The only situation you need to worry about is if a large group were to corner you alone. Hopefully you carry. If you don't, find something. Besides being armed I keep a titanium crowbar down by my driver's seat. Wonderful makeshift weapon.

I wasn't impressed with the FBI, especially after 9/11. In fact they got our department sued due to one of their screw ups. They're overrated.

1342985940990623746 2020-12-27 08:09:34 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Rossmac212 The pet store where I got my birds was broken into and a lady's African Grey that was being boarded there was taken. About a year later the bird was recovered by police and owner was reunited with bird at the store. Quite emotional per the employees.

1342907702721323008 2020-12-27 02:58:41 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @LeahR77 Know what the dems in my family are getting for gifts for things like graduation,etc? A donation in their name to a charity that purchases chickens/livestock for families in 3rd world countries. Since they love socialism so much. They should be thrilled right?

Nothing has changed except now we know why. These pols have friends and family directly or indirectly involved in the programs our $ pays for and eventually it gets back to them.

1342884110474293249 2020-12-27 01:24:56 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DinoKasamis I remember that blizzard. We lost power for 4 days I think. Parents cooked dinner in our fireplace, put blankets over the entryway to our living room.
1342880306957869060 2020-12-27 01:09:49 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @jerrykirby54 @LisaLewellyan Yes but the ones I know have children they want to have a social safety net for instead of working and struggling and saving like I did. They want them to have everything we had to work all our lives for and they want us to pay the tab.
1342669424151715843 2020-12-26 11:11:50 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DontHateMe4That @DennisT55552922 @1PatriotForLife Thanks we'll see. We had some hellacious winters in the 2000s but in the last few years we've had some mild ones with only a few bad storms. Hell we've made it to December 24 with only one dusting of snow in Nov I think. If this is global warming, bring it!
1342668436057546753 2020-12-26 11:07:55 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Thanks for helping me stay up to watch this film. Gonna sign off now, getting sleepy. 👍
1342667653731799041 2020-12-26 11:04:48 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Of course Sharon's was the worst. She saw all of them killed and knew she was going to die, along with her baby. Those scumbags should have died in the gas chamber except the liberals felt sorry for them. They all got more years than they deserved. The poor LaBiancas too
1342665483682799617 2020-12-26 10:56:11 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DontHateMe4That @DennisT55552922 @1PatriotForLife Yeah about 25 years ago. I work both inside and out. I also work 7 and 8 days in a row before I get my leave days. Fighting snow and ice going to and from work then working 8 to up to 16 hrs in it killed any desire for it.
1342663240858402816 2020-12-26 10:47:16 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Jay Sebring's grave. He was in a cemetery only a few miles from my first condo but I didn't go there until recently.  I was glad to see he hasn't been forgotten. He died a terrible but noble death trying to defend Sharon and his friends. Got to respect that.  https://t.co/sZpfuvKGNN
1342661489082118146 2020-12-26 10:40:19 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @trisagoras Yep
1342661258278023169 2020-12-26 10:39:24 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne I saw that, was surprised he lived that long. Another long living one was Jonathan Frid who I loved in Dark Shadows. Had a crush on him too.
1342659601368555522 2020-12-26 10:32:49 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne I had a crush on VP.
1342659300716634115 2020-12-26 10:31:37 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne That was the kind of horror I wanted to see, not just people being killed. Saw it in the big screen twice with friends. Good freak out stuff. The Tall Man!
1342658614734041088 2020-12-26 10:28:53 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Now though I'm really into true crime. Started when the Manson murders happened though that wasn't yet known. I remember how freaked everyone was. My parents got helter skelter as soon as it came out and I would read it whenever it was put down. I taught myself to read young.
1342657524286312455 2020-12-26 10:24:33 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne I bookmarked your tweet. I'll check it out thanks.
1342653087903846400 2020-12-26 10:06:56 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Oh and Halloween, which I also really dug. I was a death hag before the term was even conceived. I was a strange child.
1342652640694566913 2020-12-26 10:05:09 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Oh yeah. Back then the only horror movies that were around were the creature features on Saturday TV. Vincent Price American International/Hammer films. Pretty tame. Nothing til Fri the 13th and Phantasm, which was really good for its time.
1342645735955820549 2020-12-26 09:37:43 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Thank you. I've been up since 0430 so I might not make it to my favorite part at the end
1342645404597366784 2020-12-26 09:36:24 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Oh I'm sure that will be done. One guy went to funeral home for someone who did him dirty and sprinkled the coffin and body with urine he collected in a container. I know the story of why and fully agreed with what he did.
1342644421075066881 2020-12-26 09:32:29 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Perhaps but it's never held my interest.
1342644232071348224 2020-12-26 09:31:44 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Unfortunately being a woman there's not really much I can do about that but I know several guys who hate these people just as much and will definitely be making a contribution. I'm talking about some really rotten people. I'm amazed there was never a workplace shooting, cameclose
1342643285324607488 2020-12-26 09:27:58 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Great acting in this ne too. Albert Finney was only 32 when he made this and plays his younger version himself.  Alec Guiness in it too. There's a cult following of this version who fully feels the same way.
1342641892308168706 2020-12-26 09:22:26 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne Then there was the Thank You Very Much song when Scrooge died and they were dancing on his coffin. As an adult I'm going to be doing that in real life when several dirtbag supervisors I had die. I'm waiting in anticipation except I won't actually be dancing on coffins. Justgraves
1342641069570355200 2020-12-26 09:19:10 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @tedthorne I tried watching just about every version of that story. Lose interest in 1st 5 minutes. If you saw it when u were a kid u would understand. Scrooge gets sent to hell and for a good horror deprived kid, it was awesome! There were no good scary movies back then...1
1342639993953644549 2020-12-26 09:14:54 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @liquidlaugh @EllyMoo81569270 2...I know one of them who actually vomited a couple times at what they saw and the other one came very close. But these are 2 decent family men with children. That was years ago and you can tell they are still badly affected by it.
1342639339168268290 2020-12-26 09:12:18 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @liquidlaugh @EllyMoo81569270 Probably have their own copies to watch. I work w 2 guys who started the 1st internet crimes task force when we were still part of the sheriff's department. They saw things they won't talk about to this day they are so traumatized....1
1342637761011048450 2020-12-26 09:06:01 +0800 <Jennife20311813> The 1970 Scrooge is on the Movies channel 82 in the Detroit area, Spectrum. The only version I will watch. Just started.
1342632997821034503 2020-12-26 08:47:06 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @GidgetM7 Cottage Inn Spicy Mediterranean deep dish with sesame seed crust. Back in the 80s this was the only way they would make that order and it was the best. Now you can get chicken on it, different crusts and have to order the sesame seeds. Not as good as original.

They know how important and loved they are. They're also don't hold back when they're upset with me and know how to push my buttons, just like kids!

To much of it is addictive and I'm so set in my ways now. I have 2 parrots that I share my home and life with and we're very content. It's like having 2 perpetually intelligent 4-6 year olds!

I'm single, always wanted to be married, etc but I have major trust issues. I let the one true live of my life go a long time ago and have never found another.

1341867683252453376 2020-12-24 06:06:01 +0800 <Jennife20311813> I'm so sick of the violence, especially against the elderly. In a Detroit suburb an elderly woman is stabbed to death, husband of 60 yrs stabbed too but still alive. I'm so angry I'm shaking.
1341866163316420618 2020-12-24 05:59:58 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Truth1sfreedom @EpochTimes Time is of the essence. He needs to start rolling like yesterday.

1341859744311599104 2020-12-24 05:34:28 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @MsAvaArmstrong Ava, did you read the pathetic comments under her thread? Omg, what a generation of wad wastes! Half of them will commit suicide by the time they're 40, the other half will require lifetime therapy. They won't be taking care of us in our old age, we'll still be wiping their asses

1341849989048352770 2020-12-24 04:55:42 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @WomenUnitedFro2 You have to be fairly wealthy to even run for office nowadays. I've been a low level public servant for 30 years and because I've been an honest one I have very little. I only do ok because I live within my means.
1341848893613625351 2020-12-24 04:51:21 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Truth1sfreedom @EpochTimes If the election was so free and clear, like the Democrats keep pointing out, why is s lawsuit needed to see the equipment? Is that how true winners behave? If I truly won a contest I would probably deliver the evidence to those questioning myself.

Just wait until you all get out in the world without your mommy backing you up and wiping your asses. The world doesn't give one fuq about your feelings and will eat you alive if you don't toughen up. Glad my parents prepared me for life.

You consider low fuel prices and low mortgage rates th same? You're a loser who should consider ending it all. You're nothing but a parasite who expects ppl like me to support you
1341842614140739587 2020-12-24 04:26:24 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @WomenUnitedFro2 He's good at fooling himself and he's surrounded by boot licking yes ppl who will convince him when he has a few brief minutes of lucidity and knows something is wrong. Chief being that overqualified English teacher he's married to.
1341841785719582722 2020-12-24 04:23:06 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @theleveloftime He didn't fail. He wasn't the main reason I changed from a left leaning independent but I listened to him even when I didn't agree w most of what he was saying. Life began showing me he was correct more and more. Dems showed me what 2 faced liars they truly are. It was a mix.

1341746352020205568 2020-12-23 22:03:53 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @SheepDogSociety Idiots. They can't even get along amongst themselves. This is how socialism/communism is run at all levels. Btw, I've never heard of one incident or problem involving Cornell University campus police in my 30 years in LE. Sounds like they need to create drama to cry about sumtin.

Yet it is the way underdeveloped adults who want to exert authority over others choose time and again. They know they cannot impress their peers so they lead kids. Comrade Flute indeed.

1341519048157368322 2020-12-23 07:00:39 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @WomenUnitedFro2 You're lucky. It takes some spice out of your life when the desire does indeed die. I envy you.
1341518229198544910 2020-12-23 06:57:24 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @WomenUnitedFro2 I always wanted to be married, perhaps a little too much so I came close for all the wrong reasons. With a few wrong ones.
1341517656004980737 2020-12-23 06:55:08 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @WomenUnitedFro2 I will be the hit at the retirement home. I'll be ready by then.

1341502439791443970 2020-12-23 05:54:40 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @JocelynBenson Then why did you destroy evidence that was supposed to be retained for two years by law? As a life long Michigan resident and tax payer I want to know.

The pretend presidential elect Biden has about 8 accusers now and not one has been backed by the metoo hacks. Neither has his druggie son been called out for underage girls.

I will be bringing Red Ryder BB guns, toy guns, Nerf guns, dolls with glitter and Battleship and Monopoly games.

The hell that's coming if the left gets its way will bring suffering to everyone.

He sings spongebob song, goofy songs from the 60s to the 80s that I taught him, even parts of alternative rock songs. All sorts of stuff.

He's a chatterbox who sings recognizable songs, he hums, whistles and says all kind of stuff. Never spoke until I bought my Eclectus who knew the basics, then he surpassed him. His 1st sentence was, Knock it off and You're pissing me off, bc

1338979925882265602 2020-12-16 06:51:06 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @American1299 I certainly hope that turns out to be true. We need the following from Michigan to join them: Nessel, Benson and Whitmer. A bonus would be Peters, Stevens and Slotkin, not to mention the new Livonia mayor. No way a Democrat won Livonia, I think the machines were manipulated.

They were doing their damndest prior to Trump's election and using this alleged pandemic to finish their abhorrent plan. No doubt in my mind.

I was in mobile field force w my 1st department over 25 years ago. It's obvious these departments haven't even given them the basics. It's not hard and takes about 2 days.
1337911997481050126 2020-12-13 08:07:32 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @patvela3 Wonder how Twana Brawley is doing these days. I've seen him in person several times in the last few years, keep wanting to ask him. The last 2 times he was like a corpse in his wheelchair and his people just push him around.

1337558294710390788 2020-12-12 08:42:02 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AlexPeresviet Well yes as an individual I could refuse it but could my employer say fine, you can't work here if you don't? I'm going on 25 yrs with this department and I'm in for the long haul til I get my retirement.
1337557452628307970 2020-12-12 08:38:41 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @PrezElectFungi Always am.

1337549978051489798 2020-12-12 08:08:59 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AlexPeresviet Now I have also worry about this vaccine approval. It will probably be offered to us at work pretty quickly and I'm not sure about it. I hope my department won't make it mandatory.
1337548642392154114 2020-12-12 08:03:41 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AlexPeresviet See he could do that but he has so much he can do with his life after politics. He's not like these bottom feeding professional politicians who are not qualified to get real jobs if they get voted out. It's going to be his choice.
1337547152852197377 2020-12-12 07:57:46 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @pittman_george I think he can now act on the 2018 Executive Order.
1337546659509788681 2020-12-12 07:55:48 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Suechan28145375 The 2018 Executive Order. Probably could find some backup in the Patriot Act as well.
1337546102233587712 2020-12-12 07:53:35 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @CallingBSonU I think he could now act on the 2018 Executive Order if he chooses to.
1337545642730807296 2020-12-12 07:51:46 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AlexPeresviet Imo he can now act on the 2018 Executive Order with backing from the Patriot Act if he chooses to do do. That's the key, if he chooses.
1337545018001780739 2020-12-12 07:49:17 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @sayitnspinit @realDonaldTrump It's going to be fun watching the libs  own the trainwreck they set in motion. It will hurt us all but we've survived worse. I still think he could take action based on the 2018 Executive Order not to mention the Patriot Act for back up.
1337544062396731398 2020-12-12 07:45:29 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @InfidelAngela 2018 Executive Order imo.
1337543453165703168 2020-12-12 07:43:04 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AlexPeresviet Well I guess we go to the 2018 EO.
1337542794047582212 2020-12-12 07:40:27 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AlexPeresviet Just saw some tweets that scotus denied Texas suit.

1337494598839635971 2020-12-12 04:28:56 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @dananessel And you're hiding the forensic audit from Antrim County from us life long Michigan tax payers. If this was a free and fair election then you should have nothing to hide. What are you scared of?
1337490317063426051 2020-12-12 04:11:55 +0800 <Jennife20311813> It's December 11 in Michigan and it's 50 degrees out. If this is global warming BRING IT!!!!

Don't let the leftists fool you though. I have a SJW sibling who trolls conservatives so she has seen all the Biden stories prior to the election and she has knowledge of the EO. I give no quarter.

I'm of the opinion that the left who started this mess are lying when saying they had no idea what was going on simply bc they don't want to own the mistake they made. They troll us, they see what's in our social media. I'm making someone pay.
1337183561498189824 2020-12-11 07:52:59 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @helenckh Looks like what my parrots do.

1337182885166592001 2020-12-11 07:50:18 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Why haven't the national news outlets mentioned anything about the 2018 EO concerning election fraud? They are making it out like Trump is just doing these challenges on his own.

My SJW sibling brags about trolling conservatives so she and the rest had to have seen what's going on. They don't want to own the mistake they created when this social experiment goes south.

Anyone who has ever been falsely accused would be demanding the chance to defend themselves. It's happened to me and I'm sure it's happened to you. Why then are they hiding?

Good thing is that real Detroiters don't want these outside agitators coming in and causing more problems than they already have.
1336435576640245761 2020-12-09 06:20:45 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @MrAmericanPatr1 I saw an interview where a small business owner said he's lost 5 friends to it. I live in a nice city and during the BO admin recession I  was told by a cop that there were suicides here quite frequently at that time.
1336434736038879234 2020-12-09 06:17:25 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Godscountry63 I know what you're saying. I'm always armed and been trained in tactics for 30 years. I just don't know how much I could take before grabbing several items from my arsenal. Perhaps if they could get a large group of Patriots to start tearing their shit down and escorting themout

I was such a fan of MADTV and of her and Michael McDonald especially. Their show was an equal opportunity offender who left no sacred cow unslaughtered. They made fun of everyone.

KK was very corrupt, I have 1st hand knowledge but if neither Biden is in prison he shouldn't be either.

1331013049914941447 2020-11-24 07:13:34 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @GregFlippen Actually I would do both. First though, I'm known for not answering my door unless I know who is there and why. Acquaintances know to give me a call 1st. I live by myself so if I'm not first contacted or expecting a signed delivery, the person isn't welcome.

Either with bare feet or with shoes on put your toes up against the door at a 45 degree angle with their base/front of your ball flatly against the floor.

1328874031160946690 2020-11-18 09:33:52 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AHMalcolm Imagine Biden knowing that Trump is constantly breathing down his neck and watching everything he does, listening to everything he says and taking notes on it all.

We tax payers are going to have to pay for the audit to be done but I'm not bitching. After all the other nonsense we have to foot the bill for, I have no problem with it.

1328529003985199104 2020-11-17 10:42:52 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Orangezipple1 @cleflore23 @mjd_america I believe has to do with insurance. If someone got one of those and killed a person with it, there could be lawsuits. Risk Management takes that into consideration and if the department's policy doesn't cover it, it's a no go. Which there won't be a policy bc it's expensive.

The DC is pretty strict about carrying a concealed firearm that's why I'm guessing he will be in hot water. I've seen ppl on prob who were sent back to prison for failing a drug test here in Wayne County (Detroit area).

They'll starve you out in court until you lose everything. Already had a bad injury accident that went nowhere.

I have a SJW sibling, a white blond at that, who thinks she knows all about being black bc she adopted a son from Nigeria. This woman would put her in her place and I'd love to see it.

See, Wretched Gretchen is pretty short handed when it comes to enforcement personnel. We locals don't have the time or inclination to enforce state law for her so she's on her own.

I also know the former Wayne County CEO, Ficano, did the same when he was in office. As a taxpayer of both jurisdictions I wondered why those trips were made.

Those who sleep around at work get specialty training/assignments/ treatment and promotions over those of us who do not. Also get promotions they didn't truly earn.

1325603329637048320 2020-11-09 08:57:16 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @CondoleezzaRice Lol, lady you can't have had a straight face when you typed that out. Check with your own party, see who's calling for lists, see who's calling for our destruction. Start with AOC. GGF.
1325602661190815744 2020-11-09 08:54:37 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DolioJ That's true we do shy away, me especially. However there are lines in the sand for me and once it's crossed where I can take legal action against a perpetrator I will.

1325595290653618179 2020-11-09 08:25:20 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Mouse1Noisy @davidf4444 I'll be one of those survivors. Bitch better hope she doesn't run into me. Or you or any of us.
1325593768960077826 2020-11-09 08:19:17 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DolioJ Really? That's embarrassing for me. Hell they trained all of us in nonlethal weapons when that's usually (until now) strictly for SWAT members. Not any in depth training but still...

1325583452469678080 2020-11-09 07:38:17 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @liquidlaugh They definitely want Kumhola in as president.

1325582329004363776 2020-11-09 07:33:50 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @liquidlaugh I found one on the corner not 2 miles from home on my way home from work. I joined for an hour or so.  It was about 70 degrees with the sun still out. Oh and I got to sign the petition to recall the governor while I was there-a bonus!
1325581524352249856 2020-11-09 07:30:38 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @NanaLuvsShoes @EllyMoo81569270 Thank you. I'm an officer as well and there will be no reconciliation on my part. Those folks want us dead.

I have mass texts from my virtue signaling SJW sibling, all nasty when mine clearly show I tried patience and  humor to deflect her. I finally had to threaten to put them on her social media to unmask her to get the venomous texts to stop.

A Biden presidency will most likely ruin my plan for retirement (investments), taxes, and health care (I've spent years in a job I really wanted to leave in order to have good insurance). I won't forgive anyone who voted for all that to be taken away.

1325564682829180930 2020-11-09 06:23:42 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @WillemLafluer I found a peaceful Trump protest about 2 miles from home and joined for an hour. Mostly positive reactions, I'm not sure if we got a total of 10 pissed off but a few were.
1325563206119600129 2020-11-09 06:17:50 +0800 <Jennife20311813> I went to get some bird food after work and lo and behold-a peaceful Trump protest. So I had to join in for an hour or so. Positive reactions greatly outweighed a few negative.  https://t.co/ohsHhkw352

1325518113157341191 2020-11-09 03:18:39 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @KSilverhill Lol look at these replies. Generations of wimps. Best to teach your kids that the world doesn't care about their feelings and prepare them for real life. Otherwise they will be teat babies for life, if they don't commit suicide first.

1325266873886400512 2020-11-08 10:40:19 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Daytobehappy I pretty much did the same. Even if I saw something about him on TV I pretty much didn't pay attention. I have 2 demanding parrots who divert my attention away from anything that is not them.
1325261800447815682 2020-11-08 10:20:10 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @MrAndyNgo Yeah yeah yeah pantifa, we know you think anyone who doesn't agree with you is racist.
1325258760743489536 2020-11-08 10:08:05 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @saucy_paige 😆😆😆😆😆 Cheering on the architect behind the very bill that locked up so many of their own community over petty drug offenses. Also must be happy for Kumhola, one who vigorously convicted so many of them. Doesn't get any better than this!

1325248159296217088 2020-11-08 09:25:57 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @no_silenced I'm now finding it hilarious that they were conned into voting for the guy who supported every crime bill that decimated their communities and now this. They shot themselves in the foot and now I have zero sympathy. They can reap what they have sown.
1325247435527102467 2020-11-08 09:23:05 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @brad89739161 I remember that.

1325237326554025985 2020-11-08 08:42:55 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DustyMouthKraca Hell you didn't even have to build them yourself to be exposed to it. Unless you were an only child. I got chemistry set for kids that was complete with a real Bunsen burner. Think I was about 8, then got another w/in 2 yrs to replace supplies. We were tough, not creampuffs.

1325227194579349504 2020-11-08 08:02:39 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @chesapeakemark Want one more? For presents for graduations, B day, Christmas, etc here's the perfect gift: find a charity that purchases livestock/chickens to 3rd world families and give a donation in their name. They will be thrilled with the thank you card.
1325225703516893185 2020-11-08 07:56:43 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @chesapeakemark Agreed. Here's another one, family members who proudly voted D are going to be facing job losses, foreclosure on homes, et al. Don't give or lend them money or cosign a loan. Let them live with their choices. I'll need money for my own additional social justice tax, so sorry.
1325222414654074882 2020-11-08 07:43:39 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @usa_is_free @HindsTerrence He abused his public office to financially benefit himself and his family. I'm a low level public servant and if I did anything like that I would be unemployed and facing charges.

They shot themselves in the foot and I intend to enjoy the show if he actually becomes president.

1325215446149210113 2020-11-08 07:15:58 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @idinamenzel Are you going to correct your kid and tell him BO started it or will you let him live with a lie, thinking it was all Trump? Rhetorical question, I already know the answer.

DETROIT PD, notorious for never picking up on their warrants even felonies, actually delivering an alleged arrestee? I'm not a litigious person but if I were him I would see if a local atty would pick it up on contingency.

1324830359553560589 2020-11-07 05:45:46 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DEPLORABLEREEG1 @Fred_Cathy_Ret My advice to those with proud Biden voters in their family: if they get into financial trouble bc of high taxes/job loss, et al do not give or lend them money or cosign a loan. Let them lose everything, tell them you need that cash for your own social justice tax bill.
1324821727847849993 2020-11-07 05:11:28 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @ivorbiggin9 I hope the feds are intending to impound all of the ballots in all states.

1324818471583129605 2020-11-07 04:58:32 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Let me go further: I suggest for gifts that you contact charities that buy livestock/chickens for families in 3rd world countries and donate in their name. They will be thrilled with the card they get.
1324817646370672646 2020-11-07 04:55:15 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @beth2_k3a @stephphilip8 Don't give or lend money or cosign a loan for your proud Biden voting family members when they are about to lose everything they have. For gifts, look up charities that buy cows or chickens for families in 3rd world countries and donate in their name, give them the update card.
1324816304625360903 2020-11-07 04:49:55 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @karystus @RealJamesWoods They have an agenda all right. To keep their cushy, comfortable jobs and make lots of money and jobs for their family members. Both sides of the aisle.

1324811001414537216 2020-11-07 04:28:51 +0800 <Jennife20311813> My advice to those with SJW, proud Biden voters in their family: if Biden gets in there will be job losses and higher taxes for everyone. Don't give or lend them money or cosign a loan  4 them, even if they're losing their house. Let them lose everything, they deserve it.
1324809556308971521 2020-11-07 04:23:06 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @silverhornet4 Amen to that. Until 2016 I was an independent voter and I would have agreed with this decades ago.

1324121323593965578 2020-11-05 06:48:19 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @lexxstones In 2000 I had done my homework on GWB and knew he was bad news. I didn't shed tears over his election but I went ice cold and hoped everyone who voted for him got what they deserved. This is my hope if Biden wins. His voters get everything and more that they deserve.

I told them I had my own pen (due to covid, at work we're in the habit of using our own). They told me to use one of their felt markers and it would be collected when I finished. I live in a traditionally conservative district

I went in one week before to cancel it myself so I could vote in person. I'm talking about tracking the live ballot I cast yesterday. I can't find a site to see the result for live ballots.

1323870756875522050 2020-11-04 14:12:39 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Oh btw....Whitmer and Nessel, you're next to be thrown out on your asses in two years.

1323829009285861376 2020-11-04 11:26:46 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @NightMaga I figured. I want to see her cry again only not on YouTube.
1323828640644272128 2020-11-04 11:25:18 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @redwins3_first Good. The Democrats got hold of my number thinking I was an ally. I almost got on the phone during her town hall meetings but I think the screeners realized I was a hostile caller. I wanted to blast her if I would have gotten through.
1323827632295813126 2020-11-04 11:21:17 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @SpartyPatriot Earlier I saw that little Haley Stevens was getting stomped, which warmed my heart. That was a while ago though.

I said Buck up boys, I don't think this is over by a long shot. And it wasn't.

I was young but had a father who studied politics the way young boys studied their favorite baseball teams/players. Knew all their voting statistics, what they were in favor for. Not just local and state pols either. Unever wanted to pick a political debate w him

1323647251068133377 2020-11-03 23:24:31 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Just returned from voting.  Didn't get much sleep last night so I didn't mess with the Democrat poll trolls in the lot. I did drive by the Biden/Harris guys in plastic aprons and yelled, Trump Trump baby! on the way out.

It's really hard for me to have sympathy for them. I warned everyone who would listen what Whitmer was all about but it fell on a lot of deaf ears.
1323431443092176897 2020-11-03 09:06:58 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @SailorSam_1 I understand that some of them are government employees. Why haven't they been met by HR and security and escorted off the premises, never to return?

1323410470808768521 2020-11-03 07:43:38 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @ShawnG927 As I would have been. We know how Biden and company feels about us and about 90% of us have/are voting for Trump! Even our usually Democrat endorsing unions have endorsed Trump instead this year, not that we've ever cared about their endorsements.

1323404412908408832 2020-11-03 07:19:34 +0800 <Jennife20311813> 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆   Just got a text msg from the ACLU asking me to vote for their recommended judges. I let them know how I really feel about them and the left! I love that the dems got ahold of my number and consider me an ally. I've destroyed them via text msgs&amp;polls!
1323400020167634952 2020-11-03 07:02:07 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DolioJ I know years ago, like from the 50s to about the 70s they did have some racist pricks running it, Dearborn too. Things have changed and the minorities who live here are great and very happy to be here.

I developed this weird obsession about eating better meals (not necessarily healthy) bc I didn't want my last meal to be a stale monster slim Jim or crappy McDonalds. I frequently worried if I would live to see the morning.
1323395333615984644 2020-11-03 06:43:29 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @IndyLisa09 @JackPosobiec Amen to that. Been OTJ since 1989, was never worried or concerned through all the troubles of the 90s, 9/11 didn't phase me bc I paid attention to world events prior to. But under BO, cops getting killed left and right, I began to get nervous. Trump restored my confidence.

I think the process of who gets appointed to the EC needs to be investigated and overhauled. I was taught they were supposed to be people of integrity who would vote as their state did even if they didn't agree with the choice. She doesn't fit.

In fact Democrats love crime and want us all to be equal opportunity victims. That's why they're obsessed about disarming us.

I also saw a pic of the white vehicle and from the yaw marks and other visual evidence I could see that the driver attempted to enter a lane that was already occupied. I can send you the vid of the white vehicle cut into the truck if you would like me to.

The evidence is right in the picture. The owner needs to stop playing victim. Any first level accident investigator can spot it.

1322713717721702402 2020-11-01 09:34:59 +0800 <Jennife20311813> So happy my union and my sister unions in order states all endorsed Trump! Law and order President vs. Pantifa/BLM, defund police and obolish ICE  https://t.co/la7wk1ezqI brainer, no thanks.

Who on your side is condemning them and financing them? Let's not get holier than thou.

I'm originally from Flint and still have distant family living there. I couldn't believe that video when I saw it. I caught a thread where a lot of residents were pissed and insulted, as they should be.

She never fully grew up and left the college campus. She fills their heads with all that feel good liberal BS. And she actually believes it all herself. You can't tell her anything, she knows it all. A true narcissist.

Hopefully it happens right before I croak so I can laugh my ass off and say told you so

We're close to Detroit but they have had minimal problems compared to the rest of the Democrat run cities. Real Detroiters made it clear they won't put up with outside agitators coming into....

I'm sure he will be snatched up by another department since he's already certified and ready to hit the street. I feel bad for the ones who have a lot of seniority invested but not enough to  retire...
1322661160265621505 2020-11-01 06:06:09 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @mikesellgroup @USTexasPatriot1 I've even urged those falsely accused to file civil lawsuits where the threshold of guilt/responsibility is considerably lower than in criminal court. Let them know I would testify for them. Never been called to a case.
1322660455706484737 2020-11-01 06:03:21 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @mikesellgroup @USTexasPatriot1 I do my best to remind them but don't get any back up from command or DA. I've taken reports of totally fabricated crimes with false accusations where the investigations took hours of manpower. Not once have any of these people been prosecuted or forced to pay restitution.
1322659593001066497 2020-11-01 05:59:55 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @JoeFreedomLove They need to form a force to go to these protesters homes, forcefully pack up their household and family members and forcefully put them on the first flight back to their country of origin. Enough is enough, they've worn out their welcome.
1322658163401887744 2020-11-01 05:54:14 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @shoeless_1 @SicarioScott She needs to move to a country where she will be surrounded by N Korean, CCP or Venezuelan flags. I'm sure she would feel better. However to me, she has forfeited her choice and should be sent packing.

1322655622073122817 2020-11-01 05:44:08 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @cblcrshr @Kandyo8 I've been wondering all this time how Hunter has not been hounded over his known illegal drug use when his father is responsible for the persecution of ppl who were doing way less dangerous drugs. Rhetorical question I know. One of us would have been locked up a long time ago.
1322653687702016003 2020-11-01 05:36:27 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @WVRedElephant @BuzzPatterson Well he certainly can afford a first rate nursing/retirement home unlike my grandmothers who both ended up in 3rd rate 3rd world type nursing homes. And as I probably will.
1322652542627647488 2020-11-01 05:31:54 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @RandahArena I was talking to my dad about it bc he knows how she is. I told him I don't think it's going to be the utopia she imagines it will be but that's her problem.
1322651196059013120 2020-11-01 05:26:33 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @RandahArena Oh I have to warn you. My obnoxious SJW sibling is threatening to move to your country if Trump is reelected. She's a very determined person besides being a narcissistic know it all so I wouldn't put it past her. She works in the health care field and could probably land a job.
1322650351783260160 2020-11-01 05:23:12 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @RandahArena Love back to you all.

Actually qualified the first time at each distance/stance and didn't have to reshoot. Thanks again for your help.
1322647850166046720 2020-11-01 05:13:15 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @AlexPeresviet @Jim_Jordan @DavidHD74025963 Yes. I'm quite a student of history, both education wise and personal interest/self education so I know what you're saying. I still have a hard time letting that sink in.
1322647054007652355 2020-11-01 05:10:05 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DudeKing12 @KLUsa45 I would be showing him the door within the first five minutes.

1322646316099448832 2020-11-01 05:07:09 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @realDonaldTrump There's a shameful video out there of BO meeting with Flint residents affected by the water crisis. He was patronizing and arrogant and I saw a lot comments from residents who were totally pissed off by him and his cavalier attitude.
1322645079308308481 2020-11-01 05:02:15 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Patrykia @realDonaldTrump Oh yeah? Well I caught H1N1 and was never so sick in my life, went to bed a couple times doubting I would be waking up in the morning. I didn't blame BO, didn't even associate my illness with him. Then again, I grew up with both a father and a mother who taught self reliance.

1322639768010821636 2020-11-01 04:41:08 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @mikesellgroup @USTexasPatriot1 Val, I do get stupid calls like this. These people are what I call energy vampires, sucking the life out of others for their own edification. Unfortunately we get no backing if we try to arrest for false/frivolous calls and I've been pushing for it for 30 years.
1322639060943446018 2020-11-01 04:38:20 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @USTexasPatriot1 Wait a minute, she called the cops bc ppl had American flags? I would have arrested her for making a false police report though the charges would have been dropped. If she doesn't like it here she can go to a country where she is surrounded by N Korean or CCP flags. I'll chip in.
1322636278064709636 2020-11-01 04:27:16 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @goldhat_lou @JackPosobiec Yeah, I buy that he's been around a long time. On the, He knows more than most people, not so much. He's been sucking at the public teat for 47 years, surrounded by yes men and women. That's not living in reality, that's living in a bubble. For 47 years.
1322635144302333952 2020-11-01 04:22:46 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @LJuly1989 @JackPosobiec I can't believe no one in that room backed the guy asking questions. We all know what's going on, even those living under rocks.
1322633731107147776 2020-11-01 04:17:09 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @KLUsa45 Then he said, We will use icicles as weapons until they melt in our hands and then we will release the dogs across the icy tundra where the children can pet them as they run by. The end.

Turns out I was able to get both the 3rd&amp;4th off so I went back and had the clerk spoil my ballot so I can go in person on Tue. In Michigan.

What about the people who have been beaten and killed bc their politics are different from the liberal mob's? Never mind, you don't have the guts to respond to my point
1322628162317070339 2020-11-01 03:55:01 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @jaketapper Sounds like you need a tissue. Lots and lots of tissues.

That's where he shilled for Hillary in 2016, bringing traffic on 275 and 94 to a stand still for almost an hour.

I stopped looking it was so dismal. Then I saw my end 2019 statements and was stunned at the results. Until covid hit that is..
1322282553378824194 2020-10-31 05:01:42 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Joe7993 I did an early absentee ballot since I work on election day and I'm a first responder subject to being ordered over if the shit hits the fan that day. Then managed to get both the 3rd&amp;4th off so I went back to clerk's office and had the ballot spoiled so I can vote in person.
1322281300649299968 2020-10-31 04:56:43 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @EzraDrissman @realDonaldTrump I got an absentee ballot and filled out, dropped it in clerk's box at city hall, all bc I had to work on 11/3. Then I managed to get the 3rd&amp;4th off so I went back and had the ballot spoiled so I can vote in person. It means that much to me to do it in person.

1322266279269552128 2020-10-31 03:57:02 +0800 <Jennife20311813> How humiliating would it be to have to be the person assigned to wear the "No Malarkey" tour jacket? You wouldn't even be able to sell it on Ebay. Just give it to the 1st homeless person you see next week....

1322163381252591616 2020-10-30 21:08:09 +0800 <Jennife20311813> This explains a lot. Notice where one of the unemployable youths says, We are owed. Let's make them famous: By the way, hippies smell.  https://t.co/6aTevEysQB

1321992008563646465 2020-10-30 09:47:10 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @LHeahmund @DonyPrime A thin one piece balaclava by Oregon Research. 40 bucks a few years ago, well worth the money. The one thing I never go outside without. I call it my lifesaver. Don't skimp on it and bye a cheaper one. You can get everything but the deerskin gloves at REI.
1321990557082800129 2020-10-30 09:41:24 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @LHeahmund @DonyPrime Right up until the temperature hits freezing. Socks go with 30 below, get the diabetic socks for a few bucks more, worth it. Forget the 30 below gloves, a waste of money. One more piece that is a lifesaver....

There's a guy in MI UP who makes deerskin gloves with thinsulate. DM if you're interested, I'll pass the info along. I accidentally got a regular pr of his deer skins and good.....
1321986530722926592 2020-10-30 09:25:24 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @LHeahmund @DonyPrime You should look into getting a real mink one like he had. Well worth the investment, according to him. There were nights when we were ordered over onto 16 hrs shifts and not one of us had to stifle the urge to beat him up and take it away from him.
1321978925040492545 2020-10-30 08:55:11 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @LHeahmund @DonyPrime We had a guy who ordered a real Russian fur hat, you know the tall ones? He took it to a Milner who put in posts so he could put his badge on it. He got away with wearing that hat for years.
1321978075089874944 2020-10-30 08:51:48 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @LHeahmund @DonyPrime You're quite welcome. I'm lucky if I have a car to sit in for a few moments to warm up or cool down. Or a building to step into. That hat does look damn warm and lately they've relaxed the uniform requirements on hats, as long as they're black.

1321963449115660291 2020-10-30 07:53:41 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @PattyArquette And that's exactly why we Michiganians support him. Stay in your own lane and vote in Hollyweird or wherever you're registered, if you even vote at all. We don't give a flying rat's ass about any opinion coming out of your mask hole.

My parents certainly taught us to be civil to those we don't agree with. The Democrats finally lost them during the Clinton years.
1321960194184826880 2020-10-30 07:40:45 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @David0662 It's hard to believe we grew up in the same household. I mean, my parents were a bit older but really open minded for their time. Racism or any isms were really looked down upon. Plus we were a UAW Democrat family. Now all of a sudden I'm a bigoted racist homophobe bc I support
1321959391713759233 2020-10-30 07:37:34 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @cplbooze True. But you know there are dems or just Trump haters who are eating this all up. We know who truly wants to cut social security and it isn't Trump. That's coming from a man who has tried for years. 47 in fact.
1321958130893422593 2020-10-30 07:32:33 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @cvmagreek @barelypolitix It took me over 20 years to get to day shift here, this is the only drawback. Even if you worked a double shift on mids or noons the polls would still be open.
1321956520372899841 2020-10-30 07:26:09 +0800 <Jennife20311813> My stomach is turning, listening to Biden's lies. Why is FOX giving air time to this loser? Btw it looks like Election Time At The Wax Museum.
1321954296984948736 2020-10-30 07:17:19 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @cvmagreek @barelypolitix Problem is I'm a 1st responder and if the shit hits the fan that night and mutual aid requests go out, one might be stuck at work. No worries now, got both election day and day after off. I'd miss voting in person, same polling place for 20 years, only missed 1 minor election.
1321953115189465089 2020-10-30 07:12:38 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DonyPrime All the snarky comments are written by soft little wussies who have the privilege of working in nice warm offices where other ppl take care of heat/cooling system. To those of us who work out in the elements 24/7, it looks like a damn warn hat. Bet you all have soft girlie hands

Men actually tried to snatch their kids f/ them in broad daylight. I was stunned.
1321945342909308929 2020-10-30 06:41:44 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @David0662 Well she is my sister and I still love her. There are a couple businesses in Detroit (not downtown) I have gone to for decades and ppl in the neighborhood recognize me so that alone might just keep it to a verbal beat down.
1321943901582839808 2020-10-30 06:36:01 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @David0662 Well she's not a true blond...She sounds just like my SJW sibling who likes to give those lectures. I offered to take her to the areas of Detroit where I shop and let her stand outside telling them how she's going to save them. Then I would rescue her from the inevitable beatdown
1321942169473716224 2020-10-30 06:29:08 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @cvmagreek @barelypolitix Our union used to give us national election days as a holiday. They stupidly gave it up a couple contracts ago. I'm on days now, low seniority. I was afraid of getting ordered over for a double shift which would have made me refuse the order. I can't afford another write up.

I never opened them during the BO years bc of the depressing lack of growth. Opened end of 2019 statements and was stunned at their worth, until COVID hit. Trump's got to win so I can retire comfortably
1321934897636888582 2020-10-30 06:00:14 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @cvmagreek @barelypolitix I am too but I like Twitter polls (for fun). I voted for my state, Michigan. I am worried about cheating. I got an absentee ballot and voted but since I managed to get the 3rd&amp;4th off, I went to clerk's office and had it voided. Need to go in person.
1321933599411757058 2020-10-30 05:55:05 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Oh look, another blond white woman lecturing us on being black.

They look down on and insult about lack of education even though most of them couldn't change their own car tire or fix a simple leak in their own house.

I watched a few minutes of a couple of them and that seems to be the trend

Any corporation making real money will leave this country so fast it will make your head spin. Remember the British Invasion in the late 60s? All those bands hotfooted it out of the UK into the US due to astronomical taxes. I remember that .

1321214229861584901 2020-10-28 06:16:34 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @dbongino Hey goofball, in 2000 we stood in line for over three hours to vote in a Metro Detroit precinct (Bush vs. Gore). No snacks, no seats, no whining. We understood that was the price of voting. And
1321211665543761920 2020-10-28 06:06:22 +0800 <Jennife20311813> PUKE 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮   I just saw a Joe Biden ad with the National Anthem being played in the background. Of all nerve! For 47 years he used his position to better himself and his family financially and politically off of our backs. What an obscenity to use our National Anthem!

1320832418442563589 2020-10-27 04:59:23 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @MsAvaArmstrong Here in Michigan hospitals were closing down and laying off personnel during the initial "crises".

1320814917650423814 2020-10-27 03:49:50 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Joe7993 He can go screw himself. Wonder if he took a gander at his savings  (if he had any) prior to covid when Trump was making us money and what they look like now.

1320491364824588288 2020-10-26 06:24:09 +0800 <Jennife20311813> That's because she's a major disease herself.

I became superstitious about my black mourning band for my badge and I'm not a superstitious person. I stopped putting it away in its usual place and just left it on the top shelf of my locker.
1320387000256647168 2020-10-25 23:29:27 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Election interference. Why is she allowed to get away with this?

1320106924445192198 2020-10-25 04:56:31 +0800 <Jennife20311813> It looks like the  grand opening of a used car lot. Omg, did he just say, Welcome to Dallas?!
1320106296616550406 2020-10-25 04:54:02 +0800 <Jennife20311813> CSPAN is showing a Biden rally right now. There's hardly anyone there, they're trying not to show the lack of a crowd, lol.
1320105663582920715 2020-10-25 04:51:31 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @OmahaSpeak There better be!
1320105136379908099 2020-10-25 04:49:25 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @houstonusa6 I voted in my city clerk's office and left the ballot in their box. I voted straight Republican in the partisan section.
1320103246434881536 2020-10-25 04:41:54 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @catturd2 He would have to hire a couple of eleven year olds to manage it for him. If he wanted to make a profit.

They truly think they are so much smarter and better than everyone else. I have a self identified SJW sibling, she won't hesitate to tell you.
1320098224116584450 2020-10-25 04:21:57 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @TMcClerren I've been a cop since 1989, never felt any concern or an inkling of fear for my chosen profession until the BO years. During that time I used to worry if I would be going home in the same shape as when I reported that day. Lots of dead cops during his years. So glad he's gone.

You picked the guy who refused to condemn rioting, looting murder. You picked the guy who wants to turn this country into a failed socialist state. You are not a good person.
1320094645590917120 2020-10-25 04:07:44 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @janelowther @Dude4Liberty @realDonaldTrump BO started caging the kids. The initial numbers predicted for covid was two million dead. Until then we had the strongest economy this country had ever seen. Seems like he picked the right guy, as did I.

1319979000521949187 2020-10-24 20:28:12 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @jsolomonReports I knew for fact that MI former (D) Gov Jennifer Granholm and Wayne County CEO Robert Ficano (D also) made a lot of trips to China during their tenures. I always wondered why, as did my buddy who coordinated their Executive Protection. Think we can make some guesses now.

1319951281776168960 2020-10-24 18:38:03 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Today feels like a Brunch Cafe day in Livonia. Meat Lovers skillet and lemoncello crepes! Mmmmm. If you're in the area I highly recommend!

Nothing would stop me from voting for him. Our side has been law abiding and polite for the most part, so far. The radical left is taking our well behavior for weakness. We'll see

Schumer's sweating as he, Pelosi, Romney, Kerry, both Bidens and the Clintons should be.

The mother put her two youngest children in an orphanage bc she wanted them to have a better life than her older children. At least in her son's case, it was on the up and up. I can imagine how many don't do it rite.

You must be soooooo proud.
1319469159340793856 2020-10-23 10:42:16 +0800 <Jennife20311813> How come I try to call the number to support Trump and all I get is a busy signal??????
1319465911573712899 2020-10-23 10:29:22 +0800 <Jennife20311813> *low level drug dealers and users. We had way worse violent crime going on but you wanted those busts for forfeiture of vehicles,  homes and land to enrich the Gov. I watched it from the front lines. Sickening. At least I never helped you, which I'm proud to say.
1319464716381683717 2020-10-23 10:24:37 +0800 <Jennife20311813> Joe your mistake devastated the AA community, as long as others for putting away level drug users and dealers. I worked and lived in a major Democrat run city and the results were infuriating and heartbreaking. We had so much real violent crime that was taking place nu busted pot

YOU ordered his release WITH the bullets found in his pocket and didn't allow his gun to be confiscated. YOU and no one else put the murder weapon in his hand. Whatchu got to say?

I also dodged Bernie, Pelosi and Warren last year. I can't be nice to people like them though I would never be outright rude either. I would just as soon avoid them if/when I can.

I made sure she had to make a 1/2 mile walk when she returned from a trip and had no transport to her veh. Told her exec protect guy I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. I like to think of it as an early perp walk.

You go ahead and pay for illegal's health care, education and attorney fees so you can show everyone how virtuous you are. Social justice experimentation is a luxury I can no longer afford.

That's not the behavior of someone with something to fear. Btw the angle didn't look like it came out of his nose at all. Part of my job is reviewing video footage to help determine what happened in the course of an investigation.

Unbelievable stuff that shows who the true threats are. Btw she was Bernie bro too

I love to go to my poll site and vote in person w 90% of my conservative neighbors. I just couldn't chance iy this year but like I said, I do trust our city clerk office (we're a conservative city on the whole).

I was going to lead into that and ask why a Democrat site is posting pics of him w/o anything insulting or sarcastic as I would do. Seems strange to me.

This election is so important to me that I fear anything interrupting it and I could always be ordered to work a double shift (1st responde). Couldn't risk.

Someone jogged my memory here on Twitter and I think the tweet was correct: Pinkerton was taken over by Securitas in the early 2000s. I'm familiar with securitas and it rings true. What was his true purpose for being there.

Seems really strange to me that his pics were there.
1315444604175605760 2020-10-12 08:10:08 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Biden_Army I already voted for you Senator James! The ballot is safely in the city clerk's office ballot box.

She helped vote the dems in. Now she can deal w consequence

It's like CO, where my sister got out priced after her divorce and had to move back here. She also brought her idiotic politics with her which is why we dealt with 2018 giving us a dem Gov, AG and a whole host of lowlifes.

Ppl being locked up for weed ffs. Non violent offenders did not belong in those hellholes. It was heartbreaking. I did all I could not to ruin lives and break up families.
1313599869555224577 2020-10-07 05:59:49 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Stevest39589292 @MericanAutist It is hard being on your own. It's almost like forced socialization the way the system is set up and it sucks. I lucked out but I'm paying a price. I need 30 years for full retirement with medical. I only have 24 1/2 with this department and I've already been OTJ for 30.
1313598231985651712 2020-10-07 05:53:18 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @CLiberally I would bring these two to the door. They hate strangers and are very scary when they're angry.  https://t.co/dzBs4GNqVf

I worked for low wages for about the 1st 15 yrs of my career and had a residency requirement. It was tough, no extras for years. My department split away f original employer now we make a decent wage. I'm stuck in a job I no longer recognize.

Not only goes over the crimes but shows how Oakland Co prosecutors and detectives tried to shove the case under the rug.

I'm telling you though, while I would never want to be on the opposite side of Worthy in a courtroom, she's the kind of person that makes you go, damn I wish she were my neighbor or a relative, just someone who was in your daily life.

1312548374365822977 2020-10-04 08:21:33 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Dustmopp31 Tequila when I was young. Then something strange happened. I went through a period of ten to fifteen years where I couldn't tolerate alcohol at all. It ended when I began to crave a nonfruitymargarita. Now I easily tolerate the stuff and love a good plain margarita not the fruity
1312547117509103616 2020-10-04 08:16:33 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @GeorgePapa19 And keep in mind that they not only feel that way about the President but his supporters as well. Never doubt or forget that.

They get very romantic under running water and I'm sure his dream is to live under a waterfall with a female eckie making love all day. Especially since he can't with mom (me). Eckies are H2O babies.  https://t.co/PUoAwqlgCR

Was raised in a blue collar union Democrat voting household so I know all their arguments and the way they think. I automatically block them anymore bc I already know what they're going to say. My parents walked away during Clinton.

I've had coworkers who thought they had something on me drop blackmail hints yrs ago. I let them know that if I lost my job I would find out who and cut down the thing they loved most in life right in front of them. That sure shut them up.
1312530543775416320 2020-10-04 07:10:41 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @ielizabeth_ I've been feeling the same way lately Irene, you're not alone. I'll keep you in my thoughts.
1312529886544764928 2020-10-04 07:08:05 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @CLiberally @JoeBiden I was the same way until 2016. Mostly voted 3rd party but threw a few Democrats a vote at federal, state and local levels a handful of times. Never after 2016. I don't like being falsely accused of things I've never been just bc I happened to vote for a certain candidate.

I would go nuclear on anyone who messed with my way of living. How can/could someone do that? I don't know much about what you do but I'm guessing you're a freelance. Don't tell me tho if it can be used to hurt you. That's just too much and I'm infuriated for you!

My oldest maternal uncle enlisted around the same time. He was put in for a Siver Star at Tarawa but of course it was knocked down to a Bronze Star. He got another one, not sure where or circumstances and a few other accommodations.

There was a vagrant who kept hanging around businesses panhandling for $. The 1st time I encountered him he said he was a VN veteran. I asked for his military ID card. Showed he was in the CG from mid to late 70s. I asked if he was drafted at age 10.

He never talked about it and if someone tried to ask, he would cut them off by quickly saying by the time he finished his AIT it was pretty much over. Whether he did or didn't fight he wouldn't have talked either way.

I've seen him in person several times the last few years and he doesn't look good when he's not pumped up on enhancing drugs for public appearances. I had a death pool bet of April 2020 but obviously I lost. When he's off he just gets wheeled around in a chair looks dead

I had real VN vets as neighbors, teachers, coworkers, friends. With one exception they were all great people, the salt of the earth and I respected each of them.

If you own a car or have insurance. See if they will accept the report.

If this hadn't happened she most likely would have lost her job over the relationship. I wonder if an inventory of any drug boxes she had access to was ever done. I bet there was.

1312126105751416834 2020-10-03 04:23:36 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @biveselov This strikes a chord in me bc before DT, while I felt lucky to be an American I didn't have the pride and full appreciation that I now have. If I ever got the chance to see him in person that's probably what I would do. Hug him and cry on his shoulder out of appreciation.

1311755524665475074 2020-10-02 03:51:02 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @roncarlson1 I had to throw that out there bc I remember the hype and popularity and watching it now as an adult I was stunned by the success of such a horrible movie. Better ending would have had them all falling off the Brooklyn Bridge. Not 1 redeeming quality in that group of characters.
1311753683928047618 2020-10-02 03:43:44 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @roncarlson1 I'll admit there were some cool, refreshing disco songs though most of the ones I like were not from that movie. I was just commenting on the movie as a whole. Can't believe it rated 3 stars on my cable company guide.
1311752320649244672 2020-10-02 03:38:19 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @RightRedRtn Truth. I just realized what a godawful storyline it had. If you can call that a storyline. There was nothing else on cable when I watched it.
1311751829097771010 2020-10-02 03:36:21 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @roncarlson1 I remember the popularity, the songs, the dancing and unfortunately the clothes. Other than that I now see the reason I didn't remember anything about the movie.
1311751308219736069 2020-10-02 03:34:17 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @SunshineDaisy07 You're not missing much. I saw it in the theater when I was like 12 and at the time I thought John Travolta was nice looking. The fact that I couldn't remember anything about the movie speaks volumes. Every movie I saw&amp;liked at that age I remembered all dialogue&amp;scenes Thiswasdoa
1311749121762566145 2020-10-02 03:25:36 +0800 <Jennife20311813> For the 1st time since it came out I actually watched the movie Saturday Night Fever. What a horrible movie. With the exception of a few minor characters not 1 of the majors was likeable or had any redeeming qualities. Wish they all would have jumped off the bridge at the end.

Last week Livonia began absentee ballots that we could fill out and leave in the clerks office. I registered and voted in the case that a national emergency took place the night of the election. I would be pulled for such an emerg.

Sjws know it all. My sibling knows more about government/public service even though I've been a local level cop who has worked with feds everyday since 99. She knows more about our state politics even though she lived out of state for 25 years. It goes on&amp;on.

I feel pretty safe so it's give and take.

1309249785493323777 2020-09-25 05:54:08 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @thewriterme They are the party of gloom and doom. Libs are never happy or even content, they're incapable of it.

No obscenities were used and I don't believe what I wrote was inappropriate. It was blunt and harsh but not inappropriate.

I've been in my job for 30 years already and still can't get a retirement. I'm so ready to go now I can taste it. He's been in government service since 1974! WTF? Must be nice.

For every person who was undecided about this election until they were terrorized they most likely create a Trump voter. They just keep making more and more people hate them which is a win win for us.

I sent her the YT video of the HRC Liar, Liar song&amp;told her that's how she is seen. SJW said that should be banned&amp;not allowed. Truly frightening to me.

I'll be voting for him again and I noticed he got the endorsement from my union, who normally endorses Democrats. No circus here.

Giving lip service to something he knows absolutely nothing about. Makes as much sense as me popping off about the UK, which I don't do.

You must not have been paying attention to the polls in 2016. In fact I doubt that you are even old enough or eligible to vote.  You're a typical kid who thinks nothing existed until you came along.
1302692604467912707 2020-09-07 03:38:14 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @CorporalBen Thank you! I was more voting against Republicans at the time bc I hated GWB w a passion. Normally I would vote independent and did again the 2nd time BO ran. I realized in 2016 I could no longer sit on the fence and was voting Republican regardless. I've been very happy since.

Her middle son is gay and she's steering her youngest into a radical Marxist group that is against LGBT. She still doesn't get it even though she'll tell you how brilliant she is.

I'm talking about dealing with arrests where the arrestee is being an absolute azzhat. I get away w it mostly bc I put up w a lot b4 saying anything. But the key is making command laugh.

She thinks this whole thing is going to cost Trump the election and thinks everyone agrees with her. She's a white bond girl w a son adopted f Nigeria

He's proud to be an American and loves capitalism.  Can't wait to go out and make his own way in life.

Or does she let you cry it out with your little red face all scrunched up, tears leaking out of your eyes, snot running out your nose &amp; drool out of mouth?
1301866905356120064 2020-09-04 20:57:12 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @trumper_tantrum Perhaps I do. Why then would ppl bother following me if I do? Why not just keep scrolling past. Cant always be witty and entertaining and original with every tweet like you are . I'll be watching how much better yours are

I finally found a civilian who everyone called that. Little was I to know that she tried to include me into some scheme ripping off found $ and property. I never had  any contact w her&amp;they knew it.
1301683963933659136 2020-09-04 08:50:15 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @coco2love_ I have a narcissistic SJW sibling who knows it all, you can't tell her anything she doesn't know more about than you, even in subjects she has no knowledge or experience in. She even wants to control conversations and if you talk about other subjects she calls you stupid.
1301683016993996800 2020-09-04 08:46:30 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @FragoliAlex You'll have to forgive me if once in awhile I have to refer to a really bad woman as one if those words you don't like. Sometimes a woman who is so reprehensible there is no other word accurate enough to describe her. But it's rare.

I never told anyone out of shame and embarrassment. I know how I would have felt if the same thing happened and the Detroit teams wore his name on helmets, jerseys, whatever.

She wants the good life brought to her or have others do the work for her, it's that plain and simple. She doesn't want to get her own hands dirty. I've already read her garbage manifesto and blocked her.

The majority of them have shown great dignity and restraint from frog marching these wannabes to the borders.

Why do they need self righteous, self loathing whites to lead them around by the nose? (I have an obnoxious blond sister who thinks she's 1 of them, I keep waiting 4 her 2 get her ass beat). In Detroit they have their act more together and don't want outside agitators.

However I was telling a coworker about her and my cw seems to think the adoptions are more about virtue signaling than anything else. Given the last 2 years I'm agreeing w that

That can always be addressed at another time, in another way.
1300907931559505920 2020-09-02 05:26:35 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Feedr1 @BannedDeplorab1 😆 you kind of have the right idea. If an arrestee is calm and cooperative our court liaison officer and eventually the judge will see that and if there is anything favorable they can do for the person they will. Even a written report can do the same. Key words 2show demeanor.
1300906792805961729 2020-09-02 05:22:03 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Tomaspain2 Well the good part is I see that person as she really is, a narcissist and a bully who I want absolutely nothing to do with after our parents pass. The bad part is she has 2 really great sons whom I love very much. I'm leaving it up to them if they want to have contact w me.

A loser with a capital L!!!! May as well be tattooed on his forehead.

That covers a lot of ground in incorporating acts that can be interpreted as criminal, much like the Patriot Act.

1300763192893878272 2020-09-01 19:51:26 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @PISDI94_96 I'm only a broken down middle age cop with 30 years experience. I've had nowhere near the training and experience of military, esp Marines. But what skills and ability I have would be yours in the fight. Hell, even if I free up an AB to guard weapons and supplies. I can shoot!
1300761167342841857 2020-09-01 19:43:23 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @JackPosobiec I want to go undercover to one of his rallies and start chanting, Poor Old Joe, Poor Old Joe. What do you want to bet the lemmings would just go along with it. 😆😆😆😆😆
1300753819450642432 2020-09-01 19:14:12 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @NikRose69 @HaleyTessIsis That being said, I'd love to see real Detroiters kick their asses out to the edge of their borders-we'll take them from there. So far their residents have shown great dignity and restraint.
1300752832774238210 2020-09-01 19:10:16 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @drraystep @NikRose69 @HaleyTessIsis Exactly.
1300751734634151938 2020-09-01 19:05:54 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @NikRose69 @HaleyTessIsis I can tell you one thing about these Dbags and Detroit. They're scared of real Detroiters who don't want them there. Detroit works very closely with DPD chief and mayor.They have enough problems w/o outside agitators coming in causing more problems. They know they're not welcome
1300750675584974850 2020-09-01 19:01:42 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @Max_AR15 @cockyrascal The mayor is just afraid of how bad Trump is going to make him look.
1300749951576801283 2020-09-01 18:58:49 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @chiIIum The feds need to get cracking on this.
1300749689613148161 2020-09-01 18:57:47 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @chiIIum @JORGEMA77376542 Sounds like asset forfeiture under the RICCO act could be doable.

1300627489715302400 2020-09-01 10:52:12 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @marklevinshow @jakemore949 I don't need a lecture from the likes of any professional athlete. Even from one who has never been accused or convicted of a crime. Their track record says enough, no matter what sport or league. Save your speech for someone who is impressed with you cause I'm certainly not.
1300622915029929984 2020-09-01 10:34:02 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @icedontherocks @Gary35218119 @AOC That would be my guess. It's a common hiding spot for mules.

1300617700201332742 2020-09-01 10:13:18 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @ShawnG927 @HollyWilhelm4 I would have refused to take it, cameras rolling and all. Bet I wouldn't have gotten in any official trouble seeing as how 99% of my department, including command, feel about him. Perhaps the firemen would have since they project the boy scout image. I'd have executed about face.
1300614795796848642 2020-09-01 10:01:46 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @DPaulMatthew @RealOmarNavarro Damn!!!! Thanks for the info anyway. I'd rather hear the bad news if its true.

1300613743034892288 2020-09-01 09:57:35 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @jakemore949 @floydddunagan @kimmiintx The home addresses of the arrestees. PD has been announcing the numbers and the real residents are getting fed up w outside agitators causing problems. This tactic has proven successful in Detroit who has never seen as much of problem of the rest of those cities.
1300612671671332865 2020-09-01 09:53:19 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @floydddunagan @MichaelPaulhei2 Pantifa and blm have been treading lightly in Detroit bc of this. They know the majority of real Detroiters are pissed off by outside agitators and they work closely with the DPD chief&amp;mayor who won't be putting up w their nonsense. Detroit has enough problems of its own w/o AH.

Even though I was an independent voter most of my life I did occasionally throw Democrats a vote. Voted for MI Gov Granholm the 1st time, Gore the only time and BO the 1st time. Regretted each vote. I fully walked away in 2016 and will NEVER vote Democrat again.
1300605864924110849 2020-09-01 09:26:16 +0800 <Jennife20311813> @OkieNV @JoeBiden Par for course.

Even then I just tune in briefly to catch the score. I did do that for the Cubs in 2017 bc I root for underdogs. I guess I won't even be doing that anymore for anyone no matter who.

Same trying to put them on an assembly line at an auto plant, where my father, all my uncles on both sides and a cousin did. Not ever a week could they hack.
