These pardons will display that the USA does not practice what we preach to others. Not good for our standing in the world or what's left of it after trump.  Absolutely shameful.

You dont give 2 shits about the American people. The pork that is in this bill is part of the budget YOU submitted to Congress.  You are the worst plague ever on our country.

I wonder if any of his coworkers would have come forward if this tape did not exist. Any wonder why ppl don't trust the cops. They dont serve and protect the community that pays their wages.

Thank you for sharing your story and I know Dad is proud of you for sharing your pain with us. I pray your family finds peace and can soon smile when you remember him.❤
1331992491646586880 2020-11-27 00:05:31 +0800 <Lakelady1863> What a great message from our President and first lady. January 20 2021 cannot get here soon enough.
1331988954355097600 2020-11-26 23:51:28 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @RepRoKhanna I could keep utilities paid, food on the table and not lose my car that is almost paid off. @RepRoKhanna Please help us, we pay our taxes to keep the country financed, and the lawmakers need to do the same for us that are struggling.  WE THE PEOPLE NEED HELP NOW!!

Let's hope that ALL this trump BS will not cost much more in lives and security but I fear it will. Don't ask the American people for a reference on your next job hunt.

1330904302714449920 2020-11-24 00:01:27 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @BeKindOkk @UncleSaltyJr1 I use the pan for the entire cooking process.  Pat your dough on the bottom and sides, I precook the crust about 5 mins,helps to stay crisp and not soggy, put all precooked meat and other ingredients and top with as much cheese as you want. I fill my pan to the top with cheese.
1330899204588257287 2020-11-23 23:41:11 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Georgia voters remember this. Vote blue to save our country.

1330560565802987522 2020-11-23 01:15:34 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @UncleSaltyJr1 @BeKindOkk I only use my cast iron pan when I make homemade pizza. I love the way it cooks evenly and all toppings stay on the pizza. I still use my great grammas pan, it is over 100 years old.
1330559864334995456 2020-11-23 01:12:46 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @UncleSaltyJr1 My hubby loves leftover pizza for breakfast, he calls it Italian sauce on toast. He eats it cold also..he claims to like it cold but I say its bc he is too lazy to warm it up.

Maybe the Senate will do something for us little people now that they are learning the virus is REAL. Hoping @SenRickScott will work to get the Cares act signed so we can get this virus and economic pain addressed.

1329587631357714433 2020-11-20 08:49:28 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Doesn't Congress have something to say about this?  God I hope the NEW DOJ looks into all these people and their dirty deeds. Mnuchin does not have to do this, he is out of a job in 62 days and does not have to deal with dumb Donald after he is gone. This is just being evil.

I bet she votes republican if not then she would not be bashing a woman that is trying to save lives of ppl in her state. Bitch at the repubs in the Senate, they are holding up the aid pkg we all need.

Wear a damn mask and stay home just a bit longer, do it for the people you love and that love you. It is not forever just for a while longer.

1329461894453751808 2020-11-20 00:29:50 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @Zudleymarie If you can, grab a premade meal from your local grocery store. They are pretty good and if you are not comfortable doing the dinner, this will be good food for the family and no additional stress on you. It will allow more family time. Happy thanksgiving.

1329437877919490051 2020-11-19 22:54:24 +0800 <Lakelady1863> I agree, holding public office should not be a means of money making.
1329430155618516998 2020-11-19 22:23:43 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Please Georgia we need you one more time. Vote for progress.
1329157991371661312 2020-11-19 04:22:14 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Pull her pension and any other perks she gets from the taxpayers.  This monster works for us, the people, and she is not doing the job. Dont ever allow her to work for our taxpayers dollars again.
1329154987532795904 2020-11-19 04:10:18 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @realDonaldTrump OMG you have lost your grip on reality. You seriously need to get help you are spinning out of control. If you had anyone that actually loved you they would be concerned.

1329093184480190466 2020-11-19 00:04:43 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Well done Mehdi.
1329091515105177601 2020-11-18 23:58:05 +0800 <Lakelady1863> The GOP does not want the actual taxpayers to get relief during this pandemic but they have no problem with giving a few trillion in tax relief to the wealthiest with OUR tax dollars. This is wrong on so many levels. Congress get us some relief NOW, we cannot go on like this.
1329082331366268928 2020-11-18 23:21:35 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @TheDailyShow @jordanklepper So much ignorance gathered together. I feel like I am on earth 2.

1328714642496004098 2020-11-17 23:00:31 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Yes. Lindsey Graham needs to be investigated immediately. Something is not right in SC vote totals, look at Moscow Mitch race also, this guy has 17% approval but gets 89% of the vote in Kentucky.

1328384794254663681 2020-11-17 01:09:49 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Read the article,  makes alot of sense. I know how bad the fatigue is and nobody wants a closure but how else can this be reined in to make it manageable until the vaccine is ready. I have been out of work since March and no fin.assist.since 1st cares act. We are hurting.

It's about time the evangelicals tell the truth about this deranged madman who is in charge of our country until 1/20/2022. Never thought I would hear any of them talk sense about trump.

1328036843703603200 2020-11-16 02:07:11 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Agreed
1328019385949143041 2020-11-16 00:57:49 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Biden won in a landslide,  trump says 306 EV is a landslide victory. Not to mention the 5 million more votes for President Biden.
1327356327161593856 2020-11-14 05:03:04 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @realDonaldTrump You've been hiding in the basement since President Biden beat you massively, he now has 306 EV the same you had when you &amp; putin installed you.  You claim you love this country if true you will accept &amp; ackn defeat &amp; help heal our nation.

Republicans legislation in those states requires that ballots can't be counted until the day of election, Florida has been early counting for years, this allows them to give actual factual ballot counts. You LOST, give it up. CONCEDE NOW!!

1323296799365345280 2020-11-03 00:11:57 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @FBI @SecretService What the hell is being done about this? Maybe a couple of arrests will stop this domestic terrorist group from trying to inflict fear and harm to others. This is 3rd world bullshit being allowed to happen out in the open. Do your JOBS for christ sake.
1323293897909436416 2020-11-03 00:00:25 +0800 <Lakelady1863> @hey_itsbreanna @dellcam Let's hope they respond to you if your life is threatened. Defunding the Police is skewed by the right, it is about moving funds from violent police response &amp; getting social services to the folks that need help and not more abuse from the ppl that are supposed to protect them.
1323289578346737665 2020-11-02 23:43:15 +0800 <Lakelady1863> Honore' is a good and decent man. He has always been a great example of a public servant.  If he makes a statement like this people really need to listen, this is a no bullshit kinda guy.
