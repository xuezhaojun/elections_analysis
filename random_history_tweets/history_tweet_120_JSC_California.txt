1344059127002144768 2020-12-30 07:14:01 +0800 <JSC_California> @LauraWhitt32 Jeez what a self absorbed dreg.  That said, abortion, by design is both racism and murder. Democrats lost their edge over minorities during the civil rights movement in the 60‚Äôs thus they championed a new way to control minorities as out right saying it wasn‚Äôt popular anymore.

1343968605520625666 2020-12-30 01:14:19 +0800 <JSC_California> I agree as well but since your giving us our own money back let‚Äôs make it tax free.
1343965381950521344 2020-12-30 01:01:31 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Verse 3, worship of Baal is alive and well today.  What did God do to them that worshipped Baal? He destroyed them. Wheat separates from chaff and chaff gets the flame.
1343964595132624898 2020-12-30 00:58:23 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Verse 2, does the word, ‚Äúword‚Äù represent a duality between the commandments and Christ?

1343957072937844737 2020-12-30 00:28:30 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski This brings me to my last question.  Does this mean their will be different levels of heaven based off of our repentance in this life?  If so, can you point me to scripture.
1343956341019164674 2020-12-30 00:25:35 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Im thinking within the context of repentance.  For me it is a daily battle.  I fear for those that don‚Äôt even recognize what we are talking about but believe they are saved.
1343956080255139842 2020-12-30 00:24:33 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Exactly.  That leads me to this...the commandments are broken everyday ‚Äúunwittingly‚Äù thru the systemic man made/luciferian systems in place.  Does acceptance of Yeshuas sacrifice/blood atonement save one even though they break the commandments? Provided they believe on Yeshua.
1343952177144852480 2020-12-30 00:09:03 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski It changed another word to what when I wasn‚Äôt looking lol what what
1343951981220524034 2020-12-30 00:08:16 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Showed grace by sparing them when he should have killed them.  Instead he took an animal in their place there by demonstrating the sacrifice required to save one from death.  This was a prelude/metaphor to Yeshuas sacrifice that would ultimately save mankind.
1343950855704170496 2020-12-30 00:03:48 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Man I wish Twitter had a edit option.
1343949951051640837 2020-12-30 00:00:12 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Might you elaborate on this pls.  I don‚Äôt think enough people understand this. It goes back to original sin.  Adam &amp; Eve created original sin, mans inherent flaw. The wages of sin are death. God demonstrated both grace by sparing them but also showed them what what separation...

1343232586143789056 2020-12-28 00:29:39 +0800 <JSC_California> @JacqBens Agreed, but I think we are past that point of setting ethical ground rules, you already know my thoughts on abortion.  As far as alpha beta epsilon, just seeing if your paying attention. God help me if you say you shop at alphabeta!
1343228657561550848 2020-12-28 00:14:02 +0800 <JSC_California> @ElSaysItAll @tuiteoacolor @BreitbartNews There are plenty of places in the Bible where children have suffered/died for the sins of their parents.

If you treat it as euphemism I can see where an individual would come to this conclusion.  However, this chapter is about accusation and swearing your innocence before God.  If you lie before God the penalty was immediate as described in the chapter.
1343220724329111552 2020-12-27 23:42:31 +0800 <JSC_California> @JacqBens I‚Äôm way out there on my thinking.  Feels very huxleyian to me but could this biotechnology be used to ultimately control the masses?  If we move towards a communist dystopia it would be only natural to establish an alpha (elites, big tech) Beta (politicians, old $) epsilon (us)

1342124206121648128 2020-12-24 23:05:20 +0800 <JSC_California> @SPatriot84 @weronski Bell do you think the OT still applies today?
1342123640486154241 2020-12-24 23:03:06 +0800 <JSC_California> @SPatriot84 @weronski Your response to watchmen is the beam in your eye Bell and my response to you is my beam. We could do this all day but I think the beam in ours eyes will cause us to miss his message.  If anyone had an ear let them hear.

1337170348169543683 2020-12-11 07:00:29 +0800 <JSC_California> I would love to say Bravo, and as much as I would love to see porhub go down,  this doesn‚Äôt sit right.  If it‚Äôs within the law and legal, do you want to allow your creditors to dictate what you can spend your money on?

If we want to protect our children then we have to go after the giants, for instance twitter and others, that make porn easily accessible to children.  All of this is in regards to the fight on child porn and human trafficking...

1334589406083043328 2020-12-04 04:04:44 +0800 <JSC_California> What this dreg fails to tell you is that your new landlord will be the US Government.  Imagine how crazy it will be when they evict you from your home and give it to someone else at their discretion.  The same home you‚Äôve been paying a mortgage on diligently.
1334527632113713152 2020-12-03 23:59:16 +0800 <JSC_California> @BrunTheBear @nicothe13th @AndreaAndCo1 @rooshv Brun I think that these views are as valid as anything else that is on twitter.  Everyone has something they ‚Äúlive‚Äù for and are passionate about.  I equate it to your passion for bears and animals alike which I find very altruistic of you sir.

1334522173986258947 2020-12-03 23:37:35 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Question, do you think the vaccine is the mark?  I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it is per the Bible as those that do not take the mark will not be able to buy or sell etc. and they have already said as many CJ in the media. Does the mark represent a surrender to the material world?

I‚Äôm fine with guns, just not so much with bad parenting.  My thought is maybe mom should be the one we are talking about...

1325997956038680576 2020-11-10 11:05:23 +0800 <JSC_California> @seanhannity Cuomo is a narcissistic sociopath whos intellect barely exceeds that of a pile of dog shit.  That being said, in defense of piles of shit everywhere, even piles of shit knew it was a bad idea to put covid infected people in retirement homes.  Cuomo is a domestic terrorist.

1325674612693200897 2020-11-09 13:40:32 +0800 <JSC_California> Just curious, most state and federal workers have to do a live scan service no?  If so, their prints are digitally on file in big brothers data base.  Wouldn‚Äôt take much to lift prints off of ballots and run them thru the nationwide database to figure out who the traitors are.

1319441715573342208 2020-10-23 08:53:13 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Because he‚Äôs giving gentiles one last chance to turn to him and choose life over death.  It will take a tribulation to bring some to belief.

1319121185045540866 2020-10-22 11:39:33 +0800 <JSC_California> @ReganDessert @LauraWhitt32 Maybe she‚Äôs irritated that shills like yourself have no concept of feeling and pass off the murder of babies as a casual afterthought with what they think are witty Tweets.  Shes probably wondering, like me, how you got so fucked up to think that killing a baby is a basic right?

1319083411307327488 2020-10-22 09:09:27 +0800 <JSC_California> @JackPosobiec @Rabbittgirl @nypost Really makes the platform bigoted.  Maybe at one time it was genuine, but now it‚Äôs just a leftist tool of hate.  If I owned stock in twitter I‚Äôd dump it on principle alone.
1318984437967695872 2020-10-22 02:36:10 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski Because they don‚Äôt want to admit they are lukewarm.  They only know the physicality of the world and are lacking spiritually.
1318949510261862403 2020-10-22 00:17:22 +0800 <JSC_California> @weronski I‚Äôll tag you towards the end of the week.  Busy work week for me...

You are also very divisive and loose lipped. Read up. Your soul depends on it.   Matt 12:36, Mark 7:21-23, Ephesians 4:31, Proverbs 6:16-19, 1st John 4:1

You will have insomnia for those two weeks though and it will screw with your head.  Short tempered etc.  don‚Äôt try it until your the person your suppose to become.  Otherwise it will shape you.

Quit blaming others for your shitty decisions and act like a politician with a spine. Own your shit and evolve or pack it all in a suitcase and get the fuck out.  Americans are tired of liars.

1317545045302468609 2020-10-18 03:16:32 +0800 <JSC_California> You should be grateful.  You did nothing in your tenure to prepare or prevent this.  In fact, it almost appears as if you want to destroy this great state.  What gives?  My taxes are too high and I work 2 jobs to be able to afford to live here.  What did you spend my taxes on?

When did we convince ourselves it was okay to kill our children?  When did we decide that murder was more acceptable over life?  When did God decide he‚Äôs okay with this?  It‚Äôs very clearly harvest time.

Take for instance jack Johnson versus say Metallica.  Totally diff vibes.  I wonder what kind of vibe he gets from the death metal he listens to.

You can choose Christ or you can choose satan.  The devil is prideful and indignant.  He thinks he is working for himself but rather unbeknownst to him, he is fulfilling Gods plan as laid out in the Holy Bible
1314029831068086272 2020-10-08 10:28:19 +0800 <JSC_California> @BrunTheBear @MsKatieChap I see your point. Here is another perspective I strongly believe in.  God created all things and he knows the future the past and the present.  Then  why doesn‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt God get rid of Satan, Hitler, rapists, murderers, animal abusers etc.?  Because of free will.  1/2

1313853856447512588 2020-10-07 22:49:04 +0800 <JSC_California> @BrunTheBear Murder. Let‚Äôs be clear, when I say that it‚Äôs murder I am talking directly about the people who use it as a form of birth control.  There are rare occasions where it might need to be done in cases of rape, incest and life threatening pregnancy etc. that‚Äôs between God and them.
1313851644778438658 2020-10-07 22:40:16 +0800 <JSC_California> @BrunTheBear Sad.  Bears should be free and wild.  No hunting.  We‚Äôve done enough!

If you are pro choice i.e. Biden vote then you got explaining to do to the man upstairs.  A    Vote for Trump is a step in the right direction.  So are we all ok with the baby blender machine that the democrats created?
1313663908645797889 2020-10-07 10:14:17 +0800 <JSC_California> @MsKatieChap I will say again all is going according to Gods plan.

Are you just now realizing that everything worldly is an extension of the devils influence?  It‚Äôs been like this since the fall of Adam and will continue so until the return of Christ.

1312411584124215302 2020-10-03 23:17:59 +0800 <JSC_California> The party that champions and cheers for the right to murder the unborn wants your vote to further their bloodlust.  Christians answer to a higher authority.  Try again.

1312223568248201216 2020-10-03 10:50:53 +0800 <JSC_California> Hammer is a moron and doesn‚Äôt even really understand the depth of Trumps comment.  McCain was a POW who was lucky enough to be released.  McCain then spent his political career covering up the fact that we left 500+ POWs in Vietnam.  Want to know more?   https://t.co/MYyOimBSC4
1312212864573140993 2020-10-03 10:08:21 +0800 <JSC_California> @PensivePoet97 It‚Äôs a shame that people don‚Äôt know the covenant that God made with Noah and the sign of the rainbow after the waters receded.  It was a promise and a reminder that God would never destroy the earth again by deluge/flood.

1311143418937004032 2020-09-30 11:18:45 +0800 <JSC_California> @BretBaier Well if you accepted Biden‚Äôs obvious bold face lies I‚Äôd say it was even.  Wallace was an embarrassment.  What happened to neutrality?  Very unprofessional performance by him.  He might as well have sucked the kool-aid  right from...  anyhow I digress.
1311142503060353027 2020-09-30 11:15:07 +0800 <JSC_California> Hunter got 3.5 million from Russia.  It is what it is because they are the family they are.  A life of selling out the American people and pitting us against one another while they make sure they reap treasures well beyond your measly $15/hr job. What‚Äôs wrong with this picture?

It takes a higher moral compass and backbone to engage on this level.  Keep doing what you do, makes it easier to spot your type and call you out.  https://t.co/SKx3PWoNC7

There are some studies out there that show that cancer, bacteria and viruses thrive in an acidic environment.  The above will adjust Your PH reducing acidity and allow the baking soda to oxidize free radicals. Google it
1308959542705664000 2020-09-24 10:40:48 +0800 <JSC_California> @billy2kid45 So awesome!
1308956409329938432 2020-09-24 10:28:21 +0800 <JSC_California> @des_mel_trc Agreed but ultimately I think it brings believers onto shaky ground per verse: Ephesians 4:29-32 KJV.  Mind you I am as guilty as the next guy I get pulled in as well.  With that said, my thoughts are....all is going according to plan.  God is in control my friend.

1302811755978977280 2020-09-07 11:31:42 +0800 <JSC_California> @Nick_Clamorgan More racist thugs.  Notice how these cowards always move in packs and only attack people that are alone.  This is plenty enough of a reason to carry a gun CCW or no CCW.  We are pretty far from law and order these days.

1302619798593961984 2020-09-06 22:48:56 +0800 <JSC_California> @ffredomfighter7 @MajorPatriot Correct. Disease, viruses thrive in an acidic environment.  Continual sugar intake increases the body‚Äôs acidity allowing the above to prosper.  Sugar is in everything....even the cow milk you drink.

FB‚Äôs goal here is to taint the jury pool so that no effective trial will take place and to incite vigilante justice by mob rule.

1301594830074646528 2020-09-04 02:56:04 +0800 <JSC_California> Your an anarchist and a disgrace.  You set your city ablaze to cause political chaos during a pandemic.  I imagine after homeowners look at the equity they‚Äôve lost on their homes they will come looking for answers.  Sucks to be you.

1300967177852346369 2020-09-02 09:22:00 +0800 <JSC_California> Allowing California judges and courts to cherry pic at their discretion who registers as a sex offender is only going to widen the gap of rule of law.  We will end up in another cycle of ‚Äúone set of laws for the elite/rich and another for Americans‚Äù.
1300965264071172097 2020-09-02 09:14:24 +0800 <JSC_California> @PensivePoet97 Ungh seriously.  Born and raised but it getting out of control.

1300642121121062912 2020-09-01 11:50:21 +0800 <JSC_California> @Sheltieman3 I was just commenting on this principle in another tweet.  You can hide your heart from man but God truly knows.
1300632330571141120 2020-09-01 11:11:26 +0800 <JSC_California> @TodayWithJulius @Cox30Cox Man some people really suck.  Hope they caught this dipshit.  So cowardly.

1300626874289147907 2020-09-01 10:49:45 +0800 <JSC_California> @Trumpgays1 Gods covenant is pretty clear.  We all have freedom of choice to choose the path we walk. With that said,  the heart wants what the heart wants and only God can see the true nature of your heart.  Gay cure clinic? Sounds like another name for re-education camp. Sketch.....E
