1343551762477838336 2020-12-28 21:37:56 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @ThePollitt The amount of wear described  on the mot certificates and photos looks very much like a 150,000 car - serious bit of pre MOT mileage adjustment?  New engine &amp; dials?
1343545814505975808 2020-12-28 21:14:18 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @lemurian39 If I thought that I would emigrate somewhere else, probably in Europe.

1343491080055123970 2020-12-28 17:36:48 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @theSNP - I can trace my Scottish lineage back 7 generations &amp; have the honour of being able to wear a clan tartan if I choose.  I was born in London as my grandfather was an economic migrant.... do I get to vote on independence?

1343176496798707712 2020-12-27 20:46:46 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @SThumbless So Scotland could leave the UK under WTO terms with a £18bn budget deficit, no currency, no central bank, bloated public sector......  absolutely no way Germany &amp; France would allow you to join Euro so trading with EU under WTO terms as well....

1343100212022304769 2020-12-27 15:43:38 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @LD_LukeGraham So freedom of speech, healthy debate or opinion not allowed in your Orwellian version of our world?
1342947810577178627 2020-12-27 05:38:03 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @Marina_Sirtis This is the divisive nonsense that needs to end - democratic decision has been made and now #brexiteer and #remainer needs to work together to repair this country for future generations.    Why blame and cause deeper divisions and more resentment?  Not going to help anybody.
1342892163328258052 2020-12-27 01:56:56 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @nige_h64 @Wivensta @AlinFarah13 @afneil Totally agree - just tired of the negativity and tribalism.  We all need to work together to make the next 12 months work.  Healthy debate and positive challenge is great and healthy in a democracy.
1342884557645893633 2020-12-27 01:26:42 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @NicolaSturgeon An independent Scotland cannot join the EU or euro as there would be no control of fiscal or monetary policy unless a new currency created.  If so Scotland’s debt profile would make it ineligible for membership........it is just gaslighting and a power grab

Read my original tweet - I am British first and foremost but loved being a European.  I have never stated support for either seemingly binary choice.

He has made his million quid and will be a dual national by the end@of next year with a German passport. He is banging on about roads and dinghys to setup a new party to fleece more punters.
1342786007696101378 2020-12-26 18:55:06 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @nige_h64 @Wivensta @AlinFarah13 @afneil Never said to stop follow your beliefs but let’s not keep knocking chunks out of each other and stop this vitriolic tribalism.  With the current shambolic govt the next election is the next opportunity to exercise democracy.
1342784476892561411 2020-12-26 18:49:01 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @AlinFarah13 @nige_h64 @afneil It’s not a “brexiteer” argument anymore - we have left through democratic means.  It’s a pragmatic argument - I am not a brexiteer or a remainer but want to build the UK up again post Brexit and Covid for our children’s generation.
1342783961093828609 2020-12-26 18:46:58 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @melaniemackuk @afneil Nonsense you can still emigrate to any EU country. Apply@like any other non EU citizen.  Just because freedom of movement doesn’t make it easy does not mean it is not possible.
1342762243398766594 2020-12-26 17:20:40 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @afneil This #brexiteer #remainer nonsense needs to stop - we are where we are and we need to crack on and make the country prosper.  If so called #remainers don’t like it then the EU will welcome them with open arms. Let support our country now even if we disagreed with the outcome.

1341452673577590788 2020-12-23 02:36:55 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @guyverhofstadt This political act is playing into brexiteer hands &amp; affirming a lot of British ppls view of the EU.  It is impacting farmers, suppliers &amp; other industries across the UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal and other EU countries when COVID is already damaging livelihoods.

Monetary policy is controlled by a central bank and there would not be one.
1320391244598706177 2020-10-25 23:46:19 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @scotfax @dscott_aberdeen @afneil @NicolaSturgeon Scotland would by using sterling have zero say in interest rates &amp; would BofE allow Scotland to use them as lender of last resort? New scottish currency &amp; cent bank would need to be setup until ECB after EU membership &amp; Scot pound need to be pegged against £ and € ?  Hard work!
1320390354462453760 2020-10-25 23:42:46 +0800 <MarkRStevenson> @scotfax @dscott_aberdeen @afneil @NicolaSturgeon Doubt that he does - so if Scotland was independent &amp; wanted to rejoin the euro it would need its own currency pegged to sterling as keeping sterling would be a “monetary union “ with an extra EU country (UK after Brexit) and that is not allowed under EU rules.
