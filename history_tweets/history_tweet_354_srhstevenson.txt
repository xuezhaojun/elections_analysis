If you‚Äôre a visual artist, design studio or music artist, and you sell an NFT, you now not only can make a lump sum at auction but you make a percentage with every sale on the secondary market in perpetuity

1331097997665419264 2020-11-24 12:51:07 +0800 <srhstevenson> @BEASTMODE @waitbutwhy Completely agree
1331053117727674368 2020-11-24 09:52:47 +0800 <srhstevenson> What we are talking about is going to take a system such as Blockchain where assets used are tied to their original source no matter how far back they go. At the end of the day though, all thoughts/ideas/insights are amalgamations of what we have heard and seen before.
1331052734431203328 2020-11-24 09:51:16 +0800 <srhstevenson> I hear everyone's perspective but even right now, with Clubhouse, aren't just the owners of the app making money while we are all on it jabbering? Just like every other social media app?
1331052419107540992 2020-11-24 09:50:01 +0800 <srhstevenson> @waitbutwhy Fascinating conversation on Clubhouse. How do we compensate for all the messages we pick up in the wind? Where are lines with this drawn? All of our interactions coalesce into insight and they form from brain synapses firing at different times from different convos.
