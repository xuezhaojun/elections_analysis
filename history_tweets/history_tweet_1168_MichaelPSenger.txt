Only hope for justice against the Politburo is if the world disengages economically, China‚Äôs economy may implode and Xi‚Äôs own people may rip him apart.  (But even then, Xi has a massive surveillance apparatus, and Stalin and Mao survived plenty of famines).
1342917428909522944 2020-12-27 03:37:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MarkChangizi I mean, that question is the whole point.

1340724472106500096 2020-12-21 02:23:18 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> It‚Äôs increasingly clear that the end goal of CCP‚Äôs lockdown fraud is to acclimate the public to the idea that, yes, COVID is the common cold/flu, but these mandates were good. Thus, a permanent new normal of masks, lockdowns, mandatory vaccines, and no human rights is justified.
1340714714188300289 2020-12-21 01:44:31 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @uselesserestyay I wish I knew.  I think the failure of the intelligence community is a big factor‚Äîthe vast majority figure that if there was anything untoward about lockdowns, the intel community would stop them.  A couple arrests of strongly pro-lockdown propagandists would go a long way.

1339082255336153089 2020-12-16 13:37:43 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> The "we can't blame China" folks always make the same error‚Ä¶ they misunderstand totalitarianism.  If you think no government is worse than any other, then any government could be responsible for the lockdown fraud.  Xi's concentration camps and violent purges say otherwise.

1337906712368574464 2020-12-13 07:46:31 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @KCchemguy Whatever it was, it seems it was already spreading substantially in the US in December.  So the major changes in March were 1. locking everyone down, 2. putting everyone on ventilators, 3. returning sick folks to nursing homes.  https://t.co/JsNwNGatH8

I'm not sure if Twitter thinks it might confuse people, or if they don't like that it proves the WHO to be corrupt, or if they're pretending the former but actually it's the latter‚Ä¶
1337873956477472775 2020-12-13 05:36:22 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @KCchemguy Replied too fast :)  Second tweet was meant to answer this part:  https://t.co/JP8UENcLxC  It was all lockdown and mass-ventilator deaths, which is why the I believe the CCP/WHO's ventilator guidance was such a crucial part of the lockdown psyop.
1337872316626313216 2020-12-13 05:29:51 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Further, the health establishment's pretended to have a much better grasp of these illnesses' cause than they do (this has happened before). Thus, many "COVID deaths" in large cities are actually lockdown/ventilator deaths, marked COVID due to bad testing.  https://t.co/QCxHc8hz0j
1337870350458253315 2020-12-13 05:22:02 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> There has been a once-a-decade spike in respiratory deaths in 2020, but the fraud has been a scientific establishment corrupt and vain enough to implement an untested lockdown "containment" policy invented by Xi Jinping, condemning 3% of the world's population to extreme poverty.  https://t.co/FK1rURO4U2

1337530620826677248 2020-12-12 06:52:04 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Farinances Exactly.  Pathetic really.
1337528688724897795 2020-12-12 06:44:24 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> This is currently my top theory as to why intelligence agencies haven't intervened on lockdowns.  Intel officials are generally high-paid professionals; given most high-paid professionals have supported lockdowns, it's no surprise intel agencies have no anti-lockdown consensus.

1336925571088084992 2020-12-10 14:47:49 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @TimTravis2 Yep, no question.  I think lockdowns will ultimately go down as one of those unthinkable ‚Äúnever-again‚Äù precedents, like internment camps.

The CCP and its enablers must be held accountable to stop lockdowns, ensure they never happen again, and see that justice is done.  https://t.co/dKhu6AZufx
1336872823177048065 2020-12-10 11:18:13 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 29/ Lockdown supporters may cower from these facts, but that doesn‚Äôt make them any less real.  Journalists pretend to fool each other, dissociating by attributing these travesties to the ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù instead of ‚Äúlockdowns.‚Äù  But God is not fooled.  https://t.co/FO9a615E0j
1336872616045449217 2020-12-10 11:17:24 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 28/ All this for a virus that caused no above-average mortality in countries without lockdowns‚Äîand which WHO estimates already infected 10% of people worldwide by October.

1336872141367758848 2020-12-10 11:15:31 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 22/ But while these statistics in developed nations may be horrifying, they pale in comparison to the suffering of untold millions in the developing world, cast into starvation and poverty as a result of our lockdowns.
1336872049206325248 2020-12-10 11:15:09 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 21/  These are not statistics.  They‚Äôre old friends, loved ones, and intelligent human beings with thoughts, feelings, and dreams, whose lives have been needlessly destroyed by our own governments‚Äô policies.
1336871939009368064 2020-12-10 11:14:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 20/ And, most horrifyingly of all, a study from the United Kingdom found a 1,493% rise in the incidence of abusive head trauma among children over the course of the COVID-19 crisis.  https://t.co/oNGHAijv5j

1336871613472661507 2020-12-10 11:13:25 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 17/ Children‚Äôs health and intellectual development has regressed.  Some who were potty-trained before lockdowns have reverted to diapers, and others have forgotten basic numbers or how to use a knife and fork.  https://t.co/K0V5L024id
1336871506853421056 2020-12-10 11:12:59 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 16/ In recent surveys of over 6000 children and parents in the US, Germany, Finland, Spain and the UK by Save the Children, up to 65% of the children struggled with boredom and feelings of isolation.  https://t.co/aemvlzmPbN
1336871441334231041 2020-12-10 11:12:44 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 15/ And, despite being at virtually no risk from COVID, as a result of lockdowns, children have suffered the most of all.  Nearly one in four children living under lockdowns are dealing with anxiety, with many at risk of lasting psychological distress.  https://t.co/kMNgA7VItE

1336801249056985088 2020-12-10 06:33:48 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @heidiponyrider I've considered that possibility as well.  In 1994, Bill and Melinda randomly spent part of their honeymoon in Xinjiang (now site of the Uyghur genocide).

1334242770710618112 2020-12-03 05:07:20 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @HousesSilver @Grund_gesetzt Yep, it‚Äôs tricky because they all end up carrying the CCP‚Äôs water a bit to be part of the cool crowd at the WEF, even if they don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre doing it.  Absolutely criminally inept.
1334236104871071748 2020-12-03 04:40:50 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @HousesSilver @Grund_gesetzt Oh I forgot Giuseppe Conte he might be CCP too.
1334235879989276672 2020-12-03 04:39:57 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @HousesSilver @Grund_gesetzt Yeah definitely Hajdu, Bar-Yam, and William Haseltine. But I‚Äôll admit I think this list is too long‚Äîthere‚Äôs no indication people like Johnson, Biden, Harris, Sridhar, and Morrison are CCP collaborators. Only heads of state in rich countries I think might be are Merkel and Trudeau
1334232968001433600 2020-12-03 04:28:23 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Jockthedog2 I see it on your homepage‚Äîgreat stuff!

1334228217788510208 2020-12-03 04:09:30 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @karolink81 I‚Äôm no expert on that science history, but I‚Äôm pretty sure both SARS and MERS were much more deadly, meaning they spread much less far and it was easier to tell they‚Äôd fizzled out naturally.

1334204196636266499 2020-12-03 02:34:03 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Top executives at Chinese vaccine company collaborating with Canada were part of CCP's United Front, responsible for co-opting Canadian vaccine researchers.  Shocked, shocked I tell you!  https://t.co/5KgJ50lBwy

1333940889471868934 2020-12-02 09:07:46 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> ‚ÄúSince Xi Jinping became China‚Äôs top leader, Carl Schmitt‚Äôs philosophy has found even wider applications in China, in both ‚ÄòParty theory‚Äô and academic life.‚Äù  But let's still embrace the lockdown policy Xi literally invented in January, right @TheAtlantic?  https://t.co/1YXRJsi7UR
1333924865116663808 2020-12-02 08:04:05 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @WWakeUpTime @BorgerPieter Wow, scary!
1333899047804035073 2020-12-02 06:21:30 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @AlexBerenson If it was "gain-of-function research" what function did it even gain?  You don't need gain-of-function research for a common cold.  What you need is an "unprecedented public health response"‚Äîlockdowns‚Äîand propaganda to get shills to implement it.  https://t.co/1jFM77PbnC
1333896579011518469 2020-12-02 06:11:41 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @AlexBerenson Alex you just posted an article saying it had been in the US since mid-December.  So if it was an accident at the Wuhan lab, are we talking about an accident that occurred months before then?  So that means Xi's January lockdown was a fraud?  Plz explain.  https://t.co/rpywzpIVYv
1333893142102368269 2020-12-02 05:58:02 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MattYou02831366 Exactly!  Believe me I've been there many many times the past several months.  And again it's ironic because they're actually the racist ones for assuming China couldn't possibly plan anything.
1333892322745069599 2020-12-02 05:54:46 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @alohafreedomco But investigating is haaarrrd.  So much easier to just do like most journalists‚Äîaccept the new normal and hail Xi!
1333891433724567552 2020-12-02 05:51:14 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> The fact that Drosten got the PCR genomes from Shi Zhengli could help explain why the CCP is so insecure about an independent investigation of Wuhan.  It's not that the virus came from the Wuhan lab, it's that the PCR test did. h/t @Grund_gesetzt  https://t.co/JsNwNGatH8
1333891197753057280 2020-12-02 05:50:18 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Drosten's fraud PCR test, now global standard, was created using theoretical genome sequences supplied by China.  Who supplied those genome sequences?  None other than Shi Zhengli, director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, better known as "bat lady".  https://t.co/JitIAEi7NO  https://t.co/Sr487oMGlk
1333883715181801478 2020-12-02 05:20:34 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @ZsaBerki I agree.  Modern democracies have really been lulled into complacency by the idea that omnipotent intelligence agencies will rescue them from any threat.  Back when democracies were formed, people felt more personal responsibility to take part.  https://t.co/EyGnBlCDDU
1333880215525879811 2020-12-02 05:06:40 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @uselesserestyay @Milhouse_Van_Ho @PattyHajdu @CPHO_Canada @JustinTrudeau Yep, it's always been that way.  Democracy is hard-won by the few for the benefit of the many.
1333878967728738305 2020-12-02 05:01:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> ICYMI: In May 2020, Matt Hancock's team met with the Chinese Health Commission and ‚Äúexpressed that the UK is willing to strengthen anti-epidemic cooperation with China... They held in-depth discussions on topics including lockdown-lifting strategies‚Äù.  https://t.co/rhXauL0ZFx  https://t.co/plsEAJYrzL
1333871722945257473 2020-12-02 04:32:55 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MattYou02831366 Exactly right.  There does seem to be a certain racism involved thinking the Chinese aren‚Äôt capable of executing a plan like this.
1333858543661953025 2020-12-02 03:40:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MattYou02831366 Great point.  I think the truth is there's a limited pool of people willing to completely sell out their countries, so China has to settle for whichever narcissistic rats are willing to do their bidding, then pull strings to get them into these positions.
1333852272833540099 2020-12-02 03:15:38 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @DoneWithFord @PattyHajdu @cafreeland @JustinTrudeau @CPHO_Canada Good point, ironic that substance abuse has now practically doubled on her watch.
1333851368680009728 2020-12-02 03:12:02 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @nay_sue1 @freep Honestly I think this is too on-the-nose even for Global Times.  Detroit Free Press is clearly new to the propaganda business, haven't mastered the art of subtlety.
1333783439112241153 2020-12-01 22:42:07 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @daucherB @AlexBerenson @CDCgov Well, the official story is it suddenly appeared in Wuhan in Dec, and it was so super-deadly that Xi had to save the day by welding everyone in their homes.  Based on this article, that story doesn‚Äôt hold up. The Wuhan panic was staged‚ÄîXi just likes welding people in their homes.
1333779863124193280 2020-12-01 22:27:54 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @AlexBerenson @CDCgov Alex I‚Äôve noticed you periodically post good stuff like this, but also periodically post stories about it leaking from the Chinese lab.  How do you reconcile these?  Do you think it leaked out of the lab, but they only realized it several months later?  https://t.co/RubcrtfPYH
1333655041622863872 2020-12-01 14:11:54 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @leonarddoyle99 Yep, I think it's usually a bit of both.  She knows who she has to please to keep the money coming in.
1333652437287268352 2020-12-01 14:01:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Hellen_Walled Wow‚Ä¶ that's awful, but somehow I'm not surprised‚Ä¶
1333652182189690881 2020-12-01 14:00:32 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> P.S.‚Äîlike Hancock, Patty Hajdu has no apparent background in infectiology or epidemiology, her only public health experience being in substance abuse and injury prevention.  "How is this going to change the way that we relate to each other as humans?"  https://t.co/BKASNflEAY
1333649717742481410 2020-12-01 13:50:45 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @numbers97413 @dagensnyheter @Aftonbladet @HDNyheter Unfortunately it's not easy to see the payments.  Here in the US we can see them sort-of, but only because we've passed laws to make disclosure mandatory.  It's kind of impressive that China has managed to compromise every big media outlet in the world‚Ä¶  https://t.co/9BrfLmkT7u
1333648884787245056 2020-12-01 13:47:26 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Truthpullin üòÇüòÇ I have no doubt Jung Eun Kyung is in CCP's pocket, but unfortunately there's so few English-language news sources about Korea.
1333635800400015360 2020-12-01 12:55:27 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @tastelikehaggis Yep, Chinese state media approved of that recommendation.  https://t.co/D8G9sRZ0ER
1333633813642158085 2020-12-01 12:47:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> As every China expert knows "when Chinese state media is selling your virtues, you took a very bad turn in life somewhere." The fact that several Chinese state media sources have praised Hajdu throughout 2020 tells us whose interests she's looking out for.  https://t.co/KJIgEuGvcj
1333631583799087105 2020-12-01 12:38:41 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Apparently unrepentant, a few days ago Hajdu again slandered a journalist questioning data: "If‚Ä¶ the leader of the opposition stop their members from sharing fake and dangerous news‚Ä¶ saving lives of Canadians instead of spreading conspiracy theories‚Äù  https://t.co/NjD8qxrfYK
1333629395588833288 2020-12-01 12:30:00 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> As Spencer Fernando pointed out, "Propaganda Patty" "appears to be one of the only people on Earth who actually believes China‚Äôs official virus numbers."  https://t.co/5loIl2Uk2k
1333628497454043136 2020-12-01 12:26:26 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> For her September praise, Hajdu even earned a special nod from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "We noticed relevant reports and applaud the Canadian health minister's objective and fair remarks."  https://t.co/OvPGKXfDVA
1333627811505049603 2020-12-01 12:23:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Hajdu continued into September, again earning aplomb from Chinese media for defending China's data and praising China for having "alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to the emergence of novel coronavirus very early and shared the genetic sequence"  https://t.co/u09X1nPOpa
1333626120520994817 2020-12-01 12:16:59 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> But Hajdu ignored that coverage and quickly doubled down just one month later, praising China's "historic containment efforts."  https://t.co/ZkXZGud0lv
1333625602000236545 2020-12-01 12:14:55 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> After that early April exchange, Hajdu was excoriated in Canada's press for "effectively trying to gaslight her own citizens about the conduct of a habitually oppressive and untruthful regime."  https://t.co/dYgwymKuaQ
1333625185757515776 2020-12-01 12:13:16 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> In April, Hajdu defended China: ‚Äúno indication the data that came out of China in terms of their death rate and infection rate was falsified‚Äù  When a reporter pointed out contrary US intel, Hajdu scolded: "your question is feeding into conspiracy theories"  https://t.co/bydqufjjpO
1333623728027086848 2020-12-01 12:07:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Hajdu first earned the praise of Chinese foreign spokesperson Hua Chunying in early February for refusing to ban travel from China, in contrast to the US: "Canada believes the ban of entry has no basis, which is a sharp contrast for the U.S. behaviours"  https://t.co/fyq9ahYCrf
1333622836863389696 2020-12-01 12:03:56 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Hajdu's love affair with China appears to go back some time.  Here she is in 2014 admiring the Beijing sunset.  https://t.co/gIkeLUQdwV
1333622498366197761 2020-12-01 12:02:35 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Yes, like Hancock, Drosten, Mandetta, and maybe Fauci, Canada's top health minister also appears to be in China's pocket.  And no, not the mysterious Theresa Tam‚Äîno need to look that far down.  Meet Propaganda Patty Hajdu.
1333589129653874688 2020-12-01 09:50:00 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CherryCartier Good point.

1333578851092459521 2020-12-01 09:09:09 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jenneraub @laurajfagan Yep, I think that was the most effective part of the propaganda was convincing the left that it was "anti-science" to question one's initial impression of "the science" and of who was a "scientific authority."  https://t.co/LRgiI0seJR
1333577116412243970 2020-12-01 09:02:15 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Milhouse_Van_Ho @CPHO_Canada Lol @Greg_Tolan you're right, sometimes this job is just too easy.
1333573776009781254 2020-12-01 08:48:59 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @WWakeUpTime Good idea.
1333573722251390976 2020-12-01 08:48:46 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Milhouse_Van_Ho Will do.  Who's the top health official in Canada?
1333571669542260737 2020-12-01 08:40:37 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Between Hancock, Drosten, and Fauci, I'm noticing a pattern: the top "health official" in each country appears to be in the CCP's pocket (Tegnell is obvious exception).  This means Bolsonaro was right to fire Mandetta.  Which country should I look at next?  https://t.co/hDVlMnTAir
1333568053305602048 2020-12-01 08:26:15 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @KC__Holliday @Jockthedog2 Oh looks like the date was off‚Äîthat paper was actually published in May.  Still interesting though!
1333565767158206464 2020-12-01 08:17:10 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jenneraub @laurajfagan Yeah I think there's very, very few people who actually planned the lockdown fraud.  The Chinese Politburo PSC (7 people) and a few collaborators in the WHO and each country.  Even China's propagandists likely don't know why they're being asked to do it.  The rest is groupthink.
1333564589171240967 2020-12-01 08:12:29 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MrsAK2017 Oh I see.  Hmm nope can't find another source.  CGTN is China's top media outlet though, it's extremely unlikely they would report they had a meeting with Hancock if they didn't in fact have one.

1332879926689746946 2020-11-29 10:51:52 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @joobailee @adamscrabble @aeswins Agreed.  The fact that the virus is so non-deadly actually helps it spread farther.  I'm still not convinced China really "released" anything, because they could do this fraud with any normal cold virus, but agree that a benign one is more psychologically effective.
1332878947592380418 2020-11-29 10:47:59 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @SteveBigpond @MackayIM @tcp_dr @Doc_0 Seems it's worse than that. The sequence was published Jan 10 and Drosten submitted the PCR protocol to the WHO just 3 days later. Drosten then submitted it to a medical journal on which he sits ON THE BOARD and the protocol passed "peer review" in 2 days.  https://t.co/a4ZujwaVMZ
1332843415223066624 2020-11-29 08:26:47 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @adamscrabble @aeswins Exactly. The CCP knows we know it's an authoritarian country. They're not afraid to show that in their propaganda. The whole basis of the lockdown propaganda is "we succeeded against this super-virus and no one else did!  You couldn't do it?  Then be more authoritarian like us!"

It's interesting how their understanding of our institutions is actually a bit more sophisticated than ours in that sense.  They know where real power lies‚Äîmedia, academia, science, intel, politicians, etc.
1331760003879985152 2020-11-26 08:41:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @AlexBerenson Every lockdown restriction in every city, state, and country in the world is per se unconstitutional.  The lockdown operation was never meant to be legal, it was meant to overwhelm normal legal and judicial processes with raw coervice power and groupthink.  https://t.co/GS6YYnlrDS
1331755378648944640 2020-11-26 08:23:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MatanHolzer Agree, it‚Äôs insane what‚Äôs happened in Israel.  Completely unforgivable.
1331750689404547075 2020-11-26 08:04:41 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MarkChangizi Great point.
1331730432325464064 2020-11-26 06:44:12 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Yale published a study on the accuracy of various institutions' COVID models.  Guess whose models consistently had BY FAR the highest median percent error (MAPE)?  You guessed it: Imperial College, "China's best academic partner in the west"!  https://t.co/oCaJvte56w  https://t.co/D3WnLZejqu
1331711082885500928 2020-11-26 05:27:18 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CamandoCrawl @MichaelThau True.  And worth adding that no leader ever CONSCIOUSLY promotes totalitarianism.  Totalitarianism is the inevitable result of treating disagreement as a capital crime.  No one thinks Hitler, Stalin, Mao had the slightest notion what it was like to live under their own regimes.
1331705151963402240 2020-11-26 05:03:44 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CamandoCrawl @MichaelThau Some things CCP does and gets insecure about are just nonsensical.  Example, "going all in with 'COVID-19 didn‚Äôt start in China'" actually makes Wuhan lockdowns look MORE suspicious‚Äîbut Beijing is pushing this.  So I'm not sure they're really grandmasters.  https://t.co/ebZkCCM2Yn
1331697142839308291 2020-11-26 04:31:55 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CamandoCrawl Yep.  @MichaelThau's work convinced me the story of Li Wenliang is fabricated.  Biggest question is to what extent the Politburo really masterminded this whole psyop, or whether they're simply promoting global totalitarianism subconsciously.  https://t.co/j7Jc9lnRUO
1331691494609186819 2020-11-26 04:09:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @boriquagato Few really believe it.  Years later they'll say: "I supported lockdowns because others were scared‚Äîit was the only way to make them feel safe."  And those others will say: "I supported lockdowns because others were scared‚Äîit was the only way to make them feel safe."  And so on‚Ä¶

That's because they work in a collaborative, high-trust environment, making them vulnerable to con artists.  At the same time, doctors enjoy unparalleled public trust.

At 13 it was Pokemon, but I didn't care.  In high school it was football.  In college, fraternities.  Then tech stocks, wokeism, BLM.  In 1939 it was antisemitism.  Now it's lockdowns.

1331004037001596934 2020-11-24 06:37:45 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @HousesSilver @999rmiah I think that depends on how each of us respond.

They never responded to my inquiries.  I think minor celebrities often have little money, so they might run sponsored tweets for a quick buck.

1330709620495699969 2020-11-23 11:07:51 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jeffreyatucker Evidence to the contrary.  Closing schools may not have value per se, but it's crucial theatre to make the virus seem even more scary.  "Think of the children!"  Similar to the use of concentration camps to show an oppressed majority things could be worse.  https://t.co/bfQmuX0LsB

Beijing has hundreds of thousands of full-time propagandists so it makes sense to spend 90% of their time just making the accounts look real, and 10% of their time actually posting fake stuff when necessary.
1330702037726752768 2020-11-23 10:37:43 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @LibertyOne8 @AdamKlipstine @alexmaccaroon Fascinating observation‚Ä¶ accounts with thousands of followers posting something obviously cut and pasted.  Some analysts insist such accounts are real, but they're obviously fake posts.  Still unclear if they're somehow sponsored posts or just really good fake accounts‚Ä¶
1330682081589014528 2020-11-23 09:18:25 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> New idea: what if we got Xi Jinping and his propaganda army to convince our leaders to walk off a cliff together like lemmings‚Äîin the interest of public health?  Win-win.

1330617817100640257 2020-11-23 05:03:03 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Funny how, among polite society, it's taboo to discuss any aspect of China's pandemic response other than the Wuhan virology lab.  The fact that Xi personally "authorized the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan" sold to the world soon after by his flunkies @WHO is unmentionable.  https://t.co/DqAUbdZORr

1330343961484029959 2020-11-22 10:54:51 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> So there you have it: CCP = WEF and WEF = CCP.  Not your imagination then that the WEF's "Great Reset" looks, smells, and quacks like something much older: communism.  big h/t to Nick Picker and @aya_velazquez
1330342967568183302 2020-11-22 10:50:54 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Klaus Schwab, head of WEF, has close China ties.  His son, Olivier Schwab, has headed WEF's Beijing office since 2011.  In 2017, Xi PERSONALLY visited the WEF, and per Schwab: "the international community is looking to China to continue its responsive and responsible leadership"  https://t.co/69Jyt1m59A

1330338698580389901 2020-11-22 10:33:56 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> BIG: the WEF sponsors a global youth group (*cough, Hitler youth*) of 10,000 Global Shapers.

1330202924090322946 2020-11-22 01:34:25 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @HelenTeaPot @AlexBerenson Good point, they may just be trying to cover up the crime scene at this point.  That‚Äôs probably the best theory.
1330202517435789323 2020-11-22 01:32:48 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CamandoCrawl @Wordsmithery_me Exactly.  Strategically, at a high level, it‚Äôs Sun Tzu-level genius. But seeing all the flunkies put the plan into practice is usually more comical than anything.  https://t.co/2VZds3ZPX8
1330200278218518529 2020-11-22 01:23:54 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @AlexBerenson Only one thing comes out of a totalitarian country: the party line.  Using 37 to 40 CTs, there should have been many thousands of false positives. But instead, they report just 300 cases. So the data is a lie.  So for some reason, the party line on asymptomaic spread changed.

1329957690706173955 2020-11-21 09:19:57 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 39/  Underlying the "science" of lockdown is the concept of "asymptomatic spread"‚Äîa major departure from prior knowledge‚Äîwithout which the scientific case for lockdowns falls apart.

1329840165506920450 2020-11-21 01:32:57 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Totalitarianism is a virus.  It starts with a single deranged individual/cell‚Äîpathologically replicating, corrupting, or killing all others by any available means.

So if we only blame the politicians and do nothing about the CCP, the CCP will simply corrupt the next batch and do this all over again.

1328848170613411840 2020-11-18 07:51:07 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 4/ The author of this @nytimes article must know the reason every COVID lab is conducting PCR tests at 37 to 40 cycle thresholds is because of WHO guidance based on two studies from China.  Yet, the article never mentions @WHO or China.  Why is that?  https://t.co/T2sutlB4d4
1328836436003577857 2020-11-18 07:04:29 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 3/ So that's the banal story of how the excessive 37 to 40 cycle thresholds became global standard for COVID PCR testing, driving the case-demic.  China's numbers 37 to 40 were simply the only ones included in @WHO's global testing recommendations.  https://t.co/T2sutlB4d4

1328791623787012099 2020-11-18 04:06:25 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Bizarre that CDC slipped this story about 1918 quarantines into its literature in April 2019‚Äîa very lame propaganda piece countless media outlets pointed to to placate readers skeptical of unprecedented lockdowns.  Either an odd coincidence, or a CCP mole at CDC slipped it in..

1328783877767303170 2020-11-18 03:35:38 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @metasoarous @Conaw @bbchase @WHO It's impossible to be an expert in a policy that has never been tested.  Thus, because lockdowns were "unprecedented in public health history" before 2020, anyone calling themselves an expert wrt lockdowns is lying.  https://t.co/Ct1UIunq1C
1328783047873925122 2020-11-18 03:32:20 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @metasoarous @Conaw @bbchase @WHO All of the above.  Lockdowns are murder.  They were laundered into scientific policy on false premises‚Äîthat China eliminated cases, when in fact all CCP did was forge their data, badly.  Since they're unprecedented before 2020, they underwent no scientific testing.

1328366353300992000 2020-11-16 23:56:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Paul_Goldstein Exactly.

Anyone who still supports lockdowns on the info we have now is a low-life criminal, regardless of prior qualifications.

1328183773263925248 2020-11-16 11:51:02 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> If @realDonaldTrump really wants to crack down on China and get back at Democrats, he should let the public know about China's clandestine campaign for global lockdowns.

1327027361976623106 2020-11-13 07:15:52 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Almost a year ago, news broke of China's authorities welding doors shut in an unprecedented "lockdown" of Wuhan.

1326631107123687425 2020-11-12 05:01:18 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Dr. Michael Yeadon has previously written an excellent deep-dive on Hancock's baldfaced lies throughout the COVID crisis, driving the need for more lockdowns.  https://t.co/T5BIQFwXYi   https://t.co/3Q9r9SWtxN
1326630308012318720 2020-11-12 04:58:07 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Good article on Matt Hancock, the ambitious former-economist who had no background in health before becoming UK Health Secretary.  He showed no interest in his job except as political stepping-stone, and to increase adoption of tech, especially from China.  https://t.co/qZUZ59LSCu  https://t.co/Ox3rmmoLGq
1326594151585034241 2020-11-12 02:34:27 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @shunty19 @UNWatch Such a joke.
1326593494383792130 2020-11-12 02:31:50 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @rayandherdog @ScoreSchoeneman Yeah I'm getting more interested in the connection between the WEF and the CCP.
1326590441643499527 2020-11-12 02:19:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @EricS80 Yep.  I think the propaganda is especially effective in the west because westerners have so little experience with it.  I've noticed people with family from Eastern Europe are much less convinced by it.
1326589096874160135 2020-11-12 02:14:22 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @nvladivostok1 I don't know.  Apparently anybody who's anybody is on the CCP's payroll, but they never tried to recruit me.
1326585846972227585 2020-11-12 02:01:27 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @EricS80 Testament to the power of propaganda.  It's invisible and omnipresent.  People automatically associate lockdown resistance with "white supremacy" and "anti-science," so they accept all the measures.  Why do they make those associations?  Propaganda.  But they don't know that.
1326584642498158594 2020-11-12 01:56:40 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @ScoreSchoeneman Wow wtf?  I wasn't sure what to think of the Great Reset stuff, but the fact that bots are trying to promote it proves that the CCP is very invested in it.
1326348792178880512 2020-11-11 10:19:29 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> On the question of justice, I defer to the people.  I just want lockdowns to end and human rights restored.  If that means the CCP collaborators all get off free, so be it.  If it means dusting off the guillotines‚Ä¶ just as good.  https://t.co/qgTLlA9oMQ
1326314667707404289 2020-11-11 08:03:53 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @alexmaccaroon Ugh.. yep, anyone who advocates any kind of "new normal" has sold their soul.
1326314339058507778 2020-11-11 08:02:34 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @HotZone_Chiller Yep.  Worst part is, I suspect Trump might've done little to intervene because he thought he could win re-election by fomenting resentment against lockdowns. So, we fight this battle ourselves. Only silver lining is, now Dems might listen since they know we're not being partisan.  https://t.co/0O10iJzL1H

1326286667234349057 2020-11-11 06:12:37 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 4/ With every prominent lockdown advocate, we see the same story:  Financial ties to China‚û°Ô∏èTrusting China's lies‚û°Ô∏èEndorsing China's narrative‚û°Ô∏èAdvocating lockdowns‚û°Ô∏èOutright treason.  Once Xi seduces you onto the lockdown train, there's no easy way off.  https://t.co/EX1lEfJVqg
1326286310844329985 2020-11-11 06:11:12 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 3/ For example, a quick review of top donors to the Council on Foreign Relations shows a nexus with the board of Tsinghua University, Xi Jinping's alma mater.  https://t.co/j1FazLMUhT  Overlap: Paulson, Dimon, Greenberg, Schwarzman, Fink, Muhtar Kent, etc.  https://t.co/jmXFyMJAuN

1326285384947527681 2020-11-11 06:07:31 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 1/ Tom Frieden is another prominent advocate of COVID lockdowns with strong, long-time ties to China, who has spent most of 2020 praising China's lockdowns while disparaging the United States.  https://t.co/Sum6LVwtEX

1326261774337929222 2020-11-11 04:33:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @ryanlcooper Wrong. All China did was lie, as totalitarian regimes do best.  You're relying on data from the same regime that runs concentration camps and lies about it daily. Lockdowns had no scientific history and were always fraud, Xi conceived them for export.  https://t.co/VdC2DkDckG

1326217142023442433 2020-11-11 01:36:21 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @ninoguzzo Agreed.
1325994165809917952 2020-11-10 10:50:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jpr41411 @dchackethal @naomirwolf They've been doing this for a century‚Äîpropaganda has really always been the CCP's core competency, hence the evil, masterful simplicity.  Inviting the CCP to spread internet propaganda was opening the door for them to weaponize their greatest strength.  https://t.co/j9trwFNQXh
1325992664794337280 2020-11-10 10:44:21 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CamandoCrawl @kyotolover89 The CCP knows we know it's an authoritarian country.  There's no harm to the CCP in confirming what everyone already knows, so the "coverup" story was actually harmless to the CCP, and very important to distract intel officials and sow fear of COVID.  https://t.co/1jFM77PbnC
1325990197058744320 2020-11-10 10:34:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Hellen_Walled @naomirwolf Social media companies are useless when it comes to detecting this type of political disinformation, because it's generally written by the CCP's army of hundreds of thousands of full-time propagandists, which is impossible to detect algorithmically.  More on that in my article.
1325989519208878082 2020-11-10 10:31:51 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @dchackethal @naomirwolf The CCP generally prefers the human touch for its political disinformation.  Sometimes, when they're making something go viral in a hurry, they hash out tweets with simple, identical language, but this is more typical for a sybil attack.  More info here:  https://t.co/VdC2DkDckG
1325984034128850946 2020-11-10 10:10:03 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @naomirwolf @nvladivostok1 Yep, Andrews is deep in CCP connections, and he was publicly scolded for signing onto Xi's Belt and Road initiative without consulting the Prime Minister.  https://t.co/FAEbsWOKjV
1325925714873339904 2020-11-10 06:18:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> In short, the CCP playbook hasn't changed: more gaslighting, propaganda, sybil attacks, fake history and fake science‚Äîsame methods they've used to rule China for a century.  https://t.co/dKhu6AHSQX
1325925557792608256 2020-11-10 06:17:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> It seems the CCP is backing off from using China as lockdown exemplar‚Äî#ChairmanDan is now lockdown poster child.  Further, the CCP is worried the public is catching on that lockdowns have no historical precedent.  Now, the 2020 lockdowns ARE the precedent for the 2020 lockdowns.  https://t.co/FjiHSaANSb
1325925234743062529 2020-11-10 06:16:25 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> When @naomirwolf noted, very accurately, that lockdowns were entirely unprecedented before Xi invented them in Jan 2020, CCP propagandists stormed her feed to reeducate her on the fact that lockdowns ARE historically precedented by the recent 2020 lockdown in Melbourne, AUS.  https://t.co/4eF4ufVk9y
1325900102289022976 2020-11-10 04:36:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> It's telling that Biden waited to release his lengthy national lockdown plan AFTER the election.  What does that tell you about the popularity of the policy?  And if the lockdown plan isn't even popular, what does that say about the motivation behind it?  https://t.co/lKX2bPeKoU

1325653259080634369 2020-11-09 12:15:41 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> The CCP's lockdown policy thereby transforms every petty local official into a tyrant, and well-meaning, intelligent people into unwitting propagandists versed in the newspeak of ‚Äúsocial distancing.‚Äù  https://t.co/2oNT7heel4
1325653052926423040 2020-11-09 12:14:51 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> As with all effective totalitarianism, the dark genius of the CCP's lockdown policy can be found in its universal language.  "Just stay home" is an Orwellian euphemism for indefinite house arrest and a blanket suspension of human rights.  https://t.co/BSSfjxp2h2

1325626492236263424 2020-11-09 10:29:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @TXtkleslie You bet, thanks!
1325601637180780551 2020-11-09 08:50:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> The CCP noticed a narrow exception in the western framework of human rights‚Äîdiseases like Ebola so deadly as to reasonably require confinement of innocent people.  Propagandizing the West into applying this exception to an endemic coronavirus would essentially end human rights.

1325534186845958147 2020-11-09 04:22:32 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Unison_David @abirballan The PCR test is calibrated to some newish virus‚Äîthis is known by the far lower number of cases/test in island countries like NZ and AUS‚Äîbut we have no idea where this newish virus started, it seems to be an ordinary coronavirus.

In other words, they know their colleagues are lying.

1323058431171960833 2020-11-02 08:24:45 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Xi's documents make it clear he has far, far more respect for the Uyghurs than for the Westerners who perverted and commodified his country. The CCP's concentration camps are used to show the Chinese majority someone has it worse than they do so they'll fight his real enemy: YOU.

1322604578966298627 2020-11-01 02:21:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 10. The intelligence community is too embarrassed to admit the truth.  Like politicians, the intelligence community might think the public can't handle the truth that they failed so spectacularly and lockdowns were all for nothing (thus playing right into Xi's hands). Evidence:  https://t.co/goIhnJQ02V
1322597680208556032 2020-11-01 01:53:54 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 9. The intelligence community may know, but politicians aren‚Äôt acting.  The intelligence community reports to the president/PM. If the president/PM doesn‚Äôt want the public to know China is behind lockdowns (e.g., to preserve trade ties), s/he can simply table the intel report.
1322597452596334593 2020-11-01 01:53:00 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 8. The intelligence community is compromised and getting fed bad intel.  The CIA is certainly a bit compromised‚Äî3 CIA agents have recently been arrested for spying for China.  Double-agents can effectively feed bad intel of the super-bio-weapon variety.  https://t.co/jURMscPaX2
1322597248623104000 2020-11-01 01:52:11 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 7. The intelligence community may be split as to whether COVID is dangerous.  Based on my communications with intel folks, some believe COVID is a super-bio-weapon, and some think lockdowns are China‚Äôs plan. Thus, they may be erring on the side of caution by doing nothing.
1322597094763438080 2020-11-01 01:51:34 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 6. Intelligence officials are public employees unaffected by lockdowns.  Just like other Zoom-meeting professionals, intelligence officials bring home big paychecks regardless of productivity, and may not care about lockdowns because they‚Äôre not personally affected by them.  https://t.co/gZx2NbU6ef
1322596943449804800 2020-11-01 01:50:58 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 5. The intelligence community may be incompetent.  Contrary to popular imagination, the CIA tends to be far more incompetent than omnipotent.  https://t.co/4tkuxwLYHJ
1322596854421286912 2020-11-01 01:50:37 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 4. They suspect China is driving lockdowns, but they‚Äôre not 100% sure.  Announcing a war with a superpower is a big deal.  So it‚Äôs possible intelligence agencies strongly suspect China is driving lockdowns, but they need to dot their i‚Äôs and cross their t‚Äôs before going public.
1322596690839425024 2020-11-01 01:49:58 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 3. The cleverness of world domination through public health.  Officials have said intelligence agencies were blindsided that public health might be used for geopolitical domination‚Äîwhich is exactly why the opportunity appealed so much to the CCP.  https://t.co/Zf7yqDUaxV
1322596458466627584 2020-11-01 01:49:03 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 2. The cleverness of the lab as decoy.  The CCP has deliberately funded rumors that COVID is a super-brain-eating-bio-weapon, mostly to discredit intelligence officials. Based on my interactions with intelligence folks, this decoy has been very effective.  https://t.co/1jFM77PbnC
1322596327981801477 2020-11-01 01:48:31 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 1. They just don‚Äôt know.  Immersed in our anti-lockdown community, it‚Äôs easy to forget how niche we are. Intel officials have expressed great interest in my work‚Äîit‚Äôs meant in part as a tip for them. So intelligence agencies may just not know yet.  https://t.co/sXbZdsJg3F

The total failure of the intelligence community to connect China with lockdowns is the most devastating part of this story.  I can only speculate as to several explanations, roughly in order of least-to-most concerning:
1322569932534620160 2020-11-01 00:03:38 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @TenzinTara @nytimes @paulmozur Yes I agree.

1322278049740705792 2020-10-31 04:43:48 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Xi certainly knows how to give back to his alma mater‚Äîthe Board of Tsinghua University is essentially a who's-who of the world's financial oligarchy:  Paulson, Blankfein, Dimon, Schwarzman, Tim Cook, Dell, Nadella, Musk, Ghosn, Jack Ma, Wang Qishan, Muhtar Kent, Zuckerberg‚Ä¶
1322275719376965634 2020-10-31 04:34:32 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MrSimpleSense @jenvanlaar Yeah China has significant stakes in companies across silicon valley (which is a big reason their stock prices are so high).  Generally not controlling interests, but certainly enough to align their interests and direct policy in a pro-CCP direction.  https://t.co/WKLIoE93AK
1322273222512005120 2020-10-31 04:24:37 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @prayinforpeace1 No it's simply absurd to accept China's claim that the virus didn't spread to cities outside Hubei. And if you accept the premise that COVID requires exceptional action, CCP has already won. The vast majority of CCP's propaganda simply hypes the idea that COVID is exceptional.

1321993057789726720 2020-10-30 09:51:21 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> As @Truthpullin documents, the pro-Beijing South Korean Moon government has, all year long, used COVID to punish and track political opponents and churchgoers, ban opposition protests, close businesses, and "quarantine" perfectly healthy people.  The "new normal."
1321990009516412929 2020-10-30 09:39:14 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> As The Economist wrote recently: "The great thing about using a small country to support your argument is that your opponents are unlikely to know what is really going on there."

1319320713057177604 2020-10-23 00:52:24 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 4D chess indeed.   Meanwhile our intelligence agencies playing checkers, at best‚Äîmore like Candyland. Investigating useless virology labs which mean nothing even if the virus came from there, when all the evidence that China orchestrated global lockdowns is right in front of us.

1316050778222714885 2020-10-14 00:18:51 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> In hindsight, it's clear the modern paradigm of outsourcing, low interest, and dubious climate regs which has gutted the middle class is a direct result of CCP corruption.  Faking a pandemic to bankrupt what‚Äôs left of our small businesses was just a bold new step on Xi‚Äôs part.

Bear in mind between the Chinese Civil War, Korea, and Vietnam, we've fought and/or sponsored more conventional wars against China than any other country.  We may have forgotten, but Xi hasn't.
1315005069176311809 2020-10-11 03:03:34 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @JohnHar13277328 1) Such officials really want to decouple, but don't realize COVID is a lockdown psyop, or 2) They DO know COVID is a psyop, and they're actually shilling for CCP with the false lab theory. I don't believe 2) is true in most cases, so we need to draw their attention to the psyop.
1315004956357939200 2020-10-11 03:03:07 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @JohnHar13277328 Here's something weird to think about: when some of our officials accuse CCP of releasing COVID (likely wrongly, because the lab is a decoy), that's a BIG allegation of bio-terrorism which could only mean total decoupling from China.  So that leaves only two possibilities:
1314988150175993857 2020-10-11 01:56:20 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @essentialgreed @WHO No question there's a LOT of complicity and cover-up going on by US elites, but a big part of the reason tech companies are censoring anti-lockdown voices is because the CCP is so heavily invested in big tech.  https://t.co/OSa5y5Zyqd
1314987382232551426 2020-10-11 01:53:17 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @JohnHar13277328 I think so.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of intelligent elites simply don't want to see it, either out of embarrassment they bought into lockdowns or because they don't want a complete decoupling from China, so they won't even begin to look at the evidence.
1314980054913425409 2020-10-11 01:24:10 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @JohnHar13277328 Idk.  A lot of China hawks and intel officials are still pushing the easy lab-made virus theory, but CCP has been deliberately using the lab as a decoy so I don't think the lab-made theory will ever work.  So I wake up every day hoping they'll finally connect lockdowns with CCP.

Xi is explicit that a lot of this is revenge for China's "century of humiliation," and it comes straight out of the European imperialist playbook.  Given the millions of starving children, it's unthinkably evil regardless.

But Tedros and Bruce Aylward are completely corrupt and held the two key roles that enabled the initial domino effect for lockdowns.

1312848081940033537 2020-10-05 04:12:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @chrissyclark_ @FreeBeacon Just discovered all your work on conflicts between the CCP and US media outlets and universities. Great stuff!  I think @FDRLST ran a piece on my work a couple months back, but this article adds some context regarding the malevolence of the CCP's purposes.  https://t.co/VdC2DkDckG
1312842881871249409 2020-10-05 03:51:49 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> A treasure trove of connections between MSM outlets and the CCP.  ‚ÄúYou often see representatives from American companies with financial ties to China naturally become defenders of the CCP‚Äôs policies and spreading the CCP‚Äôs propaganda.‚Äù h/t @Truthpullin  https://t.co/9BrfLmkT7u
1312836913330618369 2020-10-05 03:28:06 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @ExpatAftermath @badtux99 Very interesting.

1312834238782341124 2020-10-05 03:17:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CronyCapital @GiuseppePisti12 Agree 100%.
1312746289503916032 2020-10-04 21:27:59 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 5/5  totally sure how to say what that *something* is.  It leads me to believe US intelligence knows and suspects more about the CCP‚Äôs snake-oil pandemic response than they‚Äôve let on, they may be waiting to be 100% sure so as not to stoke anger and burn bridges.
1312746054971011077 2020-10-04 21:27:03 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 4/5  This adds to the big mystery of 2020: ultra-hawkish actions by the federal government that seem about more than merely covering up a virus for a few days.  It again suggests the administration believes the CCP has done something horribly wrong this year, they‚Äôre just not
1312745467487420416 2020-10-04 21:24:43 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 3/5  This is an enormous step, marking a turn from tough words to concrete actions.  The CCP has over 90 million members, so before celebrating too much, remember this likely affects people we know, though there are some exceptions and waivers available.
1312745127505526784 2020-10-04 21:23:22 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 2/5  The USCIS policy dusts off an old law from 1952 which has lain dormant (unenforced) since the Cold War.  Earlier this year, Pompeo, O‚ÄôBrien, Wray, and Barr referred to the CCP as a totalitarian threat, but this is the first official policy to do so.
1312744946668105728 2020-10-04 21:22:39 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 1/5  Big News: USCIS issues policy generally disallowing visas and green cards for members of the CCP or ‚Äúother totalitarian party.‚Äù  To my knowledge, this is the first official policy referring to the CCP as ‚Äútotalitarian‚Äù since the end of the Cold War.  https://t.co/BxMYF9E3lt
1312514233825783808 2020-10-04 06:05:53 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @allenmike734 @allisonpearson All dancing to Xi's beat.  https://t.co/VdC2DklAW6
1312513708375961601 2020-10-04 06:03:48 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Tony__Heller Yep.  The CCP did far more than just invent the idea.  https://t.co/VdC2DklAW6
1312512695384436736 2020-10-04 05:59:46 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @mpukita There's a slight error in your image‚Äîan "fr" at the beginning of "enemy."
1312509866829774849 2020-10-04 05:48:32 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> COVID is way beyond Tiananmen.  Excusing the CCP for COVID is tantamount to saying "Look, someone bombed Pearl Harbor! Maybe it was the Japanese, but maybe it was a mistake.  Even if it wasn't, they're scary, maybe we shouldn't have been in Hawaii anyway. Let's give them Hawaii."
1312482634421858304 2020-10-04 04:00:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 3/3  Many experts have noted a tendency for good people to engage in unique mental gymnastics to excuse Xi Jinping.  Something about his pudgy Pooh-like features masks that he's the genocidal tyrant his mass purges and concentration camps reveal him to be.  https://t.co/BJAi21ZDsp
1312482058942390273 2020-10-04 03:58:02 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 2/3  The theory that COVID came from the US was launched by Chinese state media, but even they abandoned it as too far-fetched.  The US has remarkably little influence in China following a 2010 info leak resulting in a purge of the CIA's China network.  https://t.co/zf5VkpVK4p
1312481908782059520 2020-10-04 03:57:26 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 1/3  No the US certainly did NOT engineer COVID.  COVID doesn't seem to be engineered; it's quite weak regardless. But the fraudulent data, propaganda, hysteria, and snake-oil pseudoscience all come directly from the CCP, and the CCP are the only ones who benefit geopolitically.
1312477858787258368 2020-10-04 03:41:20 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @ExpatAftermath @GCarty80 Exactly.
1312457936304705536 2020-10-04 02:22:10 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @whereiwouldbe @Cowandos @realDonaldTrump Exactly.  That‚Äôs what real leadership would have looked like.

Eventually we‚Äôll have to go back and re-count all the causes of death ignoring the false COVID designations.
1312455938972938242 2020-10-04 02:14:14 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @OldHick17800719 @w_terrence Yeah that‚Äôs a typo I made in a couple obscure tweets a few months ago.  Also confusing is there‚Äôs a British SAGE and a WHO SAGE, mixed those up a couple times.
1312427242195165186 2020-10-04 00:20:12 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @ExpatAftermath Great point.

1312157863188463617 2020-10-03 06:29:47 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @divine_dividend @realDonaldTrump Psyop.
1312157003607764993 2020-10-03 06:26:23 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Never pass up an opportunity for some lockdown propaganda.  This is how the editor-in-chief of  https://t.co/HRVDXYzYYL reacted to news of @realDonaldTrump's illness:  "If Trump had carried out stricter measures in social distancing/facial mask/lockdown"

1312132895658573825 2020-10-03 04:50:35 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @garth_mathews Yep.
1312091853446164481 2020-10-03 02:07:30 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @KokilaP96033033 Exactly.
1312086775029002241 2020-10-03 01:47:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @ElenaLi95553413 @LibertyOne8 Absolutely agree that our leaders are guilty, and that we should find smarter, less shallow and gullible leaders.  But disagree re China as a villain. The CCP is absolutely tyrannical, guilty to a far greater degree for this than anyone else, and needs to be treated as such.
1312068039609929730 2020-10-03 00:32:52 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @LibertyOne8 Exactly, it‚Äôs not just fudging the truth a bit.  It‚Äôs a carefully-orchestrated, elaborate psychological operation to convince world leaders that millions would die unless they shredded their constitutions, thereby resulting in the deaths of millions of others.
1312049899224158208 2020-10-02 23:20:47 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MS2513479406 Did you read the article before commenting?  @WHO was absolutely not ‚Äúcritical of it.‚Äù  https://t.co/MmAJ5TI1wn
1312040492440395777 2020-10-02 22:43:24 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jamesbrown @WHO To which part of that are you referring?
1312037235856945153 2020-10-02 22:30:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @oakcitytrio Nope, she‚Äôs a lying CCP shill through and through.  Just one, fairly ordinary coronavirus.  The reason things keep opening and closing again is because of spread, testing, and politics, not because CCP keeps releasing more viruses.
1312035425561837568 2020-10-02 22:23:16 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @cshemenway @Rish1kesh Nope but that‚Äôs a great idea!
1312034933687431168 2020-10-02 22:21:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jpr41411 Great article!
1312027759775043586 2020-10-02 21:52:48 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @thiccrichard2 @realDonaldTrump Exactly.
1311851573761527808 2020-10-02 10:12:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Cowandos @realDonaldTrump That would be the inevitable Dem response.  But really it's opposite of martial law, using federal strength to ENSURE rights, like Reconstruction.  It's politically risky but the right thing to do‚Äîending lockdowns in America would end them in the third world, saving many lives.
1311850630470946822 2020-10-02 10:08:57 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @kyotolover89 @realDonaldTrump Yes I think so.  The recent hawkishness of the military, CIA and FBI suggests they suspect more about the CCP's snake-oil pandemic response than they're letting on.  At the very least, he could just read my article.  If the president says "it's a CCP PSYOP" then it's a CCP PSYOP.
1311848784872255489 2020-10-02 10:01:37 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @nay_sue1 @jeffreyatucker Excellent article.
1311797399640252416 2020-10-02 06:37:26 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @realDonaldTrump deserves credit for disliking lockdowns, qualified by the fact he's in a privileged position and could largely end them anytime.  All he has to say is "lockdowns are a CCP PSYOP."  The feds should actively ensure individual rights like the Union post-Civil War.
1311789022759587840 2020-10-02 06:04:09 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @DoctaStudLee I think CCP had short and long-term goals.  They weakened human rights, crippled economies, obtained cheap assets, and expanded influence.  A more long-term goal was to spread totalitarian factual and more relativism.  And domestically, Xi could declare COVID a Chinese "victory."
1311787325236695041 2020-10-02 05:57:24 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jamesbrown Per my article, @WHO explicitly said lockdowns "new to science" and "unprecedented."  Citing pre-eminent historians, federal court held "there is no record of any imposition of a population lockdown in response to [1918 flu] or any other in our history."  https://t.co/AG1xO2i7ds
1311778494901374976 2020-10-02 05:22:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> "Rather than learning from the failures of earlier lockdowns, Biden proffers a bigger Reverse Neutron Bomb ‚Äì something that obliterates the remnants of the economy and schooling while purportedly preserving the lives (if not the sanity) of the people"  https://t.co/N7VD1b9pOI
1311777281430433792 2020-10-02 05:17:30 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> "The lockdowns are looking less like a gigantic error and more like the unfolding of a fanatical political ideology... It‚Äôs time we take it seriously and combat it with the same fervor with which a free people resisted all the other evil ideologies"  https://t.co/0PzFLsm9fS
1311770949709168641 2020-10-02 04:52:20 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @KokilaP96033033 Thanks!
1311770284505075721 2020-10-02 04:49:41 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Unathi_Kwaza @GarethCliff Exactly.  https://t.co/VdC2DkDckG
1311768963437735939 2020-10-02 04:44:27 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @peter_castleden Yes.  https://t.co/VdC2DkDckG
1311762275980714005 2020-10-02 04:17:52 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Buried lede: looks like Adam Schiff got my article.  Political opportunism aside, this is a very good thing for the world.  Xi's biggest fear is a Cold-War-type bi-partisan consensus for a new, long-overdue Iron Curtain and hawkish "Reagan Doctrine."  https://t.co/Zf7yqDUaxV
1311751835464671232 2020-10-02 03:36:23 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @1stbornAmerican Haha no but some have said my article is making the rounds on capitol hill, which is exciting!  Yes no question CCP actively propagandized the BLM protests at all levels and funds BLM leadership, which is infuriating because 99% of BLM supporters are just well-meaning kids.
1311632018388770816 2020-10-01 19:40:16 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GiuseppePisti12 @JordanSchachtel @WHO Great points!
1311534724637229059 2020-10-01 13:13:40 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @_larry_sellers Exactly.
1311534504943722496 2020-10-01 13:12:47 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @nay_sue1 @writtenbychoice Yep, I suspect the same thing.
1311476678758203398 2020-10-01 09:23:00 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> This is massive, because regardless of what one believes about the merits of lockdown, if deadly medical protocols were promulgated to sell ventilators, that's tantamount to murder-for-profit.
1311476093782814720 2020-10-01 09:20:41 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> BOMBSHELL by @JordanSchachtel. Early guidance for "invasive mechanical ventilation" as the "first choice" for COVID patients was made in February by "Chinese expert consensus" and then spread by @WHO, killing thousands and driving Chinese ventilator sales.  https://t.co/eLPBUzejuy
1311472728591994881 2020-10-01 09:07:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @JordanSchachtel WOW, incredible work Jordan!  Regardless of one's views on lockdowns, knowingly pushing early intubation to boost ventilator sales is essentially just murder for profit.  This is HUGE.

1311393818655297537 2020-10-01 03:53:45 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @scheat_show @whereiwouldbe The CCP hires agents like this fake whistleblower to lie and pretend to accuse the CCP of lying about the virus not being man-made, in order to distract China hawks and make them think the virus is super dangerous.

A contact emailed me with a mountain of evidence that all the Johns Hopkins case data is being algorithmically forged from a data center in Beijing.  Sadly, can't say I was surprised.  He's writing an article or site about it now.

1311029974883872774 2020-09-30 03:47:58 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @FreakUnique2 Agree, there is complicity at all levels of government; they clearly know or at least suspect more about this sham than they let on.  I think they're afraid of the political reckoning and think we can't handle the truth, and in some cases are trying to preserve ties with China.

I think it's a hypothesis that many inquiring minds have suspected, the trick has been starting to gather the hard evidence of the CCP's campaign.

I don't worry too much about that, as long as the truth comes to light, plenty of people will go to jail‚Äîthe ones who don't will have an eternity to consider what they've done.
1310768240226959360 2020-09-29 10:27:56 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @blessedbradys I feel the same way, it's one of those historical travesties that's far too much to wrap one's mind around.  Just keep working to bring the truth to light, that's the best we can do.
1310767575404613639 2020-09-29 10:25:17 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @jeeenathan Yep.  Our kids will look back at these headlines with bewilderment..

1310758035124555779 2020-09-29 09:47:22 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @chasebillow @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Duly noted.  I'll be curious what she says during confirmation hearings.

1310748462787461120 2020-09-29 09:09:20 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @janmehlhose @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Fair point.  I'll be curious what she has to say about lockdowns during the confirmation hearings.
1310748144087564293 2020-09-29 09:08:04 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @LAURENCEJAMS @alexmaccaroon Yep, seems like a real sleeze bag.  I didn't see any evidence he was in on the CCP's scam before it hit, he probably jumped on the gravy train for his own corrupt purposes, but I'm sure the CCP helped make his pro-lockdown articles go viral.

Best you can say is perhaps Trump didn't know about her pro-lockdown stance, but seems unlikely.  https://t.co/YxD8Dy3cyM
1310689105018261508 2020-09-29 05:13:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Now that @JoeBiden has promised to "follow the science" (i.e. "follow Xi Jinping") to lock down America, and @RealDonaldTrump nominated the very pro-lockdown #Barrett, this is a good time to review: who is the most anti-lockdown third party candidate?

1309874930981494789 2020-09-26 23:18:14 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> The truth tends to be authoritative.
1309873313817276419 2020-09-26 23:11:48 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @publius20330476 @adamscrabble @robert_spalding There were certainly collaborators during the Cold War, and it took decades for Western liberals to realize Stalin was a tyrant.  But no regime has ever weaponized propaganda this aggressively, in part because of the new power of social media.
1309872685804122112 2020-09-26 23:09:19 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @CarloFabio1 @WHO Absolutely.  99% of the support for lockdowns comes from people jumping on board out of their own groupthink and self-interest.  CCP‚Äôs plan never would have worked without that snowball effect driven in part by partisanship.
1309666519564120064 2020-09-26 09:30:05 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @NewYorker @NewYorker still spreading CCP propaganda I see.  https://t.co/GFO1wvQjSj
1309663894722543616 2020-09-26 09:19:39 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Amtrup1 @MarkChangizi @AmTrump Most of all, since its founding, propaganda has always been CCP's biggest strength.  They were extremely small and ruled terribly during the Chinese Civil War, and only won through unparalleled mastery of propaganda.  It's always been VERY powerful stuff.  https://t.co/j9trwFNQXh
1309663023699824641 2020-09-26 09:16:11 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Amtrup1 @MarkChangizi @AmTrump Whistleblowers have confirmed that malicious political activities have long been social media companies' dirty secret, causing "disproportionate impact."  These activities are nearly impossible to identify automatically, because they use human input.  https://t.co/6ZRCVsY9T3
1309662489076998150 2020-09-26 09:14:04 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Amtrup1 @MarkChangizi So obviously I agree with @amtrump on this, here's why.  While 99% of the harm might have resulted from Western groupthink and shallowness, the intent and action was there on the part of the CCP, and I don't believe lockdowns ever would have happened without their planning.
1309639860324634624 2020-09-26 07:44:09 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @IlanaMcdS Yep.  https://t.co/a04xpHB77z
1309623714108133376 2020-09-26 06:39:59 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 31/  The Wuhan Lab and CCP's fake "whistleblowers" hyping a "man-made super-virus" have been key psychological decoys, distracting hawkish intelligence officials and filling them with the same irrational fear that popularizes CCP's indefinite lockdowns.  https://t.co/ajOOPDygsZ
1309618813743312897 2020-09-26 06:20:31 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @publius20330476 @adamscrabble @robert_spalding Exactly.  One reason I know a lot about this is because I've studied Russian disinformation for the past few years.  Safe to say it wasn't taken seriously enough in part because it helped the right.  Then the CCP blindsided the west with this unprecedented influence operation.
1309574599877763074 2020-09-26 03:24:49 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Wordsmithery_me Thank you for sharing that.  Very disturbing..

1307439310426210306 2020-09-20 05:59:57 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @FranksBullitts @pwafork Yep.  It does seem that the state department knows, or at least suspects, more about this than they're letting on.

My initial conclusion is that these cities' leaders are simply more inclined to follow global initiatives, making them more susceptible to the influence of WHO and CCP during COVID.  I.e., just correlation.  But I'm open to more sinister evidence.

1307060307878195205 2020-09-19 04:53:56 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @U_R_2_Serious I think part is that they've worked with China a long time and have close relations with Chinese scientists.  And also they thought this was the big one. This was Fauci's moment, he would be the hero! But wait, he was tricked?  He's a mass murderer? How could he ever face that?
1307050435883274249 2020-09-19 04:14:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MichaelThau @SuzorOlivier True.  Having these "whistleblowers" pretend the virus is a man-made super-bug is key part of the psy-op, because it distracts China hawks and military and intelligence folks, filling them with the same fear that makes them acquiesce to lockdowns.

1306971355825557504 2020-09-18 23:00:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @OZzSue4 @pwafork Absolutely.  It‚Äôs long past time to acknowledge China is once again a deadly, totalitarian state.  Time to decouple.

1306970356926869505 2020-09-18 22:56:30 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @fishman1975 @pwafork I certainly believe there is.  Andrews‚Äô long-time staffer Nancy Yang attended a high-level CCP propaganda academy, and his Belt and Road broker explicitly praised China‚Äôs COVID response.
1306969887105974272 2020-09-18 22:54:38 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @AA63er @pwafork Nope, it most certainly has not.  One of the many pieces of evidence that this was a deliberate scare campaign.

But I‚Äôll admit there‚Äôs a darker possibility he was knowingly aiding and abetting the CCP‚Äôs propaganda due to his socialist connections.  I‚Äôve identified at least one other individual who did so‚ÄîSarah Chambers in Chicago Teachers Union.

1306944221681725440 2020-09-18 21:12:38 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @abirballan @GCarty80 Lockdowns are patently unconstitutional in every city, state, and country in which they‚Äôve been implemented.  Commenters sometimes pretend that the reason there was no national lockdown in the US and Sweden was the constitution.  But constitutions were set aside everywhere else.
1306834959676604423 2020-09-18 13:58:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MarkMcGrane1 Much appreciated, thank you!  Sadly, like fascism and communism, it‚Äôs tough to argue the lockdowns have really ‚Äúaccomplished‚Äù anything.  At best, a lesson for the future?  An impetus to decouple from China and reform social media?  We‚Äôll have to settle for that, at a high cost..
1306831423433736192 2020-09-18 13:44:25 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @LoelleF @MichaelThau Great point.
1306817848141021185 2020-09-18 12:50:29 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @LeslieLAllen2 Exactly right.
1306816619348361219 2020-09-18 12:45:36 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MichaelThau @p_hdb True.  Though tbh I seriously doubt men as rich and famous as Gates and Fauci are taking CCP money.  CCP must have co-opted them another way, like flattery.  But the crooks I named in my report: Tedros, Aylward, Horton, maybe Ding and Bar-Yam, I'm quite sure are on CCP payroll.
1306814744767201280 2020-09-18 12:38:09 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @p_hdb @MichaelThau Yep, it's psychologically effective because it's so non-dangerous, so the fear can last forever.  A dangerous virus would not only kill more Chinese people (which even Xi might find cruel) but would also be easier to track, making it less scary than a hyped-up cold like COVID.
1306800384762052609 2020-09-18 11:41:05 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @MichaelThau @denisrancourt Hahahaha exactly.  "I'll have to refer you to my manager to speak more about that.  Xi on line 1?"

Excellent analysis about the "whistleblower," I'd been going back and forth on her, but you convinced me completely regarding her lack of fear, lack of concern for relatives, and her exaggerated and contradictory claims about COVID's danger.  She's CCP.

1306713254601854977 2020-09-18 05:54:52 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 Yes that's right, they simply stopped counting and I'm sure the real number of Chinese who died with COVID is similar to the west on a per-capita basis. BUT they probably avoided many deaths by avoiding the deadly national lockdowns they simultaneously pushed on the world.
1306711638406561793 2020-09-18 05:48:26 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 I think NK has always been totalitarian, I think Xi has turned China back to totalitarianism, and I hear Eritrea is awful.  Other than that, every regime without free elections is authoritarian, but I can't think of any other totalitarian ones.  https://t.co/wQbnVu98tf
1306709011430080512 2020-09-18 05:38:00 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 In the long term, absolutely.  Taiwan did a great job, had a healthy distrust of the CCP's response, and conducted fewer tests so as to avoid CCP's game of COVID whack-a-mole.
1306708400307351554 2020-09-18 05:35:34 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 Yep that's right.  I think Westerners are used to authoritarian regimes, where people have different experiences and educations but you can generally trust them.  Few alive today have experience with totalitarian ones, which can compel almost everyone in them to lie systemically.
1306707223717044225 2020-09-18 05:30:54 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 @BenPhilliskirk @CarlaSpade @Francis_Hoar VT, TWN, Japan, and SK had useful SARS experience , but mostly they tested less so had fewer "cases."  Each did fewer than 15% as many tests per capita as US.  https://t.co/oJ88QvvQXp  NZ and AUS are islands that can shut virus out temporarily, but this will ultimately be futile.
1306704122729713664 2020-09-18 05:18:34 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Bhoddhisattva @Francis_Hoar Agree in principle, except someone has to actually gather the evidence for it to ever be "truly compelling."  It doesn't just show up on a silver platter, especially with ambitious, totalitarian regimes.  Would've been nice if someone had listened to these ones a bit sooner.  https://t.co/D7Z4O2W2lj

What CCP really did is stop counting and opt for herd immunity in most of China. But they insisted to the world lockdown worked.  https://t.co/y2hboBbrDN

These are minor celebrities who probably don't have much money.  Also, since these tweets are from March, they probably didn't realize they were being used to drive lockdowns.
1306631020784103426 2020-09-18 00:28:06 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @GCarty80 Best explanation I've seen is that he has a messianic view of himself, and western "freedom" interferes with his mission.  He's also very gullible, believing China really eliminated COVID.  Lastly, CCP doesn't just manipulate with money‚Äîthey likely flatter and cajole Gates.

That's fascinating they reported the quarantined cases in English on January 1.. more than two weeks before WHO finally confirmed human-to-human transmission..

It's increasingly clear that China has become a belligerent totalitarian country.  Many prominent China experts agree.  I think the CCP needs to be held accountable and a full decoupling is in order.
1306331731654594560 2020-09-17 04:38:49 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @JanieHsieh Yep, Gates is in deep.

1306303933518929926 2020-09-17 02:48:22 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @LoelleF @Za_Pashtun Exactly.  Xi Jinping personally authorized lockdowns, and there's no indication he ever really meant for them to end.  I think he'd much prefer they went on forever.  https://t.co/9v5ij9evcK

1306294956299104257 2020-09-17 02:12:42 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> While intelligence agencies spent months investigating COVID's origins, the world imposed "lockdowns" modeled on those in China, causing a Depression-level collapse, widespread hunger, and countless bankruptcies.  This is how Beijing shut down the world.  https://t.co/VdC2DkDckG
1306294460142227457 2020-09-17 02:10:43 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> As one lead scientist wrote: "Xi's persistent refusal to allow an independent international investigation into the origins of the virus is more than a lack of responsibility, it is a declaration of contempt for human life."

The "possibly lab-made virus" narrative was crucial in shutting down the world for so long.  She might represent Beijing's last ditch effort to keep the fear going.

Far more realistic they're being manipulated by someone a lot smarter, like Xi.  But no question there are some corrupt individuals across the world.
1304849033345761280 2020-09-13 02:27:07 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Nateoooo @nytimes @paulmozur No, lockdowns were designed based on Xi Jinping's philosophy of 'fangkong,' the same hybrid of health and security policy that inspired the mass 'quarantine' of over one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang. There's no indication they were ever meant to save lives.  https://t.co/YxDMX2x3vY
1304798132505583616 2020-09-12 23:04:51 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @diana_west_ Yep.  Fauci is a hero in Chinese state media now.  Tells you everything you need to know..  https://t.co/8i9LvSFMVm
1304653542586806274 2020-09-12 13:30:18 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @CarloFabio1 Such a disaster.  Sounds like it was primarily the CCP's idea then.
1304554053335166976 2020-09-12 06:54:58 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Tzompantli5 Absolutely.  Conte long advocated closer ties with CN and was the first big EU leader to sign onto Xi's Belt &amp; Road.  Chinese "experts" advised stricter lockdown in Italy multiple times.  Conte may just be gullible instead of corrupt, but he's borderline.  https://t.co/tPcB2NeWot
1304504779637481478 2020-09-12 03:39:10 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @lyn_templeman Yep, strongly considered Ardern.  She's borderline.  She signed onto Xi's Belt &amp; Road, but I think she's mostly pro-lockdown because she really believes it.  I don't think there's quite evidence she's sold out to CCP to the extent of someone like Andrews, but I could be wrong.

Imran Khan remains the only world leader to personally apologize to the poor for lockdowns, for which he deserves great credit.  But in the same thread, he praises China, apparently so Xi would let him off the hook.  https://t.co/DBodA7t7aW

1304191061942771712 2020-09-11 06:52:34 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> I foresee a big pivot soon where media stop pretending leaders locked down too little, and start insisting they "ignored intelligence and locked down too much."  "We're shocked, SHOCKED to learn Xi Jinping personally designed lockdowns!!"  (A fact @nytimes reported on Feb 15..)
1304188081482936320 2020-09-11 06:40:43 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @julie_kelly2 @JordanSchachtel Exactly.    I'm waiting for the big pivot when Dems stop blaming Trump for locking down too little, and start blaming him for "ignoring the intelligence and locking down too much."  It's coming, I can guarantee the cleverest liars in the media are already planning for it.

1304178701509242880 2020-09-11 06:03:27 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Xi's success in advertising Great-Leap-Forward-style collectivization as legitimate public health policy is really one for the history books.
1304169920385740802 2020-09-11 05:28:33 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> Doesn't mention CCP, but Ms. Keller is spot-on as to the importance of this in the 21st century.  Even small autocracies are getting worryingly good at abusing and bullying media platforms, seeing it pay off for others.  Strong, transparent, democratic rules are needed.

The smoking gun is the state-sponsored activity surrounding the tweet by manisha_kataki mentioned at the end of the article.  It‚Äôs not self-promotion, they explicitly encourage global lockdowns.  Click below for examples.  https://t.co/lFbOx57amb
1304032683824230401 2020-09-10 20:23:14 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @freedom2020uk Agree.  A few others have pointed out that if you stop and think about it, this is the most incriminating piece of the whole puzzle.  Here‚Äôs China‚Äôs official spokeswoman openly coercing this little girl to shame other governments for not obeying lockdowns.  It‚Äôs very North Korea.
1303846517971836928 2020-09-10 08:03:28 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @Is2020_OverYet @JordanSchachtel @Tony__Heller @jeffreyatucker @SharylAttkisson @AJKayWriter Absolutely.  The genius of CCP's campaign for hysteria and lockdowns is that it only took a few corrupt officials to get the ball rolling.  Since March, 99% of COVID hysteria has been people who jumped on board in their own shallowness, groupthink, and self-interested purposes.
1303822786813661187 2020-09-10 06:29:10 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 2/2  But what's really interesting is the way CCP has used the ambiguity of the virus's origins to its own advantage.  They deny it came from their lab, but simultaneously stoke that same rumor, knowing it makes the virus sound all the more scary, encouraging panic and lockdowns.
1303822110742188033 2020-09-10 06:26:29 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> 1/2  Absolutely. Glad to see Alex addressing this.

1303443103915872256 2020-09-09 05:20:27 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> I've long wondered about this deadly early COVID guidance‚Äîdelaying cancer treatments and putting patients on ventilators to protect staff.  Where did this guidance come from?    And how did Tik-Tok, a CCP-affiliated app most adults never heard of, become so popular with nurses?
1303418328858472449 2020-09-09 03:42:00 +0800 <MichaelPSenger> @EmilyPetro22 @JordanSchachtel Yep.  If what happened in Europe after WWII is any indication, as years go by lockdown supporters will literally start pretending they were us, regaling future generations with stories of how they courageously stood against lockdowns.

Xi is serious about trying to take Taiwan by force, and I think he wanted to do it during the pandemic, but allied forces wouldn't let him.  Xi could still strike anytime though.

Clearly they care at all how much harm they do to the world's poor.  I think they see India as a major regional rival they could cripple.  They were probably hoping to take the Gulwan valley as well.
