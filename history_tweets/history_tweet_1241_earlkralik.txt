A carbon offset is about $0.01  for 1000g. Gmail prob. has a much higher economy of scale.

Still, the main group feels like a lot of people when you're in the middle of it! When the event ends it's rivers of people moving up the streets.

1319077757113028608 2020-10-22 08:46:59 +0800 <earlkralik> @SimoneKolysh @SwipeWright Exactly. Black people are not a monolith and white people are not a monolith, something that Critical Race Theory explicitly disputes.

According the Bureau of Justice, in 2015 there were 53,469,300 interactions with police in the US. Of those interactions, 1104 involved lethal force (and most of which were justifiable). That's a 0.002% fatality rate, or 1 in 48,432 interactions.

1317556624316399619 2020-10-18 04:02:32 +0800 <earlkralik> @IsItTimeForA @emnode As far as I know the public system is mostly free of Critical Race Theory, but with CRT-indoctrinated teachers graduating from the Ed schools each year, how long can that last?
1317556190373728261 2020-10-18 04:00:49 +0800 <earlkralik> It's a huge problem in Canadian private schools too. If parents don't start getting prepared to push back against it, it won't be long before it's in the public system.
1317552337825746944 2020-10-18 03:45:30 +0800 <earlkralik> @emnode @ABKinSTL I agree. Not only must you be an activist, not only must you "acknowledge your privilege" - a heavy subject for an innocent 11-year-old, but you must step aside. If you have the wrong skin colour and you don't do these things, then you're a racist.
1317550956687560704 2020-10-18 03:40:01 +0800 <earlkralik> @emnode @ABKinSTL *Imagine asking a child.  Ugh. I could re-read my tweets 1,000 times but I'll still not notice a typo until I post!

1317545972801687553 2020-10-18 03:20:13 +0800 <earlkralik> @emnode @ABKinSTL It's from a private school in Canada. It was presented this year to a class of 11-year-olds (grade six). I don't want to get into too many more details publicly for now. But you'll have to take my word for it.

"Trauma is defined by the person experiencing it" is such an outrageous assertion, unfortunately it seems that every new teacher graduate of Ed schools are indoctrinated to believe it.

1316794978346164236 2020-10-16 01:36:02 +0800 <earlkralik> @Alananonymous3 @weijima01 The easier explanation for why there are sex disparities in participation in programming communities is a simple lack of interest on the part of most women. There may be a similar lack of interest from women in chess. Not all, obviously,  but enough to matter at the extremes.
1316794235157446657 2020-10-16 01:33:05 +0800 <earlkralik> @Alananonymous3 @weijima01 It reminds me of arguments made by some women against programming communities - groups of people who organize  via online forums and a set of tools open to anybody. Somehow these free and open communities dissuade women from joining, even though a user‚Äôs sex isn‚Äôt always known.

The new social justice definition seems to mean "anything that could be imagined to lead to group disparities."
1311763345851265024 2020-10-02 04:22:07 +0800 <earlkralik> Trudeau's response to COVID-19 was more pathetic than Trump's. PPE was allowed to be raided by UF operatives. We were told that masks were ineffective. Border restrictions were late and weak. Flights from China were never banned.   CDN media has not taken Trudeau to task for it.

1310768834362716161 2020-09-29 10:30:17 +0800 <earlkralik> Trump's Executive Order to kill CRT training in federal institutions is cause for hope, especially since it has given a name to the weird cult that most people couldn't quite identify. But if he loses the election, that will likely all be undone.
1310768436524482560 2020-09-29 10:28:42 +0800 <earlkralik> I don't think most people understand how serious the problem is. CRT won the war already, probably a few years ago.  Ordinary people are just waking up to this fact now. Our last defense is the legal system, which is also slowly being overtaken. Time is running out.
1310767367862050816 2020-09-29 10:24:28 +0800 <earlkralik> Online dictionaries have cravenly and quietly included the Critical Race Theory definition of racism along with the ordinary definition of racism.

1309260278249533441 2020-09-25 06:35:49 +0800 <earlkralik> @sandmanis33 @ConceptualJames Good question, and generally for public schools it's probably might not be possible to get any traction due to sovereign immunity laws in the US. Private schools are another matter.

1309252594871799808 2020-09-25 06:05:18 +0800 <earlkralik> @CosmicD @MrmuddT @ConceptualJames They say that the white dude has a dimension of privilege over the black politician, so for example perhaps the white dude gets hassled less by cops, or he gets taken more seriously, or he's better off in job interviews. Not just unprovable but totally laughable.

They're the ones who tell little kids to "step aside" and that their "intentions don't matter" because of something they have no control over.

We all have to divide our time according to our priorities. Most people are telling the truth when they say they aren't racist. They have the right to make that declaration. To require activism as proof is coercive and absurd.

1308804442217746433 2020-09-24 00:24:30 +0800 <earlkralik> @Bigg33D @sarembear @jasonrantz There's no evidence that his intention was to kill and he claims he was there to defend a business from the mob. He might be lying about that, but the fact remains that he only aimed and fired gun when he was attacked.

Humiliating children and permanently raising skin colour in their consciousness hectoring them to become activists is aopparently in benefit of "pluralism."

The head of my daughter's school said that the anti-racist instruction was to fulfill the school's mandate for "pluralism." All my arguments about the racist nature of the material went in one ear and out the other.
1308619393249599490 2020-09-23 12:09:10 +0800 <earlkralik> @ConceptualJames It's already in my daughter's private school here in Canada. In Drama class. These sneaky fuckers.

It's the very essence of prejudice pretending to be "anti-racist."

My favorite was when someone complained that Bitcoin was a boy's club that discouraged women from joining, even though literally anyone could read the white paper and participate in the forums.

1301962179080605696 2020-09-05 03:15:47 +0800 <earlkralik> @francispouliot_ The mass immigration firehose might be what's preventing collapse. There are construction cranes everywhere, now even in smaller cities.
1301960935624540165 2020-09-05 03:10:50 +0800 <earlkralik> @LDBildy @PsychRabble This is what happens when our education system fails to teach children the miracle of a modern democratic capitalist society, how unlikely it was to arise, and the amount of blood that paid for it.
1301960435349028864 2020-09-05 03:08:51 +0800 <earlkralik> @LDBildy "Leaving renters with nothing"  Maintenance-free and risk-free shelter is apparently nothing.
1301954587243483136 2020-09-05 02:45:37 +0800 <earlkralik> @a_centrism As my wife puts it, "if he's taking care of security and the economy, pussy grabbing and prostitutes and dumb speeches mean nothing." She escaped communist Czechoslovakia so she has a different perspective on what really matters.
1301953121674035200 2020-09-05 02:39:47 +0800 <earlkralik> @a_centrism That's how I see it. Obama's administration was business as usual from a domestic and (quite bloody) foreign policy perspective - all the things a good Liberal hates. But he's charming and nice so no problem. That makes up for the droning of wedding parties.

1301902607204732928 2020-09-04 23:19:04 +0800 <earlkralik> @neontaster The story doesn‚Äôt sound plausible at all. And the media has written so many lies and distortions about Trump‚Äôs behaviour that it‚Äôs incredible to me that anyone would take a story like this seriously without hard evidence.
1301894956739694598 2020-09-04 22:48:40 +0800 <earlkralik> @InayaFolarin Not so long ago, the general public understood ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù to refer to the KKK marching in white robes and burning crosses on lawns, and overt white nationalism.  The Critical re-definition seems to mean ‚Äúthings about society that annoy Critical Social Justice adherents.‚Äù
1301892322133770241 2020-09-04 22:38:12 +0800 <earlkralik> @TLNewmanMTL @SwipeWright Exactly. This is why I think the taboo around transracialism will soon crumble. The incentives are enormous.

1301746635236691968 2020-09-04 12:59:17 +0800 <earlkralik> @ACLU How do you know that we was shot because of racism?

1301538201925046272 2020-09-03 23:11:03 +0800 <earlkralik> @CitizenCohn Why is it about Democracy? How does another Trump term disrupt democracy? I remember the same hyperbolic fears about a second term for Bush Jr. USA has lasted for 244 years because of its strong constitution and separation of powers. One goofy president doesn‚Äôt change that.

1301531292807376897 2020-09-03 22:43:36 +0800 <earlkralik> @BlanchardPhD Wikipedia is dominated by woke trans editors. Nothing uncomfortable for them will be tolerated.

The entire building of crazed white supremacist cops will empty out and hog tie you in an impromptu rodeo shouting lots of yeehaws. You‚Äôll then be disappeared. John A. Macdonald wanted it that way.
1301405919419473922 2020-09-03 14:25:24 +0800 <earlkralik> @minsooklee Oh yeah, Canada with its world-famous racist police violence. Thanks for standing up for the real issues, scholars. Take all the time you need for your strike.

1301351438812155904 2020-09-03 10:48:55 +0800 <earlkralik> @bjportraits Just like for trans women, trans men seem to seek the essence of maleness by exaggerating stereotypes. But most men aren't smooth chested muscleheads, and most women aren't dressed like strippers. All I see are people who've mutilated their bodies in pursuit of a false ideal.
1301349174399639552 2020-09-03 10:39:55 +0800 <earlkralik> @Huawei Yeah but you answer to the Chinese Communist Party so we can't trust you.
