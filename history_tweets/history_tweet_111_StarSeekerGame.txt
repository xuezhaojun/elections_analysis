1331012570803744769 2020-11-24 07:11:40 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> (It's true! I used to work for Jackbox! They're a bunch of extremely funny people, and I like to think some of that rubbed off on Star Seeker.)
1329243412558716928 2020-11-19 10:01:40 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Sorry I missed the stream, but I just caught the vod, and I'm glad you enjoyed it! Loved the voice you did for Leo.
1327720733292826624 2020-11-15 05:11:05 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> @cherry_lozenges asked an important question on stream: Does Star know about llamas? If they saw a llama, would they have a mental breakdown??  https://t.co/5sTz48v1Qk
1327282588105445376 2020-11-14 00:10:03 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> @RedMartyrEnt @SaintKotar Thanks for hosting #AdventureGameFriday ! Last week we released Star Seeker in: the Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff, a short murder mystery featuring dead wizards, alive wizards, and a goat who's clearly the culprit (trust me on this one!)  Available now:  https://t.co/FMLsS3PLuN  https://t.co/VYGFE3mYjF
1325206263551066115 2020-11-08 06:39:29 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Star Seeker in: the Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff is out now- which means YOU TOO can claim that the goat is the explanation for every last aspect of the crime!  https://t.co/7apVkV3kNN  https://t.co/8xlkJpfv24  https://t.co/NklQgjEMZQ
1325104594414956544 2020-11-07 23:55:29 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Yep- Star Seeker is available on Linux (though only on Itch,  https://t.co/8xlkJoXUaw , since I couldn't work out how to get Steam to launch it when it can't automatically allow the L√ñVE AppImage to run as a program. Any Linux devs who know a workaround, hit me up!)
1324558962214227970 2020-11-06 11:47:20 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Thanks for streaming! It's really gratifying as a dev to actually see someone enjoying what I made.
1324377991015768065 2020-11-05 23:48:13 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> One thing they don't tell you about releasing a game is that you get inundated with scam emails pretending to be streamers asking for free Steam keys to resell.  (It's easy for me to tell because only a robot types out a title as long as ours multiple times in a single email.)
1324104716066967552 2020-11-05 05:42:19 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Aaaaaa, I love this! Thank you!
1324093290652880900 2020-11-05 04:56:55 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Not *too* familiar, I should hope.
1324035624614191104 2020-11-05 01:07:46 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Thanks! Glad you enjoyed it!

1323429358841876480 2020-11-03 08:58:41 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> (Leo, of course, defends tCoM because it's octarine and he is octagon man and he has a brand of his own to uphold.)

1323025900452093952 2020-11-02 06:15:29 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> The game's out on Wednesday (that's in three days! Aaaa!), so let's do another round of this before you can play to find out for sure! Reply to this tweet with your theories and I'll respond with a gif of Star making your guess in the game!
1322586611683598336 2020-11-01 01:09:55 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Happy Halloween! Star would love to be celebrating, but all of their most spooky magics are illegal. Also all the rest of their magics. #screenshotsaturday #indiedev  https://t.co/FMLsS3PLuN  https://t.co/1SRSeKZHFg
1322184555554590721 2020-10-30 22:32:17 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> @stuckinattic Thanks for hosting #AdventureGameFriday ! We're making Star Seeker in: the Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff, a one-room murder mystery with wizards. It's not quite as spooky as Gibbous, but only because the detective is a huge party pooper. (Coming Nov 4:  https://t.co/FMLsS3PLuN)  https://t.co/M92Ve65AuG
1321809258313322496 2020-10-29 21:40:59 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> We were featured in @NerdPirates ' Hallow-Zine!  https://t.co/I4V6jCWc1Z There's also a bunch of other #indiegames featured- consider me sold on @ArrogantPixel 's The Tale of Doris and the Dragon- love me some Douglas-Adams-esque afterlife bureaucracy.  https://t.co/sLJJ8bZoZ5
1321514979498053638 2020-10-29 02:11:38 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> In fairness to Star, it's 2020 and time is an illusion even *without* the help of magic spells.  (Wishlist now!:  https://t.co/FMLsS3PLuN)  https://t.co/U2z5zBQBjA
1321106777728012293 2020-10-27 23:09:35 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Oh, awesome! Looking forward to it!
1320797506607960068 2020-10-27 02:40:39 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> S5 is set a little bit before the advent of this world's Information Age (think, like, the fantasy '70s), so our wizard protagonist is a little bit unclear on what exactly a computers is. #indiegamedev #youwouldntdownloadastatue  https://t.co/lLU5Hv5nig
1320106368850939912 2020-10-25 04:54:19 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> #screenshotsaturday oh, it was hay thieves! mystery solved; i'm convinced  https://t.co/uTm9noRxJv
1319675240138612736 2020-10-24 00:21:10 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> @LanternStudio_ thanks for hosting #adventuregamefriday! LUNA looks amazing!  We're making Star Seeker in: the Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff, a short magical murder mystery coming to Steam and itch Nov 4!  https://t.co/FMLsS3PLuN  https://t.co/lsxgJ5mrfy
1319317172951318531 2020-10-23 00:38:20 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> In a really early version of the game, the protagonist was *this* kid, whose thing was constantly speaking in old-timey detective slang. I realized pretty quick that a) there's only so much old-timey detective slang and I was running out fast, and b) what if a wizard, though  https://t.co/vmQKCJqQfY
1318967882454355973 2020-10-22 01:30:23 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Magic is illegal, and yet at some point this asset appears in the game! That's not supposed to be allowed. Clearly something has gone off the rails here. #indiedev #screenshots  https://t.co/Fl7QQwcUC7
1318303184088158209 2020-10-20 05:29:06 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> The goat may be mega spish, but you know who else is suspicious? The forensics lady! What kind of sicko needs a microscope that big?

1317265949779689475 2020-10-17 08:47:30 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> @PolyTreehouse Thanks for hosting #AdventureGameFriday ! We're making Star Seeker in: the Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff, a short wizardous murder mystery coming Nov 4th to Steam and  https://t.co/VSBb1siZFE. ...Wizardous? Wizardy? Wizardish? There's wizards, is the thing.  https://t.co/rPJpM6xByN
1316782042739290113 2020-10-16 00:44:38 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> (Releasing on Linux via Steam is probably not going to happen what with not being able to authorize an AppImage to run as a program via Steam's launcher- plus a few other technical difficulties I'm not quite up to. But then, most Linux users aren't huge fans of Steam anyway...)
1316781458858692608 2020-10-16 00:42:19 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Updated our free demo ( https://t.co/FMLsS3PLuN on Steam,  https://t.co/bIrTidqs2o on Itch) with a couple control fixes and typo corrections. Plus we're officially supporting Linux on the  https://t.co/VSBb1siZFE version!  https://t.co/Rs7ygNguRB
1316379039423238144 2020-10-14 22:03:14 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> It's always hard working in tech support. Or, uh, magic support.  https://t.co/aHqyw06qwL
1315442558173052929 2020-10-12 08:02:00 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> What's the point of having magic pockets if magic is illegal and you can't brag about them to your boss?  (Wishlist and play this free demo on Steam now!  https://t.co/FMLsS3PLuN)  https://t.co/OJGPHmUYzo

1313816690099134468 2020-10-07 20:21:23 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> We're excited to announce Star Seeker in: the Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff, a one-room murder mystery adventure coming Nov 4th! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Check out the trailer below voiced by the fantastic @JustinMcElroy and play the free prologue over on our Steam page:  https://t.co/890PRdsZKM  https://t.co/fC5tzslqi4
1313612698828103684 2020-10-07 06:50:47 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> official announcement is tomorrow, along with the trailer, and i still can't believe the voiceover get we got to narrate that bad boy. i hear one time he *almost* got away with stealing a copy of fight club from blockbusters, so you know he's a major talent  https://t.co/X2QgWu5ouW
1313200133849452548 2020-10-06 03:31:24 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Found this old gif of a super early build of the game when I was still working out the UI and animation system. I... don't know what that orange... bird-face... blob is supposed to be. #indiedev  https://t.co/3Q7T9SmNT7
1312899656058372099 2020-10-05 07:37:25 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> THE TRUTH CANNOT HIDE!!  (You can play this free demo now over on our discord!  https://t.co/zPnucOKL6q) #indiegamedev  https://t.co/aG7vUXXAjB
1312585993837576194 2020-10-04 10:51:02 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Star understands what's important in life.  (You can play this free demo now over on our discord!  https://t.co/zPnucOKL6q) #indiegamedev  https://t.co/KqsFELqbiM
1312187841145790464 2020-10-03 08:28:55 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Haha, thanks! I... actually don't think that system does anything in the demo, because there's only one person to talk to and he doesn't refer to Star in the third person- but it does do the thing in the full game! Just, woulda been harder to take out than leave in.
1311698708921118720 2020-10-02 00:05:17 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Another preview of @MaxieSatan's soundtrack- this track plays when things get uncharacteristically serious and dramatic accusations start flying.   https://t.co/z3TVBCeubg
1311281973739094018 2020-09-30 20:29:19 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Wondering where a wizard loses their keys? You can check out the demo early right now by heading over to our Discord ( https://t.co/ymYtxaviyf)! Oh dang!
1310930660274642945 2020-09-29 21:13:19 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> (Psst- ahead of the official release of the demo, I'll be dropping an early release of the demo in our Discord tomorrow!

1310692609405472773 2020-09-29 05:27:24 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> The fantasy setting of S5 hews pretty close to 70s-80s Earth (plus MAGIC), just to keep things familiar and avoid confusing the mystery, but I did write a bunch of worldbuilding notes over on my Tumblr if anyone's interested:  https://t.co/hsE4V4kZBl
1310047923011555329 2020-09-27 10:45:39 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Gotta cover all the bases. (I mean, optionally. You don't *gotta* cover all the bases. You only *gotta* cover the correct bases, but you can totally cover all the bases too.)  https://t.co/Z92l7cLRoN
1309171877026430976 2020-09-25 00:44:33 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Found this old page of design sketches for the goat. I, uh... it, um. It wasn't. Good. At first. It was sort of more a pile of nightmares at first.  https://t.co/iMIOYFA40a
1308764267844378624 2020-09-23 21:44:51 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> "Fun" things: going through a whole new round of QA because Apple changed their security standards and the old version of L√ñVE I made the game with doesn't meet them and so I needed to update the whole game to 11.2, which broke... a lotta stuff. sigh sigh sigh sigh #indiedevwoes
1308423179665379333 2020-09-22 23:09:30 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> (Reminder to check your fridge to make sure nothing's gone past its date.)  https://t.co/tcXPv0FUcr
1308209490085457922 2020-09-22 09:00:22 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Wizards are real, and can be involved in murder cases... but not vampires. Those are fake. Right? Yes? Probably? I'm gonna go with probably.   #indiedev #VampiresAreFakeProbably  https://t.co/Tsgc3XvWaI
1307442507580616705 2020-09-20 06:12:39 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Dex (of Terrene Spire and Mycelium Roots over at  https://t.co/u9JLHN7EOn) drew this Star! how does my game have fanart before it's even out......  https://t.co/7dc24P4d8G
1306960201145344002 2020-09-18 22:16:08 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Thanks for hosting #AdventureGameFriday! Hauma looks super stylish.  Meanwhile, Star Seeker is not a mature *anything*. There is an aged murder investigation (murder investigation involving an aged person), though! Aaand wizards.  https://t.co/ZlhlaBW3QF
1306731968600604678 2020-09-18 07:09:13 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Star's "Control Perceptions" spell (AKA the pronoun selection menu) works by magically planting a suggestion that the subject assumes applies when there's ambiguity. So... the goat gets caught up in it, too. Whoops.  https://t.co/M6YNLuD6Gi
1306286427005747200 2020-09-17 01:38:48 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> #indiedev #indiegamedev  https://t.co/bL9PL8ORp8
1305945763780886530 2020-09-16 03:05:08 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> I just played a few hours of this and it is *bananas* cool. Not afraid to do its own thing and get wild with the worldbuilding, but it's still got solid mystery fundamentals. (also one of the suspects is named Doctor Doom Jazz and he is the *best*.)
1305618301209456643 2020-09-15 05:23:54 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> (i actually really wanted to use Justice/Arcana (courtesy of @avunvain) because it's both snappy and descriptive, but the tarot aspect totally didn't apply, so it was kind of a single entendre. might use that one for a bigger sequel- work in the theme from the start)
1305617803462897664 2020-09-15 05:21:56 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Highlights from the brainstorming session when we finally named it: * Snitchcraft * Death and Hexes * Starcross Examination * Ex-Conjurer * Lawmaturgy * Justice/Arcana
1305617206487678977 2020-09-15 05:19:33 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Fun fact: for like a year, S5 did not have a name. I was just referring to it as "Unnamed Illegal Wizards Game" right up until I was completely done writing it (and at one point considered shipping with it)- and then Untitled Goose Game came along and beat me to the punch.
1305333854056648705 2020-09-14 10:33:37 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Finishing up the demo opening cutscene. The crime took place early in the morning, and wizards don't appreciate being woken up in the middle of the night.  https://t.co/s8WA45c1Zi
1304556791267721219 2020-09-12 07:05:51 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> (oh also i posted a music preview super late last night, check that out if you haven't)
1304556680613683201 2020-09-12 07:05:24 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Oh my god I love this and I'm going to play it like no tomorrow. Thanks for hosting #AdventureGameFriday !  We're making Star Seeker in: The Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff, which is also a buddy cop mystery/comedy adventure game thing (but with tragically fewer chickens!)  https://t.co/FmZpnLhD4j
1304264638419415040 2020-09-11 11:44:56 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Here's a little preview of the game's music, composed by @MaxieSatan - Star's theme Magic Square!  https://t.co/lVHy1KuFU3   #indiedev #indiegamemusic
1303740807845904391 2020-09-10 01:03:25 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Early in development, we were going to use a more hand-painted style, but then Zero was like "okay but I wanna do pixelart tho" and so we did pixelart tho. I... do not remember why we had a bucket in the scene back then.  https://t.co/Ltd1JgoaZe
1303391534973440001 2020-09-09 01:55:32 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Kinda roundabout quality of life thing: You can hit X on the evidence in Lightningbolt Mind to turn it on and off, if you think you're done with it and don't want to be always scrolling past it when you're answering questions.  https://t.co/wUVcjp3n8Y
1303025266097303553 2020-09-08 01:40:07 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> melissa was like "star seeker gives me serotonin" and star was like  https://t.co/NOCod7nFce
1302690329959845888 2020-09-07 03:29:12 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> ...Wait, does twitter, like, automatically cut off duplicate still frames at the end of gifs when it processes them? Is that what's been happening?

We're making Star Seeker in: the Secret of the Sorcerous Standoff, a point-and-click murder mystery about solving wizard crime. Here's a gif from the free demo I'm working on:  https://t.co/SAUNNP9EIJ
1301608574758588416 2020-09-04 03:50:41 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> The city S5 takes place in has some unique architecture- when wizardly criminals might summon giant rampaging demons at any moment, you don't want buildings toppling over. All the buildings have support braces (sometimes used as bridges) propping them up against each other.  https://t.co/cUezqcuxuf
1301236554959069184 2020-09-03 03:12:25 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> Star leaves no stone unturned in their quest for the truth! Except, uh. They're wrong and there's probably no time travel in this one. I wouldn't do that to you! (...Yet. No promises if I do a sequel.)  https://t.co/nUMxwzJlWC
1300823644592123910 2020-09-01 23:51:39 +0800 <StarSeekerGame> The background NPCs from the opening cutscene were designed by @davidoneacre! (I commissioned these sketches ages ago- he's done some seriously impressive stuff since then, go check out his work.)  https://t.co/coTYjnzVCC
