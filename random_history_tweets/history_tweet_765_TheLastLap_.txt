Trump is trying to replicate the pattern that won him the presidency: Foreign intervention, a timely dump of engineered data too late in the game to be investigated, and a last minute gross, gratuitous FBI interference played out by a Comey #2

The notion of people behaving well, motivated by the fear of God and His dantesque punishments is appalling, and has no redeeming value in my eyes.

Each could be expressed as a quantum state where both are true.  This is a disturbing direction where questionable minds would seek a quantum base for fake news and alternate truths.
1310274207041957889 2020-09-28 01:44:49 +0800 <TheLastLap_> @DrKlintPeebles @choo_ek Another perspective: The loss of substance started as soon as followers of Christ started making religions out of his utterances. Triaging who is right or wrong amongst Christian institutions, is akin to triaging a pile of pepper grains mixed with flecks of fly doodoo.

1300953886572806144 2020-09-02 08:29:11 +0800 <TheLastLap_> @UROCKlive1 The somber truth is that several BLM protesters can’t afford to throw away soup. If it comes down to throwing, rocks are much cheaper.
