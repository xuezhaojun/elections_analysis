1311435650839842818 2020-10-01 06:39:59 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @ChristopherJM @Acosta Trump "adviser."  Translation: an intern who got President Trump coffee once.
1311433250456457218 2020-10-01 06:30:26 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @SenSanders How many decades have you been a Senator?  Why haven't you fixed it?
1311358175958970369 2020-10-01 01:32:07 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Say what you want about President Trump.  He wasn't the one hurling insults and telling his opponent to shut up repeatedly last night.  #Debates2020  https://t.co/xo0srkX3h7
1311357727768285184 2020-10-01 01:30:20 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Why not? Biden thinks it's 2016 and he's running against Ronald Abraham Nixon with Corn Pop as his running mate anyway....  #Debates2020
1311357252847239169 2020-10-01 01:28:27 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @GKeile @iloveparis__ @Cernovich I think he did just fine considering. One misstep with the very fine people hoax but other than that he destroyed Biden.  Course, Cernovich is only pro-Trump when it suits him.

1311285604601208833 2020-09-30 20:43:45 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @johncardillo Jim misses the fact that Trump DID condemn white supremacists. When asked by Chris Biden if he condemned white supremacists he said yes absolutely.
1311129210791043072 2020-09-30 10:22:18 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth Wallace has spent most of the debate simping for Biden.  Luckily Trump hasn't let up one bit.

1311033155491594241 2020-09-30 04:00:36 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth Just guzzle one of those gallon jugs of store-brand vodka you find on the bottom shelf at the liquor store whenever Joementia calls Trump a lyin dog-faced pony soldier.  You'll be fine.

1310988920230948871 2020-09-30 01:04:50 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @JoshDenny @TulsiGabbard Still not convinced she's not just a radical who's learned to play the moderate game.   That being said I agree with her on a few things (ballot harvesting for example), and I do agree she'd be one to give Trump a run for his money.  Dems will never accept her though.
1310920932505124865 2020-09-29 20:34:40 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @kevindandy1 Paul Ryan and Trump are two very different people. Biden might try that schtick (if he can remember) but Trump won't give him a pass.

1302018295038701571 2020-09-05 06:58:46 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @johncardillo You'll never be able to convince me that Trump hasn't paid off Biden's campaign managers.
1302010618489319427 2020-09-05 06:28:16 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @GrrrGraphics In Joe's defense he was trying to remember who Joe Biden's husband was at the time...
1302010282902982658 2020-09-05 06:26:56 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth Everyone hated John McCain.  That man's the reason I left the Republican party in 08.  https://t.co/QlhoKtgy8v
1302009669196677120 2020-09-05 06:24:29 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Howard Dean is still alive?
1301994643211644935 2020-09-05 05:24:47 +0800 <trigwarnradio> That's my attitude at the end of every week tbh...
1301958101667643392 2020-09-05 02:59:35 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @BeachCity55 Replace "people" with "murdering Leftist scumbags."  https://t.co/09dIM01DeL
1301956222879440907 2020-09-05 02:52:07 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @killred40 Yeesh...high school AV club could've done better.
1301858478198317056 2020-09-04 20:23:43 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Ooh, an anonymous official confirms another anonymous official.  #FakeNewsMedia gonna fake.
1301699115554877440 2020-09-04 09:50:28 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Utter and complete garbage.  The only people who believe this are blinkered Leftists too stupid to know they're being lied to.

1301635127718670341 2020-09-04 05:36:12 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth Guarantee it was scripted.
1301555273128124416 2020-09-04 00:18:53 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth It's all fun and games until they're the ones woken up at 1 AM by an angry mob with guillotines made by @IKEAUSA.  https://t.co/zT9rcKxE3d
1301339337376890882 2020-09-03 10:00:50 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @tedwheeler Maybe you should try stopping the nightly riots?
1301268743599857665 2020-09-03 05:20:19 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Looks like Trump's October Surprise is going to be curing WuFlu.  Can't wait for the rage and spittle from the Left! #COVID19
1301224311802548227 2020-09-03 02:23:46 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth Anyone else think it's just a LITTLE too coincidental that Joementia has a press conference right after Joe Hiden trends on Twitter?
1301213285786755073 2020-09-03 01:39:57 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth We all know is fist question's probably going to be "why are you so awesome?"
1301210868856872960 2020-09-03 01:30:21 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Joe Hiden is quite possibly the greatest nickname President Trump has ever bestowed upon someone so deserving...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  https://t.co/wa0KQU6ljd
1301204991533887493 2020-09-03 01:06:59 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @JackPosobiec Movies would've been a hell of a lot better without Rey...
1301200063826362373 2020-09-03 00:47:25 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @johncardillo Damn, Joe Hiden' is even better than #CrookedHillary
1301194937212571648 2020-09-03 00:27:02 +0800 <trigwarnradio> The only smart play Joementia's able to make is having Corn Pop for breakfast.
1301192034901020673 2020-09-03 00:15:30 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @henrybowman33 @SBWheat1 At least he knows who Joe Biden's husband is...
1301190386136813568 2020-09-03 00:08:57 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth As a die-hard Trump supporter myself I admit I often find myself spontaneously screaming "FUCK TRUMP" and destroying the nearest statue while wearing a burning American flag on my head.
1301189984263774213 2020-09-03 00:07:21 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth I like how the announcement came literally the day after Trump visited Kenosha and met with residents.  It's obvious Trump forced his hand, but the narrative is "BUT BIDEN WAS ALWAYS PLANNING TO GO, HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHEN!!!"  Riiiight...  https://t.co/uBNF0DN5hj
1301186463732822017 2020-09-02 23:53:22 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @SBWheat1 Riiiiight...  https://t.co/E1NnbH9yIj
1301184635578261506 2020-09-02 23:46:06 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Joe and Jill Biden are traveling to Kenosha TWO DAYS after President Trump went there and met with residents.  Someone's running scared...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1301175495770484738 2020-09-02 23:09:47 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @kirstiealley Come to FL. No lockdown, just hot as hell!  Also, watch out for meth gators...  https://t.co/NfokYQTuok
1301142632798842880 2020-09-02 20:59:12 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @ScottAdamsSays "Willingness to listen to experts" in this case translates as "willing to listen to the people who want to advance our narrative."

1300954942828679169 2020-09-02 08:33:23 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Animal Crossing signs are no substitute for getting out there and actually meeting voters.  Lookin at you Joementia...  https://t.co/4x7hmE4OBX
1300953237235871747 2020-09-02 08:26:36 +0800 <trigwarnradio> Great job, Twitter, you've locked the account of the one man who just happens to be a conservative activist lawyer whose favorite past time is going after Leftist companies like a rabid attack dog.  Well done....  #LinWood  https://t.co/rCNGgjwNkV
1300946068948029441 2020-09-02 07:58:07 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @JackPosobiec It is?  https://t.co/QqFjHBviFZ

1300882917732777985 2020-09-02 03:47:11 +0800 <trigwarnradio> You'll never convince me that Trump hasn't infiltrated the DNC, convinced Joementia to run, and had him hire his people.  It's the only logical explanation.
1300818728670593026 2020-09-01 23:32:07 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth Joementia can't even handle reading a script from a teleprompter and y'all want him to answer UNSCRIPTED questions?  https://t.co/8r9ZUxkKYN
1300813468052881408 2020-09-01 23:11:13 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @KurtSchlichter Joementia isn't getting his money's worth. There's been almost no Hispanic outreach from him in FL which is mind bogglingly stupid...
1300793273217429506 2020-09-01 21:50:58 +0800 <trigwarnradio> @TimRunsHisMouth I'm just sittin here waiting for the inevitable "Oh my God, she killed herself, how shocking and surprising and not at all suspicious" press release from the prison.  https://t.co/d6ZguglVIQ
