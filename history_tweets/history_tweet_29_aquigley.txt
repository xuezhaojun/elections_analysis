1333917203196911619 2020-12-02 07:33:38 +0800 <aquigley> The session is going well! There is still time to join the rest of the conference. Up now we have Muhammad Adamu presenting on Software Project Work in an African Context: Myths, Maps and Messes #ozchi2020

1332906940876214272 2020-11-29 12:39:13 +0800 <aquigley> @chrispytweets @bradherbert Well my husband @bradherbert wasn‚Äôt so impressed with the wind and the heat so I‚Äôll have to wait for a slightly cooler day before asking him to go further afield on his bike.
1332906145523015686 2020-11-29 12:36:03 +0800 <aquigley> A nice ride by the beach on quite a windy day...  https://t.co/rqoicmsnEY

1332477374709997568 2020-11-28 08:12:17 +0800 <aquigley> @lorenterveen I‚Äôd like to reserve HOT for the 40+ days to make the 30+ days more tolerable.   In saying that, walking out just now was a bit of a shock to the system.

1332448121784131585 2020-11-28 06:16:02 +0800 <aquigley> I hoped there were more creators in the world and more imagination and discovery and open-mindedness for something new. ... but more people today simply want the final, finished thing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand they do not have much patience for the journey of a new technology  https://t.co/MgOTkXRPHX
1332447291056132097 2020-11-28 06:12:44 +0800 <aquigley> An excellent read. Rony Abovitz: The Tech Visionary Behind Magic¬†Leap - Founder Stories by Danielle Newnham  https://t.co/MgOTkXRPHX
1332442499084795904 2020-11-28 05:53:42 +0800 <aquigley> @jeffbigham @luiciolfi Yea that is very sad. Clinging to harm and not allowing yourself to heal is a good way to put it.   I understand family counselling sees this perplexing situation all the time, people staying in bad situations when it would be best to leave.
1332441370737328128 2020-11-28 05:49:13 +0800 <aquigley> @mjskay @jwkritchie I‚Äôve had that experience. I‚Äôve recorded train ticket machines and doors in Germany for class. Then we play ‚Äúwhat do I do next‚Äù in class.  Rarely have I had a student guess the correct next step. It‚Äôs quite educational for student and instructor!
1332440046511681538 2020-11-28 05:43:57 +0800 <aquigley> @mjskay @jwkritchie Make a recording for your next HCI, with permission of course :) (you can add the laugh track later)
1332439662724489217 2020-11-28 05:42:25 +0800 <aquigley> Coogee: our local life saving club redevelopment isn‚Äôt to everyone‚Äôs taste. Blending the old and the new, I like the inset framing of the window with clock.   https://t.co/uEYBjse1wJ  https://t.co/sjjHF78X9D
1332436470552948736 2020-11-28 05:29:44 +0800 <aquigley> @luiciolfi It‚Äôs quite sad, for everyone involved. I think of my American friends and family and I‚Äôm sure they are deeply disappointed in the way this is going.
1332232883843416065 2020-11-27 16:00:45 +0800 <aquigley> Thank you to our four panellists and  @tcboy88 and @jjorge for helping to organise this @SIGGRAPHAsia frontiers panel this week!  https://t.co/NvcWgUXNQQ and to @midget_mg for the invitation.  https://t.co/JoKKsXnwFR
1332142064104968192 2020-11-27 09:59:52 +0800 <aquigley> @sirpeto I‚Äôm on the mend now
1332142014608019457 2020-11-27 09:59:40 +0800 <aquigley> @IanSommerville @Glen_Dhu Thanks. Feeling on the mend today
1332041033694081025 2020-11-27 03:18:25 +0800 <aquigley> @gingdottwit @jeffbigham Much better today :) (so far at least)
1332040871626248192 2020-11-27 03:17:46 +0800 <aquigley> @gingdottwit @clifflampe @geri_fitz @lorenterveen I think they were baked with a sweet sauce.
1332040628767584257 2020-11-27 03:16:48 +0800 <aquigley> @gavinq68 Indeed! Must be more careful
1331906680930516992 2020-11-26 18:24:33 +0800 <aquigley> @benwerd Indeed it does
1331904655136210944 2020-11-26 18:16:30 +0800 <aquigley> @mobiquitousmark Ouch indeed ;)
1331904620281491457 2020-11-26 18:16:21 +0800 <aquigley> @chrispytweets Thanks!
1331845704856178695 2020-11-26 14:22:15 +0800 <aquigley> @landay Thanks.   Deep heat is helping now.   Continuing on as if nothing happened is not helping me.
1331837623229243394 2020-11-26 13:50:08 +0800 <aquigley> @AaronGenest Actually I‚Äôve been doing too much activity these days so I think I need to rest more to allow it time to heal.
1331822134004391936 2020-11-26 12:48:35 +0800 <aquigley> @abcnews This was an excellent book which I even bought @lorenterveen a copy of. This film bears little resemblance to the book beyond the list of characters.
1331821635968462852 2020-11-26 12:46:36 +0800 <aquigley> @jeffbigham Thank... my ego and chest are bruised too.
1331821572449976320 2020-11-26 12:46:21 +0800 <aquigley> @hilfeheiko Thanks... a painful lesson
1331821531219988481 2020-11-26 12:46:11 +0800 <aquigley> @Glen_Dhu I know... you I was being careful enough
1331821418728722433 2020-11-26 12:45:44 +0800 <aquigley> @10ismum I know... I cannot jump around like I‚Äôm 21 anymore
1331821339527639046 2020-11-26 12:45:26 +0800 <aquigley> @lindamrafferty Thanks... still quite sore
1331821271340838912 2020-11-26 12:45:09 +0800 <aquigley> @BryVeer Thanks... quite sore today :(
1331817154614751234 2020-11-26 12:28:48 +0800 <aquigley> @AaronGenest @jburnford Performance is in the eye of the beholder. I doubt I would still be following you here if I thought you had messed up :-)
1331816244991852545 2020-11-26 12:25:11 +0800 <aquigley> @AaronGenest @jburnford You did good job! I remember it well.
1331703629934338049 2020-11-26 04:57:41 +0800 <aquigley> @jeffbigham Me too. Slow so far.
1331700358624681984 2020-11-26 04:44:41 +0800 <aquigley> @jeffbigham Roof repair and I slipped :(
1331698130119581696 2020-11-26 04:35:50 +0800 <aquigley> Recovering from a cracked rib is very sore and very slow.
1331695047285248000 2020-11-26 04:23:35 +0800 <aquigley> @nuigalway @johnbreslin @SarahAnneBuckle @AnPostIBAS Congratulations!
1331512515340115970 2020-11-25 16:18:16 +0800 <aquigley> I‚Äôm looking forward to attending OzCHI 2020 next week. I‚Äôll be session chairing on the first day so it‚Äôs time to dig out my session chair guidance notes again, revised for an online event. ‚Å¶@ozchiconf‚Å©   https://t.co/vnxWDJVnkQ
1331507712635506689 2020-11-25 15:59:11 +0800 <aquigley> @flosalim Sounds good. I‚Äôm not sure when we will be face to face seminars here!
1331506090954039298 2020-11-25 15:52:44 +0800 <aquigley> @flosalim Yes, that‚Äôs already on the cards for Jan/Feb
1331506007210541061 2020-11-25 15:52:24 +0800 <aquigley> @CJAMcMahon Actually the place I want to go doesn‚Äôt have direct flights yet so I might be getting ahead of myself

1331382456776212482 2020-11-25 07:41:28 +0800 <aquigley> @oliverw @SIGGRAPHAsia Yes I hope so. @midget_mg
1330430280457461761 2020-11-22 16:37:51 +0800 <aquigley> Normal life here means, remote education at work, wearing masks on public transport, no travel outside of Australia, the ever present danger of cases exploding, job losses and people shying away from the essential care they might need.   Life is more normal here but it‚Äôs not nice
1330322051505131522 2020-11-22 09:27:47 +0800 <aquigley> @Scobleizer Someone just asked this very question for our @SIGGRAPHAsia panel this week  https://t.co/NvcWgUXNQQ

1329700702948524035 2020-11-20 16:18:46 +0800 <aquigley> Today we had a video farewell in my lecture. Lovely to see students. Not like in person but good to see their hardworking and happy faces.

My commute has dropped from 100mins to 6 on the bike :). Summer is around the corner so it‚Äôs warming up.

1314551644244209664 2020-10-09 21:01:49 +0800 <aquigley> @EllaTasm I‚Äôd never considered it as good (or bedding) before. Our plastic notes here might be less tasty.
1314540221116018688 2020-10-09 20:16:26 +0800 <aquigley> @jenna_rater We shall see but I think this year will make a long term change to the use of physical cash. I expect governments to produce less of it from here on.
1314539854043115520 2020-10-09 20:14:58 +0800 <aquigley> @XiangLi0929 @frankbolton Indeed. When I was in some markets in Beijing last year physical cash was refused.
1314527626849996801 2020-10-09 19:26:23 +0800 <aquigley> @romainmuller Yep.
1314504013136588800 2020-10-09 17:52:33 +0800 <aquigley> @EllaTasm The % of money in physical form is already tiny. I expect these days will reduce it further.
1314503840398340097 2020-10-09 17:51:52 +0800 <aquigley> @frankbolton There are lots of untraceable forms of digital currency. In China last year I went to markets with physical currency which I expect to be the norm shortly.
1314495856486215680 2020-10-09 17:20:08 +0800 <aquigley> Will this pandemic finally kill physical notes and coins?   Let‚Äôs hope so.   The amount of physical money I‚Äôve used since March is minimal (maybe 3 notes)  The charges merchants incur due to card use needs to reduce to near zero of course.
