1329124800661389312 2020-11-19 02:10:21 +0800 <Annekatz12> The big difference is the delivery system of refrigeration. Pfizer needs constant minus -80° degrees compared to Moderna which requires a constant minus -20° degrees. Also Pfizer only last 3 days after it is thawed.  Moderna last up to 30 days after it is thawed.
