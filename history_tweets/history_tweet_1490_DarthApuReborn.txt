1340665694178951171 2020-12-20 22:29:44 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 So, my point in asking about quality of people is not so much about their opinions, but about their will. This isn‚Äôt an uphill battle, it‚Äôs scaling a mountain with your bare hands. If people are giving up at the first summit, fuck em. They‚Äôre dead weight.
1340665301369823232 2020-12-20 22:28:10 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 Remember the Democratic primary debates? Candidates had to meet a fundraising threshold to get a podium. And in Tulsi Gabbard‚Äôs case, that didn‚Äôt even matter!
1340664953146138624 2020-12-20 22:26:47 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 Bit of a wrench in the topic, but here‚Äôs a red pill: it doesn‚Äôt matter ever since Citizens United. The donors ARE the will of the GOP.
1340663351127515140 2020-12-20 22:20:25 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 But I mean, couldn‚Äôt you make the same argument of the traditional GOP? They feel their only way forward is with a big tent coalition, and yet Nick Fuentes disagrees with this because it dilutes conservative politics. So, which is it?
1340662964622417921 2020-12-20 22:18:53 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 If I‚Äôm rapidly barreling towards death, yeah I wanna choose who I‚Äôm barreling with. üòÇ
1340662465282097152 2020-12-20 22:16:54 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @e_dissident If people are even curious about the JQ and have spent half a day on the internet, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre not gonna be scared off by Hitler memes.
1340661162757808129 2020-12-20 22:11:44 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 And if so, the next question is: were they quality people?
1340660772444237824 2020-12-20 22:10:11 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 Idk, I think we‚Äôre talking in circles. Have people complained that they were about to be on board with AF, but then some frog account posted the Sonnenrad and it was game over? Is this a real phenomenon?
1340659130713948160 2020-12-20 22:03:39 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 You‚Äôre asking people to artificially mask themselves after learning some really infuriating big truths, that everyone who ventures down more dissident politics eventually finds themselves.
1340658125796495365 2020-12-20 21:59:40 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 I don‚Äôt think over 90% of people have ever heard of Turner Diaries or 1488.
1340657972414967808 2020-12-20 21:59:03 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 Ok, but so what? At what point do we reclaim history? Do we just keep living that lie forever and ever until enough people eventually wiki early life and then we go mask off? I don‚Äôt get it.
1340657554343518211 2020-12-20 21:57:23 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 Who‚Äôs doing that?

1340653564629282818 2020-12-20 21:41:32 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @veggielord1 Ok, so you think normal people gravitate to Scientology? And aren‚Äôt aware of the weirdness embedded in it?

1339213639925035008 2020-12-16 22:19:47 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @SarahOwen_ Oh, so hostile invaders have attacked indigenous white European populations before, demolishing their cultures and identities? And you‚Äôre using that as an argument for more?

1338554910674202625 2020-12-15 02:42:14 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @fashygoy81 lmfao Thank you, based black man, very cool!
1338554697272217604 2020-12-15 02:41:23 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Told your asses
1338531824440578051 2020-12-15 01:10:30 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @HungryPupus From the start, all I saw were wild claims and speculation.
1338529525735583749 2020-12-15 01:01:22 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @fashygoy81 These guys don‚Äôt give AF. He‚Äôll just delete and pretend it never happened.
1338529384353894401 2020-12-15 01:00:48 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @ElTrustoPlano It‚Äôs the running wild with an unverified claim coming from one source, and using that to spin a much grander narrative.
1338528796014764032 2020-12-15 00:58:28 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @fashygoy81 Bro, this one hasn‚Äôt even had time to marinate yet. It‚Äôs. 20-minute old claim with no source.
1338527683987316736 2020-12-15 00:54:03 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> This shit is why I can‚Äôt get behind ‚Äúmassive voter fraud,‚Äù tbh.
1338524275247026184 2020-12-15 00:40:30 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Wow, what a passionate speaker! What‚Äôs he saying? My German is rusty.
1338516304710557697 2020-12-15 00:08:50 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @RBGstoleMy4skin @HungryPupus While his supporters were marching and getting beaten by commie thugs, his wife was in Florida touring private schools for Barron. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1338512539156705292 2020-12-14 23:53:52 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @RBGstoleMy4skin @HungryPupus They voted for it, in fact.
1338512139749875714 2020-12-14 23:52:17 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Actually, if you think about it, *Democrats* are the real racists.
1338510596996730882 2020-12-14 23:46:09 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @HungryPupus Once again, a case of ‚Äúsure, it happened, but it wasn‚Äôt 6 million‚Äù
1338510004496830467 2020-12-14 23:43:48 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @HungryPupus Ok. I disagree. I think there was some voter fraud, as there is in most elections, but not to the tune of 6 million ballots. That‚Äôs just me.
1338507117968445445 2020-12-14 23:32:19 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @HungryPupus Do you truly think that there was enough voter fraud in all these contested states to flip the election results?
1338502716432257024 2020-12-14 23:14:50 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @HungryPupus Or Josh Hawley? Or Ron DeSantis?
1338502459505991684 2020-12-14 23:13:49 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @HungryPupus And what about when Tucker Carlson does?
1338498471091957761 2020-12-14 22:57:58 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Is it great that normies are taking to the streets? Yes, but to what end? It‚Äôs all centered around Trump. They‚Äôre just going to vote for the next guy who throws Trumpian rhetoric their way in 2024.
1338497330916560896 2020-12-14 22:53:26 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> My mutuals aren‚Äôt gonna like this, but in terms of ‚Äúusefulness,‚Äù I really think the narrative of ‚ÄúTrump abandoned his base in a time of crisis and lost re-election‚Äù is stronger than ‚ÄúTrump and his rainbow working coalition actually won, but were robbed in like five states.‚Äù
1338494857417994242 2020-12-14 22:43:36 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @coof_cops @CuteGirIsDM The next step in the progression is realizing that you already were losing everything.

1338204016992514054 2020-12-14 03:27:54 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @fanciefiestie Whoa, are you allowed to say that?
1338200836611125253 2020-12-14 03:15:16 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @TysonConeIl @HungryPupus The country so weak and powerless, we have laws against boycotting them.
1338198831134101504 2020-12-14 03:07:18 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Yeah, my nana used to tell stories too.
1338196701409062913 2020-12-14 02:58:50 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @TysonConeIl @HungryPupus Why would you love to say it was a botched plan to set up Russia?  Also, do events over 50 years old have no bearing on our politics today?

1338125368205729792 2020-12-13 22:15:23 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @urbanartshop @ScottSurvival @naternot7 It‚Äôs not difficult. High voter turnout = democrat elected. This election had record turnout.
1338124180919902208 2020-12-13 22:10:40 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @TysonConeIl @HungryPupus It‚Äôs the rogue terrorist state that is allowed to have nuclear weapons and American cash, for me.
1338102991832944640 2020-12-13 20:46:28 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> These people think she‚Äôs just naturally popular and the center of attention.  Plenty of people more charismatic than her have actually bucked the system. There‚Äôs a reason you never hear about them.
1338102354202284032 2020-12-13 20:43:56 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> &gt;what is motivating her corruption? She doesn‚Äôt take corporate money!  Fame. The answer is fame.

1337871420567793664 2020-12-13 05:26:17 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Men are selfish monsters for wanting women to not kill their own children, apparently.

1337407495913033728 2020-12-11 22:42:49 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Libtards always write these spicy takes about how ‚Äúboring‚Äù white culture is.  Try living in sub Saharan Africa, where traveling from point A to point B requires DAYS due to lack of infrastructure.  Africans don‚Äôt have the luxury of being bored by their own culture.

1330236715563429892 2020-11-22 03:48:42 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Because I know that my family had at least a small part in creating my country, and I‚Äôm excited to continue their legacy for the sake of future generations.

1329137874260922375 2020-11-19 03:02:18 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @Caesars_Scion Hard to say. A big reason why it‚Äôs so hard to find redeemable ones is that betrayal of their religion and race is punishable by severe persecution and even death.  So, their bloodlines are cut, and /or they‚Äôre afraid to speak out. Take Mordechai Vanunu for instance.

1328732306408951808 2020-11-18 00:10:43 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> How‚Äôs this: Cancel student loan debt, and then build a Twitter clone where everyone bitter about it can go and congratulate each other on being good, responsible debt slaves.
1328728964593045506 2020-11-17 23:57:26 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @hereliesthighs  https://t.co/evUync0VcB

1328715227601526786 2020-11-17 23:02:51 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Also, to the point about making schools accountable, yes. Of course. But it will never happen, because they can point to above argument very easily, and also argue that if they bore the financial risk of backing student loans, they couldn‚Äôt practice racial equity!
1328714335124926465 2020-11-17 22:59:18 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Wtf is a ‚Äúuseful degree?‚Äù Not STEM. Those jobs are being filled by H1-Bs. Meanwhile, people with gender/racial studies degrees make BANK as CDOs and Human Capital Consultants.  That‚Äôs why I hate this argument. Your useful degree could turn useless at any point, and vice versa.
1328713157733396481 2020-11-17 22:54:37 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Why do Jews have a problem with white identity, but not black identity?  Is it because they only see one as a threat to their superiority?
1328704620642832388 2020-11-17 22:20:42 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> You yourself converted to Judaism. Was that an anti-Christian act? Was that erasing Christians?  Or does it not matter in that case because only Jews are special.
1328703678472187905 2020-11-17 22:16:57 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Guess which one views the other as an equal?
1328702793260158976 2020-11-17 22:13:26 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> A Jewish friend to a Christian is someone whose soul they‚Äôre trying to save from eternal damnation.  A Christian friend to a Jew is someone who does the chores for them on Saturday.
1328472228514721793 2020-11-17 06:57:15 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Mask enthusiasts seem to think that all the social distancing, lockdowns, mask- and glove-wearing, etc. have failed because people ignored them. But, honestly, I haven‚Äôt seen many people ignoring these suggestions.   Maybe they‚Äôre not working because they‚Äôre not good practices.
1328468735653502976 2020-11-17 06:43:22 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Lol, yeah. Fuck your dumb vacation and fancy cat food.
1328431516347740162 2020-11-17 04:15:29 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @simpterminator Like I said, if you offer loans based on the earning potential of various degrees, expect to see a boatload of gender and race studies. They‚Äôre making buckets of cash right now.
1328415974215868424 2020-11-17 03:13:43 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @simpterminator Mind you, it has been increasing. But, if you were to offer loans based on earning potential, right now, in the current year, it would result in a lot of social science degrees focused on gender and race studies.
1328415056170786829 2020-11-17 03:10:04 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @simpterminator Social sciences accounted for 8% of bachelors degrees conferred in 2017-18
1328413675519139843 2020-11-17 03:04:35 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @simpterminator There isn‚Äôt a real proliferation of those degrees to begin with, though. They account for a tiny fraction of the degrees obtained.  Also, if we‚Äôre basing loan offers on future earning potential of different degrees, gender and racial studies would get a green light right now.
1328408939877306371 2020-11-17 02:45:46 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> The reason student loans are backed by the government and not by the schools themselves is because schools would implement means-testing if they went into the loan business. Only those with good credit, from stable families, etc would be able to access a loan.  See the problem?
1328406493109116928 2020-11-17 02:36:03 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @lhztxn @benshapiro Here, this should help.  https://t.co/zfCIpJh4cG

1328400203532169218 2020-11-17 02:11:03 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @PaleoGroyper Also, I happen to have one of those ‚Äúuseless‚Äù degrees, and it actually did help me get high-paying jobs that give me much needed supplemental income. See how it gets murky?

Why end it now when they can keep people invested, both with their money and their time?  Sort of like how the holiday season keeps stretching further and further back into Halloween territory.
1327668589298593792 2020-11-15 01:43:53 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @heywildrich Maybe they thought Biden would be tougher on COVID?  It‚Äôs still a major concern, especially for older whites. I think of my parents, for one.
1327667892096266243 2020-11-15 01:41:07 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> @heywildrich It was probably not as crystal clear to non-racially aware white moderates.

1323024188534345728 2020-11-02 06:08:41 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> Looks like they started a fire in Kiev, causing ~50,000 people to lose their homes? And the citizens demanded justice?

1323012816350203906 2020-11-02 05:23:30 +0800 <DarthApuReborn> According to eyewitness testimony, prisoners were shaved before entering the showers/alleged gas chambers. Thus, the hair had already been cut from alleged corpses before alleged gassings. I‚Äôd expect that the cut hair was then fumigated, hence the presence of cyanide.

Probably told her that was all he could pay her, told her he‚Äôs a poor Eastern European etc etc. Then, makes millions off of unassuming people. Why defend this?

He conflates ‚Äúrespect‚Äù with ‚Äúacknowledge my humanity.‚Äù I notice this a lot with trans people, especially extremely online ones. They have such low self-esteem, they believe people view them as inhuman.

Everyone knows they‚Äôre human. If they have such low self-esteem that they misinterpret critics to that extent, that‚Äôs something they should deal with.
