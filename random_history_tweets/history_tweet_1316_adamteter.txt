1331996112555630597 2020-11-27 00:19:55 +0800 <adamteter> @DFBHarvard Pennsylvania does not have the option to recall a governor legally.  He would have to be impeached by the legislature to be removed from office.

1306751787853058049 2020-09-18 08:27:59 +0800 <adamteter> @paulsperry_ Wouldn't that be a mask mandate, which he already admitted is unconstitutional?  How does limiting it to federal property suddenly make it ok.  I'm pretty sure the constitution applies to federal property.
1306749710082994176 2020-09-18 08:19:43 +0800 <adamteter> @EvanAKilgore I wonder if this is why democrats want universal governmental healthcare.  Imagine what they could justify if everyone had health insurance.

That is where they list their opinions, which are indeed not scientific.  Do you really believe they have lots of evidence that masks work, but somehow neglected to link/ reference it?

Mask wearing is not science.  Call it a belief, or a religion, or a cult.  But the science does not support it.
