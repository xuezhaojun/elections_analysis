1340426605659865089 2020-12-20 06:39:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Meholeleo @smoothieDub That's right.   Munich was a beautiful city, but it's pretty much a no-go zone these days - and parts of Berlin are too.  But to visit, if you stay away from the m***** slums, if it ever goes back to how it was this time last year for example, you'd have a blast there.
1340411826866163715 2020-12-20 05:40:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Meholeleo @smoothieDub Used to live in one of those two (guess which!) for some years - can confirm it is definitely worth visiting (or at least it was then, but millions of extra m****** have been imported into the country since then).
1340313153087913986 2020-12-19 23:08:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> You're right about the fake virus, but wrong about the people responsible being like the 'Nazis'.  The 'Nazis' lost the war, in case you hadn't realised; their enemies, the j***** 'democratic' globalists, have controlled the world since 1945 and they are behind the hoax virus.
1340079497547296770 2020-12-19 07:40:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 I wouldn't say that - just differently!  In Japan they say "the nail that sticks out gets hammered down."  It takes real guts to be the nail that can't be hammered down. You're an inspiration to many people!
1340064042166136833 2020-12-19 06:38:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 "Silence is argument carried out by other means" - Che Guevara.  In other words - ignoring someone is the best kind of hostile act. It drives them crazy when they see how powerless and pathetic they are.
1340063471581487109 2020-12-19 06:36:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> I'm fortunate enough to live in a country where masks are 'recommended', not enforced.  Today came across first shop with sign requiring mask to enter.  This is how it starts. First they 'recommend', then force.  Never, ever submit - this is conformism, peer pressure, that's all.
1340062769475952640 2020-12-19 06:33:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> Brilliant.  Take the 'fine', and rip it up in front of their stupid cowardly faces.  #plandemichoax #scamdemic2020 #covid1984
1340061575454048258 2020-12-19 06:29:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> About time somebody turned the tables on these parasites.  Plenty of places and traditions associated with their 'religion' which could do with something similar.  Who's going to act, not just talk about it?
1340060896522080256 2020-12-19 06:26:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> OK.  You have her name, you know what she looks like, you know where she works.  Patriots in Ireland - are you going to stand by and allow her to get away with this?  You know what to do.  "When tyranny becomes law, rebellion becomes duty".
1339879182185209857 2020-12-18 18:24:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @gerrywebster Right... and @nationalpartyIE wants to give the 'police' MORE powers! ACI is not perfect, but anyone who has the courage to relentlessly oppose the corruption of the so-called 'Gardaí' is clearly head and shoulders above other alleged 'nationalists'.  NP is a threat to Ireland.
1339630409852792832 2020-12-18 01:55:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @TimHowe73500437 @David28787016 You're wrong.  In case you hadn't noticed, the 'Nazis' lost the war.  It is their enemies that are in control, and it is them you should be blaming for the oppression we are all facing now.
1339624655175385088 2020-12-18 01:33:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights There are endless ways; in Ireland a few months ago, a cop tried to stop me and I drove right past him. They couldn't be bothered to give chase.  If caught, give fake details.   They rely almost entirely on people's acquiescence and fear.
1339280641943203841 2020-12-17 02:46:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Sabdublindr We don't know how long. I haven't ever had a test, never mind a vaccine; it's not only a question of cost, but of principle.  Many will be coaxed into it, but others won't; it's those we've got to take inspiration from.  Fact is, this is serious - they've brought war to us.
1339273918167863298 2020-12-17 02:19:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @RealWriteWinger You've got to stop paying tax, regardless of the consequences.  It makes everything else futile.
1339273414079557634 2020-12-17 02:17:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Sabdublindr If enough of us resist, the plans cannot go through as they intend.  In France they're talking about 50% of people refusing the 'vaccine'.  With numbers like that, they can't ban people from travelling.  Stay strong, they haven't won yet.  #SCAMDEMIC2020
1339272687424770048 2020-12-17 02:14:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights I was always suspicious of this guy.  Still using 'Nazi' to describe their enemies... just like the J*** do. Classic.  If people thought for one second they would see that if WW2 had gone the other way, none of this would be happening.
1339272061714386946 2020-12-17 02:11:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'Parasites, polluters and madmen'... yes, they are simply laughing at those who support them, openly stating their own evil and getting away with it.  The one heroic service it is within our power to give, is to never stop naming them and waking others up to the struggle.
1339268649119608832 2020-12-17 01:58:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @lbertaAdvantage Not a little - a lot.  Deal with it, and carry on believing your mindless support of a tribe that hates you is going to save you.
1339251615430275072 2020-12-17 00:50:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> It has been said before, but cannot be stated often enough; the two things we should be focusing on are:  1) waking people up to the evil influence of the j*** over every aspect of their lives  2) exposing the 'Covid' #plandemic for what it is.  Everything else is secondary.
1339215156245639168 2020-12-16 22:25:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Joe88818432 Yes I agree with that. But they control more of them; we've just got to be realistic.
1339214737515683840 2020-12-16 22:24:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CharlesCalthro7 It's astonishing how fear works as an incentive for most people.  I have never had a TV license in my life - every letter I ever received from them went straight into the bin, and when doorstepped by them once, I just walked past them without saying a word.  People are cowards.
1339204476960378881 2020-12-16 21:43:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Joe88818432 They won't go of their own free will.  The only option other than relocating them against their will, is to create our own communities outside the globalist NWO system, where it is guaranteed that their poisonous influence will never reach.
1339203891448193024 2020-12-16 21:41:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Eljay30818115 @2tweetaboutit if you or I publicly criticise their 'religion', it is certain that a m***** will try to kill us.  If we do the same to Christianity or Hinduism, nothing will happen.  This is proof that even if not all m****** are, Islam is inherently violent.
1339189853238538243 2020-12-16 20:45:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> Let's be clear - it's not a 'vaccination' certificate they're talking about, but a QR code on a phone.  I don't have a 'smartphone' - as well as forcing people to be injected, they are trying to force people to pay Apple and Google in order to be tracked and monitored 24/7.
1338908853732339713 2020-12-16 02:08:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @smackovsky @ColmanOfGuaire Not surprised to hear this...
1338901319352987654 2020-12-16 01:38:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @smackovsky @ColmanOfGuaire Yes... 'Green Party' members queueing up to make trillions in profits for hypercapitalist multinational pharma firms.  Just like the 'antifa' and 'left-wingers' who also can't wait to do what the government tells them to.
1338898701721407489 2020-12-16 01:28:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Meholeleo Agreed - that is exactly the point, men in some countries are still men and will fight to protect their daughters and their nations. Not in Ireland.  That's why what needs to happen, needs to be led by a small and committed group, as we both know.
1338898217115783171 2020-12-16 01:26:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @Ben_Scallan 100% correct.  It is not those who cast votes who matter, but those who count them.  The only salvation is organisation outside the system.
1338894886079172610 2020-12-16 01:13:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> If you're still waiting for salvation through 'democracy', you're not paying attention.  Things are worse than you realise.  It isn't those who cast votes that matter, but those who count them.  Controlled opposition/the Deep State - that's the enemy, also known as the j***.
1338882225484550145 2020-12-16 00:22:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> "Based Jewish man" = contradiction in terms.  If what they are saying sounds right, it's a controlled opposition trap.
1338876345682698247 2020-12-15 23:59:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> There is no such thing as 'transgender women'.  What they mean is, self-hating, mentally-deranged men grotesquely attempting to look like women.  Transvestites, men dressed as women - no problem.  Men demanding to be referred to as women, with the law on their side - problem.
1338865255640748036 2020-12-15 23:15:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> The #MSM:  "Islam is peaceful. Men are women. Pornography is good for society. Coronavirus exists. White people are the problem. Government cares about you. The media tells the truth. The police are your friends. J*** are not evil."  Reality:  The opposite.
1338831755227385857 2020-12-15 21:02:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AndreaDS0909 @LordBrexit Mine too. There are many in the same situation. It's up to them to wake up or not... if we can see the truth, others have no excuse.  No-one said being courageous would be easy. But we have no choice. Stay strong!  #covid1984 #plandemic #scamdemic2020 #GreatReset
1338827041198759939 2020-12-15 20:43:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> Stop using a smartphone.  I have never had one and never will.  Why do otherwise intelligent people do this? Carrying a j***** #NWO spy in their pockets?  Grow up. You don't need any of the things your 'smartphone' provides you with.
1338826971229392898 2020-12-15 20:43:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> The #globalist #NWO claims #Islam is the 'religion of peace'.  But if I publicly insult their 'prophet', it is certain that a m***** will murder me.  If a m***** or j** insults Christianity, he will not be murdered.  That fact alone makes Islam inherently violent.
1338826591535816705 2020-12-15 20:41:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @McCabeJasper @Johnnydoe891 That's the most important one of all.
1338820401657491456 2020-12-15 20:17:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 Yes of course, forgot that one. Will add to the list and retweet soon. Thanks!
1338801766272471042 2020-12-15 19:03:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 And another one...  4. Don't believe everything you read.  That was still understood just 10 years ago - today if you question the mainstream media narrative, you are automatically labelled a 'Nazi' or 'extremist'.  We should wear those terms with pride.
1338780358746263553 2020-12-15 17:38:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MischievousLiz Well, if it exists, as I said and you confirm, it is not something to be concerned about and this proves that it is being exploited by governments for their own ends.  However I see no proof, other than anecdotal, that it is anything but a manufactured fear.
1338549335378817026 2020-12-15 02:20:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski @Amy_Siskind Good man.  'Anti-vaxxers', 'anti-maskers', 'anti-semites'... how ridiculous  that they think we can be silenced by their using the prefix 'anti'.   We're against those things for good reason - and everyone knows we're right, they just don't have our courage.
1338544460658057221 2020-12-15 02:00:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski @Amy_Siskind Right. Behind every degeneracy oppressing individuals and nations since 1945.
1338543845865385984 2020-12-15 01:58:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski @Amy_Siskind That's what her 'tribe' is - a virus.
1338530796378984450 2020-12-15 01:06:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ClaireNewton79 Yes, it's something.  The one thing this year has taught me however is that there is no limit to people's cowardice and stupidity - it's really separated the lions from the lambs.  The vast majority deserve what they get because if we can see the truth, so should they.
1338517074562469892 2020-12-15 00:11:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ClaireNewton79 No, they're not, because the globalist new world order has taken steps to ensure this - providing them with all the 'convenience' and distractions necessary to prevent them from thinking for themselves.  The classic 'blue pill/red pill' scenario - comforting lie or harsh truth.
1338475863894069250 2020-12-14 21:28:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> Taking pictures? I have a camera. Music? I have a music player. Internet? I have a laptop (using Tails and Tor). Calling and texting? I have a 'dumbphone'.  What excuses do other 'based' freedom fighters have for carrying a j** #NWO 'smartphone' spy in their pockets?
1338458023795286021 2020-12-14 20:17:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> Google - founded by j*** Facebook - founded by j*** Snapchat- founded by j*** Tinder - founded by j*** Netflix - founded by j*** OnlyFans - founded by j*** Youtube - owned/run by j*** Twitter - bans criticism of j***.  The only solution is OUTSIDE the system.
1338456214859100176 2020-12-14 20:10:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @TonyBea39354475 The victory of the j*** in 1945.   That's what went wrong.  We have to name them everywhere, every day.  Only when people understand who their main enemy is, can we advance.  #nationalism
1338257022765195264 2020-12-14 06:58:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> These people are the enemy more than anyone else.  75 years of propaganda... they're so idiotic they can't see that N.S. represented the last stand against the j***** #globalist #NWO. Too stupid to bother trying to save.  The #NWO are the opposite of 'Nazis'.
1338250064062525440 2020-12-14 06:30:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ClaireNewton79 Well you are at least taking more precautions than the vast majority of people do, it's good to hear.  I use a laptop running Tails and Tor, and when I want to disconnect, I shut it and I'm free. Why would anyone want to be connected/under surveillance 24/7?
1338227187217014785 2020-12-14 04:59:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights Yes, that is the number one issue we should be concerned about.  It is difficult but not impossible - we must work on developing reliable, affordable alternative methods of travelling, avoiding airlines and 'official' points of entry and exit.
1338197900048916481 2020-12-14 03:03:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights Yes, 100%.  It's a learning process - we all have areas of specialisation with which we can help each other out.  I'm working on expanding what we have here so others without their own places can live and work in the long term. Harsh climate but remote enough.
1338178973109526536 2020-12-14 01:48:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights I left the cities and moved into something like you describe 4 years ago. If enough of us do so and maintain a network of collaboration, we already have our alternative to the #globalist #NWO.  I do what I want on my own land - that's as close to freedom as we can get.
1338154362376507393 2020-12-14 00:10:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> Stop using a smartphone, full stop.  I have never had one and never will.  Why do otherwise intelligent people do this? Carrying a j***** #NWO spy in their pockets?  Grow up. You don't need any of the things your 'smartphone' provides you with.
1338114764631912449 2020-12-13 21:33:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pax44878736 Yes the truth, by which we mean the true identities of those running the world - they're not lizards, we all know who they are.  Naming them on 'Twitter' results in account deletion, because Twitter works for them too.  You know all this already I'm sure.
1337892921333456902 2020-12-13 06:51:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> "They Live isn't fiction, it's a documentary and A. H. was right."  That's what it should read - Icke doesn't have the courage to say who the real enemy is, so makes up childish stories about lizardmen - the truth is far more horrific.
1337470190611783682 2020-12-12 02:51:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> If Germany had won WW2, none of this present oppression would be happening - its defeat brought the current #globalist #NWO into being.  Those who opposed the Third Reich would have been the same kind of mask-wearing, self-hating scum as #GretaThunberg.  #covid1984 #plandemic
1337469756404871169 2020-12-12 02:50:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MMaccruiskeen You're right about the 'coronavirus' hoax - wrong about everything else.  If Germany had won WW2, none of this oppression would be happening - its defeat brought the current #globalist #NWO into being.  Sophie Scholl would have been the same kind of mask-wearing idiot as Thunberg
1337416306488979456 2020-12-11 23:17:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @suzy661 Seemingly in many cases it does, though in others not so... I have always seen through the establishment lies, even as a child, so nothing that's happening now is a surprise to me.  However we all wake up, what's important is that we do, and that we never stop speaking truth...
1337140044491087872 2020-12-11 05:00:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> The #globalist #NWO claims #Islam is the 'religion of peace'.  But if I publicly insult their 'prophet', it is certain that a m***** will murder me.  If a m***** or j** insults Christianity, he will not be murdered.  That fact alone makes Islam inherently violent.
1337023540307120129 2020-12-10 21:17:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CharlesCalthro7 Yes, exactly. Some of us never had a 'smartphone' in the first place and it is getting increasingly difficult to take seriously those who still do.  I'm still using 'Twitter' - without a smartphone. There is no excuse, unless people actually like having a spy in their pockets.
1336988810220081152 2020-12-10 18:59:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> This creature is not even in office, and already threatening people with an order to show their submission to the #globalist #NWO.  'Just 100 days' - like last March, when it was 'just 3 weeks of lockdown'.  Prepare for war.  #covid184 #SCAMDEMIC2020 #plandemic #GreatReset
1336987888651804672 2020-12-10 18:55:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> I can tell you in one word: j***.  They control the media and government; the vast majority of non-j*** obey.  It has always been thus - free yourself from their control, by any means necessary, and all else becomes possible.  #covid1984 #SCAMDEMIC2020 #plandemic #GreatReset
1336733318616846336 2020-12-10 02:03:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CharlesCalthro7 Four years here! If we all do this and maintain a loose network to help each other out if necessary, we already have the alternative to the #globalist #NWO '#GreatReset'.
1336716814181691396 2020-12-10 00:58:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> @GriffinWhiteOak I hear what you're saying. Please have a look at  https://t.co/oRv7zXKDJJ when you have time, there is more than one way to fight our enemies. Stay strong Kamerad!
1336713434126299137 2020-12-10 00:44:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> Has anyone else ever noticed how much like a j** Watson looks?  I mean quite apart from the fact that he cites a j** publication in his bio - he has the same sickly, craven appearance and slimy, hirsute countenance.  Controlled opposition if ever there was.  #deepstate
1336705637565288450 2020-12-10 00:13:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> You're not missing anything. That's the point; voting changes nothing but gives people the illusion that they have a say.  'It is not those who cast votes who matter, but those who count them'.
1336705206483095559 2020-12-10 00:12:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @DevonshireDanUK Acknowledged; Germans and English originate from the same source is all, it's a myth to say England has resisted all foreign invasions in history (Angles, Saxons, Normans etc.)  Just making the point that had Germany and England stood together, current #NWO wouldn't exist.
1336704347942641665 2020-12-10 00:08:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @London19721 Thanks! Hope you find it useful.
1336691568707821568 2020-12-09 23:17:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @London19721 Exactly right. Please have a look at  https://t.co/oRv7zXKDJJ if you are interested in reading more about this idea.
1336691242575466504 2020-12-09 23:16:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @DevonshireDanUK As Anglo-Saxons, that is the descendants of the Angles and Saxons who invaded Britain, you could not succumb to German invasion since you are already German by blood.  Otherwise, 100% right.
1336648566077616128 2020-12-09 20:27:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @EinFunkeFreude Black-white-red are the German colours, and this flag is the German flag (until it is again possible to use the real German flag - the one the #globalist #NWO is so terrified of).  #Nationalism
1336620599205097474 2020-12-09 18:35:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> Fact: if Germany had been victorious in 1945, rather than the #globalist #NWO 'Allies', none of this #covid1984 insanity and oppression would be happening.  Time to start thinking objectively rather than believing what establishment history books tell you.  #SCAMDEMIC2020
1336613264596283392 2020-12-09 18:06:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> Stop calling the enemy 'Nazis'.  The #globalist #NWO carrying out this oppression is the exact opposite of N.S.; under that system German citizens were never deprived of any freedoms, on the contrary they enjoyed a standard of living better than anywhere on earth.  #COVID1984
1336387342635069443 2020-12-09 03:09:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @4leafclover76 The so-called 'National Party' in Ireland is the worst. All but one of the senior figures in that group blocked this account simply because I politely asked them if they condemned police brutality against anti-mask protesters.  Imagine siding with the cops on this...
1336369769738612736 2020-12-09 01:59:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights At least one of the two 'countries' concerned, is not a legitimate country.
1336330485312602125 2020-12-08 23:23:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> Amazing... out of all the 89-year-old men in England, the first one to get the '#vaccine' just happens to be called William Shakespeare.  The #MSM says: "if Shakespeare is getting it, it must be OK."  That's the level of stupidity the masses exhibit - they will fall for this.
1336312305307541509 2020-12-08 22:10:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> @DevonshireDanUK I think we all know the answer to that... and we all understand who 'the finance guys' are, right?  Because until we all agree on that, and who is therefore the number one enemy, we can make no progress.
1336312055679299584 2020-12-08 22:09:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @London19721 Yes it is, because the #globalist #NWO (and we all know who that means) has limitless funding and resources.  The only answer is to be equally relentless in our opposition to it -   total disengagement from establishment 'society' is called for.  #nationalism
1336311447610155012 2020-12-08 22:07:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Deborah19952002 Never before in history has a '#vaccine' been 'approved' for use anything like as quickly as this one.  The #MSM shadowbans comments like the one you were trying to make; the Daily Mail ran a piece yesterday about how 'anti-vaxxers' are in league with Putin!  Keep resisting!
1336091567422103553 2020-12-08 07:33:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NlAMHMEALONE @AcidHaze @JohnLalor18 'Highly problematic'? This would be hilarious if the mass brainwashing of 'politics' students such as you was not such a serious issue for society.  Both of those factors have everything to do with it, since they are the only reasons he was installed as fake 'Taoiseach'.
1335994516453662728 2020-12-08 01:08:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard @NationalPartyIE I wasn't accusing you of anything - merely taking the opportunity to state once again that NP is one of the worst choices a nationalist can make, it can't be stated often enough.
1335988846601834497 2020-12-08 00:45:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard That's right, but anyone expecting @nationalpartyIE to do anything about it will be disappointed.  Justin Barrett's dream is a police state with him at the top. He doesn't care about justice for ordinary people - if he did he would be defying, not welcoming, #covid1984 tyranny.
1335956696729071619 2020-12-07 22:37:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> All those eagerly awaiting their being injected with a substance they know nothing about, by a 'government' which has been found to have lied repeatedly to them, so they can receive a 'freedom pass', remember:  "Liberty that is protected by law is slavery" - Georges Oshawa.
1335956005772013569 2020-12-07 22:35:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Deborah19952002 Because the entire #covid1984 scam was designed to lead to exactly this - people carrying 'freedom cards', as if the 'government' can give or take one's freedom.  It is not freedom if is granted to you by another.  We all have to resist this, whatever the consequences.
1335948216760737792 2020-12-07 22:04:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AcidHaze @JohnLalor18 Why does anyone care what unelected 'homosexual' half-caste Varadkar thinks?  This creature represents no-one - stop treating it as an authority on political matters. Stop giving it publicity.  There are much more important matters to attend to.
1335947291144949766 2020-12-07 22:00:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @the__dullahan We all know what it is about.  The annihilation of the the Irish nation is being accelerated, and An Post, along with the Irish Times, RTÉ and other arms of the establishment, is among those responsible.  Boycott. Use alternative logistics services. An Post is the enemy.
1335932190862036992 2020-12-07 21:00:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CJ08608341 I can understand your hope, I mean without hope there is nothing - but when it comes to MSM there is no 'independence', as you say.  Any 'debate' in those pages is just controlled opposition. Basically anyone who reads that trash has to be considered a fool and/or enemy.
1335876516144668673 2020-12-07 17:19:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> Once the 'government'/'police' is given more power, it will never surrender it.  In Ireland, they can say that for nearly a year they have met no resistance to stopping drivers and turning them back for no reason.  This IS the 'new normal' - unless you fight it.  #COVID1984
1334555872362631182 2020-12-04 01:51:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> See how this being mentions its black and Asian colleagues to suggest that nationalists hate all races, for no reason, and that j***, once again, are the 'innocent victims'.  There is only one race that is the real problem, and we all know which one that is.

1334181768677777412 2020-12-03 01:04:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @the__dullahan Che was right.
1334080434871873537 2020-12-02 18:22:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> There is a certain event the #globalist #NWO insists occurred in the 20th century.  It didn't happen. But if it had taken place, it would have been the greatest service to mankind, and to the planet Earth, ever performed.  #DeepStateCabal #History
1333836798141870084 2020-12-02 02:14:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CiaranOMeachair @lugh____ Yes, seriously.  It's the 'Free State' broadcaster - what else do you expect?  Irish government is a British pawn; Irish police enforce British agenda.  I presume you're not paying a 'licence fee'?
1333836118593310724 2020-12-02 02:11:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @TewdrigapT Stop paying tax.  You've got to... there is no other choice.
1333832206259793920 2020-12-02 01:55:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights We can live in hope.
1333829187669520386 2020-12-02 01:43:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnjoMahockey No, for agitating against the German people.  You seem confused about who and what you support and oppose.  It isn't difficult. Figure it out, then we can talk.
1333828703139336193 2020-12-02 01:41:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnjoMahockey @NationalPartyIE No, it is the 'so-called'... because accepting their legitimacy means accepting that of the so-called 'government', which also has no mandate.
1333818908470628353 2020-12-02 01:03:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnjoMahockey @NationalPartyIE Agreed, but the point was that ACI has more support than NP, and rightly so since G O'D at least knows the real problem lies in the so-called 'Gardaí', without whom there could be no tyranny.  NP on the other hand welcomes the police state.
1333818517091717123 2020-12-02 01:01:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights @ianbrown is pretty much the only one left.
1333806586196860929 2020-12-02 00:14:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Rolloson14 I know, I wasn't suggesting you do.  It was intended for many who will read it, too many of whom continue to see these usurpers as having authority over them.
1333806244017164292 2020-12-02 00:12:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnjoMahockey @NationalPartyIE OK, well feel free to explain more if you wish.
1333792067680493569 2020-12-01 23:16:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Rolloson14 Right - but they are not 'our' leaders, they never were and they never will be.  They are an occupying #globalist #NWO force and must be treated as such, not voted for and joked about as too many still do.  #nationalism
1333774486160646146 2020-12-01 22:06:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> "A man is no less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years" - Lysander Spooner
1333760422961352709 2020-12-01 21:10:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> The delusion of @nationalpartyIE and its supporters is really something (and I'm not even talking about their laughable belief that they'll one day be 'elected').  Shunning Gemma O'Doherty/ACI because they think they are more popular - that's a whole new level of stupidity.
1333750094089375747 2020-12-01 20:29:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> Have you ever heard of anything so clearly a contradiction in terms, as a 'freedom pass'?  No 'government', ever, has the right to tell citizens where in their land they may or may not go, nor for how long.  Accepting a 'pass' means accepting their control over you.  #COVID1984
1333747708893556741 2020-12-01 20:20:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @London19721 @punished_ray @PatrioticTalk14 There is no such thing.  Nationalism is love of one's nation; one's nation is one's people and one's land, not just the latter. The two are indivisible.  'Civic nationalism' is just yet another controlled opposition smokescreen.  #Nationalism is ethnonationalism.
1333715642403463169 2020-12-01 18:12:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'Racist'. 'Nazi'. 'Transphobe'. 'Anti-semite'. 'Islamophobe'.  It's funny that the absolute worst 'insults' the #globalist #NWO slaves can think of, are in fact compliments.  All of the above mean: 'one who thinks for him- or her- self and opposes nefarious j***** influence'.
1333524649678954498 2020-12-01 05:33:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> Let us be clear - even if there was a deadly pandemic, which there is not, no government has the right, ever, to confine people in their homes and shut down livelihoods, for any reason.  'Government' is meant to protect the people - the one thing it is not doing.  #covid1984
1333492662381457415 2020-12-01 03:26:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> What people call 'representative democracy' is really just the public relations department for an establishment power structure which 'voters' can never influence.  The j***** #globalist #NWO controls your life. 'Voting' won't change this.  Other actions will.
1333487723055869952 2020-12-01 03:07:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SeenRusty Thanks, obviously that's all we have in common with them but it was only a matter of time until the j***** #NWO turned its attention from bombing defenceless 3rd-world countries to tightening the screws in the West.  No votes - no taxes - no cooperation with 'police'/'govt.'
1333481695874592782 2020-12-01 02:43:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> British tabloids now reporting that 'army units' will move from 'fighting terror' to 'combatting anti-vaxxers'.  Real subtle.  Conflating opposition to tyranny with 'terrorism' - as enemies of the #globalist #NWO, we should be proud to be put in the same category as the Taliban.

1333409425625931778 2020-11-30 21:55:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'Governments' all over the western world have been crying about how their health services are at risk of being 'overwhelmed'...   by a 'disease', which - if it even existed - they admit has a 99.9% survival rate.  #msm #thegreatreset #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #ScamdemicIsControl
1333139985764151297 2020-11-30 04:05:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> Reminder - every single @nationalpartyIE rep., the latest @paulmcweeneyNP, has insulted, then blocked, this account when asked if they personally condemn the police for assaulting unarmed protesters.  NP wants the police state to continue. They are the opposite of nationalists.
1333138560438898703 2020-11-30 03:59:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> They should never have had good people's support - the police are the worst kind of 'people' you can imagine, mindlessly carrying out #globalist #NWO policitians' commands and looking for any excuse to attack innocents.  Never forget this, and never forgive. No co-operation, ever
1333112336605962245 2020-11-30 02:15:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @nationalpartyIE is a joke.  It has blocked this account, as did its 'leader', and now @PaulMcWeeneyNP, with whom I had a discussion last night on the issue, responds to a direct question - 'do you condemn police brutality?' - by blocking me.  They are nothing if not predictable!
1333078292845486083 2020-11-30 00:00:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> Simple question for @NationalPartyIE's @PaulMcWeeneyNP, who thinks being asked questions about his party's policies is 'trolling':  do you personally condemn police beating anti-'lockdown' protesters?
1333061286691819520 2020-11-29 22:52:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CitizenIre @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE Well at least we don't have to worry about that ever happening - unbelievable delusion, him talking as if he will ever be in a position to do that.  @nationalpartyIE is proving itself one of the worst enemies of the Irish people - this 'lockdown' has at least shown that.
1332843404720533504 2020-11-29 08:26:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE I didn't say you were, but if you ever came anywhere near 'government' you would be.  That's how it works.  Anyway I thought you were off back to your electioneering duties - don't let me keep you.
1332842809490026496 2020-11-29 08:24:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE Good to know there is critical thinking going on there and not mere hero-worship.  There's a point we can perhaps agree on.
1332842406153236480 2020-11-29 08:22:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE Perhaps, but a nationalist who participates in the deep state sham of controlled opposition is likely to have motives other than merely love of his nation.
1332842059208814592 2020-11-29 08:21:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE Hadn't you better get back to your important job, because as suggested earlier you don't have time to sit around arguing with anonymous people on Twittter?  You must have found a window in your Nationalist schedule. I appreciate you making time from the "job that needs doing".
1332841622195875842 2020-11-29 08:19:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE Pardon me, I should have said 'desperate-to-be-part-of-the establishment media' credentials.  Therein lies your tragedy - you want the media and government to accept you. Neither will ever happen.
1332841024306229251 2020-11-29 08:17:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE It's clear his spell over you is strong, so good luck with your approach.  Respect for being one of the only NP reps to actually make some kind of attempt to explain yourself.
1332840585774903296 2020-11-29 08:15:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE I must say your devotion to the man is... noteworthy, but I am not insulting him for the sake of it.  It is just that it is clear to everyone outside the NP bubble that you have zero chance of being 'elected' into government, so one questions his intelligence.
1332839210965995524 2020-11-29 08:10:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE You people love the 'feds', as you put it! That's the whole problem with NP.
1332839072231002116 2020-11-29 08:09:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE Now, the insults - as I predicted.  Why so immediately hostile? You honestly believe the police are going to serve you one day?  And seriously, 'fed'? It's embarrassing, NP's establishment credentials are clear - please don't try to use 'radical' terminology.
1332838568696438787 2020-11-29 08:07:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE You truly believe NP is going to be in 'power' one day and that you will be in a position to influence 'government'?  Because you seem smarter than Barrett and some others involved.
1332838058283192327 2020-11-29 08:05:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE A 'fed'? Says the establishment-worshipping NP representative? You can't have it both ways - NP is not a radical party.  All I said was that NP's devotion to 'democracy' is clear. I'm genuinely curious though about one question.
1332837040795361282 2020-11-29 08:01:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE No, no-one expects them to do that - but that is no reason to come to terms with them.  They represent the ultimate face of the enemy - without them the #globalist #NWO cabal would be powerless.  No cooperation with them. ever.
1332836694224216065 2020-11-29 08:00:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE That NP has condemned the enforcers, i.e. the so-called 'Gardaí'.
1332836576334925826 2020-11-29 07:59:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE He came back under a different guise, which was then banned as well.
1332836462128226305 2020-11-29 07:59:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE You really don't. Don't look for an excuse to do that or you'll just prove my point more.  NP has made no secret of its devotion to 'democracy', don't worry, no-one's going to think you're not 'obeying the rules'.
1332835984166313984 2020-11-29 07:57:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE It's your choice to respond or not, so I am not wasting it. No-one's forcing you.  In your heart of hearts, you honestly believe the #globalist system would allow NP to take power - ever? You cannot win this battle using this approach.
1332835482770796550 2020-11-29 07:55:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE Incorrect, in fact when asked directly to condemn Garda brutality against unarmed anti-lockdown protesters, Barrett blocked me.  Seriously - rather than do so, or explain why not, that was his response. I wonder if you people realise how much potential support you have alienated.
1332834942380875776 2020-11-29 07:53:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE It's the desperate desire to be part of the very system explicitly devoted to destroying Ireland, which is the problem.  'Vote NP' - like voting for anyone else never changed anything, but this time it will, just trust us!  It's unconvincing to say the least.
1332834413982461953 2020-11-29 07:51:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE This isn't trolling. It's a recognition of the fact that NP is a handful of people, you're one, it's direct communication in an attempt to stop you wasting your time and resources.  If you continue to, one can only assume you are deliberately misleading people for your own ends.
1332833199765016579 2020-11-29 07:46:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE How is that not constructive?  NP's pathetic slavish devotion to hypercapitalism is one of its principal flaws; another is its failure to denounce the current 'government''s tyranny enforcement.  Fix these, you may have a chance. Constructive enough?
1332832684050157572 2020-11-29 07:44:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE By accusing me of doing nothing, when you know nothing of my circumstances. My anonymity is connected to my doing a lot more than 'nothing' - you people need not concern yourselves with consequences, since all you do is talk.  Feel free not to engage if I'm so unimportant.
1332832164640075777 2020-11-29 07:42:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE Always the same bluster though, no content just delivery.  He is a former Fine Gael man through and through - worships the police scum because he dreams of them being his own private army, like that's ever going to happen.  NP are nothing but a distraction from the real issues.
1332831644470964225 2020-11-29 07:40:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JohnTie42087180 @NationalPartyIE More insults.  You lot are really charismatic, I must say.  And this is NP all over - "next time". Just going to wait four years every time and do nothing in between. Oh, except post pictures of coins and dream of the past.
1332831253503078402 2020-11-29 07:38:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE Classic obfuscation attempt.  That's not what I said - but I'm not answerable to the 'electorate'. You people are. And this is how you treat them.  You've learnt well from your hero - insult rather than engage. So quick to go on the defensive, it seems you don't have an answer.
1332829489752137729 2020-11-29 07:31:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE That's exactly what they want. You only have to look at their hero-worship of US-style hypercapitalism, and total lack of concern for those on the sidelines, to see it; Barrett is obsessed with power, not justice, and the tragedy is he'll never have even a taste of it.
1332829059693338626 2020-11-29 07:29:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE I'm not seeking 'election' so don't have to explain myself to you.  If you're doing that, you need to be able to explain your position in a civil manner to those asking questions.  Your 'leader' insults and blocks people instead, and still expects to win support from 'voters'.
1332827980972888077 2020-11-29 07:25:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> This is exactly what we need. If everyone refuses to wear masks and recognise police 'authority', there is nothing the #globalist enforcement scum can do.  #policebrutality #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #scamdemic2020
1332827423252094980 2020-11-29 07:23:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP Oh yes? When @nationalpartyIE, which blocks anyone asking questions, rather than trying to explain its position, rules Ireland?  That's never going to happen. Just wanting it to doesn't make it so.  Why isn't NP saying anything about Ireland's 'lockdown' and police enforcers?
1332816738120052739 2020-11-29 06:40:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> The lying #MSM of the #globalist #NWO call Belarus "the last dictatorship in Europe".  There, there is no 'lockdown'; no curfew; no masks; no fines; no 'virus'.  It is, in fact, the last free country in Europe.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #thregreatreset #scamdemic2020
1332482633641713665 2020-11-28 08:33:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> The worst advertisement for globalism, is its adherents. These are the kinds of people the media is glorifying.  We know we are on the right side. Stay strong, keep fighting.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #scamdemic2020 #TheGreatReset
1331992838847029249 2020-11-27 00:06:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MyFreedomNews The truth, as always, is worse than fiction.  People are willingly going to submit to a 'vaccine' for a non-existent virus, which contains cells from 'aborted' human beings.

1331961715265859584 2020-11-26 22:03:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> This is true. And more importantly, they actually provided protection in return for the extortion they levied on ordinary people.  Today, people willingly pay their 'taxes' while running the risk of having a truck driven at them or being stabbed or shot by invaders every day.
1331930443638317056 2020-11-26 19:58:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @NationalPartyIE I like this suggestion. Another problem is that many so-called 'nationalists' who follow the likes of NP are obsessed with unrestricted capitalism - whereas it is capitalism which allows 'leaders' to receive such obscene payment. Not 'Socialism' we need, but fairness.
1331929417166303238 2020-11-26 19:54:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @NationalPartyIE This is all true.  Rather than just complaining about it, I think we need to make serious moves towards developing a grouping outside the establishment, whereby we can provide all like-minded people with the support network they need, without relying on the corrupt system.
1331922674491265024 2020-11-26 19:28:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @NationalPartyIE That's just it, they are not even setting up a future for themselves because they will never get anywhere with their approach - they will find that they have wasted their lives trying to be let into a club that won't have them, rather than working outside the corrupt system.
1331920846202544129 2020-11-26 19:20:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @NationalPartyIE Exactly. Barrett's position on 'abortion' is correct, but he is a former member of Fine Gael, which says everything you need to know.  He dreams of being a real 'politician', rather than of saving his country.  I don't think any real nationalist is taken in by him.
1331917339688890369 2020-11-26 19:06:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> Reminder: @NationalPartyIE does not condemn Garda (Irish police) violence and brutality against unarmed protesters.  When asked to do so, Justin Barrett, leader of the NP, insulted and blocked this account.  What has he got to hide? Why is he supporting the establishment?
1331738242627022849 2020-11-26 07:15:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> As if there were not already a million reasons to oppose 'vaccination' (the principal one being, that no 'authority' has the right to force or coerce people into doing something they don't want to):  they are tested on captive chimpanzees. Animals are not property.  Resist!
1331663488192819207 2020-11-26 02:18:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 I hope it won't - try not to worry too much until you can be sure, it's possible it's benign. We need all the fighters we can get against this oppression - stay strong.
1331654034986586114 2020-11-26 01:40:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 Thanks a lot man.
1331653930091212800 2020-11-26 01:40:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 Sorry to hear it my friend. I'm no expert but I'd say a reliable diagnosis can't be had just by looking at pictures.  When I had to deal with the NHS in the past I found it was only possible to get through to them in person. Try to think positively, they may yet call.
1331650434319200259 2020-11-26 01:26:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 This is how it is now.  If you challenge the establishment narrative, you will be excluded from all services - I recently lost my grandmother to cancer because she couldn't get an appointment to be seen in time.  Hope all turns out OK for you. Keep fighting the #plandemic.
1331641026449190916 2020-11-26 00:48:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> No nationalist can support #JordanPeterson.  This is a man who:   - tells his students "Nazis were evil"; - wears a poppy honouring the British army, while slandering Germany; - takes drugs, cries on camera and makes millions from telling people to 'stand up straight'.  Wake up.
1331629081813803010 2020-11-26 00:01:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> For God's sake wake up.  Your governments have been dictating what you can and can't do your entire lives.  That's what 'government' is. The only question is, does the benefit outweigh the cost?  Under a regime which opposes j** influence, yes. Under one which enables it - no.
1331620131059986434 2020-11-25 23:25:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @leannemac4 Yes, precisely. Anyone who thinks that was 'freedom' deserves everything they get.  If every local group of like-minded people rejects the 'democratic' #NWO system completely and such groups collaborate outside the system, there is hope.
1331586753073995781 2020-11-25 21:13:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @leannemac4 Definitely.  The compliance is enabled by people's addiction to smartphones, trash TV, Netflix etc. - the docility doesn't come from nowhere, this has been planned for a long time.  Like you say, some of us though saw through it from the start. Local-level cooperation is needed.
1331583757564964869 2020-11-25 21:01:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @leannemac4 This is true. That's why mask-wearers are as guilty as the MSM/police/politicians - their compliance enables this tyranny and oppression.  If everyone refused, there would be nothing the 'authorities' could do about it.
1331582711367147521 2020-11-25 20:57:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 @leannemac4 Exactly right.  How is it a 'protest', if they ask permission to march on their own streets, from the so-called 'government' and 'police' they are protesting against?  'Govt.' has no authority - that is what everyone must realise. They have only the power people give them.

1331317586991210503 2020-11-25 03:23:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> Why is this surprising?  #Amnestyinternational foreshadowed the anti-white, self-hatred #globalist narrative by decades.  The real issue is people laughably thinking that 'political representation' can save us, or is something we ever had in the first place.  Democracy is a lie.
1331313746472480768 2020-11-25 03:08:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> A summary of 2020 so far:  - #globalist #NWO enacts total surveillance/control bid - huge majority of people willingly surrender dignity/freedom when told to - billionaires grow richer while small businesses forced to close - all dissent violently quashed by police.  Awake yet?
1331282273329680385 2020-11-25 01:03:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ThisIsMadness5 @voluntasadnihil @SandraWeeden I suspect both will happen, unfortunately.

Yet another science-fiction dystopia that has come true - the above is what we'll be telling our grandchildren.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #scamdemic
1331255030574444545 2020-11-24 23:15:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @al___hernandez @voluntasadnihil @SandraWeeden People might think twice, but when they see what they have to gain by complying, that will decide for them.  There's no point in us arguing about it. Other people take flu shots - they will take the 'vaccine'.
1331252099619954693 2020-11-24 23:03:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @al___hernandez @voluntasadnihil @SandraWeeden No - as I said, the vast majority. Airlines all embraced the mask enforcement despite promising exemptions for those who chose not to wear one; they will be equally ruthless in enforcing the 'vaccine' requirement.  We all hope it won't happen. But hope alone is not enough.
1331245821153730563 2020-11-24 22:38:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @al___hernandez @voluntasadnihil @SandraWeeden Exactly, that is the idea. We all hope that is what will happen - but this is Twitter, not the real world, and the vast majority of brainwashed people will take the vaccine.
1331236362675245060 2020-11-24 22:00:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @voluntasadnihil @SandraWeeden True. I think the point is that if Qantas saw an immediate backlash and real boycott, other airlines would reconsider.  Granted, that's not going to happen. So we have a real problem on our hands in a few weeks' time.
1331204148935749637 2020-11-24 19:52:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 It's tough to do.  But that just shows how truly evil the #globalist scum in media and government are - they know they are turning family members and friends against one another, and that is all part of the plan.
1331200707521900544 2020-11-24 19:39:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 All we can do is keep fighting - no matter what happens.  Anyone you fall out with over this was not worth having in your life to begin with - this is an apocalyptic scenario we are facing, and we have to stop being so forgiving of those enabling it by complying.
1331200121174962176 2020-11-24 19:36:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Absolutely - and what they utterly fail to grasp, is that history has shown time and again, once you surrender your freedoms, you'll never get them back.
1331199362928701441 2020-11-24 19:33:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> Taking the 'vaccine' = taking the blue pill: just this little injection, and everything goes back to 'normal', keep watching Netflix and staring at your iPhone while we enslave you even further.  I don't watch Netflix, don't have an iPhone - and won't be  taking a 'vaccine'.
1331198918084923398 2020-11-24 19:32:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 No, I don't think so.  But still when it comes down to it, even many who are suspicious right now, won't have the guts to see it through - they'll take the vaccine/blue pill instead and everything will go back to 'normal' for them.  For the rest of us, 'normal' is gone for good.
1331198346116157441 2020-11-24 19:29:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Right. Profits at Amazon, Walmart, Tesco etc. through the roof, while small businesses crushed by the 'government'.  And yet those supporting the 'pandemic' measures most vocally are the 'left-wing' and 'antifa'!  Soon: no travel if you refuse to buy an Apple or Google product.
1331189113219899394 2020-11-24 18:53:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Not exactly.  But the advantage they have over ordinary people is that they already lived outside the law, more or less. They answer to their own code, even if that is one of mere criminality, not to the state.  The question is, who is prepared to separate from 'society'?
1331016769985720326 2020-11-24 07:28:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 They won't. They get a special pass for everything - they can commit crime with impunity.  It's only ordinary, tax-paying, law-abiding people who are targeted by the #globalist #NWO. You won't find a single traveller with a driving license, but they've all got cars.
1331010815982448641 2020-11-24 07:04:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski You're right.  I mentioned a few weeks ago I was going to get in touch about plans. If you are open to it I'll send you a DM tomorrow and we can talk further.
1330997323971878912 2020-11-24 06:11:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Who, me? No, I don't think that. 'Heaven help us if we were to spend our time on protests, instead of preparing for the struggle' - A. H.  Those of us who are awake to it are the vanguard - we have to keep resistance alive in our actions. The masses don't want to be saved.
1330996500940328960 2020-11-24 06:07:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Well, exactly... and the majority of the world continue now doing all those things and watching Netflix.   In ancient Rome they called it 'bread and circuses'... in other words, if people have their needs met and entertainment provided, they are no longer a threat.
1330946227060535296 2020-11-24 02:48:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski if the #NWO can be escaped, national governments' only function ought to be to protect native citizens from foreign invasion - otherwise, one shouldn't even be aware of government's existence.  Look how much the current system is failing to do that one basic job.
1330945704936738820 2020-11-24 02:45:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Total separation from the #globalist #NWO establishment is, in my opinion, the only route to freedom.  Individuals and families on their own lands, self-employed, no tax, self-reliant but collaborating with like-minded people everywhere to form an alternative 'system'.
1330897705103732736 2020-11-23 23:35:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> @gerd_dold You have no guilt.
1330886714278162432 2020-11-23 22:51:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @MomRango Exactly. None of the people deciding these things face the same problems ordinary people do, that is why they are so soft on crime and is why they will ruthlessly enforce the corona hoax - they won't need any 'vaccine' to travel, only we will.
1330886260798480385 2020-11-23 22:49:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SaoMc2 @leannemac4 @SquidiaUK Thanks for the succinct explanation.  The foetus in question was from an elective 'abortion', just for the avoidance of doubt, which means a human being died so that scientists could obtain what they needed to create unnecessary medical 'treatments' with which to control people.
1330884483285987328 2020-11-23 22:42:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @MomRango That won't help, in my opinion.  The legal system is as much part of the establishment as the MSM and government. Minor victories here and there possible, but nothing like the paradigm shift we require.  I don't think fighting the establishment using its own rules can work.
1330873334746271747 2020-11-23 21:58:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael29253169 But he still hosts the leader of '#Israel' in Hungary. That's the ultimate test of whether a leader is worth following or not. If he supports '#Israel', he is no nationalist.
1330872876703035394 2020-11-23 21:56:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Next year will be much worse than this one - that's when the reality of no international travel/no access to entertainment, services, shops etc. without 'vaccine' will become the 'norm' for 99% of the population.  Things are about to get real, as they say.
1330872486439907328 2020-11-23 21:55:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MomRango @leannemac4 Exactly, whatever it is, they will be engrossed in some distraction and that's all it takes to take their limited remaining 'freedoms' away.  Qantas chief executive just announced no vaccine = no flight. Expect every other airline to follow. Another true 'conspiracy theory'.
1330870580590108673 2020-11-23 21:47:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 When it comes down to it though, how many will choose freedom over comfort when they are forced to make the decision?  Not many, in my opinion - not enough, in any case.
1330869950584664066 2020-11-23 21:44:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> @skorpionmouse Certainly this is sinister, but "political representation" is part of the problem - as long as people believe they can be saved through 'democracy', and continue wasting time voting and electioneering, there is no hope.  The only possible salvation must be outside the system.
1330868727894708227 2020-11-23 21:40:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Ireland isn't sleep-walking into it... people know what they are doing but have weighed up the 'pros' (Netflix, consumer credit, return to travel when 'vaccinated') against the 'cons' (standing up for civil liberties/common sense/freedom) and this is the decision they're making.
1330842128205950983 2020-11-23 19:54:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> Edit - this is not an endorsement of communism; many here take things very literally. But Stalin was speaking the truth on this matter; at least the likes of communism, national socialism and other totalitarian regimes do not lecture the world about 'freedom' as 'democracies' do.
1330837893334577153 2020-11-23 19:37:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> Democracy is a lie.  Whoever you 'vote' for, the Deep State always wins - this is controlled opposition in action.  'It isn't those who cast votes who decide - it is those who count them' - Joseph Stalin.  If no-one votes, no 'politician' scum can claim a mandate. Take control.
1330837643098255362 2020-11-23 19:36:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @LordBrexit Democracy is a lie.  Whoever you 'vote' for, the Deep State always wins - this is controlled opposition in action.  'It isn't those who cast votes who decide - it is those who count them' - Joseph Stalin.  If no-one votes, no 'politician' scum can claim a mandate. Take control.
1330831249263517697 2020-11-23 19:11:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> Marching and protesting is all well and good, but just going back to 'normal' life when the protest is over, that's the problem. Doing so legitimises the power 'politician' scum have over you.  Also, why 'peaceful' when the 'police' are not required to be?
1330828965108453378 2020-11-23 19:02:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> It acts without shame because that's what you can do when you control the entire world's government and media apparatus. It knows it is above the law.  And the women in the video know they have nothing to lose, hence their bravery. If only people in the West had their strength.
1330827999512551424 2020-11-23 18:58:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @tuffy_sir @leannemac4 @SquidiaUK That's what they say - but even so, killing even a single baby to make 'vaccines' for globalists to inject the servile masses with is insane, yet that's what's happening.
1330827649317564417 2020-11-23 18:56:51 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @SquidiaUK That's what they claim.  Like I said, firstly that's almost certainly a lie;  and  secondly, even if it were true, how do people think killing even a single baby to justify being injected by globalists is OK?  We are living in a science fiction dystopia.
1330824048645955584 2020-11-23 18:42:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @SquidiaUK First - the information available states the cells are from babies 'aborted' years ago and kept in a lab since.  Second - if they admit the above, who knows how horrific the truth being kept from us is?  Last - vax contain cells from 'aborted' babies! People are ok with this?
1330456977227575298 2020-11-22 18:23:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> Reminder - it is not 'nazis' beating innocent people, breaking into their homes and pointing guns at them, forcing them to wear muzzles and inject their children with 'vaccines' full of slaughtered animal matter and cells from murdered babies.  'Democrats' are doing this.
1330209134575296514 2020-11-22 01:59:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal ... and let us never forget that the official Church sided with the 'Free State' traitors in the Irish civil war, declaring the anti-Treaty freedom fighters to be 'excommunicated'!  Church authorities go where the power and money is - those are their only principles.
1330185006329847813 2020-11-22 00:23:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> Animal welfare is a political and nationalist issue! New article here:   https://t.co/CybBBITX4i  #animalwelfare #capitalism #Nationalism #veganism #vegan #fastfood #mcdonalds #burgerking #kfc @McDonalds @BurgerKing @BurgerKingUK @kfc
1329903666300641281 2020-11-21 05:45:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski @NationalPartyIE Exactly right.  And it's just possible that NP might be the worst of all, with Barrett posturing as anti-establishment but refusing to condemn the police, because in his dreams they'll be his private army.  You're correct - liberation won't come from 'democracy'.
1329882756298514439 2020-11-21 04:22:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Yes, great to hear it said by more people, but saying it in the Dáil won't help.  The controlled opposition he rightly identifies is there for a reason. Says a lot that @nationalpartyIE is so desperate to become part of the Dáil - part of the system.  Got to organise outside it.
1329503741238718464 2020-11-20 03:16:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> Please, freedom fighters - stop shouting 'nazis' when you see footage like the arrest of Andreas Noack.  The regime of the so-called 'Federal Republic of Germany' is the opposite of a certain former regime which the MSM demonises - it is not 'nazis' doing this, but 'democrats'.
1329481866529935360 2020-11-20 01:49:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mac59914127 That is true, but if you think @nationalpartyIE are the 'opposition' you are sorely mistaken.  Justin Barrett insulted and blocked me when I asked him if he condemned Garda brutality against unarmed, innocent people; he also said NP is "like any other party".
1329181459375067136 2020-11-19 05:55:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @suzy661 Possibly... the sad thing is, most of the public other than those on our side still aren't against the police.  And if they did want to bring in the military, they can just do it - who's going to stop them?  We have to organise away from the cities, under the radar.
1329098421228228609 2020-11-19 00:25:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @suzy661 Right. There is so much footage from today alone you don't know where to start - huge policemen punching defenceless women on the ground.  The police are the problem - without them, 'politicians' would have no way of enforcing their evil. We've got to make people realise this.
1329088002618916868 2020-11-18 23:44:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Deborah19952002 @KayJaySings @LordBrexit You're welcome. Sorry about my suspicion to your initial question, just so many time-wasters on here who don't really want to progress, just to cause trouble.  Best of luck and let me know how you're getting on! Stay strong.
1329087596467634177 2020-11-18 23:42:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 Exactly right.  Plenty of time for more discussion once we've dealt with the #globalist #NWO threat.  I salute your bravery!
1329087309954707456 2020-11-18 23:41:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 You're welcome. Trying to get as many awakened people as possible, from all backgrounds, involved.
1329086940918870024 2020-11-18 23:39:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> What we need is for protesters to start treating the police with the same 'non-violence' and 'respect' the #globalist #NWO enforcer scum are showing to innocent people...  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #SCAMDEMIC2020 #TheGreatReset
1329082835731288075 2020-11-18 23:23:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 No problem.  The content of the site is wide-ranging, but please remember our opposition to the current system unites us despite any disagreements.
1329082682672758785 2020-11-18 23:22:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Deborah19952002 @KayJaySings @LordBrexit Also, feel free to get in touch here or via the site if I can help in any way. Collaboration between like-minded individuals is the way forward.
1329082454913679361 2020-11-18 23:22:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Deborah19952002 @KayJaySings @LordBrexit No problem. I know it's not easy nor even possible for many, and it is a work in progress for me, but we have to start somewhere.  The content of the site is wide-ranging, but please remember our opposition to the current system unites us despite any disagreements.
1329077618927230978 2020-11-18 23:02:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Deborah19952002 @KayJaySings @LordBrexit As I said, best place to start is  https://t.co/oRv7zY2eBh (contact made there always replied to).  In a nutshell, stop all use of establishment media, stop paying tax, acquire land away from cities and create support networks with similarly-minded folk.  It's already happening.
1329076912564498434 2020-11-18 23:00:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ianmackenzie2 You can always reach Jenseits des Nordwindes at  https://t.co/oRv7zY2eBh - please bookmark the site if you're interested!
1329074389753634823 2020-11-18 22:50:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @EKatholik Zusammen gegen die 'Demokratie'diktatur!
1329073304808812555 2020-11-18 22:45:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Deborah19952002 @KayJaySings @LordBrexit If this is a genuine question, rather than an attempt to waste time on pointless 'Twitter' arguments, I respectfully suggest you read the website linked to in my bio. for more information.  There are a multitude of ways to do so, but to succeed you must be determined.
1329069061846679552 2020-11-18 22:28:51 +0800 <JenDesNor> @EKatholik Alles leider wahr.
1329060394447622144 2020-11-18 21:54:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> Consider yourself #prolife? Vaccines contain cells from 'aborted' human babies.  Care about #animalwelfare? Vaccines contain matter from slaughterhouses and animal embryos, and are tested on animals.  Consider yourself sovereign? Mandatory vaccines are being proposed.  RESIST!
1329029480749428737 2020-11-18 19:51:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> The police are your enemy - never forget.  They violently assault innocent people without consequence... should innocent people not have the right to do unto their attackers as is done unto them?  NEVER CO-OPERATE WITH THE POLICE.  #policestate #PoliceBrutality #plandemichoax
1329028555087486976 2020-11-18 19:47:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> "Please wash your hands. Your brain, we will wash" - German TV channels listed beneath. This is exactly right.  Everybody - STOP READING NEWSPAPERS, STOP WATCHING TV, STOP LISTENING TO THE RADIO.  There is no 'virus'.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #SCAMDEMIC2020 #COVID19
1328809865561640967 2020-11-18 05:18:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Some argue that individual Gardaí are not to blame. But these people sign up to serve the #globalist #NWO - they are not conscripted.  They aren't faceless bureaucrats - these are people's neighbours, beating and arresting innocent individuals just for living their lives. Scum.
1328805643181060099 2020-11-18 05:02:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski This is all correct; the only amendment I would make is that no Irish police 'deserve' anything other than that which traitors to the nation should receive.  The so-called 'Gardaí' are the most pernicious foe we have, for without them, those at the top have no power.
1328773176441122817 2020-11-18 02:53:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael29253169 They have a clue alright, they know exactly what they are doing - they know it is utterly incompatible with white values, which is why they are importing it under orders from their masters of yet another foreign 'religion'.  The aim is to destroy white Britain.  #nationalism
1328760480068997122 2020-11-18 02:02:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @georgegalloway Like the "hope" Obama brought you mean George?  The "hope" that led to more innocent people dying by cowardly drone strikes under his 'leadership' than under Bush?  'Democracy' is deep state controlled opposition. Biden or Trump, the 1% wins. You know this. Why don't you say so?
1328759822293082112 2020-11-18 02:00:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @piersmorgan What's horrifying is how #globalist #NWO scum like you can live with themselves after spreading these outright lies.  There is no virus and you know it.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #SCAMDEMIC2020 #COVID19
1328744366505136128 2020-11-18 00:58:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> @OccamsRazorBook @BraveNWO They have chosen their side, the #globalist #NWO.  Everyone needs to wake up and realise they have no more pernicious foe than the police - these people carry out orders they, in many cases, do not even agree with.  What does that tell you about their ethics or intelligence?
1328722185691738119 2020-11-17 23:30:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 That's true, but the MSM can't be relied upon to give an accurate indication of that. It's a warren of propaganda, diversion, distraction, misinformation and outright lies intended to demoralise and divide the public.  We should remain on permanent alert for what's coming.
1328709131381960705 2020-11-17 22:38:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Right.  There are so many on here who begin a post with "so-and-so on RTÉ saying..." or "The Irish Times says... ".  Of course one must know what the enemy is doing, but there are better ways than using his media.  Imagine the immediate freedom of not being immersed in this.
1328680729258176515 2020-11-17 20:45:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP No-one needs that evidence. We all know the problems.  The question is, is @nationalpartyIE going to continue defending police brutality against 'lawbreakers' when those choosing to follow Drew Harris' orders are enforcing these 'laws'?
1328679152715706370 2020-11-17 20:39:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights You know some of us are, deadly serious.
1328678523729551366 2020-11-17 20:37:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 I think one of the biggest obstacles is that so many on our side go on about the MSM but spend all day just tweeting links to articles, complaining, and telling us things we all already know.  If we want freedom from it, it has to start by removing MSM from our lives completely.
1328663796957794304 2020-11-17 19:38:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> Reminder that when asked to condemn Garda (Irish police) brutality against anti-lockdown protesters, Justin Barrett of @nationalpartyIE insulted then blocked me.  Neither he nor anyone in the group will criticise the enforcers of the 'lockdown'.  NP are after power, not freedom!
1328660867097964545 2020-11-17 19:26:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> "Peaceful &amp; legal means"... but our enemies are not bound by any such qualms.  The police illegally and violently assault people, without consequence.  Is it fair for the side which already boasts overwhelming resources/financial superiority to also have this advantage?
1328649769305174016 2020-11-17 18:42:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 I know what you mean.  But I can't emphasise enough, the only freedom to be found, I believe, is outside the system, as much as possible, with a view to entirely outside eventually.  The MSM is not going to fall. We need to create our own parallel system, independent of theirs.
1328476019800633347 2020-11-17 07:12:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Not all of us... there is a way to be free of it completely, and in doing so attain the only freedom it's possible to have...
1328365526020747264 2020-11-16 23:53:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @KayJaySings @LordBrexit The fact is you are not free if you live in establishment 'society', no matter what legal protections you claim.  This year has shown even those who hadn't seen before, that the #globalist #NWO can do as it pleases with no consequences.  Get out of the system while you still can.
1328315494680702979 2020-11-16 20:34:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @tuffy_sir @NeilClark66 Of course it's not easy, not everyone is in a position to do so - but freeing oneself from the #globalist #NWO system is not easy. It takes determination and courage.  Feel free to get in touch any time if you need advice or encouragement - we all have to stick together!
1328314481202634752 2020-11-16 20:30:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @tuffy_sir @NeilClark66 There's an easy way out of that - don't live in the city. I got out years ago.  If we want freedom, we have to make it ourselves, and accept that to be truly free is a lonely place to be since most people want to be part of the herd, not liberation.
1328047419385319424 2020-11-16 02:49:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @CitizenIre I think you're right. People will be so 'grateful' to be allowed to have any kind of Christmas, they will be softened up for anything.  Good to know we can rely on you when the time comes, as it surely will - the more good people we can involve, the better.
1328044399117410305 2020-11-16 02:37:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @CitizenIre Well, exactly.  If you had told people a year ago what 'freedoms' they'd have given up by Dec. 2020 they'd have said "it'll never happen" - but it did.  It is one tiny step from where we are, to concentration camps. We need to get out while we still can.
1328038598357241856 2020-11-16 02:14:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @CitizenIre For example, I know for a fact that it is entirely possible to avoid paying certain 'taxes', if certain procedures are followed.  As well as this, it is imperative that only trustworthy people are involved.
1328034491001090049 2020-11-16 01:57:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @CitizenIre It depends on how realistic a definition of 'freely' we're willing to accept at first - it could work, in stages.  I think the key is to do the opposite of what most people's default is today - that is, not advertise it beyond the key people, remain under the radar for now.
1327999622380457984 2020-11-15 23:39:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @CitizenIre We can leave society without leaving the world entirely... it is nearly as difficult a decision to make for most people, who cannot imagine a life outside the establishment.  But for those of us who can see that establishment for what it is, it ought to be an easy one.
1327998643467677696 2020-11-15 23:35:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael29253169 We all know why it is happening... but do not forget that so-called 'kosher' slaughter is equally barbaric, but because of a certain group's control of the media, no-one ever talks about that fact.
1327962388591763456 2020-11-15 21:11:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @hampsteadchap I don't blame you... I just couldn't believe anyone could say something so stupid (you'd think I would have learned by now... ). It's beyond belief, people actually proud of their cowardice and submission to 'government' oppression.
1327961897321328641 2020-11-15 21:09:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski "We all know who they are" - exactly right.  That's the one thing everyone must remember above all else - every problem we face comes back to them in the end.
1327729013243195393 2020-11-15 05:43:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @hampsteadchap No you don't, not like that walking cliché @hampsteadchap... have you see that creature's profile?  Every 'globalist' catchphrase in the book.  Keep fighting the good fight! Your courage is an inspiration to many.  #plademichoax #hoaxvirus #SCAMDEMIC2020
1327439885972725761 2020-11-14 10:35:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights I am genuinely sorry to hear this and I can sympathise, in that I know if my job required that of me I would be in exactly the same situation.  If you find yourself truly in desperation, get in touch directly. We have to start helping each other if we are to create a new system.
1327421433484627968 2020-11-14 09:21:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AurelianNights That point is now.  There are many examples of people who've had enough setting an example for others to follow.  Those who feel they can't make any positive contribution - remember there are things you can do which will lead the way for others, and ensure your deeds live on.
1327420867014504448 2020-11-14 09:19:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Billyth14474955 @AurelianNights It's already started. Get in touch if you'd like to know more!
1327373109129830400 2020-11-14 06:09:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Exactly.  People's only 'argument' for the existence of 'coronavirus' is: "The government and media told me it's true."  That is literally all they've got.  The same government and media who are so renowned for telling the truth about everything else...
1327369393576304640 2020-11-14 05:54:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 What a surprise - nobody died. Because... there is no virus.  My own family keep repeating: "the numbers" are up, everybody panic! Their response when I ask if anyone they know has been hospitalised or died: silence.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #SCAMDEMIC2020
1326930683990839302 2020-11-13 00:51:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> No co-operation – no compromise.  The system cannot be reformed.  It must be replaced.  #nationalism #replacementmigration #thegreatreplacement #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #SCAMDEMIC2020
1326913547192963083 2020-11-12 23:43:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Anthony15382684 @MailOnline Of course it will. Nothing that any establishment 'EU' politician does is helpful to our cause, no matter how tempting it is to believe that they are on our side with measures such as this.  Anything the #globalist #NWO does has scope to be abused - Austria included.
1326658035104747521 2020-11-12 06:48:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SUSPICIOUSsMIND @Pavlos80322302 Great. Feel free to get in touch if you have any thoughts or comments - we are trying to create a collaborative community with results, and just because you may disagree with some aspects doesn't mean we can't work together on others, as long as the overall goal is the same.
1326603107229446146 2020-11-12 03:10:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SUSPICIOUSsMIND @Pavlos80322302 Great. Please check it out when you have time and get back to me by DM or e-mail, we're making moves towards what you describe.
1326599996146376704 2020-11-12 02:57:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SUSPICIOUSsMIND @Pavlos80322302 If you're serious about that, please check out my website at  https://t.co/S15NaVRTYq. What I am proposing is, as you alluded to, a secular vision with some things in common with the Amish method. Currently focused on Ireland/n. Europe/Germany.
1326534144122261512 2020-11-11 22:36:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> Yes, this time by the 'Gardaí' under orders from British 'commissioner' Harris.  So you have the 'left' Sinn Féin, and the 'right' @nationalpartyIE, both supporting the Irish police.  NP is just like SF - trying to become part of, rather than seeking to change, the system.
1326530076171628550 2020-11-11 22:19:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> Look at what j** 'news' network 'Reuters' is reporting; surprise, surprise, just like 'LGBT', those who go along with this all have mental problems:   https://t.co/WLNvTYgPxW
1326289626814877701 2020-11-11 06:24:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael29253169 That's a term I happily and unashamedly use, to describe the so-called deputy prime minister of Ireland @LeoVaradkar, for example.  If the #globalist #NWO media has a problem with it, then you know it's the right thing to do.
1326238385892110342 2020-11-11 03:00:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> Everything is wrong with this.  The 'corona' lies - the poppy fascism - the promotion of brain-rotting tabloid trash on brain-rotting television.  Anyone who takes their 'news' from the likes of these two deserves everything they get.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #scamdemic
1326223297273606144 2020-11-11 02:00:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> Imagine if the police chief in Gaza was an '#Israeli' j** whose father had been killed by Hamas. Palestinians would not allow it.  The police chief in Ireland is an English settler whose father was killed by the IRA... and @nationalpartyIE defends those who obey his orders!
1326204979623944192 2020-11-11 00:48:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @4leafclover76 No.
1325937268759142401 2020-11-10 07:04:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaddyWagon3 @ColmanOfGuaire True words, and I fear you are correct about how much more suffering there is to come before anything like a large-scale realisation could happen.  But hope remains, as long as a vanguard keeps the flame of sanity and decency burning.
1325936728889303048 2020-11-10 07:02:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski I'll be in touch soon, stay strong friend.
1325927407510024194 2020-11-10 06:25:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaddyWagon3 @ColmanOfGuaire Agreed re. banking, and IMO anyone who trusts Trump is as foolish as anyone who trusts Biden.  The fact that we are even discussing this shows how effective the deep state distraction techniques are - the 'election' is a sideshow, and everyone expends energy discussing it.
1325926819011436545 2020-11-10 06:22:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire Yes but most people are wrong. That may sound simplistic but it is true; if the wisdom of the herd was to be trusted, society would be no better off than it is now.  People are given information indicating otherwise, all the time - but most dismiss those informing them.
1325926316366032899 2020-11-10 06:20:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire And in mine, everyone can see that voting is rigged and democracy is a sham; yet reality remains unchanged. A mass awakening, a political salvation, will not happen under 'democracy'.  One ought to despair for society in general; but at a local level, things can be done.
1325925705281118209 2020-11-10 06:18:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Exactly right.  Endless complaining isn't helping either, beyond serving as an outlet for people's understandable frustration.  That's why some of us are organising offline also. Will get in touch if that's something that interests you.
1325872311975759872 2020-11-10 02:46:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> "the people who control America"... that is, your tribe..?
1325868694082293760 2020-11-10 02:31:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SUSPICIOUSsMIND @LordBrexit @Joannew68022274 That's right... in fact, the oppressor encourages people to waste their time in 'demonstrating', knowing full well that after a round of dealing with the police etc. most will go home and congratulate themselves for having 'done something' - while in fact nothing changes.
1325868279089537024 2020-11-10 02:30:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @the__dullahan @kelly_justkel @Tacochip1 Exactly right - and as you point out, 'genocides' everywhere else in the world we hear about relentlessly, but those who support Palestine are labelled 'anti-semites'.  They can call me what they want - such a term is merely a badge of honour.
1325855638665236480 2020-11-10 01:39:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @colin_mac_hale @ColmanOfGuaire That's great news - every convert is a success.  The problem is just that for most people, it is just too easy - and has been designed to be - to fall back into old habits once the 'crisis' is 'over'.   Many people will be sucked back into MSM/voting even after 'waking up'.
1325847950468247553 2020-11-10 01:09:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly - so don't use banks.  Equally - don't vote.  There is a way to be free of their systems, but it requires sacrifice.
1325845900527345669 2020-11-10 01:01:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> Any 'nationalist' celebrating a single word that comes out of this foreign, #Zionist stooge's mouth is misguided, to say the least.   An immigrant telling the British people of the passing of an Immigration Bill? Beyond satire.  Englanders - take your country back!
1325844893999239168 2020-11-10 00:57:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @colin_mac_hale @ColmanOfGuaire "Mainstream Media and Government Corruption" exposure has been there to see from day one to anyone who wants to see it.  Trump or Biden, obvious vote fraud or hidden, the 1% will continue to rule and the rest to follow.  Predictions of mass awakenings are wide of the mark, IMO.
1325844336597213192 2020-11-10 00:54:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire My point is that if you believe anything will change on a macro level as a result of this, you will be disappointed.  Anyone with a brain can see that democracy is fixed, and those without them will continue to participate in the sham.
1325835668120068097 2020-11-10 00:20:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire No it doesn't, but they are all the same, and it is a distraction.  Democracy itself is rigged, and no matter which candidate is (s)elected, the 1% benefits while the 99% follows, bickers and is divided.  IMO, voting at all is perpetuating the enemy's system.
1325803582168457216 2020-11-09 22:13:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> @the__dullahan @IrishBehemoth @kelly_justkel @Tacochip1 Agree 100%.  It's a pity that it is such people we must defend; but to abandon Palestine is to abandon the world, for we all have the same enemy in the form of the other so-called 'religion'.  Let Palestinians stay in Palestine, and out of Europe. All problems solved.
1325801506982014977 2020-11-09 22:04:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @the__dullahan @kelly_justkel @Tacochip1 Both good points.  As for Palestine, the founder of the PFLP was a Christian - solidarity with Palestine is a nationalist issue, not a religious one.  I loathe their 'religious' beliefs, but completely support their right as natives of their land to resist invasion.
1325800381759238144 2020-11-09 22:00:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @History_Thieves @LordBrexit @Joannew68022274 I agree with the latter part of your post; but doing things according to the 'law' of the oppressor is not something to be admired, in my opinion.  You don't thank a man for giving you back what is yours.  You don't gain freedom by observing the rules of the enemy.  Otherwise,👌
1325772242559651840 2020-11-09 20:08:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CitizenIre Yes... I think we all know which one I'm referring to.  You're right, strange isn't it, how the 25 rule/'social distancing' etc. doesn't apply to the 'police' and yet no-one else seems to be bothered about that..?  This fight doesn't end yet, even if 'coronavirus' does.

But you must remember, the 'police' can and do, do as they please, regardless of what papers you serve.  They are there to enforce the will of the 1%, as are judges. You cannot take back freedom you never had.  Revolution, not demonstrations.

I thought it might be a genuine glitch but it has persisted for days, and complaining to support would only result in drawing more attention to my account.

1324462315836682242 2020-11-06 05:23:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @mattsdomino I'm not saying it's easy or that I have all the answers. But we have to try something, and something radical.  They already own all the land - no-one owns the home they live in, try withholding property tax and you find out quickly who the real owner is.  It's one step at a time.
1324456049227816960 2020-11-06 04:58:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @mattsdomino and by the way your tax resistance strategy, in my opinion, is absolutely central to all this. That's something else I can honestly say I am no hypocrite about; all taxation is theft, especially in the present circumstances when people lose their freedom in return.
1324454279948677122 2020-11-06 04:51:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @mattsdomino Throughout first 'lockdown', was able to go out every day in fresh air, away from masks and police; even drive where I chose without questioning.  Alone, that's just escapism; but if we all have a loose association and help each other where we can, that's the start of a system.
1324453735469359105 2020-11-06 04:49:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @mattsdomino True. It has always informed my thinking; I knew from an early age one day we'd be forced to make a choice, and few years ago bought small house&amp;plot in woods.  Not fully self-sufficient yet, it's a process; but already so much freer than those living in cities.
1324452570572738566 2020-11-06 04:44:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @mattsdomino @leannemac4 The question is, why would anybody want to stay in 'civilisation', given what it has become?  They keep talking about The Great Reset - but the only way our national heritages and cultures can survive their reset, is a reset of our own.  We have to reject establishment society.
1324049292709998594 2020-11-05 02:02:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Yes, this is true - but many of the greatest European cities in terms of culture and history (specifically German and Austrian) have also become no-go zones.  Point taken re. US - I suppose we Europeans have to some extent taken our heritages for granted.
1324042859507556352 2020-11-05 01:36:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Interestingly everyone I know who came from there originally and left, never wants to return.  I can't imagine how bad it must be if even Europe today is preferable. But then there is no white country left on Earth which hasn't been destroyed.

Barrett obv. approved this before his wife sent it - what does that say about his commitment to leading a serious movement?  He also supports lockdown enforcers.
1323985611431305218 2020-11-04 21:49:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 The fact is that most of humanity isn't worth saving, people have proven that time and again, most recently by welcoming their 'confinement'.  However, we can't let the parasite 1% win - otherwise I would totally be on board with a 'who cares what happens?' approach.
1323977262228787206 2020-11-04 21:15:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> All true.  But using a ((('US' entertainment))) show to illustrate your point damages your credibility.  Who do you think is benefiting from the 'lockdown'? The same people brainwashing and pacifying people with this nonsense.

I replied "How about, no 'lockdown', and the government has no say in where people go or what they do?". No response.  We can't undo their brainwashing.

Endlessly complaining about politicians, rightly saying "they're all the same", but voting anyway.  I at least know I'm not part of that problem - have never voted.
1323971543949520898 2020-11-04 20:53:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @karlwizowski Well said.  There is no political salvation. The kind of leader who could change things would never be permitted to succeed by the #globalist #NWO.  Small-scale collaborative communities, operating away from the spotlight, are the only hope for now.

But our struggle is the same as theirs - we are both fighting against the j***** #globalist #NWO.  Whites are losing their lands, as Palestinians are losing theirs. It's a nationalist issue, not religious; the founder of the PFLP was Christian.
1323676000987860994 2020-11-04 01:18:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrexitFreedom Right - we all know that. It takes guts to admit it. But what is IFP planning to do about it?  Not vague politics-speak like 'assess the situation' - you know what I mean, and will IFP have the courage to do it?
1323663998995304454 2020-11-04 00:31:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BackShadys @NationalPartyIE @CeannaireNP Yes, my thoughts exactly!
1323653954232852480 2020-11-03 23:51:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BackShadys @NationalPartyIE @CeannaireNP Agreed. Level 5 is exactly the time for protest - protest should be ongoing, every day, not just a one-off event that the NP then uses to bolster its 'anti-establishment' position.  In reality, Barrett doesn't want to upset the Dáil because he so desperately wants to be in it.
1323650229766397952 2020-11-03 23:36:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BackShadys Well @nationalpartyIE claims to oppose the lockdown, but it supports the police; and by supporting the enforcers, it therefore supports the lockdown.  Still waiting for any NP reps. to condemn police brutality against protesters. Asked @ceannaireNP to do so and he blocked me.

All we need is a condemnation of the police, NP. Why won't you?
1323638054834343936 2020-11-03 22:47:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> Daily reminder:  queues to enter supermarkets, long cited by rabid supporters of capitalism as a way of demonising socialism, are now a daily feature of life in the UK and elsewhere... under capitalism.  Two sides of the same coin. A third way is needed. We all know what that is.
1323637583793037315 2020-11-03 22:46:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> Daily reminder:  'voting' changes nothing.

1323558207944597504 2020-11-03 17:30:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard @CeannaireNP @NationalPartyIE The same protest at which Barrett praised the cops, and of which 'Critiqued' and Mr Dwyer all said "the Gardaí did a fine job"?  Mr Dwyer is the only one who hasn't insulted/blocked me for pointing out how much Barrett worships state power.
1323366477169348608 2020-11-03 04:48:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard @CeannaireNP @NationalPartyIE Point me to where they have done this, please.  Why would they block me and insult me rather than simply say 'yes, they were wrong and that needs to be addressed'?  I have seen no evidence, all I have seen is senior NP figures repeatedly praise the police.
1323343964171341826 2020-11-03 03:19:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard @CeannaireNP Just supports the lockdown police so far, more like.  Barrett wants to be part of the establishment so much it's desperate.  He and all but one @nationalpartyIE figures have blocked me rather than condemn the Gardaí's brutality against protesters.  Well @ceannaireNP?
1323330193751158790 2020-11-03 02:24:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> You know who'd love this?  @nationalpartyIE and its leader, Justin Barrett (#ceannaireNP). They are so desperate to be part of the Dáil establishment that they still haven't condemned police brutality against anti-lockdown protesters, yet still claim to stand for freedom. Liars.

As soon as Germany was defeated in WW2, it was clear that the blond, blue-eyed ideal was on the list for the #globalist #NWO to destroy.  Those of us with both, are 5% of the population - we are the minority, but are called the aggressor.

1322249585654452225 2020-10-31 02:50:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski You'd like to think so, but then conscience is just the fear of getting caught.  As long as they think they can continue getting away with it, they will - and they have the j***** establishment on their side.  Even if this ends, another outrage won't be far behind - stay alert!
1322226087271780353 2020-10-31 01:17:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> We all know what the problems are. We all know why they are occurring. We all know who is responsible.  There is no point in simply reacting on Twitter to every outrage.  We can do something right now, but it doesn't involve 'voting'. Decide for yourself what, or DM to discuss.
1322220215560740864 2020-10-31 00:53:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> Macron is doing nothing to stop m****** from arriving in France. Defending the right of French people to mock them won't help when they're confronted with the next knife/truck/bomb.  Macron is a Rothschild banker, doing the bidding of the j***.  We won't find heroes in the EU.

1322202309431070720 2020-10-30 23:42:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ArcticDemon1933 Yes, this is true.  But as with the police and govt. Google only has the power people choose to give it.  In this case, it is simple to opt out - don't use a smartphone. Do not use any of Google's services.  Use alternatives such as Tor, Linux and DuckDuckGo.  Every little helps.

All it takes, NP, is a condemnation of the police. Why won't you do it?  Because you want to be part of the establishment?
1322190820288745478 2020-10-30 22:57:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @shazdeven That's right.  So many now complicit in their own destruction. At least under past tyrannies, one was either for or against the oppressor - now ppl watch Netflix and pornography and vote for govt., then complain when this happens.  It's all connected. Reject establishment!
1322178775719813120 2020-10-30 22:09:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @shazdeven That's partly my point - constant reference to the so-called 'evils' of the past is irrelevant, we are facing the worst oppression imaginable right now.
1322160930193629186 2020-10-30 20:58:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> We should all rightly oppose the outrages being perpetrated against us by the #globalist #NWO.  But it is not 'the Fourth Reich' as described in the document.  If a Fourth German Reich existed, the current system, controlled by j***, would not.  Stop using the 'Nazi' slur.
1322129833778962432 2020-10-30 18:54:51 +0800 <JenDesNor> This is all accurate, but it must always be added that the m****** in Europe are only here because another so-called 'religion', and we all know which one, brought them here for its own ends.  Both must be opposed.  #nationalism
1322129035313451009 2020-10-30 18:51:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @gafitna Now who's joking?  The word is 'heroine' in its feminine form, but totally inapplicable in this case. She and Hans Scholl were given multiple opportunities to cease their anti-German activity but failed to do so.  A coward and a traitor.
1322111776406835200 2020-10-30 17:43:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @hallo_meinung That's the problem - too many people opposing m****** flooding into Europe, without questioning how and why it is happening.  There is no point in opposing m****** without also opposing j***s.  #replacementmigration
1322111242270625793 2020-10-30 17:40:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @gafitna Sophie Scholl was no German, she was a traitor.
1321887681023037445 2020-10-30 02:52:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski @CentralCookie Fair play to you.  I had similar in Eason's a while back, some black guy mumbling at me from behind a mask - I couldn't even understand what he was saying.  Took a long time for him to back down though. What is wrong with these people?  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #scamdemic
1321871015081840640 2020-10-30 01:46:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Jennife76650817 @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE Right... and some have revealed that they are not up to the task (@nationalpartyIE @ceannaireNP)...
1321867405409374209 2020-10-30 01:32:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Jennife76650817 @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE I gathered as much from your TL, and that's fine - I'm not endorsing either, just want what's best for Ireland/Europe.   But increasingly @nationalpartyIE is revealing itself as on the side of the establishment, while ACI at least is prepared to fight the powers that be.
1321866824917651456 2020-10-30 01:29:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Jennife76650817 @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE Even without being an NP supporter, all should be disgusted - I asked Justin Barrett (@ceannaireNP) directly to condemn it and he insulted, then blocked, me.  That's the kind of person NP wants in charge - incapable of even defending his position.
1321852964303228929 2020-10-30 00:34:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @gerrywebster I'd like to think that you're right and this is what would happen... but the experiences of the past few years have shown that the #globalist #NWO can basically do as it pleases and people will comply.  It is time to operate outside the system - back to the days of hedge schools.
1321845649042800641 2020-10-30 00:05:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> It's much, much worse than pathetic.  Such 'crimes' could not be prosecuted without police officers willing to arrest people for what they say. As ever, cops have the power to stop this from happening - but they won't. When was the last time you saw a cop think for itself?
1321829422224191488 2020-10-29 23:01:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @martinh99448555 @HBiggus 'Elections' are exactly the problem.  Research deep state/controlled opposition - they exist to give people the illusion that they have any say in their fates.  At least openly totalitarian systems are honest. In the West ppl waste their whole lives 'voting', and nothing changes.
1321821688565276675 2020-10-29 22:30:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @DrAdamAneevit Everyone being purposely obtuse here?  Today, what happened in Nice, is the reminder. The virus is a certain 'religion', which is taking over the world thanks to the machinations of another certain 'religion', which is using the former for its own purposes.  Both must be opposed.
1321809151002091520 2020-10-29 21:40:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @emam_aw @jyrkikononen Your opinion has no legitimacy, parasite.  A white man ought to have no say in what happens in Arab countries.  You have no say in what happens here.
1321808399965786113 2020-10-29 21:37:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @BasedBitch2 'No respect for us', is the truth I believe.  The fact is that neither m****** nor the j*** responsible for bringing them here, belong in Europe.  These atrocities will continue as long as either remains.  We've got to ensure liberated zones exist within the chaos.
1321804989577240576 2020-10-29 21:24:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @jyrkikononen Yes agreed, but we also must never forget which other 'religion' is responsible for bringing Islam to Europe.  Neither of them belongs here!  #nationalism
1321801418525843457 2020-10-29 21:09:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pinefrequency Yes, he is.  I just meant that I am not surprised to see this; what all m****** have in common is that they are more loyal to their 'religion' than to their nations, so prime minister or not it is what I expect.  He is proof that we are at war.
1321800982284673024 2020-10-29 21:08:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ArcticDemon1933 This is true.  We can't stop it happening on a macro scale around the world.  But it is up to us to preserve our glorious traditions and culture. We are the vanguard now, the resistance. It's all up to us.
1321796869106864128 2020-10-29 20:51:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pinefrequency We all know that's a lie.  More important is this: isn't 'Twitter' supposed to ban accounts which glorify or call for violence?  Not when that violence is directed against white people, of course.  Never forget we're using the enemy's platform, here.
1321795891607539712 2020-10-29 20:47:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> France is the same country that fines and imprisons people for 'disrespecting' Islam (Brigitte Bardot, for example).  Nothing j€w-appeaser Macron says has any meaning.  Voting doesn't win wars. Action does.  And you don't need anyone's permission to take action.
1321787999156318208 2020-10-29 20:16:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Right - and he accuses others of "ignorance" and "abuse", when he dismisses others' points of view as "idiocy" and tells them to "f*ck off".  Looks like @piersmorgan is really confident of his position when he has to resort to name-calling and profanity.
1321773824686379009 2020-10-29 19:20:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ArcticDemon1933 They don't sit by and watch - they are the ones bringing those creatures in. They are not passive, they are the ones doing it.  This is a war, anyone can see that now - and you don't win a war by 'voting'.  #nationalism #replacementmigration
1321752391839109126 2020-10-29 17:55:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE Seriously, that is a false claim - I am not promoting ACI and you know it. I am pointing out that their stance on the 'Gardaí', which is the enemy of the Irish people, is correct, and that NP's is wrong.  You can't make such claims without explaining yourself.
1321750935211835395 2020-10-29 17:49:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE That and its ongoing defence of the 'Gardaí', which it still maintains with no disclaimer.
1321750766953123842 2020-10-29 17:48:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE And 'unfollowing' me because of this issue is similar to what I'm talking about with NP. We are all on the same side, ultimately, but this total refusal to consider other points of view is what will be NP's undoing.
1321750395065126912 2020-10-29 17:47:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE Not at all.  I just said, ACI is not perfect and it's certainly not Ireland's saviour.  But my attacks on NP are not 'bizarre'. All they have to do is address the issue, but instead all but one of them block me. They are incapable of explaining their positions.
1321744835854950400 2020-10-29 17:25:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> Daily reminder that @nationalpartyIE supports Gardaí (Irish police) brutality against unarmed native Irish anti-lockdown protesters - any reps. want to prove me wrong?  ACI is not perfect but at least its stance on the 'free state' footsoldiers is correct.  #nationalism
1321744358211751937 2020-10-29 17:23:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> Daily reminder that under the so-called 'Nazis', no German citizen was ever told they could not meet family/friends, placed under curfew, forced to wear a muzzle or deprived of their freedom of movement.  Under all Western governments today, that's what's happening. #hoaxvirus
1321743242984116225 2020-10-29 17:18:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ih8evrybdy That's exactly the idea...
1321528364943855616 2020-10-29 03:04:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Scifo76943185 Right - in Ireland and some other places people are just complying.  This oppression can only last as long as people accept it - the so-called 'police' only have the power that people allow them to have.
1321518290703929344 2020-10-29 02:24:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE ... those I disagree with out of hand, when the end goal remains the same. You try your way, and I'll try mine, and a wise man ought to be willing to see which way the wind is blowing and accommodate his approach accordingly.
1321517995475275778 2020-10-29 02:23:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE In my opinion, a realist, is the answer to that question. I'm not expecting a large-scale undoing of the wrongs facing us, but IMO it is clear that hoping for a mass awakening is just that - hope.  We may differ on fundamentals but unlike NP and others, I don't reject...
1321515587206524933 2020-10-29 02:14:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE ... by which I mean, the rot is too deep, in my view, to be stopped and the patient ('society') saved. I believe a more radical approach is the only option other than helplessly watching as fresh hells are unleashed.
1321515096464646148 2020-10-29 02:12:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE Exactly - yet another reason to regard them with nothing but contempt, the police I mean.  The others are cowards yes, but without stooges willing to serve them they would remain just that, and no danger to anyone.  As for writing off whole sections of society, I'm all for that.
1321510333010370565 2020-10-29 01:53:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE and strictly speaking, I'd have to say those who carry it out are more to blame. Evil schemes would remain only schemes, not reality, without the enforcers - throughout history every injustice relies on force alone, but unlike in former times, the cops today could simply resign.
1321509944298999810 2020-10-29 01:51:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE Again, I agree wholeheartedly - and as I am one of the few who is blameless for the state of things, I have no sympathy for voters, civil servants, cops, media or pols.  Yes, cops just do the 'dirty work' - but again, that is the work without which there could be no oppression.
1321501855650926593 2020-10-29 01:19:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @ih8evrybdy @rtenews What do you care?  Your precious 'Gardaí' are too busy beating innocent people and confining ordinary men and women to their homes to solve actual crimes.  As long as they protect you and your 'protests' you'll turn a blind eye to everything else, right?
1321500432745832448 2020-10-29 01:13:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE I agree 100% that it isn't morally different - that's why I have never voted, because the globalist system wants ppl to participate in the charade.  The only diff. is that civil servants etc. aren't physically beating and confining ppl - the police are. They could choose not to.
1321497479217664006 2020-10-29 01:02:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE Yes but they know when they sign up that they will be required to serve a #globalist #NWO 'government'. They are not conscripts.  IMO the police are worse than the government, since the latter depends on them to carry out their oppression. They have a choice in all this.
1321496990958653445 2020-10-29 01:00:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE Increasingly, everything he says is cringeworthy - he has been given opportunity time and again to speak out against police brutality and just won't do it.  He represents that strand of 'nationalism' that wants to continue the status quo, but with them in power.
1321496446059876352 2020-10-29 00:57:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @danielbakersf Blame their parents, who are willing to risk their children's lives in a bid to be given free housing, money and healthcare paid for by native Europeans' taxes.  It's Western military action that causes 'refugees'. Stop bombing them if you want to solve the problem.
1321490548386074624 2020-10-29 00:34:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @jui9091 Exactly right.  Which is why it is absurd to see the likes of @nationalpartyIE extract money from people, convincing them that one day all will be well if they just vote NP.  The system cannot be reformed from inside.  We must operate outside it.
1321490104557441025 2020-10-29 00:32:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @NationalPartyIE I'm not defending the likes of Murphy, but it is fortunate that power-worshipper J. Barrett will never be Taoiseach - he appears to think that if he keeps the police 'onside' they will one day become his private army.  There is far too much deference to 'authority' on the right.
1321487664386887680 2020-10-29 00:23:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> The one thing "lefty cop-haters" are right about is the corruption of the police, in Ireland more than anywhere.  Gemma O'D's example should be followed by those on the right - not @NationalPartyIE's, who blocked me when I asked them to condemn police brutality last weekend.
1321469036845289473 2020-10-28 23:09:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> Do you ever wonder how all of your family and friends who are so terrified of catching 'the virus' are going to feel, and behave, when inevitably they have to admit that #COVID19 doesn't exist?  That no-one they know caught it, or died?  I don't know if we should forgive them.
1321462384075116544 2020-10-28 22:42:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'Obey - consume - conform - stay asleep'.  'They Live' is like a blueprint for what has unfolded; and we all know who the 'aliens' are in real life.  #plandemichoax #hoaxvirus #scamdemic2020 #Covid_19
1321461619021459456 2020-10-28 22:39:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> For those in English-speaking countries who don't realise the significance of this: Ursula Haverbeck has been repeatedly convicted and imprisoned by the so-called 'Federal Republic of Germany' for holding a view which differs from the 'official' narrative.  Heroine.  #freespeech
1321450092344320000 2020-10-28 21:53:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael87802510 @Pox_Populi2 Two of those are good examples, yes, of a homogeneous national population, and genetic nationalism is the only real nationalism.  The other is not a legitimate country, and in fact is the enemy of all indigenous peoples since it works tirelessly to subvert them.
1321449561123147778 2020-10-28 21:51:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Dr_DildoFaggins @CeannaireNP @NationalPartyIE And this is the kind of creature @nationalpartyIE is aligning itself with - both refuse to condemn Irish police brutality.
1321449127851544577 2020-10-28 21:49:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Agreed, but those powerful evil forces are human in nature - well, if you can call the beings in question, 'human' - and resistance against them has to come also from us.  Real-world resistance, and mental comfort from philosophy and the examples of our heroes. That's how I cope.
1321440366059552769 2020-10-28 21:15:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 I've always thought religion is a personal matter.  And for me personally, nationalism is all the religion I need. Philosophising about god or gods is fascinating and useful, but IMO a supernatural force is not needed to say what's right and wrong.
1321439056774025218 2020-10-28 21:09:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @StickyRicky3 Neat reply, completely avoiding any of the issues I raised and responding with a children's cartoon.  Just read your bio., and for that reason: blocked.
1321432184134258688 2020-10-28 20:42:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> @StickyRicky3 A 'free country'?  Good joke.  The funny thing about those who defend US society is that they really believe the lie that they are free... like paying 'taxes' on property that you own, for the rest of your life, is 'freedom'!
1321431455000649729 2020-10-28 20:39:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 And, laughably, he is 'Minister for Justice' and a minister in the so-called 'Scottish National Party'.  People get what they deserve. Why though would anyone want to live in #globalist #NWO society?  The world is worth living in, but establishment society isn't.
1321385658515103746 2020-10-28 17:37:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MrTardigradeUK @ih8evrybdy They probably don't, but that doesn't mean I should have sympathy for their situation. No-one taught me to see through establishment lies - I worked it out for myself, even though all around me continued to believe.  The police therefore are either stupid, or evil.
1321187111366787074 2020-10-28 04:28:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MrTardigradeUK @ih8evrybdy But that's something people need to consider before they have a family, get a mortgage etc. - you cannot have principles and serve a #globalist #NWO government, which is what all police officers do.  It isn't ethical to provide for your family by oppressing your countrymen.
1321186361576202241 2020-10-28 04:25:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ih8evrybdy @MrTardigradeUK Exactly right. I have lost a job in the past because I wouldn't work for a company that had a pro-'Israel' think-tank as a client.  You either have principles, or you don't - the police don't. None of them. If they did, they would resign.
1321185975385661446 2020-10-28 04:24:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MrTardigradeUK @ih8evrybdy Funny how the 'just following orders' defence doesn't ever apply to German soldiers in WW2, for example - yet they could have been shot for refusing.  And yes, I have lost a job over a point of principle in the past.  The police don't have to do it - they could find another job.
1321180981236289538 2020-10-28 04:04:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MrTardigradeUK @ih8evrybdy Right.  But if/when this is all over, do not forget those police who enforced it to begin with, even if they changed their minds later on... and do not forgive them.  No-one forced them to do this, they are not conscripts. They must be held accountable.
1321177419492065283 2020-10-28 03:50:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NationalPartyIE @RebBarrettNP I am used to being blocked by NP followers who are incapable of arguing their points; but now #JustinBarrett himself, @ceannaireNP, tweets an insult at me then blocks me before I can reply!  Total inability to defend their positions.
1321175508969791490 2020-10-28 03:42:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> New low from @nationalpartyIE. I am used to being blocked by its mindless followers who are incapable of arguing their points; but now #JustinBarrett himself, @ceannaireNP, tweets an insult at me then blocks me before I can reply!  Total inability to defend their positions.
1321171681789071364 2020-10-28 03:27:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @CeannaireNP @NationalPartyIE Hilarious! You're back.  Proud of your 'free state' footsoldiers after last weekend?  Condemn them if you are a nationalist.  Are you really the best spokesperson the @NationalPartyIE can summon? @ceannaireNP, are you happy to be represented by this neanderthal?
1321151200465747974 2020-10-28 02:06:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CMOIreland Hi Tony  That's right, too many people with minds of their own who don't blindly follow the commands of unelected bureaucrats and 'politicians'.  I'm spreading 'the virus' all over the place, according to you, and haven't used hand sanitiser nor a mask. I will continue doing so.
1321148101378400257 2020-10-28 01:53:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CeannaireNP If you understand only one thing about protests against lockdown, it's that @ceannaireNP and @NationalPartyIE have not yet issued a condemnation of the so-called 'Gardaí''s actions last weekend when unarmed Irish people were beaten.  Well Ceannaire? Still defending them?
1321144929628889090 2020-10-28 01:41:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> It's not fantastic.  It's a waste of time. Nothing will change just because they complain. And incidentally, appeasement of so-called 'LGBT' minorities such as Starkey goes hand-in-hand with the open borders madness he claims to oppose.  The system cannot be changed from within.
1321125271848865794 2020-10-28 00:23:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> @russmerne Your neighbours, and the 'Gardaí', are your enemies then... the one thing this crisis has done is show us who is on the right side and who isn't.  There can be no grey area, no half-measures; the state, the establishment and all who support them are the adversary.  #nationalism
1321124545344974850 2020-10-28 00:20:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @russmerne Fiona Flanagan belongs to the 1% by her own admission; Trump's daughter is another.  Left or right, Republican or Democrat, the #globalist #NWO benefits regardless of who wins the 'election'.  It's time to rally against the true enemy!
1321119624495333376 2020-10-28 00:00:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> World War Two and the victory of the #globalist #NWO, also known as the j€ws.  That is what happened.  If you want to return to how things were, you know what to do.
1321100907266953216 2020-10-27 22:46:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @dolorescahill5 Exactly. So the term you used in the original tweet does not describe our enemy today; rather, if N.S. had been victorious in 1945, none of this would be happening.  There are plenty of names to call #globalist #NWO scum like O'Gorman - 'Nazis' is an inaccurate description IMO.
1321043987713712128 2020-10-27 19:00:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NationalPartyIE supporters call those who suggest alternatives to their pro-establishment strategy, 'LARPers' - but these same people describe themselves as 'Professors' at a non-existent organisation laughably named 'Patriot Analytica'.  #nationalism is not a children's game.
1321043487027007489 2020-10-27 18:58:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> As if they have no capacity for independent thought!  These people are not conscripts, they choose to join and serve the #globalist #NWO government.  Police and government are two sides of the same coin and both are your enemy!  #plandemichoax #scamdemic2020
1321041929451307014 2020-10-27 18:51:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 Exactly, and with the same deleterious effects on health.
1321041805975212033 2020-10-27 18:51:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> Still waiting for a condemnation of the so-called 'Gardaí' from @NationalPartyIE or any of its representatives, following the brutal assault on unarmed demonstrators last weekend.  So is it only NP events like #letirelandlive you care about? Other patriots don't matter?
1321041298678317056 2020-10-27 18:49:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NationalPartyIE supporters call those who propose more effective solutions than voting, 'LARPers'... but these same people all describe themselves as 'Professors' at the 'Patriot Analytica' 'think-tank' which exists only on Twitter!  They need to realise #nationalism is serious.
1321038417585709056 2020-10-27 18:37:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 Yes of course, we're in total agreement on that - the auto-tuned, manufactured drivel called 'music' today is merely the soundtrack to the consumerist-materialist end of days taking place right now.  All of Wagner's material is worth listening to but that is the greatest IMO.
1321037465340227584 2020-10-27 18:34:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 I don't think all modern music is bad (I'm not talking pop trash, rather genuine, original rock music between 1950 - 2000); one can appreciate it and classical music also.  I recommend the Tannhäuser Overture by Wagner - "euphoric" is really the only way to describe it.

Total tax resistance is a fundamental part of the campaign of total civil disobedience that is required now - voting won't fix this, action will.  #nationalism #scamdemic
1320844551494508544 2020-10-27 05:47:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnLalor18 That's it.  Many have realised it already but many still haven't - tax resistance is the greatest potential weapon we have. Their system would collapse immediately if everyone stopped paying.  Also on an ethical level, taxation is theft - money you've worked for is yours alone.
1320844054125551617 2020-10-27 05:45:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski That's true.  Personally I could survive perfectly well, just like you, with books, music and nature.  The reason I'm fighting it is because of the principle - these scum believing they can control others' lives with no resistance.  As long as we all stay united we can win.
1320836337474379777 2020-10-27 05:14:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly right.  But never forget who the 1% are.  We may not be able to say it here, but we all know their identities.  The question is, who is going to do something about it?
1320835857180463104 2020-10-27 05:13:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnLalor18 @MaryLouMcDonald Stop 'voting'.  Stop expecting someone else to solve all our problems. The last people on earth who will solve them are 'politicians'.  We need to take responsibility for our own lives, that's what we do.  No more tax, no more compliance.  #nationalism
1320835074611437571 2020-10-27 05:09:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly. And that is why the police are as much the enemy as any invader.
1320834257019981828 2020-10-27 05:06:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Good man, that's exactly the spirit we need.  The problem is, many of us can handle it - but the effect it's having on some families and loved ones is what makes it difficult.  I've regarded govt./police as the enemy for years, no change for me, but now they're dividing families.
1320772295443570690 2020-10-27 01:00:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> The mask slipped, if you'll pardon the pun, from the so-called Irish 'government' a long time ago.  They are not even pretending to have any legitimacy anymore, but are relying on their 'free state' footsoldiers the 'Gardaí' to keep them in power.  Resist! Action, not words!

Most are, yes - but some of us realised when we were still children than we were being lied to and have never read newspapers nor watched TV as adults.  No nationalist can call him- or her- self this without rejecting establishment media completely.
1320467870334308356 2020-10-26 04:50:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire Nothing should be imposed, full stop.  But as you can imagine, I do feel the need to defend my position when it seems like it's open season on vegans all the time from many on 'the right'.

You're 100% right about opposing the system now oppressing us under the pretext of 'coronavirus.'

The word 'Nazi' doesn't mean anything, then or now, it's a slur invented by the enemies of national socialism.  The totalitarian behaviour you rightly oppose is being perpetrated by those who proclaim the 'Nazis' to be the enemy.

Many people don't want to face up to the truth, but this has been simmering for a long time and now all those who oppose the #globalist #NWO's plans are being hammered into line.

Many simply label the group in question 'evil', and tbh I do not condemn such people, I see that as better than those who defend them; however for me it isn't a matter of good and evil, but of justice and injustice.

This is not a medical issue.  Anyone who goes to get tested deserves to have their status as a gullible #globalist #NWO slave known.
1320033832528154626 2020-10-25 00:06:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Rolloson14 @NationalPartyIE You cannot praise them when their actions suit you, and turn a blind eye when they don't.  I have yet to hear them condemn the Gardaí for anything.  Mr Barrett seems to think he can turn the #globalist #NWO police into his private army if he keeps them onside.
1320033135749378054 2020-10-25 00:03:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE I respectfully disagree though I see your point.  I feel we have just as much right, anon. is a tactical decision and a sensible one.  It's not a demand, you and I can discuss this reasonably and politely but so far no other NP reps. have done so, they simply insult and block.
1320032207101100032 2020-10-24 23:59:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE So are you!  So you understand why some of us have the sense not to reveal our true identities here.  Mr Barrett has time and again defended 'the ordinary Garda', but these people choose to join and to carry out their 'orders', they are not conscripts.  Likewise - best of luck.
1320031343884066816 2020-10-24 23:56:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE Also, I'm afraid I don't do 'chilled' re. certain subjects, police oppression under the guise of 'democracy', and the J** issue being two of them.  We're on the same side ultimately, I just don't understand NP's stance and especially their reluctance to discuss alt. viewpoints.
1320030794048524288 2020-10-24 23:54:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE Well those are two different subjects - one definitely cannot be discussed openly here without being banned.  I don't agree there are nuances re. the 'Gardaí', esp. since Drew Harris and the latest events.  JB himself is the Gardaí's greatest cheerleader, that's the problem...
1320027914600128512 2020-10-24 23:42:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine @NationalPartyIE Directed at me?  Where in the message you're replying to did I say anything about not talking about something?  And where is the "aggression"?  NP supports the 'Gardaí'. I'm waiting for them to justify this when the police beat innocent Irish people. Problem?
1320025856115441665 2020-10-24 23:34:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> Any representatives of @NationalPartyIE care to explain their support for the Irish police, in the wake of the recent marches in Dublin by Nigerians (who were allowed to proceed unhindered) and native Irish (beaten and arrested)?  NP supports police brutality. Prove me wrong.
1320025251087060992 2020-10-24 23:31:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pad_Ban We cannot talk openly about it, not here at any rate.  If you want to know who controls you, simply ask "Who may I not criticise?"  But away from social media, we must all, ceaselessly, continue opening people's eyes to this, and unite against this most serious threat.
1319974936409182208 2020-10-24 20:12:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @TuscanyPleinAir @ColmanOfGuaire @liamlovell4 I think it's naive to dismiss them as being 'a group like any other' - it's pretty clear that it isn't like any other, that's a fact it repeatedly states itself and the rest of the world falls into line behind that claim.  A free society cannot exist under their influence.
1319770254558568448 2020-10-24 06:38:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @liamlovell4 Perhaps. What it comes down to is one's attitude to the J question as a whole; of course as with anything, generalisations ordinarily are problematic.  But with this issue, I think it is safe to say that societies are healthier when that influence is totally removed.
1319766264269635584 2020-10-24 06:22:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @liamlovell4 Very true, and no Freemason will get very far if he does not ultimately serve the J word - which every establishment in the 'West' serves, in one way or another.
1319758811515752453 2020-10-24 05:53:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrelandReawakes @shihtzu44 It's not at all shocking.

Everything they do is aimed at destroying white nations.  Don't use Google.  #nationalism

The former to remove parasitic materialism and restore national traditions; the latter because a government should have no function other than protecting its citizens.
1319624852127580163 2020-10-23 21:00:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Danny64986055 @ColmanOfGuaire Literally any system is preferable.  Even under a feudal monarchy, those with open eyes had nothing to lose and could live as outlaws - a year of freedom like that is worth more than a lifetime under the distractions and mind-numbing comforts of capitalist 'democracy'.
1319624070779068416 2020-10-23 20:57:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SpookyGh0st32 True re. Communism - but 'US'-style unrestrained capitalism is also a j€wish creation, and it is that which entraps those in the West.  At least in NK and elsewhere there is no 'LGBT'/open borders insanity and degeneracy as in the West.  Bottom line is, N.S. is the third way.
1319446792627507200 2020-10-23 09:13:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SpookyGh0st32 Citizens of North Korea are one million times more free than citizens of Ireland - at least there there is no pretence of liberty.  In the West people are told they are free, but are under the total control of the j** - N. Koreans are at least under the total control of a Korean.

But as long as people wake up now to what the so-called 'Gardaí' and the so-called Irish 'government' really are, we should deal with one problem at a time.  Once people realise they're being lied to now, they may realise other lies too.

Yes, that's true.  Go on, say now how great the 'Gardaí' are, beating white Irish people and allowing Nigerians to break the 'rules'. If @NationalPartyIE doesn't condemn this, it's a new low.

Respect!

And your respect for the 'free state' #globalist #NWO 'law' reveals you as the plant - you're some nationalist: "can't do that, it's illegal"!  Fascinating how you're so obsessed with me though.
1319314205707849734 2020-10-23 00:26:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO Because some of us have more productive things to do for the cause than pursue doomed, pointless tactics.

1319271134592815106 2020-10-22 21:35:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly right.  #NWO is now rubbing people's faces in its lies- the statue of Orwell extolling 'free speech' at BBC HQ a case in point.  Smartphone addiction was the last rung on the ladder to total control.  I don't own or use one.
1319270246893506560 2020-10-22 21:31:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> That is exactly it.  Ireland is among a number of test labs designed to evaluate exactly how far the #globalist #NWO can push people. Seemingly the answer, so far, is 'as far as they like'.  Only when people are prepared to go to prison for this can change happen.
1319264463527301122 2020-10-22 21:08:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Turloughmighty There are so many who should be avenged.  No-one is perfect, but any who opposed the #globalist #NWO in any way had more heroism in his or her little finger than all of the 'heroes' the #MSM extols on behalf of its masters (whose identities we all know).
1319262432062328833 2020-10-22 21:00:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FamilyJohanna @rte @TonightVMTV Exactly. How anyone can continue to believe that the so-called 'government' has their interests at heart is beyond comprehension - everyone has now been affected by this in some way, and still so many comply.
1319253032182468609 2020-10-22 20:23:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FamilyJohanna @rte @TonightVMTV I doubt we will. My own grandmother has been given weeks to live for this very reason.  We can't ever forgive those who are responsible for this.
1319252491255644160 2020-10-22 20:21:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrelandsPeace @Pontifex @CatholicArena @LSNCatholic These are all valid points, but I'm sure you will agree that the situation is worsening every day - soon it will become impossible to continue to function within 'society' for those who are awake.  When the masses cannot be reached, we must keep the faith any way we can.
1319247402218434560 2020-10-22 20:01:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AMusueni @Scifo76943185 Says the person clearly using a fake profile picture of herself.  Nothing you say has any legitimacy, because you are a parasite living off the hard work of native people.
1319246873715236865 2020-10-22 19:58:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @NationalPartyIE @nationalpartyIE: is @BreaslainO the sort of person you want representing your organisation?  Asked repeatedly to outline your solution and ignores the question each time.  It's a simple request, but apparently too complicated for him.
1319246301519876098 2020-10-22 19:56:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AMusueni No, I'm proud of being white.  If you were proud of being black you would go and fight the alleged 'genocide' rather than hiding in Europe and insulting the nation that takes you in.  Maybe you should love your country rather than yourself.
1319243957663137796 2020-10-22 19:47:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Scifo76943185 @AMusueni Even if 'white privilege' was a real thing, what would be wrong with it?  Pride in one's race is a natural human emotion. Self-haters like her are the aberrations and monstrosities.
1319243345579986945 2020-10-22 19:44:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @NationalPartyIE Ah you've finally woken up, great.  Such a thing takes time and planning.  Explaining your 'political solution' to me could be done in minutes if you were capable of it. I'm waiting...
1319243008194318337 2020-10-22 19:43:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrelandsPeace @Pontifex @CatholicArena @LSNCatholic Nobody said anything about 'little', 'Amish', 'cult' or 'commune', but separation from #globalist #NWO establishment society is essential.  If you oppose virtually everything that society stands for, you are already separated from it, but continuing to live amid your enemies.
1319233259063095297 2020-10-22 19:04:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrelandsPeace @Pontifex @CatholicArena @LSNCatholic ... and ways to move around by collaborating with like-minded dissidents.  I'm not claiming to have all the answers but one thing I do know is that continuing to submit is no longer an option, not if you value liberty at all.
1319232748809236480 2020-10-22 19:02:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrelandsPeace @Pontifex @CatholicArena @LSNCatholic Yes, that is precisely the issue.  No-one is saying it will not require sacrifice.  But the time has come to make a decision - to remain 'ruled by the state', and therefore abide by its rules, or to operate outside it.  In the long term, we must develop our own services...
1319225805566844928 2020-10-22 18:35:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @johnaita00 Good for you. So do I - it's the only way to survive. They are lying to people about everything - lies and subterfuge are the obvious way to fight back.  Let's just say anyone trying to trace my movements after I arrived back in Ireland would have found it 'difficult' to do so.
1319222657083232260 2020-10-22 18:22:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @johnaita00 Thanks a lot.  By the way I was visiting family last week and was stopped twice in Meath by cops even though they didn't know whether I'd crossed county lines (gave them false info of course).  Huge respect to all of you fighting this tyranny day after day. Keep it up.
1319222067280154624 2020-10-22 18:20:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrelandsPeace @Pontifex @CatholicArena @LSNCatholic All we can do is form our own systems outside the establishment. Neither government nor the official church is on our side now.  But it will be easy to create alternatives, if we work together and reject the establishment completely.
1319220757986148352 2020-10-22 18:15:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @johnaita00 Forcibly, I mean - she wants to, but is being kept in isolation because of 'Covid' even though she might have only weeks left.  Your offer of help though is exactly the kind of community spirit we need, outside the establishment system.
1319220438472470528 2020-10-22 18:13:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @johnaita00 Where possible, I think we need to consider taking our loved ones home - this is an apocalyptic scenario, it would be better for them to die surrounded by loved ones than left to rot alone.  My own grandmother has stage 4 cancer and we're planning to take her home.
1319214550491815938 2020-10-22 17:50:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Motherhub56 @gerrywebster Start getting your essentials delivered, and only use petrol stations for fuel - they won't refuse your money after you've already filled up.  Forget about inessential purchases for now.  That's the only way to continue without a mask for the present.  #hoaxvirus #plandemichoax
1319037359879487494 2020-10-22 06:06:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Acedset Looks like a caricature of those hideous creatures.  Evil outside as well as inside.
1319023748163510273 2020-10-22 05:12:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE Well it's encouraging that you're open to learning how to speak English, if not to explaining the political positions you claim to hold.  I don't have time to teach you more words unfortunately, but if you want to know more about alternatives to 'democracy', ask me off Twitter.
1318979762157723651 2020-10-22 02:17:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE The expression is 'bated breath', not 'baited'.  Are you going to explain your 'political solution' to me while you're waiting?  Genuinely curious. Or does only Justin Barrett have the answers and you just vote for him, with no ideas of your own, is that how it works?
1318979241443196933 2020-10-22 02:15:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NEETLeoDiCaprio @Eoinseach @BreaslainO @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE You can't read?  This is becoming a theme with NP supporters sadly.
1318976488306343936 2020-10-22 02:04:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE The one-trick pony's run out of steam at last has it?  Here's a suggestion for you since you don't have any independent thought:  why not tell me your 'political solution'? I'm willing to learn from your no doubt eloquent and persuasive arguments.
1318967928285548546 2020-10-22 01:30:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE I have actually, but as pointed out many times, you are not interested in hearing anything other than 'Vote NP - let someone else take control of your destiny'.  It is impossible for you to 'win' this argument but I guess you've got nothing else to do until the next 'election'.
1318963779342925825 2020-10-22 01:14:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE That's what you're sticking with is it?  Repeating the same line ad nauseam?  Fair enough, I wouldn't necessarily expect you to be able to form more than a single thought in any given day but thought I'd give you the chance.  FYI there is no political solution, as you will find.
1318957760852217856 2020-10-22 00:50:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE If all other options were exhausted, perhaps I would.  But it's not just one man, and what we're doing - which you resolutely refuse to enquire about - is far more productive than 'voting'.  Your tone suggests you don't think the state is corrupt; but then maybe you don't think.
1318956687391399939 2020-10-22 00:45:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE Now rather than respond, you click 'like' on messages from someone 'standing for election' who's going to fix all your problems for you right?  Makes sense, it's what a child would do, refuse to take responsibility for his own life.
1318954128316432386 2020-10-22 00:35:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE I'm starting to think I'm talking to a child:  "I just don't understand what you haven't already been shot dead"... that doesn't actually make sense.  And now you're mocking Pearse's own martyrdom? You're really doing a great job of burnishing your nationalist credentials.
1318948479142690816 2020-10-22 00:13:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> That's right.  It's useful to look at the surnames and backgrounds of such families; what they have in common will surprise no-one.  Solutions will not be found in controlled 'democratic' parties, that is true. They can be found, but only outside the system.
1318943874740531201 2020-10-21 23:54:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE and by the way, we will see in a few years how your electoral 'strategy' is working out.  It increasingly seems like what the @NationalPartyIE is interested in is power, rather than justice.  Justice we can achieve, at a local level; but the NP will never have power. Facts.
1318942671227015170 2020-10-21 23:50:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> Everyone in the top three pictures is j€wish.  Coincidence?
1318942394725945346 2020-10-21 23:49:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE You're trying to mock me, rather than engaging in constructive collaborative work to address real issues right now.  You know how to contact me if you're interested in learning more.  If all you want to do is insult fellow patriots, then carry on if it makes you feel better.
1318937279226925056 2020-10-21 23:28:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE A) there is a time for everything  B) no that's not true, and I'm happy to explain all the productive actions being taken by myself and others to any who are willing to listen.  I am not going to do so on Twitter for obvious reasons.  Most on here insult and block. I don't.
1318933537337315328 2020-10-21 23:13:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SaoMc2 The #globalist #NWO mobilised the entire world against Germany, which had successfully freed itself from materialism and international finance parasitism, eliminating unemployment and transforming the country into the most successful nation on earth.  It was working just fine.
1318930922083897345 2020-10-21 23:03:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE @IrishTimes This is happening under capitalism, not socialism;  not under Maduro nor Castro nor Lukashenko, but under Varadkar, Martin, Johnson et al.  You call argument 'trolling'? Are you really cut out for politics in that case? I've been unfailingly polite in my questions.
1318929756662992898 2020-10-21 22:58:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SaoMc2 Not national socialism.
1318925650758111234 2020-10-21 22:42:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE @IrishTimes But someone in your position cannot simply quote the Irish Times without a disclaimer. Things have moved on too much for that. You will appear to support it, otherwise.  And to repeat - not socialism, but the capitalist 'USA''s sanctions, are the cause of Venezuela's problems.
1318925117452439553 2020-10-21 22:40:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @NationalPartyIE @IrishTimes Simply replying to a question doesn't take long.  If you represent an organisation, you must be prepared to defend its stances, otherwise you will appear not to care about potential supporters' views.  And "the likes of me?" Why the hostility?
1318924523316588545 2020-10-21 22:38:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @Eoinseach @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions @NationalPartyIE He also took up arms against the British even though he knew he could not defeat them.  NP supporters today mock people like Pearse.  Too many today are terrified at the prospect of giving up Netflix and pornography, never mind actually dying for  their freedom.
1318915056130805761 2020-10-21 22:00:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Eoinseach @BreaslainO @Teknogrot @lugh____ @IzzyKamikaze @lisaquestions The @NationalPartyIE has lost its claim to uphold Pearse's legacy though.  Pearse would have educated his teenage supporters to represent their nation without resorting to insults and slurs, and he certainly would not have been seeking election nor supporting the 'Gardaí'.
1318914419850694656 2020-10-21 21:57:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @IrishTimes @NationalPartyIE It would be hilarious if it were not so pathetic - the number of NP supporters 'liking' this reply.  You are all aware that all it does is admit that the @NationalPartyIE is incapable of defending its positions and choices, right?  I'm willing to be proved wrong - but you can't.
1318900859556843522 2020-10-21 21:04:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 I have always had suspicions; while he was right about what the problems are, his refusal to say who is responsible (their true identities are far more hideous and concerning than any fantasy 'lizard people') is a serious problem.  Like opposing #islam but supporting '#Israel'.
1318898101537603584 2020-10-21 20:53:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard True words.  But a polarised world is exactly what the #globalist #NWO is creating, deliberately - 'divided we fall'.
1318896574349627394 2020-10-21 20:47:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @oisinpm @PQuinlanNP @NationalPartyIE Yes it is.  But that's not what Justin Barrett was saying in videos in April this year. He said that while restrictions were excessive, the virus was real. Gemma O'Doherty said it was a scam from the start.  Also, Mr Barrett wants to enter the Dáil. Democracy is not the solution.
1318883297385156608 2020-10-21 19:54:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Yes, saw plenty of them too. And actual joggers, alone out in the open!  And the sorry sight of a cop without a mask, stopping a driver who was wearing one, to demand to know where he was going!  I think the lack of an independent thought process is really the problem.
1318879238615949312 2020-10-21 19:38:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 That's literally what she said.  Wearing it "sometimes" will save everyone from the 'virus'?  It doesn't get you while you're eating?  And, the nearest passenger was 10 rows away!  They're just bitter because they have to wear it all day at work I suppose, but that's no excuse.
1318877071620345856 2020-10-21 19:29:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> Irish patriots take note:  @PaulMcWeeneyNP, representative of @NationalPartyIE, has refused three times to explain to me why he was quoting the #globalist #NWO @IrishTimes in a propaganda piece against Venezuela.  Why is the NP so reluctant to explain itself? Because it cannot..?
1318872653139218432 2020-10-21 19:11:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Thanks.  One's conviction is tested to the limit - a hostess berated me, shouting "you have to wear it at least sometimes", when I said I can't eat through a mask.  But in shops, only once did security say something - a black man telling a white man in Europe to wear a mask!
1318871546040143878 2020-10-21 19:07:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 For the flight yes - the airline staff told me as I boarded that if I refused I could not fly. But I took it off and pretended I was eating and drinking for the whole flight.  Otherwise, I did not wear it even once. Take-off and landing were the only times I've ever worn one.
1318862718712094721 2020-10-21 18:32:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @gerrywebster The 'Gardaí' are the enemy of the Irish people.  They have their origin in the RIC occupying 'police' force.  They are not conscripts, so any who join are choosing to defend tyranny by arresting those who do not wear masks or who travel around their own country.  Do not consent.
1318861658505306113 2020-10-21 18:28:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @IrishTimes @NationalPartyIE You also criticised Niall McConnell's confronting that traitor priest who allowed Muslims to speak at mass.  You said it was the wrong approach.  But what did the @NationalPartyIE do about it?  Precisely nothing as far as I can see - or am I wrong? Show me proof of what it did.
1318861204694159360 2020-10-21 18:26:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @IrishTimes @NationalPartyIE You've still got the opportunity to respond to all of the points I raised.  It's a tendency I've observed with some NP spokespeople; aren't you going to even react to the charge that an Irish nationalist shouldn't be quoting the @irishtimes?
1318857200480210946 2020-10-21 18:10:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @IrishTimes @NationalPartyIE Already involved.  Sad to say that though she's not perfect, Gemma has more patriotism in her little finger than a group that quotes Irish Times propaganda and won't even take the time to justify it.  It's you who'll need the luck.
1318855528202833920 2020-10-21 18:03:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @IrishTimes @NationalPartyIE I was an early member of the party.  It seemed at one point that maybe it was.  But now you cannot even respond to any of the points raised?  Most of NP's principles are sound, but the relentless USA-worship is alienating much potential support.
1318854991160004608 2020-10-21 18:01:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> Travelled by air for the first time in 8 months last week.  Deliberately did not use hand sanitiser at all, nor take any measures other than what I would normally do, and of course gave a fake 'quarantine' address and did not self-isolate.  Guess what? No 'corona'.  #hoaxvirus
1318853232572178435 2020-10-21 17:54:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP Also:  you're quoting the @IrishTimes as your source?  I say again, how then is the @NationalPartyIE any different from the establishment parties?  Think about it.
1318852808678977538 2020-10-21 17:53:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP Wrong.  The effects of a protracted campaign of economic sanctions and propaganda from the capitalist 'USA' against an independent sovereign nation, in practice.  @NationalPartyIE wants to emulate the rigged Deep State/controlled opposition system of the US? Like FF/FG/SF?
1318851110426316801 2020-10-21 17:46:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @jennyma89557070 @ColmanOfGuaire How anyone can believe this creature has their best interests at heart is beyond me.  I have rarely seen less sincere, more obviously-under-the-control-of-the-#globalist-#NWO servants of evil as Ireland's two so-called 'leaders'.  People must resist before it is too late.
1318678968363601925 2020-10-21 06:22:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'Heaven help us if we were to spend our time on protests instead of preparing for the struggle'  - A. H., the Forbidden Philosopher.
1318658146152419341 2020-10-21 04:59:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> It was always thus.  That is show business in a nutshell - who you know, and how far you're prepared to go in perpetuating the lies that make up 'history' on behalf of, as you succinctly describe it, the Cabal.  The 1%, the 'chosen'... we all know who ultimately benefits.
1318655371251253254 2020-10-21 04:48:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @OutOfShadow_s @SAT_SLDR There is much potential bubbling under the surface, but we can't underestimate the power of these people's cowardice - to us it seems obvious not to wear masks, but many others will do so until the majority do not.  There is hope, but it's hard work to make something out of it.
1318654608030519296 2020-10-21 04:45:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @johnaita00 That's their version of 'free speech' - free until you start telling the truth.  However I would dispute your description of them - they are #globalist #NWO #zionists, and had national socialism been victorious in 1945 it is fair to say this issue would not exist.
1318635801673125891 2020-10-21 03:30:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PMacoute @SAT_SLDR Interesting point.  I agree however, nowhere is perfect, at least no 'state' currently existing.  As said, I believe taxation is incompatible with freedom; paying subsidies should be a choice, and those who choose not to should be exempt from the benefits allegedly provided.
1318628511419191302 2020-10-21 03:01:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PMacoute @SAT_SLDR It's an admirable sentiment, but US citizens are obliged to submit tax returns to the government annually under threat of imprisonment, regardless of where in the world they live and work.  Taxation is theft, and incompatible with liberty!
1318626196410818563 2020-10-21 02:52:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> @TimHanan @BuzzGillard @john_mcguirk What's happening in Australia will happen in Ireland.  People in Ireland have been arrested for not wearing masks; you're challenging me on this issue the day before your next 6 weeks of 'lockdown' under an unelected government.  Keep telling yourself they're looking out for you.
1318625631261917187 2020-10-21 02:50:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard @john_mcguirk Totally agree with you. She does frequently alienate people.  But there is a witch-hunt against her because the so-called Irish 'government' and media wants to see her gone, and for that reason alone I support her 99% of the time.
1318623747713228806 2020-10-21 02:42:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BuzzGillard @john_mcguirk G O'D is abrasive and divisive, no arguments there.  But regardless of method, fighting the tyranny of being forced to wear a muzzle, against our will under threat of prison, is a noble act.  Opposing the corrupt Irish 'state' takes priority over one gullible man's feelings.
1318621449284931585 2020-10-21 02:33:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> Regardless of the point being made - Sam Harris is a j€w.  End of moral analysis.
1318621072808382465 2020-10-21 02:32:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @john_mcguirk @BuzzGillard 'Protect himself by following the advice issued by his own Government'?  These people are not the government of the Irish people, and anyone who believes they are trying to protect, rather than destroy, Ireland is an idiot.  #plandemichoax #COVID19 #hoaxvirus
1318620245536497666 2020-10-21 02:28:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> No government, anywhere, ever, has the right to confine people and tell them where they can and cannot go. That is tyranny, plain and simple.  Even if a virus actually existed, the government still would not have that right.  Resist this with every breath - live free or die!
1318620106470154242 2020-10-21 02:28:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> This virtue-signalling scum does not even understand how the term 'snowflakes' is used...  he calls those who do NOT wear masks, 'snowflakes'... rather than the cowards, scared of their own shadows, who think a made-up 'virus' is going to get them and do as the 'government' says!
1318607160645980164 2020-10-21 01:37:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> This is exactly the problem.  People seem incapable of taking a step back and objectively appraising the world they've bought into.  Any one of the practices engaged in by 'society' today could be seen as literally insane; taken all together they represent mass psychosis.
1318320400653312001 2020-10-20 06:37:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire Doubtful - reminds me of a certain 'Irishman' (Geldof) who exhorted others to do just that, then 12 months later confirmed in an interview that there were precisely zero 'refugees' living in his gigantic home (in England of course).  Bragg and 'Bojo' - two sides of same coin.
1318246400480677892 2020-10-20 01:43:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire That's true.  The more I hear about him the more my contempt for him increases.  I always thought he was absurdly overrated, but now there's an added dimension to my loathing for him.
1318245963933323269 2020-10-20 01:41:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 It's a million times worse when they do it than when security guards do. At least the latter are being ordered to do so.   Other customers doing so are scum - as if they have any authority over you or any of us.  I find simply ignoring such people works, plus it annoys them more.
1318118870473990144 2020-10-19 17:16:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> The 'police' are as much the enemy as any invader or media manipulator or 'politician'.  Perhaps more so, since it is they who enforce crimes against their own countrymen.  Refuse to recognise their authority - if everyone does this, they have no power.  #deepstate #PlandemicHoax
1318118194599645184 2020-10-19 17:14:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire I wasn't aware of that, but it makes perfect sense.  Hardly surprising then, his views; though completely out of step when many at the time and since were supportive of Ireland's fight for freedom.  Remarkable how a few platitudes about 'socialism' can obscure his background.
1318117647129677824 2020-10-19 17:11:51 +0800 <JenDesNor> It has always been thus.  "All politics grows from the barrel of a gun" - no matter how they dress it up, force is the deciding factor in all human affairs, and the state has more of it than any other entity.  We must focus on productive actions until in a position to fight it.
1317879574840152065 2020-10-19 01:25:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JamesReynoldsNP @FiordLethal Pathetic 'free state' lies here from the @NationalPartyIE.  Collins was a traitor who used English guns against those who were fighting to bring about Pearse's vision.  Pearse would never have signed the treaty.  Collins deserved everything he got.  #nationalism
1317878783970521088 2020-10-19 01:22:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire Well it's no surprise that Paul Murphy is a self-hating traitor - but it's useful to remind people of the kind of person Billy Bragg is.  For all his trendy, 'right-on' posturing, an Englishman appearing in Dublin to criticise freedom fighters (at the  time). Says it all.
1317757745773371393 2020-10-18 17:21:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski @suzy661 @Angemitch78 This is a great idea.  I would respectfully suggest however that WhatsApp is not the forum for this - we cannot position ourselves as anti-establishment and then use Facebook-owned tech, no matter how convenient.  We do need to organise.
1317757052178124802 2020-10-18 17:18:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ni_ceitinn @karlwizowski @DeeCarra In my opinion, the future of our children can be saved - but only outside the system.  I know not everyone is in a position to home-school - but if children are kept away from smartphones, the internet, TV, MSM and government indoctrination, then they have a fighting chance.
1317756273820127232 2020-10-18 17:15:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> Great.  But she should not be promoting the mask lie.  #PlandemicHoax #COVID19 #hoaxvirus
1317620953766035456 2020-10-18 08:18:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Ray60749982 @leannemac4 Thanks a lot, but I didn't let them spoil it.  It was heartening to see that, though we were few, I was not the only one un-muzzled.  Met up with a valued ally of mine from here; you should have seen people's faces when we shook hands!  Every such act is rebellion now.
1317552612141662208 2020-10-18 03:46:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @Ray60749982 Been abroad.  First time in Ireland in months this week; huge respect to those of you dealing with this on daily basis.  Security guard in one shop just kept repeating 'for your safety' even when I'd told him I am exempt.   Whole day in Dublin city centre, just one confrontation.
1317173167626932224 2020-10-17 02:38:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @leannemac4 @thejournal_ie It's all so obviously planned out you can see their next move weeks in advance.  'Soften them up with level 3, then hit them with level 5 when they're worn out and will comply with anything'.  Total resistance is now required, at every level.
1317172755083780099 2020-10-17 02:37:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Tax resistance is the answer.  Just like it takes incredible guts and resolve to stand up against the coronavirus lies, it takes strength to make a stand on tax - but we have to.  Paying tax is literally funding our own destruction.  I do not.
1317169945155936256 2020-10-17 02:26:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @skorpionmouse Even if I didn't already love the music of Wagner I would listen to him for the very reason others do not.  As for Springsteen et al, agreed - impossible to enjoy the music without feeling it is now tainted.  #plandemic #NWO
1317016196038955009 2020-10-16 16:15:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> Look at this self-hating traitor, literally reading the script handed to her by her j€w masters.  Praising the 'country' that annihilated hundreds of thousands of her countrymen and women by raining bombs on innocent civilians.  You know, we know, all know it's a lie.
1316797495633158146 2020-10-16 01:46:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @johnaita00 @leannemac4 All these people saying 'the ordinary cops are all right': fools.  They are not conscripts; they choose to join an organisation that flies 'LGBT' flags on its vehicles and are happy to be led by an English colonist, who will very soon have them arresting you for 'hate speech'.
1316796137265917953 2020-10-16 01:40:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 That's exactly what they do. When they cannot defend their position, they dismiss the truth as 'nonsense'.  To be honest, I am no longer trying to save the masses from themselves; they are a lost cause. I simply want those of us who are awake, to be free to live as we choose.
1316713948473962496 2020-10-15 20:14:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Most people cannot comprehend it - or if they can, they bury themselves in the comforts and distractions provided by those few 'people', for exactly that purpose, so they don't have to face up to it.  It has always been thus. Only the truly strong have it in them to rebel.
1316471177947291648 2020-10-15 04:09:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @TooMuchJuiceX Exactly.  Change cannot happen 'democratically'.  Those behind every revolution in history understood this.  #deepstate #controlledopposition #nationalism
1316464582223892482 2020-10-15 03:43:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @johnaita00 @immdaly @Twitter Expressing an opinion that challenges the #globalist #NWO propaganda narrative, is how I would put it, speaking as a fellow previously-banned member.  Yes it's as bad as FB - 'social media', like all media, exists only to brainwash people into supporting the j*wish worldview.
1316300507133214721 2020-10-14 16:51:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> It doesn't matter what you voted for.  The result is pre-determined. That's the Deep State/controlled opposition system in action.  The Conservatives are the same as Labour - there are boatloads of 'migrants' arriving every day in Kent and the British 'government' allows it.
1316298738432966662 2020-10-14 16:44:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @paddylepage In theory, the PRC was a genuine alternative to Western decadence originally - however its leaders realised the power of soul-destroying Western 'social media' in the self-oppression of populations, and now encourage all the most damaging traits of capitalism.
1316296772663246848 2020-10-14 16:36:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 You’ll have to carry me out on a slab before I compromise my defense of the white people, their greatness, their history, their safety, and their native lands.
1315672096073289728 2020-10-12 23:14:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SaoMc2 @Thomaskiely16 They most definitely will.  All I can say is, you have the sympathy of all your fellow independent thinkers - I work remotely but if I didn't I'd be in exactly the same situation as you.  Try to get an exemption and just remember you're not alone, even when it feels like it.
1315639131830181888 2020-10-12 21:03:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> Can't argue with any of this, except:  don't have a smartphone, never mind sleep near one.  You are literally carrying out the #globalist #NWO's surveillance for it by carrying such a device in your pocket.  Free yourself.
1315638690178359296 2020-10-12 21:01:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @BuzzGillard No. You can't.  And @NationalPartyIE won't ever be in a position to do so, because the Deep State/controlled opposition system of sham 'democracy' is off-limits to genuine nationalists.  So if you want to save your children from #globalist #NWO brainwashing, home-school them.
1315630355785936896 2020-10-12 20:28:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> Of more interest are the countless NP accounts that insult and/or block nationalists who display independent thought rather than mindlessly following the party line.  You're alienating whole swathes of potential support with this approach. 'Democracy' is a lie, as you will find.
1315629388105474048 2020-10-12 20:24:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @RWingAtheist @NationalPartyIE ... a case in point.  Instead of responding to any challenge to its groupthink, NP members block and/or insult those who display any critical thinking.  It is alienating whole swathes of potential supporters.  It's becoming more and more obvious that only teenagers support NP.
1313950690688077825 2020-10-08 05:13:51 +0800 <JenDesNor> Those who still peddle the lie that 'democracy' can save us, and those who believe them, read this:   https://t.co/7vM1lImLOY  This is what happens when nationalists get too popular - the #NWO imprisons and outlaws them.  Stop fighting to be part of the system.  #nationalism
1313899374452375560 2020-10-08 01:49:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> Those who still peddle the lie that 'democracy' can save us, and those who believe them, read this:   https://t.co/dM0wzNVIvx  This is what happens when nationalists get too popular - they imprison and outlaw you.  Stop fighting to be part of the system.  #NWO #nationalism
1313876530167152641 2020-10-08 00:19:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> No-one is interested in your thoughts on Ireland.  "Irish beef is beautiful"? Says the man whose 'culture' requires that animals have their throats slit while fully conscious because "A**** said so".  Primitive scum.  #nationalism #animalwelfare
1313835840917975040 2020-10-07 21:37:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> They will not make a widespread 'comeback' just because we want them to.  The #globalist #NWO has to be defeated for that to happen.  Everything is connected. 'Modernism' did not happen by chance.  #nationalism
1313826273236602881 2020-10-07 20:59:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly right.  Which is another way of saying: 'democracy is rigged'.  It is impossible for a revolutionary nationalist party to come to power 'legally'. Harsh but true. People must stop wasting their time, energy and resources on electioneering.  #nationalism
1313818810214948864 2020-10-07 20:29:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @vickyintheuk Right.  Rgardless of which 'royal family', it is a testament to human stupidity that the concept survives in 2020.  Families became 'royal' because they had the strongest armies; 'governments' stay in power because the police and army protect them.  They use force to oppress.
1313816739965284352 2020-10-07 20:21:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @vickyintheuk Well said.  Even before the so-called 'virus', it is particularly sickening when so-called Irish people speak of these people as 'the queen', 'the duchess' etc. - the only difference is power.  That has always been the deciding factor - whoever has the physical force, wins.
1313788068554510336 2020-10-07 18:27:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> And the best way to be at all-out war with them is not to be drunk.  Hiding away from reality in your home is exactly where they want you to be.  We need to stay alert, stay vigilant - not willingly submit.  #plandemichoax #globalism #NWO #covid19 #hoaxvirus
1313551082329645056 2020-10-07 02:45:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Scifo76943185 Yes you're right, I hope to be there.  There is too much division in the Irish nationalist scene however, I'm not sure how easy unity will be.  But you're 100% correct about all establishment parties and the Deep State system - they need to pay the price for their treachery.
1313547177654968321 2020-10-07 02:30:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Scifo76943185 ... now not sure if it will happen because of new 'restrictions'. If I can't, let's arrange a talk for next week - you're absolutely right about organisation.
1313546554398183424 2020-10-07 02:27:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Scifo76943185 We know that, but certain others, such as the person in that video, cling to the ridiculous notion that they can bring about change within the system.  I'm not sure about Saturday, I was meant to be coming to Ireland this week and hoped we could meet up but...
1313545736894713857 2020-10-07 02:24:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NickGriffinBU @ClauSchS @ETNostra Exactly right.  In fact that ought to be all there is to the struggle - the Deep State/controlled opposition system is a waste of resources and time.  What was possible in 1933 is not necessarily doable in 2020 - alternative strategies are needed.  #nationalism
1313544262001319936 2020-10-07 02:18:51 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SouthernWolf5 Anything is possible if the will is there.  Even if native whites were outnumbered 100 to 1, they could reverse the tide if they truly desired it.  #nationalism
1313528780909051910 2020-10-07 01:17:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> I would ordinarily urge unity among nationalists of all stripes, and respect @NationalPartyIE's work against 'abortion' etc..  But there can be no acceptance of EU dominance over sovereign countries' affairs.
1313484250604281856 2020-10-06 22:20:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire Right.  While it's debatable whether N.S. in Germany was equally devoted to both parts of its name, in principle the ultimate expression of nationalism was socialist.  Painful to hear so many otherwise awakened people (incl. NP and Go'D) decry the #globalist #NWO as 'socialist'.
1313466337629364225 2020-10-06 21:09:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> 100% agreed.  And you succinctly highlight the fact that so many less enlightened nationalists still cling to 'capitalism' as their salvation, when it is capitalism which has brought us to this situation.  For all its faults, North Korea has patriotism, and no 'LGBT' madness.
1313458443043430400 2020-10-06 20:37:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Turloughmighty Totally understand, merely pointing out to any other readers that he is not someone to be trusted.  Of course the story is more important than where it came from though.
1313439138692108288 2020-10-06 19:21:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> Yes, a hero.  But the account holder that originally posted this story goes out of his way to virtue-signal, shrieking: "I despise Nazis" on his profile but referring to Lindh as a "right-winger".  We can do without these cowards slandering the cause.  #nationalism
1313182547254403079 2020-10-06 02:21:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @BasedBitch2 @SansaarK @SpookyGh0st32 @ReiRiograndino True, but their fear, in my opinion, is not a reason to treat them kindly.  If we can see through it, no-one else has an excuse, and fear of confrontation is just plain cowardice.
1313182199882096640 2020-10-06 02:20:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @SpookyGh0st32 @SansaarK @BasedBitch2 @ReiRiograndino Well whatever happens, it won't be the same way, history doesn't work that way of course.  The world has changed so much from what it looked like in 1933; we need to take inspiration but work with what we've got, at the same time.
1313176818661367811 2020-10-06 01:58:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @SpookyGh0st32 @SansaarK @BasedBitch2 @ReiRiograndino Yes, but also times were different.  He lived in a time when it was still possible, just about, for a radical nationalist/anti-usury party to come to power 'democratically', while even the judge praised him at his 1923 trial.  Neither of these things can happen today.
1313170685003534337 2020-10-06 01:34:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> No.  It was probably Chinese.  That's right, the same evil China that flag-waving Yanks blame for all their problems.  It is #capitalism that results in 'diversity' and 'multiculturalism' terror, not #socialism - you won't find any moslems in North Korea.  #nationalism
1313167793571930112 2020-10-06 01:22:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @BasedBitch2 @SansaarK @SpookyGh0st32 @ReiRiograndino Likewise, regarding anyone who knows me and no we shouldn't be afraid, of course.  But if this 'pandemic' has proven anything (we already knew), it's that people are terrified of standing out; they don't have the courage to be called a 'racist' so they'll deny their own views.
1313161190537940994 2020-10-06 00:56:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @BasedBitch2 @SansaarK @SpookyGh0st32 @ReiRiograndino The problem is that everyone knows the truth, but people realise their lives will be much easier if they deny it.  Most people are awakened enough that if you ask 'who controls the world?' they think of that word without being prompted, but they will never fight back against it.
1313154807843127298 2020-10-06 00:31:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> Wrong.  Not 'Gdańsk'.  Danzig.
1313151429360734214 2020-10-06 00:17:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnLalor18 @LeoVaradkar @SimonHarrisTD It is not your 'government', and it does not 'govern' - it does what it is told to by the #globalist #NWO.  #nationalism
1313147921622237185 2020-10-06 00:03:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @McCabeJasper @Critiqued101 Thanks.  I am just saying it as I see it - there are many alleged 'nationalist' groups insisting on being treated like "any other political party" - but why would anyone honourable want that?  All parties in this 'democracy' are corrupt - alternative strategies are needed.
1313136188832743424 2020-10-05 23:17:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> #globalist #NWO media, pornography, materialism, 'social media' and smartphone addiction.  There's your answer.  Reject them all. Nations can still be saved through small-scale local #nationalist communities operating under the radar, away from the ((media)) glare.
1313130047025410049 2020-10-05 22:52:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> And all those who accepted a 'homosexual' foreigner as their 'leader' even though he never won an election are to blame.  What did they think was going to happen?  Addressing Varadkar as 'Taoiseach' was the final nail in Ireland's coffin.  #nationalism
1313124042837241856 2020-10-05 22:29:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @EndAidtolsrael @spark2ignit3 Well done.  Says it all succinctly and poetically.  #nationalism
1313123334167592963 2020-10-05 22:26:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Critiqued101 That's right.  The only thing I'd say is that Ireland has no democracy, full stop. The Deep State/controlled opposition system means that it is impossible for any genuinely revolutionary party to take power.  You're right, the vast majority won't be woken up on Saturday, sadly.
1313119683088916481 2020-10-05 22:11:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Critiqued101 You're right.  Protests have their uses, but to quote the forbidden philosopher:  "Heaven help us if we were to spend our time on protests instead of preparing for the struggle."  Salvation cannot come from 'democracy'. We should be seeking an alternative system.  #nationalism
1313118635913773057 2020-10-05 22:07:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> Edit: and opposition to '#Israel', I presume.
1313117926275325954 2020-10-05 22:04:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> Understand who controls the #globalist #NWO that runs Ireland's and other countries' schools, and you have the answer.  Incidentally, given your name and presumed background, opposition to so-called '#lgbtq' insanity is the only thing we have in common.  #nationalism
1313104233479237632 2020-10-05 21:10:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Chamaa Remember also that Germany in the 1930s enacted some of the world's first animal welfare and environmental protection laws.
1313104159105855488 2020-10-05 21:10:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Chamaa On the contrary, when every nation looks out for its own interests and protects its own environment and people, that equates to a global solution.  A #globalist #NWO over-riding national sovereignty will never succeed.
1313101430274879488 2020-10-05 20:59:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> Yes of course, you can't ever complain about the oppression you are suffering right now, without invoking the 'Nazi fascists' of 80 years ago.  Had those bogeymen you're so scared of won, the inhuman #globalist #NWO now unfolding would have been prevented.  #nationalism
1313097486911893504 2020-10-05 20:43:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> Ireland has demonstrated by its overwhelming complicity so far this year that it is already in such a state, as a result of #globalist #NWO media lies, 'US' entertainment and smartphone addiction.  The masses cannot be saved.  Salvation lies only outside so-called 'democracy'.
1313095906405867520 2020-10-05 20:37:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 All 100% correct except the 'respect' part.  There is a certain 'religion' which is not a religion but an extremist, child-abusing, animal-torturing dynasty.  When people understand that, as well as understanding why they should oppose '#Israel', then they are seeing clearly.
1313088877868052480 2020-10-05 20:09:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly. Posturing scum like him are merely part of the Deep State/controlled opposition system.  They exist solely to give the illusion of 'democratic choice', but ultimately will never oppose the system that props them up.  Salvation does not lie in 'democracy'.  #nationalism
1313076042563760130 2020-10-05 19:18:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Sadly, yes.  Anyone who is fully awake to what and who controls 'governments' and media worldwide is not surprised by anything.  I always knew the day would come when the pretence was abandoned and martial law would begin - and here it is.  #plandemichoax #COVID19 #hoaxvirus
1313075331968962560 2020-10-05 19:15:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> This means nothing without the banning of so-called 'kosher' meat as well.  J€ws and moslems have more in common than they would like to admit - and one of the things they share is their barbaric treatment of animals "because their 'god' told them to."  #AnimalWelfare
1312531170857422848 2020-10-04 07:13:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly right.  Deep state/controlled opposition.
1312150580500942848 2020-10-03 06:00:51 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 In the Nordic region, when TV shows pan out to audience shots, the sheep are all sitting there muzzled while the 'stars' on stage are free to go about their business as usual!  #plandemichoax #COVID19 #hoaxvirus
1311778327049441282 2020-10-02 05:21:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> @garrettmccaff @PaulMcWeeneyNP Thank you.  It does nothing to change my view however, which is that neither Trump nor Biden serves the interests of white people, but rather those of '#Israel'.  Also, billions of people are being distracteed by this sham contest, while the #globalist #NWO carries on as usual.
1311731563873349635 2020-10-02 02:15:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pad_Ban The fact is that this crisis cannot be solved by voting.  It's to your credit that you did something, but everyone must realise - the Deep State/controlled opposition system will never allow anything that threatens the #globalist #NWO to succeed.  Action, not words...
1311703925486125056 2020-10-02 00:26:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> This is exactly what is wrong with society.  You think this is entertaining?  These parasitical scum taking your 'taxes' and putting on a pantomime to distract you while the #globalist #NWO continues to destroy your country for '#Israel'?  Stop voting. Stop paying 'tax'. Wake up.
1311673680771121153 2020-10-01 22:25:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> Ireland is not dying. It is being murdered. And these people murdering it have names and addresses, as do the so-called 'Gardaí' protecting them.  The question is, what are real patriots going to do with that information?  #nationalism
1311660588255256578 2020-10-01 21:33:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> The police have never been on the side of nationalists...  they sign up to serve the #globalist #NWO, which means serving '#Israel'.  A 'police officer' is the opposite of a patriot.  They are the enemy.  #nationalism
1311660499038212096 2020-10-01 21:33:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Lalawor86273129 The police have never been on the side of nationalists...  they sign up to serve the #globalist #NWO, which means serving '#Israel'.  A 'police officer' is the opposite of a patriot.  They are the enemy.  #nationalism
1311650477688356865 2020-10-01 20:53:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> That's right.  But what it doesn't mention is who is behind it, as if these creatures could successfully have carried this out without assistance.  The #globalist #NWO is behind it - and we all know who that means.  So when rightly opposing m****** - never forget the other enemy.
1311636157361467392 2020-10-01 19:56:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> ... today, the so-called 'USA' is explicitly exempt from the 'authority' of the 'International Criminal Court', and in practice, so are the 'UK', 'Israel' and their allies.  'War crimes' are what 'Nazis' and other convenient scapegoats do, according to the #globalist #NWO.
1311608617548673029 2020-10-01 18:07:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @OutOfShadow_s Stay strong.  Many of us are in similar situations.  Totally understandable to be demoralised - but as you know, if that gets the better of you, they've won.  You're not on your own.  #plandemichoax #COVIDー19 #hoaxvirus
1311432140085776390 2020-10-01 06:26:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> Remember at all times, the Deep State will never allow a truly revolutionary national party to take power, even if one could somehow 'win' an election.  Therefore we cannot afford to waste time and resources on participating in sham 'democracy'.  The system must be replaced.
1311429556113473537 2020-10-01 06:15:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @SpookyGh0st32 @last_call12 Great. Talk soon.
1311427627308249090 2020-10-01 06:08:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @SpookyGh0st32 @last_call12 Yes, fully agree with both.  I too am in deadly earnest.  We cannot effectively discuss here though.  Can we agree to do so some other way when convenient for all?
1311427193042501632 2020-10-01 06:06:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @SpookyGh0st32 @last_call12 Ah I see.  Thanks for clarifying. To be honest it is a work in progress, when I have time I intend to refine it.  It's a very good point you make - I'd like to discuss some time properly if you're interested, I believe the approach we both favour is the same one.
1311426522931224579 2020-10-01 06:03:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mag_Aodhgain17 I don't need to convince anyone. Many of you seem to think that because I can speak German I can't also speak Irish and English.  I said nothing about yelling and shouting - and if you think the 'Gardaí' are your allies, you are sorely mistaken.
1311425189788495872 2020-10-01 05:58:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mag_Aodhgain17 But you're avoiding the main point - how do you know I am a foreigner?  I'm not berating anyone, I'm pointing out that merely chanting 'Ireland for the Irish', which we all know, and waiting every 4 years to put an 'x' on a piece of paper, is not a solid strategy.
1311424189325283336 2020-10-01 05:54:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @SpookyGh0st32 @last_call12 Sorry, who are you referring to?  Honesty is appreciated of course, but I'm not sure exactly who or what you mean.  Thanks.
1311423694435225603 2020-10-01 05:52:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mag_Aodhgain17 You brought it up first, which suggests that you do care.  Ireland is also Northern Europe.  How do you know I am not also an Irish nationalist?  It was you who started arguing - I'm willing to cooperate if we're on the same side, which it seems we are.
1311423196298653699 2020-10-01 05:50:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> As if the #plandemichoax wasn't horrendous enough, millions of innocent creatures will be killed to make a 'vaccine' that has no medical purpose.  Yet another reason to say 'no more'!  #COVID19 #fakevirus
1311422603937148928 2020-10-01 05:48:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @NationalPartyIE That's actually a good point.  As said, I wasn't defending them - I was pointing out that the @NationalPartyIE's policy of attempting to gain mass support will not translate into electoral success. Not defeatism, but fact.  Therefore nationalists need to be open to other options.
1311421986166509569 2020-10-01 05:45:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mag_Aodhgain17 You still haven't addressed the issue of your ignorance about where I am from and where I reside.  It isn't your fault that you don't know, but it is your fault that you make assumptions based on that fact.  And no, a 17-year-old cannot be trusted to maintain a consistent view.
1311421398053801985 2020-10-01 05:43:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IrishBehemoth @SpookyGh0st32 @last_call12 If you are all serious, let's talk properly about this sometime.  It doesn't have to exist just as a fantasy.
1311414589700083713 2020-10-01 05:16:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NaSionnach @Mag_Aodhgain17 @NationalPartyIE Well it appears nothing new is being said here, and as you say, "seemed", not "was".  So for the second time I say, we can agree on one thing so let us leave it at that and waste no further time.
1311406823493300233 2020-10-01 04:45:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NaSionnach @Mag_Aodhgain17 @NationalPartyIE It isn't - it's merely a fact.  You can appreciate that naturally if I choose not to eat animals for moral reasons, I regard the eating of animals as unethical.  It's not 'virtue signalling' to say I am #prolife and a #nationalist; nor is it to say I am a #vegan.  All facts.
1311405177598095360 2020-10-01 04:38:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NaSionnach @Mag_Aodhgain17 @NationalPartyIE This has nothing to do with the original point though.  The person I was replying to tried to use 'vegan' as some sort of insult, a fact which proves his immaturity.  I won't convince you, nor you me, so let's agree on #nationalism and leave it there.
1311404662243893255 2020-10-01 04:36:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NaSionnach @Mag_Aodhgain17 @NationalPartyIE I don't consume supplements - not merely an argument, but a fact.  I don't eat meat or dairy, nor take additional supplements, and a recent medical confirmed my health, in case you're interested.  The definition you provided doesn't apply to me, since that isn't my intent.
1311402583777476609 2020-10-01 04:28:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NaSionnach @Mag_Aodhgain17 @NationalPartyIE It isn't virtue signalling.  I make no apologies for wanting fewer people to eat animals.  You are not 'obliged' to do so - I am a marathon runner, among other things, have been a vegan for years and am in perfect health.  Why are some nationalists scared of this?
1311399770779512832 2020-10-01 04:17:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NaSionnach @Mag_Aodhgain17 @NationalPartyIE - It isn't a virtue signal, it's a fact - I don't eat meat or use any products derived from animals.  - If you cared about animals, you wouldn't eat them.  - His age does have relevance, he's a child.  - All of Europe is being invaded, Ireland as well as the Nordic region.
1311399289730596864 2020-10-01 04:15:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mag_Aodhgain17 @NationalPartyIE Merely pointing out that you're legally a child and I make no apologies for not taking your opinions seriously for that reason.  I am no defender of the Yellow Vests, but the @NationalPartyIE don't have all the answers, is the point.
1311367863895240708 2020-10-01 02:10:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mag_Aodhgain17 A few things...  - you're 17. - caring for animals differentiates me from jews and moslems. - you don't know my religious views. - you don't know where I'm from.  Point still stands re. @NationalPartyIE trying to claim sole ownership of Irish resistance - it has not earned that.
1311366953764827137 2020-10-01 02:07:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> 88 followers.  A 'nice, round number'...  https://t.co/8tmcUG4ToK
1311356605083127808 2020-10-01 01:25:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @spark2ignit3 @cursedsalad Yes but as long as we resist, they have not won.  They are seeking total control - as long as we reject that, there is hope.  #nationalism
1311356300484378624 2020-10-01 01:24:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 I hear you.  I just meant in general, it is reassuring to know that not all teachers are #globalist #NWO slaves - you're in a good position in terms of potential influence.  Keep the faith brother.
1311339060854747139 2020-10-01 00:16:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Agreed on all those points.  And you're a teacher? That is one piece of good news in an otherwise insane world.  Hopefully you can subtly impart some nationalist knowledge to subvert the #globalist #NWO propaganda.
1311327052356780032 2020-09-30 23:28:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @spark2ignit3 @cursedsalad There is a chance.  Stop using social media for a start.  Use of 'twitter' is a means to an end.  Make contact with others who share your views - DMs are open. We need to create systems entirely independent of theirs.  #nationalism
1311307682138206209 2020-09-30 22:11:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> Of course it is.  They themselves have no nation, and so attempt to destroy those who do.  That fact is just as clear about them, as the fact that their inner ugliness is always reflected in their exterior.  Fight and resist!  #everysingletime #replacementmigration #nationalism
1311283966419374083 2020-09-30 20:37:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> @DavidJa43681393 @ChrisWickNews You're still talking about someone who died 75 years ago.  You have far more pressing concerns, such as those carrying out these crimes against you right now, left and right.  The #globalist #NWO we are fighting is the opposite of national socialism. Wake up.  #PlandemicHoax
1311281922128203778 2020-09-30 20:29:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @RebBarrettNP It's true, we must not.  But how many more will have been demolished by the time the next general election comes around?  And the one after that?  Pinning all our hopes on electoral success is risky at best. Other routes must be taken also.  #nationalism
1311277777740607490 2020-09-30 20:12:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> Yes, and it is our responsibility to say, at every opportunity, every day, who it is that is responsible for this.  We all know the answer.  'Social media''s dedication to '#freespeech' prevents us from saying it here.  But in real life, it is our duty to do so.
1311269359533330432 2020-09-30 19:39:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> Maybe try listening to something other than manufactured #globalist #NWO distractions like that, to real music for example - you cannot speak of fight and resistance if you embrace fake art provided by a fake establishment.  Reject #MSM, including chart pop nonsense.
1311258590578126849 2020-09-30 18:56:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> Taking everything into consideration, would the world in 2020 be in a better or worse state, had the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan and allies) been victorious in the Second World War?
1311033594257776640 2020-09-30 04:02:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Thegael7 @GDLP4F @metpoliceuk Appreciate your response. I am not English myself but all Northern European natives need to band together now.  It is true what you say, but salvation will not come through conventional politics.  As long as we agree on that we can work together.  #nationalism
1311005053889720322 2020-09-30 02:08:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CKelly02003958 No, that's not what I mean.  Those are just one strand of the problem.  Even if all of the Zs disappeared, the problem remains.  #nationalism
1310989066012327936 2020-09-30 01:05:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Maximil86429959 That is exactly it...   we don't even have to say it. Ask anyone 'who controls the media and government?', and they are thinking the same thing as us, they just won't admit it.  If it was false, then why would 'Twitter' etc. ban accounts that state it?  #nationalism #MSM
1310980665169580034 2020-09-30 00:32:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel - Read, read, read, but take no action.  - Write to #globalist #NWO - run libraries to politely ask them to stop destroying nations.  - Vote for someone else to fix your problems.  These are the coward's methods. You cannot fix the system - it must be replaced.  #nationalism
1310974679201591298 2020-09-30 00:08:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> Not forgotten...  been brainwashed into hating, would be more accurate.  Brainwashed by the #globalist #NWO media - and we all know who that means.
1310870749465505792 2020-09-29 17:15:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @GabhaGael Yes, that's true.  I just meant that 'we' could not have gone in all guns blazing, because it would have entailed going to war also against the 'Free State', which had no interest in upsetting its British overlords.  I would not oppose that, but it would be a war on two fronts.
1310869780837150720 2020-09-29 17:11:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire Yes, also true.  It's clear to those of us who aren't in it for personal promotion however, I think, who is 'for real' and who isn't...  those who aren't we shouldn't waste our time on.  Equally, we must not self-censor because the (((media))) deems our beliefs 'offensive'.
1310677617826312192 2020-09-29 04:27:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire Of course, it should go without saying as responsible nationalists that we say what we mean.  And they're wrong when they accuse us of fundamentally 'hating' other races.  But no-one can tell anyone else what they may or may not love, or hate - that way lie 'hate speech' laws.
1310621666234466307 2020-09-29 00:45:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Turloughmighty Right.  And all her 'point' does is remind everyone of the fact that the Irish have faced more invasion and hardship than most nations, and that we would all be speaking Irish were it not for foreign aggression.  #nationalism
1310609412126539780 2020-09-28 23:56:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @ColmanOfGuaire and those are among the issues I am interested in discussing in detail, so do please get in touch directly at some point if you wish.
1310609098006818845 2020-09-28 23:55:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> Stand up to them, yes.  But learning the 'law'? It exists only to protect the 1% #globalist #NWO establishment.  The 'constitution'? A fantasy document for a fake 'Free State'.  They can do as they please. Fight them in other ways.  #nationalism
1310605108930064384 2020-09-28 23:39:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @ColmanOfGuaire You're mostly right but I don't underestimate the numbers... I agree there is no 'political' solution, hence the allusion to Castro etc. - and I've read the book!  No party can compete with the comforts/distractions the #globalist #NWO provides, so we must be the vanguard.
1310597971885649921 2020-09-28 23:11:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @ColmanOfGuaire ... as for the other point, that is why self-sufficiency is a fundamental principle today.  No voting; no paying taxes; no recognition of 'police' or 'government' authority; and the means to feed and defend one's own community.  There is still hope, but not through voting.
1310597557823864838 2020-09-28 23:09:42 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @ColmanOfGuaire On the other hand, if the will were there modern Ireland would be one of the easiest states to overthrow.  Its military is laughable, and if Castro and 80 men can defeat Batista's government in Cuba, it would be possible in Ireland...
1310597106575515648 2020-09-28 23:07:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> Not least the fact that they have not achieved this colonisation through their own efforts, but are merely being used as the pawns of those really responsible - and we all know who that means.  #nationalism
1310592019841122307 2020-09-28 22:47:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> Just look at what Coney Barrett looks like, compared to her predecessor.  Physiognomy never lies.  The enemy radiates putrid, anti-human evil inside and out, while white Europeans radiate dignity and beauty.  #everysingletime #nationalism
1310589410367373312 2020-09-28 22:37:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> This sums up every problem we are facing.  RT and support!  #nationalism
1310589275235287046 2020-09-28 22:36:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CitizenIre @YouTube The only thing I would add to this is that it is not a 'religious group', but I completely understand the difficulty in saying what you want to say given the kind of '#freespeech' social media allows.  You are 100% right about everything here - keep going friend.  #nationalism
1310587151583715329 2020-09-28 22:28:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'We'?  You people are all making the mistake of believing that the 'Free State' so-called 'Republic' of Ireland is an independent country. It never has been.  Divide and conquer.  Britain has maintained control over all of Ireland by allowing you your fake 'state'.  #nationalism
1310586150764109824 2020-09-28 22:24:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> It will never happen.  Stop wasting yours, and other people's, time with these sorts of questions.  If you haven't learned by now that there is one rule for them and another for the rest, there is no hope.  We know this; now do something about it.  #nationalism
1310567484022501376 2020-09-28 21:10:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> As nationalists, there are far more constructive uses of our time than justifying ourselves to #globalist #NWO slaves.  'Racism' is an utterly devalued term in any case; these days in fact it should be worn as a badge of honour, for it now means 'one who thinks independently'.
1310295266059321345 2020-09-28 03:08:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> The only way to fight this is to disengage from the (((establishment))) completely.  We need a new strategy - do not vote, do not pay tax, form our own systems far from their materialist poison to direct the fight from there.  #nationalism #deepstate #replacementmigration
1310243571572899840 2020-09-27 23:43:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 You're right.  It's just like Morrissey, who rightly criticises immigration from certain 'cultures' all the time, but is equally vocal about his support for 'Israel'/j***s, without seeing that the latter is what is responsible for the former.  #nationalism #PlandemicHoax
1310202167643570177 2020-09-27 20:58:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 There is no hope for establishment society, that is a fact.  No #nationalist party can gain mass support because of #globalist #NWO distractions and comforts/smartphones and materialism.  There are parallel communities, independent of the establishment - these are our only hope.
1309968903406268416 2020-09-27 05:31:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Mc188945 @BrianBoru941 It has been apparent for some time now that Ireland has been designated the #globalist #NWO's test lab for its most extreme, unashamed anti-national, anti-family, anti-tradition assault.  This is a war for survival, and all #nationalists must ready themselves appropriately.
1309968441470857217 2020-09-27 05:29:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine It has been apparent for some time now that Ireland has been designated the #globalist #NWO's test lab for its most extreme, unashamed anti-national, anti-family, anti-tradition assault.  This is a war for survival, and all #nationalists must ready themselves appropriately.
1309967664786427907 2020-09-27 05:26:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ScottyKBF @Acedset7 @metpoliceuk It cannot be overstated -  the police are your enemy. They always have been, and now more than ever.  'Twitter' prevents us from saying what should be done about this, devoted as it is to '#freespeech' - but anyone with a backbone knows anyway.  #PlandemicHoax #nationalism
1309966891188981760 2020-09-27 05:23:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> It doesn't.  The first thing anyone who wants freedom has to do is stop voting.  Political organisation among white natives: yes.  Relying on someone else to act in your interests and authorising them to act in your name: no.  The second thing: stop paying taxes.  #nationalism
1309964871782608896 2020-09-27 05:15:38 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 No, those are his genuine beliefs.  He opposes the #PlandemicHoax and rightly calls for Ireland's state propaganda arm to be shut down -  but he is on the record as stating that moslem immigration is 'necessary' - and he 'liked' the tweet you're replying to, as if it's funny...
1309640952324161538 2020-09-26 07:48:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> Look at the surnames.  There's a perfectly rational explanation.  'They' can do what they want.  The question is, who is going to do something about that fact?  #everysingletime #nationalism
1309614652255592455 2020-09-26 06:03:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> All of them are uneasy with the truth.  You don't sign up to join the 'Free State' #globalist #NWO 'police' to fight for truth. If the truth were known none of them would have a job.  They are there to defend lies, like the lie that Ireland is independent.
1309613543487045632 2020-09-26 05:59:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> Traitor.  This creature speaks of national destruction, while welcoming and enabling moslem immigration to Ireland.  De Brun is cut from the same cloth as SF. No nationalist should have anything to do with him.  #nationalism
1309611572688490496 2020-09-26 05:51:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO ... and in another infamous episode, telling me "You're not even Irish", based on, I can only assume, the fact that I can speak a language other than English.  There is no hope for unity if your response to independent thought is baseless claims and insults.  #Nationalism
1309610920931405834 2020-09-26 05:49:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO Like how you stopped replying to me, preferring to dismiss all critical thinking on nationalist strategy in favour of chanting 'Ireland for the Irish' and pinning your hopes on a 'nationalist' government getting elected?
1309607228178083842 2020-09-26 05:34:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Right.  If there's one thing we've all learned, it's who the cowards are and who'll fight for what's right.  That's the only reason the 'authorities' demand masks - an easy way to show them who they don't need to worry about and who thinks for him/her self.
1309604207738134539 2020-09-26 05:22:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Exactly! Some day some of us will be able to look back on this and feel pride in having done the right thing, while others have to live with their shame and cowardice forever.
1309603693105426433 2020-09-26 05:20:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> No.  No tolerance for mask-wearers. There is no virus but one of fear and conformity, and those submitting to it enable the #globalist #NWO to implement their oppression.  I don't need to claim childhood trauma to justify not wearing one - I am not answerable to anyone.
1309602750574067714 2020-09-26 05:16:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 That's what it comes down to.  This is that moment that those of us awake to the truth always feared would come - when they actually throw off the mask and attempt total population control by force.  It really is do or die at this point - we have no choice but to fight.
1309601042875797504 2020-09-26 05:09:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 100% correct - remarkable how the majority can't see such a simple truth.  Even if there was a virus, we could not put the world on hold - millions died in flu pandemics in the past and governments, rightly, did nothing.  But it is so clear that this 'virus' is just an excuse.
1309598848772431872 2020-09-26 05:01:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Very true.  I have always known the masses are brainwashed slaves and 'governments' power-mad scum, but just how enslaved people are has shocked even me this year.  It takes guts to stand firm when all around you people submit, I know from experience, so well done and keep it up.
1309596721769582593 2020-09-26 04:52:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Exactly...  if everyone minded their own business and helped where possible as you described, we would have no problems.  Problems arise when so-called 'politicians' and 'police' start trying to interfere in people's private lives.  You can never trust a 'lawman/woman'.
1309248775769198592 2020-09-25 05:50:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> Yes.  Also, the only commandment of the #globalist #NWO - they tell and enable all those who are not the 'chosen', to do what they want, knowing full well that this leads to the degenerate hell we are witnessing all around.  That's why they are called the 's*nagogue of Satan'.
1309248062880182273 2020-09-25 05:47:17 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 Many ordinary people are, yes.  Liar democratic 'politicians' and any who join the #globalist #NWO 'police', by definition cannot be good people.  I'm glad you got help though - when we stay away from 'government' and 'police' it's amazing how much better life can be.
1309245263446450176 2020-09-25 05:36:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine Let us hope so.  The sad fact is that a huge majority of so-called 'nationalists' still do not get that a certain 'religion' is their number 1 enemy; they will rant about blacks, moslems and more, but then declare their support for 'Israel'.  Real #nationalism knows the truth.
1309237687921053696 2020-09-25 05:06:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski They're not 'our' government, and they have always been puppets.  The WHO, the IMF... all establishment bodies = #globalist #NWO - and we all know who that means.  You're right, no tests - but to be truly free, no votes, no taxes. They are just enabling native replacement.
1309222097642807298 2020-09-25 04:04:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> We all know why -  because the #globalist #NWO, which runs your government also, commanded it.  These are basic issues.  It may not be easy for someone steeped in the political swamp to understand, but when you start to question these things perhaps you will awaken.  #nationalism
1309220878933204993 2020-09-25 03:59:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pad_Ban Yes! Taxation is theft - but so many willingly pay it and are suspicious of any opposition.  No party will promise to abolish it since that is what they all want - people's money.  But another kind of movement could do so. I have practical ideas on this if you wish to discuss.
1309219173470437377 2020-09-25 03:52:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @christianmorris We don't have to put up with it...  ... there are so many ways for individuals to free themselves, and if enough individuals do so, society itself is freed.  What we cannot do is wait for 'politicians', of any party, to save us - the system is irretrievably broken.  #nationalism
1309206324849278976 2020-09-25 03:01:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Johnnydoe891 Would be interested to hear your idea. Feel free to DM me about it if you want.
1309198659838529536 2020-09-25 02:30:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> Get your news from 'unbiased', #FreeSpeech supporting social media? Bad idea.  American tech firms are as much a part of the #globalist #NWO establishment as state broadcasters are.  This is a means to an end.  Don't rely on it.  #nationalism
1309197971410608129 2020-09-25 02:28:14 +0800 <JenDesNor> @fitzfromdublin All those getting excited about his involvement are in for a rude awakening.  He is a 'Senator'. He is as much a part of the #globalist #NWO establishment as it is possible to be.  Politicians won't fix this.  You can free yourself. Stop voting, stop paying 'tax'.  #nationalism
1308916887825387520 2020-09-24 07:51:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski @IRachelfree It's not just a dream.  In Ireland right now, this would be the easiest thing in the world to do if enough people were behind it.  It could be done on Oct. 10th, no problem. But it would have to be before the #globalist 'government' militarises the 'Gardaí' even more.
1308916823883210757 2020-09-24 07:51:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @suzy661 @karlwizowski It's not just a dream.

1308885047504703488 2020-09-24 05:44:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ProudGael It's not just in China. I was on a ferry in the Baltic Sea a few weeks ago, zero 'social distancing', no masks and nightclub open until the early hours.  Guess what - I didn't catch 'coronavirus'.  #PlandemicHoax #COVID19
1308883211032899586 2020-09-24 05:37:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @ProudGael Exactly.  I see it with my own family - believing every lie they are told, seeing the 'Irish Times' lying around when I visit, RTÉ  radio and TV on.  The thing is that I have never believed establishment lies, even before the internet; it makes it difficult to pity those who do.
1308873154073374725 2020-09-24 04:57:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly right.
1308872639612674050 2020-09-24 04:55:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @smackovsky @ColmanOfGuaire True... and we all know who the 1% is.  They are in fact literally 1% - 2% of the US population. Their influence is disproportionate, it is fair to say. Why?  We all know that too.
1308871677120598016 2020-09-24 04:51:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO Why am I not Irish? Because my account has a German title? Did you know it's possible to speak more than one language?  You don't know where I'm from.  You admit Collins is your hero - have you ever even heard of Liam Lynch? There is an Irishman worth commemorating.
1308870798820757504 2020-09-24 04:48:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @NationalistGlo1 @kelly_justkel @kfcrazyirish @MickO_Keeffe @NationalPartyIE I wouldn't bother continuing the 'debate' if I were you... sooner or later everyone interested in Irish nationalism comes up against 'Kelly' - she also dismissed this account using its number of followers as a 'reason', then muted me because she couldn't refute my arguments...
1308868373149896706 2020-09-24 04:38:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @THEIRISHCELT1 Very true.  The fact is that mob rule is no more appealing than oligarchy, for anyone with any intelligence at least.  But we cannot let them get away with it either. My own preference is for a network of #nationalist communities entirely independent of the establishment.
1308861575709810688 2020-09-24 04:11:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CatholicArena No #nationalist can call him- or her- self one if they follow this creature.  Why do you think he insults Christians? Because his 'background' requires it. 'They' can never be considered allies of #Christianity or #nationalism.
1308860536176734208 2020-09-24 04:07:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> If you must vote, IFP is certainly better than many alternatives.  But to truly be free...  stop voting. stop paying 'taxes'. stop recognising #globalist 'police'/'government' authority. learn to defend yourself.  If every Irish person does so, the nation is free. #nationalism
1308824237512196096 2020-09-24 01:43:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> The 'taxes' so-called nationalists continue to pay for their own replacement are key.  Tax resistance is one of the most basic elements required in the struggle.  Until people wake up to this and stop paying, there is no hope.  Stop funding your own destruction!  #nationalism
1308797515681148928 2020-09-23 23:56:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmanOfGuaire @THEIRISHCELT1 I think that even if we agree with the likes of McDowell on this issue, that does not make him an enemy of the #globalist #newworldorder.  A radical change is needed if things ever return to anything approaching 'normal', and I don't think there's a place for such as him in it.
1308796834475839494 2020-09-23 23:54:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @IeRealityparty You're right.  The problem is a growing number of people under the delusion that the crisis can be solved through the ballot box.  Extra-parliamentary solutions are required if the system is to change.  #nationalism
1308791770252226565 2020-09-23 23:34:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JohnTie42087180 @IeRealityparty @ColmanOfGuaire It never was.  Whether it existed or not is irrelevant; the effects on society are the same, and to the benefit of the #globalist #newworldorder as planned.
1308791397257015299 2020-09-23 23:32:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> @CitizenIre Exactly.  Justin Barrett appeared in a video early on to say that while freedoms were being abused, there really was a deadly virus.  G. O'D. on the other hand called it a #globalist scam from the beginning.  Barrett is entitled to change his mind, but G. O'D. was right on this.
1308791015776624645 2020-09-23 23:31:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Eoinseach @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE And participating in your enemies' rigged system is strong, by contrast?  We will see in four years where such strength gets you.  Weakness is putting an 'x' on a piece of paper and surrendering control over your fate to corrupt, venal politicians.  #nationalism
1308790323791966208 2020-09-23 23:28:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE If you are afraid of being arrested, it doesn't say much for the courage you could be expected to show when required.  I'm simply telling you a fact, which is that controlled opposition and the deep state mean you cannot win through the ballot box.  #nationalism
1308789931725279235 2020-09-23 23:26:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @BreaslainO @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE It's depressing, judging something by schoolgirl standards of how 'popular' it is...  there are plenty of solutions, and I haven't 'slung mud' even once.  Kelly, honestly the amount of followers you have won't translate into electoral success for NP. Consider your position.
1308789314852212737 2020-09-23 23:24:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Eoinseach @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE But you're just repeating the same 'insult' rather than attempting to explain your position.  If it's time you're concerned about, consider the next 4 years you'll have to wait, then another, and another...  the #globalist #newworldorder will not let you win. Fact.  #nationalism
1308787901325602816 2020-09-23 23:18:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Eoinseach @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE Why would you react in such a hostile manner to someone also devoted to saving his nation, and white nations generally?  I suspect ecause you know your approach is doomed.  Truthfully, I achieve more for mine and others' freedom in one day than your 'democracy' ever will.
1308787203104010241 2020-09-23 23:15:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE And for that matter, it would be far more honourable for any Irish patriot to die with a gun in his hands, shot by 'Free State' #globalist 'Gardaí', than to live out his days in this #newworldorder hell, placing an 'x' on a piece of paper every 4 years and hoping for the best.
1308786696193019904 2020-09-23 23:13:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @BreaslainO @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE I have a gun. I don't vote. I don't pay 'tax'. I refuse to recognise the legitimacy of #globalist 'police' and 'governments'.  And I assure you, I do more in a single day to free myself and white people from #newworldorder control than you have in your whole 'democratic' life.
1308781559131049984 2020-09-23 22:53:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE Neither am I, and it is important we both remember that. Unity, not infighting.  I've said, by all means campaign for NP; but no genuine #nationalist victory has happened in Europe since 1945.  There are alternatives, and liking a tweet smearing them as LARPing doesn't help...
1308779384468312075 2020-09-23 22:44:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE Nice soundbite.  No-one said you were doing the wrong thing, in fact I said the opposite. But you're wasting your time.  They have the power, and they will not hand it over even in the unlikely event that people woke up enough to vote NP.  Democracy is rigged. Fact.
1308778812658929664 2020-09-23 22:42:39 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Eoinseach @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE Is that directed at my account?  I barely even know what you are referring to, so free from #globalist #newworldorder media am I.  Real changes are happening in real communities right now; let's see how much progress you've made in 4 years, then you can wait another 4, etc. ...
1308773122120781826 2020-09-23 22:20:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @Chamaa @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE That's exactly what this person sounds like.  I was willing to hear them out at first but that's enough now.  #nationalism
1308772576882286600 2020-09-23 22:17:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE ... entirely away from #globalist #newworldorder systems.  Your work on 'Beyond Magenta' etc. is admirable, but look at what happened - they just lied to you.  The only solution is to stop using public libraries and create our own alternatives.
1308772297260650497 2020-09-23 22:16:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE What I mean is that constant political action every day, by individuals, is how we take control over our lives, not by entrusting other fallible human beings with our fates.  Creating collaborative #nationalist communities, a parallel society. It is already happening where I am.
1308771381102948354 2020-09-23 22:13:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Chamaa @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE I agree with you that the planet is in dire shape and needs to be saved, but in contrast to what you have been told by #globalist #newworldorder media, #Nationalism is in fact exactly what we need more of.  Every nation for itself and respecting the sovereignty of others.
1308768502677995523 2020-09-23 22:01:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @JaydonHeireann @Johnnydoe891 @MickO_Keeffe @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE Exactly.  Do you want a major change?  I do. Whatever it takes. And while I support most of the goals of the @NationalPartyIE, it is naive to believe the #globalist #newworldorder will surrender power without a fight.
1308768134309056514 2020-09-23 22:00:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MickO_Keeffe @Johnnydoe891 @kfcrazyirish @kelly_justkel @NationalPartyIE 'Representation' is not the be all and end all though.  They are not kidding themselves.  Pearse, Liam Lynch and others understood that the #globalist #newworldorder cannot be defeated through the ballot box.  Extra-parliamentary solutions are needed at the same time.
1308767374385065984 2020-09-23 21:57:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel @JaydonHeireann @Johnnydoe891 @MickO_Keeffe @kfcrazyirish @NationalPartyIE Yes we should support @NationalPartyIE.  But the points made in this thread are correct. Putting an 'x' on a piece of paper and then trusting someone else to look after you - that is the problem.  Great if NP won an election, but people need to realise that democracy is a sham.
1308747911203893248 2020-09-23 20:39:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> It's not enough just to say "This is appalling".  #veganism means: animals are not ours to eat or otherwise use.  If you believe in killing animals for food, you have more in common with moslems and j€ws than you realise.  #animalwelfare is a #nationalist issue!
1308744010144591873 2020-09-23 20:24:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JakeHepple1 @skorpionmouse Good luck with that.  If voting changed anything, it would not be allowed. On the contrary, they encourage it to keep people trapped in this delusion that they have a say.  There is a solution to this crisis, but it does not involve ballot boxes.  #nationalism
1308743079902486528 2020-09-23 20:20:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> Anyone who says that is promoting him or her self at the expense of the nation.  Disunity is our greatest obstacle - "divided we fall".  God knows I disagree with some of what she says but there is plenty of time for civil war after the war for independence has been won.
1308742286822510594 2020-09-23 20:17:31 +0800 <JenDesNor> There's a surprise - Coveney 'completely agreeing' with his E.U.-'Zionist' paymasters.  He was hardly going to disagree, was he?  There is a solution to this crisis, but it does not involve ballot boxes.  #nationalism
1308735732027207680 2020-09-23 19:51:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @soupminaj @JaydonHeireann You've already been judged.  There is no such thing as an 'Irish Nigerian'.  #WhiteLivesMatter
1308734956420640768 2020-09-23 19:48:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Seb_Aguanno Thank you, you too.
1308727786232778754 2020-09-23 19:19:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @rte Ireland can afford it, because of the 'taxes' so-called nationalists continue to pay for their own replacement.  Tax resistance is one of the most basic elements required in the struggle.  Until people wake up to this fact, there is no hope.  Stop funding your own destruction!
1308727080331378690 2020-09-23 19:17:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Seb_Aguanno Thank you, I'm sure it does but I have no need of further proof.  #globalists, #newworldorder, #illuminati... these are all real but are just other terms for that group Twitter etc. forbid us to name.  But we all know who they are and must never stop naming them in real life!
1308700790308114438 2020-09-23 17:32:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @macliam92 Good points, Collins shouldn't have signed and I certainly don't put DeValera on a pedestal.  But Liam Lynch and others who were murdered by the 'Free State' forces for fighting until the end against the treaty, I do put on a pedestal.  They are the true heroes.  #nationalism
1308546666811854852 2020-09-23 07:20:11 +0800 <JenDesNor> @macliam92 Don't take it personally - there is a cult of Collins-worship common to virtually all Irish nationalists, maybe not you;  I single him out because he could have stopped the executions but did not, and all the while wearing British uniforms and using British-supplied weapons.
1308545502926049289 2020-09-23 07:15:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel Being called 'far right' in 2020 is like being called a 'racist' or a 'Nazi' - it simply means the #globalist #newworldorder knows you are speaking the truth and is trying to stop you.  Wear it as a badge of honour because it shows your bravery.  #nationalism
1308544586973937666 2020-09-23 07:11:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> Anyone else never got a flu shot because their immune systems work and they oppose making trillions for the pharma industry by taking unnecessary medication?  Wake up people. Everything you have been told is a lie, not just the #Covidhoax2020.
1308543048830324740 2020-09-23 07:05:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leannemac4 @bonnie42280294 We're all falling out with loved ones over this, it is exactly what the #globalist #newworldorder wants - divide and conquer.  You know you are in the right and you are not alone - as others have said, stay strong and resolute. We will be proved right.  #PlandemicHoax
1308456895259250691 2020-09-23 01:23:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 Right - and saying so here on Twitter is enough to get you banned, as I have found out, which proves their control of the media. 'Free speech' is a myth - it exists nowhere in practice.  But those of us who do know have to spread the word IRL every day - wake people up.
1308434517070413826 2020-09-22 23:54:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> I've been at those parties, on the Baltic Sea also.  Those countries living under this oppression need to wake up and realise it is not happening everywhere, contrary to what their propaganda tells you.  There is no virus, only your own fear and conformity.  #PlandemicHoax
1308417611089182723 2020-09-22 22:47:22 +0800 <JenDesNor> You can talk all you like about legal approaches to the current crisis - tell that to all the people who have been arrested for not wearing a mask, despite stating that it causes them distress.  Desperate times call for desperate measures, not voting nor lawsuits.  #nationalism
1308406649800085507 2020-09-22 22:03:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ConorGallaghe_r @BobMurchu @hlinehan @TirChonaill1 @IrishTimes @bitchute This #globalist #newworldorder scum @ConorGallaghe_r, so terrified of life he wears a muzzle like a good compliant little slave, dares to talk of having children... when it is evil child-murderers like him with the blood of thousands of 'aborted' babies on their hands. #ProLife
1308402918756945924 2020-09-22 21:48:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael87802510 There are many issues to be addressed, and they can never be addressed if you recognise the legitimacy of someone named 'Patel' as British Home Secretary.  You cannot believe she has the interests of native white Britons at heart?  The rot goes deep; 'politicians' won't stop it.
1308360800734674945 2020-09-22 19:01:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> Just imagine for a second if there was a university class or other establishment event titled 'Abolishing blackness'.  There is a war against the white race, plain and simple.  And in times of war, it is not voting that is going to save you.  #Nationalism #replacementmigration
1308356812421378053 2020-09-22 18:45:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> The #PlandemicHoax never began in the first place, so it cannot be 'over'.  The reason those running the country are in power is because of the #globalist #newworldorder Deep State, and we all know who that means.  We need to create our own, independent, #nationalist communities!
1308356313223753728 2020-09-22 18:43:47 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Yes, and we all know who, or should we say what, is behind America's "sickening decay".  It can be resisted!  White Europeans must band together, away from American-owned social media - we can create our own autonomous nationalist communities, it is already happening where I am.
1308348951762960385 2020-09-22 18:14:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @thecovid19illu1 Exactly right.  And the requirement to wear a mask is there just to show the 'police' who they don't have to worry about, and who the 'disruptive elements', i.e. those who think for themselves, are.  We have to resist it at every level, every second of every day.  #plandemic
1308346577799598081 2020-09-22 18:05:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> Some of haven't been wearing masks, nor observing any of the other 'rules', and still have not caught 'coronavirus'.  That's because it doesn't exist.  As for who appointed them, the answer is the #globalist #newworldorder.  The question is who will stop them?  #nationalism
1308346082452221953 2020-09-22 18:03:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 We've got to be prepared to go to prison for this.  Admittedly where I am enforcement is not as it is in other countries, but I have not worn a mask at all, nor do I intend to.  Next is the forced vaccine. People must decide when they will make a stand.  You are not alone.
1308336390145482753 2020-09-22 17:24:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Chuckie_ar_la @dylan99_lu Valid points.  But, regardless of how long its "history with jews" is, it has made up for that in recent decades by becoming the main testing ground for globalism's #replacementmigration.  Also, other approaches to fighting those issues are failing; a more radical one is needed.
1308166766321963008 2020-09-22 06:10:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> @dylan99_lu No there isn't.  The question is, why not?  Who are nationalists trying to impress by scrambling to distance themselves from such iconography?  In doing so, they are proving that they too, just like the #globalists they claim to oppose, regard 'National Socialist' as an insult.
1307839837836316678 2020-09-21 08:31:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @beachbuminkerry AfD in Germany will never take power; these hopes only hold meaning if you believe democracy is transparent and not rigged.  None of these parties have had a victory. The 'immigrants' continue to flow in.  The establishment must be fought in more ways than just at the ballot box.
1307838574558171137 2020-09-21 08:26:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @beachbuminkerry It isn't pessimism, it is realism.  I fully support your work to fight the Deep State.  But there has been no genuine #nationalist victory in Europe since 1945 - the #globalist #newworldorder will not allow it.  We must take other routes in tandem with the electoral one.
1307800138031730688 2020-09-21 05:53:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> Mostly true.  But voting will not solve this crisis.  Patriots like @beachbuminkerry and others should be supported in every way. But claiming that conventional politics can change things is at best naive, and at worst an intentional perpetuation of the Deep State.
1307798792129970178 2020-09-21 05:48:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> The #globalist #newworldorder is what is preventing this.  And we all know who that means.  The question is, who is going to stop talking, and start doing something, about it?  #nationalism
1307460198852964352 2020-09-20 07:22:57 +0800 <JenDesNor> It is at best naïve, and at worst an intentional perpetuation of the Deep State, to expect or hope for salvation through conventional politics.  Stop voting. Stop paying 'taxes'. Stop complying with the 'police' and 'government'. Learn to defend yourself.  #nationalism
1307459821512396808 2020-09-20 07:21:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> We must move away from destructive tactics that seek to take power from the #NewWorldOrder, and move instead towards constructive tactics that seek to build an alternative.  Neither voting nor violence will stop them.  We can create our own world without them.  #nationalism
1307445682903691271 2020-09-20 06:25:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JaydonHeireann @LeoVaradkar is neither Irish, nor a man.  He speaks of 'protecting the vulnerable' after legalising the murder of babies in 2018.  The Irish health service should spend less time killing thousands of children and more on actually saving lives from real threats.
1307438174063538180 2020-09-20 05:55:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> "Where does one draw the line between free speech and inciting to riot?  If your speech is ineffective, it is protected by the Constitution.  If it is effective, you are 'inciting to riot'."  That's where they draw the line. Which means our speech is effective - keep it up.
1307432951517503491 2020-09-20 05:34:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JaydonHeireann That's the one.  But the real enemy in Lebanon, as everywhere else, is the #globalist #newworldorder which is behind every invasion.  Everyone knows who that means.
1304742743776862210 2020-09-12 19:24:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MariaLaoise No.  The solution is:  stop watching RTÉ. It is the official propaganda arm of the so-called 'Free State' and is designed to destroy all traces of #Nationalism.  Stop paying taxes of all kinds if you care about white races.
1304742044661878784 2020-09-12 19:21:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JRD0000 Eloquent?  'Abortion'-promoting parasite scum like this cannot speak even one language correctly.  'Travellers' are not Irish; they have no loyalty to the nation, and the way this creature is attired in the 'Senate' proves their unworthiness to participate in society.
1304574514236452866 2020-09-12 08:16:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'Everybody living on this island is Irish'?  That says it all.  The Yellow Vests in Ireland have veered so far from the path of the original movement in France they are parroting the same immigration insanity as the so-called 'government'.  Irish people are Irish - no-one else.
1304537250399752195 2020-09-12 05:48:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> (((Simon Harris))).  He must be one of (((them))), surely?  The slimy, fawning, weak manner. The high-pitched, nasal voice. The self-hatred.  If not, the time spent with his paymasters has really rubbed off on him.  He must be stopped by any means necessary.  #Nationalism
1304526989529931779 2020-09-12 05:07:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FredNurf @FiordLethal @Niall_Boylan @FatEmperor Ah, your answer is to have no principles - the 'if you can't beat them, join them' solution.  It has served cowards and traitors well for millennia.  If you're 'comfortable' wearing your mask and seeing your children brainwashed with so-called 'LGBT' propaganda, you're a slave.
1304524476269330437 2020-09-12 04:57:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FredNurf @FiordLethal @Niall_Boylan @FatEmperor Well I'm not going to argue the point, nor do I fully understand yours,  but we can agree that the tyranny of the majority is what right-thinking people are facing and a solution is required.  I have one.  #Nationalism
1304523509322874880 2020-09-12 04:53:36 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FredNurf @FiordLethal @Niall_Boylan @FatEmperor Thank you, I am familiar with the concept.  It is what makes democracy fundamentally problematic, not merely 'a downside', was my point.  Absolute, unwavering faith in the righteousness of our cause is the only thing that can stand against the brainwashed tide of the masses.
1304522935215026182 2020-09-12 04:51:19 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal People are beginning to wake up, it is true.  But if they do, they will awaken only to this 'crisis', then will immediately submit and conform again under the next.  There is no hope for mankind's IQ, only hope that the (((enemy))) can be defeated and the right people lead.
1304521135099387905 2020-09-12 04:44:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SAT_SLDR It will never happen under so-called 'democracy' in Ireland.  From the 'Free State' to the post-nationalism of today, the Irish nation has always been betrayed.  We cannot vote our way out of this crisis.  More emphasis on the second part of your pseudonym is the only solution.
1304520137106690055 2020-09-12 04:40:12 +0800 <JenDesNor> Right.  Now do all those who die daily in (((US/UK))) drone attacks around the world and ((('Israeli'))) assassinations.  9/11 didn't come from nowhere.  It can't be remembered out of context.  When the (((US))) stops its wars, wars against it stop.  #Nationalism
1304518543640334338 2020-09-12 04:33:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @mazca1982 @Pox_Populi2 @ClarkeMicah It doesn't have to be.  Leave the cities.  Stop paying taxes.  Free yourself, then organise with others who have already done so.  We can work together for an alternative, independent of the (((establishment))).
1304517576366723074 2020-09-12 04:30:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 We might disagree on the necessity of eating meat - I believe the meat industry is incompatible with N.S. principles - but we can agree on opposition to 'modernity'.  People mindlessly ingest what they are given with no comprehension of the cruelty and danger it involves.
1304514578320166923 2020-09-12 04:18:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PhilipDwyerNP It won't be our future, just like Martin and Varadkar are not Ireland's government.  We need to build separate communities independent of the (((establishment))) - remove our children from state schools - and stop paying 'taxes'!  #Nationalism
1304512818201452545 2020-09-12 04:11:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal That is exactly what the vast majority in Ireland have become, as a result of smartphone addiction, materialism and pornography.  The more they comply, the more important resistance like ours becomes.  Keep the faith - death before dishonour.  #Nationalism
1304512069488836610 2020-09-12 04:08:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FredNurf @FiordLethal @Niall_Boylan @FatEmperor 'a downside of democracy'... as if it can be swept under the carpet so easily?  It cannot. We must oppose said tyranny with all our might. The fewer people who have the courage to admit where their sympathies lie, the more important it is for we brave souls to fight even harder.
1304489566607486981 2020-09-12 02:38:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> Nationalists - stop paying taxes.  This is not just a slogan - it is an absolute necessity.   Every cent people pay is funding the destruction of their nations.  I don't do it. It is possible to disengage from the system without drawing attention.  Fight back every way you can.
1304481879618392066 2020-09-12 02:08:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ColmThornton @PhilipDwyerNP and the taxes you are so sensibly paying in Australia like an obedient slave, what are you getting in return?  Tyranny and oppression.  Stop fighting those whose side you should be on, and start fighting those who deserve to be fought.  #Nationalism
1304480474685992961 2020-09-12 02:02:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Indrani12170768 Though it must seem impossible for some, still anyone who cares about their family and nation has no choice.  Your approach just shows how sensible it is to think for oneself - you can actually enjoy yourself and connect to the world around you instead of just following orders.
1303389973664722944 2020-09-09 01:49:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JakesOlasupo It's 'tries', and I don't have to, I just am.  Also, the one who can speak correctly is not the idiot.  Also, telling, the kind of person you identify with in that video.
1303386910828769282 2020-09-09 01:37:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JakesOlasupo Be 'a' grammar police?  Can you write a single message in correct English?  And ironic that someone so concerned about 'racism' is desperate to live in the countries of his 'oppressors'. That's insecurity.
1303383179424923648 2020-09-09 01:22:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JakesOlasupo It matters.  The ability to understand meaning and speak correctly is one indicator of a group's innate superiority.  Standards are important, and it is those we are fighting to uphold.
1303377575482478593 2020-09-09 01:00:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> Because it's "Why do you call them stupid?", not what you said.  That's why they are stupid.
1303362953891196930 2020-09-09 00:01:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> ... the (((#globalist))) police still detained marchers for doing so and confiscated their flag, they are now being investigated for 'hate speech'.  The (((tentacles))) are everywhere.  As said - why this suppression of free speech if the 'holocaust' were true?
1303326610226114563 2020-09-08 21:37:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 A vegan who supports hunting?  We are making some progress here, don't throw it away.  Concern for #animalwelfare is a hallmark of civilised people, and it takes priority over many other concerns.
1303326158503772160 2020-09-08 21:35:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Maximil86429959 @FiordLethal All nationalists must follow this example.  Reject (((establishment))) media completely.

1303325431773491200 2020-09-08 21:32:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PhilipDwyerNP Irish taxpayers.  That's who.  So, regardless of the consequences, all Irish men and women who oppose their own replacement must stop paying taxes NOW.  Every cent is funding your own destruction.  #nationalism
1303321970218545158 2020-09-08 21:19:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 More contradictions.  If you care about animals, don't eat them.  There is no need to hunt animals as a human.  I don't - why should anyone else have to?  Muslims and (((Js))) don't even hunt - they slaughter defenceless innocent creatures.
1303321475395588103 2020-09-08 21:17:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> Here we go again.  'Female genital mutilation' - but no mention of the Muslims and (((Js))) who inflict the same on all male children.  Don't be a coward @JohnCleese - those two 'cultures' are also inferior for the same reason, say so.  Or do boys matter less than girls?
1303320437523394561 2020-09-08 21:13:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 Then end your support for Muslims and (((Js))) immediately.  Research 'kosher' and 'halal' slaughter, and ask your local Muslims and (((Js))) what they think of it.  Open your eyes.
1303320122241810432 2020-09-08 21:11:46 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 @leftistluthien Exactly.  How to tell a brainwashed (((#newworldorder))) stooge immediately - repeats the lie drummed into them by the establishment.
1303319532371574784 2020-09-08 21:09:25 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 You defend pagans' practise of animal sacrifice, but then suggest that Muslims who don't endorse it are 'better' than those who do.  Incidentally you are dead wrong - Muslims are required to eat 'halal' food, which means 'from an animal whose throat was slit'.
1303318899849662464 2020-09-08 21:06:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 If you believe (((#globalist #newworldorder))) propaganda, that is.  Anyway one animal's life is worth a billion of (((theirs))).
1303317412591394817 2020-09-08 21:01:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 ... and that both #Islam and (((the tribe))) practise brutal, barbaric slaughter of animals as a fundamental part of their beliefs, openly stating that they view animals as property to be exploited.  A significant reason why both must be opposed everywhere.  #AnimalWelfare
1303316964950134786 2020-09-08 20:59:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 Credit where it is due, I am all for allying despite disagreements and glad you took the time to read my bio.  I must point out though that N.S. enacted historic animal welfare laws such as banning foie gras before anywhere else; and that A.H., like me, was a vegetarian.
1303310618003468288 2020-09-08 20:34:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> @leftistluthien @Pox_Populi2 Why not?  Because you have been brainwashed by the (((US 'entertainment' industry))) and the (((#globalist #newworldorder))) into believing that N.S. is evil.  That's the first thing you'll unlearn when you do real 'research'.
1303305020264321025 2020-09-08 20:11:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> All so-called 'democracies' are by their very nature corrupt.  But there is a special place in hell reserved for the so-called 'government' of #Ireland, and those who vote for, and obey, it.  Corruption, hypocrisy and police brutality there is like that of a third-world country.
1303302952787021824 2020-09-08 20:03:32 +0800 <JenDesNor> @RommelRory Indeed.  Which only goes to prove the lie that 'developed' countries are liberated.  The most 'developed' are those most enslaved by the (((#globalist #newworldorder))), the most docile, the least likely to resist because they fear losing the materialist comforts they are fed.
1303291377485262854 2020-09-08 19:17:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> No masks.  If the police arrest you, fake name and address.  If they find out your real one, don't pay the fine.  There are so many ways to fight - the (((#globalist #newworldorder))) relies on people's fear and conformism.  Stop being afraid - stop conforming.  #nationalism

1303087850649460736 2020-09-08 05:48:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> There is a divide between the police and the public, and the wider it is, so more people see it, the better.

So let's focus on today - it is you who keeps mentioning '#Nazis'.  Time enough for disagreement if and when we defeat the current oppressors.
1303022068318048261 2020-09-08 01:27:24 +0800 <JenDesNor> @thecovid19illu1 @RockefellerFdn @CarnegieCorp Not true.  They did not simply round up innocent Germans to be exterminated. You're reading straight from the post-war 'Germans are evil and Nazis are really evil' propaganda manual.  More or less everything you believe about that period is a lie.

The same reason that '#Israel' has its tentacles wrapped around everything else.  They are 'the chosen', that's all they need to say to 'justify' anything.  And that's all the reason we need to give for fighting them.

1302976385464627200 2020-09-07 22:25:53 +0800 <JenDesNor> @thecovid19illu1 We've had this discussion before, and I won't waste my time or yours continuing it, but I won't allow misinformation or slurs against N.S. to go unchallenged.  Let us focus on opposing the (((#coronavirus #COVID19 #COVID1984 #plandemic))) together, not on cheap name-calling.
1302972932235431936 2020-09-07 22:12:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 Yes, it has spread too deep for the masses to be saved.  But we can be the vanguard.  Your spiritual solution is in no way incompatible with #nationalism - both share the same moral values, even if nationalism seeks justice in this life foremost.  We must ally wherever possible.
1302965278373015553 2020-09-07 21:41:44 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 It's a fact, not just your own thoughts.  It is irreversible in terms of wider society, this is true.  Regulation of the internet is a prerequisite if anything is to be salvaged.  Small-scale (to start) autonomous #nationalist communities are the only hope.
1302958351211429888 2020-09-07 21:14:13 +0800 <JenDesNor> @8ismyfavourite1 @ReadLinkola Yes.  Please visit   https://t.co/vSsHiUP81G for more information and make contact there.  There is much that we can do if we unite. #Nationalism
1302909308636737536 2020-09-07 17:59:20 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 @FiordLethal Yes, that is very true.  Its very existence is a threat to every government that does not obey its commands.
1302904080457699328 2020-09-07 17:38:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> Nobody has died from #COVIDー19.  It is a (((#globalist #newworldorder))) scam designed to terrify gullible idiots into surrendering their so-called 'freedoms'.  The virus does not exist.  Government tyranny does - that is what nationalists should 'never forget'. #Nationalism
1302897416421728256 2020-09-07 17:12:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 @FiordLethal Believing that China and Russia are the 'enemy', and that the US which has invaded and bombed more countries than every other nation combined is innocent, is exactly what Zionist propaganda wants.  The first thing people must understand is that the US government is not an ally.
1302745359941349377 2020-09-07 07:07:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 @FiordLethal That's a start.  We don't have to agree on everything, and the occultism associated with N.S. has been hugely exaggerated as part of the postwar propaganda campaign.
1302729697101516800 2020-09-07 06:05:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Exactly. Openly declaring the kind of master-slave future they want to see.  The problem is that these days (((they))) are becoming so emboldened they don't even try to hide the fact of their power as they used to...
1302728744981934080 2020-09-07 06:01:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> You're right - it serves no purpose but to make slaves of ordinary people.  The best thing patriots and nationalists can do is reject it, embracing tradition instead.  #nationalism
1302718335809880065 2020-09-07 05:20:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> Right on all points, except:  we must not fear social ostracism. Why would we want to be part of (((#globalist #newworldorder))) society?  We need to fearlessly embrace being part of our own society, not theirs, and work together to replace the establishment.  #nationalism
1302714501553418242 2020-09-07 05:05:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 No, but if I were a bus driver I wouldn't ask people to conform to (((#globalist))) submission - I know some think it's easy for me to say because I don't work in a job where I'm forced to wear a mask.  But this is that moment we've all known was coming - have to take a stand!
1302617618172477440 2020-09-06 22:40:16 +0800 <JenDesNor> ... and nor are the current wave of invaders.  It is possible to have more than one enemy, and it is Ireland's misfortune that she does.  True nationalists realise this.
1302610880002170880 2020-09-06 22:13:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @JebJason33 Yes, correct.  No country is perfect but Germany's history shows that it was far closer to that state than most, until 1945.
1302610581715853312 2020-09-06 22:12:18 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP ... that it is not socialism that is tyranny, not capitalism that is tyranny - it is tyranny that is tyranny.  Neither the UK nor Germany is a socialist country and free speech has been outlawed there for decades.  Capitalism has at least as many flaws as socialism. #nationalism
1302610143771791367 2020-09-06 22:10:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP It certainly looks like pro EU propaganda since it uncritically repeats the original.  As for knowing what we're up against, I would have replied to you sooner but have just been suspended for alleged 'hateful' speech, which was anything but - believe me I know.  The point is...
1302609533416755200 2020-09-06 22:08:08 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @JebJason33 Certainly, their entire existence is a lie...

1302608244926550019 2020-09-06 22:03:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 @FiordLethal It's good to see more people opening their minds to the truth.  If you want to know who really runs the show, just ask 'why am I allowed to criticise everyone but (((them)))?'  I've just been suspended for 12 hrs because a tweet which didn't even mention them 'glorified violence.
1302297435004338176 2020-09-06 01:27:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP Do you see the (((EU))) flag all over the propaganda you're forwarding?  Is that where official party policy is coming from?  I hope not.  #nationalism
1302293732587429889 2020-09-06 01:13:15 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @JebJason33 Exactly.  That is some good research you have there. Those who criticise (((#globalism))), but then also rant against National Socialism, all have one thing in common -  they complain endlessly but provide no solution.  National Socialism provides the solution to all problems.
1302292534274723842 2020-09-06 01:08:30 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PaulMcWeeneyNP @JamesReynoldsNP Recycling stale (((US))) propaganda is not a good look for any true nationalist.  Tell me again how great #capitalism is: stop paying your property tax and then see who really owns your 'private property'.  National socialism, not national capitalism, is the only solution.
1302262630560739329 2020-09-05 23:09:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JebJason33 @FiordLethal Warburg left Germany for the (((US))) in 1938.  He would have met the same fate as his (((people))) had he remained.  National socialism is the opposite of (((them))), you're better off picking an argument somewhere else because you can't win this one.  #nationalism
1302261830262427650 2020-09-05 23:06:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @ChristophersKn1 We have nothing to discuss - you take your route and we'll take ours.  That's like saying Christianity has been destroyed - they have not, they are both fighting for their lives but still live, as long as you believe in your system, and we believe in ours.
1301989654623916032 2020-09-05 05:04:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> 'Most people', yes.  Those of us who are not, must choose our next step wisely.  Going to prison for our beliefs is a possibility - but if we are smart we can follow a more productive path to salvation, entirely outside (((their))) establishment.  #nationalism
1301988945719431175 2020-09-05 05:02:09 +0800 <JenDesNor> Jews, Zionists, it doesn't matter.  Imagine a world without either.  Who can say truthfully such a world would not be a better place?  #nationalism
1301986411760037891 2020-09-05 04:52:04 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Scifo76943185 True, it does.  But it will not allow itself simply to be abolished, and while the numbers are encouraging, as long as the 'Gardaí' have overwhelming force they will win.  As well as numbers we need, above all, courage and organisation.
1301985862540984320 2020-09-05 04:49:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JarlEardwulf I have hope also, but hope alone without action is a mere dream.  Actions, not words - that is what we need to see more of if the natural order is to prevail.  Most important is that we all keep the faith. #nationalism
1301980753660702721 2020-09-05 04:29:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JarlEardwulf Very true.  It is a real sacrifice now though and requires total commitment - one can no longer simply have children and sent them off to school, one must educate them oneself to ensure they are free of (((#globalist #newworldorder))) brainwashing.  Radical solutions are needed.
1301980076205109250 2020-09-05 04:26:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> And guess (((who))) is behind both of them?  Never forget this. Every degenerate, evil, sick and twisted phenomenon on Earth has (((them))) at its heart.  Nationalists - you know what needs to be done.  #nationalism #newworldorder #globalism
1301978705032630274 2020-09-05 04:21:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @JebJason33 Keep this up - every time someone throws out the old 'Hitler was funded by Zionists' nonsense line, challenge it.  As you said, none of this would be happening had National Socialism been victorious.  Everyone is waking up to that fact, we need to keep the faith while they do.
1301977703805890561 2020-09-05 04:17:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> Still can't believe it?  Time to wake up then... there is nothing (((the enemy))) will not stoop to, and no depths of submission the masses will not sink to.  You cannot fight this 'lawfully' - everyone must stop dreaming and realise this is a war against tyranny. #nationalism
1301968682453790720 2020-09-05 03:41:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> So-called '#LGBT' insanity  Pornography  'Abortion'  The spread of Islam  'Open borders'  ... (((they))) are responsible for every problem we face, and always have been.  Nationalists - you know what to do. #nationalism
1301964288387698688 2020-09-05 03:24:10 +0800 <JenDesNor> This just shows these idiots' total lack of comprehension of what they are dealing with -  do they really think that the majority of Palestinians support 'pride' flags?  or that the 'EU' gives a damn about Palestine?  It would be hilarious if it wasn't so serious.  #nationalism
1301677040182190082 2020-09-04 08:22:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> National Socialism = no international finance parasites no non-European immigration 0% unemployment universal healthcare minimum wage protected by law low taxes relative to capitalist Western nations animal welfare no 'abortion', pornography or so-called 'L.G.B.T.' insanity
1301676237572710401 2020-09-04 08:19:33 +0800 <JenDesNor> @JaydonHeireann True. But simply believing they will, won't make it happen, unfortunately.  We have to ensure it does.  Until the day comes, we must all live by a rigid code that treats them as an avowed foe and never cooperate nor recognise their 'authority'.

What is important is that we all continue opposing the #plandemic '#coronavirus' and all of its associated madness, regardless of our reasons.
1301549601573539843 2020-09-03 23:56:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @AlaraStarShine Yes of course, just a more sinister and less high-profile one... well done for shining a light there.  It is so important that people know who these (((creatures))) are that are responsible for the hell they are living in.

Your solution appears to be anarchy, which in fact I consider the next best thing... but if people want to live together, National Socialism is the only way to do so in peace.
1301548510098206720 2020-09-03 23:52:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> @thecovid19illu1 @RockefellerFdn @CarnegieCorp Well we certainly don't agree on this, since I fully support the PRC's dominion over its native territory in Hong Kong.  As I said, no system is compatible with individual freedom - we do agree on that. I don't 'think I need a ruler', I want to see justice done...
1301543204160966657 2020-09-03 23:30:56 +0800 <JenDesNor> @thecovid19illu1 @RockefellerFdn @CarnegieCorp ... once we have dealt with the problems currently facing us.  No political system is fully compatible with individual freedom; the least bad, and least hypocritical, option must therefore be the obvious solution.
1301542745467740160 2020-09-03 23:29:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> @thecovid19illu1 @RockefellerFdn @CarnegieCorp I agree that tyranny is tyranny.  But I disagree that National Socialism as in the Third Reich was tyranny - on the contrary, it was liberation from J€wish materialism and represented the ultimate love of nation and people.  Plenty of time to argue about what comes after...
1301539911003144193 2020-09-03 23:17:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @thecovid19illu1 @RockefellerFdn @CarnegieCorp I'm not going to get dragged into this discussion.  Had the Third Reich not been destroyed by its (((enemies))), none of the madness we are currently experiencing would be an issue.  National Socialism provides the solution, it does not simply complain about the problem.
1301523210450751490 2020-09-03 22:11:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Lagud5 They were made to do so in Germany in the past, and can be made to do so again.  That starts with all nationalists living a life utterly free of their clutches - no iPhone, no Netflix, no Google, no #MSM.
1301521166637637634 2020-09-03 22:03:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @PhilipDwyerNP @PQuinlanNP Well done Philip, we need more fearless leadership unafraid to raise awareness of the sinister (((#globalist #newworldorder))) plot to destroy nations and childhoods.  Physical force #nationalism, boots on the ground like you are doing. Full support.
1301509170198441984 2020-09-03 21:15:41 +0800 <JenDesNor> This is 'democracy' in action.  Those who vote - you think you have power and that politicians are accountable, but they simply make up 'laws' as they go along and you can do nothing to oppose it.  Stop participating in this deep state farce - research 'controlled opposition'.
1301508590130417672 2020-09-03 21:13:23 +0800 <JenDesNor> @gael_keith @DailyMailUK @MailOnline Right, except there is no need for any immunity since the entire '#plandemic' is merely a (((#globalist))) psyop...
1301476784224043010 2020-09-03 19:07:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Turloughmighty What I mean is, of course anything is possible with the 'post-national' (((#globalist))) authorities in power, and it could theoretically happen -  but this talk of a new 'city' is distracting people from the real problems at hand right now.
1301475463903281152 2020-09-03 19:01:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Turloughmighty This will never happen.  It is just another (((media))) psyop designed to make people believe the destruction of their nations is natural and inevitable, weakening their will so that the current invasion will go unopposed.  It must be fought with deeds, not words! #nationalism
1301206875329961984 2020-09-03 01:14:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @gerrywebster True, but it's hardly the same thing.  David Icke is fairly irrelevant, but I think #GemmaoDoherty has the right goal, she just falls into the trap of labelling her enemies 'nazis' after a lifetime of conditioning.  We can't expect everyone to get everything right all the time.
1301201614640951301 2020-09-03 00:53:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> @karlwizowski Welcome to the club.  No TV, no smartphone, no 'Netflix', no Facebook = no brainwashing.  I gave up TV years ago and have never used the others.  This is as close to freedom as it gets. #Nationalism #NewWorldOrder
1301193597203755017 2020-09-03 00:21:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael87802510 It doesn't sound extreme.  I don't recognise 'extremism' - one either loves one's nation, or is a traitor, there are no moderate positions.  You're right, that's exactly what it is. #Nationalism
1301188551967739904 2020-09-03 00:01:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> Boycott it.  Simple.  Why would any nationalist use (((#globalist #newworldorder))) propaganda?
1301183533646598146 2020-09-02 23:41:43 +0800 <JenDesNor> @MickO_Keeffe We should not need to emphasise 'peacefully'.  Our enemies, including the 'Gardaí', will not hesitate to use force.  This is moving beyond politics into warfare, and though we didn't start this fight, we should be prepared to finish it.  #nationalism #plandemic #COVID1984
1301160657413378048 2020-09-02 22:10:49 +0800 <JenDesNor> National socialism or extinction. #Nationalism
1301157552579805188 2020-09-02 21:58:29 +0800 <JenDesNor> @FiordLethal @gerrywebster She needs to stop using 'nazi' as an insult, but otherwise your comment makes no sense to me.  Only when people opposing the (((#globalist #newworldorder))) realise that National Socialism is on their side can we succeed.
1301150404055625728 2020-09-02 21:30:05 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 Fully understand your considering relocation. However every major city in Europe is in the same situation now.  I fully believe the only solution in the short to medium term is establishing autonomous white native communities away from (((establishment))) cities... must discuss.
1301147612582731777 2020-09-02 21:18:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 ... even if it was 90% invaders and 10% natives, we could reverse it if enough whites took it seriously.  Again right - people should have. But we can't change what's happened, only focus on fighting back - and it is moving into a war phase, rather than a political one.
1301147261687205888 2020-09-02 21:17:35 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 I am based between Scandinavia, Germany and Ireland, mostly in the former lately. You're right, Sweden is much worse than the others so far - but I don't think it's beyond repair. White people can achieve anything if the will to do so is there...
1301139037198135296 2020-09-02 20:44:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> Trump's daughter converted to another (((religion))) so she could marry a billionaire 'Zionist'.  That is all anyone needs to know about Trump.  He worships money (capitalism), not his country, and is therefore an enemy of #Nationalism.
1301136510171918336 2020-09-02 20:34:52 +0800 <JenDesNor> Exactly right... (((#globalist))) deep state controlled opposition.  Democracy is a sham.  Any alternative is better, because at least it would be honest.  #nationalism
1301135765242621953 2020-09-02 20:31:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> I know it's not an easy choice to make, and not an option at all for some people, but homeschooling is really the only way forward.  The situation is not going to improve, it is going to get worse... and we have to fight back against the (((#globalist #newworldorder))).
1301134036472037376 2020-09-02 20:25:02 +0800 <JenDesNor> True. The very fact that pro-'abortion' people always ask that question proves how little they believe in their argument: if they had truly thought about it, and had the courage of their convictions, they would simply say 'abortion is fine, full stop'. But they don't... #ProLife
1301133459231043585 2020-09-02 20:22:45 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Pox_Populi2 In Sweden and also in Finland, for example, there has basically been no 'pandemic' apart from international travel restrictions.  Brainwashed idiots in capital cities wearing masks - otherwise, life as normal for the last six months.
1300849515323420674 2020-09-02 01:34:27 +0800 <JenDesNor> @silverf29093450 @gerrywebster I didn't doubt that you do, I can tell a real patriot immediately.  We need to take the law into our own hands on this issue, the 'Gardaí' are not going to help.
1300839250917838848 2020-09-02 00:53:40 +0800 <JenDesNor> @silverf29093450 @gerrywebster We know why (((mainstream media))) is not reporting on this.  We cannot vote our way out of this problem.  We need direct action against the (((#globalist #newworldorder))) responsible for this situation!  Remember - the so-called 'Gardaí' are target, just like the invaders.
1300839227505213440 2020-09-02 00:53:34 +0800 <JenDesNor> We know why (((mainstream media))) is not reporting on this.  We cannot vote our way out of this problem.

1300834078820831235 2020-09-02 00:33:07 +0800 <JenDesNor> @SaoMc2 Fake name and address. Simple.  They have no authority over Irish men and women, they are your enemy - so treat them accordingly.  #nationalism
1300834042925940738 2020-09-02 00:32:58 +0800 <JenDesNor> Fake name and address. Simple.  They have no authority over Irish men and women, they are your enemy - so treat them accordingly.  #nationalism
1300833038633521153 2020-09-02 00:28:59 +0800 <JenDesNor> Take a look at the first picture in this (otherwise #globalist propaganda) article:  what a glorious sight!  After 75 years of relentless (((#NewWorldOrder))) lies, the black-white-red real German flag in the heart of Berlin!  'God with us', it states. There is still hope!
1300832857624059904 2020-09-02 00:28:16 +0800 <JenDesNor>  https://t.co/yyyeDVT4jT
1300821215448379392 2020-09-01 23:42:00 +0800 <JenDesNor> @Michael87802510 and that is why the law should not be obeyed by our side.  Until it applies to all, it applies to none!
1300817967203188737 2020-09-01 23:29:06 +0800 <JenDesNor> Imagine if these were 'young nationalists' throwing bombs - years in prison and their names execrated in the (((press))) as 'racists', even though we have more justification for such actions than anyone. #nationalism
1300812411398750208 2020-09-01 23:07:01 +0800 <JenDesNor> Yes, for the benefit of the (((#globalist #newworldorder))) which hates everything human, good and pure.  Vandalism against these monstrosities is the duty of every nationalist!
1300803212665139200 2020-09-01 22:30:28 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel For example, I totally support your great work re. 'Beyond Magenta' - but as you said, they simply lied to you and continued to stock it. Mr Dwyer's complaint to the police will be similarly dismissed. Seeking the change we want 'lawfully', in my opinion, is doomed to failure.
1300802746422001665 2020-09-01 22:28:37 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel and finally, desperate times call for desperate measure, and when police forces and governments carry out violence against their own citizens, I can fully understand people who consider option 1) viable. Resistance in any form is a moral imperative at this point.
1300802318342983687 2020-09-01 22:26:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel ... such as establishing collaborative communities entirely independent of the (((establishment))).  As for Hungary and Poland, (((Netflix))) propaganda etc. continues to infect the minds of the people there - we need a solution for all of society, not just those in parliament.
1300801796005400578 2020-09-01 22:24:50 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel I'm not saying we can't try it, and I fully support the efforts of @NationalPartyIE et al - but they may not be enough.  There are other options besides violence and elections.  We need to move away from destructive tactics and focus on constructive ones...
1300798794896936965 2020-09-01 22:12:55 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel I agree with you on resistance and civil disobedience, and I'm not advocating for violence, but for an alternative strategy.  I think those depending on the ballot box should prepare  for disappointment and consider what other approaches they may need to adopt also.
1300798264447467521 2020-09-01 22:10:48 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel They already are against us. 'Just doing my job' is never an excuse - people have a conscience and a mind of their own.
1300783826168406022 2020-09-01 21:13:26 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel I suppose it comes down to whether you believe the situation can be changed 'lawfully' or not - I do not, and regard the 'Gardaí' as the enemy of the Irish people.  But there is room for disagreement as long as we all want the same thing in the end - our country back!
1300783478951366661 2020-09-01 21:12:03 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel Agreed about the double standards, and of course we can differ on tactics.  Personally I think the more people who do refuse, the better - I have utter contempt for rank and file police, they are not conscripted, they know exactly what (((agenda))) they are signing up to serve.
1300778270749794305 2020-09-01 20:51:21 +0800 <JenDesNor> @kelly_justkel That was precisely why - she was aiming to show the true face of the 'government''s footsoldiers. I think the fundamental issue here is recognising the legitimacy of a 'law' which exists only to maintain the illusion that Ireland is a free country and to protect those in power.
1300733109168738305 2020-09-01 17:51:54 +0800 <JenDesNor> I have never paid a TV license fee and I never will - all nationalists should withhold all 'taxes', by any means necessary!  Paying them is funding your own replacement and destruction!  #nationalism #replacementmigration #NewWorldOrder
