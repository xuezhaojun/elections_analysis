It was made up from a completely botched supreme court ruling. It's never mentioned anywhere in the constitution, but the right to life is.

1343696878186029056 2020-12-29 07:14:35 +0800 <jk1087> The left has spent decades infiltrating our schools, our higher education, our churches, and our media.

1343449884746117125 2020-12-28 14:53:07 +0800 <jk1087> The death of conservatism absolutely stems from the fade of religion. We have chaos because no one believes there is a higher power to answer to. We must save religion to save America.

1341874405119381504 2020-12-24 06:32:43 +0800 <jk1087> @DavidLoveDoge @Adult @realDonaldTrump Out of curiosity, what's more important to you, people getting fair covid relief or a few national parks shutting down for a couple of days? Because I'd personally rather pass a fair bill than worry about a shutdown
1341870361026068482 2020-12-24 06:16:39 +0800 <jk1087> @Adult @DavidLoveDoge @realDonaldTrump I agree. I still love crypto but we will have nothing left if we don't work to save America right now. I love all my crypto friends but right now I have to take a stand for good. Lost a lot of followers, but if you don't stand for something ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

He seemed to be of great upstanding character to me and millions agree. It was a completely partisan character assassination.

C'mon people, emotion has to stay OUT of the process of justice. Always innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

1340776011307225088 2020-12-21 05:48:06 +0800 <jk1087> @JonathanTourjee @holy_schnitt Well unfortunately right now both the left and the right are filled with political elite and corporate backed politicians who only care about the interests of corps. Thats why they both fight The Pres at every corner. Hoping he can turn that around. No disrespect brother! üëä

1340437270675898369 2020-12-20 07:22:04 +0800 <jk1087> @JonathanTourjee @holy_schnitt If you literally look up the definition of liberalism it's all about only caring about the individual. Conservatism cares about structure and community. In fact, family is one of the fundamental principals of conservatism. Chart explaining why we care so much abt that:  https://t.co/6sfLaMABXV
1340389018953949184 2020-12-20 04:10:19 +0800 <jk1087> @JonathanTourjee @holy_schnitt No. I meant you still should be üòÇ liberalism is a selfish ideology. But oh well haha

1339688742198550528 2020-12-18 05:47:41 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech I'm with you 100% there. A member of my family has a business, and chose to comply with our states lockdown, and couldn't get the bank to give anything because they were too busy handing out to billion dollar corps. Unreal.
1339686813821104129 2020-12-18 05:40:01 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech Than to hand out to a bunch of small businesses who *actually* needed the money. But we both know big banks have a history of that kind of corruption
1339686606299525120 2020-12-18 05:39:11 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech I agree 100%. Even though I hate government, it's not even entirely their fault for once. They promised the banks repayment on the loans and put the ball in their court to hand out money. And they realized it would be easier to handout giant lumpsums to large corporations..
1339685515121971200 2020-12-18 05:34:51 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech I mourn everyone's losses greatly‚Äîof course. But the suffering some are/will experience including children who rely on parents for sustenance, if the economy collapses, would also bring me great distress. There's two sides to the story. But sending my prayers to your loved onesüôè
1339684345859039232 2020-12-18 05:30:12 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech It would be nice if we could just open up. Unfortunately the economy is on the brink of collapse and there's only so much more time the govt can artificially prop it up. I think a lot of people would rather take the risk than end up homeless. And they should have that choice tbh.
1339670810219270145 2020-12-18 04:36:25 +0800 <jk1087> @atheism_cringe @mrm12mcgee That is not true.
1339404843530645504 2020-12-17 10:59:34 +0800 <jk1087> @mrm12mcgee Religious arguments always have one usually false premise, that is that the other individual holds the same religious code to be true. In an America in religious decline, that just doesn't work. 100% agree.

1338655570635542528 2020-12-15 09:22:13 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech I saw that was a thing. I didn't real person verify my account though because like you I have little trust in giving big tech that kind of information.
1338655082141732864 2020-12-15 09:20:17 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech After we relieve America of its evil political overlords, then we can openly debate where to go economically and socially. But as long as they hold power, we have nothing.
1338654898628427778 2020-12-15 09:19:33 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech I don't know either. I want them out because it truly undermines what our movement is meant to be about. When it comes to defeating establishment, the Trump camp and left camp can have some crossovers (IE 48 states suing Facebook).
1338653755496009728 2020-12-15 09:15:00 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech Parler I must say is completely free speech. And I have been engaged by many leftists on there. They SHOULD be on there. Not in a government / establishment controlled platform like Twitter wherein no views that compete w/ their narrative are allowed.
1338653198387564546 2020-12-15 09:12:48 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech And what's funny is, I don't hate you one bit. I respect anyone who takes time to rationalize their views rather than silencing or yelling. It's fine to have discussions, even if what you believe is completely antithetical to what I believe.
1338652712443908096 2020-12-15 09:10:52 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech And it's the same reason I follow you too. I dislike echo chambers so I try to fill my feed with competing views. But you see, when people become outcasts through social media censorship, they do join echo chambers and become MORE radicalized.
1338652321924800512 2020-12-15 09:09:19 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech It's not even the OLD DNC I care about. It's the NEW DNC who has radical sects like the DSA and Antifa. Most rational people can say "I love America, it provides more opportunities to more people than any other country", but they cannot say that. They HATE America
1338649900599320577 2020-12-15 08:59:41 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech To clarify 5, I mean I'm forced to write papers in school that completely counter what I believe or the truths I know. I cannot speak out against a professors narrative because the schools are 99% liberal and I will get a bad Grade.
1338647094907731968 2020-12-15 08:48:32 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech You ARE right in that we are in a battle against establishment who fights against us. We disagree on who will save us from that. That is really our only disagreement in that respect.
1338646428470497280 2020-12-15 08:45:54 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech And it's just getting started. Pretty soon, there will be hate speech laws, and conservative held truths will result in government prosecution. Or worse. That's why I fight no matter what.
1338646225998909443 2020-12-15 08:45:05 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech 3. I get censored by all major social media platforms at every chance possible, even for saying things objectively true.  4. If I defend myself against the mob, I will be charged, they will not.  5. I get views counter to my deepest held beliefs forced upon me in education
1338645795990458368 2020-12-15 08:43:23 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech Quick thread on what it's like to be conservative in America: 1. I can't go into any major cities and practice or preach my views without fear of being attacked by a mob 2. I have to try my best to hide my views on social media for fear of being fired by my employers
1338644848513961985 2020-12-15 08:39:37 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech I doubt you would be in on that considering how respectable you've been in our engagements, but there will be many.
1338644589545095170 2020-12-15 08:38:35 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech My hope is invested in American exceptionalism and American culture. I never will give that up. The liberals have been working for decades to assure they have all the systems in place to inevitably defeat us. If we give up, we will be prosecuted for how we think.

Which isn't much different in the scope of things when compared to a WiFi router. Anyway, that's my 2 cents. I do share your concern for the COVID vaccine. And personally won't be first in line for it :)

That is 99% of the 5G. Now there is 5G on mmWave. This is NEW. And understandably causes concern. However, no research that I can find shows any higher risk for cancer.

This holds true for other carriers as well...(1)

1327741936724152320 2020-11-15 06:35:20 +0800 <jk1087> Where were you when the greatest election fraud in our nation's history was taking place? Did you stand up in the face of adversity, or did you cower to the elite run media and narrative?
1327145033359822849 2020-11-13 15:03:27 +0800 <jk1087> It sucks when you get a roommate from California because they try to keep the room at 78¬∞. You're in Idaho now bro, we sleep at -32¬∞

1326652563794456576 2020-11-12 06:26:33 +0800 <jk1087> The amount of restraint it takes not to argue/debate on every single leftwing post is immeasurable
1325987037485297665 2020-11-10 10:22:00 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech Fair enough. It's just clear we'll never see each other's sides. But good discussion nonetheless. Wishing you the best üôå
1325985211973136385 2020-11-10 10:14:44 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech We could probably argue these numbers all night. Wanna settle it with a bet. I'll tweet one uplifting message (not supportive of policy but just wishing the best) to the Biden presidency if you're right. And if I'm right you do the same. You confident enough for that?
1325977477991202818 2020-11-10 09:44:00 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech anyway, remember me if I'm right. Remember me if I'm wrong. My twitter isn't going anywhere, so you'll have plenty of time to either gloat, or hang your head in my replies :)
1325976800908906497 2020-11-10 09:41:19 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech there is SOOOOO MUCH evidence and lawsuits, but the accounts and media you follow will NEVER report on it because they'd rather live in a world of confirmation bias wherein they've won the election. The so called "president elect" that the media called, without waiting.
1325976359491969024 2020-11-10 09:39:34 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech They are also bringing a suit of potentially 21,000 dead people who were counted on the voter role in PA. The Governor of Georgia is also promising to investigate the election their state.
1325976058668015617 2020-11-10 09:38:22 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech fraud.
1325975951105089536 2020-11-10 09:37:56 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech The SUPREME COURT literally handed down a ruling that says that votes cast after election day via postmarking MUST be separated for potential invalidation. They are being brought similar cases in other states. For example, republicans are suing in Nevada over mailin
1325974501998276608 2020-11-10 09:32:11 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech You and I know both know how the EC works.  There's only a few states that matter--and right now they are VERY tight.
1325974414630944768 2020-11-10 09:31:50 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech You just said ~40k votes, and then said that 10k fraudulent votes wouldn't change the election. You are contradicting yourself now. All it takes is 10k votes in a couple states to completely overturn the results of the election
1325972982938783744 2020-11-10 09:26:09 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech Then why would you even argue with me about this? I'm saying, there is right-wing media reporting on numerous instances of fraud, but you'd never trust the sources because of your own confirmation bias. Instead you'd rather trust the obvious leftist run MSM
1325972032199168000 2020-11-10 09:22:22 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech I do have evidence. I literally have in my possession pages of statistical analysis. The GOP has filed in courts with literal THOUSANDS of verifiable instances of fraud. YOU have confirmation bias because you don't want to believe there's a chance we are right.
1325971663591124993 2020-11-10 09:20:54 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech "credible sources" I should say
1325971564605571072 2020-11-10 09:20:31 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech Credible sources aren't going to publicize this information. But the courts will see it. And then they'll be forced to
1325971265140613120 2020-11-10 09:19:19 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech It's impossible to find sources you'd consider credible because it's being drowned out by the establishment run media / Big tech. The extreme wealthy and political elite cannot afford another Trump presidency-- especially one where he's unleashed from election pressure.
1325970199351226374 2020-11-10 09:15:05 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech &gt;Using wikipedia as a source
1325969789055983617 2020-11-10 09:13:27 +0800 <jk1087> @DingoTech Project Veritas is a great starting point. They have impeccable journalistic integrity. Unfortunately a lot of people are spreading misinformation and drowning out the true voter fraud. Investigations are taking place nationwide-- the truth will prevail.
1325968366507470850 2020-11-10 09:07:48 +0800 <jk1087> As far as I'm concerned, we already won the election.
1325604617640570880 2020-11-09 09:02:24 +0800 <jk1087> @RepMattGaetz thank you for standing up for the President and the 70 million+ Americans who voted for him.
1325586694108712961 2020-11-09 07:51:10 +0800 <jk1087> The left celebrates their "victory", but they're too stupid to see, we are going to win the real war: the culture war

1325278229008056322 2020-11-08 11:25:26 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 I'm okay with that! Understand that, but I think we are both intelligent enough to know that anecdotal evidence does not mean reality (that would be like saying I saw someone commit voter fraud as evidence of widespread voter fraud)
1325277575799697408 2020-11-08 11:22:51 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 Heavily disagree but it would take me hours to refute all of those here on Twitter because they are such broad statements / topics
1325276481317076997 2020-11-08 11:18:30 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 No. The true conservatives are paleoconservatives. Neocons have done a successful take over of the republican party.
1325275563599147008 2020-11-08 11:14:51 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 Everything you're saying here is unequivocally false or only supported by neocons. Not sure it's even worth engaging that.
1325274907509354496 2020-11-08 11:12:15 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 Lmao you lost me when you said restricting rights of people that are brown. Conservatives have long fought for equality under law for everyone. I think you got the wrong side of the aisle in mind. You name me one law or proposal in modern american history when we have done that
1325273780973793281 2020-11-08 11:07:46 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 What do you think we want that you're against?? Our party is a bunch of neocons so maybe I'll agree
1325272886974709760 2020-11-08 11:04:13 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 Each to their own. The beauty of America.
1325272844243103749 2020-11-08 11:04:03 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 Good luck. You're voting for a failing party, who's ideology has a false premise, and who's candidate clearly doesn't even understand the ideology. At least conservatives actually made some progress with limiting government (soon to be reversed, though).
1325271753367564289 2020-11-08 10:59:43 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 @sabotagebeats Government has to exist in some capacity. The very fundamental premise of your ideology, that humans are inherently good, is wrong.
1325270580417851392 2020-11-08 10:55:03 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 Unfortunately that's promise of a utopia. Government will always have to place some restrictions. That's why conservatism and liberalism are so much bigger because we debate what restrictions the government should make, not whether it should or not.
1325269553975185410 2020-11-08 10:50:58 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 I'm saying that's what always results from those systems, not that I want to do that.
1325268754909913088 2020-11-08 10:47:48 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 @sabotagebeats Communism provides the same false premise. The idea that everyone will just work for the common good. And when that fails, a leader gets appointed who promises to be good, and then tries to force you to be good :)
1325268011113017344 2020-11-08 10:44:50 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 @sabotagebeats Precisely. Libertarianism is just extreme liberalism, and like communism, it's beautiful and amazing in theory, but it relies on people being good, and is therefore is offering an inherently flawed utopia
1325266964181258240 2020-11-08 10:40:41 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 Lolberts on a high because they finally get some love from the left üòâ I mean, Libertarianism and liberalism are by definition the same so I guess it makes sense.
1325265306864951297 2020-11-08 10:34:06 +0800 <jk1087> @sabotagebeats @emj322 "first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they call you racist" but we're going to prove them all wrong üòâ
1325263948094959619 2020-11-08 10:28:42 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 Glad we can agree there. Everything Trump did to halt overseas conflicts is about to be reversed. More war coming soon.. to uh.. someone's doorstep 3000 miles away
1325263346233344002 2020-11-08 10:26:18 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 Good. We're going to need you. The destruction will be subtle and slow. And we will be distracted with another endless overseas conflict that's probably coming soon.
1325262405979435009 2020-11-08 10:22:34 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 I haven't been sleeping because I've been up mass calling and campaigning to make sure the few freedoms we have left (or at least the sense of them) aren't stripped away and that I don't end up in a gulag somewhere. 1A and 2A are both being threatened w/ this new admin.
1325260888555704320 2020-11-08 10:16:32 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 Is it really? Because right now you're spewing all your views on Twitter and other social networks, and no one is stopping you. You can consume anything you want in America (for now). You can homeschool in America (for now). You can read any book (for now)
1325259983982718976 2020-11-08 10:12:56 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 I never claimed to be a free thinker. I'm a rightwing paleoconservative nationalist. All I said is you're next on the list so I hope you wake up. I associate with a group because numbers are the only way we will destroy the corrupt political elite. Does not make me a follower.
1325257913795977218 2020-11-08 10:04:43 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 See:  https://t.co/c3lIWjB4Ak First they're going after Trump supporters, their jobs, their families, everything.  But free thinkers like yourself are not allowed to exist in their world either.
1325257201540243456 2020-11-08 10:01:53 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 Believe what you want. But you're still going to lose. I'm first on AOCs list, but you'll be second.
1325256758936264704 2020-11-08 10:00:08 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 There's a reason all the systems you (and I) hate have been going against Trump at every turn.
1325256458049515521 2020-11-08 09:58:56 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 I don't think you're politically stupid like I think a lot of people are. However, I think you fail to realize that Trump was the person trying to uproot a deep, corrupt political system. Everyone lost today, some just are too busy consuming the media to realize it.
1325255129264611328 2020-11-08 09:53:39 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 We'll see about that. Going to be a lot more worried about your next meal than feeling good inside. At least leftists can cope with welfare.
1325254634735239168 2020-11-08 09:51:41 +0800 <jk1087> @emj322 Here's to hoping libertarians have the warm fuzzy feeling of 'voting their conscience' when the bottom is falling out from the economy ü§û

1325153964241768449 2020-11-08 03:11:39 +0800 <jk1087> @BitcoinDood Donald Trump was our last hope in a long battle against the political elite and the establishment. But even he could not uproot it. Joe Biden feels like a return to "normal", but by normal I mean corruption and selling America away.
1325022327659143169 2020-11-07 18:28:35 +0800 <jk1087> To all the republican politicians who are silent right now, let it be very clear: we are coming for your seat
1325018921846501377 2020-11-07 18:15:03 +0800 <jk1087> Anyone denouncing Trump or Trumpism right now is on the wrong side of history.
1325017675962048520 2020-11-07 18:10:06 +0800 <jk1087> Nationalism will rise again. President Trump started a movement bigger than himself, and it cannot be stopped now. America wasn't ready for a Trump, but soon we will be.
1324886242824134656 2020-11-07 09:27:50 +0800 <jk1087> I take No 2 spot. Come get me, commies
1324876321952993280 2020-11-07 08:48:24 +0800 <jk1087> .@SenatorRisch affirm your support for investigating the Presidential elections. In a time when many GOP members are turning their back on the President, Idahoans want to know you are still on our side. We voted overwhelmingly for Trump.
1324811577095172096 2020-11-07 04:31:08 +0800 <jk1087> All Republicans who ARE still standing by the President right now: we see you, and we appreciate you. To the ones who aren't: you're a fraud

1322973777483853824 2020-11-02 02:48:22 +0800 <jk1087> @ibxtoycat True, with the outlawing of faithless electors in most states, this has become the situation. But I think it's very important to make the distinction. The lie that we are a democracy is what leads to catastrophe when a candidate wins EC but not popular vote.

1311915384061095939 2020-10-02 14:26:16 +0800 <jk1087> @FrogKrell @mixtancing @SnazzyQ That depends on your definition of baby. The problem with abortion arguments: if you can't agree on a common ground that a baby in the womb is a *life*, then there is no argument. We will never agree. It's pointless to even go back and forth unless you believe that.

That isn't right. If someone is truly a rapist, it's very amoral to accept money to be quiet. You're only enabling them further. But without evidence, we can't just go throwing accusations

Consent is key. If they're letting him do that, is it sexual assault or just an interaction between two consenting adults?

1311903478785114112 2020-10-02 13:38:57 +0800 <jk1087> @LambaLadka @SnazzyQ Donald Trump has never had a *single* sexual assault allegation against him validated, especially not in court. Instead it's been used as a political weapon to slander him ü§¶ which is gross
1311903213369651202 2020-10-02 13:37:54 +0800 <jk1087> @godisafroot @SnazzyQ True, but there are levels of severity to sin. And murder, especially of innocent helpless lives, definitely tops that list.
1311902862671183873 2020-10-02 13:36:31 +0800 <jk1087> @damnitralphy It has nothing to do with morals, it has to do with defending those who can't defend themselves. I certainly don't believe Trump has lead a completely moral lifestyle, but if he'll stop murder, I'll support him. That's all there is to it.
1311902374441746432 2020-10-02 13:34:34 +0800 <jk1087> @SnazzyQ When I watched you in the early years, and saw you were dropping your whole youtube career for two years to go on a mission, I admired you as a man of faith. That's hard to do now.

Models are just predictions based on some sort of computational algorithm. Algorithms can be skewed easily. If they are really concerned about it, why aren't we using nuclear power?
1308596302012321792 2020-09-23 10:37:25 +0800 <jk1087> @bonerparty4 We'll see what matters more in 7 years :)
1308595638968360960 2020-09-23 10:34:47 +0800 <jk1087> @bonerparty4 That sounds delectable, but too busy learning and building platforms for you to spread misinformation on. Y'know, shit that actually matters
1308591195396796416 2020-09-23 10:17:08 +0800 <jk1087> @bonerparty4 "the atom cannon be split"-some phd at some point. What a joke ü§£ cut the academia superiority complex
1308584743231864832 2020-09-23 09:51:29 +0800 <jk1087> @bonerparty4 Environ scientists only want to say what will get them more research money. Especially phds
1308584498427174912 2020-09-23 09:50:31 +0800 <jk1087> @bonerparty4 LOL of course you won't. echo chamber alert. What're you getting your degree in again? Because I'm dedicating the rest of my life to computer "not science" so propagandists can use them to make alarmist models like this. Give me a break üôÑ
1308580874250715136 2020-09-23 09:36:07 +0800 <jk1087> @bonerparty4 I can do better than that. I can show you the history of alarmist models being incorrect about climate change. But it's okay, Twitter will be around for 7 years. I'll be here to have a giggle at this "art". Having a PhD doesn't make you anymore right/wrong about anything.
1308574672154365953 2020-09-23 09:11:28 +0800 <jk1087> @bonerparty4 Damn this is lit! Now when the prediction is wrong again, like it has been the past ~10 times (because they won't stop using alarmist models), we will actually have evidence of how silly we sounded!

1305714709216153601 2020-09-15 11:47:00 +0800 <jk1087> @Ninnovation_ @Boogie2988 That's fair! I'm not trying to change your mind (I won't). Just providing a counter example I thought was interesting.
1305696639940657152 2020-09-15 10:35:12 +0800 <jk1087> @Ninnovation_ @Boogie2988 Doesn't work particularly well. I'm conservative so naturally I disagree w/ you but I just thought that was worth mentioning.
1305696443676504070 2020-09-15 10:34:25 +0800 <jk1087> @Ninnovation_ @Boogie2988 The problem with this is that it is incredibly inefficient. Valve runs a "flat" structure as you speak of, wherein there are no "bosses", and they continually fail to ship products/updates. That's not to say Valve is not an incredibly successful company, just that that structure
