1337056455841771526 2020-12-10 23:27:55 +0800 <TVinDall> @jsolomonReports Or maybe, @POTUS44 , we SAW what you did, HEARD your hateful rhetoric and realized you were just another wolf in sheep's clothing?? Maybe it's just me, but when you lie to get into office then start selling out the country, it kinda turns me off.
1337051528335667201 2020-12-10 23:08:20 +0800 <TVinDall> @grannyclear @JonathanTurley Glad you're confident. Based on what, though? Biden's 47 years in office not accomplishing anything except expanding his own wallet? Family getting paid? No, it must be his intelligent, well thought out speeches. Or  maybe...oh nvm. We both know you're just spewing talking points
1336822579852701697 2020-12-10 07:58:34 +0800 <TVinDall> @RepSwalwell @senatemajldr Uh huh. Sounds totally real ü§î. Doesn't want help from anyone. Just wants the Senate to turn over. Sure.
1336671221702930433 2020-12-09 21:57:08 +0800 <TVinDall> @GovernorTomWolf Just say it enough &amp; it may become true?
1336656676435451907 2020-12-09 20:59:20 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenSchumer If spreading disinformation and amplifying hatred &amp; violence were crimes, YOU and most of your party would already be jailed!!
1336652444730855426 2020-12-09 20:42:31 +0800 <TVinDall> @MaryCay26 @Hoosiers1986 @ReverendWarnock You're confusing spirituality with religion. God absolutely judges our choices according to the bible. You're free to be spiritual instead of religious, or not follow the bible if you choose, but you should know the difference.
1336651514820096000 2020-12-09 20:38:49 +0800 <TVinDall> @_no_bromo_ @McKaylaRoseJ @ReverendWarnock What century do YOU live in? In 2020, ALL those are ready available! And for free to those who can't afford it.
1336646878637789185 2020-12-09 20:20:24 +0800 <TVinDall> @Kactss @1catherinesiena @SocialistFern @KelemenCari @ReverendWarnock Abby, (who loves Christmas, which celebrates the birth of Christ), when my granddaughter was at that stage of life, they nicknamed her water bear (because that's what she looked like). They weren't foolish enough to believe that. It was just a cute name. ALL of life is precious.
1336307520261017600 2020-12-08 21:51:54 +0800 <TVinDall> @J_lem21 @RoniPhillips @Cernovich Constitution begs to differ: "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof" and "or abridging...the right of people to peaceably assemble". I take FREE EXERCISE of religion to mean where &amp; how I choose, NOT the gov. How exactly could you interpret that differently?
1335209654759075844 2020-12-05 21:09:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @AOC We don't want your socialism!! No matter how you try to dress it up, it's still socialism!! We want our country open. We are responsible adults, not your children.

1333515749688807430 2020-12-01 04:58:24 +0800 <TVinDall> @MrErnestOwens He wants a nice place for people to come eat a decent meal without the ghetto rats ruining it. I agree 100% with him. All decent people deserve decent places!
1333220948988850182 2020-11-30 09:26:58 +0800 <TVinDall> @mericalovestrex @BetteMidler I'm not sure you understand the meaning of spiritual.  Perhaps you meant evil?

Btw..we remember the "multiple accusations against Kavanaugh üòÇüòÇüòÇ but, hey, you keep on trying!!
1332045686997716996 2020-11-27 03:36:54 +0800 <TVinDall> @BeholdIsrael @SidneyPowell1 Part of it!

1331991600185176068 2020-11-27 00:01:59 +0800 <TVinDall> @GenFlynn @DaveSchreiber3 They tried, but, of course, they could not be allowed to succeed!

1331962594626732032 2020-11-26 22:06:43 +0800 <TVinDall> @RoniPhillips @Cernovich The Constitution is pretty clear on this. Nowhere does it say "except in the case of CCP plague"!!
1331962061509816321 2020-11-26 22:04:36 +0800 <TVinDall> @brhodes Illegitimate??  The fact that you disagree with the Constitution is your problem!

1331583604745494529 2020-11-25 21:00:45 +0800 <TVinDall> @Alyssa_Milano Kind of like how the Hillary supporters came with kindness &amp; humility 2016 and didn't try to tear this country apart for FOUR YEARS with riots, marches &amp; evil words??  Sure. We can do it that way.
1331257394358267909 2020-11-24 23:24:31 +0800 <TVinDall> @piersmorgan Or...free adults who can be responsible for themselves?
1331256814747398145 2020-11-24 23:22:12 +0800 <TVinDall> @MZHemingway They opened so many eyes with their hatred &amp; never ending resistance.  They also laid a plan for how to react to future dem administrations. I will follow their example.
1331255002111873027 2020-11-24 23:15:00 +0800 <TVinDall> @thehill NY got the leader they deserve
1331230663819845633 2020-11-24 21:38:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @gatewaypundit The fact that "shim" is in charge of "health" in PA is everything you need to know. Would you take medical advice from this person, regardless of gender? Looks like the unhealthiest she/him I've ever seen.
1331225586535178242 2020-11-24 21:18:07 +0800 <TVinDall> @JohnBrennan You lied &amp; fooled so many people. The ones paying attention see you for the ruthless criminal you are. YOU will be remembered in history also, and history will tell what you did/were. You are despicable!

1330911217687392256 2020-11-24 00:28:56 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden I have ZERO confidence you will do anything good for this country. You never have!! #ZeroConfidenceInJoe

1330497265782419460 2020-11-22 21:04:02 +0800 <TVinDall> @BetteMidler Idk...maybe if the violent thugs hadn't attacked him, this highly trained "child" wouldn't have been forced to defend himself. WE ALL SAW THE VIDEO!!

1329857362472161288 2020-11-21 02:41:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden Idk..maybe acknowledge the 99.4% of Americans who are NOT trans??
1329856601709301762 2020-11-21 02:38:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden I bet you have no clue how many people were shot in Chicago last week. Give you a hint...it's more than 37.
1329855915240149000 2020-11-21 02:35:32 +0800 <TVinDall> @kimKBaltimore Yes. Apparently many are!
1329855744968110086 2020-11-21 02:34:51 +0800 <TVinDall> @DrBiden The dem party chose him. Dems didn't want him. Now you just think we'll ALL magically forget how he was chosen? Um...no. just stop

1329775043388256258 2020-11-20 21:14:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeTalkShow @SidneyPowell1 Why isn't @TuckerCarlson show INVESTIGATING I stead of just criticizing others for not investigating???
1329774564906242049 2020-11-20 21:12:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @jessiprincey @iDaveHasQuesti1 You SHOULD be a "real journalist". God know we need some &amp; you appear to be doing the work! Good thread.
1329771464728469504 2020-11-20 20:59:57 +0800 <TVinDall> @MarcoMenage @C_C_Krebs Democrats lost the Presidency. Plain &amp; simple. They'll do ANYTHING for globalist power to return.
1329770669106737155 2020-11-20 20:56:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @greggutfeld How will the American people ever get answers if he doesn't take "journalists'" questions??  I have NO CLUE what flavor ice cream he prefers!!
1329770269490237440 2020-11-20 20:55:12 +0800 <TVinDall> @DailyCaller How will we EVER find out what flavor ice cream he prefers if he won't answer questions from "journalists"????
1329767959250821120 2020-11-20 20:46:02 +0800 <TVinDall> @BrandonStraka I also noticed his show didn't bother to pull up affidavits &amp; start investigating even though that was his criticism of other stations.
1329767669478912004 2020-11-20 20:44:52 +0800 <TVinDall> @BrandonStraka I ditched Fox EXCEPT Tucker. I thought that was weird also. I'm paying close attention to HOW he delivers. We'll see. Hopefully, Ms. Powell can produce real evidence in court.
1329765592606208001 2020-11-20 20:36:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @neylano @SeattlePD What if? Ok, I'll play. What if I decide YOU have too much $ and too many things? What if you worked for it for years? What if I destroyed it or took it because I didn't work as hard for as long? Fun game?
1329576414966845444 2020-11-20 08:04:54 +0800 <TVinDall> The more fraud is proven, the more lockdowns they'll institute.
1329576175602184193 2020-11-20 08:03:57 +0800 <TVinDall> They got caught red handed. Game over.
1329575470166384645 2020-11-20 08:01:09 +0800 <TVinDall> @MrAndyNgo Well, it's where antifa lives, so...
1329495639898677252 2020-11-20 02:43:56 +0800 <TVinDall> The left spent FOUR years saying 2016 election was rigged. Now? That's impossible. They claim Trump is a dictator, but THEY'RE the ones wanting to reprogram fellow citizens and blacklist opponents. They say Deplorables are racist as they define everything by race.  See a pattern?
1329494776010387457 2020-11-20 02:40:30 +0800 <TVinDall> @WajahatAli @nytimes The "heartland" that you claim supports Trump is literally all over the country. You claim they are all racist, then admit that Muslims support Trump also (but only because they want to be white)???  Wake up! Maybe, instead of everyone else being awful, its you??
1329489884256604161 2020-11-20 02:21:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @DavidOAtkins No seriously.  You don't.  I realize it's a dream for you facists, but this lunatic idea of "reprogramming" people so they agree with you is ludicrous! We will NEVER agree. Never have. We can compromise,  but it must be give &amp; take. Ya'll no longer get to just take!
1329480018964205572 2020-11-20 01:41:51 +0800 <TVinDall> @mlesemann @dominguez_raque @DavidOAtkins Lol..."lock them up"! Sounds very familiar!
1329478936615596034 2020-11-20 01:37:33 +0800 <TVinDall> @DavidOAtkins Just love how the left is so arrogant that they can't even fathom that they're wrong! The OTHER people need reprogramming,  not me, I'm correct! This is the problem with both extremes.
1329458766308384768 2020-11-20 00:17:24 +0800 <TVinDall> @LLinWood The swamp runs deep and they're ALL in it!
1329458234663563271 2020-11-20 00:15:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @OANN Her last SHOULD'VE been quite awhile ago. Hard to let go when you're milking so much from lobbyists &amp; taxpayers!
1329457489742598152 2020-11-20 00:12:20 +0800 <TVinDall> @JAKinator85 @DaskaMiltos @AOC You would think they'd be too dumb to get an ID &amp; figure out how to vote. That's probably why Republicans wanted to do away with voter ID and...wait, what??
1329455626242682880 2020-11-20 00:04:56 +0800 <TVinDall> @pkapauline1 @thehill Pssst... 46% IS NOT a majority!!
1329455436429398021 2020-11-20 00:04:10 +0800 <TVinDall> @thehill So, another way to say this would be "A MAJORITY OF VOTERS DO NOT THINK TRUMP SHOULD CONCEDE IMMEDIATELY ". See how they try to confuse their sheep?
1329441851858952207 2020-11-19 23:10:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @justme2andu @cross_gen @ChrisCuomo Well, not quite.  In 2016, media called it, HILLARY CHALLENGED, lost the challenge, THEN conceded.  Facts really do matter.  What the left NEVER realizes is that their dirty tricks ALWAYS end up being used against them! If this stands, we will NEVER have another clean election!!
1329440500202532870 2020-11-19 23:04:49 +0800 <TVinDall> @Judson4Congress @marcorubio The fact that almost half the country (and much of the world) believes there was election fraud &amp; the media isn't investigating, belies your statement.
1329439635337064452 2020-11-19 23:01:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @marcorubio Their Chinese masters are all that matter to them
1329413044007481345 2020-11-19 21:15:43 +0800 <TVinDall> @emacmahon @CoryBooker We've worn the mask. Why aren't the numbers going down? I would think the liberal "educated" people would be able to discern what works from what's useless.
1329412157109379075 2020-11-19 21:12:12 +0800 <TVinDall> @thesleepyscorp @CoriBush @AOC Government isn't here to change your life. That's YOUR responsibility!
1329411988435431429 2020-11-19 21:11:31 +0800 <TVinDall> @SeattleiteLeo @the1codemonkey @CoriBush Maybe they didn't get an overpriced education.  I bet, even with misspelling, that person pays for their own way &amp; takes care of their own family.
1329411427849953282 2020-11-19 21:09:18 +0800 <TVinDall> @WildFeyStar @CoriBush Idk..after reading your profile, maybe being a "poet" isn't right for you. Maybe you're better suited to being a laborer that could afford to live?? Stop with the nonsense &amp; your life would improve!
1329410807273316352 2020-11-19 21:06:50 +0800 <TVinDall> @CoriBush Tell this to the throngs in food lines in Dallas. I'm sure they would prefer money be spent on food instead of nonsensical degrees!
1329111195115196420 2020-11-19 01:16:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @LeslieMarshall And on 11/04 they used the ballot machines to attack us.
1329054173732728834 2020-11-18 21:29:42 +0800 <TVinDall> @RepAdamSchiff It appears he was part of the DS. He claimed the election was not fraudulent when we have proof it was. He was telling lies to power, not truth!
1328864261582565376 2020-11-18 08:55:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @mpukita They didn't miss anything. They were in on the plan!
1328858114871980033 2020-11-18 08:30:38 +0800 <TVinDall> @cross_gen @ChrisCuomo "There are no real legal challenges"?? You have no clue what legal challenges are on the table!!
1328697332662153219 2020-11-17 21:51:44 +0800 <TVinDall> @brianstelter You forgot MEDIA LIES!! That's really what produces the most anger.
1328517725141032965 2020-11-17 09:58:02 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenWarren Stop protecting the universities that are ripping EVERYONE off!  Responsible people (and governments) don't spend more than they can afford!!!
1328305634509549568 2020-11-16 19:55:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @FatLittleBird @RealEricCarmen @PressSec The state must tell you how to worship in order to protect you?? Are you insane? Any learned person can see this is NOT freedom as expressed in The Bill of Rights!!   Oh, but, you're a "professor", so we should listen to you?
1328303458764656642 2020-11-16 19:46:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @phqer @jsolomonReports Just admit that you have NO clue how government is supposed to work.

1326586885263777793 2020-11-12 02:05:34 +0800 <TVinDall> @SpeakerPelosi "Congress's intent"??? YOU said you didn't know what was in it &amp; that's why you had to pass it.

Then, we'll say conservatives are the extremist party, we'll claim to be the norm and can punish them???  Lol..maybe a CAMP where we CONCENTRATE on reeducation? You mean something like that?
1326104315644305409 2020-11-10 18:08:01 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen @realDonaldTrump It's been the plan all along. That's why they told people months ago that he wouldn't leave. If this gets reversed, since their people thinks it's a done deal, it will cause violence.
1325991111148646400 2020-11-10 10:38:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @valshower @ROSESRR97780071 @DailyCaller Um.."I never spoke to my son about his business".Lie.  "A drunk driver killed my family ". Lie.  "I don't know anything about the Russia investigation".Lie.  "Top of my class". Lie  ALL PROVEN. I could do this all day. If we cut him off when he lied, he couldn't say anything!!
1325989504772173824 2020-11-10 10:31:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @valshower @DailyCaller Written like someone who has zero ability to discern truth from lies. You maybe shouldn't be watching anything political!  I would prefer open reporting. I'll make up my own mind, thank you.
1325988940097183746 2020-11-10 10:29:33 +0800 <TVinDall> @DailyCaller Tucker's clout at Fox (especially now) is so much more than that sleazy Cavutto! That little dweeb will cost his network while Tucker may be the only one saving them!
1325978424561819648 2020-11-10 09:47:46 +0800 <TVinDall> @EvanAKilgore Just the opposite.
1325978079509012485 2020-11-10 09:46:24 +0800 <TVinDall> @King_Pair0 @LizRNC You're (maybe) right. With the dems in, we will ALL have to get used to losing as a country, right?
1325974845406982151 2020-11-10 09:33:33 +0800 <TVinDall> Bash Fox all you want (I do too except for Tucker), but watching Tucker's open tonight is while I'm still watching him! Thank you @TuckerCarlson !!
1325971451707600898 2020-11-10 09:20:04 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden The bottom line is if you trusted the election results you would welcome an investigation. It's the ONLY way 1/2 of the country will believe you're legit!
1325970764714094593 2020-11-10 09:17:20 +0800 <TVinDall> If Biden truly believed the election was fair, HE would support investigating it!!   https://t.co/w0xKNkzZ4q
1325968515128582145 2020-11-10 09:08:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @RrrbarryRoger @CBS_Herridge @senatemajldr @CBSNews Either way, after looking at Russia for 4+ years to the very end, we can afford a few months verifying this election was clean.
1325966222538792963 2020-11-10 08:59:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen I did, but I think your huge following broke it üòâ it won't load now
1325965644567875585 2020-11-10 08:56:59 +0800 <TVinDall> The liberals (who claim there's no such thing as election interference) are commenting how hypocritical this makes conservatives look. What say you?
1325965294284779520 2020-11-10 08:55:36 +0800 <TVinDall> @23Lori @TheDailyShow If you look at it a little more open minded, it's critical of both sides. Which side was calling foul that time? The left, who now claim it's not possible.
1325964386297634822 2020-11-10 08:51:59 +0800 <TVinDall> @ThoMz_AD @BahezTony @TheDailyShow See, this is interesting,  because we've been having the same conversations. We think those exact same things about the left. Seriously, I don't know how the 2 sides can ever see each other as likable.
1325962404065316865 2020-11-10 08:44:06 +0800 <TVinDall> @TheDailyShow I think people just need to understand that each side needs to make sure results are true. What's wrong with investigating? Both sides want that. Stop demonizing!!
1325959423475527680 2020-11-10 08:32:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen @ecarmen2 Looking for you right now. I really appreciate your voice!
1325958404242878470 2020-11-10 08:28:13 +0800 <TVinDall> @JackPosobiec @OANN Yes! Please make it easy for us to watch!

1325956924123320320 2020-11-10 08:22:20 +0800 <TVinDall> @Kevin_L_Johnson @jaketapper Be real. The only chance for violence is if Trump wins his suits. You know it. I know it. Ya'll probably have BLM on standby just in case. Btw..there is no President elect until the states certify. Just stop.
1325956040253460482 2020-11-10 08:18:49 +0800 <TVinDall> @jaketapper So much better if your resume contains links to all your riots, looting &amp; setting up bailout funds for same, huh? STOP THREATENING!! Didn't work pre-election &amp; won't work now!  You Nazis really better learn to control your authoritarian tendencies!

1325905330597982209 2020-11-10 04:57:19 +0800 <TVinDall> @rm_mnx @ConservaMomUSA @JoeBiden Lol..trying to insult a grandmother by calling me granny? üòÇüòÇ I'm NOT going to explain organized religion to you. Suffice it to say, people choose their own. We're talking about people claiming to be Catholic but going against their Church. The CHURCH dictates the rules.
1325872309681446915 2020-11-10 02:46:06 +0800 <TVinDall> Afraid he'll declassify &amp; we'll find out everything??
1325871885339533314 2020-11-10 02:44:25 +0800 <TVinDall> @jaketapper The more ya'll try to silence him, the more I believe he's onto something!
1325871566765305858 2020-11-10 02:43:09 +0800 <TVinDall> @piersmorgan We all know if Biden were in this situation, he (like Hillary) would be doing the same thing.   The more celebrities rush this process, the more I distrust the original calls!!
1325870799195164672 2020-11-10 02:40:06 +0800 <TVinDall> @Lrihendry We all knew. That's why she refused to recuse!
1325870058946654209 2020-11-10 02:37:10 +0800 <TVinDall> @stillgray We always knew the DS was doing this &amp; WE DIDN'T SPEAK OUT! It was always just a matter of time before they used it against us!
1325869082923724807 2020-11-10 02:33:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @Scaramucci @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Lol..in the spirit of unity, can we all agree that Comey, Michael Cohen &amp; this little man are hated by all of us? That's a start, right?

1325789943982137349 2020-11-09 21:18:49 +0800 <TVinDall> @jaketapper Sources have told me that CNN has zero actual sources &amp; are only trying to cover up. BTW, Jake, where's the COVID tracker on your network?? SUDDENLY we don't need to know those numbers??  We're not ALL braindead sheep!

1325779264382308352 2020-11-09 20:36:23 +0800 <TVinDall> Remember the day after 2016 election??   "I won't ever give up &amp; neither should you"!!    https://t.co/KJhWTyq3Ml

1325141638675574785 2020-11-08 02:22:41 +0800 <TVinDall> @ResitsTrump I was just going to ask. Riot, loot or burn tonight? Just need to know what to wear!
1325141147921084416 2020-11-08 02:20:44 +0800 <TVinDall> Why can't Biden supporters speak without being told what to say? Oh, wait.... commie, that's right!! I've blocked so many of these 100 follower accounts, my thumb is sore!!

1325134094255190016 2020-11-08 01:52:42 +0800 <TVinDall> @LionelMedia I've said system was corrupt for years &amp; no way would they allow him to shed light on it, so vindicated. Sad, but I think we knew 2016 was once in a lifetime when they blinked.
1325133571649122304 2020-11-08 01:50:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @P8R1OT I can confirm. My sources have been telling me that also. They also confirmed this election was a scam!

1325086078815047680 2020-11-07 22:41:54 +0800 <TVinDall> I voted: For a President who would look out for America, a President who would put country above all, against racism by the left, against China, against the riots &amp; killing, against antifa &amp; BLM!  I VOTED TRUMP!

1325072624637120524 2020-11-07 21:48:27 +0800 <TVinDall> @HurdOnTheHill After everything the left has done for 4 years (all the Russia lies, Schiff talking of "evidence in plain sight", phony impeachment) our only logical conclusion is that you didn't suddenly stop being asswipes overnight!!

We didn't believe Mueller, but NOBODY cried for him to stop! We wanted the answers for the country.  Scary that so many people are so willfully ignorant!
1324737905986850816 2020-11-06 23:38:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @SierraWhiskee @Justathoughtgu I support the President &amp; believe there are too many irregularities. Having said that, I know a few never Trumpers who voted that way. We can challenge this, but have to keep our heads before someone does something stupid.
1324725487441223681 2020-11-06 22:49:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @SaraCarterDC No. Literally no one believes it. Many applaud it, bit NOBODY thinks this is true!
1324725081281581057 2020-11-06 22:47:26 +0800 <TVinDall> If the dems pull this scam off, they would be wise to remember how sure they thought the nuclear option wouldn't backfire. Next election, EVERYONE will be cheating!!   Way to kill the Republic dems!

If you add in the late night votes coming in 100% one way &amp; lack of transparency, you get voters who don't trust the results. May be nothing,  but the dems have shown what they're willing to do. We don't trust them! Plus, we remember JFK!

1324680246965293056 2020-11-06 19:49:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump Nothing screams honest &amp; non biased more than a name like "resistor sister"!
1324674724811735041 2020-11-06 19:27:20 +0800 <TVinDall> @bennyjohnson It's like they're TRYING to destroy the country. But we've known that for 4 years. We just have to figure out what to do about it when half the country doesn't want to know the truth!!
1324672863237013504 2020-11-06 19:19:56 +0800 <TVinDall> @jakeh0ney @bennyjohnson I love seeing these brainless dem children repeating the same spoon fed lines because they can't think their own thoughts!  Funny thing is, I really believe they have nothing else in their lives!!
1324671294735077376 2020-11-06 19:13:42 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealCandaceO These comments are the most concerning.  When Mueller was investigating, we didn't buy it, but we let them try to prove it. THEY DIDN'T! These people üëáüëá don't even care if their party cheats.   If 1 party gets away with it, it's then the norm &amp; won't stop!!
1324668047223828487 2020-11-06 19:00:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @MetroStarXI @CBS_Herridge @NVGOP See, this is our biggest divide. Had there been evidence os Trump's wrongdoing in 2016, WE (I should really only speak for me, I guess), would've turned on him &amp; demanded he leave. There wasn't. With the dems, it appears ANY means justifies the end.
1324558668235460608 2020-11-06 11:46:10 +0800 <TVinDall> @jacobsoboroff @RichardGrenell See a REAL journalist...Catherine Herridge. She can give you some badly needed info!

1324557872164966400 2020-11-06 11:43:00 +0800 <TVinDall> @CBS_Herridge @NVGOP Thanks for doing your job! We the people value you!
1324557275571326976 2020-11-06 11:40:38 +0800 <TVinDall> @jacobsoboroff @RichardGrenell So he's supposed to lay out a court case before this corrupt media machine?? I don't think that's the right way to go!
1324556923358859264 2020-11-06 11:39:14 +0800 <TVinDall> @charliekirk11 Good grief! Let him rest please.

1324550394589126657 2020-11-06 11:13:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @kathrynw5 No, you all did that! Remember,  the past 4 years? POTUS is RESTORING it!
1324550061322346498 2020-11-06 11:11:58 +0800 <TVinDall> @MrMichaelBurkes I still support him!

1324549029448028160 2020-11-06 11:07:52 +0800 <TVinDall> @BillOReilly How would all these Biden supporters know there is no proof of election fraud? Ya'll will close your eyes to anything that gets rid of Trump!
1324548314331811842 2020-11-06 11:05:01 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenatorLorettaW Lawful?? You're simply not paying attention!
1324547370722492419 2020-11-06 11:01:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @DavidSchatanoff @JoeBiden @MikeBloomberg Lol..guess you didn't hear about the results he got ya'll in Florida!!
1324546895658835976 2020-11-06 10:59:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @Frsty_RoyalMT @aidan_poirier @JoeBiden Works for both sides! Not my President! Now, we'll riot &amp; loot for 4 years! But, we all know normal people don't pull that crap like you people did.
1324546334507081728 2020-11-06 10:57:09 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden You said election fraud last time. I think you were correct then.
1324545804766502914 2020-11-06 10:55:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @AF632 @KeithOlbermann And the win, apparently
1324545446057025537 2020-11-06 10:53:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @KeithOlbermann Hmm..been reading scripted war games again? Real life doesn't work like that you old fool!
1324524216595763200 2020-11-06 09:29:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @LisaMarieBoothe The Russians could maybe take lessons from the dems on creating distrust/chaos!
1324503334292721665 2020-11-06 08:06:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @Acosta How do you know? How would you know if these are legit votes? Seriously!
1324498220932861953 2020-11-06 07:45:58 +0800 <TVinDall> @NikkiHaley @realDonaldTrump The "TRUTH" is so far from what's happening here!!
1324495227919437825 2020-11-06 07:34:04 +0800 <TVinDall> @LauraTripp57 @Acosta Joe. The "Catholic" who wants government to pay for abortion?? Oh stop!!

1324494023273385988 2020-11-06 07:29:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden Legal. You again forgot to say LEGAL vote!!
1324486553771610112 2020-11-06 06:59:36 +0800 <TVinDall> @tedcruz They won't let this stand. You need to be helping POTUS!!
1324481726102515714 2020-11-06 06:40:25 +0800 <TVinDall> @JackPosobiec @DonaldJTrumpJr Easy enough to check. I wonder how many times William Bradley checked his status. I did it (on all the ones he posted) and shared with everyone I knew.
1324480924910784512 2020-11-06 06:37:14 +0800 <TVinDall> @KimStrassel It will only last as long as the election does. Anyone who trusts any politician is a fool!
1324475509422645253 2020-11-06 06:15:43 +0800 <TVinDall> @Godwins1234 They HAD to. Otherwise, Trump landslide!
1324474727512068096 2020-11-06 06:12:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @BrodieMedders @JackPosobiec So true

1324462538118094848 2020-11-06 05:24:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @JackPosobiec @LindseyGrahamSC Maybe they promised him he could keep his seat if he kept quiet.

1324432827757318146 2020-11-06 03:26:07 +0800 <TVinDall> @Acosta OMG!! This is the worst thing ever! Thanks for your hard hitting reporting!!
1324432475507052546 2020-11-06 03:24:43 +0800 <TVinDall> @dbongino Wait, so the crazy eyed person Andy Ngo posted about was a Nadler employee? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Nobody would believe this crap (until 2020 that is)!

1324358976637706245 2020-11-05 22:32:40 +0800 <TVinDall> @marthamaccallum I've always watched &amp; enjoyed you.  I turned over to CNN on election night. CNN! Except for Tucker, Fox will not be on in my home anymore!
1324356467173064709 2020-11-05 22:22:41 +0800 <TVinDall> This is actually the first time I've heard a Democrat admit Hillary lost! But, sure, the right are whining like babies!
1324354513969549312 2020-11-05 22:14:56 +0800 <TVinDall> @pad_illa @moodyredhead @AndyVonasch So, basically, you're stuck on your opinion &amp; not open to changing it for any reason.
1324350164312694784 2020-11-05 21:57:39 +0800 <TVinDall> @MaliBoyAbdi @DineshDSouza I LOVE seeing dems a repeat the same phrase. But, really, we all know ya'll couldn't come up with an original thought &amp; have to be spoon fed remarks.
1324343675971948547 2020-11-05 21:31:52 +0800 <TVinDall> @kirstiealley The oldest living America on election day was 115. Look up on Michigan state website to check status of the following voters:  William Bradley B: March 1902 Zip: 48207  June Aiken B: Aug 1900 Zip: 49201  Donna Brydges B: Jan, 1901 Zip: 49431  https://t.co/OfrvsvnKly
1324342531941928962 2020-11-05 21:27:19 +0800 <TVinDall> Someone needs to tell the dems how easy it is to verify these things! We can easily look up the dead votes they cast!!  https://t.co/5kWCfqKkA8
1324339603785064450 2020-11-05 21:15:41 +0800 <TVinDall> @mikeyunderstars @fleccas Look it up on the website,  genius.
1324334130784542720 2020-11-05 20:53:56 +0800 <TVinDall> Enter this info on MI website. I did &amp; it says this 118 year old has voted?!? @Project_Veritas @RudyGiuliani  I guess when they said count EVERY vote, they meant it!!
1324323666327490561 2020-11-05 20:12:21 +0800 <TVinDall> @laurenboebert Congrats! Now speak out for POTUS!
1324301634957119491 2020-11-05 18:44:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @RICKISAPATRIOT @silver_fox9 If the dems get away with this, what on earth makes them think these methods won't be used against them in future elections? Reminds me of 1930s mob/union political corruption, only now it's national!!
1324293795379351553 2020-11-05 18:13:39 +0800 <TVinDall> @BretBaier Not when you cheated on us (just like all the others have)! We all know, ONCE A CHEATER, ALWAYS A CHEATER! We're looking for a dependable station that will respect us. Many of us have been looking for a backup for awhile now.
1324292082878582785 2020-11-05 18:06:51 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealJamesWoods Don't forget "Trump won't leave office", so if he wins the lawsuits, they delegitimize him &amp; SCOTUS in one fell swoop!
1324196868654534657 2020-11-05 11:48:30 +0800 <TVinDall> This is shady as hell!
1324188119529390080 2020-11-05 11:13:44 +0800 <TVinDall> @BuzzPatterson You ran a good campaign.  It's scary that CA is so corrupt!!
1324182385076899841 2020-11-05 10:50:57 +0800 <TVinDall> @RedWingGrips Gaetz finally tweeted for him
1324172754120282113 2020-11-05 10:12:41 +0800 <TVinDall> @Unsilent17 @BuzzPatterson And why do they think (just like the nuclear option), it won't come back to bite them?!? These people never learn. If he steals this, it will be the end of election integrity on this country!
1324170219355623424 2020-11-05 10:02:36 +0800 <TVinDall> @sallyeastman1 @tlcseaside Between Clinton &amp; Trump in 2016, there were 2,690,667 votes cast in MN.  Even in 2012, they didn't get to 3 million.  But we're supposed to believe these number now??   THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO MAKE IT BELIEVABLE!!!  https://t.co/uPGZbYCrZr

1324161127450877954 2020-11-05 09:26:29 +0800 <TVinDall> @GOPLeader SEVEN House seats flipped and the corrupt dems want us to believe a man who didn't come out of his basement until the very end got more votes than Obama???  I'm calling major BS!
1324153683920199680 2020-11-05 08:56:54 +0800 <TVinDall> @newsmax They didn't think Americans were smart enough to see right through this? NOBODY believes this. Not even Democrats!
1324118748928839687 2020-11-05 06:38:05 +0800 <TVinDall> @RubinReport I don't believe a thing they say and I'm very confident the socialists will do ANYTHING to get rid of Trump!
1324114987678420994 2020-11-05 06:23:08 +0800 <TVinDall> @megynkelly This person has shown her homophobic &amp; racist positions for years and the ignorant keep watching her.
1324112222805651457 2020-11-05 06:12:09 +0800 <TVinDall> @BretBaier Such a disappointment to see Fox following MSM in misleading the public! Will be tuning out all Foc except Tucker.
1324110880745861122 2020-11-05 06:06:49 +0800 <TVinDall> @JRubinBlogger Lol. This from the "not my President idiot"?? Don't think so!

1323839084024991744 2020-11-04 12:06:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @jimmykimmel The left needs to face the fact that they're out of touch with Americans.

1322181838832631809 2020-10-30 22:21:29 +0800 <TVinDall> @NBCNews üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ oh, fake news!! Now tell us the story about the dossier that you followed for 4 years!!
1322181135737171969 2020-10-30 22:18:42 +0800 <TVinDall> @NBCNews Right on cue! The laptop info has been verified by the Senate. Afraid the sheeple will see the truth?
1322180172989243392 2020-10-30 22:14:52 +0800 <TVinDall> @rachs80 @JasonMillerinDC But, no interest in crimes by Biden? Your hypocrisy is showing.
1322179644133679104 2020-10-30 22:12:46 +0800 <TVinDall> @MrAndyNgo üòÇüòÇüòÇ lovely young woMEN!!
1322178838995099649 2020-10-30 22:09:34 +0800 <TVinDall> @SunshineDaidrmr @AOC Lol..one was sold in USA, the other in Mexico. One is born in USA, the other is an ACTUAL immigrant. One auditioned to run through a contest by a socialist group &amp; has ZERO knowledge, the other is a wife of the President.   But, yeah, WE'RE the racists. Uh huh.
1322176596913098752 2020-10-30 22:00:40 +0800 <TVinDall> @tsickles321 @adamhousley @s_logar I thought the same thing. Poor old guy doesn't even know they're probably going to sacrifice him!
1322166408952844289 2020-10-30 21:20:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @BrettFavre @realDonaldTrump Thank you for supporting Americans!!
1322155402302279680 2020-10-30 20:36:27 +0800 <TVinDall> @Jim_Jordan @TenaMTaylor1 Intelligent people see what's happening. The "heads in the sand" group refuses to look at the truth.   Hopefully, someone is strong enough to stand up to China. It's NOT Twitter, FB, the media or dems!
1322153777449807874 2020-10-30 20:29:59 +0800 <TVinDall> @GladysAyes @Jim_Jordan Pssst... your hypocrisy is showing! You need an argument that doesn't start where your precious Obama built cages, placed kids in them, then LITERALLY made a video taped interview where he justified it! There are videos! Are you that ignorant or do you think others are?
1322152849879539712 2020-10-30 20:26:18 +0800 <TVinDall> @DonaldJTrumpJr @fedagentmark But but NBC said a completely separate document is fake, so surely ALL of them are! These people literally do not care! They don't want to hear that Joe was selling America to China.
1322151007946706944 2020-10-30 20:18:59 +0800 <TVinDall> @unclelukereal1 Does this mean you're worried about the Chinese money drying up? Yes, if Trump wins, I'm afraid it will!!
1321971262915268613 2020-10-30 08:24:44 +0800 <TVinDall> @midwest_left Apologies then....I appreciate the parody accounts, but these days, it's hard to tell with so many ridiculous things being said.
1321970723221549057 2020-10-30 08:22:36 +0800 <TVinDall> Twitter deemed this tweet hate??
1321969750747029506 2020-10-30 08:18:44 +0800 <TVinDall> Since Twitter doesn't want you to hear him, I'll help share!
1321931303021891586 2020-10-30 05:45:57 +0800 <TVinDall> @davidfrum We the people are starving for a media willing to tell the truth. We will listen to and read varying opinions as long as they TELL THE TRUTH &amp; THE WHOLE STORY. I don't agree with all of them, but they are honest &amp; fair!
1321929178170753025 2020-10-30 05:37:30 +0800 <TVinDall> This is gold!

1321917376233951233 2020-10-30 04:50:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @ggreenwald Would love to hear why you think this is happening. From my perspective it appears China has purchased our media, politicians &amp; way too many government workers. Or are they just holding it (the story) hoping Biden wins then they use this to get rid of him?
1321909168563998725 2020-10-30 04:18:00 +0800 <TVinDall> @Acosta He's right. You're NOT free. I suppose you cost China a lot!
1321839960870309889 2020-10-29 23:42:59 +0800 <TVinDall> @IAmSophiaNelson -Middle east peace -Economic strength -Ending the industrial military complex  But, go ahead sheeple, continue to underestimate the intelligence of Trump supporters! Call us names &amp; bully us. That's worked sooo well for you in changing minds, right?
1321809528892071938 2020-10-29 21:42:04 +0800 <TVinDall> His party's candidate for president is accused of selling out to China &amp; this is what Schumer tweets. Amazing! #BidenCrimeFamiily #Bobulinski #MediaBlackout #BidenCorruption
1321809021788192769 2020-10-29 21:40:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenSchumer Why would or should he? That is the responsibility of the states! YOUR constituents don't understand, but the rest of us can read &amp; comprehend!
1321807370251653121 2020-10-29 21:33:29 +0800 <TVinDall> @DeAngelisCorey @ScottAdamsSays Explains so much.
1321806980047163392 2020-10-29 21:31:56 +0800 <TVinDall> Yes he does!
1321805359204487169 2020-10-29 21:25:30 +0800 <TVinDall> @TheRickWilson Trying to distract again??  https://t.co/B301G9dYpx
1321802874784043009 2020-10-29 21:15:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @amyklobuchar @maddow Weird that you're not talking about #BidenCrimeFamiily after 4+ years of fake Russia stories!! We the people are not that stupid!!
1321785502547255296 2020-10-29 20:06:36 +0800 <TVinDall> Dahmer, Manson &amp; Bundy ALL had mental issues and ALL were killers. CNN wants you to believe that mental illness means someone isn't dangerous.
1321784170285309953 2020-10-29 20:01:18 +0800 <TVinDall> @CNN Many many killers have mental health issues. I guess Manson should've been in treatment instead of prison?
1321783683255336965 2020-10-29 19:59:22 +0800 <TVinDall> @IWashington It's too late for California. The $ controls all. Just like the corruption in Illinois &amp; NY. Arizona could still be saved!
1321781197136158722 2020-10-29 19:49:29 +0800 <TVinDall> @nathanTbernard So glad to see a "free speech activist" applaud actual free speech üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1321780560679870465 2020-10-29 19:46:57 +0800 <TVinDall> @RepJeffries Stolen?!? As a member of Congress, you must surely have seen the Constitution someplace? Is it a comprehension problem? Or just normal dem LIES????
1321777344655335424 2020-10-29 19:34:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @ClosetRight5891 @TBoneKindaGuy @DokHoliday7 @RubinReport So true. There are literally Project Veritas videos of Texans buying votes. It IS happening. They just won't report it.
1321775022294343680 2020-10-29 19:24:57 +0800 <TVinDall> @InfidelAngela @Truthseeker126 They are one &amp; the same

1321631691488845824 2020-10-29 09:55:24 +0800 <TVinDall> @girlscouts Setting an example of caving to political pressure is NOT an example that makes women strong. Standing up for ALL women is!

1321626789031120897 2020-10-29 09:35:55 +0800 <TVinDall> @DrBiden Decency would require Joe to tell the truth. But that would cut off the money, wouldn't it? #Bobulinski
1321626065861812224 2020-10-29 09:33:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @ChatChristi Good idea! 2 can play this game!
1321621912968175618 2020-10-29 09:16:33 +0800 <TVinDall> @KamalaHarris Yeah baby! Trump/Pence. Because I heard what #TonyBobulinsky said about your boy's crimes!!
1321619190667714563 2020-10-29 09:05:44 +0800 <TVinDall> @TravisAllen02 As a gun owner, who has been to lots of gun stores, I call TOTAL BS! Most are LE &amp; LE would NEVER vote Biden. Are you sure those aren't some of the voted dems bought? #bobulinsky
1321614341741944832 2020-10-29 08:46:28 +0800 <TVinDall> @HillaryClinton We can't afford more selling this country to China! #Bobulinski
1321613521654894600 2020-10-29 08:43:12 +0800 <TVinDall> @benshapiro The fact that so many people commenting (in what they think are intelligent sentences) that this is Russian disinformation, when the Senate confirmed the validity of ALL of #Bobulinski documentation shows how the media is keeping the left stupid!!
1321612931470184448 2020-10-29 08:40:51 +0800 <TVinDall> @Political_spoon @benshapiro The Senate just today confirmed all evidence. TODAY.  Open your eyes.
1321612523364339712 2020-10-29 08:39:14 +0800 <TVinDall> @laurenthamelekh @benshapiro Fox had an hourlong interview with the whistleblower. The Senate has confirmed ALL his corroboration is valid. You might know this if you had a valid press. You don't, so you stay ignorant.
1321611988775174144 2020-10-29 08:37:07 +0800 <TVinDall> @Darktionary @benshapiro @tedcruz So, you approve censorship? Got it!

1321598920485724160 2020-10-29 07:45:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @TedBaxter4trump @HeerJeet No
1321598633658167296 2020-10-29 07:44:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @HeerJeet Well said! It's the one statement we probably all agree with!

1321585736370585603 2020-10-29 06:52:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @KamalaHarris A future where the Big Guy isn't skimming money off the top from family deals with China? #BidenCorruption  #Bobulinski

1321582080342532098 2020-10-29 06:38:16 +0800 <TVinDall> @MilesTaylorUSA You've WAY overestimated the power of your opinion!! We didn't vote for you to look after us. Your 15 min are up. Go away!
1321580531147022344 2020-10-29 06:32:07 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen Twitter playing games so I didn't see it. Be safe!

1321569127954305030 2020-10-29 05:46:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @NickAdamsinUSA Pathetic
1321568115411603461 2020-10-29 05:42:46 +0800 <TVinDall> @FourstarPatriot @DennisAndSpace When I read "and still they loot", I assumed she was calling the people who loot "they". Not all black people. But, that's just me.
1321564790783987713 2020-10-29 05:29:34 +0800 <TVinDall> @LaraPatriot @TrumpRulzz @BIZPACReview Makes total sense that his son is such a perv, doesn't it?

1321560041443512321 2020-10-29 05:10:41 +0800 <TVinDall> @OMAROSA The bigger riddle is why on earth YOU have 140k followers!! Who cares what you think of anything?!?
1321559314709008385 2020-10-29 05:07:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @DC_Draino Waited 3 1/2 hours in the suburbs to vote Trump! I don't want to hear another peep about voter suppression!!
1321491010057314305 2020-10-29 00:36:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @EvanAKilgore Yes. He has no reason to lie
1321444449948491776 2020-10-28 21:31:22 +0800 <TVinDall> @14806b @JoeBiden Then tell the dems to stop creating drama for political reasons! Simple, really.

1321440896626446348 2020-10-28 21:17:15 +0800 <TVinDall> @JosephJFlynn1 100% agree! Plausible deniability has gone out the window with eye witness and a laptop FULL of evidence!!

1321218568994856962 2020-10-28 06:33:48 +0800 <TVinDall> @ElPrem1 @charliekirk11 Just admit that you're so brainwashed that it doesn't matter to you that your candidate is on the take! Would make you look a little less ignorant.
1321105766808457218 2020-10-27 23:05:34 +0800 <TVinDall> @Sensiablue @SenMarkey I just love when stupid people trying to sound smart out themselves with stupid remarks like this üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1321102524401750016 2020-10-27 22:52:41 +0800 <TVinDall> @GlennKesslerWP @daveweigel So, forgetting Trump's name &amp; repeating Lopez's is better?? Oh, dems üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
1321090882830032896 2020-10-27 22:06:25 +0800 <TVinDall> This country really needs to address our mental health issues! With treatment, these people might be normal productive citizens.
1321061266371366917 2020-10-27 20:08:44 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenFeinstein Maybe if legislators passed constitutional laws, you wouldn't need SCOTUS? This judge will follow the constitution!!
1321060568049065986 2020-10-27 20:05:58 +0800 <TVinDall> @LanaLkhoover @MarkEvans82 @SenFeinstein So, because YOU don't like the electoral college and the POTUS (because 1 person you hate was elected) the entire system must change??  You look a little old to spout such childishness. Maybe try electing REAL legislators!!
1320901915409088514 2020-10-27 09:35:32 +0800 <TVinDall> @EvanAKilgore And THAT'S what the dems fear!
1320901662278639616 2020-10-27 09:34:32 +0800 <TVinDall> @BillKristol Your opinion is now 100% irrelevant.  Nobody cares what you say or how many times you say it.
1320901419868786690 2020-10-27 09:33:34 +0800 <TVinDall> @JenInOveralls @BillKristol Little over the top. You need to stop with the drama. Nobody is coming for you. Nobody but the dems have threatened to go after the other side.  Get a little exercise &amp; fresh air &amp; TURN OFF CABLE NEWS! They've made you crazy!!
1320899586593034241 2020-10-27 09:26:17 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson So true. We're also the ones fighting racism as well as cronyism in government.  We're the ones who distrust the government &amp; want them out of our lives! Feels like a movement!
1320898736265060358 2020-10-27 09:22:54 +0800 <TVinDall> @TomFitton @Twitter Doesn't even matter anymore. Everyone knows Twitter warnings are just a sign of conservatism.

1320896903333224455 2020-10-27 09:15:37 +0800 <TVinDall> Oh, the comments üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1320895823169884164 2020-10-27 09:11:19 +0800 <TVinDall> @Acosta Well, in all fairness, she HASN'T been locked up for her crimes. But now, the #BidenCrimeFamilly is giving her serious competition!
1320895034607177729 2020-10-27 09:08:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @AOC Why don't dem legislators just do their job &amp; write constitutional laws? I know YOU don't understand the constitution, but surely one of the dem dinosaurs (Nancy, Chuck, et al) could explain it to you.

1320410081859653638 2020-10-26 01:01:10 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden YOU can't even campaign!! We know Kamala will be running things &amp; NOBODY wants her! Btw, Big Guy, how much did you get?
1320404241542975489 2020-10-26 00:37:57 +0800 <TVinDall> I'm a really small account. Had 1558 followers this am. Down to 1050 now?!? Can anyone still see me?

1320389063417933828 2020-10-25 23:37:39 +0800 <TVinDall> @brhodes We don't need to imagine. The blue rat infested cities would keep their constituents ignorant (like now) to keep power away from the rest of us. NO THANKS!!
1320383293100089348 2020-10-25 23:14:43 +0800 <TVinDall> @PeterVroom1 So doxing nuns is a Democrat thing now?? Wow, you people will sink really low to distract from #BidenCrimeFamilyExposed !!!
1320190125117157376 2020-10-25 10:27:08 +0800 <TVinDall> @LaVallePeter @subschneider @Laurie_Garrett I worked at fed agency 10 years after selling my business so I could retire early &amp; keep the gov insurance. I don't think it's a good policy, but since it was there, I took advantage of it. Retired 10 years to the day! It's ridiculous!
1320189444281012230 2020-10-25 10:24:26 +0800 <TVinDall> @Laurie_Garrett I'm thinking you didn't expect these responses. As usual, the left is out of touch with what real Americans want! We don't want a fat bloated government supporting worthless beaurocrats!!
1320186277610795008 2020-10-25 10:11:51 +0800 <TVinDall> @Lrihendry He &amp; Kamala have been threatening us for months.
1320185264246063106 2020-10-25 10:07:49 +0800 <TVinDall> THIS is how dumb dems think their voters are. "We'll just put out a pamphlet to TELL them who to vote for"!!

1319635618570375170 2020-10-23 21:43:43 +0800 <TVinDall> Did the msm forget we're in an age where video exists? The hypocrisy of denying BLM chanted this are so blatant!
1319632971826106373 2020-10-23 21:33:12 +0800 <TVinDall> @AOC BS! I've heard how Talib referred to him as "MFer" when she vowed to impeach him, I've seen you call him "Trump", I've heard Waters repeatedly call him "45" because she won't say his name and, you ALL have called him "the current occupant of the WH".  STOP LYING!!
1319629876371066889 2020-10-23 21:20:54 +0800 <TVinDall> @CBS_Herridge @emboyd Could you maybe pass some of this info to Leslie Stahl @60Minutes ?? She didn't seem to understand.
1319628426668539908 2020-10-23 21:15:09 +0800 <TVinDall> @Alyssa_Milano Yes! I HOPE Biden's corruption will see the light of day and I LOVE that POTUS confronted him on it!

1319444703960551424 2020-10-23 09:05:06 +0800 <TVinDall> @sbg1 Sorry, I was reading about our former VP following Hillary's footsteps in his pay to play scheme. But you go ahead &amp; worry about a 2 fisted drink if you want.
1319443767200538624 2020-10-23 09:01:22 +0800 <TVinDall> @JoeBiden Hey, Big Guy, I think you've taken enough!
1319443155515805696 2020-10-23 08:58:57 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen We can't ever believe them. We've known for awhile now. The question is, who will stand with POTUS and stand UP for the American people?

1319382732477239302 2020-10-23 04:58:51 +0800 <TVinDall> @jaketapper I saw an activist trying to protect Biden instead of probing &amp; investigating a story. I saw her not accept his answers because they didn't fit her agenda. Just another old relic from the past trying to represent the new "hip" dem party, as is @jaketapper !!
1319381605614555138 2020-10-23 04:54:22 +0800 <TVinDall> This üëáüëáüëá @60Minutes is a reporter. She digs &amp; investigates and THEN releases her story. I know it's hard for ya'll to imagine, but you should maybe try it!!   https://t.co/6Yds11ebNo

So, "we the people" are supposed to have cared endlessly about Trump/Russia &amp; now suddenly don't care?   The chaos &amp; dishonesty you speak of ALL, EVERY BIT OF IT, was from dems!!   No, WE care deeply about seeing this to the end!!!
1319256907052437505 2020-10-22 20:38:51 +0800 <TVinDall> @NYDailyNews @PennGSE So we need to normalize masturbation because a perv did it on a zoom call?? I don't think we're "repressed". I think MOST know there's a time &amp; place for things. This was NOT the time or place!!
1318555565065445380 2020-10-20 22:11:58 +0800 <TVinDall> @CNN So, NOW the source matters? Funny that didn't seem to be the case with the dossier! Why so afraid Clapper?
1318554796698292225 2020-10-20 22:08:55 +0800 <TVinDall> @PeteButtigieg American "citizens"? Or just people who live in America? Big difference!

1318532168621096960 2020-10-20 20:39:00 +0800 <TVinDall> @kirstiealley @realDonaldTrump So many idiots comparing politician to doctor, chef, etc. Do these people realize politicians aren't TRAINED??? DJT is as qualified as any other person to be President.

1316535788407083010 2020-10-15 08:26:06 +0800 <TVinDall> The fact that FBI had Hunter's computer for a year &amp; NOTHING was ever done tells us everything about deep state!!

1315701784694992897 2020-10-13 01:12:04 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen @P8R1OT It really has zero to do with religion. They're using that, but it's really because she believes in the constitution. Attacking Christians is just one way they're trying to destroy this country.
1315699886680158209 2020-10-13 01:04:32 +0800 <TVinDall> @OhJoSo @KamalaHarris @amyklobuchar @words_are_sheep Oh, I have! And told them to confirm ACB immediately!!
1315698020701405185 2020-10-13 00:57:07 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenSanders The people have spoken! We voted for POTUS for this very reason!
1315697342415343616 2020-10-13 00:54:25 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealEricCarmen It's because they ARE handmaids for the dems. They're told what to do &amp; they do it. Only idiot libs think this message will change minds.
1315696020613988358 2020-10-13 00:49:10 +0800 <TVinDall> @proxcee @DC_Draino @w2spw2_23 Hmmm...so you're saying that the police who shot black men for similar aggressions were justified?
1315694489760141312 2020-10-13 00:43:05 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenJeffMerkley So, your opinion is that it's only a non-biased court if liberals control it? Weird way to frame it, but if the sheeple believe you, go for it!
1315693164431323136 2020-10-13 00:37:49 +0800 <TVinDall> @amyklobuchar It IS ours! That's why we voted for Trump th o fill the seats!
1314962495577227264 2020-10-11 00:14:24 +0800 <TVinDall> @AndrewCMcCarthy @RichLowry 100% disagree! Media not talking about it, but people on the right care deeply!!
1314961182340665344 2020-10-11 00:09:11 +0800 <TVinDall> @CNN @JulieReichwein1 @CNNOpinion Umm..I dems keep telling me he's a war criminal. I would think that endorsement would put off Biden's base.
1314919708320305152 2020-10-10 21:24:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @DavidJHarrisJr I agree that is their plan. The question is, WHERE are the strong Republican leaders to counter this?!? They are all hiding &amp; have no plan.  Conservatives deserve leaders who will help POTUS fight!!
1314914986498699265 2020-10-10 21:05:37 +0800 <TVinDall> @Patrici15767099 I've always thought that was weird. If my candidate is down, I'm working HARDER to get support up. I really think it will be 2016 again.
1314901358315741184 2020-10-10 20:11:28 +0800 <TVinDall> @SenFeinstein That's actually a pretty low number since I'm sure ActBlue had a letter campaign.
1314664625095532547 2020-10-10 04:30:46 +0800 <TVinDall> @politiwars @ewarren @TheCut Exactly why "the people" voted for Trump!

1314202229335752707 2020-10-08 21:53:22 +0800 <TVinDall> @KamalaHarris Maybe as a SENATOR you should have been more interested in tax bills than trashing a SCOTUS nominee!! I love you &amp; Biden blaming Trump for the tax code! Are you really that ignorant, or do you assume we are???
1314200469007409157 2020-10-08 21:46:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @GemmaN999 @KamalaHarris @DouglasEmhoff I was watching with my 2 year old granddaughter who looked up &amp; asked if this woman was the one who slept herself into power &amp; lies constantly to try to keep power. She then said, "Grandma! Please don't vote for her, she's awful!" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1314198404076101632 2020-10-08 21:38:10 +0800 <TVinDall> @budbaybaby @BuzzPatterson @HillaryClinton Lots of proof for anyone literate person to read. Don't understand why you don't know this.

1314191331384791041 2020-10-08 21:10:04 +0800 <TVinDall> @itskylefife Nobody has asked me! Sounds a LOT like 2016 all over!
1314182028473126912 2020-10-08 20:33:06 +0800 <TVinDall> @RealJamesWoods Once a traitor, always a traitor. This old hag has been waiting for years to again try to destroy this country!
1314180368845746176 2020-10-08 20:26:30 +0800 <TVinDall> @CNN @zbyronwolf Getting "peaceful transfer of power" advice from people who haven't accepted the results of the last election!!! Do you think ALL Americans are as dumb as the lefties you daily manipulate?!?
1314179762630393856 2020-10-08 20:24:06 +0800 <TVinDall> @zbyronwolf Well, that would be true if they weren't filling the court with radical leftists. People aren't that dumb. By saying "change the size" you're hiding the reason they need to change it.
1314174421649764352 2020-10-08 20:02:52 +0800 <TVinDall> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Ya know, the more you repeat a lie doesn't make it true. Just makes you look like more of a liar!
1314038566088052741 2020-10-08 11:03:02 +0800 <TVinDall> @AOC @Mike_Pence That would be Vice President Pence to you!
1314032258328780802 2020-10-08 10:37:58 +0800 <TVinDall> Asking Harris about Trump accepting a peaceful transfer of power, when her party STILL hasn't accepted the Trump presidency is comical!
1314030443302449152 2020-10-08 10:30:45 +0800 <TVinDall> @JRubinBlogger Hard to watch her squirm, eh?
1313859774686126081 2020-10-07 23:12:35 +0800 <TVinDall> @Ilhan Pass new tax law then! It's YOUR job!
1313859509098557440 2020-10-07 23:11:31 +0800 <TVinDall> @MagicalMerlin50 @Ilhan For real...Biden was in the Senate. Guess who passes tax law. Go ahead. Guess. Hint: it's NEVER been Trump!
1313481826116218886 2020-10-06 22:10:45 +0800 <TVinDall> @mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump When most of us have no words, we don't respond. Of course, that wouldn't get your name in the public so.....
1313118341138182145 2020-10-05 22:06:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @DrLeanaWen @realDonaldTrump Why am I not surprised you're a CNN tv doctor, who is a Planned Parenthood spokesperson &amp; tries to weigh in on a case in which you have zero knowledge?!? A real doctor doesn't say any of those things without an examination!
1311096632096755712 2020-09-30 08:12:50 +0800 <TVinDall> @Ilhan You're right. Now, as a member of Congress, why won't you DO YOUR JOB &amp; fix it!?! Stop with your other BS &amp; DO YOUR JOB!!!
1310757879075540994 2020-09-29 09:46:45 +0800 <TVinDall> @amyklobuchar It's a shame we don't have a branch of government that could change the laws to favor the little guy instead of the rich friends of politicians! I bet you'll get right on it, huh?
1310756830172381184 2020-09-29 09:42:35 +0800 <TVinDall> @CallaWalsh I don't think you understand taxes. I would be willing to bet you have NEVER paid income tax in your life. You know that refund you get...oh nvm. You'll figure it out in a few years!

I know ya'll want to believe you can do it. You can't. Your ignorant party has called for socialist policies while opening borders. They've called for defunding policy amid violence increases.

1303665708501479425 2020-09-09 20:05:00 +0800 <TVinDall> @StephenKing Easy! Most of us don't have TDS &amp; can see the virus was from China &amp; shutdowns were from Governors.   Plus, #BidenRiots backfired as did Russia, Stormy &amp; impeachment!

1303426938971844609 2020-09-09 04:16:13 +0800 <TVinDall> @Renel_maga @TimRunsHisMouth It feels like so much of the problem is complacency by constituents. Maybe the unrest will motivate some to vote in their interests?  I do feel really bad for conservatives in blue states.
1303346888750530564 2020-09-08 22:58:07 +0800 <TVinDall> @jemelehill So, you're going to make up stories &amp; tell lies?? Sounds like business as usual.

1301930432947195905 2020-09-05 01:09:38 +0800 <TVinDall> @charliekirk11 @vix_en_babe That Rasmussen poll is devastating for them!
1301930146421706752 2020-09-05 01:08:30 +0800 <TVinDall> @dfhappy I think the retired political activist/current comedian is saying he knows what's best for blacks better than actual blacks!   Sounds a lot like his leader who said if you don't vote for him "you ain't black".  Amazingly racist hypocrisy!
1301923494461145088 2020-09-05 00:42:04 +0800 <TVinDall> @dbongino I don't know how many "paid influencers" are on Team Trump, but I know A LOT of us regular people will counter those attacks!

1301916908346847232 2020-09-05 00:15:54 +0800 <TVinDall> I think, besides trying to push #HairGate out of the news, THIS is the real reason Atlantic tried their ridiculous story! Explains so much!!
1301915808742936579 2020-09-05 00:11:31 +0800 <TVinDall> @SebastianChena3 @SarahHuckabee @realDonaldTrump If you really think the Atlantic sat on an anti-Trump story for 8 months, you clearly have never read it!

1301907832586076162 2020-09-04 23:39:50 +0800 <TVinDall> So, apparently, from the comments,  not too many of their viewers read The Bible

1301902781922586626 2020-09-04 23:19:46 +0800 <TVinDall> @MZHemingway @RameshPonnuru @CalFreiburger @TimJGraham @AprilPonnuru @JeffreyGoldberg Molly, the immediate echo of all the never Trumpers have proved your point. They will lie then they will repeat the lies of their allies.  Good news? Americans learned about this practice from the Russia hoax &amp; the fake impeachment. Nobody believes them now!
1301900920117235713 2020-09-04 23:12:22 +0800 <TVinDall> @julie_kelly2 Seems like the echo chamber is back in full force! Credible sources have told ME that these people are taking their last gasp!

1301888424618717184 2020-09-04 22:22:43 +0800 <TVinDall> @CharlotteAlter I quit the second I read blacks were shot "significantly more than whites". The statement itself is blatantly false. We ALL (including you) know more whites are shot. They are a larger % of population. I'm not saying there's no problem.  Just sick of lies!  https://t.co/v6A4ev5M26

1301860488821854208 2020-09-04 20:31:42 +0800 <TVinDall> @ByronYork @dontbei This isn't news. This was debunked at the time. What? Now telling a lie twice makes it true? Pure garbage!
1301858863055024131 2020-09-04 20:25:14 +0800 <TVinDall> @Moguldom Worthless article. What is your point?
1301857459515150340 2020-09-04 20:19:40 +0800 <TVinDall> @RideWithC4T 100% agree! The problem is how Democrats want to "interpret" the Constitution to meet their agenda. It doesn't require interpretation it's very clear!  Now, if we don't accept their "vision" for America, they will destroy it. True Americans HAVE to make their voices heard!

1301634377458348037 2020-09-04 05:33:13 +0800 <TVinDall> @SaraCarterDC @AncaUngureanu13 So, Yovanovitch lied in her testimony? Remember how she was such a "fine public servant, only trying to help her country"?  What did Schiff know &amp; when did he know it?
1301632908227162112 2020-09-04 05:27:23 +0800 <TVinDall> @DeAnna4Congress @ChampionMtager Good point! Would explain her blatant disregard for masks.

1301561696121688071 2020-09-04 00:44:24 +0800 <TVinDall> So, a report that didn't pass the smell test to be released was withheld and was leaked to ABC who then presented it to the public as news?!? Oh, propagandists!! Will you never learn?

1301556826610204674 2020-09-04 00:25:03 +0800 <TVinDall> @Tonewrittenins1 @CassandraRules Or maybe...it's because Biden's crime bill pulled black fathers out of the home, black communities accepted it &amp; continued to vote dem, &amp; the black family disintegrated?? Maybe if black people stopped playing victims &amp; participate by voting for candidates who support them..

What if I were one of those crazed white supremacists your party keeps crying about? I'm just telling you WHY I'm anonymous. You tried to say that meant I was lying.

Just found your location (including your address) as well as info on your relatives and your age. All in a pretty short time. I won't need any of that, but someone may at some time. Be careful.

That includes ALL crime which OF COURSE was down with so many homebound for months. NOW? Would love to see month to month comparisons for 2019-2020. But, put some weird spin on a nonsense number if you like.

Trump said he takes no responsibility for the deaths because people like Cuomo were killing them with bad decisions.

Would've been the time to bring it front &amp; center don't you think? We know why. If was a very recent idea because of polls!!

You know Biden didn't denounce until CNN told him poll #s were dropping. Trump has been begging dem mayors &amp; governors to behave responsibly &amp; protect citizens.Again, dems own this!

I have watched it. So, like children, these people don't get their way (which appears to be removing a President) so they must riot, burn &amp; loot?

I see who, from DAY ONE, who pushed for people to "get in the streets", "push back on this administration" and "get in the faces of some Congress people". It was the dem party. It's THEIR violence and only now, when people are mad, do they denounce it!

I'll tell you facts, but the videos are online for anyone to see (well, anyone who cares enough to look at them)! I would look them up if I were you.

You people will actually believe anything they tell you. Look it up. BIDEN called Trump a xenophobe when he banned China flights. Sorry. You'll have to look up xenophobe. I'm done with you. You sound willfully ignorant at this point.

I'm sure, since you dont know what the CCP is, you haven't heard of Clinesmith. He just plead guilty &amp; is cooperating with the DOJ.  Those charges are coming.  I have no illusions the SWAMP won't protect their own, but some are going down.

Biden is an old fool that hasn't (until now) been able to fool enough people to vote for him. He's a lying racist chameleon that will literally do ANYTHING to stay in power. But, you do you, idiot!
1300605026012934144 2020-09-01 09:22:56 +0800 <TVinDall> @mikep39117214 @JayPea55348805 @Goldilo64879947 @AnthemRespect @realDonaldTrump Well, as Secretary of State, they were her responsibility. They(Ambassador Stevens)had notified State of expected trouble &amp; had asked for protection. She ignored that request. It was literally her job! And YOU'RE the one calling the other dude crazy? And,Trump caused CCP virus?

Trump has no obligation to release his tax returns.  Btw..they got nothing because she thought after the fact that it didn't matter. Remember?
