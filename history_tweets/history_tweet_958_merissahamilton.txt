Maybe he didn't get it from work

1343463016566718464 2020-12-28 15:45:18 +0800 <merissahamilton> @tinam311 It only allows him to hold the money for 45 days and ask Congress to adjust the amount.  If Congress does nothing, the money is allocated according to the original bill.

1342238638713708544 2020-12-25 06:40:03 +0800 <merissahamilton> Dear Dr Birx,  Do you have any idea how many people's parents died in isolation due to your policies  The families were prohibited from having funerals in most cases  You could have used your platform to help these families  Instead you condemned them while violating your policy
1342227058454388737 2020-12-25 05:54:02 +0800 <merissahamilton> Two Reasons  1) State and local Governments did not protect the vulnerable and seniors  2) Isolation policies caused isolated-related deaths to skyrocket
1342208939757334528 2020-12-25 04:42:02 +0800 <merissahamilton> Thank you!
1342207486124822530 2020-12-25 04:36:16 +0800 <merissahamilton> @AP4Liberty Compensation is part of the free market  When you destroy private property, you pay damages  Communism is government destroying private property and entities without compensation
1342205273679790093 2020-12-25 04:27:28 +0800 <merissahamilton> @Trantan01 @AP4Liberty Most businesses were destroyed before the loans were offered and most of the money ran out before small businesses could access it
1342205025553145863 2020-12-25 04:26:29 +0800 <merissahamilton> @AP4Liberty I said compensation  I didn't specify the form  The Federal government is absolutely a contributing factor that owes compensation  Fed govt created the guidance and the coercion
1342204607871799297 2020-12-25 04:24:50 +0800 <merissahamilton> @AP4Liberty Capitalism does not survive this crisis in your scenario  The precedent is now set that government at all levels can shut down any business at any time at their pleasure since contagious disease will persist until the end of time  The motivation for entrepreneurs is extinguished
1342203929451491328 2020-12-25 04:22:08 +0800 <merissahamilton> @AP4Liberty Bankrupt businesses and people had their resources to sue stripped by government destroying their finances  They are owed compensation and it shouldn't be on the backs of broken businesses to fight for years through a corrupt Judiciary
1342203003231756289 2020-12-25 04:18:27 +0800 <merissahamilton> @AP4Liberty Federal coercion played a major role in municipalities and States obliterating small businesses  Government at all levels knew the consequences  It was pre-meditated destruction, worse than eminent domain  These businesses and their employees are owed damages and recovery

1342200713720569858 2020-12-25 04:09:21 +0800 <merissahamilton> @AP4Liberty The government owes damages to the small businesses they destroyed

1337115421296664576 2020-12-11 03:22:13 +0800 <merissahamilton> @IAMCOFEFE1 @realDonaldTrump It's not proven they "participated," but they certainly left the door wide open with an invitation to proceed

1336479914610966528 2020-12-09 09:16:56 +0800 <merissahamilton> We reviewed about 4,000 voters age 90+  ▪️10% identified as deceased and receiving a ballot ▪️1% identified as deceased, receiving a ballot, and casting a vote  Biden's victory margin is less than 0.3%  If % held across age 79+ (200k voters), election would likely be overturned

1327417862437232640 2020-11-14 09:07:35 +0800 <merissahamilton> You are invited to our final campaign party! We had a phenomenal 90-day campaign and we will celebrate our success on Saturday, November 14th at 5:30 pm at Rustler's Rooste on the outdoor balcony overlooking our beautiful city!

1327384818124947456 2020-11-14 06:56:16 +0800 <merissahamilton> UNBELIEVABLE  Dem leaders don't want you to have Thanksgiving, but Pelosi says her political dinner for new members is very safe
1327378500509057024 2020-11-14 06:31:10 +0800 <merissahamilton> "It is no longer acceptable to campaign on our principles and then abandon them when leading and legislating."  Thank you for standing on principle @MichelleUgenti!
1327364383941410816 2020-11-14 05:35:05 +0800 <merissahamilton> @WithoutaTRACE @katiehobbs @katiehobbs had a vendor driven demo substituted for a technical test  That's not following the law  You are correct in the statement that the #AZLeg has much work to do on the ARS since we have elected officials that choose to skirt the law with the lowest of low standards
1327356951710162944 2020-11-14 05:05:33 +0800 <merissahamilton> @conservatyler Per the documentation from many states, Dominion stores the counts in batches of 200  A statistically significant hand count is a very reasonable request
1327352076146417665 2020-11-14 04:46:10 +0800 <merissahamilton> @BearDownSteven My doctor helped me the most!  Now I have the opportunity to have anti-bodies during a potentially challenging flu season  I have already received the medical advice as to how to protect myself from this flu season from my personal doctor  #TalktoYourDoctor
1327348187967811584 2020-11-14 04:30:43 +0800 <merissahamilton> @BearDownSteven It should also be noted since I was being pre-treated for COVID by my personal doctor since June, my symptoms were very mild and only lasted a couple of days  My personal doctors and early treatment are the best mitigations I had this year  ➡️A much better option than lockdowns
1327346943526277120 2020-11-14 04:25:46 +0800 <merissahamilton> @BearDownSteven The point is the science is not settled on covid or what mitigations are truly effective  I recommend people get their medical advice from their personal doctor to learn the mitigations that work best for them
1327346080636301312 2020-11-14 04:22:21 +0800 <merissahamilton> @BearDownSteven The CDC requirement is more than a 15 min interaction with someone within 6ft ➡️ that never happened  Wk I got Covid I was only at one event w/more than 10 people and wore a mask  There was a dinner I did not wear a mask because I was eating but socially distanced more than 6 ft
1327344982986874881 2020-11-14 04:17:59 +0800 <merissahamilton> I recommend you receive your medical advice from your personal doctor instead of politicians  #thatsthetweet
1327343908230025216 2020-11-14 04:13:43 +0800 <merissahamilton> @BearDownSteven I wore masks and got covid  My boyfriend wears a mask much less frequently than me and did not get covid  One of my team members is medically prohibited from wearing a mask, has underlying conditions, spent the most time directly with me and did not get covid
1327342888116600832 2020-11-14 04:09:40 +0800 <merissahamilton> ICYMI  Two and a half weeks after the mask-wearing protesters and rioters flooded our streets in May is when the spike in cases happened in Phoenix this summer  Masks didn't stop the rise in cases  Kate excused the riots/protests while condemning you for going to restaurants

Well, the categories Michigan reports monthly make up roughly 45% of all deaths. What are other big categories?  Suicide. Overdose. Accident. Alcoholism. Dementia and Alzheimer's. Homicide.

1326970034124570624 2020-11-13 03:28:04 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson If we don't have a process that's up to at least a reasonable industry best-practice standard, then future voters are disenfranchised  This is a very sad state for our democracy  A scientific statistically significant hand count is a very reasonable request
1326969289874673664 2020-11-13 03:25:07 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson It should also be noted Texas rejected Dominion because they allow public access to open USB ports  Maricopa County didn't seal these ports (27 sec in the video)   This doesn't mean there was fraud, but it does mean we had a sloppy process and election   https://t.co/CxnelSDTDy
1326968220754972673 2020-11-13 03:20:52 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson I worked in the election in 2018 since I was not a candidate.  There are rampant gaps for fraud in the old system and well documented in the Dominion system  This is why Texas rejected the software suite

1326964879488512000 2020-11-13 03:07:35 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson They didn't do a statistically significant hand count  It's not a scientific hand count  We should have the highest standards of excellence for our elections  We are far from that mark
1326959638290464768 2020-11-13 02:46:46 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson As a former technology executive, I can attest that the demo Dominion conducted for the AZ SOS is the type of demo you do when you are just trying to get the client to buy the software.   It wasn't a legitimate technical test by any industry standard.
1326959262841536512 2020-11-13 02:45:16 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson We'll have a scientific hand count and the election can't be contested for lack of published technical test of Dominion.
1326959051738017793 2020-11-13 02:44:26 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson Since this is the 3rd election in a row with perceived and confirmed issues by voters, my suggestion to quell the distrust is complete a statistically significant hand count to a 99% certainty rate with a 1% error of margin  ➡️ Between 15k - 16k Election Day and Early ballots
1326958401725763585 2020-11-13 02:41:51 +0800 <merissahamilton> @CTrevorNelson The test was a vendor driven sales demo. Not a legitimate technical test. They only published meeting minutes. They haven't published any technical test scripts or formal test reports.  Other States have lengthy publicly published reports.
1326955997882064896 2020-11-13 02:32:18 +0800 <merissahamilton> Best win of the 2020 election! Congrats @Richer4Recorder!

1302772086528552960 2020-09-07 08:54:04 +0800 <merissahamilton> I am running for Mayor with a message that Phoenix doesn't need to accept the failed dead end policies of the last 17yrs  My favorite part of the day is hearing from neighbors on their most pressing issues &amp; giving them hope that smarter solutions are on the ballot Nov 3rd  https://t.co/MugMwtXdDh
1302658645440606208 2020-09-07 01:23:17 +0800 <merissahamilton> OUTRAGEOUS!  Phoenix Mayor Kate never met a tax increase she didn't like  Now the Dems want to take over 50% of your income for their pet projects of destroying our cities and neighborhoods  I am running for Mayor to protect Phoenix from tax hikes &amp; save City services

1300832227337449472 2020-09-02 00:25:45 +0800 <merissahamilton> Mayor Kate and her allied Democrat Mayors' playbook is clear:  Violence just needs to be heard  Unsafe neighborhoods, destroyed small businesses, and lives lost are small sacrifices in pursuit of their ideological utopia   My policy is violence must be stopped #MakePhoenixSafe
