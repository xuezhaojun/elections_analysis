1323334103047942145 2020-11-03 02:40:11 +0800 <JBekkr> @AJEnglish The electoral vote does not represent the people equally. It gives some areas far more power than it should, a single vote in Wyoming is equal to 4 votes from California which is NOT Democratic. It allows a minority to rule over the rest. One Person One Voice One Vote!!!!!!

The effective range of a taser is only 30 feet. 30 feet is plenty of distance to fire a taser and drop just about anyone in a dead run. If they can fire a gun with that accuracy they can use a taser just as well. Plus it's 15 feet in some places.

Also the kid was 17 it was illegal for him to have that gun. He crossed state lines with an illegal firearm. Common sense says he wasn't there to protect anything.
1315856097048031232 2020-10-13 11:25:15 +0800 <JBekkr> @XHNews The fault lays mainly upon Trump and the Republican Party for all of the misinformation that was directly and intentionally spread.

1315384176443420672 2020-10-12 04:10:00 +0800 <JBekkr> @stjocoach @CNN As far as most other crimes are concerned I like the system Germany has in place where incarceration also equals a higher education. Offenders gain the ability to support themselves and are far less likely to reenter the system.
1315382302390673408 2020-10-12 04:02:34 +0800 <JBekkr> @stjocoach @CNN With Pedophiles rehabilitation doesn't work as it is not simply a criminal act, but an incurable mental condition. The numbers of repeat offenders is the highest among all offenses. They remain a threat their entire lives, even after treatment.
1315261780747194368 2020-10-11 20:03:39 +0800 <JBekkr> @JevvellRS @theamandawilmot @PresidentPmurt @shaunking The reason they STARTED chasing him is because he had just shot someone. If the crowd were out to kill him don't ya think the guy with the handgun would have maybe fired? even once? They were trying to disarm him.
1315092705102372865 2020-10-11 08:51:48 +0800 <JBekkr> @CNN Restorative rehabilitation sounds good until you look at statistics involving Pedophiles. 87% reoffend and 100% are not caught on their first victim. Many children suffering lifelong damage from one perpetrator. That's why we need punitive practices (or increased executions. IMO)

He is the only one to fire shots. The crowd was trying to disarm him, otherwise the guy with the handgun would have just shot him.

HUGE difference and most people use the wrong word. Antisocial refers to people who don't care about hurting others as long as they get what they want. Asocial people just don't get out much

1303855707091906560 2020-09-10 08:39:59 +0800 <JBekkr> IMO Most of them are truly chickenshit only a select few are deranged enough to commit murder over an election. Those who are, are outnumbered, outwitted and outclassed. They like to think THEY are the only ones with guns. Ironic and sad
