1344070151382175744 2020-12-30 07:57:50 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @SallyTiger @GOP The part about Section 230 is great.  Another "commission" is as worthless as every other "hearing, investigation, probe," etc. has been.  Save the money.  Everyone knows how this would turn out.
1344068985860608008 2020-12-30 07:53:12 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @P8R1OT Source?  Would love this to be true but from my research it looked like about 2M registered voters in PA didn't vote.  In no way do I think Biden won this election fairly, but I will not believe rumors either.
1344041505565106179 2020-12-30 06:04:00 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JamesBradleyCA I would love to believe you.  However, do you know how many times we have ALL heard this before?
1343925082872311810 2020-12-29 22:21:23 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @GuyChicago5151 BEAUTIFUL thought!  However with each passing day I am becoming more doubtful it will happen.
1343924717338689536 2020-12-29 22:19:56 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @berquez_e @LeighSi66345874 @shmoore75 @BillHagertyTN @realDonaldTrump Then how did PA just have 20oK plus more votes (counted) then registered voters?  Not accepting truth because it is not what you WANT to believe is an extremely shallow and dangerous road.
1343674726267252737 2020-12-29 05:46:33 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LisaMarieBoothe @OutnumberedFNC Absolutely love you Lisa.  However unless you move your brains and talent to a different network, I am afraid I may never see you again.
1343673969895821313 2020-12-29 05:43:33 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> If nothing else, this ‚Äústimulus bill‚Äù really showed us all how wasteful govt. is with OUR money. PAINFUL.  Congress is a bunch of criminal phucks!! #CriminalCongress
1343672443307626496 2020-12-29 05:37:29 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Let‚Äôs have that Kayleigh McEnany/Jake Tapper interview.  After she kicks his ass there they can have a Royal Rumble cage match!  Poor Jake would go 0-2 for the day!  #PussyJake
1343387476266803201 2020-12-28 10:45:07 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tyler_casper Not really.  My wife just told me, ‚ÄúYour job is to make money and my job is to spend it and so far we are both doing pretty good at our jobs!‚Äù  That was the end of any ‚Äúdiscussion.‚Äù
1343021520071888897 2020-12-27 10:30:57 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @AnonSevere Would love to help you out.  However when I see you have 11K followers and only follow about 150 I become disinterested.
1342988034174836737 2020-12-27 08:17:53 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @TomiLahren If the FBI is involved, it‚Äôs a guarantee we will never know the truth.
1342987584578981896 2020-12-27 08:16:06 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @GmanFan45 @POTUS Correct.  Dems don‚Äôt work with Reps. because they know they don‚Äôt HAVE to.  They will get whatever they want.  They may lie and cheat to get it, but in the end, they will get it.
1342978737864900611 2020-12-27 07:40:57 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MichelettoPatty @tyler_casper Great answer.  And correct.
1342866332212211712 2020-12-27 00:14:17 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @no_silenced Tweet of the Year.
1342865534291996673 2020-12-27 00:11:07 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender I can HONESTLY say, ‚Äúme.‚Äù
1341085845152002050 2020-12-22 02:19:16 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JamesBu82733706 LOL!  I was born in Sundance, Wy!  Have roots in Deadwood going back to 1876!
1341020970367275008 2020-12-21 22:01:28 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ArmyBratt68 Agree.  But do what?  Call üìû our Reps and talk to a machine?  Vote one crooked pol. Out so another can replace them?  Don‚Äôt wear a mask?  We are screwed.
1341020104373510145 2020-12-21 21:58:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Hey folks.  Just a little FYI.  While our reps have returned $1800.00 of our money in about 8 mos, they collected about $100,000.00 for themselves.  Still think the ruling class cares about you?  #CorruptGovt.
1341019030958841859 2020-12-21 21:53:46 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Matthew_4_Trump ...aannnd the people returning that $600.00 to us (since we paid it to them first) made roughly $100,000.00 between the first stimulus check and this one!
1340787030184366081 2020-12-21 06:31:53 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JodyBelcher7 @myinfo342 We knew this was going to be the case when nothing was done about the attempted coup of 2016.  Or Hillarys crimes.  Or our corrupt FBI and CIA. Or...
1340689817001205777 2020-12-21 00:05:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @lgadbery @jtf18james LOL  I love people like you that get all butt-hurt over nothing!  If you don't want any comments on anything, why are you putting it out on the internet for everyone in the world to see?  Chill a little.
1340684222210715648 2020-12-20 23:43:21 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @lgadbery @jtf18james Or...find something else to do besides watch TV?
1340683378174128129 2020-12-20 23:40:00 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @SherryMAGA @Chaaluna We all KNOW this.  The question now is, "Will we do anything meaningful about it, or just keep Tweeting about it?"
1340682702840877057 2020-12-20 23:37:19 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @pvtjokerus Wonder if they will "see the light" now that they have to get a job instead of just spewing liberal propaganda?  Very ironic that the very thing they have been cheerleading for over the years has led to their own demise.  #Liberalasshats
1340508604609212416 2020-12-20 12:05:31 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RightWingLawMan Johnny!
1340454089197576193 2020-12-20 08:28:53 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @gregkellyusa I will believe it when I actually do see it.  Been hearing this same shit (or something like it) since the attempted coup of 2016.  Still...NOTHING!
1340452415691173888 2020-12-20 08:22:14 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RepMattGaetz Nancy Pelosi?  Chuck Schumer?
1340451682195558408 2020-12-20 08:19:20 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> No matter who ultimately wins POTUS election, we HAVE to get RINO SOBs out in 2022!  Who is running in 2022 that desperately needs primaried?  Let‚Äôs start the fight NOW!  #PtimaryRINOs
1340313725916602370 2020-12-19 23:11:08 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @EvanAKilgore @ericswalwell We can ‚ÄúRT‚Äù all we want.  He isn‚Äôt going to resign no matter how many times we say we ‚Äúthink‚Äù he should.
1340261041008209920 2020-12-19 19:41:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RealLPoslaiko @TaraForTrump We need to find a new name for the MSM.   Something we all use and will stick.  Trump is the king of this, not me, but I will try.  "Democrat Propaganda Machine" (DPM)?  " Liberal Indoctrination Sites?"  Add yours, but lets find one!  #LiberalMSM
1340132119805374466 2020-12-19 11:09:30 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @kochtb606 @ChuckCallesto If you were in F. Collins you were only about 20 miles from Gods Country (WY), or at least where he vacations!
1340086450453397505 2020-12-19 08:08:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @kochtb606 @ChuckCallesto The ‚ÄúAnti‚Äôs‚Äù are after ALL our guns.  Keep up the good fight.  Love things in the Rocky Mtn. West (except liberal asshats in CO) although no place is perfect.  Come out sometime!
1340064683500441600 2020-12-19 06:41:32 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @no_silenced Industrial Arts teacher here.  30+ yrs.  Non union for 90% of those years and I AGREE COMPLETELY!!!
1340063260121440263 2020-12-19 06:35:53 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @GrahamAllen_1 Yes...but in the WRONG (liberal) direction.  This election and our country are almost done.
1340052885703417857 2020-12-19 05:54:39 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump He should...but won‚Äôt.
1340039700795580416 2020-12-19 05:02:16 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @electtek @Matthew_4_Trump Love SD.  Family ties in western part of the state going back to 1876!  Great Gov.  However if you look at a voting map there are lots of ‚Äúblue‚Äù areas.
1340038875301986305 2020-12-19 04:58:59 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RitaGiglietta @Matthew_4_Trump Take a look at SD voting map.  Lots of ‚Äúblue.‚Äù  Gov. Norm is FANTASTIC but the state is not really conservative.
1340038251713847301 2020-12-19 04:56:30 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @kochtb606 @ChuckCallesto Out of those I mentioned WY is my favorite.  Highest per-capita gun ownership (twice #2!) no state income tax and unofficial/official motto ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to tell me what the fuck to do!‚Äù
1340010437463650304 2020-12-19 03:05:59 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Matthew_4_Trump States that are still free and follow the Constitution; WY, TX, ND, FL, OK, ID.  Probably a few more but that is a good mix.  Everyone should be able to find what they like in one of them.
1339990408542228484 2020-12-19 01:46:23 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @towntro Yep.  Just like people were going to be held accountable for the attempted 2016 coup.  More blah, blah, blah.  ‚ÄúFool me once, shame on you, fool me twice...‚Äù
1339989662258126850 2020-12-19 01:43:25 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ChuckCallesto Ya?  So what?  Nothing will be done about it so it doesn‚Äôt really matter.
1339966069839192067 2020-12-19 00:09:41 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Dustmopp31 Champagne!  About 40 years ago and just smelling it still makes me sick!
1339965698328719363 2020-12-19 00:08:12 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RepSwalwell Why don‚Äôt you just shut the fuck up.  Or better yet, tell us all about your relationship with a Chinese spy.  If you must fart out your mouth, fart about that.
1339763939664666626 2020-12-18 10:46:29 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MisterToxicMan Same.  I feel a little guilty that I haven‚Äôt put in as much time at the range recently.  However with the price/availability of ammo it was hard to justify.
1339737072182173703 2020-12-18 08:59:43 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I'm searching folks.  I have had enough of these gutless RINO son of a bitches (basically the whole Republican party.)  Has anyone started a party for Trump supporters and those of us that still support the constitution?  Let me know!  #GutlessRINOs
1339698435667193857 2020-12-18 06:26:12 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LATiffani1 Same thing for him as all the ruling class...nothing.  No consequences.  Life as usual.
1339697994388664322 2020-12-18 06:24:26 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JoeBiden How come you get your family millions upon millions but only grant us peasants a $600.00 refund of money we paid in?
1339579804346011649 2020-12-17 22:34:48 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> We really need a new name for the ‚Äúmedia.‚Äù  One we all use and that will stick! ‚ÄúDemocrat Propaganda Team?‚Äù (DPT). ‚ÄúLiberal Liars Club?‚Äù  Help me out and let‚Äôs get it going!  #MediaLiars
1339578397010264070 2020-12-17 22:29:12 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @TreyGibbs28 @sxdoc @senatemajldr @SidneyPowell1 @GenFlynn NEVER donate to the party!  Donate? Yes.  But only to individual candidates.  The thought of even 1 penny of mine going to Romney, Collins etc. just makes my blood boil.
1339577430650966016 2020-12-17 22:25:22 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump And he will have 80M+ Patriots backing HIM!

1339561491880701952 2020-12-17 21:22:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Who is going to rise up and be our 2nd G. Washington?  Whoever it is will have a lot more soldier volunteers than the first George.  Enough talk!  It‚Äôs fighting time!  #StopTheSteaI2020
1339555315776405505 2020-12-17 20:57:29 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CallingBSonU $600.00 bucks.  Not even trying to make the bribe worthwhile.
1339553295627669504 2020-12-17 20:49:28 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Hoosiers1986 Dream on.  Won‚Äôt ever happen.  Everyone is still waiting for the indictments stemming from the 2016 election.  And you have hope for THIS one?
1339552563679653888 2020-12-17 20:46:33 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @pvtjokerus Great place.  Go a little farther south to Teton National Park.  Another great place.
1339549269850812417 2020-12-17 20:33:28 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @pvtjokerus Amen
1338842664087777280 2020-12-15 21:45:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @towntro As the Dems steal our Republic, we Tweet on, telling everyone we are fighting!
1338842259895296001 2020-12-15 21:44:03 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @kramerreport It appears so.
1338558854083334145 2020-12-15 02:57:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @reubing I am soooo with you!  I am unbelievably sick of the ‚Äúbig news coming soon‚Äù and ‚Äúhammer about to drop‚Äù crowd.  If you have FACTUAL info., Tweet it.  Otherwise, STFU.
1338550847563833346 2020-12-15 02:26:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @C_3C_3 People have been saying this same thing for months, (years?). Then, NOTHING EVER HAPPENS!  Just more of the same ‚Äúrah-rah‚Äù crap being blown up our asses.
1337505664088813568 2020-12-12 05:12:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RobertPLewis I would say UT, WY, OK and NE are the most beautiful stares on that map!
1337456005282734090 2020-12-12 01:55:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @SenSchumer What are you worried about?  If you did nothing wrong there will be nothing to find.  Just like the ‚Äúirrefutable proof‚Äù you had on Russia collusion.  Jackass
1337438944007434247 2020-12-12 00:47:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Brett_A_Moore @RedditCFB @QuaintClay Pretty sure it is some sort of communist plot!
1336848289342377984 2020-12-10 09:40:44 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ELL0100 @ConnerJanith Seems like ‚ÄúHeels Up‚Äù Harris never learned to say ‚Äúno.‚Äù!!!
1336847003637178375 2020-12-10 09:35:37 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RepAdamSchiff Hey Candy-Ass.  We are still waiting for that ‚Äúirrefutable proof.‚Äù  LMFAO!  You were a lying POS then, you are a lying POS now.
1336746875643432960 2020-12-10 02:57:45 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender Exactly how we did it in HS...and parked in the SCHOOL parking lot!
1336744899715149829 2020-12-10 02:49:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ChefSkarapz @NCGOP @realDonaldTrump @SandySmithNC @LtGovDanForest @GOPChairwoman @GOPLeader Agree.  Where is WY?  OK?  Those are two of the ‚Äúreddest‚Äù states in the Union!
1336485229679292416 2020-12-09 09:38:04 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @PISDI94_96 @DailyAwesomeGun Mine gone in an avalanche.  Or was it a forest fire üî•?
1336322579502526465 2020-12-08 22:51:45 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Absolutely beautiful.
1336032056875298822 2020-12-08 03:37:19 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @P8R1OT Tweet of the year!
1335771835892424706 2020-12-07 10:23:17 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Hoosiers1986 @realDonaldTrump Not very.
1335767315464544256 2020-12-07 10:05:20 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @KEEPINGTNRED ANY arrest for ANYTHING would shock me.  I am still waiting for Hillary‚Äôs arrest along with all the criminals from the 2016 coup attempt.  Call me when it actually happens...but not holding my breath.
1335765472541806594 2020-12-07 09:58:00 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @reg1776 @AlexBHouston Love  Oklahoma.  But the most red state in the Union is WY!!!
1335730898986274818 2020-12-07 07:40:37 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Prosperous1776 And Nasty Nancy admitted she held up any govt.  relief because Trump was POTUS!  You got that?  She ruined lives because she didn‚Äôt like POTUS.  Keep voting Dem. CA, hope you like it.
1335715285794508801 2020-12-07 06:38:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @brianstelter Then you are safe.  You are definitely not a ‚Äújournalist.‚Äù
1335647715750010880 2020-12-07 02:10:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> going for it, but NOTHING that can't be replicated elsewhere, that also includes FREEDOM.  #Shithole  #Sheep
1335647705922727937 2020-12-07 02:10:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I am trying to figure out why in the hell anyone would WILLINGLY live in NYC.  They dictate what size drink you can buy, what you can do with your own business, where you can go and what you can do.  Then they make YOU pay out the ears in taxes.  I am sure NY has something...
1335593774622384130 2020-12-06 22:35:44 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @kimKBaltimore Keep fighting girl!  You and I come from different worlds, (I am an old white male cowboy from rural WY) but we see things the same.  Very proud of you!
1335592111513751554 2020-12-06 22:29:08 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @atensnut OK  We all know there was a whole lot of election fraud.  WE KNOW THIS!  What is much more important now is the question, "Is anything going to be done about it?"
1335589883780403201 2020-12-06 22:20:17 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @TXSVIKING Answer to both, "NO."
1335589524995497986 2020-12-06 22:18:51 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @cov_Gretchen Hi Gretchen!  Suffering a little with you.  Haven't had taste/smell for about a month but it is starting to come back a little.  My nose has been broken so many times my taste hasn't been good for a long time though.  Hang tough!  It does get better!
1335588353681608704 2020-12-06 22:14:12 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I have to LMFAO at all these ppl. saying Dems are "panicking."  Why would they panic?  They know they can break the law, steal elections, lie and basically do whatever they want.  All with impunity and the MSM will cover for them.  Why would they "panic"? #BananaRepublic
1335587314228191234 2020-12-06 22:10:04 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @yogagenie @HollyAbess @LaraLeaTrump @JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Its always "soon" or "tomorrow" or "next week."  Whats wrong with "now" or "today"?  I have been waiting for Hillary and the criminals from the FBI to be held accountable for 4 YEARS!  Is this what Washington considers "Soon"?
1335420929447522304 2020-12-06 11:08:55 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @SallyTiger I am with you (older and don‚Äôt care\looks.). However early this fall I decided to lose 25 lbs.  went on my old ‚Äúwrestlers diet‚Äù and got it done in about 5 weeks.
1335401134475931648 2020-12-06 09:50:15 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @BeholdIsrael Yep.  Always something ‚Äúsoon‚Äù  ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù or ‚Äúnext week.‚Äù  Then NOTHING EVER HAPPENS!!! BlowHards
1335049645882531840 2020-12-05 10:33:34 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> The only thing Gov. Kemp calling for an audit tells me is this; He knows all the evidence has now been successfully destroyed. #Corruption
1334571948194598912 2020-12-04 02:55:22 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @realTrumpForce Something is always ‚Äúabout‚Äù to happen.  Or the hammer coming ‚Äúsoon.‚Äù  Sometimes it‚Äôs big news ‚Äútomorrow.‚Äù  THEN NOTHING HAPPENS!  What‚Äôs wrong with ‚Äúnow‚Äù or ‚Äútoday‚Äù?  #BlowHards
1334493862425997316 2020-12-03 21:45:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @towntro Everything is always ‚Äúcoming soon...‚Äù or ‚Äúbig bomb tomorrow...‚Äù. How about TODAY or RIGHT NOW!  So sick of ‚ÄúPatience‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrust the plan!‚Äù  #Results
1334227001281048579 2020-12-03 04:04:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @feingold32 If it wasn‚Äôt the end of our country as we know it, I would agree.  However, as it stands, I don‚Äôt see it as a ‚Äújoke.‚Äù
1333966101437427715 2020-12-02 10:47:57 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MajorPatriot ‚ÄúMilitary Intelligence‚Äù. The greatest contradiction of terms ever!
1333227213156659200 2020-11-30 09:51:52 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ChuckCallesto Then we are doomed.  FBI is corrupt beyond all recognition.
1333223149912141824 2020-11-30 09:35:43 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @GeorgiaPine8 That‚Äôs what we all WANT.  However it is not even close to what we will GET.
1333167917521833999 2020-11-30 05:56:15 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RealBrysonGray Still with him but...what is looking good?  Almost everything I have seen is NOT going our way.
1333167419058233349 2020-11-30 05:54:16 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ChuckCallesto They got to him pretty quickly.
1333147860192403457 2020-11-30 04:36:33 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @sistronk Just dismantle both agencies and start over...and I guarantee you Nebraska doesn't want them!!!
1333146652304158721 2020-11-30 04:31:45 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @unscriptedmike I absolutely CRINGE when I hear the FBI is involved in anything.  They are completely corrupt, from the lowliest janitor to the Director.  They can not be trusted to investigate a jaywalking.  FBI MUST be dismantled.  #CorruptFBI
1333092200608043009 2020-11-30 00:55:22 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @N8VNYCD @fieryglimmer1 @JoeBiden Any phuck that voted for this POS should be forced to foot these taxes for ALL of us!
1333086628059951104 2020-11-30 00:33:14 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RobManess You are exactly right Col.  Why waste time, effort, money when the result is predetermined and our vote won't count anyway.  I will definetly be one of the "disenfranchised" and never vote in a federal election again.
1333085312952758279 2020-11-30 00:28:00 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @kimKBaltimore @JamesDoss50 Beautiful pic and wonderful message.  However, know that it isn't "Just the 2 of us..."  There are thousands of "us" that stand with you and your message.
1332519513481490434 2020-11-28 10:59:43 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MisterToxicMan No...it just means they can do whatever the hell they want and WTP are powerless to stop them.

1332500343561842689 2020-11-28 09:43:33 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedPillBM I hope no where near this.  As corrupt as they are, if they get involved, WTP are doomed.
1332346085277306888 2020-11-27 23:30:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tedhood16 Yes.  Look what they have done with the attempted coup of 2016, "Quid Pro Joe," Hunter etc.
1332345412972318720 2020-11-27 23:27:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LATiffani1 I soooo wish you were right...but your not.  When has any Democrat EVER been held accountable for ANYTHING?  No reason to think that will change now.  Hence, no need for them to "panic" or even be worried about anything now.
1332327720680890369 2020-11-27 22:17:36 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @indacopa @gatewaypundit Any of the military personnel in Fulton County speaking up on this?  Just curious.  I haven't really heard much on this.
1332327231998324738 2020-11-27 22:15:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MisterToxicMan I might salute them with a fist!
1332326851176509441 2020-11-27 22:14:09 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tedhood16 In WY we say "Don't piss down my boots and tell me its raining."  Other than that your tweet is spot-on.
1332326377840930817 2020-11-27 22:12:16 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> No matter who is ultimately decided upon as POTUS this   time, we know Ds will do nothing to clean up fraud in the election process.  However how many of you actually believe Rs will do anything either?  Pretty telling.  #AllSwampy  #Spineless  #Cowards
1332166286634266624 2020-11-27 11:36:07 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @danhill2011 It‚Äôs already being done.  Check out Twitter, Facebook etc.  And it will be what THEY say is the ‚Äútruth.‚Äù  Most certainly not the real truth.

Do you idiots actually believe ANY liberal will EVER be held accountable for ANYTHING?  How many times do you guys need 2 b kicked in the teeth before you face reality?
1331754924682698752 2020-11-26 08:21:31 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @P8R1OT Of course.  We ALL do.  However what we WANT and what we will GET are two completely different things.
1331587713787703302 2020-11-25 21:17:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> POTUS TRUMP exposed the corruption in our govt.  Sadly it will remain and simply get worse.  Does anyone really believe Libs will do anything to clean up the FBI?  CIA?  Voter fraud.  Thanks POTUS.  WTP know, even if there is very little we can do to improve it.  #BananaRepublic
1331586913271226373 2020-11-25 21:13:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Count me among the "Disenfranchised."  Pretty obvious my vote doesn't count.  Does anyone really believe libs are going to do anything to clean up the voting process?  No way!  It will just get worse!  Our republic is dead.  It was beautiful while it lasted.  #Farewell
1331585862384095233 2020-11-25 21:09:43 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I have nothing but the utmost contempt for the fucks in Penn., Wisc., Mich., and Minn. and especially AZ.

1330637536415387648 2020-11-23 06:21:25 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ChuckCallesto That is a GOOD thing.
1330637223432237059 2020-11-23 06:20:10 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LATiffani1 Of course.  Has ANY liberal ever been held accountable for ANYTHING?

Its just like the electoral college, its not who wins the most states but who wins the large states.  This election was corrupt but this post proves nothing.
1328099789117018118 2020-11-16 06:17:19 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @BeholdIsrael Blah, blah, blah.  Sooo sick of this.  Let me know when something actually happens.  Otherwise, STFU.

1328069894160621570 2020-11-16 04:18:31 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Ok.  It is obvious the Dominion voting system is very easily manipulated and can be programmed for desired results.  The ? Now becomes ‚ÄúWas it, (Yes) and CAN IT BE PROVEN?  #CorruptDems

1327049392466096128 2020-11-13 08:43:25 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Trying to get on Parler. Got past the capcha.  Then I have to answer a code they said they sent me on "sms."  What the hell is "sms" and how do I get to it?  If Parler is this big a pain to use, I don't want it!  #Painful
1327043141682274311 2020-11-13 08:18:34 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedPillBM Recounts do absolutely NOTHING about fraudulent votes.  If a vote was cast fraudulently the first time, it will simply be counted again the 2nd time.  An election AUDIT is whats needed.
1327035020071014402 2020-11-13 07:46:18 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RealCandaceO You will have my vote girl!
1327032887661780994 2020-11-13 07:37:50 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @jeromegravesbm1 @InGodIDoTrust Not a great tweet.  If it DOES go to the House, Rs control more delegates (by a far amount.).
1326985708796588036 2020-11-13 04:30:21 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LisaMarieBoothe @SpecialReport Absolutely love you Lisa.  However if you are on Fox I will not see you.  PLEASE move your talents and brains to newsmax or OAN!
1326981317725138944 2020-11-13 04:12:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I don‚Äôt trust ANYTHING the MSM says.  So can anyone with reliable info. tell me if Fox ratings have fallen?  Not just ‚Äúsources say.‚Äù  Is it happening or is it like the NFL where millions SAY they are done watching but ratings stay the same?  #Truth
1326934267188928516 2020-11-13 01:05:57 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LATiffani1 The FBI is so incredibly corrupt it is painful.  Anything they touch is suspect.
1326933768104341504 2020-11-13 01:03:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @KevinBooker212 Not blocking me...I never followed the SOB.
1326880119621898240 2020-11-12 21:30:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @C_3C_3 True.  However proving it and then actually doing something about it will be the hard part.
1326879633359446018 2020-11-12 21:28:51 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @SteveHusker @newsmax Really liked F and Friends.  Format, hosts etc.  watched while I get ready for work.  Not anymore.  Since Fox changed hands a few yrs. ago they took a strong left turn.  They have committed suicide.
1326692785567707137 2020-11-12 09:06:23 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Hate to say it folks, but recounts are useless.  Even if a vote is fraudulent, it will be counted again, nothing is done to eliminate crooked votes.  Audits are the only thing that will work.  #CorruptElection
1326595638902054913 2020-11-12 02:40:21 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> The very WORST thing that could happen in this election fraud mess is for the FBI to get involved.  They are so incredibly corrupt ANYTHING they touch is suspect.  #CorruptSystem
1326235723259928576 2020-11-11 02:50:11 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Hoosiers1986 @JoeBiden Yes 60% of the state‚Äôs population lies in the Atlanta-Metro area.  Very liberal (dumb.)
1326235216718032896 2020-11-11 02:48:10 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @makingitpay Why not?  He knows nothing will ever happen to him.
1325973094712954880 2020-11-10 09:26:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @EvanAKilgore @realDonaldTrump No
1325941441340772352 2020-11-10 07:20:49 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @P8R1OT Why?  No Dem. has ever faced consequences for anything.  They know this will be the same.
1325905943188672513 2020-11-10 04:59:45 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @HKrassenstein How many Walmart‚Äôs do you think will get looted?  Business‚Äô destroyed or burned down?  LMFAO!!!
1325898619577307149 2020-11-10 04:30:39 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @laurenboebert Liberals spent the last 4 years calling me names, attacking my beliefs and lying to me.  Now they want me to be friends?  Doesn‚Äôt work that way. They say ‚Äúunite‚Äù they mean ‚Äúsubmit.‚Äù  Kiss my ass liberals, I haven‚Äôt begun to fight!
1325797442244149249 2020-11-09 21:48:37 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tyler_casper Depends how you count.  If breaking the same bone more than once counts as a multiple, or breaking something in two places counts as "2", I am way over 30.
1325628586217312259 2020-11-09 10:37:38 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JenniferLynneW @laurenboebert Ok.  I know you libs r dumb (or you wouldn‚Äôt be lib) so will explain.  No one disputes CO results.  Other states are questionable.  If just 1 state is fraudulent it makes the whole federal election wrong.
1325627412009377792 2020-11-09 10:32:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MichaelSv18 @laurenboebert You say ‚Äúunite‚Äù what you mean is ‚Äúsubmit.‚Äù  NEVER!
1325619582753714177 2020-11-09 10:01:52 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MtMama1776 Yes
1325619468714848256 2020-11-09 10:01:24 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MtMama1776 Yes!!!
1325505846495862784 2020-11-09 02:29:55 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RepRooney Kiss my ass.  You spent the last 4 years calling me names, lying to me and attacking my beliefs.  Now you say "come join me and be my friend?"  Doesn't work that way.  You have completely underestimated just how pissed off you have made millions of us!
1325442649646653443 2020-11-08 22:18:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Ppl. are delusional when they talk about how "conservative" TX is.   Trump won by roughly 10% there.  REAL conservative states are WY, OK and MS.  WY went Trump @70%!!! Support these states.  #TruStates
1325441360766398464 2020-11-08 22:13:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Are you ready to watch establishment Republicans give more support to radical Dem. agenda and D. admin. than they ever gave to POTUS Trump?  It will be happening in 3...2...   #GutlessRepublicans
1325440230908899330 2020-11-08 22:09:11 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JRubinBlogger Aren't going to anyway.  Ds are in power.  They are going to make it much easier to cheat in elections, insuring D wins and the cycle will endlessly repeat itself.
1325439449375838209 2020-11-08 22:06:04 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender Great thought...wont happen.  WTP will fight, but those in power (and they are the ones that matter) will fold like a cheap suit.
1325189243778420736 2020-11-08 05:31:51 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> If you want freedom, if you are tough enough (lots of ppl. aren't) if you are conservative.  Support/move to Wyoming!  Trump =70%     Biden =26% How can you not love a state where the unofficial/official motto is:  "Don't try and tell me what the f*** to d!" #LoveWY.

1325180060655972352 2020-11-08 04:55:21 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> insuring election integrity (check my timeline.)  I am a small voice and sadly nobody listened.  Now here we are.  #Crooks
1325180056151363585 2020-11-08 04:55:20 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Ds will be in power...for a long time. Does anyone think they will do anything to stem crooked elections?  Actually they will make sure it is easier to cheat.  Then they will just cheat more and remain in power.  In 2016 I yelled, I SCREAMED that our No. 1 priority had to be ...
1325178300130447360 2020-11-08 04:48:22 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Do I still "Trust the plan." Should I still "Have patience." Are things still happening "Behind the scenes."  You idiots that couldn't figure out when there were no indictments, no trials and no convictions for the attempted coup in 2016 did more harm than good.  #Idiots
1325117138303062018 2020-11-08 00:45:19 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I really wish most of our elected personnel had as big of balls as Candace Owens and Lisa Booth.  You spineless fucks need to bow up!  And ‚Äúthanks‚Äù ladies!  #GutlessRs
1325091952216387585 2020-11-07 23:05:15 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @unscriptedmike They may have been caught, but they also will get away with it.
1325091517074182148 2020-11-07 23:03:31 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @EvanAKilgore True.  But unlike Ds, Republicans NEVER stand together and most, once elected, turn into whimpering, scared, pussy Marco Rubios‚Äô. See Dan Crenshaw.
1325084237834412033 2020-11-07 22:34:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @towntro True.  But what the hell can we do about it?  Quit watching?  Done many yrs. ago. It‚Äôs just like the corruption in the FBI.  When all is said and done, there is very little WTP can do about it.  #CORRUPTION
1324869431093309440 2020-11-07 08:21:01 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @jsolomonReports @fedagentmark Well if the FBI is investigating, I feel much better...NOT!
1324844427853078530 2020-11-07 06:41:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DanCrenshawTX Never want to hear about how ‚Äúbrave‚Äù you are again.  You are a gutless coward!  When the chips are down and everyone is watching, you fold and run. Pussy!
1324842921150078979 2020-11-07 06:35:41 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @EvanAKilgore You are living in an even bigger fantasy world than most liberals.
1324842237646327809 2020-11-07 06:32:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> The people that committed this fraud are the same ones that attempted the coup in 2016 (and beyond.). Consequences will also be the same. Nothing! Not a damn thing will be done to any of them. #BananaRepublic
1324840953685987329 2020-11-07 06:27:52 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @feingold32 Exact same ppl. that were saying ‚ÄúCA is in play.‚Äù  I knew that was a fucking joke but I drank the Kool-Aid on all the other hype (Red Tsunami etc.)
1324779939091066882 2020-11-07 02:25:25 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ItsAllLove9 @P8R1OT @I_like_spaghett You are absolutely correct.  This is what happens when things are not handled immediately.  ALL Obama holdovers fired.  FBI completely dismantled.  DOJ gutted and replaced.  None of this ‚Äúwait until his 2nd term.‚Äù
1324778423848501252 2020-11-07 02:19:24 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I really feel more at ease that this election will not be stolen now. Do you? #CorruptSwamp
1324778422460162048 2020-11-07 02:19:23 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> This is great.  The FBI will b investigating voting ‚Äúirregularities.‚Äù  The same FBI that sat on Hunters laptop for a year.  The same FBI of Comey, Strzok, McCabe and Wray.  The same FBI that may b the most corrupt government organization in our history.

1324716677183926272 2020-11-06 22:14:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> All these ppl. saying they are done with #FoxNews is just like all those that said they were done with the NFL or L.

1324710796065148928 2020-11-06 21:50:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I now know what every soldier that fought and lost for a noble and just cause felt like.  Will always love ‚ù§Ô∏è my country.  I love the dream and idea of my govt.  I HATE the corruption my govt. has become.  #USARIP
1324709065919025152 2020-11-06 21:43:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @towntro Doesn‚Äôt really matter what we believe/know/trust.  We can‚Äôt do a damn thing about it.  The people in power (and that‚Äôs NOT WTP) will decide...and there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it.
1324691407878164480 2020-11-06 20:33:37 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> The media (social and MSM) is obviously the enemy.  But how do you fight them?  Quit watching?  Did that years ago and not enough ppl. will do that to hurt any MSM channel.  Never had FB.  Twitter will just censor.  Not interested in blowing up tv towers etc.  Screwed.#CorruptMSM
1324681678506381320 2020-11-06 19:54:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @towntro Blah, blah, blah.  Been waiting  for indictments.  Been waiting for someone to be held accountable.  If you have something, SHOW IT.   Otherwise STFU

1324149881699749888 2020-11-05 08:41:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> What in the hell happened to the "Red Tsunami" and "Trump Landslide" everyone was telling us about?  I guess that's what happens when I believe shit people make up.  Never been so disappointed in my life.  #GoneAmerica
1324148934378463232 2020-11-05 08:38:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Get ready for the mandatory masks, $3.50 gas, another year of shut downs, more welfare, govt. corruption high taxes for us poor bastards that work to pay for this crap and a crushed economy.  Sure hope you worthless phucks in MI, WI and especially AZ enjoy it all.  #DeadAmerica
1324086954762346500 2020-11-05 04:31:45 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedWingGrips Hell no.  He is as happy as a pig üêñ in mud watching what‚Äôs happening right now.
1324082372887912448 2020-11-05 04:13:32 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LisaMarieBoothe That‚Äôs the problem, what do WTP do that will make any difference?
1323983697700413450 2020-11-04 21:41:26 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I yelled this, I SCREAMED this after the 2016 election.  ‚ÄúNo. 1 priority MUST be securing election security and preventing voter fraud.‚Äù  Sadly, nobody listened. #KAG
1323982766028005378 2020-11-04 21:37:44 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Win or lose it is very obvious we have A LOT of work to do.  This should not even be close.  Continue minority outreach, get young ppl. involved etc.  Most of all, SECURE OUR ELECTIONS!  #KAG

1323818135099711489 2020-11-04 10:43:33 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @OANN @GrannyluvsTrump WY no surprise.  Probably the most conservative state in the U.S.  The most liberal Democrat there would be considered a moderate R in most states!

1323418482566901760 2020-11-03 08:15:28 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DanCChamberlain Had a family friend that died.  They listed just the cause you gave.  He was 87,, diabetic, on oxygen for at least the past 10 years and 75 lbs. overweight. But yea, he died of Covid!?
1323343949130584065 2020-11-03 03:19:18 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @P8R1OT Because the FBI is totally, completely and 100% corrupt.  Rotten from the top, through the core and down to the bottom.  Oh, and they are a branch of the DNC.  #CorruptFBI

1322259960928022533 2020-10-31 03:31:55 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @dbongino Unfortunately it is not ‚Äúover.‚Äù  Well over 50% of Americans list MSM as their ‚Äúprimary‚Äù source for news.  Basically they do whatever they want...and are getting away with it.
1322235380649861120 2020-10-31 01:54:15 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I am praying for Trump 100% and back him to the guilt.  BUT...if he is elected and doesn‚Äôt go full scorched earth on the swamp I will be sorely disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è. Wray, Barr etc. -gone.  FBI dismantled.  #DrainTheSwamp
1322233016081698816 2020-10-31 01:44:51 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @charliekirk11 The sad truth is...yes, they are.
1321618956050944000 2020-10-29 09:04:48 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Kristina_2020 "Where is the @FBI and @JusticeDept.?"  Hell, they are more criminal and corrupt then the #BidenCrimeFamilly !  I wouldn't trust either of those organizations any further than I could throw Stacy Abrams!
1321511037556981761 2020-10-29 01:55:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedWingGrips This really scares me.  She would never say this if she was not sure of a Dem. win.  What does she know?  Is the fix definitely in?
1321510551315456017 2020-10-29 01:54:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedWingGrips This alone should be enough to have all Americans vote red!
1321257793488326657 2020-10-28 09:09:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tyler_casper Every one of my guns.
1321255242827182081 2020-10-28 08:59:32 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @David_MagaUSA Because the FBI is as corrupt and criminal as they are!!! #BidenCrimeFamiy   #CorruptFBI
1321169859338784769 2020-10-28 03:20:15 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ACTBrigitte Aahhh...no.  It will be closer than it has been in the past,with considerably more red votes.  However there won‚Äôt be near enough votes to put it ‚Äúin play.‚Äù
1320905495784378368 2020-10-27 09:49:46 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @rezaaslan So...where are you and your pussy ass bitches at?  LMFAO!!!  All talk, no cock!
1320772589862739970 2020-10-27 01:01:38 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @P8R1OT We have Roberts.  This makes it 5-4.

1320483498218737664 2020-10-26 05:52:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @frankgk @laurenboebert Just had to laugh üòÇ here.  Someone that supports Dems, who nominated Quid Pro Joe and Heels Up Harris, talking about ‚Äúno honor.‚Äù  Priceless!!!
1320459222904152067 2020-10-26 04:16:26 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @charliekirk11 Simple.  If he kills the industry in the US, Ukraine would pick up some of that slack.  This would translate to more money for him and his crooked family.
1320366308228300804 2020-10-25 22:07:13 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender I think I am one of the only ones that can HONESTLY say they haven't watched a single play, highlight, stat etc. of the NFL this year.  And that isn't changing!!!
1320364749683646464 2020-10-25 22:01:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @GeorgiaPine8 Can agree with some of this.  However Jews will vote OVERWHELMINGLY blue/Biden.  Why?  That is completely beyond my comprehension but it is true.

1320169560272785413 2020-10-25 09:05:25 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> If Joe is elected, is he going to order a new, electric, Air Force One?  #LibIdiots
1320168815448260609 2020-10-25 09:02:27 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JoeBiden Call Hunter.  Or China.
1320166897288097792 2020-10-25 08:54:50 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> In 2016 we were "Deplorables." In 2020 we are "Chumps."  However we have always been, and always will be "PATRIOTS!" #Trump2020

1320110686333292544 2020-10-25 05:11:28 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @OmahaSpeak I sincerely hope so...but I will believe it when I see it.

1319717837716492292 2020-10-24 03:10:26 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @EmeraldRobinson Not if Biden wins.
1319614423045181441 2020-10-23 20:19:30 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> When even the POS Geraldo says "...Biden was unsure, rattled, confused...he looked old and tired," you know it was a bad night for Criminal Joe.  #MAGA
1319458323264163840 2020-10-23 09:59:13 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @BobRmhenry1 @TXMAGAMAN1 And if there is a single person that has watched this that still votes for Biden, they are brain dead!
1319457231004442624 2020-10-23 09:54:52 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @InGodIDoTrust Unbelievable!  You know he had the questions in advance too!
1319453497042010112 2020-10-23 09:40:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @cov_Gretchen When Joe is talking about closing the country, that is the economy.
1319406198354042883 2020-10-23 06:32:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Not sure why anyone (except maybe the Bidens) is excited to see the FBI has Hunter's laptop.  This is the same FBI of Comey, Strzok, McCabe etc.  The same FBI that had Hunter's hard drive and did nothing. The FBI is so incredibly corrupt that it is mind boggling. #BananaRepublic
1319366899000578048 2020-10-23 03:55:56 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @timothyjwhite78 I think it might be a device in which lead was melted, then poured into bullet molds.  However that is just a guess.
1319365886961221632 2020-10-23 03:51:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DFBHarvard @ConnerJanith Another Special Counsel?  Another investigation?  No thanks, we have all seen enough of how those work out.  NOTHING HAPPENS AND NO ONE IS EVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE!

And that is just the start of her criminal activities.  At any rate, you can believe what you want.  I will believe when I see arrests/convictions.  #BananaRepublic
1319336198549229570 2020-10-23 01:53:56 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedWingGrips That‚Äôs what we have wanted (action) for years.  We haven‚Äôt got any in the past and we won‚Äôt get any now (or in the future.). #BananaRepublic.
1319335505490808833 2020-10-23 01:51:11 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @ChuckCallesto Blah, blah, blah.  Another hearing.  Another investigation.   More testimony.  More subpoenas.  AND NOBODY IS EVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENS!!!  #BananaRepublic
1319080560971649025 2020-10-22 08:58:07 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> The theory that Biden is hiding so he doesn‚Äôt have to answer ? about laptop doesn‚Äôt hold water.  No one in media would ever ask him about it...and he knows it.  Something else is going on.  #CriminalBidens

1318694295491182593 2020-10-21 07:23:14 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> If you feel better because the FBI is now in possession of Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop you are ü•ú!  Remember, they have had the hard drive for a year and DID NOTHING!  The FBI is corrupt beyond repair.  #CorruptFBI
1318693211330797569 2020-10-21 07:18:56 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RyanAFournier I wouldn‚Äôt trust the FBI to handle or investigate a speeding offense right now.
1318338653127663623 2020-10-20 07:50:03 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MisterToxicMan Joe needs a lot of time to memorize the questions (that he has already been given) and the answers (that someone else is telling him) for Thursdays debate.
1317982414086590466 2020-10-19 08:14:29 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender Neither have I.  However I know there are a LOT of people saying they aren‚Äôt watching that are lying.
1317941775802183681 2020-10-19 05:33:00 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> How in the hell could POTUS have thought Wray was the best possible person to appoint as FBI Director?  #CorruptFBI
1317940437060124674 2020-10-19 05:27:41 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> If there is more dirt found on the #BidenCrimeFamily the FBI should be expressly forbidden from coming anywhere near it!  #CorruptFBI

1317535506473865217 2020-10-18 02:38:38 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> How awkward is it going to be for the Sunday AM news shows when they ignore the #BidenCrimeFamily story tomorrow?  #FakeNews
1317502690008702980 2020-10-18 00:28:13 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedWingGrips A VERY long time.  Remember all J. Edgars‚Äô illegal wire taps and blackmailing techniques?  The corruption at the FBI goes back decades.

1316481422543269890 2020-10-15 04:50:04 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedWingGrips Okay.  You are "crazy"...because whether or not Joe is ever elected POTUS, neither of them will ever face any real consequences.  And they know it.  Que Hillary and 33,000 subpoenaed emails.
1316434589548711937 2020-10-15 01:43:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Hoosiers1986 Doesn't really matter...none of them will face any consequences and all got fabulously rich and powerful.
1315796538615005190 2020-10-13 07:28:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I see Ds crucifying ACB for being Catholic.  Yet Catholics will vote overwhelmingly for Ds.  What in the hell is wrong with people?  #Crazy
1315788583211536384 2020-10-13 06:56:59 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Why is it that every time G. Bush said something stupid the MSM would run it for days but when Biden does it...nothing?  But the media has no bias.  Right... #MAGA
1315779189979656192 2020-10-13 06:19:39 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Anybody seen the MSM coverage of Biden saying he was running for the Sente?  Me neither. #MAGA

1315744317022130177 2020-10-13 04:01:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DC_Draino STARTING to feel like...?  If you didn‚Äôt know they have been corrupt for a very long time you must have been living in another planet!
1315730077611700224 2020-10-13 03:04:30 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DebWelp @Sundncefn I would be surprised if she was from anywhere else but Minnesota!  (Maybe NY or CA)  MN has a long history of liberalism and left wing voting.
1315340624426668039 2020-10-12 01:16:57 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @LindaBeyer11 True.  But besides blowing sunshine up all our asses Lindsey did NOTHING to stop it!
1314956442529665025 2020-10-10 23:50:21 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> The fundamental problem with democracy;  Eventually freeloaders and idiots become the majority and freedom and democracy dies.  I fear we are at that point now. #MAGA
1314924018491940868 2020-10-10 21:41:30 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Folks you have GOT to vote Republican straight through the ticket.  Especially those of you in states with tight senate races.  Losing the Senate would be nearly as bad as losing Trump!  #MAGA
1314922617741209601 2020-10-10 21:35:56 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tedhood16 It does!  Really hard for me to believe there are that many corrupt, freeloading, stupid people in America today.
1314920242464915458 2020-10-10 21:26:30 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tedhood16 Are you predicting a Trump defeat then?
1314725485121863680 2020-10-10 08:32:36 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @trumpnado4 @maggiewise111 That is a wonderful theory...but it‚Äôs just a theory.  One persons opinion.  I hope you are right but looking at all empirical data, it‚Äôs not looking good.
1314694853134036992 2020-10-10 06:30:53 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Where are all you fucking genius ‚ÄúTrust the Plan‚Äù people now?  What do u think will happen if POTUS is not re-elected?  R Schumer, Pelosi, Harris etc. going to let ‚ÄúThe Plan‚Äù move forward?  #IdiotPussies
1314647725850361861 2020-10-10 03:23:37 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @jalenjjohnson @KevinBooker212 Yes...he is a complete idiot.  The trouble is, so are many Americans.  History will look back on this and ask "How could so many, be so dumb and wreck something that was so beautiful."  Sadly, by then it will be to late.
1314589150159540225 2020-10-09 23:30:51 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DIDNOTVOTEFOR44 @floydddunagan @realDonaldTrump That's all well and good.  However if POTUS is not re-elected does anybody really think it matters?  Do you think Biden, Harris, Pelosi, Schumer etc. would let any of this go forward?  If Trump is not POTUS, all of this is dead-in-the-water and no one will face consequences.
1314576709111418882 2020-10-09 22:41:25 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @InGodIDoTrust Exactly what I was thinking.  Why do POTUS handlers always let the Ds make the rules...and then agree to them?  Why agree to things that put you at a disadvantage right from the beginning?  What conservative could possibly thought these moderators would be fair?
1314575297921126405 2020-10-09 22:35:49 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> To all you fricken' idiots that have been saying "Trust the Plan" (even though you couldn't say what "the plan" was), what happens when DT isn't in power?  What "plan" is next?  Do you think Pelosi, Schumer etc. are going to go after coup plotters?  #PassiveIdiots
1314240847299444737 2020-10-09 00:26:50 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tedhood16 My thoughts exactly.  If we were to lose POTUS, I could sleep at night knowing we are in good hands.  If Biden is elected ( please, no!) and then gone, a complete terror filled nightmare would ensue!
1313902737541734401 2020-10-08 02:03:18 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @RedWingGrips Best tweet of the year.
1313649154846011395 2020-10-07 09:15:39 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Has anybody asked Adam Schiff if he has found that "irrefutable evidence" about Trumps collusion with Russia he kept telling us about?  Since everything has been declassified, it should be easier for him to find!  #MAGA

1313567543945297920 2020-10-07 03:51:22 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @charliekirk11 That would be great, except;  They would lie...and nothing would be done about it.  They would tell the truth...and nothing would be done about it.
1313176750164189185 2020-10-06 01:58:29 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @benstracy Then go back to N. Korea.  Nobody here wants to listen üëÇ to your lying, crying candy-ass anyhow.
1313168848795906049 2020-10-06 01:27:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender That‚Äôs what SHOULD happen...but it won‚Äôt.  #BananaRepublic

"Just wait until..."  Its been 4  years since an attempted coup.  Longer since Hillary deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails.  Anyone indicted?  In prison?  Gone to trial? #Dreamer
1312885558323150848 2020-10-05 06:41:23 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @disclosetv @ItsAboutTime45 So what?  Unlike POTUS, he never gets anything done anyhow.

1312737110571483137 2020-10-04 20:51:31 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Many are saying the appointment of ACB will swing the court 6-3 conservative. It won't.  At best it will make it a reliable 5-4.  John Roberts is an unreliable, sneaky snake.  He and Romney are birds of a feather.  Remember who gave us Obamacare?  #Merica

1311714332191993857 2020-10-02 01:07:21 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CallingBSonU Agree 100%.  Unfortunately it is not looking real good that Trump will win period, let alone in a landslide.  Not only must we vote, we need to make sure all our patriot friends vote too.
1311698673399672839 2020-10-02 00:05:08 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Tactical_review OMG!  This is the kind of shit the liberal media puts out and we have to deal with.  #2A
1311415544407568387 2020-10-01 05:20:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @TX_WalkerRanger Have been tired üò¥ of it for years.  Also resigned to the fact that it is never going to change.    It is very easy to see how and why some people become ‚Äúradicalized.‚Äù
1311363599009550336 2020-10-01 01:53:40 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Not sure why people are so mad at Chris Wallace.  Everyone KNEW this was the way it was going to be and were saying so all over social media before the debate.  Then when it actually happens people are pissed?  It won't be any better in the upcoming debates.  #MAGA
1311088976254689281 2020-09-30 07:42:25 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> How can we be assured Sleepy Joe has not been given the debate questions?  Really, how do we KNOW?  #CriminalLibs
1311044634743918592 2020-09-30 04:46:13 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I sincerely hope someone has been keeping very close tabs on Donna Brazile.  Both her and Wallace work for Fox.  Both liberals.  Not a huge stretch to believe he has slipped her debate questions and she handed them over to Biden.  Didn't she do that once already?  #MAGA

1309989439234547716 2020-09-27 06:53:15 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @WillRicci Wyoming. Much more conservative than either of the other two.

In fact, nearly all indicators are pointing to a Trump defeat.  That‚Äôs really scary.  Get out and vote people!  ESP. you in toss-up states.

1308138617932525574 2020-09-22 04:18:45 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DrShayPhD Nancy would be drunk and not Know what was happening so she‚Äôs gone.  Hillary is so rotten she would gag the shark so she goes.  AOC is already brain dead so she doesn‚Äôt matter.  I guess I save Omar.
1308014259620765698 2020-09-21 20:04:35 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @no_silenced Do you think the MSM will then grill these passengers?  Will they even report them?  I have my doubts. #FakeNews
1308007795166384129 2020-09-21 19:38:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> The Republicans are following the constitution to the letter regarding SCOTUS appointment.  Dems are PROTESTING this.  Basically protesting the constitution.  Tells you all you need to know. #MAGA

1307446316902088707 2020-09-20 06:27:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Matthew_4_Trump Yes.  The question then becomes ‚ÄúWhat are you (we) going to do about it?‚Äù  #MAGA
1307417904221237248 2020-09-20 04:34:53 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> What are liberals going to do if a new SCJ is confirmed - riot, burn and loot?  Oh wait... #MAGA
1307413157791633410 2020-09-20 04:16:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @rezaaslan I‚Äôm sure that can be arranged.
1307321894086103041 2020-09-19 22:13:23 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @thebradfordfile Not given up.  They have a plan to steal the election.  Either through voter fraud or litigation,  but they won‚Äôt go down without a hell of a fight.  It‚Äôs coming-be prepared.
1307320924044251136 2020-09-19 22:09:31 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @DC_Draino Yes-if we (representatives) have the backbone to do it.  However I have very serious doubts about that.
1307319287250661376 2020-09-19 22:03:01 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @MeghanMcCain @TheView It appears your definition of ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and mine are vastly different.  #MAGA
1307317628185305088 2020-09-19 21:56:26 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Does anyone honestly believe, even briefly, that if things were switched around Dems wouldn‚Äôt fill the seat?  Come on Republicans!  For once in your lives, show some backbone and ram this through!  #MAGA
1307315524045623296 2020-09-19 21:48:04 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @JoeBiden Let me be clear: The voters did pick a President.  His name is Donald Trump.  So I guess we agree he should sulks this the successor to Justice Ginsburg.
1307313553297281024 2020-09-19 21:40:14 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @towntro The question then becomes ‚ÄúWhat are you (we) going to do about it?  #KAG

1305281036323106824 2020-09-14 07:03:44 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> I was really disappointed that the NFL ratings were only down 16% from a year ago on opening night.  I know this is just my opinion, but their ratings should have been down 50% or more!  #NoNFL

Anyone that believes the 'rank and file' that were doing the dirty work for Comey, McCabe, Strzok etc. didn't know it was illegal are willfully blind.

1303472493445951494 2020-09-09 07:17:14 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender That is freakin‚Äô unbelievable!  She is beautiful!
1303111587822264329 2020-09-08 07:23:07 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @NickAdamsinUSA @JimmyChitown Would be wonderful.  Won‚Äôt happen.  Remember when all of ‚ÄúThe Squad‚Äù were going to lose their primaries?  Then all won in landslides.  ‚ÄúThinking it, and wishing it, don‚Äôt make it so.‚Äù
1303108210971287553 2020-09-08 07:09:42 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Harleysdad65 97. After that just do it walking instead of running.
1303022415530938368 2020-09-08 01:28:47 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @atensnut Won‚Äôt even remotely happen...but what a BEAUTIFUL thought!
1303010396467613696 2020-09-08 00:41:01 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @gopg8r @woohoo9 Can‚Äôt believe Twitter hasn‚Äôt banned this yet.  Watch it folks, it will be censored soon.
1303008146143817728 2020-09-08 00:32:05 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Lori20168021 @CaptFender I am sure that is extremely beautiful and a sight to behold but...Levi‚Äôs is such a liberal company.  Switch to Wranglers!
1302743106031357954 2020-09-07 06:58:54 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tyler_casper Sleep?
1302709987530207233 2020-09-07 04:47:18 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @magajcs @DonGibs22787443 Yep.  I also remember the cigarette vending machines.
1302708143517044737 2020-09-07 04:39:59 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @charliekirk11 Sounds great.  Won‚Äôt happen.  Remember when all of ‚ÄúThe Squad‚Äù were going to lose their primaries?  Then all won in landslides.  Minneapolis-metro has all the power.  ‚ÄúThinking it, and wishing it don‚Äôt make it so.‚Äù
1302663236496564225 2020-09-07 01:41:32 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @GeorgiaPine8 I was wondering the same thing.  Big news when arrested, then...nothing.  What‚Äôs happening with her case?  Is she cooperating?  Is everyone just waiting for her to get ‚Äúsuicided?‚Äù
1302659175219105805 2020-09-07 01:25:24 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> Why is the left telling us to prepare for when Trump wins on election night but losses weeks later after all mail-in ballots are counted?  How do they KNOW most mail-in votes go to Biden?  It‚Äôs like telling us they plan on cheating. #MAGA
1302627569389445120 2020-09-06 23:19:48 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @CaptFender Now.  There were protests then but they weren‚Äôt CONSTANTLY  destroying property.  LE were still allowed to do their job.  Media had a modicum of honesty and weren‚Äôt totally one sided.  One side didn‚Äôt consistently physically attack the other like libs do to cons. now.
1302423344566935552 2020-09-06 09:48:17 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @EvanAKilgore @NikkiHaley Like her?  Yes...but not overly much.  She is better than many Republicans  but has way to many flip-flop moments.
1302422273480101888 2020-09-06 09:44:02 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @7220sports Absolutely beautiful!
1302378240305233922 2020-09-06 06:49:04 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @FixUSANow @pvtjokerus Got it!  Thanks!

1302371872076632065 2020-09-06 06:23:45 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @pvtjokerus How come when I try to watch video it tells me, ‚ÄúContent Not Available?‚Äù
1302238718858756098 2020-09-05 21:34:39 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @thebradfordfile Sounds great.  Will never happen.  Remember when ‚ÄúThe Squad‚Äù were all going to lose their primaries?  Then all won in landslides.  ‚ÄúThinking it, and wishing it, don‚Äôt make it so.‚Äù
1301941978532376576 2020-09-05 01:55:31 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @laurenboebert @POTUS @RichardGrenell Love these replies!  Typical lib retorts.  They can‚Äôt deny the facts so they attack the messenger.  As predictable as the sun coming up.  Sorry asshats, Trump nailed it again!
1301940828601044992 2020-09-05 01:50:57 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Absolutely correct.  And not a damn thing will happen to any of them.
1300900228854435847 2020-09-02 04:55:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @tevan2864 @Matthew_4_Trump ‚ÄúWhen you pick a side, make sure it‚Äôs the right one.‚Äù  #MAGA
1300856692159242241 2020-09-02 02:02:58 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Thomas1774Paine So what?  Nothing will happen to her.
1300855427987636224 2020-09-02 01:57:57 +0800 <JimBigDaddy> @Matthew_4_Trump Hell no!  This is what those people have been voting for for years.  Let them enjoy it.  ‚ÄúBe careful what you ask for.‚Äù
