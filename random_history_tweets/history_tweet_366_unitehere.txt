While these Democrats &amp; others recognize the urgent need of such relief amid a pandemic ‚Äî you'll be shocked to know some D's don't.  Here's a üßµ of that list.

1309559408435826688 2020-09-26 02:24:28 +0800 <unitehere> The bill introduced yesterday by @SenCortezMasto &amp; @SenatorDurbin would help workers like Len in contending with the uncertainty of being recalled back to work by covering 100% COBRA premium payments.

1309559407403991045 2020-09-26 02:24:27 +0800 <unitehere> It would cost Len $1,400 per month in COBRA payments to keep his health care plan ‚Äî and that'd only cover himself.   Even if Len were earning his regular income, this would be unaffordable. But since $600 expanded unemployment insurance expired in July, it‚Äôs impossible.
