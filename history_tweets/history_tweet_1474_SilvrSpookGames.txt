1301966912885157889 2020-09-05 03:34:36 +0800 <SilvrSpookGames> @TaleOfAWolf Happy #AdventureGameFriday! Neofeud 2 is a Dystopic Cyberpunk adventure game and all of the world is written, programmed, and hand-animated by myself in Photoshop! I hope to capture the feel of Beneath a Steel Sky and LucasArts / Sierra games. Neofeud 1:  https://t.co/RWwMWKTbDa  https://t.co/4PbZBchKsx

1301242215327363072 2020-09-03 03:34:54 +0800 <SilvrSpookGames> "90's Sierra Adventure game style. Better humor. Better writing. Hippy Terminator Dad. Flawed characters you learn to love. Existential crisis. Thoughtful non-judgemental analysis of current events, and challenges the systems it brings up." --Della'ne  https://t.co/RWwMWKTbDa  https://t.co/ghac92b9uU
1301241418753560578 2020-09-03 03:31:44 +0800 <SilvrSpookGames> @YappingPat Thanks! I'll put out a casting call for voice acting later on from this account. I've got a Patreon over here:  https://t.co/ZH6IYRu9Sm And also a ko-fi:  https://t.co/ttSHHoooty
