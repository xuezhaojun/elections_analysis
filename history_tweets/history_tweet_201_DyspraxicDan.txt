1320803517087580171 2020-10-27 03:04:32 +0800 <DyspraxicDan> Two years ago I got my diagnosis for dyspraxia at the age of 28 :D   I was so happy because everything made sense but kind of frustrated I wasn't aware of it all earlier.   Hopefully I can share more about my story soon :)   Until then I hope you're all having a great day!
