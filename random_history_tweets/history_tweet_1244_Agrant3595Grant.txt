You are the most vile Republican next to Mitt Romney. I hope the citizens of Maryland RECALL you as soon as possible. Thank god for Ron DeSantis.

1330981362518593539 2020-11-24 05:07:39 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Subscribe if you want to be lied to daily. This is a far left progressive newspaper pushing the agenda of globalist &amp; NWO hacks. This article about fossil fuels is truly ridiculous. 🤷🏼‍♀️💩💩
1330979477057396747 2020-11-24 05:00:10 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @AWeissmann_ Have you framed any more innocent citizens that @SidneyPowell1 will have to defend once she wins this Dominion Voter Fraud? You certainly know how to charge innocent victims with felonies and that’s about it. You never pursued the real felons like your girl Hillary and Co.
1330978240282890242 2020-11-24 04:55:15 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Of course they are not going to investigate, they are part of it all! DC is scum just like NYC, Portland ...

1330169357507440648 2020-11-21 23:21:02 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> I don’t blame them one bit. I could see many states joining in on this idea. Why should a few corrupt cities dictate the entire state?
1330167447152971777 2020-11-21 23:13:27 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @schalk761 @belinda_tbh @RealCandaceO @DonaldJTrumpJr I know right. I can assure you he loves his children and family. These people are so evil and karma is NOT going to be on there side.

We all stayed in quarantined and we all recovered just fine. The family member who brought it into the home, didn’t even know he had it. Many ppl don’t even know they are sick or transmitting it. The flu is 100x worse.
1330165280228696082 2020-11-21 23:04:50 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @danny_whufc @tpel78 @astull71 @SteveSm05708535 @JulienHoez Absolutely Self Defense! He won’t be convicted of this act of protecting himself from being killed by those losers.If these loony leftist think we are going to sit by and let them commit violence, burn, loot innocent citizens then bring it down to Florida &amp; we will see what’s up.
1330163095185072131 2020-11-21 22:56:09 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> That’s an understatement- Brian Williams nor MSNBC have any standards. Brian Williams a known liar and a propaganda channel for the left MSNBC.

1329412319303102465 2020-11-19 21:12:50 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @BryonnyM He dreams of Marxism, while having dinner at a restaurant that cost 1000.00 a person, without a mask &amp;not social distanced. Newsom, resembles the French Reign of Terror. He lives like a king, all while the homeless #’s are off the charts on the streets of all the cities of CA.
1329408842866847745 2020-11-19 20:59:02 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 I had a really good friend from Monroe, LA.  It’s by Ft. Polk. I’ve been to Ft. Polk. I am from Alabama originally so I know how those small towns can be.
1329408015078920194 2020-11-19 20:55:44 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 @GovKemp Yes he is watching and keeping a record. One day they will all be sorry for these wrongs/sins they have committed against Christians.
1329407718684307458 2020-11-19 20:54:33 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 Your so welcome. I am always here to listen and hopefully help anyway I can. It helps us to have like minded friendships to listen and understand our struggles being conservative in these crazy times. Anytime sweet friend.
1329407023935524865 2020-11-19 20:51:48 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 Good Morning. ☀️ Keep the faith. You stand for what Is good and what is right. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
1329405857558372353 2020-11-19 20:47:10 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Hell No! We already have way too many! This is disgusting!
1329405514342666245 2020-11-19 20:45:48 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Of course they did. The #VoterFraud continues. Democrats are filthy cheaters and liars. They disgust me more every single day.
1329404885511581696 2020-11-19 20:43:18 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Please do go back. Take your blue state values and move back to high taxes, high rents, high crime.  Anyone who left NY and are bitching about FL., (great red state) GO BACK now to the draconian governor/mayors. bye bye 👋
1329404020449046529 2020-11-19 20:39:52 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @Huntress62 They are a bunch of hypocrites. Gavin Newsom can wine and dine. Nancy Pelosi can get her hair done. Diane Feinstein prances around private jets and terminals without a mask. We can protest, celebrate elections, loot, commit arson and it’s all good. Go to grocery. They can Fk off.
1329402701478830081 2020-11-19 20:34:37 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> These people are whacked. Libs just have to have some made up BS to whine about.
1329400562522214400 2020-11-19 20:26:07 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Please move! You have so many great options. NY, Cali, Oregon. Move to one of these amazing democrat states. Enjoy those high taxes, high rents, extreme high food prices. See you later. Gavin Newsom doesn’t follow the science. Nor does Chris Cuomo. Nancy Pelosi, Diane Feinstein.
1329275347658035201 2020-11-19 12:08:34 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> WHAT? This is just horrible. I can’t believe these disgusting filthy animals. The left is nothing but the devil. I’m convinced they are all evil nasty people. This should be illegal &amp;the senate best do something to stop this bullying.  @tedcruz
1329271424687759360 2020-11-19 11:52:58 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @YC727USA She’s coming for him - the next governors election. He better get a grip or Republicans of GA will vote his sorry ass out!

Corona is even worse in NY. Give me a break. 👋 Bye bye. Oh, and I hope you won’t be needing the police.. crime rates are odd the chart.
1329269121859678208 2020-11-19 11:43:49 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @OldSchoolSciFi Easy, move to NY. Covid is much worse there. Enjoy the high taxes, high rent, food costs etc.
1329267320406077440 2020-11-19 11:36:40 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Yes, don’t worry they can’t hurt you. You just keep up the fight!! I’m praying for you my sweet friend.

1329259025859551235 2020-11-19 11:03:42 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 Me too! I’m over the spineless ones also that won’t stand up and fight!! Like that sorry @GovKemp in Georgia!! What is he doing to help the president with his pathetic corrupt SoS? It’s just disgusting and the ppl of GA won’t forget it.
1329258385125076994 2020-11-19 11:01:10 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> They are pathetic and they can’t prove this and that is why it was dropped. Desperate measures!
1329256441618771970 2020-11-19 10:53:26 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 Oh my goodness, Uhave been through so much. I’m so sorry Uhad 2endure so much hate. I know you are a good person and you want what is right for all the people and for the black people of this great country. You are doing what you can to get the word out there &amp;we appreciate you.
1329254869304307714 2020-11-19 10:47:11 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 I agree 💯- they want to keep the scam going for the vote. They create a crisis and then come in to save the day. I’m super impressed that you were a truck driver! That’s a hard  job to learn and to do. I don’t know if I could do it.  You go girl!! 👊🏻👊🏻🙌🏼🙌🏼🌸🌸🙏🏼🙏🏼
1329253364924895237 2020-11-19 10:41:13 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Yes he is Hitler with a nasty nose ring. He looks like a freak. His day and the rest is coming very soon. The senate better stop with the hearings and act now! Remove the 230 protection!
1329251446412484611 2020-11-19 10:33:35 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> 😂🤣😂  https://t.co/Vi6ShTySww
1329248433157312519 2020-11-19 10:21:37 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Exactly! They never want 2break the cycle of needing them 2survive. It’s sickening.They haven’t had any type of education programs or help for these schools. The schools in Dekalb County/Atlanta lost their accreditation for awhile because they were so bad. It was just shameful.
1329245620360581133 2020-11-19 10:10:26 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Excuse me but do want to ever have another Republican president elected  again? I’m sorry but you are way way off on this one. #VoterFraud #DemocratsAreCorrupt #DemocratsCheated Keep up the fight. Expose these corrupt politicians in these swing states.
1329244288824307712 2020-11-19 10:05:09 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Awe that is so kind. I wish the same for you and your family. I have made some the greatest friends on Twitter. We are all one great force fighting for the things that are important too all of our families. Lots of love and blessing too you!!
1329231096345751552 2020-11-19 09:12:43 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 And help lift these folks up out of this pattern that keeps repeating itself. Like the Opportunity zones that  Senator Tim Scott led. We have to support these single mamas and lift them up with education, and support. Break up all those gangs and give them a path to success.
1329230324396658688 2020-11-19 09:09:39 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MsBless2013 Well, I would love to hear that story if and when you feel like sharing it! I do not doubt it. Obama targeted many people covertly. I’m sorry you went through such an horrible ordeal. Obama never lifted a finger for those people in Chicago. He gave them that loser Emanuel.
1329228342680227840 2020-11-19 09:01:47 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> I’m so happy they are waking up to him because he never gave 2 cents about any black communities or the black Americans. I have been saying for years that this money we are spending on these illegals and refugees/Somalian, should be spent in our inner cities to help the children
1329227458420363270 2020-11-19 08:58:16 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Unbelievable, that SoS is a backstabbing RINO. Time to recall him!! And Recall Brian Kemp too if he doesn’t get off his a$$ and do something with this jerk.
1329227137354752001 2020-11-19 08:57:00 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> They need to recall that SoS who is a SOB! Back stabbing RINO!
1329153768399704065 2020-11-19 04:05:27 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Facts!!! I’m so sick of them all getting off and never being held accountable. Including those tech hacks also. Time to act in the senate and stop with the hearings. Nothing ever changes.
1329153337225261056 2020-11-19 04:03:44 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Piece of 💩!

1329136759209390083 2020-11-19 02:57:52 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> When is the senate going to stop the madness of these clowns? I have had enough hearings, time to take away the protection of 230.
1329102314259484673 2020-11-19 00:40:59 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Amen brother!! Absolutely facts! So something about it Tucker! You hold all the cards. #1 evening News show for your time slot. @TuckerCarlson
1329100226683166726 2020-11-19 00:32:42 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Can’t handle the facts! 🤷🏼‍♀️ It is what it is. Yes, they were beyond talented, if not musical geniuses but it doesn’t negate the deep rooted psychosis on many levels. Just saying ...

1329070705175011330 2020-11-18 22:35:23 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> They are a disgrace and I’m sure it will come back to haunt them. This is the “mean girl” at its finest. I truly cannot imagine being in the Trump’s shoes for a day. It is truly sad that the people who work tirelessly for this country are continually being attacked. I love Ivanka
1329064606111846412 2020-11-18 22:11:09 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> It has sunk to the bottom of the ocean! Ratings are in the toilet now. Morning Joe beating Fox &amp;Friends now. That is sad. @FoxNews I am all Newsmax and OAN.

Why don’t you talk to the lawyers they are doing @FoxNews job. Where are the investigative reporters? Does Fox even do that anymore? Or do they just sit around and bash Trump all day? Watch @newsmax
1329059002068688896 2020-11-18 21:48:53 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Yes he has. This is why @FoxNews is now losing to MSNBC . What a joke.

1325531265064443906 2020-11-09 04:10:55 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MacFilm4 This what it reminds me of “Men on Books” from In Living Color. lol 😂  I’m quite sure they wouldn’t be allowed to do these skits in today’s cancel culture. Someone would be triggered. Not sure “who” they are but they would be! 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️😂🤣  https://t.co/rmqvOdDbW1

1325529762123698177 2020-11-09 04:04:57 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> He didn’t give it too us to trick us into thinking we are hallucinating!!😂😂🤣🤣
1325529529654382593 2020-11-09 04:04:01 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @TheLombardiRule @MacFilm4 He looks like he has a diaper on under those pantaloons! 😂😂
1325529284824457217 2020-11-09 04:03:03 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MacFilm4 I saw someone like that N Austin TX, on 6th street about 25 years ago. I was a small town girl and I remember thinking where in the hell and what in the hell is that!! Little did I ever dream it would be common place. They just better be prepared for my daughter to stare a hole!
1325528478553415681 2020-11-09 03:59:51 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MacFilm4 @TheLombardiRule Oh hell yes it’s time to clean house! I’ve had enough of it. We cannot back down!! If we do we will never have another Republican president. SCOTUS a has to intervene and get their damn attention and DOJ needs to arrest &amp; prosecute. This has to stop!
1325527513221705730 2020-11-09 03:56:00 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @ThePete39665710 @LaraPatriot I actually volunteered but they already had enough. I’m in a red state and red county so it’s not as big here. However, I wonder if they let registered Republicans work. I don’t know but it doesn’t appear that many are allowed to be a part of the process in these rogue states.🤷🏼‍♀️
1325512080221478913 2020-11-09 02:54:41 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MacFilm4 Yes, I’m sure we are supposed to be ok with all the freaks of nature coming our way now.
1325502960722472961 2020-11-09 02:18:27 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @bpolitics Who the hell cares. This is the last thing I’m worrying myself about right now. I’m worried about the Democrats destroying America and TRYING TO CHEAT THERE WAY INTO THE WH! I’m going to fight to stop these rogue states with #VoterCorruption #VoterFraud #JoeBidenIsNotMyPresident
1325501364173213696 2020-11-09 02:12:06 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> I’m praying that’s not the case!! Trying to the the glass half full girl!! 💪🏻👊🏻 It’s been one hell of a feat that’s for sure!! He did more in 4 years than most in 3 presidential terms.  God be with him and us.
1325500639695302656 2020-11-09 02:09:13 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MacFilm4 Looks like Bubbles the clown that used to paint my kids faces back in the day. 😂😂
1325482232069443585 2020-11-09 00:56:05 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> So true! He also has symptoms of Parkinson’s. It’s so obvious. The word scramble, the resting tremors, etc. Democrats are so stupid! 🙄
1325481496128466952 2020-11-09 00:53:09 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Good for him! Finally, a man of integrity.
1325481328884772865 2020-11-09 00:52:29 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @smalltownvoice @kttrombone Zero!! Anyone who knows anything about statistics would know this is BS. Democrats do not have math skills.
1325480982217154566 2020-11-09 00:51:07 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @JuliansRum @GirlUndiscover1 Good job- I was reading it it popped up suspended!!
1325480634299654144 2020-11-09 00:49:44 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Hello!! Wake up!! The fight has just begun!
1325479519625613312 2020-11-09 00:45:18 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> That is an understatement! Canceled my @foxnation and watching @newsmax and won’t go back! Fox is dead to me.
1325479311047077895 2020-11-09 00:44:28 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @TheyCallMeTomO1 Good for him. He deserves it and much more.
1325478620501041153 2020-11-09 00:41:43 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @pwdbeached You are so right. My daughters friend goes to Cornell and she and others were studying in France,  they came home b/c the teacher that was decapitated happened on their street. Europe is one big dumpster fire.
1325477610437156866 2020-11-09 00:37:43 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> He is even dumber now than he was then, one can only imagine how bad he will screw it up now. And God forbid Kamel Toe takes over!! We must win in the SCOTUS!! 👊🏻💪🏻💯💯
1325476096658141190 2020-11-09 00:31:42 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @BenJackd1 @TBeansprout NO! Those animals don’t understand polite! We have learned from the best that is for sure!
1325475812037038081 2020-11-09 00:30:34 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @pwdbeached I just can’t even. They all are Shizz holes now and I guess they want us right there with them. Back in the day you could walk the streets of Germany any hour and it was safe. It was clean and beautiful. Now, it’s eat up with rapes and violent crime. SMH! 😡
1325473650674462724 2020-11-09 00:21:59 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Germany can fuck straight off! Your country is a shit hole! I lived there in the 80’s-90’s and I wouldn’t even visit if I won a free trip! Biden tried to steal it it but he hasn’t won it! Angela Merkel &amp;EU have ruined Germany 🇩🇪 and Europe! Germany will pay for this! 🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼
1325472003395096576 2020-11-09 00:15:26 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> My neighbors said exactly the same yesterday. I didn’t like Obama but I was busy raising my kids and didn’t really know how corrupt he was. But I got on the Trump Train, stayed up all night to watch his amazing victory and I’m not going to stop now! I’m in it to win it!👊🏻💪🏻
1325471067436101634 2020-11-09 00:11:43 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @PatriotBluesT I feel exactly the same! I’m over the shock and pissed, NOW ITS TIME TO GET EVEN AND TAKE BACK WHAT IS OURS! What is rightfully ours!

1325467724835852288 2020-11-08 23:58:26 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Yes we do! We have to stop it this time. I’m sorry if the left attempts to burn it to the ground but we are all going to burn if we keep letting them steal, lie, and cheat us. We have rights and we won’t give up the fight! This is war!
1325466501663625218 2020-11-08 23:53:34 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @DanCrenshawTX You were sucking up to the President @TPUSA . I saw it with my own eyes... so now you turn your back? This is a RINO! You and @RepKinzinger need to remember where you came from. #VoterFraud #VoterIntegrity We are going to fight this. Are you with us or not Dan?
1325463160753713153 2020-11-08 23:40:18 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @christianllamar @Transition46 He can set up all the damn accounts he wants but he will never be my president. I’m sure they are all setting up bank accounts for all the bribes they will be getting from China. Democrats only get richer in office.
1325462082997919744 2020-11-08 23:36:01 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Me Too!! I’ll never quit! It’s a new day and I’m ready to fight these lying losers.
1325461454171107330 2020-11-08 23:33:31 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Hell no!
1325451558797123585 2020-11-08 22:54:11 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Well we are certainly curious how in the hell they cheated their way to a win with such a huge lead. I made an A in statistics and this is not possible or probable!!
1325449703371251716 2020-11-08 22:46:49 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Even the voting machines apparently got to vote multiple times. #VoterFraud #JoeBidenIsNotMyPresident
1325448891655991298 2020-11-08 22:43:36 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> You are so right!

1325448197024657408 2020-11-08 22:40:50 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> BIDEN SUPPORTERS are SUPER SPREADERS!! @FoxNews @MSNBC @maddow @cnnbrk @ABC @NBCNews  Who is going to call this out? Anyone?? I didn’t think so. MSM elected JOE BIDEN not the people.
1325445983447232513 2020-11-08 22:32:02 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> He can go F off. He will never represent me. I will never stop fighting what the Democrats represent. What’s clear is the fact they lie, cheat, steal. &amp; now propping up a Stage 1 Alzheimer’s/Parkinson’s patient to be Pres. I don’t care how long it takes we will FIGHT the wrong!
1325444054851739653 2020-11-08 22:24:22 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @silver_fox9 So true!
1325443988267143168 2020-11-08 22:24:07 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> I know! Liberals ruin everything. I have to give Lorne Michaels credit, he knows what sells. He’s selling a load of 💩. 🤷🏼‍♀️@nbcsnl
1325443553871400960 2020-11-08 22:22:23 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> I used to watch SNL every week! I was a huge improv fan but not anymore. My son actually started improv classes when he was like 11. Of course he couldn’t do it now because he is a straight white male that won’t give in to the cancel culture. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1325442583825362946 2020-11-08 22:18:32 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Love this guy, just shares this artist with several young adults! 💜💜💜 Thanks for sharing.

1325314708811952129 2020-11-08 13:50:24 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @MichSoS If your voting process was not a corrupt 💩 show you wouldn’t have to answer to Ronna McDaniel!

1325299546356899841 2020-11-08 12:50:09 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @lauriecrosswell Goes to show how dumb the left is- as a matter of fact she was a judge.

1324109024485380098 2020-11-05 05:59:26 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> It’s really sad that the people just don’t see it. So many great things have come out of the last four years despite all the evil that our president had to endure. I can’t imagine living in a blue state that Is already a hellhole, knowing a senile old man is about to take over.
1324100468386258945 2020-11-05 05:25:26 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> All theseDemocrat run shit hole states hope you all enjoy becoming the next California, or Seattle, Portland Oregon.

Democrats have promised the world to them and they won’t get anything. It will all be the same. It is really sad to see the country go backwards.

1319645621989552141 2020-10-23 22:23:28 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @TheLombardiRule @TevinsAGenius The rappers rap about a lifestyle that is unrealistic, when they should try rapping about getting an education. $20,000 goes a long way to get a skill or college degree. That will pay for a lifetime of success. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1319641140346425348 2020-10-23 22:05:40 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @TevinsAGenius Facts! You are a very smart man. 💣🧨💯💯
1319628984917893120 2020-10-23 21:17:22 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Exactly, liberals like to play dumb when it’s convenient for the narrative. Unless you have been under a rock for the past 47 years like Joe you know exactly what a Coyote is and if you don’t stop talking about Obama’s separation policy.
1319627067751792645 2020-10-23 21:09:45 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Yes it is. Another attempt at silencing the right.
1319626260704886789 2020-10-23 21:06:32 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> You should delete this tweet if you don’t know what a coyote is.Libs who are faking this lie should never talk about Obama’s separation policy again.
1319625922694316033 2020-10-23 21:05:12 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Facts!
1319625634843418625 2020-10-23 21:04:03 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Imagine this wet behind the ears propaganda boy talking about a policy that Obama Administration put in place. If you don’t know about the coyotes selling these children to help illegals get across the border you need to STHU.
1319625008411529216 2020-10-23 21:01:34 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @EricMMatheny All the libs saying they don’t know what a coyote is shouldn’t be upset about Obama’s separation policy.

1301735836678057986 2020-09-04 12:16:23 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @NBCPolitics Fragile because he met with this Anti-Semite Jew Hater that follows Farrakhan? Why don’t report on this @NBCPolitics #JacobBlake #JacobBlakeIsARapist  https://t.co/MEQr4wnPXZ
1301732928913895425 2020-09-04 12:04:49 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> The Dems wouldn’t have anything to do if they didn’t investigate 24/7 . It’s not like they are there get any other work done for their constituents. 🙄🙄
1301725667147558912 2020-09-04 11:35:58 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @GwynneFitz Say he was on PCP and started vomiting 🤮.. nude for over 30 minutes in the snow and cold before the police got there. Where was his family that called the cops on their strung out brother? Not there to help him. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1301685491310432257 2020-09-04 08:56:19 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @Michael89541443 @BryonnyM @realDonaldTrump I agree. I would have never ever thought this country would be in this nightmare. It’s really sad.

To know that the former VP met with her attackers family. It’s disgusting, and she should collect every penny of the go fund me and move far away and start a new life. 🤷🏼‍♀️💯
1301670332844191745 2020-09-04 07:56:05 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @datsimpson97 @billnowickisr Why are the #MeToo movement folks not standing up for the real victim in all of this? It makes no sense Joe would meet with the man accused of sexual assault and amongst other crimes. So, the point being she was the victim, not Blake. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1301667804584738816 2020-09-04 07:46:03 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @adartproducer Trump didn’t meet with the sorry ass Blake family either. The dad is a JEW Hater. Google it. Jacob Blake, Sr.Anti-Semite. Joe met with Anti-Semite! If we dig deeper who knows what else we will find.  🤷🏼‍♀️
1301666793807847424 2020-09-04 07:42:02 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @adartproducer So has Biden... you sure as hell cant cast any stones. Not to mention Hunter, he slept with his brothers wife, then cheated on her with a stripper. Oh, and while we are on a roll don’t forget the fact that #Joementia had an affair with one of his donors wife, JILL BIDEN. 💥

1301591756727877633 2020-09-04 02:43:51 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> Exactly! But guess who did meet with the Blake family? JOE BIDEN MET WITH this thugs family. The left continues to prove that they are on the side of rioters, looters, arsonist and rapist. President Trump is for #LawAndOrder . #4MoreYears #JoeBidenSupportsCriminals

The fluids could have been swallowed into the man’s lungs. Which is highly likely.

NOT only did this man raise a thug &amp; doesn’t take responsibility for his son’s crimes, but he is a JEW HATER! This is shameful. Jacob Blake, Sr. Is a viscous vile man just like his son. #JacobBlakeSr #JacobBlakeIsGuilty

He didn’t value his own life, we had no control over his choices and/or consequences for those behaviors. He chose his own fate. 🤷🏼‍♀️

At least they will have an airway while the police retrain them and get them in the car. So when they overdose on drugs they can’t blame innocent cops.
1301572483691302914 2020-09-04 01:27:16 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @tpel78 @jackradley12 @WeNeedChangeRN @WillCleveland13 @DandC NOPE. They did not choke him. When you take PCP you have to be prepared for the side effects of overdose which leads to decreased respiratory function. Hypothermia also will decrease the perfusion of oxygen to the lungs and brain. Obviously he was lacking brain O2... 🙄

What about the safety of the police officers? If the man is spitting in their face- that is dangerous. I know medical personnel that have lost eyesight due to getting bacterial/viral sputum in their eyes. Had to have cornea transplants. 🤷🏼‍♀️
1301568149804978181 2020-09-04 01:10:03 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @tpel78 @jackradley12 @WeNeedChangeRN @WillCleveland13 @DandC Do the police travel with hypothermia blankets?Why didn’t the family get him a blanket or something to wrap him up in? Maybe because the suspect was suicidal ? Or someone strung out on drugs  wouldn’t allow clothes to be applied to he body. When do the ppl take responsibility? 🤔
1301566138531360768 2020-09-04 01:02:04 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @FlyboyDrummer @1talianG1rly The restraint order was b/c of alleged sexual assault? That is what I read but I may be wrong- regardless, his family is the last people Biden should be meeting with. Why would he validate this thugs behavior. It makes me sick. #TRUMP2020ToSaveAmerica
1301565451764486144 2020-09-04 00:59:20 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @tpel78 @jackradley12 @WeNeedChangeRN @WillCleveland13 @DandC Oh I know. I was being sarcastic. They should come up with their version of “new policing” to help these kind or calls. If they have all the answers let them handle their own problems. 🙄🙄
1301564974662377472 2020-09-04 00:57:26 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @tpel78 @jackradley12 @WeNeedChangeRN @WillCleveland13 @DandC The police need to get these families to sign a waiver before they agree to “serve and protect” a strung out nude man. The man also had been out in the snow for quite some time. These libs should look up the def. of hypothermia. He was already compromised.
1301559672508424195 2020-09-04 00:36:22 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> @75otingocni Nuts and fruits for him in prison.. 😂🤣😆

Since it was just a “mental breakdown”. I’m so sure the social workers could have handled him with such ease. If I were the police I would take my sweet time getting to any BS mess like this. They are damned either way.
1301556984580317187 2020-09-04 00:25:41 +0800 <Agrant3595Grant> What about meeting with the rape victim that Blake assaulted?  Doesn’t she matter? Why would you meet with a thugs family? Who the hell cares about a loser that fights police with a weapon? Raise your hand if you think Biden is validating a rapist? Guess it takes one to know one.
