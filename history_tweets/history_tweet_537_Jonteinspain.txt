1342819820585287680 2020-12-26 21:09:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @mobojo78 I suppose what is meant is that they can cancel the trade deal.

Clearly this is not true so why is it being done and who are you trying to fool and why? The lack of truth in this Covid matter is creating dreadful resentment

Boris was given the task of taking us out of the EU, freeing us from their laws &amp; allowing us to determine our own direction &amp; future &amp; reclaim our fishing grounds.

1339871072133459970 2020-12-18 17:52:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The EU has slashed fishing quotas in its own waters by up to 75%. Why? Do they intend to drive their fishing fleets into our waters and decimate then or is this simply part of a deal kept in the shadows, as all of the trade negotiations have been.

It doesn't seem fair and someone should explain why this happened and continues to happen. We are a Christian country and Islam is totally intolerant of it.

1339619467702267909 2020-12-18 01:12:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Well done students and staff at Cambridge university who have voted down the communists trying to curtail free speech and have voted overwhelmingly in favour of it. Now purge the Uni's of this Marxist dross.

1339617291345031179 2020-12-18 01:03:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @calipette It seems that way and with so much of the USA corruption being supported by elitists here the signs are not good. However, people will see the light and the crooks will see the gallows.

In a country like the USA if politicians get away with this level of fraud there will be no point in elections and worse, the world will follow suit.

1339612627354464257 2020-12-18 00:45:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Despite what comrade twitter is bleating on about, the simple fact of the matter is that there is overwhelming evidence to show voting fraud in the USA and if those responsible get away with it we're all in real trouble. Corruption is right up to judges in the court.
1339612091519524865 2020-12-18 00:43:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JuneriusS Of course the second most favourite defence has been used - that of mental illness.

1339610655003996165 2020-12-18 00:37:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> One of the amazing things about government is how it can destroy a country with the encouragement &amp; support of its own 'people. How the SNP can remain in office is a mystery. The EU have said there is no chance of them joining the EU so why does Sturgeon harp on about it?
1339609831326539778 2020-12-18 00:34:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The Muslim who spat in the face of a baby and insulted its white mother has been dealt with severely. 8 months in prison. . . . suspended for 12 hours, or was it six . . . . I am so disgusted. How he must be laughing at us and our feeble culture. Another outrage to contend with.
1339609335983448066 2020-12-18 00:32:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Remember the grooming and rape report which was so bad the government wouldn't let you read it. Well, they have brought out a new version which proves its dirty white men who are responsible.  Don't waste time reading it. Its whitewash of the worst kind.

I used to get up to a thousand replies, sometime more to a tweet. Today it fluctuates between 4 and 90 and they are taking hundreds of my followers every week. They took my son a week ago
1339574049786253313 2020-12-17 22:11:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> 50 years ago and a thousands people would have been looking for him. Today, its a case of so what, there's nothing we can do.   There's a lot we can do.
1339573690359554053 2020-12-17 22:10:30 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If you are losing followers by the shed load, Twitter have probably restricted the amount of people your tweets can reach. Sometimes they reduce efficacy of a single tweet by up to 90%. No secret here, they admit they can and do do this.

1339220438182977537 2020-12-16 22:46:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> With the way we are being pushed, led, directed, shoved and threatened it really does look as if the end goal is communism or globalism as they like to call it now. I don't want to see this but if its what the majority want then so be it and let's hope they've got it right.
1339178263634206724 2020-12-16 19:59:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Ever since the covid vaccine has been mooted people have been saying it will be accompanied by a certificate without which a person will be virtually unable to do anything. Its never happened before, its going to happen now but why ?
1339177177775038464 2020-12-16 19:54:54 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Just read in a German newspaper that a deal has been done in regard to the level playing field where if either party does something to disadvantage the other a fine will be made. As to which court rules one can only guess. We're going to get turned over. MP's be aware. . . .
1339172744429232132 2020-12-16 19:37:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I wonder if in the event of a deal Boris will try and force it through parliament without giving MP's time to review the terms and conditions carefully, as they should on behalf of their constituents or is the idea to get it signed before its dangers are recognised.
1339172279935262722 2020-12-16 19:35:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Don't you just love the Express. It reports the pound as "rocketing" - I suppose it is if going from €1.10.1 to €1.10.3 is "rocketing". Currency traders are reported to be agog with indifference.

I suspect this is why it went down to the wire. The need for speed will outweigh the need for responsibility and the die will be cast.

1338812974480420865 2020-12-15 19:47:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Rikmat Yes, that's correct. Ink tanks contain 70 ml of ink and replacements are in 70 ml bottles and the cost is only a fraction of that of cartridges.  Printer makers have given up on the idea of giving away a printer but stinging people for the ink. Now they charge for the printer.

1338804549629472769 2020-12-15 19:14:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When it comes to Covid the primary objection to the way its being fought or handled is that it only kills just under one percent. Fair enough but what about the tens of thousands hospitalised or made ill by the disease. Sometimes for months.
1338803835784065024 2020-12-15 19:11:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> EU negotiations grow worse by the day. We're apparently hung up on 3 things. 1. Not giving away our fish 2. Refusing not to help industry if required 3. Refusing to do anything which cripples Britain's ability to compete. All these things are ours. Why are we talking about them.

1338801709259382784 2020-12-15 19:02:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It is said you should never threaten unless you are able and intend to carry out the threat. Over the past year both the UK and EU have made God knows how many threats regarding brexit - sometimes one per week. How can these people be taken seriously? Negotiators ? Pigs ear.
1338800586704171008 2020-12-15 18:58:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Spent a long time researching printers &amp; finally purchased a Canon 6060 with Ink tanks. I've always purchased either Canon or Epson but each time I opt for Canon because photographic printing seems better. This time was no different. It's a nice printer, safely recommended.

Reclaiming a quality of life is not dependent upon forward or backward travel. For instance, free speech was something we always had but we don't have to travel backwards to get it. An honest media is another example.

1338786056309792768 2020-12-15 18:00:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @CliveRhymester Well said Clive. However your cynical appraisal of the facts is unlikely to have much bearing on the fact that we will almost certainly be sold out again by our own people. Pray this is not the case but I think not.
1338785461138026501 2020-12-15 17:58:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @LadyNoo22 Hadn't thought of that but it makes sense in a cynical way. However as Johnson didn't object to rioting before why should he bother now. Its all about the job, not the country.
1338633895479287808 2020-12-15 07:56:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> On Dec 31st we are leaving the EU. We don't want any more extensions, any more expense, any more excuses, any more threats, we just want to get on with getting back the quality of life we have lost since being in the EU. If Boris can't give us this he should step aside.

1338632844583858179 2020-12-15 07:51:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Boris says he won't allow any red lines to be crossed and he has the permission of the EU to say it.

1338531760192315393 2020-12-15 01:10:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> One of the things which clearly points to a fudge in negotiations is the way in which both parties over a long time have made no progress but ensured that everyone knew that the possibility of a deal was around 50/50. If we are cheated call Farage and lets do the job properly.

1337026232643424257 2020-12-10 21:27:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When it comes to politics, almost invariably the urge to represent the people and serve the country boils down to nothing more or less than a determination to patronise and rule them.
1337024029606219776 2020-12-10 21:19:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The situation we are now in with the EU is very simple. There are two alternatives which are walk away now or capitulate. No doubt if capitulation is the choice we will be subject to days of brainwashing concerning what a good deal we got and why we should vote tory for evermore.
1337022448034836480 2020-12-10 21:12:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @john33lfc Better still keep them out, catch and sell our own fish. They can't be trusted - they overfish constantly. Keep them out and let the fishing grounds recover. They've given us nothing but insults we should give them nothing at all.

1337020702860447750 2020-12-10 21:05:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The way their hundred metre trawlers have depleted our fish is appalling. They even ignore conservation zones because the catch is good. Keep every foreign boat out and let our stocks regenerate. The EU will punish us if we let them &amp; nothing will be left.
1337020279361515522 2020-12-10 21:04:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Its amazing how as a no deal approaches the EU are demanding Britain allow the continued plundering of our fish stocks after we have left. It's as if they think we have no legal right to the waters &amp; fish stocks which surround our islands. They are not only sick, they are stupid.
1337009460594814979 2020-12-10 20:21:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The idea of civil servants and government employees getting paid month in and out regardless of the situation is wrong when businesses are failing everywhere. Pool all income and divide it fairly until the crisis is over.

Johnson has no right to give away an asset of the people and the fish in our coastal waters are an asset. Besides which he promised us Brexit in full if we voted for him and we gave him an 80 seat majority so now he should put up or get out.
1336640601878638596 2020-12-09 19:55:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @pastoralview In fact he was already prime minister and the brexit utopia was promised if we would vote for the tories in the coming election. We did and based on his promises gave him an 80 seat majority.

If this is the case then why bother with a vaccine which only imitates the virus? Perhaps they haven't told us something.

1333715758195544065 2020-12-01 18:13:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Papers are saying Johnson has caved just because he's accepting rule from the ECHR. Does it really matter that we won't be able to send the boat people back or expel criminal, or child rapists ? Of course not. He'll have caved when our fishing grounds have gone, as they will !
1333437619565449216 2020-11-30 23:47:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @earlofhampton @Pusser14405122 @pritipatel @BorisJohnson I don't think intelligence comes into when it comes to politics. Politicians seem to have agendas very different to that of the people which tend to lean towards benefitting themselves in one way or another, something which usually does nothing at all for the people.

This alone is probably the greatest trouble of all because it indicates how controlled the dummies on the left are. Does America think for a moment that this control won't spread to all.

The idea is that they take £28 million from us and have the people believe they are doing something. Britain has given so much money to the French, for which we have received 5/8ths the square of f**k all, that you'd think we'd have learned.

1331230903532662786 2020-11-24 21:39:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The cost of getting her out of where she is will be considerable. It may also prove dangerous. Why not let the Kurds deal with her? Its nothing to do with us. They don't prosecute our criminals why should we prosecute or worse, forgive theirs.

1331229632897699840 2020-11-24 21:34:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When Begum was asked if the sight of trashcans full of  heads disturbed her she said "no it didn't". Maybe she was 15 when she joined ISIS. Then she was 16 &amp; then 17 &amp; then 18 &amp; then 19 &amp; then 20. Now she is 21 and hasn't change one iota. Which arseholes want her back in the UK?
1331227526576939008 2020-11-24 21:25:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> At long last I have worked out what the ministerial code is. With Lords awaiting trial, MP's wearing tags and paedophiles shaking in their boots the code is simple . . . . . . .FFS don 't get caught.

1331222366408634368 2020-11-24 21:05:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @laughin_gall Gates has been accused of many crimes and even if he is guilty of any of them, no one has produced a shred of evidence to show this is the case.
1331220904181903360 2020-11-24 20:59:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @laughin_gall No I don't believe it but I remain open minded about the intention because it is the belief of so many elite that this is the only way to protect the future and no doubt the future they refer to is their own.

The answer is in the hands of the people who have not yet lost their morality and patriotism. If Biden is elected the theft of democracy will benefit no one, especially democrats.
1331216853486751746 2020-11-24 20:43:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> QANTAS say that no one will fly in their aeroplanes who have not been vaccinated. This is very worrying. Where did this advice come from? Is the QANTAS chief executive a scientist or virologist? Or is he a fanatical supporter of population reduction &amp; a friend of Bill Gates?
1331216186244296708 2020-11-24 20:40:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The great reset is being achieved by striking fear into the hearts of people. It's doing this with riots, demonstrations, violence, corruption, an untrustworthy judiciary, biased police forces &amp; its doing this in the hope that one day people will beg for a new system - globalism.
1331213253003907073 2020-11-24 20:29:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The elite of the world who own 90% of it want to see the population reduced by 80%. We'd do far better and be much better off if we reduced the elite population by 80%. Or more. . . . . . !!!

Well during the Russian revolution this is what they tried to do &amp; Stalin killed millions of them. Many died of hunger and in Gulags and life was miserable until 82 years later it collapsed.   The great reset - bollocks!

1331205209452900353 2020-11-24 19:57:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @coepeecoe Ambition is a strong desire to do or achieve something and in many cases the means achieve the end. However, this is not always the case. Notwithstanding, Farage gets my next vote providing he can demonstrate something likely to last more than a couple of years.
1331203968781967361 2020-11-24 19:52:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Not only Republican voters but Democrats as well need to fear the way in which Biden has been elected. Evidence of Vote rigging is breath taking and beyond doubt and no one, be they democrat or republican should believe they have a future under people who carry on like this.
1331201981743030274 2020-11-24 19:44:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The hoax which is Covid or is in the opinion of many people, will kill 50 - 65,000 people this year according to the stats. Trouble is no one believes the stats &amp; everyone is shit scared of vaccines which are produced by someone with a desire to reduce populations significantly.
1331201042667761669 2020-11-24 19:40:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Both Anne Widecombe &amp;Nigel Farage say Johnson is going to betray the people. I do believe Nigel Farage but in fairness he is still motivated by ambition. Anne Widecombe is not. She speaks from experience &amp; I suspect what she says is soon going to be shown to be horribly correct.
1331200238397296651 2020-11-24 19:37:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MillsDavid54 Of course you are right. Trump during his term illustrated just how much corruption there is in the world and now has proved that nothing can be done about it. Communism or globalism to use the correct title, is almost with us and made possible by a failed education system
1331182743330447360 2020-11-24 18:27:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Love_Nature20 @OliviaH1776 Stacey, the only thing which frightens governments are feet on the street and loud noise emanating from crowds. One million people in parliament square protesting over ritual slaughter would see the end to the vile practice but it won't happen. The agony and terror will continue.
1331181724768854018 2020-11-24 18:23:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I have no doubt that Johnson is going to give away our fishing grounds and get nothing for them apart from a pretty bad trade deal but if we want to keep eating fish we have to keep out the 100 metre factory trawlers and the Dutch with their technique of electrocuting fish.
1331181036957556739 2020-11-24 18:21:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The big argument at the moment is over fishing grounds. However this is just evidence of more deception and bullshit. All we need to do is licence any boat that comes into our waters to fish. Everyone is happy except the EU &amp; stocks can be protected.

1330942376819494914 2020-11-24 02:32:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @duncspenc @MelissaWatsonUK Can`t see why anyone would want to go abroad &amp; take the BBC bias &amp; brainwashing with it. Many years ago instead of sending people to prison judges used to sentence people to 3 months of listening to the home service of the BBC. It was abandoned as a cruel and unusual punishment.

I have Netflix as well but currently favour Amazon. The BBC can never compete with this. We have found a better way. Scrap the licence or scrap the BBC.
1330852420205817865 2020-11-23 20:35:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> My detestation of the BBC and its putrid left wing bias and brainwashing attempts is starting to abate as I see the tremendous progress Netflix and Amazon Prime TV are making. Progress the BBC will never keep up with. The BBC is even losing viewers to YOUTUBE in the droves.

1330849639847911425 2020-11-23 20:24:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @mdnolte @davrola I think the acting in the series is among the best I have ever seen on tv. Even children were incredible as were those whose rolls were miniscule. Must have a damned good director. Hard to believe about the Welsh accent isn't it.
1330848193345712138 2020-11-23 20:18:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @mobojo78 Me to. Prefer Amazon tho'.

1330610047529988101 2020-11-23 04:32:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Watching a fantastic series on Amazon TV called "The Americans". It's worth getting Amazon Prime for this series alone.

An example of just how bad politics are when the left has them by the short hair. I look forward to their crash.

1330468677125349377 2020-11-22 19:10:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Two days ago we learnt that Johnson was given a bill by the EU just after we had officially left for 1 billion. Of course he paid it which means every tax payer in the country was stung just under £40. I wonder why he said nothing &amp; wonder if he's found out what its for yet.

In truth, the talking has gone on for so long its now embarrassing or is it all part of an act, the final scene of which is now unfolding.

Its a British asset and belongs to the British people. What are they giving us apart from insult? Do what people want you to do Boris and leave.

1329444155966230529 2020-11-19 23:19:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SheilaStenhouse It is said with justification that virtually every MP got into 'parliament by adopting the political views he or she thought would see them elected. Many who try and fail return for another try under different banners.
1329393498165010435 2020-11-19 19:58:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @HookyGolfer @ChalonerMark Don't the results so far speak volumes. What a revealing poll this has turned out to be. @borisjohnson
1329392917560102912 2020-11-19 19:55:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In the 50's &amp; 60's communists could not get into parliament. It wasn't until they ran as Labour candidates that they managed to obtain seats. Just like Corbyn did and why Starmer has booted him out of the party, which should have happened long ago.
1329119872928903170 2020-11-19 01:50:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Remember all the Boris threats about no deal if a deal had not been agreed before blank then blank &amp; then blank &amp; now blank. The idea was so as to provide businesses with both certainty &amp; time about what to expect at the end of the transition period. This has and won't happen.
1329118941688569857 2020-11-19 01:47:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Dozens of socialist Labour MPs erupt in fury as Corbyn's whip not restored  Mp's say its wrong not to restore the whip to Corbyn. Of course its wrong. Parties needs racists  and people who associate closely with terrorists. Thick sods, Corbyn was why they did not get into office!
1329106508056064007 2020-11-19 00:57:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SLMcOwan I have often though about giving them videos of just what happens and whilst I believe this would wake up everyone as to how vile this cruel stupidity is. I don't think I could bear the misery it would cause children.

1329105247697035265 2020-11-19 00:52:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Penny2449 Me neither. I find it repugnant, him being on one knee at the start of a race pleading black lives matter when his life has to be among the best and most sheltered and privileged in the world. He didn't give a shit before BLM came along and he saw the publicity in it.

1329102997960454149 2020-11-19 00:43:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The thought of giving Hamilton a knighthood is tolerable but the sight of him on one knee supporting BLM which at best is a thug organisation or an organisation which supports thugs is too much. However, the situation is already ludicrous with politicians being given them.

They really must think we are a load of plonkers in awe of them &amp; don't know what's going on. All the good people are now over at Parler where there are no limits on words or what is said.
1329022538094153728 2020-11-18 19:23:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What is so confusing about the EU negotiations is why we are negotiating to give away by way of a trade deal, things which belong to us as well as our right to govern ourselves as we see fit. It would seem surrender of our coastal waters only gives us the right to talk !!

1328879858806632448 2020-11-18 09:57:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Leaders of the worlds countries regularly go to meetings to decide how we are going to spend our future and what we can have from it. Never once is anything they arrive at told to the people. No need now is there, we have government by decree so opinions don't matter.
1328879290239377408 2020-11-18 09:54:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The rich men in the world who have most of everything want it all and globalism run by the elites will get it. No one cares even tho once everything has gone there will be nothing left but who cares. Tomorrow is another day.

They buy ritually killed meat which the public are prepared to buy and therefore have no need to double up on buying stunned meat as well. If you saw the video I did you would never eat meat again.
1328877205364109312 2020-11-18 09:46:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @cheekylatte I think they don't have the memory necessary to allow any further following by anyone and have introduced yet another algorithm which takes followers off at the same rate as they go on. Everyone has the same complaint and reports losing followers in the bucket full. Utter crap.
1328876025351114752 2020-11-18 09:41:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Laura__Fox @liarpoliticians @montie I very much doubt that. I remember many years ago a labour MP travelling to India to see a bridge we had donated and which cost millions. When he got there the bridge consisted of a few strands of rope. Nothing was ever done. No money refunded. Probably still in a Swiss account.

I don't think anything which prevents us from acting as a free people &amp; making our own decisions can be called brilliant. I doubt even if the idiot who thought of this thinks its brilliant.
1328722251638824963 2020-11-17 23:30:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Gphys1 The loss of faith is usually accompanied by the loss of courage and we all have become scared shitless by the thought of daring to think of something not approved by government or the elite controlling them. As a result we have become a nothing people, heading for nothing.
1328721558999883777 2020-11-17 23:28:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I just followed ten people who had followed me. Upon trying to follow the 11th I was suddenly told I couldn't follow any more. In the past 8 days I have only followed 10 people. What the fuck is this communist organisation trying to do ? No matter what they do I don't like Biden.
1328719918569807872 2020-11-17 23:21:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Gphys1 On top of the terror and pain caused by ritual slaughter there is the added pain and terror caused by some slaughterers who are naturally evil. We have seen pigs struck with cricket bats, burned with cigarettes and other foul behaviour but rarely see a punishment handed out.
1328719275679420417 2020-11-17 23:18:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Gphys1 And if there is a God, no one can tell me that with all his tender passion, he brought all creatures great and small into this world to be terrorised, tortured and killed by people made in his own image.
1328718643652390914 2020-11-17 23:16:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Gphys1 Something has to be done about this disgusting superstition. This country &amp; its culture belongs to a vast majority of people who don't want religious slaughter. Even eastern European countries have banned it. Not here in the Uk where animal agony is worth votes.
1328687135642279936 2020-11-17 21:11:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SLMcOwan Animal rights activists command a lot of support and this worries government which is why they will prosecute an ARA at the drop of a hat. They are more than aware that if they turn their attention to ritual slaughter they will soon have a massive, powerful following.
1328685687630159873 2020-11-17 21:05:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @RevMaxPower Flying horses, feeding the five thousand, raising the dead, walking on water, parting the red sea, ten plagues of Egypt, stopping the sun, talking donkeys. . . .got to admit it. Its very impressive and believable. If the trade description act covered religion it would be illegal.
1328684130150854661 2020-11-17 20:59:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ceefax2 I did eat meat for a long time because I believed it was humanely killed. I had no idea cruel bastards were allowed to cut throats and watch these poor creatures cough, splutter and thrash around whilst they drowned in their own blood.
1328683494831165441 2020-11-17 20:56:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I don't want to share a country with people who allow  religion to make them barbaric. Without compassion for animals or people we're all a waste of space. Why and how this is allowed to happens just shows what a crock of political shit we have in this country.
1328682763927613440 2020-11-17 20:53:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Until supermarkets can be forced to stop purchasing all their meat which has been ritually killed there is no hope. I think we should take one supermarket at a time and boycott it until it stops this vile trade. Next time you buy meat think of the fear and pain you support.
1328682293922324481 2020-11-17 20:51:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I watched a video yesterday of 40 minutes about ritual slaughter. I knew ritual slaughter it was bad but this was dreadful. I'm ashamed to live in a country where this is allowed. The fear from those animals who did not want to die was palpable &amp; the pain they suffered horrendous
1328675221893746694 2020-11-17 20:23:53 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @renalsister @bedford_colleen In truth there are UK charities who do their best for a variety of people but none with the clout and might of our major charities. If I had my way I would tax huge charities 10% of the money they raise and distribute it among our smaller charities.
1328674668849602561 2020-11-17 20:21:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @renalsister @bedford_colleen We have children going to school without breakfast because their parents can't afford to feed them and OAPs struggling to live on 600 calories or less, per day. Every scrounging charity in this country seems to be trawling money for Africa but not for the needy people in the UK
1328672792179568646 2020-11-17 20:14:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> There can be no better deal for Britain than no deal and WTO. It could not come at a better time with every country in the world bankrupting itself with Covid the EU is unlikely to be able to hurt us much more than Covid has already done so. further they desperately need a deal.
1328672079839977473 2020-11-17 20:11:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @john_carins Oh its worse than that, we also give to China. The private aircraft of the Nigerian president  (believed to be 10 of them) are also in receipt of huge donations to ensure their continuance. A good audit of foreign aid would have dozens lined up against a wall and shot.
1328670659996741632 2020-11-17 20:05:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It is being claimed that machine votes being counted in Germany show that Trump was elected with a healthy majority.

1328668071100289025 2020-11-17 19:55:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DramBooks Absolute right David and charity at home does a wonderful thing. It shows how it helps &amp; the best way to help. Sending a truck load of cash off to Africa for it to end up in a numbered swiss account is not charity - its crass lunacy &amp; we have done &amp; continue to do too much of it!
1328666174603800578 2020-11-17 19:47:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I find you offensive and made worse by being thick. We have thousands of people living on the streets, hundred of whom are seriously ill and hungry. We have tens of thousands of OAP who are hungry and worse cold. Do you think these people - our own people need any help.
1328665554887077889 2020-11-17 19:45:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Downing Street has signalled Mr Johnson is running out of patience with Brussels negotiators and could take Britain out of the EU without a deal . . .Of course he would . . . .  Good God above was that a squadron of flying pigs which just went over ??????????
1328664122175741954 2020-11-17 19:39:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Ireland no deal panic as Boris REFUSES to back down on fishing   I have been convinced that Johnson will bullshit right up to the end &amp; then fall over in defeat by the EU. If this is not the case I'll openly apologise  to him for what I have said &amp; I sincerely hope I have to.

1328313336853893120 2020-11-16 20:25:53 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Day 8962. Still the illegal migrants pour into Dover. Britain has no hotels left with vacancies and government requires all households to take at least one illegal migrant. Patel splutters that she has no more excuses to give. Boris says Bollox - I'm only doing what I am told.
1328312286562410508 2020-11-16 20:21:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @rickwebb147 That's probably about as close to the truth as anyone could get.
1328311988494151683 2020-11-16 20:20:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @UKurbanite I think a better idea would be to get a government that doesn't waste most of the money it raises, allowing taxation to be reduced significantly and vehicles to go about their journeys without let and hindrance by government.
1328310685382692873 2020-11-16 20:15:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When Twitter was first started, in the 1st year there were debates which were genuinely constructive and often fierce. Today twitter is little more than sniping by morons who have no opinions and nothing to offer &amp; who report themselves to the police for reading non PC material.
1328309777907277824 2020-11-16 20:11:44 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AS332L @S01Samuel Because Boris is a closet remainer. Look at the things he says. Brexit was a way of getting a job he had wanted for a long time. shame he's making such a pigs arse of it now.

Neither I nor anyone else voted for Symmonds to drive the two top advisers out of Downing street which apparently has happened. High office. . .the tories could walk under a rattle snakes belly with top hats on.

1328308337050603522 2020-11-16 20:06:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> With so many people believing that covid is a tool being used by those seeking globalism to smash the economy of the world &amp; force hungry people to beg for food accepting globalism as its source, you have to wonder with the way the media &amp; politicians are as to what the truth is.
1328305596320321537 2020-11-16 19:55:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> She's being called Queen Carrie because of her obvious control over Boris. Nothing wrong with that but how humiliating for Britain knowing that foreign governments will be aware of what is being said and why. And how worrying that the EU were among the first to know.
1328304397714149377 2020-11-16 19:50:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Carried Symonds may make a first class unmarried mother but its a bit much when between changing nappies she's texting Johnson with advice on how to run the country. Its not that he doesn't need it but FFS what does someone who studied theatre know about politics ? Don't answer !
1328303716148064257 2020-11-16 19:47:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> With both  brexiteers gone from Downing Street I fear for a Dec 31st clean break from the EU. More likely is we are going to fall over on everything and remain bound to their laws meaning brexit in name only. Johnson is weak. Biden has frightened him and he can't make decisions.
1328302680284991489 2020-11-16 19:43:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @nulasuchet They are abandoning everyone not just working classes. This country is really run by a dozen people, of whom 12 are not known. I keep saying it but our system of politics does nothing but support corruption and give phenomenal power to an unelected minority of elites.
1328299908089204736 2020-11-16 19:32:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> UK may not be prepared for 2030 petrol and diesel car ban as consumer demand stalls.  Pathetic government suffered by this country for years will no doubt cock this up as it has everything else. Come 2030 there will probably be no electricity and no internal combustion vehicles.
1328298211962974209 2020-11-16 19:25:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Drivers could soon be charged for EVERY mile they travel in 'poll tax on wheels'   Government by decree is proving very effective. Soon they'll be able to do away with elections because what the people think &amp; want is irrelevant. How about nose meters charging for oxygen use !
1328130455229657089 2020-11-16 08:19:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @gull_sir No but hundreds of thousand of us possibly millions recognise the dangers of continuing as we are and know that something has to be done. How much longer do we have to tolerate the political bullshit and lies which is now British politics. People need to get together and sort it.
1328129217180164096 2020-11-16 08:14:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Meat from animals which have not been stunned before slaughter is widespread in UK supermarkets. Its cheaper so the supermarkets say fuck the animals and fuck the customers who are too thick to know or care. Can't we please show we are decent people and smash ritual slaughter ?
1328128233141891074 2020-11-16 08:10:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @TLJ03255214 @MailOnline I think the world is getting very close to finding out what this has all been about.
1328079945495695366 2020-11-16 04:58:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Delilah71847825 @MailOnline I think our media is so damned arrogant that it thinks we treat their word as gospel instead of the lies, censorship and crap that it is.
1328079477067444225 2020-11-16 04:56:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Just look at the things ignored or ineffectively dealt with by this government. Child grooming &amp; rape Illegal migrants Ritual slaughter The truth Fly dumping Riots A military with enough power to defend us A failed political system Terrorism Plenty more but no more characters.
1328073412976267264 2020-11-16 04:32:30 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @OhDannyboy1972 Yes and if we ignore them much longer they'll turn into nightmares.
1328073002748088323 2020-11-16 04:30:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Michonskye Of course not. It would cost politicians a fortune. Corruptions, bungs, bribes and backhander have no role to play in honest politics.
1328071288296968196 2020-11-16 04:24:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @alpacino006 There's little difference between the parties because they are both controlled and directed by the same elite. This is why no attempt has been made to obstruct entry to Britain by illegal migrants.
1328070357836832777 2020-11-16 04:20:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DontDareSay If you were looking for a job as prime minister you'd have my vote. Crushing vehicles is a great idea. Wish I'd thought of it. How about removal of the feet of anyone caught fly dumping. That would slow them down.
1328069828079460354 2020-11-16 04:18:16 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Ella32823623 Yes, I think he is a remainer because of his belief in globalism. He says the right things but every now and again slips and makes a mistake. Build back better was one of them.
1328067692746731520 2020-11-16 04:09:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think Johnson should go and Cummings take over his job assisted by Nigel Farage.
1328067540438949889 2020-11-16 04:09:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Lescromps Yes we have but just because its not called prison, if it has bars on the windows and locked iron doors and there's no way out, the effect is exactly the same. As will be the case with the EU if we give them what we want and I fear we may well do just that.
1328036430547968003 2020-11-16 02:05:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @TEV071 @rickwebb147 They do say some inspiring things and I believe if they could prove they stood a chance of office, everyone would be on board before you could say Boo.
1328035807270154242 2020-11-16 02:03:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @elsadog_ This is what I keep saying but despite all the "keep going chaps I'm right behind you" nobody moves. Most of our population are timid beyond belief, bone idle, lethargic or just plain thick. Difficult to recruit an army from volunteers like this. . . . . . . !
1328033266042085377 2020-11-16 01:52:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @willfhamilton Rate payers in your area must have been most impressed. Surprised you were not prosecuted. Did you do it in the middle of a Sunday night.
1328032675383439362 2020-11-16 01:50:38 +0800 <Jonteinspain> All my life I've been a tory. Looking at the party now I haven't got a clue why. I see little evidence of government of the people by the people for the people just government by decree enforced by an increasingly violent police. Where is the person who is going to save us . . ?

1328020865125126144 2020-11-16 01:03:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What a problem fly dumping is. What pigs we share our country with. Easy to deal with. £20,000 fine or 5 years in prison or confiscation &amp; sale of house to pay the fine. Sure a dozen or so would make headlines but there it would end. Think I'll email Boris's bird. She might help.
1328018442910314496 2020-11-16 00:54:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Quinn1711 Awful lot of people believe this was the entire intention of covid and on a daily basis the lies and bullshit accompanying it go further in proving the case.
1328017904156151811 2020-11-16 00:51:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I wonder what Boris will do when Trump is declared winner of the election. Rush round &amp; kick Biden in the balls &amp; tell Donald he was only joking sucking up to Biden about trade deal, re-joining the EU and surrendering Norther Ireland so it can be united as a single country.
1328017081665810432 2020-11-16 00:48:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> We don't have the government, politicians or patriots to hold the UK together. Frankly, we don't even have the politicians to provide safe living, good education, available medical care or discipline. These failures will never be able to generate confidence and belief in Britain.
1328016020045504518 2020-11-16 00:44:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What is the point of going through the shite of fighting Sturgeon to keep Scotland in the Union. Muslims don't give a shit about the union &amp; they soon will be running our country. Stop the bullshitting. If Scotland wants to go - let them. Ireland won't be long after that either.

1328011452725211139 2020-11-16 00:26:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @wightview Its clear that there is no integration intention, just an intention to change everything to suit their way of life. God forbid they are successful or millions of British women will rue the day they were born. We need intelligent government with an eye on the future.

1327997788819513346 2020-11-15 23:32:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I really can't see how things can go on like they are. Politics only exists in its present form because of the way in which a country of decent people are divided and turned against each other. As a people we need to clear out this dross and bring in a system which is honest.
1327994688440307714 2020-11-15 23:19:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Just been watching "Can't pay we'll take it away" and its frightening the speed at which Muslims can organise a crowd to obstruct and intimidate. They have no fear and seemingly no respect for authority. I don't feel this growing number of people bode well for us.

1327967578778701826 2020-11-15 21:31:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Why are all UFO's described as being circular. If they don't need to be pointed to pass through air or gases then why not be square which utilises space far more effectively. What a load of crap. If aliens could get here they certainly would be able to contact us first.
1327966003339423751 2020-11-15 21:25:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @mcgheeianmcghee @2tweetaboutit @BreitbartNews David Frost has been rewarded with a seat in the house of Lords for life. His pension now is pocket money. He'll do as he is told to do. Why do you think he was made a lord at such a time. Rewards are usually at the end of a job not halfway through it.

1327964761984741376 2020-11-15 21:20:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @gull_sir You and I are just as bad. What are we/have we done about anything apart from moan. for sure I'd join any organisation whose aims were to change our political system and restore democracy. Politics today is like attending your own funeral.
1327964213181034496 2020-11-15 21:18:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JuneriusS When it comes to dogs, even a very short history of biting and bad behaviour has them banned and destroyed. I know of know dog breed which has carried on as badly as Muslims have and not to fear them with so many ISIS supporters among them is somewhat naïve.
1327963112427970560 2020-11-15 21:14:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @finland_uk To be fair, servicing either would require an act of extreme bravery.
1327961869232066560 2020-11-15 21:09:16 +0800 <Jonteinspain> No one with any belief in democracy or capitalism would allow 1.5 million people to settle in a country together with all this meant in terms of expense, crime and assault on culture.
1327960234254618625 2020-11-15 21:02:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When it comes to Merkel I'm not too repulsed by her. She clearly is a communist (globalist) and makes no effort to hide the fact and as she was brought up and came from a communist country why should she not be a communist. Before people cast a vote, they need to think a little.
1327959026756423680 2020-11-15 20:57:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @finland_uk Yes under Sharia law they are allowed 4 wives. They can also hump as many non believers on the side that they want to. Can you imagine a God laying down rules like that ?
1327958691698651140 2020-11-15 20:56:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JuneriusS Nor do thousands of British school children in the north of England.
1327958415013011457 2020-11-15 20:55:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @caterer_carol I'm not sure if the figure is correct but I seem to remember reading somewhere, that in the UK, 75% of Muslims are unemployed.
1327957985637830657 2020-11-15 20:53:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @gull_sir Doing a good job I'd say. In some of our schools a white face is as rare as rocking horse shite !
1327957538067910656 2020-11-15 20:52:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MrSonicAdvance I don't understand your question. A poll is something which "records the opinion or vote" of those being polled. There are three questions to choose from - all you need do is express an opinion if you have one.
1327956565496918017 2020-11-15 20:48:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Biedaboo @BorisJohnson The figures show how those voting think and most believe there will be a sell-out with just under a third thinking there will be no deal (not possible, the deal was done a year ago) and as for the 6% who think we are going to get a good deal. . . . FFS what are they taking. . . ?
1327955966550269954 2020-11-15 20:45:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @mike_automan49 I'd like to think this was possible Mike but the people of this country have their arse drop out if they read a tweet which expresses dislike for illegal migrants or anything else which challenges the state.
1327955359840022530 2020-11-15 20:43:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I don't agree with Muslims having up to 4 wives in this country. Its not the law nor is it our tradition or culture. By all means be free to live in our country but not free to campaign for massive changes for miniscule minorities.
1327954749870706689 2020-11-15 20:40:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> An analogy of todays politics is someone pushing a finger deeper and deeper into your eye. Do nothing at your own peril. Stop him and the problem is resolved. The people of our country need to be heard and have a system which involves them with their own wellbeing and future.
1327948385169641472 2020-11-15 20:15:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @M1Charles1M @ThedFrom @Conservatives Nothing and there is little difference between any of the political parties when it comes to lying, deception and betrayal. In the USA politicians have pushed the people to the brink and here in the UK I suspect the situation is very similar. I personally am sick of politicians.
1327947676663607296 2020-11-15 20:12:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> One of the greatest thespian leaders we have had in a long time - (have you seen his Winston Churchill act) you have to hand it to Boris when it comes to selection of a lady friend. Carrie Symonds attended the university of Warwick, where she studied art history &amp; theatre !!!
1327943459584552960 2020-11-15 19:56:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The voting so far does not appear to show too much confidence in the Prime Minister.
1327941828449071104 2020-11-15 19:49:38 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The past year has slid by, lubricated with loads of bullshit, promises &amp; guarantees concerning our leaving the EU. Boris Johnson and Co have had their say but :  What do YOU think the situation is going to be ?  1. No deal 2. Sell-out deal 3. A good deal  Pse r/t for the numbers.
1327939323791028225 2020-11-15 19:39:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Anytime now the bullshitting will stop and we'll know just what the situation with the EU is. What do you think faces us by way of a deal with the EU :  1. No deal 2. Sell out deal 3. Excellent deal   Retweet for the numbers please.
1327937140605538304 2020-11-15 19:31:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If we're lucky, the end of a political system which serves nothing but those involved in running it is in sight. Politicians divvy up the wealth of the country in the interests of themselves &amp; their friends. They don't serve the people - they exploit them and it shows painfully.
1327934590791675905 2020-11-15 19:20:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SarahDinham @cat_voltaire @AmyMek @johnlockesclock Its lunacy but as the intention seems to be to have Islam inherit Britain and its way of life this comment isn't worth the time it takes to read. Its all part of a plan which is now beyond stopping.
1327932761445961734 2020-11-15 19:13:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AnissaMakris Sympathise with you. Here in Britain most of us are pissed off with politics and the state.
1327932431190663168 2020-11-15 19:12:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Johnson never convinced me he was for leaving the EU. I think he took the brexiteer stance for reasons of his personal ambition and having achieved this and now without the conscience of Cummings, any trade deal may well not be in Britain's best interests. Soon we'll know.
1327691444795166723 2020-11-15 03:14:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> There's even talk now that Cummins having gone brexit may well be overturned in some way or other. Why I backed Johnson and not Farage I'll never know. I promise it will never happen again.
1327691113826750471 2020-11-15 03:13:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Mow that Cummins has left no 10 I fear that Johnson will now give the EU everything they want. The EU seem to think so and that being the case I wonder just how much more humiliation we are going to have to suffer from this buffoon and his bird.
1327658594184163330 2020-11-15 01:04:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think we will find that Johnson has given the EU everything they want in regard to our coastal waters and fish but only for another two years . . . .and then another two years, and then another 10 years and then we won't have any fish.
1327658242797940736 2020-11-15 01:02:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Good isn't it. Johnson living over the sticks with his bird in Number 10 (does any other world leader live like this) the EU deal done and consisting of everything he promised we would not get.   It's our fault, we sat on our fat arses believing that moaning will put things right

Black privilege put white privilege to shame.
1327582293666516992 2020-11-14 20:00:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @2BeeAware @BorisJohnson I think you'd better brace yourself. If you for one moment believe Johnson is going to provide what he promised then you really are in for a lot of misery.
1327579324434821124 2020-11-14 19:49:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Perramas1337 I'm sure the fact and sentiment behind the statement are true and justified but its the same corrupt filth running the CIA, FBI, MSM and making up most of the judges and without these people the USA will never see justice, democracy or a future worth having.
1327578098309718016 2020-11-14 19:44:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @GodfreyOfAcre Tell me. . . .has anyone called you a prick lately. . . . . ?
1327577755383377920 2020-11-14 19:42:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What happened to the Nightingale hospitals which were opened to deal with huge amounts and then closed after great expense ? We are now hearing from government that the health service could be overwhelmed by covid. WTF is going on?   Carrie Symonds, answer the damned question.
1327576627472109569 2020-11-14 19:38:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @GodfreyOfAcre Not a difficult task. There are tens of thousands of them around.

1327571539584225280 2020-11-14 19:18:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Perramas1337 I hope you are right but if Biden gets behind the desk I think we are all in very real trouble. The intention is to change the world to suit the elite and having seen the extent they are going to in order to do this it does not bode well for our future.

Are you an expert on newspapers as well or are you merely airing your opinion? To answer your question, no I don't realise how daft that sounds !

1327565285969293312 2020-11-14 18:53:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @GregDeR7 That was the work of Cummings but now Johnson's girlfriend has got rid of him. The first 2 items you mention have no interest for me and little evidence exists to show they have achieved anything. As for the third item - are you mad?  immigration is out of control . Go to Dover.
1327564329659604992 2020-11-14 18:49:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> History is full and I mean full of emperors, kings, dictators, autocrats, tyrants, monarchs, leaders, despots who were all brought down, together with their country's and empires because of the little woman behind them. I suspect Johnson is going to prove this. As will Harry.
1327562242565476354 2020-11-14 18:41:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Carole Malone in Saturdays Daily Express makes everything clear. Johnson "girlfriend" is running the country. She's once told magistrates she would do anything to get into No. 10. She's certainly proved that. Apparently she caused the resignation of Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings.
1327560257137242112 2020-11-14 18:33:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson Boris Johnson's MEDDLING fiancé caused CHAOS in Downing Street, says CAROLE MALONE .  It seems that not only are princes pussy whipped but prime ministers as well. It's well known that the standing prick has no conscience but this is one of the worst examples.
1327403973897302018 2020-11-14 08:12:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Barnier get brand new Brexit fisheries plan in last-ditch bid to break deadlock   They've offered all our fishing grounds plus £5 billion  a year if the EU will plunder them. Brexiteers are going to have shit fits when they see what Johnson has done.    https://t.co/y7devMKQkI
1327305275792121861 2020-11-14 01:40:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> My son has landed himself in trouble again. He has this inability to accept fly tipping and on Sunday he came across someone dumping junk at a road side and trashed his care which got him arrested. The fly tipper will get told off &amp; my son will no doubt end up heavily fined.
1327304202943606785 2020-11-14 01:35:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Johnson is now making a pigs arse of everything and if he continues in this vein we'll never be free of the EU or its influence. Our military is laughable, China is threatening the world and Johnson is helping it by making us feeble. He's weak and its showing more and more.
1327303701426561026 2020-11-14 01:33:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Dominic Cummings 'poised to resign before December' after Johnson aide quits.  Johnson seems to be doing very well and if he continues like this it shouldn't be long before we are without a military, a future and are in the EU paying 3 times as much as we used to.
1327301529766916103 2020-11-14 01:25:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Army could be slashed to smaller than GERMANY'S as troops 'already over-stretched'   The smaller our military get the less competent it is because those with knowledge to pass on are lost. We don't have enough troops so reduce them further. Dear God   https://t.co/h170UMkECV

1327297207683473408 2020-11-14 01:08:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It all started in the Bush era, you know those two wonder people passing off as republicans but who in fact are staunch globalists.
1327296761854124032 2020-11-14 01:06:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ceefax2 No doubt and God knows how much its going to be. Betrayal of a country and people can't be cheap.
1327296539652448259 2020-11-14 01:05:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Eddy65 @Ella32823623 Too complicated for me. For years our people have always taken the easy route with their thinking which is why so many are so dumb. If you are the sort of person who thinks Boris pissing on the lawn is only watering it then nothing will change you.
1327233808098340866 2020-11-13 20:56:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Eddy65 @Ella32823623 For years they were right. Am I to believe that because you are an adorer of Johnson that we should now disregard them entirely. But yes I believed the twitter poll. 800 answered and 76% thought he was crap. Which part of the poll do you doubt?
1327231854324412416 2020-11-13 20:48:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Here is the proof for those who don't believe. . . . . https://t.co/e9k0DMsooS
1327231295244656641 2020-11-13 20:46:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In a recent twitter poll 76% of people said they were not satisfied or confident with Johnson's leadership. His key people have handed in their notice, in one case Claiming Johnson's "wife" had been interfering &amp; pissing him off. So now we know the real problem. . . . . . . !!!
1326988199198142477 2020-11-13 04:40:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Gove hints 'movement' from EU could be coming as Brexit deal on brink.  Cynical ?

1326854967873953792 2020-11-12 19:50:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @brexitjoker I did the same a month ago. Writing them letters making clear the peoples unhappiness with the tory direction but as usual . . . . . . ignored so I tore up the card and saved a little money.
1326854560544075777 2020-11-12 19:49:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Smallism_org That's like saying I have anthrax but it could be worse, I could have cancer. You're justifying a dreadful performance by pulling it into the gutter with everything else where it compares more favourably.

1326831295859716096 2020-11-12 18:16:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Unbelievable ! Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has sent a Cease and Desist Order to Journalist Demanding He Erase His #DetroitLeaks Video Showing Voter Fraud Training -- OR FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.  Impressive, in the USA the legal system is used to prevent the truth !
1326825375700307969 2020-11-12 17:53:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Our political system is now so corrupt and crass that people are no longer interested in it. As a result they move further away from influencing parliament and parliament moves further away from the people carrying on harvesting for themselves everything it can get its hands on.
1326824939601731584 2020-11-12 17:51:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> We moan &amp; moan &amp; moan but we get everything we deserve because we do nothing to stop it. We are not the empire builders we once were. I recently tweeted that I did not like Islam &amp; 20 of the people who read the tweet reported themselves to the police begging not to be arrested.
1326823934428401670 2020-11-12 17:47:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SJE15315952 Agree entirely SJE. I think he has long since moved into someone's pockets. He ignores riots, he ignores police brutality, he ignores illegal migrants and he's now furiously kissing the arse of a person who's not yet even be declared president. We so desperately need change.
1326821857031491585 2020-11-12 17:39:16 +0800 <Jonteinspain> We're in control ? . . . bollox. It's YOU with the chronic left wing political bias, its YOU doing all the censoring, it's YOU doing all the harassing, It's YOU stamping on the 1st. No, its YOU in control but hopefully not for much longer.  https://t.co/YxxocUGQTe
1326568629807276035 2020-11-12 00:53:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @LifesHallusions @UkFreemind I assure you, you'll have the answers long before then.
1326568479466655746 2020-11-12 00:52:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @robertM47247048 Excellent. He's about to sell our out our coastal waters to the EU, you can email him and tell him what a good job he's done. Suggest you don't stand right behind him as you say, the way he's crapping himself it could be nasty. He's already kissing Bidens corrupt arse.
1326567722596114433 2020-11-12 00:49:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @shelljust12 Your argument is spurious. Instead of demanding better you're mumbling things could be worse. We don't have Corbyn/Starmer so this is irrelevant. We have Johnson and he is falling apart. Best reach for the stars, not be grateful we're not going down the drain.
1326566130522218504 2020-11-12 00:43:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If these 100 metre trawlers of the EU continue decimating our waters there won't be any fish left in them to negotiate about. Of course, Johnson won't do anything about that as he won't do anything about ritual slaughter, child grooming &amp; rape, illegal migrants &amp; riots etc etc !
1326565337123479552 2020-11-12 00:39:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Johnson is weak &amp; worse, according to a poll on twitter today 85% of people think he is. Anytime now we are going to see a massive con over fisheries, he's beaten &amp; what he will do is allow things to carry on as they are &amp; tell us its so he can negotiate. Bollox. he's beaten.
1326474179349245958 2020-11-11 18:37:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @BigGoddy2001 It won't make any difference Victor. We are rapidly heading for government by decree. This is evidenced the way the police are now openly manhandling dissenters, even or especially the aged. Riots are being ignored so that brutality can eventually be used to deal with dissent.
1326473650938269699 2020-11-11 18:35:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If Biden gets in you won't have time to catch your breath before his sponsors push him into yet another American caused Middle East war in order to create floods of refugees heading for all points in the western world. Just as Soros and co want.
1326472501023617024 2020-11-11 18:31:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Reannjenkins @amMitchellAllen It's unlikely that these people would notice if a family member had been brain damaged.
1326472249663172609 2020-11-11 18:30:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @cyptoon Yes, a lot of sense in what you say but you are being somewhat naïve. The elite tell us the world's populations should be preferably 1.1 billion. The elite control everything. The covid virus seems to be an enormous coincidence &amp; points to it being choreographed. Why ?
1326461783725445120 2020-11-11 17:48:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In an ongoing twitter poll which asks people if they are satisfied with his premiership 84.5% of people say they are not.   Troubling, isn't it.

1326459800495009792 2020-11-11 17:40:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Quick question, simple answer.  Are you confident with Boris Johnson's premiership ?
1326458732319010816 2020-11-11 17:36:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Sorry, I said Boris - I meant Donald.
1326458073121222664 2020-11-11 17:33:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @petergabscar With Johnson and Patel it really is a case of after all is said and done and the huffing, puffing and spluttering is over, that everything has been said and nothing has been done. Well not strictly true, we have even more illegals now and many more each day.
1326456842860556288 2020-11-11 17:28:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @RenweardPress @indymeansindy @moor_george Skin colour never interested me until BLM came along and then in a remarkable short period of time it did.   Black lives matter. If you say so, now away and riot.
1326455835548069888 2020-11-11 17:24:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Metzyco1 @indymeansindy Black is not a colour. Its the absence of colour. . . . . .Thought I'd mention it.
1326455409889185792 2020-11-11 17:23:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The result of the race for presidency is not even in yet and it looks as if the courts are going to be tied up for quite some time sorting it but Johnson has already stabbed Boris in the back and is sucking up to Biden. Perhaps he wants his hair sniffed. Goodbye independence.

1326093646383509505 2020-11-10 17:25:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> By the time Biden and his crooks have finished with the USA they'll be wishing they'd paid the tea tax. Get ready for more middle east wars with refugees being driven to the USA, Europe, Australia and all because the elite can make more money from globalism.
1326093076234973190 2020-11-10 17:23:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Its beyond me &amp; serves to show how simple people are. On December 16th 1773 Americans objected to paying tax on tea to the British crown so they went to war for their independence. Today a corrupt MSM, judiciary &amp; political system decimate the USA &amp; no one does anything.
1325976961936711685 2020-11-10 09:41:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Boris Johnson promised the UK will be at the 'front of the pack' for the new coronavirus vaccine tonight after the massive breakthrough.  Isn't he the guy bullshitting our fishermen, our electorate, our country and screwing up brexit?
1325976563221983232 2020-11-10 09:40:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The husband and wife behind covid vaccine that could change the world   We are told that the virus has mutated into something else so what use is a vaccine developed for a different virus?

1325894456567066632 2020-11-10 04:14:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Well, I backed president Trump to win and it may well be that I've sent a couple of hundred down the drain so today I phoned my bookie and asked for odds on Boris Johnson selling us out on fisheries. He said, don't be a dickhead, of course he will, no one will take that bet.

1325867588874866695 2020-11-10 02:27:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I have little interest in politics or politicians but I cling to the hope that democracy can protect us from the bad ones but this US election has shown just how easy and just how much corruption there is in voting. this election should be declared void before real trouble begins
1325521704303669248 2020-11-09 03:32:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> To support these organisations is lunacy. Talk about turkeys voting for Christmas . . . . . What facebook and twitter are doing is corrupting the right to speak freely for left wing political reasons. All of the elite want communism. They benefit from it enormously.
1325520950163595264 2020-11-09 03:29:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> A number of social media messages posted by President Donald Trump in recent days—namely those about the election results, problems and irregularities with vote counting, election observation, and lawsuits filed—have been censored by Twitter and Facebook restricting free speech.

Not so good when dealing with rioters but quick in running away from them. They can be at Watford Gap from London in 20 minutes if trouble starts. Tories!
1324315018154958849 2020-11-05 19:37:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ForteanTalks I'd like to see reform replace the tory party. I have been a tory all of my adult life but what we have now is not what I understand as conservative. To me it seems to be way out on the left and lying as much as the left does. The system stinks and is poisoning all of us.

What pain they face.
1324289020076183552 2020-11-05 17:54:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If Johnson screws up on Brexit the country should have the right to vote again. If they agree with what he has done he will be re-elected, if they don't someone who can give the electorate what they want will be elected. I suspect illegal migrants will not appear in any manifesto

Your remarks are so naïve as to be embarrassing. Land of the free. . . .freedom to riot and drag people out of cars and beat shit out of them etc. Those freedoms we can do without.
1324079889314709504 2020-11-05 04:03:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Each year Flu kills 11,000 people in the UK. So far this year Covid has killed 47,750 and even if this figure is loaded its still a horrible lot of death. People who refuse to co-operate with the authorities must be dealt with severely. Its not only themselves they are killing.

1324021833750978562 2020-11-05 00:12:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Celticblood1959 Frankly after what Britain has suffered over the past 10 years I honestly think a dictator would be infinitely preferable to what we have to accept as government. They say the best form of government is a benevolent dictator. . . . .
1324021456041398272 2020-11-05 00:11:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @RFCGW That's why we have to change it. It's utterly corrupt and run for the benefit of those running it. Like the USA which is now going to change rapidly and drastically, so too must the UK. Common purpose, political correctness, a police force which manhandles OAP's all need sorting.
1324019889145892864 2020-11-05 00:05:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @trumpteam01 Decent Americans have now had it proved to them that without dealing with this left wing filth they face great dangers. If Biden was established as president within four years most Americans would have little or even less. They are fighters and will now fight.
1324019560614371328 2020-11-05 00:03:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @TyburnMartyrs GT is far too good for the scum who have perpetrated this outrage. Together with Pelosi, the msm, much of the social media and other traitors they should be lined up against a wall and waved goodbye. . . . . P.S. They can put harry with them.
1324018905585717251 2020-11-05 00:01:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @allrightblog Its treason and capital punishment is appropriate and called for. Those responsible for this massive, grotesque fraud must be punished and seen to be punished so that it never happens again.
1324018600328548356 2020-11-05 00:00:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @charlesfeb08 Yes but remember Charles, if you can't beat them you don't have to join them. However, I think this indicates just how much danger we all are in and I think now we will beat them. First the USA then we start to purge the UK of the same crap.
1324018276951904261 2020-11-04 23:58:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @crazykiwi007 Kind of you to say so Dean
1324000684883271688 2020-11-04 22:48:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If this outrage in the USA doesn't knock the world far to the right, we'd better prepare ourselves for a painful new world order.
1324000429060038657 2020-11-04 22:47:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @trumpteam01 Its hard to believe that people like Pelosi just don't think they have enough money without globalism. Why do the American people put up with her and those like her? She is an evil which needs dealing with. American is not worthy of this type of treatment by the left.
1323999942613020678 2020-11-04 22:45:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Lostboyjojo Yes, that is still the case and there are a lot of them.
1323997314885820419 2020-11-04 22:35:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ElContador2000
1323997137194147842 2020-11-04 22:34:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> This is exciting isn't it. Our 5th in line to the throne is in the USA trying to get Biden elected president. He can't be thick enough not to know what is going on - his pussy whipper will have briefed him but this is no way for our royalty to act against the USA &amp; her people.
1323996084994220034 2020-11-04 22:30:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I wonder if or how Soros is involved with the fight against Trump.
1323995952387133444 2020-11-04 22:30:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Every person involved with suspending voting, corrupting results or attempting in anyway at all to defraud the result of the American election should be immediately arrested, imprisoned and held there until the absolute truth is known and can be dealt with.
1323995531543273479 2020-11-04 22:28:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> As you go about your daily, occasional use of twitter and facebook bear in mind that they support the left wing evil which now has been launched against the people of the USA and support what its agenda is. An agenda which benefits no one but themselves.
1323981341046747136 2020-11-04 21:32:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> How can a country at such a state of development as the USA, with a might constitution to protect it ever have gotten to the state where a few political elite can make it look like a third world country ? Those responsible need to be put up against that wall. . . . .
1323980066435596289 2020-11-04 21:27:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Trump almost did make America great again but the democrats, msm &amp; the morons they have brainwashed obstructed him at every move, even trying to impeach him after failed accusations over Russia &amp; many other things had failed. This time he needs to put the boot in and sort it out.
1323979137699205121 2020-11-04 21:23:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> American media is rotten and ours is not much better. Look at any of our media . . . . are any attempting to explain what has gone on ? Are they hell. The BBC has once again called in counsellors because the news room has fallen apart in the belief that Trump will get in.
1323976127459827719 2020-11-04 21:11:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AuntieKikiB Not true. Read what those close to him are writing. You can't deny something just because you don't think its true. Get proof.
1323974998382518275 2020-11-04 21:06:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In the USA there has been a complete and utter breakdown of discipline. People do what they want with impunity and fear nothing because there is little or no punishment for lawbreaking or outrageous behaviour.   And here in the UK its the same.
1323974338010374145 2020-11-04 21:04:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> America cannot allow this degree of corruption to go on and the first thing Donald Trump must do is take action to ensure this does not happen again. People must be sought out and punished and here in the UK we need to do the same thing to those people who are emulating the USA.
1323972503878930432 2020-11-04 20:56:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think the American people need to prepare for a civil war. An evil not seen before has descended on their country and decent people are not going to take more of the privileged elite sponsoring riots and trouble in order to create political advantages for the left.
1323970483751129089 2020-11-04 20:48:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The USA is undergoing a coup d'etat in a desperate bid to defeat Trump and bring in globalism (marxism). If it succeeds the world will be the place for their next coup. We are all in great danger now.   If/when Trump wins he needs to destroy this corruption organised by the left.
1323969451168010241 2020-11-04 20:44:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> How does a country as advanced &amp; "civilised" as the USA stop voting in an area because Biden wasn't getting enough votes. What law allows a voting centre to be shut down? This is crazy.   And Johnson wants Biden to be elected. Time for Johnson to go. Replace him with Rishi Sunak.
1323968732700512256 2020-11-04 20:41:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Now it will be Friday before the votes are counted in the USA. I wonder what the democrat filth will be able to get up to in this time? This election is ridiculous and should be declared void even tho' Trump seems to have won before the tampering started.
1323967580147716098 2020-11-04 20:37:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Johnson has already mentioned the "great reset" so its obvious where his politics lay. He is no more a tory than the majority of the tory party who all seem to be globalists waiting for the great reset. People need to act now, there's not much hope when our leaders are corrupt.
1323966466966933504 2020-11-04 20:32:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The dreadful cheating in the US election is horrifying. When Trump was winning in a state they stopped people from voting knowing that they could introduce postal votes. There should be long jail sentences for this and the USA needs to deal with the left before there is no USA.
1323947116906139648 2020-11-04 19:16:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Still, I've been wondering how he benefits from riots, the police harassing OAP's pregnant women, Dover ferries not able to operate because the sea is clogged with illegal immigrants and how he is going to cope when finally he admits he has fallen over re the EU.
1323946634259083264 2020-11-04 19:14:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Boris Johnson 'desperate for Donald Trump to LOSE' in US election bombshell   If this proved beyond a reasonable doubt I'd tear up my card. Most tories are reasonably intelligent &amp; want to see a safe US government. I wonder how Johnson benefits by Biden?   https://t.co/yZiv09S3XK
1323945882325291010 2020-11-04 19:11:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> BBC US Election 'bias' sparks Twitter meltdown as viewers call out 'Pro-Biden' coverage   I am absolutely sick of the BBC and even more sick of that unkempt blonde arse who hardly ever combs his hair, calls himself PM and allows this to continue.

1323699664588328964 2020-11-04 02:52:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> How can we live with Islam when Muslims want nothing to do with us, don't want to integrate and are as different to us as is chalk and cheese. Its stupid. Only government seems to think its a good idea and they have been wrong too many times.
1323699304813547521 2020-11-04 02:51:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @charlesfeb08 This shit has gone on for too long &amp; now needs dealing with. If a dog bites you twice its destroyed &amp; the breed registered as dangerous. If a muslim kills someone in the name of Islam fuck all happens. I want a government which accepts Islam does not sit comfortably in the west.
1323693034140291072 2020-11-04 02:26:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Yet again Islam has accepted responsibility for the murders in Europe. How long is this religion going to be treated as if its something which really does benefit us all instead of killing us at a moments notice for daring to say something it doesn't like.   Ban it.

However, over the years he has talked some pretty wonderful fights but when push came to shove seemed to go soft rather quickly. Prove you are up to it Nigel and people will this time back you but won't if you don't.

He's been got at and subjected to enormous pressure. Probably a numbered offshore bank account with an amount known to crush patriotism, principle and honesty. It's quite common in politics you know. . . . . !!!
1323589995681271812 2020-11-03 19:37:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Look at the spectacular cost of illegal immigrants. If the same amount of money or even less was spent in making conditions in their own countries better they wouldn't come here. But they do come here and are coming in ever greater quantities which of course is Patel's intention.

1323585550746587136 2020-11-03 19:19:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I am at a loss to see how we can move forward with the government we have or could have if it changed. Government in the UK is nothing but a means of the elite making fortunes &amp; they don't care that we know. We need to trash this political system and come up with one that works.

1323580622317772800 2020-11-03 18:59:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson Farage knows Johnson is going to betray brexit which is why he is launching brexit again although under a more appropriate name now. Fishing grounds - Our fishing grounds are going to be given away by Johnson and no doubt State aid will be dropped. Its crap.
1323580024205856770 2020-11-03 18:57:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If Johnson proves that he is and has been nothing more than a closet remainer and betrays our fishermen, allowing the EU to continue plundering our diminishing fish stocks with their 100 metre trawlers then each and everyone of us should sign up with Farage.
1323577243596185600 2020-11-03 18:46:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Getting fed up with government by decree - everything backed up by a not very bright police force. If you are shot through the head ten times, they will test you for Covid. If found, Covid is what it will say on your death certificate. Nobody believes Johnson, including the EU.
1323576297952579584 2020-11-03 18:42:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Borisjohnsona  99.9% recovery rate ! FFS flu is worse, smoking kills 300k per annum. . . .come clean what's this crap all about?

1323360394962939904 2020-11-03 04:24:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I can't see the problem Johnson is having with Covid. If the people don't want to lockdown warn them of the consequences and then let them get on with it. Whatever he does he can't win so let people learn the hard way.
1323359985070465024 2020-11-03 04:23:01 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It's a dreadful situation when the previous leader of the labour party can be kicked out of the party but nowhere near as dreadful as ever having had the job in the first place. Clearly he was racist, supported some very strange people and had some weird shadow cabinet ministers.

1323314188131966976 2020-11-03 01:21:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Well done Mr Johnson. Tremendous progress. You've thrown away our fish, next will be state aid, then it will be control by the ECHR and in the meantime the lying about covid will continue as will the constant arrival of illegals. You've thrown it away.  .  https://t.co/Mu9vFKXpUY
1323309294620737536 2020-11-03 01:01:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Even if Trump gets elected it will make little difference. From an impressive height the blonde buffoon has crapped all over us yet again. Hammered by Macron, shit scared out of him by the EU his principles &amp; patriotism were finally defeated by huge bungs in numbered accounts.
1323308364642791425 2020-11-03 00:57:54 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Now Johnson has given in on illegal migrants &amp; fishing, I guess state aid will be the next capitulation and following that the ECHR. It's just like the clever people said, his deal will be Mays deal. All his hot air was just to get him the PM's job which attracts the best bungs.
1323307388917714947 2020-11-03 00:54:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> As most knew would be the case Johnson has just gone tits up on fishing. He's being clever tho'. He intends to allow the EU to carry on plundering our waters with their 100 metre boats and not come up with a deal. Farage is on the move again &amp; this time I really am with him.
1323221972755644417 2020-11-02 19:14:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Why is  Johnson so quiet about the pussy whipped harry ? Its government who can remove his title not the queen. Perhaps if he eased off a couple of minutes on importing illegal migrants he could comment. We have a right to know what government thinks &amp; intends to do.
1323221081642197000 2020-11-02 19:11:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Rachelm42100756 I'm happy for the queen to end her reign but based on the conduct of some of the royals over the years would be even happier to see royalty abandoned in favour of a republic. Harry proves they are really nothing more or less than privileged parasites of varying degree.
1323219596350992386 2020-11-02 19:05:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @wellynelly6 He has but to give political support to a person who will harm the UK and who is also suffering from something which makes him unfit for office defies belief. He is treacherous and has a rotten judgement.
1323219031915175939 2020-11-02 19:02:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Further, perhaps it would help a little if his honesty at Uni where he was accused of cheating was made known.   This is the pussy whippee who tells us we need to wake up. We do and should kick his twisted, treacherous arse out of the UK.
1323218338538049537 2020-11-02 19:00:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Years ago when I swore an oath of allegiance to HM the Queen, her heirs and successors I knew nothing about the little shit harry. Siding with Biden, who supports the EU &amp; dislikes the UK he is actively trying to harm us. His title should be trashed together with his passport.
1323217327966572544 2020-11-02 18:56:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Knowing that Biden would hurt Britain &amp; probably deny us a trade deal the pussy whipped, snot gobbling, harry, who once wore our uniform, has now openly suggested the American people vote for Him. As one commentator said, that's about as useful as the iceberg was to the Titanic.
1323111873785569280 2020-11-02 11:57:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Dantomlom2 @Nigel_Farage It probably won't. The banks do no one favours but themselves and yet people deal with them because the system is set up so they have to. Overdraw by a pound and a letter is written to you saying you have been charged £35. A letter written automatically by a computer . . . . . .

That's not the American way either.

Everything they do is concerned with their own interests despite the fact that their duties lay with the hundreds of thousands of citizens who support them. If Trump is elected I sincerely hope he punishes them. They can't go on like they are.
1323104054411755520 2020-11-02 11:26:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> This is what decent people in America are having to  deal with.  https://t.co/20o7iMy9vU Hopefully Trump will get in and this time deal with these evil troublemakers. They don't only affect the USA but morons in other countries copy them.

Clearly its bullshit and clearly, we have paid more than enough to the EU over the `past 12 months. We are going to be betrayed on everything, are we to lose a small fortune as well ???
1322979370579972097 2020-11-02 03:10:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The two best hopes are Minoxidil (Rogaine).

Both can take months to show they are doing anything, if anything at all.

1322876542465282049 2020-11-01 20:22:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Of course, in fairness this all started as a means of generating trouble in the USA by the democrats and will no doubt intensify if or when Trump is re-elected only this time he will deal with it as it should be dealt with.
1322875970899058689 2020-11-01 20:19:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If anything has done untold damage to race relations its BLM. People are looking at their conduct and the conduct of those they purport to represent and are starting to feel they would be better off without them. It's a very valid point of view.
1322874856908722177 2020-11-01 20:15:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If you want to avoid the restrictions brought about by covid get a rubber boat and enter Britain illegally. You won't be locked down, denied entry and can pray in the streets as you require. And you are paid for all of it which is why everyone is coming here.

Its not difficult to understand why, part of the great reset goes back years and consists of teaching people that wrong is absolutely right and government constantly demonstrating this is so.

1322500266965508096 2020-10-31 19:26:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Best thing for Britain's fishing waters would be a no deal. Currently they are being plundered in a dreadful way. Even areas which have been agreed for  conservation are being trawled by huge EU fishing boats. The EU fishing policy does nothing but allow unsustainable trawling.

1322487340498079745 2020-10-31 18:35:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> As the effect of Covid rapidly increases government is scared witless to do what is necessary because anything it does is criticised &amp; as in all similar cases they put off doing anything. It seems people don't want lockdown. So be it. Have covid instead but don't whine about it.

1322476718838394883 2020-10-31 17:53:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If every time a government lied it lost office it would soon stop lying. The problem we have with government is we let them lie to us and don't punish them and until we do they will never stop. Lying is easier than doing the job and telling the truth.

1321776093859352576 2020-10-29 19:29:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Go back to the start of the Russian revolution. . . .Do we really have to wait that long and let things get so bad before the elite are put firmly in their place? Already we're seeing government by decree. The longer its left the more there is to put right.
1321773603147403264 2020-10-29 19:19:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The fish are ours and the right to give state aid must be ours. Neither should be open for discussion. I'll warrant the blonde buffoon of "no comb" fame sells us out on everything.
1321772944440369152 2020-10-29 19:16:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In just about every aspect of life bigger is better and yet Blair fractionated the UK because he thought there was votes in it for him. All he did was screw up the system as only a socialist could. Mind you, he did manage to get 400 of our soldiers killed in his illegal war.
1321744889047121922 2020-10-29 17:25:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Talks with the EU have gone down to the wire and now we are about to see what this once proud independent country has tied itself to, because it most certainly will have. Fishing sold out, State aid sold out. Just wait. . . . .
1321743890429431808 2020-10-29 17:21:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Getting weary of hearing people demand government take responsibility for their children as they grind their cigarettes out on the carpet and order another pint. They should be careful what they wish for.
1321523796394823680 2020-10-29 02:46:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> As everyone and their dog knew. There will be an agreement with the EU. It almost certainly will not be worth having as far as Britain is concerned and will prove nothing other than 12 months of bullshit and deception. And the illegal migrants will continue to pour into the UK !
1321522460882309121 2020-10-29 02:41:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Brexit deal just ONE WEEK away from being reached as UK and EU negotiators make progress   After 12 months of negotiations &amp; tough talk a deal was simple. All Boris had to do was give in on fisheries, state aid, sell N.I. down the drain &amp; give the EU everything they wanted.
1321521426483085312 2020-10-29 02:37:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Brexit deal just ONE WEEK away from being reached as UK and EU negotiators make progress   Oh I can't wait for this. I wonder how they are going to sell this as not being a sell out or surrender.    https://t.co/MeHlsegFJC
1321520758925991937 2020-10-29 02:34:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It is my fervent hope that those organising the world at the moment understand that when they have failed in their globalist agenda, the people will then look to them for retribution and there will be no defence in saying George Soros ordered me to. . . . . . . . . . !!!
1321519242160779265 2020-10-29 02:28:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Hasn't devolution been a disaster and poor, dreadfully poor idea. Before every square foot of land in the UK was represented by an elected representative who could be found in Westminster. Today Scotland and Wales duplicate everything at phenomenal expense and achieve nothing.
1321518118313828354 2020-10-29 02:24:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Mardoqu12884145 I think its now had its name changed yet again, this time to the great or the big reset.
1321511439497154561 2020-10-29 01:57:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Government by decree has to happen. MP's, the courts, the house of Lords have made government almost impossible. Anything an elected government do can be obstructed by a dozen different methods and organisations. Dictatorship is perhaps our last hope !!!
1321510382985465856 2020-10-29 01:53:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @paddyjack I would guess, in various forms its existed for years, regularly changing its name so it would be difficult to organise against it.
1321510114990395396 2020-10-29 01:52:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SteveDa15434515 How the f*ck did you get to the moon . . . . .
1321509262644940800 2020-10-29 01:48:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I got blocked for 12 hours yesterday for tweeting a Biden video about the truth. This time I'm tweeting a video which is nothing but obvious, respectable, good humour.    https://t.co/1WTxN6xoAb
1321505037579935754 2020-10-29 01:32:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> First it was wars in the middle east. Next was muslim refugees overwhelming Europe and the western world. Then the world lost the right to speak freely. The worlds media then censored everything. Then we had Covid and now we have government by decree. Its very, very bad.
1321503394033532933 2020-10-29 01:25:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Companies in the world are now far too big. They have the same power and wealth as governments &amp; use it in the same way. Apple is larger than the combined top 100 FTSE companies &amp; not concerned with governments. The top largest companies need breaking down. They are too powerful.
1321481723952140289 2020-10-28 23:59:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> However, after a few years people will realise how evil and rotten it is and as always in such circumstances, will do what they should have done before it arrived, which is fight it.
1321481362688397314 2020-10-28 23:58:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Most people know that something dreadful is happening in the world and have a good idea who is making it happen and why. Globalism is the enemy and it looks as if it can now not be prevented. The big reset has arrived and we've left it too late to do anything about it.
1321480894050410499 2020-10-28 23:56:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Perramas1337 No. I wish you were right but the left have played a vital roll in giving the elite a globalist world. If Trump is defeated we're all in trouble, including the left who don't realise what they have done &amp; how they have been so cruelly used. From now on its all down hill.
1321479094253604870 2020-10-28 23:49:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @irelandbirds1 They need to be run out of the world. I would like to suggest they be lined up against a wall and shot but if I suggested that I would be severely punished because twitter are in charge of what the world says. Or it thinks it is.
1321478386821324800 2020-10-28 23:46:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @dancingshoes06 Had I had more space I would have gone on to talk about brain damage but I know you would find it boring so I won't bother. Look what happened to Michael Schumacher and he was protected. . . .
1321477751216443392 2020-10-28 23:43:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @dancingshoes06 I don't begin to understand you. As an ex hospital director I saw more than enough children with head wounds, many of which would have been prevented with the appropriate protection. Still, can't have the girl looking a "div" can we. Fractured skulls need not be fatal.
1321419965250129925 2020-10-28 19:54:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I forwarded a video of Bi d en yesterday. Within 4 minutes I had my account locked for 12 hours and they would only open it if I forewent my right to appeal (appeal - would anyone be so stupid)  and deleted the video. I note scathing videos of Trump abound. Things grow worse.
1321190009714679809 2020-10-28 04:40:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Prince Harry told to 'get back over to UK' and stop 'lecturing from million-pound mansion'   He's made such a fool of royalty that little is left other than to continue the move into the 21st century &amp; abolish it. I suggest we wait until the queen passes &amp; then become a republic.
1321188755072602113 2020-10-28 04:35:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Should Boris Johnson pull out of EU trade talks tomorrow?  https://t.co/TOycLA3yyb
1321159002315759616 2020-10-28 02:37:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @colking I don't begin to understand you. Nothing could be further from socialism than I am. I thought Maggie Thatcher was left wing. . . . I would say I, in common with many others are no longer conservative but very much right wing. Something better and more honest will soon be along.
1321158075940831232 2020-10-28 02:33:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MrSugden2 I can remember the start of twitter which was even worse. We only had 2 lines of text with which to hold an intelligent conversation. Once the numbers were there it got sorted out &amp; Parler will be the same. Its wrong to support twitter. Its shooting yourself in the head and foot.
1321156955683999744 2020-10-28 02:28:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @rustilicus @JoeBiden No thank you, I think he will win and when he does watch America become a third world country in no time at all. China will crap all over her, as will Russia and Iran and those idiots who voted for Biden will say Dear god what have we done but by then questions will be too late.
1321155620859498498 2020-10-28 02:23:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Just seen a video about the Biden family. Surely people are not going to let this filth into the white house. Has America gone mad. Have they all be bought off. I'm having trouble forwarding it but will as soon as I have found a good copy.
1321099441361866753 2020-10-27 22:40:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @colking No I am right of centre but don't respond well to lies, deception, broken promises and bullshit coming from the party I once supported.
1321098845556740098 2020-10-27 22:38:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @charlesfeb08 It is lumpy but its growing too quick. They can't stop to take it down so as to be able to expand it. Apparently they are working on it.
1321098591990140934 2020-10-27 22:37:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @nicolastein56 Couldn't agree more. The way twitter patronises its members defies belief. They have about as much chance of keeping their business as a publican would if he was pissing in the beer. Sooner it fails the better.
1321097357069606914 2020-10-27 22:32:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JoeBiden In the unlikely event that you win will you be able to remember where you have to go ?
1321097159601774592 2020-10-27 22:31:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @dancingshoes06 Reminds me of my ex wife with the army. . . .

1321055141253042176 2020-10-27 19:44:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Brexit: Boris shamed over ‘U-turn’ as Leaver vows to fight ‘unacceptable’ decision   An absolute outrage from this blonde arse. Did he ask the country what they thought? Did he hell. This U turn is something which has done no one any good at all. apart from Boris Johnson.
1321054633964589057 2020-10-27 19:42:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Brexit LIVE: Boris given days to secure 'our laws, borders, cash and fish' or lose No10   What a stupid thing to say. He's got another 4 years to bullshit the morons into voting for him and in four years time he will have made his fortune.     https://t.co/MVJ4O4qyNH
1321047484563677184 2020-10-27 19:13:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Ella32823623 The big money now seems to be on the rambling Biden but pray God this is wrong. I can't believe a whole damned country is going to commit suicide.
1321046980798328832 2020-10-27 19:11:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Alfiebengal Sorry. So easy to misspell a word with two meanings and so little reason to care about it . . . . . .
1321046636542464006 2020-10-27 19:10:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> We are getting very close to our betrayal by Johnson. We've had plenty of bullshit which has given patriots hope but I suspect when the truth is out Johnson will have signed Mays agreement with just 1 or 2 minor alterations. Brexit was never more than a way of getting into No 10.
1321044318505865217 2020-10-27 19:01:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Woman goes to the hairdresser for a hair-do. How would you like it the hairdresser asked ? I'd like it just like Barbara Streisand please she said:  So the hairdresser smacked her across the nose five times with a hairbrush and hoiked a bucket of water on her . . . .
1321029872089735169 2020-10-27 18:03:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I mentioned earlier I had called into twitter. . . .Imagine how surprised I was to find there was a contender for president in the USA election called Donal Trump. Not a sign of him on twitter. Perhaps he's been banned like almost everyone else.
1321029321419558912 2020-10-27 18:01:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Called in on Parler today. Surprised &amp; delighted to find that many of the top tweeters banned by twitter are now well established there. System is a bit lumpy but will get better quickly no doubt. Tremendous difference in tweets. No one frightened. the truth is oozing everywhere.
1321027663436402689 2020-10-27 17:55:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MrAndyNgo Why shouldn't they run away. they're probably banned from defending themselves. . . . . .
1321026103813804032 2020-10-27 17:49:01 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @rural_veteran Grow plants in it.
1321025137311916033 2020-10-27 17:45:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Biden has proven now beyond shadow of a doubt that he is not fit to be president. His thought processes are all over the place. However, the democrats have never intended him to be president. Its his running mate we'll see in the white house throwing open the boarders. .
1321024391124275202 2020-10-27 17:42:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @newportstocks @ErrolWebber The update is interesting. It explains how it can be reused. . . . .
1321023596077207553 2020-10-27 17:39:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Belagana2 The experts say I am a danger to others if I am not wearing a face mask, so as much as I dislike them, I'll suffer them if it means others may be spared this vile type of flu. I hope others will do the same for me. . . . .
1321022950456307713 2020-10-27 17:36:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @LyleJohnston For me it was puddles . . . . . Often found one much deeper than anticipated.
1321022789143404549 2020-10-27 17:35:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Rachelleyelly They study it at school. In itself this is not too much of a problem but the real difficulty arises when you find their i.q. is less than their shoe size. God puts them on the earth so the labour party can have members.
1320874581708726272 2020-10-27 07:46:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @stevieinselby @HelenTBracken Good God above. The EU is coming apart at the seems &amp; you say its grown stronger. Its almost broke and only keeps going because the city of London is able to arrange stupendous loans for them. I have not been aware of the EU demise being predicted for more than the past 3 years.
1320873643140878336 2020-10-27 07:43:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @tarisgal42 @NJ_Timothy I see no connection whatsoever between brexit and the  ramblings of an ignorant woman or rather two ignorant woman.
1320871451919060992 2020-10-27 07:34:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Abolish the House of Lords! Unelected peers to unite with 'undemocratic EU' in Brexit plot   The electorate is has on numerous occasions indicated its desire to see the house of lords abolished but government has as always, ignored the people. They do so now at their own peril.

1320826704869396482 2020-10-27 04:36:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Brexit talks 'on knife edge' over French fishermen plot to blockade access to EU waters    You don't negotiate with people who threaten you. You smack them in the teeth. French threats can't be taken seriously. They don't have a bite. They don't even have a nasty suck.
1320819384148021248 2020-10-27 04:07:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @tomgordon58 Castrated would seem to be a better description.

1320818414949191685 2020-10-27 04:03:44 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It's incredible. This over privileged, thick, patronising, pussy whipped moron with no experience of hardship or difficulty is lecturing our people. He really must be thick not to see what he is doing to himself.
1320817784654319617 2020-10-27 04:01:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @totoschilacky @HillaryClinton I can't see it. The US judicial system seems to be utterly corrupt and controlled by the democrats. Nothing could be more worse for the country.
1320790683905646592 2020-10-27 02:13:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If government can throw away billions dealing with Covid, how about a few quid spent on dealing with asylum hearings. The sooner these conmen are out of Britain the better for us and the sooner we stop wasting money. The time taken dealing with asylum hearings is ludicrous.
1320788265327300609 2020-10-27 02:03:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MrAndyNgo Stupid creature. His testicles were far too big. However, Trudeau is not likely to let that stand in the way of humiliating Canada.

1320787512911081473 2020-10-27 02:00:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Isn't government a little suspicious that people coming hear in fear of their lives and begging for asylum seem to get into all sorts of problems which require the police to sort out. These asylum seekers are piss taking &amp; as you would imagine, our government is fooled.

1320784553192148993 2020-10-27 01:49:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Social media is out of control. In some ways it has more power than the state &amp; that is not good. Its able to influence &amp; confuse easily just by editing &amp; censoring &amp; its doing just this for the democrats. Social media should be trashed &amp; licensed to be neutral &amp; without bias.

1320783438421594112 2020-10-27 01:44:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AlexRei20105871 I think the primary reason is the lack of proof based on anything more than a 5 year olds reckoning. The immune system is ordinarily extremely strong and even were it possible to affect it this way it would take a hell of a long time.
1320782767198818310 2020-10-27 01:42:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Having now seen some of Biden's videos, if that absent minded idiot beats Trump then accept once and for all the power of cheating. Who in their right mind could put him in office?

1320728493362159616 2020-10-26 22:06:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @naughtynoonoo48 @Femail I tell you now, it takes a lot of money to maintain a weight of 25 stone. It doesn't matter what you eat but if you eat more than you need to exist, the difference is stored as fat.
1320727771283394560 2020-10-26 22:03:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @mn_ke_rry Seems to me he was aware of jack shit until he started humping one. There are claims he cheated at Uni and had to be helped through his finals and other claims that he was not competent enough as an apache pilot to be given a command. Not only that, he kept falling off his bike !

1320723122375610369 2020-10-26 21:45:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @cat_voltaire @toddytime2 Utter bullshit and something to expect from her. All significant research into this crap has shown halal slaughter not only to be painful but cruel.
1320708152501899266 2020-10-26 20:45:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> To say such a thing the man must be clearly desperate for publicity or stupid. He didn't know he was a racist until he started humping a coloured lady who "opened his eyes". What a dreadful thing to say. The royal family need to get their act together and sort him out quickly.
1320706460851052547 2020-10-26 20:38:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Harry admitting he's a racist and blaming his parents and upbringing is incredible. This surely has to be the last nail in the coffin of these hanger ons !

It's been holed and is now sinking quite quickly. You can't give great privilege to this behaviour.

1320352028690886658 2020-10-25 21:10:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In Europe they are screaming at their politicians for a deal with the UK, in the UK businesses are screaming for a deal with the EU so its pretty clear that a deal is required. It should be on the basis of you sell to us, we sell to you and there are no tariffs.

Until December 31st of this year we remain under the rules and control of the EU. We should end this now and walk away so business and commerce can prepare for a future instead of being like spare pricks at a wedding until Jan 1st.

Britain has about 200 of which many would not reach their targets as we only have one submarine on station at any time and it only carries half a load.

1319945752844578821 2020-10-24 18:16:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What is so dreadfully wrong with politics in this country is that instead of giving the people that which they want which is possible and within reason, they give them nothing at all and do nothing but create confusion behind which they hide while they plunder our country.
1319945020443680769 2020-10-24 18:13:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Well, the territorial ambitions of China are well known and if they allow 3,000,000 Chinese to come here they may well have found a chink in our defence armour. . . . .

It's sick.
1319941162455752704 2020-10-24 17:57:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What makes Covid so bad is not the amount of people its killing, not the amount of people its making ill but the horrible involvement of something even worse than the disease itself - politicians.

1319666032420802562 2020-10-23 23:44:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> TV licence fury: BBC chief's huge swipe at critics amid ‘greatest broadcaster’ claim. It was nowhere near the world's greatest broadcaster before before he arrived and afterwards, it turned to dross so quickly.   https://t.co/LVY2fiAfD1
1319586463277895687 2020-10-23 18:28:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> This play which has had several acts and is called brexit is going to get one hell of a clogging from the critics. It's gone on too long, lost its direction, the plot has changed so often that no one knows what it is and the final act seems concerned with the "ultimate con".
1319585808874168321 2020-10-23 18:25:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SgtDaveTheBlade @BorisJohnson I'm naturally conservative and reserved ! I believe if there is one thing more impressive than a person who knows when to speak his mind its a person who knows when not to speak it. Never met any of the latter tho !
1319585041626861568 2020-10-23 18:22:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Ella32823623 Twitter is not social media. It's little more than a platform for attracting adoration of the left and suppressing admiration of the centre and right. It's passed its sell by date and everyone would benefit if it now failed. Tik Tok is more honest and constructive.
1319584341891207168 2020-10-23 18:19:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Further, tourism to California will stop on account of the tons of excrement in all of their streets from the illegals living on them who were encouraged to enter the country &amp; who will soon get pissed off and riot. It could be a good year people.
1319583174553440257 2020-10-23 18:15:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If Trump loses the election, we'll see a scramble for globalism, the substantial weakening both financially and militarily of the USA, the emergence of China &amp; Russia as the 2 superpowers &amp; then we'll moan about not having a world leader able to deal with the God awful situation.
1319582163529060355 2020-10-23 18:11:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @fenn_steven It went nowhere Stephen. We gave it away and continue to give it away.
1319581869667659776 2020-10-23 18:10:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Twitter is out of control. People are invited to comment on a variety of subjects but their comments are moderated or lost. It is a dangerous, biased, not registered political organisation, encouraging dissent among the simple and the young and it needs its wings clipping.
1319581208704126976 2020-10-23 18:07:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @fenn_steven I got banned for 7 days because I said child rapists should be ha ng ed. Apparently twitter believes the vile rape of a child is nowhere near as disconcerting as han gi ng the bastard responsible.
1319579438569410560 2020-10-23 18:00:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson   Boris tells us we can do as well with WTO rules as with an EU deal. Fine - if this is the case why the hell doesn't he stop wasting time, kick the EU into touch &amp; let commerce, industry &amp; the city get on with preparing for the 31st. F*ck the EU - sort out Covid.
1319577269820624901 2020-10-23 17:51:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Banned from following for 3 days yet again. Not a rule broken but these pig ignorant lefturds refuse to say which of their millions of rules have been broken. Never has anything served to show the dangers of a monopoly more than twitter. All social media should be broken up.

However, I don't particularly like the sugar, lemon and soda water so I leave those out. I also more often than not substitute the Gin for Chivas Regal.

1319322575521067008 2020-10-23 00:59:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MR_Doodles53 How reasonable. You sound just like an elitist. Are you a Bilderberg member by any chance. . . . . .
1319322148717137920 2020-10-23 00:58:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @tinabutton44 I think we are heading for a clash between "them and us" where "them" is the elite and "us" are what's left.
1319321611196137472 2020-10-23 00:55:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @miketal13 Don't worry about it Mike. No chance of that happening. No one listens to the working man any longer. The electorate are now the interruption of the government's work instead of the reason for it.
1319320688927309825 2020-10-23 00:52:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @infamousgrouser I had no idea bubonic plague was a conspiracy. I do know it killed tens of thousands and only ended when the great fire of London destroyed it. Mind you 1666 was a long time ago, perhaps the fire was a conspiracy . . . . . !!!
1319319922460295168 2020-10-23 00:49:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I am starting to believe that conspiracy is the new politics. Conspiracies can hide the truth indefinitely, create blinding confusion, keep the people in the dark for ever and are extremely cheap and effective in their operation.
1319319043749404672 2020-10-23 00:45:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @BaronDanglas I think if you take a sample of the worlds elite and look at the Bilderberg membership you can do nothing but fear for your future. The world is literally being taken from us, like candy from a baby. It's amazing, we're watching the rape of our children and don't give a shit.
1319317981197946882 2020-10-23 00:41:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Reprobate24 A few years ago I would get 1500 likes to a tweet but gradually the subjects I tweeted about became taboo &amp; people were scared to comment. Today, if I get 50 I have done well tho' I do pick up 3 -400 now &amp; then. Mind you, since Twitter said they hated me things have got worse.
1319316060085039106 2020-10-23 00:33:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AusterePatriot You mean if your family are excluded then everyone should have to die. Difficult question isn't it.
1319315581233995776 2020-10-23 00:32:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Oh very droll but so true. The media will hate you for that one Jr.
1319315344566194183 2020-10-23 00:31:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Question - if your survival depended upon half the people in the world not surviving in order that the other half could survive, would you sit comfortably with that?   Another question. Which half are you in ?
1319314586663849985 2020-10-23 00:28:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> over the past two years I have become increasingly concerned with my obsession over conspiracy theories. Be they Covid, Brexit, the media, Agenda 21 no matter what, most are now almost impossible to dismiss. I fear plans we won't like have and are being made for us.
1319283156655108101 2020-10-22 22:23:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Should Boris Johnson continue talks with the EU or simply walk away now?  https://t.co/GiBrwM4Kfm
1319279061982609408 2020-10-22 22:06:54 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Laughoutloud9b As long as people can scrape enough food together to keep breeding then this is exactly what they will do. It's  what they are programmed to do. Reduce food and you reduce population. If we behaved in the West as they do in Africa we'd have the same problems.
1319277752898387970 2020-10-22 22:01:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Laughoutloud9b Yes, there was selective murder with the parents opting to keep boys who would be able to support them in their old age.
1319277314555801601 2020-10-22 21:59:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @StephenJCarter4 I've read these reports but they don't stand up to one simple fact. Put half a dozen rats in a big box with all the food they need and they are happy. Put three dozen rats in a box with all the food they need and they kill each other. Territory figures prominently in humans.
1319276222493306881 2020-10-22 21:55:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @PoliticsPollss I'm willing to bet that most of those who oppose these laws are dole bludgers who have never worked, never will and feel OK about sponging off of those working and paying their benefits and health bills. I'm also willing to bet they are left wing and constantly complaining.
1319242805403897856 2020-10-22 19:42:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Every man woman and child in the UK pays over £3000 per annum as the genuine cost of health care. A family of four effectively pay £12,000 - less incidentally than an insurance policy would cost in the USA. However, insurance usually does not includes drugs dressings etc.
1319241943357022208 2020-10-22 19:39:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @creektothewest @BorisJohnson Well for sure the drug companies will have a field today as will most doctors in the US and anywhere else where they have to pay.
1319241202974195712 2020-10-22 19:36:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Laughoutloud9b The Chinese made more than one child illegal with very serious punishment for those who broke the law. So many broke it that they just let it slide. At one time, newly born children were being fed a type of porridge which they could not digest and which led to their deaths.
1319240270165266432 2020-10-22 19:32:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @marie_doonan Decent American will try to vote for president Trump because coincidentally its decent Americans who have intelligence. The scum who riot on the streets and attack Trump supporters and the democrat politicians who allow thugs to take over cities are probably not a minority.
1319236006898434050 2020-10-22 19:15:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> They then ask you to save your choices but visit them again two hours later and the bullshit starts all over again. There should be a law which says that its only necessary to make the choice once. They know who is visiting them. Its just a way to get round the law.
1319235516584333318 2020-10-22 19:13:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When the media constantly ask for our permission before they sell our information everywhere they provide an option to reject all or accept. Have you noticed that reject is no longer a part of the game and instead you spend 20 minutes ticking boxes which won't be ticked. . . more
1319233581315653632 2020-10-22 19:06:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @marie_doonan Even worse is that the American legal system is now so bent and biased against Trump there is virtually no hope for the truth even from the court.
1319233154016825344 2020-10-22 19:04:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @marie_doonan I don't believe anything produced by the media but with over 50,000 bogus driving licences being imported  from China to help illegals vote, I'm not sure whether the great man and the decent American people can deal with this level of cheating.
1319227393576501248 2020-10-22 18:41:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The democracy of our country is being threatened by a Biden victory in the USA election. Apparently he won't be doing a deal with the UK if he gets in because he supports the EU. If this is the case then the next war they get involved in don't ring our phone.
1319226668893032449 2020-10-22 18:38:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JayArch61526198 Why should they. They're in it for themselves and will be long dead before the misery of an overpopulated hungry world reaches them. Might be tough on their kids but I doubt that would worry most of them.
1319226101818937344 2020-10-22 18:36:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @BraisbyI I very much doubt that the effect of the vaccine reducing the chance of pregnancy is a side effect but rather the primary intention. If only 1 in 7 vaccines administered created sterility, the population of the world would plunge. Then the elite could steal everything left. . . .
1319224833448824833 2020-10-22 18:31:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Who is this trying to fool or mislead and why? What is wrong with the truth on a death certificate. Most of the population do not believe a word about what is being said about Covid and its time the truth is known. These wooden performances on TV every day are a waste of time.
1319224376135397376 2020-10-22 18:29:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson Mr Johnson,  There is so much confusion and mistrust over Covid that you need to deal with many of the problems and misinformation. For example, if someone tests positive for Covid and then gets hit by a truck, the death certificate says he died from Covid.   Why ??
1319223761933987840 2020-10-22 18:27:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The problem we face concerns saving the people of the world. Here are the choices.  1. Try to save everyone until population explosion makes it no longer possible 2. Accept there is no answer to this miserable problem and allow survival of the fittest.   Any other ideas anyone ?
1319222678193115137 2020-10-22 18:22:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @bigeck2281 @PoliticsPollss Yes you are right. Both corporal &amp; capital punishment should be returned because these are the rules under which we can be safe &amp; learn. Feral kids, riots, protests, a feeble police, an unreliable legal system are part of the system dismantling our society ready for globalism.
1319221649800126464 2020-10-22 18:18:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ceefax2 I agree so much David. All credit to you. You're spot on. How do we save the people from themselves. We desperately need to unite the people to fight this misery.
1319219856059830274 2020-10-22 18:11:38 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Look how the media is attacking Trump. Lies, falsehoods, smears - anything to get him out of office so the elite can continue their plundering &amp; rape of the world's richest country. Wake up USA you're calling for communism which benefits no one. You should be fighting against it.
1319217799349391362 2020-10-22 18:03:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When you read social media it would seem the problems which exist are world wide. People are sick of having no voice, of having government ignore them, of having the elite constantly take the cream. The question is not now how but rather when. Things have to change.
1319217221890093056 2020-10-22 18:01:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @bigeck2281 @PoliticsPollss Absolutely. The police warned her repeatedly to shut up and behave but she wanted to injure her boyfriend and ignored them. The real culprit here is society. If it were worth jack shit nobody would carry on like she did. Discipline and personal discipline do not exist today.
1319215678465937413 2020-10-22 17:55:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Political correctness, Common Purpose, a feeble police force, dishonest representation, corrupt media, a world controlled by the rich elite, not the democratically elected, a breakdown of discipline, riots, protests &amp; much more  We need to wake up &amp; start to fight for our future!
1319211327869603841 2020-10-22 17:37:44 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @jessie_gleaves Don't be ridiculous. Murder is the unlawful premeditated killing of one human by another. If she behaved herself this would not have happened. She was warned by the police to desist but she was hell bent on injuring her boyfriend so they stopped her.  How the hell is this murder?
1319209175705096194 2020-10-22 17:29:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @forcesbiznet Ah you refer to the uncivil servant who can stab his country in the back front or anywhere else with complete impunity and still go on to flip houses and fiddle his expenses.
1319208258486308865 2020-10-22 17:25:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> So if a pregnant woman points a shotgun at someone and threatens to kill him or her, the use of moderate, effective force by the police would be wrong? What nonsense. Behave &amp; you don't get tasered.
1319207649007853568 2020-10-22 17:23:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Regardless of what happens, regardless of whether or not they work, the civil service are paid and their pensions unaffected but those having their jobs and lives destroyed are the ones paying them. It's time the burden was shared.
1319205920438734848 2020-10-22 17:16:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @PoliticsPollss Of course it acceptable. If this were not the case we'd have violent crime being carried out by people pregnant or pretending to be pregnant. If you don't want your unborn child injured, do what the majority do and behave yourself. Personal discipline would have saved that life.
1319204529494249472 2020-10-22 17:10:44 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @britishlivesuk @juweecaroline Why do we allow Nigerians in our country to protest and disrupt traffic? How offensive. Piss off back to their own country if they want to protest. As for the police - not one in sight. They'd all run up to Watford gap once the protest started.
1319202311596658688 2020-10-22 17:01:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @RoodGridance @juweecaroline Common law or old law is supposedly safe by virtue of the fact that it has stood the test of time. However, it didn't stop Blair from decimating the Magna Carta and no law is safe from the political mongrels who are intent on changing it for their own purposes.
1318965639785205762 2020-10-22 01:21:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Sturdave1 I think Google were fined some spectacular amount of millions by the EU and they simply laughed and paid it.
1318954836277252096 2020-10-22 00:38:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Ever since Twitter has been in existence a large following has been deemed impressive and many still strive to get followers. However, don't knock your brains out because even tho you may follow a 1000 people, if twitter only tell a couple of dozen of them, things won't happen.
1318954066614095875 2020-10-22 00:35:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AlwinRichaards I have no reason or intention to give up. I am pretty certain I know what is happening and why and who is responsible and when it happens I don't want to have to say to myself how thick and stupid I was to be fooled so easily. We need to wake up and stand up and quickly.
1318953310498545665 2020-10-22 00:32:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AlwinRichaards It was the reference to my being high as if the views I have were ludicrous. I'm pretty sure many will think they are. I honestly don't like associating with these views but I can't get away from what seems to be a dangerous direction we are being forced in or the reason for it.
1318952048818331653 2020-10-22 00:27:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Naren_Reddy23 I did, through error and a few dozen more just as dangerous which need their wings clipping. The world is being controlled now with phenomenal wealth and not by democratically elected politicians and this is an ill wind which is blowing good for no one apart from the elite.
1318951316773867521 2020-10-22 00:24:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain>  https://t.co/1bwkqH6EVH There's so much of this around now some of it has to be true and if its only a fraction of what we hear on a daily basis we're in big trouble.
1318950156176424961 2020-10-22 00:19:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> These companies in the main support globalism because it suits them better. Its far more lucrative but they are crushing democracy and its time they were stopped. They've arrogantly overstepped the mark, know it and couldn't give a shit.
1318949785953599490 2020-10-22 00:18:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Allowing companies the size of Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple to exist is ridiculous. Their wealth is such as to allow them to ignore the law, pay the fines &amp; act politically without being a political party. They should be broken up as was Standard oil a few years ago.
1318949036498571270 2020-10-22 00:15:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @LanceDragon4 I pray that your confidence in the presidents longevity is justified. Frankly, I think it will be nothing short of a miracle if President Trump is able to withstand the dishonesty of the media, social media, democrats and morons who support them.
1318947619071266816 2020-10-22 00:09:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AlwinRichaards I think the stupid thing is asking me if I am high. Do you think I'm a junkie? Or is this the way you disagree with someone.
1318943446762246145 2020-10-21 23:53:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AlwinRichaards What has height got to do with Dutch Names or the context of the tweet? Are you stupid. You seem to have a stupid name.
1318942540498980864 2020-10-21 23:49:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Smak1884 To allow drug companies the right to produce a product without the need to prove it has been tested is appalling. Remember thalidomide. This was never a medical or research decision, this was political and part of a plan.
1318941249517309953 2020-10-21 23:44:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @mhowarth1963 My friend when they are the only people from which you can obtain food for your family, medical care, energy to heat your home and water to drink, their fu*king dream will be your nightmares.
1318940268524150784 2020-10-21 23:40:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The one thing I cannot understand is where Brexit figures into this. I can only assume it is just another ruse to keep us away from what is being done.
1318939999044251649 2020-10-21 23:39:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The takeover by a single government and the bringing down of all borders will be simple. Already phenomenal damage has been done by the way this "virus" has been handled. Economies have been smashed, companies destroyed, people ruined. and yet flu which kills more is ignored.
1318933916284297217 2020-10-21 23:15:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Soon a vaccine for covid will be introduced and that it will be mandatory for all to have it. When Covid has been forgotten, the worlds population will start to rapidly fall. This will coincide with the rich getting richer, a single world government and a world without borders.
1318704660266557440 2020-10-21 08:04:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Eye-watering amount Emmanuel Macron may lose from Brexit: 'France can't afford no deal!'   This frog idiot Macron thinks Britain has to purchase a trade deal with the EU by giving away 1,000's of tons of our fish. Boris should send them a bill for what they cost us in WWll
1318702150537576459 2020-10-21 07:54:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Twitter are at it again. Don't waste time following. They follow about 1 in 30 of your follow requests. Following sucks up memory and they don't like that.

1318551459982618624 2020-10-20 21:55:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> A close friend told me that over several days he had followed exactly 1000 people as an experiment. Ordinarily he claimed he would have had at least 650 follow him back. Twitter have allowed him 14 and his two daughters can find no evidence of him following them. Games continue.
1318550469254459405 2020-10-20 21:51:44 +0800 <Jonteinspain> New world order, globalism, multi-lateralism and many other descriptions are the names being used to prevent people from the fear of communism which the left are being encouraged to follow. Only the elite will benefit from globalism, not those who made it possible.
1318549665718087682 2020-10-20 21:48:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @HeatherIAm23 Yes this country and every other country the filthy globalists have got their hands on. If Trump loses, the USA will be speaking Spanish or Arabic in a year and the elite globalists responsible will be the only ones to benefit from a crashing USA.

Air is fed from the engine compressor, heated and then passed into the cabin. Cabin air is changed every 3 minutes whilst in flight (the same as is found in operating theatres). Seems you are not as aware as you think you are Jim.
1318323616136781824 2020-10-20 06:50:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> First time I have seen Dianne Abbott in an interview which was not a car crash. She's done very well here. I wonder if she's given up the hard stuff ?
1318322041804722176 2020-10-20 06:44:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Social media is utterly corrupt. Biden's emails have been revealed showing him &amp; his son to be corrupt but social media are censoring every word and have even locked the account of the New York times which dared report it. This is dangerous and social media needs controlling.
1318320144628711430 2020-10-20 06:36:30 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Here are the results of the negotiations once the bullshit, deceit &amp; conspiring have ended. Boris will give on fisheries &amp; will also give on State aid. He's already given on Ireland &amp; the result will be we won't get a true brexit &amp; Johnson &amp; the EU will both claim a victory.
1318168001817051136 2020-10-19 20:31:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think social media is so grossly biased as to justify the end of it. In common with many others I am/have turned to news blogs such as The Epoch Times. The ET is superb. Facts with no bias. Its not yet reached Europe but it won't be long.   Nothing good about being censored.
1318163389798076419 2020-10-19 20:13:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ray_gilbey Well said Ray 15 out of 10 for that one.
1318162419559075841 2020-10-19 20:09:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @The1Voyce On Saturday the Frogs were saying they were going to renege on their contract to supply us with electricity which would be breaking international law. We are dealing with utter trash and need to move on.
1318159481151377409 2020-10-19 19:58:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @StayHungryPT @MarianneSansum Sadly but perhaps typically, when it comes to Patel after all is said and done, Everything has been said and nothing done.
1318159062283001857 2020-10-19 19:56:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @StayHungryPT @MarianneSansum Very well said. A point which needs to be understood. A warning for us also because clearly the lady finds it easy to make promises and speak trash. Of all the things she has promised I am not aware of anything she had done or achieved.

1318151427852767232 2020-10-19 19:26:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> That Frog tosser threatening to cut off Britain's electrical supply would do well to know where the EU obtains its phenomenal borrowing. In case you don't know its the city of London &amp; at rates which cannot be equalled anywhere. No electricity = cold. No money = broke and cold.

Just arrest the boat, take it to the nearest fishing port, confiscate the catch and the boat, fine the captain a million or so or 5 years in prison if not paid. They'd soon lose interest in our fish . . . . . .
1318125579963666433 2020-10-19 17:43:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @PhilHannon Yes I understand that, it makes sense. So why not control the speed of the turbine by feathering, or preventing less bite of the blade to the wind. Aircraft can fly at 300 miles an hour with a prop feathered and not turning.
1318124736291930113 2020-10-19 17:40:01 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Golding314159 Correction. . ,.Wind turbines are the way !
1318124627210719233 2020-10-19 17:39:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Golding314159 To date the allocation of contracts for wind turbines has been very unsatisfactory, selective at best. Didn't Cameron arrange for Daddy to be involved in an enormously lucrative wind turbine deal &amp; haven't there been many other similar deals. Not sure if wind turbines is the way.
1318123315224055808 2020-10-19 17:34:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @bagofcows Huh? WTF is Huh? China are fighting India on their borders, we have treaties with India, China is threatening to invade Taiwan &amp; is massing ships in the sea off the Island. The USA has a treaty to defend Taiwan, we have a treaty with the USA and Nato. There is so much more. Huh.

1318121311911235584 2020-10-19 17:26:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Golding314159 Maybe knocking the Eiffel tower over would be a little drastic as an initial measure. Perhaps what would be better would be to knock down the old folks home in which Mrs Macron lives . . . . .
1318120371544035328 2020-10-19 17:22:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Golding314159 If they pulled a trick like that it could only be to create serious problems in an attempt to hurt us. If they pull this trick we should knock the Eiffel tower down. An attack like that by France would be akin to an act of war.
1318118208302350336 2020-10-19 17:14:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Just read that wind turbines have to be shut down when wind speed exceed 45 miles per hour so as to be able to protect equipment. Why don't they use a computer to feather the blades into wind so it can be used all the time. Aircraft props can be feathered so as not to move.
1318117259454402561 2020-10-19 17:10:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Arlanymor4 The French went for nuclear at the same time Britain decided it could not deal with it. As a result the French provide electrical power for much of Europe while Britain plants windmills and kills birds in protected areas  and whose output is 5% of our needs.
1318114868013256704 2020-10-19 17:00:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I'm sure its not going to be long before the frogs start talking about preventing us from flying across Europe. It will only be the frogs who suggest this because everyone else knows the UK controls the Atlantic airspace meaning no travel to or from North and south America.
1318114092033449984 2020-10-19 16:57:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The French took millions to prevent migrants crossing the channel but did nothing. We gave them millions more but they did nothing. Now their navy escorts rubber boats into British waters which they recognise but they don't recognise the fish in these British waters as British.
1318113053427322881 2020-10-19 16:53:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @cander509 Mind you, it may help to keep the channel free of rubber boats and illegal migrants.
1318112536223506432 2020-10-19 16:51:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @cander509 Well, that's the best part of them gone if he does that. . . .
1318111155588681730 2020-10-19 16:46:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @EliKane8 @Cu1pepperTh0mas Apparently this is the case with a good many people if the population increases which are deemed to stem from power cuts is to be believed. Let's face it - sit in the dark or do something else but be careful, the dogs nose can be very cold . . . . .
1318108968598851591 2020-10-19 16:37:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SgtDaveTheBlade The Vietnamese kicked seven colours out of them. You're right - they never learn.  Nelson hammered them, Wellington hammered them and Germany became addicted to giving them a good clogging.
1318107662920437760 2020-10-19 16:32:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I suppose the next thing we'll see from Twitter will be the appointment of Greta Thunberg leading a committee into the dangers of rain dancing. . . .
1318106976623206400 2020-10-19 16:29:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> So the pussy whippee no longer being anything in the British Military, is joining with the pussy whipper to lead a committee into the dangers of social media. Those two don't have a brain between them. Twitter not surprisingly have found a way to use them for PR.
1318106179877351424 2020-10-19 16:26:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> This threat is one which Britain should not take lightly. When it comes to the French they are spiteful and if they can, they will. Instead of letting them cut off our power we should boycott everything they export to us until Macron shuts his teeney bopper mouth and apologises.
1318105452933251072 2020-10-19 16:23:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Britain has a deal with France that they provide us with electricity. Isn't a deal between countries covered by international law. . . . Funny how the frogs wanted to prosecute the UK for breaking international law but are now threatening to break it themselves. FFS Boris leave.
1317952194067501060 2020-10-19 06:14:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Merkel slaps down Macron as he puts Brexit deal on brink - 'Fishing isn't the only topic!'   We're not going down on knees to the EU, they're not having our fish and we're not going to have them tell us we have to cripple our industry so they can compete with us. End it Boris.
1317947916913430530 2020-10-19 05:57:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SgtDaveTheBlade He makes me so sick. Degaulle hid in Britain during the war and then went back to lead the allies in the liberation of his miserable country. Nothing by way of gratitude ever from France, just sniping and unpleasantness.
1317932275988824065 2020-10-19 04:55:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I keep telling myself that we could not be so stupid as to become involved in a world war, despite the rapidly mounting evidence that this is indeed the case. It must be the case, Boris has decided to reduce the size of our desperately needed military and China is ready to go.
1317927949635563521 2020-10-19 04:38:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Britons FURIOUS as 'bitter' Macron threatens energy blockade ‘showing his true colours!’   The very reason Britain is leaving the EU and why others will follow us. This arrogant frog has done more to screw the EU than Junkers did. We should be grateful to the dick.

World leaders are puppets but not with as much power as a puppet. Globalism is a greater danger than China and Russia together.

Ours to do with as we please &amp; know best. We've had 47 years of shameful grovelling to globalists &amp; the best way to save Europe again is to see an end to the EU.
1317038092134551552 2020-10-16 17:42:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> All this Brexit negotiating is numbing.

1316657380667600897 2020-10-15 16:29:16 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I am as sick of these brexit negotiations as I was of Mrs May. Nothing can be gained by this childish bickering &amp; blustering. Either let the wretched EU steal our fish, future, sovereignty &amp; everything else or grow a pair &amp; walk away. Time will solve this problem, nothing else.

He threatened the EU and then backed down. What does he expect them to do now? They called his bluff and he has nothing in reserve. Must be a tory PM.

1315968818452324352 2020-10-13 18:53:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @jeremypssm Yes I remember that very well. That's when I gave them up. Clearly they have board room problems which as with the BBC won't be resolved until all those concerned are swept out and they can start again respecting those who risk their lives &amp; ask for absolutely nothing.
1315968012147662849 2020-10-13 18:49:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @tkc50 I think its a lot more simple than that. They don't have a clue. Its like asking a passenger who has never flown before to take control of an Airbus 380. Everything or most things they touch turn to sh*t and they pay themselves fortunes in black money.

1315965290333822977 2020-10-13 18:39:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The alarming thing about the BBC is not their chronic left wing, bordering on marxism bias but how on earth it could have happened. From the worlds premier broadcaster to a dangerous driveller of dross. The people didn't care nor did the government &amp; what we have is the result.
1315962623234650115 2020-10-13 18:28:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Malice_Toward_0 Years ago I used to work in Peshawar which is in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan where we often met the Mujahidin. They used to say  "I won't believe it until I've heard it on the BBC". Today, if you hear it on the BBC you know its a damned lie &amp; just dross.
1315961337940447232 2020-10-13 18:23:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think the RNLI are wonderful. There are so many photo's of them helping migrants attempting to enter Britain illegally and taking them to Dover where the benefits people are waiting for them. And they do this all on money we give them. . . . cool.
1315949162421202945 2020-10-13 17:35:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Why are they moaning? They've already said they will ignore any limits and fish as they please. Let's hope the Navy has a serviceable boat which is not employed taxying migrants to Dover.

Oh the rioters and migrants do &amp; don't they do well but no one else. It's said you only get the government you deserve but do we really deserve this ?
1315938188951777280 2020-10-13 16:51:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AndrewRegan16 I think they are very active in that department and using every thing from bribery to threats to expand its empire.

1315937375571324934 2020-10-13 16:48:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The BBC have denied an accusation that they are left wing biased. So, not only biased but bloody liars as well. All those currently working for the BBC will go down in history as the reason for its demise. Another group of wankers who thought they had more power than the people.

1315244391024545792 2020-10-11 18:54:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Twitter has so many algorithms looking for those who don't and won't think like they do that they clash. Look how many hundreds of thousands are now being accused and punished for breaking rules which nobody understands. Suspended, kicked out, banned from following. . . Lunacy !
1315243526205181952 2020-10-11 18:51:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> On many occasion you waste time following people  because whilst you go through the motions, twitters does nothing with your follow requests. Often it unfollows some of your followers which then starts a followers run. Ask why they do this to be effectively ignored.
1315241665880371206 2020-10-11 18:43:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What sort of a government ignores riots, encourages protests, has a police force which drops on one knee when confronted with an angry crowd and acts tough with the weak but trembles and runs when it comes to dealing with the tough. As for illegal migrants. . . . we need change.
1315240454150000640 2020-10-11 18:38:54 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I cancelled my Tory membership a little while ago and whilst I would never vote Labour or Lib Dung, together with many others, neither, will I vote Tory again. 4 years of the greatest political flop I have ever known and it gets worse.

1314880285297737728 2020-10-10 18:47:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I have no doubt that he is going to give away a huge chunk of our fisheries, which means the 100 metre trawlers will continue to decimate everything including the conservation areas.

It's that simple.
1314529679588687872 2020-10-09 19:34:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @GrovePortland I think its more of a Khaki colour they have in mind. Neither black, white or brown. . . . .
1314529381671407616 2020-10-09 19:33:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaya, Tai Wan and many other countries laugh at the EU and their pathetic way of competing, using tariffs to raise the price of all imported goods so as to be the same or more expensive than those produced inefficiently within the EU.
1314516973309616128 2020-10-09 18:44:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Coldfell1 Aint that a fact. Look at the USA where the control of the 1% is so great as to be able to control the media &amp; left wing. We have seen wealth used brutally for political reasons, It purchased a false report about Trump &amp; when that failed was used to impeach him which also failed.
1314514332638642176 2020-10-09 18:33:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> To put things into perspective consider this - The top 1% of people have more wealth than the bottom 95%. So now you know, regardless of who you voted for, just who controls the world. It's dangerous, people have no valid say. As always - he who pays the minstrel picks the tune.
1314508357013774336 2020-10-09 18:09:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If after all this time, expense, bullshit, deception &amp; lies Boris falls over, he will decimate the tory party.   1. Our coastal waters, our fish 2. Our right to invest in our own industries.  3. N.I. is part of the UK 4. EU law is not UK law.  Canada deal or FFS let's walk away.
1314500254142812161 2020-10-09 17:37:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Further, since our membership we have lost the BBC to left wing globalism, our education system is now churning out marxists, our media have become crap. Once the champions of the people they are now aiding and abetting their oppression. By God do we need change.
1314499516276584451 2020-10-09 17:34:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think our time in the EU has been a sewage sandwich. The only thing we've gained is the loss of our sovereignty and laws to be replaced by globalists looking for a world all the same colour and without borders. Its done nothing for our political standards which are now abysmal.

What people say is based on their experience, not on your experience. What you are saying is disgusting, which is don't say anything I don't agree with. I know people well over 70 treated by the NHS &amp; others over 70 treated badly.
1313798389000220680 2020-10-07 19:08:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @rpeter99 Its a strange opinion to hold today when we have full term abortion which no doubt will soon rise to full term abortion plus five years. . . . . . . . . .!!!
1313796994230628354 2020-10-07 19:03:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Talking to a Muslim cleric in ASDA yesterday (2 metres apart) and I said the way they killed chickens was disgusting. He said they are killed humanely in the traditional Muslim way.   How the hell do you strap a back pack on a chicken ?
1313795669707063296 2020-10-07 18:57:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @goforth_x A couple of years ago I was in "Le Galopin" restaurant in Paris when a car outside backfired. The entire staff rushed outside to surrender . . . . . . .
1313795037952716803 2020-10-07 18:55:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @goforth_x Would we want the keys to Paris. Last I saw was it was full of Arabs and Africans, polluting and rioting. Mind you, since then they have been taking them to the coast and putting them in rubber boats and pointing them at Britain so it might not be too bad. . . . . .
1313794394504531969 2020-10-07 18:52:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @lrmortensen One other point is that a new born child can never miss what he has never had or understands. The argument is fair and reasonable but based on emotion. Nature has no such argument to deal with, having worked the system out millions of years ago.
1313793499284766722 2020-10-07 18:49:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @lrmortensen Yes I understand what she means completely. It was a view I held for a while but it becomes increasingly obvious the debt we have to those who went before us and its not really until their later life we get the chance to repay it or some of it. Lets not talk about the war dead.
1313788038707908614 2020-10-07 18:27:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Makes you wonder how they can claim asylum when the only danger is a failing crop.  Asylum is :-  The protection granted by a state to someone who has left their home country as a political refugee.  I'll warrant that not a single rubber boat has carried a political refugee.
1313786458596139008 2020-10-07 18:21:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Macron screaming again. Demands UK fish for French fisherman. Not prepared to pay for them other than to talk about a deal which he needs more than we do. For too long Macron has believed he has huge testicles. He listens to much to his teacher wife. She has the testicles.
1313785792880422914 2020-10-07 18:18:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Wouldn't it be cheaper to help such people in their own country instead of making it impossible to find a hotel in some of our bigger towns? Have they really deserted wives and children to come here. If so is this because they believe they can send thousands of pounds home?
1313785328294076421 2020-10-07 18:16:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Brace yourselves. We now hear that its not war creating refugees and driving them here but drought. Failing crops etc cause them to abandon their wives, children and responsibilities, taking all the cash for boat trips to the UK for benefits. . . . .More follows . . . .
1313776746282520576 2020-10-07 17:42:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @BR1CK58 Its only my opinion but I can't see how anyone using twitter could have any other vote other than no. . . . .
1313776495593172997 2020-10-07 17:41:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @1unleashed2 I suppose as far as twitter is concerned it is. Its only a tiny sample but at 300 plus votes so far the unhappy rate is still about 92% showing that twitter is tolerated and suffered not worshipped.

1313511334177275913 2020-10-07 00:08:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Are you content and satisfied with the way Twitter is operated by its directors and controllers.
1313502886802927622 2020-10-06 23:34:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Blair was able to convince parliament in days to vote for an illegal war in which we lost 400 of our young people &amp; yet Chapati Patel tells us to stop illegals criminally entering the UK is going to take a long time - years in fact.   We're supposed to vote for this? I think not.
1313256531908063232 2020-10-06 07:15:30 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The House of Lords is quite ridiculous. It's more crowded than the underground at rush hour but nowhere near as constructive or useful. The lords are behaving like Lemmings. Clearly they cannot be allowed to continue as they are &amp; the abolishing process should begin immediately.
1313245345707692032 2020-10-06 06:31:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson  Yes or no. Should the House of Lords be abolished ?  Please retweet for a more accurate poll. Thank you.
1313244636622749705 2020-10-06 06:28:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Unelected peers repeatedly refuse to back Boris legislation.  It's time this government realised that the majority of people have called for an end to the house of Lords. 3 years of H.O.L. continuing crap is enough. No more. They do nothing but obstruct. Abolish them.

Another £500 per day which would be better spent on the NHS, finding hotels for illegal migrants, or perhaps really wasting it on helping remove the homeless from our streets or helping Patel to bring in even more migrants. . . . .
1313117378461523968 2020-10-05 22:02:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Being an ex cricketer and still an avid supporter and having respect for Sir Ian Botham, I am amiss to understand how he can or should have the right to be able to vote for or against legislation passed by a democratically elected parliament. I mean, this really is piss taking !
1313112391631200256 2020-10-05 21:42:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @TFreeuk I agree with your remarks completely with just one tiny alteration. All governments are treacherous.

1313111153296453633 2020-10-05 21:37:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The Lords are a waste of time. Each party seeks to control the lords so it turns them out left right &amp; centre. At the end of every government there is more corruption as political arse wipes are sent up stairs in return for their votes. How is this remotely democratic or useful ?
1313110238950821888 2020-10-05 21:34:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> One of the shortest period of time known to man is that which exists between government saying the number of Lords must be reduced and then packing in another truck load.
1313109721113661442 2020-10-05 21:32:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> WATCH as Brexit-backing Sir Ian Botham is sworn into House of Lords.  FFS. They're already four deep on a knee. How many more of these leeches are we going to pack in to that place! What the hell is wrong with us ? Our money is pissed against the wall &amp; we say &amp; do nothing.

1313053876539584513 2020-10-05 17:50:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> To leave the EU without a trade deal would free us of all EU influences &amp; may create discomfort for a year or so but this would take the brake of our economy like nothing else could even approach. You can't save a gangrenous leg with antibiotics. All of it has to go !!!

1313050079457095681 2020-10-05 17:35:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I'm stupid. I must be because I seem to be one of the only people who thinks the EU is desperate for a trade deal with Britain &amp; who thinks they are hiding this desperation by threatening us constantly. Money they desperately need is raised in the city of London - they need us.

1312823593554903044 2020-10-05 02:35:10 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I'll take bets that the Tories have lost an election before Patel raises a chapati and does anything about illegal migration. She might like to explain why people are being arrested for videoing illegals arriving.
1312823147972964352 2020-10-05 02:33:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Just seen Patel on the news telling everyone how she is going to sort out illegal immigration etc etc. However, she has warned us that its going to take a long time. Well who'd have thought that. She is so unsubtle and such a rotten liar. Translated it means no change !!!
1312435942595072000 2020-10-04 00:54:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Barnier to jet out to Berlin for crunch Brexit talks with Merkel with deal on the horizon .   I suspect the "deal on the horizon" is the very same one which was agreed when the talks first started and were calculated to look as if both sides were fighting their corner.

1311950942418460673 2020-10-02 16:47:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Its hard to believe that we have youngsters oblivious to patriotism and nationalism, who don't hold their own country in any regard at all but then look at their education. They are being taught this. As for our universities comrades. . . .trash them and start again.
1311950495464947712 2020-10-02 16:45:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @righttospeak3 They make me sick they type brought on by four fingers down the throat. I never wanted social media censored but now I'd like to see it banned. For any democratic centre or right of centre country its dangerous. Its marxist and should be considered an enemy.
1311949198011576321 2020-10-02 16:40:38 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Twitter have stopped me from following anyone. This is the 14th time they have done this. If you follow me I can't return your follow, something I hate to do. However, I eventually manage to catch up so please be patient.
1311944783603150849 2020-10-02 16:23:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The EU keep saying they can't see why Britain wants to leave. It's very simple. Its impossible to soar with the Eagles when turkeys are filing the flight plans.   December 31st. UK cleared for take off. Up, up and away. . . . .

1311943108347781120 2020-10-02 16:16:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @m4rk56 @slimtimcann @BorisJohnson Well said. Very well said. Very, very, very well said. He's an ex cop you can't expect much from a person who spends his life on one knee or running like f**k from trouble.
1311942616624304129 2020-10-02 16:14:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @slimtimcann @BorisJohnson I see you're an ex cop. I'm surprised you found the courage to write that. Were you on one knee at the time or had the arrest and mal treatment of another pensioner got you excited.
1311941601799872512 2020-10-02 16:10:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Boris backed to drag UK out of EU without Brexit trade deal - 'Leave them behind forever!'   I didn't notice this vote but I agree with it entirely. Initially we may suffer a few twinges but not as many as the EU and without their crippling left wing practices we'll soon soar.
1311940615064752133 2020-10-02 16:06:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> P.S. And they're the good points. Twitter is doing more to damage free speech than many realise. We're stupid to support them.

How entirely reasonable from a company which "abhors violence. I wonder if he's had his account shut down. Frankly if anything needs shooting its this Marxist, censoring, patronising heap of shite.

1310951012409184259 2020-09-29 22:34:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Do you realise that if May had still be PM we would by now have given away our coastal waters, Northern Ireland, our future and assigned our nuclear military to the control of the EU. Had May been successful in her endeavours we would now be on a par with Zimbabwe.
1310950256243339268 2020-09-29 22:31:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> May is a remainer and had it not been for Boris she would have wrecked and overturned the peoples vote to leave the festering EU. She went against our people not openly but by trying to crash brexit and her attempts gave the EU most of what we had which was worth anything.
1310945886390943744 2020-09-29 22:13:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Vivienn34776861 I'll never forget her wearing a red dress with a split almost up to her natal cleft when President Trump was here. What a sight she was. You would think with her money she could afford to take appropriate advice. The Trumps of course were immaculate - his wife spectacular.
1310944454107430917 2020-09-29 22:08:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Vivienn34776861 She humiliated Britain. She sobbed in front of the EU who ridiculed her &amp; her weakness and she is responsible for the situation with N. Ireland which Boris is trying to save. I detest the woman who I consider one of the worst dressed politicians ever. Mind you that chain is cool.
1310943731718270982 2020-09-29 22:05:16 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @toes_quick I just made the same point in a later tweet. I agree strongly with what you say and honestly believe she protected these evil bastards, some of whom may even have been her friends.

1310940386928594946 2020-09-29 21:51:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> This parliament is proving as stupid as the last one &amp; just as dishonest. May should be fired and the whip withdrawn from her. Further, her constituents need to ask themselves if they did the right thing in putting her in parliament. A failure still failing. What a wretch she is.
1310939801755975683 2020-09-29 21:49:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Now May has got her second breath and is back betraying the country. What is this crap about international law?

1310495419072483328 2020-09-28 16:23:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Napalm_irony No, I certainly have not. However liberals are not very bright and probably don't use twitter in any quantities. Mind you, anyone who subjects themselves to the patronising and control of Twitter can't be too bright either.
1310364550768848898 2020-09-28 07:43:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I've been reading that there are big changes on the way for the BBC and there will be a few wrists slapped.

1310354734151340034 2020-09-28 07:04:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @neil_jones00 I think the whole question of animal charities advertising needs to be looked at. Day in and day out tear jerking adds go out telling us how dreadful things are and never once do we ever see what our money is able to do or has achieved. They should be investigated.
1310352771493826561 2020-09-28 06:57:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @paul_e4 It also explains why he wanted to legalise the million or so illegals living in this country.

1310256597239820288 2020-09-28 00:34:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Frankly, the dreadful way in which both Sky and the BBC politicise the news according to their own opinions is wrong. Its been a long time since we have heard the truth from either and the reason is simple. The truth suits neither of them.-
1310255893532020740 2020-09-28 00:32:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @billguy719 I think if he is elected they will wait until he goes for a piss then install the VP as president and that will be the end of him - and the USA.
1310255454531059717 2020-09-28 00:30:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Sky news were today criticising Trump for suggesting the vote being rigged. They claim he has no proof whatsoever despite the FBI being in possession of 1.000's of postal votes for Trump which had been disposed of in trash cans. Censoring news is bad but not as bad as altering it
1310254039725232128 2020-09-28 00:24:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I would like to punish people who could contemplate voting democrat but in fact its not necessary. If Biden is elected that will be more punishment than the average democrat support will be able to tolerate.
1310253442317901825 2020-09-28 00:22:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @BetteMidler I like the way failed showbiz celebs think they can get back in the limelight by criticising president Trump. I think they had better pray he doesn't get in again because if he does the next four years will drain the swamp and sterilise California.
1310242814807207942 2020-09-27 23:40:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When you look at how many adverts there are on tv for charities &amp; just how much they pay their C.E.O's (£150,000 P.A. upwards - it makes you wonder how many people it takes to pay their wages at £2 per month before the charity work begins. Then there is the cost of advertising !!
1310240867551248389 2020-09-27 23:32:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Like it or not, when a government watches thousands of Muslims from the middle east &amp; Africa breaking into our country and does nothing for reasons which it never runs out of, it must be painfully apparent that they support their arrival. Just as the globalists want.
1310155130994647041 2020-09-27 17:51:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Saphirial24 @KRTN_Will The mix of our population at the moment is ridiculous. There are so many who dislike the country and its culture, dislike its people but love its benefits, that in time of war it may prove difficult to recruit safely. Especially so depending upon who the enemy was.
1310154450431094786 2020-09-27 17:48:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Saphirial24 @KRTN_Will I believe in national service because in two and a half years the young learn what discipline is and how they can't avoid it. However, training terrorists (and we have a lot in this country) is not too bright. However, a way should be found.

1309896133460856834 2020-09-27 00:42:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @HackettNicholas @jeremycorbyn There was an interview with a "refugee! on Youtube which seems to have been taken down. He explained he wanted to get to Europe &amp; when he got there everyone was saying you have to get to England. He wanted to go to England because it was a better life not that he was in danger.
1309895269975314432 2020-09-27 00:39:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @godfreygoon @jeremycorbyn Where are your manners. . . .It's fuck off please !!!
1309657588246687747 2020-09-26 08:54:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @BrexitDuck Clearly because the person or persons wanting them here have more clout than the British electorate. Our politic system does nothing but prevent the electorate from becoming involved in anything political.
1309657107625586691 2020-09-26 08:52:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @patriotgirl2021 @pnjaban Yes a cast of tens of thousands or should we say half caste!
1309654821637627907 2020-09-26 08:43:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> With the left wing specialising in so much ignorance and lethargy apart from riots and protests, I would have thought she won't find it difficult to get people to vote for her. She knows how to slander Trump and to be a democrat you need know nothing else.
1309634210538360839 2020-09-26 07:21:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @danielp_mc Good question but he seems to have achieved less than 5/8ths the square of F**k all. I get the impression he was appointed for no other reason than to cause the belief that something was being done when in fact the situation was unchanged with nothing being done or planned.
1309590331642597388 2020-09-26 04:27:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ericthomson5 What is it about left wingers that make them so unpleasant? And why do they have so few followers? Speaks volumes doesn't it. I can insult who I want and whether I get their name right is fuck all to do with you. Troll.
1309552788507160576 2020-09-26 01:58:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Amoeboid11 I wish we could go back to the good old days when this sort of mendacious slander would be dealt with by a good hiding from a patriot. What a turd O'brien is. Does he really think people are going to believe shite like this? I suppose he does.
1309552009394216968 2020-09-26 01:55:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Andrew Neil launches BBC rival with new TV channel set to go live in just months   Excellent news. I can't believe we are going to see Mr Neil censoring and corrupting the news. Kate Burley had better go for another facelift she's going to need a lot of help competing with Andrew
1309429392163119105 2020-09-25 17:47:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @APWard4 I'm not obsessed with the US elections. I'm obsessed with the fear that the democraps will be elected which will have a profound effect not only on the USA but on Europe, particularly the UK. But there, I'm very selfish, I have a lot to lose. How many people follow you ?
1309428926024908800 2020-09-25 17:45:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Algi49379342 @therin_peter @nicolawitch Please, Nightingale hospitals were empty because the volume expected did not arise. If you are going to tweet, at least tweet common sense. I was a hospital director for 11 years, I know what went on and is going on now.
1309427546342256641 2020-09-25 17:40:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Quinnwhite1234 If you will to go from the sublime to the ridiculous then it is possible for there to be two stories but as there has been no evidence of Trump cheating, just accusation after accusation against him by the democrats, none of which have been proved I think one story is likely.
1309368416722128896 2020-09-25 13:45:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Just watched a video of groper Biden. Surely people won't vote for him. If they do they must be obsessed with hatred for Trump to such a degree as to warrant medical aid. Vote rigging, violence, slander, criminality, there's a lot more to being a democrat than politics.
1309366978415656968 2020-09-25 13:39:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In the USA the FBI have found mail-in ballots discarded in Pennsylvania. All of them were cast for President Trump. The cheating to date has been such as to invalidate the election. Clinton is warning that Trump will refuse to leave office. Obviously she knows the cheating level.
1309350107331145728 2020-09-25 12:32:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @BriereJudi @scotty_kiker No, the Canadians wouldn't pay for their security so they moved to the USA where they also wouldn't pay for it. I think the pussy whipper goes where she can get most publicity and harry goes where he's told to go.

1309272568889835531 2020-09-25 07:24:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Forest_til_IDie Ahh, you refer to the galloping major . . . . .

1309212865522528256 2020-09-25 03:27:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> How is it possible for HM the Queen to have a grandson who is openly critical of the president of the United States and who produces a video encouraging Americans to vote for Biden. Trump should kick him out and we should ban her from Britain.
1309211082729418752 2020-09-25 03:20:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Algi49379342 @therin_peter @nicolawitch I once knew a guy who could yodel. I was impressed but nowhere near as impressed as I am with you, the only person I have ever known able to speak through his arse. Johnson is not deliberately destroying the country. He's not destroying it in any way at all. .. . .
1309210055275933701 2020-09-25 03:16:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @zobelle70 @nicolawitch Blair repealed virtually all of the Magna Carta fearing that if he carried on as he was it would be used against him. Today there are many countries in the world with more of our Magna Carta in law than we have.

1309208052848095234 2020-09-25 03:08:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @martini_wahine Not sure she's got anyone else lined up at the moment. She's not likely to act (not that she ever could) until a seamless break is guaranteed and the flow of cash is not interrupted. . . . . . . . . . !!!
1309207552748597248 2020-09-25 03:06:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @HeathenTom Son and father ? Makes you think doesn't it. Frankly his conduct as a royal is pretty dreadful and its time he was promoted to Mr. If he stays a prince, Royalty really will be in trouble. If they won't defend themselves then why the hell should we defend them?  https://t.co/OKTXGazVtl
1309191435455954947 2020-09-25 02:02:16 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Remember how two months ago the government was accused of inflating the covid cases by including all deaths as covid. Well now they are accused of failing to report enough covid because its not possible to identify all who have been infected. Wonder what's next from pub experts.
1309189525596446720 2020-09-25 01:54:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Prince Harry &amp; princess pussy whipper are now promoting the senile Biden for president in the forthcoming USA election. If Granny doesn't remove all vestiges of royalty from this feeble moron &amp; his b rated actress, Charles is never going to be King and his only title will be Mr.
1308925039543308288 2020-09-24 08:23:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson Over the past 12 months we have gone from Tally ho we'll stop them, to we're putting pressure on the french to stop them &amp; now we are told we can't stop them its too complicated. Lies and more lies.  Same with grooming and rape of our children isn't it Boris.
1308924300431327232 2020-09-24 08:20:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Strange, I've just read a tweet quoting Johnson as saying that the law is too complex to stop illegal immigrants. This being the case the only thing which can be concluded is that Johnson has no desire to stop them and we'll continue to pay as long as he is in office.
1308923517262589952 2020-09-24 08:17:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Too complex to stop muslims from travelling to this country for no other reason other than they can live free for ever more on benefits. Johnson must be off his head to say such a thing. Mind you, everyone is saying he had no intention of stopping them @borisjohnson
1308916223623782400 2020-09-24 07:48:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borusjohnson Boris Johnson victory! MPs back Prime Minister’s Brexit plan – EU fury rejected   Well done Boris. More of this on just about everything and we'll be well on the way. Run them ragged as they did us and then leave WTO.   https://t.co/qZaC0FAaYK
1308761139900276742 2020-09-23 21:32:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @gordonhotchkiss You think Harry, Edward, Andrew, Fergie et al have anything to offer? Personally, when the queen goes, like it or not our royal family will go. She can't be replaced as Charles will soon find out. The last thing we need is a 2nd class royal family &amp; a monarch head of state.
1308634187004628993 2020-09-23 13:07:58 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Norveilex It's not very nice on cornflakes. . . .
1308628355311431680 2020-09-23 12:44:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @StephStephi62 I agree, she will drop him and probably in the not too distant future. She will then likely marry someone incredibly rich and then drop him as well. The lady is working to an agenda !
1308627852850532352 2020-09-23 12:42:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SnowfakeN I meant to say Starmer was lower in the polls.
1308627308446658561 2020-09-23 12:40:38 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Diver__gent Yes, he too was a very weak person and was being pussywhipped by an American lady - Wallis Simpson. Edward Vlll quit in 1936
1308625553830928384 2020-09-23 12:33:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MartinDaubney @AndrewMapes007 I thought his religion precluded from drinking let alone pickling himself in the damned stuff.
1308624886286475265 2020-09-23 12:31:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AndrewKeyworth7 @talkRADIO Strange thing to say Andrew. How did you manage to read that into what I said. The people who break the rules are very simply the people who break the rules. I suspect the majority of people don't break them but there are those hell bent on doing so because they don't approve.
1308623454019694592 2020-09-23 12:25:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @radkins313 Yes he's just a pussy whipped liberal who does as he's told and she's trying to make herself noticed by insulting president Trump. As with so many liberals she thinks disparagement is the way forward. He's nothing she's a "B" rate actress, maybe even C.
1308622843261968385 2020-09-23 12:22:53 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Kay19Verukasult Don't be surprised Marilyn. The queen has been a wonderful asset to the UK but when you look at Royalty now its not terribly tremendous. Harry is no use at all, Andrew isn't much better, Charles talks to plants and only William seems to have the strength to be a royal. Its a mess
1308621622564335616 2020-09-23 12:18:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think Starmer isn't going to be long in place. Labour are now lower in the polls than they were when Corbyn was polluting everything.
1308620760118951937 2020-09-23 12:14:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Well worth reading although intelligent people are going to become infuriated at the so many ways the people of this country are being exploited. Its as if we work to provide lives for people who simply didn't like where they were. My vote goes to anyone who promises to end this.
1308619276929163264 2020-09-23 12:08:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Queen told to renounce royal title immediately as 'writing on wall' over monarchy's demise   I have no objection to the queen being replaced by an elected head of state if this is what the people want but the same goes for the house of lords.    https://t.co/wcRQjlVji3
1308618684861214720 2020-09-23 12:06:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Meghan Markle and Prince Harry decided to quit Royal Family after Queen’s ‘upsetting snub'  Can't take much more of this pair. What sad morons they are. Spoilt brats. Millionaires whining because granny didn't have their photos on her desk.     https://t.co/jzXKNd1EFZ
1308547170736443392 2020-09-23 07:22:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @talkRADIO He's right because at the moment other than common sense we have little to go on. The learning continues but the obeying doesn't because pub experts know best and continue refusing to keep distance or wear masks.
1308450538535690240 2020-09-23 00:58:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> BBC cuts off Boris Johnson coronavirus coverage ‘bad decision!’  With the BBC now censoring &amp; humiliating Boris like twitter does with president Trump, there can be no further tolerating these ignorant marxists. Put the boot in and close them down. News first to go.
1308443130832838663 2020-09-23 00:28:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> EU fears UK will leave with no deal ahead of last-ditch crunch talks.  A deal is impossible. We have to demonstrate to the EU that we cannot compete with them, have to surrender our fishing grounds, accept their ECJ laws which will keep the illegals here for ever. Walk away Boris
1308442106218897408 2020-09-23 00:24:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> What's Johnson said which you deem to be traitorous?  Has he said something you don't agree with?
1308441304855126020 2020-09-23 00:21:31 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Fairy_Woodland We need a government which can prune the country of these arseholes who do nothing but depress and annoy the majority. Of course the National Trust are behaving badly - they're getting it from other arses who think it good to put the country down. Its a man made left wing virus.
1308398410035232769 2020-09-22 21:31:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AFCBOldgit So was I. The shark would only encourage them to swim a little on the quick side and as it has no hands it couldn't use the grenades which would only be for ornamental reasons . . . Of FFS let's have an air rifle . . . .

1308363645009747968 2020-09-22 19:12:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DrAIR1 I frankly don't have a clue and as with you, all I can do is look at the conspiracy theories available and make my choice. One theory not yet put forward is that every time the planet is threatened it takes action. Perhaps its once again rendering all to common sense.
1308362685361381376 2020-09-22 19:09:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I hope I live long enough to see it happen.
1308362597180334082 2020-09-22 19:08:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When you hear people talk its quite clear that most are sick of the undisciplined state of our society. Particularly sick of the young with their stupid protesting &amp; wilful damage. I anticipate that soon people will be taking the law into their own hands to establish discipline.

1308073947263569924 2020-09-22 00:01:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Apparently channel crossing migrants are heading for Britain in increasing numbers because unlike France, in Britain they can get free, accommodation, food and internet use and they are finding the idea attractive which makes sense.

Shame about the 700,000,000 who have died over the centuries in religious wars.
1308019148438597632 2020-09-21 20:24:01 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Correction. For Pelosis read Pelosi.
1308018507779657729 2020-09-21 20:21:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> F.A.O. Pelosis &amp; Biden.   We have to warn you that any attempt by you to change any of your constitutions amendments, especially the 1st and the 2nd will result in Great Britain being unable to complete a trade deal with you.   See, you're not the only arseholes in the world.
1308011177604255744 2020-09-21 19:52:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Warnzwifey @Ella32823623 You show me it is propaganda with not an element of truth in it and I'll stop believing them. Shame about those now dying from the virus tho' many of whom did not believe the bullshit either.
1308010778960834567 2020-09-21 19:50:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ZokaShaun @Ella32823623 Tough if you happened to be one of the 0.1% eh. Still this is Britain, I'm OK, fuck everyone else. Pull the ladder up Jack, I'm aboard, let's go.
1308010032852881410 2020-09-21 19:47:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @lee71uk Because the experts tell us to wear them. They are not to protect the wearer but protect others by ensuring that breath droplets cannot be scattered everywhere. Why does something with no weight at all rise. Why does it not swirl around in the breeze. They disinfect streets!
1308008904169861121 2020-09-21 19:43:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @britaingone Try to find anyone who asked for this. . . .You have more chance of finding rocking horse shite. Our country was sold out so people like Blair could make fortunes and still he gets away with it and his illegal war.
1308008383249821696 2020-09-21 19:41:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DomScottish Of course, as you would imagine, the BBC has not yet admitted that it has hardly any viewers. I suppose even in Scotland they can't tolerate brainwashing from the SNP and the BBC.
1308007966411456514 2020-09-21 19:39:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Something many have believed for a very long time . . . . The BBC should be scrapped and commercialised, made to find its own money to give arses like Lineker £1.9 million per annum.    https://t.co/XMOXuNPzNa
1308000795598761984 2020-09-21 19:11:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DomScottish The only way to deal with the BBC, something which the government seems to not want to do, is continue the policy of jacking in the TV licence. Currently they are down almost £50 million and worse, youngsters spend more time on Youtube than watching the marxist BBC.
1307999924706041857 2020-09-21 19:07:38 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Whatever the situation is with Covid 19 its painfully obvious that measures taken to date have not proved effective. Either because they were the wrong measure or because people disobeyed them. Until we know the truth we need to do as we are told &amp; lay experts shut the f*** up.
1307995407570661376 2020-09-21 18:49:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson Prime Minister. In common with significant numbers of others I am tired of living in a country where there is no discipline and the law is broken not only with impunity but arrogance. If paramilitary uniforms are illegal then hammer those who were wearing them.
1307994333929443328 2020-09-21 18:45:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Kam67658103 Suggest you put prayer on the back burner. There are better things, in fact, there is only one thing and that is you having the strength to break what is a very serious addiction. Misery likes company and it may well be that mixing with others trying to stop will help. Try A.A.
1307992754774044672 2020-09-21 18:39:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> government allowed a parade - bordering on a riot,  of people wearing para military uniforms. They did nothing about it then &amp; still have done nothing about it. Perhaps its time for Mr Johnson to tell us whether the wearing of such uniform is illegal and if so why he did nothing.
1307991868433731585 2020-09-21 18:35:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @APWard4 @Luckyxmanda I thought it would remain a part of the United Kingdom. What did you think would happen to it?
1307989614444109825 2020-09-21 18:26:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @jimmyc_54 Are you pleased that the American presidential candidate has threatened Britain with no trade deal if we break "international law"? If you are its hypocrisy because Biden has promised to repeal 6 amendments of the American constitution including the 1st and 2nd.
1307988875453894656 2020-09-21 18:23:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @jimmyc_54 What a ridiculous things to say. There isn't a country in the Western world which keeps any international law unless it suits them. Putting any country before any law, international or otherwise is a duty and common sense.  International law is only another political club.
1307987423649988609 2020-09-21 18:17:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @oneisnotanumber I have often wondered why the elite are building up on the left but it's simple. If they control everything they can launch their new world order when their wealth will increase enormously. The left is a stepping stone to the globalism they need to do this.
1307986058957778945 2020-09-21 18:12:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Got to hand it to politicians. Through their ineptitude, lying, dishonesty and incompetence they have caused the vast majority of people to ignore them leaving the country open for plundering by them. Why should they change. Crime and dishonesty are paying fortunes.

1307984594457833472 2020-09-21 18:06:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Cub_Bearson Of course you are quite right but in my haste to insult and ridicule the BBC I did not give proper consideration to what I wrote. I am obliged to you for exposing my inaccuracy and grateful that we still have switched on, alert people even tho' they might be white. . . . . . . !
1307982227712729088 2020-09-21 17:57:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Fairy_Woodland Of course, look carefully at the photograph and once again, yet again we find that its the young - those without experience of most things who are coming up with the demands which in 5 years time they would swear hand on heart they had neither made nor supported no such demand.
1307981334594441217 2020-09-21 17:53:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Fairy_Woodland Let them take as many as they want and when they have decimated their economy, culture and religion, let's see how they cope. You cannot raise the standard of unlimited refugee lives without destroying the standard of life of those naïve enough to believe they could do this.
1307978280243531776 2020-09-21 17:41:37 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Going through the Express this morning looking for adjectives being used as article bait. Quite interesting. We have brutal, agony, crushing, backlash, erupts, terror, squirming and all used in an article describing a tea party for 6 year olds . . . . . . . . !!!

For sure she's the only one with any idea at all on this ludicrous situation - where the French have conned ­£114 million out of us for doing F**k all.   https://t.co/ji5twRu5H0
1307815145834414081 2020-09-21 06:53:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @M_D_Bird What we need is a new political system which puts power in the hands of the people and not the sort of power which exists only every 5 years for 30 days when baby kissing, hand shaking and 650 grovelling politicians are the norm.
1307780132401229825 2020-09-21 04:34:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I find it not only incredibly stupid but damned offensive than a group not elected by the people can obstruct a bill passed by those elected to do so. The Lords may have had use in the days of Magna Carta but today they are nothing but  tits in a trance.
1307776143601344514 2020-09-21 04:18:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Eleffcee @Roydini25 FBPE doesn't help your case. Clearly you find it difficult to interpret information.
1307775894577180672 2020-09-21 04:17:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Eleffcee @Roydini25 I am saying that. Anthrax can lay in the ground for a hundred years and then start again and I suspect that there are dozens of viruses doing just that and which are being woken up by a planet which is increasing in temperature. Which data do you suggest. Seems to be a lot of it.
1307764837683015681 2020-09-21 03:33:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It's cute the way that senile old fart Biden threatens no trade deal if we break international law, whilst he has promised to repeal six of the USA's Constitution amendments including the 1st and 2nd. What gross hypocrisy from this marxist who know not his arse from his elbow.
1307723216039940096 2020-09-21 00:48:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> In todays Online Express, under the description news, we find 32 articles, 27 of which are about royalty. I don't know which the express does best, censor or brownnose the royals. I suppose when all the censoring has been done there is only royalty to bullshit about.
1307715631500926985 2020-09-21 00:17:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Farage is saying that Johnson needs to be firing people who are obstructing him. He does but he won't in case they all turn on him and he's out on his ear. Politics in the UK are for the party members and elite and I hear you say what about the people. . . .well fuck the people.
1307714962945650689 2020-09-21 00:15:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DrMJMcGetrick Its also been a blot on honesty, integrity, patriotism, nationalism - It's where you find all the elite clocking in for each other so as to get their £500 per day allowances.
1307713921986580485 2020-09-21 00:11:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MalcolmConkers If they stopped the legal aid it would help. To me, regardless of what is said it looks as if the intention is to keep them here in the UK which is what the EU and UN want.
1307713619619196933 2020-09-21 00:09:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @FullEnglish11 @MelissaWatsonUK Agree entirely. The dross we have today throwing statues in harbours and carrying signs saying black lives matter would be 5/8ths the square of f*ck all use if called upon to defend either their country or themselves. They'd cry for a week if they had to wear boots.
1307660205350694912 2020-09-20 20:37:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If the frogs wanted to stop the illegal crossing of the channel it would be the easiest thing in the world for them to do. Without rubber boats and outboard engines no on goes anywhere and these things will come from a very limited number of sources making them easy to trace.

1307655648809754624 2020-09-20 20:19:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @footieisliving You raise a good point. I too am sick of these charities spending 10's of 1'000's on advertising to raise money for the executive 6 figure salaries and a little more for their charity. TV is a mass of adverts from charities and insurance companies touting for burial insurance !!!
1307654378929750017 2020-09-20 20:14:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Luckyxmanda @APWard4 I think that is a good point. If the EU can enforce the agreement and crap all over them then so be it. They wanted the EU and can't complain if or when they get it.
1307653815210999814 2020-09-20 20:12:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Eleffcee @Roydini25 Very impressed with your knowledge on pubs. 500,000,000,000 social interactions. Have you got the figures for schools, libraries, cinemas or is alcohol a prerequisite for you knowledge. . . . . .
1307652992510947329 2020-09-20 20:09:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Eleffcee @Roydini25 Until the incubation time and everything else is known about the virus you can carry on spouting figures till the cows come home. Accept one simple fact - very little is known about the virus otherwise it would have been dealt with and would not be a problem.
1307642824641384451 2020-09-20 19:28:38 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Entropy72 Yes there are way of dealing with them. Once upon a time they could reject a bill 3 times but because of their dreadful behaviour this was reduced to twice and now once but even so, they still have ways of dragging out the time. The house of old farts should be disbanded.
1307641938838007808 2020-09-20 19:25:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @borisjohnson @ElContador2000  Vote to get rid of these parasites. The Johnson bill &amp; the UK are far more important than these scrounging leaches. We need politics for the people, not for those who consider the people the interruption of their work instead of the reason for it.
1307638239965188105 2020-09-20 19:10:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @brenmccarthy131 Perhaps I am being a little unfair but I am so pissed off with these economic refugees ( I worked in Africa for 2½ years and have great experience of Africans ) and to bring them into Europe is lunacy. Maybe in a 100 years or so but not now. Many are dangerous.
1307637143972569089 2020-09-20 19:06:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @footieisliving Of course you are right. It is far more efficient to help people in their own country than take them to another leaving the problem behind with even less people to deal with it. However, vested interests want the European population diluted and this is what its all about.
1307636008628953088 2020-09-20 19:01:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The house of Lords are again threatening to obstruct a Boris Johnson's bill - this time the one to protect Northern Ireland from the EU which will almost certainly attempt to break them away from the UK.  Polls have shown the electorate want the Lords disbanded  Is now the time?
1307633841843167232 2020-09-20 18:52:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Polls have shown that the majority of British citizens want to see an end to the house of lords on the grounds that it's not democratic, achieves nothing &amp; costs millions which could be spent better elsewhere. Now they are again obstructing Boris. It's time they were disbanded.
1307630630214275072 2020-09-20 18:40:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Roydini25 Why would you say that. What is it about the transmission of viruses and infections you don't understand. Do you think the rapid increase in people contracting the Covid disease is China turning up the wick or is it that there is another reason.

1307248988945604614 2020-09-19 17:23:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> To show how much people have changed over just a few short years, consider social media. There is no way people would ever have tolerated the insults, political bias, control &amp; censorship which today is social media. They would have walked away en-masse  leaving behind nothing.

1306891416111640582 2020-09-18 17:42:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The annual budget should be fully explained by government and then people given the opportunity to amend it within reason. i.e. put an end to something which is lunacy such as foreign aid.

They are not for giving away. Britannia rules the waves &amp; the little fish beneath them. Over fishing like now is not sustainable. We must control our waters.
1306185322401800193 2020-09-16 18:57:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> A very worrying aspect of our fisheries is that they only account for a minute percentage of our GDP which makes them vulnerable in a deal. However, government would do well to remember it was only by decimating them in the first place they are now worth so little.

1305507486691098625 2020-09-14 22:03:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @rpeter99 The death penalty is justified by conduct like this and would make the world a much safer place. That woman could be brain damaged but this is Sweden where government prays 5 times a day and hates blondes. Besides which, it doesn't want to upset migrants !!!!!
1305506733335482368 2020-09-14 22:00:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The problem we have in this country and perhaps in other countries as well is that we don't believe it could possibly happen here. When the truth becomes unshakably apparent, the only thing left will be a civil war and governments know this but yet do nothing.

1305500657672216577 2020-09-14 21:36:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Whatever happens to Britain over the next 30 years is going to be the responsibility of those alive now. It may help to understand that those who are planning your future don't have you or your children in mind. You are the interruption of their work not the reason for it.
1305478321111805952 2020-09-14 20:07:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> We're losing our country and every child alive at this moment is going to be a resident of an Islamic state which will probably have Sharia law. Nothing wrong with this if its what the majority want. No doubt Blair will have taken up Islam by then and be standing as a Muslim MP.
1305476283606937602 2020-09-14 19:59:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AmberNectar_83 @defranklondon Organisation such as BLM are not going to be pressured or disbanded because they were created to achieve a certain thing which is disruption, confusion &amp; fear in society in the hope of driving it towards a new world order. Migration is used for the same reason.
1305475031347191809 2020-09-14 19:54:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> International law is an absolute crock. Its only followed where it does not cause pain or discomfort. Germany ignores so much of it its laughable (Germany now 'biggest breaker of EU rules', according to official figures) Johnson is right to do what is right for Britain.
1305474220823113733 2020-09-14 19:51:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> We have reached such a dreadful state in the world that its going to take severe and drastic action to put things right. There is absolutely no discipline and violence is the only answer. Don't like it then don't do it.
1305472275785940992 2020-09-14 19:43:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Good God above. What have they done to our once great country.  This is all part of an evil plan which seems to be working out very well.

It has now become painfully obvious that cultures don't mix, made even more difficult by one culture refusing to mix. We are bringing people to this country who are unhappy here and their protests will continue until they get what they want.
1305457335285043201 2020-09-14 18:44:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Grustlust @rpeter99 I think its about time the bloody European continent woke up and took its life back.

The Swedes are not the bravest of people and believe the way to deal with Rape and brutal assault is to ignore it. A Swedish quote is "The longest journey is the journey inward". They need to think about this.
1305455563053191168 2020-09-14 18:37:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> A while ago before Choudary went to prison (he seems to have learned from it - you never hear from him now) he told us how things would work out. What he said is quite accurate up to the present time, but will we have to become Muslims, have to have Sharia law. I'm scared!
1305454694186221569 2020-09-14 18:33:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Grustlust @rpeter99 Give me 1 month in charge and bastards like that would be so desperate to leave the country they'd swim sooner than face the consequences. Their hatred for white women is the warning we all ignore. This hatred will not go away. Currently its suppressed but it will surface.
1305454020903960577 2020-09-14 18:31:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I wonder how history will show the Sharia takeover in Britain or indeed, all of Europe. Islam is going to win a war without firing a shot. A rather impressive achievement. What will be left following their victory will probably not be too tremendous but it will be theirs.
1305453093543346176 2020-09-14 18:27:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @rpeter99 Good news is we now have BLM doing their thing as well. By God if ever we needed Iron Hand government or governments they're needed now. However, you won't get them because what's happening is all part of the agenda. If it weren't it would never be allowed. People must wake up.

The only question I have is why did our governments want this to happen and why did they allow it. Does Boris think these people are going to be grateful to him? Does Blair think there will be an "Order of Curry medal" in it for him?
1305448868847460353 2020-09-14 18:10:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> For £20 Twitter will sell you an app which will automatically unfollow those not following you. This is important because carrying unfollowers affects the number you can follow.   However, if you use it, this is what happens and they won't explain what they have done or why.  .  https://t.co/Lx8Ni9BZdB

Sharia to be the law &amp; the question most asked among the minority, "how the hell did we let this happen"?
1305445171270737927 2020-09-14 17:55:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Does anyone know if the person who took this video was arrested, having first been thrown to the ground? They don't like you videoing the invasion you know. . . . .
1305444619698790400 2020-09-14 17:53:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When these people are the dominant race I wonder when we are the refugees if they will treat us as well and you know full damned well what the answer is.
1305443993392742401 2020-09-14 17:51:16 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @EllEll01101 Well, being British, having no moral fibre, scared shit of political correctness, terrified of common purpose, worried the police will kick my door in at 3 a.m. if I say something they don't like, and scared of other cultures, I think I and everyone else would stay in the cage.
1305280798518652928 2020-09-14 07:02:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @EthnoPluralist @MissDomergue Should have kicked off ages ago. Our own children are being displaced by children from parents funded by benefits. In some cases four women in one family are producing children and none of them working. Sometimes the husband is not working either.
1305224474892132353 2020-09-14 03:18:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SamuelJJack The person who did this is brilliant. Shame he can't be acknowledged for his humour and skill. And what a coincidence - the same day Boris took control of London from Khan because he was making a pigs ear of everything. He should have fired Cressida Dick as well. She's useless.

1305147606050406402 2020-09-13 22:13:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Its really quite amazing, when politicians are in parliament they ignore those who put them there but when they lose their seats they still keep trying to talk to the people. Blair is the perfect example.
1305147292048076801 2020-09-13 22:12:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Look at the way Blair is behaving. He's desperate for publicity, desperate to have someone listening to him talk. His self esteem must be one million percent the square of F. All. There should be a law gagging politicians once no longer in parliament.
1305146377232691201 2020-09-13 22:08:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> When you see how politicians behave when they have lost their seats the real reason for them standing for parliament becomes crystal clear. Its not for those they purport to represent, it's because they are inebriated with the sound of their own voice &amp; to be in the limelight.
1305145168534872064 2020-09-13 22:03:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Sturgeon's nightmare! Orkney to follow Shetland in demanding independence from Scotland.  The stupid woman is making an arse of Scotland.

1305137753097678848 2020-09-13 21:34:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I'm very unhappy. Boris has taken control of London from Khan because he's been making such a dreadful cock up of things. What makes me unhappy is that without Khan London will no longer continue to attract the dross &amp; criminals which it did for so long. . . . . .

1305089774903062528 2020-09-13 18:23:44 +0800 <Jonteinspain> He'll probably get 18 months in prison of which he will servce 9 then another 20 years in the UK waiting for his deportment to be decided by the high court then another 10 years waiting for the appeal and the cost will be millions and we have a government proud of this.

Refugee ? He has a mobile phone, paid a fortune to get here, left his family behind. this shit has got to end or we get a government who will end it.

1305087467096281088 2020-09-13 18:14:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Clearly the work of another left wing moron. It's not funny, its not remotely true, its's not decent but it is indicative of a low life of which there are many on the left. The Arsehole even had the stupidity to sign it, possibly believing it will immortalise him.
1305086319337656320 2020-09-13 18:10:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Why did John Major receive a knighthood. He cost us billions with his fight against Soros &amp; has been whining &amp; obstructing the will of the people ever since they voted to leave the EU. Remove his knighthood! He makes a mockery of the honours system. Why did he ever get it ?????
1305072445473382406 2020-09-13 17:14:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Wsphamilton3 @scotty_kiker They were saying Allah. They were Pakistani's. This in my opinion is so wrong. Brainwashing and programming children at this age is wrong. Without experience of anything or with little or no knowledge they are going to accept what is hammered into them. They'll question nothing.

1305067014835372032 2020-09-13 16:53:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Any of these people can ask at any time to be returned to their own country but none do. They believe that benefits means not having to work - not assistance whilst looking or training for work. The cultural difference between Africa and Europe is enormous.
1305064500316471297 2020-09-13 16:43:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> One of the best quotes this year comes from former  MEP Rupert Lowe who hit out at ex-prime ministers Tony Blair &amp; Sir John Major after they condemned Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan.  Mr Lowe said: “Tony Blair &amp; John Major working together, what a team that is."

You've given away your country and culture to Islam but many of you think it should be your right to fish free in our waters.

1304514449898967041 2020-09-12 04:17:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I believe if the majority of Scots want to be independent then they should be. If they think life under Sturgeon will be better than being in the UK then it's probably best they do go. We'll save money &amp; then in 12 months when Sturgeon has trashed the country they can come back.

1304385688721387520 2020-09-11 19:45:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It's interesting.

1304158381188546561 2020-09-11 04:42:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I don't feel at all happy with this government. Its too far to the left, ignores the people and pursue agendas which it has not declared to the people. As with the May government, it too tells lies which can't possibly benefit the electorate.

If you say shit he says sugar if you say hot he says cold if you say up he says down.

1304156740183822337 2020-09-11 04:36:11 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The greatest problem suffered by politics is that it is carried out by politicians. There is not much about politics which is at all good. Not much very good about the average politician either.
1304110589766184960 2020-09-11 01:32:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @AlgernonOneShot I am increasingly of the opinion that only a right wing party is going to be able to save this country. The tories are about as left wing as Blair was and getting worse. Its always been those on the right who have steered us in the right direction and built our economy.
1304102587608772608 2020-09-11 01:01:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Governments use of a weak police force to protect their operation of UN agenda 21 is doing damage to an already knee bending, trouble avoiding, violent with the elderly, shamed police force and pruning Tory voters at an impressive rate. And they're not going to stop for anyone.
1304099758869544960 2020-09-11 00:49:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The last census held in Britain was 2011 where the population answered questions on a variety of subjects or face prosecution. With so many illegals now living in this country is it justified in holding anymore?
1304098286475804678 2020-09-11 00:43:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @theboldpig @grahamwrnr I read it's 66 million but haven't seen the lunchtime  migrant boat figures yet . . . . . Nor do I and anyone else, apart from government, know the true likely figures of illegals in our country so therefore cannot know the true figure.
1304097006118412288 2020-09-11 00:38:49 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @grahamwrnr @theboldpig I agree. I am doubtful about most of the figures and know why some of them are wrong. However, in the absence of anything else other than government experts, common sense tells us we have little alternative but to follow their advice. People are dying and will continue to die.
1304051954432331777 2020-09-10 21:39:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> F.A.O. "Foreign Secretary"  Any chance soon that you will be telling us the truth about illegal migrants who you are going to stop but for whom you have awarded contracts for the next ten years to companies to look after them. I dislike you more than May. @pritipatel
1304041537198841862 2020-09-10 20:58:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Following the Dover protest last weekend we now see that groups of 6 or more people are not allowed. I assume the hundreds pouring across the border in their rubber boats are exempt. If necessary government will lock down the country to enable illegal migration to continue.
1304040751333023746 2020-09-10 20:55:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The old vet was lucky that three quarters of the police were down on one knee paying homage to BLM. It could have been a lot worse for him had they all piled on top of him.
1304039547630649344 2020-09-10 20:50:30 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Look at this. This is how government treat an old man because he dares to gently express concern over the illegals pouring into his country. Illegal migrants are doing great damage, almost as much as Patel and Johnson are doing to the Tory party.  https://t.co/D8EaF8BXds
1304030971407282183 2020-09-10 20:16:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @finland_uk They've gone but the thing I find so worrying is the governments total, out in the open conduct of encouraging illegal migrants to come to this country and their preventing anyone from trying to stop them. Illegal migrants are government policy and they will continue with it.
1304022591846461440 2020-09-10 19:43:08 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Our giovernment must be illegally  involved with bringing illegals into this country. Anyone doing anything to try to prevent them is harassed or arrested. We need a review into government dishonesty on migration. We have more migrants than any other EU country.
1304018527398043648 2020-09-10 19:26:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @EveleenWinters Sounds like he grew up without the benefit of the odd good hiding.
1304014080685101056 2020-09-10 19:09:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Interesting - the people being most affected by Covid are the 20 - 30s - the age group of those who ignore the rules because they know better. The least affected are pensioners, probably because their lifestyle is a type of lock down. It seems Covid has returned with a vengeance.
1303986028957626369 2020-09-10 17:17:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @petesufc It was a few hundred years ago. Today its nothing but a public holiday which shuts down industry and a time when people buy people things they can't afford for people who don't want them and which could have been obtained for a fraction of the price in the sales which follow.

1303668192624205828 2020-09-09 20:14:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Its difficult to predict anything a government does but I predict that Patel will promise to deal with violent, wealthy, illegal migrants 3 months before the next election. I also predict that in reality she will do nothing which is her norm. She is a nothing person.

It's taken 100's  of years to reach this state &amp; they are not going to change any time soon. We see terrible violence from them - a Somali ran amok with a knife in Birmingham on Saturday killing a person. They are unsafe. Why are they here?

At the moment it looks as if you are complaining about something which needs to happen. Unless of course you can show differently.
1303660905629126656 2020-09-09 19:45:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Jamielear1 Agreed, If they want to work for the government then let the government pay them. From time to time I've seen articles about the RNLI and its management don't seem to be very nice people at all. Six figure executives flogging &amp; bullying volunteers mercilessly.

Violent, inbreeding is high, crime is rife, particularly piracy, disease runs rampant &amp; yet Somalis can find thousands of pounds to pay for illegal trips to the UK. When they arrive we know nothing about them at all but let them in
1303656346768805895 2020-09-09 19:27:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DJStevoz They wouldn't arrive. They would either be arrested or sunk at sea. I had no idea they were given given phones. I suppose this is so the government can organise them when the fight for the new world order starts.
1303650729098448896 2020-09-09 19:05:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @davidkurten @David79034977 Fine then you come up with an answer to the problem because the world's experts don't seem to have been able to. Tell us what you suggest and who agrees with you.
1303650351296450560 2020-09-09 19:03:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The fact that the EU gave Canada a trade agreement but won't give it to Britain must be all the proof anyone needs to realise this is not about trade but about control. You can say what you want do what you want but if I control your food you'll do as I say. This is the EU game!
1303649801800749056 2020-09-09 19:01:48 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The trade talks we are having are all bullshit. They are political and nothing to do with trade. What can the EU gain by refusing to agree an agreement because we won't let them control us. Any deal for them would be better than none but as stated this is political.
1303648721092124675 2020-09-09 18:57:30 +0800 <Jonteinspain> No deal it is! Juncker says Brexit talks WILL end in failure and UK to split with no pact .  So good to see Juncker up &amp; about. Do you know I didn't know he drank until I saw him sober one day. He must have finished his rehabilitation? Life will be much better not throwing up.
1303640052858261504 2020-09-09 18:23:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Isn't it vile the way government have conned the RNLI into rescuing criminals in the channel who are in no danger &amp; even if they were, knowingly put themselves there. We fund the RNLI &amp; they are now crapping on us. Something they need to remember when the begging letters go out.
1303638754129842176 2020-09-09 18:17:54 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @simonxj6 @Made_In_Ulster @SteveLaws19 No it will probably have mandatory Islam tho and the problems with this controlling, far right organisation will continue until it gets what it wants which is not a new world order.
1303638218261266433 2020-09-09 18:15:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SteveLaws19 I doubt most will be at all surprised. To be able to hijack 4 star hotels to be used for the accommodation of illegal migrants and issue 10 year contracts (proving this is going to continue for at least 10 years) has to end in either Downing street or parliament square.
1303637377269870593 2020-09-09 18:12:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @SeaBell15 @SteveLaws19 He certainly is. Wish we had a few more who could and would do something and are capable of using an independent brain.

If a husband is beating crap out of his wife, having her employer allow her to sit at her desk for 24 hours a day is hardly a solution. But there, it wasn't meant to be. Just more advertising for the stupid woman.
1303414655453454338 2020-09-09 03:27:24 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Stupid woman. Now she wants social services to be taken up by employers, most of whom are hanging on by the skin of their teeth. Can't these wretched politicians find something useful to say when they are desperate for PR.

1303313143087722502 2020-09-08 20:44:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @RllPAA Because Boris &amp; the stout, getting stouter Patel don't want to deport them. They want more here &amp; are bringing them here. Worse, inbreeding among Somalis is high &amp; in many cases mental health has been compromised. As in the case of the Somali knife man in Birmingham.

Ignored as anticipated. Soon we are going to run out of hotels. Then what?
1303292503412609025 2020-09-08 19:22:01 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @julieAn34464628 @PaulaGilling I agree. Government don't care and the police are not capable. We are without constructive leadership, crime is exploding and its now quite obvious that this is all part of the plan to pull the people down in preparation for the new world order which is going to save us all.

However, the morons, thugs, and retards screaming black lives matter have done more to damage black people than has been done in the past 50 years. We're sick of it &amp; them.

1303283182805094400 2020-09-08 18:44:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JenTheSurvivor Jen, we all feel for you &amp; detest the people responsible, who for reasons unknown do not seem to get deported if born elsewhere. There is not and has never been a punishment which adequately fits the crimes perpetrated against you and I urge you to continue exposing these people.

1303111808358678529 2020-09-08 07:24:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Government says criminals are helping migrants to cross the channel and yet having a large police force, MI5, MI6 a border guard &amp; much more there has never been a single prosecution of a trafficker. Not one. The cynical among us could be forgiven for thinking something stinks !!

When Britain is a Muslim republic, Buckingham Palace is the world's biggest mosque, Christianity is illegal, grooming and rape is not illegal if used on non believers, then how the hell does Johnson and his mob benefit from this?
1303011259730800642 2020-09-08 00:44:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MichelleWaddup Feel free and may you have very many happy tweets using it.
1303008576353513473 2020-09-08 00:33:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> People try so hard to convince us that their way of life is correct, that true freedom is no responsibility, a numb police force or no police force at all and yet, how many of these people are happy. Virtually none, they don't know how to be happy. It was never taught them.
1303007991885492224 2020-09-08 00:31:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Vivienn34776861 I agree. We live in a world without discipline. No discipline at school, at work and often none in the home. No discipline equals no control and no control equals rising crime and violence as we have. We need strong discipline and national service. Then people are happy.

1302931610787090432 2020-09-07 19:27:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JenTheSurvivor Nothing offends, outrages, sickens or infuriates me more than grooming and rape of children, other than the governments lethargy in dealing with it. The suppression of the grooming and rape report on the grounds that it would not be in the best interest of the people is bilious.
1302930134484254720 2020-09-07 19:22:05 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Up to 1.2 million illegal immigrants are estimated to be living in Britain, the highest number of any country in the EU the Pew Research Centre claims. Germany is 2nd because it too has a generous benefits system. Language no doubt figures when it comes to choosing a destination
1302924324693835778 2020-09-07 18:59:00 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Dear Mz Patel,  Can you tell us the cost of illegal migrants &amp; how much this cost increases every month. How many have you deported &amp; why are you allowing them to come here at all when they are not refugees but criminals.    Have you always considered the electorate to be idiots?

1302647561011027968 2020-09-07 00:39:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Remember when the grooming &amp; rape report was completed &amp; Johnson said it was not appropriate for the country to know the truth so he would have another one written which was more appropriate. . . .Anyone seen that yet. . . .? Of course not. Farage give us one more chance please.
1302644398308691968 2020-09-07 00:26:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @STEVEFR82719612 Not with an 80 seat majority. They will have no fear of a no confidence vote. They will continue their plundering of our country, relying on our lethargy and indolence to prevent us from doing what should and must be done.
1302643481421197319 2020-09-07 00:23:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Being a lifelong tory I voted conservative but it was a mistake, although I claim forgiveness because what I was told was tory was nothing of the kind. We have a government in power whose sole skill seems to have been in passing off as tory when in fact they're grubby globalists.
1302641524006674434 2020-09-07 00:15:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think one of the worst things about this government is the lies have continued. We all thought a new broom would sweep clean but we got the same grubby broom. Now we just have to wait for the grand brexit betrayal which is on the way accompanied by 10's of 1,000's of migrants.
1302640778792103936 2020-09-07 00:12:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Boris, good advice would be to fire Patel now whilst people will still believe its her fault we are being flood with undesirable migrants. Leave it for much longer and everyone is going to know its you working to UN agenda 21.
1302640392089763855 2020-09-07 00:10:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @LSadler16861851 @Bella___Trixxx I think the debt can be blamed on covid but they have lied so much about the virus that nothing they say can be taken seriously or believed. If the people do not make their anger known they will lose everything, there is an evil agenda afoot.
1302589834473730048 2020-09-06 20:49:52 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Hello Priti . . .Boris here. "The peasants are getting damned unpleasant about these illegal migrants and I can't see how we can keep bringing them in after Dec 31st without trouble so just take another 50,000 &amp; then we'll look for other ways to bring them in" . . .
1302585529226211328 2020-09-06 20:32:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @MillsDavid54 You are sadly, probably correct. Perhaps not exactly as you say but more than likely so close as to make no difference. I beg the people of this country to wake up and demand to be heard. The longer we leave Johnson the more we are going to lose. If you have kids its tough.
1302580611207573504 2020-09-06 20:13:13 +0800 <Jonteinspain> We voted Conservative but we did not get a conservative government. Conservatives do not tolerate statues being destroyed, culture being decimated, the police cowering in front of protesters, streets full of rioting people, assaults on our borders, insults from foreign countries.
1302578134441656326 2020-09-06 20:03:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Dear Prime Minister,  To enter Britain illegally, having paid others to assist you is a crime. Criminals are arrested &amp; jailed but you take them 4 star hotels and give them our money. Why?  We have asked &amp; demanded you stop this but you won't. Why?  Sincerely,  The electorate.
1302565440212828160 2020-09-06 19:12:56 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ashishsengupta In truth, countries were there are numerous political parties don't fare much better either simply because governments cannot be formed so corruption and bribery are used to buy support. It looks as if a patriotic, benevolent dictator is what is required.
1302564911550205952 2020-09-06 19:10:50 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ashishsengupta To use the word democracy about our society is somewhat farcical. Nothing is democratic about giving people the right to plunder our country, destroy our culture and heritage and after all that tug the forelock and call them sir. Farage is right. We need a new party.
1302564126091292673 2020-09-06 19:07:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I've seen government criticised as being "Woke" which is the act of being PRETENTIOUS about how much you care about a social issue but they don't give a shit about anything be it illegal migrants, corruption, knife crime, violence, ritual slaughter, grooming &amp; rape.   Sickening!
1302562721569951744 2020-09-06 19:02:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I thought our "police" had been told not to go down on one knee. Mind you, that was probably just even more bullshit and dishonesty from the Stout Patel who has yet to tell the truth. Beginning to wonder if even her name is Patel.
1302559025305976833 2020-09-06 18:47:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Wonder what she's sitting on. . . . .she'll be back to his four star hotel before his stethoscope has cooled down.
1302558047034900481 2020-09-06 18:43:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Zara_Bukake_MP @Ronnie62597744 This is a piss take surely. How has her name become a parody account?
1302556173837705216 2020-09-06 18:36:06 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The primary problem this country has is its habit of voting for the party which is the least evil. It can't vote for the best party because there isn't one. British politics for too long has concerned surrendering the country to the party which hopefully will do the least damage.
1302555085965275138 2020-09-06 18:31:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Birmingham major incident: 1 dead and 7 injured after stabbing rampage  London, Birmingham &amp; dozens of other places suffer knife crime. When is this wretched government going to understand the need for discipline in society. Government is destroying us.   https://t.co/iQlwm5QNxI
1302400797720883200 2020-09-06 08:18:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Nigel Farage. You are right, you were always right. Johnson is going to betray us over Brexit, is flooding the country with illegals and is working to an agenda nobody wants. Please come back. We need a patriot party.
1302400312142168064 2020-09-06 08:16:46 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @pazzalou It seems that way. If they are not stopped there is going to be nothing left for anyone in this country. We are being treated with contempt &amp; the piss taken to the extreme. This government cares fuck all about anything other than self. What a mistake I made voting tory.
1302396963497881601 2020-09-06 08:03:28 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Videoing illegal migrants coming ashore can get you arrested. Ask the police what the crime is and they refuse to tell you. Clearly government are bringing these people into the country at great expense to our people and country and have no intention of stopping. Kick them out.
1302395964347514888 2020-09-06 07:59:29 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @StampOutSatan You're a bit weird lady. What is there to be scared of in a perfectly decent, hygienic disposal of a human body. WTF have whales got to do with your rambling.The thing to worry about is whether or not there is a God. Or is it Allah or Budah or etc or nothing at all.
1302395137142779905 2020-09-06 07:56:12 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Patriots and concerned Britons are trying to defend the Kent coast from illegal migrants despite huge amounts of police trying to allow the illegals into the country. Government has betrayed us and has no difficulty with our knowing. Help the patriots in Kent.
1302393937005629443 2020-09-06 07:51:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> It's quite clear this government is doing little other than take its salary and expenses. The people need to take back control of this country before everything is lost. To ignore illegal migrants despite 80% of the country up in arms about them shows government does not care.
1302354414779469830 2020-09-06 05:14:23 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Neither Johnson or patel will explain why people videoing illegal migrants get arrested nor why crime they have committed. This is very dangerous and removes even more of the little freedom we have left. Demand answers or lose everything.
1302353743854350336 2020-09-06 05:11:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If you're not happy now think how bad things are going to be in 5 years time. Johnson and Patel are bringing in illegals as quickly as they can and won't say why. This government is not good and I say that as a life long conservative. Why is it illegal to video illegals landing?

1302342295510036482 2020-09-06 04:26:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @RevDem And why should criminals be put into 4 star hotels? They are breaking the law and entering Britain illegally. I think its time that this government knew that it is not representing the majority of the people but rather pissing them off.
1302341810589773825 2020-09-06 04:24:18 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @RevDem To me it seems he has always been playing the game of "waiting for as long as possible" before giving in. His dreadful lethargy regarding illegal migrants speaks volumes. If these people knew that as soon as they set foot in Britain they would be jailed they would not come.
1302276470597914624 2020-09-06 00:04:40 +0800 <Jonteinspain> A few years ago American movies went through a bad patch where in every Movie, a Sheriff, Marshal, President, C.E.O, Judge, Top lawyer, cop or even a white man had to be black.
1302273858343444481 2020-09-05 23:54:17 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Looking forward to the presidential debate between Trump and Biden but understand the democrats have requested Biden be allowed to be substituted for a horses arse. . . . . . .
1302273230179360768 2020-09-05 23:51:47 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If Biden does not have Alzheimer's then there is no such thing as Alzheimer's. Senile old fart. I suppose the democrats think they are going to win by cheating with the postal vote. Or perhaps rioting outside the white house until Trump surrenders.
1302272089525813248 2020-09-05 23:47:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Buzzard_Stubble @GreggJarrett Even the MSM must realise that they are making fools of themselves with Biden. Even CNN . . . . .
1302271538566246400 2020-09-05 23:45:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @blane1122 @GreggJarrett Can you imagine Biden negotiating with China. . . . . OK you can have what you want but how much does my son get. . . . .
1302271281551814657 2020-09-05 23:44:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ChristineBurgum @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump He would be able to speak properly if he knew what he was speaking about. Jesus wept, democrats must be in an awful state to have to field something as feeble as Biden. Clinton written off and no one else so it had to be Biden. If he is elected he will have retired in a week.
1302270623205515267 2020-09-05 23:41:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @CodyIsAGoodBoy @GreggJarrett @realDonaldTrump Oh you mean corruption like the democrat purchased false report from ex MI6 agent David steele or do you mean the collusion which never was with Russia. Wait perhaps you mean impeachment which also failed. You sir are a dickhead of enormous proportions. You'll never find comfort.

1302228074067562496 2020-09-05 20:52:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Labour warning: Red Wall Tory MP says Leave voters will ‘never forgive’ betrayal.  If Johnson betrays us he will launch a new political party probably led by Farage which will do to the tories what the tories did to the National liberal Party in 1923.     https://t.co/pTqOVM5V9l
1302192413180596224 2020-09-05 18:30:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Bromleyswap If there was no deal there should be no payment but with Johnson, who I put on a par with prince harry, i suspect he will fall over and throw the money at them just after he has given away our fishing grounds, Northern Ireland, legal system and pulled a brilliant BRINO.
1302191894580146177 2020-09-05 18:28:35 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Hoping for a victory from Johnson in regard to a trade deal? Ask yourself this question. Do you really think a man who can't stop 1,000's of illegals from breaking into Britain &amp; costing millions is going to be able to deal with the EU or really has any intentions of doing so.
1302191029051891715 2020-09-05 18:25:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @EC2man @BeastmodeBox Exactly what I think. It's as if he believes that if he can hold out to the end of the year before falling over then he will have been PM for a year. The lack of negotiating by Britain points to a rapid surrender at the last minute. I too hope I am wrong.
1302188563883319296 2020-09-05 18:15:21 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Good heavens, the man is inarticulate, ill informed, inaccurate and its incredible that a political party could support him. You must have to be pretty dumb to vote democrat.
1302187883181363200 2020-09-05 18:12:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> BLM are a pain in the arse and not too bright but don't blame them for being manipulated by the MSM and democraps. The belief among these crooks is that people won't vote for Trump in a country full of riots.   How wrong they are!
1302187048149934085 2020-09-05 18:09:20 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Dear God, what a sick, vile state California is. Is it full of paedophiles because if not how the hell did legislature like that get passed. It really is true. voting for democrats is a pain in the arse. Well it is for consenting children, if indeed children can consent legally.
1302186083686506496 2020-09-05 18:05:30 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @andersleijersta @Deedy2201 I keep asking this question about TV adds. There isn't a single family depicted which does not have a Black husband, white wife, brown Muslim children and dozens of illegal migrants as close friends. . . . . Puzzling to say the least.
1302184711469461510 2020-09-05 18:00:03 +0800 <Jonteinspain> You would expect this sort of thing from such miserable dross whose primary achievement are in failing. If they don't criticise everything, they have no publicity or proof that they are alive. Ask yourself this, would you trust any of these with anything ? Of course not.
1302184095145918464 2020-09-05 17:57:36 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Much more so than Britain, the EU need a deal. However, they believe that Johnson is going to fall over and give them more or less what they want because he is weak and unable to cope with a no deal. If we hold out we will win. The German car industry will see to it. . . . . !
1302168833361358850 2020-09-05 16:56:57 +0800 <Jonteinspain> For normal healthy people this is a wonderful achievement. For the msm and the democrats this is something to attack, misrepresent, lie about. Pray God we see Trump returned to the White House.
1302168086334898177 2020-09-05 16:53:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Amazing. I thought the left would riot and scream and stamp their feet and bang their heads and set fire to things as they do when they negotiate but no. . . . amazing. We made rare progress for once.
1302166346218844160 2020-09-05 16:47:04 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @HisHolyLord The voting figures are directly proportional to the population of these countries. Was this a joke of sorts?
1302164925234778112 2020-09-05 16:41:25 +0800 <Jonteinspain> You know harry and his pussy whipper were going to repay the £2.4 MILLION spent on his residence fit for a prince and paid for by you. . . . . .well he didn't repay it. Instead he bought himself a slum in the USA costing £10 MILLION. Everybody takes the piss out of us. . . .

1302028780417028096 2020-09-05 07:40:26 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @regthorne Yes it has &amp; only the people can stop it. Government think if people are not out on the streets rioting or protesting then they approve. We're not down at the Dover docks in the millions objecting so the government continue to bring the illegals in. Only the people can stop it.
1302027549313245184 2020-09-05 07:35:32 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I have no trust or confidence in this government which is going to betray us any time now. The rising numbers of migrants breaking into the country indicates that this government is not competent or fit for purpose and our only hope is to see it gone and Farage replace it.

1302024876669181955 2020-09-05 07:24:55 +0800 <Jonteinspain> I think the situation with illegal migrants has reached a point where our people can no longer ignore it. We don't know why government want these people here only that they are aiding and abetting them. We don't want them and it appears until this government goes they won't stop.

However, they are being encouraged.
1302022774991585280 2020-09-05 07:16:34 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @DavidLammy Stupid sod. It was Britain for hundreds of years before it had a single refugee. . . . .

1301963127941206017 2020-09-05 03:19:33 +0800 <Jonteinspain> With Murdoch planning a news channel and Andrew Neil and Nigel Farage also planning a news channel it may well be that we'll see the end to the BBC and Sky Marxist, biased news. We may even see the end to Kate Burleys facelifts - currently on no 7 now.

When the report is available are we going to be told its not in the public interest for it to be published, as was the case with the grooming and rape report ?

Two more precocious brats I have never known and only a good thrashing is going to save them from themselves.
1301875274808688640 2020-09-04 21:30:27 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Good how the EU demand we cripple ourselves and agree not to help out British companies because it would make life difficult for the EU. Remember when the wankers poured millions into a failing Airbus. . .Oh hush my mouth, shouldn't have said that. . . . . . . . !!!
1301872723090694147 2020-09-04 21:20:19 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Twitter has been giving me hell - behaving in a way it has never behaved. It was virtually unusable. After a lot of struggle I followed the advice of a friend and deleted cookies which immediately put everything to rights. God knows why tho'.
1301871565425041409 2020-09-04 21:15:43 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @dave33cabdriver I know much of what there is to know about him. The 73-year-old weather forecaster &amp; climate change denier is responsible for setting up the controversial weather forecasting business Weather Action, through which he sells his predictions. I agree with him on climate denial.
1301868077320151044 2020-09-04 21:01:51 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Worried by Barnier saying that all fish in British waters are EU fish I today swam out into the north sea and carried out a poll of 1,500 billion fish and as I thought, all claimed they were British fish.
1301851314838736898 2020-09-04 19:55:15 +0800 <Jonteinspain> A racist and a thicko who don't seem to know that chips did not appear in England until 1860. Carry on trying to change history you thick sods. As for you lineker, prepare to receive your P45 people are not going to spend fortunes paying you for much longer.
1301831040735096832 2020-09-04 18:34:41 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @bout_yee I can't see why May ever agreed to this stupid deal with Ireland. The idea clearly was to put pressure on the North to join with the South. Only the north seemed to realise at the time how crass this idea was. N.I is British. F*ck the marxist EU!
1301826680856760320 2020-09-04 18:17:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> To hell with the EU. Go W.T.O. &amp; keep Northern Ireland as British and not an EU lackey calculated to create trouble and difficulty for Britain. The EU is going to fail so I don't begin to see why a deal is at all important. Save money. No 39 billion, go now. make everyone happy.
1301825892025589760 2020-09-04 18:14:14 +0800 <Jonteinspain> The complete reason for the failure of the trade talks with the EU is simply because we won't give them our fish and we won't agree to cripple our commerce and industry so it is unable to compete with EU. This being the case there is no compromise possible so why don't we go now.
1301825050107154432 2020-09-04 18:10:53 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @desktopwurds Their fisheries management is about as effective as the common agricultural policy where every Frenchman has a window box and claims tens of thousands of euros in farming subsidies. The C.A.P. is the reason food is so expensive. Huge subsidies go to the French constantly.
1301824574200446977 2020-09-04 18:08:59 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @StevieTheFixer Labour, conservative, libdungs, it doesn't matter who is in office because the system is so flawed that it is worse than useless. MPs are elected for their benefit not the benefit of the electorate. Its been a long time since government stood up for this country.
1301823913006112769 2020-09-04 18:06:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @Bromleyswap The thing which the EU don't like is Boris not going along with the level playing field which effectively means government can't help a company be more successful because EU industry is so inefficient it can only remain competitive with tariffs helping them.

1301808983452327937 2020-09-04 17:07:02 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Once Britain has regained control of its waters we should be able to practice intelligent, honest stock preservation. The first thing to do is kick out the factory ships &amp; trawlers netting hundreds of tons  of fish each day. The EU fishing policy has been fraudulent.
1301808060676083712 2020-09-04 17:03:22 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Its impossible to deal with the EU because they want to tie Britain's hands preventing us from investing in our future and supporting our commerce and industry. We are poised for massive inroads into Space &amp; government must be able to help those involved as it sees fit.
1301807377356906497 2020-09-04 17:00:39 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Don't laugh but the Barnier frog has just agreed that the waters surrounding the UK belong to the UK. However . . . . and wait for it . . . .  he says the fish belong to the EU . . . . .in fairness I did see a shoal of cod carrying EU passports only yesterday . . . . .

So there !!
1301472949384499201 2020-09-03 18:51:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Well, twitter certainly seem to have screwed it up now. There is no logic whatsoever to the way it operates, just pages of photographs of people saying they retweeted, liked or followed you. Can't find any continuity at all. It must be a way to inconvenience president Trump.

My vote goes to the party who says there will be discipline, the police will not be attacked, women will be safe, the law will be obeyed our borders will be protected.

1301185539027210241 2020-09-02 23:49:42 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @FixedWingGuy This treatment of the people is calculated to ensure that when the right moment comes government will be able to instantly get people to run indoors and hide from a virus whilst foreign troops occupy our streets and if its not that, tell me what it is:
1301185047177949184 2020-09-02 23:47:44 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @JDGhost4 No point in fining them. It won't stop them. The police much prefer to chase motorists rather than criminals because motorists are not dangerous and want to keep the law as opposed to wanting to see it trashed.
1301184549033046018 2020-09-02 23:45:45 +0800 <Jonteinspain> Whatever his name, if he'd said it was Winston or Abdul he would not even have been charged. further, at 73 he was hardly going to be considered dangerous. They'll probably hammer him for not having a tv licence as well. How can 58 million people be treated as a minority?
1301119965005778949 2020-09-02 19:29:07 +0800 <Jonteinspain> @ImScaryBullFrog Quite right. In common with others I have my faults but being wrong is not one of them . . . . .

Those who are followed by only a few don't really have a voice. Further many of those you claim are "begging" for followers are doing so because they had large accounts closed by Shitter.
1300943055789404161 2020-09-02 07:46:09 +0800 <Jonteinspain> If Donald Trump wins this election, which he will if the average American has an i.q. exceeding his shoe size, it is to be hoped that he waste no time in trashing an indecently dishonest media which has done great harm to the USA. Trashing Soros might be a good idea as well.
