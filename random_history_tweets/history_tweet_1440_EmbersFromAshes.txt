Are you able to prevent your ex from having the kids due to his refusal to wear a mask? Sure seems you could make a case for child endangerment!
1343776488202534913 2020-12-29 12:30:55 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kma2800002 @alt_uscbp @MdSheryl It's horribly irresponsible for a 1st responder that is likely frequently exposed to patients with covid to not wear a mask when visiting others not in their household. I'm so sorry your ex put you and your children at risk like this! 🤬
1343775320642527237 2020-12-29 12:26:17 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kma2800002 @alt_uscbp @MdSheryl My hubby's a FF Medic who's been working 72-96 hour shifts due to coworkers testing + for covid. He's been wearing an N95 even when sleeping to avoid bringing the virus home as I'm high risk (firehouse is communal) . He got the vaccine today but it won't change his mask habits.
1343765425654382592 2020-12-29 11:46:58 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Julia48395848 @alt_uscbp @MdSheryl So many refuse to wear the mask right even tho everyone knows how to wear it correctly. When in line between 2 people wearing them under their noses I try to create more than the 6' between us. Saying anything to them just usually infuriates them. I rarely go out &amp; always mask.

1339535973655269376 2020-12-17 19:40:38 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ThatEricAlper Probably Aerosmith, Montrose, or BOC, not sure which was my earliest fave.

1339490302625660929 2020-12-17 16:39:09 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MTrued @jaketapper His insisting that states "Liberate", open schools, churches, and retail even though they didn't meet CDC guidelines for doing so was a dead giveaway as well.
1339489609441415170 2020-12-17 16:36:24 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RicardoWinters8 @jaketapper Well we need to expedite karma with some prosecutions.
1339487816934309888 2020-12-17 16:29:16 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LorenaDigital @jaketapper With Trump's eager consent, you know it wasn't just Alexander, though Trump will try to blame it all on him.
1339486060225593344 2020-12-17 16:22:17 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MalcolmNance All the "Liberate" tweets and insistence on opening schools, churches, and retail, despite the cities &amp; states not meeting CDC criteria for opening. The refusal to wear a mask and mocking people who did, all designed to encourage infection.
1339485343939133441 2020-12-17 16:19:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MalcolmNance I'm not even former military intelligence and have been saying for months that Trump's rallies were set up to intentionally spread the virus. Think the 2 weeks before election were more a payback for his low poll #s but before that it was a herd immunity strategy. Nobody listens.
1339483616103911424 2020-12-17 16:12:35 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ANNSISCO1 Especially since many of the "loans" are designed not to be paid back. This amounts to a donation of tax payer dollars to a religious organization and I don't believe that's even legal! I'm atheist and don't want my tax $ donated to any religious/faith based organization!! 🤬
1339482678530166785 2020-12-17 16:08:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ANNSISCO1 It really is well passed time to tax churches. They shouldn't have qualified for PPP program since they're tax exempt. Their employees are paid with the huge amounts they take in from donations they pay no tax on &amp; donors write off on their taxes so should get no fed funding.
1339463970894147586 2020-12-17 14:54:31 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mcs3289 @ABC I lost any faith in her well before that.

No. She praised "dear leader" for being so attentive to science 🤮🤮🤮 Trump wouldn't understand the science of tying his shoes, much less be attentive to it, he just pays someone else to do it &amp; give him credit for it. Birx is nothing but a sycophant afraid of being fired.
1339458780447182848 2020-12-17 14:33:53 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @citizenwillis @Perduesenate I'm offended by @Perduesenate using knowledge gained in secret meetings about a pandemic to sell &amp; buy stocks!

He should have accepted the WHO's test formula instead of insisting we develop our own! He shouldn't have given our PPE stockpile to China. He should've worn a damned mask, not politicized it. He's a huge FAILURE!
1339442702228713473 2020-12-17 13:30:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Scottgas2 @Kevswatching @TheBlondeRN Trump knew about the virus, how deadly it could be, and method &amp; rapidity of spread in January but did nothing but ignore, downplay, and bald face lie about it for months! He should have used the playbook left by the previous administration on dealing with/preventing a pandemic.
1339438857972981761 2020-12-17 13:14:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @beejmwbee @IShantBelieveIt @TheBlondeRN This isn't correct. Contaminated needle stick injuries, contact with the patient's blood on non-intact skin, blood or other bodily fluids coming in contact with eyes were the most common cause of patient to caregiver transmission, no sex involved.

1339415051007008771 2020-12-17 11:40:07 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @malcolmkenyatta I said this months ago, that his rallies were designed to intentionally spread the virus. The 2 weeks prior to the election I believe they were actually revenge for his low poll numbers more than for any kind of attempt at herd immunity. He is truly pure evil.

1339386069846904834 2020-12-17 09:44:58 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @glennkirschner2 Question, Glenn. I recall you saying Trump could be charged with Manslaughter or even Murder Two for the deaths caused by his negligence in handling the pandemic. Now that they've found proof he was intentionally spreading it can that be increased to Murder One?
1339383953464016896 2020-12-17 09:36:33 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SweetFnLucifer Proof being found of him having ordered that Americans be infected is the cherry 🍒 on top of the humiliation (not that he actually feels shame, much less humiliation). Said months ago he was intentionally infecting people at his rallies, now we have proof!

I think Trump have him a task that was too over the top for even him to do. The order was probably accompanied by "or else you're fired".

If that's the case he'll likely end up suspended often maybe eventually banned. We will see I guess.

Funny that he insists on a pledge of loyalty when he's probably the most disloyal person on the planet. GOP will get what they deserve one way or the other.
1338935036431646720 2020-12-16 03:52:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @cur_mudgeon @JGaffneyUSN @BeschlossDC Trump's PAC is a slush fund he can use for anything he wants to. He's raised more money since the election than he did for the election. He's padding his bank accounts hugely before exiting the White House.

Once they move me to a room they switch to morphine which isn't nearly as effective but the NG tube helps a bit. Dilaudid is great for uber severe pain.

1337238644088688642 2020-12-11 11:31:52 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee Hubby is a FF Paramedic &amp; actually sleeps in an N95 mask at work as the room is shared. Washes his clothes before coming home from his 72 hr shifts. He just got on the list for vaccines for 1st responders. He worries about bringing COVID home to me so 🤞 he can get both doses!
1337235570141974528 2020-12-11 11:19:39 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee Yeah. Hubby tries to get me to go to hospital before I start writhing, am stubborn. Glad pots helping you so much! Am just glad to have a doc that's ok with prescribing Norco. Gawd forbid he retires as am sure it won't be easy to find another doc. He's been my PCP for 20 years.
1337219232812081152 2020-12-11 10:14:44 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CherryWanders @EmilyShapiro1 @MeWeFree_ It was crazy! Another year it was Teddy Ruxpin!
1337218620103876608 2020-12-11 10:12:18 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee Have to love having our own bodies attack us..not! Have been tested for Lupus several times as more than half of patients with APS also have Lupus. So far am negative so it's Primary APS. Coumadin &amp; aspirin to prevent more strokes or a clot storm. Scared af of getting covid!
1337216721539624961 2020-12-11 10:04:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee Nods, it's a good thing there are alternatives to oral meds! When I obstruct oral meds don't work and am so grateful for IV pain meds at the hospital!
1337213717230993408 2020-12-11 09:52:49 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kltewers_karen @mama_c2 Thanks 🙂 We're hopeful the supply holds out for him to get both doses 🤞
1337213251059208193 2020-12-11 09:50:57 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee Used to see  people vaping it in medical MJ dispensaries in SF when I went there with a friend who had an rx. It was an odd thing that looked kind of like a bong. This was before vaping everything became popular, 98-99 or so. That would probably be a good method for a nonsmoker.
1337211819870441472 2020-12-11 09:45:16 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee I felt the whole surgery when they "knocked me out" for emergency c-section. Gave me plenty of paralytic, too little anesthetic. Couldn't even wiggle a finger, much less scream, to let them know I could feel everything. Used 3 forms of birth control for years after that 😄🤣
1337210629304684545 2020-12-11 09:40:32 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee Pretty sure my autoimmune disorder isn't related to my sciatica and nerve pain in my feet from bone deformities but who knows? APS is a gnarly clotting disorder, had 6 strokes before diagnosis. Suppose the brain damage could cause nerve pain, know it destroyed my sleep pattern!

1337204340004540417 2020-12-11 09:15:33 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Herbmixer @EsoOrc @leahvallee Pot doesn't work for everyone. Am quite happy with the relief I get from Norco and it doesn't make me paranoid &amp; anxious. Glad my doc has never suggested I try pot for my pain as I'd have to tell him that I'd already btdt &amp; it didn't help. Some things he doesn't need to know 😃
1337201900643479552 2020-12-11 09:05:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CalliCapone @leahvallee Doesn't work for everyone, am glad Norco has worked for me for many years now. Am totally on board with it being legal nationwide for medical and recreational use for adults 18+ (think it's 21 in most states where it's legal though).
1337200702750224385 2020-12-11 09:01:06 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @leahvallee Nope. It affects me badly. Smoked as a teen but it changed how it affected me at 18, made me super paranoid &amp; anxious. Tried it again later on for pain &amp; it just made me focus more on the pain &amp; break out in a rash. Am glad others can enjoy/smoke it legally now in many states 🙂

1337159131992506370 2020-12-11 06:15:54 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mama_c2 Will do. He's great at his job and I think he will miss it when he has to retire in 2 years. I'm happy he won't have to worry as much about me. 🙂
1337157880147890176 2020-12-11 06:10:56 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @dstiddypop43 It wasn't "the right thing" to subvert state rights in a national emergency and make super spreader church events possible. Sorry not sorry.

He's been stressed out about the possibility of bringing covid home as I have an autoimmune clotting disorder &amp; likely wouldn't survive it. He even sleeps with an N95 on at work. 🤞

His #MAGAts will hold reps &amp; senators feet to the fire &amp; any up for election in 2022 will definitely toe the MAGA line in order to keep Trump's base happy so they don't get voted out.

This woman worked for the government, they knew she wasn't a violent felon. I hope she sues their asses off, including #DeathSantis !

1334261401615880192 2020-12-03 06:21:22 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin I think the "defund the police" slogan was harmful in the down ballot races. I think other slogans like "Yes we can!" are uplifting and positive and can be very uniting. Guess what I'm saying is it depends on the slogan.

1334258944198361089 2020-12-03 06:11:36 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @jaywhyelle @JulieLinden5 Because it's not just poor people who are dealing with not having money to feed their families. There are now millions of formerly middle class families needing to obtain food from food banks so they've begun reporting on it more frequently &amp; using the term "food insecure" more.

Future illegal acts are not included in his pardon unless they stem from the Special Counsel investigation/report &amp; his seditious statement was made *after* the pardon was issued. He can be charged &amp; convicted of sedition and go to prison for it.
1334219536178954240 2020-12-03 03:35:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ChristophJLynch @TEBC_inPA @Skippy_Bush_Roo @BadExampleMan @Angry_Staffer No. I read the pardon Trump gave to Flynn and it relies heavily on pardoning him for any charges currently, or in the future, that stem from the special counsel investigation. It is overbroad in its terms but doesn't exempt him from future indictment for non SC related charges.

Not all rescues are 501c3 but it doesn't mean they aren't valid rescues. The paperwork for becoming a 501c3 is pretty daunting to understand and there are fees many rescues can't afford as they're paying for food &amp; vets.

This is a brand new plot to overthrow our government which is sedition and doubt it's covered by the pardon.

1334127491200401412 2020-12-02 21:29:15 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Schoaches @Angry_Staffer And see him charged with sedition!

1334126931193655296 2020-12-02 21:27:01 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @pere_skop @Angry_Staffer This is sedition and I hope they strip him of his rank and that he's formally charged.
1334126420574932992 2020-12-02 21:25:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @tork3016 @GastonW250 @Angry_Staffer @glennkirschner2 @tribelaw @neal_katyal .@USArmy It appears @GenFlynn is engaging in seditious behavior unbecoming a former military officer. Can you please look into stripping him of his rank?
1334124291663699968 2020-12-02 21:16:32 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @tork3016 @GastonW250 @Angry_Staffer @glennkirschner2 @tribelaw @neal_katyal So a brand new federal charge for sedition is possible. Isn't that like a minimum 20 year sentence? What an effing idiot!
1334123656562184195 2020-12-02 21:14:01 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Angry_Staffer Okay. Well this is post-pardon and doesn't stem from the Mueller report so doesn't this count as a brand new sedition charge?

If someone is a convicted felon they should be ineligible, same if they couldn't get security clearance. We should also remove the natural born citizen rule. We now know some people born here are *far* from trustworthy!

1332827762734743554 2020-11-29 07:24:36 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MelisCattish @Angry_Staffer Trump has been campaigning ever since he was sworn in. He never stopped! I think he's the only potus* that held campaign rallies throughout his entire term. Makes one wonder where all the $ raised from his constant campaigning went.

If you restrict them to followers that you follow and are being harassed by a follower you simply unfollow and block them. Problem solved.

He's just trying to screw up the Senate election 🤬🤬🤬
1332379749855887361 2020-11-28 01:44:21 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SummerStarbuck1 @EdanClay @realDonaldTrump OMG he's such an ignoramus! Abrams said there have been 850k absentee ballots requested. Media needs to stop giving #DiaperDon any air time at all. He has nothing to say that isn't a lie. Focus on the future and interview Biden and Harris.
1332377347987705857 2020-11-28 01:34:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheKronicKat @EdanClay 🤣🤣🤣 Still love AC/DC though, especially when Bon Scott was still alive.

1332375864344862720 2020-11-28 01:28:55 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @EdanClay If people's sole focus is the # of followers they have then they're missing the point. I follow people whose posts I find interesting, informative, insightful, or funny. Am very opinionated, rarely hold back in my tweets, &amp; dgaf how many follow me. Quality over quantity always.
1332372506301267969 2020-11-28 01:15:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @itsneonyang @ChuckWendig I think this was Melania's idea. She told him they had to clean the carpets before putting up the Xmas decorations just as a way to humiliate him, perhaps there will be more instances prior to the divorce being final 1/20/21.
1332370636543385607 2020-11-28 01:08:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AngryBlackLady @ChuckWendig They could have stopped him from ever being elected in the 1st place if they'd run all the dirt they had on him in 2015. They ran one article about his ties to the mafia and were supposed to do another one but never did. They were complicit in his being elected.

Essentially a republican qanon grievance, whine, lie, and complain meeting with validated parking and complementary covid salad bar.

It was basically a Repugnican qanon meeting hosted by Rudy Colludy where Trump phoned in a rant that they amplified with a microphone for his cult members. Held at a Windham meeting room. It actually happened after PA had already certified it's count.

1331918282438316032 2020-11-26 19:10:39 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Ifitsthisname @TrumpHasGot2Go @cgrapski @glennkirschner2 The people given pardons are not given them to prevent "corrupt prosecutions". Are you claiming that those convicted of crimes who receive pardons were wrongly convicted or corruptly prosecuted? That's ridiculous.
1331916902004793346 2020-11-26 19:05:09 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @XwingAtAlicious @arielmg47 @Goss30Goss It's "forgiveness". An Innocent person would have no need of a pardon.
1331916344988602369 2020-11-26 19:02:57 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Ifitsthisname @glennkirschner2 Accepting a pardon implies an acknowledgement of guilt, it is not considered a declaration of innocence. A person innocent of wrongdoing would not accept a pardon. A pardon is "forgiveness" but not truly exculpatory.

1331746134717390849 2020-11-26 07:46:35 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> .@neal_katyal If Trump self pardons or resigns and has Pence pardon him wouldn't that amount to admission of guilt of a federal crime making him ineligible to run for POTUS again? If he pardons Pence before resigning wouldn't that make Pence ineligible to take his place as potus?

He's busy making the list and checking it twice so Trump can pardon all who are evil, not nice. That and shredding evidence.

1331370063526457344 2020-11-25 06:52:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @glennkirschner2 I have a question about the "Trump resigns, has Pence pardon him" theory. If Trump doesn't pardon Pence before resigning that would seem to leave Pence on the hook for crimes he was complicit in. If Trump pardons Pence before resigning can Pence still legally pardon Trump?

She was a syllable spanker, one whack each syllable as she chastised.

The ballots are tracked in many states and we can verify they were received &amp; counted. Since there's no way to tell from the envelope who the vote is for if that many ballots were found that were *all* 1 candidate it would mean they're likely fake/planted.

1330366795908255745 2020-11-22 12:25:35 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ThatEricAlper Putting a new fan in my desktop computer. Set it on top and plugged it in to hear how loud it was before installing it. It immediately tried to vibrate off the edge and I grabbed it to stop it. It ate a good chunk of one of my fingers, still have a scar 17 years later.

Of those nearly 29% voted for 4 more years of hate. About 31% of us voted to save democracy. W/O counting 3rd party that's 103,324,000, 40% who didn't vote or voted other. 🤬

1330062828041089024 2020-11-21 16:17:44 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LaurelRosenhall I was stunned that the NAACP allowed her to lend their endorsement to the no on 25 campaign as a yes vote would seem a more likely stance, and her consulting company benefited from it, not the NAACP. Way to be tricked, CA, &amp; shame on Huffman for helping the bond companies do so!!
1330059876756844551 2020-11-21 16:06:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LaurelRosenhall I read about this before the election &amp; was livid. CA actually voted out cash bail in 2010 and was immediately sued by the same consortium of bail bond &amp; insurance companies that put prop 25 on the ballot hoping to trick people into voting against what they voted for in 2010!

Better to resign and have Pence do it. He'd have to pardon Pence before resigning though lest Pence be left holding the bag.

1329213974735306753 2020-11-19 08:04:41 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ToughTilly @DogginTrump It was actually 7.9 mill for a full recount so nearly 8 million. Even if he had the $ he'd still only count the black/heavily dem counties. He effing makes me so sick 🤬🤬🤬
1329213166291542016 2020-11-19 08:01:29 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DogginTrump They're counting two counties. It, of course, happens to be two counties where the demographic is largely people of color. It would have cost 8 mill for him to have the whole state recounted.
1329178168570249216 2020-11-19 05:42:24 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MeidasTouch @CaitElizabeth5 Well we know people hang with folks who share their beliefs.

1329137396462481408 2020-11-19 03:00:24 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DogginTrump Yep. This was an amazing statement. Am not sure if this alone convinced them to rethink their vote but it should have been enough!
1329136161860722688 2020-11-19 02:55:29 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @cubzfab @TheRickWilson Yep. Pretty sure he saw the writing on the wall in the, not very accurate, polls and decided to hold as many super spreaders as he could to ensure massive spikes and the most dire circumstances would await Biden when he takes office. Probably also as payback for blue states.
1329134511964123136 2020-11-19 02:48:56 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheRickWilson @DogginTrump It's extremely harmful to our nation.

Maybe he had surgery of some kind? Definitely on anticoagulants based on the massive amount of bruising.

If he did have it he had it for much longer before they revealed the positive test. Even with the experimental therapies no way anyone has a 3 day bout of covid.

1328718072283242496 2020-11-17 23:14:09 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Angry_Staffer I figured his super spreader events were a form sabotage, especially with the polls showing Biden ahead by more than he was.

1328555855629885441 2020-11-17 12:29:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @BettyBowers @EdanClay My thoughts exactly!
1328547207323107328 2020-11-17 11:55:12 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Temocracy17 Well we know how he feels about the military, especially those who die in service to their country.

1328544868847607808 2020-11-17 11:45:54 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @seanhannity Trying to stay on the Mercer's good side so you can work at Breitbart when Fox fires you to limit their liability?
1328544309507883011 2020-11-17 11:43:41 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @seanhannity Go away, Hannity. Maybe you can find an attorney over there who will take your case when you're sued for the misinformation you deliberately spewed that led to people dying. I can't wait to read about it when it happens. Wouldn't recommend Giuliani though as he'll likely in jail.
1328531775186817024 2020-11-17 10:53:52 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @scrowder Hell yes! We wouldn't have been so desperate for one, however, because he'd have handled the pandemic threat a Fvck of a lot better than Trump did. No way we'd have a quarter of a million dead and  a ruined economy. Thanks for playing.

Most lame duck presidents don't rush to do evil things they know the incoming potus wouldn't do but Trump is effing evil as they come and likely stands to be grifting big time off if these deals. Quite sure he's getting $$ from the companies involved to do it.

It's been reported like crazy and he should have been suspended until he deletes it.
1328506400180297728 2020-11-17 09:13:02 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @lisalsong @ChuckWendig Yes. Several employees tested positive with a rapid test at my husband's work. It's a fire station so they actually live together for 2-3 days at a time. Turned out only 1 of the 4 tested positive by PCR. Hubby was negative by both. He now wears an N95 24/7 at work, even sleeping
1328502972595113985 2020-11-17 08:59:25 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Angry_Staffer It's not going to get distributed quickly or well due to Trump's incompetence, even to 1st responders/medical people, or at risk populations. Unlikely many will receive it until Biden is inaugurated, especially with them still blocking the transition team.

He's been broken since he was a child and there is no fixing him nor an intervention that will help him. It might, however, help the country.

1328490020773085184 2020-11-17 08:07:57 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @STL_JC @Angry_Staffer Each state makes their own rules for counting of mail in ballots. Very few start counting ahead of the election, FL is one that does, and not many permit advanced processing of the ballots for quicker counting on election day. States with majority GOP legislatures are the worst!
1328487956080857089 2020-11-17 07:59:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @shadygrove @Angry_Staffer We really need to get rid of the electoral college. It should not be possible for the minority of voters to win an election and hold the nation hostage.
1328487346027655168 2020-11-17 07:57:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @shadygrove @Angry_Staffer It really is disheartening to realize that. We're going to have a hell of a time getting the pandemic under control with so many people believing his BS, even once vaccines start rolling out. 🤬🤬
1328486065758322689 2020-11-17 07:52:14 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @glennkirschner2 Meanwhile he's pushing through Arctic drilling rights and selling off national park land for strip mining before Biden takes office. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

The # of people I see still using ineffective bandanas or neck gaters, or people wearing masks below their noses, or putting a mask on just to get in a store then removing it is so frustrating. We definitely need a mask standard so people know what works &amp; what doesn't.
1328026923654496256 2020-11-16 01:27:46 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ZoeMollyMom @Feistychipmunk1 @DogginTrump @michele_pickens I'm totally fine with closing indoor dining. Opening it was stupid in the first place, as was opening bars. Hopefully we get the 2 Senate seats in GA in Jan so Biden doesn't have to fight McConnell to get real relief to the businesses and people that are struggling so much!
1328018032782757889 2020-11-16 00:52:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ZoeMollyMom @Feistychipmunk1 @DogginTrump @michele_pickens CoCo is red. Red is "Substantial" Orange is Moderate. Only thing worse than red is Purple Wide spread. Per CA being in Red means indoor dining has to decrease from 50 to 25% capacity but counties can enact stricter guidelines which it sounds like they're doing if closing dine in.
1328016349591814144 2020-11-16 00:45:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CallisonWynter When I was a teen I wanted to be a veterinarian but, like so many, life had other ideas. I don't think I could have handled having to put down sick or injured animals though, it wrecks me for months or years when one of my cats dies, &amp; the experience of putting one down, just 😭
1328014045891358722 2020-11-16 00:36:36 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Feistychipmunk1 @DogginTrump @michele_pickens I'm in a fairly red area of a very blue county. I rarely go on Next Door any more because of the asinine comments made by so many in my area. So frustrating and no real help in sight with this virus until 1/20/21. I hope Biden can make a difference in how some people see covid.
1328011786159734785 2020-11-16 00:27:37 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Feistychipmunk1 @DogginTrump @michele_pickens I really don't understand how anyone still doesn't understand just how dangerous this virus is. It's not like there isn't news about the growing infection and death rates every damned day! It's not like it's only being reported on one TV station. Idiots abound apparently!
1328010735402663937 2020-11-16 00:23:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @gmpug @marthalima122 @johndough2018 @DogginTrump @michele_pickens I was glad to see Fresno County is down from purple to red as I have friends there. I hope you're wrong about Merced but suspect a lot of CA will be purple after Thanksgiving, and especially so if stores do their stupid Black Friday sales 🤬

I haven't checked if my county, CoCo, has come off of purple or not because it will not change what I do. Am basically still doing what they said to in March but with the mask that was recommended later on. No dining at restaurants, limiting shopping at stores etc.
1327811009231273990 2020-11-15 11:09:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Kat_deuxj_diva @DogginTrump Yeah I don't get Vegas at all.

1327806308498608130 2020-11-15 10:51:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @halohead811 @DogginTrump I partially blame the advertising Applebee's is doing. "Welcome Back America" type ads lulling people who are already burned out by pandemic into thinking things are better when they aren't. Same with theme parks, in FL especially, "We're back, with special precautions in place!"

1327507760682921984 2020-11-14 15:04:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Carriebim @xoxdebxox @donwinslow @smokeyvera Yes, and in a lot of cases multiple or all of these factors.
1327506557622386688 2020-11-14 15:00:01 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheTermaNaida @yellowbirdcjk @AngrierWHStaff @AngrylilWoman Well Arpaio was charged and found guilty, in his case it's an admission the conviction was valid and he can't appeal it because by being pardoned he's admitted he was rightfully convicted.
1327505683516772357 2020-11-14 14:56:33 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MLEco2h2o @martinezec76 @AngrierWHStaff @annmschwartz Agreed!!

Think the vote tally gives us a very frightening idea of how many MAGAts there are 😖 How so many could have voted for the monster is seriously beyond me! He's not just the worst potus ever, he's likely 1 of the worst human beings in the history of America!

We almost match! 🙂 We had 14 until spring and one of our indoor ferals, only 5 years old grew suddenly and gravely ill. She was the sibling to 2 of our indoor ferals and the daughter of the other, was very beautiful. Was a sad thing to lose her, mama still looks for her. 😢

He's held our nation hostage for 6+ years now and, along with Trump, is responsible for people not getting much needed help in a pandemic. He needs to be investigated/ousted!
1327098324445380608 2020-11-13 11:57:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @senatemajldr Umm the vaccine in question had nothing to do with Trump, warp speed, or the government. Pfizer made that very clear in their announcement. Nice try though, traitor. What's up with the huge hematomas on your hands &amp; bruising around your lips? Sure looks like you're really unwell.

1327066708436127749 2020-11-13 09:52:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @KatMeanJean Funny thing is in my 20s-30s I was a charge nurse at the infirmary of a convent motherhouse. At interview I was asked by the DON if I was Catholic. I said "Yes, baptized. Does that help?". She said "it doesn't hurt" &amp; I thought, but didn't say of course, "Actually yes it does!".
1327061509956980737 2020-11-13 09:31:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @KatMeanJean Started when a Catholic priest wouldn't baptize me when I was 6 &amp; we were going on a cross country road trip. Said I'd reached the "age of choice", right up until my dad made a large donation on the spot, then Tada, baptized. If you make big enough donations "god" is for sale.

1326450015720546305 2020-11-11 17:01:42 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DesignationSix Well Trump is too craven and selfish for that.
1326449655039733760 2020-11-11 17:00:16 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kellypai3 @EdanClay @DormontCat @debreena57 on Liz's and Bernie's policies and are much more progressive than Biden's have been in the past. Words have power &amp; our messaging needs to be more descriptive of our intent. Defund brought images of crime running rampant &amp; wasn't the intent of the idea. Reform is much better.
1326448036948500480 2020-11-11 16:53:50 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kellypai3 @EdanClay @DormontCat @debreena57 First, of course Republican Biden voters were likely to vote red, Inds not so much &amp; there was a much larger number of Ind voters this time. They didn't pursue Reps as opposed to pursuing progressives, they pursued all voters. Like I said if you read his policies many are based/1
1326445452032536576 2020-11-11 16:43:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Sethisuwan @EdanClay @StageYaneu Heh. I'm a leftie that agrees with him, but I'm a reasonable leftie. I cringed so bad the first time I heard that mantra and my reaction didn't improve with time.
1326440990056476672 2020-11-11 16:25:50 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kellypai3 @EdanClay @DormontCat @debreena57 And before you say anything about courting progressive voters I am a progressive voter, a Warren Democrat and I hated that slogan &amp; knew it was going to cause problems. If you look at Biden's policies many are Liz's or include aspects of her or Sander's policies. He did court us.
1326437728423010309 2020-11-11 16:12:53 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kellypai3 @EdanClay @DormontCat @debreena57 It's simply an awful slogan, a turnoff to moderate dems, independents, &amp; Republicans who were voting Biden. Pretty sure it's why we lost seats in Congress &amp; competitive Senate races. Reps &amp; Ind voted for Biden but not a full blue ticket so we wouldn't get control &amp; defund cops.
1326432819531272193 2020-11-11 15:53:22 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RepKatiePorter I sure wish there was something Congress could do about all of these firings and Trump lackey replacements. Between the DoD, resignations of 3 high ranking security officials the most disturbing of which in Nuclear Security, &amp; Pompeo's seditious remarks it's getting very scary!
1326427063050526725 2020-11-11 15:30:30 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @rufkutdiamnd @RepKatiePorter @mmpadellan The 25th isn't possible. Pence won't do it and Trump's cabinet are waiting for pardons they won't get if he's removed. The Senate has already proven they won't vote to convict anyone in this administration. At this late date impeachment without removal is pointless.
1326423770412838912 2020-11-11 15:17:25 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RepKatiePorter I am so glad you won reelection! Donated to your campaign from NorCal. You are so dynamic and effective and when I see you pull out your whiteboard I know I'm about to see some bad actor squirm &amp; sweat. Watching you take down Ben Carson after his "Oreos" snark was *chef's kiss*!
1326419832988987399 2020-11-11 15:01:46 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @rickrolled2015 @RepKatiePorter She needs to stay put. We lost house seats this election and finding another Dem that will win in a red district after initial appointment would not be easy. Personally I'd rather she take Kamala's place as Senator but we really need her in the house.

1325920156007108608 2020-11-10 05:56:14 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @skstraughn @Meidas_Kelly Yeah. Biden will properly use the Defense Production act to get companies producing N95 masks and other PPE for health care workers and 1st responders without making states bid for them online and profiteering on them. Trump'a focus on DPA was purely how he could make $ off it.

1325668349544599555 2020-11-09 13:15:38 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mmdesoer Unfortunately I believe most of the charges that could be filed against him are, well, federal. As far as the Bar Association goes pretty much the most they can do is fine &amp; disbar him. He will walk away essentially unscathed. Am sure he can afford both the fines &amp; retirement 🤬
1325666362539216897 2020-11-09 13:07:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @IndependenceOps @MeidasTouch Oh trust me I'm totally on board with him standing trial for betraying our nation. As old as he is a sedition conviction would be a life sentence and I'm ok with that as long as he has to be housed wth general population. Unfortunately he's going to have Pence pardon him 🤬🤬
1325664431490002944 2020-11-09 13:00:04 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @blueeyedkitten_ @LzProw I love @BrentTerhune This is, impo, one of his best!
1325664023610761216 2020-11-09 12:58:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JacekJasinski @thomaskaine5 To be honest I don't trust any voting system that doesn't produce a printed copy of the completed ballot for auditing or recount purposes. I follow @jennycohn1 and she is incredibly knowledgeable about every facet of the election process, machines, hacks, etc. I only trust paper!
1325663162364878849 2020-11-09 12:55:02 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LzProw @blueeyedkitten_ Great photo!
1325662488562597888 2020-11-09 12:52:21 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @deeper_time @JacekJasinski @thomaskaine5 Also scour every post office for stashes of ballots. I know Sullivan is working on this and DeJoy needs to be held in contempt for not complying with a court order. He needs to be tried for election interference and sentence should be at least 1 day for every ballot found at POs!
1325660907611938816 2020-11-09 12:46:04 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @janicecarlson77 @ReallyAmerican1 That's a very good question. If he wants to cry that he can't afford his debts let him set up a GoFundMe like people have been doing to pay for funeral expenses for family who died of covid due to his failure. Pretty sure it isn't legal for him to use AF1 for rallies now either!
1325658805762285570 2020-11-09 12:37:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ReallyAmerican1 @yeawelltoldu His campaign needs to reimburse us for use of AF1, &amp; all of the costs involved with his rallies. A tweet I read broke down costs, like flying autos to locations for staff use &amp; it's obscene! No more AF1 for any non-job related use now period! Also take away the nuclear football!

1325530238256734209 2020-11-09 04:06:50 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mmdesoer He'd been on a speechifying tour up until a couple of weeks ago and I read somewhere that he'd been spotted coming out of a store in DC about a week ago. Unless he has a doppelganger (who I'd feel great sympathy for) it seems he's alive and well.

1325178711524560896 2020-11-08 04:50:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SteveOsunsami No I don't. I'm not friends with any #MAGAt
1325176853154287617 2020-11-08 04:42:37 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Just because a bunch of idiots still voted for you and the abomination in the oval doesn't make you relevant, Mattie. Go have drinks with your son.
1325175144701071362 2020-11-08 04:35:49 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @PreetBharara @WilliamDunnJR1 It feels like that from the responses of our allies leaders, doesn't it? The World's Cup Runneth Over today, I think!

1325167889750482944 2020-11-08 04:07:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @funder Elated but concerned about the damage Trump can do in his lame duck months.
1325167496534519809 2020-11-08 04:05:26 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MaryLTrump Cheers, Mary! Thanks for all you did to help people understand the evil that is your uncle!!
1325148066593210369 2020-11-08 02:48:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RadioFreeTom Thank you for your stoic opposition to Trump and sharing your knowledge of government and concern for our nation with us. I look forward to being able to fly somewhere in a year or so in comfy non-business attire (with shoes on though) and making a toast in your honor.

1325126868119347202 2020-11-08 01:23:59 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @dukewindsor388 Hope springs eternal but brainwashing can last a lifetime. Considering we have Q puppets in Congress starting next year it's going to be a while before we get the needle to swing in the direction of decency and for the good of the people.
1325123715164561409 2020-11-08 01:11:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RubinsRants @ProjectLincoln Agreed!!
1325123562496163841 2020-11-08 01:10:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Redwinenbooks @ProjectLincoln I think I saw @TheRickWilson post that they're in it to oust all the Trump enabling traitorous Republicans in Senate &amp; Congress. Am hoping investigations of McConnell &amp; Graham end up causing their removal, also Jordan &amp; McCarthy must go.
1325122305429696521 2020-11-08 01:05:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @pjwest0465 @ProjectLincoln @Jflo918 @realDonaldTrump What's really amusing is Mar a Lago literally means Sea to Lake and in models of the effects of climate change and sea levels rising Mar a Lago is going to become part of the ocean. Not that sea levels rising is funny but the Trump spawn will be inheriting under ocean property.
1325119643837558786 2020-11-08 00:55:17 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mattgaetz Did daddy buy you some convalescent antibody transfusions, Mattie? That's the only other way to acquire antibodies to COVID without actually having had the virus. How many people did you infect while stumping for your soon to be ex boss?
1325118726857920512 2020-11-08 00:51:38 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Moreofacatpersn @mattgaetz Unless he's had convalescent antibody transfusions which aren't supposed to be given to anyone who isn't critically ill because it's experimental. Suppose his rich daddy could have bought it for him though like he's paid to make multiple DUIs disappear.
1325116767924973568 2020-11-08 00:43:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Jerandi5 @flyaway_k There's only 1 way to get antibodies to the virus w/o having had the virus &amp;, AFAIK, Gaetz hasn't been in the ICU so wouldn't receive convalescent antibody treatment (one must be in critical condition to receive the experimental therapy). If he doesn't have it now he once did.
1325113168679460865 2020-11-08 00:29:33 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Rick__Flare @flyaway_k No. He isolated because he was possibly exposed.

1324948449314267136 2020-11-07 13:35:01 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Starryillusionz @AngrierWHStaff Me too.. As I applauded loudly and yelled "Now *that* was presidential!". Then someone a few miles away started setting off fireworks so I knew I wasn't the only person totally delighted 🙂

I can't grok the mentality of his supporters and don't know how they're going to act now.

Any of those scanned on receipt should have a timestamp with USPS &amp; must be counted.

I love when he grills Republicans because he doesn't let them lie &amp; pushes back hard at them. Maybe he's tired, most hosts have been working much longer hours than usual. Or maybe it's a question his "donating $$$$ to the RNC" overlords insisted he ask.

1324420163995754496 2020-11-06 02:35:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Because you're as corrupt as he is.

So far the only one winning 🤞seems to be Mark Kelly and he's only winning because everyone hates McSally!

1324243743914876928 2020-11-05 14:54:46 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @tweeterberry1 @EdanClay Same here. Hugely prefer animals to people, my favorite animals are, and always have been, cats. Don't mind quarantine at all as long as I have my cats, outdoor wildlife, books, and the internet.
1324242794018267141 2020-11-05 14:50:59 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @EdanClay I grew up in the SF Bay Area and, though I knew racism existed I didn't know how bad it was until I moved to OK for a few months as a teen. I discovered not only racial bigotry but religious bigotry too. Was glad to move back. Now I see it here too, quite often &amp; getting worse 🤬
1324221339033432064 2020-11-05 13:25:44 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AngrierWHStaff Dunno. Watching a bunch of flag ridden pick up trucks with armed nuts trying to run Kamala's bus off the highway was a real low point for me.

1324202130912153601 2020-11-05 12:09:25 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @amy_kach @B52Malmet Can't kill Citizens United without a constitutional amendment which would require a super majority and we won't have that.
1324190595628236800 2020-11-05 11:23:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Wittie2015 @B52Malmet Yeah because the new SCOTUS configuration is never going to revisit that horrible decision it will take an amendment and we don't have the necessary numbers in the Senate.
1324189671258161153 2020-11-05 11:19:54 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @pshene1 @B52Malmet Yeah. Can't believe how much I donated to candidates this year and not a single one of them won 🤬

1324173887920205824 2020-11-05 10:17:11 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @B52Malmet @FrauStups I don't know any of my neighbors after living here for 7 years. I'm fine with not knowing any of them. It's a mix of somewhat older than me senior citizens &amp; people with small kids teaching them it's ok to set off fireworks despite them being illegal &amp; dangerous. Have my cats 🙂

Many relocated to FL, NY, and TX. You wouldn't think they'd vote for Trump after what he did.

1324120532715933696 2020-11-05 06:45:10 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin Not me. Even if Biden wins we're dead in the water with #MoscowMitch continuing obstruction of all legislation &amp; confirming more RW judges. Because we didn't take back the Senate we won't be able to expand SCOTUS size or be able to impeach ACB or Kavanaugh. We're still screwed.

Nothing will be accomplished for at least 2 years, if then. Just more RW judges confirmed &amp; ACB destroying all in her path &amp; we won't be able to change SCOTUS #s.

1324060335792271360 2020-11-05 02:45:58 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kingwolf0095 @winman953 @BaddCompani Sounds like he needs to be arrested and jailed for contempt and stay there until all 300k missing ballots are found.
1324059550958317568 2020-11-05 02:42:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @BaddCompani Yes! Did they arrest DeJoy for contempt??
1324046477014921219 2020-11-05 01:50:54 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @goldenheart1995 @chipfranklin Yep. The United States is now a misnomer. I think it's time for a split and a new experiment. The good people a new democracy, the bigots, religious fanatics,&amp; domestic terrorists can choose fascism or any form of government they want. They're dead to me, won't deal with them.
1324044400519864320 2020-11-05 01:42:39 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @cliffhangerCA @chipfranklin Yep. I don't believe we will truly be the United States ever again. Time to split up and start a new experiment.
1324043772787716098 2020-11-05 01:40:09 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin Angry &amp; disgusted that so many bigots still exist in our nation that think the mass murderer in the oval should get another term as long as he continues to hate &amp; harm the same people they hate. I no longer believe we will ever be the United States after this. Time to split up.

Makes me wish the docs had done the spinal block I'd requested pre-delivery instead of fake knocking me out. It would have hurt less. My baby went home in 3 days, I had a laparotomy to fix the holes they'd put in my intestines, was in 8 days longer. This election is worse!

So much fun feeling an emergency c section and adhesion lysis w/o being able to scream or even wiggle a finger to tell them you're awake/feeling everything 🤬
1323939589023653888 2020-11-04 18:46:10 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @WeAreAllOther @jimmykimmel @phyll_indablank Yep. Had that happen. They knocked me out but mostly just paralyzed me. Felt the whole surgery start to finish &amp; couldn't even wiggle my finger to let them know I was awake &amp; feeling everything. That's the only child I ever had. Nightmare stuff! This election is nightmarish too!

The newly developed Democratic nation would give zero assistance to the fascist nation. They'd have to be self reliant for a change and could have all the guns they want if they give up eating.
1323916240197361665 2020-11-04 17:13:23 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @NehkohCat @jennyyangtv @designmom Actually I think we need to split up the nation into 2 new nations because we are clearly *never* going to be the United States ever again. Divide up the SS and Medicare funds based on what's been paid in by each citizen. Take the last 4 years of Federal taxes paid by people and
1323913929412628480 2020-11-04 17:04:12 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LizzyTXchick @AngrierWHStaff Time to divide up the states and let the red states enjoy their fascism. They won't be doing it with any $ from our newly established democratic nation.

1323911802959273986 2020-11-04 16:55:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ams1701 @AngrierWHStaff The red states can enjoy their fascism and  fend for themselves when there's no $ being given to them by our new nation. They can have all the guns they want and kill each other off for all I care. Meanwhile we will heal our environment, be productive &amp; happy, &amp; love one another.
1323909330798743552 2020-11-04 16:45:56 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ams1701 @AngrierWHStaff I hoped some had come around after the baby caging, or the tear gassing peaceful protesters, or the 230k+ dead Americans he's responsible for but did it change their votes? No! Am thinking it may be time for the sane, intelligent, ethical, humane states to form our own nation.

1323903343362633728 2020-11-04 16:22:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MeganElizaH @AngrierWHStaff I will be sleeping, question is whether it's worth waking up.
1323899982630457344 2020-11-04 16:08:47 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ECU_ALUM @AngrierWHStaff @MelodyFritchley Exactly. I despise 48% of the people in this nation. I will never travel to AL, AR, FL, IA, ID, IN, KS, KY, LA, MO, MS, MT, ND, NE, OH, OK, SC, SD, TN, UT, or WY, nor will I buy anything produced in those states. F them &amp; their bigotry, stupidity, fake christianity, &amp; hypocrisy!
1323893652511363072 2020-11-04 15:43:38 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @educate_vote @AngrierWHStaff And DeJoy needs to be arrested and held for contempt until every ballot he's stolen is located and counted.

1323892570619961346 2020-11-04 15:39:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AngrierWHStaff But without a majority in the Senate nothing good will get done for at least 2 years, Angry. We needed to flip the Senate for anything to work.
1323891245635104769 2020-11-04 15:34:04 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TrumpOut20201 @EdanClay Yep. Didn't flip the senate, might pick up 2 seats but won't get majority so even if Biden wins, any progress on legislation is dead for at least 2 years. So depressed! If SCOTUS hands Trump the election am paying off my house so hubby &amp; cats will always have a home then am done.
1323868077205848066 2020-11-04 14:02:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JasonOverstreet And free mental health care. A large % of Americans are now dead to me and there are multiple states to which I will never travel again. If Trump wins I'm done. Am too old to find another country to move to. Will pay off my house and fade to black.
1323864163618189312 2020-11-04 13:46:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin I just said something very similar. With a mass murderer as the incumbent potus this election should be a landslide for Joe!
1323862236352323590 2020-11-04 13:38:47 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RobAnderson2018 So many good people losing their races to people not worthy of the job. It's so damned frustrating and I'm truly disappointed by, and disgusted with, a good % of the people in this country. With a mass murderer as the incumbent potus this election should not be as close as it is!
1323860120183320578 2020-11-04 13:30:23 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RobAnderson2018 I'm so sorry Rob ☹️ the people in LA are truly the ones missing out.
1323841579447054341 2020-11-04 12:16:42 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @indictmentduck Agreed. Looks like about half the country is dead to me.
1323838533073690628 2020-11-04 12:04:36 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @waltshaub Really not feeling good about being a part of a country where so many are willing to vote for a fascist and his henchmen.

1323836471443292160 2020-11-04 11:56:25 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @waltshaub Sure hope so, Walt. Not looking good for taking back the Senate though in which case we're back to not getting anything done again.

I thought there'd be a bunch of states unable to report solid numbers tonight but apparently I was mistaken. Glued to MSNBC.

The white cheddar ones are ok but my fave cheese is Jack, 2nd fave is pepper jack, 3rd is parmesan, 4th is mozzarella, 5th is lilac white cheddar from Rogue Creamery in OR.

1323555009305309184 2020-11-03 17:17:59 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @stucam7771 We knew he was unfit before he was even "elected". We really must get rid of the electoral college. It's very purpose from the start was to give slave owners more power, slavery is gone in the US and so should the electoral college be.

1323553382280261633 2020-11-03 17:11:31 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @groovydegroovy @stucam7771 Ahhh but he does feel fear for himself. He's as craven as nights are long in winter. That's why he's had a 4th even taller, thicker wall built around the White House today and has brought in military to guard it.
1323552174467551232 2020-11-03 17:06:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @stucam7771 Hmm his bankruptcies didn't come with a possible prison term so have a feeling he's a wee bit more nervous today 🙃

1323335992435040256 2020-11-03 02:47:41 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LynneMcCarren @SweetFnLucifer They didn't use to include the "I Voted" sticker with absentee ballots so used to get one when I dropped off my ballot on election day. Now they send it with the ballots. Was happy I was able to have it without risking getting covid.
1323334317985001472 2020-11-03 02:41:02 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @cherylklaas @SweetFnLucifer I have an AI disorder as well. Dropped ballot in official ballot box and they've received it. Blue through and through. Always have been. 🙂
1323333819320029184 2020-11-03 02:39:03 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SweetFnLucifer Already voted absentee and my ballot's been received. Usually I drop my ballot off at my polling place but not this time. Have an autoimmune clotting disorder that puts me at very high risk of dying if I contract COVID so dropped it in a county ballot box instead this time.
1323332897701466112 2020-11-03 02:35:23 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ZagamaMas Her reporting on Trump in 15-16 helped get the SOB elected. Between her and then Chris Hayes Bernie love those were hours I couldn't watch MSNBC. She still doesn't seem to think she did anything wrong back then either, and Hayes is still a bro.

1323002960406704129 2020-11-02 04:44:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @realDonaldTrump You sick, traitorous cockroach! You terrorist! I can't wait for you to be tossed out on your butt 1/20/21 and taken into custody before you even make it to Marine1! @TwitterSupport Is this not inciting and encouraging violence??

1322990067145535488 2020-11-02 03:53:06 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin Since Trump knows he doesn't have the numbers to win.

1322964508747288576 2020-11-02 02:11:33 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ericloechle @AdamParkhomenko Yes they have. Very few States allow counting of votes prior to election day. FL is one of the few, if not only, state that counts ahead. The high number of MIB this year will slow down results some but it's no different than other election years. Look how long 18 took to count!

Lets repugnicans lie through their teeth without stopping them or pushing back in any way.

1322729649365946368 2020-11-01 10:38:18 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> DeathSantis is probably delighted that FL election systems can be hacked. Saves him from having to do it himself.

1322722781532839937 2020-11-01 10:11:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Amy_Siskind @loribelle Remember that some Republicans are actually voting for Biden also, despite being registered Republican.
1322722207915630593 2020-11-01 10:08:44 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @QHumans @RiffRaf979 @RafaelAnchia I don't call them that.. Gullible, insane, stupid, blind, lots of other words but since they're proud of being low life, despicable scum I don't use their favored term.
1322719842672107520 2020-11-01 09:59:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @EricTrump Yep. You stranded your sheep again. They really *are* that stupid that they expected a ride back to their vehicles when your broke azz campaign has already done this to them before.
1322718842318061568 2020-11-01 09:55:21 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheRealHoarse It definitely should after this. This was straight up wrong. The rally had a permit so the cops shouldn't have even been there much less assaulting and arresting people.
1322717033771933696 2020-11-01 09:48:10 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DJJudd Guess they don't believe in the addage "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me" huh?

1322629360394792961 2020-11-01 03:59:47 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @sarahcpr Yep. My ballot was received yesterday and will be counted. 100% blue!

1322620780828479488 2020-11-01 03:25:41 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @YourAlteredEgo @JustinSandefur Very few states begin counting before election day, many aren't even allowed to process them in preparation for counting. We need to get repugnicans out of state legislator positions nationwide if we want more fair election procedures and to end gerrymandering. It's that simple.
1322617236503228416 2020-11-01 03:11:36 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TongueTwister42 @sarahchblum @DrDathanPaterno @ericcervini Ramming vehicles is not mostly peaceful. Trying to run a bus off the road is not mostly peaceful. You've got a strange idea of what peaceful means.
1322614444560535552 2020-11-01 03:00:31 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RiffRaf979 @RafaelAnchia Many of them declare it with pride, it's revolting that they see being deplorable as a badge of honor.

1322597588273524742 2020-11-01 01:53:32 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SethAbramson Happy Birthday, Seth. Seems a fine thing to gift yourself with a new path. I look forward to seeing what that path is.
1322513205676003328 2020-10-31 20:18:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Merciless365 @MeauxDawn Mine was received in CA and will be counted. Love having ballot tracking!

1322509912874733568 2020-10-31 20:05:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @timtime2 @dukewindsor388 Since Trump.
1322509202548420609 2020-10-31 20:02:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @pennyparker0523 @charmcity1973 @JoeBiden Age discrimination is real. My job was outsourced overseas in 2019. I just turned 60 in August and still don't have a job. Many young, college grads willing to work at low starting wages to get in the door means they don't want to hire someone 5 years from retiring for more $.
1322451671914409985 2020-10-31 16:13:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @rollawayjim @TheRealHoarse Me too but have the flu so really not a lot if choice in it. I'd only been out shopping with a mask last Monday so not like I get around much anyway. 🙂 Think the coins in my change may have had the bug on them. Dodged a bullet. Debit card purchases it is from now on!
1322449795760316416 2020-10-31 16:06:15 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @dizzleflyzz619 Why is that? My name is poking fun at idiot Nunes.

1322356607020400640 2020-10-31 09:55:57 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheRealHoarse Tested covid negative, it's just a bad flu!
1322355038132514816 2020-10-31 09:49:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @1984writer @DesignationSix Or resign 1/19/21 and have Pence pardon him. Think he knows that pardoning himself might not work and won't take that chance. Up until then he'll do everything possible to ruin our government.
1322351581770117122 2020-10-31 09:35:59 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LindseyGrahamSC Just shut up and resign, Lindsey. You're an embarrassment to the US and a disgrace to your constituents.
1322351114105229312 2020-10-31 09:34:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> Yay! Covid test was negative! Never thought I'd be so happy to have the flu 😂
1322327013663805441 2020-10-31 07:58:22 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @jagregg @bessbell Not if there are enough votes, a big enough margin to be definitive. There won't be an auto-recount if the margins are big enough. If there are no auto-recounts I don't think it goes to SCOTUS.
1322325830589063169 2020-10-31 07:53:40 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @4everminty @mayatcontreras @bessbell I think they'll announce it saying this is the "Red mirage" they've been warning us about for weeks.

1322321305803218944 2020-10-31 07:35:41 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @QuancyClayborne Why wouldn't early in-person votes be counted on the 3rd? They're not mail in votes and seems to me they should be counted with in-person votes from the 3rd.
1322312891261886469 2020-10-31 07:02:15 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MeidasTouch Looks like fake Melania says "Fvck Off" or maybe "that's enough" But definitely looks more like "fvck off" 😁😁

1322297344470085633 2020-10-31 06:00:28 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mmpadellan Because the real one can't stand being near him?
1322234623380762624 2020-10-31 01:51:14 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin It really ticks me off when Bob Woodward is being interviewed he almost always tries to bring up how #MAGAts are mostly good, decent people that we need to try to understand. I wholeheartedly disagree and won't waste my time on them. Maybe once they're de-programmed.
1322233640898625538 2020-10-31 01:47:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin If I could understand what's wrong with them/their brains to cause them to be so blind to his evil I'd be too close it and might never recover (or get out of the shower). I view not being able to grok them as a positive thing.
1322232635783983104 2020-10-31 01:43:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @attyrose23 @chipfranklin They can't truly identify with him because he's richer than they'll ever be and grew up that way. They do identify with his racism, hatred, and always whining about not getting his own way. They also believe that he's "pro-life" but he isn't, just needed evangelistas to win.
1322116843360845825 2020-10-30 18:03:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AdamParkhomenko Between the coke and the anxiety of feeling prison getting closer every day the dude is losing what little mind he had left.

1321993550192537601 2020-10-30 09:53:18 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @donwinslow Been donating to Jon since he ran for Congress in 2018. He's awesome!
1321986939969392640 2020-10-30 09:27:02 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mmpadellan We will be doing our annual viewing of Rocky Horror Picture Show and refilling the bowl in the driveway as needed. I'm very sick with something, got tested for covid this am but it's probably a flu.
1321985712997036032 2020-10-30 09:22:09 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @mmpadellan We are going to put out a bowl in the driveway with a "please take just one" sign on it. So sad. I love Halloween &amp; was going to have a huge party this year since it's on a Saturday. I do up my yard with a fog machine,etc. Probably be dead by the time it's on a Saturday again 😢

1321547343036968960 2020-10-29 04:20:14 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin Filled out my ballot a few days ago. Will have hubby drop at a box once he gets home. Have developed a fever and want to get it received in case I'm incapable of taking it to my polling place next week.
1321545583375495168 2020-10-29 04:13:14 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @chipfranklin Unsurprising.

Apparently I'm actually sick 😕 Can still smell and taste stuff so hoping it's not covid as I have an autoimmune clotting disorder that makes survival challenging. Only went out once 2 days ago for cat food &amp; wore an N95.

1321509468597743617 2020-10-29 01:49:44 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MeidasTouch @omaha_scanner Well remember he said senior citizens were essentially nobodies. He isn't the least bit concerned about his #MAGAts, and views the seniors among them as disposable.

So glad hubby and I are so simpatico politically and just about every other way that counts. Kudos to you, no way I could do it.
1321506557146722304 2020-10-29 01:38:10 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JohnstonSharon @PreetBharara That is why voting in massive numbers is the only solution to affect his ousting.

If they did and happen to become deceased between now and 11/3 watch Trump insist their votes should still count. Sorry, but being old doesn't excuse people for being racist, stupid, and extremely careless.

I basically stopped pot 42 years ago because it changed how it affected me, made me super paranoid &amp; anxious. Tried it a couple of times since and the effect was even worse. Start slow if you decide to do it. Hope it works for you! 🙂

Had a TIA in 14, was taken to a hospital that turned out to be a stroke center. CTs showed a large artery in my brain had been blocked by previous CVAs. ⬇ vocabulary see a Doc!
1321250592862269440 2020-10-28 08:41:03 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @inthenow @BadkingMwahaha Why are you retweeting RU state-affiliated media?

1321221405141131264 2020-10-28 06:45:04 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AngrierWHStaff That and testing has significantly decreased so the number of people actually infected is much higher than the 80k reported positive yesterday. 🤬🤬🤬🤬

1321217954713776130 2020-10-28 06:31:22 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @3552rene @SweetFnLucifer Yeah. Mailing ballots at this point is pretty much an exercise in futility. Anyone with mail in ballots outstanding need to take them to an official ballot box instead, preferably one that can't be tampered with or set on fire.
1321216899015831552 2020-10-28 06:27:10 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MysterySolvent I was so glad to see Nicolle &amp; Claire take down @Peggynoonannyc Why does Noonan even think her opinions are relevant? Guess her calling for Trump's censure after the Mueller report was BS to cover her misogyny &amp; racism. She should just retire &amp; live on memories of her glory days.
1321200412129595392 2020-10-28 05:21:39 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AngrierWHStaff I sure hope once Biden is inaugurated in January that Twitter starts applying the normal TOU to Trump's account so he can be reported and, eventually, banned. Send his butt to Parler permanently.
1321199721893908485 2020-10-28 05:18:55 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DeadLetterBox @AngrierWHStaff Yes. The footnotes were additional 🔥🔥🔥🔥!

We must flip the Senate every election for the next 6 years if that's what it takes to get the 67 votes needed to impeach her. She lied under oath at her hearing. Kavanaugh did too.

Free to shout to the world about just what an incompetent, corrupt fool Trump is. Only wish he'd have started a bit sooner.
1320820453959630850 2020-10-27 04:11:50 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @christymferg @TheRickWilson Think he was already on anticoagulants for a cardiac issue, maybe they upped his dose due to COVID. To me it looks like IVs in both hands infiltrated, anticoagulants can cause dramatic bruising. The bruising around his lips looks like post-intubation bruising. Surgery or COVID 🤷‍♀️
1320795409711689728 2020-10-27 02:32:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @morgan313 @TheRickWilson He actually has bruising around his lips too, as though he was incubated at some point.

1319887681149571072 2020-10-24 14:25:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @atrupar Went to my mom's to fix a setting on her cell phone (have it in easy mode so she can't hose it completely &amp; had to switch it over to make changes). Was there maybe a total of 45 minutes and wore an N95 the whole visit. No hugs or beverages. Hadn't seen her in months, it's hard 😣

1319836913310650369 2020-10-24 11:03:36 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @EdanClay @realDonaldTrump Personally I really don't care what they have on him as long as it doesn't affect the US and national security. What I want to see is investigations &amp; convictions of Trump, his kids, his administration, corrupt GOP &amp; Jack to block his Twitter acct for constant violations of TOU.

1319497861587816449 2020-10-23 12:36:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @foodandwhining @wolfeman911 @SteveSchmidtSES I didn't have the typical symptoms of stroke when they were occurring, when I had a TIA that evinced stroke symptoms I was transported to a hospital that, fortunately, was a CVA center. The CTs and MRIs I had showed the prior stroke damage. Was only 54 then so not typical.
1319496812055523329 2020-10-23 12:32:09 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @foodandwhining @wolfeman911 @SteveSchmidtSES tPA is the clot buster given immediately following a CVA to minimize the severity of the outcome 🙂 One of the main arteries in my brain is pretty much blocked. The areas it supplies blood to include memory which is why my vocabulary went away for a while.

1319478291158298625 2020-10-23 11:18:33 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RadioFreeTom You're correct. Whoever had control of the mute mic button was obviously either cowed by Trump or not paying attention to the debate or moderator.

1319443573448687621 2020-10-23 09:00:36 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @wolfeman911 @foodandwhining @SteveSchmidtSES Maybe but they have medical facilities at the WH and staff that could monitor him 24/7. Also he was MIA for several days after and when finally visible had noticable bruising on his forehead and a healing lac that makeup couldn't cover fully. Thought I saw a shunt in a later pic.
1319429566625005568 2020-10-23 08:04:57 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @QuancyClayborne "It's true... It's TWUE!!!!" Madeline Kahn was so damned good in this role. Was nominated for an Academy Award for it.

1319378950343118848 2020-10-23 04:43:49 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @foodandwhining @wolfeman911 @SteveSchmidtSES When I saw him struggling to come up with origins I was like "Aha! I recognize that behavior!". I never substituted a wrong word but would stammer until I could find a synonym. I recovered a lot of my vocabulary but not 100%, don't think he has. Think the Nov WR trip was for tPA.
1319377264627216384 2020-10-23 04:37:07 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @foodandwhining @wolfeman911 @SteveSchmidtSES Yeah, it swings outward when he steps forward and his right arm just hangs limp, doesn't swing with his forward movement like most people. He's had CVAs. Also when he couldn't come up with the word origins saying oranges instead. Had 6 strokes in 2014 that killed my vocabulary.
1319376106793807872 2020-10-23 04:32:31 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @LeoraBach @SteveSchmidtSES For office. No way he's able to physically run.
1319375755109781505 2020-10-23 04:31:07 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ivyfeinstein @SteveSchmidtSES It's the right side of his body that's affected and has been ever since last November. Watch when he walks how his right leg swings outward instead of forward and his arm just hangs limp at his side. He's definitely had some issues with CVAs.
1319375050328338432 2020-10-23 04:28:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SteveSchmidtSES Perhaps the COVID (if he actually had it) caused some more TIAs or strokes since it does cause coagulopathy.

1319178118318313472 2020-10-22 15:25:47 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @stablegeniusinc @DrEricDing Both Regeneron, which Trump was given, and Lilly's monoclonal antibodies which Christie was given have similar price tags. Not sure if 1.5 million is for a single dose or full course. Trump owns stock in Regeneron I believe.

1318616878063837184 2020-10-21 02:15:37 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SenatorHassan @GrandoniRobert Then impeach Kavanaugh for the same thing, lying under oath during his hearing. That frees up two SCOTUS seats for much better justice candidates.

1318367297585606657 2020-10-20 09:43:52 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SusanLeeMuir3 Yeah. I thought of a gong but either of those would also drown out Biden.

1318346486007001090 2020-10-20 08:21:10 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ChidiNwatu @kylegriffin1 He already sent a letter to the commission complaining about the selected topics for the debate so he's already halfway to backing out, this will be the reason for completing the back out. I'm just fine with it. Anything that means less of him on my TV screen is appreciated 👍
1318344764161363968 2020-10-20 08:14:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @kylegriffin1 Trump's already trying to bail on the debate, this should be the clincher.
1318343680088969217 2020-10-20 08:10:01 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @collinrees @exxonmobil Big Oil also lied about the recyclability of plastics. It was an ad stunt them putting the recycle triangular emblems on all kinds of plastic items despite the only plastic actually being recycled being soda bottles &amp; milk jugs. Everything else goes in landfill! They always lie!

1318317344909766656 2020-10-20 06:25:22 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @WestonJK @RonaldKlain @WalshFreedom He probably tested + before the 1st debate and was hoping to transmit the virus to Biden. That would explain the timeline of his covid infection being so brief. That's assuming he ever did have the virus and wasn't counting on his entourage being the vessels of infection.
1318316462541471744 2020-10-20 06:21:52 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @douglevy @RonaldKlain Nope. He's trying to change the agreed upon topics and when refused will bail on the debate. Fine with me.

He was intentionally trying to infect Biden. It's why he &amp; his showed up too late to test and why his entourage removed their masks. His first + test was likely 4-7 days before the debate &amp; is why last - is hidden.

Maybe if your candidate hadn't been such a freakin' rude, belligerent miscreant during the 1st debate, &amp; hadn't declined to appear in the 2nd debate, he'd have had a chance to discuss his love for KJU, Putin, Duterte, Erdogan &amp; bad behavior with allies. Tough 💩 now!

I'd be more generous &amp; give them 30 total.

The virus already has multiple mutations so keeping up with including efficacy against emerging mutations could be a nightmare.
1317943497295425536 2020-10-19 05:39:50 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TrefoilArabella @DrTomFrieden @JonScherm There have already been cases of re-infection just months after the initial infection so we do know that it seems the immunity conferred by infection can be very limited. I believe at least one of the vaccine candidates consists of 2 inoculations given a week or more apart.

1317930111912431616 2020-10-19 04:46:39 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @GarySkramer @DrTomFrieden Actually studies have shown the number will be much higher, between 2.5-6 million deaths for a 3-4 month period of immunity.
1317929168089223169 2020-10-19 04:42:54 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TrefoilArabella @DrTomFrieden @JonScherm Yes. US studies estimate that the # is much higher than stated here, between 2.5-6 million deaths in the fruitless endeavor to reach 60% "immunity" in our population. Since it appears contracting the virus confers only a brief period of immunity "herd immunity" is unachievable.

1317903348117336064 2020-10-19 03:00:18 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ChuckWendig Even if previous infection conferred lifetime immunity, it doesn't, by the time we got to 60% of the population post-infection the death toll is estimated to be 2.5-6 million. An unacceptable outcome by any standard! This is the strategy of a man who'd rather golf than govern!
1317899850491392000 2020-10-19 02:46:24 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ChuckWendig Exactly! Been trying to explain this to herd-heads. Herd immunity is not possible when having contracted the virus previously doesn't confer immunity for more than a few months. I  believe that's one of the problems we face with developing effective vaccines also. Not an option!

Our fluffy cats don't even like scissors used on them. I got a set that works really well for cutting mats w/o risking cutting skin. I still have to be sneaky about it.

The bathroom looked like a murder had occurred in it as I take coumadin and aspirin daily for an autoimmune clotting disorder.

It didn't hurt her but when she suddenly became aware her tail was trapped she panicked and bit deeply into my leg and then my hand as I grabbed my leg &amp; stood

She bit almost to the bone when I picked her up to move her to a carry board in a safe place. Didn't blame her one bit. She had multiple pelvic fractures. Our vet said she wasn't

Switched to trying it straight out of the squeeze up packaging after the hand biting &amp; they used their very sharp claws on my hand to pull the tube in their direction vs another kitten's.🤣
1315012502736965633 2020-10-11 03:33:07 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @wlklinkenberg @1980Dorothy Have had to do courses of antibiotics for 2 separate bites that became infected just hours after the bite. These were deep bites tho, surface bites aren't bad. I take coumadin &amp; aspirin for an AI clotting disorder so with 13 cats &amp; 10 semi-feral rescue kittens I bleed a lot 🤣

He's a ragdoll and they're well known for their beautiful coats and glorious tails, also for liking to bite as play and remaining kitten like in their behaviors for many years. He's not quite 2 &amp; a half yet and no sign of adulting yet 🤣

1315006884328271872 2020-10-11 03:10:47 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @StopTheCriminal The only way he'll resign is just before inauguration and only with Pence agreeing to pardon him once he does. Until then he'll stick around and destroy as much as of our government as possible in the lame duck period.

If they manage to push Barrett through as a SCOTUS justice it's going to become even worse than it currently is. The cult she's in sees women as lesser than men, subservient to men, so we can expect her rulings to take women's rights back to stone age levels.

He'd had 2 failed adoptions (1 was the idiots not looking at his age to see he was a kitten despite his huge size &amp; wanted a sedate lap cat) so unsure what happened that made him hate brushing so much  https://t.co/X6vf9Ca3Sy

I've tested negative for SLE so far but with APS if I contract COVID-19 the likelihood of survival is pretty low. Hubby is often at risk of exposure as a FF Paramedic so it's getting dicey.

It's one of the reasons the vaccines aren't single dose inoculations. Many who had a mild/asymptomatic case the 1st time are much sicker the 2nd.

Sure, but overall it's just a vast group of like minded people whose common goal is the removal of the evil regime currently posing as government via organizing real time action &amp; social interaction. There truly is power in numbers.
1314170144340414464 2020-10-08 19:45:53 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @pattymooney @EdanClay @realDonaldTrump Yes, cliques. Thank you. If being openly resistant to this abomination of a potus, its administration, and the GOP makes me part of a clique so be it. I really don't think the term fits though because cliques are usually small, exclusionary groups with a "one true way" mindset.

1313669013583454208 2020-10-07 10:34:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DanielleCandela Pretty sure he was infectious at the debate and knew it. Also think he was hoping to intentionally transmit the virus to Biden. He had his family/entourage remove their masks once in the Hall in so one of them could transmit it if he didn't manage to.

1313590173234388992 2020-10-07 05:21:17 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> This is 100% truth!! Trump is actively working to destroy our environment to save a few jobs in dead/dying pollution generating energy industries rather than embracing new technologies and funding training for employees of the environment destroyers!  👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
1313588423651848192 2020-10-07 05:14:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ZemanLynnZ Then @JoeBiden gave one of the best speeches I've ever heard at Gettysburg proving once again just how unfit for office Trump is without mentioning his name even once. #GoJoe #BidenHarrisLandslide

1313568482760376322 2020-10-07 03:55:05 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JudyHager11 Hell, Trump tested positive by rapid test and still went to NJ for his fund raiser.

She attended an event he hosted, didn't mask or social distance then promptly went home and infected her daughter. SMDH. She cares more about Trump than her own family.

It's an excellent song for memorializing someone so very loved and important in your life.

1313408839287357445 2020-10-06 17:20:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> It sounds like he's saying he intentionally got infected with COVID. I really hope he's just crazy talking due to the steroids!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
1313408277384896513 2020-10-06 17:18:29 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ProjectLincoln So wait.. If he's saying he deliberately got infected with COVID did he intentionally invite someone with COVID to the Rose Garden ceremony? Was anyone else involved in this? I truly hope he's just crazy talking as the thought of anyone holding an event for this purpose is 🤬🤬🤬

1313343957233881090 2020-10-06 13:02:54 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @QuadroP4 @Timodc I was thinking the same after he tweeted he'd be leaving the hospital this evening. They must be so glad to be rid of him and all the BS that accompanied his stay! Probably enjoying the peace and quiet and lack of #MAGAts hanging out honking their horns.

1313315371294748672 2020-10-06 11:09:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ChuckWendig According to Claudia Conway he is far from "all good". She spoke about it on tiktok. Guess she overheard Kellyanne and/or George on phone calls or talking to each other. Shrug. Pretty sad when you have to get such info from a 15 year old because the WH is lying.

1313250420714663936 2020-10-06 06:51:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MarkHarrisNYC I was so pleased to hear that journalist call out those two questions! Bravo to whoever it was! Of course Trump just ignored him but it did look like he flinched a bit. Probably using all the breath he had available just to walk to M1, if he actually has COVID that is.

Pretty suspect that he/his entourage arrived "too late" to be tested then refused to comply with mask rules. I believe he knew he was positive at that time and was intentionally trying to infect Biden!
1313238866472570880 2020-10-06 06:05:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheEliasRework @olhowling_husky Numbers aside, herd immunity doesn't work when having had the virus doesn't prevent re infection just months after initial infection. There are now many reports of people who initially had mild or no symptoms with their 1st bout becoming re-infected and having horrible symptoms.
1313237608214880256 2020-10-06 06:00:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheEliasRework @olhowling_husky Actually 2 million is the low end of the estimate with 6.5 million deaths being possible.

Only one of them is even available with an FDA emergency use authorization! You've been turned into a big orange laboratory rat. COVID isn't done with you, you're barely 5 days into it, enjoy the ride.

One, Regeneron, has only had a 300 person trial, isn't FDA approved, &amp; Remdesivir, an investigative antiviral that's only available under an FDA emergency use authorization. Trump is just a big, dumb, orange guinea pig.

1313176783701770240 2020-10-06 01:58:37 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @StoryDale @TheRealHoarse Well I was taking HRT and doing quasi ok up until 6 years ago when it was determined I'd had 6 strokes and was diagnosed with APS (autoimmune clotting disorder) and had to switch to coumadin instead. Then just 2 years later Trump happened. 🤬
1313041661761515520 2020-10-05 17:01:41 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @realDonaldTrump They did say the dexamethasone could cause delusions.
1313035152801423360 2020-10-05 16:35:50 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheRealHoarse I call it MenoTrump. Combination of surgical menopause and the worst president to ever hold office doing nonstop damage to our country.

1313019388950319104 2020-10-05 15:33:11 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Mike281mike @PattyArquette I said that about whoever swabbed his nasal passages at the WH for his COVID test.. Just one extra swab...

1313015314993430531 2020-10-05 15:17:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @citizengatsby Perfect description!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1312995738448588800 2020-10-05 13:59:12 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheIowan1 @matthewamiller I used to enjoy post-apocalyptic sci-fi. Trump's reign of hate, anger, and destruction has ruined that for me as I feel like I've been living in those books for the last 4 years.
1312994256320040961 2020-10-05 13:53:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @matthewamiller I'm looking forward to getting back to reading non-political books again!!

1312961534268592130 2020-10-05 11:43:18 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ProjectLincoln @talleez @cindyhydesmith @MikeEspyMS He is highly qualified to serve the people of MS as their Senator and I sincerely hope he beats @SenHydeSmith who is just an awful and unqualified person! Have donated to his campaign 🙂
1312958960295505920 2020-10-05 11:33:04 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Oh please! He signed blank pieces of paper. He doesn't actually do any work regardless of his location. As long as he has cable TV and KFC he's perfectly content to continue pretending to work.

1312957397426552832 2020-10-05 11:26:51 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> I've been told much has been said about the judgement of someone nominated for SCOTUS who would bring her children to an event at the WH with no social distancing &amp; few masks &amp; not make them wear masks but I must have missed it in all the Trump COVID scroll #ACBIsUnfitForSCOTUS
1312956418174009345 2020-10-05 11:22:58 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DeityFree @AnandWrites I haven't seen anything about her kids, only about people not wearing masks or social distancing. Probably missed it in the monster scroll of Trump COVID announcements.
1312955176592916481 2020-10-05 11:18:02 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AnandWrites @DeityFree I can't believe nobody's said anything about this so I will.  Why is nothing being said about the judgement of someone nominated for SCOTUS who would bring her children to an event at the WH with no social distancing &amp; few masks and not make them wear masks?? #ACBIsUnfitForSCOTUS
1312952145725980672 2020-10-05 11:05:59 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CVanRenesse @MattNegrin @tazarae20 Same here. S'why I call him #UpChuckTodd .
1312951838723907585 2020-10-05 11:04:46 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> .@MSNBC Could you please tell Todd to stop with the RW Trump sycophants as guests? Or better yet, lose Todd!?
1312947819792101377 2020-10-05 10:48:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @yasminv Supposedly he's had 4 tests since the Rose Garden event all of which were negative. The article didn't say if they were rapid tests or the standard test. The rapid tests are 30-50% inaccurate so hopefully they were standard. Don't care if he gets it, don't want him spreading it!
1312944549942030336 2020-10-05 10:35:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @BlueGirlsRule @sam_vinograd @yasminv @ChuckGrassley Man is 87 years old, COVID won't even break a sweat taking him out. He shouldn't be allowed in any government building in DC without a negative covid PCR test result within the last 24 hours, no rapid tests allowed!
1312937240079687680 2020-10-05 10:06:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @electroboyusa @EdanClay @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump That's fine but can we *please* get them some N95 masks?? Watching them fuss with the ill fitting, flimsy, cloth or surgical masks is appalling! Every time they touch/pinch the front to push it higher on their noses I cringe. We must protect them! Jill &amp; Doug should get them too.
1312925603679535104 2020-10-05 09:20:31 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ChuckWendig Yep. Been saying Trump isn't a victim of COVID, he's a victim of his own failures, as a human and a potus.
1312924730832244739 2020-10-05 09:17:03 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @theasscat @DrGJackBrown His right arm and leg have been weak ever since last November's trip to WR. Remember him not being able to lift a glass of water with his right hand/arm? Since COVID causes clots in some people it's possible he's having some increased Neuro issues.
1312923266315509760 2020-10-05 09:11:14 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @askCharlie_com @DrGJackBrown That's the SUV he took from Marine 1 landing zone to the WR entrance on Friday. The Beast is likely at the WH being sanitized.
1312922315395461125 2020-10-05 09:07:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @jenblethen @american2084 @DrGJackBrown I figured he got convalescent plasma on his trip to India at the end of February so that was why he seemed so cavalier about exposing himself to possibly COVID rich environments, especially maskless. If he did have it then it must have worn off. Imagine he thought he was immune.
1312921149064441857 2020-10-05 09:02:49 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Lochlannach101 @Salacia_sea @DrGJackBrown Actually I believe that's part of the shunt drain tube.
1312920586927001600 2020-10-05 09:00:35 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DrGJackBrown He was in that very same SUV for the trip from Marine 1 to the hospital entrance so apparently they felt it was safe enough for very short jaunts.
1312916456414216192 2020-10-05 08:44:10 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @BradRincker @ProjectLincoln @JasonMillerinDC @CNN @NBCNews @MSNBC @ABC @FoxNewsSunday I can't stand #UpChuckTodd He constantly has RW guests on his show and rarely stops them when they unleash a torrent of absolute lies and propaganda and most often fails to call them out on their BS. I don't understand why MSNBC keeps him on, I really don't.
1312913108881399808 2020-10-05 08:30:52 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DrLeanaWen @EdanClay @AnaCabrera @CNNnewsroom @realDonaldTrump In the brief video he uploaded before taking his covid MAGA appreciation lap he didn't sound like he was totally present of mind to me. Haven't heard him use the royal "We" before so was it the others in his head he was speaking for when saying "We love the US"? Restraint time?
1312900695993933824 2020-10-05 07:41:33 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Itsagoodlife48G @rogertansey @Gaohmee I have to dig into my SF event photos, have some awesome #ProudBoys photos 🙂

1312875780079153152 2020-10-05 06:02:32 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @berta_legas @thomaskaine5 .@MikeEspyMS is incredibly qualified to represent MS in the Senate. The interviews I've seen with him were very impressive. I've donated to help him beat @SenHydeSmith who's made some truly despicable comments about lynching.
1312874686754086912 2020-10-05 05:58:12 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @thomaskaine5 Also support @MikeEspyMS to help us get rid of super bigot @SenHydeSmith!! He's doing much better in the polls than he was earlier this year! Go Mike!!!
1312873303820754944 2020-10-05 05:52:42 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JenKirkman @WordsOnIce He's putting everyone in that vehicle with him at risk but he doesn't care about his lowly servants. He is one of the most vile, inhuman, amoral pos on the planet!
1312872553455644672 2020-10-05 05:49:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> Yep. Trump and Ghouliani have always been crooks.

1312868694393982976 2020-10-05 05:34:23 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @FormerAppleSoul Awesome! Gotta go to my PO box in the South Bay tomorrow to pick up mine!
1312868020063092737 2020-10-05 05:31:42 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @DanRather @FormerAppleSoul Hoping they take that signed blank sheet of paper and turn it into his signed transfer of POTUS power to Mike Pence. Only a total moron signs a blank piece of paper.
1312866585162379264 2020-10-05 05:26:00 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Donvito1492 @Bob_Wachter @MJdowntheshore Oh I've been paying attention. His weight &amp; height lies are obvious to anyone with working eyes. I don't know many overweight people, myself included, who haven't fudged a bit on the weight #s on forms, though not in such drastic #s. Docs' lies now are on a very different level.
1312848910352752640 2020-10-05 04:15:46 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @tweetmommybop @Yates58 Yesterday @yasminv referred to Trump as a "victim" of COVID. I yelled "He's NOT a victim!!". If he'd acted quickly when he knew of covid it's unlikely he'd have it now. His irresponsible actions led to his own infection &amp; now he's getting treatments unavailable to anyone else!
1312842000031518722 2020-10-05 03:48:18 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Yates58 Am sure there are many of his cronies that own stock in Regeneron (NASDAQ:  REGN). Want to bet Loeffler and Burr bought in when they heard about the small study being done for its use in COVID treatment?? Hey @KLoeffler how much stock do you and your hubby own in Regeneron??
1312838831834451968 2020-10-05 03:35:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @FritsV4 @Yates58 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Golden tweet right here!
1312838329252020225 2020-10-05 03:33:43 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @jbmtweetz @HarryPotterMAGE Yep. Karma is getting her MAGA on!
1312838182157783040 2020-10-05 03:33:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @HarryPotterMAGE In other words, Karma is getting her MAGA on!!
1312837719551209472 2020-10-05 03:31:18 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JerbalKeb @FakeDeanAcheson @AndrewFeinberg @alaynatreene I think they need to fill in that blank document making it his agreement to transfer power to Pence. Only an absolute idiot signs a blank page! 🤣🤣🤣
1312837108109729792 2020-10-05 03:28:52 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JennRooney1 @AndrewFeinberg @alaynatreene Yes, yes it is!! Well played! 👍🏆🏆🏆
1312836242388652032 2020-10-05 03:25:26 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @indictmentduck Of the 4 duos listed I think charges are probably likely for all but McConnell &amp; Graham. While they're definitely unethical AF am pretty sure they'll be able to hide behind the "just doing our job" excuse and have likely been extremely thorough at covering up any illegality.
1312834429392318464 2020-10-05 03:18:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @indictmentduck You need a 5th choice for "all of the above"!
1312833564350640128 2020-10-05 03:14:47 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MrsYosemiteSam @SweetFnLucifer Well in this case if doctors "spill" any medical information about Trump and/or his current condition without his consent they'll end up being sued &amp; probably be formally disciplined by the medical board which could affect their license to practice &amp; possibly be court marshalled.
1312830703231332352 2020-10-05 03:03:25 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @twitone @meganyspoogle @SweetFnLucifer Yep. He is not required to release info about his medical condition &amp; treatment and his doctors can't do so without his consent or they violate HIPAA. Stating false or misleading information at his direction is, however, unethical as fvck!
1312829525177237505 2020-10-05 02:58:44 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MyStupidTown @SweetFnLucifer @Scattered211 Been saying this for a long time, even before COVID happened. If he carcs it the GOP will use prerecorded videos to keep him "alive" virtually until they get everything they wanted.
1312828222669647872 2020-10-05 02:53:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> While we pretty much figured this was one of the ways Trump's campaign used the Cambridge Analytica data they acquired from Facebook, seeing the actual files designating POC as deterrents is still shocking. He, his administration, and his campaign are all indescribably vile!
1312823101806108672 2020-10-05 02:33:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @Donvito1492 @Bob_Wachter @MJdowntheshore Well they're telling *us* what *he* wants us to hear, am sure they're telling *him* the truth. That's not only not malpractice but entirely the patient's decision and, under HIPAA, the patient's right. Lying about his illness &amp; treatment at his direction is unethical AF though.

I know they're scarce thanks to Trump but, considering the infection rate in Trump's administration, the Senate, and probably a ton of rally attending MAGAts they need protection from deliberate transmission!!

1312476093866151937 2020-10-04 03:34:20 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @AngelaBelcamino @realDonaldTrump Yeah, not Trump. They're getting better at copying his caps style but he wouldn't say "likewise" and he'd call it the China virus, not the plague. Also far too much punctuation in use. Extra credit given for them using "Tremendous". I hear him slurring "inshtitushins" reading it.
1312471479288623106 2020-10-04 03:15:59 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> .@TwitterSupport This purported (R) candidate for US Congress in the SJ CA area is quote tweeting people's tweets with totally unrelated &amp; bizarre photos. Has her acct been hacked or is she just this crazy? A photo of a gun and confederate flag isn't going to win votes in SJ CA!

1312275860766900225 2020-10-03 14:18:40 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @PattyTeambiden @JoanieVee1 He tested negative but he has a few more days at least before he can be sure. On top of the SCOTUS nom party am sure he's been in Trump's and other infected people's company between then and now.

1312165248854421504 2020-10-03 06:59:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @EdanClay Would be nice if Pence did the right thing and discloses if he and Karen have been tested and the results of the tests. We have a right to know!
1312164301528948737 2020-10-03 06:55:22 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MarkViverito @SGarner2603 @EdanClay It was him. I agree he was slumping less than usual, probably to confer strength, but his right leg was still swinging outward as it's been doing since November, &amp; he did his OCD 3 taps on the top of the stair rail before he totally released it. Jowls looked a bit flushed too.
1312159975616118790 2020-10-03 06:38:11 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @lauriemarsh7 @EdanClay I knew he'd walk. That man is so concerned with his "image" no way he was going to be wheeled out.
1312159671415762945 2020-10-03 06:36:59 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @FoolsBelieve @EdanClay No announcement from Pence on whether he and Karen have been tested or the test results either. That should have been part of the statement he made about Trump's illness.
1312159230602878976 2020-10-03 06:35:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MuSicSuZ23 @EdanClay Yep. Walked to the Suburban for the drive from M1 to hospital entrance too.

If taken properly (in correct dose and route) adderall maintenance has the intended effect, focus for add/ADHD patients, alertness for people with narcolepsy. If someone is high on it then they're probably taking more than a prescribed dose.

1310800334315429889 2020-09-29 12:35:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ScotsAlan @BeauTFC @realDonaldTrump Because he won't allow people from other countries to catch him defrauding the election, he wants to blame any "irregularities" on the Dems and he can't do that with outside observers. Doubt many would come either between COVID and his thugs harassing people at the polls.
1310780191992500224 2020-09-29 11:15:25 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ScotsAlan @BeauTFC @realDonaldTrump Because he's lying. The only fraud going on in the election is him doing everything he can to suppress the vote of the people.

Ballots get counted and there were more votes for Dems than repugnicans. Take that info back to the Kremlin.
1310776912592027649 2020-09-29 11:02:23 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @PatrickNova6 @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately we'll have to settle for sedition since we're not in a declared war.

People who've had a mild case &amp; subsequently became infected again became much sicker the 2nd time around. Not that herd immunity was ever a good idea but yeah, no!!

No effing way she should have been nominated much less be considered!
1310018823894884352 2020-09-27 08:50:01 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @davidfrum @elliotcwilliams Especially since she already stated that she believes a SCOTUS justice should not be nominated in the last year of a presidency. She should decline, but she won't because she thinks all women should be hand maids, subservient to their husbands as her cult believes. She's a loon!
1310017260220637185 2020-09-27 08:43:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @BrunoAmato_1 Well Ms Barrett herself stated that a SCOTUS justice should not be nominated in the 4th year of a presidency. She should decline the nomination!!

1309608185012002816 2020-09-26 05:38:17 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @jaketapper Thank goodness we don't have "privacy envelopes" in CA. One thick return envelope, one signature on said envelope. I don't understand why some states insist on making what should be a simple process so complicated unless it's their way to attempt to suppress votes.

1309216600654925825 2020-09-25 03:42:16 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @senatemajldr That's funny because that isn't what your good buddy Trump is saying. If you vote to confirm a SCOTUS justice he is going to use the SCOTUS to invalidate the election. He SAID it! This isn't something you can affect. If you vote to confirm a justice you're complicit in sedition!

1309116128292204550 2020-09-24 21:03:01 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MittRomney To quote a now deceased friend that used to be a member of your religion "I'd rather see a sermon than listen to one"!
1309114549103140873 2020-09-24 20:56:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MittRomney Now he has publicly stated that he wants to install a SCOTUS justice who will help him "Get rid of the ballots". He has openly said he will make sure there will be no transition of power by ensuring the election will be corrupted by HIM! How's that going to sit with your God??!
1309113114244325380 2020-09-24 20:51:03 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MittRomney He has put someone in charge of USPS to destroy it and hamper people's ability to vote by mail during a pandemic. Has constantly made false claims about fraud being rampant with mail in ballots. Has campaign minions discussing rigging electoral votes with state GOP legislators.
1309110873357774852 2020-09-24 20:42:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MittRomney You should go back and reread your statement post-impeachment vote. You said "corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive &amp; destructive violation of one's oath of office I can imagine". It's why he wants to replace RBG before 11/3. Still a yes?!

1308490053421658112 2020-09-23 03:35:13 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @BonaireVolt @CNNBusiness You have to get to where you're going though. My brother has a very old Fleetwood RV from the 80s. He's a mechanic &amp; has been able to repair it &amp; replace parts as needed. He recently refurbished the roof that had been leaking, &amp; put in laminate flooring. He likes DYI projects.
1308485785096564736 2020-09-23 03:18:16 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JohnCleese No. Including Romney. I don't believe for a second that Collins and Murkowski will refuse to vote now that they're the sole hold outs either. The Republican Party no longer exists. It's now the MAGA party, where grifters, bigots, and people devoid of any decency serve a traitor.
1308484344047046657 2020-09-23 03:12:32 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> .@MSNBC Really?? We had to suffer through the BS of #MoscowMitch and assorted lying #Repugnicans talking sh*t but you cut off Dems after just Schumer &amp; another senator spoke (and he wasn't done). I realize it was host change time but then you didn't return to coverage of Dems! 🤬

There are some state coroner's offices that won't attribute deaths to COVID if they had one or more co-morbidity factors that increased the chances they'd die from it if they contracted COVID.
1308350358259822598 2020-09-22 18:20:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @BonaireVolt @CNNBusiness Plus they get really sucky gas mileage and break down a lot.

1306460186765217793 2020-09-17 13:09:16 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SupremePianos Me too! Can't believe the idiot who gave it to my family painted it black. It had the lovely scroll grills, slightless elaborate carvings on the ends, still had the original fabric behind the scrollwork grills too.  Sigh....
1306402177536024576 2020-09-17 09:18:45 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @soniaruiz1190 @beecornervn I don't recommend trying to take it with you on a plane. TSA will confiscate it.

1306398767705280514 2020-09-17 09:05:12 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @jennycohn1 @MalcolmNance JFC and this was before Trump started in with his "vote twice" crap. Do you think Kemp was behind this, knew about the problem with the machines in the primary and told Trump about it before it became public? Hell of a way to ensure a whole lot of votes get tossed out!
1306389672017276928 2020-09-17 08:29:04 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @StevenReyCristo @ProjectLincoln @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Wow. That's some über revolting imagery there... Very fitting comparison but 😖
1306384111808856064 2020-09-17 08:06:58 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @decaro_nick @deanbarker A rough few years. Hubby is a FF Paramedic 110 miles from here, up in Lake County. Feels like it's been fire season for the last 5 years. Doesn't appear things will be improving any time soon either. At least he retires in 3.5 years!
1306382942470467584 2020-09-17 08:02:19 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @SupremePianos We had a gorgeous Pease up right from the 1870s when I was a teen that some idiot painted black. I miss that piano ☹️  https://t.co/9ryD3ZuMoR
1306379350766358528 2020-09-17 07:48:03 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @MtlARN Hehe hehehe I have a little orphaned kitten with the same quarantine issue right now. She wants so badly to be out with the other 11 kittens but has to be flv/fiv tested first. Besides that she is so much tinier than the others she'll be trampled.
1306372658976546817 2020-09-17 07:21:27 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @decaro_nick @deanbarker Yes we did, much better today in the SF Bay Area and surrounding area. Hope yours improves soon!!

1306181354242015232 2020-09-16 18:41:17 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JakobL_18 @austinresister @Iwillnotfall @ProjectLincoln Most hospitals have contracts with insurance companies and pay far less than what is billed, unlike what they charge an uninsured patient. If insurance companies refused to pay high per Diem rates hospitals wouldn't be able to get that much.
1306180577783996417 2020-09-16 18:38:12 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @JakobL_18 @austinresister @Iwillnotfall @ProjectLincoln It's the insurance companies charging $8k for a bag of NS and an "admit kit" for a one night stay, they're paying a few bucks for both and charging $8k. The nursing staff sure as heck isn't making the $8k for a night's pay.
1306175148513353728 2020-09-16 18:16:37 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @CitiBE @austinresister @Iwillnotfall @ProjectLincoln What is your point? That insurance companies are evil, scum sucking bastards? Everyone already knows that. That's how it will be until they're forced to compete with other providers. Once Trump "won" office many of them dropped ACA coverage as his admin stopped paying them.
1306143274009202689 2020-09-16 16:09:58 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @ktumulty So that means all of his MAGAts are going to succumb???

1306139292171866112 2020-09-16 15:54:08 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> The consensus about tonight's #TrumpTownPall seems to be that it was another nail in the coffin of his presidency.

But that still doesn't mean the insurance companies aren't raking in huge $$$ from the high premiums they charge, that and denying claims as long as possible, forever if they can.

I've had people in line in front of me at the store doing that and thought they'd pull them back up at the cashier but they didn't. Stayed 12' back from them in line!

1306014384293064704 2020-09-16 07:37:48 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @callanreinke I'll be listening to #Compromised by Peter Strzok and caring for 12 kittens in addition to my own felines. The latest is a tiny orphaned tabby we've named Ranger. Much more pleasant to look at than #TraitorTrump  https://t.co/HM7KCMD6Ct

My husband is a firefighter paramedic in CA. He doesn't need to be wondering if the person he is fighting a fire with may have started the blaze. That is one crime that definitely should be a deal breaker.

It has been said that the real reason was him being caught in the act of sexual activity with another service member in the barracks.

They initially said it was an eye condition that, even back then, was curable with steroid eye drops in about a month. Then they said it was so he could attend University when he already had a degree. /1

Negligence supposes possibly unintentional harm and this was fully intentional. I think 1st degree murder times the total number of deaths.

Some are saying they think it's coke but I don't think coke would provide the energy bump he gets from adderall. I would, however, believe it could be meth.

I know meth is extremely caustic and probably could cause holes in the pallet even with less frequent use than cocaine.

Sure there are lots of webcam/porn accounts on here but prostitution kinda requires the physical presence of both parties. If you mean solicitation a general "suggesting illegal activities" would cover that.

1303061834660945920 2020-09-08 04:05:25 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @RosanneR429 @realDonaldTrump Yeah and the fact that people have run out of UI benefits doesn't mean unemployment is down but they don't count as "unemployed" because they're no longer on the unemployment rolls.
1303060878414114816 2020-09-08 04:01:37 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @realDonaldTrump You effing idiot! Those weren't created jobs, they're jobs people went back to when the businesses reopened. Your unemployment numbers are wrong too. Just because people ran out of benefits doesn't mean they're employed now. You really are a moron!

Just goes to show that experience and attitude can prevail over youth and enthusiasm. I mean, seriously, Markey sponsored the Senate version of the Green New Deal FFS!

1302879617322115072 2020-09-07 16:01:21 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @daveweigel Love that their unemployment numbers fail to take into account that in most states UI benefits stop after 6 months. You no longer count as unemployed once you're no longer collecting UI whether you're working or not.

The choices in this election are clear, good or evil. Not voting for good makes you complicit with evil and the wholesale destruction of our nation, period.

That's full on egotism and, actually, narcissistic af!

It's every bit as true as the fact that he barebacked a porn star while you were recovering from delivering your trick-baby.
1301989908454600704 2020-09-05 05:05:58 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @TheRickWilson Between this and them reporting actual poll numbers I'm sure they're not passing his loyalty test any more. He'll still take the advice of Hannity, Dobbs, and Carlson for how to run the country though. Look for his public fave to become OAN though since they toe the RT line.

1301942496776183808 2020-09-05 01:57:34 +0800 <EmbersFromAshes> @FLOTUS There are consequences for lying on your visa application too, for people not married to the #TraitorInChief anyway.
