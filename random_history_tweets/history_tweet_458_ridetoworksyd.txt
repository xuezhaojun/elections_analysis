1342385272558735360 2020-12-25 16:22:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @evilscootus What is it about this time of year?  Ours went late Dec 10 years ago, really hard to get any plumber action....we used it to get solar H/W installed.   Last year the fridge went toes up at this time......  I hope you can find a friendly competent plumber to replace it.
1342337948407099392 2020-12-25 13:14:40 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @PRGuy17 I'm still wondering how all the numbers reconcile daily?  Family tested 4 days ago, 72 hrs to get the result.  I assume they would prioritize close contacts, but there's time lag in getting results for the general public that get tested. They were contacts of a close contact.
1342334263434199045 2020-12-25 13:00:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @xskinn Merry Christmas Ian.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts and antics with us.
1340215202797604865 2020-12-19 16:39:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ssarthaktweets @the_howie No Foxtel (by choice)!   Sad to have missed Kerry.   Shane, not so much.
1340097967802368000 2020-12-19 08:53:47 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Anybody know what suburb Brian Houston lives in when he's in Australia?
1340097362660794369 2020-12-19 08:51:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @cheryl_kernot It's probably a quarantine exempt protected person, we will probably never know who it is.
1339916551772721156 2020-12-18 20:52:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @tourdecouch @siftinsand I had the binoculars out on the weekend, I could get both in the field of view.  I want to see them through a tetescope while they are so close to each other.  Saturns rings (hopefully a few moons) and Jupiter and its cloud bands and moons, all together  It will be quiet a sight.
1339912432471351298 2020-12-18 20:36:32 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @siftinsand It's been overcast in Sydney for the last 5 evenings/nights. I hope it clears up for the 21st, I'd really like to those this conjunction.
1339911270477131776 2020-12-18 20:31:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @EricaCampbell48 @normanswan @MargaretSimons The masks have been gone at Bunnings for months now.  My 2 local stores have been back to operations as normal since about August.
1339530745140764673 2020-12-17 19:19:51 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @northway_debbie @kaeleneak Maybe it just did on Sydney's northern beaches.....
1339530266243567616 2020-12-17 19:17:57 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @kaeleneak You might want to call that one in.  There's a pole number attached at about head height on the pole.  Google your power supplier, they'll have an online fault reporting link.  Otherwise, maybe no coffee in the morning.......

1338299964020019200 2020-12-14 09:49:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @slsandpet @YaThinkN I've resolved not to engage with them any more, it just saps your energy.  Nothing it seems will make them question the cult nature of their beliefs.  It took only 4 days to accrue the last 1 mil infections, heaven knows what the death rate will be in 3 weeks.
1338287146331881472 2020-12-14 08:58:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SafariPenguin "Dilemma" ??? Sorry I have no idea what that was supposed to be.  I hope it's all going Ok! Young kids make for a very busy life.
1338089992564793346 2020-12-13 19:54:49 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SafariPenguin The challenges are real. If only there was something the rest of us could do to help you do the science with less "interruptions", hmmmm. Free child care, oh, but we can't afford that (sports rorts, buying non existent water.......) Ailie, sorry to highjack dilemma.  Keep goingüëç
1338086660609691648 2020-12-13 19:41:34 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @the_howie Yeh, but the skill difference between teams?   It's like they have stretched the talent pool too thin.  Nobody wants to see one team get smashed they way they did tonight. and that's not a one off in the comp.  Or am I showing my egalitarian side to publicly?
1338082075581140992 2020-12-13 19:23:21 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @evilscootus @guerillacricket Is this what happens when they let the PR guy (apologies to @PRGuy17, who does sterling work) structure the competition.  BBL is all hype and no show.  I'd hate to be paying for it.
1338081020508160000 2020-12-13 19:19:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @the_howie @SixersBBL I've watched a bit of the BBL. Looks like they are just flogging a dead horse, it's like the script writers left and know body has any idea how it's supposed to go.  It's all hype and no show.  WBBL is much better but suffers the same.  Am I alone in thinking this?
1338044986630176769 2020-12-13 16:55:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CallieBuddy @sharitags Yep, words out of his own mouth, yet about 70 % of locals here think he's OK and will vote for him or Craig Kelly. Doing a great job, there mostly small business or tradies, I again state my contention that it's actually easy to make a living as a business/trade in Aust, too easy
1338042995300429826 2020-12-13 16:48:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @02deebo Thanks for asking!
1338041409740263424 2020-12-13 16:41:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @grottyscotty @ScienceLoverDan My NY resolution is not to engage with them on Twitter as you just can't win.  I still try the softly softly approach with face to face aquiaintences, but after 2020 the election that couldn't be lost and the Feds behaviour re Covid I have little patience for the unthinking.
1338038918436929538 2020-12-13 16:31:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @grottyscotty @ScienceLoverDan The last point is really hard.  It's  hard to have a rational discussion with them without being or seeming to be judgemental. I mean at every turn they have been self-centred, selfish, often racist and just plain ignorant.  It's really hard not to get their back up
1338037487449468930 2020-12-13 16:26:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @FatherBob Wishing you well Fr Bob, as are many, many others.  For an irreligious type like me, you are the best argument going around for there being a God, the embodiment of the ideal.  May you make a speedy and comfortable recovery and if that's not working, maybe get a whiskey into you.
1338035109576896512 2020-12-13 16:16:44 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AlexDevantier Would you believe, trying to find your address........
1338033925797498880 2020-12-13 16:12:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CallissClan You have the patience of a saint!  I'd be "get out out here....."
1337927976990609409 2020-12-13 09:11:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AlexDevantier I don't think so, there will be small scale skirmishes, but almost all of Trump supporters are just like him.   Great at blowing their mouths off but absolute cowards, they will run for cover and squeal for someone to protect them.
1337915883943956487 2020-12-13 08:22:58 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Congratulations on completing your BIG ride @rochellgilmore, quite an adventure.  Good luck if you go out again tomorrow, maybe only go as far as the Goulburn pie shop.....  https://t.co/YbyQVCFZnl
1337720675537092608 2020-12-12 19:27:17 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mars_stu Most deaths in Aust were in Aged Care, mostly due to the responsible Govt not having a plan to deal with quarantine. More workers were infected there than anywhere else.  I hope your organisation has a good handle on the protocols this time around.  Be careful.
1337718712472768512 2020-12-12 19:19:29 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mars_stu It's late down here, stay safe, wear a mask and stay at home.........Good night.
1337718087542435840 2020-12-12 19:17:00 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mars_stu Also important to not be a little sensationally ambiguous.  I was lucky enough 12 or so years ago to be one of the first few humans to look at high res mars surface images just after they were receive at Tidbinbilla, printed 1m x 6m, rolled out on the floor. Amazing to see.
1337715358040408066 2020-12-12 19:06:09 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mars_stu to quote your self "Ok, if that gnarly, twisted and torn chunk of shiny metal sitting there on the surface of Mars is *not* a meteorite then I don't know what is..."
1337714820146053120 2020-12-12 19:04:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ozlangur I'm glad to hear that someone is still spraying St John's Wort.  My father was always digging/spraying it up every time he saw it on the family farm at Mudgee. But these days I see it everywhere and don't see anyone concerned about it.
1337712160646959105 2020-12-12 18:53:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mars_stu Oh, i'm excited to see it, it looks like it's been there a very long time, just not the "it looks like a alien" stuff
1337710060097601536 2020-12-12 18:45:06 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ozlangur That's some climb!
1337709434680659971 2020-12-12 18:42:37 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mars_stu and the point is????  Mars has an atmosphere, very thin but it's there, anything hitting it at high speed will experience plasma erosion before it comes to a stop.
1337708838284234753 2020-12-12 18:40:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @adamhillscomedy @CarrollRory Hey Adam, glad you have may it into quarantine, many haven't.   It seems that people with a profile never seem to get their flights cancelled as sooooo many other Aussies have.   Maybe this is something you could have a dig around in while your in lockdown.
1337708253052977152 2020-12-12 18:37:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @adamhillscomedy @CarrollRory You are not alone, but what does that say about the "real" account, they both just make stuff up.
1337706292945645568 2020-12-12 18:30:08 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> We could do so much for these people by just letting them be free.  How hard is it!  As a country we gain nothing and loose everything by keeping them locked up.
1337705349592330241 2020-12-12 18:26:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mars_stu Classic meteorite surface erosion, nothing exceptional here!
1337624002852843520 2020-12-12 13:03:08 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton FYI any Sydney siders, here's some details of Rochelle Gilmore's final stage of her circumnavigation of NSW.

If we just hush the economist for a second and install enough wind and solar to meet our needs (including transmission losses, as we did with coal) all will be good.

Awesome ride!

1337343258578485248 2020-12-11 18:27:34 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @DanielMOakes It's good, really good.  How sad is it that every tweet makes you think, "is this the real account or the parody".  It shouldn't be that hard to tell.......
1337342350368993280 2020-12-11 18:23:57 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @GeraintThomas86 Rode home from work into a 50 to 70kmph head wind.  A Sydney southerly. BRUTAL 25km. Small chain ring and grind away. Took a few rest days after that.........
1337341349851320321 2020-12-11 18:19:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 Our resident Bluetongue beat us to our latest harvest.   Enjoy!

1337334196998574088 2020-12-11 17:51:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Glorious. A fitting epitaph.
1337320908705296386 2020-12-11 16:58:45 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Now think about this.   This "discussion" is how the Indue card discussion started, if it follows the same path in 18 months all this shit will be locked in.
1337318301492420608 2020-12-11 16:48:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 Yep, hopefully Covid will start to be reined in, Trump will be gone from the world, we'll be closer to the next Federal election.
1337317708799479817 2020-12-11 16:46:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 All the best for tonight to you too.  It's tough times at the moment, I really enjoy the fellowship and like thinking I find here. It means that there are at least a few people out there tat still care about what's happening.  Raise a üç∑ and hope that sense will prevail! ‚ù§Ô∏è
1337316888095858688 2020-12-11 16:42:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @rohan_connolly @Bill_FJ_Quinn @skyaustnews It's often hard to tell if it's the parody account or the real one, many have been caught out.  What does that tell you? (and that's not intended to be a slight on those that have been caught out)
1337316291384766464 2020-12-11 16:40:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 You're welcome, I find I come up with some of my best ideas after a glass or two.  Others will not agree, however after a glass or two, I am less concerned with others opinions.  P.S. I'm on glass 2 1/2 if you can't tell....
1337315401831600128 2020-12-11 16:36:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mattjcan That's really appalling.   Mining is only a small part of the Aust Corporate scene and pays almost NO TAX.  The none mining corporations, the lions share of Aust business are REALLY not paying their fare share.  Thanks for pointing this out to everyone.
1337151534254067712 2020-12-11 05:45:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @RochelleGilmore Put the gravel tires on and go for it, just a little slower and more carefully if it's wet.

1335565252264488960 2020-12-06 20:42:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @KaushalyaFem Someone got REALLY upset about this photo. The claim is that they took it and not the person tweeting it here.  How hard should we all try to find the originator of material we retweet?  Attribution?????
1335166112032419841 2020-12-05 18:16:21 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @evcricket @simonahac Design an after life in to the product, for one they would have an incentive to make them last a decent amount of time and make them repairable, both way cheaper then having to take the product back.

1334621661891502081 2020-12-04 06:12:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JaneCaro @elyasgarad I hope you are right Jane.  It not looking good though, around where I live Covid is over blown, climate change doesn't exist, tradies have never been busier, people haven't heard of or don't care about #sportsrorts, #watergate etc, all their info comes from Murdoch.  I dispare.
1333949815697227777 2020-12-02 09:43:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @the_howie I can't remember the last time is was caught short looking for sausages.  I would have loved to have been in the marketing meeting that discussed the unmet need for sausages.
1333945550534709248 2020-12-02 09:26:17 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @the_howie WHY?
1333381836957917184 2020-11-30 20:06:17 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> They must be kidding, a documentary is one thing but a dramatisation of a recent civilian massacre is just so off the planet.  We do not need to be "entertained" by an "exploration" of this event.
1332999115572035584 2020-11-29 18:45:29 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @TeePee141 @asphotos If yours has any sort if internal display panel try googling how to activate it's diagnostic mode. It might tell you what has failed.
1332997428375560193 2020-11-29 18:38:47 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @TeePee141 @asphotos Our side by side started not freezing this time last year, something failed in the freezer defrost system and it would choke up with ice.   In the end it was too expensive to fix so we had to by a new one at short notice.  I hope yours keep running.
1332982171007549442 2020-11-29 17:38:09 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @TeePee141 @asphotos Plug something else into the power point and check that it's works. Just to check that the issue isn't in the power supply/power point side.
1332917848830689280 2020-11-29 13:22:34 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> "hears", I hate auto correct!
1332917295178424320 2020-11-29 13:20:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> If any one here's something about this or hears something in the weeks ahead, please take the info straight to the police.
1332907044463017989 2020-11-29 12:39:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Still a bit windy and warm in Sydney. These images from the BOM a few minute ago, first is rain radar, second is doppler radar of the same precipitation. You don't often see wind speeds at the extremes, but to have both extremes in the same weather front.  https://t.co/qi4EYHFbDe
1332818418664235008 2020-11-29 06:47:28 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @slsandpet I went out for a ride this morning and it was actually quite pleasant even at 30 deg.  The winds a bit of a bugger though, still it will keep the air stirred up and hopefully the humidity will stay low until the change comes through.
1332815812575391745 2020-11-29 06:37:06 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JohnRuddick2 @MrKRudd If I must use you list:  Gillard Keating Rudd Turnbull Howard  I'd leave Abbott out as he was just a complete joke.
1332812604956237826 2020-11-29 06:24:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @theheraldsun Good on Peta, she rightly should rip into Greg Hunt and the Federal administrator that failed so badly to either prepare for or deal with the Covid pandemic when it arrived in the aged care homes.  But that's not what she trying to do is it.
1332647636327776259 2020-11-28 19:28:50 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @RochelleGilmore You survived, well done, glad to hear that you are having a "rest" day tomorrow as you'll need it after the heat.  I hope you are going to do a documentary about this ride.
1332644484694253569 2020-11-28 19:16:19 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bridie_OD @peggyoneal17 @DOC_pizza Ah, socialising, we all need retraining after this year.  On the up side you will have eaten out two nights in a row.  I hope all goes well for tomorrow night.
1332489579123732481 2020-11-28 09:00:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Glenina57 @ORIONBLUE5 Re-bore, oversized piston and rings = MORE HORSE POWER!
1332485400598757377 2020-11-28 08:44:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Glenina57 @ORIONBLUE5 I have a similarly old one. It stopped working a few years ago.   Swapped the plug, no good.   Clean filter and purge and renew fuel, no good.  Stripped the carby, there were little pill sized hard deposits in the fuel pump chambers. Still going today.
1332474046345142273 2020-11-28 07:59:03 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @RochelleGilmore @Ford @Pinarello_com @BikesportzImp @santini_aus @Nike @campagnolosrl @OakleyAUS_NZ @vittoriatyres @FordAustralia @nswpolice Hi Rochelle, really sorry that this happened to you and it's understandable that you would be angry about it.  However the words you have chosen here insult an entire race of people. I hope when you get time to reflect on what you have said you will take measures to apologies.
1332411827427307520 2020-11-28 03:51:49 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @bikeshopgirlcom I managed to get some add on beam shapers for my round beam lights, what a revelation. Went from having too much light too far up the road to having a gradual increase in brightness closer to the bike with a much wider spread.  Much kinder a oncoming "traffic" as well.
1332410622156238848 2020-11-28 03:47:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @bikeshopgirlcom Beam aiming: Or how not to blind oncoming riders. Brightness I: Or how many lumens is too many. Brightness II: How it affects on coming humans depth perception. Beam shapers: How they affect beam aiming, brightness and how far away you are. Spot beams: Why they are useless.
1331932691013386242 2020-11-26 20:07:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Chrus_3 I'm not.  That's all.  Good night!
1331929100366147597 2020-11-26 19:53:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @cmallet I hope you and your family are weathering Covid OK, particularly those at home in France.  I hope you can get back to see them soon as it must be tough to be this far away.  Thanks for all your work this year, it really has been a life saver.
1331926196683042817 2020-11-26 19:42:05 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @cmallet Well that's going to work well! skiing a la natural!

1331141997634088960 2020-11-24 15:45:58 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @uktwinds wants to give people 'choice' to not vaccinate and travel with a deadly virus.  Let's spread it widely so that their customers can make a choice to stave their business.  BTW, the vaccinate to travel decision will be made by the Aust Govt, not travel agents.

1330793134138159105 2020-11-23 16:39:42 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @TimWilsonMP @abc730 @leighsales Hi Tim, here's a thought as to why people you like aren't talked to.   It's because they are self centered , selfish, shallow, imbeciles, incapable of rational thought.
1330374218547044354 2020-11-22 12:55:05 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Thoroughly excellent!
1330267838255337473 2020-11-22 05:52:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @RochelleGilmore So I'm probably 100kg with bike and back pack etc, I'm guessing your all up riding weight, bike water etc would be less than 65 kg, so you could probably go pretty low on the pressures while on the dirt. Lower pressures really help with controllability on the loose stuff.
1330266308240412672 2020-11-22 05:46:17 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @RochelleGilmore Well done Rochelle.  For dirt on my MTB, running 50mm tires, I use 20psi front and 25 psi rear, I'm 80 kg. Benefits are it absorbs a lot of the rough stuff, tire spreads out on the sandy soil, doesn't 'dig in' (looks like your riding a half flat tire, which it is)
1329759695679016961 2020-11-20 20:13:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @zakmckrakken I should have added it turns out #NotALeaderJustALiberal
1329759419584843776 2020-11-20 20:12:06 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @zakmckrakken And he had been doing so well, with going hard and early and all.   Now it's all lost, if there is a next time he has ensured that the truth will not be told and it will be just like Victoria........
1329758689893355520 2020-11-20 20:09:12 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @cathywilcox1 Cathy, Congratulations and well done.   So well deserved.
1329752454959828992 2020-11-20 19:44:25 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SCalliss Strangely he thought it would be too tormatic for the sheep to go off with the flock to their fate. Not so much concern for the kids wondering who was for dinner........Such is rural life.
1329723570465869824 2020-11-20 17:49:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Good on you Mike, it's a big issue.  Hope you have a good recovery meal and a few ales to help rehydrate.  Tomorrow will be cooler.
1329722096025419776 2020-11-20 17:43:47 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SCalliss What was its name?  Sorry, that was the question at dinner when ever we had lamb, my father didn't like to send the pets off to the abattoir with the rest of the lambs.
1329720996333375490 2020-11-20 17:39:25 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @abcnews Oh please, we expect so much better from OUR ABC.
1329719898063347712 2020-11-20 17:35:03 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @leighsales I know I'm late to this Leigh, but some people err on the side of caution, you know just in case the worst has happened or maybe just leaving a large margin of error.  Do you brake at 99% as you approach the red light or maybe brake earlier just in case something else goes wrong.
1329704459077783552 2020-11-20 16:33:42 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @zahribeth @Chrus_3 My last long term employer was the same, by the time that I left half my leave was used each year to meet their business requirements.  That's right, MY leave and THEIR business requirements.  This needs to stop.  @AlboMP
1329702988462493696 2020-11-20 16:27:51 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @xskinn Ian, we're all glad that it's comfortable.
1329701771942395905 2020-11-20 16:23:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton Rochelle Gilmore has made to to Cameron Corner, today's ride 91 km in the dirt, the last 23 km on sandy roads, she still managed 25 kmph average!  It was nearly 38 deg C out there today.  Awesome ride.   https://t.co/hu7Y4F2EzW
1329639823020236801 2020-11-20 12:16:51 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @isobelroe I for one am glad they went hard and early.  Faced with data that didn't add up what else could they do. If they waited even a few days they could have the same situation the Vic had.  I live in NSW and I know if it breaks out here it will get away long before the pollies react.
1329343520688148482 2020-11-19 16:39:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @RochelleGilmore Graham (@WeathermanABC) just said it's been REALLY hot out your way, unfortunately same again tomorrow.   Hopefully you can find some coolth somewhere.  Safe riding.
1328948339153494023 2020-11-18 14:29:09 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @vanOnselenP You forgot to add "I can't say this strongly enough.....".
1328573480980320258 2020-11-17 13:39:36 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MadeStuchbery You might like to talk to Tina at @wheelwomenride
1328566097851740161 2020-11-17 13:10:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @billshortenmp Bill, please keep the pressure on.   I know it's hard to get the message out, but Labor needs to keep shouting until at least some of the voters that are sleepwalk through their political life start to take notice.  We are all being made to pay for the LNP incompetence.

1324198938929324033 2020-11-05 11:56:44 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MColvinMcKenzie Nope, that's a correct statement.

I've been hitting them every day riding home from HSC duties.  May they turn into tailwinds for you.  Go safely.

1322116838734528512 2020-10-30 18:03:12 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> And that Ladies and Gentlemen is the atmosphere.   The thing we all throw all our energy pollution into without a care in the world.

1318681661295390721 2020-10-21 06:33:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @slsandpet We were wondering the same. It went on for an hour. My daughter said it wasn't showing up on the flight trackers which is weird. Must have been the army again.

1317781554278457344 2020-10-18 18:56:20 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CallieBuddy Yes, but she would do a rapid left turn, throw you off and then try and roll on you. üèá

1317754050041950210 2020-10-18 17:07:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 Quite possibly, maybe the pre cursor to the dinner.
1317753506795720704 2020-10-18 17:04:53 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 Apparently the image was taken at a luncheon, not the evening fund raiser.
1317752297280004097 2020-10-18 17:00:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Cyclify I'm well past that. My main missing while commuting to work (27km each way) was to hit 50km for one sprint each day on the way home.
1317750635605815296 2020-10-18 16:53:28 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn Yes, but the producer needs to be very circumspect about what they put to air. It's great to hear some of the chat but it could ruin someone career if there's something taken out of context.

1317743698965262336 2020-10-18 16:25:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> What a fcuk up! While the Covid risk is very low, it's about having control and either the Feds don't have control of who enters the country and travels on to other destinations or they intended this to happen.
1317742522366451713 2020-10-18 16:21:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton, who amung us has ridden at 50kmph, on their own on the flat for anything more than a few seconds?
1317741727730388999 2020-10-18 16:18:05 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn Sorry, is 19:00 down here so I'm a few glasses of red into the evening and completely missed the significance of the white screen. I promise to catch up by the end of the evening...
1317741137952583680 2020-10-18 16:15:44 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn I just didn't want to say, but what have i missed.
1317740770791546880 2020-10-18 16:14:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @kath_collins @CyclingCentral So long as we get to see it :)
1317740246197436416 2020-10-18 16:12:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton good evening all, is there anyone out there? Looks a bit cold and maybe damp for #RondeVanVlaanderen. @CyclingCentral  I thought we would be seeing the women's race firsts?
1317423242022322177 2020-10-17 19:12:32 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Still trying really hard to avoid political ranting on this account, sorry I occasionally slip up.   I've tried to move that stuff to @ridetoworkpol, I'm still rebuilding the list of people I follow at the new account hence some of the murmurings still happening here.

1315898761260851202 2020-10-13 14:14:47 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @BrandonTozzo In Australia, maybe 10 or 15 minutes if you go to a busy polling booth.   In most urban areas polling places are so numerous that you can usually walk to the nearest one, for me i have 4 to choose from within 2 km (about 1.25 miles).   This is replicated across the country.
1315648181154144256 2020-10-12 21:39:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ellymelly Err, saving the world from a cataclysmic climate.   Do you think coal fired power stations and coal mining infrastructure just works forever without replacement. Please put in a little more mental effort.
1315534681228550144 2020-10-12 14:08:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @PatsKarvelas @slsandpet @GladysB This  is the beginning of the end.   Why do so few politicians have the moral fibre to do the right thing, they just hang on, suffering more damage to their reputation and the party they represent.
1315533991676583936 2020-10-12 14:05:19 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn Yep, it come down to her judgement.  Judgement about he people she associates with, and continues to associate with after find them to be morally lacking.
1315526329828163585 2020-10-12 13:34:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @WeathermanABC Ok! Glad I put off the bike ride until tomorrow.
1315422604312801280 2020-10-12 06:42:42 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @BevanShields That means the in 3 to 5 weeks there will be an additional 250 deaths, every day. Is that the sort of medium gound you want.
1315405295376494592 2020-10-12 05:33:56 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @drstip @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss Sorry, not sure how I missed this tweet. She's 23.
1315404560249221120 2020-10-12 05:31:00 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @DavidRafferton Wow, that's 18k in the last 8.5 hours.
1315292694831198209 2020-10-11 22:06:30 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JoeHockey He is, to his own face every time he opens his mouth.
1315291772092772352 2020-10-11 22:02:50 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @kirsty_sarcie1 @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss @emilye_cox Thanks.
1315288839196299267 2020-10-11 21:51:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @kirsty_sarcie1 @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss @emilye_cox Thanks. She's a few years into the journey, she'll pick this conversation up in the morning.  Thanks for the offer. She's a bit isolated at the moment, finished Uni 2 years ago, hasn't found a job, Covid just adds to the isolation.
1315287651633643520 2020-10-11 21:46:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @drstip @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss The last time we ate out with her was last year at a Gluten free cafe Dolls Point, she still has days where she feels really off, probably due to something slipping through, or depression at not being able to eat the things she really likes.
1315286891583823874 2020-10-11 21:43:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @drstip @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss Her reaction seems a bit patchy, or maybe it's her desire to eat some old familiar foods.   Mostly she just says "no" if it's not certified gluten free, but sometimes she just tells us to make it and she'll eat some (that is assuming it's not supposed to have gluten in it).
1315285661469925378 2020-10-11 21:38:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @kirsty_sarcie1 @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss Hmmm, that's a difficult question, @emilye_cox what do you say? ( she'll be sound asleep at the moment, none of my family share my delight in late night cycling)
1315284868809453569 2020-10-11 21:35:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @drstip @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss My daughter really likes her spicy foods, but just finding reliable supplies of certified gluten free spices gets hard. She goes through large quantities of spices to compensate for a lack of flavour.
1315283920246599681 2020-10-11 21:31:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @kirsty_sarcie1 @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss My youngest (now 23) lives at home with us, cooks for herself mostly, but struggles with the restriction in what she can eat.  I think she really misses things like savoury breads and just not having to look at everything before eating....
1315283088356720641 2020-10-11 21:28:19 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SCalliss @xskinn She's huge! All that goodness in one package. (same applies to Alba üòâ)
1315281746993139714 2020-10-11 21:22:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss Yep, it's a real thing.  My youngest was finally diagnosed with Celiac disease after years of issues........it's really hard to avoid gluten.   There's plenty of product available, but most tastes like cardboard. She used to love to bake......
1315280538161213446 2020-10-11 21:18:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ButteredFrog @siftinsand @pukupuss Too many frowns from the food police?
1315279953802399750 2020-10-11 21:15:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @siftinsand @ButteredFrog @pukupuss My daughters love Nutella, I just don't get it.   Vegemite however I could put on anything.
1315279057311866880 2020-10-11 21:12:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mwkeenan It's a big IF.  I hope you can enjoy the enforced down time.  Hopefully if your fellow Vic's can just hold the line for a few more weeks you can all start to get out and about a bit more again safely.  BTW, I really enjoy you commentary style, "it's the vibe"......
1315277421159956480 2020-10-11 21:05:48 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ButteredFrog @pukupuss Those two words in the same sentence!  What's the Italian for sacre bleu.
1315276383476572163 2020-10-11 21:01:41 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MrKRudd @mandyrojas23 Gidday Kevin. Took 2 1/2 days, I'm No 59845. Thanks for starting this.  Would you mind doing as post on what the petition achieves, i.e. why is it worth doing.
1315275275521855488 2020-10-11 20:57:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mwkeenan Are you doing the call on SBS for La Vuelta?
1315269671717797888 2020-10-11 20:35:00 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn @mwkeenan Maybe we should set up a Zoom meeting.
1315269452401795075 2020-10-11 20:34:08 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mwkeenan Yep, we're all feelin it.
1315263168424275968 2020-10-11 20:09:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Guyro_Gearloose @ScottMorrisonMP I was No 59845.  I wonder if the Murdoch bots are hammering the site to make it difficult to get through, it took me 2 1/2 days.......
1315261274205290497 2020-10-11 20:01:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @learnpianoaus Labor needs a few more like him, someone with a bit of fire in them.   Willingness to call out the LNP behaviours and the wit to deal with the blowback.
1315260685496930304 2020-10-11 19:59:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @evilscootus This one?   https://t.co/ka5xADZNVm

1315259159974088704 2020-10-11 19:53:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> I finally managed to sign @MrKRudds signature tonight, it only took 2 1/2 days of trying.  If you are at all concerned about the influence of one individual has in all aspects of our lives, please sign the petition
1315257197421494275 2020-10-11 19:45:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @spicynoise I'm with you on that. It's an industry that preys on the weakest.  It serves no useful purpose for society.
1315255300664901632 2020-10-11 19:37:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @tegangeorge @10NewsFirst Nothing, you need to be earning enough to pay tax for it to mean anything.
1314859859007815680 2020-10-10 17:26:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Well here's a thing, I created a new account (@ridetoworkpol) to relieve this account of the political ranting, trying to relive the #couchpeloton of political pollution. So, most of the followers to the new acct are the Cycling nuts, who I was trying to spare in the first place.
1314837521121992705 2020-10-10 15:57:48 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ridetoworkpol
1314837399554281472 2020-10-10 15:57:19 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SenatorRennick Great thank for this.  Wow, we can apply this to the fossil fuel industry.   They will be bankrupt by noon on Monday.   We need to proceed carefully as we need to be able to reach back to take the ill gotten profits in the last 20 years to help pay for the restitution.
1314835935113039874 2020-10-10 15:51:30 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @bagsnotfirst Yes, said I was a robot.  Keep trying. It's open until 04 Nov.
1314829701735620608 2020-10-10 15:26:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton, this doesn't look good for the #LaVuelta20
1314767865241714688 2020-10-10 11:21:00 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @DaveMilbo They are just trying to make a circus out of it. To Dan's credit he continues to play it pretty straight. I hope once the epidemic is done he gets a chance "to go the full Karen" at them and really unload on their behaviour.
1314766120256106496 2020-10-10 11:14:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @bouta_nt And that folks is why I don't have a boat $$$$$$$$.  BTW, are all petrol bowsers in the NT known by name, "Wayne"?????
1314765558240350208 2020-10-10 11:11:50 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @3catlady @AlanBixter @AlexDevantier I had the same and on the second pass it popped up the "I am not a robot" tick box, then it crashed......  When do we start talking about the LNP knobleing the web site so you can't sign the petition.......(I don't seriously believe that, well maybe.......)
1314764842096443393 2020-10-10 11:09:00 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @3catlady @AlexDevantier Same and keeps crashing, I'll try again later tonight, much later.
1314764441737555968 2020-10-10 11:07:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SuperASASSN Just do it, they are and have been for years.   Time for no more Mr Nice Guy!  They take politeness as a weakness (it's not it's actually a strength) and then take advantage of it.  I am so glad to see more and more people simply saying they have had enough!
1314507716375666688 2020-10-09 18:07:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @OurNewHomecoach That sentence has four too many words.......
1314497361826127872 2020-10-09 17:26:07 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @rockinryoko Looks like there are some subscription/pay applications that will do it, but so far I've discovered that you can't even highlight your "following" list and copy it to the clipboard, you only get about 30 entries. Looks like they made had to do.........
1314460766246899712 2020-10-09 15:00:42 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> This so needs to happen!
1314460302138699776 2020-10-09 14:58:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #AusPol I think we have a new term to define the LNP.
1314459813527523328 2020-10-09 14:56:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Twitterati, I have created a second account and plan to move the shouty political stuff over so that this account can get back to its core purpose (see bio). Anyone have any ideas on how to capture my "following" list so I can follow the non sport/astro users on the new account?
1314458125139763202 2020-10-09 14:50:13 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @EmilyRowe69 @evilscootus Yep, they're "building a wall".
1314420275820154880 2020-10-09 12:19:49 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @robbie_buck @Karmageddon67 I still wonder if these people ever think "I wonder if I'm wrong". Do they consider what the consequences might be for them individually?
1314398742322114560 2020-10-09 10:54:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CMMortlock @slsandpet I'm so glad we have the gold standard in NSW.
1314397546781925376 2020-10-09 10:49:30 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SusanCarland @slsandpet The Gig economy, no job surety, poor wages, all employer risk transferred to the employee. This only exist because we have allowed greed to run our government and financial system.
1314393756708208641 2020-10-09 10:34:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Sounds like an excellent idea.  Thanks Advance Australia (seriously, you don't know how good you have it at the moment).
1314168020382613506 2020-10-08 19:37:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @WilmaSlurrie What, he attracts flies as well?
1314164172398030850 2020-10-08 19:22:09 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @GuardianAus What a fine upstanding pillar of society. Why am I not surprised.

1314027503669841921 2020-10-08 10:19:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @OurNewHomecoach @fictillius I have an iPhone 4, still works fine as a phone but most apps "say no" as the iOS is too old, no longer updated by Apple.
1314002421627068417 2020-10-08 08:39:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JamesIMathers James,mths problem is not the couselling, it's the mandating that this service be provided by someone overtly espousing religious beliefs.   There is place for religious doctrine in schools. (Yes I mean all schools). Religion should not be allowed in any publicly funded school.
1313811065789005826 2020-10-07 19:59:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @xskinn Ian, for no particular reason.....  https://t.co/KvXVmRHB7i
1313798184494272513 2020-10-07 19:07:51 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @OurNewHomecoach You've probably had enough now but this guy is a gem.  https://t.co/KvXVmRHB7i
1313783995813953536 2020-10-07 18:11:28 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AntonyGreenABC Invisible, the best way to have the UAP.
1313783654942793728 2020-10-07 18:10:06 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @annabelcrabb At first I though, "Oh Annabel is doing a spot".
1313698016671326209 2020-10-07 12:29:49 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @nyunggai Is that all I have to do to get on the Rorts Train.  Gee I'm a goose for not doing that years ago!
1313688026501922816 2020-10-07 11:50:07 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @leighsales @ScottMorrisonMP Thanks for the warning.   I won't be watching as there'll nothing useful to come if it.
1313660048887881728 2020-10-07 09:58:56 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @manjusrii Which is exactly what they want.  They are playing the long game, in a generation the only people that will be in the political/judicial system will be those that have been brought up to think just like the LNP. They'll expect everyone else to be compliant slaves.
1313658281227816961 2020-10-07 09:51:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @abcnews Oh please, this is not a headline, it's an opinion.
1313639416838025216 2020-10-07 08:36:57 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @catskan @gaudryt It was great to hear the Q and A on what the UCI is doing to further the profile of women's cycling.  Having Dr Bride on the TDF commentary was a huge step forward.   More women in positions of influence improves everything.
1313634342195798016 2020-10-07 08:16:47 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @shaudxoxo Nope, it would be ended that day.
1313374517679382529 2020-10-06 15:04:20 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @wendy_harmer Let's just wait and see how he is by next Tuesday, his breathing was laboured in the vision from the White House today.
1312944919602884608 2020-10-05 10:37:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @LesStonehouse I'll really believe if one of them dies of it.  It could be that his team members have but he doesn't and it was an ideal opportunity to change the agenda, or he could actually have it.  We'll know in about 10 days.
1312932645119041537 2020-10-05 09:48:30 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @nobby15 Unfortunate unless someone in the police or justice system does something about it, then it is just commentary. He'll keep doing what he is doing and even escalate his behaviour as there have been no consequences for his criminal behaviour.
1312888575176785922 2020-10-05 06:53:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @hardenuppete @RonniSalt @David_Speers Well I have stopped watching because if him, I don't think I'm the only one.
1312875862878941185 2020-10-05 06:02:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 @Hepzibah18 @simonahac I think we all know that the answer is in your third sentence.........
1312724647562022912 2020-10-04 20:01:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn @mativity @CyclingCentral Maybe it was in the Tour Tracker??? My memory is a bit hazy of the last week of the Tour. No Sleep and too much red wine........
1312722865259573248 2020-10-04 19:54:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mativity @Bill_FJ_Quinn @CyclingCentral I think I saw something come up while I was using the OnDemand app on my iPad. I couldn't do as the iPad to too old to successfully jump from the OnDemand app to Safari with crashing everything, then I forgot about it.

1312708600725348361 2020-10-04 18:58:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @miketomalaris asking the hard questions of @gaudryt! Great to see, both raising the issue and what has been achieved in raising the profile and availability or Womens Racing.  We just need to move faster, somehow.  Thanks Mike and Tracy. #couchpeloton
1312695027697553408 2020-10-04 18:04:17 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @jonowee I'd forgotten about the MTB World Cup, I don't have enough screens!
1312694251516424194 2020-10-04 18:01:12 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn I think I'd be more worried about getting an SRI (sewing Related Injury). I hope you keep your fingers out of the way.
1312668421746614272 2020-10-04 16:18:34 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Glenina57 That's really shallow off that pier.
1312620703217258496 2020-10-04 13:08:57 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @abcnews It's sad that a global pandemic has forced population isolation.   However this Dad can go home any time he likes, he just has to quarantine.  This sort of reporting is part of the problem with poor adherence to quarantine rules.  All emotion, no rational understanding.
1312618163264053248 2020-10-04 12:58:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MagdaSzubanski I wonder if there's a bunch of #tags they use amongst themselves, I feel a hijacking coming on!
1312596862868754433 2020-10-04 11:34:13 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @NyadolNyuon Journalist, I don't see no Journalist!  Well not at Dan the Man's press conferences anyway. I just see LNP propaganda hacks, and unfortunately they are just receiving that which they dished out.  Disappointing all round actually.

1312249841125187585 2020-10-03 12:35:17 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @abcnews Oh, dead Aunty, how far you have fallen.  Giving airtime and credence to this immature fool should be beneath the national broadcaster.  I'll soon be joining the ranks of the "defund the ABC" group. Why should I be forced to pay for the same trash as the Murdock press.
1312246941292531712 2020-10-03 12:23:45 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @waltshaub The only thing that's news about Fox News is the four letters, N  E  W  S, everything else about and from them is political propaganda.
1312244583573516288 2020-10-03 12:14:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @KiLeRaD Genuine question assuming you're still at the L plate stage, as a driver supervisor are you allowed to use your phone?   I think in NSW, the supervisor is subject to the same restrictions as the L driver. It's been a few years since my 2 became independent drivers. The fine is $$

1312014547557916674 2020-10-02 21:00:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> This is an important thread to read and understand regarding Australian "Natural" gas supplies.

Unfortunately the "jobs" claim is not supported. There are renewable projects that will provide more employment and climate benefit.
1311988546740207616 2020-10-02 19:16:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JaneCaro Jane, at this point, anything is possible. Given his history and the unhinged but clever people he has surrounded himself with, who knows what the truth is.  But what hasn't changed is the dire need to expunge Trump and his administration from any future influence in US politics.
1311986231874527233 2020-10-02 19:07:47 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SuperASASSN You just keep on tweeting.  It's too important for the US and for the rest of us.  Common sense, decency and logic based on science need to be restored.  Most of the right (correct, not political) thinking world is agog at what has happened in the US these last 4 years.
1311984140359618560 2020-10-02 18:59:29 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MettaBhavana1 I'd love to go to the press conference one day with a mobile phone jammer, let them start their questions then just cut off the outside data feed.  It would be very instructive to see what they could come up with.  (the other place to put the jammer would be the PM office....)
1311982122165391360 2020-10-02 18:51:28 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @KirstyWebeck Sounds the same as we were in NSW at the end of the first wave, still cases about but everyone just relaxed.   We got away with it, I hope Vic does too.

1311976155692498944 2020-10-02 18:27:45 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @flutter_rob Hi Robin,  It's a quote, no commentary, inferring support is not that much of a stretch.   The content of the quote is nonsensical to anyone with a basic grasp of science.  If highlighting that was the intention, then it failed.
1311955667612135426 2020-10-02 17:06:20 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SandraEckersley How glorious is that, Trump brings himself down through his arrogance and stupidity, taking Pence with him only to hand the reigns to the DEM's.  Maybe this God thing is true and if this comes off I'll never say a bad word again.
1311954940084977664 2020-10-02 17:03:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @attempt57 Let's do this.  Except Matthew.

1311933540523679744 2020-10-02 15:38:25 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @YoungMasterPaul Nope. I'd rather die than take any part of the individual.

1311919490284703744 2020-10-02 14:42:35 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @kellulz I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  He has done everything he can to downplay the severity of the disease, for two reasons, political gain and financial gain.  He is now going to feel the consequences of those decisions, nature will be blind to his pleas for mercy.  It is what it is.
1311918166944047104 2020-10-02 14:37:19 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> This is excellent news. @JacquiLambie
1311917105135013888 2020-10-02 14:33:06 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Thank you Paul, lets just hope that there are still enough fair minded Americans left to #VoteHimOut and then start the very arduous task of rebuilding a sense of decency in America.  They are in dire need of someone like Jacinda Ardern to pull them together.
1311914925644627968 2020-10-02 14:24:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @TeePee141 @TheTweetOfGod He's onto it.  https://t.co/wvQC0OMGjP

Running around like headless chooks trying to get enough server capacity to deal with all the traffic at the moment.  This event will probably add 0.1 deg C to the planet  #COVID19 #TrumpHasCovid
1311912317274058752 2020-10-02 14:14:05 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @sowdented @OurNewHomecoach My daughter, who follows US politics with a passions says Pence is more radical than Trump, just less unhinged in the way he behaves.
1311910685601746945 2020-10-02 14:07:36 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @wendy_harmer @OurNewHomecoach In which case it's all been "Fake News" to get him off the hook.  If that's the case maybe he could get it "again" in November, just after the election result.
1311910119307833345 2020-10-02 14:05:21 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @BelindaJones68 Nature, impervious to bluster, bullshit, lies, mistruths, misdirections and beliefs.  Doesn't care about wealth, real of imaginary.  Not an once of sentimentality.  Glorious isn't it.
1311908088056745984 2020-10-02 13:57:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @OurNewHomecoach I must admit, my mood lifted as I read his tweet, then immediately started checking that it wasn't one of the spoof accounts.  I'm now having a glass of wine, to commiserate of course, I wouldn't be celebrating such news, no not me!
1311906755811528704 2020-10-02 13:51:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @OurNewHomecoach Now it's too close to the election, it could actually help him, even if he dies in the process.
1311904374097145857 2020-10-02 13:42:31 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CallieBuddy @MackDog2341 Could be, he's seen how much heat he's getting from the debate, so now everything is off. He can't do much more damage from quarantine.  If it's true I hope they can keep him alive, he needs to see the Nov result.
1311902915381006336 2020-10-02 13:36:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Heath_McGregor hmmm, so maybe it is Fake News, he realized how damaging his performance was and this give him an honorable way out (did I just use the word "honourable" about Trump üôÑ)......  No, I just snapped out of it, he NEVER reflects on his errors and shortcoming.
1311901706133753856 2020-10-02 13:31:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @carolduncan Or die, both are bad outcomes for America.   He needs to live long enough to see the election result.
1311900679573708806 2020-10-02 13:27:50 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @johnb78 I thought it was always described as a benevolent dictatorship.  The risk always being that the benevolence could change at any time and the population is powerless to do anything.
1311898750894235652 2020-10-02 13:20:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @sarahvmac He needs to live long enough to see the humiliation of an electoral wipeout.  It would be so unfair to have him to die in office.  The electoral implications will also play into the REP hands.
1311810507167334400 2020-10-02 07:29:31 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JonesHowdareyou On current trends about 2.5 of the will be dead of Covid by the end of November.

1311805371212681216 2020-10-02 07:09:07 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @amylaurenjones Sort of explains the lack of respect given to the #GiroRosa. Clearly there needs to be some wholesale changes of senior personnel in there governing organisation as they just can't see it.
1311804400285802502 2020-10-02 07:05:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @giveitaburl That helmet though....  It must aero, so long as you keep it pointed the right way. Any deviation must surely increase drag considerably.  I wonder if we will ever see the skin suit grow to cover the helmet, .i.e Cathy Freeman style?
1311802808161628160 2020-10-02 06:58:56 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @giveitaburl This is just in.  https://t.co/5AeO219sab

Unfortunately those thinking herd immunity is the answer, by there behaviour are infecting people that no it won't work and don't have a choice in the matter.
1311800122523574273 2020-10-02 06:48:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AdeliaKerekes @DrEricDing @Julie_appleby They do, but only in that they worsen the out come for the person that catches Covid. If they don't catch Covid nothing new happens.  Your contention is pointless.

It seemed to me that the lack of urgency in dealing with climate change was the LNP saw it as an opportunity to make money.
1311644506349989900 2020-10-01 20:29:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ProfPCDoherty Don't give them any indication of when the mic is live, just the moderators instructions.  How glorious would it be to see Drumpf bouncing off the walls, shouting rubbish, but nobody can hear him.
1311643139619258368 2020-10-01 20:24:28 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @simonahac Can't happen soon enough for the sake of the climate, and also the sooner the better so that that the coal loving fossils see their assets and wealth evaporate while they are still alive to "reap the benefit" of their intransigence.

1311610225909141504 2020-10-01 18:13:41 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Heath_McGregor @AlboMP Yes, until the rorts in public life are brought under control, any additional jobs are just an increased revenue stream for the criminals.
1311608205626105858 2020-10-01 18:05:39 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @StevePriceMedia Steve, just a wild guess, but I'm guessing you haven't asked any of the families of the nearly 800 people that have died of COVID if staying at home watch TV is more onerous then having a family member die.
1311603790156500995 2020-10-01 17:48:06 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 That is thoroughly excellent.  Looks like a watercolour from a 18th century botanical masterpiece.

1311590221490786306 2020-10-01 16:54:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @slsandpet From memory SBS is at one end of the frequency spectrum that terrestrial TV uses so it's one of the first to go if you have high signal loss in the antenna system.
1311587756762525697 2020-10-01 16:44:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @slsandpet Give all the antenna connections a wriggle (or disconnect and reconnect) if you haven't already. I find that ours seem to get dry joints after about 6 months or so, even inside the house due to moisture/sea air.
1311585484401897472 2020-10-01 16:35:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @slsandpet I find I need to retune the tele/set top boxes every week or two, even if they don't say that there are "new" channels. Seems that things get changed in the background and stuff just stops working.......
1311584640650473472 2020-10-01 16:32:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @tegangeorge @ScottMorrisonMP @10NewsFirst Hi Teagan, please go and redo High School science as it seems that you may have failed to grasp the very basic concepts on offer.  Until then it would be best for your public image if you kept these sorts of thoughts to yourself to avoid utter embarrassment at your ignorance.
1311578718964310016 2020-10-01 16:08:29 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JanEdwards62 @JonesHowdareyou Well after all he is dealing with children and we all know that you just have to stay calm and keep repeating the message until they get it.  I think he is going to write a wonderful memoir about this part of his life. It is however, not going to be kind to these propagandists.
1311576937379160064 2020-10-01 16:01:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @EliasClure Err, perfectly understandable and perfectly excusable.   There's no way you would get me on that thing.  Don't let the producer talk you into doing that again.
1311566428445655045 2020-10-01 15:19:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @evcricket Fertiliser=explosives for the mining industry is a very large consumer. Methane is a feed stock for the chemical industry as well.

Nothing will be able to be done for they damage to the environment.  I'm almost at the point of let it happen, the faster the better. Then the enablers will still be alive to feel the worst of it.

1311277265775288323 2020-09-30 20:10:37 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ButteredFrog @mwkeenan Well that happened pretty quickly!
1311246200373346305 2020-09-30 18:07:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @zahribeth Not yet!
1311241134648078336 2020-09-30 17:47:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @jonowee Hopefully with the weather that they have they keep the gap well filled with pitch, unlike the ones out here that can swallow a small fury animal.
1311240405216755713 2020-09-30 17:44:08 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @PRGuy17 @FinancialReview So the "for the record" tweet worked. some believed it without question, no amount of correction will change that first impression that some people have, it's how the liar wins.
1311237028831346688 2020-09-30 17:30:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @bikeymikey70 Thanks you, the door is this way........
1311236420070121473 2020-09-30 17:28:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @bweb581 @Dale_E_Hayes @JRehling Cochlear implants have been in use for several decades to aid the deaf/hard of hearing.  Current models support Bluetooth, you know to connect to your phone.  Could be used to feed any audio directly into the users "ears".
1311235221631635456 2020-09-30 17:23:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @pauldutton1968 Cochlear implant? He may be deaf as well as deef.  That however could be very interesting as with that he can literally have someone talking to him with out anyone else knowing.
1311159473398923264 2020-09-30 12:22:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @thetowncrier I suspect that tranquillisers don't work on the drugs the Trump is on.  Biden should have taken Trump on his offer to do a drug test, on stage and invited Trump to give a sample as well!
1311149740399058944 2020-09-30 11:43:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @fitzhunter @APPEALtd This is so sad for Australia and the world. There's no point in complaining about it in Aust as the tiny minority that have control will do nothing but line their pockets.   The only way to curb this behaviour is if the international community applies sanctions that cost dollars.
1311145459402985472 2020-09-30 11:26:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @adamliaw Biden should have turned up with two pathology workers with sample tubes, sat down and rolled his sleeve up and told Trump to do the same.   It would have been glorious to see a trump run away.

1310914469229338624 2020-09-29 20:08:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeleton, just in case any one missed it or forgot that your Wednesday night is already booked.
1310857533737721856 2020-09-29 16:22:45 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Physique_Aust @GabsSydney26 @DanielAndrewsMP Trouble with this the guys in Florida are using a 'belief' based system while Dan IS using a 'science' based system.  There'll be a lot (more) dead people in Florida soon. Victoria, not so much.
1310856611603177475 2020-09-29 16:19:05 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AlexDevantier I don't understand how they think this will all end to their benefit. Eventually the oppressed wake up and 'turn'. Histroically that has been very unpleasant for the oppressors/dominators.
1310856536638455809 2020-09-29 16:18:47 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AlexDevantier Yep, it's part of an ochestrated campaign, and they just don't care about facts or the truth, they just make stuff up to suit their narrative. Just look at Morrison and Trump.
1310853887495086081 2020-09-29 16:08:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AlexDevantier This is pretty glorious, she's been sent there for weeks to try and catch Dan out, failed at that task, then trips over herself.  Now issues a public statement that purports to show what she said while the video of what she actually said is available for all to see.  Not smart.
1310812453551308802 2020-09-29 13:23:37 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @lucysunman @MColvinMcKenzie And we wonder why the planet is warming up.......
1310811936167059456 2020-09-29 13:21:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @rachelbaxendale But that's not a record of what you actually said.
1310811518527631360 2020-09-29 13:19:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AaronDodd Since when  did any Murdoch entity care about the truth. They simply change what they print or say to match their narrative.   There is no honesty in wahat they do.
1310568705907027968 2020-09-28 21:15:03 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @The_NewLiberals Fix the first one and you go a long way to solving the other three. However none of these can be fixed while the LNP and their cronies have any influence over the way forward.

1310418738487779328 2020-09-28 11:19:08 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @georgiecrozier Comments like these do nothing to instil confidence that you have the mental maturity greater than a seven year old.

1310193424453136385 2020-09-27 20:23:49 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome @abagofspanners I'm planning to boil the kettle at 10:25 (AEST), just before the TV coverage kicks in. We should get this synchronized to reduce exposure or increase the effect.
1310190895854051329 2020-09-27 20:13:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @RizviAbul @AmandaPerram I wish the AFP could confiscate the phones of all Fed MP's and their Chiefs of staff.  I wonder what nefarious stuff they would find?

1310166034335240192 2020-09-27 18:34:58 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @NoisyNoraKitty I'm on an iPad in Sydney, still OK. I had the SBS news pop in an hour or so back. Restart OnDemand and it might be OK. @CyclingCentral
1310165464639664129 2020-09-27 18:32:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton I'm really enjoying the state of cycling commentary at the moment. @antmccrossan and @LUCYMARTIN05 are excellent together, same with @mwkeenan and @mcewenrobbie now supercharged by adding @Bridie_OD, such a contrast to the boofy, blockey cricket/football style.
1310163998315167744 2020-09-27 18:26:53 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @abagofspanners I may have missed some as I took a muset break......I hope they're are right about their chances. It is had to hard form a cohesive group/plan when you only get to practice it once!
1310162870932393986 2020-09-27 18:22:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @abagofspanners I was thinking the same, that's the second time they have spent some time discussing the pros and cons. Excellent isn't it.
1310162021288042497 2020-09-27 18:19:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SimonBanksHB @LesStonehouse @AlanTudgeMP So far he's been proven right.   Consequence, there are no consequences.

1310160873281875969 2020-09-27 18:14:28 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @bondigal I hope you got it done before the wind came up!  If you're going to nap I'd do it now, because I think the last 2 or 3 laps are going to be lively.
1310158862687715329 2020-09-27 18:06:29 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @interest_mild The average IQ increases when the bird swipes in for the day.
1310156389315047424 2020-09-27 17:56:39 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SophieSmith86 Sophie, followed you because of cycling, thanks for sharing this opinion so we no who we are really dealing with.  As you are someone with health issues I am surprised that you feel the efforts to protect you from something that could kill you is not something to be proud of.
1310143371642462209 2020-09-27 17:04:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CyclingCentral üëç All good. You guys rock!  I was watching on the ipad then the news stream just cut in.   It's an old iPad so..........
1310142099380076545 2020-09-27 16:59:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CyclingCentral Web OnDemand Ok as well, maybe it was my end??????

1309876044531335168 2020-09-26 23:22:39 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Thanks to all on the @CyclingCentral for another great night of racing.
1309873453248307202 2020-09-26 23:12:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AusCycInsider And she had to go off her line to get the elbow in. Will the commissaries say anything?
1309855577770606593 2020-09-26 22:01:20 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> That is a magic shot! #couchpeloton @CyclingCentral
1309851221545476096 2020-09-26 21:44:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Lgnomesmum It looked like she couldn't put any weight through it.  See my profile pic, I tried the same, it's really hard and the discomfort/pain just distracts you from being able to ride hard (well ride at all...).  She has my sympathies.
1309850101469179905 2020-09-26 21:39:34 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @erfmufn @deicherstar @DrBrianMay @JP_Metsavainio That hurt my eyes but looked really good.
1309848674080493568 2020-09-26 21:33:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @antmccrossan The Aussie audience swapped over to local commentary a while back. Thanks for you and @LUCYMARTIN05 for your call.  It was good to hear your voices again.   Hopefully we'll hear you tomorrow for the early call.
1309841180910186497 2020-09-26 21:04:07 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ajsmith_me I wish they wouldn't do it.  It works against the advertisers interests.  üîáüîáüîáüîáüîáüîáüîáüîá  With the commercial channels it usually leads to me changing the channel, so they loose!
1309830326441504769 2020-09-26 20:20:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> You wouldn't want to run off some of these ridge line corners, it would be a long bumpy ride down the slope . #couchpeloton
1309829356437471234 2020-09-26 20:17:08 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome Your kettle must be broken, there still all rubber side down.
1309828632047546368 2020-09-26 20:14:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome This uninterrupted telecast thing has it's drawbacks  I feel if I leave to get #toursnacks etc, I'll miss something. It will be interesting to see if we get adds on the ondemand feed when the SBSTV broadcast goes live????
1309827150531325952 2020-09-26 20:08:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @GWarrink We're still on Tour de France time........

1309821816811130882 2020-09-26 19:47:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @KineticPearl Gold!  I think you should pose that question to Ant McCrossan
1309820843153739776 2020-09-26 19:43:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Ambiguous_Andy I think you are right, I haven't seen anything saying she on again tomorrow.   If the experience of having @Bridie_OD on the #SBSTDF team is any indicator, hopefully this will soon become the norm

1309811060044492800 2020-09-26 19:04:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @alasnich If the Libs had been in control in Vic, the whole counrty would have gone down......

1309792829309243393 2020-09-26 17:51:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AdemSomyurek Well based on that statement it's a fare bet that if you had played a greater role in the decision process far more would have died.
1309791289915785217 2020-09-26 17:45:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @slsandpet In preference order: International news from SBS (ABC) Online mostly from trusted accounts on Twitter but some from Guardian and other eNews. Less and less from ABC Zero from The Project Zero from 7, 9, 10 I disbelieve anything that comes from Sky.
1309787418669711360 2020-09-26 17:30:29 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @drstip Most likely both, particularly if there's different commentary on each, gets a bit messy but don't want to miss anything.
1309786774424530944 2020-09-26 17:27:56 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @amylaurenjones Yes, it's available in Australia a well on @SBSOnDemand (from 20:35 AEST) and free to air on @SBSVICELAND (from 22:32 AEST).  So get into it! it will be awesome racing. #couchpeloton
1309662901892907008 2020-09-26 09:15:42 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @superathlete9 Another case of contempt of court.  There must be a day of reckoning for these individuals that continually thumb their noses at the rule of law.
1309639739113316354 2020-09-26 07:43:40 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Info_Aus The answer was in yesterdays stock market response.   It worked just as intended.
1309507101580914688 2020-09-25 22:56:37 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn Did you stay online last night, there was a long shot of part of the race track, then the camera ended up in a truck, all sorts of conversations that I didn't understand.
1309505859446165507 2020-09-25 22:51:40 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @leighsales Leigh, while appreciate your concern over the failings in Victoria, but why oh why do you give a free pass to those that actively encouraged the disembarkation of infected passengers at the beginning of this. NSW got lucky, VIC did not.
1309497651058995202 2020-09-25 22:19:03 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @fighturright I saw something today about a 54/10
1309493369895149571 2020-09-25 22:02:03 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ButteredFrog That will take some beating!
1309483892592619525 2020-09-25 21:24:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @DavidRafferton @mwkeenan @Bridie_OD Try thinking of an interesting question and tweet it at him.  You'll probably get an on-air shoutout and reply within 15 minutes. That's not bad.
1309480549241610243 2020-09-25 21:11:06 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @siftinsand Hmmmm....haven't seen any vision of Durbo yet, maybe they don't think there's anyone watching in Australia?????
1309477994725949440 2020-09-25 21:00:57 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @The_Wolf71 Describing it as a deep gash, what an understatement!
1309477271019769862 2020-09-25 20:58:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @siftinsand Looks like the UCI have paid to have a camera on each rider for the men's TT.   Why didn't they do it for the women last night?  All these organisations need more women in positions of influence, only then will we see some meaningful change.
1309474847710306305 2020-09-25 20:48:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @deniseshrivell I hope that's not an Airforce aircraft. If his reason for being there is for a party meeting we shouldn't be paying for it.

1309472875464675329 2020-09-25 20:40:36 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton Not sure how loud our voice is from here in Australia, but Chloe has a point.  We need to let the advertisers and race organisers know that we will support those that are making an effort to bring races to the wider public audience, the others, not so much.
1309470567179849728 2020-09-25 20:31:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @The_Wolf71 @SBSOnDemand @CyclingCentral Ok in Sydney (using an ipad).  I may have spoken too soon, as I typed that the picture broke up and froze for a few seconds........
1309443663924092928 2020-09-25 18:44:32 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @JaneCaro The lack of ethical leadership shown here should shock us, but it doesn't.  The issues is dismissed as irrelevant as it doesn't fit the LNP narative therefore not worthy of comment.
1309435722034638849 2020-09-25 18:12:58 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @r1viera @abcnews Oh God, that's it I'm not tweeting without my glasses ever again.   As Effy would say, "how embarrassment".

1309387709924823040 2020-09-25 15:02:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @abcnews Hmmm, could you please enlighten us all on any other kind of animal that the word stallion refers to, I mean other than a horse.
1309386888373968898 2020-09-25 14:58:56 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @propinqua Show weakness, you know things like compassion, empathy, a sense of social equity.  Also not allowed would be intellect, critical thinking, forward planning and any sign that he wasn't driven by blind belief.
1309364184807690240 2020-09-25 13:28:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @antmccrossan @chloedygert30 That's good news, it looked nasty from what I saw last night (Australia time).   I think it will be a while before she's is back on the bike, but let's hope she good to go for next year.
1309360246423392257 2020-09-25 13:13:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @StephenJonesMP @YaThinkN I wonder if we can get the post codes.  Just wild guess, but I'll bet there all in marginal LNP or strong LNP seats.
1309357965409792002 2020-09-25 13:04:00 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MayneReport @OurNewHomecoach There needs to be forensic analysis of shares sold today!

1309270648078741504 2020-09-25 07:17:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @GuardianAus Well that's going to work out well.
1309157840972640260 2020-09-24 23:48:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @noplaceforsheep Morrison is just indifferent, Dutton enjoys it.

1309120729473069062 2020-09-24 21:21:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @siftinsand @antmccrossan Yep, one of the best for engaging with the audience live. I don't know how he does it as he is talking all the time.
1309119637896998913 2020-09-24 21:16:58 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @siftinsand Well that didn't take long to get an answer.

Access could be an issue but with the internet hopefully there are very few that would not be able to access free to air/iVeiw
1308994004772683777 2020-09-24 12:57:45 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @drstip Particularly when he has used your money to do it.
1308992554105540608 2020-09-24 12:51:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @siftinsand The @CyclingCentral Twitter profile picture has all the broadcast start times and I think one of their tweets had some of the individual Aussie start times as well.

1308934826901331968 2020-09-24 09:02:36 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CosmicRami The system has been turning out people, particularly rich entitled young men in increasing numbers for decades. it's in all aspect of corporate and political life. They do whatever they like, never accept responsibility, always blame someone else.  We are in serious trouble.
1308932404866842628 2020-09-24 08:52:58 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CosmicRami All aspects of this go to show how far we have descended, the fact that these kids have arrived at a state where they think it's  'just fun'. It's down to their parents and school ethos.  Media just shrugging it's shoulders, "harmless" or downplaying wider consequences.
1308930368670638081 2020-09-24 08:44:53 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CoxyJindas I was thinking of writing to him today to get a statement on what he through the about Alan Trudge being declared an criminal.   I'd be heartbroken if he was unable to reply due to a lack of 'health'.  (He's my Fed MP üò≥üòüüòüüòüüòüüòüüòü

"are you of Aboriginal or Torres Strait background" ........  Why, to apply positive recrimination of course. Usually used to do the opposite.    We are no better here!

1308664484030947328 2020-09-23 15:08:21 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Milliganreports So has it been referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation and charges.  If not, why not?

1308626179247599616 2020-09-23 12:36:08 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @vanbadham For our sanity, Morrison should not do it.
1308625781606592512 2020-09-23 12:34:34 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @markdreyfusQCMP I don't understand, if I act unlawfully, wilfully unlawful, I would be charged and tried.   What is different here?
1308609153401716740 2020-09-23 11:28:29 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @TheTeetering Not Telstra, it'll go to Foxtel, first to manager then it will be gifted to them.

1308586729918537728 2020-09-23 09:59:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @GuardianAus Oh, that is good news.
1308586219840786433 2020-09-23 09:57:21 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @GrogsGamut Just imaging if this lot were in charge of building the Sydney Harbour Bridge, they would have built a punt, then another punt, follow by a Bayley Bridge, etc.  This lot simply can't look forward into the future and imaging something better than what they had in the past.
1308584890313502720 2020-09-23 09:52:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @leighsales Isn't there an inquiry underway?   Just a thought how about we wait until it delivers it's finds, then we'll all know what the causes were and hence what we need to to do avoid it happening again without running off half cocked and doing unnecessary/incorrect things.
1308527508350857218 2020-09-23 06:04:03 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Wendy_Bacon @abc730 Not only "outsiders".  I don't understand why we can't get any traction on investigating theses issues and charging the culprits.  Why?
1308357129334452224 2020-09-22 18:47:02 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MartinStoermer @gloves78 @TAFEeducation @FatherBob Hmmm, I don't no how but I will try and find out the timing and funding for the building and loan of the helicopter (nothing fundamentally wrong with that, it would be inspiring to have that at any school).
1308354946983575554 2020-09-22 18:38:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MartinStoermer @gloves78 @TAFEeducation @FatherBob I wonder if any public money as involved in housing it, you know, "we'll look after that expensive public exhibit for you but you'll have to help pay for for the building to put it in, a lovely big auditorium should do it. I think this need to be looked into.
1308330585526468608 2020-09-22 17:01:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @timetravelStu @GrogsGamut Isn't Scotty already there, one of the families best buddies is a raving looney Qanon.
1308324467467141121 2020-09-22 16:37:15 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @roseg Is it a sewery smell?   Checked that the laundry and/or bathroom floor waste "S" bends have water in them.   Also, I don't really know how to say this, but have you seen your neighbours recently. Might be worth knocking on a few doors just to check.
1308322577132089345 2020-09-22 16:29:44 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MartinStoermer @gloves78 @TAFEeducation @FatherBob I thought it was hanging in the Power House Musem, they must have borrowed it.......
1308262328131973122 2020-09-22 12:30:20 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MrKRudd Why, in a legal sense does none of this ever result in an investivation by police? There are so many events that look like corruption, but no investigations ensures.  It shouldn't take a royal commission or ICAC if existing corruption and fraud laws have been broken. Why? Why???
1308240961013600256 2020-09-22 11:05:25 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Neither nature or science place any sway in sentiment or belief.  Science allows us to start to understand nature.
1308193909256777729 2020-09-22 07:58:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MeckeringBoy I'd go with inept corruption.  This lot aren't smart enough to go for clever corruption.
1308032707247484928 2020-09-21 21:17:54 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @amylaurenjones @cyclingtips Thanks for your reports and video, it was great to see a bit of the race. That article is great, I hope the #GiroRosa organisers read it. Now go and enjoy a few bike rides of your own.  Thanks again.
1308032022133133314 2020-09-21 21:15:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @cyclingtips @amylaurenjones I hope the #GiroRosa organisers read this as it succinctly summaries the issues with the race this year. It could be the preeminent WWT race into the future, but only if they lift their game significantly. There's a huge market for quality coverage, this wasn't. #CouchPeloton
1307722759825313793 2020-09-21 00:46:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @cmallet @CyclingCentral Still here!
1307709355576324096 2020-09-20 23:53:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton, we'll be seeing this view soon.
1307701454849761280 2020-09-20 23:21:37 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @poikilothermia @LeTour Hi Cam, maybe time for some self reflection here.   You might just find that you are part of the problem, not the solution.
1307687886943170561 2020-09-20 22:27:42 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> I was worried about how #PlatduTour would go after so many years of Gabs doing #TasteLeTour. I'm glad to say it has been great and I'm looking forward to Guillaume being on site for 2021. #couchpeloton #sbstdf
1307619177553776642 2020-09-20 17:54:40 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CaldwellAnthony Nope. The #LNP is FAR more dangerous than first thought.
1307612875872112640 2020-09-20 17:29:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MarkCavendish @LeTour The second Paul was meant to be Phil......
1307589766179741698 2020-09-20 15:57:48 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MarkCavendish @LeTour Mark, thanks for sharing this memory.   So many good things, an awesome acceleration to win, Paul Sherwin calling with Paul.........
1307588525450174464 2020-09-20 15:52:52 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AlboMP Anthony, you and Labor need to be bold and clear on a low carbon future. If you perambulate we will abandon ship to the Greens and Independents as there no point on voting for small "L" liberal policies in Labor.
1307586651787423750 2020-09-20 15:45:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Well said Brodie.   #couchpeloton  I have seen this sentiment reflected widely about the coverage of the #GiroRosa2020.   Huge opportunity missed by not backing it and making coverage available.  They need to take it seriously or other races will "eat their lunch".
1307574026500366341 2020-09-20 14:55:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MartinA65684372 @simonahac @ScottMorrisonMP @CEFCAus @ARENA_aus @David_Speers "Gas" is not green.   The LNP want to classify it as green so they can divert funding from true green and renewable spending.   They are hell bent on making their fossil fuel mates temporarily the richest people on a fried planet.
1307547695570059265 2020-09-20 13:10:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @davemacka @CyclingCentral @miketomalaris @rogla @TamauPogi @richie_porte Missed it live (I was out on a ride), I'll have to watch it after the #GiroRosa update.  Thanks to you, @cmallet and guests (and those in the background) it has been really informative and fun to watch the daily debriefs.  Rest day on Monday?

1307480170769469440 2020-09-20 08:42:19 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @maglianera86 Thanks for ge race update Andrew. Your sentiment are echoed around the world. The #girorosa could easily be the women's equivalent of the TDF, it already exists and has history. It just needs appropriate respect and support. The racing is second to none. #couchpeloton
1307332466932289539 2020-09-19 22:55:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @percivalsmum I suspect you're not alone......  There'll be a few nature breaks and kettle boilings done in the next 15 min before Richie rolls #couchpeloton
1307331304086671360 2020-09-19 22:50:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @prestonterrace Did you do the mouli and sieve thing? I don't have either and I was thinking of doing the Chicken with cream and mash tomorrow night.
1307274166102450176 2020-09-19 19:03:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AnnaMeares Bruce is seriously not impressed!
1307259834652188675 2020-09-19 18:06:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Valentine702 We had something similar on a shared path near my place. Whoever it was would go to the trouble of picking up their dogs poo where ever it was deposited then always drop it off on the same 50 part of the path, always the same bag. I kept my eyes open but never caught them at it.
1307258426691518464 2020-09-19 18:01:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @NickPonticello Yes. If I were you I'd start looking to fill out immigration applications just in case he goes for another term, not sure where you should go as nowhere will be safe from the kaos if he gets re-elected.
1307256433465942017 2020-09-19 17:53:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton, the great man himself.
1307115607180152833 2020-09-19 08:33:40 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @grottyscotty I think he's worse than missing in action, his actions actually hold us back on so many fronts, it's deliberate planned inaction or even sabotage. Just look at the gas decision.
1306962974632849409 2020-09-18 22:27:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> It would only be fare, Gold Standard and all!

1306946809357414401 2020-09-18 21:22:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @miketomalaris Mike, I'm sure it already happens, but please pass our thanks onto each and every one of these legends that work their magic to bring us the coverage. I have never seen an audience that is as "connected" to those involved in bringing it to us. Thankyou. #couchpeloton
1306940127378169856 2020-09-18 20:56:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @thejimmalo @JonathonMomsen If people followed the lawful restrictions in relation to the health emergency there would be no need to increase the police power to enforce. The health orders are there to reduce the impact of the virus, try helping instead of obstructing.

1306931949726871552 2020-09-18 20:23:53 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @spicynoise @NoisyNoraKitty I suppose what I was trying to say was look out for anything that is unusual after you recover and talk to your doctor ASAP. I hope you get over it soon.
1306931479599955969 2020-09-18 20:22:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @prawnsarnieTam Might do one with honey as well.  Probably wake the family with the smell........
1306931101428903936 2020-09-18 20:20:30 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @spicynoise @NoisyNoraKitty In my case polymyalgia rheumatica was as close as they could come to giving it a name. 6 years and still getting flare ups.
1306930524938665990 2020-09-18 20:18:13 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SkimumKate Equal? I must have missed that bit in the recipe.  Isn't it one "small" cup for the pot and the rest for the cook?
1306929775248683013 2020-09-18 20:15:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @spicynoise @NoisyNoraKitty Keep an eye out for muscle/tendon pain (anywhere in your body), worse than the shingles. There are drugs available that work within 24 hours , but you might be stuck on them for years.......
1306927539345006598 2020-09-18 20:06:21 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @spicynoise @NoisyNoraKitty Really painful, I had them in the head and neck, did I say really painful......I hope the drugs work quickly. Keep an eye out for other "issue" a few months after it subsides, I developed other conditions that have stuck around for years......
1306926521647427584 2020-09-18 20:02:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Bill_FJ_Quinn Looks like my place 3 screens, 3 different feeds. It's hard trying to listen to the all at once. #mensproblems
1306925983912534017 2020-09-18 20:00:10 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @prawnsarnieTam Ok, you win #toursnaks and #fromagefriday. I'm off to the kitchesn to raid the fridge to see if I can come close to this (no hope! The best I can expect is Toast and vegemite with grill cheese)
1306924510432509952 2020-09-18 19:54:19 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @CoxyJindas Should have offered to give them a player or 2 at half time .........

1306896156404850695 2020-09-18 18:01:39 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @cinquecento62 No company employee is worth that amount of money. CEO and executive salaries are out of control. Driven by greed which breeds unconscionable behaviours, see Banking Royal commission for one. It goes all the way to middle level Mgrs, individual contracts, non disclosure etc
1306894306532360193 2020-09-18 17:54:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @ElysseMorgan @abcnews @AlanKohler Well that went well. I mean it really went well. @Alankohler you can now safely retire knowing that the informative, lighthearted finance report will carry on.
1306892041033449474 2020-09-18 17:45:18 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @the_howie I've never done that. I'll be glad to hear how it goes. I think I'd like to do it daylight hours so that I could get a different view of the countryside.
1306874716846780416 2020-09-18 16:36:27 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @MrAndrew @Strava There is a privacy function to create an exclusion zone around the point that you start an activity, but it's useless as well. It's based on an exclusion circle, if you always start your activities as you leave home it only take 3 or 4,activities until you can pinpoint your home.
1306866405464109059 2020-09-18 16:03:26 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @evilscootus More women are needed in the grass roots and professional organisations to force cultural change, thankfully there is an abundance of talent available, they just need to be given a go.
1306864070310522880 2020-09-18 15:54:09 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @evilscootus I thought the same, after each team the camera pans across to the woman in white. I guess it's to "get the sponsors logo" on the tele. I think that the way this GiroRosa has been run is a case study in disrespect all round.

1306565359474888709 2020-09-17 20:07:11 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Hoobiemanchu I've got a monitor with SBS TV on it, iPad for the tracker and the PC for twitter. Having the TV vision about 10 sec ahead of the tracker is good as you can always catch something you miss. Just need to switch audio over to TV at the end of the adds.

1306447236339965952 2020-09-17 12:17:48 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mattjcan This is a failure of your LNP mates in NSW you turnip!  It's failure to implement a govt policy, it has nothing to do with green technologies.  Strike another one up for LNP incompetence. What a surprise.
1306445460735836160 2020-09-17 12:10:45 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mattjcan Matt, you need to start thinking with your brain not your wallet.  The path you would have us take will kill off your grandchildren and make our old age and the life of our children unpleasant.  WAKE UP, the climate doesn't care how much money you have.
1306441234798399489 2020-09-17 11:53:57 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> So am I, @AlboMP I will not vote Labor if you support new fossil fuel use.

1306144563598364673 2020-09-16 16:15:05 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @SkyNewsAust @fitzhunter This guy needs to be cut free, as he is clearly part of the problem not the solution.
1306144044225978368 2020-09-16 16:13:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @spicynoise Sad but necessary, at 23 he needs to be relieved of the stress of continuing when he clearly isn't fit/in form for this most arduous of challenges.

Catch-22? Or he could just be another self centered political psychopath.
1306127024583393280 2020-09-16 15:05:23 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mad6duck Mate, you are so lucky to have such a good Club President. Look after yourself. The simple things are the good things.

1306001847610556416 2020-09-16 06:47:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @wheelwomenride They were talking about women/community cycling and getting people confident enough to go out for a ride. It was at about the 43 to 40 km to go mark. I hope you get a good ride in today.

1305865834942869505 2020-09-15 21:47:31 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @miketomalaris @LeTour No other broadcaster would provide the different packages at different times of the day to catch up.   I know that we are all heading to digital online, but there's something about being able to put the tele on and just watch it.
1305865020841119745 2020-09-15 21:44:17 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @miketomalaris @LeTour I'm so glad that they have placed value in the style of production/coverage that SBS bring.   That is a standout difference to all other broadcasters in Aust.   If they had gone to the commercials, the audience would rapidly shrink as they would try to "hype" it and would kill it

1305805413724553216 2020-09-15 17:47:25 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome I'll have to catch up (sorry, haven't seen them all yet) I've got 10 min until TDF2020 kicks off on the tracker......
1305794386316255233 2020-09-15 17:03:36 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome Yep, the last 700 meters of the last 2 stages have been epic.  Any thoughts of dropping a GiroRosa reference into the #RookieRacingRecap ?
1305775041561284610 2020-09-15 15:46:44 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome @MitcheltonSCOTT @AvVleuten I don't understand why it's taking so long to get WWT races on the tele. They're a different beast to mens races, usually shorter, more tactical, punchy, really good viewing, I just don't get it?????? AND the worlds best athlete winning almost everything at the moment.
1305772482436030464 2020-09-15 15:36:34 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Just imagine if we had someone of the strength of character leading the country, how different a place it would be. Instead we have a leadership void, a backward looking narrow minded self absorbed buffoon. It's really depressing, such opportunity lost at huge cost to our future.
1305767891849998337 2020-09-15 15:18:20 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @miketomalaris Nah, you'll be on one of these ripping it up around the suburbs (maybe later than 2030 though, I think you have a few more good years in you).  https://t.co/vAhmHmIIvh
1305766355547770882 2020-09-15 15:12:13 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @miketomalaris @LeTour @SBS Congratulations to all in @SBS that made this happen.   SBS's commitment to cycling has changed the cycling landscape in Aust and this is not lost on the cycling community.

1305649469669556224 2020-09-15 07:27:46 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome @MitcheltonSCOTT @AvVleuten Maybe the big teams need to pull out of future Giros unless the promoter makes an effort to make it available to the viewing public.   There's a huge demand for women's cycling, just too many promoters and broadcasters dragging their feet.
1305647320071983109 2020-09-15 07:19:13 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Listen to what trump says here, he is insane.  To him, the coming of winter, because that's what he means by "it will get cooler soon" means that the climate isn't collapsing. He and his like will ruin this earth for all, yes I'm looking at the LNR.....
1305500026123071489 2020-09-14 21:33:55 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> #couchpeloton, If your still awake tonight you should go outside and take a look at Jupiter (and Saturn which is close by). You'll need a bit of kit to see it like this, but you'll see Jupiter's moons with a good pair of binoculars.

1305294003458510853 2020-09-14 07:55:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @blkahn @D_Melissa2 Yes, it's almost like they are following a pre prepared script. What I can't figure out, given the short, medium and long term consequences that surely they are aware of, what is the advantage.  They will go down with everyone and everything just like the rest of us.

Thank you to you and all the SBS team, the TDF production/coverage is by far the best in the world and no other organisation could do as well.

1304765908187897856 2020-09-12 20:56:48 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mativity Yes, Jupiter just to the west of directly overhead (brightest thing up there) with Saturn about 3.5 fingers of an outstretched hand to the east (dimmer and looks a bit redder). Put my telescope out to cool to ambient earlier, hoping to see a few of Saturn's moons.
1304764217786998786 2020-09-12 20:50:05 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome 138 starters, seemed like more as they passed by.
1304763108984983553 2020-09-12 20:45:41 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @reallyspoketome That's a HUGH peloton, I'm going to have to go and look up the rider list.
1304759936409190402 2020-09-12 20:33:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mativity @janninereads Don't forget those sitting on it #couchpeloton
1304752874044272646 2020-09-12 20:05:00 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 That is an excellent state of affairs. May it last forever.
1304752132407451652 2020-09-12 20:02:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 Then he's a lucky man and I hope he knows it. üòç
1304751176911433728 2020-09-12 19:58:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @D_Melissa2 He's hacked your twitter hasn't he.
1304725241629868033 2020-09-12 18:15:12 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @KiLeRaD I've just put the telescope out (cooling down for later...), Jupiter is almost directly over head right now, Saturn is about 4 fingers on an outstretched hand to the east. If you have binoculars you could do worse than take a look. You'll just see Saturn's rings with 7 x 50's.
1304676638152515584 2020-09-12 15:02:04 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @Terrytoo69 @JonesHowdareyou And your last 2 words give the reason they are banging on about it. Fomenting unrest, unease and kaos at every opportunity.
1304660695397535745 2020-09-12 13:58:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @nobby15 So he is inciting a class of people to break the law.  Surely there's something on the statues that makes that an offence.
1304558051278553088 2020-09-12 07:10:51 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @BreakfastNews I'm sorry, but why do you think this is "news" worthy of national broadcast?
1304421366511271936 2020-09-11 22:07:43 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> I can not comprehend descending sitting on the top tube like that on these roads. üò¨üò¨üò¨#couchpeloton

1304407665762807809 2020-09-11 21:13:16 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @shazp4 I was thinking of doing the same and maybe grilling some cheese over the top. It will wake the family with the smell of toast.

1304395423663058944 2020-09-11 20:24:38 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AB_Mycroft Good thinking!  I've been keeping the late night chocolate in my tool cupboard in the garage, so far it's been safe.
1304386099830120449 2020-09-11 19:47:35 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @OurNewHomecoach Jane Caro has good reach, and good judgement, a quick look at your profile and tweet history and it's a no brainer. Hope you make it too 2k soon!

1304377789135503362 2020-09-11 19:14:33 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Slim pickings for #FromageFriday #couchpeloton. The kids found the cheeze this afternoon..........  https://t.co/u1C41zrspq

1303306745381400576 2020-09-08 20:18:37 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @LaTrioli How powerful would it be if the PM (I won't call him a leader because he simply isn't) was to make statements like this, encouraging people stick to the plan rather than white anting everything that the Vic Govt does.
1303287460244250629 2020-09-08 19:01:59 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @jeff_kennett Jeff, a statesman, having identified a problem would offer constructive advice on how to address the issue, you have stepped down to sling mud.  You are a disgrace .
1303096696839102465 2020-09-08 06:23:57 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @annabelcrabb There's 2 children locked up on Christmas Is, asylum seekers in detention for 7 year. "This" is Australia.

1302550536026116096 2020-09-06 18:13:42 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> There's a sameness about all the tweets from RWNJ's, almost like they come from the same cheat sheet......

I'd love to chat more but I'm off to the patent office.  BTW do you really think that science and medicine missed it
1302259799845867520 2020-09-05 22:58:25 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Pinot's breathing looks forced, like he's struggling to get a lung full.  Covid????????????????? #couchpeloton

1302113582826487808 2020-09-05 13:17:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AneekaSimonis @theheraldsun If you were wondering why Covid took off in Melbourne and the numbers have been slow to come down, here's your answer. Their stupidity driven by selfishness will only lengthen the restrictions.
1302111301208961029 2020-09-05 13:08:20 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mjrowland68 Gee, there's a surprise. just one more reason of many not to watch that rubbish.
1301851089222819840 2020-09-04 19:54:21 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @musettedutour They talked about Richie in the 13:00 podcast but no mention was made so I'm guessing still to be hatched.
1301485652039446528 2020-09-03 19:42:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mativity @drstip Yep, it kicked off a couple of nights ago, however last night was soooooooo slooooooow that even Mike T put an entry in for #bridiebingo

1301479263028129792 2020-09-03 19:16:51 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @mativity @drstip It's the point where Bride leaves the commentary to do highlights spot with Mike T on the main channel while Keeno and Robbie take it through to the finish.

1301135092706758656 2020-09-02 20:29:14 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> Good evening all, a bit late due to dinner with friends, looks pretty calm at the moment. No break away? #couchpeloton

Hazards need to be designed out of any system.

BTW, thanks for all your rational work on Covid communications, it's like bats piss, a shaft of gold when all around is dark

Kenny and Sky have been doing everything they can to jeopardize the safety of everyone, particularly the elderly
1300739518228697088 2020-09-01 18:17:22 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @noplaceforsheep It's a statement of what he want, without a plan of how to get there. It's also a "threat" to the non LNP states to open up because he says so without any evidence to show that it is safe. Part of me want them to comply, but he will just blame them when COVID explodes.
1300727097921421313 2020-09-01 17:28:01 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @xskinn @bogert_brenda Looks like it kicks off on @SBS Ch30 at 09:30 for a bit of preamble. It's a great way to spend an evening (well evening, night and early morning...........)
1300726439587635201 2020-09-01 17:25:24 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @AndrewBGreene Unfortunately Craig is an idiot, looks like his party room colleagues maybe not as much.

1300724746904952832 2020-09-01 17:18:40 +0800 <ridetoworksyd> @xskinn @bogert_brenda It's on again tonight Ian, from about 10:30. We'd love to see you on the #couchpeloton for a bit of a chat and a few laughs as well as the magnificent scenery from France.
