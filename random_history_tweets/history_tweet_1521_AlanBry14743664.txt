With Russian Mercenaries now taking to the air this ship could ferry Gunships into operational areas for that use, It was a decisive advantage for Executive Outcomes in Africa.

Given their“covert operations” around the world with (I.E. Wagner) this vessel will be a force multiplier for those operations too.
