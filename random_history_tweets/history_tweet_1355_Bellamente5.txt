Why does the CDC claim approx 6% of deaths are FROM Covid, 18,000, that’s not even close to a pandemic is it? We need answers.

Food lines due to the shutdown due to the pandemic due to China. It’s a manufactured crisis. The Hong Kong flu back in 1969 killed over 4 million people. No shutdown, no masks.

1335955143850913792 2020-12-07 22:31:41 +0800 <Bellamente5> @FoxNewsSunday Biden is NOT the president elect. . That doesn’t happen until the electoral college meets. You continuously prove that you’re FAKE news. Can’t wait to see Fox News thrown into the dust bowl of history.
1335953520311341059 2020-12-07 22:25:14 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Ilhan Not going to happen. It’s easy to see you are a minion of Klauss Schwab and his Great Reset. You forgot to mention “You will OWN nothing and be happy”. We are wise to this attempt to turn the world into one big concentration camp. Pay attention:we the people won’t allow it.
1335949465136590849 2020-12-07 22:09:07 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Annakhait Being a teachers union you would think they had a more extensive vocabulary. Those three words(excuses) only add up to laziness.
1335776972962729992 2020-12-07 10:43:42 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Hoosiers1986 This is all part of the grand design called the Great Reset. “you will OWN nothing and be happy”as per Klaus Schwab. First destroy the economy and then build back better (sound familiar)in a socialist utopia.  It’s all out there in black and white, they’re not hiding it. Look.
1335682766739005440 2020-12-07 04:29:22 +0800 <Bellamente5> @GOPLeader Their pay should be commensurate with the days they actually work. Looks like their pay should be cut by about two thirds, which is approximately $58,333. Which is actually way too much to begin with for 100 days. Politicians salaries are excessive.

1329981530853281797 2020-11-21 10:54:41 +0800 <Bellamente5> @GeoRebekah @KathiAngelone Then You must also believe the CDC when they came out with their announcement that only 6% of the 200,000 people who died was from Covid, the rest was from other health issues first.
1329980564162699265 2020-11-21 10:50:50 +0800 <Bellamente5> @GeoRebekah That explains all the rioting going on in Europe. Let’s get real.

1329799482729521166 2020-11-20 22:51:17 +0800 <Bellamente5> @BernieSanders President Trump may be a lot of things but not any that you mention. His accomplishments in 31/2 years are amazing. Stop acting like the miserable old man that you are because you will never be President. You have accomplished nothing in your life and you know it.

1329596238711414786 2020-11-20 09:23:40 +0800 <Bellamente5> @SchmittNYC The media is obviously afraid of what they might find out. They are spineless marionettes and don’t deserve any recognition whatsoever.
1329592602816090114 2020-11-20 09:09:13 +0800 <Bellamente5> @DanaPerino just thought you should know how irritatingly obnoxious you are. That’s why no one watches Fox anymore.

1329429537940271105 2020-11-19 22:21:16 +0800 <Bellamente5> @seanhannity How does the covid test differentiate from Covid, the flu and the common cold since they’re all viruses? Anyone?  Why did the CDC report state that only 6% of the total covid deaths reported were actually from Covid.

Also get the “elite” colleges and universities to dip into their endowment funds(billions) and pay off college debt for their students who have loans.

I guess when the oceans rise, it will somehow go around his homes. Climate change my ass.

1319995283854532610 2020-10-24 21:32:54 +0800 <Bellamente5> @AOC The GND is a sham to usher in globalism, the CO2 in our atmosphere is 4% so, no, the world is not going to end.

1318548283405586433 2020-10-20 21:43:02 +0800 <Bellamente5> @LindseyGrahamSC I see you caved to your fellow RINO members and cancelled the subpoena of CEO Dorsey. This is against the will of the people who you work for, something you all have forgotten. Do you not realize your re-election is at stake?

The fascist card is as worn out as the race card. It’s time to give our institutions of indoctrination a giant enema.

1317937470353346563 2020-10-19 05:15:53 +0800 <Bellamente5> @GovWhitmer @johnerican Where in that clip is he inciting violence? Your constituents chanted lock her up. Maybe you should look to yourself instead of blaming others. You’re a fraud.
1317930154044411906 2020-10-19 04:46:49 +0800 <Bellamente5> @SpeakerPelosi the Senate has been instructed by We the People to NOT allow you to spend over 1Trillion$ of our money to the IMF to give to foreign countries, including Iran,Russia and China. You thought we wouldn’t find out?
1317913991528747015 2020-10-19 03:42:35 +0800 <Bellamente5> @jsolomonReports As the saying goes, “You f*ck up, you move up”
1317913780056195074 2020-10-19 03:41:45 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Bubblebathgirl He can take his vaccine and shove it up his globalist ass
1317894419773857794 2020-10-19 02:24:49 +0800 <Bellamente5> @johntieso This fool does nothing but lie with a straight face, I guess 47 years of practice makes perfect. He actually makes me sick.

1317893123805241344 2020-10-19 02:19:40 +0800 <Bellamente5> Buffoon Biden is at it again, lying and yelling to beat the band. What the hell is wrong with him? Could be a little nervous about a certain laptop?
1317869957196271618 2020-10-19 00:47:37 +0800 <Bellamente5> @chipfranklin Why would anyone vote for Biden? 47 years and nothing to show for it.
1317866750290071554 2020-10-19 00:34:52 +0800 <Bellamente5> @markknoller Take your masks and social distancing and F off.
1317866032866992135 2020-10-19 00:32:01 +0800 <Bellamente5> @DanRather I want to live in a FREE country, not a country with a puppet President run by the Marxist squad.

1317824419985764353 2020-10-18 21:46:40 +0800 <Bellamente5> @realDonaldTrump The Democrat party is dead. Welcome to The New Marxist Party.
1317822129019170817 2020-10-18 21:37:34 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Diddy The only race war is in the minds of the mentally disordered liberal democrats.
1317819503372324865 2020-10-18 21:27:08 +0800 <Bellamente5> @BreitbartNews The most corrupt president in US history helping the most corrupt Vice President in US history. Birds of a feather will fall together.

1317794109642461184 2020-10-18 19:46:13 +0800 <Bellamente5> @brhodes Perhaps you should revisit the meaning of the word “fascist”. Your globalism is showing.

1317636630845530112 2020-10-18 09:20:27 +0800 <Bellamente5> @svdate There is a video of Biden saying that. What planet are you on? Wake up
1317625052700037121 2020-10-18 08:34:27 +0800 <Bellamente5> @MrWick2u Why would any parent vote for someone who would have their children grow up in a Biden/Harris Marxist run country. Shameful.
1317624220386512896 2020-10-18 08:31:09 +0800 <Bellamente5> @LtGenScott @Bubblebathgirl @edwrather Gen Flynn is the fix as FBI Director.

1317613077945327618 2020-10-18 07:46:52 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JoeBiden You couldn’t build a sand castle in the desert. You’re nothing but a globalist puppet who got paid off to sell out this country. 47 years and you’ve accomplished nothing but a big fat bank account. You’re a pathological liar and a fraud.
1317611228701859842 2020-10-18 07:39:31 +0800 <Bellamente5> @ChrisMurphyCT If the FBI had the laptop since last year, how did Russia leak the emails. Did Russia get them from the FBI or is Russia inside the FBI or are we gonna go with a bs hack story again, or maybe Adam Schiff needs another scam to pull since he’ll hopefully be out of a job in 17 days.

1317565072454148096 2020-10-18 04:36:07 +0800 <Bellamente5> @realDonaldTrump I’ve noticed several musicians complaining that you play their songs at your rallies. Drop them and go with “My Way” by Frank Sinatra.
1317562263276982272 2020-10-18 04:24:57 +0800 <Bellamente5> @simonelandon How about using birth control? Gee, what a concept. It’s probably a shorter distance to the drugstore.

1317535752956399616 2020-10-18 02:39:36 +0800 <Bellamente5> @icecube Biden/Harris will do nothing for blacks, it doesn’t fit their narrative. They’re globalists and people need to wake up to that fact. Globalists don’t give a dam about people, only themselves and power and money. The only one who can’t be bought, Trump. Wake up people.
1317531660250980353 2020-10-18 02:23:21 +0800 <Bellamente5> @heathmartinVO @icecube The proud boys are not white supremacists, their leader is black/Hispanic. Don’t fall for the lies, do some research.

1317504083641716739 2020-10-18 00:33:46 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JohnStossel Voting for the man who will keep us free from socialism/Marxism, gave us the greatest economy ever, made peace in ME, lowered taxes, stopped countries from bleeding us dry$, etc. I’m doing this for my children and grandchildren so they actually can have a future in a free USA.
1317448804271067136 2020-10-17 20:54:06 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Terrenc43516485 @chbstone2 Just goes to show you that no amount of money can cure ignorance. He shouldn’t be promoting a race war. The overwhelming majority of Americans are not racist, but don’t push it into something you really don’t want to see.

1317438820531437570 2020-10-17 20:14:26 +0800 <Bellamente5> @HillaryClinton We would rather have “reality” than the behind the scenes shady deals of selling out our country that the democrats are notorious for doing.  Trump may be brash and unfiltered but you and the dems are as phony as a 3$ bill. Dem Party is dead, the new Marxist Party. Wake up all!

1316548810303254530 2020-10-15 09:17:51 +0800 <Bellamente5> @kylegriffin1 A reminder: the President was impeached for lies fabricated by the pathological Pelosi and Schiff, for getting too close to the truth. It sounds like your afraid to actually inevstigate this new info.
1316547273803927552 2020-10-15 09:11:44 +0800 <Bellamente5> @HillaryClinton That’s rich coming from an Alinsky follower who absolutely hates the constitution and this country and will do anything to destroy both for $$$$$$ and power

Pelosi won’t budge because she wants to bail out the poorly run blue states, not gonna happen. We know what’s going on. Go comb a salad.
1316134720963514372 2020-10-14 05:52:24 +0800 <Bellamente5> Whitehouse had to be the biggest balloon knot on the senate stage today with Blumenthal and Hirono as runner ups.

1316126117502349313 2020-10-14 05:18:13 +0800 <Bellamente5> @SenSchumer Don’t you get tired of being an idiot?  You democrats are so full of crap, if the shoe was on the other foot you would move heaven and earth to fill the seat, if you say you wouldn’t you’re just lying as usual.
1316124728252411906 2020-10-14 05:12:42 +0800 <Bellamente5> If I had a dollar for every lie the democrats told today, I’d be filthy rich. By the end of this inquisition, I should be in the 1%.

You don’t know what the hell you’re talking about and neither does Whitehouse or any of the other politicians since they exempted themselves from the A C A. You all need to shut up and sit down.

1316093015761596417 2020-10-14 03:06:41 +0800 <Bellamente5> @united__UK @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, President Trump was new to the swamp and did not know the true face of these people and depended totally on the people around him, which turned out to be a total disaster on more than one occasion. I think he should fire all of those who recommended the traitors

1315690749548269568 2020-10-13 00:28:13 +0800 <Bellamente5> Since all the Dem Senators today are so protective of the ACA and how wonderful it is(not), why isn’t it their health care. Why did they exempt themselves?

1315250339776471040 2020-10-11 19:18:11 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JoeBiden The Build Back Better slogan comes from the United Nations and the New World Order agenda for the globalists to take over not only Europe but the USA and you are handing us over to them. You’re a bum and a Marxist and we will not let you do it.

In 1993 that % went up to 85 with every democrat for it, Biden included, with no republicans voting for it. Seniors need to pay attention.

1311370741401649152 2020-10-01 02:22:03 +0800 <Bellamente5> @IlhanMN Yes, WTF America, how could you vote this POS into office?
1311369545228128256 2020-10-01 02:17:18 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JoeBiden The only booming economy from you and the Obamanation was useless govt jobs and fast food jobs. You destroyed the construction industry; electricians, plumbers, carpenters, etc. you’re a born liar and pathetic human being.
1311368120750219264 2020-10-01 02:11:38 +0800 <Bellamente5> @LindseyGrahamSC why did you cut off Sen Kennedy and let Sen Booker go on and on about white supremacy and every kind of BS he could think of without one word of the Russia probe? What’s wrong with you?
1311361117042737153 2020-10-01 01:43:48 +0800 <Bellamente5> @SenBooker perhaps you could coordinate with Comey and Wray and give us a list of the white supremacist groups you’re talking about. Would really like to know who they are by name, not just a talking point.
1311356483347582983 2020-10-01 01:25:24 +0800 <Bellamente5> @BrandonStraka The Republican Party has been the party of roll over and play dead for decades. No More! I’d rather have a Rocky Balboa for President than a spineless wet noodle. This is the fight of our lives and if we have to go 15 rounds, so be it. This is Gods country and we will prevail.

1311352831425863682 2020-10-01 01:10:53 +0800 <Bellamente5> @LindseyGrahamSC why are you letting Blumenthal spew BS about white supremacy and the President when he should be questioning Comey about the Russia probe? Do you know what the hell you’re doing?
1311340084948598784 2020-10-01 00:20:14 +0800 <Bellamente5> @LeadStoriesCom I’ll believe that when Pelosi is really prayerful.

1311321282076696577 2020-09-30 23:05:31 +0800 <Bellamente5> Watching the Comey hearing right now. Another pathetic show of lies, and ass kissing by the fossils on the left who can’t get out of their own way. Comey needs to go to jail.

1311130331760799744 2020-09-30 10:26:45 +0800 <Bellamente5> Joe Biden couldn’t create a job if you tattooed the instructions on his forehead.

How many government contracts were given to your husbands RE business?  Those of you screaming about Trumps tax returns have the most skeletons in  your closets.

1310698203877199872 2020-09-29 05:49:38 +0800 <Bellamente5> @CallaWalsh Unfortunately they didn’t tell you the whole story about the taxes. Businesses are complex and the tax code is as well. Which is why the NYT apparently didn’t pay any federal income tax in 2017 even though they made $111 million.  Don’t believe everything you hear.

1310234129896800256 2020-09-27 23:05:34 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Gingerkelley77 @BreitbartNews Why is the Catholic religion the only religion allowed to be bashed and nothing is done about it. If it were the Jewish or Muslim religions, the MSM would be screaming from the highest rooftop. I hope all Catholics and evangelicals take note of this hypocrisy.
1310230860726235140 2020-09-27 22:52:34 +0800 <Bellamente5> @realDonaldTrump @VedanticFlaneur What a schmuck Blumenthal is.
1310230225083609090 2020-09-27 22:50:03 +0800 <Bellamente5> @BreitbartNews Actually, it was the death of RBG that thwarted the democrats plan to have the Supreme Court declare Biden the winner. Now you are all scrambling since once again your scheme backfired. We are wise to the New Marxist Party and we are watching.
1310217333118562304 2020-09-27 21:58:49 +0800 <Bellamente5> @TheRock @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris Did you realize before your announcement that the party you’re endorsing is not democratic at all but the New Marxist Party? You just lost millions of fans. Sad. Now I know “the rock” stands for the cement between your ears.

The ACA is an abomination and only passed because Roberts changed it to a “tax” otherwise it was unconstitutional and you know it which is why you had to pass it before you could see what was in it. Remember that?

The ACA was an abomination and only passed because Roberts changed it to a “tax”.  Roe v Wade was based on a lie. People need to do their own research cause all you demonrats do is lie.

1308489988879921158 2020-09-23 03:34:58 +0800 <Bellamente5> @SenSchumer CDC says 10,000 Americans died FROM Covid. 190,000 died from something else WITH covid. BIG difference.
1308488771990704128 2020-09-23 03:30:08 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JoeBiden According to the CDC, 10,000 people died from covid 19 and the other 190,000 died from something else with covid. BIG difference. Tell the truth, I know it’s hard.

1308115212483145731 2020-09-22 02:45:44 +0800 <Bellamente5> @DavidJHarrisJr That won’t work cause she’d actually have to do some work. That would interfere with the Netflix gig, the oceanfront mansion on Martha’s Vineyard or the new mansion they’re building in Hawaii. No time to sit at the SC and actually work. And then there’s a matter of intellect.....
1308113119684841472 2020-09-22 02:37:25 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Pismo_B I seriously hope this girls parents get her mental help soon. She is completely irrational. What a sad generation.
1308112109075562496 2020-09-22 02:33:25 +0800 <Bellamente5> @MiaFarrow That’s a lie. Also, anyone’s dying wish does not supersede the constitution. Being a SCJ she knew that so stop spreading a tall tale put out there just to cause chaos. #FillTheSeat

1308110549436203017 2020-09-22 02:27:13 +0800 <Bellamente5> @SicarioScott It’s sad that these young girls actually think they look good. Except for a small part in a horror movie, other than that not happening.
1308043489226219521 2020-09-21 22:00:44 +0800 <Bellamente5> @jefftimmer You forgot to mention the warehouses stacked with supplies and water never given to the people because of the corrupt PR politicians. Do your research and tell the truth. I know it’s hard but just try it.
1308041671003774978 2020-09-21 21:53:31 +0800 <Bellamente5> @MSNBC Following the constitution, a new scotus will be chosen. Hillary needs to retire since she is as relevant as a pet rock. Demonrats have no obstacle to use, they’re just trying to distract with their empty threats. The democrat party is dead. Call it what it is,the Socialist Party

1301857840454348803 2020-09-04 20:21:11 +0800 <Bellamente5> @jtothet Not since Krapernick started this Krap and won’t go back.
1301854677617782787 2020-09-04 20:08:37 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JimLaPorta @JeffreyGoldberg @realDonaldTrump Name your senior defense Dept official or STFU.
1301661354286297090 2020-09-04 07:20:25 +0800 <Bellamente5> @RepMattGaetz @NickRicci5 @Snowden @realDonaldTrump Totally agree
1301657606470148097 2020-09-04 07:05:31 +0800 <Bellamente5> @SymoneDSanders You’re lost as usual.

1301654525355470848 2020-09-04 06:53:17 +0800 <Bellamente5> @MarkDice @KristenSkogebo Would Crump feel the same if it was the officer that got shot.  We need reform but it starts with the family. Teach your children well and this won’t happen. Stop with the victimization and start with the education.
1301653106078486528 2020-09-04 06:47:38 +0800 <Bellamente5> @MAGA2ARIGHTS @Concealcarrygrl Which one is the guy?
1301651533445115906 2020-09-04 06:41:23 +0800 <Bellamente5> @KurtSchlichter @JohnG62047678 Blow it out your ass Liar of the House.
1301650925954703361 2020-09-04 06:38:58 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Toneman807 @Roonie_Bear It’s called anxiety cause your Uncle Joe and Kameltoe are never gonna win.
1301650343122608128 2020-09-04 06:36:39 +0800 <Bellamente5> @fuzzypoppy54 @CarolMariani1 I’m with you.
1301635417008209923 2020-09-04 05:37:21 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Pismo_B @AngelWarrior321 Nice!
1301623223889596422 2020-09-04 04:48:54 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JackPosobiec The man is as ignorant as the day is long. Not surprised Al, the race pimp extraordinaire, Sharpton is next to him more than likely adding up the $$.
1301554216155123718 2020-09-04 00:14:41 +0800 <Bellamente5> @USMCMIL03 One look at that moron tells you why his son is a bum.
1301553043687825410 2020-09-04 00:10:01 +0800 <Bellamente5> @DavidJHarrisJr Just proves a college education means nothing.
1301551879734857730 2020-09-04 00:05:24 +0800 <Bellamente5> @ScottMGreer More stupid white people
1301540517352747008 2020-09-03 23:20:15 +0800 <Bellamente5> @mpukita So sad that anyone could be that stupid.
1301534483368349696 2020-09-03 22:56:16 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JackPosobiec If the salon owner was serving customers as the stylist DeNardo claims in this letter, why would the owner complain about Pelosi if she’s just another customer. Not logical.
1301520331807617025 2020-09-03 22:00:02 +0800 <Bellamente5> @tedwheeler Time to get your head out of your ass Ted.
1301519129204207618 2020-09-03 21:55:16 +0800 <Bellamente5> @drdavidsamadi I’d hate to her patient, she’s an imbecile
1301333721174376448 2020-09-03 09:38:31 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Bubblebathgirl Because she likes everyone to think she’s a goody two shoes. You know the kind you wouldn’t trust for all the money in the world. AOC is run by the YoungTurks, she’s just their sock puppet. Not smart at all.
1301326042586664960 2020-09-03 09:08:00 +0800 <Bellamente5> @amicah1 Chinese rubber
1301325139267780608 2020-09-03 09:04:25 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Pismo_B That should be going on all,over the country
1301319031891296257 2020-09-03 08:40:09 +0800 <Bellamente5> @JaniceDean No he’s not. Bad choice.
1301272611066990594 2020-09-03 05:35:41 +0800 <Bellamente5> @LikeFineWine63 Looks like the whole hive.
1301265025026359298 2020-09-03 05:05:32 +0800 <Bellamente5> @TalKopan That is the most outrageous line of shit I’ve heard all day. Does the Liar of the House actually think anyone will believe that?
1301252744611868674 2020-09-03 04:16:45 +0800 <Bellamente5> @aubrey_huff @VerseCannon @gucci They look like they need an eggplant parmigiana wedge.
1301246874939207680 2020-09-03 03:53:25 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Genemey56 I feel sorry for the cops that had to put up with this pathetic excuse of a mayor.
1301244521242669063 2020-09-03 03:44:04 +0800 <Bellamente5> @CallingDrLove69 That sucks
1301218769302433793 2020-09-03 02:01:44 +0800 <Bellamente5> Biden doing a question and answer. What a lying dog faced pony soldier or maybe a horses ass.
1301202896315396096 2020-09-03 00:58:40 +0800 <Bellamente5> @RealMattCouch @RampageRantz I wouldn’t mess with the hillbillies, they will see you coming but you won’t see them. What an imbecile.
1301201922829975555 2020-09-03 00:54:48 +0800 <Bellamente5> @washingtonpost You have now outdone yourself with stupidity.
1301197134344093696 2020-09-03 00:35:46 +0800 <Bellamente5> @tedwheeler I have seen my fair share of stupid people over the years, but you, sadly are in a class all your own. You must owe your soul to your handlers for what you are doing. Pathetic.
1301189972209397763 2020-09-03 00:07:18 +0800 <Bellamente5> @emtee2355 @carolyn86452721 Haaaaaaaaa, Bubba gonna like him.
1301188483910897664 2020-09-03 00:01:24 +0800 <Bellamente5> @nwgoboating @carolyn86452721 Just another example of putting a complete moron in a high position.
1301186787646242816 2020-09-02 23:54:39 +0800 <Bellamente5> @KamalaHarris Why don’t you fundraise for those families instead of fundraising to bail out rioters. We know your priorities.
1301147996281802752 2020-09-02 21:20:31 +0800 <Bellamente5> @RepJoeKennedy I remember a certain senator who tried to justify the death of a certain Mary Jo.
1301144151862501376 2020-09-02 21:05:14 +0800 <Bellamente5> @KurtSchlichter @JohnG62047678 Who is this doofus Lane?
1301141607027220480 2020-09-02 20:55:07 +0800 <Bellamente5> @lsarsour The only thing irrelevant is you.
1300968741791031296 2020-09-02 09:28:13 +0800 <Bellamente5> @DailyCaller Total imbecilic statement.
1300968445840850945 2020-09-02 09:27:02 +0800 <Bellamente5> @tumptyone Now I know where the saying “dumb as a box of rocks” comes from. Total imbecile.
1300964460677472257 2020-09-02 09:11:12 +0800 <Bellamente5> @RetReaper @Patrick02236004 That’s a given.
1300956085491314689 2020-09-02 08:37:56 +0800 <Bellamente5> @realTrumpForce @12irishrose Ask him his newest grandchild’s name and birthday. (Hunter’s illegitimate baby who he tries not to support cause he’s a piece of shit)
1300951392346140675 2020-09-02 08:19:17 +0800 <Bellamente5> @KTVU Than she doesn’t deserve to be speaker if she can’t differentiate between right and wrong.
1300883482479132672 2020-09-02 03:49:26 +0800 <Bellamente5> @stirednotshakn He’s going to sniff it out of existence
1300876554008920065 2020-09-02 03:21:54 +0800 <Bellamente5> @RayGarciahawaii @Bri66815159 More savages
1300873203254951936 2020-09-02 03:08:35 +0800 <Bellamente5> @DailyMail Gee what a loss. Maybe he should’ve taught his son some  respect for women and the police.  Obviously it’s genetic.
1300872494149185536 2020-09-02 03:05:46 +0800 <Bellamente5> @hrkbenowen If they plaster the name of a rapist bum on their helmets, what does that say about their lack of character. They don’t deserve any fans whatsoever. They are disrespectful garbage.
1300835898603565059 2020-09-02 00:40:21 +0800 <Bellamente5> @ProjectLincoln Wow, so many doctors. I don t know which to believe.
1300831847883182080 2020-09-02 00:24:15 +0800 <Bellamente5> @KamalaHarris Try to keep up.
1300830756521095170 2020-09-02 00:19:55 +0800 <Bellamente5> @HillaryClinton This coming from the biggest nut job on the planet.
1300829383314280448 2020-09-02 00:14:27 +0800 <Bellamente5> @DeAnna4Congress They are connected.
1300828932850233345 2020-09-02 00:12:40 +0800 <Bellamente5> @LikeFineWine63 Hope they bankrupt themselves right out of existence
1300770491767099392 2020-09-01 20:20:27 +0800 <Bellamente5> @BrandonStraka @Bri66815159 She’s trying to topple Al Sharpton as the country’s best race pimp.
1300768189350019078 2020-09-01 20:11:18 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Alyssa_Milano Is BidenCalm a new sleeping pill?
1300766008471367680 2020-09-01 20:02:38 +0800 <Bellamente5> @Luca42755 Never worn one and never will!
1300765697862258688 2020-09-01 20:01:24 +0800 <Bellamente5> @igorbobic Sounds like that bothers you. Sounds like you tried and convicted the kid in the court of public opinion without all the facts. What if that happened to you?
1300615973184167936 2020-09-01 10:06:26 +0800 <Bellamente5> @MrAndyNgo Doesn’t look like he could fight his way out of a paper bag.
1300614741300310018 2020-09-01 10:01:33 +0800 <Bellamente5> @ChrisCuomo The strength we need is for so called journalists to grow a pair of balls and report the truth. Guess that leaves you out Stu Gots.
