1304901467950772225 2020-09-13 05:55:28 +0800 <kerbaron> @Kevin_Maguire I'm trying to remember what we used to do with traitors who brought foreign armies into Britain
1304865408336441344 2020-09-13 03:32:11 +0800 <kerbaron> @krystaKat28 Show him some older books, TV shows and films, so he sees what white societies look like
1304818685522173952 2020-09-13 00:26:31 +0800 <kerbaron> @Stephen90182822 That's why every classic film and TV series is being remade with a 'diverse' cast, and why every statute of a white person has people calling for it to be pulled down. To remove the memory of countries that used to be white
1304391664287600641 2020-09-11 20:09:41 +0800 <kerbaron> @PrisonPlanet I'm all for sacking Cressida Dick, but why this sudden dribble of sanity from the Marxist brigade?
1304011584864481280 2020-09-10 18:59:23 +0800 <kerbaron> @SomeBitchIKnow But on 93% of days there is no giant fire in Beirut so these people just need to watch less Fox news
1303491484235202560 2020-09-09 08:32:42 +0800 <kerbaron> If we let this go on, in a couple of generations it'll just be a conspiracy theory that Europe and the USA ever consisted of white nations  https://t.co/UyJAXC2eaa
1303406296130039810 2020-09-09 02:54:11 +0800 <kerbaron> Wake up, people
1303270527478509569 2020-09-08 17:54:42 +0800 <kerbaron> @thisislaurat Given how well-funded they are, that's a poor showing from Hope not Hate
1303165826581827585 2020-09-08 10:58:39 +0800 <kerbaron> Universities need to stop enabling students to be like this  https://t.co/a78gwwlKGX
1303136101801000960 2020-09-08 09:00:32 +0800 <kerbaron> A good one from Paul. With archive footage from the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the Weather Underground, and Democrat party activists promoting riots  https://t.co/uBJabBtEje
1302991407175610368 2020-09-07 23:25:34 +0800 <kerbaron> @MartinDaubney @NewStatesman Are they straight-up admitting that white people are better at journalism, so the only way to force diversity is to hobble whites?
1302987518627983361 2020-09-07 23:10:07 +0800 <kerbaron> @AngeloJohnGage @SerenaJB3 Ben Shapiro once said he and his family would move to Israel if the US ever banned religious circumcision. It's a really big deal to the chosen ones
1302984920055402496 2020-09-07 22:59:47 +0800 <kerbaron> @SnowDuchess1 Soon they won't let us mention Wakanda
1302979593658392582 2020-09-07 22:38:37 +0800 <kerbaron> @Lisaismyname89 That would explain why the police are taking so long to release details.   Maybe he was saying something anti-white during the attacks too
1302937587502460929 2020-09-07 19:51:42 +0800 <kerbaron> @DeoDuceVincemus Migrants made London unbearable
1302790880395485185 2020-09-07 10:08:45 +0800 <kerbaron> @dr_solemnis It's a bad time to be living in a diverse neighbourhood
1302697212867207169 2020-09-07 03:56:33 +0800 <kerbaron> @DailyMail We shouldn't have to live alongside them
1302663034968694787 2020-09-07 01:40:44 +0800 <kerbaron> Mostly peaceful protest
1302662646269988866 2020-09-07 01:39:11 +0800 <kerbaron> This chosen one makes it too easy  https://t.co/598nYwRt3b
1302661482161885184 2020-09-07 01:34:34 +0800 <kerbaron> @DailyMail Strange how well-funded Chinese influence doesn't worry her, I wonder why?
1302626878113624064 2020-09-06 23:17:04 +0800 <kerbaron> These mistakes always go the same way
1302620162533842946 2020-09-06 22:50:22 +0800 <kerbaron> Migrant academic explains that Swiss people will soon need intergration classes to live in their own country due to mass migration  https://t.co/o9I0798iut
1302293805564129281 2020-09-06 01:13:33 +0800 <kerbaron> @FreefromTorture France isn't that bad is it? Or maybe you people just want to flood the UK with endless waves of third worlders
1302291840956235779 2020-09-06 01:05:44 +0800 <kerbaron> Non-English people should not have opinions on who gets to live in the country and be supported here
1302070774614892544 2020-09-05 10:27:18 +0800 <kerbaron> @NoTatsClassy And flood their media and films and advertising with messages saying children are bad and childfree people are happy
1301989082034249728 2020-09-05 05:02:41 +0800 <kerbaron> @thisislaurat Environmentalism, animal rights and the organic food movements all have their roots in far right politics
1301933930992594944 2020-09-05 01:23:32 +0800 <kerbaron> @_Kenziepuff Never respond to hate from anyone with &lt;100 followers they could be fishing for something to report your account

1301597885226721281 2020-09-04 03:08:13 +0800 <kerbaron> @pritipatel Great, let's see more of this. Don't forget the estimated 1M illegals in London too!
1301555354699018242 2020-09-04 00:19:12 +0800 <kerbaron> Bird names are as racist as statues of white people  https://t.co/4lwhqC8m9i
1301540832642727941 2020-09-03 23:21:30 +0800 <kerbaron> There are far too many teachers and academics in Antifa. Something is wrong with the education system  https://t.co/I5qfgVCHKr
1301533170240827392 2020-09-03 22:51:03 +0800 <kerbaron> At this point, academia is basically at war with civilisation  https://t.co/V1SWGesOYv
1301482970730115074 2020-09-03 19:31:35 +0800 <kerbaron> @PatriotActive66 A good way to solve overcrowding in our cities is to deport Lineker, and anyone else who thinks it's a good idea to flood the UK with third worlders
1301441119025344512 2020-09-03 16:45:17 +0800 <kerbaron> @Kekkadivvy @Lagartha17 And the worst thing ever to happen to whites
1301116228518514688 2020-09-02 19:14:17 +0800 <kerbaron> @PatriotActive66 Throw them all on the same deportation boat, not one of these protesters deserves to live in a decent country
1300900453924864001 2020-09-02 04:56:52 +0800 <kerbaron> @LibertarianBlue @BreitbartNews No wonder the commies on Twitter are so ill-informed
1300887946317443072 2020-09-02 04:07:10 +0800 <kerbaron> @DianaWintah Positive racism is the best kind
1300800192233517057 2020-09-01 22:18:28 +0800 <kerbaron> @Catsplaining Every day the same  https://t.co/x3SPaC121q's creepy how relentless the BBC messaging is
1300790235446607877 2020-09-01 21:38:54 +0800 <kerbaron> @HaydenHewitt Kumar is mind-numbingly shit and deserves to be in the first wave booted from the BBC
1300788695449194500 2020-09-01 21:32:47 +0800 <kerbaron> The BBC went woke years ago. Their website and TV light entertainment has become pure lefty propaganda, and every on-screen right-winger has been purged. This survey shows how pervasive left-wing propaganda is in UK society
1300786926224642050 2020-09-01 21:25:45 +0800 <kerbaron> @DVATW Interesting argument considering blacks kill about 3000 non-blacks each year in the US
1300784908751831042 2020-09-01 21:17:44 +0800 <kerbaron> @TweetBrettMac @TanyaCornfield Every person and organisation that supported them shares some blame
1300784415216410626 2020-09-01 21:15:46 +0800 <kerbaron> The most disturbing thing about watching journos and academics lie on twitter is not the lies themselves (although they are bad) but now I'm wondering how much of mainstream  history is a lie written by the same kind of creatures
