1344069440007065600 2020-12-30 07:55:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DocDruCinCity Oh they are definitely a racist. They make everything about someone’s race.   They claim white ppl are getting enrolled in college just because of their skin color. I guess they never heard of ppl having money and paying their way in including black ppl with money.
1344068903090044928 2020-12-30 07:52:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl You are assuming “legacy students” haven’t earned their way.   But chumps like you who claim they are a day trader making a 1500% increase are still somehow oppressed by the fkin system because of your skin color? Cry me a river you pos racist trash.
1344048994184400896 2020-12-30 06:33:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl And does that mean because they are “legacy students” they haven’t earned their way?   You like to assume a lot don’t you? I guess LeBron’s kids don’t have a chance huh?
1344025747111825408 2020-12-30 05:01:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl So does skin color get you in at a higher rate at an HBCU than white people or naw?
1344025461840465925 2020-12-30 05:00:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl Well white ppl make up 68% of the population unlike black people who make up 12%. So of course there are more white ppl applying to college than black ppl or any other minority.   Did you ever take that into consideration? How many white ppl apply to HBCUs?

1343743839060676608 2020-12-29 10:21:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl Like I said gyms and small businesses in republican areas didn’t shutdown so why did yours?   If you vote democrat it’s because you easily give up your rights. They like voters like you.  https://t.co/niIM9uqH3u
1343742935917948929 2020-12-29 10:17:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl No, shutting down businesses like gyms was because of Democrats numbnuts. Your reading comprehension is lacking btw. Also I’m not an idiot who blames viruses on political parties or presidents like you.
1343742240850550785 2020-12-29 10:14:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl So why am I mediocre? You don’t have to say you hate white ppl your tweets clearly show your dislike and racism for whites.   I don’t give af what your portfolio looks like my stock is up too and I work in a hospital. I’m good. 😂
1343741402925072384 2020-12-29 10:11:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl The only racist here is you..   FYI your business was killed because of democrats who shut down GYMS look around you. Atlanta is swarming with democrats they shut you down while republicans kept businesses open. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Democrat’s never cared about you.
1343740692456095744 2020-12-29 10:08:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl Who said you weren’t qualified or talented? 😂 It’s funny I always hear from democrats how only the rich have stocks and blah blah blah, but you’re a “day trader” who hates white ppl and feels oppressed?   I can’t stop laughing.  https://t.co/DPCR6vTxkK
1343740048332615680 2020-12-29 10:06:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl I said what you said was low IQ. Which it was.   So now I’m stupid because you don’t like someone calling you out for wanting to ruin ppls lives over a word?   If anything you proved to be the racist here and I hope your business suffers for it. Fair?
1343739438359142400 2020-12-29 10:03:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl FYI:  Doing business w/someone like this who isn’t for freedom doesn’t deserve business at all. If you say a word they find “offensive” they believe your life should be ruined over it.   Choose wisely folks..  https://t.co/gdF5wh7MUW

1343737666764820480 2020-12-29 09:56:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailoredfitatl Like I said, how can you claim the term is offensive when black ppl use it all the time just to say whats up? 😂  Like c’mon bruh that’s pretty low IQ.   What aren’t you allowed to do because of your race in 2020? So then I guess if you use YT your life should be ruined too?
1343736149903228928 2020-12-29 09:50:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I want to know what’s in the bill they passed? I can’t pull it up. If it’s a targeted bill to help Americans I’m all for it but if includes political fluff they can fk off.  https://t.co/ifDJzUy1pu

1342570109718564865 2020-12-26 04:37:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because republicans want a targeted bill only for Americans not the crap democrats put out to fund the world on OUR dime you fkin hag.

They don’t. The only ppl coming in illegally are those trying to subvert our immigration laws in most cases.
1341956197121855489 2020-12-24 11:57:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla I don’t have to read the whole thing. I know ppl who work in the fields and are grateful they are able to hire more migrant workers now because of Trumps policies.   No one minds migrant workers because they are here temporarily and they are welcome to become citizens later.
1341955544450359297 2020-12-24 11:55:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla Ppl from the Philippines also do these labor type jobs and come here legally.   If you are claiming the only type of ppl who do this work are ppl who come in illegally from our southern border that’s stereotyping and a bit racist.
1341954781573574661 2020-12-24 11:52:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla I know plenty of LEGAL immigrants who work in the fields. I’m not sure why you think the only ppl doing these jobs are illegals. I know housekeepers and gardeners who are here legally too. Even own their own businesses and came here as immigrants.

You are assuming only illegals do this kind of work? My mother was born in this country and worked in the fields as did her father who was also born in the US.
1341952541400027136 2020-12-24 11:43:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla So are you saying you’re ok with slave labor? I mean if businesses can’t hire legal ppl for minimum wage we should let illegals come in and work for less or else businesses will leave?   You aren’t the same ppl asking for a $15 minimum wage are you?
1341950917671755776 2020-12-24 11:36:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla Who was discussing America First? That’s something you brought up because your argument is not consistent.   Yes I believe OUR citizens matter more than others from other countries.   So yes I rather feed our citizens with our tax dollars than others.
1341949515863973888 2020-12-24 11:31:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla I have to keep wondering why you think the US has to do more and why you’d want anyone to come to a country where ppl like you claim are putting ppl in concentration camps, ripping children away from their parents, are racist and where cops kill minorities daily?

Are you also saying that we should fund corrupt governments who violate the human rights of THEIR citizens with OUR money?
1341947444649574400 2020-12-24 11:22:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla Who do you actually think gets put into these detention centers?   Did you know that coyotes heard about illegals being released into the country more often if they had a child.   So ppl started coming in illegally with children. In some cases rented children to strangers.
1341946876803739650 2020-12-24 11:20:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla Migrant workers come here legally on work visas. That’s also completely different then coming here illegally and working with a fake social and ID.   Like I said you seem to be confused with LEGAL entry and ILLEGAL entry into the country.

Ppl are rejected for lots of reasons. Ppl who seek asylum are disqualified if they return to their country of origin which most do because they only come here to work.

The UN doesn’t over rule our own country’s laws.   Ppl who are already in the country illegally don’t often go thru the process in fear of being deported.

We aren’t obligated to accept anyone in this country no matter their situation. For all we know there could have been Nazis claiming to be Jews to get access to the US and start something here.

But asylum has very particular requirements.   In the case of the Jews and what they were dealing with during WWII that isn’t the same as why ppl come here illegally from south of our border.
1341873450193829888 2020-12-24 06:28:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla I don’t think you’re understanding what I’m saying.   If they were seeking asylum they should have been allowed to go thru that process and be vetted because they were doing it the legal way. They weren’t just attempting to get in illegally disrespecting our immigration laws.
1341821368824856576 2020-12-24 03:01:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla I never claimed you were a democrat or anything for that matter. I said that the president that denied entry to Jews in the 1930s was a progressive.

Very different situation. We don’t share a border with Europe.

We shouldn’t jail kids with their parents you agreed.  You posted asylum seekers are vetted. Then I mentioned not all are asylum seekers so what do we do with the ones that aren’t?
1341797632482574338 2020-12-24 01:27:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla They were denied asylum in the US by a progressive president in the 1930s maybe ask why?
1341797289258409984 2020-12-24 01:26:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla I already know more than you do because I know the difference between illegal and legal entry.   I also work at a hospital where I see a lot of illegal immigrants when I discuss with them why they came here it was to have kids because Medicare pays and work then return home.
1341796579137650689 2020-12-24 01:23:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla You seem to have LEGAL entry and ILLEGAL entry confused.   Maybe figure that out first and come back when you have a better understanding of illegal immigration at our borders.
1341796230481862656 2020-12-24 01:22:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian They wouldn’t let me.

1341795809021419520 2020-12-24 01:20:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 @awkwardlefty_cj @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla She assumes that every person coming in is an asylum seeker. 😂   Most Hispanics who come here illegally don’t qualify for asylum because they have records in our country and their own. So they keep sneaking in. Imagine being the type of person ok with human trafficking.
1341795416145186821 2020-12-24 01:18:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @awkwardlefty_cj @BeardyMan1983 @JordanUhl @Chinchillazllla I see you have a problem with a Hispanic telling you how it is when it comes to illegal immigration.   Which I find absolutely hilarious.

They are attempting to come in legally and arevetted.   Ppl who come here illegally come via coyotes outside of ports of entry scaling walls and dragging kids along with them in hopes of getting in even abandoning kids in the desert.  https://t.co/7kFGTGlZcy

I guess you just want ppl to come across our border no questions asked? What if they are carrying a serious contagion? Ok? What if they are a human trafficker or rapist? Ok?
1341791822352318471 2020-12-24 01:04:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian They had to make sure I wasn’t a ROBOT. 🙄

Trump has actively been tracking pedos down while leftists prop up MAPs   I remember when leftists claimed Trump would get us into wars in 4 yrs it never happened and all he’s pushed is peace deals 😂 Leftists remain the dumbest ppl on earth.
1341577874164224001 2020-12-23 10:54:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ChinaVirus9 We shouldn’t give any money to foreign countries right now not even Israel dumbass.   Why should the US get involved in changing a culture with OUR money that doesn’t want to change &amp; hates us?   Leftists are garbage always trying to buy ppl off with other ppl’s money.

Unless you believe COVID that has a 99% survival rate would kill YOU in particular.   Also didn’t you say ppl who claimed COVID was a hoax shouldn’t be helped in hospitals or get ventilators?   Again the hypocrisy abounds with you.

1341256213464457217 2020-12-22 13:36:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis How do you know what I support?   Oh that’s right you assumed. 😂 Typical.
1341255447731290117 2020-12-22 13:33:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis And you believe historical record can never be changed?   I’ll tell you what Grant probably didn’t like fascist bigots like you.
1341255120533639168 2020-12-22 13:31:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis This fascist bigoted chode is now asking why ppl are hiding and disguising their names much like the Jews had to in 1933 from Nazis like him.
1341254616785121282 2020-12-22 13:29:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis First I know my history. Nazis asked for names of ppl and put them on lists.   Are you attempting to claim that isn’t true?   So you admit to being a fascist pos who wants to ruin ppls lives because they don’t agree with you politically.   Again how is this not NAZI like?
1341253783041368065 2020-12-22 13:26:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis And how do you know that historical record is factual?
1341253202163863552 2020-12-22 13:24:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis How do you know what Grant would think?
1341252604047708160 2020-12-22 13:21:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis Because for some weird reason you are wanting ppls names and calling our ppl who won’t give their names. Why would you need anyone’s name unless you plan to doxx or put someone on a “list” like the Nazis did in 1933?
1341252106330624001 2020-12-22 13:19:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco You know these type of ppl always throw random racism in their tweets.
1341251555379429377 2020-12-22 13:17:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 I’m super sad that cheaters feel like they’ve been exposed and can’t continue to cheat ppl out of elections.   It’s almost like the 2020 election win was all they needed.
1341250921750167557 2020-12-22 13:15:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JMSimonChi @TheMSMaquis He said you sound like a Nazi.
1341250535366615042 2020-12-22 13:13:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Boo hoo.
1341247299649847298 2020-12-22 13:00:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why do you need their names? 🤔
1341244493320708098 2020-12-22 12:49:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck What a lovely dietary choice.
1341244391290150913 2020-12-22 12:49:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sure you’ve read it right? The government is worthless. We just want you to stay out of our lives and leave us tf alone.
1341243351908012032 2020-12-22 12:45:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yet she supported Biden and his racism and bigotry for years.
1341241681459363841 2020-12-22 12:38:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It shouldn’t nor should it go to Pakistan for gender studies. How tf are these countries OUR problem?! #VetoTheBill

1341213287728332801 2020-12-22 10:45:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gotsumpnferya @catturd2 And you should be.
1341212425618481152 2020-12-22 10:42:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #POLITICALPORK that has zero value for the American ppl. This is why Trump ran on Americans first but you ppl voted for a racist, establishment, crony capitalist bought by China.
1341211602083663872 2020-12-22 10:38:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Facts.. they will vote yes and could give af if we’ve had a chance to read it or not.
1341211061500801024 2020-12-22 10:36:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It is a joke when we are giving billions to other countries and art galleries.  https://t.co/U9TeIdEzDc
1341210205116190720 2020-12-22 10:33:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @browniebigsmall @imitationbacun About $112 for only those who are unemployed.
1341210028213116929 2020-12-22 10:32:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun If you divided it just among the 12.6M who are unemployed it’s about another $112.

I’d have an issue as well.
1341202927701032960 2020-12-22 10:04:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @semperdiced @CawthornforNC Maybe he wants to make sure that ppl have no doubt that he won his election.
1341198783426785281 2020-12-22 09:48:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Absolutely disgusting @senatemajldr @GOPLeader we expect this shit from democrats. Why are you negotiating with these traitors?!
1341196835281461249 2020-12-22 09:40:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JohnnyBananas79 How did we get here?!
1341196674190872576 2020-12-22 09:39:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Guess how much money we would save if we stopped paying congress?   Senate: 174,000 x 100 = 17,400,000.00   House:  174,000 x 435 = 75,690,00.00   Each member also gets: $944,671 a year for “allowance”.   This doesn’t include the bonus House speaker and Majority leader gets.  https://t.co/i3mHsp65sv
1341193966910205954 2020-12-22 09:28:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you’re a leftist fascist pos. These are the same ppl who want socialized medicine remember that.
1341193384107524096 2020-12-22 09:26:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why are you negotiating with those criminals @senatemajldr?
1341193031249141760 2020-12-22 09:25:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SullyBobbi Guess she missed the SNARKY in your name Bobbi.
1341192878568005638 2020-12-22 09:24:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EtepMax accurate. I LOL’d
1341192684019482625 2020-12-22 09:23:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Please tell me you just failed to read the SNARKY in her name before responding?
1341191643261648896 2020-12-22 09:19:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier I don’t need a stimulus. I haven’t stopped working as an essential worker.   I agree they should have just extended unemployment benefits for Americans who find themselves unemployed.   Also the government never gives you anything for free you’ll be taxed on that stimulus money.
1341190895853441025 2020-12-22 09:16:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wtf?! Twitter fascists.
1341190433225883649 2020-12-22 09:14:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The political pork you want your grandchildren to be in debited for is disgusting.

1341066057054703616 2020-12-22 01:00:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA Nope. Sharing is caring. Im an actual adult I don’t get pressed over children and who they have crushes on.
1341065581278085121 2020-12-22 00:58:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA You didn’t have to. I shared anyway. Just like you did when I never asked.
1341065417024884736 2020-12-22 00:58:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey they could have said $0.00 like they did the last few months even when Republicans and Trump agreed on more if it was only for the American ppl not all the additional political fat.
1341064732241846272 2020-12-22 00:55:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA I prefer..  https://t.co/8GfGBACjMI
1341063831670288384 2020-12-22 00:51:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA Not my type, but you do you boo.
1341063335823872001 2020-12-22 00:49:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA The kids always post these. 😂
1341063118907088901 2020-12-22 00:48:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA Oh is this what the kids do when they get upset? They bomb you with gifs and memes which seems like a social media tantrum? 😂  Are you sure you’re 20?
1341062721798721538 2020-12-22 00:47:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA Why am I mad? I’m not even a Robert E Lee fan. 😂 Im just not a hypocrite and I have no issue with ppl flying a flag or having a statue that doesn’t affect my life.
1341062094523748355 2020-12-22 00:44:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA To think you’re 20 is really sad. Our education system has really fked up a whole generation.
1341061729707442176 2020-12-22 00:43:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA Haha. Here we go. So then you wanting to take down a statue of a white man because his past offends you makes you racist too doesn’t it?
1341061258276032512 2020-12-22 00:41:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA “Slave” not salve. Because it’s offensive and whenever something is offensive to someone it should be taken down or removed right? They don’t need those statues when they already have the names of slaves in the memorial itself. Ppl chained up is more offensive than a man standing  https://t.co/EGNPn3LYdH
1341060561233010689 2020-12-22 00:38:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA I repeat you haven’t learned much from history class. What are you 16?
1341060369649831936 2020-12-22 00:38:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA I don’t see the point of people waving this flag proudly, yet it is.  https://t.co/dHLW9vBgUk
1341059603929288705 2020-12-22 00:34:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA And I’d be just as happy to see the slave memorial taken down but I wouldn’t ask for it to be taken down because it’s part of our history.   That’s the difference.
1341059110242930690 2020-12-22 00:33:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA I’m guessing you believe flying the confederate flag shows ppl celebrating General Lee and not the south and their history as a whole? 😂   I’m guessing your history classes haven’t taught you much.
1341058252281298950 2020-12-22 00:29:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA No you said they can be written in history books. No need for statues. And tell me what great things does this image provide you?  https://t.co/zO7dNLjk3D
1341057667112919040 2020-12-22 00:27:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA Who celebrates General Lee in 2020?
1341057426301206540 2020-12-22 00:26:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA I’m not dense you claimed we don’t need statues because we have history books. Are you talking that back all of a sudden?
1341057198038794245 2020-12-22 00:25:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea we just found out doctors were intubating patients because of the COVID fear mongering from the media and not knowing how contagious it really was. Putting ppl on ventilators causes a lot of issues including death. Disgusting.  https://t.co/5Ua9W9JYBH
1341055365044039680 2020-12-22 00:18:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoriLightfoot is complicit, that’s why.
1341052463240019980 2020-12-22 00:06:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No problem Jack just make a fund and have ppl apply so you can send them the difference I’m sure you have plenty to spare. Other millionaires and billionaires should do the same. The government wants your money most anyway. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1341051886233812999 2020-12-22 00:04:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good luck Germany and Finland.
1341051478241202176 2020-12-22 00:02:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btshyunglinehoe @GovernorVA Really? So then no statues should exist anywhere for anyone? Then take these down too. History books can be rewritten. Ever read 1984?  https://t.co/VRKHx2iEmF
1341050390494597124 2020-12-21 23:58:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But I’m sure still voted for Biden in fear. *smh*
1341050174286700546 2020-12-21 23:57:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GovernorVA Ppl who want to remove a statue to virtue signal are the biggest aholes on the planet.   I remind you Robert E Lee existed and that won’t ever change.
1341049798258900992 2020-12-21 23:56:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What kind of step forward do you think this really is “coon man”? Also trying to change our history is exactly what NAZIS did.
1341048892096356352 2020-12-21 23:52:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PoetLife @KeithOlbermann I completely agree you’re a fkin pendejo if you believe Keith who’s a TDS afflicted conspiracy theorist is telling the truth. After 4 fkin years you ppl still believe this crap.
1341048530102755328 2020-12-21 23:50:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lying sack of fear mongering sheit.
1341048103235829761 2020-12-21 23:49:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sick to my stomach. Imagine what it would be like if the government was able to pass socialized healthcare for all?
1340930645548171265 2020-12-21 16:02:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Also why would you give money to ppl who never stopped working?   I know it’s like a tax break but then the government will just claim it was wages and tax you again on it.
1340929248605863937 2020-12-21 15:57:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun They can’t think ahead or out of the box.
1340928524153016321 2020-12-21 15:54:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why would ppl ever go back to work if you pay them more to stay home?
1340928278467543040 2020-12-21 15:53:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good luck to them hope they don’t ask for American assistance.
1340927257062227968 2020-12-21 15:49:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Awww thank you. ☺️
1340926524296294401 2020-12-21 15:46:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lady they are not social distancing nor wearing masks in the image. I thought part of “locking down” meant not socializing with ppl you don’t have to socialize with?
1340926152345407489 2020-12-21 15:44:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s hope you didn’t vote for Biden.
1340802700745744384 2020-12-21 07:34:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoshD0110 I hope he helped them escape.
1340802359144812544 2020-12-21 07:32:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And they call us conspiracy theorists.
1340798750202052609 2020-12-21 07:18:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The cruelty of socialized medicine.
1340798074738774016 2020-12-21 07:15:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I remember when trying not to get ppl to panic about COVID turned into “Trump murdered thousands”.
1340787331335290880 2020-12-21 06:33:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And they expect ppl who worked for these things to just allow this to happen? 😂🤣😂  https://t.co/cEF0XqnxoW

1340777696716967937 2020-12-21 05:54:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t think the @ProjectLincoln realizes their grift is over. They’ve alienated Trump supporters while they call themselves conservative and the left never truly liked them unless they were screaming ORANGE MAN BAD the whole time.   Without Trump to hate they are NOTHING.  https://t.co/PZmQKXSIjE

1340775059288326145 2020-12-21 05:44:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If it wasn’t for Trump ppl like me wouldn’t even know who tf you are.   If shutting out 74M ppl from liking you or your music seems like a wise choice. I’m sure it will work out well.
1340774478804992000 2020-12-21 05:42:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tomorrow is NEVER guaranteed.
1340769322147319809 2020-12-21 05:21:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Neither.
1340769082568630273 2020-12-21 05:20:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh and make sure you have a populous stupid enough to believe it without verifying anything.
1340767878967005187 2020-12-21 05:15:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No we don’t. You will reap the hell you and your party have sowed the last 4 yrs.
1340767524988731393 2020-12-21 05:14:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap I recommend recording his stories so they are never lost or forgotten.   If I could I would record my patients who tell me their stories about the depression and WWII.

Damn I wonder what everyone did before that seatbelt law existed or stop signs for that matter? 🤔  https://t.co/sKh2EGc3lk
1340708764970754048 2020-12-21 01:20:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The media stays lying about Trump and the they continue to believe it. Such fkin sheep. Trump sets these ppl up and they run with it every time.  https://t.co/ka6zMlN1qi

1340692300796551168 2020-12-21 00:15:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird we aren’t the ppl destroying the country, saying we should make lists of our enemies, sending the opposing side to camps and ostracize them publicly, that’s the left. The left always projects then attempts to justify their fascist ways by dehumanizing their opponent.
1340691621159964673 2020-12-21 00:12:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 As if the left hasn’t already declared martial law on small businesses and our constitutional rights.
1340690349312765953 2020-12-21 00:07:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left: Stop dehumanizing ppl you racist bigot!   Also the left: *making lists*  https://t.co/FhMTjD1B95

1340087449515556864 2020-12-19 08:12:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Anne’s point is there doesn’t need to be a new “chef czar” position in the government in order for him to continue to feed the needy, foreign or not.

1340084663084228608 2020-12-19 08:00:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ehe3965 That was the argument someone made that as long as it’s LEGAL it’s ok by them.   You act as if things aren’t being made illegal as we speak. Slavery was legal once too.   What makes Roe v Wade a super precedent? Has it not been challenged in court multiple times?

It’s expensive &amp; not easily available. Knowing the president doesn’t change that fact. Also more billionaires backed Biden so you think they lobbied for some “sweet regeneron”?

1340020180961771520 2020-12-19 03:44:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M Agreed.
1340019887524081664 2020-12-19 03:43:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ppl who have been vaccinated get the info as well as their PCP. Why would you need to show some random person your medical info? If you don’t trust ppl and demand proof maybe you shouldn’t leave your house.
1340018393747845120 2020-12-19 03:37:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ironic coming from someone who has consumed other human beings just for kicks.
1340017797020061697 2020-12-19 03:35:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CarolynG0213 Make sure you have friend/family you can contact and is available to check on you in case you feel worse.   Vitamins and chicken noodle soup. Plus anything you normally take for headaches.   Get better soon. 🙏🏼
1340016870632484865 2020-12-19 03:31:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion @hyacinthgrrl She’s great. I ♥️ her.
1340016729183809537 2020-12-19 03:30:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M You can find it condescending but the truth remains. The pricks are those destroying jobs not the ones telling you that jobs stimulate the economy.
1340016296222605312 2020-12-19 03:29:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion @commiefifi She considers her LUNCH break work or she’s never had a job in her fkin life?
1340014909153705986 2020-12-19 03:23:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let me put it this way for the intellectually dishonest ppl out there. I don’t fkin care if those 200k ballots belong to Rep, Dem, Lib, Prog, Trump, Biden or Jorgenson. If you do not follow the election rules YOUR vote should NOT count.  https://t.co/hi5l8oPZRQ
1340012940007653376 2020-12-19 03:15:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The pricks are the ones destroying jobs not the ones telling you jobs stimulate the economy. That’s just a fact.
1340012049779228673 2020-12-19 03:12:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is what fascists do.
1340011885706399745 2020-12-19 03:11:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How tf is this news?
1340008718998458368 2020-12-19 02:59:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left: Proving government officials are frauds when it comes to COVID on Netflix (bad)  Also the left: Pedophilia on Netflix (ok)
1340007229131345920 2020-12-19 02:53:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pogoboii31 Right?! Anyone’s chest bone could fracture under that kind of pressure.
1340006767153954817 2020-12-19 02:51:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is a death blow.
1340004909920313344 2020-12-19 02:44:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How do ppl wake up work 40 hrs a week and say “yes, I’m glad 40% of my earned wages are taken by the government &amp; given to communists who hate capitalism” without questioning how absurd communism and the government is?
1340003203916603398 2020-12-19 02:37:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 Or a vitamin B shot.

1339984535883112450 2020-12-19 01:23:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s not an attack on her doctorate. When ppl say they are a “doctor” majority of ppl will assume it’s medical NOT educational.
1339982847889735681 2020-12-19 01:16:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Keomaste @Mr_Babe_Lincoln @tedcruz After that happened every time he had a rally I would watch it LIVE if possible. I would then see how the media attempted to twist so much of what he said because they never wanted to show the people the context then the Hollywood ppl and elites would spread it.
1339979154834354176 2020-12-19 01:01:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Keomaste @Mr_Babe_Lincoln @tedcruz I’m glad to share it with you. I believed that he mocked the disabled reporter because it’s all the media repeated when it happened. Then I saw this video and realized I was blatantly lied to by them while I spread it unwillingly. I felt used and disgusted. Never again.
1339977189492576256 2020-12-19 00:53:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Mr_Babe_Lincoln @tedcruz Here’s the video if you care to actually tell the truth of at least stop spreading lies.    https://t.co/ko0AnG8apK
1339976874743623680 2020-12-19 00:52:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Mr_Babe_Lincoln @tedcruz He NEVER mocked the disabled reporter. That was a lie the media obviously convinced you of and you kept repeating. #sucker

1339971495355842563 2020-12-19 00:31:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PotMeetsKettle He also said Hunter was an intellectual. 🤦🏻‍♀️ I wonder if the media is going to fact check this.
1339970116956475393 2020-12-19 00:25:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sure vote for a man that blatantly lies to you all by saying his drug addicted son who has pictures with a crack pipe in his mouth, had a kid with a stripper and hooked up with his dead brother’s wife is “the smartest man” he knows. 😂  https://t.co/p0ixhTIMan

1339472418457354240 2020-12-17 15:28:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I really don’t understand what you ppl mean by “out of control COVID”. When cases are rising in places like Los Angeles, but not across the WHOLE STATE. Out of 287 deaths reported today 160 of them are from just 3 counties in ALL of California.  https://t.co/C40lAAFOyX
1339469407081230336 2020-12-17 15:16:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob That whole thread in one meme..  https://t.co/OSfzosdepw

1339467977960243200 2020-12-17 15:10:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you’re getting the vaccine to continue doing the same you were doing prior to the vaccine?   Damn virtue signaling is a b*tch.
1339467309748867072 2020-12-17 15:07:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So overwhelmed no way they can make choreographed videos like this to post on Tik Tok when we are told COVID cases are rising and “gathering” in large groups is prohibited.
1339466803311910913 2020-12-17 15:05:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SeanNeutron Lmao. It’s delicious.

1339458569725362176 2020-12-17 14:33:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats love killing the Christmas spirit and minority jobs. It’s a #twofer in 2020.

1339447571186556928 2020-12-17 13:49:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 😂 @NBA made a poor choice when they politicized the league. I was a huge sports fan. I don’t watch anymore. These ppl never really understood why we watched in the first place.
1339442108059381763 2020-12-17 13:27:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m not gonna lie when some of you change your avis I have no idea who the hell you are. It’s weird.

1339440792973189120 2020-12-17 13:22:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lots of drug addicts go the “art” route when their brains are mush and can barely spell out their names anymore.
1339440029534310401 2020-12-17 13:19:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who the hell is killing “minorities” just because of their skin color? As a minority you’d think I’d fkin know this!

1339328438717431809 2020-12-17 05:55:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well looks like 60% of those ppl polled are pretty fkin stupid.
1339321794398830592 2020-12-17 05:29:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s be honest neither her nor Biden will make it to 2050 so pretending “zero emissions” is possible without destroying our economy will have no consequences for either of them.   Also more “former” Obama ppl in Biden cabinet positions is pretty telling.  https://t.co/gBB1YgjYBE

I don’t like all republicans but this is something democrats do consistently. @RepAdamSchiff blatantly lied to Americans about Trump colluding w/ Russia. Then these Dems lied about the Hunter Biden story being Russian disinformation.  https://t.co/dH6z0awyft
1339315818488766466 2020-12-17 05:05:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The democrat elite continue to remind us how the rules are for thee not for me.   https://t.co/C6Rch27si6

While democrats continue to rip you ppl off asking for money for transitions they get money for and now BLM begging for a meeting they can’t get. 😂🤣😂   Biden         vs.       Trump  https://t.co/OjGIAjZbOH
1339271887604441088 2020-12-17 02:11:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you’re giving the green light to mothers who kill their children as ok? What if these women have done it more than once? Murder is murder.
1339268991102066688 2020-12-17 01:59:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 When did I say ppl need to shut up about abortions?   That funding was stopped? You mean the funding PP refused if they couldn’t use it for abortions too?   Conservatives got together to donate for a section of the wall because they wanted it. How much have you donated to PP?
1339268431451811842 2020-12-17 01:57:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 ^ in case you didn’t realize 2014 wasn’t a presidential election year either.
1339268169597288450 2020-12-17 01:56:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 They were not. They even happened under Obama but clearly you’re limited because of your ignorance. So I guess according to your thinking Obama paid these ppl to travel to the US to create a crisis too?    https://t.co/6zGar6NidS  https://t.co/6zGar6NidS

1339266014773559299 2020-12-17 01:47:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So ppl can’t even love their country anymore in the US? I’m guessing Josh will gain more supporters after this.
1339265355135373312 2020-12-17 01:45:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 Weird ppl have complained about not paying for abortions with their tax dollars too. I guess you might understand how that feels now.   If you “feel” your taxes were used while not knowing.
1339264308388106241 2020-12-17 01:41:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine being this triggered over a commercial where someone sells pillows, bed sheets and mattress pads.
1339263790110556165 2020-12-17 01:39:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s how most communist countries start.
1339263486438731776 2020-12-17 01:37:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Priorities.
1339263228858126336 2020-12-17 01:36:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MajorPatriot @hwchapman49 Let’s hope you’re right, but right before an election where he NEEDS to win in GA it’s never good.   Also this last minute shit is infuriating. We’ve been waiting far too long for something to happen. Yet here we are.
1339262616590401542 2020-12-17 01:34:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jazonuxlay I think most of us are. If the left can have autonomous zones and sanctuary cities so can we, except ours will be clean and not filled with shit, needles and degenerates.
1339262109570408448 2020-12-17 01:32:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ram41662 Yet wants to do away with the death penalty that protects those “evil white males” too. I guess she forgets.
1339261792858435589 2020-12-17 01:31:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Snow leopard baby ♥️   https://t.co/Kapti9QYRQ
1339261412942565377 2020-12-17 01:29:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jazonuxlay Looks like conservatives are going to have to protect their cities with walls and go full Walking Dead and prevent the leftist zombies access to those areas.
1339261010633375746 2020-12-17 01:28:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 If you think Mexico was ever sending ppl to protect our border or theirs or taking in asylum seekers before you’d be sadly mistaken.   Mexico knew that ppl going thru their country just wanted into the US so they wouldn’t stop them.   https://t.co/PWcb2INPq1
1339259893463699460 2020-12-17 01:23:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 And how do you know your taxes were used?   Also when there’s zero air travel happening how else do you think illegals are getting in during a pandemic? Some of y’all really are ignorant af.    https://t.co/04axEoYIu8
1339257787168124928 2020-12-17 01:15:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 Like I said they are. Just because you assume payment would be in cash and exchanged some how doesn’t mean they aren’t paying for it.   I know simpletons struggle with these concepts.
1339257318634971137 2020-12-17 01:13:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This sh*t always happens in Democrat run cities. How frightening.   https://t.co/ycWXs12syc
1339256409427341313 2020-12-17 01:09:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Would she be ok w/ a man raping her child &amp; setting her on fire? How about a white supremacist that dragged a black man behind their vehicle until he was ripped apart? Those ppl don’t deserve death? Because those are the type of ppl this pos is defending.
1339255239753441282 2020-12-17 01:05:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 Yes, yes it is. You think an exchange of cash was required? Countries don’t exchange cash like that.   Unless you’re Obama and put it on a plane to give to Iran.
1339254744213147649 2020-12-17 01:03:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 So if you don’t understand these simple concepts that’s not my fault.   Ex: I give you $20 you use that $20 to buy yourself lunch. Did you pay for it or did I?
1339254353291460610 2020-12-17 01:01:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 Here’s the difference you claim Mexico isn’t paying for the wall right? They are when the Mexican government is using their military forces that they pay to prevent ppl from getting in our country. Also trade deals that make us more money all helps pay for it.
1339253378031910913 2020-12-17 00:57:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 Did you not watch the video of Biden demanding the prosecutor be fired or  Ukraine wouldn’t get the $1B?   That’s called quid pro quo in case you did know.  https://t.co/iC6Su71gqq
1339250990986395648 2020-12-17 00:48:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 What hypocrisy? Yes because the ACA is unconstitutional. You can’t force a tax on someone for not getting something. Which is what democrats did with ACA. So I was glad Trump was attempting to remove and replace if necessary.   The only ppl the ACA really helps is PE patients.
1339249874877906944 2020-12-17 00:43:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> All this to try to keep their failing careers alive because without Trump they are literally nothing.
1339249187947352064 2020-12-17 00:41:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 Biden paid off Ukraine in a live interview so his son wouldn’t be prosecuted by their government.   Wonder how much Swalwell gave to keep that Chinese spy quiet not to mention the Biden’s. 😂
1339248513843007488 2020-12-17 00:38:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 I’m perfectly ok with paying for a wall that protects our country and helps our CBP.   Trump hasn’t removed pre-existing conditions and mentioned any plan he had would include it.   Seems you don’t think for yourself and research much.
1339242239319371776 2020-12-17 00:13:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 Awww you poor thing. Tell me when Biden ever kept a promise he’s made or any democrat for that matter.   FYI if he does follow thru on “getting rid of Trump tax cuts” and you make less than $400k you will be impacted.
1339240266671144960 2020-12-17 00:05:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion You have no idea how angry that made me. I had a step aunt who was downs was never sent to a group home. She was the best aunt she played with me and my sister whenever we visited no matter the time of day, she made time for us.
1339239096120590338 2020-12-17 00:00:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Mitch about to lose his Leadership position. Hope it was worth it @senatemajldr
1339237924643074049 2020-12-16 23:56:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can anyone remind me when ONLY the ppl who make $400k+ a year got taxed by the government in the US?
1339237336320593920 2020-12-16 23:53:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left turning to Republicans to validate Joe Biden winning is fkin hilarious. They seem to think we care what they think. Looks like Republicans want to lose Georgia.    https://t.co/iVYxeEa1pt
1339237206959902722 2020-12-16 23:53:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Some people are pure sh*t.
1339098886573445121 2020-12-16 14:43:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s be honest he knew he wasn’t gonna get any work from MSNBC as a Republican pundit anymore so he decided to turn his back on our republic like the grifter pos he is.   Another RINO pos trash person gone.  https://t.co/PxqpwnVwxk
1339092455778488322 2020-12-16 14:18:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird 92% of blacks voted for Hillary in 2016 and she lost while y’all screamed not my president and impeach on day one. You must be ignorant af and in a cult by your rules I guess. 😂
1339077293025554434 2020-12-16 13:18:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Since when are black people not considered Americans?
1339076985218244608 2020-12-16 13:16:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sounds like he’s trying to defend his win. #NotMyPresident
1339075902248914944 2020-12-16 13:12:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PamelaWwg1wga Oh I know. I work at a hospital.
1339072997659799554 2020-12-16 13:00:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> COVID is slamming hospitals so bad that they’ve started to have choreographed dances again on Tik Tok. 🙄
1339072635158720513 2020-12-16 12:59:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Pay close attention to how these ppl lie.. “was hired by GOP activist’s group” to “by a group who’s CEO is a GOP activist.   These ppl have an issue with ppl being GOP activists but had no problem with an activist like RBG being on the bench.  https://t.co/sItwgLf3gl
1339070550635769856 2020-12-16 12:51:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You should apologize Jessica.. my hospital is getting it by Thursday thats Dec 17th.
1339067722936668160 2020-12-16 12:39:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Preach..
1339067422393790464 2020-12-16 12:38:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fact check: False
1339065583321563137 2020-12-16 12:31:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 Clymer is a pos if the highest order.
1339065492552617984 2020-12-16 12:31:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @StormWall82 Nope. Imagine that? No way we have time to choreograph when we are dead tired after our shifts either.
1339065201753116675 2020-12-16 12:29:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These type of ppl are now going to be in charge of our government. 😩
1339064779973877760 2020-12-16 12:28:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Busy hospitals and their staff don’t have time for this kind of bs. We barely find time to have lunch.
1339061404607770624 2020-12-16 12:14:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We don’t give af what you said. You have a long history of doing the opposite of what you’ve promised swamp rat!
1339060427137814529 2020-12-16 12:10:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian The biggest pos if you go searching for what Clymer was accused of before deciding to be trans.
1339060121578524674 2020-12-16 12:09:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RygbiAmByth @LadyMetal1 @VagrantDude You can identify as a ketchup bottle that doesn’t make you one.
1339059777662459906 2020-12-16 12:08:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 It’s a parody acct thank God.
1339059660490330112 2020-12-16 12:07:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Oh thank God it’s a stupid parody. You have no idea how disgusted I was.   I wouldn’t put it past Joe Biden.
1339058845998436352 2020-12-16 12:04:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Cringe af..  https://t.co/HvjQDYlpd4
1339058082605748224 2020-12-16 12:01:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheMSMaquis Clymer is a misogynist pig that decided was trans to gain some oppression points.
1339057681705791490 2020-12-16 12:00:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If sex work *IS* work then she should be TAXED for that work just like the rest of us are.
1339057036688953344 2020-12-16 11:57:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This all kinds of sad..
1339002045936779266 2020-12-16 08:18:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoshD0110 Is that the douche canoe that got your video/tweet removed for “violating the twitter rules”?
1338995687128616960 2020-12-16 07:53:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Juvat320 @triton6346 I copied it from someone else. They said it violated the twitter rules. For what I have no idea. I got it from @JoshD0110
1338994803019640833 2020-12-16 07:50:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh so now you need Putin to validate Joe Biden’s win? The fkin irony of these Democratic clowns.
1338975275845992449 2020-12-16 06:32:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BallsKraken @RobinSueWho @CNN Oh I don’t watch. I just watch these clips on twitter. I’d pull my hair out if I watched them live. At this point I watch ZERO news on tv. I trust Bongino and Tim Pool more than ppl on the MSM.
1338935997862580225 2020-12-16 03:56:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BallsKraken @RobinSueWho @CNN It’s good to know how these hacks are brainwashing ppl with their lies.
1338932936972795904 2020-12-16 03:44:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wouldn’t respond to hack journalists who yell out questions then write in their diaries crying how they don’t get called on. Bravo @PressSec
1338932630050377729 2020-12-16 03:43:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But never COVID? Yea ummm ok.
1338932388353638402 2020-12-16 03:42:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dusm1811 You should try it. 😂

1338931388553129985 2020-12-16 03:38:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @usa22018 Don’t you start. 😂 Why do women always have to deal with the most bs?
1338925583745634305 2020-12-16 03:15:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheMSMaquis He’s showing the peasants how riding a subway is done.
1338925095914360832 2020-12-16 03:13:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess a vaccine doesn’t work without a mask now. 😂 The left just wants control. They don’t give af about you.
1338923041678495744 2020-12-16 03:05:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> DeFkface is closing outdoor dining  but saying subways are safe because the city and state need you to pay their tolls and fare to keep their government asses employed but not the rest of you tho.
1338922334393004034 2020-12-16 03:02:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian It’s all about the pets.
1338912191622201346 2020-12-16 02:21:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How can anyone still watch @CNN when all they do is fling shit at you daily like the chimps they are?  https://t.co/ZBVqOSnUje

1338724065465397248 2020-12-15 13:54:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How did Barr lie about the Mueller Report or any of the shit you listed? The report was released and read by democrats multiple times because obviously their voters can’t read it for themselves. Absentee ballots are used for fraud you ignorant beotch.
1338721794191028224 2020-12-15 13:45:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @infobee Yea I wouldn’t be able to hold back my laughter and my vagina would be as dry as the Sahara.   That’s just not normal or he needs to find a gf with the same kink. I’m sure they are out there.

1338702058875047936 2020-12-15 12:26:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This guy must have gone to the Joe Biden School of mad burns.

1338696386410283008 2020-12-15 12:04:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DebraMessing is a sad sad individual. Her hate is why Will &amp; Grace stopped being funny.
1338696056926732289 2020-12-15 12:03:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m not gonna lie some of you get follows just because your pets are cute and in your avi.
1338693488662102017 2020-12-15 11:52:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden is not capable of owning anyone with comebacks like “dog face pony soldier” “c’mon man”.

1338685270141534209 2020-12-15 11:20:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder what all these leftist Trump alts are gonna do with themselves if Biden is actually inaugurated.   They don’t even realize how they still lose. 😂
1338684421868642304 2020-12-15 11:16:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are people still trying to convince me that this guy (see image 1 &amp; 2) got more votes than Obama and Trump with just 21.2M followers on this leftist cesspool of a site?  https://t.co/ZO1oI3ejjL

1338679601665515522 2020-12-15 10:57:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “While China's economy has boomed over the past few decades, poverty has not disappeared, with the National Bureau of Statistics saying that in 2017 there were 30.46 million rural people still living below the national poverty line of $1.90 a day.”   *smh*
1338679396874391552 2020-12-15 10:56:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier Lol no idea, but that was something.
1338679166460329985 2020-12-15 10:55:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When the poor in America think they have it bad they should really be glad they aren’t poor in China. While commies in the US praise them.   “Admitted to hospital with breathing problems in October 2019”? 🤔  https://t.co/iCyi8QjM3c
1338678328136400896 2020-12-15 10:52:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier It’s dated 5/3/2018.
1338677032108978176 2020-12-15 10:47:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier I have no idea, but I can’t unsee it. I’ve watched it several times to see if I catch something that shows it’s fake. Nope.
1338676554398777344 2020-12-15 10:45:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @triton6346 Dude disintegrated. Bits are all that was left.
1338675108982915073 2020-12-15 10:39:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That was fast.. 😳  https://t.co/kBe0mxQiad

1338663149315112960 2020-12-15 09:52:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The fact Biden got 302 is disgusting.
1338624053905539073 2020-12-15 07:16:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShaynaCher @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump See where it says “expected”? Lol
1338616033368653825 2020-12-15 06:45:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Other ppl are saying those were Republican electors there to cast votes. I’m so confused with reporting today. Doesn’t help I’m at work.
1338614966618755072 2020-12-15 06:40:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Women and girls don’t need you to be celebrated.
1338614552938774528 2020-12-15 06:39:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker What do you mean electors don’t belong there to cast their votes?   Is it the wrong location?
1338591603523342336 2020-12-15 05:08:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jason_9905 Yes sir I did. Like?

1338564886188552192 2020-12-15 03:21:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder how much the pneumonia, respiratory issues and heart attack deaths decreased during COVID?
1338551263521165312 2020-12-15 02:27:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But remember we should be scare of white supremacist groups and proud boys. 🙄 Fkin about time.

1338388776586944513 2020-12-14 15:42:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Obama is stuntin. He’s only 59. 😂
1338382866778976259 2020-12-14 15:18:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can you tell me why Obama, Bush and Clinton offered to take in on live TV when it’s only for “high risk” individuals or is that different?  https://t.co/MzISeo0Lvf
1338380560419356672 2020-12-14 15:09:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RocinanteX88 So her nose fell off and she also has duck lips?  https://t.co/R4llrAlKBX

1338368980025655296 2020-12-14 14:23:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Pardon @Snowden and Julian Assange @realDonaldTrump!
1338367507334266880 2020-12-14 14:17:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We don’t like your wrinkly old demented ass when are you gonna get that?   Remember when these fkers said it would only be 4 weeks. That has turned into 10 months for law abiding Americans but not for leftists. Fk you.
1338365393920872448 2020-12-14 14:09:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LizzerMack Oh I hate the cake batter donuts.
1338363569583243264 2020-12-14 14:01:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KatM50 @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 @LLinWood @tracybeanz 5M+ of those 7M were from California alone. This is why we are a republic NOT a democracy.
1338359733359501313 2020-12-14 13:46:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk Yes I have a small “penis”, it’s called a clitoris and has more nerve endings than your dick. 😂
1338357522252500992 2020-12-14 13:37:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun Like a peanut butter and jelly filled donut?
1338355101694533633 2020-12-14 13:28:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What is your favorite type of DONUT? Mine is..   Raspberry filled. 😋  https://t.co/hXNZ2yHo1a
1338353579359227904 2020-12-14 13:22:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Funny these ppl always “demand” a statement from Trump during our peaceful protests yet they stay silent when it comes to ANTIFA STABBING Trump supporters.  https://t.co/y6jloU088b
1338352841711255557 2020-12-14 13:19:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Proof they will try to take away ppl’s freedoms based on “science”.
1338349567025106944 2020-12-14 13:06:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This beotch trying to stay relevant.
1338335303623352323 2020-12-14 12:09:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @reggiewalle27 It’s not a nickname. It’s the team name.   A nickname is like the Cleveland Browns being called the Brownies.
1338335033849905152 2020-12-14 12:08:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrokenSparrow5 Cleveland Colonizers? 😂
1338334481724293121 2020-12-14 12:06:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @reggiewalle27 Haha omg. “A black white supremacist”? 🤣 The leftist mind is fked up beyond repair.
1338334118505897985 2020-12-14 12:04:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @reggiewalle27 Actually I don’t think teams should sucumbe to gits who find offense over everything.   White virtue signaling leftists are the worst.    https://t.co/rHS9M35T9Q
1338332325394800640 2020-12-14 11:57:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @reggiewalle27 You said it was a nickname not me.   If you turds could handle life without being triggered about every gd thing maybe teams names could just be left tf alone.
1338331892303589377 2020-12-14 11:56:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @reggiewalle27 Do you think it’s just random that they decided to change it?   It’s the fkin left crying about every gd thing and threatening ppl while calling them racists.   FYI INDIAN isn’t a fkin race either.
1338331296007741440 2020-12-14 11:53:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @reggiewalle27 If it’s just a nickname why does it need to change? Maybe you turds need to get over it.
1338330443775545345 2020-12-14 11:50:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left truly ruins everything. Even Indians getting recognized by sports teams. Guess they should change their name to the Cleveland Pilgrims.
1338326501398204418 2020-12-14 11:34:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I find it funny the “free the nipple” “stop sexualizing women’s bodies” crew who encourage nakedness have a problem with NUDE MODELING.
1338258871207436293 2020-12-14 07:05:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Girls drive big trucks too.. you sexist pig.  https://t.co/PhEHyfEflE
1338257678179606531 2020-12-14 07:01:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What a sh*thole.. and @tedwheeler does NOTHING *smh* I thought walls and barriers were racist?
1338153648346419201 2020-12-14 00:07:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HappyManor Imagine demanding “peaceful protests” from ppl the left attacked and stabbed with knives just because they were Trump supporters?   These ppl can all eat a bag full of fried asshoes.
1338152365807943681 2020-12-14 00:02:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SmexyGhosty What have you said? 😂
1338151628365471745 2020-12-13 23:59:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Didn’t you ppl claim deploying the national guard was like sending out the gestapo? Now you’re demanding it? 😂  https://t.co/cfI0XoycFP
1338151177834250242 2020-12-13 23:57:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Remember y’all want to defund the police and have also said sending the National Guard is like sending out the gestapo?   I don’t see any buildings being set on fire, looted or vandalized like the left did with their “protests”. 🖕🏼
1338150003307466753 2020-12-13 23:53:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s not why you liar.. as you can see in the video they flipped the Trump supporters off. Plus it’s DC. It’s infested with leftists.   I dont recall you tits complaining when Pantifa and BLM were doing the same to innocent ppl just trying to get somewhere.  https://t.co/osOrBckd5W
1338037840647577602 2020-12-13 16:27:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @televiseanarchy How are they living rent free in my head when I have no clue who tf you’re talking about? 😂
1338036575364517888 2020-12-13 16:22:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left are the fascists. Nazis made lists of their enemies too.  https://t.co/wdP4Vc7UOp
1338035799917383680 2020-12-13 16:19:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha.. As if Conservatives haven’t been doing that while the left allows their cities to burn.
1338034888633532418 2020-12-13 16:15:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @televiseanarchy Sorry leftist we aren’t you.
1338034671188234240 2020-12-13 16:14:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Everything is racist to the left except actual racism they express on the regular.   Like: You ain’t black if you don’t vote how I a white man wants you to! Only POC are poor and need welfare!
1338033403656982528 2020-12-13 16:09:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can you tell me why you are only reporting on the Proud Boys and Trump supporters as if Pantifa agitators weren’t there?
1338032578205401089 2020-12-13 16:06:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShelbyTalcott Yep a Pantifa militant in black block  https://t.co/WOOyfGIJGc
1338032173060747265 2020-12-13 16:05:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If Pantifa can burn our US flag.. Proud Boys can torch a BLM banner.
1337923176328654848 2020-12-13 08:51:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 @realDonaldTrump Actually Trump accomplishes things it’s why the establishment hates him so much. Biden will up your taxes and still be making money from CCP on the back end.   I wonder if he’ll donate his salary like Trump did?
1337922094688993280 2020-12-13 08:47:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl @BrettBaker Yes you do. 😘
1337922035238936577 2020-12-13 08:47:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 @realDonaldTrump Was it tho? Don’t worry when you cry because Biden hasn’t done the shit he promised he’d do we’ll be here to remind you #sucker.

1337919310115655681 2020-12-13 08:36:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrettBaker @hyacinthgrrl Followed back based on cleverness.
1337910153006391297 2020-12-13 08:00:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But the left constantly tells us they aren’t violent? Now they have ppl scared to wear what they want? Fk ‘em defend yourselves.  https://t.co/KML6uvoehe
1337888756704059398 2020-12-13 06:35:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrettBaker @hyacinthgrrl Is this really how you want to start our new relationship?
1337888634767175680 2020-12-13 06:34:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @csydelko @_RadicalReality Why would you hate WHITE Christians in particular? Do you think non-white Christians with the same beliefs aren’t hate worthy?   I’ll have your WHOLE ass know that I’m Latina and a Trump supporter so what now you ignorant heifer?
1337887123395907584 2020-12-13 06:28:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SmexyGhosty “Behavior that might violate the twitter rules”   And you get a 12hr?!

1337792374144057344 2020-12-13 00:12:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is why RINOS in particular are garbage. The left doesn’t even like you. They just liked the fact you hated Trump with them. Good luck having a job now that your hate isn’t needed to push their narrative.
1337791178889052164 2020-12-13 00:07:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tom_3_point_oh 😂🤣😂 Remember when ppl would ask to be in your top 10?
1337790422697930758 2020-12-13 00:04:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now it’s ok to let ppl know how fkin corrupt the Biden’s are?   https://t.co/0ZWuwcYe25

1337786971968602112 2020-12-12 23:50:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @triton6346 Well you know leftists don’t like to give ppl much of a choice. We would gladly take in patriots from all over.
1337784022185910274 2020-12-12 23:39:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 Oh we could easily take it over. Plus we’d cut off illegals and North California would have to fly them in instead.
1337782383337082886 2020-12-12 23:32:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We can build autonomous zones too. Remember all those RED states you claimed you didn’t need or cared about?   United States of Shit will be owned by China while we live free.  https://t.co/F5jNgmoi5q
1337678275489886211 2020-12-12 16:38:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 Canadians. 😂
1337677486482550784 2020-12-12 16:35:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> TalcumX calling out Joe Biden (which he likely voted for) knowing he “built” the crime bill. #SUCKER   FYI you voting for Biden doesn’t make you black either.
1337675409404522496 2020-12-12 16:27:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> There will be no trust in the government by me as long as you swamp rats are in charge.

1337668771083776006 2020-12-12 16:01:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Just as a reminder to leftists you will NEVER get a public display like this from us losing an election. E V E R!  https://t.co/40x8oZOYro
1337667598108901379 2020-12-12 15:56:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sorry the only ppl who cry over election losses are leftists.  https://t.co/UrFk8aaCwV
1337666648929529857 2020-12-12 15:52:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TraitorsNot Trump doesn’t play pretend unlike the left.
1337666421455646724 2020-12-12 15:51:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Was there a problem when ppl in California suggested seceding over Trump winning or naw?  https://t.co/UkpzLiMppj
1337665110844661760 2020-12-12 15:46:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian @RepSwalwell Dile a ese cabron.
1337663949701967873 2020-12-12 15:41:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The Chinese are determined to eat every animal into extinction.
1337663575943389189 2020-12-12 15:40:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Failure to comply could have consequences. He doesn’t want to be put on a “list”.
1337662637270679558 2020-12-12 15:36:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wouldn’t talk to the #EnemyOfThePeople CCP pawns either.  https://t.co/YuS6rfqUQz
1337661800154742784 2020-12-12 15:33:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Vote..
1337660450314469377 2020-12-12 15:27:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #EnemyOfThePeople
1337659451877150725 2020-12-12 15:24:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Mary Trump the woman who’d sue and secretly record her own family for money has something to say.
1337658562676310016 2020-12-12 15:20:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who knew?
1337655729440739328 2020-12-12 15:09:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You know what’s a hoax? You calling yourself a Republican to get elected.
1337655394747891713 2020-12-12 15:07:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lame.
1337655054598332422 2020-12-12 15:06:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They always protect their crimes onto others. Chinese spy fker.
1337653367665922048 2020-12-12 14:59:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #EnemyOfThePeople are responsible.  https://t.co/mP2Ao7YmyU
1337652321023451137 2020-12-12 14:55:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They didn’t actually, they did what the people who put them in office expected them to do.   Unlike democrats who give a shit what their voters want.
1337651620058841089 2020-12-12 14:52:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Just proves how much the media lied to ppl about the SCOTUSes Trump chose. #Karma eventually happens.
1337651000962736130 2020-12-12 14:50:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Clowns like this guy don’t exist without someone like Trump to hate. Trump was literally their goose who laid the golden egg. When that’s gone that will be delicious.   Ppl like this become irrelevant so easily.
1337644181037039617 2020-12-12 14:23:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh so NOW this matters? We’ve known about Hunter’s dealings in Ukraine for months now.   Congratulations on actually electing a criminal family bought by foreigners.
1337643357946843142 2020-12-12 14:20:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Sodangfancy100 I’m thinking it’s probably a good thing she blocked me.  https://t.co/mFOHxrWddT
1337642004184879107 2020-12-12 14:14:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How can you build trust in a vaccine that the left claimed couldn’t be trusted because it was created under Trump? Then you have anti-vaxxers and Trump supporters who don’t trust the government even more now.
1337637554175164417 2020-12-12 13:56:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m calling bullshit.
1337625807963914241 2020-12-12 13:10:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It could be.. probably means he can’t be president.
1337625526660333568 2020-12-12 13:09:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @StormWall82 We won’t live with the leftists. We will watch them take each other out from a distance in our own CONSTITUTIONAL ZONES.
1337623858627538945 2020-12-12 13:02:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wouldn’t that be wonderful? Plus we could watch the blue cities destroy themselves from the sidelines in lawn chairs.
1337622025209147394 2020-12-12 12:55:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ChrisAlcala88 @JaredoTexas Dead
1337614077095342081 2020-12-12 12:23:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r Awww thx. ♥️🎄 I was feeling festive.
1337613892411744258 2020-12-12 12:22:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aoki_mnz @axiermundi Nope I’m chillin. Your friend might be tho.
1337613768520392711 2020-12-12 12:22:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JaredoTexas I can’t help it.
1337604555442294787 2020-12-12 11:45:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tulsi c’mon the left doesn’t understand equality although they claim it’s what they want.
1337604311438688257 2020-12-12 11:44:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You need to be removed from the speaker position. You played politics with ppls lives you miserable beotch.
1337603784277553155 2020-12-12 11:42:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r I try to help these ppl.   They think calling me a BITCH matters when I literally have it listed as one of my pronouns in my bio. 😂
1337603301919997955 2020-12-12 11:40:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi Your rage in this exchange is more than evident.   While I’m literally laughing at you.
1337602720656629760 2020-12-12 11:38:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi If you think me saying I should have known better than to try to have a convo with someone who has their pronouns in their bio. Means I’m triggered then you have no clue what triggered is either.
1337601954344652802 2020-12-12 11:35:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RaeOfHope808 I think because I’m not even upset while this individual is like..  https://t.co/bI1ZciwqXx
1337601509488357376 2020-12-12 11:33:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi Clearly it was too difficult for you to do.   What are you even saying? I say the left can’t meme and you get triggered? 😂 Imagine being that basic.
1337600412447207425 2020-12-12 11:29:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Poor thing can’t even get quotes right. Copy paste, Copy paste.
1337599912981098497 2020-12-12 11:27:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Omgiamonfire @axiermundi I know it’s difficult question for some.
1337599477163544577 2020-12-12 11:25:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @StormWall82 Lmaoo.
1337599374252253184 2020-12-12 11:25:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Clearly the question was too difficult for you..   Imagine thinking YOU could in any way educate me. 😂 Children are so cute.
1337597511238705153 2020-12-12 11:17:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @StormWall82 You’re probably not wrong in this case. You’d figure they’d be happier with cartoons being 99.9% of their whole existence.
1337597111534174208 2020-12-12 11:16:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi I never said being a cervix haver was memeing. 😂 I don’t think you know what ironic means.   Do you know what a cervix is?
1337596864875487232 2020-12-12 11:15:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Gorgeous.
1337596774760894465 2020-12-12 11:14:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s not what happened you pos.
1337596573631488002 2020-12-12 11:14:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi Thanks for the retweet. ☺️
1337596492547149825 2020-12-12 11:13:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Awww THEY sound upset. 🤣
1337590813514067969 2020-12-12 10:51:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola Awww thanks soul sista 😘
1337590603907907584 2020-12-12 10:50:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DarthAssassinOG @axiermundi Why do you think I added it in my bio? 😂 I expect it.
1337590221399941121 2020-12-12 10:48:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Everyone will finally see who the problem is when you have no more villain to blame. Be careful what you wish for.
1337589671317000192 2020-12-12 10:46:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is why the left can’t meme.
1337589155274973184 2020-12-12 10:44:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi Unless you think QUEEN and BITCH are pronouns like Zee/Zir. 😂
1337588109249114112 2020-12-12 10:40:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Says Supreme Dunce in Congress.
1337587524248641537 2020-12-12 10:38:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If ppl don’t think this is a problem they should.  https://t.co/x6cmBvmoEN
1337586325642342400 2020-12-12 10:33:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot True he’s not very attractive has to get it where he can. I wonder what his wife thinks while he spent all this time talking about Trump and women.   These ppl project all the time.
1337585722539257857 2020-12-12 10:31:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThatBearUKnow This isn’t about Trump although the left tries to claim it is.
1337585458553864193 2020-12-12 10:29:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @caletvwlrh @axiermundi What does it explain?
1337585320569663488 2020-12-12 10:29:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi And mocking having pronouns in your bio is quite different than actually having he/him in your bio. 😂  That’s clearly lost on you folks as well.
1337584957695217666 2020-12-12 10:27:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axiermundi Yep that’s me.
1337584865189851137 2020-12-12 10:27:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What ppl like you don’t seem to understand is that it wasn’t a 9-0 vote against Trump it was against 74M Americans.
1337584304587636736 2020-12-12 10:25:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You bedded a Chinese spy to give them access to your government you should probably stfu right now.
1337566516544380928 2020-12-12 09:14:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Danielle33384 Why am I not surprised?
1337564355831816193 2020-12-12 09:06:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you think this is ok for you to say?
1337560997037391872 2020-12-12 08:52:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier And LA JUDGES are rejecting outdoor dining lockdowns in CA.   Little things like that give me hope.
1337560821317046275 2020-12-12 08:52:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier We can’t think that way. Trump won in 2016. It’s very possible ppl who voted for Beijing Biden will come to realize the mistake they made.   Karma will take care of it. We just have to keep doing what we are doing. Remember 74M Americans voted for Trump we don’t go away.
1337556978835439616 2020-12-12 08:36:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian It’s a reface.
1337556886468509697 2020-12-12 08:36:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier Yea, but it’s all we can hope for. Who’s to say we can’t win the house back in 2022?   China will control our country because the media decides to be a political arm for the democrats.   Good luck to them. Their viewership will be nonexistent.
1337555849435205633 2020-12-12 08:32:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Next up win in Georgia and pass legislation to make sure VOTER ID is required at the federal level.
1337555014273789953 2020-12-12 08:29:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Haha I know. El pepino.
1337554913673428993 2020-12-12 08:28:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck It’s unfortunate, but maybe it’s what needed to happen.   Good luck to blue cities who think that a Biden win somehow stops the riots and Autonomous zones from popping up there.   There should be a way to make sure these voters aren’t allowed to move and destroy other places.
1337554065966809093 2020-12-12 08:25:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SmexyGhosty Goodness. Yea I don’t feel sorry for these ppl they are on death row for a reason.
1337553792896704513 2020-12-12 08:24:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well there you have it.
1337526744627048450 2020-12-12 06:36:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They really do believe black people are a monolith don’t they?
1337526464619528193 2020-12-12 06:35:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We need the proof/evidence.
1337526219458265094 2020-12-12 06:34:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JanKWV @MorriseyWV @realDonaldTrump Why couldn’t you go drop off your ballot while social distancing and wearing a mask?
1337525886103375873 2020-12-12 06:33:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 I could totally live in the OC.
1337525354244624384 2020-12-12 06:31:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TwitniqsMK2 @onewalleee Oh I’m so sorry. 🙏🏼 Pets are truly like family.
1337524579552522240 2020-12-12 06:28:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 Maybe it’s closer to you than me. 😂
1337523222007279617 2020-12-12 06:22:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Where’s NEW CALIFORNIA so I can move there?
1337522545617080320 2020-12-12 06:19:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Some ppl never listen.

1337502775727419392 2020-12-12 05:01:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Antifa is a myth with guns.
1337501348649029633 2020-12-12 04:55:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now we release TERRORIST HENCHMEN free in the US a month early because they are too fat for prison? These are the same ppl who tell us “FAT IS BEAUTIFUL”. 🙄
1337500762499215360 2020-12-12 04:53:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mickyboy1738 @nypost Did he tho? He set a couple on fire one that was not dead from the gun shot she took to the head before they did it.

1337486273242488833 2020-12-12 03:55:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M Lol they can’t even pronounce it? *smh*
1337485826289094656 2020-12-12 03:54:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Latinx is a slur, pass it on
1337485269746905088 2020-12-12 03:51:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian It looks soooooooo sweet. I love pecans.
1337484898861342720 2020-12-12 03:50:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks delicious. Is that cake or pie?

1337483109495783425 2020-12-12 03:43:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left will try take credit for it I’m sure.
1337482019517784064 2020-12-12 03:38:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster It’s simple really, she hates Trump therefore projects her hate onto Ivanka (a woman) who needs to pay for daring to get a haircut.
1337481077015814146 2020-12-12 03:35:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NotAviatorsBo I’m absolutely mortified. I have no words for this abomination.

1337478601004838912 2020-12-12 03:25:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They do if that state violated the constitution.
1337478429025812481 2020-12-12 03:24:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They go after their political opponents with fake “whistleblowers” that need to be protected and anonymous unless they are on the right.

1337465732121018368 2020-12-12 02:34:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So Biden keeps appointing open border trash to his cabinet?  https://t.co/HXj1VASk4j
1337465541611548672 2020-12-12 02:33:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If the left can’t meme what made you think they’d be funnier in their replies? Oh and I like this pic of you best. I never realized you have green/hazel eyes.  https://t.co/aPdmS0ZTf3
1337465086949015552 2020-12-12 02:31:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They are pushing this now as trending because they want ppl to think this is about Texas. It’s not.  https://t.co/yzgugoZr0T
1337464441785335809 2020-12-12 02:29:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These libturds just make up new terms everyday. You aren’t poor and being prevented from making a living because of COVID you’re just dealing with “food apartheid”. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1337462971669258240 2020-12-12 02:23:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen I should have known better than try to have an intelligent discussion with a “fanboy” who puts his pronouns in his bio.. I tried.  https://t.co/bAmaNB1fqR
1337462544592596993 2020-12-12 02:21:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Imagine thinking insulting someone you don’t know at all personally while having a discussion gets you anywhere.   It’s fine I’m not the angry one. I just want fairness. I get you don’t care about that because the shoe isn’t on the other foot. Good luck.
1337461790012149760 2020-12-12 02:18:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen I do want a full audit, but that audit doesn’t mean I expect to get a certain outcome. That audit is to make ppl NOT feel disenfranchised. I can hope for a certain outcome that doesn’t mean that will happen.
1337461227857932289 2020-12-12 02:16:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen What did I ask for? An audit? Where does asking for an audit mean I expect Trump to win?   I don’t think any fking where. So again you assume a lot.
1337460793076449280 2020-12-12 02:14:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Wanting a full audit doesn’t mean I expect Trump to win. I want the audit so ppl don’t feel disenfranchised.   The left constantly talks about NOT disenfranchising voters yet don’t care when it’s not them or their voters that feel that way.
1337459996234186752 2020-12-12 02:11:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen And how do you know what I’m asking for?   Oh that’s right YOU’RE assuming. 🙄
1337459321840406528 2020-12-12 02:08:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen You assume a lot about ppl you disagree with politically.   I really don’t care about Gore or Bush. This is 2020 and lines have been drawn. The only intolerant ones have literally been the left. I should know I was on the left before.
1337458497487654913 2020-12-12 02:05:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen So then why worry? Just let it play itself out. Im sure SCOTUS will explain throughly if they take the case and if and when they give a decision.
1337456714027737089 2020-12-12 01:58:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen A full audit/certification with observers from both sides there would be ideal. Looking at every vote making sure every vote counted.   This way there is no question.   I’d also love to know how many ppl voted but who’s vote is still showing not received.
1337455088537747456 2020-12-12 01:51:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen True, but that floodgate was started by these states when they decided to violate the constitution and not give equal access to parties.   While also claiming Trump voters should be put on lists, humiliated, put in camps and fired from their jobs.
1337454353494339584 2020-12-12 01:49:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen To make ppl of that state feel comfortable with who their electors are being given to? Absolutely.   The states spend millions on lots of other things with no problem. Why not spend it on not disenfranchising those that feel their vote was stolen by cheating?
1337453688357449728 2020-12-12 01:46:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen If another state wants to sue Texas for violations to the constitution they believe happened in Texas they have every right to do that.   That is the rule being equal. No one is stopping other states from suing Texas if they want.
1337453250232999937 2020-12-12 01:44:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen If I was a citizen &amp; voter in one of these states in question I would demand a complete and full audit to make sure every voter in the state feels comfortable with the results of the election and electoral votes going to the one elected by the people. Regardless of who that is.
1337452555232632832 2020-12-12 01:41:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Texas is allowed to sue just like any state if they feel something by another state in the union did something that was unconstitutional.    It’s part of the legal processes allowed to states and people in this country via our constitution. Not sure how you don’t know that.
1337451983595208704 2020-12-12 01:39:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Again I said if that was the response by SCOTUS then those voters should be upset with their state officials.   Unlike you I don’t assume what SCOTUS will decide.   But if “millions of votes” are removed because of it, including my own I’d be upset with my state not SCOTUS.
1337451274808127488 2020-12-12 01:36:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen It doesn’t. I haven’t bought into anything, YOU make assumptions.   I have repeatedly stated we need proof of the voting fraud in large numbers enough to over turn an election.   I also support defense of our constitution, but please continue.
1337450322675945472 2020-12-12 01:33:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen I answered you..  https://t.co/NK4TlQix0v
1337449977635749889 2020-12-12 01:31:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Haha you say “fact” like it actually means something coming from someone like you. 🤣
1337449464093499392 2020-12-12 01:29:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Yes the insults definitely help your case.   Hey you were the one that claimed this case by TX would disenfranchise millions of voters. I never said any of that and stated if that was SCOTUS’s decision they can blame their state Reps.
1337448958663147521 2020-12-12 01:27:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen You can pick up a convo with someone else on this topic and maybe next time as a suggestion you can have an equal, fair &amp; reciprocal exchange if you can answer simple questions to show your willingness to have a fair and equal discussion. ✌🏼
1337448173946634241 2020-12-12 01:24:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Like I said before you made that choice after I said I wasn’t going to answer yours.   Had you been willing to answer my question initially then we could have had a decent and fair exchange.   You proved you couldn’t do that.
1337447468045221888 2020-12-12 01:21:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Wait I thought it was about “disenfranchising millions of votes”?
1337447231834583040 2020-12-12 01:20:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Haha too little too late. I thought you knew what the issue was with 77? Clearly you asking that question shows you don’t.
1337446615527743489 2020-12-12 01:18:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Another question you expect ME to answer? Lmaoo you’re funny.
1337446426427604995 2020-12-12 01:17:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen It was a simple question you could even answer. Like I said I’m willing to have a conversation but if you refuse to answer a question why should I have to answer yours?   Oh that’s right you like playing by different rules with no consequences... I don’t. Good luck.
1337446006028345346 2020-12-12 01:15:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Well I guess me asking you a simple question about PA violating the constitution and the fact you couldn’t answer means YOU just don’t know and demonstrate no understanding about this?
1337445433883250690 2020-12-12 01:13:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Being corrected? You haven’t corrected me. You sound angry. There was no need to respond how you did while we were just having a discussion. You choose to say you didn’t give a damn. So I’m choosing not to give a damn back.   I’ll wait on SCOTUS’s decision.
1337444973789073408 2020-12-12 01:11:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen You do sound worried and angry. I don’t really care if you’re tired of hearing it either.
1337444742255153152 2020-12-12 01:10:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Maybe you should have answered my simple question when you had the chance and then I would have gladly answer yours.   But now  https://t.co/3bCasvybj5
1337444119560343553 2020-12-12 01:08:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen I don’t have to answer any question you have when you refused to answer one of mine. 😂 Typical of ppl like you.   Me: Could you answer my question?   You: I don’t give a damn about your question and don’t have to answer it.   Also you: Could you answer my question?   Me:  https://t.co/YtUPEjiKCn
1337442892730695681 2020-12-12 01:03:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Then why do you sound so worried?   If there’s no issue and this lawsuit doesn’t amount to anything why do you sound so concerned and angry?   I’m not concerned I’m just waiting to see what the SCOTUS ruling is.
1337442008776863745 2020-12-12 00:59:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen What other states do you expect them to file in? Should they just toss in some random state that hasn’t violated any laws to make you feel better?   Please tell me which other states did exactly the same thing as these states?
1337440595602677766 2020-12-12 00:54:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen And I don’t give a damn what you think or believe. The info is in the filing.   If any other state including Texas had violated the constitution like PA did I’d expect them to deal with the consequences as well.
1337439991245332480 2020-12-12 00:51:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird same thing Trump voters said in 2016 while y’all screamed #notmypresident 😂
1337437530644336640 2020-12-12 00:42:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen They aren’t filing to overturn the election they are filing that PA violated the constitution during an election. If that overturns an election as a consequence the voters have no one to blame but their own state.
1337437129555681280 2020-12-12 00:40:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Oh so then you aren’t being intellectually honest in this discussion?   Yea that’s what I thought. I didn’t even mention anything about a fkin candidate. I have an issue with PA violating the constitution. Period!
1337436802211147778 2020-12-12 00:39:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen PA did when they lied to them about the law about mail in ballots and using COVID to do it.   I’m only talking about PA. I’m not discussing other states even though other states have joined the lawsuit.   You can argue that it’s only because Trump didn’t win, it’s not.
1337436208507437060 2020-12-12 00:36:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen That’s not the question I asked.   I asked you if YOU believe there should be consequences for violating our constitution?   Actually the response PA gave SCOTUS on 12/8 validates the Texas lawsuit. They basically admitted they violated the US constitution.
1337435095012012032 2020-12-12 00:32:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen That is NOT the basis of the suit. You should probably read it.   The basis is PA chose to change their state law ignoring the constitution. They did this because the legislature is controlled by Republicans.
1337434493402005506 2020-12-12 00:30:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen Do you expect there to be consequences for violating the constitution?   Yes or No?   If you don’t have a problem with it then be prepared for other states to ignore it as well. Avoid dealing with the legislature because they are controlled by the opposing party.
1337431926576013317 2020-12-12 00:19:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kareshy_Zen I agree it’s an unfortunate situation. Voters should be upset with those state representatives and judges who knowingly lied to them about the election &amp; mail in ballot exceptions.   Texas isn’t disenfranchising voters. PA did that when they broke the rules.
1337430735272087552 2020-12-12 00:15:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @conorcolinmom Because they gave the state supreme courts the opportunity to do their due diligence at the state level. They didn’t. So the only recourse now is for the states to sue PA for violating the US constitution.   Cant expect other states to follow the checks &amp; balances when you don’t.
1337429918154571777 2020-12-12 00:11:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> FYI this “Republican” congressman is on his way out of course and feels no loyalty to the people that put him in office.   So he basically disparages those of us who feel there was a huge problem with this election as conspiracy theory.   I wonder how he feels about Hunter?
1337429319639916545 2020-12-12 00:09:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s be very clear. The Texas vs PA lawsuit is about PA violating the US constitution during an election that they basically admitted to while begging SCOTUS not to overturn the election over it.   Breaking the rules SHOULD have consequences. I don’t care what it is.
1337313173339181056 2020-12-11 16:28:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s blatant hate speech? Can anyone give me an example?
1337310282129915910 2020-12-11 16:16:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you’re dumb enough to believe farts are how COVID is transmitted.
1337310080480382980 2020-12-11 16:15:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Shartwell got himself a Chinese spy.
1337309664048939012 2020-12-11 16:14:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> *tested positive and survived..
1337307802709082112 2020-12-11 16:06:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Exactly..can we just go back to those days? Por favor por el amor a Dios!
1337297181137506306 2020-12-11 15:24:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SlimKraken Let me be clear that’s 79% of the 33% who believed this election was not free and fair.
1337296735551406081 2020-12-11 15:22:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SlimKraken Actually... looks like 79% of registered voters believe mail-in ballots led to widespread voter fraud.  https://t.co/fKb2IHSm3z
1337295194165678080 2020-12-11 15:16:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 74M Americans disagree with your claims of “legitimacy” in this election.
1337290553122123776 2020-12-11 14:58:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’ll take things Hitler said for $500 Alex.
1337287145610858498 2020-12-11 14:44:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And they want us to believe mental issues *AREN’T* involved?
1337284394596233216 2020-12-11 14:33:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Changing America’s story”? This swamp creature is the same shit just a different year.
1337274103514873856 2020-12-11 13:52:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I listen to @Timcast’s newest episode and I’ve never heard him so upset.   Our own media literally helped China to try to destroy our country and to make sure Biden would win so they could control him. Treasonous rats! This is why Trump calls them #fakenews and #EnemyOfThePeople
1337250374516805639 2020-12-11 12:18:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea you need to talk to @SpeakerPelosi about withholding money from citizens for political reasons.
1337249736420511750 2020-12-11 12:15:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @isaacappelt @AOC Not if you have irrefutable evidence you should be able to skip all that excess stuff that just makes lawyers richer. Imagine spending $400k on all that and still dying.
1337249191278432258 2020-12-11 12:13:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NumbZombieMom @Nike It’s true. Sometimes truth is uncomfortable. Like having to tell someone they have cancer and 4 months to live that’s not easy.   What would you tell them?
1337248792412745728 2020-12-11 12:12:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @isaacappelt @AOC This will do and it saves money.   Cost - $10   The criminal never killing another person again - priceless  https://t.co/htgRCNOaG5

1337247810475847690 2020-12-11 12:08:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster No idea but I don’t trust it at all.

1337246749107265537 2020-12-11 12:04:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well this got my attention.. this fkin commie declines to press charges against cops? What’s the end game?

1337240088686723080 2020-12-11 11:37:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Poor @CNN look what they’ve come to.
1337235749825986562 2020-12-11 11:20:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TruePatriot2A Yea they sound scared af to me. And I’m loving it.
1337234703179378690 2020-12-11 11:16:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you cheated to win an election that’s not democracy. Also Texas is suing because PA did something unconstitutional and changed laws without checking with the Republican controlled legislature. Checks and balances are an important part of our republic.

1337205346276790272 2020-12-11 09:19:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 Jorge Ramos es un pendejo.
1337205060334362629 2020-12-11 09:18:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SmexyGhosty It’s so white guilty.
1337204941509685249 2020-12-11 09:17:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 I know my shit 😉
1337204584062701568 2020-12-11 09:16:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Series or documents that were made public — but went largely unnoticed” because Twitter &amp; big tech were blocking it from their platforms because they desired a certain outcome for the election.   Now ask yourself why you still voted for Biden while claiming the right was lying?
1337203694912167938 2020-12-11 09:12:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> As a Latina I wholeheartedly agree.

1337201916938309639 2020-12-11 09:05:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheMSMaquis I mean accidents happen where it’s unintentional. This was intentional murder no mercy. Why did it take 20 yrs to come to this conclusion? If there is evidence make it 5 yrs or less.
1337200385182760961 2020-12-11 08:59:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you kidnap a young couple, shoot them in the head and set them of fire  yes that someone should pay with their life.
1337199034193256448 2020-12-11 08:54:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You can thank @SpeakerPelosi for that. She could have had a $1.9T stimulus out over a month ago but she was playing politics.   This is critical and important to those who voted them into office. While left shuts down the country...again.
1337198115623825409 2020-12-11 08:50:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait so what did he do that got him the death penalty in the first place?   Oh.. and Kim’s defense of Bernard is “At just a few months past 18 his brain was still developing”.   Let’s say Brandon had done this to North and her future husband you’d still want him released?  https://t.co/wsXjcWsYLt

1337192448460615680 2020-12-11 08:28:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So basically Biden is giving ppl 2012 all over again? Is this really their strategy? 😂  https://t.co/HUn4gICgFV

1337185786467258368 2020-12-11 08:01:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LostSoul_76 So miserable.
1337185702744768512 2020-12-11 08:01:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TruePatriot2A I agree. I can’t wait to see the final death numbers for 2020.   I’m guessing a decrease in cancer, pneumonia, heart attacks and all top 10 reasons for dying in 2019 while COVID will basically make up those numbers and maybe 10,000 more.
1337184542113742853 2020-12-11 07:56:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That ppl in New York are uppity pigs?
1337184038482628609 2020-12-11 07:54:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> She can’t write a book about “Becoming” a woman, she’s been one all her life.
1337183440769146880 2020-12-11 07:52:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let me make a correction: the US does have a higher rate than “most EU countries”. But not higher than Italy I checked that.   I wonder how many of these predominately white countries in the EU have immigrants invading? I mean even the UK doesn’t give recovery numbers.  https://t.co/zQ5CeBSduf
1337182145983381505 2020-12-11 07:47:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s a lie. Our death rate has continued to decrease and is lower than most EU countries.. US is at 3% while places like Italy are at 6%.   Need I remind Amy countries in the EU are majority WHITE or is that racist?  https://t.co/UXq7qbRr3E
1337180756771102721 2020-12-11 07:41:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait I thought he was making all this money from being president?
1337180321142304768 2020-12-11 07:40:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 None for the left to consider her.
1337180008020803584 2020-12-11 07:38:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yup if the left allows that history to be printed. Might as well write in a journal and save images to make sure the truth gets out eventually.
1337179590557454342 2020-12-11 07:37:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So they are “honey traps” when Dems fall for them but “prostitutes/hookers” when they are around Republicans/Trump supporters?   See how that works?  https://t.co/OCCPg134QY
1337177695940083712 2020-12-11 07:29:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrunusCutis Not to me...plus I’m not even sure he’s not actively portraying “traditional masculinity” in that turtle neck and blazer. How dare he it’s a disease!!!  https://t.co/AbGAuZ1nVg

1337175842087059456 2020-12-11 07:22:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Corrido: is a popular narrative metrical tale &amp; poetry that forms a ballad. The songs are often about oppression, history, daily life for criminals &amp; other socially relevant topics. It is still a popular form today in Mexico &amp; was widely popular during the Mexican Revolution.  https://t.co/AdZalglWz5
1337174110267342849 2020-12-11 07:15:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RuPaulsDragRace should have never caved to this. His show is about the artistry of DRAG it’s a character that men play, it’s not who they are. Are they trying to say that DRAG is no different than being TRANS now? RuPaul and Laverne Cox are NOT the same!

1337164542401421313 2020-12-11 06:37:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats played politics &amp; denied ppl relief while they continued to push for shutdowns because Trump was president.   You didn’t “warn” about this you basically said we should give into lawlessness because ppl would do this.
1337163462347116544 2020-12-11 06:33:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JBAmericanPNW Oh you saw that too? 😂 She could have covered it with her top but obviously exposing it was more important.

You know they’ve existed long before 2020 right?

Pay close attention to how you are controlled by language. At first it was ELECTION FRAUD is a myth doesn’t happen.   To ELECTION FRAUD isn’t systemic or widespread.   Because the media knows it happens.

1337112971898568704 2020-12-11 03:12:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SmexyGhosty Omg I love your Boston accent!
1337112122329722880 2020-12-11 03:09:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @C3Rebecca @Hung_Hippo Awww I feel honored. You’re awesome Rebecca!!  https://t.co/pDG0vBe3CM
1337111565439361027 2020-12-11 03:06:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M Omg.
1337111503074328581 2020-12-11 03:06:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whole_9_meters Oh I’m judging.  https://t.co/NPKu8p2bUG
1337109686592540672 2020-12-11 02:59:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M No worries. I will answer truthfully if I know for a fact. I just don’t know.   But we get a lot of undocumented ppl and it doesn’t matter to our government the kind of money we put out for them instead of our own ppl.
1337108336286691328 2020-12-11 02:54:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M I don’t know to be honest since that’s not part of my job to ask.   But I wouldn’t doubt that at least 60% of them were illegal or undocumented.   In CA they get full coverage under Medi-cal now tho and ppl still wonder why illegals come here.
1337107749943930880 2020-12-11 02:51:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @latimes It would be easy to blame California for Latino deaths from COVID as being racist.   But the issue lies w/our cultural make up as Latinos. It’s common practice among Latinos to have multiple families living in one home. They share the rent and responsibilities. Communal living.
1337106924643385345 2020-12-11 02:48:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DillyJames1 @Ettore31791256 @BeardyMan1983 @timemindfulness @KevinMKruse Here if you can read this is even happening in deep blue states so imagine what they would do in swing states to win an election at any cost.    https://t.co/Go69iAO5yk

1337105655488937984 2020-12-11 02:43:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When I asked the patient the composition of those living w/her she stated the following:   •Patient + husband + newborn   •Next family husband + wife + 2 minor children   •Next family husband + wife + child + MIL  So basically 11 ppl in a 2 bedroom apartment.
1337104565984874496 2020-12-11 02:39:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m Latina and I work in healthcare, do you know why Latinos are dealing with high COVID+ cases?  Because in CA like other places Latinos have several people living in the same dwelling.   I had a patient (COVID+) who lived w/ 2 other families in a 2 bedroom apt.

1337100760404803584 2020-12-11 02:23:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey @Hung_Hippo they think we are the same person. 😂 I’m honored.
1337100104818257920 2020-12-11 02:21:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ibefuckinggayb1 @Calthulhu1 @Hung_Hippo @TheMSMaquis @MollyRaePatric3 @Kica333 Animals get killed every day unfortunately, but I’m sure plenty of these ppl exist. So while you can’t have one they can have several.  https://t.co/WAKxqrxywz
1337098524773687296 2020-12-11 02:15:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Were there complaints of violating the constitution in that election by right wingers? Because that’s what is happening here with TEXAS vs PA.
1337097118247337984 2020-12-11 02:09:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ibefuckinggayb1 @Calthulhu1 @Hung_Hippo @TheMSMaquis @MollyRaePatric3 @Kica333 That’s probably best.

I don’t expect you to know this stuff because Biden voters seem to be low information voters.
1337095629344927744 2020-12-11 02:03:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ettore31791256 @BeardyMan1983 @timemindfulness @DillyJames1 @KevinMKruse There is evidence that what PA did was unconstitutional.   You can not make changes to the law without including the legislature.   PA decided to change the law while not going to the Republican legislature because they were afraid it wouldn’t pass. That’s a fact.
1337095067186577411 2020-12-11 02:01:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Finally.. these authoritarian leftist sh*ts want to destroy the lives of hardworking Americans while they continue to do whatever tf they want.    https://t.co/jivmbOCkp6

1337093954538377216 2020-12-11 01:56:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JimRobe70184873 Yep but nowhere does it say Trump actually colluded with Russia yet they repeat it like it’s true because they are low IQ voters.

1337092174073106435 2020-12-11 01:49:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess this dude NEVER read the Mueller report.

1337090075016843264 2020-12-11 01:41:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M @CodeMonkeyZ Fair enough.
1337087929890455554 2020-12-11 01:32:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M @CodeMonkeyZ Twitter requires a phone number too. Or at least I’ve always been forced to add one even when I’ve removed it.

1337086790633627648 2020-12-11 01:28:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M @CodeMonkeyZ Consent is just the descriptor. Like the other bolded sections.   They are explaining “consent”
1337086361979928576 2020-12-11 01:26:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha the left is pissed again..
1337084670983356416 2020-12-11 01:20:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CodeMonkeyZ It also says “WITH YOUR PERMISSION” in your screen shot not without.
1337083952218030085 2020-12-11 01:17:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So the @nypost got blocked by twitter because of their Hunter Biden story, so twitter basically interfered in an election?
1337083367938920450 2020-12-11 01:14:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Kamala wants to be president.

1337082300849246208 2020-12-11 01:10:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DonotInnovate @samstein It’s not, in fact the left wing media had concerns about Hunters “past” affecting his father’s campaign.   But sure blame the right wing media when you all knew about Hunter Biden and his past but gave zero shits because Orange Man Bad.    https://t.co/ssF5lNuvB9

So yes until the election happened and laws were changed unconstitutionally and access denied to affect one side more than the other in this election is when it became a crime.
1337078927290855424 2020-12-11 00:57:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whole_9_meters You think so?  https://t.co/bUzGBFTHo3
1337078670343618560 2020-12-11 00:56:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine that, Pantifa created an autonomous zone in Portland they have a wall and guns to protect it, yet  if this country does the same it’s racist. To think the majority of Portland voted for that mess &amp; against law &amp; order.  https://t.co/pkiKtbYQMS

1336926883535974400 2020-12-10 14:53:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha karma is sooooooo sweet.
1336926218487169025 2020-12-10 14:50:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Stated plainly, Eric Swalwell had sex with a Chinese spy who donated to his campaign so China could get things they wanted accomplished by our ejected officials.”   I wonder how much China gave democrats to impeach Trump.
1336922813135900673 2020-12-10 14:36:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Saying this screams soy consumer.
1336921406274031618 2020-12-10 14:31:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AcSK1LLies Oh definitely, but the left eat their own.
1336907254214225920 2020-12-10 13:35:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Says the party that’s been fighting each other for months. 😂
1336906866035621888 2020-12-10 13:33:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yep it’s true, but they probably want to replace her with a commie. We don’t need those in the senate too.
1336905183477960704 2020-12-10 13:26:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 I’m gonna take a wild guess they have their pronouns in their bio. 😂
1336904829470269441 2020-12-10 13:25:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ol Jaba Belgian Waffle likely hasn’t had sex in some time so she wants to punish everyone else. #HatersGonnaHate

1336871487773425664 2020-12-10 11:12:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NathWatkins Right?! But white supremacy is the problem. 🙄
1336871337617330178 2020-12-10 11:12:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is it the will of the people when the rules were changed to benefit one side more than the other while at the same time spitting on the constitution?
1336870680587988992 2020-12-10 11:09:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Atticus_BoS What? When was this?   Provide your proof or stfu.

1336703649364418560 2020-12-10 00:05:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why do all these things always happen in cities run by ppl like you @tedwheeler?
1336703023163211778 2020-12-10 00:03:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s the point? He already basically claimed he wants to let everyone out and won’t be prosecuting certain crimes.

1336698665973338114 2020-12-09 23:46:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well well this turd sounds scared af all of a sudden.
1336697947354849283 2020-12-09 23:43:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh so now @RepSwalwell has a problem with the FBI because he was listed in connection with a Chinese spy who helped get donations for his campaign? That’s more collusion then they ever proved Trump had with Russia. Get fked Swallowell you pos.
1336694413343408132 2020-12-09 23:29:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Very partisan even according to this article.   The evidence was in the cross referencing they did with the state information and proof that ppl did not request ballots yet one was submitted for them. This would require a full AUDIT of ALL the ballots.  https://t.co/xMa5Rgbg4n
1336587660094107648 2020-12-09 16:25:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ContrarySarie @BuzzPatterson @ericswalwell It’s true, but then again that’s not a Trump lawsuit it was a PA GOP one.   And this TEXAS VS PA lawsuit has a lot more merit. ☺️ Has already been docketed too.  https://t.co/G2kD0nhv2d
1336585537562370048 2020-12-09 16:16:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I say @realDonaldTrump should declass the info and expose these treasonous rats.
1336581264367702017 2020-12-09 15:59:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Treasonous rat should get the wall.

1336561916886482944 2020-12-09 14:42:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can you tell us how many black ppl are actually in RHAZ? You know since everything is so racist..
1336556910393184257 2020-12-09 14:22:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot @GOPLeader The republicans need to have some fkin balls. This is why we don’t trust them they don’t fight for anything.

1336548063649779713 2020-12-09 13:47:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So they added renaming bases in this defense bill because base names now all of a sudden hurt ppl’s feelings? 😂 @GOPLeader c’mon man. Caving to the left like this is pitiful.
1336543016924823553 2020-12-09 13:27:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RandBallsStu I feel bad for you. You’re the one crying about not being able to see your parents because YOU chose not to.   No need to forgive me, you need to forgive yourself for being a horrible child.
1336538956184240128 2020-12-09 13:11:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RandBallsStu I’m sure you blame someone else when you can’t get off either.
1336524500767133697 2020-12-09 12:14:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You made choices to not see your parents for Christmas. You can’t blame others for the choices YOU make.

1336387540497002496 2020-12-09 03:09:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sullivan is a garbage judge. He should have dismissed this a long time ago with the evidence provided.

Because if you can get the ppl to believe that then it will legitimize the election.   Never trust these mfkers.

Lawyers lied about Trump &amp; Russia. Lawyers lied to us trying to impeach Trump. An FBI lawyer falsified docs to spy on Trump.  https://t.co/TAdM4H9CU5
1336181430183870465 2020-12-08 13:30:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nirvana081276 Not if judges are tossing out all affidavits and not wanting to listen to witnesses.   Judge: provide proof!  Lawyers: we have witnesses and affidavits your honor.   Judge: that’s not good enough. *tosses case*

She has not filed any case for Trump for shown up for Trump in any of her cases.   He never claimed Sidney was on his personal legal team in the tweet.  https://t.co/o1ozsKrKHd
1336175003117580288 2020-12-08 13:05:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nirvana081276 That’s not what the article says. Ppl filling out affidavits online doesn’t mean 100% of them are lies but the judge basically claimed that.   Just like no one believes Biden got 100% of all votes in one ballot dump.   Anyone who believes that is lying to themselves.
1336173800229011456 2020-12-08 13:00:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nirvana081276 She was NEVER part of the team. Being an ally doesn’t make you a Trump lawyer. Ted Cruz is an ally he’s also not a Trump lawyer.  https://t.co/rTwMEH32uR
1336173211579416576 2020-12-08 12:58:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nirvana081276 It states they collected affidavits online and after cross referencing some were tossed out as false.   The judge claimed that because some had been found to be false then that invalidates all the rest of the affidavits and tossed out the case. The irony.  https://t.co/pGKU9m2jd0
1336170393736892416 2020-12-08 12:47:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nirvana081276 That case isn’t about fraud. Most cases aren’t.

She doesn’t need permission from Trump to go to court and bring her case. In fact Jenna Ellis made that very clear she’s not part of their team.   Care to provide any sources for your claims?

1336166390965760001 2020-12-08 12:31:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nirvana081276 You said “49 cases Trump lost”. He hasn’t. If other ppl want to sue they have that right for whatever grievance they feel they’ve suffered. Doesn’t mean they are TRUMP CASES.   Trump team doesn’t have to give anyone the green light to bring a case.

1336156360199684097 2020-12-08 11:51:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nirvana081276 Trump didn’t lose 49 cases you tit. Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis are Trump lawyers they have only brought 3 cases.   The other cases have been brought by different ppl NOT Trump, but like most leftists you probably are just repeating what you hear or saw in the media.
1336154672982212610 2020-12-08 11:44:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Don’t they want to protect ppl from COVID or are they murderers? With cases in LA rising how can they play when it’s time to #CancelEverything?  https://t.co/Srqxfi0wRO

1336148369991856128 2020-12-08 11:19:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So DeSantis himself came to your house and pointed a gun in your face?   I wonder why this hadn’t been labeled as “disputed” yet.
1336147826611372032 2020-12-08 11:17:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Isn’t that what Whitmer has been doing to ppl not wearing masks?   In this case a warrant was issued. How does it shut them up when she’s on twitter saying what happened? 🙄

The five freedoms it protects: speech, religion, press, assembly, and the right to petition the government.
1336146386241253376 2020-12-08 11:11:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 It is fascism when you block a news article from ppl.   What was their reasoning for blocking it? We don’t like it isn’t a good enough reason. We aren’t China ffs.

The five freedoms it protects: speech, religion, press, assembly, and the right to petition the government.
1336142629554163714 2020-12-08 10:56:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 Please explain why Twitter blocked links to the New York Post article and blocked them from posting on their platform if twitter is protected under 230 and the New York Post is protected under the 1A?   Who’s playing fascist?
1336141517409329152 2020-12-08 10:52:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 Oh but they are. They knew it too. They needed to play politics and block publishers from getting out stories they don’t like on their platform because they had a narrative to push. “Shifting their positions”?  https://t.co/fuGAG1Sw73
1336140855007068162 2020-12-08 10:49:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 If they have immunity then why do they have to block third party links and news articles?   The New York Post was told they could not return to twitter until they removed their article. This is over stepping by Twitter and the 1A.  https://t.co/cidJfAvplk
1336139924144234499 2020-12-08 10:45:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 The disclaimer could easily read “opinion” like in news articles. They are over stepping when they are making claims about what is being said on their platform by making open claims that the info is “disputed” or “false”.   Their algorithm blocks news articles as links.
1336139048306372609 2020-12-08 10:42:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 Clearly you are. We know what we are saying you are the one who doesn’t seem to get it.   What’s the point of 230 if Twitter has always been protected by the 1A?
1336138712745353216 2020-12-08 10:41:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 And that’s fine and dandy. They shouldn’t be held accountable for what other ppl say on their platform.   So labeling things as opinion vs disputed is where the difference lies.   You can’t make claims about what is said because then you’re a publisher.   Get it?
1336137836505001985 2020-12-08 10:37:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 I’m well aware what 230 is. Our point this whole time is you can’t be protected under 230 and the 1A. If you could there would be no point to 230 in the first place.   The thing is platform providers like Twitter didn’t want to be held accountable for others speaking their mind.
1336136335246049281 2020-12-08 10:31:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 No you seem confused.

But this is was used to defend the plaintiff on his 1A rights which they believed had been violated. Which according to the case in question vs twitter were not. This case protected the parade organizers.  https://t.co/w4VHxKlRQA
1336132845102755840 2020-12-08 10:17:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 But then you are saying they are protected twice.    You can’t claim to be protected under 230 and still be expected not to suffer consequences when you ACT as a publisher who can make claims with zero consequences.
1336131576032186368 2020-12-08 10:12:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 Who’s arguing it doesn’t?   I’m telling you the plaintiff in the previous case you mentioned didn’t have any 1A violations taken by twitter.   The plaintiff is the person who brings the case. I assure you I didn’t think Twitter had brought the case against someone.
1336131059004522496 2020-12-08 10:10:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 You are pulling a free speech example from a case that has to do with a parade. It was decided in 1995 that had nothing to do with Twitter. Yes you are allowed to march in a parade and show your “pride” and not allowing it is against their 1A rights.  https://t.co/IIcZb2GPWN
1336129786960232451 2020-12-08 10:05:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 That’s a different case. Not the one you initially spoke about and mentioned. As I explained in the other case the plaintiff was not protected. I will have to read this case you are trying to present now to prove your point to see what the case was about.
1336125763880321026 2020-12-08 09:49:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 @pikachuevie It’s typical of ppl who want to have their cake and eat it too.   Either you’re not a publisher and have rules or your a publisher and have to let ppl give their opinions.   I have yet to see a law that is passed that explains hate speech when we have freedom of speech.
1336125289529675777 2020-12-08 09:47:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 It would be easier for twitter to just label things “opinion” and stay out of blocking ppl on their site from giving one.   Instead they make claims about how something isn’t true which is different territory.
1336124976802381826 2020-12-08 09:46:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 A publisher doesn’t have to be a business. Although it can be a business.   Independent journalists can be considered publishers it’s why they have to label stories as “opinion” versus news. To protect themselves.
1336124516611760129 2020-12-08 09:44:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 The first amendment protects free speech from government censorship.   If twitter is NOT a publisher then they have no 1A protections.   The government gave them protection under 230 to not be responsible for what third parties say on their platform. Pick one.
1336123971998081024 2020-12-08 09:42:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 No it’s not their 1A right. They aren’t currently a publisher.   What 1A right are you claiming Twitter has that regular citizens don’t?   If twitter wants to be a publisher then they can be and then sued for false information. Can’t have it both ways.  https://t.co/jXM5pml0H8
1336122079570063360 2020-12-08 09:35:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 @pikachuevie 2. Those listed rules don’t include if you disagree with us politically or if you are saying things we don’t like.   If you make a tweet not retweet or directed at anyone they shouldn’t be able to ban you. Once you tweet at someone they consider that bullying.
1336121517264916481 2020-12-08 09:32:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 @pikachuevie 1. Exactly. Twitter can NOT give their opinion on opinions on their platform.   Because once they do they are not protected under 230.   That’s the problem they are currently facing. They can ban ppl for breaking their listed rules.
1336120756531412992 2020-12-08 09:29:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I have yet to hear “man murdered by nerf gun” in the media.

1336120314661466112 2020-12-08 09:28:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 If Twitter wants to act as a publisher by giving opinions about comments on their platform then they are stepping into territory that does not protect them under 230.   If 230 protects them because they don’t interfere then interfering could cause them a problem.
1336119877879255047 2020-12-08 09:26:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 Let’s think this out.. If law 230 protects Twitter from what ppl say on their platform then why the need for them to ban anyone for what they deem “hate speech” when there’s no such thing as hate speech depicted in the law?
1336119281868664832 2020-12-08 09:23:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pikachuevie @who_am_i_3005 I guess you’d have to understand what the argument in the case was.  1. The Plaintiff was arguing that his first amendment rights were infringed. He couldn’t prove discrimination on the basis of sex, religion or race under the 1A protections.  https://t.co/zJpMnNvOot
1335829004713033730 2020-12-07 14:10:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m laughing so hard right now... imagine thinking this is temporary. 🤣  https://t.co/B3QT934cEn
1335769292961239040 2020-12-07 10:13:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Yes, it’s staged to see how ppl would react. They obviously aren’t reacting appropriately and that’s sad.

1335637557720219648 2020-12-07 01:29:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is because they are calculating not tabulating as intended.
1335636049637175296 2020-12-07 01:23:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So if you have a cable, electrical, WiFi outage no one has to go out to fix it because that would be a crime in your eyes right? That’s why ppl who don’t think outside their ass like you should never be allowed to vote.
1335635130514169856 2020-12-07 01:20:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are we taking advice from ppl like Pete now? I think the hell not.

1335633413173178369 2020-12-07 01:13:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So the fascists are trying to dictate who can be seen at hospitals now?   How about if you do hard drugs no hospital service?   How about if you were drinking and got in an accident no hospital service?   How about if you leave AMA more than once no hospital service?

1335443831337099267 2020-12-06 12:39:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realLewisMichae The “believe women” crowd always go after women they don’t agree with politically.
1335440600938639360 2020-12-06 12:27:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HelenKennedy I find it hilarious the “believe women” ppl are always the ones going after women and trying to discredit them when they don’t agree with them on politics or go after someone they voted for.
1335440073819471874 2020-12-06 12:24:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What does this have to do with being a witness and signing a sworn affidavit of what she saw?
1335427433953075201 2020-12-06 11:34:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The Pantifa fascist domestic terrorists are at it again. Hope they get fked up.

1335411485707681793 2020-12-06 10:31:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually in most hospitals it’s considered unhygienic and the RN would be asked to remove them before next shift. Too much “stuff” can get caught under the nails and you can’t wear gloves with those things.
1335389850728468480 2020-12-06 09:05:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeorgeHaught I’m so sorry for your loss. 🙏🏼
1335372637401272320 2020-12-06 07:57:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Because like witnesses testified in other states some were switching votes.   Trump won Texas by the way. As well as did the GOP. Now tell me which states did GOP do well in and Trump didn’t? So more ppl voted for Warner than they did for Biden, yet Trump got more than the (R)?  https://t.co/rtjtjwB8ni
1335368931117158403 2020-12-06 07:42:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This clip is a perfect example of how the left works. Grifters. There’s always a monetary reason they stir the shit. #clerks    https://t.co/X7dAOa1tg3
1335366694932422661 2020-12-06 07:33:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker 40k Voting for neither candidate doesn’t mean they out performed the president by that much.   Basically could have been a left person who didn’t vote for either as well.
1335366402362904576 2020-12-06 07:32:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker “A USA TODAY analysis of unofficial results in Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Michigan found up to 40,000 voters in each of these highly competitive states opted for none of the candidates listed on the presidential ballot by name.”
1335361196547919872 2020-12-06 07:11:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot I got the video here..
1335360887704567810 2020-12-06 07:10:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker They didn’t have to cheat in every state. Some states are guaranteed like CA yet they still had ppl accused of voter fraud probably thinking IG wouldn’t matter. 8000 fraudulent ballots in 1 county is a lot and could make a difference in states like GA.    https://t.co/ZtXJYFoBDC
1335359685583536128 2020-12-06 07:05:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker So your anecdotal experience is what makes you believe that Trump lost because some of your friends don’t like Trump?   I work with several ppl in CA that did vote for Trump but couldn’t tell anyone because of how the left is.
1335359271932850176 2020-12-06 07:03:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Yea he’s down, but polls were wrong by 5-10 pts about Trump the whole time.   And they aren’t that far apart from OBAMA, CLINTON and BUSH around the same time.
1335358136257970177 2020-12-06 06:59:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Try taking ppls flags now you Pantifa shits!  https://t.co/8ceAxjO21W
1335357708678037505 2020-12-06 06:57:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker So you are assuming all these ppl looked at the top of the ballot and didn’t fill it in but took the time to check all the GOP candidates down ballot?   Does that even make sense to you? I mean logically does that make sense?
1335356474474725376 2020-12-06 06:52:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker As a “truth seeker” you should really look stuff up more.
1335356329402146816 2020-12-06 06:52:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker He didn’t have low approvals in his party. And 5M votes that went to Biden in the popular vote came from CA alone. 😂   If polls were off by 5-10 pts across the board did Trump really have a low approval rating?  https://t.co/8rxKAKl9wM
1335355053423489024 2020-12-06 06:47:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker So youre trying to say they voted all GOP down ticket and voted for Biden? Yea you aren’t GOP if you vote for someone with the policies of Biden and a VP like Kamala.   Might as well say I’ll vote for communism instead of freedom because I hate the person who’s pushing freedom.
1335354104084717575 2020-12-06 06:43:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker How does that make sense to you? How do republicans who weren’t expected to win down ticket win miraculously while Trump loses?   There was a third party candidate. The libertarian Jorgensen. She didn’t get that many votes over all.
1335351163810504706 2020-12-06 06:31:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Trump had a 90% approval rating among the Republican Party only 3% were Dems. If the GOP candidates did well it was because Trump got his supporters to vote for them and rallied for them.  https://t.co/nK9cv2F0AL
1335350426359590912 2020-12-06 06:28:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Who do you think GOP voters are?   I’ll give you a hint. Majority are Trump voters because Trump is the one who told his supporters to vote for them. Most GOP running won because they supported Trump themselves.
1335347728214151168 2020-12-06 06:18:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For those Republicans in GA contemplating not voting in the Jan 5th election I will remind you what a loss truly means:  • GND • M4A  • FREE COLLEGE • PACKING THE COURT  • SHUTTING DOWN THE COUNTRY • AMERICAN JOBS • 2A RIGHTS  • BEING FKED BY CHINA AGAIN  • MORE WARS  https://t.co/ykdKsN3sqO

1335326817796780032 2020-12-06 04:54:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So college costs have gone up in leftist cities because they suck and instead of asking colleges to refund students this imbecile wants the rest of us to bail out ppl who got themselves in debt and the colleges too? 😂 The government is shit when it comes to managing money.

1335300531489685504 2020-12-06 03:10:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is it considered “philanthropy” to make billions destroying the currency of countries?   “pocketed over 1B &amp; brought the Bank of England to its knees... no small feat but to destroy the monetary system of Great Britain in one single day is something else altogether.”
1335278060325588993 2020-12-06 01:41:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LostSoul_76 Wholeheartedly agree. I’m sure he’s literally shaking at the sight of all that “toxic masculinity”. 😂
1335275467964727298 2020-12-06 01:30:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @r8rsforlife @cain_nate The ppl who say this are usually the same ones who ask for prayers for dying family members or themselves when they are having a rough time.
1335274657465782272 2020-12-06 01:27:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @georgie_porgie Just using the PC term for the leftist imbeciles.
1335274263222206466 2020-12-06 01:26:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What do you have against guns, alcohol and weed commie?
1335272617499000834 2020-12-06 01:19:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We don’t owe undocumented immigrants who break our laws the opportunity to go to college.   They have the right education in their own damn countries not ours.   Y yo digo eso como hispana.
1335272067734806528 2020-12-06 01:17:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ElSkreletron Leftist gingers have no souls.  https://t.co/HYRrOyTUx6
1335271186758922243 2020-12-06 01:13:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @georgie_porgie It’s all they got. I’d rather be a Putin puppet than a CCP asshoe licker.
1335260384282886144 2020-12-06 00:30:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> She’s been a damn liar.. lied to all of you about Russia Collusion that never happened just like Schiff.
1335260190510260225 2020-12-06 00:30:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SchwaeJames @JenGriffinFNC No, because that would be wrong. Just like leftists said it was wrong when Trump did it.
1335259930417266688 2020-12-06 00:29:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Awesome, I couldn’t be happier.
1335257734883672066 2020-12-06 00:20:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Timcast Elliot Page is now a straight white male. Hope their lesbian wife understands.
1335257104144166912 2020-12-06 00:17:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If the fascist left has their way in the US this is where we are headed...
1335256670457348096 2020-12-06 00:16:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Been telling leftists for months while their dumbasses kept blaming Republicans. These are the ppl you voted for, the ones that act like they give a shit about you, but don’t. Fkin morons. But Orange man bad. 🙄
1335099546523717639 2020-12-05 13:51:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No evidence of Jordan being a pervert, but that you believe. You fkin clown.
1335083307432742912 2020-12-05 12:47:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @theblesseddead_ @AchillesThe Oh I know some don’t like to claim they are white, but Jew isn’t a race.   I’m Hispanic, but race wise I’d likely be considered white as well.
1335082955014692869 2020-12-05 12:45:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dub_three @LizzerMack It’s a meme. Lol but wound care of the neo vagina is necessary and could get smelly with infection.
1335080482782863360 2020-12-05 12:36:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’ll make a wager it’s all the leftist colleges in leftist run cities.  https://t.co/32J6OfqEHa

1335079027984355329 2020-12-05 12:30:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola Logic and morals are lost on the left. They won’t realize it until it’s too late.
1335078279003291650 2020-12-05 12:27:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola Because it has.
1335077115717242880 2020-12-05 12:22:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola There are several businesses with the same name in different places in CA. I looked for the one next to the Hanami Sushi. Which happened to be in Sherman Oaks. The other one is in Tustin that I found.
1335076403914579969 2020-12-05 12:19:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola These same ppl want us to believe if they got UBI they wouldn’t spend it on bullshit like weed and alcohol.
1335073880818425857 2020-12-05 12:09:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Vulva cancer is next.. (don’t lookup images)

1335071338575220737 2020-12-05 11:59:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How did this man not win his election against Karen Bass? She’s a fkin disgrace.

1335069857910439937 2020-12-05 11:53:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola This restaurant is in Sherman Oaks, CA that lady in the blue shirt looks like the woman in the video. The restaurant next to it, Hanami Sushi is now permanently closed. :(  https://t.co/SojIMzMRRC
1335062196552753152 2020-12-05 11:23:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola But is what she said about the movie ppl being allowed while businesses are closed true?   I don’t put anything past Garcetti’s ass. He’s a fkin criminal.

Don’t worry I’ll wait.
1335056568535011333 2020-12-05 11:01:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This breaks my heart. Biden guaranteed more shutdowns and ppl honestly believe ppl across the country voted for him/this?  https://t.co/rrt4JAqVS9
1335053709022175233 2020-12-05 10:49:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead Imagine what working for her will be like after that? Yikes.
1335053357510086656 2020-12-05 10:48:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk I was wondering where the biscuits were. Lol. I see them now.
1335050990685327360 2020-12-05 10:38:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MattFre29255087 @SpeakerPelosi That too.
1335050906409132033 2020-12-05 10:38:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Betsy Davos also donates her government salary to charities. What have you done except berate your staffers and throw things at them?
1335049722961117186 2020-12-05 10:33:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because @SpeakerPelosi is fkin trash.
1335047075428327425 2020-12-05 10:23:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Drop names or get fked you pos.

You probably should have done some more investigating. Case was dropped.. she had ZERO proof of her allegations. She also said she had no idea who her attacker was until she saw the apprentice.  https://t.co/Y2r3yO9V39
1335039942313926656 2020-12-05 09:55:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So 3 yrs into a Trump admin &amp; these turds gave credit to Obama for the great economy. Biden isn’t even in office &amp; these imbeciles already give him credit for the vaccine &amp; the stock market?   Remember when the left decried that only “rich ppl” have stock?
1335029729246601216 2020-12-05 09:14:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AchillesThe I wouldn’t classify Portuguese as Hispanic. They are Latinos they speak Portuguese.
1335025403480604672 2020-12-05 08:57:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good the universe needs a restart.
1335023682691817472 2020-12-05 08:50:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 They *ARE* the fascists.
1335023463698853889 2020-12-05 08:49:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AchillesThe Latino is also an ethnicity.   Afro Latinos are black not white when you are talking about race.   Hispanic means ppl who come from Spanish speaking countries. Latinos include ppl who speak Portuguese and are Latin American. Some from Latin America could have Spanish origins.  https://t.co/9s10mF9l6Z
1335019358448353280 2020-12-05 08:33:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird how ppl twist this into @KellyannePolls said Trump lost. She has the info the rest of us do and have had about the electoral college numbers since Nov 4th.  https://t.co/kpsbJuf158
1335018484648931328 2020-12-05 08:29:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You mean like the Nazis ostracized then Jews you fascist pos!?
1335015201087709184 2020-12-05 08:16:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AchillesThe Hispanic is not a race it’s an ethnicity. They are different you know.
1335009073738076160 2020-12-05 07:52:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AchillesThe Exactly Jewish isn’t a race you just said it was an ethnicity.
1335001343895846912 2020-12-05 07:21:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AchillesThe Jewish isn’t a race tho.
1334986980644376576 2020-12-05 06:24:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I love constitutional lawyers.
1334984875737194496 2020-12-05 06:16:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s almost like this person believes if the government claims something is “FREE” it somehow is and comes with no strings attached.
1334983755505651713 2020-12-05 06:11:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco Wtf?!
1334983701747273730 2020-12-05 06:11:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot Weed should be like certain foods untaxed.  https://t.co/U2j2h9AbwZ
1334982221539655680 2020-12-05 06:05:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RightSassy The lion should have Trump’s hair. 😂
1334982077830189056 2020-12-05 06:05:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The only reason Dems are decriminalizing weed is because they see taxes they can collect on the sale of it.   “The House of Representatives passed the MORE Act on Friday by a vote of 228-164.”  https://t.co/Yfndx9fUgb
1334980876166303744 2020-12-05 06:00:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I kinda love this.. 🇺🇸  https://t.co/9lWyjuaw4b

1334979685608955904 2020-12-05 05:55:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @iNYC @disclosetv You’re a disgusting pos.
1334978748895043584 2020-12-05 05:51:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JustinGrayWSB Shouldn’t they be out in the open where ppl could see them not in suitcases hidden under a table?   Seems odd that counters would realize they had suitcases left of ballots to count.   Plausible deniability is a thing too.
1334977985317728256 2020-12-05 05:48:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kylegriffin1 This coming from the guy that wants to shut the country down again and not let ppl earn a living.
1334977876886601728 2020-12-05 05:48:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well @SpeakerPelosi probably should have negotiated with Senate republicans &amp; the president and not played politics and passed a skinny bill to get those benefits passed 6 months ago. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1334972995224256512 2020-12-05 05:28:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Really because they had a hearing about it in GA and I’m not sure you covered it. It doesn’t have to be “massive” just about 15k ballots.
1334972211682136065 2020-12-05 05:25:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not surprised. Their citizens are expendable. They already harvest their organs.
1334971478425518080 2020-12-05 05:22:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well the DOJ needs to see that and come to the same conclusion.
1334950315255218177 2020-12-05 03:58:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican It would also be important for you to understand that Trump lawyers Giuliani &amp; Jenna Ellis are only arguing certain cases.   Most filings that include  Donald Trump for President, Inc. is on behalf of the re-election campaign not Trump himself, but then again YOU believe buzzfeed  https://t.co/B0IoFZDmIB
1334948607368155136 2020-12-05 03:52:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Care to provide the source of your claim? Hopefully it’s not a buzzfeed article.   You claimed election fraud doesn’t exist.. now all of a sudden it does and they voted for Trump? 😂 The back tracking has begun..
1334947851730743296 2020-12-05 03:49:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican You probably should have read what they failed to provide which is what the filing is actually challenging in court. Right before that quote about not challenging that the ballots were illegal in the article.   They are challenging process not the validity of the ballots. 🙄  https://t.co/sM2n1xRWD0
1334946215209779200 2020-12-05 03:42:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Ahhh so you didn’t watch and think you know more than I do about what ppl said after listening to 7 hrs of witness testimony. While you believe what the media tells you? 😂  They confirmed what they signed sworn affidavits for you ignorant turd.
1334945711519977474 2020-12-05 03:40:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Do you need another?    https://t.co/hr8Uf1UcIX
1334945017622753280 2020-12-05 03:37:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican How many fking examples do you need to show that voter fraud exists?    https://t.co/RixY5fDSvZ
1334944666345558017 2020-12-05 03:36:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican The fact you think election fraud doesn’t exist at all shows your ignorance.    https://t.co/UV0QaQ9k7d
1334944347779784706 2020-12-05 03:35:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Voter fraud exists you imbecile. It’s whether the voter fraud exists on a level that would change the election outcome.   Ffs    https://t.co/VaK7uxidyH
1334943481559539713 2020-12-05 03:31:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ok @BrianKempGA how tf is this ok? You’re the fkin governor for something.
1334943173148254208 2020-12-05 03:30:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s do the math.  $2000/mo x 8M applicants =   192,000,000,000 a year. Yep can’t wait to see how this experiment works out. I guess when they start reporting ppl eating their neighbors due to lack of food some ppl might finally understand.  https://t.co/q2jy7smY2i
1334941205038133248 2020-12-05 03:22:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tailford That worked. 😂
1334939070573604865 2020-12-05 03:14:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AchillesThe Oh he’ll claim he’s not when it benefits him I’m sure of it. If he’s not white then what is he?
1334938746521702401 2020-12-05 03:12:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @stillgray @aoc that’s exactly how Hitler spoke about Jews.
1334935102329999361 2020-12-05 02:58:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like China is top of the list by almost double. I don’t see China or India slowing down so why should we?  https://t.co/AiaqYKb4Sy
1334932901574582272 2020-12-05 02:49:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weren’t you the one screeching about Republicans not wearing masks in Congress. That’s the best mask you can wear if COVID is that infectious.   FYI wearing a mask in your profile pic is peak leftist virtue signaling chode.
1334931817384693762 2020-12-05 02:45:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican If you need me to break down the quote because you don’t read well I can do that too.   “To date” = Since Tues   “Have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome” = they’ve seen fraud just not enough to change the election results so far!  https://t.co/qiHTmxdlBp
1334930801658478592 2020-12-05 02:41:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Learn to read. I said WHEN he says he found voter fraud and they have evidence of it don’t back pedal on your comment of trusting the DOJ.   The Barr quote: he never said he didn’t find fraud. This was before the hearing in GA with video evidence.  https://t.co/sNefbi7eFg
1334929586019205120 2020-12-05 02:36:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Again I ask you for the 3rd time did you watch the hearings and what witnesses were saying or do you just trust what buzzfeed tells you?
1334929247249473536 2020-12-05 02:35:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left   VS   The left  https://t.co/jlBUUDXKc3
1334928432983986178 2020-12-05 02:31:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Are you truly providing me with a buzzfeed article?   Barr’s comment was simple they are still investigating claims. Remember this tweet when Barr comes forward claiming election fraud happened and they have proof when you back pedal.
1334925789700055040 2020-12-05 02:21:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @212maven Wtf?! *smh*
1334924523397734400 2020-12-05 02:16:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So white ppl having babies is now “white nationalism”? Hope you don’t have any kids or reproduce Ben.
1334923291790692354 2020-12-05 02:11:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mikeinmarlton @RobSchneider Ummm what do you call this?  https://t.co/BfFY0LeZMS
1334922122137767937 2020-12-05 02:06:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun I believe he was escorted off the field not sure if it was by a LEO.
1334921892432498688 2020-12-05 02:05:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SpeakerPelosi never cared about the Americans suffering it was always about power.
1334921516920631296 2020-12-05 02:04:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s a lie that your anonymous sources tell.. are you literally this delusional old man?
1334921142402871302 2020-12-05 02:02:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1LastRepublican Did you watch the hearings? Yes they were official poll watchers and they did mention it to the poll clerk and the poll clerk said they were fine and told them to let the ballots thru.   The witnesses testified to what they signed sworn affidavits for.   Maybe watch the hearing.
1334919558600118272 2020-12-05 01:56:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha they just can’t help themselves. @Tailford  https://t.co/rOe54n1W1p

1334916761758519298 2020-12-05 01:45:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @FoxNews I have more fear of the stupid then anything else.
1334916537430372352 2020-12-05 01:44:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @FoxNews Actually I don’t think she’s dumb because she’s a liberal. I was a liberal. I think she’s dumb and her supporters are just dumber than she is. That’s the issue. I don’t have to think progressives are smart to have concerns and not underestimate them.
1334914826577985537 2020-12-05 01:37:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @FoxNews You give her too much credit.
1334914102150406144 2020-12-05 01:34:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk This part stood out.. now she’s using @FoxNews to sell her product?  https://t.co/BYKZYixJGD

1334886241075007488 2020-12-04 23:44:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They do not.. and why were they hidden underneath a table until everyone else was asked to leave?

1334762322573717506 2020-12-04 15:31:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Agreed that was a problem, but I’d rather her than a fkin commie like Warnock. At least Loeffler will vote with McConnell. That’s all I care about. A solid Republican wall against these commie fks.
1334761550825967617 2020-12-04 15:28:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas She has to win. And now that Georgia is actually wanting to investigate election fraud that’s a good sign.
1334761326057463808 2020-12-04 15:27:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Run off: So when you have multiple ppl running during an election it’s problematic. Because in order to win the election you have to win 50% of the total vote.   Loeffler collected majority of the vote between the two. Collins dropped out so now she has a run off w/Warnock.  https://t.co/gWRpzi1rJy
1334759987520794626 2020-12-04 15:22:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Poor Bernie still doesn’t even realize the swamp tested their rigging in the primaries against him to make sure Biden got the nomination.
1334758996641640449 2020-12-04 15:18:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Oh ffs. Yes they are being suckered into believing that it’s something they should do. It’s exactly what democrats would want.   I don’t think Doug Collins should have run against Loeffler she could have had the 50% to not go to a run off.
1334757893497790469 2020-12-04 15:14:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas The left is using it as a talking point too. Pendejos.

1334753202252644352 2020-12-04 14:55:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @michaelxxx007 @dawrongguey @MollyRatty What kind of logic is that? You tried to make it seem like it’s an OK CORRAL over here and shoot outs happen all over the country because ppl have guns. It doesn’t. In fact suicides are the largest gun deaths.   Isn’t that why they had government forced abortions, less ppl?
1334752334304346114 2020-12-04 14:52:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not if that loss means we never win another election again. Because Dems will be able to pass everything they couldn’t pass in 2020 and will just rig more elections in the future.
1334751579203751939 2020-12-04 14:49:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> While asking everyone to leave before they start putting them in the tabulators? Nope...
1334750656431751168 2020-12-04 14:45:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @days_inn2 @MarkDice @chenweihua @MarshaBlackburn Yep.. and where is the lie?   That doesn’t change the fact CHINA is communist.
1334749002089152512 2020-12-04 14:38:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dawrongguey Oh so you are ok with ppl being put in camps and having their organs harvested? Oh and not to mention putting ppl in jail for “protesting”? I actually enjoy my freedom, don’t ever come back. Thanks.

Oh that’s right you lost that argument so now you are switching subjects.   Maybe you should realize that majority of gun deaths in the US are suicides.  https://t.co/XxyIORdYl5
1334747234714337282 2020-12-04 14:31:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dawrongguey Haha COVID free because that’s what your government tells you? And if they catch you saying otherwise what happens.   Also what else is the CCP going to say? Did they tell you they hit a 44 yr low in their economy as well or naw?
1334746492272144384 2020-12-04 14:28:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SameeraKhan They did blame black ppl for “rising numbers” of COVID. This isn’t societal racism.  https://t.co/TXZJSrUXa7

1334743538911735808 2020-12-04 14:17:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dawrongguey The “ripped from their mothers arms” bullshit has been over played and not true.

1334742860365623297 2020-12-04 14:14:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dawrongguey Prisons where ppl who have murdered, raped and broken the law are put? Those prisons?   They get a roof over their head, 3 meals a day, gym time, free training and free healthcare. Yep those sound like concentration camps alright. 🙄
1334742123950690305 2020-12-04 14:11:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kaylapop_ @MollyRatty Detention camps aren’t concentration camps you fkin pendeja.   You think concentration camps in Germany let ppl out or got to go to court or released back to their countries?   I’m sure Jews would have preferred our detention centers over this..  https://t.co/jkkL0euTiW
1334740778271219715 2020-12-04 14:06:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dawrongguey @MollyRatty Really? Tell me when Americans put their own citizens in camps? Don’t worry I’ll wait.

1334739814311084037 2020-12-04 14:02:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> China should probably apologize for being racist and blaming COVID on black ppl. While also putting Muslims in re-education camps and harvesting their organs, but maybe that’s just me.
1334739491731304450 2020-12-04 14:01:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No that’s not why. It’s because in the US we have the freedom to talk shit about our government officials when we the people aren’t happy with them.
1334738790879907841 2020-12-04 13:58:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chenweihua @marcorubio What was racist about it? Talking about what China has done isn’t racist you fkin CCP clown.

1334732331513307136 2020-12-04 13:32:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart My problem is with her claiming capitalism is a problem while over charging for the sweater on her site numbnuts.   The difference from the standard was PPE was previously made outside of the country. We mostly got our PPE from China.   Do you read?  https://t.co/MLyrTQqdNv
1334731578719698950 2020-12-04 13:29:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine saying a skinny bill is as useless as having no bill to ppl who have been unable to work.. *smh*   The arrogance of leftists is truly off the charts.   FYI I’m a frontline worker. We have not had a shortage of PPE.
1334730455006887936 2020-12-04 13:25:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart Could you please provide the info on where the Republican skinny bill wanted to bail out cooperations? Because I can’t seem to find it.   Liability protections for businesses aren’t corporate kick backs either.    https://t.co/exDpCxUX3e
1334729136892387328 2020-12-04 13:19:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart Dems wanted to bail out their own failed states. If you want to read it here you go:  https://t.co/eo5Mjx9A3y  https://t.co/LgDZrLWt1k
1334727581539606533 2020-12-04 13:13:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart So are you saying if we can’t get what we want in one huge bill fk everyone?   Why does it have to feature PPE? Don’t we have plenty already and the fact we now make our own PPE in the country a big deal?
1334727137148866560 2020-12-04 13:12:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart What’s a reach about it?   Is she still getting a check while Americans can’t work and earn money?   Yes or no would be fine.
1334726677138558978 2020-12-04 13:10:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart Maybe if they would have passed a bill just helping those who need it while not adding fluff it would have.   That money has to be paid back. It’s not just miraculously paid off. Do you even know how the US debt and inflation works?
1334726205262553089 2020-12-04 13:08:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart I don’t hate her.. I think she’s stupid.
1334725983312592896 2020-12-04 13:07:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart I’m sure ppl in her district would disagree. She very much is a hypocrite. Hating on capitalism while selling $58 sweaters on her site. 😂  Honestly I feel sorry for you clowns that don’t even realize you’re getting played.
1334725320922951683 2020-12-04 13:04:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart She also ruined the opportunity for more jobs for her constituents while she gets a regular check.   Tell me while small businesses are being shutdown and ppl are unemployed and locked down unable to earn a check is she taking a pay cut?
1334724977350696962 2020-12-04 13:03:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart How can I be mad at ppl who create jobs across the country and pay 90% of all taxes in the US?   What does the government create?   I don’t give a shit if she was elected she’s a fkin hypocrite talking about the rich while she makes 3x what ppl in her district make.
1334724247785127937 2020-12-04 13:00:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart But I thought black ppl couldn’t make it in America? 🙄  So she’s not rich but suddenly made it? So which is it? Sorry but the government should be where you “make it”.
1334723787422453763 2020-12-04 12:58:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart But eat the rich right? In her district she is the rich you tit.
1334723538280824837 2020-12-04 12:57:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart I don’t give a shit if it’s standard. They all get paid the same unless you are speaker. She shouldn’t be getting rich at all as a public servant.  https://t.co/0qVIZQ9Hel
1334723025455878144 2020-12-04 12:55:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @askeletonheart It does matter. She’s making 3x the average salary of her constituents. I bet they’d think she’s fkin rich.  https://t.co/0BPWLuR3pj
1334721086663970816 2020-12-04 12:47:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do you make $174k and have job expenses paid for while working a total of 146 days on average in any given year?  https://t.co/Hz6AHhJzSx

This is exactly why the left wins and right loses. They tend to vote and support their candidates even when they get nothing in return.

1334638716690657282 2020-12-04 07:20:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This isn’t a nod to anything. Leftist opinions are truly worthless.
1334635654727143431 2020-12-04 07:08:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is the tragedy that the democrats have created with their lockdown bullshit.
1334635407976267777 2020-12-04 07:07:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is incorrect. It’s NOT climbing in my city. Not our fault that your democratic shitholes are having issues during the cold season. You probably should have prepared for that with the federal money the state got you pos.
1334634580691755009 2020-12-04 07:04:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because Americans love their freedom and will have nothing to do with the fascist tyranny of the left.
1334602482849234945 2020-12-04 04:56:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DeetSupreme Here’s they are claiming it was 5-8x the rate not 35x, but then again the sheep just repeat what they are told.
1334602117701459969 2020-12-04 04:55:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DeetSupreme Who said it was 35x the rate? Don’t tell me the media?
1334591218773159936 2020-12-04 04:11:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now leftists in DC who don’t like ppl having choices are pissed that ppl chose to stay at Trump Hotel even tho the price was a little higher. 🙄  The inaugural committee can spend on what it wants whether you like it or not. Fkin DC fascist clowns.
1334589843746115585 2020-12-04 04:06:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Communism folks, communism.
1334589624535011328 2020-12-04 04:05:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s not improper when ppl had other choices in hotels to stay at during the inauguration.   If you have a hotel offering $50 rates and you chose to stay at the one that’s $300 a night that’s your choice. I don’t know how having a choice is illegal.
1334589226201956353 2020-12-04 04:04:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Here’s the most important part of your piece “which meant that the hotel was guaranteed at least $10,000 in revenue from guests willing to book one.”   Guests willing to book one means they had other choices and didn’t have to stay at the Trump hotel. This isn’t illegal.
1334588265773481985 2020-12-04 04:00:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “I understand compared to the original pricing this is great”. So they thought they were getting a deal and made the choice to have it there anyway. Again choices ppl have.
1334586725096542208 2020-12-04 03:54:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually great move by Mnuchin. We know Dems like to spend money on things it wasn’t intended to be used for. I don’t see what the problem is if the excess remains there after 2026 it should go back to the treasury.
1334583403769856000 2020-12-04 03:40:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @numbers_truth @BeardyMan1983 @samstein Oh it will be larger because every year it is, but not 300k larger which will likely be the end totals of COVID.   So I wonder which type of death decreased during COVID.   Flu? Cancer? Pneumonia? Heart Disease? Obesity?
1334581602274353153 2020-12-04 03:33:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @numbers_truth @BeardyMan1983 @samstein No I don’t agree. I’m giving you totals from the actual CDC site for 2018.   And according to CDC and Reuters the 2020 numbers are “under revision”.   Plus I’d love to know how many of the COVID deaths were healthy ppl with ZERO health issues.  https://t.co/zvQywYZxPZ
1334578053519790082 2020-12-04 03:19:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @numbers_truth @BeardyMan1983 @samstein So the death rates are consistently rising even before COVID? Shocker.
1334532076029190144 2020-12-04 00:16:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @numbers_truth @BeardyMan1983 @samstein I didn’t pull the wrong number. It’s simple math. 2.8M/12 = 233k a month average (2018)   274k/11 = 24.9k a month.   You are saying 24.9k more are dying monthly than in 2018 correct? If not why not?   I can’t wait to see the final numbers.  https://t.co/YRGmcj3J7Q

1334527699335856128 2020-12-03 23:59:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @numbers_truth @BeardyMan1983 @samstein The number of “healthy” people with no pre existing conditions who have died of COVID is relatively minuscule.

1334521958117986304 2020-12-03 23:36:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s not, but ppl like you don’t understand how numbers work very well.
1334521715532042240 2020-12-03 23:35:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you survived all those things what kind of choices were you making in your life? Good grief.
1334521381627826176 2020-12-03 23:34:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then you should know ppl like you who ignore that black ppl kill other black ppl at a higher rate then cops ever have according to YOU means WE should defund black ppl.
1334395516323389442 2020-12-03 15:14:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m guessing they think New Yorkers smell of cat piss and are dirty af while drinking Fanta from a martini glass or is the just the quality of the water there? Geezus.

I mean Trump can always run in 2024 since he hasn’t fulfilled his 2 terms. When the Biden admin doesn’t do anything they claimed they would if they won the election we’ll have another 2016.   But I’m patient..

And you are trusting that the media is doing their job?   So tell me why the media keeps repeating that Flynn lied to the FBI about sanctions when per FBI notes, 302s and the 12/29/20 transcript Flynn never mentioned sanctions?  https://t.co/vuusGwOTS5

I claimed that I’ve heard enough testimony to have a doubt about the 2020 election.   And I’d love to see the actual evidence Sidney Powell claims she has of massive election fraud.   I don’t believe anything until I see proof.

It’s these ppl are putting their careers on the line why not expose them as liars for all the public to see.   Why not try to discredit Sidney Powell and all her evidence and show Trump supporters they were wrong?   I’m not scared of it I encourage it.

I also supported HRC in 2016.   Instead the left claimed Trump won because Russia convinced millions of Americans to vote for him. That’s not fraud.

You want actual evidence ask the courts to take on the case.   It’s not intellectually dishonest to show you that there have been concerns with these Dominion machines long before the election happened.   You tell me why were they concerned?

Bet you were real concerned when Trump won in 2016 and claims were made about Russia helping him win, but because the person you wanted is showing winning you don’t care.   Typical.

I even stated for clarification that it doesn’t mean it’s not the truth. You on the other hand claimed ppl lied under oath because you can’t think outside of the box while the media giving you anonymous sources are factual. 😂
1334321808711929857 2020-12-03 10:21:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy That was a very poor example. I never claimed anything about Dominion. I just stated a fact that they had an opportunity to clear things up and refused to show.  Your initial statement was “I bet these ppl won’t say this under oath”. They have. So your statement was FALSE.
1334320721355395072 2020-12-03 10:17:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You lose ppl in the hands of fascism and communism. These ppl changed from wanting equality to equity real quick.
1334320227480264704 2020-12-03 10:15:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha we already know what they think. Not saying it doesn’t change a fking thing. 🖕🏼 https://t.co/NVJePJIN9a
1334319761505746945 2020-12-03 10:13:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do you also not understand why women who have no children would date or marry a man who does?
1334319201360613377 2020-12-03 10:11:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So shooting birds and being outside is something only “extremists” do?   Freedom is clearly lost on these fkin brain dead fascists  https://t.co/CSgkTOkCWg
1334317604551282688 2020-12-03 10:04:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy I could call the media tomorrow and make a claim. They would say an anonymous source “overheard” and told us blah blah blah.   I guess YOU should never question what the media pushes. I prefer not to do as expected. I ask lots of questions always after the media lied to me.
1334316866307649536 2020-12-03 10:01:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Who said anonymous sources = fake? I sure as hell didn’t.   It’s funny the media tells you they have to keep their sources private because then they wouldn’t get info but that’s a pretty easy out to never have to provide you with any facts.
1334316403373953024 2020-12-03 09:59:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy So what burden of proof or legitimate evidence is there against Trump’s children committing crimes?   No one here is arguing. I’m providing you with information you clearly had no idea about.   I feel sorry for ppl like you that are so easily manipulated by the media.
1334315656531984384 2020-12-03 09:56:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Zero names all speculation in every one of these articles about him pardoning his kids.. “we’ve heard” “multiple sources” “the public should expect”.   Why do you believe this but not fellow Americans putting their lives on the line about the election fraud they witnessed?  https://t.co/KMhy63mjvS
1334314374203199491 2020-12-03 09:51:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Again you are assuming that these “sources” are legit. No signed affidavits no names yet you believe it?   The election fraud case has more actual ppl involved that have testified but you believe what the media tells you while offering NO NAMES?
1334313906072743936 2020-12-03 09:50:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Are you implying that Trump’s children are guilty of federal crimes? I’m sure this “claim” was by some anonymous source with no name and you believe it, but ppl coming forward with signed affidavits are liars? 😂  Ever notice they NEVER give you names of these “people”?  https://t.co/zrWDF7TtHu
1334312345137414144 2020-12-03 09:43:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Who’s telling you he’s “considering” this?   There’s a huge difference between the two. I didn’t make any claims I said Dominion could have explained these concerns away instead they didn’t show up.    How is that similar to Trump “considering” pardons for his children?
1334308850128719872 2020-12-03 09:29:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 If we were like the left we’d just get a box of ballots and..  https://t.co/XHkrWv1GTO
1334307759643246594 2020-12-03 09:25:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy The president can not “preemptively” pardon anyone. You know that right?   They have to be charged with a federal crime before a pardon can be issued by the president.
1334307286391513090 2020-12-03 09:23:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy When did I say it was evidence of wrong doing?   You do realize that Trump can’t pardon a person that isn’t accused of a federal crime right? Now tell me what federal crimes are you suspecting the Trump children have committed? Talk about rabbit holes.  https://t.co/8xJrw1fNYH
1334306374365265921 2020-12-03 09:20:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy They testified in a hearing with Republicans because like I stated before courts refused to take the case. If you want these ppl to go in front of a judge and give sworn statements I’m sure they would.   I listened to 6+ hrs of testimony in AZ that was being live streamed, you?
1334303452227256320 2020-12-03 09:08:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Tell me why Dominion execs failed to show up for their hearing? They could have easily explained away a lot of these concerns instead they lawyered up. Why are they so concerned?    https://t.co/mqaTBdgK9T
1334303017353371648 2020-12-03 09:06:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Again I wouldn’t disclose actual evidence until a court date is set in order to protect the information that’s being released.   Have the jury selected and sequestered and a gag order in place. Can’t do any of that until a judge takes the case.
1334302464611241984 2020-12-03 09:04:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy No reason for a ballot counter to calculate anything or to have fractions in its software.   Dems complained about Dominion and all its issues all of a sudden I’m the one who’s gone down the rabbit hole? 😂   https://t.co/Maf9iuwj7E
1334300871975346177 2020-12-03 08:58:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Obviously you didn’t listen to everyone. There were professionals that testified about the Dominion software as well did you not see that or too brain dead to understand what they were saying?   It was mentioned that these are counters they tabulate 1 = 1.
1334300324211740672 2020-12-03 08:56:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy It’s really not my fault that you are too ignorant to know wtf you are even saying so instead you go with the “rabbit hole” theory so you don’t look stupid. Yet did anyway.
1334300006010900481 2020-12-03 08:54:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy You: Bet they won’t say this under oath!!   Me: Affidavits are sworn statements given under oath.   Also you: You’re so far down the rabbit hole to realize it. 🥴  Me: *provides definition* 👇🏼  https://t.co/lXZtCOc6Ow
1334223226835144704 2020-12-03 03:49:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @guy_with_dog @bear2_trip @JohnParshon @BeardyMan1983 @BlairBrandt @sethjlevy Ummm you know affidavits are statements taken under oath right?  They have 100s.   Now tell me why the judges aren’t willing to give them a court date to hear them out under oath dipsh*t?
1334222577623990272 2020-12-03 03:47:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @ryanleone85 @EShisko @MWhoppz @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Your ignorance is astounding.
1334221711911227394 2020-12-03 03:43:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @ryanleone85 @EShisko @MWhoppz @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria You clearly don’t know how lawyers work. Do you think you release all your evidence before a hearing? 😂  Please tell me that’s not what you thought? In order to protect evidence you have to have a judge willing to allow the case. What are these judges scared of?
1334221261266776064 2020-12-03 03:41:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EShisko @AliceRoscoe @ryanleone85 @MWhoppz @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Lawyers don’t have to release their evidence until a hearing is allowed.   If these judges aren’t willing to hear out the case then can you truly say that there isn’t any proof? No because that’s not how it works you dip.
1334220928272584705 2020-12-03 03:40:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EShisko @AliceRoscoe @ryanleone85 @MWhoppz @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria They aren’t being destroyed by the courts.  You don’t release all your info so that the media can put it out there. That jeopardizes the court hearing.   You want exact proof tell the judges to allow a hearing so that they can release the proof.
1334198506429448193 2020-12-03 02:11:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @ryanleone85 @EShisko @MWhoppz @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Well if the court would give them a chance they would be used there nimrod.   So you assume when cases are thrown out that’s it? 😂 Just say you don’t care about fraud because Biden won. Because that wasn’t the case when you dopes were claiming Russia helped Trump for 4 yrs.
1334195839481249792 2020-12-03 02:00:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s be honest the Hammer &amp; Sickle have claimed more lives than the Swastika ever did. If we truly want to deal in facts.

1334168254944739328 2020-12-03 00:11:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 Yea I don’t believe Biden was more popular than Obama in 2008. Trump is more popular than Obama in the Republican Party but lost to Joe Biden?   Make it make sense..  https://t.co/1QjGX0uGhd

1334164116039090176 2020-12-02 23:54:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The claim: Trump lost because he’s hated by lots of Republicans.   Me: Trump has an approval rating of 90% among the Republican Party. Here 👇🏼  Not my fault you’re too dumb to understand this..  https://t.co/sSFAS3I3UR

Did they lie like Adam Schiff did about Russian Collusion?   Affidavits are evidence in a court of law you libturd. Obviously you have no clue how the law works.
1334024188823126016 2020-12-02 14:38:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The fact you tits still believe the media and their “anonymous sources” but don’t give credence to witnesses of potential election fraud shows how much TDS you fkers have.

1333977743772450818 2020-12-02 11:34:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria But wait you said the citizens paid for it didn’t you?   Now you are claiming his donors paid for it? If they created a fund for the process and it’s via donations tf does that matter? Biden created a fund for transition funds like he didn’t get donations of almost $1B. 😂
1333977027343306752 2020-12-02 11:31:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria The witnesses were willing to sign affidavits that are under oath. They were willing to expose themselves and speak under oath on what they saw and experienced knowing the left could threaten and assault them for it.
1333976275724091395 2020-12-02 11:28:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria They attempted to have it dealt with in court, but cases were tossed out by partisan judges. Why? What are they afraid of? Not like they haven’t had court hearings w/less evidence and witnesses than what we have for this case.   It’s cool tho just take it to the Supreme Court.
1333975509806452736 2020-12-02 11:25:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MWhoppz @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria So a laughing emoji is the extent of your response? 😂 Figures you had nothing else.
1333975232177029123 2020-12-02 11:24:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @anasofiredon @MsCristinaDrake Ellen already played a straight person who got pregnant. She’s also played a lesbian. So now Elliot gets to portray a man? Fun times..   So please never complain about a CIS person playing any role they fkin want if it’s ok for Elliot now.
1333925386665619456 2020-12-02 08:06:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Thank you to @Project_Veritas for proving @CNN is #fakenews and Zucker is a pos.
1333920040521908224 2020-12-02 07:44:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Elliot” is now officially part of the patriarchy.
1333919157121736705 2020-12-02 07:41:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Cyborg1966 My first question as a tourist would be why is the island empty? Also why is there rumbling and is that a volcano?
1333892991652569089 2020-12-02 05:57:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Liar..
1333891428213157888 2020-12-02 05:51:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The fact you believed the government would actually help you after just using #BLM to fund their elections is fkin hilarious. #suckers.
1333887049120718849 2020-12-02 05:33:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you feel you have to be a “man” in order to be sexually attracted to females then YOU might be homophobic.
1333883515901865984 2020-12-02 05:19:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So their mission is clear. Erase women and expose any existing females to more danger and injury.   https://t.co/WcWFjHwZMJ
1333883038460043266 2020-12-02 05:17:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tamburlaine01 It goes without saying that if you want to defend Neera outing a woman publicly who claimed sexual harassment against a male buddy of hers then #metoo is bullshit.
1333881894698577920 2020-12-02 05:13:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe the left shouldn’t have tried to silence Greenwald and let him report the news? Because I’m here for all of this.  😂🍿  https://t.co/C9dTcXg68B
1333881248696078336 2020-12-02 05:10:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @triton6346 Trans people want to erase homosexuality is how I see it.
1333880740904255488 2020-12-02 05:08:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well this just got very interesting. Hey those that still watch CNN let’s see how you feel after you find out how CNN really feels.
1333874492603473920 2020-12-02 04:43:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is being a lesbian just not as cool anymore?
1333870945732161537 2020-12-02 04:29:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Oh witnesses also claimed that they saw Trump being crossed out on the top of the ballot and changed to Biden and having to cure the ballot after. So did they call every person to ask if they made that correction?   Yea I prefer to check, democracy you know.
1333870099451691008 2020-12-02 04:26:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Wasn’t the Russia a bomb yet here you are supporting the democrats and their losing 14 seats in the house. 😂  But ok.
1333869740444459008 2020-12-02 04:25:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Trump was charged $3M for the recount. Who told you that tax payers paid that?  🤣 Oh I forget you have TDS therefore can’t look up information and just repeat what you are told like the good lil sheep you are.  https://t.co/YVGlBJ1qn0
1333868835611451394 2020-12-02 04:21:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliceRoscoe @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria The problem is you believe the ballots that were recounted were actually for the ppl that the voter actually voted for.   Yesterday witnesses came forward claiming they saw a vote go into the machine for one person and be printed for another.   So that’s a problem.
1333863931564093445 2020-12-02 04:01:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EShisko @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria When did you decide to drop it? 4 yrs later when you think you’ve finally won an election? 🤣  We aren’t sore losers we are concerned Americans who have listened to professionals &amp; witnesses &amp; read filings that claim this election was tampered with. If you don’t care just stfu.
1333825810403246080 2020-12-02 01:30:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Remember the machines are supposed to TABULATE not CALCULATE. There is a difference.
1333825587983523840 2020-12-02 01:29:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Why would they drop out if all these questions can be easily explained by them?   Are they worried about going under oath? I bet they didn’t expect programmers to speak about what they saw about fractions of votes in the programming.
1333822212869025793 2020-12-02 01:16:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker They should ask questions. My question is why aren’t election officials there to explain the concerns these ppl have after seeing what they saw?   Why didn’t Dominion show up to their hearing to provide an explanation?
1333813265072156674 2020-12-02 00:40:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These fascists domestic terrorists are upset the “win” is being questioned by witnesses. Start arresting these criminals @SenTedCruz
1333811387349385220 2020-12-02 00:33:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MWhoppz @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Clearly you didn’t. 🤣 But Im sure you believed Russia collusion with ZERO evidence huh?
1333804283804876801 2020-12-02 00:04:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Cyborg1966 Then that was a choice wasn’t it?
1333804000190185474 2020-12-02 00:03:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier They needed a word that rhymed.
1333801983552090113 2020-12-01 23:55:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #BejingBiden is all they wanted.
1333801773178388491 2020-12-01 23:54:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ryanleone85 @TRASTORN1890 @krystafauria Did you listen to witness election testimony yesterday? If not then you don’t know what you’re talking about.
1333801481007362059 2020-12-01 23:53:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Notice how they are “certifying” knowing damn well there are witnesses and inconsistencies with the voting? I hope their respective legislatures do the right thing since their is clearly doubt about the results after listening to witnesses yesterday.
1333648743174848513 2020-12-01 13:46:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 It is very cruel.
1333645583731462144 2020-12-01 13:34:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They rather be in the arms of their loved ones, so let them ffs!
1333641172728782848 2020-12-01 13:16:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You needed 71 officers for this?!

1333635319879532544 2020-12-01 12:53:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The media finally saying what Trump had been saying for months about China. #ChinaLiedPeopleDied

1333631415917842433 2020-12-01 12:38:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Taxes is money the government took from billionaires that they are getting back. Student loans are debt someone decided to get themselves into without being able to pay for it. HUGE DIFFERENCE you commie turd.
1333630738185428992 2020-12-01 12:35:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes it’s true you nor Joe have a brain.
1333630542835695616 2020-12-01 12:34:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t think any republican is out trying to cancel Neera. Republicans are just stating the obvious and are allowed an opinion you fascist pos.
1333628705252335617 2020-12-01 12:27:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How can you charge ppl over a volcanic eruption killing ppl?
1333626244940742656 2020-12-01 12:17:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Isn’t it weird how all these so called “transphobic attacks” always seem to happen in deep blue cities? 🤔

1333617078352310273 2020-12-01 11:41:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco I’d squeal.
1333612123461619714 2020-12-01 11:21:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s funny they can’t come up with their own sh*t.

1333611443950784521 2020-12-01 11:18:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thesuku @AlannaBrett @BeardyMan1983 @taurusangel26 @flint_sonny @DashaBurns I want to see the links they are talking about in particular.   Which they can easily provide if they’ve looked them up.   I try not to make claims like that unless I can provide proof. Is that not a leftist thing?
1333610579169140736 2020-12-01 11:15:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I melt. ♥️
1333495389119344640 2020-12-01 03:37:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sure that will change if Biden gets into office. Which I’m guessing they are banking on. How dare Trump admin promote democracy in HK.
1333495027335450624 2020-12-01 03:36:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JannaCalifornia @JayLionel7 @RSBNetwork @realDonaldTrump I’m sure you voted for Obama too and he lied often about big things.   • spying on Americans  • ACA  • Iran  • Afghanistan • Libya  • Snowden
1333494585243234304 2020-12-01 03:34:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JayLionel7 @RSBNetwork @realDonaldTrump They are testifying to what they already took an oath for you tit. Affidavits are sworn statements you fkin lawn flamingo.
1333494241067032576 2020-12-01 03:32:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you can watch this you should.. I don’t care if leftists are saying “tHiS iS sPecUlATiOn!” If this had happened to democrats they’d be singing a different tune. This is more evidence than @RepAdamSchiff and Dems ever had on Russia Collusion.
1333493154947891200 2020-12-01 03:28:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer Yea but your dick doesn’t have any bones, it’s just muscles and tendons. 🤣

1333259656362278914 2020-11-30 12:00:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird how all of a sudden we are Americans, when Trump said the same shit ppl like Biden called him a white supremacist.
1333259222511874050 2020-11-30 11:59:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Alana Gibson”? “She” resembles Jim Morrison.

1333219961964150785 2020-11-30 09:23:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Omg this tit trusts @neeratanden?! Like I said before Biden is just trying to put establishment swamp rats back in positions of power.

1333202516088033281 2020-11-30 08:13:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrownTownClownT @RandPaul Data dumps means the counting was already done. When you have a data dump of 100k votes for just one candidate that does seem like a problem.

1333191150128168960 2020-11-30 07:28:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why would she have to rig an election she NEVER believed she would lose dumbass?   After Trump won it proved they needed a real back up plan in case it happened again.

I usually find a million different ways to say something before I even say it, but usually but when I’m fed up I’m fed up and it can get ugly.
1333165214896779264 2020-11-30 05:45:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Wolf_of_Christ @KristinBoymom Oh I know I can be a bitch. I can kinda respect ppl that call me out on it, honestly.   Most ppl don’t have those kinds of balls because of how they expect I might react.   But don’t call me a bitch just because I hurt YOUR feelings.
1333162554340691969 2020-11-30 05:34:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Wolf_of_Christ @KristinBoymom I don’t mind truth and to be honest some ppl really need to hear it before it’s too late. If doing that makes you and asshole than it makes me one too.   Everyone is jaded by life experiences.

1332883601931726848 2020-11-29 11:06:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Seriously who wants to see this shit out on the field during half time?   https://t.co/CChmPZd2ox
1332883287472107521 2020-11-29 11:05:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You don’t fking say?! Unfortunately the left doesn’t give two sh*ts if ppl are having mental breakdowns as long as they can control ppl.
1332850977100107778 2020-11-29 08:56:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SullyBobbi Lmao. Wow.
1332850750402138115 2020-11-29 08:55:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @StormWall82 And democrats ruining ppls lives and voting for a dementia patient because they needed Trump out of office.   Here’s the thing how does Trump lose and we get 11 new Republicans in the house so far?   And guess what? 👇🏼  https://t.co/ktDETpIOU5
1332847842101084161 2020-11-29 08:44:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You mean like when Democrats looked for evidence when they initiated an investigation into Trump? Oh and when Adam Schiff claimed he had proof and didn’t have sh*t? 🤣
1332847347399749632 2020-11-29 08:42:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> To you leftist hacks: Stop trying to tell us what WE need to do while ppl like YOU didn’t move on after 4 fkin years. Be prepared for the hell you sowed.
1332846573802328064 2020-11-29 08:39:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> White supremacists at it again. *smh*
1332844901294227456 2020-11-29 08:32:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl are telling us something about losing? 👇🏼🤣  https://t.co/cU0FUquFd2
1332843991428001792 2020-11-29 08:29:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No one wants the Kaeperbitch drama.
1332799411546714115 2020-11-29 05:31:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well of course he is. Because China hates freedom and they have to tag you like the cattle they think you are.   https://t.co/V1v6ycC9CN
1332798998927847433 2020-11-29 05:30:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker They aren’t assuming when multiple ppl say they saw marked Trump ballots put into the Biden bin.   They aren’t assuming when they were kicked out of a facility claiming “water damage” while others stayed behind and there was zero supervision.
1332798531887714304 2020-11-29 05:28:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That means the ppl reporting the news are deranged and clearly have a political bias. They haven’t covered the president accurately for 4 fkin years.

1332794581654458368 2020-11-29 05:12:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker When a state has Biden ahead by 4000 votes I definitely want to make sure all votes were valid and signatures were verified after reading the claims by witnesses in Sidney Powell’s filing.
1332794226430468096 2020-11-29 05:11:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Big picture is states certify on different days. Why are they trying to certify before that and pushing that nothing can be done because they already certified?   For someone who claims to seek truth you really don’t stick to facts.
1332791419325403136 2020-11-29 05:00:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker It’s mathematically impossible for 100k ballots to come in for one candidate and none for the other.   Do you remember this? Why would a county clerk claim you don’t need an ID to vote absentee? Do you see a problem with that or not?  https://t.co/Tramc6poOb
1332788797113835521 2020-11-29 04:49:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Tell me do you honestly believe that there was zero fraud in the 2020 election?  Do you believe that a ballot dump of 100k came in ONLY for Biden and none for Trump?

1332771244379316224 2020-11-29 03:40:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Here is the actual issue in Milwaukee. The county clerk told ppl they could claim “indefinitely confined” status due to the pandemic in a FB post. The Supreme Court barred him from doing so after (R) said that was incorrect. The law is clear not just anyone can claim that status.  https://t.co/7HDfaSKbmI

1332763485726502914 2020-11-29 03:09:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GmanisQ @joshdcaplan @lsferguson Maybe Dems shouldn’t have pushed baseless claims about the president being a Russian asset, called his supporters racists and committed fraud in order to get him out of office at any cost?   You reap what you sow. Except WE actually use the constitution and law to fk you.
1332749715910299653 2020-11-29 02:14:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is absolutely true. Family first.
1332747683329568769 2020-11-29 02:06:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @JackPosobiec Yep but they aren’t talking about Biden or Kamala. They rather report on Ivanka’s farts in college and Trump answering his first question in 3 weeks.

1332547820214046731 2020-11-28 12:52:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> More Top Flight news..
1332513614213726208 2020-11-28 10:36:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TruePatriot2A Yep.
1332512026908758016 2020-11-28 10:29:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheMSMaquis Yea @JoeBiden can fk off.
1332511948898852869 2020-11-28 10:29:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TruePatriot2A Completely agree. Truth is we take in less Mexicans than we do others from countries below Mexico. Who’s first stop to seek asylum would be Mexico not the US.
1332511498338402305 2020-11-28 10:27:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Truthseeker126 @bgoum They made it way too obvious with those ballot dumps that were 100k for Biden and 0 for Trump. That’s statistically impossible.
1332511121274638337 2020-11-28 10:26:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheMSMaquis Yea it’s bullshit. Can’t go shopping for a country to claim asylum in. I’m glad they are being deported. They betrayed our laws when they decided to claim asylum 12 countries away from their own.
1332510809113542657 2020-11-28 10:25:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TruePatriot2A Exactly. I’m not ok with ppl just deciding they should be allowed to seek asylum wherever the fk they want. Send their asses to Canada then. Canada wouldn’t take his ass either.
1332510459811938305 2020-11-28 10:23:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheMSMaquis Why not go to the UK or France? No instead they come to the US-Mexico border? Im sorry but someone seeking asylum doesn’t usually have a 12 country option list. They are lucky if they can escape to the next country over.
1332510047247552512 2020-11-28 10:22:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How can you claim asylum in a country ppl claim daily is racist and also 12 countries away from your original homeland?   Asylum seekers should seek asylum in at least the next country over not fkin 12 countries later.
1332509529129422850 2020-11-28 10:20:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I always find this very interesting... “after escaping through a dozen countries and claiming asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border”. Why couldn’t he find asylum in any of the other 12 countries he went thru including Mexico?
1332428303680954370 2020-11-28 04:57:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BLaw You want to go the Supreme Court route I guess.. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1332428118427013121 2020-11-28 04:56:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Supreme Court it is.. Why do you have to find “wide spread election fraud”? Any election fraud concerns should be looked into. I’d feel the same if it was Biden making the claim with any type of evidence.
1332402441107632128 2020-11-28 03:14:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Burlesque @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Because they work in mobs, but single one out and they have ZERO chance against a LION. They’ll be shredded.   If the LIONS worked in mobs like hyenas it would be quite a different story toots. You want a mob of lions after you?

1332377631124123648 2020-11-28 01:35:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @paws1012 @washingtonpost Because in case you had no idea that’s how we determine presidents in this country via electoral college.
1332207080971923457 2020-11-27 14:18:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Doesn’t want to say that it might not even happen at this point.

1332195449193734145 2020-11-27 13:32:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @toad_is @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Not sure how I played myself. You stalkers always check ppls followers when making your assumptions.   Again Trudeau and Obama are globalists whether they are or aren’t attached to Soros doesn’t matter to me. They are fkin globalists. Why would you say they are controlled?  https://t.co/1CvSHN7PMT
1332194543131787265 2020-11-27 13:28:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @toad_is @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Then what “friends” are you talking about? You made an accusation about “friends” I have.   So go ahead tell me which friends you’re referring to..
1332194246028234752 2020-11-27 13:27:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @toad_is @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 So wait are you suggesting that because Soros is a Jew he can’t possibly be a bad person?
1332191096378589189 2020-11-27 13:14:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @toad_is @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Just because I follow ppl on twitter doesn’t mean we are “friends”. Nor does it mean we believe the same thing. This isn’t an echo chamber and we disagree on plenty of things.   It’s more Nazi like to push fear of a virus to try to control ppl to give up their freedoms.
1332190444969545732 2020-11-27 13:12:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What corrupt about this.. oh that they didn’t side with a COVID NAZI like Cuomo?  https://t.co/DPTFCdVO4Q
1332190183706431488 2020-11-27 13:11:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why would the truth need to be paywalled? Shouldn’t the truth be free?
1332187046786461700 2020-11-27 12:58:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @toad_is @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Sorry, but globalists aren’t one race or people. They vary. Trudeau and Obama are also globalists I don’t believe either of them are Jewish. Anyone wanting a NWO are globalists.   So your “right wing dog whistle” bs kinda falls flat on its face.
1332184452559106049 2020-11-27 12:48:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Doubtful.
1332178558005886976 2020-11-27 12:24:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker No it’s about fraud in our elections.
1332178228945977346 2020-11-27 12:23:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Do whatever you want and I hope others do the same. ✌🏼
1332178022980481025 2020-11-27 12:22:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Actually America can’t make that choice for me. I make my own choices it’s the freedom granted to me by the constitution of the USA.   Those same freedoms allow you to do whatever you want including locking yourself up in your home and waiting it all out.
1332175349564792832 2020-11-27 12:12:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Freedom is living. Again if you don’t want your freedom or feel you don’t need it go ahead lock yourself up and stay away from everyone else.
1332174519113379844 2020-11-27 12:08:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Actually fighting NAZI like tactics is definitely important to me. I’m sure ppl who joined Hitler made the same arguments you are making now.   Nazis: It’s ok if you take ppls freedoms because it’s for the greater good.   This is interesting...
1332172632041480192 2020-11-27 12:01:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 No it’s political when ppl in government are using it to control ppl. By making up laws outside of the legislature to get ppl to do what they want while they do whatever they want.   New Zealand has COVID camps putting the healthy in quarantine.    https://t.co/3GRydPgm8Z
1332171652063367168 2020-11-27 11:57:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually that’s awesome thanks for sharing. A president that doesn’t give a fk what you idiots think about something as petty as a desk.

1332170487548452864 2020-11-27 11:52:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Yea I’m sorry, but we’ve never considered locking down and quarantining the healthy even when we got hit with H1N1 and the possibility of an Ebola breakout.   Again open your eyes. This was all political and ppl like you bought their authoritarian bs hook line and sinker.

I said statistically it’s more likely to kill you than COVID especially if you’re older and I provided you the proof. Pneumonia can also be caused by a virus like the flu.

1332159952413093888 2020-11-27 11:10:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 There is no distortion with what Trump has stated. The mortality rate of COVID is lower than that of pneumonia yet somehow you believe COVID is worse. Again do your own research.  https://t.co/F50oEBxfzd
1332158227056783361 2020-11-27 11:04:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 You call them names and vilify them in an attempt to force ppl to do what you want. It’s an Alinsky tactic. You agree with Americans being arrested for not following the COVID rules that authoritarians who are paid via our taxes are suggesting. All while..  https://t.co/tXYyYU5S5E
1332155989961764864 2020-11-27 10:55:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 No it makes you selfish to demand that other ppl live exactly like you do.   Are you employed? Do you have a business?
1332155778015236096 2020-11-27 10:54:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Who makes the decision about what’s responsible and what isn’t? Do you think these ppl were being responsible? If not why aren’t you attacking them for it and calling them names too? Afraid you’ll be attacked and called a white supremacist and doxxed for it?  https://t.co/BCSIvTBj52
1332154657150439424 2020-11-27 10:49:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 What if you are asymptomatic and have been spreading it to others this whole time because you have no symptoms and have been cautious. Does that make you selfish?
1332154337527701504 2020-11-27 10:48:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 You could get COVID too even after following all the precautions you claim help. What would that mean?   Have you even been tested?
1332153305288511489 2020-11-27 10:44:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Again you’re being the selfish one for not wanting ppl to make their own choices. You can stay inside. Your choice.   Ppl getting infected will happen no matter how much you try to prevent it. There's also evidence that exposure to cold temperatures suppresses the immune system.
1332152272382377984 2020-11-27 10:40:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 And that’s pretty selfish of you to say.  Who does that? Just because we don’t agree I wouldn’t say I hope you get a virus. Tf is wrong with you?
1332151938641653761 2020-11-27 10:39:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Of course it matters. To suggest the survival rate of COVID doesn’t matter to ppl is ridiculous.   And it’s selfish of you to demand healthy ppl stay locked up and miserable because less than 1% of the population is dying.   Pneumonia has a higher mortality rate than COVID.  https://t.co/F7VATxSftU
1332150284835930112 2020-11-27 10:32:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r Right? They probably abuse animals and have bodies buried in their crawl space.
1332149302701948928 2020-11-27 10:28:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 That’s you bud. Everything you’ve said is SELFISH. I’m actually about freedom and ppl being allowed to do what they want unlike you, you COVID NAZI.
1332148911784431616 2020-11-27 10:27:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You need to see a therapist because having the time to make a poster like that should put you on a terrorist list, you obviously have serious issues.
1332148138522546176 2020-11-27 10:24:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Imagine claiming it’s selfish to live your life and provide for your family because some COVID NAZI says so.   The #COVIDIOTS are the ones who are afraid of a virus that has a 99% survival rate.
1332147469526867968 2020-11-27 10:21:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anschutz2012 @BowserBandit  https://t.co/T3FVcqyiZV
1332146606980751360 2020-11-27 10:17:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Actually do you know what the term selfish means? It sounds like you are being selfish demanding others do as you say. Where’s your consideration for others scenario virtue signaler?  https://t.co/ky3wncOBsm
1332144973819506688 2020-11-27 10:11:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alphabreaker4 @GoodBoy10204293 Holy shit. And these asshoes have the nerve to say anything about Trump pardoning ppl?   @realDonaldTrump time to pardon Assange.
1332144179749609474 2020-11-27 10:08:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So this is odd.. I want to see how many ppl Obama pardoned since the left is bitching yet again about Trump pardoning ppl and I wanted to click on the Pew Search link.. now it doesn’t exist?  https://t.co/lGwvF6aJxa
1332142243616944128 2020-11-27 10:00:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m laughing with you.
1332141912388554752 2020-11-27 09:59:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He can pardon whoever tf he wants. It’s in the constitution you twit.
1332141086551150592 2020-11-27 09:55:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess you ignored the @SidneyPowell1 filing from yesterday in Georgia and Michigan about fraud supported by signed affidavits and you call yourself a reporter?  https://t.co/bMOoSqnxSH
1332139267292741633 2020-11-27 09:48:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl @alexmillny @rothys I heart them even more now.
1332139152997982208 2020-11-27 09:48:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @yashar Good. Ppl fighting for freedom, resisting lockdowns and made up rules should be commended.
1332138775888052225 2020-11-27 09:46:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Asking for the president to be respected is now deranged?   I guess when ppl demand I respect other ppl’s pronouns I’ll make sure to remind them that’s just deranged.
1332136506329243649 2020-11-27 09:37:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @charlie_niemi She obviously wants to have her brother in law doxxed and harassed for this crime. 😂
1332135835114688512 2020-11-27 09:35:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Y’all wanted EQUITY.. here you have it. You can have a losing record and still make the playoffs. 😂
1332135061857026049 2020-11-27 09:32:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He answered because he wanted to. YOU had nothing to do with it.
1332134744474075136 2020-11-27 09:30:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl @alexmillny I ♥️ your flats.
1332134346187104256 2020-11-27 09:29:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually @JennaEllisEsq is a constitutional lawyer nothing like Charlie or Tomi.
1332131734394081280 2020-11-27 09:18:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Make it happen! 😂
1332130123743576064 2020-11-27 09:12:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 I work in a hospital and mine is doing just fine in fact we haven’t had a spike enough to overwhelm our hospital. Hospitalizations go up in the cold months that’s just common knowledge if you’ve ever worked in healthcare.
1332129725536292864 2020-11-27 09:10:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 The ppl who aren’t helping are ill informed tots like yourself who just runs with the CHICKEN LITTLE sky is falling theory because all you hear is COVID cases are rising. Tell me how often do you hear about those who have recovered from COVID on your news station. Now ask why?
1332129316201631746 2020-11-27 09:09:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 The virus needs to spread. That’s the only way ppl can build an immunity to it. I’ll remind you that while the CASES have gone up the mortality rate has decreased and continues to decrease. The first row are deaths from COVID. The second row is overall deaths.  https://t.co/qudx2ZfeUu
1332127844508475392 2020-11-27 09:03:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @GeraltofPDX1 What do you mean by YOU TRUMPERS? Does it bother you that we want to protect ppls personal freedoms and the constitution and you don’t?
1332127327669522438 2020-11-27 09:01:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @BowserBandit Typical of these kind of ppl who like to push everything off as some right wing conspiracy theory and bring up Q to justify their inability to think logically.
1332126967324237824 2020-11-27 08:59:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @GeraltofPDX1 Again FREEDOM is what our country is built on. If you do not like personal freedom feel free to stay locked in your home while these ppl tell you to stay indoors because COVID is that bad. Obviously you didn’t know about Amazon when you claimed it was a conspiracy theory.  https://t.co/poHlaiTRq1
1332126101817106433 2020-11-27 08:56:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 You realize that viruses spread and it’s what they do right?   Or are you intellectually dishonest all the time?
1332125726493925380 2020-11-27 08:54:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 Yes you are a hypocrite. They aren’t social distanced and they clearly have zero issue with social distancing. They broke all the rules you seem to care about why don’t you go call them out see what happens. Also here are Trump supporters with masks and outside.   Same?  https://t.co/h1eBcm6BaL
1332124249281085442 2020-11-27 08:49:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @GeraltofPDX1 But then again I don’t expect ppl like you who support NAZI tactics and watch CNN to understand how important FREEDOM is or what’s actually going on.
1332122868566478848 2020-11-27 08:43:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @GeraltofPDX1 Do you read often. It’s a proven fact that amazon is profiting from COVID lockdowns and small businesses are being destroyed over it.   You are very ill informed.   I don’t think this is a conspiracy theory..  https://t.co/1TTn2BMTGy
1332121981311827970 2020-11-27 08:40:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit @Anschutz2012 I’m guessing protestors and leftists did all that while they were protesting and cheering over a Biden win?   Oops. I guess not.. look at all that social distancing.. oh and some even passed around and shared a champagne bottle they all drank from. That’s safe af.  https://t.co/KB3yiER6KK
1332119902434385920 2020-11-27 08:31:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit A packed room is the difference you say? So if they hold their church gatherings outside in front of your house on a loud speaker with hundreds outside you’d be ok with that?
1332109822318108673 2020-11-27 07:51:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit Ppl put their lives at risk every day. How do you plan on preventing ppl from dying? If these decide to go to a church and wear a mask or not what business is that of yours? Are you attending? What if I said attending a riot ups your chances of COVID should I say you can’t go?
1332109058959020033 2020-11-27 07:48:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hallelujah.

1332107404222160896 2020-11-27 07:42:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RobbieFett These ppl just have to vilify the opposition. I wish Tulsi was more conservative she would be an absolute powerhouse if she ran as a Republican.
1332107082548461568 2020-11-27 07:40:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These authoritarian pieces of shiet really do come in all flavors. Where do fetuses belong if not in a uterus you misogynistic beotch?
1332106672454529024 2020-11-27 07:39:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BowserBandit That’s a sexist term.. thems the rules.   Oh she cares about human lives because she believes they have the freedom to make their own decisions. Plus she respects the constitution that states you can’t treat churches differently than protestors or rioters.
1332105937553817600 2020-11-27 07:36:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RobbieFett Imagine it? 😂
1332105715234684928 2020-11-27 07:35:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RobbieFett And he definitely isn’t funny. Imagine thinking 73M people don’t matter to your comedic career? 🤣
1332105461894500352 2020-11-27 07:34:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The comments are pure AIDS..

1332104705359581185 2020-11-27 07:31:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actual sexism exposed.. seethe you pos.
1332104333492674560 2020-11-27 07:29:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This isn’t remotely funny.. considering leftists do in fact stalk ppl because they have nothing better to do.
1332102429777674240 2020-11-27 07:22:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jaywwalker1 @JoeBiden Also this is the part the leftists probably didn’t want you to read. It’s fkin unconstitutional and not equal representation under the law to single out one group while allowing others. So fk you, you fkin fascist!  https://t.co/e0Ldf3gkUO
1332101549825220608 2020-11-27 07:18:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jaywwalker1 @JoeBiden This just proves who’s for religious liberty in this country and who isn’t.   “The court apparently divided 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissenting.”
1332101181577981952 2020-11-27 07:17:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jaywwalker1 Fk your feelings.  https://t.co/kYruz0JBNg
1332101008630059008 2020-11-27 07:16:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jaywwalker1 Sorry but no one is obligated to give money. So tell me why can’t churches get donations while @JoeBiden is asking for donations to fund his transition?   Fkin hypocrite losers
1332100142204211200 2020-11-27 07:13:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let freedom ring you anti-constitutional authoritarian pos.
1332098063519813633 2020-11-27 07:05:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If would mean I’m getting my own damn money back from the government that they already take from me to pay for you miserable fks.
1332097618692825091 2020-11-27 07:03:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because this shit is so much better.  https://t.co/UxrWKFnvhl

1332074575518072834 2020-11-27 05:31:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How activist intellectuals play a large part in authoritarian regimes.. because they make ppl believe they are too dumb to know what’s best for them. It’s why Trump was happy with getting the so called “uneducated” vote.  https://t.co/yjQ7pazx9T
1332073514229137409 2020-11-27 05:27:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jasonintrator Also worth noting..    https://t.co/MDP0YA1yZ9
1332073161047719936 2020-11-27 05:26:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> She’s considered an intellectual by whom? I’m sure that’s subjective.
1332070617353338880 2020-11-27 05:15:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How about being thankful for the funds you get from the tax paying “colonists” while also not having to pay taxes of your own on this “colonial holiday”?
1332066466003263488 2020-11-27 04:59:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Today I’m thinking about the lawsuits @SidneyPowell1 dropped on election fraud. #TheKrakenHasBeenReleased  https://t.co/nfwozJxdIP

1332043543070707712 2020-11-27 03:28:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s tied to China and China is NOT what’s best for the United States.

1332039580992770048 2020-11-27 03:12:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 We said the left would use COVID to control the masses. Now they are actively arresting ppl who are just trying to make a living and stay in business. @JustinTrudeau is globalist trash.
1332039159049977856 2020-11-27 03:10:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cara_zen_tales Yes you can praise him from anywhere but the right to gather to worship is protected by the constitution. The Nazis attacked the churches as well and put ppl in camps for wanting to practice their religious freedom.
1332038658522681344 2020-11-27 03:08:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s compromised it’s the only logical reason out there.
1332038187053531136 2020-11-27 03:07:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @_Charlene_T You should. That kind of hair doesn’t look good on them and it’s racist.
1332038041259577344 2020-11-27 03:06:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Guess who was the first opposition to the Nazi regime?   “the churches as institutions provided the earliest and most enduring centres of systematic opposition to Nazi policies.”   And guess which side is against churches practicing during COVID and called ACB #AmyCovidBarrett?  https://t.co/xlNHj4bMw9
1332037374516154371 2020-11-27 03:03:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The Nazis/Brownshirts are gathering up and arresting their opposition.   “the Canadian historian Peter Hoffman counts unspecified "tens of thousands" in Nazi concentration camps who were either suspected of or actually engaged in opposition.”
1332033476288122880 2020-11-27 02:48:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s strange that this “scholar” asks a white person how they interrogated their whiteness in her work in Mexico.   I guess Elizabeth forgets there are a variety of Mexicans including these ones...  https://t.co/u8DMfV83eO

1332004546780950528 2020-11-27 00:53:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker I have no idea, but focusing on that is absolutely ridiculous. A misspelling doesn’t delegitimize the whole fkin list of accusations and witnesses listed in the document.
1332004160695255040 2020-11-27 00:51:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #TheKrakenHasBeenReleased and the only thing the Nazi left is focused on is the spelling of “district” on the filing instead of the crimes of fraud during our election in the document.  https://t.co/K7daoI8gGS

1331827428868538369 2020-11-26 13:09:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MartianAndy @BeardyMan1983 @JeffHokie @actevasm @userboxess 1 Im not refusing to listen to you. You keep saying certain things that just don’t make any sense whatsoever. Hormonal imbalances do not cause transgenderism. It causes depression and FEELING uneasy about things. Hormonal imbalances affect ppl yes, but doesn’t make you trans.
1331825566677229570 2020-11-26 13:02:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MartianAndy @actevasm @BeardyMan1983 @JeffHokie @userboxess What tf did I say? You claimed it was a hormonal imbalance I’ve actually been telling YOU this whole time it’s about how someone FEELS. Good grief do you fkin read? Your biological make up determines your physical body you tit.  https://t.co/yZdqEO6pAz
1331824075912605696 2020-11-26 12:56:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MartianAndy @BeardyMan1983 @JeffHokie @actevasm @userboxess Looks like you should really do some more research. In your attempt to defend trans people you have literally harmed them more by claiming their transgenderism is solely a hormone imbalance. If that were the case medications could fix it. It’s more complicated than that.

I’m telling you that trans men have to take hormones because they DO NOT produce enough T.   Simple fact. Gender dysphoria is psychological. It has to do with how they feel being in conflict with their biological reality.
1331820748147544066 2020-11-26 12:43:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MartianAndy @BeardyMan1983 @JeffHokie @actevasm @userboxess I’m not twisting anything. You keep mentioning trans men producing too much T. They don’t produce too much T that’s why they have to get on hormone therapy to increase the T.   If you are trying to use trans men producing too much T an example it’s a bad one.
1331820171552464898 2020-11-26 12:40:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MartianAndy @actevasm @BeardyMan1983 @JeffHokie @userboxess Gender dysphoria means there is mental conflict with what they know they are biologically. They claim they feel differently then their actual biological makeup.   The fact you don’t know this is odd.
1331819415050940417 2020-11-26 12:37:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MartianAndy @BeardyMan1983 @JeffHokie @actevasm @userboxess An imbalance in hormones doesn’t necessarily make someone trans.   Trans is part of the gender spectrum. In order to be trans you have to identify differently than your born sex. Hence the Trans aka “transformation” prefix.

1331807697243541504 2020-11-26 11:51:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well you’re a Biden supporter so it makes sense things like this would go over your head.

You ppl always do this..you attach some term like “existing” to vilify someone else over an opinion as if  that opinion has anything to do with not wanting ppl to exist.   Argue your point with facts or not at all.

An imbalance in hormones doesn’t determine your gender nor sex.   An anorexic can have a hormone imbalance. When they say they “feel” fat should I agree?

1331627920327012353 2020-11-25 23:56:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Obama really shouldn’t assume what he thinks he knows about the Hispanic culture.   Also Hispanics here legally do not support illegal immigration. We like law &amp; order as ppl who are religious. Why is Obama for the human trafficking of Hispanics across our border?
1331627297502216193 2020-11-25 23:54:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker They should have had more children.   Bringing in immigrants assuming they will work and help with labor shortage is really not ideal.
1331626785734201346 2020-11-25 23:52:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker That’s a different.. not the same as taking in immigrants that live differently and don’t assimilate to the rules or laws of your country.

Nothing is free when it comes to the government. Someone is always paying the government’s debt because the government makes NO MONEY they are societal leeches.

1331390255312695296 2020-11-25 08:12:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is still the Trump administration. If it hasn’t gone down it’s only because Republicans hold the senate and won seats in the house.   But if Joe Biden kicks down the country let’s see how the Dow does then.
1331389908926095363 2020-11-25 08:11:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Congratulations New Mexico on voting for this..  https://t.co/XLLHCRv3Wb
1331385647798517760 2020-11-25 07:54:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good he doesn’t need to answer any of your questions. Why don’t you go ask Biden about his fkin ice cream.
1331385433159135232 2020-11-25 07:53:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeBiden I hate fkin globalists.
1331385250757296128 2020-11-25 07:52:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How about you...  https://t.co/4PZjBc969S
1331378730220937219 2020-11-25 07:26:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> An update he deleted the video because he doesn’t trust YouTube to do the right thing.    https://t.co/RbqvyKSs7v
1331368808443887616 2020-11-25 06:47:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alsup_paige They have ruined so many things for ppl when it’s all they have left. Imagine being locked up in your home not being able to be with your family, not watch tv, now you can’t even play a fkin game. Geezus.   They are pushing ppl to depression and suicide hotlines. *smh*
1331365926554402816 2020-11-25 06:35:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe they just don’t see it being transphobic like you do and they have every right to play any game they fkin choose? You miserable fks try to ruin everything with your bs.
1331337221643792386 2020-11-25 04:41:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I think it’s a great idea. Why don’t you?
1331336403297308672 2020-11-25 04:38:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you gonna give your job at MSNBC to a black person Chris?   “Master race”? Tf you talking about?
1331336080965074945 2020-11-25 04:37:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You think you can call us names for 4 yrs, ruin ppls lives with your hate and now all of a sudden you want to go #ForwardTogether. 🖕🏼  https://t.co/TXNNtuWJxT
1331327921210834945 2020-11-25 04:04:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 @KyleKashuv I kinda like where I live. Not every city in CA is like San Franshithole and LA thank God! Lots of beautiful places and ppl here.
1331317047393804289 2020-11-25 03:21:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If this old ballsack is excited about Biden’s security team that tells you everything you need to know.
1331315611033497600 2020-11-25 03:15:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Thank you for letting us know the percentages of the fraud in this election by state.
1331314840338530306 2020-11-25 03:12:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ConservativeCD @Sony @PlayStation Imagine being such an asshoe that you think your 500 sub ass deserves free shit just because you’re black.   That’s some shit. They wanted EQUITY this whole time never EQUALITY guess Sony and PlayStation need to send all of us free consoles.
1331304354343645184 2020-11-25 02:31:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Thanksgiving and Christmas is when the cat lady Karens and Kens unite.
1331304060750757888 2020-11-25 02:29:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This video by Griffin Gaming calling out some black female gamer on her bs deserves some likes. The black female gamer thinks she deserves to get free shit from @Sony AND @PlayStation just because she’s black all while claiming she’s a shit gamer.   https://t.co/PfycrgzK4S
1331295258672467968 2020-11-25 01:54:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I love that he’s doing this to the media. He doesn’t have to answer any questions. Fk the media.
1331279306891296769 2020-11-25 00:51:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> New Republican women in the HOUSE are gonna be fun to watch.
1331268248780763141 2020-11-25 00:07:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left defending this man now? 😂  https://t.co/7NovZpreJA
1331266754769690624 2020-11-25 00:01:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Another brown shirt exposed..
1331266653670109185 2020-11-25 00:01:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Brown shirts exposed...
1331130622689964033 2020-11-24 15:00:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Gorgeous! 😘
1331128082330054658 2020-11-24 14:50:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because @govkristinoem isn’t a tyrannical pos like @GovWhitmer

1331126022742233088 2020-11-24 14:42:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m dead..
1331125691883024384 2020-11-24 14:41:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes because millionaire NBA players are the epitome of oppression.    https://t.co/oyn9Ci0WOg
1331125447980056578 2020-11-24 14:40:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So does this mean @JoeBiden needs to return the donations he received for his transition?    https://t.co/aooYeMv5ES
1331125062682824705 2020-11-24 14:38:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh so @EliStokols is all about bending over for everyone and selling out our country so that our “allies” can feel better. Fkin clown.
1331124447407874049 2020-11-24 14:36:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You know why undocumented women are scared? Because the MSM pushed that ppl would be deported under Trump even if they were here legally. So congratulations to the MSM for their hate and fear mongering. Also 👇🏼  https://t.co/yht0pEhhSg
1331122278050922499 2020-11-24 14:27:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t care about cases of COVID. I want to know how many ppl have died in these areas?
1331089798447079426 2020-11-24 12:18:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No one really likes or believes you old man.
1331053143405199362 2020-11-24 09:52:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Hung_Hippo @catturd2 Yep.
1331046141371138048 2020-11-24 09:25:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And the father just sits there and doesn’t say a damn thing about the abuse of one of his own children at the hands of this horrible mother?
1331039888360128513 2020-11-24 09:00:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wow just wow.
1331034853119148034 2020-11-24 08:40:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ram41662 Probably not but I try to give even those who can barely walk upright the benefit of the doubt.
1331033813628059648 2020-11-24 08:36:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sorry but since when does the media and foreign dignitaries decide who the president is you fkin clown?
1331033140857507840 2020-11-24 08:33:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gotsumpnferya @JennaEllisEsq This is why the msm is absolutely worthless. Imagine being the person who writes about this and ivanka blaming a fart on a classmate in college. *smh*
1331031594019086338 2020-11-24 08:27:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 So hawt.
1331029891895099393 2020-11-24 08:20:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @briantylercohen Where’s the lie? It *IS* a procedural step.
1331029676857257986 2020-11-24 08:19:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess ppl aren’t allowed to change their minds anymore @JennaEllisEsq.   If this article isn’t true I’d sue their asses.
1331029374892589057 2020-11-24 08:18:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Thanks to the left and businesses being destroyed over COVID lockdowns. I don’t know how ppl like YOU can sleep at night.
1331007498912886787 2020-11-24 06:51:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 Hell no. I hate that term.
1330999582969397249 2020-11-24 06:20:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I love this so much.
1330991854246977536 2020-11-24 05:49:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Prohibition is back y’all.
1330979350141755392 2020-11-24 04:59:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You can wear a mask and leave the rest of us alone!
1330959733797187585 2020-11-24 03:41:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anonymo36668694 Amen.
1330959636514570240 2020-11-24 03:41:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @murphstix I know I know. They come up on trending but completely forgettable.
1330953005861015552 2020-11-24 03:14:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m happy I didn’t watch #AMAs2020 who else?

1330940472819236864 2020-11-24 02:25:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Look @JoeBiden loves swamp rats. He’s just gonna restock with Obama appointees.  https://t.co/b6BJONNdDY
1330939705567789061 2020-11-24 02:22:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @StormWall82 I smelt that comment.
1330929094083547137 2020-11-24 01:39:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Omg can you smell the difference?
1330928278165626881 2020-11-24 01:36:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nabiscoisforlo1 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO Looks like he pegged Candace pretty good considering she’s pregnant. And she actually knows who the father is, unlike this leftist cucked crew.  https://t.co/WtZ037Bb65
1330922052384030721 2020-11-24 01:11:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dblurry16 They are quite homophobic.
1330769707918520324 2020-11-23 15:06:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola Stage 5 clingers.
1330769180107304960 2020-11-23 15:04:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Top flight journalism. 🙄  https://t.co/Jt7ZQFb0qk
1330768814770843656 2020-11-23 15:03:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t think they are distancing themselves. I think they are making it clear that Sidney is NOT being paid by Trump or the campaign.
1330766165765881856 2020-11-23 14:52:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot In skirts.
1330762919915646978 2020-11-23 14:39:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not surprised.
1330762842585239553 2020-11-23 14:39:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is so sad. Children look to adults for guidance &amp; this is what they do?
1330749696218779649 2020-11-23 13:47:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r What’s funny is they mention Proud Boys and likely have no clue what they look like or their identifying clothing.   These are Proud Boys.  https://t.co/oatYcfwyPG
1330748975159279616 2020-11-23 13:44:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r Causes severe shrinkage.
1330747200524091398 2020-11-23 13:37:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t think @SidneyPowell1 would risk her career on something that wasn’t given to her as evidence and confirmed.
1330746320831672323 2020-11-23 13:33:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KristinBoymom And they mock the right because they support the 2A. They are always projecting.
1330745889070084097 2020-11-23 13:31:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Commie flashback to 2016.
1330745775144353793 2020-11-23 13:31:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @StormWall82 Well isn’t that something?
1330745630902296576 2020-11-23 13:30:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why is the left so obsessed with dicks?
1330744906814394369 2020-11-23 13:28:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead @Ja1Ke3 Hearts it!
1330744542136389632 2020-11-23 13:26:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TizzleBiz @pi_mij Excellent question.
1330744439086583812 2020-11-23 13:26:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He is defending this republic unlike the left who all of a sudden could careless if fraud or election interference may have happened as long as they win.
1330743557888491521 2020-11-23 13:22:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pi_mij @TizzleBiz  https://t.co/G96DnVWwWw
1330742705341624321 2020-11-23 13:19:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So they are against lean meats?  https://t.co/vxFdRh4fNM
1330741984672182272 2020-11-23 13:16:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TizzleBiz Ahhh. You like it raw and wiggling.
1330740938625302531 2020-11-23 13:12:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TizzleBiz Haha what is it?

1330607119427465216 2020-11-23 04:20:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeeMuffy Probably. I’ve heard of ppl being killed because they had their seatbelts on and couldn’t unlock them but that number is lower so they don’t mention it’s much.
1330606043756257280 2020-11-23 04:16:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ICivi @thebunzilla Her: You’re a #COVIDIOT   Also her: Can you educate me on things I can transmit without having symptoms?   Me: I bet she has no clue that other coronaviruses exist and so does TB. 😂  https://t.co/zaQKvJcS6F
1330603790928515073 2020-11-23 04:07:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Go do some research.. you obviously know more than I do about healthcare. 😂
1330603289168134144 2020-11-23 04:05:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Wait you just said if they are far away then you are safe so which is it?
1330602908702842885 2020-11-23 04:03:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Were you scare to pass on everything else you could contract too or just COVID?
1330602701244121088 2020-11-23 04:03:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Then why do they need a mask if you are 6-10ft away mfker?!
1330602558566514688 2020-11-23 04:02:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla I’m not scared to live my life and I actually work with COVID patients.   But you do you boo.
1330602333126889472 2020-11-23 04:01:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla No YOU ARE free to stay home.. I live my life I don’t try to control others.
1330602163098234880 2020-11-23 04:00:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Yea then stay tf away from ppl instead of yelling in their face. If you see someone who doesn’t have a mask stay away from them. Protect yourself. Instead you run up and yell in their face like a dumbass.
1330601559818792960 2020-11-23 03:58:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi I can tell you don’t work in healthcare or look up actual information on COVID while virtue signaling your bullshit. If YOU are personally scared of contracting COVID stay your ass at home in quarantine while the rest of us live our lives.
1330601151775993856 2020-11-23 03:56:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi They ‘pitch a bitch’ right back and tell you to mind your damn business.
1330599380252983296 2020-11-23 03:49:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Well go ahead and “pitch a bitch” if you want, but don’t be surprised when your dumb ass gets it right back.
1330599181296177152 2020-11-23 03:49:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Not everyone does. Some ppl are ok taking the risk.   A mask only protects others if you are the one that is potentially sick and your cloth mask doesn’t do much.   If you have zero symptoms and are socially distanced why would you need to wear a mask?
1330598440745594885 2020-11-23 03:46:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi The left:  https://t.co/AUvLUr13Jz
1330598147358244864 2020-11-23 03:44:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi What do you think ppl have been doing for the last two months? 😂  Bars and restaurants have been open. Ppl have been living their lives and gathering with friends and family.   Did you just think that wasn’t already happening? 🤣 Here’s Gavin Newsom at a birthday party.  https://t.co/5lytmQJyJL
1330597233050279936 2020-11-23 03:41:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well @GovChristie should probably know he doesn’t represent most Americans.   https://t.co/5hNgfscM2D
1330595698643898369 2020-11-23 03:35:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ICivi @thebunzilla But then again if a person decides not to wear a seat belt do you live your life in fear of the risk the other person is taking?   Driving while drunk is illegal as well ppl do it all the time. Do you stop driving just in case you are on the road with them? Probably not.
1330593154203004929 2020-11-23 03:25:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ICivi @thebunzilla You think projections are always accurate they projected MILLIONS of deaths from COVID in the US when we first heard of it too.   Here’s Reuter’s in Sept. 2020 looks like we are doing better than predicted. 🤷🏻‍♀️  https://t.co/C5NlHgLJDJ
1330591988954001408 2020-11-23 03:20:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ICivi @thebunzilla Actually not wearing a seatbelt is against the law. It’s why they click it or ticket.   An actual law was legislated. Not some Governor in a state declaring it mandatory.  https://t.co/cvblHwQF8n
1330585922790854656 2020-11-23 02:56:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi Also when did I say I didn’t wear a mask? I said I’m not going to demand other ppl wear one because that’s their fkin choice. You idiots complain about a dictator in office while you continue to be accepting of less freedoms because the government tells you something.  https://t.co/djFNwgLSY5
1330585574890041344 2020-11-23 02:54:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thebunzilla @ICivi When did I say COVID wasn’t deadlier than the flu?   I said it’s a virus and it doesn’t magically just stop existing of ppl wear masks. Hence why the flu continues to kill ppl.   Funny how you morons always seem to try to twist things to benefit your argument and still lose.
1330569006441369600 2020-11-23 01:49:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> *Caring moral leftist
1330568592673304576 2020-11-23 01:47:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This was worth mentioning again..  https://t.co/AM5rqmA3Y6
1330566499669401600 2020-11-23 01:39:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RobSmithson6 It shows the progress we’ve made. Plus I’d love to know how many of the new COVID deaths are ppl with immune issues and pre existing conditions vs healthy young individuals?
1330565760222076930 2020-11-23 01:36:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Actually it’s not typical of conservatives who want fair elections.   You know how I know? Because the right doesn’t make excuses to destroy things, loot and riot over loses.
1330565323905409024 2020-11-23 01:34:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ICivi Wait why do you assume they are needless?   Do you think you stop COVID from existing and not ever killing someone if you wear a mask? 😂🤣😂  Just like the flu doesn’t kill ppl every year? 🤡
1330564799051173891 2020-11-23 01:32:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Aloha2Trump I saw someone say oppressed in the streets colonized in the sheets. 💀
1330564565143232514 2020-11-23 01:31:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker The Biden supporters have literally stated they don’t care if there was cheating as long as Trump is gone.   See that’s the difference we care about the integrity of our elections win or lose. They never did.
1330564295734734851 2020-11-23 01:30:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker I never said they didn’t. Of course they do. So how is claiming fraud by the right looked down on and called a conspiracy theory when ppl on the left easily swallowed the Russia thing when there was zero proof?   We just want actual PROOF all things the left never cared about.
1330563624092397569 2020-11-23 01:27:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The only #COVIDIOTS out there are the ppl who allow the government to control them with FEAR tactics that are as simple as saying, “COVID cases are rising.”   While the mortality rate is decreasing overall.  https://t.co/uRPqjOR5ZT
1330561606812504065 2020-11-23 01:19:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker If Rudy has lost a step what do you call what Biden does?
1330561324208689152 2020-11-23 01:18:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hell yea Huntington! Just please stay out of the streets for your own safety.    https://t.co/FVVjZgoMR6
1330560316132913152 2020-11-23 01:14:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Why was he a bad person to lead the effort? Because America’s Mayor who took down the mob in NY was being vilified by the leftist media? 😂  The MSM is sh*t. They did an article about Ivanka farting in college ffs.
1330558791830552576 2020-11-23 01:08:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Lots of elections don’t go our way. We didn’t make the rules. Leftists did when they started making claims that election integrity wasn’t as safe as we thought because of Russia for 4 yrs.   Now all of a sudden the elections can’t be compromised because they think they won? 😂
1330555588627972097 2020-11-23 00:55:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker I guess when Americans thought they were failing during the Revolutionary War they just stopped fighting?
1330550509346938882 2020-11-23 00:35:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kiltra_kiltra60 @carbophobe @Michael28882405 @DanielJHannan @NotBStifled But your claim was that they didn’t know any poor.. when they stated they were one of the poor who benefited you decided to change your claim.
1330548675827871745 2020-11-23 00:28:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Why are you giving it such a high percentage? I’d say it’s 50/50.
1330547448251523072 2020-11-23 00:23:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jason_9905 Oh it sounded familiar. Now I remember why.   The gun for a soldier is very different than fking mask.
1330545722429759490 2020-11-23 00:16:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 Vale pura verga ese güey.
1330544156469583875 2020-11-23 00:10:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 No mask and zero social distancing.
1330543993441181696 2020-11-23 00:09:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is the saddest fkin thing I’ve seen. Jeremy is in love with a mask.
1330541170968068096 2020-11-22 23:58:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good lord is he.
1330540215166001154 2020-11-22 23:54:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes because having to post a $2M bond after turning yourself in &amp; not being a flight risk because you defended yourself from leftist scum trying to kill you is so privileged. 🙄
1330538664707887105 2020-11-22 23:48:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LostJavaCat You still are!
1330538103195328512 2020-11-22 23:46:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chefLCraig70 @MrAndyNgo Do you have Pantifa up on yours commie?
1330537793714606084 2020-11-22 23:45:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw @MrAndyNgo As it should be. Its only fair.
1330537680472576002 2020-11-22 23:44:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Had nothing to do with Obama being BLACK you pos and everything to do with him being a shit president and person.
1330532522942410757 2020-11-22 23:24:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrAndyNgo These Pantifa nutters try to blame everything on Andy Ngo.
1330525687191543808 2020-11-22 22:56:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BluesCanes @mtwainet @SharylAttkisson These 2 new deaths are after the state had been reopened. Which means bars and restaurants had been open and ppl were getting back to normal.   Now the rise in cases is yet again the excuse the government gives to control our lives as free ppl? They can fk off.
1330525082704179201 2020-11-22 22:54:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BluesCanes @mtwainet @SharylAttkisson FYI I work at a hospital. I wear a mask at work and when asked in a grocery store but I’m not going to live my life in fear of catching a virus now that we know more about it.   My county has seen a rise in cases but literally has had 2 more deaths added in the last 2 months.
1330524301037084675 2020-11-22 22:51:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BluesCanes @mtwainet @SharylAttkisson You are suggesting everyone around you is asymptomatic? 😂 See again that’s YOUR fear driving your expectations of others.   Why would you ever expect others to accommodate your fears and life.   YOU can stay locked up with a MASK if you want no one else has to.
1330523462805323776 2020-11-22 22:48:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mtwainet @SharylAttkisson That’s like saying I’m afraid of driving so you as my neighbor have to do everything for me that requires driving because it’s the right thing to do.   If we did it that’s just accommodating you. If we don’t it doesn’t make us bad ppl YOU need to find other options.
1330522717980921863 2020-11-22 22:45:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mtwainet @SharylAttkisson It *IS* a lot to ask of those who are healthy &amp; have likely had the virus, recovered &amp; haven’t been tested.   If YOU are concerned about catching the virus YOU can stay locked in your home afraid while the rest of us live our lives. We don’t have to accommodate YOUR fears.
1330395989178462209 2020-11-22 14:21:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @katie_brennan Honestly I love My Fair Lady.  https://t.co/DCXyex07wy
1330394112017788929 2020-11-22 14:14:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Damn bitch the time to shut your yap was 4 yrs ago.
1330393711302340609 2020-11-22 14:12:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’d love to know why all these woke leftist poc who claim white ppl are the worst are all with white partners?  https://t.co/nBPphs9f9v
1330387161795891201 2020-11-22 13:46:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They have been for a while now.
1330386431303421953 2020-11-22 13:43:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Bitch you lyin..
1330385663204712457 2020-11-22 13:40:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh look armed leftists domestic terrorists.
1330385155492630528 2020-11-22 13:38:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrAndyNgo I’d laugh if the gun went off by accident.
1330383730301612033 2020-11-22 13:32:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Defyantofficial Ppl are sick of the bullshit.
1330383655051530240 2020-11-22 13:32:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m very confused.. are they trying to tell us that this man did absolutely nothing and was killed for just being black in Brazil? The article doesn’t give much info on what happened before the man was killed.  https://t.co/tSKl3fcTQp
1330382014701309955 2020-11-22 13:26:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I hope you asked for major crackdowns when ppl were rioting and protesting as well you tit.
1330381792042385411 2020-11-22 13:25:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You know what they say about snitches..
1330381588291592192 2020-11-22 13:24:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo I think if you hate both candidates how do ppl choose Biden over Trump?
1330357867296198657 2020-11-22 11:50:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Wookiee931 My bad.
1330355488555290625 2020-11-22 11:40:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait so this motorcycle rally is responsible for 86 COVID cases in Minnesota so can you please tell us how many can be traced back to the BLM protests and riots?
1330354200824332288 2020-11-22 11:35:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SandraFraccalv2 🙏🏼🙏🏼
1330352354508513280 2020-11-22 11:28:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Gorgeous! Perfection!
1330352242097086466 2020-11-22 11:27:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 I love this meme.
1330350481613484033 2020-11-22 11:20:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Well I’m willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. I don’t think someone like Sidney would risk her credibility and career on something she didn’t believe happened.
1330349081613496323 2020-11-22 11:15:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Because everything that ppl seem to say can’t be real gets passed off as crazy.
1330348794907684864 2020-11-22 11:14:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is this possible with a Trump loss?
1330224844210917379 2020-11-22 03:01:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl who are paid VIA state taxes are harassing business owners in Buffalo, NY for being open and not wearing masks while doing absolutely nothing about the looting and riots in their cities. Shameful. Stand up or lose your freedoms!  https://t.co/LYlG8y5dJe
1330196808597991430 2020-11-22 01:10:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anonymo36668694 Biden just has a “slight” edge.
1330196266551275523 2020-11-22 01:07:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s this Captain Obvious? Tilts Blue? 🤣  https://t.co/ED2H36XL1m
1330195824861716484 2020-11-22 01:06:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @minariexe @politicalamity2 @DInflation @joesinness @debbravobabe @StarTribune It’s not murder when you’re defending yourself from being killed by a crazed mob of leftist trash.   Defending pedophiles isn’t a good look btw.
1330194935694430218 2020-11-22 01:02:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And @JoeBiden is out here saying he needs funding for his transition. 🤣
1330194440313581568 2020-11-22 01:00:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead Also they try to make ppl believe that the rise in hospitalizations is due to COVID it’s not. Hospitals get a higher influx of admissions during the cold months.    https://t.co/txTurHfkyp
1330192608858140673 2020-11-22 00:53:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot This stuff looks absolutely disgusting. *shivers*
1330191771834396673 2020-11-22 00:50:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot They are trying to sell it as a commercial product just not approved yet.
1330191574807015430 2020-11-22 00:49:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You mean like Biden did when he called lids and refused to answer questions he wasn’t prepped for? 😂
1330191354052419585 2020-11-22 00:48:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It was savage and well deserved. No one has to have their questions answered at a press briefing. You’ll realize that when Biden calls lids and gives you nothing but the kind of ice cream he likes.
1330190899796697092 2020-11-22 00:46:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> None of these so called reporters should be called on. They are garbage. Say what you gotta say @PressSec and leave them screaming.
1330190201201840128 2020-11-22 00:43:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker So if it’s always done why blame Trump for needing the funding because he’s delaying the transition?   Tf does delaying the transition matter if you always get funding and can’t use fed dollars or campaign funds.
1330189353180655617 2020-11-22 00:40:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot It’s been going on longer than we thought..  https://t.co/xKJZZXJirp
1330187808821096449 2020-11-22 00:34:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fascists terrorists make such threats.
1330187179591671808 2020-11-22 00:31:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot Yes you read that right. 😫
1330187005741969410 2020-11-22 00:31:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Since when do they require Transition funding? Democrats will rob you b*tches blind.
1330177949098782741 2020-11-21 23:55:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is scary... they are prepping us for communist famines.  https://t.co/q2lbY9FZyD

1330047875062124547 2020-11-21 15:18:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ReaICosy @LostJavaCat for you.
1330039538710876162 2020-11-21 14:45:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good! No need to. He shoulda done this a long time ago after how they treated him.
1330038901797494786 2020-11-21 14:42:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Says who?
1330038723698970632 2020-11-21 14:41:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Them: Face masks didn’t stop COVID spread   Me: Well you don’t fkin say?!  https://t.co/2vDPCISOin
1330038005931909128 2020-11-21 14:39:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They might not like what happens if they try..  https://t.co/Mt42wMhTvB

1330033739490078726 2020-11-21 14:22:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 Add some stove top chicken stuffing to a can of corn and add some butter microwave for about 3 mins you won’t regret it. 😉
1330033375256698880 2020-11-21 14:20:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 She claims it was from 2019.
1330029645987786753 2020-11-21 14:05:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Busting windows is so brave.
1330028698922229760 2020-11-21 14:02:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead Who’s surprised?
1330015562278158337 2020-11-21 13:09:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s funny to see these ppl salty af because the admin isn’t giving them shit. Why don’t you go ask Biden what kind of ice cream he likes you fkin clowns?
1330009619364646912 2020-11-21 12:46:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @renkaiza @Sreliata Yep but that’s what makes it even better.
1330008931544887298 2020-11-21 12:43:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And ppl still wonder why we have questions about the Georgia election results?
1330006648010670081 2020-11-21 12:34:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @yashar Why not?
1330006422487134208 2020-11-21 12:33:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Oh definitely!! Do it!!
1330005391485243392 2020-11-21 12:29:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Yea democrats who feel this way would likely not want to admit it otherwise they’d be harassed and doxxed for falling out of line.   So tribal.
1330004610728173571 2020-11-21 12:26:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob It fks things up so it forces me to update after awhile. It’s so frustrating why can’t it just stay the same? Damn.
1330004373028495361 2020-11-21 12:25:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker No we don’t.. but anytime polls like this come out that 30% is likely 45%  That’s the difference.
1330003569769005057 2020-11-21 12:22:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea and @elonmusk tested positive and negative the same day. 😂

1329993707429318656 2020-11-21 11:43:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Shiet then what would that make Biden and Kamala?
1329992124582936576 2020-11-21 11:36:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LizzerMack No one wants to buy that shit. It’s too expensive for kindling.😂

1329989483228405761 2020-11-21 11:26:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jeremiahjm @SullyBobbi The desire for attention is real.
1329988889931513858 2020-11-21 11:23:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This shit wouldn’t bother me so much if they were EQUAL when reporting incidents.   When it’s a middle eastern guy, hispanic or black person they always just say “a man in his 20s or 30s” but when they are WHITE that’s the main talking point. I’m surprised it’s not in BOLD!  https://t.co/QwUiLo0h6c
1329967490202386432 2020-11-21 09:58:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IlhanMN So marrying your brother is acceptable where you come from @ilhanmn?
1329966452699394050 2020-11-21 09:54:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> *spits out water* 🤣

1329906640242393088 2020-11-21 05:57:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl I don’t think it’s “embarrassing” if anyone has a legal reason to not quit.   If this all ends up in a nothing burger after weeks thats when it gets super embarrassing.
1329896409445793793 2020-11-21 05:16:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mtwainet @SharylAttkisson Actually cloth masks don’t help much even a N95 if fitted properly only stops 95% of all airborne droplets.   They want ppl who are sick to wear masks generally so others don’t get sick the healthy don’t generally need to wear them.
1329894950662664192 2020-11-21 05:10:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wtf?! Since when do you give awards for killing ppl? Where tf do you get these recommendations?!
1329875889530671104 2020-11-21 03:54:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They are getting all the hammers they can...
1329818669854072832 2020-11-21 00:07:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mtwainet @SharylAttkisson So now you’re saying we don’t need masks we can just cover our mouths when we cough right?   Masks that aren’t N95 really don’t make a significant difference. The cloth masks everyone wears don’t stop much if anything that’s why they recommend the 6ft+ social distancing.
1329816316287455233 2020-11-20 23:58:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dancindoti @CarolinaOpinion @man_obvious @SidneyPowell1 @TuckerCarlson Affidavits are SWORN statements. Which means if you are lying you can be held accountable in a court of law for making a that false statement.   I don’t think 100s of ppl tend to want to risk that. None of these ppl have been forced to make these statements they came forward.
1329679951209975809 2020-11-20 14:56:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 79M+ Americans voted for this hot mess?  🤦🏻‍♀️  https://t.co/4C0leTHGm4
1329679204858830848 2020-11-20 14:53:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarenR_Tn @AOC Remind us who controls the house where such bills aren’t passed unless these ppl vote yes?  https://t.co/DMb3O2Kks9
1329675312922181633 2020-11-20 14:37:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird how Wall Street backed Biden tho.. 🤔 Actually Dems have the majority and they’d have to vote yes on the bill before it passes to the senate. Not all of us are stupid like you.
1329670901080629251 2020-11-20 14:20:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MaddowBlog How did Susan contract COVID? Was she one of the ppl willing to take the risk or did you give it to her?

1329647921420136449 2020-11-20 12:49:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @M9Scarlett @MrAndyNgo Yea sorry I don’t believe in WHITE POWER..if I believed that as a brown person then I’m suggesting I’m lesser. I’m not.
1329647429277212675 2020-11-20 12:47:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @M9Scarlett @MrAndyNgo Cracker is a slur for white ppl just like YT is. If you have white guilt and are ok with being called slurs that’s on you.
1329646832348057602 2020-11-20 12:44:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @M9Scarlett @GeraltofPDX1 @MrAndyNgo Wait so the black person wasn’t being a racist only the white person was? 😂
1329643050084122624 2020-11-20 12:29:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yep and I sure hope Ned sees the inside of a jail cell for it.
1329640578947039234 2020-11-20 12:19:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wouldn’t say he went after her. His job is to ask for evidence but as sensitive as this is I wouldn’t give out anything until it’s required in court.
1329640169721319425 2020-11-20 12:18:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrAndyNgo Apples to apples imo.
1329639745920536577 2020-11-20 12:16:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No one has to go anywhere until 1/20/21 so wtf are you even talking about Geraldo?
1329637439401390087 2020-11-20 12:07:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @bTheResistance @JoeBiden Imagine saying this and actually believing it.   The sheep always try to justify their sheepish behavior.
1329637043194871809 2020-11-20 12:05:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The stans really go hard over ppl that don’t give two shits about them.

1329633480183934976 2020-11-20 11:51:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @vintagexpost @dirtydurk20 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO No bitch did you? I actually read what he had to say in his interview you should probably read it.
1329623974309888004 2020-11-20 11:13:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake Yes you were.
1329623342391779328 2020-11-20 11:11:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw He’s such a pos. Take pics. Make some money off ratting his hypocritical ass out.
1329622841533243392 2020-11-20 11:09:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake Lmaoo. The memories.
1329618764472598528 2020-11-20 10:53:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Sorry to disappoint.. he’s just trynna get the Alphabet ppl some attention since you know how extremely scared they are to do it themselves these days. Serious oppression.
1329618350197018624 2020-11-20 10:51:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake Girl that looks like a garage sale pick up of about $2 which included a lamp. 😂
1329617883563888641 2020-11-20 10:49:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> FYI @TuckerCarlson just because you aren’t given any proof of something as sensitive election fraud don’t assume it must not exist. The media is quick to believe “anonymous sources” but not @SidneyPowell1?  https://t.co/rVwKHlxJqe
1329615416449060864 2020-11-20 10:39:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I have a suggestion. Why don’t we stop paying congress instead?
1329615106167033857 2020-11-20 10:38:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like someone had a garage sale.

1329613748886069248 2020-11-20 10:33:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea we are done playing nice with those who have done nothing but undermine the Trump presidency for 4 yrs. Obama and Biden also worked tirelessly to frame Flynn and get him investigated.  https://t.co/cjkSDDIA49
1329602730390814720 2020-11-20 09:49:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @followchristsac Because you know damn well they are coming. *smh*
1329590752934957056 2020-11-20 09:01:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I better not see his vampire ass outside.    https://t.co/jSzneY68A7
1329565467367809024 2020-11-20 07:21:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So it was ok when the left was twisting their arms and threatening them to vote how they wanted? They filed affidavits saying they were threatened by ppl and it was actually played live. Fk YOU FASCISTS.
1329565079096815616 2020-11-20 07:19:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Was it as crazy as calling the president a Russian asset, racist and white supremacist for the last 4 yrs asking for a friend?
1329563905618677763 2020-11-20 07:15:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump This must have been before this happened..  https://t.co/lRkJiukRuH
1329543372785078273 2020-11-20 05:53:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe And I supported Obama in 2008 and 2012 and Hillary in 2016.
1329543116248940544 2020-11-20 05:52:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe FYI you don’t have to like a person to agree that his policies are better for all Americans and have helped minority communities a lot.   Obama never did..
1329542734948958208 2020-11-20 05:51:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe We will call him illegitimate because we can. The fact Trump won the presidency didn’t stop the left from calling him illegitimate for 4 yrs.   So for the 73M Americans who voted for Trump, Biden *is* illegitimate.   Maybe the left should have been more accepting. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1329542023028772864 2020-11-20 05:48:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe Yea remind me what back channel Trump used to make 10M from China for the “Big Guy” while you’re brother and children have ZERO experience but are getting deals because you’re VP or former VP hoping for a presidential run.   This is Biden’s own words.  https://t.co/a1jdAXDbLf
1329540938683748352 2020-11-20 05:43:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe Here’s China’s perspective on a Biden presidency. What does winning the popular vote matter? The reason he won the PV is literally because of one state, CA.   Also this was released the same day Trump was inaugurated. Why do we have to agree w/the winner when the left didnt?  https://t.co/qzo6VTDXbF
1329526726515331072 2020-11-20 04:47:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe It’s not really a defeat when one withdraws willingly.   I don’t know what’s going on, but I guess I could just say BIDEN is not my president, he’s illegitimately in the WH and a Chinese asset for the next 4 yrs. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1329524489969754112 2020-11-20 04:38:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe They were threatened and slandered on live ZOOM meeting and called racists for ZERO reason and doxxed to vote a certain way. I see more of a problem with that then anything else. That’s how fascist act when they don’t get their way.
1329499215202983936 2020-11-20 02:58:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe  https://t.co/DP106DcFHf
1329490539285147648 2020-11-20 02:23:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe An interesting tidbit.. so they legislature abolished straight ticket voting and then when Michigan is lost to Trump in 2016 they create a constitutional amendment that clearly would benefit democrats. 🤔  https://t.co/sXD0C5BPax
1329489626319396865 2020-11-20 02:20:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe Of course they aren’t expected to match perfectly but are they normally that far off?
1329489027397951488 2020-11-20 02:17:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And where do you plan to get that money from without depreciating our currency and causing inflation and making or money worthless like in Venezuela you fkin commie?  https://t.co/FaZ5Cz9Sa4
1329480258215497729 2020-11-20 01:42:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe The discrepancy is in the votes for president and democrat party totals.  40k+ votes for president and not democrat or any other party?   233,908 to 191,152? Republican is off too. Which seems odd.  https://t.co/9lyEOxQBJc
1329461365547823104 2020-11-20 00:27:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe Detroit is the largest city in Wayne County. So discrepancies in Detroit would be larger than other areas mathematically speaking.
1329461136786300928 2020-11-20 00:26:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe Wait we’re they “baseless claims” or clerical errors?   I’m sorry but when you have discrepancies they should be checked before a certification.  https://t.co/kBMnFcf1Oy
1329459345227071488 2020-11-20 00:19:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Mattielisbon Yea I’d have some questions as well.   How can you certify an election when they are claiming all ballots haven’t been counted yet? They are claiming 747k ballots have been received but they are saying there are 1.3M total ballots out there?  https://t.co/XRQFL88m98
1329455249812238341 2020-11-20 00:03:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe you should have respected the opinions of those who didn’t agree with you instead of calling them racist you pos FASCIST.
1329454704800243717 2020-11-20 00:01:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donohoe Ok so what’s the problem with recounting Detroit so they can feel confident about certifying the votes in Detroit?   Why are you against it? I thought democracy mattered and you wanted all legal votes to be counted as well. Has that changed?
1329453867348713474 2020-11-19 23:57:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @windowtothewalt @necktitties79 Looks like @thehill is about to get cancelled by the MINORITY. 😂
1329452366865829888 2020-11-19 23:51:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why do democrats have such an issue with wanting a recount in Wayne County? They claimed Republicans wanted it because of racism yet the reality is Wayne County is majority white.  https://t.co/6oebSaKqQn
1329451223674662921 2020-11-19 23:47:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TomikiTom @realFelixDare @thejtlewis @thehill @realDonaldTrump If only 72% of Dems are saying Trump should concede that’s a 28% problem for Dems.
1329450722216333314 2020-11-19 23:45:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AlottaPower @thehill All of a sudden. 😂🤡
1329450638095380480 2020-11-19 23:45:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 46% percent? 😳 So what you’re saying is the majority of Americans think he shouldn’t? 🇺🇸
1329450013315969035 2020-11-19 23:42:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ju8na @vintagexpost @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO Are you respecting Candace and her opinion or mine for that matter? No you don’t so please just stfu you fkin hypocrites you complain about every fkin thing under the sun.   We state facts about Harry wearing a dress and y’all lose your sh*t. Deal with it we dgaf.
1329449362074841088 2020-11-19 23:40:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ju8na @vintagexpost @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO Respect is earned. No one has to respect anyone they don’t feel earned it. Nor should you expect it.   The only ppl ranting about a man in a dress pandering to the LGBT community are you ppl.   My statement was simple. He’s a man in a dress. Facts seem to bother ppl like you.
1329310227276066816 2020-11-19 14:27:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Estivel Now if you are talking about one city in Wayne County like Detroit being almost 80% black then that would make sense, but Wayne County itself is more white than black. If that county as a whole is in question it actually affects more whites than blacks.  https://t.co/hViUba3KuQ
1329308726080114688 2020-11-19 14:21:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Estivel First why is the certification in question?   Also who told you Wayne County, MI is 80% Black? You seem to be about 40% off.  https://t.co/EyE2tPUo5H
1329305115807813632 2020-11-19 14:06:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can you tell me if your race is a question on the ballot you are required to fill in to vote? Why do you assume that black ppl would be the only ones affected?
1329304622486360064 2020-11-19 14:04:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Timcast About fkin time! Caving to the mob gets us nowhere.
1329301815867764737 2020-11-19 13:53:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good to know it was a green screen because they weren’t social distanced or wearing their masks.
1329301252237234177 2020-11-19 13:51:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SmallTownHero1 Yea cat videos are more @syl_capulet1 or @LostJavaCat’s thing.
1329300829086466051 2020-11-19 13:49:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Patriotgamer45 @KristinBoymom Good question but..   Are you taking into consideration all the ppl that had cancer, heart disease and are aged (on hospice) in the COVID deaths?   If you could weed those out how high do you think the survival rate for COVID would be.
1329295630238314496 2020-11-19 13:29:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine that?    https://t.co/lWaRYIQS3J
1329294831877644288 2020-11-19 13:25:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 230k Americans die every month on average in any given year prior to COVID.  https://t.co/Fqt3DK0XrR
1329290524314898434 2020-11-19 13:08:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 A person who thinks they decide the rules for terms they don’t like.
1329290333314637824 2020-11-19 13:08:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Here’s @aoc’s open secrets profile.. Amazon and Apple donated to her campaign.  https://t.co/L41LIE2Ow1
1329286786485424128 2020-11-19 12:54:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Survival rate for COVID is about 95%+ Survival rates for cancers aren’t that high.  https://t.co/VxyKMLk4fM
1329285774995427329 2020-11-19 12:50:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder when Bernie got his wings?  https://t.co/6ZFUCN4QY5
1329285128418332672 2020-11-19 12:47:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So let’s put this to rest. Why don’t you have a DNA test and figure out what your biological sex is?   Not sure how your biological reality is oppressive. It’s who you are even if you “feel” different hence why TRANSGENDERISM exists.
1329283317485563905 2020-11-19 12:40:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @topined @GeraltofPDX1 @seanhannity Yea I’m sure ppl dying alone in the hospital during lockdowns with zero family around is very dignified.   While the ppl who put these restrictions in place are going to birthday parties, meeting with lobbyists and having different rules for themselves then they do for others.
1329282697630416897 2020-11-19 12:37:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AnticapBot @topined @GeraltofPDX1 @seanhannity Sure commie bot.
1329282481170759685 2020-11-19 12:36:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @topined @GeraltofPDX1 @seanhannity Who’s justifying anything weirdo? I’m giving you actual stats of deaths that you seem to want to ignore.   Heart disease and cancer has also killed more Americans than WWII if you’re focused on the numbers.  Communism has killed more ppl around the world than COVID too.
1329278592547647488 2020-11-19 12:21:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 @GeraltofPDX1 @topined @seanhannity This is what he means by North Korean type lockdowns oh ignorant one.   “Schools were closed throughout the country; university students in Pyongyang from elsewhere in the country were confined to their dormitories.”   You have no clue what a dictator is if you think Trump is one
1329278122345172992 2020-11-19 12:19:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 @GeraltofPDX1 @topined @seanhannity Also in late February, the North Korean government said that it would keep the border closed until a cure was found.   His long do you think it takes to find a “cure”?   In February, wearing face masks was obligatory and visiting public places such as restaurants was forbidden.
1329277603161673730 2020-11-19 12:17:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IndiSingh75 @GeraltofPDX1 @topined @seanhannity Do you know what freedom is?   Do you know the laws in North Korea and about the government there?   Ex: The authorities started placing multiple “suspected” cases, those with slight symptoms such as flu in quarantine for two weeks in Sinuiju.

1329236583980048385 2020-11-19 09:34:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jgray690 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO So do you personally know that Harry purchases dresses on the regular?   Do you see him out in public like this normally?   It’s a photoshoot do you know that most of the items ppl wear in photo shoots don’t belong to them?
1329234827845849089 2020-11-19 09:27:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jgray690 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO No I’m arguing that a MAN like Harry has no reason to wear a dress. Unless he’s pandering to a certain group which he himself is not a part of. Which he has claimed himself he is not LGBT and doesn’t know what that’s like.
1329234474198941696 2020-11-19 09:26:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jgray690 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO You keep moving the goal posts dear. When you continue to do that you’ve already lost.   FACT: A kilt is NOT a dress! It’s a cultural thing.   Next goal post you plan on erecting to try to prove your point?
1329217118408085505 2020-11-19 08:17:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @topined @seanhannity Especially shouldn’t be locked up while their government officials declaring these lockdowns are having a grand ol’ time in Maui with lobbyists not social distancing.
1329216791877357568 2020-11-19 08:15:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @topined @GeraltofPDX1 @seanhannity Well that’s gonna be rough considering this many ppl die on average in the US per month and these are the leading reasons for death. If there was no illness or death you wouldn’t have a job now would you?  https://t.co/dNfCPVFUYT
1329216182059114499 2020-11-19 08:13:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @peterfraserbris @seanhannity Yes ppl die everyday were you not aware of that fact?   Did you know 230k Americans die every month on average in the US?  https://t.co/eZNshoFRbE
1329153463020781569 2020-11-19 04:04:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 👆🏼Meant to reply to you @Ja1Ke3 not sure what happened.
1329153110082613248 2020-11-19 04:02:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea that’s how I’ve been feeling lately. I’m tired of the harassment and doxxing by these fascists. Not to mentioning vilifying ppl in order to ruin their lives and threaten their families.   I’m not usually like this but I’m fkin tired of it..    https://t.co/Nz8ZmKsqoj

Plus he’s just pandering to the LGBT community. He’s not wearing a dress because he is confused about his own sexuality. He thinks other ppl who are need to see him in a dress to feel better about themselves which is pretty arrogant.  https://t.co/OqD8Kxulgu
1329148236544708610 2020-11-19 03:43:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dirtydurk20 @vintagexpost @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO If you think pants are masculine then you are going along with the sexist stereotype that women need to be in dresses to be feminine?   Why do you think trans persons feel the need to wear dresses to feel feminine? Because ppl like you think wearing pants is masculine.
1329140684951941122 2020-11-19 03:13:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OneSynn Until ppl get arrested for doing these things and actually suffer consequences then why not?   It’s not about stooping when you know cons won’t drive to someone’s house and use bullhorns and tell racist from them streets and attack their children even if they get the info.
1329140183321612288 2020-11-19 03:11:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea like we should take the guy that said this shit serious at all... STFU YOU deranged lunatic.  https://t.co/boH6vwpj8C
1329138041156374528 2020-11-19 03:02:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OneSynn I’m just sick of always taking the high road. Fk them. Use their own tactics against them.
1329137895613943808 2020-11-19 03:02:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OneSynn The MSM isn’t going to show it. And social media will just spread the lie of how he’s justified because the ppl he did it against were racists and white supremacists. All while they are attacked in the streets and their families are as well and they suffer ZERO consequences.
1329136398247464961 2020-11-19 02:56:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OneSynn How do you spread truth when they lie about ppl? While they vilify ppl as racists? What legal routes do you want to take when that vilification gets you banned from everything even from being able to make money or receive donations online?
1329135913981546497 2020-11-19 02:54:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jgray690 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO I’m not saying they are ONLY for women. Where did I say that?   Men who wear drag obviously have dresses made for them.   What’s the point of a man like Harry wearing a dress?   Pandering is all I see unless he’s claiming to be LGBT.
1329134316471812102 2020-11-19 02:48:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OneSynn I agree. So when are we going to play their game with their rules?   Never? Are we always expected to take the moral high ground when they have ZERO bottom to their actions?
1329133888480788480 2020-11-19 02:46:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jgray690 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO Not likely. You do realize they can uses clips and pins so they don’t have to actually alter anything. If you think all outfits in magazines are altered to fit everyone that wears them you’d be sadly mistaken.   Trying to justify your case is repeatedly failing.
1329133254985752576 2020-11-19 02:43:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jgray690 @NoraBananaFana @RealCandaceO Switching to now saying, “oh but women’s suits were designed because...” doesn’t really support your initial argument about women wearing suits being an issue.   Like I stated they are WOMENS SUITS. They are designed FOR WOMEN.   Do you know if the dress was designed for Harry?
1329116146818158592 2020-11-19 01:35:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What the media gets paid the big bucks for..
1329107698164502535 2020-11-19 01:02:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You’re a lying pos fascist! I hope you are arrested for threatening a someone over a federal election.   Yesterday you called someone a racist because they didn’t want to certify and election. You brought this on yourself you scumbag.

It doesn’t spread awareness it delegitimizes those who feel the need to feel feminine to make themselves feel better in their own skin. Why is Harry doing it? Because he can?

You don’t affect my life or how I feel about things in anyway.   Anyone who wants to think that a man in a dress is brave can if they want I don’t agree.
1329085031147466752 2020-11-18 23:32:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wow fascism by the left really is a thing. Threatening businesses for what they are legally allowed to do is not a good look. The left needs a serious CULLING.

Why does the US have to get involved? Did you see what Trump did with Mexico? WE now have Mexican troops protecting our US border. Why can’t middle eastern countries keep terrorists in ck

Why is she not allowed to have an opinion on what men wear as a woman?   Pretty fkin sexist to demand women respect men who wear dresses because YOU think they should.

Why would you use a term like “Macho Man”?   I’m assuming you think it’s MACHO for a man to wear a dress while one who doesn’t wear a dress isn’t?   The new speak is strong with this one.

The moment someone makes it feel forced is the moment I’m like, “FK MASKS!”   I guess some ppl don’t realize a large number of Americans like their freedom and free will.

1328724530907422720 2020-11-17 23:39:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Once again proving that living in BLUE counties and voting for someone like Biden will destroy your local economy &amp; way of life. The blue side needs YOU dependent so they can claim how they can help you. The red side actually wants you to be self sufficient.
1328594594519511040 2020-11-17 15:03:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ughdaechwita1 @LauraWhitt32 @kettlepotsky Why can’t both matter? Why do you assume women who are raped have abortions as their first option?
1328591974056800259 2020-11-17 14:53:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They’d make the same fkin mistake again and get into some more debt hoping someone else will pay it off.
1328582029915590662 2020-11-17 14:13:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> White supremacists in Portland? 😂 911 should block Jo Ann’s number.
1328580533627068416 2020-11-17 14:07:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anonymo36668694  https://t.co/F3EjShQ0pU
1328579286857605120 2020-11-17 14:02:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ughdaechwita1 @LauraWhitt32 @kettlepotsky Nice try pro-abortionist. Of course they matter just like 100% of all the babies murdered via abortion.
1328578819456905216 2020-11-17 14:00:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Globalists are a plague that needs to be destroyed by it’s root.
1328578125815558149 2020-11-17 13:58:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 @kettlepotsky The left tries to use rape and incest to justify abortion. When the truth is abortions due to rape or incest are less than 2% of overall abortion reasons.
1328574700600090624 2020-11-17 13:44:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SenSherrodBrown was just virtue signaling. Who is he infecting if he removes the mask while NO ONE is within 20ft of his ass? Couldn’t understand most of what he said either. So his point was lost.
1328572459986071552 2020-11-17 13:35:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So are you saying college brings unhappiness? If so then why tf do we have to pay for YOUR decision to be unhappy?
1328571937820471297 2020-11-17 13:33:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheReaIRobG Wait are they supposed to be? 🤔
1328571257772716033 2020-11-17 13:30:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For the 19% who support eliminating student loan debts. What’s stopping you from doing it?
1328570342286241793 2020-11-17 13:27:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left is horrible at math. I’ll pay my DEBT you pay for YOURS.
1328569510371135488 2020-11-17 13:23:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun I’m hoping they are, Ive been bookmarking a ton of posts. 😉
1328569251666358272 2020-11-17 13:22:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KatieHill4CA If you are a student with college debt add your name here in the comments so Katie can give you money because she’s NOT an asshole.
1328568909054709760 2020-11-17 13:21:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We need to get rid of any of the CA lawmakers going to this event while they lock the rest of us down because of the pandemic.  https://t.co/PkUbi5kLD5
1328565738374787072 2020-11-17 13:08:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @politicalamity2 While brushing your hair.
1328565612302385154 2020-11-17 13:08:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who’s starving in the US? I’ve never seen an American look like this for lack of food.   This is what STARVING actually looks like Cori.  https://t.co/qGnGBUwfBw
1328562901192359936 2020-11-17 12:57:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Katie isn’t an asshole it’s why she needs the names of students who are struggling with college debt.   Please add your name and college you attend in Katie’s comments so she can start paying YOUR debt off.
1328561763709718533 2020-11-17 12:53:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Being in the room and 150ft away from ppl processing ballots while requiring binoculars doesn’t sound like they were able to “observe” very well.   I rate this @PolitiFact mostly false.
1328561076598804481 2020-11-17 12:50:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> On the American tax payer too.
1328560778979381249 2020-11-17 12:49:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Get the colleges that failed these students with critical race theory instead of degrees for real jobs to refund them.
1328559367063408641 2020-11-17 12:43:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sacramento is a cesspool.. I guess the @SacramentoKings don’t think #AllLivesMatter. Since my life doesn’t matter to them as a Hispanic then neither does my money. 🖕🏼
1328558668665610242 2020-11-17 12:40:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ok so how far back are these claims going if the victims range from 8yrs to 93yrs? Geezus.  https://t.co/79NzZ8PIfJ
1328557926215139328 2020-11-17 12:37:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun I’m not sure either. I’m keepin an eye out tho.
1328557760686919681 2020-11-17 12:37:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MilleniaSaurusX FYI the US isn’t a democracy. We are a constitutional republic.   While you are trying to give lessons you should probably get that right first. 😂
1328557386034860032 2020-11-17 12:35:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MilleniaSaurusX Tu a mi no me callas. 😂 La que te calla a ti soy yo.
1328557099031293953 2020-11-17 12:34:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MilleniaSaurusX Not sure why you had to delete your post. Guess you can’t read either. Says you deleted it right in the bottom. 🤷🏻‍♀️ You couldn’t give a civics lesson even if you tried. Was 8th grade the last grade you fished?
1328556769291866112 2020-11-17 12:33:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MilleniaSaurusX I guess you aren’t very good with numbers Elias. I have lots more than 10 followers. I don’t clout chase güey. No need to especially when I’m dealing with pendejos que ni saben limpiarse el culero like you.   That prison pose is something..
1328555911737090048 2020-11-17 12:29:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 Or she’ll throw shit.  https://t.co/oUfVCZeZRD
1328555243399913472 2020-11-17 12:27:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey what happened to that “native genocide” by the white Europeans the left keeps talking about?
1328554426995408896 2020-11-17 12:23:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MilleniaSaurusX Did you count every vote for yourself? That’s impressive.   What did Trump prove to be? He’s the current president and if Biden does win then he doesn’t get to start his job until 1/20/21. 🤷🏻‍♀️ You know that right?
1328553784788697088 2020-11-17 12:21:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey do you often post and then delete @MilleniaSaurusX?   You do know that Biden is listed as the “projected” winner right? That means it’s not confirmed yet. Please don’t try to tell me about “basic math” when your ilk elected ppl like AOC.  https://t.co/tirHd0Y3gJ
1328552668038500352 2020-11-17 12:16:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @slevinBad_Dog It pays. Lol
1328547804982116354 2020-11-17 11:57:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Someone Karened me today about standing behind the line while she’s cleaning the counter and has a plexi glass barrier and a mask. I was livid.
1328547447686066178 2020-11-17 11:56:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen. About as sad as paying to be hugged. Yet ppl keep reminding me how bad capitalism is. 🙄  https://t.co/GfgDDRcP3x
1328546727662534657 2020-11-17 11:53:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s really sad is having a terrorist like you in our government.
1328546431494340608 2020-11-17 11:52:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sorry, but I have my own debt and I don’t expect anyone else to pay for it. It’s pretty fkin selfish to want to STEAL other ppl’s money for YOUR DEBT. Are you sure you got an economics degree?
1328545619032477698 2020-11-17 11:48:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Or what?
1328545010157985792 2020-11-17 11:46:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker They would have no reason to hide who they are working for by deleting their whole profiles.
1328543779867947008 2020-11-17 11:41:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Are ppl not allowed to check who ppl have worked for on LinkedIn?   That’s what the site is for isn’t it? Also the right doesnt doxx ppl like the left does to ruin their lives.
1328527000315723777 2020-11-17 10:34:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nothing to see here folks this is all completely NORMAL..
1328515649195237376 2020-11-17 09:49:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tampke Very weird. What are they afraid of?
1328506113923248133 2020-11-17 09:11:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The audit hasn’t been done yet.
1328501424087416832 2020-11-17 08:53:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap Lol  https://t.co/RVT3euYHqy
1328500732543209472 2020-11-17 08:50:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @bidoofisgoat You’re defending the CCP over the US because YOURE dumb not me.   You like them so much go live there and then tell us how that goes.
1328500458269278208 2020-11-17 08:49:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @bidoofisgoat What have we done to Muslims in the US?   Terrorists blow themselves up you lawn flamingo. Islamic terrorist kill their own more than we ever could.   If we treat them so poorly why tf do they want to come here you ignorant heifer?
1328499855447060482 2020-11-17 08:47:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap Sexism!
1328498044178890753 2020-11-17 08:39:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s actually an attack on femininity and women. A woman could have modeled those clothes instead a man did. I wonder how this affects the wage gap between men and women?
1328495856341839872 2020-11-17 08:31:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @bidoofisgoat Remind me do we harvest our citizens organs and put them in re-education camps?   Maybe you should stop defending the atrocities of the CCP you pos!
1328465069273870336 2020-11-17 06:28:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @necktitties79 Some ppl don’t like variety I guess.
1328460601820016640 2020-11-17 06:11:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So are you suggesting POC are broke and can’t pay off their OWN debt?   Maybe they should trade those Jordans they looted and pay for their fkin education.
1328459814209425408 2020-11-17 06:07:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @smiththetrucker @seanhannity I guess you don’t live in CA. The state doesn’t need to lockdown when most counties aren’t dealing with the same  COVID issues as places like LA.   So stfu you ignorant fk.  https://t.co/6QaFfnz6yj
1328429631616081921 2020-11-17 04:07:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then why do trans men try so hard?
1328413733043912706 2020-11-17 03:04:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RationalCalm In her eyes you probably should.
1328413632783208449 2020-11-17 03:04:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s like AOC is saying I should get a credit card for $50k and when I can’t pay the bill ask her to pay it off and others because that’s “the right thing to do”.   YOUR DEBT isn’t MY PROBLEM!
1328412482289815554 2020-11-17 02:59:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not when ppl who have had to earn their way and couldn’t go to college are now paying for those who decided to go to college and couldn’t really afford it.
1328365253386670080 2020-11-16 23:52:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And they want us to take their claims of UNITY seriously while these fkin shitbags call us Nazis and MAGAts?   Richard is a pos human being.
1328364552447086592 2020-11-16 23:49:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is that a legit question Ian? C’mon man.
1328364236758663169 2020-11-16 23:48:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Humans should really stop raping animals.
1328363678542880775 2020-11-16 23:45:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 100%.
1328363391644172288 2020-11-16 23:44:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JodiDoering should be fired this is so immoral and disgusting for an RN to speak about her dying patients like this on CNN. Claiming they are hateful while they are dying is fkin gross.
1328361019253559297 2020-11-16 23:35:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 @EmmanuelMacron  https://t.co/lBOeOM5N60
1328355554897526790 2020-11-16 23:13:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So does this mean only Trump’s tweets about the election are censored?  https://t.co/7CKHCaN16h
1328355270305611776 2020-11-16 23:12:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sorry Jim, but phone calls by foreign leaders to “projected” winners don’t legitimize elections. @EmmanuelMacron should have waited.
1328354193782960128 2020-11-16 23:08:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheRISEofROD @stillgray Now women have to fight men over clothes? Can we have nothing for ourselves ffs.
1328204575975698433 2020-11-16 13:13:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Like clockwork... 🤣  https://t.co/GhoGBvsuvE
1328201651090464768 2020-11-16 13:02:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ruffin_Shot :’( I don’t think I could ever eat my dog no matter how hungry I was.
1328201337687875587 2020-11-16 13:00:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Obama is a divisive hateful pos.
1328199427903766536 2020-11-16 12:53:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Until YOU find out they stole the primaries from you because they needed an establishment politician like Biden to win the nomination. 🤷🏻‍♀️   Let’s be real here Bernie.. who had more enthusiasm you or Biden?
1328198623411146753 2020-11-16 12:50:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anonymo36668694 @infobee There’s really ZERO excuse for treating anyone like that over their politics. FKING ZERO!   The left is a plague and requires some serious culling.
1328197970190241792 2020-11-16 12:47:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 😩 NOOOOOOOOOOO!
1328197473714675712 2020-11-16 12:45:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Prolife_Sam Great job Sam. He’s beautiful. ♥️
1328196880740716544 2020-11-16 12:43:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now that’s an idea..
1328196764801765376 2020-11-16 12:42:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @infobee This made me so angry.
1328195765215260672 2020-11-16 12:38:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s the point of debating when you have candidates running campaigns on ZOOM from their basements, calling lids by 10am and never having to answer questions besides what kinda ice cream you like?
1328193696139886594 2020-11-16 12:30:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Was this while your husband was out in his boat using your name to avoid punishment for being outdoors?
1328192895841550336 2020-11-16 12:27:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess you don’t know that 2.8M Americans die every year and that average deaths PER MONTH is about 233k.  https://t.co/aCublwxa1b
1328191236759457793 2020-11-16 12:20:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @imitationbacun @CoreyEric1 Cucks. Lol
1328190162291941376 2020-11-16 12:16:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Oh I forgot to mention after one of their sexcapades he left cum all over her dress too.
1328189705800728576 2020-11-16 12:14:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good looks like the death rate is gonna be less than 1% real soon once more than 99% are in the recovered column.  https://t.co/V463Za45rN

1328188054519988225 2020-11-16 12:08:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> WE need some actual evidence and actions Rudy we are really tired of this sh*t taking so long.
1328187255400271873 2020-11-16 12:04:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 They clearly gave no clue.
1328186975497592833 2020-11-16 12:03:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AbleWlng I love the blue feet.
1328186912989868032 2020-11-16 12:03:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m guessing Bill Clinton held “conservative views” when he fked an intern in the Oval and shoved a cigar in her pussy?
1328186170610618368 2020-11-16 12:00:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoo. I’m sorry but were they ever called racists and white supremacists while we know Hillary called black youth “super predators”?
1328185659077496833 2020-11-16 11:58:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Maybe not in Texas they mentioned PA. Do you live in PA?
1328185511370911746 2020-11-16 11:57:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You mean like your MOM got over LOSING in 2016? Free speech is tricky isn’t it?
1328185085795790849 2020-11-16 11:56:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Probably political leaflets that are sent in the mail.
1328183978734489600 2020-11-16 11:51:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola That’s awesome.
1328183872589234178 2020-11-16 11:51:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pi_mij I know what that’s supposed to be, but clearly a MAN created it.
1328182844577837057 2020-11-16 11:47:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AbleWlng Most men I’ve come across are of this opinion.

1328160379726229505 2020-11-16 10:18:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why are you using gendered terms like “guys”? That’s transphobic.
1328157749125869568 2020-11-16 10:07:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> A potluck is voluntary contribution of food you heifer. Socialism is like going to the potluck not bringing a damn thing and serving yourself 10 plates and then 5 to take home.

1328062038233419776 2020-11-16 03:47:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s because the UK claims that charging POC with crimes they commit is racist. So they are fked until you change that stupid illogical mentality.

1327798729437429760 2020-11-15 10:21:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Our election was hijacked. There is no question. Americans and the president have a duty to protect our democracy and follow the facts!
1327798285478707200 2020-11-15 10:19:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Yes it reminds me of their meme of the screaming leftist with a photoshopped MAGA hat on. 🤣
1327798106021261313 2020-11-15 10:18:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey @MrAndyNgo @stillgray do you know the back story of this clip? The left is trying to claim they are a Trump supporter I doubt it since he said he took a MAGA shirt.
1327797773861748736 2020-11-15 10:17:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Pancakes are delicious.
1327797409322176515 2020-11-15 10:15:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PolitiBunny @TheJimmyRiviera Clearly his #bekind hashtag in his bio means sh*t.

1327796471048011776 2020-11-15 10:12:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Stealing a MAGA shirt is not something a Trump supporter does you clown! That’s one of YOURS. 😂
1327795970793357312 2020-11-15 10:10:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What pathetic is your sorry leftist fascist ass obsessing over what other ppl have the freedom to do while dehumanizing them.

1327791806705065984 2020-11-15 09:53:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 Just like Marx who it’s seems suffered from some serious health issues that had him covered in boils so he couldn’t work hence why he liked the idea of communism and died stateless.

1327789781170880512 2020-11-15 09:45:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The liberal fascist cockroaches are in full swing tonight. All out of control because Trump supporters dared to come out in support of the president in places their hateful ideology rules.   The fascism of the left blue wavers who voted for swamp rats.
1327788706481074179 2020-11-15 09:41:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Says the guy that voted for a literal basement dweller for president.
1327785560388235264 2020-11-15 09:28:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anonymo36668694 I’m fkin livid. If they wanted less and less ppl to side with them they are getting their wish. I guess they think 73M Americans is a small amount.   They are allowing the radicals to define their party. I’ll never vote Democrat in my life again. They made sure of it.
1327783499235950592 2020-11-15 09:20:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks to me like they they fked around and found out. 🤷🏻‍♀️

1327735550887960576 2020-11-15 06:09:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 It was their attempt to troll #MillionMAGAMarch2020 not sure how but they wanted the k p o p stans to help on TikTok. Then it got switched to #MarchForTrump and they didn’t know what to do. So they kept posting pancakes. 🤷🏻‍♀️ These ppl don’t even know how to troll.

1327688332357234688 2020-11-15 03:02:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SullyBobbi As soon as Trump came out rejecting the results like clockwork the media mentioned COVID and deaths again and how we can’t have family gatherings while they all took to the streets to celebrate a Biden “victory”.   Yea I’m pretty over their hypocritical bs. They can fuck off.
1327687547946864640 2020-11-15 02:59:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha and? I’m sure Willie Brown was “nice” to @KamalaHarris as well. You gonna write about that?

1327674349487226880 2020-11-15 02:06:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NaveedAJamali @JoyAnnReid Considering that’s leftist utopia DC it’s pretty amazing, but then you salty mfkers can’t help but hate.   Great example of an actual PEACEFUL PROTEST. 🇺🇸#MarchForTrump
1327673803040722944 2020-11-15 02:04:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then what are you worried about?
1327673479106228227 2020-11-15 02:03:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 73M KKK members in DC now that would be something.  https://t.co/4XHCEjAhqy

Are you going to validate that with your actions because your 6 yr old believes it to be true in their heart of hearts and telling them the truth is too hard?
1327671524908621824 2020-11-15 01:55:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @james44090700 @GeraltofPDX1 @BurningStaarIV @Chrisbryan_dcm Giving children who haven’t gone thru puberty who believe are a different gender hormones *is* abuse.   The physical trauma that can lead to later in life because of stunted development is a serious issue that has to be dealt with by medical experts.
1327659348072382465 2020-11-15 01:07:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dblurry16 Seems that way. Imagine thinking mocking men dressed like this makes you a good person. 😂
1327659108548313089 2020-11-15 01:06:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s funny is @USATODAY is claiming @EpochTimes is a “conservative outlet” that’s hated by China.   Translation: @EpochTimes is TRUSTWORTHY and not corrupted by China.  https://t.co/2WhroPK1lq
1327657248714231809 2020-11-15 00:58:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EricVldw She’s a virtue signaling pendeja.
1327657116883054597 2020-11-15 00:58:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The LEFT ruins everything with their bullshit.

1327656223353626625 2020-11-15 00:54:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left thinks this dies once Trump is replaced. It doesn’t. It’s a huge national populist movement against those who would seek to destroy our country and way of life. #MarchForTrump 🇺🇸
1327654472152010753 2020-11-15 00:47:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @slevinBad_Dog That’s so your face Steven.
1327653876195987456 2020-11-15 00:45:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @slevinBad_Dog Definitely.
1327653598164000769 2020-11-15 00:44:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anonymo36668694 Haha thx. I have a good face for these.

1327648070134157315 2020-11-15 00:22:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe y’all shouldn’t have been calling us racists and white supremacists for 4 fking years.   So F U C K  O F F!
1327647369844776960 2020-11-15 00:19:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Y’all been supporting marches since May now all of a sudden you’re suggesting ppl stay home and stay safe? 🤣🤡 Who says you won?
1327646768473882624 2020-11-15 00:17:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @YouTube fascists!
1327640267441074176 2020-11-14 23:51:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s go! 🇺🇸 Stay safe!
1327639557957844992 2020-11-14 23:48:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This guy thinks doctors tell patients with pneumonia to go home and sleep it off. Your “friend” went into the hospital in March was diagnosed with COVID and never left. Your friends situation was NOT the norm.   So you lying about what doctors were saying doesn’t help.  https://t.co/E1f67tkp48
1327639429205217281 2020-11-14 23:48:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Marlow seems to have trouble with strong opinionated women with a higher education than his own. Not surprising for a soy chugger.
1327639275320446976 2020-11-14 23:47:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea I don’t think throwing bricks at officers, calling them pigs, starting fires and looting places constitutes “peaceful”.   Here you have BLM protestors being Peaceful AF.  https://t.co/UZI7EfYrqH
1327639145175343104 2020-11-14 23:46:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So in trying to mock the #proudboys you mock men who cross dress as Wonder Woman? Bravo leftist bigot.
1327485386600316928 2020-11-14 13:35:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea this sh*t isn’t good.. why does the left trust these ppl?    https://t.co/PpsZp9G8tS
1327482490118803456 2020-11-14 13:24:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Totally crazy.

1327478938386395136 2020-11-14 13:10:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then I saw this... 👀  https://t.co/FWdDepOW8b
1327478682840039426 2020-11-14 13:09:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Has anyone else ever looked into the Bronfman family (same Bronfmans that were associated with NXIVM) and their ties to politics?    https://t.co/qSw1L6EbVU
1327473117275451392 2020-11-14 12:47:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ram41662 It’s a trip what these ppl allowed to happen to them under the guise of self “PROGRESS”.   Raniere used women to seduce women into the cult. Women basically trusted other women to protect them. Never thinking that these women weren’t helping them at all just setting them up.
1327470451526754304 2020-11-14 12:36:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ConstantineM @Ja1Ke3 @oktrainwreck @DaleMoss Looks like he was diagnosed with pneumonia initially according to his wife. This from the NYT. This isn’t the norm.. most ppl who contract COVID do not die or require hospitalization.  https://t.co/PtjJ2f8bT3
1327466971814719488 2020-11-14 12:22:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These nutters can’t live without us.
1327446459231346688 2020-11-14 11:01:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This first episode ended with ppl in a circle hugging at a Vday (Vanguard Day) singing, “all we are saying is give Keith a chance”.   I’m sure for some that was the worst mistake of their lives.   👇🏼 NXIVM Recruitment mixer  https://t.co/8p2FfZMe1x
1327443723345543168 2020-11-14 10:50:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @yamargie1 @thechrisbuskirk @MajorPatriot It’s proof that fraud exists by democrats as far back as 1995 in PA. The fact the judge is already dead means leftists can’t doxx, harass and cancel them.
1327442758240399360 2020-11-14 10:46:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They mentioned this course called JNESS which was a session for women to understand women. It was sold my Salzman as “the first course for women about women created by a man a special man”. Those that study cults mentioned it was pure misogyny.   Raniere was a master manipulator.
1327442752859033601 2020-11-14 10:46:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So I’m watching Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult. They mentioned NLP and how ppl can manipulate you with something as simple as the tone of their voices and sounding calm. This man gave an example of the tone and totally reminded me of the way Obama speaks.
1327436855923462144 2020-11-14 10:23:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JonLaveder @KamVTV @BurgessOwens Oh it’s definitely about blue and red. The only reason democrats don’t want there to be a separation as simple as by color is because all the blue areas they run are the areas dealing with riots and destruction. Here’s just a few examples.  https://t.co/LfklnsbL4x
1327435848430673921 2020-11-14 10:19:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hell yes!!!

1327422368155717632 2020-11-14 09:25:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Johnnydecamp14 @theTurya3 @Krakoan4Life The “southern strategy” is just Dems trying to vilify their opponents anyway they can during elections. If they could make ppl believe that the Republican Party served as a vehicle of white supremacy in the south then why would black ppl ever support them?  https://t.co/9vj46GXKdY
1327419594160541696 2020-11-14 09:14:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @theTurya3 @Krakoan4Life So wait the “switch” took place in the 60s? So are you saying Lyndon B Johnson was a Republican who switched to Democrat and signed the civil rights laws?   So Abe Lincoln was still a Republican who freed the slaves while democrats wanted to keep them enslaved?
1327416891023925249 2020-11-14 09:03:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> All this UNITY is amazing. I’m sure Hispanics who voted for Trump haven’t been called spics and racists by racist leftists scum since yesterday.   https://t.co/Pnx1rCvEzt
1327412390091055104 2020-11-14 08:45:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imjasondiamond So what you’re saying is Tim Allen is awesome and welcome in OREGON.

1327410791046287360 2020-11-14 08:39:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s happening?
1327410575966576640 2020-11-14 08:38:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 @SurvivorKitty Good lord. Help us.
1327410417073672193 2020-11-14 08:38:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you think Breonna is easier to pronounce than Cori? Kamala is an Indian name btw. You knew that right?  https://t.co/xC9CYkcw68
1327406449379614721 2020-11-14 08:22:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @maddenifico This is NOT true..  1. Georgia is doing a manual count 2. Lawsuits are happening across the country.  https://t.co/T3M9TnyVqB
1327404920169918466 2020-11-14 08:16:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now it all makes sense.   https://t.co/4zN5dilCdc
1327403726814859265 2020-11-14 08:11:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sure that’s not what they thought. Nice attempt to brand republicans on day one of orientation @CoriBush.
1327400958729457665 2020-11-14 08:00:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EmersenLee She doesn’t care she just likes having any kind of power and being relevant again.
1327400701492805633 2020-11-14 07:59:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Matt_Cates @Nate_Cohn Iran. While we fund their terrorism again.
1327400463159808000 2020-11-14 07:58:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Beotch what have democrats ever done for you but use you for a guaranteed vote? Go on.. they don’t have to do sh*t to get it either. They just claim someone’s racist and there you go. While Biden has a history of actual racism.
1327399842864189440 2020-11-14 07:55:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jasontake2 Yup. Gotta keep it new. Lol
1327399452701728768 2020-11-14 07:54:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is it final when Georgia is doing a hand count that just started today?  https://t.co/GSKuIkHAvE

1327397122711293952 2020-11-14 07:45:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> More reasons to get rid of Tik Tok.
1327396509088845825 2020-11-14 07:42:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SteveOnSpeed Yep several and they ALL survived. Even the one I knew who was on a vent.
1327396084759490560 2020-11-14 07:41:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RaeOfHope808 I don’t feel sorry for these fks. A vote for Joe was a vote to ruin your business. Congrats.
1327395845977694208 2020-11-14 07:40:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden would gladly blow up Mount Rushmore to appease the radicals, but sure.
1327395316035846144 2020-11-14 07:37:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well elections have consequences. You clearly voted for more lockdowns while expecting Democrats to bail you out. You made your bed. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1327394585601970176 2020-11-14 07:35:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now that I think about it how many ppl in the swamp and involved in our government do you think took NXIVM courses?
1327393140496429056 2020-11-14 07:29:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @georgie_porgie Biden is going to just bring back all the swamp Trump tried so hard to get rid of.   Yea even Killary.. The people who voted for Trump DID vote for COUNTRY over party because Trump isn’t even a Republican. The rest of you voted for the swamp and establishment garbage.  https://t.co/YM9ky3Ybr8
1327392126116655104 2020-11-14 07:25:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ravagiing They are fkin criminals and make up all kinds of sh*t. Just like Russians helping Trump in 2016.
1327391752991358976 2020-11-14 07:23:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s NOT what he said you lying sack of shiet. So instead of it going to waste there it can go somewhere else until Cuomo decides to accept it.  https://t.co/keLoiLmN7J
1327390436541886465 2020-11-14 07:18:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So all those NEVER TRUMPERS and people who said they’d never vote for Trump because of his character...not to worry.. I’m sure Biden would never think of placing someone like Hillary in his cabinet while decrying UNITY...  https://t.co/Bm4CqWE7Zv
1327381231156097030 2020-11-14 06:42:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion Or Jessica Tarlov. Good grief.
1327380942143451136 2020-11-14 06:40:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’ve been saying...
1327380804301852672 2020-11-14 06:40:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @rational_actor1 Been saying that for months. 2M+ Americans die every year. Seems to me like we are right on track.
1327378146203631617 2020-11-14 06:29:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KerJTalit Right?! I want to pull my hair out every time he speaks. I’m just watching thinking is he joking?   Jesse: We are testing double the amount of ppl we did last month. It was 800k now it’s 1.6M.   Juan: We aren’t testing more and we have more cases.   Me: Math escapes Juan.
1327377246609260545 2020-11-14 06:26:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DeaconDrake I just can’t. He’s beyond stupid. He wants us just to accept the results while they never accepted the results from 2016. Like are you fkin serious?   The left claimed our elections were manipulated by Russians but can’t be manipulated by them? Dumbest sh*t ever.
1327375075876634624 2020-11-14 06:17:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Juan Williams is the dumbest person on The Five.
1327374927192702976 2020-11-14 06:16:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @greggutfeld: Cases are increasing because we are testing more ppl.   Juan: No they are not  Greg: Yes they are Juan. We’ve increased testing.   @TheJuanWilliams: Cases are increasing because we are testing more.  https://t.co/ETDgAHo0TW
1327371408867876865 2020-11-14 06:02:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonaldTrump spoke today and answered ZERO questions for the media. I think he should continue to do this for the rest of this year.   Not give them anything so they can see what their news days will be like without being able to take him out of context.   Fk them.  https://t.co/U33tdcXlgb
1327370137519882240 2020-11-14 05:57:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How hard will it be when they destroy the constitution they claim to defend?
1327369788536995840 2020-11-14 05:56:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> NBC with more of their Chicken Little propaganda. Colder seasons bring more hospitalizations. Especially if you have HIGH homeless populations who want some days out of the cold and 3 meals a day on the tax payer dime.
1327367436065144832 2020-11-14 05:47:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea I don’t even like @mcuban’s political ideology. I hope he realizes he made a mistake by siding with the ppl who would gladly cancel him over going against the establishment he protected during this election.
1327366674593431552 2020-11-14 05:44:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine being such asshoes that you criticize someone like @mcuban for tweeting donate to food banks instead of DEMONRAT races? Yea those are the type of ppl that you elected. The ones who care more about power than Americans. Congrats!  https://t.co/iV0xaxccnY
1327365589816406017 2020-11-14 05:39:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine attacking a man for just being polite to ppl he meets including the president. The left is a fkin hate filled plague.
1327363994869407745 2020-11-14 05:33:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Pobre.
1327361414260953088 2020-11-14 05:23:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @usa22018 Leftists in SF: Why don’t things change in SF?!   Also Leftists in SF: Let’s vote for Pelosi she’ll get it done eventually I mean she has promised it for over 30 yrs!! Pelosi for progress!!  https://t.co/6SLQIioJTo
1327359662941900800 2020-11-14 05:16:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Want to see where Joe Biden’s 4M+ over Trump mostly comes from? I really doubt all of that light blue in the map without ballot harvesting and targeting the homeless and elderly in these areas to trade money for signatures. Demonrats are immoral.  https://t.co/EeM4aO8Zoa
1327358450754457601 2020-11-14 05:11:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Also the leading causes of death in CA and they think I should be scared of COVID? Wonder how many of those Medicare patients that “died of COVID” had any of these comorbities before COVID complications was listed as the death reason?🤔  https://t.co/N36qCrEW9p
1327356794247684096 2020-11-14 05:04:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SteveMoney274 Because he’s actually sane not some neo scum who wants to keep us in useless wars paying for everyone around the world.
1327356420400967680 2020-11-14 05:03:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’ll take these fkin odds. #freedom 🇺🇸  https://t.co/uzYNvIn0p1
1327355811618668544 2020-11-14 05:01:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RaeOfHope808 He didn’t if ppl did anything they voted against TRUMP not for BIDEN.   If Trump loses I hope he runs in 2024 and republicans get a super majority.   The left believes without Trump in office this enthusiasm for the country changes. They are sadly mistaken.
1327355296486883328 2020-11-14 04:58:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What you morons don’t seem to understand is 10 ballots and ppl coming forward about fraud in our elections is TOO MUCH. How many fkin examples do you fkin need?
1327354629265321984 2020-11-14 04:56:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So lying to the president and the American people is something you think is funny? So having more neo scum in our government is something you think is a good thing?
1327354095204659201 2020-11-14 04:54:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I believe ballot purchases are abundant in CA especially now that we legally allow ballot harvesting. I wouldn’t put anything past demonrats to get a vote. They’ll shop the NURSING HOMES and take advantage of our elderly. They have no morals.
1327353434194931712 2020-11-14 04:51:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @avanesor @ToddlerDon @realDonaldTrump I agree Joe Biden is a danger to himself and others.
1327353105466286082 2020-11-14 04:50:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EvanAKilgore @TheDemocrats Yes.
1327352696110649345 2020-11-14 04:48:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @leeyturner Thank you. :)
1327343945983004673 2020-11-14 04:13:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @leeyturner That’s pretty much my face. I used an app called reface app. It’s fun.
1327323875386875904 2020-11-14 02:54:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheBasedLiberal @mav_the_patriot Trump doesn’t need AZ to get to 270.
1327301705608744962 2020-11-14 01:26:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine being a MAYOR of a city and saying this? Nothing is scarier, nothing? I’m pretty sure having your government put you in camps and harvest your organs is pretty fkin scary. I’m looking at you CCP.
1327299429305524227 2020-11-14 01:16:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Perfect. 👌🏼

1327293165603229696 2020-11-14 00:52:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck Nah he just hates nationalist populists like Trump. Biden might just demand someone be fired or they won’t get money from the US as a form of “foreign policy”.
1327292673330356224 2020-11-14 00:50:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ottawabikeguy @kach022 @HappyManor @JonBatchelor6 @DocDiarmid @timbucktoo14 @enaienei @mattrmedia @raybeale98 @KevinRi41457583 @realDonaldTrump @ChanelRion @OANN Memes aren’t supposed to be that lengthy. Y’all need to take a meme class.
1327292029433352197 2020-11-14 00:47:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh so China and India the biggest fking polluters in the world don’t have to worry but he’s gonna target Brazil?
1327291582874193922 2020-11-14 00:45:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Only because of CA and the ballot harvesting allowed there.
1327291149594152960 2020-11-14 00:44:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This..
1327290204026064898 2020-11-14 00:40:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh we’ve know this for a while. They need ppl to panic.
1327289819798458368 2020-11-14 00:38:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Lol.
1327289759169880064 2020-11-14 00:38:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker The dominion software was found to have changed 6000 votes that were for Trump and went to Biden in just one county.   If you believe that all votes down ballot have to change as well when you create a hack YOU’D be wrong.    https://t.co/zf1J00iMyY
1327289631369437185 2020-11-14 00:38:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They didn’t use the Dominion machines in Texas they were rejected by the SOS in 2019 for their known issues.  https://t.co/zf1J00iMyY
1327285830260383744 2020-11-14 00:22:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian We can’t be friends..  https://t.co/PieTdXAA2O
1327284851255304199 2020-11-14 00:19:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So once this is over... (R) will be at 213 and (D) will still have the majority but barely? 😂 and somehow they want us to believe Trump lost?  https://t.co/zJ6aK4elSW
1327283051089387521 2020-11-14 00:11:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 I mean we are PAST the point of NO RETURN so what’s the point of trying clearly it’s a lost cause.
1327279782095069184 2020-11-13 23:58:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is that insanity Jake? That’s just reality. They don’t know. We still have lawsuits happening and recounts.
1327279439235846147 2020-11-13 23:57:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion @ozm Yep why try we can’t go back now.
1327278691789938690 2020-11-13 23:54:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They’ve given us this same spiel since 1975.  https://t.co/OFyX9uFSnh
1327276123927977990 2020-11-13 23:44:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is why Texas remained RED. These DOMINION “DEMOCRACY” machines were rejected by TX SOS over major flaws in its software.

1327084512572887040 2020-11-13 11:02:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster The fascists tend to dehumanize ppl they don’t like makes it easier to get rid of them that way.   Kinda like serial killers.
1327084265897562112 2020-11-13 11:01:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Funny how when it’s ballots that are gonna be tossed out 2,100 is considered “vanishingly small” but if you have 2,100 dead Americans in a day from COVID that’s a fkin CRISIS!!
1327083716590534656 2020-11-13 10:59:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @business Womp womp..  https://t.co/e0hvV2yBE5
1327083369738379264 2020-11-13 10:58:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Danaiolos @gatewaypundit Sounds like some foreshadowing on your part.
1327082923992915968 2020-11-13 10:56:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But that’s not the only issue pending. We still have the issue with the recount and verifying everything by hand including signatures and not to mention the dominion software.
1327082310986997760 2020-11-13 10:54:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now they’ll fly our flag while ppl like you sh*t on it?
1327077281169227776 2020-11-13 10:34:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Spot on Guy.
1327076539029065729 2020-11-13 10:31:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AgentBigfoot Was yours ball sack face?
1327076301061058560 2020-11-13 10:30:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AgentBigfoot Is that a problem for you FKIN BIGOT?
1327076206248751104 2020-11-13 10:29:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AgentBigfoot Yet here you are speaking.. 🙄 Leftists are such scum.   So he can’t just disagree with you it must be trolling? You ppl stay lost do you even know what TROLLING is? You don’t seem to understand the concept.
1327075236597010433 2020-11-13 10:26:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You can keep calling Biden “President-elect” that doesn’t make it true. @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @GOP why are you suggesting Biden get intelligence briefings?
1327074226319200257 2020-11-13 10:22:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> As if we’d believe anything you say.
1327071411433734144 2020-11-13 10:10:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AOC  https://t.co/gKQ72IZSBY
1327070795122708480 2020-11-13 10:08:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why is getting together with your family going to kill them? FYI ppl have been getting together for months now. Mortality rates for COVID are low compared to survival rates.
1327043192726843394 2020-11-13 08:18:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RaeOfHope808 The leftist morons are out in full force. Like Trump ever said to vote twice. She must watch CNN.
1327043006340349952 2020-11-13 08:18:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> F U C K  Y O U until you stop the protests in the streets ZERO businesses should close. You don’t stop the dregs but want to stop good ppl from working. You’re truly a pos.
1327042381271613442 2020-11-13 08:15:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I thought this wasn’t something that could happen thought y’all said the elections are safe from fraud?   I’d love to know if anyone voted twice along with the dead ppl who’s votes swing entirely for Biden. Weird.
1327041656860807169 2020-11-13 08:12:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> More good news. Fk these ppl
1327041425347727360 2020-11-13 08:11:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M Amen. Fk these leftist criminals. I hope they all rot in hell.
1327041260880740352 2020-11-13 08:11:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These tyrants think they can change whatever laws they want last minute. These ppl hate our country and losing.
1327040779311669248 2020-11-13 08:09:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who called the election? All I’ve seen is Biden is the PROJECTED winner from the media.
1326989485247098880 2020-11-13 04:45:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That would be the case if JOE BIDEN was actually the winner. Y’all wanted mail in ballots now you have to wait until every last legal ballot is counted and the lawsuits are over.
1326988555701248000 2020-11-13 04:41:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @assassinscreed you fked up. They were on a mission to ruin you and you caved. NEVER cave to the mob.
1326987284525166592 2020-11-13 04:36:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m hoping these 2 pull thru as well.  https://t.co/Ewbiotw5dn

1326980190774312960 2020-11-13 04:08:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JakeTimmerman1 @AOC Donating isn’t socialism. Donations are GIVEN voluntarily.   Taxes are TAKEN against my will and given to thinks I don’t support.   Maybe you need to learn some definitions bud.
1326964436578365440 2020-11-13 03:05:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Damn.. 😂
1326964171020255232 2020-11-13 03:04:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeyNada76 @Ja1Ke3 What a loser he is.
1326963979961290752 2020-11-13 03:04:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap @Ja1Ke3 I stand corrected. 😂
1326949603107729409 2020-11-13 02:06:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 How would he ever know if his dick works if he stops following Trump?
1326949365894668290 2020-11-13 02:05:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Just heard a commercial that says cigarettes are RACIST.  https://t.co/qo4Rx6yq0Y

1326942546858188802 2020-11-13 01:38:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Anonymo36668694 So Fkin sick of this pussy sh*t. They were fkin Vikings ffs!   They did things like the blood eagle and they b*tching about “ableist” terms?  https://t.co/RQgGehobBh

1326938214016299008 2020-11-13 01:21:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tf are you apologizing for? If they are offended by the game they don’t have to fkin play. You aren’t going to change history because some ppl are pussies. Grow some fkin balls.
1326913004433182726 2020-11-12 23:41:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SpeakerPelosi Nancy had a press briefing and literally said the vaccine developed under the Trump admin was a gift from God now, I sh*t you not!  https://t.co/sppo1DWUWp
1326909570858573830 2020-11-12 23:27:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He can have an opinion too.
1326908027606355970 2020-11-12 23:21:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The ppl who harvest organs from their citizens and put them in re-education camps want to give advise about the human rights violations they think the US has committed? This is why they needed a pussy like Joe Biden as POTUS.
1326903551294140418 2020-11-12 23:03:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Neoavatara Because viruses do better in cold weather they prefer to latch themselves on to warm bodies in close quarters during these colder months.   Being COVID positive isn’t a death sentence for the majority of ppl.
1326902568535154688 2020-11-12 22:59:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl are fkin mental. The closest we’ve come to fascism is leftists destroying our country and these mfkers wanting to put us on lists.
1326901699143995397 2020-11-12 22:56:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So the ppl that called us racist and Nazis for 4+ yrs now expect us to believe they “care” about what’s happening to our donations? 🖕🏼  https://t.co/wGgY7l2RZm
1326901030563491841 2020-11-12 22:53:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good lord no wonder Trump is losing in key states. Ppl like this needed to do everything in their power to make it happen.  Fkin criminals.
1326775759638245378 2020-11-12 14:36:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let me know when the left was ever peaceful after Trump won?  https://t.co/tsRWGAS2eI
1326771435101151232 2020-11-12 14:18:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl It’s their job to patrol language and exactly why it has the opposite affect.
1326770643434676228 2020-11-12 14:15:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoo. Biden is a fkin basement dwelling loser.

1326621736587071488 2020-11-12 04:24:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like another projection folks. I have a question has it ever taken this long to count ballots in Alaska?  https://t.co/fZEB8SUGqS
1326620146505457664 2020-11-12 04:17:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’d like to know when science was missing @chicagosmayor?
1326607456718315520 2020-11-12 03:27:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> YOU chose WARS over this country when you decided to endorse an establishment politician you fkin clown.
1326583667011907584 2020-11-12 01:52:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @Twitter Luckily he isn’t the only whistleblower out there. There are over 100.
1326582531404132355 2020-11-12 01:48:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @Twitter Because casting doubt against claims of fraud is the medias job.   Unless of course Russians are involved and changed an election.
1326571589047996418 2020-11-12 01:04:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DavidNakamura @Jordanfabian Well looks like they were granted access so...  https://t.co/TEFMsaG7S3
1326571308344172544 2020-11-12 01:03:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And? You petty fks! They are socially distanced and outside. They don’t need to virtue signal like Biden’s fkin clown ass does.
1326549802176245766 2020-11-11 23:38:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So which is it @Twitter?  https://t.co/NlOvIYZfir
1326548659903766531 2020-11-11 23:33:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why do you think black and brown ppl are incapable of casting legal ballots Shay?
1326547658681430017 2020-11-11 23:29:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I think it’s funny when these ppl talk about “peaceful transition of power”. It’s almost like they forgot about the last 4 yrs.  https://t.co/sigTR481oo
1326546290285576199 2020-11-11 23:24:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s about not accepting the results by both sides. If you can’t seem to understand that simple concept then most everything else I’m sure is lost on ppl like you.
1326545906045317123 2020-11-11 23:22:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> There’s been no undermining. Why should Biden have access when the election is not official yet?
1326394309885767687 2020-11-11 13:20:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PhenomenalBC @yashar I’m sorry but were there fraud claims by democrats for the Tillis race? If so feel free to request a recount. Unlike some we would like a fair and free election and no doubt that our candidates won.
1326393633927557123 2020-11-11 13:17:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If there’s a question on the Tillis race and Dems want to come forward claiming fraud let them. We don’t mind a recount. That’s what you don’t seem to understand Yashar.
1326380729887051777 2020-11-11 12:26:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Yamiche Weird the postal worker has claimed he didn’t recant in a video. He was also retaliated against and put on leave without pay. So when will @Twitter put a banner on @washingtonpost’s lie?  https://t.co/bLkyawqDUI
1326365132151091201 2020-11-11 11:24:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pi_mij  https://t.co/f2HdMlTbTa
1326359052452982784 2020-11-11 11:00:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pi_mij They are college educated tho. Here I thought I was taxed every time I got a check. I’m glad she cleared that up for me.
1326354091212107776 2020-11-11 10:40:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pi_mij Heard she created another video to try to clear it all up and doubled down on her dumb.
1326353324002607109 2020-11-11 10:37:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good lord..
1326347576501661696 2020-11-11 10:14:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We haven’t confirmed the election. So why would you expect any other world leader do it?
1326344584385851393 2020-11-11 10:02:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is this NOT like the party in 1984 again? Freedom is Slavery • Ignorance is Truth • War is Peace
1326341974236917761 2020-11-11 09:52:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MaxRose4NY are you going to concede your election? 🤣 No way Republicans win this many seats across the state and Trump loses.  https://t.co/AIQG0qFRk6
1326340771096662017 2020-11-11 09:47:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> *a college educated. Ffs. I hate my fkin phone.
1326339669177430018 2020-11-11 09:43:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is a perfect example of an “college educated” democrat voter.
1326337704590651393 2020-11-11 09:35:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now feminism shouldn’t be represented by a female figure?   Can leftist MALES just not let us have anything for ourselves NOT even feminism? Ffs.  https://t.co/7Bm4EbWAtn
1326328431282319360 2020-11-11 08:58:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LennyDykstra @nypost @KirFlem Because only the “women” with penises don’t know where their vaginas are. They seem to think it was misplaced.
1326311664468205568 2020-11-11 07:51:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 Not sure how.    https://t.co/oEZ8jTEFDi
1326305791951843328 2020-11-11 07:28:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SleepyNBA @RyanAFournier Not yet.. 🙂
1326305560996667393 2020-11-11 07:27:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well isn’t that just tragic. 🤣
1326295987665526784 2020-11-11 06:49:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Troy75801 Yup sure am same @HarleyMonster on PARLER.
1326295598211846144 2020-11-11 06:48:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why does Cindy think WE give af what she thinks? That’s laughable.
1326294399563624448 2020-11-11 06:43:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @syl_capulet1  https://t.co/DZnu8lRcOB
1326289886735839233 2020-11-11 06:25:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So was there not “a substantial number” of dead ppl who voted or not “a single instance”? 🤔  https://t.co/WNVvSUPTkU
1326288863250141186 2020-11-11 06:21:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Cocaine Mitch is back y’all.   https://t.co/JBETjfL8nb
1326288045058871296 2020-11-11 06:18:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey @ProjectLincoln how about them fkin apples?!  https://t.co/cp6wh4PFM2
1326287293141807104 2020-11-11 06:15:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 Well good luck on shutting my ass up. They just make me want to do it more. They are deranged.
1326287042129522688 2020-11-11 06:14:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey @twitter when you gonna put a banner on this since it was fact checked as FALSE. To be clear it’s not “inaccurate” it’s FALSE!! Put the banner.  https://t.co/xsbftS3DI0
1326284650197626880 2020-11-11 06:04:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How about WE can say whatever tf we want! Capeesh? Fkin nutters think they can control OUR language.
1326283734857871360 2020-11-11 06:00:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @princesspolygon @SeanNeutron And you’re just dumb so what’s your point?
1326283258980569088 2020-11-11 05:59:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EmDashPython @TMalkier @guardian I’m sorry, but how are they suppressing anyone when the voter rolls are cleaned up? They can easily register again if necessary. No one stops them from doing that.   Republicans are masters at what? Making sure voter rolls don’t have 1000s of ineligible voters on them?
1326282495457816576 2020-11-11 05:56:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheNeithan @PpollingNumbers @DecisionDeskHQ If you feel that is the case feel free to request a recount. As a conservative I rather we be absolutely sure before declaring a victory.
1326282105471430663 2020-11-11 05:54:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @FibbyYoung @PpollingNumbers @DecisionDeskHQ Unlike you we like transparency and fair and free elections so please feel free to request a recount in the presence of both republicans and democrat observers if you feel something is not right.
1326281575210786816 2020-11-11 05:52:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s one...
1326281158414327808 2020-11-11 05:50:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BenDove55776180 Tell it.
1326271801484214272 2020-11-11 05:13:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Of course because they are panicking.
1326271270225289216 2020-11-11 05:11:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @triton6346 Nope
1326269817981083653 2020-11-11 05:05:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> While his FBI spied on the Trump campaign? Yea sell this sh*t to someone else WE ain’t buying it!
1326269451466022912 2020-11-11 05:04:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GTrevise8 @EpochTimes Right? I’ve noticed that about them as well. This isn’t going away.
1326267607100522497 2020-11-11 04:56:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EpochTimes is pretty middle of the road when it comes to their articles. This is a problem.   https://t.co/wGdFzBs2b0
1326262763052699648 2020-11-11 04:37:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Of course she was.. who’s fkin surprised? These fkin cockroaches are all over DC and infecting our government. They want to destroy our republic!!  https://t.co/dXfTalZY4w
1326258044758499328 2020-11-11 04:18:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What happened @ProjectLincoln afraid your fascism is showing?  https://t.co/rgxhTeYRZQ
1326244960593588226 2020-11-11 03:26:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The plot. 😂  https://t.co/iDv0NfmMOl
1326243679875395584 2020-11-11 03:21:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You should know Jim you’ve been attempting to convince ppl 2+2 is 5, war is peace, ignorance is truth and freedom is slavery for years.  https://t.co/3f1FHk80sa
1326242289828519937 2020-11-11 03:16:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Isn’t this considered retaliation?
1326241163213369344 2020-11-11 03:11:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> *always. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1326240812519182336 2020-11-11 03:10:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @UrBetsyJean No I don’t.
1326237553901498368 2020-11-11 02:57:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Proof these ppl will never be ok. Imagine if we took to the streets created a dummy with Bidens face on it and started beating it like this. 😂
1326237130041958400 2020-11-11 02:55:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @debipisaro @abigailmarone @ChanelRion This is how miserable 75M ppl are after claiming to win an election?  https://t.co/VS1WHGkua8
1326235890763485184 2020-11-11 02:50:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jaketapper You call this a peaceful transfer of power Jake? We see your character as shit and you still have a job.  https://t.co/wEC1KB8aNj
1326227783752638464 2020-11-11 02:18:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AskGoo @PrisonPlanet Maybe focus on your own country instead of ours.   They haven’t all been counted and lawsuits are happening.
1326226386319626240 2020-11-11 02:13:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @davydawg @realDailyWire When you call a president illegitimate and state you will begin impeachment on day one have you really accepted the election results?   Guess we should do the same..  https://t.co/J15VTENnhB
1326224094489055233 2020-11-11 02:03:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Back in Dec 2019 @guardian suggested cleaning up voter roles was Republicans trying to “rig” an election. Funny how rigging an election is now literally impossible and some whacky conspiracy when the left is being accused of it.    https://t.co/UQFCNLLeP0
1326215717801189377 2020-11-11 01:30:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 Yep.. the leftist pundits have a look of worry on their faces.   For all we know he could have got a txt from what’s app he didn’t want to get. 😂
1326214380673851392 2020-11-11 01:25:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tina_Boz0820 I heart you so Tina. 😂
1326213750169350149 2020-11-11 01:22:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Hung_Hippo No reason to be, it will eventually click. Not everyone sees it right away.
1326211164347359232 2020-11-11 01:12:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> C’mon Tim you are smarter than this.
1326210943055917056 2020-11-11 01:11:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well it’s confusing when those “women” have a PENIS while claiming they use tampons/pads and need to have a Pap smear.  https://t.co/zOGapsrlJI
1326210269614272512 2020-11-11 01:09:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I think Ken is having a bad day. 💀

1326208808612327425 2020-11-11 01:03:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mulderlr Everyone needs a laugh that’s why it’s my pinned tweet. 😂

1326208410115731456 2020-11-11 01:01:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Troy75801 They sound so worried don’t they? If they are so comfortable in their leads and the fact that fraud isn’t something to worry about then they should be a lot more calm.
1326207637160038401 2020-11-11 00:58:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RosemaryRunner @politicalamity2 @kruser3 @GovTimWalz Did you know 2M+ Americans die every year without COVID on average? 200k+ deaths a month is normal in the US.   The fact remains the left used COVID deaths as a political talking point. They never emphasized the survival rates. Now ask yourself why?  https://t.co/HZviqPRVIj
1326205255244148736 2020-11-11 00:49:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 @syl_capulet1 @EmersenLee Thanks J.  https://t.co/UuV7EWcKzX
1326200094731902976 2020-11-11 00:28:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> FYI.. this was just 22 hrs ago. We should just demand a recount in all these states and with republican observers within 6 ft of ballot counters + verify all signatures.  https://t.co/3Lcd9LVJa3
1326198119604744192 2020-11-11 00:20:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Winst0n1984 That was pollsters and Clinton in 2016.
1326198025606193153 2020-11-11 00:20:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian It’s the butter isn’t it?
1326196932969050112 2020-11-11 00:16:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Voting fraud is increasingly rare, but somehow the Russians affected the 2016 election results? 🤔  If you think the left aren’t insane enough to rig an election in their desperation and rage you’re void of logic. Ppl get sloppy when they’re  desperate.
1326196049539522560 2020-11-11 00:12:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh you know they did, but they somehow want to latch it onto Biden.
1326194517590994944 2020-11-11 00:06:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Job  Butter Friends

1326189706455912449 2020-11-10 23:47:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump already protected pre existing conditions with an executive order you lying hag.  https://t.co/XeHrbyXNfl

They emphasized her black heritage when IT MATTERED while failing to tell you about her record on putting black men in jail for weed. They sure did tell you she loved 2PAC tho. 😂  https://t.co/qNLTnl8OgZ
1326187110538256385 2020-11-10 23:37:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CLTgirl82 @w_terrence Kamala’s hair never had that curl. Why would anyone want to be white at a time like this when everyone prefers to be a victim? That’s why you have an Indian woman acknowledging her “black” side now. Her family owned slaves. 😂  https://t.co/ERXxPIdxJS
1326031931989876736 2020-11-10 13:20:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HappyManor Sure as hell seems like it.
1326031727156883457 2020-11-10 13:19:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The media doesn’t certify who’s president. They make a projection call. That’s it. Even @SandraSmithFox knows that.
1326030942842970113 2020-11-10 13:16:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JimJordanJacket @Jim_Jordan Is that why the judge gave an order to allow them to be there and they failed to comply with?
1326030405300989952 2020-11-10 13:14:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m glad we aren’t a democracy. I mean c’mon Eric you should know this, we are a Constitutional Republic.
1326028869099347968 2020-11-10 13:08:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden make things better? 😂🤣😂

1326026632608411648 2020-11-10 12:59:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeeMuffy They aren’t logical. They are just emotional.
1326026387614920705 2020-11-10 12:58:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So if a signature was forged they wouldn’t reject the ballot?
1326025350380335105 2020-11-10 12:54:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What Shapiro fails to tell you is that they changed election laws last minute and not via the legislature. Which makes those “laws” invalid. Shapiro knew, he was just hoping they’d get away with it. #GameOn  https://t.co/MmT7NyiSRe
1326024647926706177 2020-11-10 12:51:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @allthepudding Omg. These ppl are just... mental.
1326024325074280450 2020-11-10 12:50:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And here they kept telling us how they wanted unity while they call us MAGAts and put us on lists. 😂 These ppl will remain miserable sad fks.
1326023316537188354 2020-11-10 12:46:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Dems: Biden won fair and square.   *lets do a recount and investigate fraud and allow both sides access to ballot processing*   Dems: Omg Trump is trying to steal the election!!
1326022555887497217 2020-11-10 12:43:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Only if you stop lying “CNN contributor”. Thanks.

1326016360653025281 2020-11-10 12:18:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @americans4hope @loveCOsun @seanspicer @RealClearNews You cared enough to respond tho. It’s ok. Just remember to heed your own advise of and when the time comes.
1326014109486247936 2020-11-10 12:09:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @americans4hope @loveCOsun @seanspicer @RealClearNews Yea that’s what I thought. I’m still waiting on an official call. Hope Biden doesn’t suffer an Al Gore situation.   Elections are so unpredictable. Just ask Hillary..  https://t.co/PMi36v3RBw
1326013544232415234 2020-11-10 12:07:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @americans4hope @loveCOsun @seanspicer @RealClearNews It would be really unfortunate if just like Al Gore was projected the winner of an election that it happens to Joe Biden and all of you as well.   Will you accept the loss if Trump is declared the winner?  https://t.co/ihM8CP87GU
1326012744353546240 2020-11-10 12:04:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @americans4hope @loveCOsun @seanspicer @RealClearNews Neocons aren’t well respected. What reality are you talking about? That unlike you I haven’t jumped the gun on a PROJECTION made by the media about this election?   I’m waiting for an official call.
1326012190499893248 2020-11-10 12:01:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @americans4hope @loveCOsun @seanspicer @RealClearNews No projecting isn’t calling the election. Projecting means they assume by the information they have been provided that that individual is the winner. I have not heard the election was actually confirmed for Biden. Even Twitter had this up.  https://t.co/5ObXcYtV1F
1326011187864039425 2020-11-10 11:57:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> WRONG.. Trump hired the first openly gay cabinet official.  https://t.co/q2oCbrXQRz

Exposure is what we use to build up immunity to them.   What do you think vaccines are? They usually include live virus that our bodies can fight it off.
1326008191516209154 2020-11-10 11:46:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s because @TeamCavuto is a partisan hack. Why won’t you LET US decided what’s real and what’s not? YOUR JOB is to report the news period, not tell us what to think.  https://t.co/0Vn2ZFU3E6

1326003639849136128 2020-11-10 11:27:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ByedonD @BeardyMan1983 @WatchinDaWheels @Reuters You think the transition was seamless? We now know that Obama and Biden had literally set up Flynn. Biden suggested you get Flynn on the Logan Act and then tried to claim Trump was a Russian asset to get rid of him on day one. GTFOH.   They are fkin criminals.
1326002410255339522 2020-11-10 11:23:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 Lol I just noticed the ear. What woulda been nice is adding her mother in there, but nope.
1326001968301580288 2020-11-10 11:21:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HappyManor Right? Self righteous asshoes.
1326001553841377280 2020-11-10 11:19:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 Like seriously these ppl can’t even let the dead Rest In Peace. Of course we can only see Kamala’s face. 😂
1326000368581439490 2020-11-10 11:14:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Cases doesn’t mean everyone who is testing positive for COVID is in the hospital.
1326000039278252034 2020-11-10 11:13:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> To clarify this doesn’t mean they are all hospitalized for COVID. Not sure why they don’t say that. It is flu season and ppl get sicker during the colder months.  https://t.co/u25VAVn6OU
1325968676621725702 2020-11-10 09:09:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The only rigging done was by you fkin criminals.
1325963988744560640 2020-11-10 08:50:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @servy8229 @PamBondi Oh so because you claim it’s not a trusted source then you have an issue with it? When it’s confirmed by other sources you claim are ok we’ll just remind you RCP had it first. 😂
1325960035495600129 2020-11-10 08:34:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @servy8229 @PamBondi Are you incapable of reading? Yes Real Clear Politics removed PA in the Biden column.  https://t.co/uN6UWXI9OR
1325905675268939777 2020-11-10 04:58:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun Damn. Sorry Bacun.
1325860583464341504 2020-11-10 01:59:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun Not sure why you are supporting the white ppl marching with BLM and harassing ppl while they try to eat.   That makes YOU sound like a leftists.
1325860201845583878 2020-11-10 01:58:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun You should know me better than that. If you can’t understand that I’m talking about the white ppl marching with BLM and NOT ALL white ppl then that’s your issue not mine.
1325845701582974976 2020-11-10 01:00:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CRose2u @Scaramucci @WarnockWarrior @JoeBiden We don’t accept those results either. Especially in the states in question.   Y’all didn’t accept an election for 4 fkin years so ppl like you should probably STFU.
1325831054083567616 2020-11-10 00:02:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M It never did. To think this guy lasted 11 days in the administration was clearly far too long.
1325830860419993608 2020-11-10 00:01:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun Here’s the thing. White guilt is what has brought whites to this place. Latinos don’t have that issue nor do black ppl. If whites stopped supporting other ppl’s causes in order to virtue signal the protests wouldn’t really be a thing. Not enough support.
1325830236961820672 2020-11-09 23:58:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SgtWings @BillGates .05 sec.
1325829808744353793 2020-11-09 23:57:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scaramucci Things like this is why Trump fired your ass. H1N1 is also a coronavirus you fkin git. So yes Obama should have had coronavirus tests created and available in case another pandemic happened as a preventative.  https://t.co/HoOyckplNV
1325828980616781825 2020-11-09 23:53:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s not how this works you fkin mental midget.
1325705561355112449 2020-11-09 15:43:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 Leftist virtue signaling asshoes.
1325704459318554625 2020-11-09 15:39:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Look at all those white people cucking.   https://t.co/R3jz8XMCYh

1325701994510577664 2020-11-09 15:29:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @iamslumpped I never said the governor said that. It’s what we’ve been told by the left for the last 4 months. Trump rallies are super spreaders but riots and protests aren’t?  https://t.co/IyCMDXVDxD
1325701646081425408 2020-11-09 15:27:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @iamslumpped They are just PEOPLE. What’s the state of emergency exactly? 9 ppl dying today in a state of 3.28M ppl?   They aren’t being held accountable if you think arresting 10 ppl out of 500 is being held accountable then you don’t know what accountable means.
1325700912829009920 2020-11-09 15:25:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Told you they’ve picked a new target.  https://t.co/tyiEYTmT2J
1325700165487915008 2020-11-09 15:22:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 He thought wrong and clearly has now been labeled a white supremacist. This should be fun.
1325698721573580800 2020-11-09 15:16:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @iamslumpped *the people
1325698588542861313 2020-11-09 15:15:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 This person thought his Biden sign protected him. 😂
1325698434725105664 2020-11-09 15:15:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @iamslumpped How are CROWDS an issue when they go to rallies but not when they go to riots and protests?   It’s hypocritical bullsh*t.
1325698125416181761 2020-11-09 15:13:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @iamslumpped No it’s not. Do you know how our government works and who it’s composed of? The popes vote for their representatives. We don’t like tyrants.   What’s dumb is claiming that the people shouldn’t be held to account for failing to obey the laws while committing crimes.
1325695024235831296 2020-11-09 15:01:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @iamslumpped I’m sorry are people the ones dying of COVID or the government?
1325694774360223744 2020-11-09 15:00:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats have done this for far to long to Republican nominees. The political lynchings by democrats got even worse with Kavanaugh.
1325692548308901888 2020-11-09 14:51:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KeepINitReal604 That would remove the fear. They can’t have that. It’s an election year after all. 😉
1325690978078846976 2020-11-09 14:45:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He thinks Biden won. *smh* 3.28M ppl in his state and these are his COVID stats. His mortality rate is &lt; .5% and now he’s mandating masks and shutting everything down? *smh*  https://t.co/lSUwmi69NW
1325687678042427392 2020-11-09 14:32:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @unashamedusa The left thinks they are safe from the radical leftist mobs because they supported Biden and Harris. They never really paid attention if they believed that for a second.   If Biden wins I’ll laugh watching them attempt to fight off the radicals while trying not to seem racist. 🤣
1325686759196303360 2020-11-09 14:28:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tampke Says the white lady yelling in from a bullhorn. 😂 I swear leftist white feminism has destroyed this country.
1325684172556414976 2020-11-09 14:18:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @unashamedusa It’s a follow up to this one.. so he’s patching her up.  https://t.co/xA4c1iTudC
1325683930968727552 2020-11-09 14:17:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They clearly voted incorrectly. 🤣  https://t.co/yLKUoilhc3
1325679704855117824 2020-11-09 14:00:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now all of a sudden “Make American Great Again” under Biden isn’t a racist dog whistle? Look at this bs. 🤣  https://t.co/bzXc9D5AvC
1325676801549430787 2020-11-09 13:49:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap Bish is scared to say whitey or maybe she just can’t spell it so she uses YT.
1325676336967397377 2020-11-09 13:47:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo Then wonder why the cities are turning to sh*t. Look at Austin, TX. *smh*
1325675944888037377 2020-11-09 13:45:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RebelSister81 These ppl aren’t very smart. We stay educating them while they want us to give them FREE COLLEGE. 🤣
1325675272612450306 2020-11-09 13:43:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @212maven The Royals are the wealthiest welfare family.
1325674782394740736 2020-11-09 13:41:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo Right?! The lack of self awareness among these ppl is insane.
1325674558171480064 2020-11-09 13:40:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who’s they? And no they didn’t call it.. It says “projected winner”.. do you know what that means?  https://t.co/eMxZA96TCy
1325673526846652416 2020-11-09 13:36:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Proof some ppl stay begging thinking something will change after 47 yrs of this man in government. 🤣 I don’t think he remembers you. They’ll just blame his dementia for failure to get it done.  https://t.co/MjWTtUNFd3
1325672591198097409 2020-11-09 13:32:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They want to “heal” the nation while still calling ppl deplorable? 🤣 Is this a fking joke?
1325667644293328896 2020-11-09 13:12:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So cheating is her playbook blueprint?
1325598554128228352 2020-11-09 08:38:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Redrawing regional geopolitics in order to start more wars and fund ISIS?
1325592916434186240 2020-11-09 08:15:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RichardGJ1 @DailyMailUK Nationalized healthcare. If it was “totally full” I can bet less than 5% were COVID related.
1325590990397136896 2020-11-09 08:08:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh looky here the same fkin thing we’ve been saying for months.   The political swamp is so gross.
1325586815055622144 2020-11-09 07:51:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because they know leftists are dumb af.

1325582680625352704 2020-11-09 07:35:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Reminder: THE MEDIA DOESN’T CALL ELECTIONS.
1325533074877083650 2020-11-09 04:18:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 Yea because the left were able to provide proof of their Russian asset allegations and how everyone that supported Trump was a racist?   That b*tch needs to take several fkin seats.
1325532633816657921 2020-11-09 04:16:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m really sorry to hear that Monique. 🙏🏼 Sending virtual hugs. ♥️
1325529277404598273 2020-11-09 04:03:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Endless wars that Biden had no problem keeping us in just 4 short years ago.

1325528317013839872 2020-11-09 03:59:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So basically what Democrats did?
1325528084053811203 2020-11-09 03:58:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 2M+ people die every year you fkin lawn flamingo. You act like 230k is a lot. Do you think ppl just stop dying of cancer, diabetes, respiratory issues ahh but they all had COVID. What about the survival numbers jackhole? Do those not matter?  https://t.co/uj5Gpp3er5

1325488381585862656 2020-11-09 01:20:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Expect things to get done for black ppl? Man after 47 yrs you still expect something from this man? You want another crime bill? Trump got black ppl out of prison for crimes that Biden signed off on in his crime bill. The fkin clownery.

Plus we don’t know how the radical left in congress will vote because they want to have more of a say. For all we know Pelosi might not even get leader. 😂 They’ll be fighting with each other more than w/R.

1325478812595879938 2020-11-09 00:42:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine being the type of person who voted for a candidate that put lids on the media. Answered on average the same 20 media questions when he actually showed his face and did 90% of his campaign from his basement and somehow thinking you have a LEADER now..  https://t.co/eGyZCufgeo

The Republicans in congress respond to us the people who voted for them. If they don’t they represent us will be replaced by someone who does and fights for us.   That’s what you ppl NEVER understood. While you voted for a basement dweller

I never saw Trumps numbers go up while Bidens remained exactly the same. Unless you are attempting to say “dumps” are sorted by party and dumped into the system that way.

1325468303242915840 2020-11-09 00:00:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sorry you seem to have misunderstood the article. The owner was concerned about not being able to afford keeping his business if Biden won. If Biden raises taxes on businesses more ppl like this man will be laid off. That’s nothing to do with being a Trump supporter. Learn 2 read
1325468132090146821 2020-11-09 00:00:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You judge ppl by their skin color so what’s the difference? Having contempt for ppl is learned. And leftists are the best at teaching hate. Kamala admitted the man she was running with was a racist. Then said we were debating. 😂
1325467496648896512 2020-11-08 23:57:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you admit you and your ilk dehumanized Republicans every chance you got? You can deal with the leftist monsters you created and warned you about for years. They will forget about us and come for you. Mark my words.

1325341706682736640 2020-11-08 15:37:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder how many COVID deaths you’ll be responsible for at this super spreader event during a pandemic where cases have been rising for weeks.

They may not like Trump as a person but he kept us out of wars and destroyed the caliphate saving American lives.

1325270817878409217 2020-11-08 10:55:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is that why he supported the crime bill that targeted African Americans while Kamala put black fathers in jail for weed? 😂🤣😂 He called black ppl “predators”.  https://t.co/jcPZtpPFQG

1324975782851084288 2020-11-07 15:23:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you realize they never gave af about you. “The Biden campaign has trumpeted its success with small donations, but in the last six months it has raised almost $200 million from donors who gave at least $100,000.” Tell me how much of that y’all got?  https://t.co/dHHSilaKK2
1324973554207662080 2020-11-07 15:14:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Winst0n1984  https://t.co/R2GB0lUGoD
1324973362020450305 2020-11-07 15:14:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe the folks can identify themselves from your image. Geezus. That’s a lot of ppl covered in raw sewage. 🤭
1324972467635380224 2020-11-07 15:10:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I hope is any fraud is found in Michigan that it also helps @JohnJamesMI defeat Gary Peters. He deserves that seat. 🇺🇸
1324971253048856577 2020-11-07 15:05:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo  https://t.co/vkFuR3GKjM
1324970752072773632 2020-11-07 15:03:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ok so all the same Jeeps and trucks have been sitting in this lot for 4 days now?  https://t.co/WFDftRZe09
1324968705214722048 2020-11-07 14:55:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo We’ll be fine just like most conservatives as we continue to fight to keep American jobs in the US and staying the hell out of wars over seas and protecting our constitution and republic.   That doesn’t change when Trump leaves office. I also plan on trolling tf out of them. 😂
1324968067714048001 2020-11-07 14:52:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Arctic__char @meiselasb Then who would pay for you?
1324967708295794693 2020-11-07 14:51:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo Because they never cared about them. They thrived off the hate someone that calls themselves conservative spewed against a man they hated. That’s it. They will be irrelevant in no time if Trump loses in 2020 or leaves office in 2025 if he’s elected to another term.
1324966676056530944 2020-11-07 14:47:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left doesn’t even like you Ben. Your hate for Trump is the only thing they liked. You will be forgotten without Trump to hate on daily and you’ll be cancelled by the ppl you thought all of a sudden cared about what you thought. 😂 🍿 I’m so here for it too.
1324962215976337415 2020-11-07 14:29:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait a minute so exit polling shows that the vote from white women, black ppl and Latinos increased and somehow Trump is still losing? The only block that decreased is white males by 4 pts? 😂  https://t.co/nKkgFenMNa
1324958198785175552 2020-11-07 14:13:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TribbleIndustr1 Republicans never did shit just always figured they lost fair and square and caved. We finally have a fighter in office and some Republicans still have NO backbone.   Fkin cowards.
1324956570602467328 2020-11-07 14:07:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Having to photoshop a MAGA hat on a leftist nutter to try to prove your point is fkin hilarious. The self own. Y’all still can’t fkin meme after all this time?
1324954644745875456 2020-11-07 13:59:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @pi_mij @JoeBiden We need them to handle our healthcare and get me free money because money literally just falls of trees and shit. 🙄
1324951095932669953 2020-11-07 13:45:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Black ppl make up 12% of the voting population and 20% of that voting block voted for Trump. Biden got less support than Hillary and she called y’all super predators. While Biden said you ain’t black if you don’t vote for him. 😂 But whatevs.
1324950052683411456 2020-11-07 13:41:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why would republicans vote for Biden in silence? Who trying to cancel them or harassing them over who are voting for?
1324949664374747136 2020-11-07 13:39:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Bria_Bsuga @tariqnasheed You’re Indian American?  https://t.co/qQPzJ3rFae
1324946179453456384 2020-11-07 13:26:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster Just be a mom and pay attention I’m sure you’ll notice the first signs of indoctrination and that’s when you go to the school and demand some change and get other parents who feel the same.
1324940884681531392 2020-11-07 13:04:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster Yep life can change on a dime. You were meant to be a mother. ♥️
1324940632331177984 2020-11-07 13:03:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good luck with that Joe. Why is this election still pending NC? Its now going on day 4.  https://t.co/WehDD1txEc
1324939807244443648 2020-11-07 13:00:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster Right?! How does you being a conservative change who you are as an individual. When it’s literally just a traditional point of view. What’s evil about traditions and culture?
1324938598408282112 2020-11-07 12:55:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster Yea it’s never easy, but I just don’t care anymore. If you’ve known me &amp; my politics somehow make me all these evil things all of a sudden then so be it. Fk you. You’ll miss me more than I ever miss you.   Imagine it’s easier to come out as LGBT than a conservative these days.
1324936861282758657 2020-11-07 12:48:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw @GOP While having a three way with a Chinese and Russian woman in the oval.   I give it a month.

1324935681232179200 2020-11-07 12:44:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gameoverman7 @JoeBiden I’m dead 💀 That poor woman.
1324935473119199232 2020-11-07 12:43:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 @JoeBiden Right? Her inner monologue is like, “This crazy lady is gonna blow.. speak calmly. Don’t make any sudden movements.”
1324935026035683330 2020-11-07 12:41:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap @JoeBiden Because it’s so crazy? It’s not a joke.. and then these ppl wonder why we mock them.
1324934809970376707 2020-11-07 12:40:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GentThePenguin @JoeBiden Some crazed off the charts virtue signaling leftist? That poor black woman seemed scared to death.   That lady was putting her down for working at a coffee shop. Then saying black coffee reminded her of black ppl who struggle. Like wtf?!  https://t.co/abWVIwMCia
1324934168569024512 2020-11-07 12:38:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea at this point I’m like, “oh so I’m a racist now? Fk you. Your loss not mine.”  https://t.co/23yH9LcOFD
1324933803450658816 2020-11-07 12:36:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OvertonGaslight They deserve all the mockery.
1324933558134173697 2020-11-07 12:35:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These are the ppl that elected @JoeBiden.   https://t.co/hMn4GcPNI3
1324932524456341504 2020-11-07 12:31:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The self owns. 🤣 Still haven’t seen a single video of a con crying. So they have to recycle their own ppl crying. Fkin hilarious.
1324932076240400385 2020-11-07 12:29:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now @mbsimon wants to go full fascist and take names? Y’all were always the fascists.  https://t.co/QQ1mLC54MA
1324930145531043840 2020-11-07 12:22:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Sweetemmilyn I’m not sure what she’s thinking. That man will become a meme. 😂
1324929534039224321 2020-11-07 12:19:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas @CassandraRules They repeat non sense. She assumes because Cassandra is white her family colonized the US. Her family might have come here until long after all that happened.   These ppl stay dumb af. College is worthless.
1324928135549210624 2020-11-07 12:14:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas @CassandraRules Fkin snow possum’d out. 😂
1324927959430410240 2020-11-07 12:13:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SgtWings I thought he could be Ted Lieu’s brother. 😂  https://t.co/MrbZNh8c52
1324927471871881217 2020-11-07 12:11:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian I can’t stop laughing. Estoy muerta.
1324927326585462784 2020-11-07 12:11:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What did @CassandraRules colonize? Let’s see if you even know what the word means.
1324926442057035776 2020-11-07 12:07:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait... wutttt? Fk I need a laugh. 🤣
1324925354541080576 2020-11-07 12:03:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Did you listen to the video? Doesn’t sound like she’s off the Trump train when she’s talking about Trump leaving a legacy even if he doesn’t win.
1324923004099256321 2020-11-07 11:53:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You *ARE* the racists with your critical race theory bs. We *ARE* the resisters.
1324921726484901891 2020-11-07 11:48:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw Always.. and we need the support of all @GOP in congress. I’m fkin sick of their cowardice to stand up. Get some balls ffs.
1324919524936704006 2020-11-07 11:40:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker They didn’t. It was opposed by “some” at the state level according to the article and the WH.
1324917565517303808 2020-11-07 11:32:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is very interesting.. any of you hear about it? Could all this have been a set up from the start? Trump is always 3 steps ahead because we don’t know what he knows.  https://t.co/Xnty0qumNn
1324916747191767040 2020-11-07 11:29:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeyNada76 @PolitiBunny @kylenabecker Oh I have.
1324912603798282241 2020-11-07 11:12:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Honestly how is THIS losing? Makes no sense.  https://t.co/uPZw3Ihtne
1324911433029574656 2020-11-07 11:07:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You aren’t conservative Joe.  https://t.co/aN0RYqg6KZ

1324907660668334080 2020-11-07 10:52:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine that..
1324905833168203777 2020-11-07 10:45:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @syl_capulet1 They have serious issues. Have you seen the obsession?
1324904748290433025 2020-11-07 10:41:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead It’s so interesting to me that while the left claimed Republicans would put ppl back in chains here are the actual fascists making lists of their enemies.
1324904306626064384 2020-11-07 10:39:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You have to let ppl commit a crime before you can charge them for one.
1324901127557582849 2020-11-07 10:26:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Seems accurate. The males also said they wear cages on their dicks during said “happy time”.
1324900464903680000 2020-11-07 10:24:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Of course you have nothing better to do you’re a fkin SOCIALIST. Need I say more?
1324899803826847744 2020-11-07 10:21:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tell me Benji what did these “Trump voters” say about the claims by leftists that Trump was a white supremacist, racist and Russian asset for 4 fkin years do?
1324897858533937152 2020-11-07 10:13:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And y’all had a president impeached with less than no evidence, so please stfu Kyle.
1324865820170743808 2020-11-07 08:06:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gotsumpnferya Nor should you but these types of crazies voted for Biden.
1324865667200286720 2020-11-07 08:06:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeBraxtonTouch @CassandraRules I need to know how you are a #mentalhealth advocate when you call ppl trash? You’re disgusting.  https://t.co/SoqiqCwnrj
1324865230413811712 2020-11-07 08:04:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess women aren’t allowed to have a different opinion in Joe’s bigoted world.
1324864920651882496 2020-11-07 08:03:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gotsumpnferya She’s a singer and actress.  https://t.co/gxKFm3ZaO2
1324864605533827072 2020-11-07 08:01:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do you know how insane you sound?   You: Voter suppression exists!   Also you: Biden has 4M more votes!!  https://t.co/kanu0vQDh5
1324862591953375232 2020-11-07 07:53:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RaeOfHope808 Haha I feel the same way.  https://t.co/zbBCELU8Gg
1324862387669725186 2020-11-07 07:53:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DesertNightNoir I think verification docs like they required for my CA real ID can also include a symbol stating you ARE a citizen and can vote.
1324861081727037440 2020-11-07 07:47:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> say hi to our little ray of sunshine @RaeOfHope808!
1324860691631632385 2020-11-07 07:46:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alsup_paige I’m sure she’s literally shaking.
1324860507350687745 2020-11-07 07:45:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker I don’t think they’d whine at all if they knew everything was done right &amp; legally.   The only ones whining will be the leftists losers who are no one w/o their Trump hate. Not to mention the NBA, NFL &amp; MBL for going political. I was a hardcore sports fan I stopped watching.
1324859864967864321 2020-11-07 07:43:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh you know it’s coming.. fkin Neolibs are as bad as Neocons in their thirst for blood.
1324859203438088192 2020-11-07 07:40:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m ok with doing it in every state at this point. I just want it to be fair, legal and transparent.
1324858948256632832 2020-11-07 07:39:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker I’d be ok with that. I just want all legal votes to count. They claimed the pandemic allowed them to change election laws without legislation. This is wrong and what they did in PA.   We’d all feel more comfortable with a Trump loss if we saw it was all legal.
1324856916187602945 2020-11-07 07:31:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaintRPh What if you found out that someone who’s a Dem in the house, has a husband with a stake in that particular software?
1324856212102377472 2020-11-07 07:28:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Exactly why they needed COVID to make sure they could push mail in across the country. Why would they need mail in? Because most ppl who never requested ballots got them. How do we even know they are registered when you still have dead ppl on the rolls who could have got ballots?
1324855604486135810 2020-11-07 07:26:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Look at these races they still refuse to call for republicans.  https://t.co/JvlnuOLuoI
1324854875470012416 2020-11-07 07:23:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker So they get 9 extra days to come up with ballots?
1324854209309634560 2020-11-07 07:20:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Do you assume Trump supporters aren’t young? You don’t have to be GOP to support Republicans on the ballot. If anything Trump isn’t even a Republican he’s a moderate and a populist.
1324853674695303168 2020-11-07 07:18:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Here’s the thing if they are waiting on absentee and provisional I’d imagine they know the number of those ballots already correct what if they never come in? We keep waiting?
1324853355366158336 2020-11-07 07:17:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Advil @JamesOKeefeIII @DonaldJTrumpJr @USPS Please explain how it’s propaganda for whistleblowers to come forward?   I’d love to hear it since whistleblowers that came forward against trump were always heroes for some reason to anti Trumpers.
1324852388885245954 2020-11-07 07:13:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker You don’t find that suspicious? Why are they waiting? Hoping they’ll find some more ballots for Cunningham?
1324852096043118592 2020-11-07 07:12:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Because ppl get sloppy when they are desperate to win. Be honest you know how bad a candidate Biden was most didn’t even vote for him 65% of ppl who voted for Biden voted just to get rid of Trump.   How do you know they didn’t try in FL and still lost?
1324851628738895872 2020-11-07 07:10:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker So 600 ballots come in and they are at 98% but Tillis is up about 100k and they still won’t call it?  https://t.co/xJAPqFm4UE
1324850651705167872 2020-11-07 07:06:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker According to who? The media? 😂 They called AZ for Biden then had to retract. It’s been a fkin sh*t show in these states they still haven’t even managed to count every ballot yet it’s been 4 days. They still refuse to call this race.. it was stuck on 93% since Election Day.  https://t.co/UcLcPBNceB
1324849392902270976 2020-11-07 07:01:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker That’s the point score board is wrong. Now they are finding votes that were Trumps and counted for Biden? 😂 Programming error.. kinda like that “programming error” they made in Office Space that made it obvious they were stealing money.
1324848682303447041 2020-11-07 06:58:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Dear Diary,   Once again I’m alone, eating my own hair about to pop this $8 Costco bottle of champagne I chilled if Biden actually wins.

1324840658285203456 2020-11-07 06:26:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh girlie you have no idea... hope you’re prepared for the next 4, even if Biden wins you think we will ever forget what you mfkers did and what you accused us of? Hell is coming.
1324838813781295104 2020-11-07 06:19:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So they open an investigation into this but NOT on Biden’s connections to China and his family getting money? Are you going shitting me right now? Who’s paying for this bs?
1324815704919478272 2020-11-07 04:47:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nothing to see here folks just democrats doing democrat sh*t.
1324815312559071233 2020-11-07 04:45:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 Well not sure but remember we’ve been believing the AP and their numbers.
1324814913991106560 2020-11-07 04:44:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wipe my ass with WAPO opinion pieces.

We finally get a fighter in office and these cowards want to roll over,  move on and show their bellies? It disgusts me. All this progress and they fkin cave? I’m not having it.
1324811971812679680 2020-11-07 04:32:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SenatorianJ Lol yea right.
1324811847686483968 2020-11-07 04:32:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DanCrenshawTX @PaulGonzalez10 Yes we did. Why do republicans always do this? Just accept what happened like nothing? It’s exactly why you don’t win because you don’t fight for us as your voters.   That’s what we admired about Trump he’s a fighter if you don’t fight back Dan we will remember. Stand together.
1324809848978989061 2020-11-07 04:24:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Oh and his hair doll he has under his pillow of @JRubinBlogger.
1324809667839619072 2020-11-07 04:23:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If these fkers thought we trolled their asses before they really don’t have a clue.   I’ll make sure that this lives on.  https://t.co/8ag2HMQYo3

1324804099494211585 2020-11-07 04:01:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Shocker.. and these ppl wonder why we don’t trust the system.
1324803763962441728 2020-11-07 04:00:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wow.
1324803605988216834 2020-11-07 03:59:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Searching4zen1 @stillgray About as conspiracy driven as your Russian collusion bs..So please stfu blue waver.
1324801426652983296 2020-11-07 03:50:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump needs to have a rally and organize the people. That’s one thing leftists can do at a drop of a dime unlike the right.   When they finally see a large organized gathering of Trump supporters they will actually finally understand what they are dealing with. Do it here..  https://t.co/lkuIBt15UP
1324799854875324416 2020-11-07 03:44:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can we make sure not have anyone serve in office that supports a man that would say black ppl aren’t black if they don’t vote for him?   Take your wooden fkin teeth and stfu.
1324799184680099840 2020-11-07 03:41:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola @GOPChairwoman How long are they gonna wait?! 20 days?!
1324798729136803844 2020-11-07 03:40:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You can talk about whatever. It’s probably safer if you talk about sonic.
1324798137316208641 2020-11-07 03:37:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s the weirdest thing all of a sudden COVID has disappeared from the leftist news cycle.   Are ppl not dying from COVID anymore? Are cases not rising? I hope you emotional shitstains who moved to vote against Trump over COVID learn that dems do this every election.  https://t.co/blloBAEDnh
1324796777615286272 2020-11-07 03:32:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is this election still at 93%?! It’s been like this for 3 fkin days @GOPChairwoman!  https://t.co/w0HoBBdd7s
1324795382229016577 2020-11-07 03:26:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s hope you get what you deserve Arizona. You just replaced a woman with a white male. The same party that claims republicans have no diversity and are white supremacists  https://t.co/aDvJeozgpJ
1324793853585620994 2020-11-07 03:20:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s say I’ll accept it as much as THEY did the Trump Presidency.
1324790702761406464 2020-11-07 03:08:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Remember when ppl called Obama the Divider and Chief? Why do these same nutters think Biden would ever unite us? He and all his supporters despise us.. they’ve said it repeatedly.   I know a reckoning is coming..
1324788984094969856 2020-11-07 03:01:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hope he saved some money because NBA will never have the same viewership it once did after going political and Biden about to raise your taxes. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 @AlizeJohnson makes over $400k a year right?
1324788424574857216 2020-11-07 02:59:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And FK YOU for voting for CHINA, IRAN and RUSSIA over America you fkin traitors.

We don’t need to risk more Americans lives for wars they’ve been waging for 1000s of years there.   Nor should we send them money. If we stayed in the Middle East it was to cut off their flow of funds!

We don’t want more wars. That’s why he was getting Middle East countries to unite.   Russia as always been bad you fkin lawn flamingo. Being a leader means you don’t let other countries fk us you complete and utter tit.
1324772922309844993 2020-11-07 01:57:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Timcast Look how happy Iran, China and Russia are now..  https://t.co/WtGofVd4tu
1324772120421826560 2020-11-07 01:54:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Bet you didn’t know you voted for China, Iran and Russia so the people who voted against America were ppl like YOU. FYI you don’t even realize the cultists were YOU all along.   FYI we don’t cry over elections like you fools, but a reckoning is always around the corner.  https://t.co/GIpRtUODmc

1324770154866040832 2020-11-07 01:46:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess Russians, Iranians and Chinese who hate us really wanted Biden to win at any cost.   I wonder if we’ll be funding Iran’s nuclear weapons now like Obama was trying to during his term? They are pretty excited about Biden being elected. 🤔 China was banking on it.  https://t.co/zqqMicOQlP

1324763773022867456 2020-11-07 01:21:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When the patriots finally decide to come out that tells you how bad it is.
1324762139169419266 2020-11-07 01:14:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh and not to mention watching the left each other more and more now that they don’t have to resist Trump.
1324761681235304448 2020-11-07 01:12:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is it not going to be tolerated you cuck? You didn’t do shit when Antifa tried to burn down the building you actually live in. Tf did you do?
1324760986734092288 2020-11-07 01:10:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump is president until 1/20/20 @JoeBiden which means he’s still commander and chief of the military and the executive branch.
1324760493463011328 2020-11-07 01:08:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Doesn’t add up.
1324759843001884673 2020-11-07 01:05:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good.. now is the perfect time.
1324757169049280513 2020-11-07 00:54:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheBasedLiberal Me either but post it so I can follow if I haven’t.
1324757084911493121 2020-11-07 00:54:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not sure how @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris are going to UNITE a country when they called 70M Americans who would dare vote for Trump racists, white supremacists, dehumanized them down to bots, claimed poc werent poc and then still said we supported Russia during their campaign.  https://t.co/JVJHSQOqyc
1324755383320076288 2020-11-07 00:47:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Drop your PARLER handles so I can follow. About to build up that bitch. 😂

1324741458591510528 2020-11-06 23:52:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jazonuxlay If they don’t know that already then they are dumber than we all thought. What have democrats done for these cities in the decades they’ve been in control? Not a damn thing but more poverty.  https://t.co/UDpdh6nR0L
1324738023771131905 2020-11-06 23:38:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why haven’t these races been called? Are they trying to find a few more ballots somewhere?  https://t.co/Cm684Q49QZ
1324736602166288384 2020-11-06 23:33:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jazonuxlay Right? They live for the resisting. What are they going to “resist” now?
1324736039051649025 2020-11-06 23:30:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jazonuxlay If they do the leftists won’t know what to do with themselves. They’ll eventually move over to Parler as well.
1324735603448057856 2020-11-06 23:29:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For those that thought peace in the Middle East didn’t matter because you needed to get rid of Trump by any means necessary. Congrats!  https://t.co/nDQuHUyCwF
1324734885085376514 2020-11-06 23:26:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Also anyone that follows me here just know I have a Parler as well.   Same handle. ☺️
1324734481836597250 2020-11-06 23:24:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 How long do you think it would take a place like Atlanta to “create” 2000+ votes for Biden and 200 for Trump?   Just one evening so they can be counted at 3am in case they are short?   I almost feel like they are checking to see how many Trump is up so they are extending days.
1324731386977112065 2020-11-06 23:12:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gmcgary I’d say 11. 😂
1324731342018342914 2020-11-06 23:12:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Shaolin_Dynasty @Hung_Hippo @Mcbride2Joel @hodgetwins Sir that is a liberal in your gif not sure what you are trying to convey there.   Let me know when you find a gif of actual cons crying over an election &amp; not protesting actually crying. Because you know there’s a difference right schlongface?
1324618592994799616 2020-11-06 15:44:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @rashadrobinson Hey Rashad can you tell me why all these Dem run areas with high black populations have the highest poverty rates in the country?   WHAT HAVE DEMOCRATS DONE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY? If you look at Philly the poverty rate decreased 2% since 2016 because of Trump.  https://t.co/PFaBJu5nBW
1324610805694783488 2020-11-06 15:13:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine thinking you have power when democrats basically BANK elections on your vote without having to change a damn thing for you. 😂  Dems: We fight for ppl of color!   Also Dems: You ain’t black if you don’t vote for us!
1324610204688818176 2020-11-06 15:10:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The power to vote for the same party that NEVER does anything for you? That’s NOT power my dude that’s pure sheepishness while you’re lead to the slaughter time and time again.
1324609561119002625 2020-11-06 15:08:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Damn poor mink..
1324607675536089088 2020-11-06 15:00:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Translation: Cheating is ok as long as it gives US the end result WE want.
1324606410512977920 2020-11-06 14:55:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They threw those away.
1324604932712902657 2020-11-06 14:50:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh correction he said 10k+ came in for Biden. So only about 25% of a batch of 13k+ came in for Trump? While Republicans are leading down ballot for house seats? The math just doesn’t add up.  https://t.co/EpGzkKujyE
1324602741239414784 2020-11-06 14:41:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Only for Dems it seems.. I don’t believe that’s mathematically possible anywhere in the country unless you live in DC. Even in an area that votes 92% for Dems you’d still have at least 1040 votes out of 13k for Trump.
1324602011665362944 2020-11-06 14:38:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So all those 13k+ ballots were only for Biden @SteveKornacki?
1324600815936417798 2020-11-06 14:33:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Philly election appointees claimed it was for COVID to keep ppl so far away. Then you see how close everyone else was while counting the ballots on those tables.  https://t.co/4kHSP1MtTK

1324593398666260481 2020-11-06 14:04:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl @LanaDelRey Me too. Although my face fits in a lot of them.

1324590361889533953 2020-11-06 13:52:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoveNmusic22 I don’t want to argue just provide info. Sleep well.
1324590198680813569 2020-11-06 13:51:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl @LanaDelRey Gorgeous.  https://t.co/PHshcvSsd5
1324588941853380608 2020-11-06 13:46:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Since you deleted your tweet.. I’d still like to answer @LoveNmusic22. It was a Gallup poll on Trump approval by party affiliation which is toward the bottom.   Link:  https://t.co/ig3qOxKyTG
1324585115486355456 2020-11-06 13:31:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Eforger_20 This example isn’t even remotely close to what I was talking about.   When ppl make claims like something not tethered to the truth, what will they do when they find out it was the truth along they just couldn’t imagine it being true?
1324582694391476225 2020-11-06 13:21:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now will you apologize if YOU find out Trump was absolutely right while you claimed his concerns “didn’t appear tethered to the truth”?
1324581674781270017 2020-11-06 13:17:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Big mistake if they did... @GOPLeader @senatemajldr
1324581431587213312 2020-11-06 13:16:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is absolutely 100% true.. So Russians can rig an election, but not leftist nutters hungry for power?
1324580069990264833 2020-11-06 13:11:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is literally mathematically impossible in a democratic election.
1324579330031149056 2020-11-06 13:08:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump has taken a bullet for this country and it’s people. Al Gore never had to go thru what Trump has the last 4 yrs. Proof? Here you are praising Al Gore for what?
1324578468219158530 2020-11-06 13:04:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They are now preparing for future elections where they will lie about not wanting to defund police and socialism like the good little leftists tricksters they are.
1324577655954366464 2020-11-06 13:01:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This..
1324576416885731328 2020-11-06 12:56:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nope that’s because Philly has proven to be corrupt as hell. FYI AZ and PA have around the same amount of whites you fkin racist pos.  https://t.co/WNszqNU7Nk
1324573165196963841 2020-11-06 12:43:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why is it always these white leftist feminist alphabet ppl that say this racist sh*t?  https://t.co/GZh3yqO6Tr
1324572055723864065 2020-11-06 12:39:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealLonestarTX Any ballots that require “healing” should require two watchers, a member of each party while it’s replaced or filled in better.   Who’s watching this person do this?
1324571606903971840 2020-11-06 12:37:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s interesting how ppl like Tapper are concerned about “falsehoods” when that’s all they’ve ever spewed for 4 fkin years about the President and his supporters.  https://t.co/GrpBkrdTkK
1324570460843991040 2020-11-06 12:33:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @3Campbell3 Why wouldn’t it be dark enough? The ballots that aren’t dark enough shouldn’t just be darkened without supervision by someone from both parties.   The ballots that require darkening should be put aside and watched while they are being filled in by someone.
1324569423051542529 2020-11-06 12:28:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealLonestarTX The ballot was blank. The person is filling in the bubbles with pen.   Give me a reason this would happen or be normal?   Are you saying they didn’t mark the ballot completely so they are filling it in without any supervision?
1324565785461714944 2020-11-06 12:14:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r Imagine if ppl went in with Trump masks to count votes?
1324565466510077954 2020-11-06 12:13:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealLonestarTX Tell me if this was happening at ballot counting stations how many ballots do you think could be added by one person? This woman is filling in a blank ballot. She did two in a row in less than a minute.  https://t.co/36zP2nnWcK
1324563847412281344 2020-11-06 12:06:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealLonestarTX Sorry but why aren’t you upset at the possibility that the left has destroyed our election process and possibly had massive voter fraud for Biden?
1324563144870486016 2020-11-06 12:03:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird how they keep finding these NEW BATCHES 2 days later. How stupid do these ppl think we are?
1324562688479952897 2020-11-06 12:02:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 This has been at 93% for 2 days now. Tf is taking so long NORTH CAROLINA?  https://t.co/KfIXILjyJ9

1324559699539226624 2020-11-06 11:50:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is a free county you pos. You can also eat a bag full of fried assholes.
1324558938042294272 2020-11-06 11:47:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @melcalzone @stillgray @GreenwoodOutlaw If you think there is only one or two examples you’re high af. Why is it happening in particular states? How would anyone who’s dead apply for a ballot and submit it you fkin lawn flamingo?
1324555979267010561 2020-11-06 11:35:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Right? Where to these ppl come off?
1324553543399829504 2020-11-06 11:25:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nothing to see here just the person in charge of elections being a Trump hater.
1324553097469849600 2020-11-06 11:24:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For what dickface? What law has he broken? Fk you!

1324431825519824896 2020-11-06 03:22:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Thought they wanted a transparent election? This is criminal.
1324431473038880768 2020-11-06 03:20:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl are crooked af. Not even a court order gets them in.
1324409861254176769 2020-11-06 01:54:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe Shapiro shouldn’t have come out saying Biden was gonna win once all votes where counted in his state.
1324402974030929920 2020-11-06 01:27:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PatrickR1971 @CawthornforNC Lmaoo. Yes because no one ever flew a Biden flag in support of Biden. Your hate and bigotry has divided this country. You called Trump supporters racists and white supremacists for 4 yrs. calling black and Hispanic cons racial slurs. You reap what you sow we will not forget.

1324385211484831744 2020-11-06 00:16:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That was his plan all along. Not sure why anyone would think otherwise he’s been bought and paid for already.
1324384772626374656 2020-11-06 00:15:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whole_9_meters Para que no digas.
1324384377384529920 2020-11-06 00:13:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What do all these places have in common?   DC voted 93% for Biden  LA voted 71% for Biden  NY voted 72% for Biden
1324382145041686530 2020-11-06 00:04:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Anyone else notice the cities listed?   What do they have in common?   “peaceful protests escalated”  “riot declared in Portland”  https://t.co/0prMFnYDud
1324381365261885440 2020-11-06 00:01:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Cyborg1966 @CNN @MSNBC They never cared.
1324381310626848768 2020-11-06 00:01:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For @whole_9_meters something I remembered from French class. 😂  https://t.co/s9DmD3fLG5
1324379194944446464 2020-11-05 23:53:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Funny how that changes when it’s no longer a political talking point.. right @CNN @MSNBC?
1324378291520774145 2020-11-05 23:49:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This must really hurt...
1324377924032581633 2020-11-05 23:47:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now you’ll know what that’s like.. wait until GOP wins the house back in 2022 and keeps the senate then you’ll really get it. We will never forget what you did to Kavanaugh.
1324377067668975617 2020-11-05 23:44:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We know they are trying to find more ballots for Biden, Dems and progressives.  https://t.co/XTIirKif2E
1324376436329701377 2020-11-05 23:42:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DesertNightNoir Yep and I can’t wait. If you can go thru a drive thru to drop of your ballot you can show ID. Period. Only legal citizens should be able to vote in our country none of this harvested ballots bullsh*t like in CA.
1324375639571357702 2020-11-05 23:38:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrIanNewcomb @celinedryan What’s “extreme” about them?   Is it extreme to make sure all ballots are counted during an election?
1324374971926286339 2020-11-05 23:36:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Oh if he runs again I’d definitely vote for him no ifs ands or buts. Just to make leftists deal with him for another 4 years.
1324374625501863937 2020-11-05 23:34:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Keep this in mind ppl.. if Trump is able to prove that there was election fraud because Dems were sloppy af in their desperation to get rid of him. It would be one step closer to requiring VOTER ID federally for elections and guess who would be ÜBER FKED?
1324373393504829440 2020-11-05 23:29:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Oh he’s more that capable. Trump is actually a very healthy 74. He’ll never be out of politics completely. He loves this country and it’s ppl.   Down, but never out. He’s a fighter.
1324372869749514241 2020-11-05 23:27:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You reap what you sow buttplug.

1324367051218014209 2020-11-05 23:04:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But you forget.. Trump could run in 2024 if he loses in 2020. Presidents are allowed 2 terms and by that time he’ll just be as old as Joe is. 😂 Sorry but we don’t CRY over elections like you pussies do. We will come out in force in 2022 make sure to flip more house seats.  https://t.co/IO6aagpSG3
1324366202836152321 2020-11-05 23:01:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you can’t even mention this stuff and we are supposed to trust this process and these tech ppl pulling the kill switch on accts that do? 🤦🏻‍♀️

1324221650380836864 2020-11-05 13:26:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TribbleIndustr1 Biden won’t do anything to stop it. He’ll back getting rid of our police force. Maybe the black community will finally wake up when they realize they are killing themselves while the democrats continue to sit and watch it happen in their cities.
1324219688830738433 2020-11-05 13:19:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Calling everything racist means nothing is racist.
1324202432637804544 2020-11-05 12:10:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JBAmericanPNW Who knows but I’m guessing they must when you look at the cities they run in.
1324201354542247936 2020-11-05 12:06:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tom23515122 I find it odd that the presidential election has 49k more votes than the senate election. 🤔
1324201021950758912 2020-11-05 12:05:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tom23515122 Do they lean more dem or rep?
1324197961232908288 2020-11-05 11:52:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Pay close attention these are the ppl that vote for those on the left.

1324190909068570624 2020-11-05 11:24:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like white supremacy and racism is alive and well in Michigan. They just denied a black man a senate seat.  https://t.co/PnvUWxpBcO
1324143452372656130 2020-11-05 08:16:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How are you asking for this on Nov 4 and we aren’t supposed to think there’s  some shady shit going on?
1324143162609168384 2020-11-05 08:15:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You can’t mobilize voters in GA the election is over.
1324105552981491712 2020-11-05 05:45:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker If you know you voted mail Or if you went in to drop off and your ballot hasn’t been counted that’s a problem.

1323867447431110657 2020-11-04 13:59:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Californians are truly stupid or don’t own homes in CA. This Prop does away with Prop 13 which will increase property taxes on homes.   This prop is saying that if you purchased your home for $150k and it’s now worth $400k they want to chrg you taxes on the $400k instead.  https://t.co/p6VJv7SNtC

1323767559724830721 2020-11-04 07:22:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It begins... #Trump2020 🇺🇸 Lets go!!  https://t.co/V0G0FEmqpT
1323765270695997440 2020-11-04 07:13:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tina_Boz0820 Lol I could still pull it up.  https://t.co/ykZvoaUasZ
1323764978684362754 2020-11-04 07:12:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KarmicDisaster They did? I clicked on it and it came up.  https://t.co/rWeA3jamwT
1323742863998345216 2020-11-04 05:44:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is all kinds of sad. So you bribed your nephew for a vote? Isn’t that illegal?  https://t.co/o3lMVuy1iF
1323716127617290241 2020-11-04 03:58:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @WoodsEyebrows @alipardo Well considering Trump has a 95% approval rating with Republicans I’m guessing Trump. 😂  https://t.co/7Rsn9rv8OU
1323710115522867200 2020-11-04 03:34:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @effortisevil @Lego_shine @GayForSeth @roethlisburner @AOC Most ppl don’t put up with blatant racism and do say something to ppl. To suggest that ppl get hate for speaking another language is ridiculous. If it did ppl wouldn’t migrate here like they do.
1323709082109272065 2020-11-04 03:30:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GayForSeth @GeraltofPDX1 @scootacup @effortisevil @roethlisburner @AOC What xenophobia? You ppl are all over the place why are you such bigots? Are ppl not allowed a different opinion? Ffs.
1323708646350491649 2020-11-04 03:28:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @effortisevil @Lego_shine @GeraltofPDX1 @GayForSeth @roethlisburner @AOC See my grandmother doesn’t speak the best English, but she’s 80+ and understands most of it and at least tries. For this reason she’s always needed my mom to kind of tell her what’s going on.   She’s never experienced hate for it.
1323707799784759296 2020-11-04 03:25:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @effortisevil @Lego_shine @GeraltofPDX1 @GayForSeth @roethlisburner @AOC To suggest ppl are experiencing hatred for speaking another language is more than ridiculous. The First Lady speaks 5 languages and most benefit from speaking more than 1 when job opportunities arise.   We have states like CA, FL, NY &amp; Texas where different languages are common
1323706817797521408 2020-11-04 03:21:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @effortisevil @Lego_shine @GeraltofPDX1 @GayForSeth @roethlisburner @AOC How is it you are giving them any other options? It’s more racist to keep immigrants from prospering in an English speaking country. Let’s be honest you never really cared.   I tell Hispanic ppl they should learn English for their own good all the time. They understand.
1323705283244253184 2020-11-04 03:15:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lego_shine @GeraltofPDX1 @GayForSeth @effortisevil @roethlisburner @AOC I speak Spanish and English fluently as a Hispanic American. Calling ppl racist for suggesting ppl learn English in a majority English country is NOT racist.   You limit immigrants when you do things like this. If they only speak Spanish what kind of jobs you think they’ll get?
1323702461933056000 2020-11-04 03:03:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is illegal.. they have a sign telling ppl how to vote at the entry of a polling place @JackPosobiec @Timcast @dbongino @benshapiro @TuckerCarlson  https://t.co/raokb1lZ1w
1323688165006213121 2020-11-04 02:07:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> After what he said he’s not winning PA.

1323649744627855361 2020-11-03 23:34:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AmericanBishop Never!! It’s funny it’s always the white leftists trying to tell me what I should be bothered by as a Hispanic.   Believe me the electoral college isn’t one of them. 😂
1323648862117007360 2020-11-03 23:30:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AmericanBishop White leftists.

1323648014716530688 2020-11-03 23:27:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s the same “racist regressive mechanism of repressing democracy” that got Obama elected.  https://t.co/pIZ9dv2usM

1323644782032216064 2020-11-03 23:14:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What would that be Chuck? Ppl are being tested, the evidence of that is cases are going up, but mortality rate is going DOWN..
1323644490494586880 2020-11-03 23:13:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Does the sun not come up for you losers anymore? Pete makes it seem like all of us are as unhappy and miserable as he his over Trump being president.
1323643919645601798 2020-11-03 23:11:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’d wear it just in case. You don’t want them saying you can’t vote because you don’t have one on.
1323643269717270530 2020-11-03 23:08:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What if news organizations declare Trump the winner? The left will lose their sh*t and claim they have to wait two weeks to make sure every ballot has been counted.
1323520796686385152 2020-11-03 15:02:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “When lifelong Democrat Mayra Gomez told her 21-year-old son five months ago that she was voting for Donald Trump in Tuesday's presidential election, he cut her out of his life.”    More proof the LEFT are the hateful bigoted ones.   https://t.co/ugzbSGjZgP
1323519407927144448 2020-11-03 14:56:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Just like that.. 😂
1323518684590080000 2020-11-03 14:53:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RockConfused It’s 5 votes and the left thinks that represents something. 😂
1323518551156641793 2020-11-03 14:53:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> While leftists were upset with ICE CUBE, WEEZY and KANYE. 😂 Literally calling them racial slurs and stupid.
1323517804000075776 2020-11-03 14:50:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AndrewSolender One whole extra vote for Biden. 😂
1323517633979846656 2020-11-03 14:49:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha is Biden declaring victory already?

1323501068685242368 2020-11-03 13:43:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine politicizing COVID deaths like only one side has lost voters. Ppl who wore masks and isolated have contracted COVID as well.

1323495924845342720 2020-11-03 13:23:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @juanjohn1 Sounds about right. Although if he wins by more than they expect I don’t see how they make it up unless they cheat. There should be ZERO extensions. Have your ballot turned in by Election Day or it doesn’t count period.
1323494045885304834 2020-11-03 13:15:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I have to remind leftists when they make reference to this just know “every vote will be counted” that includes ALL those voting for Trump. No crying later. Trump supporters vote mail in and absentee as well.  https://t.co/3VA6PwyCfT
1323493251429527552 2020-11-03 13:12:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It begins #Election2020
1323492864462974977 2020-11-03 13:11:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jmikeei @LarrySchweikart You do know that Trump has 95% approval among Republicans right?   Plus Trump is getting more support than in 2016 among Hispanics and Black people.   Ppl who are registered Dems could still vote Trump as well.  https://t.co/oaYtmWPGBf
1323475343412359168 2020-11-03 12:01:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 Who the hell are these ppl on the school board?

1323471495650107393 2020-11-03 11:46:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Remember this when the left complains about the elections being rigged and how Trump is an illegitimate president.  https://t.co/dzAPWQ7FiI
1323468438287736833 2020-11-03 11:33:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck 😂 You better not.
1323467772412653569 2020-11-03 11:31:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck Lol I like some of her music, but no not a huge fan.
1323467183528144896 2020-11-03 11:29:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck You’d be surprised.
1323467075675852810 2020-11-03 11:28:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r I’m kinda surprised she didn’t wear her meat suit. 😂
1323466931647639556 2020-11-03 11:27:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These memories are forever. ♥️ 🇺🇸 Thank you for making this.   https://t.co/7cXaufluub
1323466132796313600 2020-11-03 11:24:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob I know so sad.. I mean she’s pretty popular. Obama isn’t even getting a lot of ppl. And here you have Trump getting these kinds of crowds during a pandemic. Like whoa.  https://t.co/FeDd6oWEsp
1323465699419779072 2020-11-03 11:23:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Violent as hell too. They will swarm your timeline and threaten you via DM if you dare say anything negative about their favorite celeb.   It’s cultish af.
1323465288419999744 2020-11-03 11:21:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 Here’s my prediction map.  https://t.co/ILrGCoBttC
1323465033771200512 2020-11-03 11:20:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The only excuse I can come up for for this lack of support is they had a limit on who was allowed to attend or PITTSBURGH doesn’t like Lady Gaga.
1323464154154348545 2020-11-03 11:16:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Yes.. some take it way to serious, but then I never know if some are just trolling with Trump god emperor!   I’m actually more creeped out by the celebrity stans like K-Hive, 🐝Hive and those weirdos. 😂
1323462972992184322 2020-11-03 11:12:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well damn.. 😂
1323462043752493056 2020-11-03 11:08:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RobinSueWho It starts tomorrow. I’m so nervous!
1323461327386365952 2020-11-03 11:05:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob We will always have the memories. He’ll probably come out an campaign for whoever runs in 2024 because he loves being out among the American people.
1323459975377678337 2020-11-03 11:00:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Accurate AF.. although I’d make NV more Pepe.  https://t.co/5bwteDdfzv

1323455399266185217 2020-11-03 10:42:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’d like to ask how do we know anti-Trump protestors aren’t infecting ppl at Trump rallies?   Anti-Trump protestors are super spreaders!!!  https://t.co/1Qs0NMb2mo
1323454963096317954 2020-11-03 10:40:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PittsburghMktg @JohnFetterman Ppl don’t gather like this for Biden.   Imagine 1 was about 16,000 Obama got in 2012 with NO PANDEMIC.   Image 2 was a Trump rally in PA during a pandemic a couple of days ago.  https://t.co/6zxdg1N00d
1323443826187329536 2020-11-03 09:56:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Would you be happy to help stop the rioters and assaulters if Trump wins tho?
1323371441950060545 2020-11-03 05:08:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @blydebreen @ItsReactor I’m a former Dem who supported Hillary I’m now supporting Trump.   Ever heard of the #walkaway campaign?

1323290564918349824 2020-11-02 23:47:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob @Ja1Ke3 Such a fkin shill. Salty af because Trump got rid of him after 11 days.
1323289668020891648 2020-11-02 23:43:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes because fighting for the American people is horrible policy, right Ann?
1323288719416156160 2020-11-02 23:39:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Has this article been blocked from twitter for violating the rules of inciting violence against Trump supporters @TwitterSupport? @NPR this is unacceptable and disgusting.  https://t.co/z4dG2dZgeR
1323287921944788994 2020-11-02 23:36:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scaramucci is such a loser and shill. I wonder how much the Dems paid him to shill for them after Trump got rid of his ass?   11 day salty ass mfker.
1323287594063458306 2020-11-02 23:35:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 Imagine working “80hrs a week” and being a diabetic and being forced to work in CA because cost of living is so high and you can’t afford to pay your bills because you’re the ONLY bread winner.
1323286764878929921 2020-11-02 23:32:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “In the meantime, Zayyid’s 28-year-old son Tarik is working a new job as a loan officer, under pressure to help provide financially for his siblings a brother and three sisters &amp; mother.”   So only the men worked? I’m sorry, but you CHOOSE to work 80hrs a week. YES on Prop 22.
1323286045375434752 2020-11-02 23:29:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Khaled Zayyid worked long days, driving as much as 80 hours a week for Uber, to provide for his family. When he died in a Riverside County hospital in July of complications from COVID-19, his wife and children were left without a breadwinner.”  So only the men worked?
1323284926079225856 2020-11-02 23:24:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is pretty important: “The 56-year-old Zayyid had taken a hiatus from work when pandemic stay-at-home orders took effect. But expenses piled up. One morning in June, Zayyid packed a cooler with a few Diet Cokes and his diabetes medication and went back to driving full time.”
1323284757640179713 2020-11-02 23:24:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I voted YES on PROP 22. How much was this man making that wasn’t taxed? You aren’t an employee unless taxes are withheld. If they aren’t you are responsible for paying them at the end of the year. His family could get social security for wife + every child up to 18.
1323283671617470464 2020-11-02 23:19:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This sounds very authoritarian of you Liz. Why would you need to send Republicans out of office when they are elected by the ppl democratically?
1323148285901643776 2020-11-02 14:21:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl COVID fatigue.. They only talk about it all the time because it’s an election year. If it wasn’t these clowns would barely talk about it.
1323147378140983296 2020-11-02 14:18:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl And somehow we should trust this man? I saw pics of him at a baseball game with his mask pulled down and not socially distanced. This was JULY 26th. Like c’mon. The fkin hypocrisy.  https://t.co/1M3HCZ5gKQ
1323146630263025665 2020-11-02 14:15:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because there’s no enthusiasm for Biden. You should be scared to death because there’s NO WAY Trump supporters don’t show up on Election Day. If they are willing to stand in the cold and heat for hours waiting for him to show up. Fauci has been wrong..  https://t.co/a5KmJGWFpm
1323145959103098880 2020-11-02 14:12:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He has.. Trump also said he’s a nice guy even tho he’s been wrong. He said this after Trump had already placed the travel ban from China on Jan 30th.  https://t.co/7m76MKloC8
1323145168145448961 2020-11-02 14:09:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They won’t need him anymore once the left is unable to politicize COVID for political points.
1323120199533559808 2020-11-02 12:30:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s practices islam.. and honor killings are completely acceptable.
1323118307734515713 2020-11-02 12:22:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonaldTrump has always loved the flag and this country. 🇺🇸
1323117859480850434 2020-11-02 12:20:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> One of the best comments on @Timcast’s show today. #Trump2020 🇺🇸  https://t.co/vBYVaYZ876
1323117021739905025 2020-11-02 12:17:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Seems fair. We shouldn’t have to wait a week for results. Democrats always ruin elections. Look at their flop during the primaries.
1323116276907044866 2020-11-02 12:14:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cathyde @thehill And you just complained about Trump HANDING an umbrella to someone. Presidents hand umbrellas to ppl and vice versa.   Do ppl often get handed umbrellas that close on their heads like Obama?
1323113453796487169 2020-11-02 12:03:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HurricaneA3 Omg are you serious?  https://t.co/Ob5JZVbo9Z
1323111452627009536 2020-11-02 11:55:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And how many hung up on you or didn’t answer?
1323106324113059840 2020-11-02 11:35:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’d love to know how they shutdown the bridge? All protestors BLM or otherwise should stay tf out of the streets. Period. If you jump in front of my car you won’t like the results.
1323100384445886464 2020-11-02 11:11:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Prep for leftist domestic terrorists.
1323097235194720256 2020-11-02 10:58:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And still alive and so is his family. Shocker.   https://t.co/13Ht4sKHvy
1323097050444046337 2020-11-02 10:58:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RaccoonRed2 Yep more than once.
1323096483302838272 2020-11-02 10:55:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cathyde @thehill For Obama too I guess.    https://t.co/WZ7nzVnDQe
1323095717783613440 2020-11-02 10:52:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good grief. How is this fkin news and y’all still avoiding the Hunter Biden shit? Like seriously?!
1323090129049669633 2020-11-02 10:30:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco A shitposter, me?  https://t.co/XMolfxemmE

1323078249711235072 2020-11-02 09:43:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The sky can look so pretty in CA ♥️  https://t.co/AWykuvLpbd
1323077776685977606 2020-11-02 09:41:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why on Gods green earth would I follow any of these ppl? 😂 It’s almost like you don’t know me at all twitter.  https://t.co/5gmbhGM1bK
1323077226347159552 2020-11-02 09:39:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yep..
1323076992887971842 2020-11-02 09:38:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Timcast Looks like cops were blocking them.   Don’t be so quick to react Tim there could always be an explanation. Unlike leftists who intentionally block traffic.
1323076693947375616 2020-11-02 09:37:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Timcast Looks like cops were blocking them.
1323076234104905729 2020-11-02 09:35:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @3Campbell3 😂 Bruja.
1323075571534868481 2020-11-02 09:32:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you say Dem/Rep are you just saying that’s their party affiliation on the ballot they submitted? What if someone didn’t change their party affiliation by Election Day and vote for Trump?
1323074878493261824 2020-11-02 09:30:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BlackFlagArmy10 The one on the left is definitely not a Kamala Harris. Here she is with a mask very different.  https://t.co/fdgUpm9lni
1323070059376308224 2020-11-02 09:10:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cfo23434 @RealJamesWoods Yes because clearly those are all Trump supporters destroying democrat run cities. We can’t help it if the party of tolerance is intolerant and hates that they lost an election. 😂   Get a life man we aren’t stupid.
1323069300190507010 2020-11-02 09:07:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Littlelion1776 @SteveGuest Yea he’s not lying.   What do you think getting rid of the Trump tax cuts means to hard working Americans?
1323068913010184197 2020-11-02 09:06:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I sure as hell don’t believe in this.. tf you talking about “WE”?
1323068359580082176 2020-11-02 09:04:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When they come back confirming the car was in the wrong then what? Will they be arrested for it?
1323067801733484546 2020-11-02 09:02:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who runs on this shit? 😂 Bruh no one cares if there’s a dog in the WH.
1323064907923795969 2020-11-02 08:50:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Stop exploiting the kids!
1323058086966251521 2020-11-02 08:23:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @shanermurph VA has truly gone to shit.. look at this mess. *smh*  https://t.co/k7mxnrD6ZY
1323057226865504256 2020-11-02 08:19:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @shanermurph He said Donald Trump supporters shot at him. Why are you saying it was anti-Trump supporters and then posting this interview?
1323055157786013697 2020-11-02 08:11:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gameoverman7 It’s weird because my body literally knows.. I fall asleep so much sooner than normal without realizing day light savings is around the corner.
1323054652611457024 2020-11-02 08:09:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like officers where blocking them from exiting according to Schaffer.
1323054437632405505 2020-11-02 08:08:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sound_nobody Looks like cops were blocking them from exiting.
1323051625833885697 2020-11-02 07:57:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is a blatant lie.. there was plenty of scandal. Giving money to Iran to fund terrorism was one of them.
1323051245439913984 2020-11-02 07:56:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @FredTheLobster @BeardyMan1983 @brhodes We are a constitutional republic. And the electoral college is *IN* the  constitution.   “In the context of US constitutional law, the definition of republic refers specifically to a form of government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body.”  https://t.co/E4H9hXMNr4
1323047544402800640 2020-11-02 07:41:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gameoverman7 The picture exists which makes me shutter.
1323046944537636865 2020-11-02 07:39:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RationalCalm I’ve also noticed that baby is naked and sitting right where the individuals private area is. 😟
1323046014010368000 2020-11-02 07:35:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We really don’t give af what CCP thinks. They harvest their citizens organs and if they don’t comply there are other punishments.
1323045163015401473 2020-11-02 07:32:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you are in CA and haven’t voted I’ll show you how I voted on all the PROPS.  • 13 - No  • 15 - No • 16 - No  • 17 - No  • 18 - No • 19 - No  • 20 - Yes • 21 - No  • 22 - Yes • 23 - No • 24 - No  • 25 - No  When PROPS have this kind of (D) support I vote NO.  https://t.co/rCNGJjID9s
1323041788416778241 2020-11-02 07:18:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If they are replacing the first 2 images with the Trump border wall in image 3 then that’s obviously more than other presidents have done.   Y’all like to claim the fences in image 1&amp;2 are a border wall, it’s not.  https://t.co/MHVR84MQEo
1323040486878109696 2020-11-02 07:13:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I am happy with that as long as it helps decrease illegal entry into the country and helps our CBP with apprehensions in the most used areas.
1323026230950522880 2020-11-02 06:16:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Perfect now they can’t say Republicans suppressed votes.   https://t.co/78CYw4RFgU
1322934148110020609 2020-11-02 00:10:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tell me how democrats aren’t for socialism? Don’t worry I’ll wait.

1322925670205280256 2020-11-01 23:37:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrightTomorrow7 @sequinpants @axios @Yamiche Also the woman in the other video clearly claimed who ran into who. Eric clearly edited that out of the previous video.   So again democrats pull their shit and always try to deflect on to others. The truck had the right of way.
1322924993873768451 2020-11-01 23:34:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrightTomorrow7 @sequinpants @axios @Yamiche Here’s a closer look tell me who’s driving into who? If the car can’t stay behind the bus because the bus moved into the furthest lane the truck doesn’t have to let them in that’s why they rammed the truck that was in the end lane.    https://t.co/IrB8121EwM
1322775902825054208 2020-11-01 13:42:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Before the night is over..  https://t.co/sm2vYtMwjG

Hopefully your son doesn’t have long lasting effects from wearing a mask and being restricted so much during this time. We will likely find out about those side effects in about 10 yrs.
1322760251217649665 2020-11-01 12:39:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Matt24Jays @Politics_Polls How many bots do you think support Biden?
1322760100352724992 2020-11-01 12:39:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Vote
1322757850817613827 2020-11-01 12:30:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No one would go anyway.
1322757701277937664 2020-11-01 12:29:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Liars.. we’ve see the video.
1322757198485676033 2020-11-01 12:27:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CHIZMAGA This is a beautiful sight indeed,but they need to stay off the streets tho. That’s not safe and it’s illegal.
1322756076723298304 2020-11-01 12:23:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kellllllley @tbonebrass @axios Because the whole video explains the person who rammed into the truck has California plates and was running along the bus and was trying to get back behind them when they rammed into the trump supporter.     https://t.co/wy9Jmndpmn
1322754766041014273 2020-11-01 12:18:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axios The video in your article was edited and doesn’t have the woman saying that the car rammed into the truck. @jonathanvswan I’d expect more from your journalists. @TuckerCarlson @dbongino @JackPosobiec @PressSec     https://t.co/wy9Jmndpmn
1322753612263563265 2020-11-01 12:13:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Eric posted the edited clip to not include the part that says who ran into who. Eric is a class A lyin pos.     https://t.co/wy9Jmndpmn
1322753270092165120 2020-11-01 12:12:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sequinpants @axios @Yamiche What’s criminal is the media lying to you about what happened.   Here’s the video in its entirety not the one that’s edited and cuts out the most important part.  https://t.co/wy9Jmndpmn
1322752691110473728 2020-11-01 12:09:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @axios Your reporter excluded the most important part of the video @jonathanvswan   Here’s the whole video. Where the person recording says who rammed into which vehicle. Enemy of the people!!     https://t.co/wy9Jmndpmn
1322751307308920832 2020-11-01 12:04:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The Biden/Harris supporter rammed into the Trump supporter you lying sacks. They weren’t harassing anyone they were just showing support for the president by driving along the bus.  https://t.co/jpxtCFMm1w
1322749783979667456 2020-11-01 11:58:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @rusallen Lol
1322749720817618944 2020-11-01 11:58:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DJJudd There was a hell of a lot of ppl there. I’m sure the buses would have to make several trips before they can collect everyone.

1322739707730522112 2020-11-01 11:18:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> One shows love for the country and all Americans. The other is a terrorist group that Obama and Biden funded and allowed to murder Kayla Mueller?
1322736979566489606 2020-11-01 11:07:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaintRPh Cthulhu lemon
1322734796506767362 2020-11-01 10:58:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Of course it does. Because forcing white ppl to take classes about diversity and white privilege isn’t discriminatory at all.
1322734445355388928 2020-11-01 10:57:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SayAnythingH You’d think. I mean they loved her so much I believe the order of her initials would matter a bit more.
1322731772220637185 2020-11-01 10:46:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tomasdiez @realDonaldTrump Si no te gusta nuestro presidente quédate en España pendejo y por favor de nunca visitar nuestro país.  https://t.co/AljmzMg7TX
1322730113352433664 2020-11-01 10:40:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like nothing but leftists criminals. These shitstains love to claim right wingers are the problem.
1322726816319037440 2020-11-01 10:27:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Still waiting on the study that shows how many died of COVID during the riots, looting and BLM protests across the country during this same time.
1322726508062937089 2020-11-01 10:25:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Stanford supplies more leftist panic. Tell me are Trump rallies mandatory? Ppl make choices everyday that could get them and others killed. You’d have ZERO proof they contracted the virus specifically from a Trump rally.  https://t.co/YjaRYzqci8
1322723625787486208 2020-11-01 10:14:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @svvniverse @alsup_paige Thanks for proving my point. 😂  Also why did you message me weirdo? I’m not interested.  https://t.co/Aleii78ocR

1322722207236194305 2020-11-01 10:08:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @svvniverse @alsup_paige It sure is, but clearly you aren’t special if they are showing it to everyone.   So continue to stan if you want.
1322721862141403143 2020-11-01 10:07:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @svvniverse @alsup_paige No matter how much you stan they still ain’t gonna fk.   Was this one of the guys in the video clip you posted?

1322720629842300928 2020-11-01 10:02:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AmandiOnAir: If the polls are wrong  &amp; Biden is up double digits it must be because there’s foul play not because the pollsters were wrong.   Also Amandi: Elections are safe and there’s zero proof of election fraud.   Can’t have it both ways buttplug   https://t.co/Rlo4ThyH6r
1322718725032734720 2020-11-01 09:54:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Oh you know it did. He’s probably right tho. I think Trump has even more enthusiasm on his side this year then I’ve ever seen before.
1322718378562256896 2020-11-01 09:53:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CBSNews Well the CARES ACT did allow hospitals to get paid more for COVID patients that’s just a fact.  https://t.co/CQAw53npLe
1322717680449724417 2020-11-01 09:50:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob I heard Michael Moore said to add 10 pts to every poll Trump is losing and that will likely be more accurate. 😂

1322715941721894913 2020-11-01 09:43:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh this is sad, heard they only had a few cars there. I mean if Obama is drawing flies what are these two drawing?
1322715225125122048 2020-11-01 09:40:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t trust polls, but this could be good news.

1322700004570537986 2020-11-01 08:40:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Your laugh and dance moves are spookier to me than another 4 yrs of Trump.
1322698234301571072 2020-11-01 08:33:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So relatable...
1322693983294824448 2020-11-01 08:16:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ReaICosy 😩 don’t torture me.
1322691516981112833 2020-11-01 08:06:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We know that’s why we are voting Trump. Nothing unifying about someone that calls us racists and ugly.
1322691278555947008 2020-11-01 08:05:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ReaICosy I watch stuff like this and then hate that I love bacon. 😩
1322678334027821057 2020-11-01 07:14:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well that’s because the left and leftist msm always takes Trump out of context.   https://t.co/tHsdwbrcE6
1322670917080608769 2020-11-01 06:44:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola His charges should be dropped. It was self defense.
1322670277361197057 2020-11-01 06:42:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So because Illinois didn’t want to charge him they passed him over to Wisconsin? Asshoes.
1322669310351798272 2020-11-01 06:38:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Does each country have its own election laws? I thought they were STATE election laws?   I’m ok with it as long as no election law was violated.
1322662860015587328 2020-11-01 06:12:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Well it all depends on who set up the drive thru polling place. Because clearly it was organized by someone for ppl to show up in those kinds of numbers.
1322662114406723584 2020-11-01 06:09:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob These mfkers never fight fair. Taking that man’s flag is larceny. Arrest these mfkers.
1322661881870381056 2020-11-01 06:09:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Then if it’s ok so be it, but if the station told ppl who to vote for or suggested a vote that’s illegal from a polling place. That’s why I only agree with ppl submitting completed ballots this way or requesting a ballot but not filling it out there.
1322661008146534400 2020-11-01 06:05:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sport_alytics Lmaoo sad.
1322660929780117504 2020-11-01 06:05:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker They should only be thrown out if they violated the law in someway.   We can’t know who each person voted for and I don’t care. If it’s against the law the ppl should be notified so they can resubmit if necessary.
1322660530075521024 2020-11-01 06:03:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BoneJeni @mrclean2012 @ericcervini Facts:  • escorting a bus through TX is not illegal • carrying a gun in TX is also not illegal  • no ones vote has been denied on the TX freeway   Its appalling that you think so.   FYI the vehicle tried to run the Trump supporter in the truck off the road.  👆🏼THATS ILLEGAL
1322657953481068545 2020-11-01 05:53:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These fkin pussies can never fight one on one. Pinches montoneros.  https://t.co/r7SLXthfhO
1322656332000817152 2020-11-01 05:46:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is sadder than sad..Obama had to say Joe Biden 3x. Obama is drawing flies I mean no one even clapped when he said Joe Biden.
1322655758295576577 2020-11-01 05:44:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Awww look Trump supporters escorting that BIDEN/HARRIS bus on the freeway. 😂👍🏼🇺🇸 #REDKINGDOM  https://t.co/Ong5TKeMlg
1322655372943921153 2020-11-01 05:43:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If they can do this why can’t they go drop a ballot off in a drop box? Or have a drive thru for ppl just to drop off completed ballots not provided ones that are blank?
1322654093819564033 2020-11-01 05:38:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 @PogO57463854 @254_Steph @PpollingNumbers @CNN Well you would think they’d be more about democracy in their state then.
1322653562933932032 2020-11-01 05:35:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 @matrixyst @PogO57463854 @254_Steph @PpollingNumbers @CNN You’re welcome. Unless they made the law stricter in MA which I’m guessing they haven’t. If they decided to deny your vote over it I’d say that’s pretty non-democratic of them.
1322651883194863616 2020-11-01 05:29:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PogO57463854 @BeardyMan1983 @254_Steph @PpollingNumbers @CNN The vote will count no one is denied their vote for posting an image of it in MA.
1322651647252680704 2020-11-01 05:28:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @matrixyst @PogO57463854 @BeardyMan1983 @254_Steph @PpollingNumbers @CNN Actually it’s complicated.    https://t.co/Leuyu1Qtim
1322649502923190272 2020-11-01 05:19:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM I would say REAL Christians don’t vote for ppl that are for hacking up babies in the womb, but hey maybe I’m wrong. I’m sure this scripture means nothing.. just a clump of cells.  https://t.co/IeIpfTTWOZ
1322645814305382400 2020-11-01 05:05:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM No one is denying anyone their vote or political choice.   But I can tell you Trump supporters are far more accepting than the left is.. even when I was pro choice I wasn’t vilified by them and not I get called a white supremacist for voting for Trump.
1322645125533634560 2020-11-01 05:02:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM Explaining what to Jesus? That you are for the laws set in place and you help ppl?
1322644883488731136 2020-11-01 05:01:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM Again we are all sinners. Breaking the law has consequences. The Bible is pretty clear on that.
1322644353358073856 2020-11-01 04:59:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM If you did you wouldn’t have made a claim like ripping babies away from their mothers as if that’s the only thing that happens at the border. While ignoring the fact the mother is breaking the law with a baby in tow.
1322643958183292929 2020-11-01 04:57:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM That started happening because adults realized they were released into the US because they had a child with them. Yet ppl think it’s because they are seeking asylum. Most come to the US to work and send all their money south because they want to go back someday.
1322643670038843393 2020-11-01 04:56:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM No I’m not saying that, but you assumed all are ripped away from their mothers when that’s not always the case.   Yes making sure children are kept in better facilities then the adults is something I’m for. Detention facilities were never created to house children or babies.
1322643215984422912 2020-11-01 04:54:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM The ripping babies from their mothers is an emotional statement that gets ppl like you to react without knowing all of the facts.   As a Hispanic I know what human traffickers are capable of. Have you ever thought that these children could have been used &amp; now stranded in the US?
1322642642111361024 2020-11-01 04:52:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM I heard a man being interviewed who was crossing illegally mention how he RENTED a child under 2 to get into the country. Did you hear me? RENTED. He admitted the child was taken from him because it was determined he wasn’t the father or even a relative.
1322642297423503360 2020-11-01 04:51:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM Actually what do you know about those young babies being taken from their mothers? How do you know they are their mothers? Why is a mother putting her child at risk of dying trying to cross the border illegally? I’ll have you know as someone who speaks Spanish..
1322641798708166656 2020-11-01 04:49:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM And they are likely voting for the person that didn’t tell them their isn’t a place for pro life democrats in their party.  https://t.co/aDU0VSjhbq
1322640038430081024 2020-11-01 04:42:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM And you have the right to that opinion just like others have the right to theirs.   I can’t be for a party that twerks in front of pro life protestors and believe babies are just clumps of cells up until birth. I have my limits.
1322639455480471554 2020-11-01 04:39:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM No it hasn’t. It went up initially in the first 2 yrs because the money had already been funded for the fiscal year during Obama’s term.  https://t.co/goNQazabAH
1322638704167452673 2020-11-01 04:36:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @eggrobber @JimMFelton @michaeljknowles Jesus had no children because he was a eunuch.   The Bible is NOT pro abortion. A woman could be stoned for being an adulterer not necessarily because they assumed she was pregnant. FYI miscarriages are a natural process  an abortion isn’t.  https://t.co/XTLX1pZjLW
1322637527031799808 2020-11-01 04:32:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker @ArcherBM I was also more pro choice before. I have become pro life these last 4 yrs because the left has gone completely off the rails when it comes to abortion.   The GOP has been trying to pass bills to prevent abortion up to birth. Even restricting abortion to first 8-11 wks.
1322630977944866816 2020-11-01 04:06:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Then you vote for no one. We are all sinners.
1322629986310791168 2020-11-01 04:02:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CodyRing @JackPosobiec Why would he be hiring a lot of ppl? I thought getting rid of ppl was WRONG and not something the president can do according to leftists turds?
1322629431651753984 2020-11-01 04:00:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tweetsie26 @michaeljknowles Are you offended because you voted for Joe Biden? FYI God is for law and order as well or is that not in your Bible deacon?  https://t.co/ar9435XjvT
1322628722084569088 2020-11-01 03:57:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JimMFelton @michaeljknowles Real Christians vote for the PRO LIFE and PRO LAW policies of a man who’s a sinner. Christians really don’t expect him to be Jesus reborn. 😂 Let thee who has NOT sinned come forth
1322628263227715584 2020-11-01 03:55:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Real Christians vote for the PRO LIFE and PRO LAW policies of a man who’s a sinner. Christians really don’t expect him to be Jesus reborn. 😂 Let thee who has NOT sinned come forth.
1322626860782481408 2020-11-01 03:49:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you allow immigrants who hate you and your way of life into your country under the guise of trying not being racist then you deal with the consequences.
1322624108291448832 2020-11-01 03:38:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Suppress them how? By telling them to vote in person and by mail if they are unable to? 😂
1322623758742421504 2020-11-01 03:37:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh so this matters, but not the ballots that were tossed in a ditch? Y’all wanted mail-in voting now you’re worried it backfired? Every time Trump pushed vote in person democrats suggested he was suppressing votes. Now look at you fools scrambling.
1322623165055467522 2020-11-01 03:35:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats running interference in Miami-Dade because they are worried they are losing.  https://t.co/25YjRbZdhC

1322586113484075008 2020-11-01 01:07:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So speaking with the president about helping black people across the country = black ppl wanting to be white? How dare Weezy do that!
1322585563086561280 2020-11-01 01:05:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Of course she was, that’s the end game and @JoeBiden’s handlers know it.
1322584518516092928 2020-11-01 01:01:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oppressed minorities..
1322583982362382336 2020-11-01 00:59:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AbcdeZale Oh you know L.A. doesn’t know how to manage money especially in the hands of democrats.   They need revenue bad and they know they can get it because ppl are driving more these days.
1322583627075448832 2020-11-01 00:58:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tell me how many pollsters lost their jobs after claiming HRC had a 100% chance of winning the presidency? They were so convinced they printed this.. 😂 And Hillary posted this..  https://t.co/m6hVxarh5O
1322582082594304000 2020-11-01 00:51:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TizzleBiz I wouldn’t doubt it, but don’t give these garbage people any ideas.
1322581945348337666 2020-11-01 00:51:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 So imagine getting a citation for $250 and you get $20 off. How tf does that help anyone? Garcetti is a pos. Who elects these morons? Good God.
1322581018864308224 2020-11-01 00:47:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 But only if you pay within 48 hrs. Yep such a giver.
1322580815180525569 2020-11-01 00:46:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Boogaloo Bois *ARE* Anarchists you twit.
1322579794471526400 2020-11-01 00:42:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wow a whole $20 discount for citations?
1322578619537924096 2020-11-01 00:38:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And this is why our 2A RIGHTS matter. Depending on officers to get there on time to protect what’s yours isn’t likely. Fk these Antifa pu$$ies.
1322576626735984642 2020-11-01 00:30:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 That...  https://t.co/A7w2p0BU75
1322576183838453760 2020-11-01 00:28:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 All she needed was the mirror. 😂
1322576018507403264 2020-11-01 00:27:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> While ppl on @msnbc @AlexWitt are discussing Trump’s claim that doctors get paid more for COVID cases because of the CARES ACT, I’ll remind you what he’s saying is TRUE.  https://t.co/wyrg3k4Ct3
1322573097526910982 2020-11-01 00:16:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This just proves time and time again that if Trump had been president Kayla Mueller would be alive today.
1322568591162580992 2020-10-31 23:58:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Bernice is the only one there. 😂
1322568481745764352 2020-10-31 23:57:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yep viruses do that. Still less cases than H1N1 (60M) and COVID (10M) so I’m guessing it will spread more, but more treatments are available than the beginning of the pandemic. So that’s good news.
1322567733460922370 2020-10-31 23:54:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m wheezing..💀  https://t.co/POX9M0Cj9I
1322567083490635776 2020-10-31 23:52:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @doubletapu This seems very likely and the fact she knows her name is even worse. Bernice is a groupie. 😂
1322566914435022851 2020-10-31 23:51:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hikariscyrus She’s so weird. Talking to everyone like they’re kids looking down at them getting eye level.
1322566479217217536 2020-10-31 23:49:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @therealslimlola I would be if I was Bernice.

1322564170882015238 2020-10-31 23:40:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left has killed 2 ppl and assaulted 1000s of others.

1322558988286783488 2020-10-31 23:20:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess Obama forgets that the reason ppl voted for Trump in the first place was because they didn’t like Obama and his policies they wanted actual CHANGE not the same ol’ bs.
1322558360583987200 2020-10-31 23:17:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 Yes he did. Now he’s gone, so sad.

They were trying to get behind the bus and moved over into the lane and hit the truck because they wouldn’t let them in. Which they don’t have to. Are the rules of the road difficult for you ppl?

1322550137042841600 2020-10-31 22:44:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This just shows us that both the bus and car that was struck weren’t in their own lanes. If anything it looks like THEY ran into them. Which leftists are more than capable of.
1322549206662348801 2020-10-31 22:41:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This guy is full of sh*t and claims to be a doctor? *smh*

Then says I might get an android next. I reminded her if she did she was on her own. I’ve never had an Android and had no idea how it worked.   She got another iPhone. 😂
1322363393433497600 2020-10-31 10:22:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And just like clockwork the left is triggered. Trump plays you ppl like a fiddle. It’s hilarious.

That’s why they say you have to let viruses run their course because your immune system does tend to handle most viruses just fine.   But we can’t know how all ppl will be affected

1322311640813989889 2020-10-31 06:57:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t see a problem with what he said. What part of it is not true? Cory Booker basically calls everyone who’s white a white supremacist.   As if black people with guns don’t kill people on the daily. Are guns their tool to fulfill their hate as well @CoryBooker?  https://t.co/ldczzuZpZa
1322310030343860224 2020-10-31 06:50:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes one will blow themselves up in a crowd the other won’t?

1322283089578524672 2020-10-31 05:03:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Remind me how CNN isn’t the enemy of the people again? Good grief they want everyone to live in fear of a virus that has a 99% survival rate. They don’t even realize how they’ve affected the election with their constant fear mongering.
1322282323094589440 2020-10-31 05:00:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Rebird79 @SullyBobbi @henriette88 @davegreenidge57 @albamonica That was the goal. Give scientists and doctors enough time to study the virus to come up with a treatment plan and hopefully a vaccine that helps our immune system identify the virus and attack it sooner so ppl don’t get as sick.   The left pushes too much fear mongering.
1322281227924119552 2020-10-31 04:56:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Rebird79 @SullyBobbi @henriette88 @davegreenidge57 @albamonica This also proves that the Trump admin and CDC was able to stall the spread of a highly infectious “airborne” virus to less than 10M over a period of 11 months.   The precautions were taken and now we have a better understanding of the virus and more ppl are surviving it.
1322280139611279360 2020-10-31 04:52:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Rebird79 @SullyBobbi @henriette88 @davegreenidge57 @albamonica This isn’t a fact check. This just proves that more ppl were infected with H1N1 than COVID like I stated.   If we had 60M infected how many more do you think would have died of COVID?   And still COVID has a pretty good mortality rate of &lt; 1%. Just FYI. 👇🏼  https://t.co/LcMhyx3IR9

1322257476083871744 2020-10-31 03:22:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> One simple question for @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. How do you plan to spend 4T dollars without taxing the middle class?   Just to put that 4T number in perspective. The 400 richest ppl in the US are worth 3.2T and already pay 89% of all taxes.  https://t.co/jo8eEbMmOp

1322224654207995904 2020-10-31 01:11:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yep and to be factual that’s actually less than nothing when comparing it to the population of the US as a whole.  1 = something, 0 = nothing.   328M - .00035% = 1148
1322222319171850242 2020-10-31 01:02:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @nerosfiddle84 They are looking into that. Because there may be some markers indicating that plays a part.    https://t.co/6vWVxLgRVl

1322045834687442944 2020-10-30 13:21:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And remember that Obama collected a salary every year of $400k and golfed yet never managed to get anything done. Trump could golf everyday as long as he gets stuff done for the American ppl.
1322044738199937025 2020-10-30 13:16:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is partly false.. because he was a “FORMER” KKK leader just not a “grand wizard”. It doesn’t change the fact that he was a KKK recruiter and eulogized by Biden.  https://t.co/3xOaOZmnZu
1322042357286539265 2020-10-30 13:07:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @itsblrose @dbongino Degrading BLM? Tell me what do these pictures do to the movement?  https://t.co/lV8Z8Av6Dr
1322041022935781376 2020-10-30 13:01:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> A CNN poll tho? 😂
1322036002144202754 2020-10-30 12:41:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s because you are victims of the fear mongering by the left. They push your emotional buttons to get what they want from you, your vote.
1322031444621885441 2020-10-30 12:23:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This right here makes me smile. ♥️  https://t.co/PHTL3UYc33
1322025055614693376 2020-10-30 11:58:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sarahcpr would be nothing without Donald Trump. Not sure how her career is gonna last if Trump loses. All these goons who have no talent have actually become famous for hating Trump. 😂 They won’t have any new material to mimic hope they saved their pennies.
1322023363166916610 2020-10-30 11:51:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So basically a little more than a 1% death rate? Isn’t this what we’ve been saying the whole fking time that the survival rate for COVID is very high?
1322021851665588225 2020-10-30 11:45:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This poor dog has seen some sh*t. 😩  https://t.co/CD7utUbdDd
1322017405988564995 2020-10-30 11:28:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @windowtothewalt Well dammit!
1322016963686641665 2020-10-30 11:26:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 Lol. I think both should be legal. No one should be arrested for smoking weed.
1322015152632262657 2020-10-30 11:19:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Where they in a car? Do we know what they did prior to turning around? Sorry I just don’t trust ppl who participate in riots and bring their babies along knowing what was going on in the area.
1322014667821101058 2020-10-30 11:17:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Killing ok, smoking weed not so much.
1322013767715057664 2020-10-30 11:13:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker So they did take the baby with them to a riot? The hell is wrong with these ppl?   Leftists often make claims of “brutality” by police while they are actively breaking the law and assaulting officers.
1322013022794084352 2020-10-30 11:10:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whole_9_meters  https://t.co/5c0qJR5qDp
1322012692685545472 2020-10-30 11:09:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HaleydSmith2612 Just makes me sick. I can’t with these mfkers. They don’t deserve the air they breathe.
1322012293513662466 2020-10-30 11:07:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @windowtothewalt Oh is that how that works? Here I thought I earned my wage based on my merits and experience. 😂
1322010474725011458 2020-10-30 11:00:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Leftists make me sick. Who brings, then loses what looks to be a 3 yr old at a fkin riot? Trash humans.
1322009961438720000 2020-10-30 10:58:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually Joe, I’m Latina and I make more then some white men make. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1322009698334203904 2020-10-30 10:57:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @nerosfiddle84 Iconic. 😂
1322009480993804290 2020-10-30 10:56:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Anyone with two brains cells to rub together knows that the texts and emails have been confirmed as Hunter Biden’s. @NBCNews you’re trash for correlating this to the story that Bobulinski came forward about. #enemyofthepeople
1322004177128620032 2020-10-30 10:35:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gamingangel @KamVTV @LilTunechi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I guess you really haven’t looked at his policies.   Stopping illegals from coming into the country helps those who can come here on migrant visas to work legally.   Opportunity zones helped a lot of minority communities have more job opportunities.   School choice. List goes on.
1322003571429109761 2020-10-30 10:33:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SwampWatching @TheRightMelissa @LilTunechi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @chelseahandler This is a lie...
1322003423814774784 2020-10-30 10:32:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hogan_1969 @MarkDice @LilTunechi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You’re assuming we don’t buy his music already. 😂
1322002769373376513 2020-10-30 10:29:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is what leftists do when they are uncomfortable.
1322001956106170368 2020-10-30 10:26:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The memories...even when I was on the left I wasn’t this nuts.
1321986319430529024 2020-10-30 09:24:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TizzleBiz And I love Sally.
1321986107622387714 2020-10-30 09:23:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If any violence happens on Election Day it will be because Trump won not because he lost which tells me everything I need to know about the violence from the hateful left.
1321959343936303104 2020-10-30 07:37:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap No doubt.
1321948256209825792 2020-10-30 06:53:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco Are a very visible filling.
1321948134231044096 2020-10-30 06:52:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are black men not allowed to speak with the president about their ideas fkin bigot?
1321947983164829696 2020-10-30 06:52:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well guess Lil Wayne is cancelled. 😂
1321944910392557568 2020-10-30 06:40:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @giobrunetti @OnEdgePromotion @TuckerCarlson She did say it she just didn’t say the laptop part.   So please don’t say 95% of what she said isn’t quoted correctly because they inserted 5%.   You can’t discredit the whole thing as false when she did say the majority of what’s there.
1321944413833060352 2020-10-30 06:38:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh I’m sure he gave veiled threats like most Antifa supporters in government.
1321914485896933376 2020-10-30 04:39:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 I think they do that here and there. They keep rewriting the rules.
1321914314073100288 2020-10-30 04:38:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LizzerMack Yea not sure where they go this map. Lol. If CALIFORNIA goes red this election no way Biden would win.
1321906066318225408 2020-10-30 04:05:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Has a Hispanic woman I’m offended that Biden would say that Trump said that about Mexicans. He said there are rapists coming from Mexico illegally and let loose in our country and just a fact.
1321904799256776705 2020-10-30 04:00:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You’re so fking arrogant. Not everything is about you.
1321904230219698176 2020-10-30 03:58:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hell I thought knives didn’t kill ppl the way these dopes talk about knives.  https://t.co/314rz9NCTw
1321903773246091266 2020-10-30 03:56:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoo Only weirdos with PhDs demand a “B” be capitalized thinking it exalts them in some way.   Black supremacy is very fkin cringe just like White Supremacy.
1321884422086434817 2020-10-30 02:39:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are you literally shaking @Acosta? What’s NOT normal is our media speaking negatively about the president 92% of the time. That is why you and CNN are so disliked.
1321849916537229312 2020-10-30 00:22:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Alexpad Them being cringe. They are voting for Biden and wearing RBG tops.
1321847381327925249 2020-10-30 00:12:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 33.1% GDP. Remember this is Trumps economy asshoes!! Woot woot.
1321680505503248392 2020-10-29 13:09:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oblivion_94 @TimRunsHisMouth The left won’t be talking about it as much if they lose the election.   It’s a political talking point right now. It won’t be as much once the election is over and if Biden wins I’m pretty sure it won’t be mentioned at all.
1321676748824612864 2020-10-29 12:54:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBobbyDMAGA With leftists you never know.
1321676352915824640 2020-10-29 12:52:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBobbyDMAGA 💀
1321676272913711104 2020-10-29 12:52:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ho_stampede Looks like 3 generations of lefty women in Texas going to the polls for Biden like that represents the majority. It’s cringe.
1321673866800893952 2020-10-29 12:43:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TomNentwig Agreed it’s ridiculous. No ballot should be counted if it’s not post marked by Election Day.   But every time the Dems make new rules those new rules bite them in the ass.   Look what Harry Reid did.. now you got Dems complaining about all the judges the (R) senate confirmed. 😂
1321673337647505409 2020-10-29 12:40:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Providing funds to a “hospital project” is clearly deplorable. 😂
1321672980443750400 2020-10-29 12:39:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #Trump2020 🇺🇸
1321664422142599169 2020-10-29 12:05:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Because she has a normal non celebrity side that seems blatantly honest.
1321664048383975424 2020-10-29 12:03:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t see how LePen loses the next election to this guy.  https://t.co/YBPbDmiCR3
1321653305404088320 2020-10-29 11:21:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco They think they are gonna win Florida too. 😂
1321653160805494784 2020-10-29 11:20:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 60M Americans were infected with H1N1. COVID still has a long way to go to reach those kinds of case numbers. We currently have 140M tested and only 9M+ total cases and 6M recovered as of 10/28.
1321651915097169920 2020-10-29 11:15:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tampke I have to laugh. The salt mines will over flow if Trump wins a second term.
1321651752387579905 2020-10-29 11:15:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gopfan2020 @GovWhitmer @RalphNortham Yep Anarchists and Antifa run in the same circles. They both ultimately want the same things. They were glad to help start riots and bring down statues.
1321651163461087232 2020-10-29 11:12:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well that’s your choice.
1321650713282240513 2020-10-29 11:10:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl I doubt it. Just like I don’t believe Kathy Griffin was ever diagnosed.   I can see Khloe getting it tho. Not sure why.
1321650424454148096 2020-10-29 11:09:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So the people that plotted to kidnap @GovWhitmer were all Anarchists that hate government and Trump? 😂 These are the same ppl democrats defend when riots happen.  https://t.co/u32oAfGveX
1321649054758002688 2020-10-29 11:04:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r I’m on the west coast. I could be up until 1am and that’s 4am for the east. This broad dumb af.
1321648868027588608 2020-10-29 11:03:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes even celebrities in their bubbles can get COVID and survive.
1321648299951095809 2020-10-29 11:01:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder if she would have made the same claim had Biden been ahead?   I had no clue “bots” could vote in twitter polls.. and Trump is winning by way more than 25k votes anyway. Guess you’ve never heard of ppl working the night shift either. 😂
1321647256018194432 2020-10-29 10:57:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For Dems it’s crunch time and they didn’t think about the consequences of their fear mongering and telling all their supporters to basically only vote by mail unless they want to die from COVID. 😂 GOP actually has an advantage with mail in because they follow the elections.  https://t.co/jH7jJ8YAtw
1321645727089479680 2020-10-29 10:51:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShaineScalph Shes calling everyone the N word. 😂 Shes nuts but does have the right to support whoever she wants this election just like Antifa nutters.
1321644397587431425 2020-10-29 10:45:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What proven corruption is there on Trump or any of his family? They were investigated for 3 yrs. Biden’s have actual texts, emails and voice recordings confirming everything that they’ve done. Y’all are so brain dead.
1321584200034648065 2020-10-29 06:46:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Dude if you still believe that sh*t your ignorance should disqualify you from voting.

1321545823012810752 2020-10-29 04:14:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dusm1811 He worked for GOOGLE then goes out to campaign for Biden. Fkin swamp rats.   #DrainTheSwamp
1321541627718987777 2020-10-29 03:57:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Miles Taylor looks to be just another RINO who’s out supporting Biden because Biden did so much for the policies he supports over his 47 yrs.   Maybe he’s just looking for a job in the Administration.
1321541048875638784 2020-10-29 03:55:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So this is news worthy but the fact a witness to the Biden corruption spoke on @TuckerCarlson isn’t? This is why the left is so uninformed about politics and actual NEWS.   https://t.co/myz80Il52A
1321540044910288896 2020-10-29 03:51:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Miles Taylor who works for Google is the anonymous source? This sh*t writes itself. What illegal policies exactly were carried out?  https://t.co/TpVsss1uzV

1321538124124540928 2020-10-29 03:43:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So an anonymous authored oped gets more traction and credibility than the Hunter Biden story with actual evidence and an actual witness who came forward? What a fkin joke the media is.
1321537344193720320 2020-10-29 03:40:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Stock2067 @stillgray So now you get to regulate who’s allowed in Philly? 😂 The utter elitism from those who claim oppression everyday they exist. The irony.
1321537088005664768 2020-10-29 03:39:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Remind us who the Nazis are again?
1321536616628826112 2020-10-29 03:37:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead I’m still wondering how that person knows for a fact Nancy isn’t a booze hound. I mean they were so matter of fact about it. 😂
1321531011985887232 2020-10-29 03:15:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @e03c33955dd143c She’ll be one of those that requires a sperm donor she’s selected to get pregnant that she’ll later sue for child support.
1321530648394260480 2020-10-29 03:13:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead I’m confused who’s taking away heathcare? They realize healthcare still exists even without ACA right?   Wait, never mind leftists are brain dead and easily emotionally manipulated so I answered my own question. 😂
1321525641196392448 2020-10-29 02:54:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I have to laugh when leftists think they know anything about being funny. They can’t even meme. 🤣
1321525482878357504 2020-10-29 02:53:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Dan_Marchais @Deseeded1 @joerogan Damn wtf would that make you?

Oh and the ones that lose elections.  https://t.co/IEVuyEPjQt
1321524553013579781 2020-10-29 02:49:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Dan_Marchais @politicalamity2 @sipthisnonsense Sorry since when are viruses blamed on presidents you complete lawn flamingo?   60M infected with H1N1 and I don’t blame H1N1 deaths on Obama because I’m not a moron. I’m sure these top 2 reasons for dying are the president’s fault as well. 🙄 Oh look pneumonia and flu!!  https://t.co/3FsuV3KJeD
1321518232948203521 2020-10-29 02:24:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deseeded1 @joerogan That snatchasaurus!!
1321517379449360385 2020-10-29 02:21:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @giobrunetti @OnEdgePromotion @TuckerCarlson But it’s not...
1321516920814776320 2020-10-29 02:19:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @politicalamity2 @Dan_Marchais @sipthisnonsense Don’t waste your time on angry commies. Some will likely stroke out on Election Day if Trump wins a second term and I’ll just shrug.   Leftists if Trump announced winner...  https://t.co/34VzUEwdMr
1321516158495805440 2020-10-29 02:16:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Dan_Marchais @sipthisnonsense @AmandaMarcotte Maybe that’s because leftists are too afraid to go on his show because they are cowards that don’t want to answer tough questions?
1321492929433645063 2020-10-29 00:44:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s Sasha of course you were.  https://t.co/Y7opihsucy
1321492108193067010 2020-10-29 00:40:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 The cringe.
1321467818303352834 2020-10-28 23:04:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Seattle on its mission to become more of a sh*thole by decriminalizing criminals.
1321466862408855552 2020-10-28 23:00:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 My thing is why hating yourself in a video like this gets any likes at all? I’d be the first one to ask, “wth is wrong with you?”
1321465285761658881 2020-10-28 22:54:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 It makes me so sad to see this crap, you have no idea.
1321464697413984258 2020-10-28 22:51:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who teaches these children to hate themselves for their skin color? The people who do are racist and a danger to society.  https://t.co/3FLAe6g6ph
1321335315152261120 2020-10-28 14:17:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Shall I remind you that HILLARY out raised Trump and she still lost. When you have a majority of the elites and celebs in your pocket of course you get more donations. I’m still wondering how ppl who are unemployed and starving according to Dems are managing to donate to Biden?

1321332515504705536 2020-10-28 14:06:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea I’m sure this is going to work after y’all had 130+ days of rioting. 🙄
1321332184926486528 2020-10-28 14:05:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> After seeing their breakdowns and crying after ACB was confirmed feminists can’t be trusted with the next generation or anything.

1321330861606793216 2020-10-28 14:00:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @UnRepConsrvtive @TheDemocrats They are so fking dramatic.
1321328994659094528 2020-10-28 13:52:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now confirming a Supreme Court justice to an empty seat = damage? These ppl are literally insane.
1321328174253236224 2020-10-28 13:49:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “The elderly are now literally dying due to Trump rallys” .. so who died? Pretty dramatic claim, from the elderly collapsing.. to going to the hospital... and now dying?   Got a source you utter clown?
1321326918008909824 2020-10-28 13:44:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good! These ppl existed right under Obama’s nose and were never caught. Thank you @realDonaldTrump!!!   https://t.co/roEsycwilr
1321325008250044418 2020-10-28 13:36:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 Oh I can see that happening.
1321324834517737478 2020-10-28 13:36:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Men, remember impregnating beasts has consequences.
1321318035664244737 2020-10-28 13:09:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 Well they are in danger if they are unarmed and the other person has a knife or gun.   So claiming these are “unarmed” units needs to be explained. Because using sedative injections would be a form or being armed.
1321317551134011393 2020-10-28 13:07:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MariaKChica @KimKardashian This coming from the same ppl that probably watch every episode of the kardashians and buy all their products and still wonder how they can do this? 😂  Ppl are truly a trip.

1321306939410780162 2020-10-28 12:24:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes as in Joe’s done. That’s been proved with all the lids his campaign has called.

1321294809009717249 2020-10-28 11:36:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Banks forgiving debt is NOT illegal. The fact you want to drum up a conspiracy theory yet again is fkin hilarious. Why not go ask about Biden and his family selling access during Obama’s presidency?
1321294331991511043 2020-10-28 11:34:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This isn’t news... lol. Lenders can forgive debt, it’s not illegal. Unlike what the Biden family did by selling access to the VP. You gonna report on that Kyle?
1321293697292640257 2020-10-28 11:32:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually anyone has the right to turn away anyone for any reason when you are self employed. All they have to say is they can’t take your case no reason needs to be given. 🤷🏻‍♀️

1321287599181467650 2020-10-28 11:08:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 I think I just did. 😳
1321287285929893896 2020-10-28 11:06:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap It makes no sense. One slip and you’re a fkin puddle below. Just scary.

1321283863461572609 2020-10-28 10:53:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What theeeee fk?! And why?!
1321283139000438784 2020-10-28 10:50:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead Girl I feel you 100%.
1321281114330132481 2020-10-28 10:42:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The problem here is they were trying to change the election laws last minute. Most states require ballots to be postmarked by Election Day to be counted. Why would that need to change? Dems are realizing scaring their voters half to death &amp; pushing mail in ballots may fail.
1321278618480226304 2020-10-28 10:32:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 🤣

1321278038261153793 2020-10-28 10:30:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JBAmericanPNW It’s very sad, but they won’t do better until they want to. They don’t want to at this point because they believe what they are told by the media that they deserve a better life just because they are black. There’s no need to work for it either. They get a pass just because.

They are actively calling for the president to be harmed. Absolutely vile pieces of sh*t intolerant scum. @FBI @GOPLeader @TuckerCarlson #vote to keep the ppl these mental patients would vote for out of office.  https://t.co/lNnQOwnYRf

1321263981705654272 2020-10-28 09:34:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> There’s also sexual assault allegations against Biden so what’s her point?
1321251412433465346 2020-10-28 08:44:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Omg this @TuckerCarlson interview with Tony Bobulinski is damning for the Bidens.   #BidenLied #BidenLeaks   @SenateGOP

1321225856191115264 2020-10-28 07:02:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MyraGrigg @JoeBiden *smh* totally not surprised. 60M infected they had to make sure that stayed out of the news cycle.

How tf you gonna crush a virus without a vaccine Joe? Wearing masks doesn’t save everyone from getting infected. You complete mashed potato!
1321201976776900608 2020-10-28 05:27:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OvertonGaslight @SenateDems I’m dead.
1321201846099177472 2020-10-28 05:27:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Example of how Dems use language to vilify their opposition.   When (R) decided to confirm ACB it was an “illegitimate” process and Reps were just “packing” the court with their “ideologues”.    When (D) want to ACTUALLY stack the court they say it’s “balancing” or “expanding”.
1321184603965542401 2020-10-28 04:18:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @breakonthru234 Leftists aren’t winning in the 9th anymore. They hate it. Because it’s the only court they’d run to for a grievance.
1321184256803041281 2020-10-28 04:17:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 💀
1321182642776150016 2020-10-28 04:11:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh so now the 9th has to be broken up? That’s funny because it was the only court leftists wanted to deal with until Trump started appointing conservative judges to bring a balance 😂  https://t.co/gbowY3jfrF
1321181228905607168 2020-10-28 04:05:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you can’t get your ballot in by Election Day how is that anyone else’s problem? Pretty soon you’ll have Democrats pushing to give ppl another month in case it’s close they can go door to door telling ppl how to vote and filling out ballots.
1321180036649476097 2020-10-28 04:00:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So Supreme Court justices can’t have a different opinion? Wow this is new fkin information. 🙄   https://t.co/Dnj0IWTh5C

1321150856444608513 2020-10-28 02:04:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @p3driver @POTUS Iran and Russia are buddies. So it makes ZERO sense that Trump is being supported by Russia.   Also China doesn’t like Trump they were forced to come to the table as well. Their only solution was to do business with us unless they start weeding the herd.
1321150151193284609 2020-10-28 02:01:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What rule did republicans change? Democrats losing an election isn’t a rule change numbnuts.   Why don’t you listen to RBG? 👇🏼  https://t.co/YRK2Vhooth

1321148212879618049 2020-10-28 01:54:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fact: If Trump wins this election Iran will be forced to come to the table. Their economy will not last another 4 years with Trump as @POTUS.   This is why Iran is hoping Biden wins this election so they can go back to getting US tax payer money to fund terrorism.
1321135247874912262 2020-10-28 01:02:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl shouldn’t get pregnant. They will latch their crazed ideology to their children. This child has ZERO hope.

1321123979608817664 2020-10-28 00:17:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead That’s why it’s funny when they complain about ACB and her qualifications. Ffs Obama placed a woman who’s never even served on the bench for a life time appointment.
1321123684174577664 2020-10-28 00:16:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hearing Obama talk makes me nauseous.   If they could manage to get more ppl out to their rallies they wouldn’t call Trumps super spreader events.   I don’t recall the democrats calling BLM protests or CHAZ super spreader situations. Their hypocrisy is so obvious.
1320990154165645312 2020-10-27 15:26:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sure you know how to make the flour and all the stuff that is required to make the bread as well?

1320969715515154432 2020-10-27 14:04:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Obviously looting is a type of reparation. I think at the end of it all the US won’t owe any reparations for slavery. The millions in damages and looting x slave time currency value = DEBT PAID.
1320968518842499074 2020-10-27 14:00:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Agreed.. blessed be the fruit. 😂  https://t.co/2T3fGnQmml

1320967186119180289 2020-10-27 13:54:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He was going towards officers with the knife after being told repeatedly to drop it and came within 10 ft before he was shot and killed.   👆🏼That’s kind of important.
1320966524014714881 2020-10-27 13:52:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl We are losing our rights girl, Handmaid it is, I guess. 😂
1320966137354448897 2020-10-27 13:50:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> She was confirmed today and was invited by the president to the White House what’s your fking problem?  https://t.co/rICUNQ9rBI

1320963812372041729 2020-10-27 13:41:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This officer was suspended by the fascists in NY for trolling this fkin commie pos on the speaker.
1320962696662036480 2020-10-27 13:37:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead I don’t believe Kagan served on any district court before her nomination. Yet she sits on the Supreme Court and even got support from Republicans.  https://t.co/s8mLto8wtg
1320961933789388802 2020-10-27 13:34:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Since when have parents stopped teaching their kids to respect officers?   It’s this lack of respect for the law that has got a lot of you mfkers killed. All while y’all cry about can’t they use non lethal force instead?   Obviously ppl getting shot hasn’t stopped you dumbasses.
1320960010155741185 2020-10-27 13:26:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ram41662 The Dems have pushed so much fear over her nomination that these are the results of that fear mongering.   And Dems claim they don’t fear monger. 😂
1320959676318576642 2020-10-27 13:25:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hipcinema @stillgray He had a knife and was asked repeatedly to drop it. Why continue to go towards officers with a deadly weapon?   The woman tried to stop him and he pushed her aside. At this point maybe his goal was suicide by cop.
1320958623019790336 2020-10-27 13:20:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Boogaloo Bois are Anarchists that’s why they get along with Antifa they have the same goals.

I asked you a  question about voting. Which you could have easily responded to but chose not to.   Always very odd. Not how I would respond when asked a question about voting.
1320957258658840576 2020-10-27 13:15:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @IanMCohen @HappyManor @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump How so? I thought the rest of the world hates Trump and we are not respected as a nation because of him?   Being anti globalist has nothing to do with Jews. Why do latch everything on to jews? Do you enjoy playing victim often?

FYI I never claimed YOU were an extremist. Do you support extremists on the ballot?   You make a lot of assumptions of those on the right while complaining ppl do it 2 u

I didn’t imply anything. And again you could have just said you didn’t vote for governor if you didn’t.   Why beat around the bush on who you voted for?

Harassing Jews for not wearing a mask is wrong and can be seen as anti Semitic because I don’t see police going after BLM protestors for the same thing. So it’s targeted harassment.
1320950959275601920 2020-10-27 12:50:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @OrdyPackard @HappyManor @IanMCohen @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump How’s that defending him? The mask issue isn’t anti Semitic I said it’s not lawful to require a mask and harass ppl for it.   And you provided the proof it isn’t. Ppl being harassed for wearing a mask isn’t a Jewish issue it’s an American one.

So are you saying you voted for Cynthia Nixon? She’s more lefty than Cuomo.

Are you misinterpreting what I said because you’re insane?   Health regulations and rules aren’t laws passed by the state congress.

They are the ones who don’t want to have thanksgiving with their Trump supporting family members. And you have women manipulating their dying father to vote Dem. Its truly despicable.

The only difference is that a SC justice hasn’t passed this close to an election. Nowhere does it say in the constitution you can’t nominate and place a judge in an election yr.

1320904311946145792 2020-10-27 09:45:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What hardball? Republicans aren’t trying to expand the court. They are confirming a judge for an empty seat that was nominated by the president.

Safer?   Israel doesn’t matter to you. You made that clear. You didn’t care what happened to them as long as it didn’t affect you from 3000 miles away.   You don’t have to be among non-Jews.

1320856128419344385 2020-10-27 06:33:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IanMCohen @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump So he gave them a record amount of aid but couldn’t move the embassy?   Where have I stated that I want more government? 😂   You seem easily confused. I asked why don’t you call out Dems who make promises they don’t keep on the campaign trail? I don’t care if you’re a Jew.
1320855346924011520 2020-10-27 06:30:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @IanMCohen @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump So blaming a whole group of Jews makes them casual anti jew?   Mask enforcement is NOT legitimate.   What NY law says you have to wear a mask and that rioters were some how  exempt from it? So now harassing Jews at their homes but allowing actual crimes like looting is fine?
1320854669556510721 2020-10-27 06:27:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @IanMCohen @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump “He literally used money libel and dual loyalty as compliments”.   How does this broad statement have anything to do with Jews?   And how did Trump get a Jewish school shot up via a conspiracy theory by a guy that doesn’t even support him? What school?
1320853545436942336 2020-10-27 06:23:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @couchfish1 @RealCandaceO @JoeBiden So you’re response to Joe Biden knowing about all this illegal activity means absolutely nothing to you?   I’m not sure how your claim of Don Jr doing cocaine somehow takes away the fact Hunter continues to do the same sh*t he took pictures of and has been in hiding over it.
1320852489072066565 2020-10-27 06:19:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 @AdumbroDeus @Crops101 @IanMCohen @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump They aren’t. Try being a conservative Jew and see how quickly the “casually anti Semitic” left turn on you.
1320851663326826496 2020-10-27 06:15:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @IanMCohen @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump Cuomo is “casually” anti Semitic? He’s full blown anti Semitic he’s using officers to harass Jews.   Please provide the anti-Semitic behavior Trump has exhibited? Should be easy for you to provide evidence since you’ve made the claim.
1320851116356071424 2020-10-27 06:13:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So tell me Brian why would “George” have FOUR MORE YEARS? This makes no sense at all. I see you’re trying to run cover for @JoeBiden you absolute hack!
1320849631425687553 2020-10-27 06:07:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IanMCohen @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump Tell me what Democrats or progressive have done for the Jewish community in the US or abroad after all these years?   All they’ve done is incite violence against Jews by fascist leftists who hate them for supporting the president who wants the best for ALL Americans.
1320847306539692032 2020-10-27 05:58:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @IanMCohen @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump So you have Cuomo a Democrat claiming he’s defending Jews while harassing Jewish communities with officers he wants to defund? Don’t you find any of that hypocritical at all?   Why don’t you call out Democrats for doing the opposite of what they promised?
1320846795015028736 2020-10-27 05:56:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @IanMCohen @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump Yes and both are non Jews. Trump said he would move the embassy and he did.   It’s funny to me how democrat voters allow politicians to negate on their promises they made on the campaign trails. That’s the thing Trump isn’t a politician and his actions speak LOUDLY.
1320846272283045888 2020-10-27 05:54:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IanMCohen @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump It’s not since he has continued to do things to help Jews and Israel.   Why weren’t dem donors paying anyone to keep their promises about moving the embassy? Are they anti jew? Trump didn’t come up with it. It was a promise that several politicians made and never made happen.
1320824111149379584 2020-10-27 04:26:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IanMCohen @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump Who wasn’t making these things happen in 2009? Democrats have been saying they were going to move the embassy for years now and Trump does it and its a bad thing because it was pushed by adelson? 😂
1320823491533230081 2020-10-27 04:23:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @my5fireflies @georgesoros @GeorgeGascon @RaiseURH @RealJamesWoods @CarmenAmy1 @RealEricCarmen @kirstiealley Wow just wow, but we are called conspiracy theorists when we say these Dems are funded by Soros.
1320804616573906944 2020-10-27 03:08:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdumbroDeus @BeardyMan1983 @Crops101 @IanMCohen @Tzedek_Assoc @realDonaldTrump Yes putting our embassy in Jerusalem is very anti Semitic I mean geez. 🙄 Getting leaders in the Middle East to sign peace deals with Israel is definitely something a goyim would do.
1320800575580073985 2020-10-27 02:52:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 Yea I have no idea what else they might have done. In these times I’m surprised no one was killed.
1320794124342079488 2020-10-27 02:27:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JohnnyBananas79 That’s what I’m saying. It could’ve anything. You never know with these ppl.
1320793938052009984 2020-10-27 02:26:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 I guess they threw water on him or what they are claiming. My problem is they shouldn’t throw anything on a person.   At least he didn’t shoot someone dead like that other guy did over pepper spray.
1320784925709135873 2020-10-27 01:50:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob They’ve tossed urine and concrete on ppl. Can’t put anything past these mfkers. They are the lowest of the low.
1320784673652445184 2020-10-27 01:49:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Does anyone care what @AOC says? I don’t think so.” - @Jose_Aristimuno on @OutnumberedOT 😂
1320783209823494144 2020-10-27 01:43:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t care if it’s water it’s fking assault and a person can’t know wtf you are tossing on them you stupid twit.   https://t.co/XInMMPQltm

If her father has no symptoms &amp; mother has not become ill please tell me what the problem is w/ him not wearing a mask? If she feels it’s not safe for her then don’t visit. N95 is the only mask that helps her  https://t.co/jFQxR0pkWE
1320751038660374529 2020-10-26 23:36:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Mr President.. @realDonaldTrump 👇🏼
1320740760015101952 2020-10-26 22:55:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo They don’t care about us. They care about power. How can ppl vote to gave their freedoms taken? Getting them back usually requires a WAR.
1320740506901516289 2020-10-26 22:54:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PerkinsJanie @jadedcreative You ppl are insane. It’s why this former dem supporter is voting for Trump in 2020.
1320740314504544260 2020-10-26 22:53:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @janicesghost @jadedcreative That’s just a nice way of telling you not to go over. I’m assuming neither has got COVID so not sure what your problem is.
1320738835924348928 2020-10-26 22:47:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You know what I find so strange? Is that ppl being polled think Biden would be better on COVID when he was part of the admin who had depleted our PPE, made us dependent on China for medical goods while 60M Americans contracted H1N1. Had it been as deadly millions would have died.
1320736740882067457 2020-10-26 22:39:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let’s hope it works out for them. They really have no control over how it’s written after they elect those officials. We know leftists are a plague on freedoms.
1320736023031074817 2020-10-26 22:36:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LtShiny @kayenmo You are brainwashed has nothing to do with your political view. I don’t even know what your political view is.   You on the other hand called black ppl dumb for having a different political opinion than you. Talk about being a fkin hypocrite. Those on the left usually are tho.
1320735586269888512 2020-10-26 22:34:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LtShiny @Rick95648 Actually black people have started using YT to be offensive. It gains them so many points doesn’t it?   They are Caucasian. Mostly the media likes to cause division by using  terms like black and white.
1320734119911829506 2020-10-26 22:28:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LtShiny @kayenmo Actually the racist is you. I never assumed you were black. You claimed black people who vote for Trump are dumb because they don’t agree with how you would vote.   Black people aren’t a monolith you fktard.
1320733572915888128 2020-10-26 22:26:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LtShiny @kayenmo FYI Trump never called people to be executed for nothing. He wanted a rapist who brutally assaulted a woman to be charged to get the death penalty. The group wasn’t innocent they had assaulted ppl in the park even if they weren’t the ones who raped &amp; assaulted the woman.  https://t.co/8KJjiYj3Z4
1320732188271235073 2020-10-26 22:21:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LtShiny @kayenmo Trump talks about how bad areas democrats run. If those areas happen to have a large black population that doesn’t change the fact the cities are sh*t. Why do black ppl not expect anything from those they elect into office?   These are BLM protestors...  https://t.co/CT6Duo3VHz
1320731280879697921 2020-10-26 22:17:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LtShiny Actually I did.. I’m surprised you haven’t.. I know plenty of black ppl. Black people support Trump as well.
1320607961308299265 2020-10-26 14:07:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Remember this folks. She didn’t care about the economy, your livelihoods or businesses just “saving lives” even if it cost you yours. Another reason ppl are leaving the Bay.  https://t.co/QevAsdrxkf
1320606531574927360 2020-10-26 14:01:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea I don’t buy this sh*t for a sec.  https://t.co/M6n9uEoZCS
1320600155666591745 2020-10-26 13:36:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @unashamedusa @chelseahandler @50cent Yep looks that way. The left has a way of cucking ppl to their will.
1320599887566630912 2020-10-26 13:35:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk Looks like @50cent can take bullets,  but not criticism from the left.
1320599381830037504 2020-10-26 13:33:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess that @chelseahandler reminder that he’s Black helped. Remember this when your taxes go up @50cent.
1320596829474467840 2020-10-26 13:23:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tampke It’s what I’ve heard. No confirmation tho.
1320594332747919360 2020-10-26 13:13:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If Hunter has passed away my next question would be is WHAT did he know?   The establishment swamp rats don’t like to leave lose ends.
1320594050357940224 2020-10-26 13:12:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @_Charlene_T Another lose end the establishment needed to get rid of, if true.
1320590378488066048 2020-10-26 12:57:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Phillygirl741 @gatewaypundit Even if he died? *smh*
1320570287641903104 2020-10-26 11:37:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually he’s getting more black and Latino support than he did in 2016.
1320561029592461313 2020-10-26 11:00:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yesssssss
1320555592381915138 2020-10-26 10:39:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Sodangfancy100 You and I would get along so well irl.  https://t.co/jSAJhSUAEf
1320555278824161280 2020-10-26 10:38:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HappyManor  https://t.co/zPyw9fxvSx
1320554522217869312 2020-10-26 10:35:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Translation: Democrats ARE sh*t.
1320553710750060544 2020-10-26 10:31:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Voting is an essential service in my opinion. So continue to vote in person Texans.
1320553288421363712 2020-10-26 10:30:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I can’t stop laughing.. 🤣  https://t.co/4OwBqlCDn9
1320552877165670400 2020-10-26 10:28:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes passports are a valid form of ID.
1320544929995583488 2020-10-26 09:57:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes please continue doing it so ppl can see what complete lunatics you are.  https://t.co/xZxiGup2hF
1320535264154927106 2020-10-26 09:18:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> All things within his presidential rights and responsibilities. They’d all likely lose their jobs if Biden wins too.
1320532769290633221 2020-10-26 09:08:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo Brainwashing like that has no cure.
1320532164228780033 2020-10-26 09:06:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Rick95648 No idea, but then again BLACK LIVES and all.
1320531945248288769 2020-10-26 09:05:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @LtShiny @kemwilson3 @cenkuygur Biden has destroyed lots of black families by removing black fathers from their homes with the crime bill.
1320529376857845761 2020-10-26 08:55:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You shouldn’t use the term “blacks” it’s offensive or so I’ve heard.
1320498877322072065 2020-10-26 06:54:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey Yes run along like I’m sure you always do when asked about serious issues in 2020 while you fight about what started the civil war and hating on Lincoln.
1320496656089923585 2020-10-26 06:45:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey What’s inaccurate about what I posted from  https://t.co/RF89g51pTN?
1320496311599165441 2020-10-26 06:43:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey The confederates picked the fight when they attacked Fort Sumter in 1861.. the North ended it.   People die everyday regardless of WARS. If you think ending wars ends death then you’d be sadly mistaken.   What kind of war do you think ppl are fighting in Chicago?  https://t.co/fMul98trLN
1320491432000434176 2020-10-26 06:24:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey So now  https://t.co/Hu1IbYD4A3 is a wiki site? 😂 Which sites or links have you provided to support your points? Oh that’s right..  https://t.co/OHunCQfnWY
1320490859045871616 2020-10-26 06:22:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BobGrosfield @HotMama83163983 Excellent question.
1320490790783574016 2020-10-26 06:21:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey When did I say I was “hung ho for combat”?   I would try to avoid war at any cost, like any leader would.   Lincoln tried to avoid war as well, he wanted peaceful negotiations. When Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter in April 1861 in Charleston, the Civil War broke out.
1320489477723222016 2020-10-26 06:16:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey I never said the war was all about ending slavery, but freeing the slaves did get Lincoln killed.   If it had nothing to do with slavery then why sign or support the 13th amendment at all?  https://t.co/RJ37dzKfBy
1320488335211515904 2020-10-26 06:12:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey Actually the north fought with the south over states rights. Do you know why they wanted states rights? It’s was the loophole democrats figured they could use to keep their slaves.   To claim the civil war had nothing to do with slaves then why kill Lincoln over it?
1320484085668573185 2020-10-26 05:55:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Thats 200 people? 🤔
1320483696525205504 2020-10-26 05:53:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mrscorie @dpconservative @BGOnTheScene Social distancing because there’s NO ONE THERE!   No one fkin social distanced during protests, but yea that’s different. 🙄  https://t.co/1coyVXGhYw
1320483139760779265 2020-10-26 05:51:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkBankey So why are you against a man picking a fight with slave owners again?
1320482358563270656 2020-10-26 05:48:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AOC is a liar. Didn’t she push for ppl to vote by mail for months and then she goes and votes in person? How tf are their long wait lines when ppl are voting by mail?
1320481153363578882 2020-10-26 05:43:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 It happens. lol
1320481067644506112 2020-10-26 05:43:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gertlea @jkcarnah So do you care to post this evidence since you located it? Can we at least confirm it’s the same person or do you normally like to sh*t on the dead because they support the president and you don’t?
1320479397611069440 2020-10-26 05:36:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RobinSueWho Lol. Not Josh he was birthed by a queen.
1320479142219898881 2020-10-26 05:35:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoshD0110 Looks like an image from Hoarders when they open up a cupboard of old food.
1320478470464364545 2020-10-26 05:32:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The ppl who got tickets are lost?
1320478088136806400 2020-10-26 05:31:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Clearly Josh is a poet..
1320477467904126976 2020-10-26 05:28:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump gave the media something to talk about and vilify for 4 yrs. If the MSM continues to avoid the news they will become irrelevant.
1320475122990338048 2020-10-26 05:19:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine a man picking a fight with slave owners and now criticizing that.

1320458883991625728 2020-10-26 04:15:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How hard was it for you to vote in your zip code?
1320457996996993025 2020-10-26 04:11:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HonestAbeLunt Told you you’d have fun!! 😂
1320456340158869504 2020-10-26 04:04:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats      Vs      Democrats  https://t.co/XIp4qnXPTg
1320454214049427456 2020-10-26 03:56:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Nope.
1320454093186371584 2020-10-26 03:56:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Typical of Andy Tifa to hit someone and run like a beeotch.
1320453518633758720 2020-10-26 03:53:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @bettygirl1239 @jadedcreative Does your dad hate you and think it’s a bitter pill for him to swallow knowing you are for voting for Biden and watching CNN and MSNBC?   Of course not because he’s not a hateful pos like you are.   The hell is wrong with you leftists?
1320450254248923137 2020-10-26 03:40:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jazonuxlay Because Cuomo is a Nazi.
1320450142638542849 2020-10-26 03:40:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @funmanjon They actually did their jobs.
1320449915793764352 2020-10-26 03:39:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck I kept rewinding. 😂
1320449778229018624 2020-10-26 03:38:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 These Nazis are literally yelling “We don’t want you here” at Jews!! You can’t make this sh*t up.
1320447957167005696 2020-10-26 03:31:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nazi fascists assaulting Jews. Don’t ever try to tell me leftist fascism isn’t a thing.
1320446643691372544 2020-10-26 03:26:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @Soma @OoALLEYoO @Timcast They deal in emotions, it’s why they are NOT rational at all.   They just say crazy things hoping to get others to succumb to their emotional side as well.   Ex:   Trump put kids in cages!! - not true Trump is a racist!! - not true  Trump is a pos!! - all emotional tripe.
1320441090072215552 2020-10-26 03:04:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @fxlr1994 It’s horrible isn’t it? Imagine the threats:   “We just can’t visit you dad no matter if your dying. I mean you voted for Trump! That’s just unforgivable! Unless you vote for Biden this year!”
1320437721324683264 2020-10-26 02:50:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma @OoALLEYoO @Timcast Calm down TDS Karen. Your emotions don’t trump facts..   Tell me apocalyptic leftist has Trump started any wars in 4 yrs? While you all cried he would?   Has Trump signed more peace deals in the Middle East than any other president instead?
1320437068426670080 2020-10-26 02:48:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma @Timcast Trump isn’t polarizing. It’s YOUR reaction to Trump winning and ppl supporting him that’s polarizing.   When have you ever been called a racist or white supremacist for supporting a US president?   It’s the bully tactics from the left that have polarized this country.
1320435501405360129 2020-10-26 02:42:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> According to leftists and pro abortionists Emiliana wasn’t a life at 30 weeks “just a clump of cells” and could have been aborted.     https://t.co/DhqMZYuDMG
1320434202915995649 2020-10-26 02:37:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CwazupJ @bankrizzle What did he do? I mean I’m sure you can list that sh*t since it’s “plenty”.    Go ahead..
1320433932681187328 2020-10-26 02:35:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You have no idea how pleased I am about this nomination. After seeing her speak at the hearing and the commendations she got from ppl who know her personally, she’s going to be amazing.  https://t.co/MGNnkRjINS
1320432836428533762 2020-10-26 02:31:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Another one... #Trump2020 🇺🇸
1320432535030034432 2020-10-26 02:30:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You aren’t the only one..
1320431592154689536 2020-10-26 02:26:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sounds like another case of the rules are for thee not for me!! Leftists hate when they get caught up in their own bullsh*t rules.
1320429737508888581 2020-10-26 02:19:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So I over heard ppl talking about the election:   Them: Biden is pretty lame and I don’t like Trump.   Me: Look it’s really just about this.. Do you want your taxes increased or not?   Them: Yea I don’t care if someone doesn’t like me just don’t mess w/my money.
1320426297462407169 2020-10-26 02:05:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Aye Dios.. 😳
1320426133045735425 2020-10-26 02:04:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HonestAbeLunt What an awesome stepson you are. Enjoy the rally!! Gonna be the best time you ever had after church watch. 😂
1320425309078835202 2020-10-26 02:01:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sarah isn’t wrong here. When I started changing my mind on Trump I was immediately ostracized by the left. I was never treated that way by anyone on the right. Even tho the right isn’t the “dark side” or a “neo nazi” group they welcomed me when the left wouldn’t.
1320423446807867392 2020-10-26 01:54:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whole_9_meters @LostJavaCat You can use it for YOUR chapstick.

1320417338752036864 2020-10-26 01:30:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is the most disturbing thing I’ve ever seen. To think a dying man was being manipulated by his leftist daughters to VOTE how they want before he dies. Fkin sick.
1320244808091226113 2020-10-25 14:04:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s a VIRUS ppl can test positive and NOT DIE!! Trump is evidence of that.  https://t.co/4LSZaRJGyW
1320244255881744387 2020-10-25 14:02:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like you misrepresented the article. Polling places should be apolitical and there were concerns that it couldn’t be with a BLM sign out front as well as potentially NOT being available during voting season if NBA games were in full swing. So NO it’s not suppressing votes.
1320240632875503618 2020-10-25 13:47:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl I’m sure whatever you heard is absolutely true.
1320240492089470978 2020-10-25 13:47:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Elle_Oh_ElIe That’s not a bad thing.
1320239808627625984 2020-10-25 13:44:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @heyrankinboy There’s a video and it involves a glass pipe, lube and feet.
1320233696096440320 2020-10-25 13:20:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Even ppl from a border town? Good grief that’s even worse. That’s truly willful ignorance.
1320233327589085184 2020-10-25 13:18:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes, I’ve seen the Hunter Biden video.. NOT my proudest moment.  https://t.co/UPRrccPcDj

1320231126879752192 2020-10-25 13:10:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl I just couldn’t believe it. I kept asking myself, “Is this a parody?”. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1320230871790579712 2020-10-25 13:09:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They attended a rally. Are they not allowed to have an opinion you bigot?
1320230549357670400 2020-10-25 13:07:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m still in awe over how ignorant the left SJW blue checks are when it comes to the term “coyote” and illegal immigration.   Can we please stop allowing ignorant voters to vote?
1320229785738506240 2020-10-25 13:04:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Littlebugdog1 @mscarasco_live @yashar Sabotage his recovery? Who said he’s recovering? He’s been in hiding.   Again no one in the Biden family has claimed the info isn’t true. They just blame his addiction as an excuse.   What’s dubious is that it happened at all just because the CCP needed some blackmail.
1320228543180095488 2020-10-25 12:59:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r Yep I sure do. Trump didn’t release a tape to try to win an election.   The tape was released because Hunter was high af and didn’t remember he dropped off a laptop and some rouge Chinese wanted to give a FK YOU to CCP.
1320227397665320961 2020-10-25 12:55:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk That’s because I am crazy...
1320226817458909186 2020-10-25 12:52:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PeterVroom1 What kind of monster doxxes NUNS?!
1320226008901971970 2020-10-25 12:49:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Were you concerned when a claim of a tape with Russian women peeing on the president was circulating?   Was that disgusting behavior as well?   When you’re smoking crack you can’t blame other ppl for your private videos coming out. Bet that Billy Bush tape was ok too.
1320224913332948992 2020-10-25 12:45:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why does it have to be 25 bills. Just pass one fkin Bill to get money to the American ppl that’s it!  https://t.co/LUOwpAxiXJ

1320207188858531840 2020-10-25 11:34:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TexasNomad1 I never said he was. You said GOP is net (-) since Trump was elected. When actually GOP made gains and Dems are still negative since Obama.
1320205819237990400 2020-10-25 11:29:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Actually Dems are still negative over all.  https://t.co/BJ58SnVbp0

1320201295232266240 2020-10-25 11:11:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> YOU aren’t safe from Trump he has plenty of supporters in CA even in San Franshithole. Why don’t you clean that place up?  https://t.co/dtPCJNM6e0
1320198412982075394 2020-10-25 11:00:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Calling a rally a super spreader event doesn’t really help. Let me know if you were as outraged and worried for your extended family when ppl were out protesting you leftist hypocrite!  https://t.co/tHOKHChbNq
1320197229122994176 2020-10-25 10:55:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r How can you be so vile to mock ppl who can still manage to have a roof over their head? It’s elitist bs.
1320194849371373568 2020-10-25 10:45:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What kind of pos shames and dehumanizes ppl for not living in a mansion?

1320187418994069505 2020-10-25 10:16:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Isn’t Wall St backing you tho Joe? They are even funding your campaign.  https://t.co/JLgmt5Kqpu

If birth control has all these side affects on women and even cause cancer. I wonder what side affects male hormones have on a female body? Will be interesting to see the long lasting affects it has.

1320166935921741824 2020-10-25 08:54:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ComradeLylith That’s the funniest part to me. Communism claims they are for the ppl yet when shit goes bad the poor and middle class get fked and die in the millions.   Guess they voted for their own demise after they were lied to about how communism would be better for them.  https://t.co/qOydWsv773
1320166119550849025 2020-10-25 08:51:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ComradeLylith So he criticized them? Whoa I’m sure that saved millions of lives. 😂 Funny how he never managed to be without food only the poor and even under communism.
1320164384660844545 2020-10-25 08:44:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ComradeLylith I guess when they were lied to and told how they would have more freedom under communism, they didn’t realize it was a lie until it was  too late and they were consuming the dead and pets to stay alive.
1320163866668457986 2020-10-25 08:42:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ComradeLylith The famines didn’t stop they happened under Stalin too in the 1930s. He was also a communist why don’t you know this? Why do you ignore the millions that died under their rule. The commies killed more ppl than fascist Hitler ever did.    https://t.co/7oOMNKgTEr
1320163025693728769 2020-10-25 08:39:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nothing shes ruled on has been racist or misogynistic. You need to educate yourself on her rulings you clearly don’t know wtf you’re talking about.

1320161852509188098 2020-10-25 08:34:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ComradeLylith Guess who came to their rescue? The US.. not sure why ppl aren’t taught the horrors ppl suffered under communism while claiming to be proud of being a communist.    https://t.co/3xKLvpdHIa

1320157690434207744 2020-10-25 08:18:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ComradeLylith “Russian communist revolutionary Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, better known as Lenin, had been in charge of the country since 1917. In a chilling disregard for the suffering of his fellow countrymen he instructed food to be seized from the poor.”   They were free to seize food.

1320150694410682368 2020-10-25 07:50:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Just like during slave times the white wives would tell the male slaves how they needed to act in order to give them “another spin”. Then they’d  claim rape when their husbands found out.
1320147798193434624 2020-10-25 07:38:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t know why Joe keeps claiming Trump isn’t going to help blue states, he has helped CALIFORNIA tremendously over the last 4 yrs.

1320096446964641793 2020-10-25 04:14:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Omg YESSSSSSSSS!
1320096337619111936 2020-10-25 04:14:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Just because they look like me don’t mean they have our best interest at heart” 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
1320094905620860928 2020-10-25 04:08:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump supporters are so much happier. 🇺🇸
1320094203104292864 2020-10-25 04:05:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “As well as those chumps with the microphone out there.” - @JoeBiden
1320092405576523777 2020-10-25 03:58:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HoaxBuster6 I’m not sure how much confidence I have in polls at this point but this one looks particularly good.
1320091721019973632 2020-10-25 03:56:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not sure it was a good idea for (R) Collins and Loeffler to split the vote here.
1320091325593649152 2020-10-25 03:54:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lookin good West Virginia..

1320088228225904641 2020-10-25 03:42:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dusm1811 I’m surprised every damn day.
1320065654657970177 2020-10-25 02:12:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hyacinthgrrl Yours looks better. ♥️
1320048907552894976 2020-10-25 01:05:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why do ppl say stupid shit so early in the fkin day? Here I thought it took some time to get to these levels of stupidity.  https://t.co/V9vNbb1DvP
1320047180481138688 2020-10-25 00:59:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HelpfulHoe @MSNBC “iTs a pAtRiaRcHaL pRoBleM” but let me kiss this evil MAN in my avi to prove the point that I’m a just another dumb ignorant beeeeeeoootcchhhhhhh.
1320045931367071744 2020-10-25 00:54:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This should be easy for the sane..
1320045754686132224 2020-10-25 00:53:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @comradeboleslaw It’s not tho..  https://t.co/RcX1r9ErYA
1319917057245233152 2020-10-24 16:22:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s particularly because of the trade deal Trump made with China in Jan 2020. #ThankYouTrump 🇺🇸  https://t.co/hXE7t3aEkN
1319910680552562688 2020-10-24 15:56:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh Again making fun of a serious accusation just makes you look ridiculous.
1319910249743089665 2020-10-24 15:55:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t think you know what Streisand affect means even after you asked Siri. Streisand affect happened after Twitter decided to block the New York Post Article on Hunter on their site.
1319909832875360256 2020-10-24 15:53:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea thanks for pointing out under De Blasio and Cuomo’s leadership 33,366 New Yorkers died.
1319908707749122048 2020-10-24 15:48:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh Not sure how creating a fake document helps your credibility at all.
1319908451426840576 2020-10-24 15:47:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cathypatd @Sethrogen @cryborg @GOP But I thought we’ve already been to the moon in 1969. So why don’t we have the tech to do it again 51 yrs later with all our advancements?
1319907101712343040 2020-10-24 15:42:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Dems are something else.
1319905749028401152 2020-10-24 15:37:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh Well you surely are defending him for not being a supporter.   I’m not sure how anything you provided is proof she’s a con artist.
1319905478588002304 2020-10-24 15:36:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tell me is it as degrading as being called YT? Fkin clown ass mfkers.
1319900142477033472 2020-10-24 15:14:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh Well when you are in a “protected” situation it makes a lot of sense.   Do you often just make up things to protect ppl like Biden on sexual assault charges?
1319899616884649984 2020-10-24 15:12:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh Do you see it’s in quotes? That means someone claimed that. If it was the school why not come out again confirming it after she provided the copies? Instead they refused to respond.
1319899239422455808 2020-10-24 15:11:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh Then the judge probably has some explaining to do since they had to verify the credentials before she was allowed to testify as an “expert”.
1319897453865304066 2020-10-24 15:04:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh  https://t.co/U3yUH76jRa
1319897447171158017 2020-10-24 15:04:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh Do you even read these articles?  https://t.co/msjkn6m9Tc
1319896507387031557 2020-10-24 15:00:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh It also says this in the article.. she provided proof and now the school declined further comment. Weird considering the school was ready to give out her information before so freely.  https://t.co/oAlSsGT0sn
1319895319476277249 2020-10-24 14:55:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @austinsfsh according to the previous article it said she was in a “protected program” so how would someone get her transcripts on whether she earned a degree when we couldn’t even see Obama’s?   Why would a school spokes person need to talk about Reade?
1319888177847414785 2020-10-24 14:27:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Calm down resister. Didn’t y’all discredit Tara Reade as a liar you #metoo hypocrites?
1319773017950408704 2020-10-24 06:49:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you need all this for COVID then you have more issues then we originally thought.
1319768064682934272 2020-10-24 06:30:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fangs..  https://t.co/SrueudzXmy

1319767073703161857 2020-10-24 06:26:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> YouTube why you gotta put this in my recommend videos.. 😩  https://t.co/JrdKNuySIw
1319757574909038592 2020-10-24 05:48:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NotHeraclitus It’s the deflect ability most brain dead leftists have. They know Trump wasn’t referring to immigrant parents looking for asylum but he has to make ppl believe that’s what he meant.
1319756868537909248 2020-10-24 05:45:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco I know I haven’t. Imagine having to say this at a confirmation hearing? I fkin hate these ppl. They are fkin evil.  https://t.co/f0N3CzN16J

1319755324270678016 2020-10-24 05:39:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> NOT all ppl who use children as a HUMAN PASSPORT to get into the US are their parents.  https://t.co/pIeBFyIoyt
1319754317037854720 2020-10-24 05:35:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 She’s more than qualified and it pisses me off that men and women are attacking her for being qualified because she vote politicize the court.  https://t.co/HWNAwXNtIM

1319751148945899520 2020-10-24 05:22:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dusm1811 Im not sure if Collins holds, but she’s really the only one I’m worried about.
1319750798746644482 2020-10-24 05:21:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Men kindly stfu and stop telling women what you think they should do when it comes to decency and getting nominated for powerful positions.

1319747547313754112 2020-10-24 05:08:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Voting is part of your fkin job Chuck!
1319747331298738177 2020-10-24 05:07:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 💀 Damn Q.
1319746882176864256 2020-10-24 05:05:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @asquared_212 @CillizzaCNN We don’t have TDS and view things with hate in our hearts.
1319731811484749824 2020-10-24 04:05:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes because movies are never edited to portray something the director wants to make a buck.
1319723875035328512 2020-10-24 03:34:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So what do y’all think of flips in the senate? I think Doug Jones loses his seat.  https://t.co/Qeui8YYYof
1319722292067266560 2020-10-24 03:28:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 Lol. Goodness.
1319722205601697792 2020-10-24 03:27:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When it comes to polls it’s an average of all polls that determine the approval rating..   When you have polls this far off (34 to 61) they distort the total average. If the overall average didn’t include these the presidents numbers would be so much higher.  https://t.co/8hJkPAuIg7
1319721136200974336 2020-10-24 03:23:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Translation: What Biden has said several times is just NOT what he meant exactly. The campaign knows he messed up so they are going to clarify so Biden doesn’t lose voters.   *but we will eliminate fracking completely after Biden wins because it pollutes.  https://t.co/rAuqKMrVZ5
1319719987251064832 2020-10-24 03:18:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Klingenlaufer Yep I had to change the channel.
1319719092417253381 2020-10-24 03:15:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden has to stick to COVID and fear mongering because all his policies suck.   Let’s be honest Biden would have been so concerned with seeming racist or xenophobic that he wouldn’t have closed the country down to travel but would have locked down Americans with no problem.
1319718507601227776 2020-10-24 03:13:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How can you require quorum when you didn’t even show up to vote yesterday? Evidence you wanted no part in the process.
1319717663837310976 2020-10-24 03:09:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PerseusMeta @Breaking911 They are nice and will end when he gets out of office with someone like Biden at the helm giving IRAN money like Obama did. Iran is banking on it.
1319717193437696001 2020-10-24 03:07:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden: Masks save lives period!   The truth: It can help slow the spread it doesn’t STOP it.  https://t.co/2RQRxkF8FA
1319715883988598784 2020-10-24 03:02:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeBiden is babbling again.. we don’t live in fear of Trump we live in fear of someone like you dragging us back into an economy worse than Obama’s with your fkin policies.
1319715307443818496 2020-10-24 03:00:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @golftecsully @SJPFISH Sorry but being called disgusting doesn’t warrant spitting on someone ever especially during a pandemic.
1319714309501456385 2020-10-24 02:56:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha
1319713577964503040 2020-10-24 02:53:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lodov2417 Not with leftist lunatics out there. I remember when they doxxed and threatened @RealMiniAOC
1319712934306615296 2020-10-24 02:50:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lodov2417 Because we all know protecting the identity of children is just wrong. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1319712737732161536 2020-10-24 02:50:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So no one was killed, but Hunter is being charged for allegedly firing on a precinct that was abandoned and set on fire by protestors?  https://t.co/czb8HAGiVn

1319710149615906816 2020-10-24 02:39:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie Haha YOURE 16! Holy sh*t. Yea I shoulda checked that before engaging with CHILDREN.
1319709918081863680 2020-10-24 02:38:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie So you didn’t mute? 😂 Why am I not surprised?
1319709762456416258 2020-10-24 02:38:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie I doubt that..why are you stalking my page? Thought you were done?

1319707977142599680 2020-10-24 02:31:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens Yes because an LGBT link has no need to make you FEEL better about the disconnect from YOUR own reality. 😂

So if it’s none of your business or mine then how would you ever really know?   What if I said I was Trans is that all I need to be included?
1319704476895244289 2020-10-24 02:17:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens Educating people is NEVER a waste of someone’s life.

1319703283682799616 2020-10-24 02:12:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HurricaneA3 Lmaooo. It was only valid in that one minute when it says what I need to say.
1319703098164531200 2020-10-24 02:11:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens It’s a fact. If an individual can create a new gender as a social expression then how is it NOT a social construct?
1319702342145458176 2020-10-24 02:08:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 405 votes is all you needed to determine the REAL numbers? 😂

Why not ask if the person had seen a psychiatrist or had been found to be trans medically? It’s because if they FEEL they are that’s all that matters to you.  https://t.co/xalSBJu08R
1319701166607925253 2020-10-24 02:04:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens No. When I said gender was a social construct you claimed I was putting off gender, dismissing it and then made claims about money and traffic lights and not having those things or ignoring them was at my peril.   Looks like you confuse yourself in your madness.

I said gender can not be assigned at birth just SEX. You realize you keep owning yourself on this issue right?  https://t.co/EWIVcyVJRs
1319698831156539392 2020-10-24 01:54:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens The person in the image. They claim they are a trans man. Do you deny their trans reality?
1319698610317975552 2020-10-24 01:54:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens Your sex YOU determined yourself when you used the term TRANS. This is you right?  https://t.co/bFqy5otsfJ
1319697117552627712 2020-10-24 01:48:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens Well I think it’s pretty fkin rich for a trans woman to determine what the measuring stick is for “female”.   That’s obviously misogyny.
1319696567683543040 2020-10-24 01:45:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens Why do you keep avoiding my questions?   Let me make it easier for you. Can females produce sperm?
1319696296693780480 2020-10-24 01:44:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens Again not sure how that helps your argument about “gender” being determined at birth.   It clearly isn’t if there are that many genders and an individual makes that choice. We know a newborn can’t determine their own gender at birth so their SEX is.
1319695702386110465 2020-10-24 01:42:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens ALL people exist with or without money and traffic signals. 😂   Money and traffic signals don’t determine someone’s existence as a human being.

1319693288333479936 2020-10-24 01:32:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens And again you are proving our point about the disconnect with their biological reality being so severe that they require the removal of body parts.
1319692950801010689 2020-10-24 01:31:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens Actually Lily brought it up if you looked at the image they posted which mentioned gender.

How can a doctor determine a gender when it’s on a spectrum? They can’t. They can however determine a SEX which requires visual evidence. If the genitalia is ambiguous then other studies are conducted to determine sex.
1319691047174238213 2020-10-24 01:23:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens I’m not. I’m concerned with your attempt to lie about it tho.

I guess your mind has been very well controlled. I mean it’s radical of me to think the color of toys don’t determine someone’s gender.

1319687527389818880 2020-10-24 01:09:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens This is you right? What real world consequence does it have for you if I say gender is a social construct and others in this thread agree?   I don’t have to validate your existence for YOU to exist.  https://t.co/JvcTrCkKe3
1319686949636980737 2020-10-24 01:07:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens Spectrums are infinite, is that really the rule you want to apply here while demanding we take gender seriously?
1319686558232920064 2020-10-24 01:06:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens I’m curious why breasts have to be removed if males can have breasts too? What socially constructed image (mold) are some ppl trying so hard fit into that they have to remove body parts?   It’s quite sad.
1319685259785453568 2020-10-24 01:00:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens How is it offensive? Are you trying to deny our gender rights as human beings that are non binary?   That’s fkin rich.   FYI intersex folks know what sex they are too.
1319684478764150785 2020-10-24 00:57:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens Exactly so what don’t you understand about gender being a social construct and everyone essentially being non binary?   I was discussing the disconnect between someone’s sex reality vs their gender which can change on a whim.
1319683819050471424 2020-10-24 00:55:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens If a male wants to have their penis removed how is that not a mental issue again?

It’s a biological reality that some women have their breasts removed due to fear of cancer because it’s genetic. That doesn’t make them trans.
1319683052390346752 2020-10-24 00:52:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens I guess Amy is also confused about the possibility of being human as well?   “mY hUmAniTy”

You are assigned a sex because there is an obvious visual determination that can be made. A visual REALITY.   I’m guessing you aren’t intersex either.

Trans is having a disconnect with your biological reality. Which is similar to the reality anorexics deal with.   Sorry dear I don’t need a psychiatrist to validate my own reality.
1319680526484074497 2020-10-24 00:42:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @the_cowens That comes with the fact that dysphoria it’s a psychiatric term. Let’s define psychiatry again.  https://t.co/AHp0hDryrx
1319680015324254208 2020-10-24 00:40:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens You should probably get on the same page as your buddy there.

1319679261037346817 2020-10-24 00:37:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens Exactly. Thanks for proving my point.   Gender is a system, philosophy and movement it’s why the list keeps growing daily.
1319678623259914242 2020-10-24 00:34:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens How is creating 54 genders not a social construct again?   Would love to hear it.
1319678306573193217 2020-10-24 00:33:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens Sure it is.. when you have 54 genders it becomes an -ism.
1319677919170449408 2020-10-24 00:31:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @the_cowens So tell me Lilly if this isn’t a disconnect with your biological reality and you have a lady brain why would you need treatment or a diagnosis by a therapist?   Treatment would mean you’re looking for a cure. What are you wanting to cure?
1319677456865845248 2020-10-24 00:29:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @the_cowens I was arguing that dysphoria is the disconnect between the mind and your reality like anorexia.   And it is a psychiatric definition of dysphoria.   But since a person can just up and claim to be trans without a medical determination you’ve actually...
1319676821885968384 2020-10-24 00:27:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @the_cowens I can not say God doesn’t make mistakes its why we have biological anomalies. Actually TRANS initially required a diagnosis due to the dysphoria now you can just up and claim trans just because you want. Which means there’s no requirement to fall under the TRANS umbrella.
1319676168618921984 2020-10-24 00:24:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens In that case we are all non binary.   Not sure how you can tie gender to any kind of binary when you have 54+ genders.   Feminine and masculine aren’t sexes. There are females who portray masculine qualities that doesn’t change their sex or gender in most cases.
1319674489857216513 2020-10-24 00:18:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens But it is.. I mean if you are truly Trans you’d know that. The prefix itself identifies that disconnect with your own biological reality.
1319673966630301697 2020-10-24 00:16:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @the_cowens Then what are you arguing? The fact that you can make up any gender to make you feel better that doesn’t help your argument. You are proving that it’s basically a creation to appease your own fight with reality.
1319673357164400640 2020-10-24 00:13:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CirqueAmy @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens Actually it’s not. Do you see the term dysphoria is listed under psychiatry?   Shall we define psychiatry?  https://t.co/L6tAipdqKL
1319672917601386496 2020-10-24 00:11:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @the_cowens So then what are you arguing exactly? I stated that. It’s why I said genderism is a social construct and you just proved I was right.
1319672712638259201 2020-10-24 00:11:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @the_cowens You want to prove someone wrong on your sex go have a DNA if you are a healthy male or female. Then that remains, but if you choose a gender to make yourself feel better so be it. It still isn’t your biological reality.
1319672179890376706 2020-10-24 00:09:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ItsMeLillyCutie @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @the_cowens You won’t own me on this subject. That’s why I said biological sex and gender are different. You have limited options with sex because there hasn’t been large groups that stray from the obvious biological reality.   Gender is a social construct just like I stated.
1319671428891852800 2020-10-24 00:06:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 @ItsMeLillyCutie @CirqueAmy @the_cowens Well one of two sexes for sure because even ppl who are intersex have one dominate sex male or female and it’s usually determined by tests. Anomalies really shouldn’t determine what the reality of 99.8% of all human beings are born.
1319670479372783617 2020-10-24 00:02:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 @CirqueAmy @ItsMeLillyCutie @the_cowens Completely agree. If genderism wasn’t a creation by someone’s own self identified dysphoria they would’ve be changing it all the time.   Originally it was I’m trans because I have gender dysphoria and it was diagnosed to now I’m trans because I say so and feel I am.

1319478564597559297 2020-10-23 11:19:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then he probably shouldn’t have starting debating the president as a moderator. Welker remained quiet most of the time and allowed the debate to happen mostly without interruptions. I’m gonna guess the left will be pissed with Welker over it too.
1319474280594173953 2020-10-23 11:02:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden says it and did nothing for the people for 47 yrs. Trump says it and actually does it.

1319464562450595841 2020-10-23 10:24:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M @JoeBiden I saw this when CNN was covering a reuniting of a mother and child in an airport or something. I understood what the child and mother were saying regardless of what CNN was trying to claim. The little boy even said he was given a toy truck as a gift.
1319463931128102912 2020-10-23 10:21:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @btseighthmember @ACTBrigitte If they are oppressed it’s because they live in Democrat run cities.   Democrat cities oppress everyone regardless of skin color.
1319463428650512385 2020-10-23 10:19:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M @JoeBiden They were treated better. The kids when asked how they were treated in the facilities Trump admin put them in they said in Spanish that they were treated well and got to play.   So ppl claiming they were mistreated is not accurate.
1319461240444387330 2020-10-23 10:10:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeBiden would bring back CRITICAL RACE THEORY that’s enough to not want him in office.   #Debates2020
1319461025813458945 2020-10-23 10:09:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M @JoeBiden Children that are separated from their criminal parents is somehow wrong?
1319460781793013760 2020-10-23 10:08:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why should illegals be caught and released into the country in hopes of them showing up to a court?   Thank God catch and release is over.   As a Hispanic I have no problem with ppl seeking asylum in their own country why would anyone want them to risk their lives for asylum?
1319459950226108416 2020-10-23 10:05:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeBiden children were separated by Obama Admin as well and you also have unaccompanied minors that had no parents they came with.   Trump inherited the “cages” from Obama. Catch and release was a huge problem @JoeBiden.
1319456398615277571 2020-10-23 09:51:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So why didnt @JoeBiden suggest Bidencare in his 47 yrs in government?   If ACA can negotiate preexisting conditions so can Trump.
1319455208301187072 2020-10-23 09:46:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh yea Biden hasn’t interrupted at all. 🙄
1319454693068656645 2020-10-23 09:44:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh he used “look” and “malarkey”   Yes Biden is rattled.
1319452808525955073 2020-10-23 09:37:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Since when is it US POLICY to get a ukrainian prosecutor fired @JoeBiden?
1319452434855456768 2020-10-23 09:35:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump has been doing really well. He’s been calm. Joe Biden has already used “c’mon man and look” multiple times.

1319439984860954624 2020-10-23 08:46:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @unashamedusa Oh of course they are. See they are already oppressed and oppressing them more means you’re a racist. So that means they have to be exempt.   This sh*t pisses me off.

1319435718494568448 2020-10-23 08:29:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @atrupar They have a witness who actually came forward to confirm the story.   Unlike all the anonymous sources you people take at face value. 🤷🏻‍♀️  https://t.co/pxznyoGI6d

1319432703767277568 2020-10-23 08:17:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left is desperate for Joe to win so he can continue to hide their crimes.

1319293089467412483 2020-10-22 23:02:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is this like that time Dems said if Trump was elected he would get us into WWIII and it never happened? They try to accomplish their goals with fear tactics.   They predicted an apocalypse that never happened. They’ve lost all credibility. 🖕🏼 Democrats.

Y’all never cared about RBG just that she was your “champion” on the court to get your way.   That’s why going back to a court that doesn’t legislate is best.
1319286446679683079 2020-10-22 22:36:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now reporters can’t even ask questions without the left attacking them for it?   I didn’t see them get this kinda treatment when they claimed things about Trump and Ivanka.  https://t.co/c7yvAax9SK

1319124965451464704 2020-10-22 11:54:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now imagine if this had been flipped some feminist would be crying how this is sexist. Fkin hypocrites.
1319123335322628101 2020-10-22 11:48:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I can’t just retweet anymore it has to be with a comment? This blows.

1319118911778902016 2020-10-22 11:30:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ZamoraCode I’m sad about it. It was tradition to sit and watch them during the holidays.
1319118757910831107 2020-10-22 11:29:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Some have followed me long enough they know I ♥️ rhinos. So thanks for sharing this with me @Ja1Ke3.
1319118084251156480 2020-10-22 11:27:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Iran wants Biden to win because they know that just like Obama, Biden will send them cash and remove sanctions so they can give it to terrorists. #Vote #Trump2020 🇺🇸 #americafirst
1319114945032695808 2020-10-22 11:14:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well this is sad..
1319114194646568960 2020-10-22 11:11:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> God bless President Trump! 🇺🇸
1319112663209684992 2020-10-22 11:05:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you’re ok pushing Iranian and Russian disinformation? The MSM is garbage and truly the enemy of the ppl.
1319109490000551936 2020-10-22 10:53:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are you slow? They said breaking from the FBI you tit.

1319108018106068992 2020-10-22 10:47:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 Hey @ProjectLincoln why did you have to delete that tweet about the Proud Boys? Did you realize that it’s a fkin lie?   Where are you on airing out the Hunter Biden claim?   Oh that’s right fkin crickets from you jackholes.
1319104871727968256 2020-10-22 10:34:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We’re going to see the Hunter video too, sweetie.
1319104352884195329 2020-10-22 10:32:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JackPosobiec Yes the effort of 10 whole ppl listening to you. Congrats.

1319102054225174528 2020-10-22 10:23:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then maybe you should acknowledge that you used your son Hunter for a pay to play scheme while you were VP. The pressure of being your son could have contributed to him being an addict.
1319092199787618304 2020-10-22 09:44:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You thinking ppl care is hilarious.
1319090455607345152 2020-10-22 09:37:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who’s shocked that @BarackObama would come out against Fox News and ppl like Rush Limbaugh while we were denied the ability to view an accusation against Hunter Biden?
1319089927015940096 2020-10-22 09:35:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Obama is a divisive pos and of course he has to push off claims about a corrupt government he was actually the head of.   We dgaf what Obama says.
1319088684239519744 2020-10-22 09:30:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob I have no clue, but this image is absolutely horrifying.
1319069797418561536 2020-10-22 08:15:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Dear God why? 😩
1319068950999658496 2020-10-22 08:11:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dodd_do I also agree that if you do not have children in the school system that you should get a credit for that on your taxes.   Plenty of ppl out there who have zero children in school so why should we have to pay.   According to the government property taxes help pay for schools.
1319042240199626752 2020-10-22 06:25:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dodd_do Exactly why Trump suggests if parents are paying taxes for education that those parents should have the right to choose the school their child goes to regardless of district lines.   School choice. The money follows the child.
1319041748564283392 2020-10-22 06:23:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dodd_do Yes I’m well aware. So you are suggesting to screw over kids who can’t afford school is that correct?   I’m guessing you have no children or you do but they go to private school correct?   If your children are in public school you are paying teachers to educate them while u work.
1319035119269625856 2020-10-22 05:57:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So then all schools should go private and those that can afford it can have kids in school those who can’t can get fked? Sounds like an awesome solution. 😂

1318999505140809728 2020-10-22 03:36:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So someone working for what they earn makes them a parasite?   What of those actually wanting UBI at the expense of someone else?
1318998672177164290 2020-10-22 03:32:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kimksmells I’m thinking it has to do with the rights of those who are self employed to make decisions on who their clients are and this way not be subject to lawsuits over it.   Just my guess tho. As we know how often ppl are sued for claims of discrimination.
1318998217787203585 2020-10-22 03:30:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mazage6 When you’re right of Stalin then everything is right.. 🤣
1318968213632208897 2020-10-22 01:31:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TexasTribune All this prevents is some crazy leftist from trying to sue because some SW didn’t want them to be a client so they’ll accuse the person of being discriminatory.   Leftists are a fkin plague.
1318967496032964608 2020-10-22 01:28:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TexasTribune Social workers should have the right as a private practice to turn away anyone they want on whatever basis. To make this out to be some crazy idea is hilarious.   They aren’t employers. I don’t see how this affects anyone as most already have their established clientele.
1318966639677730820 2020-10-22 01:25:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m guessing this isn’t the whole story.
1318964592412741632 2020-10-22 01:17:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JacksonAntione @GeraltofPDX1 @Lodov2417 You’re so well trained look at you calling Trump rallies “super spreaders” while ppl had been rioting for 3 fkin months not social distancing and not wearing masks.   What a good little ignorant leftist.  https://t.co/wQaJY6V9se
1318963281218789376 2020-10-22 01:12:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mazage6 Awww you’re dumber than I thought. Where do you think the propaganda comes from? Democrats *ARE* left not as left as commies would like but left none the less.  https://t.co/iy5tfbGr7u
1318926741298032640 2020-10-21 22:46:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If this is the case this means Trump has made gains among the black community. Remember 2016 polls claimed Trump had only 2% of the black vote. He ended up with 6% total per Pew. This seems more significant.   https://t.co/V1KjOcOPyv
1318925684916457472 2020-10-21 22:42:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @35Leosa Joe is a national security issue.
1318920425976471553 2020-10-21 22:21:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yep the propaganda is all from the left, the narcissistic establishment they support and the complicit media who has no issue running with the lies. They claimed Trump was a Russian asset for 4 yrs with no evidence but will remove articles talking about Hunter Biden.  https://t.co/TIzLFfGHnw

1318788888295399424 2020-10-21 13:39:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Asking for an investigation for accusations of pay to play by Biden is not out of the ordinary. They had an investigation with a hell of a lot less evidence on Trump.

1318761124775436288 2020-10-21 11:48:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because they been watching the lying MSM for 4 fkin years. Before COVID we were all the way up!    https://t.co/99NHyIjLt7

Funny you can make a claim yet no evidence to back it up.. you go off on some other tangent.   Funding our military doesn’t mean spending more on wars that preceded his presidency. 😂
1318634254843215872 2020-10-21 03:24:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @byvangriffin Well you would be mistaken. I’m a former Hillary voter. I’m voting for Trump in 2020.   Biden has done less in 47 yrs in politics than Trump has done in 4.   Maybe you should look things up.   This LATINA is voting for Trump!    https://t.co/xt5UnimeBx

1318633522584670208 2020-10-21 03:21:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @byvangriffin Why do you think Trump went into politics? 😂  So corrupt establishment politicians couldn’t get away with the corruption anymore while destroying our country.   If you think the left is on your side they aren’t they just want power. I should know I was formerly on the left.

1318624002902958080 2020-10-21 02:43:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @redezrobbins @icecube Clearly that wasn’t his experience since Trump admin took the time to listen while the Biden camp didn’t.   Those are just the facts.   Dems don’t need to do anything for the black vote and never have.

1318581452674461697 2020-10-20 23:54:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @byvangriffin FYI no one is making you defend anyone. You do it because you want to. You aren’t changing any minds here so why you do it is beyond me.   Maybe YOU should be a politician. Obviously you can be made to defend anything just as long as it sounds good.  https://t.co/qFnQ4Hu4lS
1318580924817158145 2020-10-20 23:52:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @byvangriffin Well you don’t have to like Biden or Trump. I care about policies in place. Trump unlike Biden has done a lot of what he promised he would do.   That’s all I truly care about. Plus Biden is a true politician he just says what you like to hear and does something else. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1318566868156776448 2020-10-20 22:56:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @byvangriffin Obviously you’ve never heard of how debates work.   During the Dem debates they did the same but no rule changes.   They did this for one reason only to try prevent Trump from asking about Hunter.
1318565635631108096 2020-10-20 22:51:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We don’t care who you deep state sh*ts vote for. You want the country to go to hell.
1318565243153387520 2020-10-20 22:50:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It *IS* criminal. It’s also criminal to claim Trump was colluding with Russians for 4 fking years Kyle.
1318564901992894468 2020-10-20 22:49:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> A story of the dubious double standard by social media and the msm. Why wasn’t the @BuzzFeed article blocked?

1318398337020669952 2020-10-20 11:47:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoo you’re full of sh*t. If CA which is my state was so fking rich they wouldn’t be begging ppl to come back and not leave the state while also begging the federal government for money. Blue states are fkin broke. Not to mention destroyed by leftists during BLM riots.
1318397739349069829 2020-10-20 11:44:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @David_Leavitt @50cent Why are you a racist bigot David?   Why don’t you just give 62% of your earnings to ppl now David you selfish pos?

1318379457560731648 2020-10-20 10:32:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And these thots still wanna blame men for unwanted pregnancies. 🙄Men do better on choosing who you put your magic stick in.  https://t.co/JpkDPqaAK8

1318271094852177920 2020-10-20 03:21:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tina_Boz0820 Yea never go ass to mouth it’s unsanitary. Although I won’t link shame. 😂
1318256947959713792 2020-10-20 02:25:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well women have choices too. You can give a blow job or take it in the ass, both have absolutely ZERO chance of pregnancy.
1318246044635783170 2020-10-20 01:42:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion Lmaoo.
1318205224561963009 2020-10-19 22:59:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JohnnyBananas79 Men need to stop providing the gift of life to these women. Wear condoms for your own protection. Women be fkin crazy these days.   They have no issue spreading their legs but if they get pregnant it’s YOUR FAULT!   Imagine impregnating someone that thinks like this?
1318204478680518656 2020-10-19 22:56:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> As I’ve stated before MEN if you are the ones 100% responsible for pregnancies don’t allow these women easy access to YOUR gift. Fk them and protect yourself. Before you know they’ll be trying to get pregnant AND threaten you some bullsh*t rape allegation.
1318202794172682240 2020-10-19 22:50:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe stop/prevent entry to your reproductive cave and unwanted pregnancies wouldn’t happen.   Claiming men are 100% responsible is ridiculous. I’m a woman I can get pregnant. If a man ejaculates that doesn’t mean BOOM insta pregnant. Pregnancies are 100% preventable.

If you continue to call someone a white supremacist and racist is that hateful and divisive?   When you tell ppl republicans will put them back in chains is that fear mongering?   Yes or No?

Did they have a relationship prior to being hired at Dalton after Donald Barr had left in June 1954?   Epstein was 21 when he got hired at Dalton. So how long had Barr known him?
1317981859955974144 2020-10-19 08:12:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When leftists think that Californians aren’t excited about seeing this president. I give you this. 🇺🇸 No way this kinda showing happens for Biden or Harris who’s one of our Senators.   https://t.co/BnlIxeA2ex

1317860243838103552 2020-10-19 00:09:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jaketapper that is the most disingenuous question ever! How many children do you think are watching Laura Trump speak at a conference about Trump or your clips on CNN? 😂 GTFOH.  https://t.co/SYvCElifeV
1317721082825093120 2020-10-18 14:56:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When leftists lose this election I’d like to remind them it was demonizing ppl like this that did it.
1317720831720452103 2020-10-18 14:55:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You’ve obviously learned nothing about cults. Trump isn’t a Scientologist, but then again I should remind you that Satanists support Biden and I’m sure that’s fine.
1317720402148302848 2020-10-18 14:53:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 🙄 And this is exactly why ppl leave the left they just can’t help but insult ppl who don’t agree with them. That’s cultish.

1317633232565800960 2020-10-18 09:06:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead Of course it wouldn’t matter. I’m sure the black ppl in front of you somehow still had to wait longer. It’s only logical with this voter suppression and systemic racism working against them.
1317632833972625408 2020-10-18 09:05:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoo now they are begging for the votes of the same ppl they call racist, uneducated and white supremacists. That’s fkin rich. 😂 You worried Steve?

1317628406033391616 2020-10-18 08:47:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> • 3/2/20 - 16 cases confirmed in the US  • 3/12/20 - Trump suspends travel from Europe  • 3/12/20 - 405 total cases reported by CDC  • 3/25/20 - like clockwork Dems use COVID for their own wishlist.

I think he’s looking into it and just waiting to provide the facts although it doesn’t really matter to the leftists with TDS. I just think he wants to be sure before he comes out and speaks on it.   You know all his 🦆 🦆 in a row
1317621311577890816 2020-10-18 08:19:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is how elected democrats who go to a Trump rally are treated.  https://t.co/Yg8tr0VLCX
1317617490898284544 2020-10-18 08:04:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We know it’s not that easy for an AG to come out before everything is confirmed after being pressed by Trump to do so. He can’t show loyalty to the president he has to follow the law. Which I think is fair.

1317597679380099073 2020-10-18 06:45:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Esto es mentira. Si el programa está en bancarrota es porque los demócratas usan dinero que no deben para pagar otras cosas.   Y no olviden que Joe Biden tuvo 47 años para hacer algo y no hizo in madre.  https://t.co/fz2CoXMSNi
1317592715463258112 2020-10-18 06:25:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Troy75801 CNN because he has to hide his true identity. 😂

1317592418359783424 2020-10-18 06:24:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wtf?! Fkin garbage.
1317589976469549057 2020-10-18 06:15:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you believe “infants” were placed in cages. You are fkin mental.
1317589663897407488 2020-10-18 06:13:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait Joe do you have evidence of these rapes and assaults by Trump?   As I recall Joe Biden also has a sexual assault accusation against him from Tara Reade with more evidence then any of the Trump accusers had.   This is libel.
1317588950047805440 2020-10-18 06:10:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk What is it?
1317588756086444032 2020-10-18 06:10:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> STOP protecting this mayors home.
1317588384311697414 2020-10-18 06:08:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m soooo glad I’m no longer a part of this fkin leftist insanity. #walkaway from these fear mongers.
1317587906735661056 2020-10-18 06:06:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You love insanity and fear mongering?

1317586948140093440 2020-10-18 06:03:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So the Biden story gets blocked and ppl get suspended, but trash libelist slander like this can circulate with no issue @Twitter?  https://t.co/qsnOdpOKSg
1317586322261831681 2020-10-18 06:00:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like a superspreader event.
1317584072542101505 2020-10-18 05:51:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Those damn climate change radicals.

1317583014864433153 2020-10-18 05:47:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 Right? So this shit about Biden is propaganda but the Russian dossier about Trump was legit? 🙄
1317582753655779329 2020-10-18 05:46:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BozKuhi @Hung_Hippo @EddieZipperer @EWErickson Trump danced while Obama sold us out. Gave Iran money that later was determined to have gone to terrorists. So basically Obama funded terrorism with US tax payer DOLLARS.    https://t.co/wbfZr5Thev

Tell me how corrupt it is to give Iran $400M in cash in different currencies so you don’t violate any US federal laws as well as access to another $5.7B that was locked up under sanctions via our financial system.  https://t.co/iGUfiELwWI
1317578907512569856 2020-10-18 05:31:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Troy75801 @RealBrandonDonk I figure they’re like another vehicle on the road and then they zip right between two cars.  https://t.co/fvQs8iHgc7
1317578553374863360 2020-10-18 05:29:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is it like the Hillary smear campaign? Hillary never denied the emails released by Wikileaks. She also made sure to destroy her server and phones with hammers. So wtf are you even talking about?
1317578073777131521 2020-10-18 05:27:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 *raises hand* Can we also make a law that doesn’t allow these biker folks to swerve in between cars?   I hate that shit!

1317572131799003136 2020-10-18 05:04:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because that’s all you’ve EVER BEEN for democrats. A guaranteed voting block that they don’t need to do shit for to get your vote.

These are CHILDREN being used as political pawns. It’s fkin disgusting.   Kids can’t even be kids anymore.

1317520733728206848 2020-10-18 01:39:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Almost 93k votes and... why does this seem more accurate than any actual polls? I’m surprised there are still this many Trump supporters on twitter considering they get suspended for posting videos of things Biden says. The left pissed they couldn’t stop it sooner.  https://t.co/HF7hfXOtZq
1317519796506824704 2020-10-18 01:36:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When Joe Biden switches his stance to.. I’m gonna get rid of “most” of the tax cuts..and my tax cuts are only going to affect those who make more than $400k he’s fkin lying.  https://t.co/FV331y5BeE
1317519239574478850 2020-10-18 01:33:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then you probably shouldn’t have voted for the guy that said these things then.. 🤷🏻‍♀️  https://t.co/Xu4ywjM3ab

1317506867480858625 2020-10-18 00:44:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fact checking the fact checker in 2 parts:   A.) Biden said he would get rid of Trump tax cuts on day one.  B.) Trump tax cuts benefited 82% of Americans according to the data.  https://t.co/KGQ9ZpSMMi

1317500013350588418 2020-10-18 00:17:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So where’s the disinformation? Are those not Hunter Bidens images, video or emails? Was Hunter not paid by Burisma and Chinese companies?   Why was Hunter Biden working for a company who’s owner was friends with “Pro-Russian” Ukrainian President Yanukovych who fled to Russia?  https://t.co/n2cyqIlcdl
1317498251294044160 2020-10-18 00:10:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kach022 @PEYESTRO You most certainly aren’t.
1317498185242169344 2020-10-18 00:10:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @kach022 You don’t break up any claimed “echo chambers” when you denigrate others as “horrible and/or stupid” because they don’t agree with you or your conspiracy theories.   Maybe take a look at the echo chamber you are in that makes you lash out and insult ppl you don’t know.
1317497350588227585 2020-10-18 00:07:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No one said they did. The Trump tax cuts benefited 82% of Americans which Biden said he would get rid of day one.   This is from the Washington post. Keep posting the lie though. Some of us aren’t brainwashed jackholes.  https://t.co/2V7lW0E9p6
1317494217820704774 2020-10-17 23:54:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Mrnotthatfamous It’s not a lie. You simpletons just don’t get that when Biden says he’s going to get rid of the Trump tax cuts on day one that affects 82% of Americans.
1317493945706844160 2020-10-17 23:53:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s also a fact that @JoeBiden said he would get rid of the Trump tax cuts that benefit 82% of Americans.
1317493718111285248 2020-10-17 23:52:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 82% of Americans benefit from the Trump tax cuts which Biden has said he would get rid off on day one!   Tell me what Biden did for YOUR taxes during Obama? Don’t worry I’ll wait.

1317492391960473601 2020-10-17 23:47:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine using Russia as a scapegoat every time you or your fellow leftists are caught doing some crooked shit.  *caught doing crack*  *caught taking bribes* *caught in bed with underage girls*  The left: The Russians are doing all of this!!! 😩  https://t.co/HH62aeFH9I

1317486669990252545 2020-10-17 23:24:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why are ppl like Chris Murphy trying to wash away everything Hunter Biden has done as Russian propaganda? Propaganda suggests something is fake. Joe Biden has not suggested this isn’t Hunter’s email, his video or images.
1317485336709115907 2020-10-17 23:19:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Since when do Russians post pictures &amp; 12 min videos on private laptops going in for repairs as propaganda? If the FBI has had this hard drive for a year why wasn’t it known? If Russians had this kind of intel they’d be saving it to blackmail Biden if he got elected.

You want to get the biggest fish you can. You might not like what happened but ultimately being on that predators list is what got him caught and in jail.

1317303068854087680 2020-10-17 11:15:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @kach022 @Ja1Ke3 It was at the state level. Of course if you are trying to get a sexual predator like Epstein to commit to being on the sexual predators list you have to make certain deals.   Epstein wasn’t stupid. His chances of getting off at the state level with the ppl he knew was high.
1317302364613718017 2020-10-17 11:12:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @Ja1Ke3 @Wookiee931 @ComfortablySmug @HillaryClinton I do not see it in the archives listed here. I guess the only other way to get to the archives is to request them from the archivist.    https://t.co/ChWy4SvTBK
1317301146541715456 2020-10-17 11:07:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @kach022 @Ja1Ke3 Being put on the sexual predators list is a federal listing. Meaning if he continued his crimes anywhere in the country he could be charged FEDERALLY. The goal was to get Epstein on that list so he couldn’t get away with it again, if caught.  https://t.co/VaG6Q4ysCj
1317300448890560512 2020-10-17 11:04:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @kach022 @Ja1Ke3 You clearly don’t understand how the law works. Alex Acosta was attempting to get Epstein to agree to being put on the sexual predators list which he wouldn’t get if the case went to court and his victims failed to testify or were shamed and he got off.  https://t.co/IK3hRy9SWk
1317298209157378049 2020-10-17 10:55:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @Ja1Ke3 @Wookiee931 @ComfortablySmug @HillaryClinton You know what I find rather interesting is that if you look up dalton archives of board members in 1974 that particular archive is missing. There is a list of board attendees from 1974 but if you didn’t attend I’m guessing you wouldn’t be on there.
1317296861200277504 2020-10-17 10:50:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @Ja1Ke3 @Wookiee931 @ComfortablySmug @HillaryClinton Hired after Epstein actually started as a teacher? Why are you assuming it was Barr. He left in June 1974 it took Dalton 7 months to hire a new headmaster. Who would have done the hiring during that time when they had no headmaster? I’m guessing the board does the hiring?  https://t.co/5oKVaVnGYA
1317291942984601600 2020-10-17 10:30:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @Ja1Ke3 @Wookiee931 @ComfortablySmug @HillaryClinton Again there’s no evidence that he hired or had anything to do with hiring Epstein. He was on his way out as of February 1974 and he left officially in June 1974.   So your proof is that Epstein was working at dalton in 1974 and Donald Barr wrote a book in 1973?
1317290802532425728 2020-10-17 10:26:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PEYESTRO @oktrainwreck @Ja1Ke3 @Wookiee931 @ComfortablySmug @HillaryClinton That book was published in Sept 1973. Which means it was being written long before Epstein was hired at Dalton in 1974. So again I ask what actual proof do you have of your claim that Barr was connected to pedophile Epstein?  https://t.co/kESJqS1CU2

Barr was “alleged” to have had a role. Nothing concrete about him actually hiring him per the NYT. Also Barr resigned in June of 1974.   I hate to prove you wrong, but then again you asked for it.  https://t.co/NSY9RtQtia

Or was that too complicated a question for you?  See here little buddy when I make a claim I provide the sources and links. That’s what grown ups who don’t speak out of their ass do.   Now you gonna provide those or not?
1317272011689713664 2020-10-17 09:11:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NotHeraclitus Agreed we need good teachers who are about teaching curriculum not creating and indoctrinating little activists on our tax dollars.

So my sisters cousins brother hooked up with the football guy that’s related to that girl with the bum leg who’s sister works at hotdog on a stick who’s boss’s wife had an affair with the neighbor that lives down the street. That’s how I found out.

1317257407483949059 2020-10-17 08:13:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The legality of allowing undocumented immigrants to count on the census is exactly why you have Dem run states pushing for “sanctuary cities”. They want to be able to import as many ppl as they want illegally then get to add senate and house seats because of it.

1317208004773572608 2020-10-17 04:57:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ginger_Snap_11 The problem is the law that congress passes isn’t supported by our constitutional freedoms.   This is why laws are challenged in court.   Like wanting to remove our 2nd amendment isn’t constitutional.   But if congress was controlled by democrats you bet they’d pass it.

1317202167770406912 2020-10-17 04:34:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> As is your civic right. Try claiming you’re voting for Trump and seeing the response you get.
1317201600130134016 2020-10-17 04:31:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You called Trump a supporter of white supremacy thats race baiting and divisive you pos.   You also said black ppl aren’t black if they don’t vote for you. That’s racist and divisive as well. Wtf are you even saying?!
1317200729405235200 2020-10-17 04:28:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Joe Biden said he would take 1.5T from businesses and give that money to the working class.   How tf will it go to the working class when they won’t have a fkin job if you do this @JoeBiden?
1317200262881136640 2020-10-17 04:26:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Coming from someone like John Kelly I’m perfectly ok with it. I don’t get how these ppl coming out against Trump makes them think it will change anything. It just proves they are two faced pieces of sh*t.
1317198893881327618 2020-10-17 04:21:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like @SouthwestAir will be losing business if this bigotry continues on their flights.

1317195962608099328 2020-10-17 04:09:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey @nytimes you fact checking this Joe Biden rally?   He’s lied several times already.   “He said this virus is gonna disappear like America.” - @JoeBiden   2M+ Americans die every year without COVID. Would love to see if that number changed at all while Dems use scare tactics.
1317195040314200064 2020-10-17 04:05:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t think it’s a very good political move to suggest ppl who don’t vote for you lack intelligence. Dems always do this then wonder why they lose.
1317194285444329472 2020-10-17 04:02:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GWillHunting @justicedems And it had to be a ginger conveying the message, how diverse. 😂

1317193586488700928 2020-10-17 03:59:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’d like to remind ppl that this ad claims voting takes “10 mins out of your day” while democrats have been saying one might have to stand in line for 6+ hrs and dropping off your ballot in person could take just as long. So which is it?
1317191399788343296 2020-10-17 03:51:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The American flag represents FREEDOM for most ppl in 2020. It’s why ppl risk their lives to get here and never want to leave.   You’re just infected with white guilt and indoctrinating others with your ideology.
1317187342021525504 2020-10-17 03:35:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Minnesota Dems did this to themselves. They were the best red pilling mechanism ever used free of cost to the Trump campaign and Republicans running for office.   https://t.co/7LS01EmI5n

I have no doubt she would respect our constitution and apply the law as written. I wish they didn’t have to wait a week. Get’er done!

1317158131898540034 2020-10-17 01:39:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why don’t you ask how an Obama speechwriter got into Biden’s Town hall now Tom? Since clapping and nodding got you so curious.
1317157543899099137 2020-10-17 01:36:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 Sarah has TDS therefore incapable of humor.   When the leftist seals clap that’s not because you are funny.
1317157170740219904 2020-10-17 01:35:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> More proof that “comedians” with TDS and hate in their hearts aren’t remotely funny.
1317156265341067264 2020-10-17 01:31:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is how this racist became famous. Mimicking Trump. Let’s be clear without Trump she’s NOTHING.   Come on Sarah try to be “funny” without Trump.. I dare you.
1317155389603946498 2020-10-17 01:28:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You know you probably could have made it big when ppl didn’t know your politics, because you limit your fan base that way. Your mimics of Trump were funny, but this sh*t isn’t.

1317152819208617984 2020-10-17 01:17:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @llambchops @HowleyReporter @KenPaxtonTX Problem with that is their own law states that the drop box just has to be secure and available to the public.   Because according to the law ANYONE can be designated to return the ballot no signature or verification required.  https://t.co/lNLH3gRq59

1317151256108888064 2020-10-17 01:11:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When @SavannahGuthrie asked Trump about Q last night it was to get him to denounce Q so he could lose support. Because these ppl know that Q are huge supporters of the president.   Don’t fall for their leftist tricks.

1317149603368595456 2020-10-17 01:05:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well “severe cases” aren’t that common. No one said Trump had a severe case of COVID either.   Plus we don’t trust globalist UN sh*ts.
1317149211025051648 2020-10-17 01:03:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The same WHO that now says that lockdowns for COVID don’t work?  https://t.co/mjcQ23x5TQ

1317143858371653632 2020-10-17 00:42:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s not what being an originalist means. The constitution is pretty broad in its words stating “person” or “individual”. States were making their own rules and interpreting the constitution how they wanted.   This is how the ORIGINAL text should be interpreted.  https://t.co/Ojpm6jzPdK

I just go by actual policy at this point and follow thru on those policies.   Biden has promised so much over his 47 yrs and hasn’t done sh*t but somehow he’s gonna get it done as POTUS now.

1317127547247751168 2020-10-16 23:37:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I am shocked that a media outlet would push Jeremiah Elliot’s gofundme while gofundme shuts down Rittenhouse getting donations. Why isn’t Jeremiah’s shutdown for “racism” @gofundme?
1317126206102196226 2020-10-16 23:32:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagínate que una mujer dominicana decide con su propio cerebro votar por la persona que quiere the presidente, y la respuesta de los que odian a Trump es usar palabras racistas para identificarla. #Bigots

I’ve been shushed by white liberals in person for trying to explain “children in cages” and that undocumented ppl don’t come here for asylum they come here for work as a Latina.
1317123008889155597 2020-10-16 23:19:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sarahcpr I’d also like to remind everyone that this individual has done nothing but profit off of Trump voice overs.   Without Trump this “comedian” would be NOTHING!   She’s literally banking on the hate ppl have for Trump the moment it ends so does her “career”.
1317122414317162496 2020-10-16 23:17:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is racist af. So if a black Dominican woman supports Trump in Miami she must be a “token”?   You bigoted racist fk. I’m Latina I support Trump as well.  https://t.co/unpLbnWdTW

1316964418580873216 2020-10-16 12:49:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why do you assume she was paid? Is it because she’s a black woman?

1316916925990055940 2020-10-16 09:40:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But leftist say he has integrity?!  https://t.co/iUbqKCRyv1
1316916453438853120 2020-10-16 09:38:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian I guess I’m a damn liar for assuming Steve Scully was lying. 🤦🏻‍♀️

1316915495904432130 2020-10-16 09:34:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well this is embarrassing Joe.
1316915403491336198 2020-10-16 09:34:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> CDC: This mask protects me more than a vaccine would!   Also the CDC: We NEVER claimed masks protect the wearer from COVID.   Me: *rolls eyes* Trust the scientists they said!  https://t.co/A2bT5Ncktg
1316915316488810497 2020-10-16 09:34:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk 2. Let me give you an example:   If I’m an employee &amp; make $25/hr at 40 hrs a wk = $2000 every 2 wks = $52k/yr  • insur deductions of $136/biwkly or $3536/yr • CA state taxes of 8% or $3877/yr  • FED taxes 22% or $10,662/yr  • social security 6.2% or $3224/yr  https://t.co/wnX1WVhcEV
1316915077849731073 2020-10-16 09:33:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s a politician and he knows how to lie to your face and then do nothing when he gets elected.   In 47 years of government service what did he do for Americans if he has such integrity?
1316914477686755328 2020-10-16 09:30:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoo sure..  https://t.co/fULBD8U9Pg
1316914319188250626 2020-10-16 09:30:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes you can have respect for someone and still believe they shouldn’t be on the court Sam.
1316914060810739712 2020-10-16 09:29:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 😂🤣😂 #Trump2020 I don’t believe Biden even got 400k viewers. Trump had over a million.
1316913609935605760 2020-10-16 09:27:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do you even know why Trump said that? The left had been mocking his supporters as being dumb because he got a large section of the “uneducated” vote. He didn’t mock them like an elitist pos he embraced them. FYI being “uneducated” doesn’t mean someone is stupid you jackhole!
1316912775671795713 2020-10-16 09:24:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead What leftist gibberish is this?
1316912559207948288 2020-10-16 09:23:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Lasers20201 Government sucks.
1316912431290003456 2020-10-16 09:22:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This Fauci?  https://t.co/jh1zRqPLcW
1316911507083530240 2020-10-16 09:19:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Lasers20201 That’s what I thought. Thanks for confirming. 😌👍🏼
1316911083953754112 2020-10-16 09:17:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> White ppl that sign up for this bullsh*t get ZERO respect from this Latina. It’s fkin racist.
1316909018317787142 2020-10-16 09:09:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Hung_Hippo They baby him too much while @SavannahGuthrie had to give her two cents on everything and interrupting the president and the voter asking questions.
1316907766502559744 2020-10-16 09:04:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This woman asks Joe about fracking and he says he never said he would stop fracking.   This was her face.. 😂  #BidenTownHall  https://t.co/og26vEnIIa
1316907474969153537 2020-10-16 09:03:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ChrisGr86712795 One of the ppl that said she’s leaning Biden as an independent told the president he has a nice smile when he smiles. It was cute.
1316902595936616449 2020-10-16 08:43:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ChrisGr86712795 Why is she cutting in every time someone asks a question?   Also we heard today that the CDC never claimed masks help the wearer.   🤦🏻‍♀️
1316898899609624576 2020-10-16 08:28:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now @icecube you have a “whole Trump campaign controversy.”
1316889774003609600 2020-10-16 07:52:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why don’t you check for yourself Trump reply guy?
1316854312279048196 2020-10-16 05:31:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk 1. It does because as an independent contractor you get to write off those expenses at the end of the year. A regular employee who pays taxes, insurance and can’t include gas and maintenance on vehicles in tax deductions doesn’t.
1316851790155902976 2020-10-16 05:21:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk If Uber takes a dollar while you get .10¢ then I don’t know how buzzfeed claims they get $25/hr on average?  Yes you have to pay for healthcare and taxes later after you’ve calculated your deductions.   How much do you think working ppl pay in taxes in CA?
1316850877341204481 2020-10-16 05:18:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk 2. I paid $8263 in fees for two years as a “temp” employee and then when they let me go i was told it was because I was an “at-will” employee so no reason is required. Do I get reimbursed? Hell no. I would have rather kept that money for me.
1316850219229749248 2020-10-16 05:15:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk 1. Then look for another job. Unions don’t do anything, but charge you to negotiate more an hour and hear complaints.   I was not a union member but was charged $36.89 a month for fees while they negotiated for 2 yrs to increase pay. Ultimately the increase would be .75¢/hr
1316849283744768000 2020-10-16 05:11:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk This is happening in California if the cost of living is going up that’s because Democrats are trying to get money anywhere they can it’s not anything Uber and Lyft did.   You can choose NOT to work for Uber or Lyft that’s how you negotiate your pay.  https://t.co/wsIi4ZKsZy
1316848032508383232 2020-10-16 05:06:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk FYI a private contractor *IS* self employment and they get deductions as a business like miles traveled, wear and tear on your vehicle offering drinks or candy is a deduction and who knows about your tips you don’t have to claim them
1316847474066124800 2020-10-16 05:04:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk Ppl do it all the time. Have you ever heard of PER DIEM RNs or Traveler RNs? They do it all the time.   I some cases they have their own insurance or get insurance via a working spouse. They prefer to get all their money and do their deductions at the end of the year.
1316846647385616389 2020-10-16 05:01:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BenSasse we have questions.
1316846510131220480 2020-10-16 05:00:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m curious how this “call with constituents” became public? Did someone record it?
1316845189969846272 2020-10-16 04:55:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And for this statement the left wants to cancel an 87 yr old woman? WHY DID YOU FKS VOTE FOR HER instead of telling her to retire?! Same with RBG, did y’all believe she’d just live forever?!
1316843660512641025 2020-10-16 04:49:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 @RealBrandonDonk Ppl love the flexibility of being an Uber and Lyft driver you make your own schedule, hours, you get tips &amp; don’t pay taxes.   You wanna be an “employee” be ready to get told which days &amp; hours you work to determine your employment status and “qualifying” for benefits.
1316843192575115264 2020-10-16 04:47:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @goforbaroque @brianstelter Steve Scully is the admitted LIAR and somehow its Trump’s fault he lied?  https://t.co/gxt1pTIDVL
1316841969641906176 2020-10-16 04:42:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lasers20201 Hey @RealBrandonDonk you’re an independent contractor who do you get fked over by more often the big companies or the government?   Here’s the thing Lasers YOU choose to be an independent contractor don’t like it look for work elsewhere that offers you what you need.
1316841308837695488 2020-10-16 04:40:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like the Biden camp is backed up into a corner they never expected.   That’s the difference between him and Trump. We know where Trump stands on the issues. Biden and Kamala pander.
1316840474691297283 2020-10-16 04:36:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sorry @HouseJudiciary but how would anyone know when #RBG was going to pass away therefore making a position available on the supreme court?   We know that had this been reversed Dems would NOT have hesitated because they constantly go back on their “promises”.
1316838460217458688 2020-10-16 04:28:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Would love to know why  @WeDemandJustice believes nominating a SCOTUS and placing a SCOTUS is a “theft” when it’s completely within the president’s authority to nominate and the senate’s to confirm? I want to ask @SenSusanCollins why she believes ACB is wishy washy?  https://t.co/3bgWKAAeR7
1316836459953889280 2020-10-16 04:20:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer @FoxNewsSunday Hell no and I’m loving it. Trump was right again. 🤣
1316834384322863105 2020-10-16 04:12:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How many ppl do you think are deleting their tweets defending Scully in the last week?   #ScullyLied
1316833840325783552 2020-10-16 04:10:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He wasn’t. He was hoping he was.
1316833627766841344 2020-10-16 04:09:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Thank goodness we don’t take this guy at his word.
1316833325177163776 2020-10-16 04:08:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do you feel betrayed Britt?
1316833102178643968 2020-10-16 04:07:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You probably shouldn’t have lied Steve.
1316832896229937153 2020-10-16 04:06:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well how do you feel about defending him now Frank?
1316831902175617024 2020-10-16 04:02:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I can almost bet majority of them included #resist in their bios.
1316831428450025472 2020-10-16 04:00:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This didn’t fkin age well did it?
1316831113138958338 2020-10-16 03:59:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like @FoxNewsSunday Chris Wallace needs to re evaluate who he defends openly when the evidence is so clear.   Steve Scully lied. Those are the facts.
1316829943532146688 2020-10-16 03:54:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Haha Feinstein a de facto Republican while the left vote for her every fkin election?! 😂  https://t.co/65COpAF5ZA
1316829564341874688 2020-10-16 03:53:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t think I’ve ever seen a conservative group request someone being removed from a committee over praising the “other side” which Republicans did as well and a mere difference of opinion. 😂🍿 Bigotry runs deep among the left.

1316821485298704385 2020-10-16 03:21:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Alexpad Exactly.
1316820258196344832 2020-10-16 03:16:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AhmedBaba_ If that’s what you get from that comment you’re deranged.   I want to know why the marshals had to get him when it was known from day one who he was and he even did an interview with VICE?!
1316816460178755587 2020-10-16 03:01:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RCult45 At least put it in the sun even if you don’t wash it every other day. 😂  https://t.co/nlpBM9pgNT
1316814220739002371 2020-10-16 02:52:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Here’s a little secret.. RNs toss theirs after use. Ppl are rewearing there’s for days on end.
1316813583313821696 2020-10-16 02:49:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @numb_butter Do Uber and Lyft drivers make tips? Are they subjected to pre employment drug tests? Do they pay taxes? Who assumes liability if you get into an accident in your car under your insurance. In fact they get tax breaks like businesses for miles traveled and expenses.
1316812454312067073 2020-10-16 02:45:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @numb_butter Ok so they should be “employees” while they use their own cars and car insurance to drive strangers around that could turn around and sue them for whatever reason while not having taxes withheld?   Seems like you don’t know what you are actually asking for.
1316811661978685440 2020-10-16 02:42:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> May have? 🤔 Pay to Play scheme?
1316809286522003456 2020-10-16 02:32:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They aren’t employees. They are independent contractors and don’t have taxes withheld from their payments or tips. If you want millions of unemployed in CA so be it. Don’t cry later when ppl don’t have jobs.  https://t.co/XX8A5fqx2D
1316808427067244544 2020-10-16 02:29:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ScryingGlass I have done it temporarily because I want to see the affect. Then I go and unblock a few days later.
1316808206396518400 2020-10-16 02:28:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait why should Uber and Lyft pay benefits to ppl who are listed as “independent contractors” who don’t have taxes withheld from their payments? You want UBER and Lyft to pay for benefits then they would have to become employees and have taxes and ins premiums deducted.  https://t.co/5NFtR6VjUC
1316804916661248000 2020-10-16 02:15:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oct 11th? COVID restrictions in FL have decreased significantly. So I’m sure her party was followed by FLORIDA laws and CDC restrictions.   You miserable fks are so sad.
1316804379169574912 2020-10-16 02:13:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s been in hiding for awhile now.
1316803820844851200 2020-10-16 02:11:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Will you do away with knives and bricks as well Resister? As a gun owner you should probably know that majority of gun deaths are via suicide.

1316792002168590341 2020-10-16 01:24:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @_Dave_T_1 Please remind me was Trump president or VP in 2009 while his son was “judging a pageant”?

1316783171292200960 2020-10-16 00:49:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They did shoot at police officers. That fact remains.

1316778945526689793 2020-10-16 00:32:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now a witness who supports ACB being on the SC. What an amazing woman 1st blind law clerk to serve at the Supreme Court.  https://t.co/Eklp2HMrGc
1316777237232771077 2020-10-16 00:25:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What makes this person an expert witness? Yes, that looks like an RBG figurine so we already know the garbage this person is going to spew.  https://t.co/X90IeP0PLK
1316776309507280903 2020-10-16 00:21:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Loz87C @IngrahamAngle Please provide your source for your claim of “got caught laundering money through a kids charity.”   Had there been proof of actual  laundering of money there would have been indictments.   Don’t be a fkin clown.
1316773249808654336 2020-10-16 00:09:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KristenClarkeJD you lied. Barrett explained in detail why she made that decision on the case.   The jury also could not come to the conclusion that Mr Smith was fired for just for being black and not for his POOR performance within the company.  https://t.co/lIC68pjtfc
1316770971437600769 2020-10-16 00:00:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Get it done!!! This is anti American!!

Hunter Biden got $50k a month, that’s absolutely big money for someone to sit on a board of a company he had ZERO experience on.  https://t.co/Z6MEXfnlR9
1316769528928325632 2020-10-15 23:54:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco Lmaooo.
1316769479552950272 2020-10-15 23:54:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So I’m confused with this Dr Bhatti, he just claimed his patients work multiple jobs &amp; are on Medicaid?   How do you work multiple jobs &amp; still qualify for Medicaid when these are the income limits?  $8/hr x 80 hrs x 56 wks = $35,840   Didn’t @AOC claim ppl work 70+ hrs a week?  https://t.co/pnNAAK08Pw

Most trademarks were filed before Trump won the nomination.   Kinda NOT the same thing Hunter Biden did. Denial really is a SOB.  https://t.co/kpkGRLUCWg
1316758993545564160 2020-10-15 23:13:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake The cringe pandering.
1316754051497828354 2020-10-15 22:53:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SenWhitehouse I bet you don’t remember what democrats did when they only required a simple majority to get what they’re anted done.   Democrats lost their credibility and ability to question anyone with the impeachment bullsh*t and attacking of Kavanaugh. We won’t forget!
1316752222458273793 2020-10-15 22:46:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @massh0Ie @BeardyMan1983 @chalmette123 @RBPundit I bet when you saw the images of Andrew Gillum on the ground drugged out and naked you made the same argument. These are fake!!!   That’s called denial.   Did you know Gillum losing an election made him bi sexual? 😂  https://t.co/VKafSrjnC0
1316750767319965696 2020-10-15 22:40:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HouseJudiciary Dems have vilified Trump for 4 years and ACB for 4 days.    And they wonder why their constituents are scared af of ACB on the court.   They will vilify anyone to obtain their political GOAL. Don’t forget they vilified Kavanaugh for drinking beer ffs!
1316748169678446592 2020-10-15 22:30:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So when Hunter Biden is exposed in the @nypost the only thing the left does is project with ZERO evidence against Eric Trump? #EricTrumpUkraineScandal  https://t.co/h5URt6z6bh
1316747271807983617 2020-10-15 22:26:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When the left tries to vilify ACB with all these fears of law changes because she’s going to be on the supreme court just remember they said the same with Gorsuch &amp; Kavanaugh and what has happened?   #BarrettHearings  https://t.co/th0d1nmIKE
1316746453872599040 2020-10-15 22:23:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like @ChrisCoons doesn’t recall what an activist judge RBG was. So much so his colleges called RBG during this hearing their champion and an activist for women. ACB is a judge and she’s NEVER been an activist.   The left requires activist judges for their own agenda.
1316742218208538624 2020-10-15 22:06:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Communist twitter trying to regulate what news we are allowed to read and share. Sound familiar?   “Donald Trump don’t trust China, China is asshoe”
1316647285455904769 2020-10-15 15:49:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh but you’d miss everyone so much you’d move there too eventually Amy. In there lies the problem.

1316646072526106624 2020-10-15 15:44:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well there you have it.. FYI Trump nor his campaign had to do this. Trump won 6% of the black vote in 2016 which means he never needed it to win. Yet here he is making adjustments and talking to you about CWBA because he cares even if you don’t/didn’t vote for him. #KAG 🇺🇸

Don’t you realize once he wins he doesn’t have to do shit.
1316642262613282816 2020-10-15 15:29:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I bet the Trump Town Hall will have the highest ratings for NBC all year.

1316635000079446017 2020-10-15 15:00:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Women scare Trump so much he’s nominated one for the Supreme Court. 😂
1316631673111363584 2020-10-15 14:47:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Dems repeat the hearings of ACB are illegitimate. I’d love to know exactly how they are illegitimate?   It’s funny how they repeat certain things based on emotion hoping to get a reaction to help them politically.   We know your tricks @HouseJudiciary
1316630940714631170 2020-10-15 14:44:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sorry, but don’t democrats run the election commission in CA? How are GOP limiting ballot drop offs when they placed more secure drop off boxes to make it easier for voters to have access and y’all cried foul.  https://t.co/dbNK3Bjhwy

1316624971251105792 2020-10-15 14:20:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yep DARK MONEY backs Biden.
1316624456861638662 2020-10-15 14:18:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How many of the ballots cast in person do ppl think are leftists scared to death of contracting COVID?

1316618340849254400 2020-10-15 13:54:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Omg. Insane. He survived!!
1316615231729147904 2020-10-15 13:41:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The republicans are finally understanding that if they stand together they get things accomplished. Can’t play fair with the democrats anymore.
1316614490297790466 2020-10-15 13:38:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl get paid the big bucks to ask the questions all Americans want to know, “Kamala did you see the fly on Vice President Pence’s head?”
1316613021360218112 2020-10-15 13:33:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This person isn’t gonna he happy until he gets sucked up into a jet engine and chopped to bits.
1316612657311477760 2020-10-15 13:31:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake Lmaoo. So now they want Chuck Todd to be fired for doing his job?   MSNBC needed the ratings because only unhinged leftists watch them.

1316611054042980353 2020-10-15 13:25:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 🤣 What did Chuck Todd do this time?   I think I’ve seen #FireChuckTodd on trending about 5x in 2020. 😂
1316572494279524352 2020-10-15 10:51:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> • Trump signed legislation forgiving Hurricane Katrina debt that threatened HBCUs.  • Federal law enforcement more than doubled convictions of human traffickers and increased the number of defendants charged by 75% in ACTeam districts.  How can anyone not vote #Trump2020? 🇺🇸

1316565137680027649 2020-10-15 10:22:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is clearly a lie by @washingtonpost because we have heard tapes of Biden speaking to Poroshenko and wanting Shokin gone because the US claimed he was corrupt. So how is this not a quid pro quo with a foreign government?  https://t.co/3waVq9n6N7
1316563102247251968 2020-10-15 10:14:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You’re right he pushed out the prosecutor like he stated on video because he’s a corrupt pos who wanted to prevent the COMPANY his son was working from being investigated.  https://t.co/UOs1pJ2Uju
1316561839270969344 2020-10-15 10:09:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @b1ld3rb3rg @LiaS814 So a slap in the face means you deserve to be shot and killed?   Well if this is how you legitimize shooting deaths then officers seem pretty justified in theirs.

1316509254375727104 2020-10-15 06:40:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> A patriot who’s struggling a bit is looking for a little help. Donate if you can. Thx. ☺️🇺🇸
1316504240592838657 2020-10-15 06:20:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes she is and absolutely more than qualified for a life long position on the court, the democrats know it. They just hate that she isn’t a leftist activist “champion” like RBG was.
1316398440323059712 2020-10-14 23:20:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What’s funny about this is the leftist media (@cnn @msnbc) scared everyone to death w/COVID, now they realize that might be a problem. So now they are telling ppl they should go stand in line for 6 hrs &amp; risk their lives for the common good. 🤣 #SuperSpreaders!
1316397368690892801 2020-10-14 23:16:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 4. If you would like to read this whole explanation just based on law and no partisanship here it is... Democrats are just trying to emotionally control your votes w/lies that they know are lies, but use for political reasons.    #barretthearing    https://t.co/n4XBL1PjdS
1316396484179316736 2020-10-14 23:12:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 3. Here is how the Supreme Court could potentially vote. It also explains that both Trump and Biden have made promises to protect the pre-existing conditions clause. I don’t believe any republican would do anything to remove that protection since it is over all a good thing.  https://t.co/XNWf9y5zkA
1316395651018547201 2020-10-14 23:09:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 2. When they repeat they believe ACB will be the nail in the coffin for the ACA it’s clear they are lying to the American ppl.. “plan sponsors know that the entire “affordable care act will NOT be overturned”.   #BarrettConfirmationHearing  https://t.co/V2IIUozbt2
1316395642424451072 2020-10-14 23:09:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 1. Let me remind democrats that ppl are allowed to bring grievances to the court and make claims of how a LAW that was legislated violates the constitution and their rights.   The lower courts already made a determination on the ACA and the mandate being unconstitutional.
1316390591094116353 2020-10-14 22:49:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These democrats have no clue what they are even discussing when it comes to the law.   They are making assumptions about what ACB meant with her dissents on cases. She’s sitting there telling them what she meant and @SenatorDurbin starts mansplaining how ACB is confused.
1316389433592012806 2020-10-14 22:44:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SenatorDurbin just said, “Can the president unilaterally prevent ppl from voting based on race”? Again I’d love to know how the president is targeting a particular race from voting when voting takes place in the states and under that state’s election laws.   #BarrettHearings
1316258667440660481 2020-10-14 14:04:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 This #prolife Catholic individual is voting for a party that thinks killing the unborn up until birth is ok? Yea I’m calling bullsh*t. I believe THOU SHALL NOT KILL is in the catholic bible too.  https://t.co/3dvNZsH5gA
1316255900085051393 2020-10-14 13:53:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @stonewall007 @deb6246 You want to know why Tories won big last election? Because leftists are fking nutters even from across the pond.
1316255032518426624 2020-10-14 13:50:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is how controlling the left is.. they change things on a whim.
1316251196273819648 2020-10-14 13:35:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @WurdzR @SpeakerPelosi His brain is mush.
1316251029608906755 2020-10-14 13:34:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap Mike would love to return to the days when women had no voice in government or politics is what I got from that.
1316250270817427457 2020-10-14 13:31:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 4. Now they want to use tax payer money for their political bullsh*t by making us pay to “safeguard” our democracy?   How much is that gonna cost us. I thought this was paid at the local level now they want to double dip because the government sucks with money.
1316249765340827648 2020-10-14 13:29:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 3. They want tax payers to pay for those who are struggling with rent or mortgages because once again democrats have decided to shut things down for so long ppl have run out of money and they have no job to return to.
1316249159750410240 2020-10-14 13:27:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 2. They want to give OSHA money. A government entity that fines businesses for not social distancing during lunch times and failure to wait 20 sec after the person before you has washed their hands or used hand sanitizer.
1316248374794878976 2020-10-14 13:24:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lets break down the #HeroesAct2   1. They want to use tax payer funds to help states to provide a years worth of state assistance to pay vital workers. I’m guessing the states and territories struggling the most are democrat run states and areas after forcing shutdowns.  https://t.co/WQzmWPCPd6
1316243295853375491 2020-10-14 13:03:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SpeakerPelosi remember when it was said that Antifa was a myth and didn’t exist? That BLM was just peacefully protesting? So tell me how does an imaginary group of ppl and peaceful protestors cause $1B in damages across the country?   https://t.co/0K2mAdpFzh
1316241787460046850 2020-10-14 12:57:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s embarrassing to ask @SpeakerPelosi an elected member of congress wtf she’s doing to get funds to the American ppl?
1316241440666603520 2020-10-14 12:56:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SheldSink Of course they do. As long as they are on the left their freedoms aren’t in question, but the left has repeatedly stated what they would do to their political opponents and their freedoms.
1316238445447057409 2020-10-14 12:44:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How are the secure ballot drop boxes illegal? That’s actually the only requirement. So as long as the ballot can be harvested in a secure ballot box and delivered to an election official they are gucci. 😂  https://t.co/pgSq49wpav
1316235029618454529 2020-10-14 12:31:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SpeakerPelosi : We feed them! We feed them!   I’d love to know how many of the hungry in San Francisco Pelosi has personally fed from her ivory tower. How many $15 pints of gourmet ice cream has she given to the homeless or hungry?   https://t.co/4sxg1iDLYF
1316233560072704004 2020-10-14 12:25:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeBiden Is that 20 vehicles? 😂 A Trump boat parade has more than that sh*t.. 🇺🇸  https://t.co/iGpCyhI8t6
1316232869971283968 2020-10-14 12:22:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why aren’t their senators and governors writing those letters? They controlled what happened in their states. I mean if I was Cuomo I’d apologize for putting the elderly in harms way when he FORCED nursing facilities to take COVID+ patients in.
1316232418513154048 2020-10-14 12:20:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sorry, but how does a president “let” ppl die from a virus? 2M+ Americans die every fkin year. I guess these TDS sufferers think we should be as fkin miserable as they are every fkin day.
1316229995845447680 2020-10-14 12:11:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 They just might be surprised. Imagine if Trump wins CA that’s 55 electoral points. 🤣
1316218663909822465 2020-10-14 11:25:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ABC7News Are they anti government or anti tyranny?   Because it would seem both Northam and Whitmer were being tyrants pushing their “absolute power” on the American ppl by taking away their fundamental rights in their states.
1316217018517868544 2020-10-14 11:19:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Where’s the diversity? Why were white women excluded? When I say democrats are racist I’m not joking.   You have democrats claiming segregation is morally wrong yet are perfectly ok w/segregation on the basis of race as long as that race is NOT white.  https://t.co/HlvlLnI7I1
1316213476671414273 2020-10-14 11:05:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @maziehirono is worthless. Imagine attacking someone for saying “sexual preference” instead of “sexual orientation”. I have a sexual preference as a straight woman’s hat doesn’t mean that “preference” can’t change with time therefore being MY PREFERENCE.
1316212322591895552 2020-10-14 11:00:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AmyMcGrathKY just FYI @senatemajldr has gotten things done. He’s confirmed 200+ judges like he was elected to do. 2nd trying not to raise our national debt during a pandemic is not an easy task while Dems want fluff money. Use the $400B not used.  https://t.co/CLQ1ZSt8NG
1316153513802489856 2020-10-14 07:07:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @budmild22 Exactly.  https://t.co/P7nAL72yxH
1316153176123293697 2020-10-14 07:05:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion Wayyyyyy. ACB is going to be a great judge.
1316124049865662465 2020-10-14 05:10:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah She is one vote. Implying what she might do is ridiculous. It all depends on the argument brought to her by the person who has the grievance.   That’s exactly why the guy who refused to make a cake for a gay couple because it was against his religion won.
1316123351241297920 2020-10-14 05:07:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BuckyBarfbag Well @maziehirono of course brings up some lame ass sexist question RBG gave an opinion on. I personally think RBG is wrong to imply women are paid less because of sexism.   That’s an activist position to hold not a lawful one. The sexism would have to be proven not just implied.
1316122620014718976 2020-10-14 05:04:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This question is subjective. So of course a judge will not respond to this off base question. If someone placed spiders in a box in front of a polling station someone could consider that intimidation while others might not.   Do you find security guards in banks intimidating?
1316121521341882368 2020-10-14 04:59:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OvertonGaslight I honestly know women who applied for the same job and got more pay because they weren’t willing to be paid less if they switched jobs.   So the woman gets paid less bs always bothered me. I think it’s just not the case.
1316120882939535360 2020-10-14 04:57:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Remind me how Trump as president is going to undo ACA?   I’d love to hear it since he’s obviously been unsuccessful and I’d definitely want it to be repealed and replaced.
1316120375990730752 2020-10-14 04:55:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Clearly you did since you keep repeating how Trump and Barrett are somehow going to undo Roe v Wade and ACA. 😂 Not my fault you’re dumb af.
1316119853757943808 2020-10-14 04:53:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I would love to know how pay discrimination by sex is determined in court? Because as a woman I agree to the pay I am offered at the time of my employment. If I find out later that a man is making more is that discrimination or the fact the man didn’t settle on the wage offered?
1316104006830182400 2020-10-14 03:50:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah He has said repeatedly that his plan will be less expensive and still include the pre-existing conditions which means when congress actually writes a bill to replace ACA he would not sign it unless it includes those things.   Do you know anything about how legislation works?
1316103583285215232 2020-10-14 03:48:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Well when I said that republicans had tried to pass a healthcare bill you claimed that was “absolutely false” I just showed you they did. Maybe you should ask why that was something you didn’t know?   Also Trump isn’t a legislator. He needs republicans to write the bill.
1316102106009333760 2020-10-14 03:42:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah The constitution has no real bias. The PEOPLE do. This is why conservatives prefer constitutional judges. They make the vow to remove bias when making a ruling or following precedent and using the constitution to determine whether something is legal. That’s all they do.
1316101380176711680 2020-10-14 03:39:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Again you can’t take the 2A and claim ppl don’t have the right to bear arms.   It’s written plain as day. But the states have rights and their own constitutions as well. Those democratically elected officials make the laws of your state, if you don’t agree vote them out.
1316100769100099584 2020-10-14 03:37:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Again you made the assumption that TRUMP could make the decision to repeal and replace the ACA, he can’t.   Congress has to do it. Congress doesn’t always back the POTUS even when they are of the same party. SCOTUS would only determine if the law was unconstitutional as written.
1316100092508557313 2020-10-14 03:34:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Seems this is something Dems don’t tell you.. it was a healthcare bill backed by Paul Ryan but failed.   I thought you were on top of this stuff? So no not “absolutely false”.    https://t.co/F6sdQCzJaf
1316099322321141761 2020-10-14 03:31:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah I already responded to your Muslim judge question.
1316099223528509440 2020-10-14 03:31:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Trump can’t repeal it. It’s not in his authority to do so as head of the executive branch. The only ones who can repeal it and replace are legislators unless the law as a whole is determined to be unconstitutional on its face. Then legislators would have to rewrite it.
1316098757050601474 2020-10-14 03:29:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Well trans men have ovaries and according to the left “men” can very much become pregnant and have children. If you don’t believe this then wouldn’t that make you transphobic?  https://t.co/xCD3ePDjvQ
1316090870119104512 2020-10-14 02:58:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah It’s not a “nice try” the mandate was deemed unconstitutional. That’s because when the democrats rushed through the ACA they didn’t care if they violated ppls rights with mandating ppl purchase insurance.   Seems a replacement was offered by Reps in 2017, but turned down.
1316089023614513152 2020-10-14 02:50:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Sure as long as they apply the law as written in our constitution.   The Supreme Court DOES NOT legislate. They do not make the laws they simply apply the constitution to it to see if the legislation is in accordance with the freedoms written in the constitution.
1316087563476639745 2020-10-14 02:45:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Also if by far right religious fringe you mean people who hold a moral position you don’t like and have a loving nuclear family, then I guess so.
1316054405645434880 2020-10-14 00:33:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Tell me how long have you been told that Trump was going to take health insurance away from millions?   The only thing that has been deemed unconstitutional is the individual mandate. Remember it’s not scotus’s job to legislate.   What rights do men have that women don’t?
1315915031800815616 2020-10-13 15:19:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats always get fked by their own rules. Especially when Republicans use them against Democrats. Thread 👇🏼
1315913610732814336 2020-10-13 15:13:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I prefer transparency...
1315912206089814016 2020-10-13 15:08:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is attacking women for their attire YOUR regular job Leslie?
1315911182008475648 2020-10-13 15:04:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The only homophobes are those who have a problem with the village ppl playing at a Trump rally. You don’t own gay ppl or their votes leftists.
1315910907231260673 2020-10-13 15:03:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These miserable fks are now turning on the village people all because Trump likes their song. 😂 Cry more!
1315910374420434944 2020-10-13 15:00:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not sure how this is a bad thing..
1315909367657504770 2020-10-13 14:56:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun He says it on purpose, which makes it even funnier.
1315908395115798529 2020-10-13 14:53:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder if that’s what the left thought when RBG was nominated for the court.   FYI this is OUR judge. The American ppl nominated Trump in 2016 and gave him a majority senate in 2018.  https://t.co/5ebuJVYSPP
1315905248167305218 2020-10-13 14:40:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4  https://t.co/nMXaAhbjrh
1315904968671461376 2020-10-13 14:39:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I know some of you are literally shaking. 😂
1315904435109814272 2020-10-13 14:37:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> White guilt is a plague and cringe af... don’t @ me.
1315903779191939072 2020-10-13 14:34:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun @Rick95648 @AGBecerra Yes I totally get that.
1315903713672749056 2020-10-13 14:34:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So your vagina is shrieking at the idea that your granddaughters will be tossing their vaginas to and fro and then might not be able to kill off your great grandkids?   I have ZERO words.
1315902349676670976 2020-10-13 14:29:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m wheezing..
1315901825225125889 2020-10-13 14:26:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun @Rick95648 @AGBecerra Haha Mexican isn’t a race..   Becerra would be an idiot no matter his race.
1315901439588274176 2020-10-13 14:25:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> During the #BarrettHearing today I heard @SenBlumenthal say that Repubs want an activist judge on the court. While the left had the most activist judge in RBG.   Then @maziehirono calls RBG “our champion”. A judge shouldn’t be a democrat champion, but a constitutional one.  https://t.co/YTQQ1JmQ5M
1315894968767057920 2020-10-13 13:59:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> True..
1315886982434713600 2020-10-13 13:27:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sarahparvini They aren’t illegal according to their own law. The official drop box just has to be secure since you can entrust anyone to submit your ballot for you due to new ballot harvesting laws. 🤷🏻‍♀️ No special requirements for a drop box except for it to be secure, outside and accesible  https://t.co/RaUVmzofYM
1315885637631787014 2020-10-13 13:22:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Under California election laws how can any “secure” election drop boxes be unauthorized when you are allowed to harvest ballots in CALIFORNIA due to new dem laws? I don’t think @AGBecerra or Dems thought this thru.  https://t.co/5swAISOgQi
1315877685571117056 2020-10-13 12:51:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Men being “head of the household” is in the Bible. You know the same bible devout Catholic Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden have.
1315841564355117056 2020-10-13 10:27:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah She admitted to what?
1315826055102361601 2020-10-13 09:25:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah If wapo makes the claim why not have a screen shot of the pamphlet they claim they saw her name on and called her a “handmaid”. I mean they did see it right?   Why do you just simply believe something like that without any proof?
1315824593022537728 2020-10-13 09:20:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah See what? I’ve seen the handmaids Tale. I’ve also seen how women are given jail sentences under sharia for not wearing hijab. Yet you’re worried about ACB because she’s a Christian mother with a beautiful family. 😂   https://t.co/e0sNHy7QhA
1315823015595139074 2020-10-13 09:13:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @petluvers4Trump I laugh and think these poor brain dead bastards.
1315819336435548160 2020-10-13 08:59:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah I’ve seen nothing on their site stating they even use that term.   Trying to label her a “handmaid” doesn’t help your case if you are attempting to vilify her. It wasn’t the “handmaids” who created Gilead.   Well I’m guessing women aren’t jailed  for failure to wear hijab in PoP.
1315816602898624512 2020-10-13 08:48:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun Exactly. Ppl don’t seem to understand that part. Not everyone at the hospital I work at is tested. Our temps are taken and you get asked if you are having any symptoms and we have to wear a mask. That’s it.   If you make direct contact with COVID+ patients is when you gown up.
1315816124542382080 2020-10-13 08:46:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah “People of praise has not confirmed she is a member.” -article   Maybe you should be more concerned with sharia law if you are truly against being a “handmaid”.   Not sure why leftists are so against ppl having moral structure based on their religious beliefs.  https://t.co/ayq8KLV9zg
1315748366270169088 2020-10-13 04:17:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah How has ACB been a handmaiden? She was a judge on the 7th circuit. Tell me what she’s done to overturn roe v Wade or ACA as a judge?   I don’t hate women I think ACB would make a great addition to the bench. Why do you hate them?
1315746530289045504 2020-10-13 04:09:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LeftSarah Looks like Klobachar would do great as a MARTHA.
1315746245105741824 2020-10-13 04:08:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s only if they were tested daily and showed they were negative. Let be honest most ppl aren’t tested unless they show symptoms. So you can’t really know if the bubble worked unless you can confirm every player and coach was tested daily.
1315704411348332544 2020-10-13 01:22:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird Trump wants a woman for the court while Amy doesn’t.   Who’s the true misogynist?
1315704022825754624 2020-10-13 01:20:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CoryBooker btw you BETRAYED our trust when you decided to walk undocumented immigrants into our country like any human trafficker would. It was NOT representative of a US Senator. Virtue signaling pos.   #BarrettHearing   https://t.co/l3wDc2UdTv
1315702681718013952 2020-10-13 01:15:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh @amyklobuchar has internalized misogyny.
1315702419389509633 2020-10-13 01:14:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It seems that @SenKamalaHarris didn’t hear a word of the fact checking @MikeCrapo did in the hearing and she looks like a clown repeating the same things he just debunked. 🤣 Dems always try to control ppl with emotions.   #BarrettHearing
1315668387951865856 2020-10-12 22:59:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No they aren’t as they are taking precautions. So you can’t do your job, but I’m expected to do mine as an essential worker by taking  precautions? Do you ppl ever do your damn jobs? Every excuse not to work while still getting paid. *smh*
1315667693966557186 2020-10-12 22:56:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sorry but you do not know for a fact that she said those words before her death you weren’t there. On the other hand the RBG quote Lindsey mentioned is *ON THE RECORD*!
1315666339554447360 2020-10-12 22:51:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 More than terrible.
1315503525422456832 2020-10-12 12:04:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Just more proof of what the left would do to the court if they were in charge. They’d place leftist nut bags on the court to get what they want.  https://t.co/u2vVSKIraQ
1315501516329893888 2020-10-12 11:56:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaooo this is a parody right? 🤣  https://t.co/AVbmHAbGGa
1315485982330744832 2020-10-12 10:54:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now you can’t use words someone says in campaign ads without their permission? 😂 Yea that would disqualify a hell of a lot of the ads Biden has our using Trump and his words out of context in their videos without his permission.
1315474167941099526 2020-10-12 10:07:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s a cold blooded murderer and definitely a far left militant like Michael Reinoehl who was 100% Antifa.
1315468067766333442 2020-10-12 09:43:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s NOT changing the rules numbnuts. Obama appointed plenty of judges, 329 of them. @DanRather clearly recalls that “court packing” right?  https://t.co/LRrsqWtebh
1315462811074523137 2020-10-12 09:22:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can you remind me who physically assaulted Greta where she felt the need to defend herself so she’s not brutally injured? I might have missed it.
1315461137152970752 2020-10-12 09:15:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @joncoopertweets probably deleted it because he’s a lying pos.
1315460360447561728 2020-10-12 09:12:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SidCade @thehill She’s a tyrant it’s why she believes she can make her own rules.
1315460210475954176 2020-10-12 09:12:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sounds like @gretchenwhitmer has a political agenda. The date has been set by her state. 🤷🏻‍♀️ But then again she’s a tyrant who thinks she’s above adhering to her own state constitution.
1315171037064040449 2020-10-11 14:03:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That means nothing. Most associated with Antifa you wouldn’t even know are associated with Antifa.   Same people...  https://t.co/lIHPKUJucI
1315169642667630592 2020-10-11 13:57:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lodov2417 Yep he sure does.

1315168398972612608 2020-10-11 13:52:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How does wearing a mask show respect? It’s peak virtue signaling.
1315167412493246465 2020-10-11 13:48:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Lodov2417 Like are we just not allowed to have a sense of humor anymore? It’s fking jokes like chill tf out.   Bill and his wife..  https://t.co/BjsYqOUIPO
1315166177316929537 2020-10-11 13:43:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That would be *leftist white women and they tend to do that because they know what minorities need.
1315162316996964356 2020-10-11 13:28:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Bring back the In Living Color Carrey. Since his TDS diagnosis he’s lost his funny. *smh*
1315160986408476674 2020-10-11 13:23:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So democrats are changing the election rules because they need a back up plan in case Biden is losing.   Don’t forget Trump warned y’all.   https://t.co/yxHj1Zvtow
1315160330767486976 2020-10-11 13:20:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s not “packing” Dan it’s called Obama failed to fill judiciary appointments so once again Trump had to play clean up. Unfortunately for Merrick Garland Obama didn’t have a Democrat run senate. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1315156808122548224 2020-10-11 13:06:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @rostambby @haydeebarahonaa Also is it racist or classist? Oh girly you assume ppl like me aren’t working class because YOU have a problem with statistics.   See that’s the difference between us. You use it as a crutch. I prefer to ignore it and get my life because it’s not dependent on anyone but ME.
1315156309126209536 2020-10-11 13:04:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @rostambby @haydeebarahonaa Yea sorry no one here does anything to “own the libs” it’s not my bag.   Since when are actual stats demeaning? Si  I’m sure whites in Bakersfield are crying in a corner over it too. So oppressed.

Yes your kind of stupidity is a disease. Did they teach you this sh*t in school? Was it some white activist teacher who has you doing their dirty work?

1315151649199931395 2020-10-11 12:46:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @haydeebarahonaa @playgirlstephny @p3acebewithyou Why should I keep who I support to myself? Obviously she’s questioning how I can be Hispanic &amp; support Trump. Maybe she can see in the video I sure as hell am not the only one. Then again you try to claim things are just a figure of speech when they don’t work out for you.
1315151072881639424 2020-10-11 12:43:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @playgirlstephny @p3acebewithyou @haydeebarahonaa And democrats what these children to vote? 😂 💀

1315148218200584195 2020-10-11 12:32:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hahaha. 🤣  https://t.co/nxtlZYhwtm
1315147803761364994 2020-10-11 12:30:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @hoochiemamabay @haydeebarahonaa A literal KKK rally? Where? In Bakersfield? 😂 Also you hopped in my mentions pendejo when no one asked you too. You are free to hop tf out.
1315147382644850689 2020-10-11 12:29:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa Yet that’s not what you said. You said AN ALL WHITE CITY COUNCIL.    Fact check: FALSE  I have zero hatred for my own ppl. I just like to deal in facts not emotional bullsh*t for clout.
1315147066461413376 2020-10-11 12:27:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @hoochiemamabay @haydeebarahonaa I never said racism doesn’t happen. What I was pointing out is that ppl like you claim its a huge problem. But if it was truly as huge a problem as you claim you wouldn’t have to make shit up like “there was literally a KKK rally the other day.” 😂 No manches.
1315146479753854981 2020-10-11 12:25:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa I don’t have to say. You just said it for me. You claimed racism because of an all white city council. I’m guessing they are fake Hispanics too since it doesn’t fit your ALL WHITE narrative.   You can have your own opinion you can’t have your own facts. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1315145246188040192 2020-10-11 12:20:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa So he’s not running does that make your statement about an “all white city council” true or false?
1315144666266787840 2020-10-11 12:18:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa Yea I’m sure they didn’t hop on cars and try to smash windows or anything either, but then again like I said don’t protest in the fkin street.
1315144346455302144 2020-10-11 12:17:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hoochiemamabay @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa But what can we expect from a HOOCHIE MAMA BAY? 😂🤣😂   You..  https://t.co/tzyByRLA98

1315143409066151936 2020-10-11 12:13:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa Protesting in the street is illegal. The cops you protest and hate so much shutdown the traffic so you don’t get fkin run over por pendejos.
1315143099568406528 2020-10-11 12:12:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mcmasie You first. Racist bigot.
1315143017976614912 2020-10-11 12:11:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa How is it a problem in CA? Please tell me how many KKK card holders you know in Bakersfield?   Are you a member of the KKK? I mean otherwise how would you know about a “meeting” they had?
1315142528622968832 2020-10-11 12:09:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mcmasie Yes I’m sure Hispanics hold swastikas. 😂 The white supremacists don’t like me because I’m brown you troglodyte.
1315142215589527553 2020-10-11 12:08:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @alexxvaldivia_ @haydeebarahonaa So you only have white cops in Bakersfield? I am calling bullsh*t.   Also this sh*t right here blocking traffic and harassing ppl is NOT FKING PEACEFUL. It’s fkin illegal.   All white city council is also a lie I believe Rivera and Gonzales are Hispanic last names.  https://t.co/4aREeIVeTO
1315141002630320131 2020-10-11 12:03:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Omg. So now saying white supremacy reigns in Bakersfield so much so that there’s a white supremacist on every corner was just a figure of speech? 🤣   Either it’s a white supremacist hell hole or it’s not. Which is it?
1315139561652064256 2020-10-11 11:58:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @haydeebarahonaa Can you read or naw? How can you have a place full of Hispanics and a white supremacist on every corner?   No es mi problema si eres pendeja.
1315139210882342912 2020-10-11 11:56:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chuckyyycheese Tienes 16 años.. 💀🤣 No manches güey.
1315138918937894912 2020-10-11 11:55:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chuckyyycheese I thought “white supremacists in every corner” was the worst take.  I say this as a Hispanic. I mean how dumb do you think we are that we’d move into areas where there are white supremacist everywhere and in CA?! 🤣😂🤣
1315137124845326337 2020-10-11 11:48:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Not that I know of. They shouldn’t be trying to get a dog removed from their leash. Keep your hands off the fkin dog. Ppl are sick of the bs. Let them have a small rally for Trump on a street corner how tf does that affect anyone?   The left at the sight of ppl who support Trump.  https://t.co/PCLyorPLcu
1315136554965192704 2020-10-11 11:46:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chuckyyycheese Bakersfield is full of Hispanics. 😂 Tf are you talking about?   I find it odd that if a city like Bakersfield has a “white supremacist in every corner” then why tf do Hispanics keep moving there?
1315134930691657728 2020-10-11 11:39:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That guy on the BLM side was trying to get the dog removed from his leash. You want to harass ppl with your bs. eventually they get fkin tired of it.
1315130400931418112 2020-10-11 11:21:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HazelnutMatt @DineshDSouza Yet somehow a Trump supporter is shot and killed. The far left has a higher body count than the right does at this point. All leftists...  https://t.co/l8Ak0S7bIe
1315125231510417408 2020-10-11 11:01:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If he doesn’t want to pack the court then why just not say so? Instead he says voters don’t deserve to know until after the election and he doesn’t need to answer that question during an election year. Imagine if Trump responded that way.
1315121803505799169 2020-10-11 10:47:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Today I heard an ad on the radio that said:   Vote NO on blah blah prop because it’s supported by republicans and white supremacists.  At that moment I knew...  https://t.co/yA1pCqjZ94
1315117588645474304 2020-10-11 10:30:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> She can be anti abortion and pro life just like Kavanaugh. What has he done to remove Roe v Wade?  https://t.co/Ol2Qdmj9ea

1315026303859392512 2020-10-11 04:27:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 So once again democrats release criminals back into the population and wonder why they still commit crimes.  https://t.co/FAyyPQEZMy
1315025103902523392 2020-10-11 04:23:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So Biden assumes the only ppl asking about court packing if he gets into office are republicans and somehow THEY don’t deserve to know? Wow. Just wow.   https://t.co/lNP7zDafHo
1314974746195324928 2020-10-11 01:03:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nick85Houston No clue, he’s a full on leftist nutter now. He was a Warren supporter now he supports Biden. 🙄
1314949751830310912 2020-10-10 23:23:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is awesome the medications he got must be working!  https://t.co/zHf6fgbuVi
1314948450648092673 2020-10-10 23:18:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck Yep because Democrats continue to push segregation as a solution to avoid hate.   That’s why black ppl are turning to black supremacy as a solution.
1314947765802156032 2020-10-10 23:15:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How did he crush H1N1 when 60M Americans were infected? Had that been COVID and 1% of Americans had died that would be 600k.
1314946893214965765 2020-10-10 23:12:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 🤣👉🏼 #BidenWillCrushCovid  B*tch what?  https://t.co/1ghnwZiFEJ
1314944091537301505 2020-10-10 23:01:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ranger23x Lmao. Yep. What a buffoon.
1314943310788608000 2020-10-10 22:58:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wrong, the one guy even said, “Trump isn’t your friend, he’s a tyrant.”   So yea you made a mistake.     https://t.co/BDuoOcSWJf
1314942603268251648 2020-10-10 22:55:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How does this prove that one of the kidnappers was a “far right militia terrorist” like you say? It doesn’t.
1314817828978008064 2020-10-10 14:39:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And this is exactly why the majority of Latinos in a Univision poll said Trump won the debate. Latinos like strong personalities with big cojones.
1314816630715604992 2020-10-10 14:34:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fkin insanity. If you still continue to vote for democrats after this then you deserve what you get.
1314815030370562049 2020-10-10 14:28:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @_Charlene_T How she even came in possession of a puppy is beyond me.   She’s fkin evil and should be institutionalized.
1314812710366834688 2020-10-10 14:19:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like Tory Lanez caught a case quicker than Jacob Blake did.  https://t.co/iIc1CL9iG0
1314811803113676802 2020-10-10 14:15:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Congress’s only power via our constitution to remove a President is via impeachment. That didn’t work so in pure leftist fashion they want to change the rules. You can’t just remove a president because you “feel” like they should be.  https://t.co/VUWVy3uitd
1314810985060810752 2020-10-10 14:12:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thewasianeddie @sbw62 @benshapiro Was that before or after Kamala’s honest Abe story?   Or maybe it was when she claimed Trump was calling white supremacists very fine ppl?   Maybe when she said she wasn’t going to ban fracking or raise ppls taxes?
1314810038947471361 2020-10-10 14:08:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m sure you defend @PressSec when ppl like @Acosta are talking over her constantly right?   Or is that just part of the job Bill?
1314808772452216832 2020-10-10 14:03:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NascarHonda @DangerousAbout Lies according to ppl with TDS which is clearly a very reliable source.
1314807975152766976 2020-10-10 14:00:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine if Trump responded like this to questions he was asked by the media?   https://t.co/yKNdnimaLy
1314802743471558656 2020-10-10 13:39:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #JoeLies.. Trump has condemned white supremacy on the record several times. You still haven’t condemned Antifa or disavowed Richard Spencer’s endorsement.
1314801739560747014 2020-10-10 13:35:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Turn CALIFORNIA RED! 🇺🇸
1314801401755623424 2020-10-10 13:34:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 He claims Trump is dividing the country while completely ignoring the divisive hateful rhetoric ppl like him and those on the left have done.   They’ve been more divisive these last 4 yrs than Trump ever has.
1314800091694161920 2020-10-10 13:29:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m about to listen to today’s show, you should to. ☺️  https://t.co/uxL2vzaPpb
1314799176652259328 2020-10-10 13:25:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Haxker7 Well I’m glad Ted Cruz loves this country and didn’t go that route.
1314798764566036485 2020-10-10 13:23:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Those afflicted with TDS will pull every card they can to try and unseat Trump. Why?   https://t.co/Z8rFiD4Vj5
1314796210662731776 2020-10-10 13:13:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hafNorthKorean @realDonaldTrump @joerogan Would he be willing to do an in person podcast event tho?   I’d rather him not be a moderator under the debate commission because they would regulate what could happen.   But then again Spotify has got rogan by the balls.
1314795049218043906 2020-10-10 13:09:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I like this idea... What kind of president will Biden be if he’s not willing to debate? Weak.
1314793818932170752 2020-10-10 13:04:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is that a threat? Hypothetical my ass.
1314793138888691712 2020-10-10 13:01:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Some more bad stuff about to go down”? What are you planning with the establishment Mooch? What was your price? Bet you were cheap.
1314791361934106624 2020-10-10 12:54:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you give props to establishment politicians like Pelosi and Feinstein in CA your brain is made of mush.
1314790454521593856 2020-10-10 12:50:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The consequences when voter rolls aren’t cleaned up regularly and you claim there isn’t a problem with mail-in ballots.
1314788401095172098 2020-10-10 12:42:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is why @FoxNews gets better ratings that you other channels. They actually show the president speaking.  https://t.co/WxWhLOuN8l
1314788021363851265 2020-10-10 12:41:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Can we get term limits for CONGRESS first ffs... y’all be profiting off government like a mfker.
1314776555223093248 2020-10-10 11:55:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @bethreinhard @thamburger You do ppl ever read anything? While you call Trump events “superspreaders” and claim protests are perfectly ok.   “There’s NO EVIDENCE linking the school infections to the WH event”  https://t.co/yAhxpJGCYR
1314775746716475393 2020-10-10 11:52:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So now no one gets infected from COVID unless it’s somehow tied to the WH? 😂 Y’all are a bunch of fkin clowns.
1314774959038767107 2020-10-10 11:49:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lamaccurrach @DailyMail @JackPosobiec @GovRonDeSantis @SenRickScott @TheRickWilson You obviously didn’t read the article.

1314773428080005121 2020-10-10 11:43:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Trump is NOT your friend..he’s a tyrant.” - one of Whitmer’s alleged kidnappers.   Doesn’t sound like a Trump supporter to me. 🤷🏻‍♀️  https://t.co/BDuoOcSWJf
1314771169078247425 2020-10-10 11:34:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonaldTrump if you want a good debate sans Biden. Call @joerogan and have a sit down with him. Let him ask you the questions ppl are curious about.
1314769867656974336 2020-10-10 11:28:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So once again the left’s doxxing and attempt to ruin ppls lives with false accusations surfaces.   https://t.co/yLw8iywhs8
1314768893370482689 2020-10-10 11:25:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So they keep telling us that MASKS prevent COVID contraction for ppl during “protests”, but the potus testing negative with a partition and 12ft apart from Biden somehow isn’t enough. 🙄  https://t.co/mKFNzeJU09
1314699324568133632 2020-10-10 06:48:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Coward.

1314426303995494401 2020-10-09 12:43:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Portland citizen asks a very good question about protests in their citing and if you thought Wheeler was bad get a load of this commie Sarah Iannarone.. Cons should do a write in and get rid of these losers.  https://t.co/2mb0oBuyQu
1314424311998943233 2020-10-09 12:35:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like Yelp just turned to social justice sh*t. This is problematic because who’s going to verify the “racist” behavior? Some crazy leftist who calls everyone racist? There goes looking to Yelp for reviews or alerts
1314420424164343809 2020-10-09 12:20:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SheldSink Excellent point.

1314411485863370759 2020-10-09 11:44:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No one cares if your yapping your trap. We can tell you’re speaking we don’t need a reminder. 🙄
1314411065942274048 2020-10-09 11:43:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r Huh?

1314407530915799040 2020-10-09 11:29:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LadySusette That sound is the creepiest sound I’ve ever heard in my life. It truly haunts me.

The next thing that should happen is Justice Breyer and Thomas should retire if Trump wins a second term.
1314402338333814785 2020-10-09 11:08:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 @politicalFF Ughh I know. I notice errors he makes too. Just like the debate. He needs to not interrupt so much this way Biden can bury himself and then he can throw that last big of dirt on the grave.   I think he’ll do better the next debate because he does listen to his supporters.
1314401667803017217 2020-10-09 11:05:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Omg I’m on twitter in the dark, TV is on and all of a sudden I hear that stupid INSIDIOUS music. I’m scared to death. I fkin hate it. Yet I have to watch.   Why?! 😩 FML!
1314400724466327552 2020-10-09 11:02:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 @politicalFF Yea California really does destroy hopes for the future. Nothing but establishment clowns elected every year while they do nothing but take more and more of our rights away.   So many uninformed and emotional voters in our state. Sucks. Although I am seeing a change.
1314400230448611329 2020-10-09 11:00:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @politicalFF @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 I think there are lots of ppl like you. The silent voter because of how rabid the left is. They are literally out to destroy any Trump supporter they can find.
1314398480714985473 2020-10-09 10:53:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 @politicalFF I know CA might not matter much but for the first time in my area I am seeing ppl posting TRUMP signs in their yards and flying the American flag and I’m really surprised.   I saw a huge TRUMP sign on a hillside driving on the freeway and I just couldn’t believe it. I smiled.
1314397974936473601 2020-10-09 10:51:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 @politicalFF I feel you on that, but imagine if he acted like he was defeated? That he believes the polls that are saying he’s down by 14 pts nationally.   I give him credit. I couldn’t deal with everything he has during his presidency. Its true evil.
1314397393383612416 2020-10-09 10:48:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 @politicalFF It’s tough for us Donk because in CA we really don’t have many good options. Ffs Feinstein is a corpse but if its down to her an a commie and I felt she could lose I’d probably swallow my pride and make sure I voted for her.   I don’t want communism.
1314396480896036866 2020-10-09 10:45:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 @politicalFF So you’re frustrated that he believes that he’s got this election won?   I don’t think he believes that when he’s making this election about making sure to vote in person and motivating ppl to get out and vote.   I think he knows how important this election is.
1314396028838178816 2020-10-09 10:43:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @Troy75801 @politicalFF Imagine if we can have a president that comes thru with most of his promises or parts of them. Then you still have voters say, “well that’s not enough so I’m gonna vote for the guy who’s been in government for 47 yrs makes promises and never comes thru.”
1314376586175475714 2020-10-09 09:26:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Troy75801 @RealBrandonDonk These are all negatives for the Biden ticket. Let’s not forget the radical left like AOC are whispering in the ear of the most liberal senator Harris.   If they win, it won’t be good. It will embolden the left to believe their rioting and destruction worked.
1314376111875186688 2020-10-09 09:24:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Troy75801 @RealBrandonDonk That’s what I think. Plus because this election is so divisive, I don’t think some ppl are willing to come out publicly depending on where they live. That’s how you get a silent majority plus ppl are fed up with the rioting in certain cities. BLM has lost support.
1314374142708211712 2020-10-09 09:16:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk Well because I’d say there are plenty more ppl like me voting for him in this election than in 2016.   I don’t know that Biden has the same kind of enthusiastic support I’ve seen for Trump this election.
1314371955080851458 2020-10-09 09:07:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @HDatawonk Well I don’t know about that. I don’t think Biden could. 😂
1314371272877371392 2020-10-09 09:05:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @HDatawonk None of that reaches ppl outside of twitter and who don’t watch the news.   The Trump campaign has circumvented that by going door to door and speaking with ppl.
1314369567087501312 2020-10-09 08:58:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So @ProjectLincoln is working for @TeamTrump now? 😂 I love infomercials!  https://t.co/7epevQKOZP

1314355744762855424 2020-10-09 08:03:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @HDatawonk Adapt how? Would love to hear your solutions.
1314355225155653633 2020-10-09 08:01:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk @HDatawonk I disagree, but then again Trump has to battle everyone that doesn’t like him in congress and the media daily.
1314353136002244608 2020-10-09 07:53:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @beafreeand Haha me too. I’m just glad he got treatment immediately which made a huge difference. Plus he’s been taking HCQ for months now.

It’s a virus ffs. If you actually knew a doctor you’d know that simple fact.   If Biden gets COVID or any of his staff I’m guessing that makes him stupid too?
1314239811780108293 2020-10-09 00:22:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsBethParker @BeardyMan1983 @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence I still haven’t heard you condemn what BLM protestors did to random ppl eating?   While I WILL condemn any racist rants by anyone regardless of side. Seems like you’re ok with racism as long as it’s whites who are getting harassed and targeted. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1314238250555375616 2020-10-09 00:16:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well isn’t that something?  https://t.co/mtTwlTKNXX

Your ilk are the ones who doxx and harass ppl for not agreeing with them politically.

He was doing a job and on someone’s property. Unlike the random white ppl minding their own business eating being called white supremacists and racists by BLM protestors.
1314233937963614208 2020-10-08 23:59:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 @MsBethParker @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence I’m starting to think the same thing.   Also this person never let us know where this racist hell hole is? Just so we can stay clear.

So she cries about racism is scared to call the cops while she knows you I’m guessing a white lady, has a white devil as a husband and lives in an area where she’s surrounded by racists whites? 😂  Just stop you sound ridiculous.

Or does she only fear cops because all she ever hears is how “cops are hunting down black people in the streets”?

She doesn’t have to choose an area that is mostly white, but I bet she probably did. I wonder why?
1314228596462907392 2020-10-08 23:38:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsBethParker @BeardyMan1983 @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence She can’t call the police? Anyone can call the police and they don’t know your skin color when you call either.   As a doctors wife I’m guessing she doesn’t live in a poor neighborhood.   So tell me where this hell hole she lives is in the US?

If anything minorities have been more racist when they attempt to vilify whites as white supremacists, Nazis and racists because of their skin color.

Does she go out much as a doctors wife during COVID lockdowns?   Say nasty stuff to her face just because her skin is black?   You claimed she believes the US is worse than South Africa while being a doctors wife.
1314223437678698497 2020-10-08 23:17:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsBethParker @BeardyMan1983 @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence Should crime not be an issue when you want to move somewhere?   Hence why I said if she believes she’s safer in South Africa, move. The crime rates there are as high as Chicago’s if not higher.   Thank you for point out the obvious. Democrats run crime ridden cities.

I posted headlines of ppl being shot and killed in Chicago being relative to those of South Africa.   Oh Los Angeles sucks because democrats run it. The crime rate and homelessness there is horrible. It’s why I don’t live there. 😂

I posted statistics showing how South Africa is about as safe as living in Democrat run Chicago.   But if she believes South Africa is better than the US then she can leave. No one is keeping her here.
1314220386356137984 2020-10-08 23:05:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsBethParker @BeardyMan1983 @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence Absolutely correct she should move to where she thinks she’d be happier. If that’s South Africa, she should go and take her whole family with her.   I think America is great and I’m Hispanic.   If she doesn’t she’s free to leave.
1314219876416806913 2020-10-08 23:03:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsBethParker @BeardyMan1983 @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence So his anecdotal experience means nothing and gets put off but yours is somehow gospel?   So you assume he might not know any black ppl?   Ive also met black ppl who say they don’t support BLM because looting, destruction and rioting has taken over the message.
1314219030819950593 2020-10-08 23:00:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsBethParker @BeardyMan1983 @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence So? He can’t go with her if she believes she’d be more comfortable there and she can take her children with her.   If she hates it in the US and fears for her life because of all the racism luckily she has a doctor for a husband and they can afford to move.

1314217492651237377 2020-10-08 22:54:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsBethParker @BeardyMan1983 @sqrutinizer @jlaud_29 @EvanAKilgore @AOC @Mike_Pence Awesome maybe she should. What’s stopping her exactly? Besides I’m sure South Africa could use some doctors and they aren’t at all racist there.   It’s probably as safe as living in Democrat run Chicago.  https://t.co/aQKNIxXuxO
1314098706958884864 2020-10-08 15:02:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @marcusmedina @AOC Kamala put ppl in jail for weed in CA. Now y’all believe she’s gonna legalize it. 😂  https://t.co/5vfGINfXg3
1314098101334929409 2020-10-08 14:59:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden and Kamala have both failed at answering that question. Why? It’s not his own personal question pendeja.
1314095687827558400 2020-10-08 14:50:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Everything you nutters have claimed would happen under a Trump presidency like WWIII hasn’t happened. All this is is fear mongering.
1314094685728636928 2020-10-08 14:46:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Y’all are some miserable fks. You’d hope to look as good as Pence at his age you hateful turd.

1314079758502690816 2020-10-08 13:46:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fact checking the fact checkers:  This gets 🤥🤥🤥  This is not off base. Pence stated had the swine flu been as lethal as COVID the lives lost would have been severe because 60M Americans got infected with H1N1 vs 7M from COVID.
1314078765597650944 2020-10-08 13:42:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fact checking the fact checkers:  This gets 🤥🤥🤥🤥   You don’t know what the Trump plan includes because it hasn’t been disclosed. Also Trump has repeatedly said he plans on protecting pre-existing conditions for Americans.  https://t.co/XhBi76D6fr
1314062869265227777 2020-10-08 12:39:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ashen_prospects @TheBabylonBee Her voice is annoying and has nothing to do with being a woman.
1314062581519114240 2020-10-08 12:38:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you would have preferred the US force Americans traveling from China to remain there for months and not allow them entry? 😂 Y’all were ok with letting in illegals regardless of the pandemic so why not actual Americans?
1314060219803033600 2020-10-08 12:29:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We are dealing with a pandemic and you ppl still want refugees coming in?   Do you know what a refugee is? Some refugees were granted temporary stay in the US. Do you know what the term temporary means?
1314059302798204931 2020-10-08 12:25:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @donbrown @unitedforpdx So what you’re saying is she’s two faced? She condemns violence while also saying being “peaceful” doesn’t get it done. She is advocating for violence for ppl to obtain their political goals just like the Nazis (fascists) did. So she’s a fascist.
1314058238493507585 2020-10-08 12:21:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Backroom06 @TheCensoredRock That’s what’s known as a model.   Stop sexualizing women’s bodies.
1314057542855614465 2020-10-08 12:18:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Translation: Kamala failed and maybe it’s because she’s a woman.  https://t.co/RNiQ78bUGe
1314054191346675712 2020-10-08 12:05:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 She’s definitely not a black American. Black Americans have ancestors that lived through slavery. So they do not like her claiming to be a black American.   Kamala’s family on her fathers side I believe owned slaves.
1314053634791940096 2020-10-08 12:02:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If she “won” why would you need to change a thing?
1314052643333967878 2020-10-08 11:58:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 She is partly maybe like 1/4. Her dad is Jamaican.  https://t.co/4qqOYpOwL6

1314045393231994882 2020-10-08 11:30:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If Biden and Kamala get rid of cash bail would that mean ppl like Chauvin would be out on bail without having to pay a dime?
1314043398072881152 2020-10-08 11:22:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This coming from the man who had to get naked to try to educate ppl he obviously thinks are dumb as rocks about #NakedBallots
1314043082082459650 2020-10-08 11:20:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For the record it’s Vice President Mike Pence to you.
1314041180292747264 2020-10-08 11:13:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake I felt like that too like kamala was allowed to speak until she finished. And she’d cut pence off.

1314037927681290240 2020-10-08 11:00:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jasontake2 Pence did VERY well.
1314037828578283521 2020-10-08 11:00:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AOC What debate did you watch? Pence continued to speak to finish his answers. 😂
1314037519730700288 2020-10-08 10:58:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why can’t kamala answer the one question about packing the court?
1314037285071941632 2020-10-08 10:57:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good shes 0-1.
1314036318729457664 2020-10-08 10:54:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Kamala interrupted as well. Please let’s not go there.
1314036206791880705 2020-10-08 10:53:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are you literally shaking?
1314035965334183938 2020-10-08 10:52:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Pence wanted to finish what he was saying before she interrupted him.
1314035583858032640 2020-10-08 10:51:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Accurate...
1314034637870493698 2020-10-08 10:47:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are you going to ban fracking?   When she says no, she’s lying.   #HarrisLies #Debates2020
1314031857130905600 2020-10-08 10:36:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I thought women wanted to be equal? Pence treated her equally, but ppl hate it. 🤣
1314026585842876416 2020-10-08 10:15:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These questions are fkin one side bullsh*t.   Kamala never answered the packing the Supreme Court question. Talk about not being transparent.
1314018074266234880 2020-10-08 09:41:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whittravis69 @johnkartch If you are afraid an illegal is going to take American jobs never forget who wants them to come into the country and who walks them across our border to virtue signal.  https://t.co/gIywMZAUg3
1314012747781160960 2020-10-08 09:20:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whittravis69 @johnkartch Then those employees should switch jobs. What keeps them there?   They don’t have to stay and the company needs to know that.
1314012350228254721 2020-10-08 09:18:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whittravis69 @johnkartch Well you used that term “fair” wages. So I’m curious what a fair wage is and how are you unable to obtain a fair wage from your employer without a union? All a union does charge you a monthly fee and might not even get you a raise.
1314007853301035009 2020-10-08 09:00:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whittravis69 @johnkartch What’s a “fair” wage? That amount changes for every single person per state and their individual needs.
1314007398835580929 2020-10-08 08:59:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whittravis69 @johnkartch I know some employers with no union who allow employees to self promote which can equal a $7-$10 raise in 2 yrs.
1314007002083852288 2020-10-08 08:57:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I find it odd that the NBA is hemorrhaging money when all we ever hear is how the majority of Americans support BLM. Looks like that’s what they hoped. They were..  https://t.co/xwRAeZOr2i
1314005777581973504 2020-10-08 08:52:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The insanity and to stop. This is Bidens America. No doubt they red pilled the McCloskeys and others that know them after this bs.
1314005160822140928 2020-10-08 08:50:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whittravis69 @johnkartch You are more likely to get raises when you are a good worker and don’t have a union negotiate a fee for you. Some union contract negations could mean waiting 2+ yrs for a raise.

1314000526409752578 2020-10-08 08:31:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MSNBC @AriMelber Let’s not forget this was Biden speaking to firefighters without a mask and not social distancing while he continues to push others to make sure they wear one. His wife has to remind him not to get close to ppl when talking to them too.  https://t.co/L8CGPnbqNX

1313876969830793216 2020-10-08 00:20:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes you are pure evil. In regards to Rosenstein he was following the law. Most lawyers try to use the kids to sway the courts a pretty disgusting act but I’ve seen it done personally.
1313876456125001728 2020-10-08 00:18:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> For @Mike_Pence, when Kamala mentions healthcare for all remind ppl that she’s including undocumented immigrants in that number. And she raised her hand to do just that while she wants to take away private insurances for tax paying Americans.

I mean could it have anything to do with the fact some ppl commit more crimes than others?   Well of course not, never that!
1313682959795326976 2020-10-07 11:29:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wouldn’t that be actual collusion with a foreign government against our own?

1313677287510822912 2020-10-07 11:07:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #VPDebate should be interesting because Pence could drag Kamala on her policy position and past actions  so easily. Remember what Tulsi did to her? Kamala was so flustered.
1313674781619752961 2020-10-07 10:57:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He won’t even answer basic questions. That’s not very transparent.
1313674229758357504 2020-10-07 10:55:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is exactly why he should lose..
1313672293831254016 2020-10-07 10:47:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BuckyBarfbag It seems that Leo was hit with a reality curveball he just never expected and now he’s pissed.   Which I love. It’s so much harder to come out as a Trump supporter than it is to come out in support of Biden.
1313670796804419584 2020-10-07 10:41:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CanisAzureus It’s true and to be honest most ppl say “well Trump just isn’t presidential”. what does that even mean? I don’t need presidential tone + lies. I need a president who’s human and shows strength in the face of challenges for the sake of the American ppl.
1313670092748595203 2020-10-07 10:38:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BuckyBarfbag I was a former lefty, Hispanic and in California. I even supported Hillary in 2016. I am fully on board with Trump in 2020. 🇺🇸
1313669664895950848 2020-10-07 10:37:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is true and Obama was a divisive pos I realized this after I really listened to what he actually had to say and not the tone and manner in which he said them.
1313668639057301505 2020-10-07 10:33:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I love that Leo saw the light! #Trump2020
1313659537790918656 2020-10-07 09:56:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That sounds appropriate. Why would it matter what age their children were? They shouldn’t be coming into the country undocumented and putting their children in harms way.
1313635625044594688 2020-10-07 08:21:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RationalCalm His guitar riffs were the best. 😢
1313602635426013189 2020-10-07 06:10:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Obviously if they are mentioning specific parts of the film.  https://t.co/HHzVig9oY3
1313602130767343616 2020-10-07 06:08:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake She’s gonna be screaming and asking how to cancel Puerto Rico.
1313601513034399744 2020-10-07 06:06:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This makes me so sad.. #RIPEddie 🎸
1313578788781846528 2020-10-07 04:36:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is what it looks like to be a leftist hack media commentator. What’s bs is he thinks he REPORTS the news. 😂
1313559124353851392 2020-10-07 03:17:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And yet ppl still don’t believe CA has changed. Make CALIFORNIA RED!!
1313558684551659520 2020-10-07 03:16:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like you’re giving ppl a reason to believe if “a 74 yr old clinically obese man with COVID-19” can survive this virus then the chances of others doing the same are much higher. That’s awesome news!   Thanks for that Jake.
1313535554458271744 2020-10-07 01:44:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 You have a nice face J don’t let anyone tell ya different.
1313533893543227392 2020-10-07 01:37:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tapper virtue signaling: Look Im a good person and all grownz up I even wear my mask all alone in a room with NO ONE around.   Give you’re self a pat on the back their bud. The bravery...
1313518804995993600 2020-10-07 00:37:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who remembers this while the Biden camp is saying Trump has been reckless about COVID?
1313366045533511680 2020-10-06 14:30:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Coercive control describes a broad range of behaviours that one person (usually a man) uses to intimidate, humiliate, surveil, gaslight and isolate another person.” Of course as you know women are incapable of such things. 🙄 Final thought: This article is so sexist.
1313361800943951872 2020-10-06 14:13:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder who they will attempt to blame when the democrats start testing positive in the next week.
1313356860074848256 2020-10-06 13:54:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Anyone you’d call a friend is an automatic NO. Michiganders don’t need more fascist dictators in office who would violate their constitutional rights.
1313350158780788738 2020-10-06 13:27:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let me remind @JoyAnnReid that @SpeakerPelosi was getting her hair done sans mask and with someone in her face and we heard crickets from Joy on how that was problematic.  https://t.co/h2R2RFJMhB
1313347535302348801 2020-10-06 13:17:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw Lmao John.
1313346099617255424 2020-10-06 13:11:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrNukemCocaine Dude had absolutely ZERO chance once those legs came off.
1313345718380228608 2020-10-06 13:09:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 He’s a leftist...that’s all I got.
1313345084553719808 2020-10-06 13:07:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Oh my goodness he is ripping off his fking legs!” 💀😭 https://t.co/13aYZRkwTk
1313344011285917697 2020-10-06 13:03:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeeMuffy It’s how nightmares are created. 😩
1313343488105181185 2020-10-06 13:01:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The only one’s attempting to ruin Walter Reeds reputation are those who wished ill on the president and are furious it didn’t happen. #TDSNeedsACure!
1313342624783167489 2020-10-06 12:57:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 Acosta is the worst.
1313342466024562689 2020-10-06 12:56:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun No idea, but regardless of the back story it was totally uncalled for.
1313342256707821578 2020-10-06 12:56:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> *throat punch* stfu!   https://t.co/MUg9tCc284
1313329985055191042 2020-10-06 12:07:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes because it can be hard to breathe thru a mask when you’re stuffed up and feel like you need more air.
1313326194884927489 2020-10-06 11:52:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dusm1811 Oh, she’ll be 16 this month.
1313325885995450368 2020-10-06 11:51:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gamer4_q Good lord. 🤦🏻‍♀️ These ppl have some seriously creepy issues.
1313324590337191937 2020-10-06 11:45:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 I don’t even understand how they automatically just believe what this child is saying as gospel.
1313324165215133696 2020-10-06 11:44:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cwill644 I’m just surprised. And to be honest I don’t think my tax payer dollars should be going to allow this parasite the right to appeal and sue anyone.  https://t.co/MAXnnGPCs6
1313323545452142597 2020-10-06 11:41:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who says her mother knows anything  about the president’s health and then told her 16 yr old about it? 😂 Why do you ppl automatically believe a 16yr old who wants nothing but attention?
1313322943351451649 2020-10-06 11:39:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The clownery continues..
1313322821263659008 2020-10-06 11:38:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Y’all being this obsessed with a teenage girl who lashes out to get attention is creepy af.
1313321584329859072 2020-10-06 11:34:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If you believe a 16 yr old over medical professionals you should probably seek the help of a psychologist. She does all this for attention.
1313320847361286144 2020-10-06 11:31:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> From what? 😂 Y’all are clowns.
1313317685573251073 2020-10-06 11:18:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NoStrings_on_Me No idea... why not just give him the death penalty? If he was in the Middle East he would be killed just for protesting the government. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1313314243362525188 2020-10-06 11:04:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 19 yrs later and this individual is trying to sue Trump, Giuliani and Barr for conspiring to cover up who’s really responsible for 9/11 attack. 😂 Ok psycho.  https://t.co/umiBQS8Cy1
1313313123525296128 2020-10-06 11:00:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Katie whether you like it or not TRUMP *IS* the president and everything he does *IS* news. If you don’t like it switch the channel or turn the TV off.
1313311726264172544 2020-10-06 10:54:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I guess Joe needs a reminder on how our government works. The president  is in the executive branch and does NOT legislate. Legislation is created by congress and making it law could involve the judicial branch to determine the constitutional validity if challenged in court.
1313308758760542209 2020-10-06 10:43:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake Cuomo didn’t want to have to do it, but he will all while he does nothing to put a stop to VIOLENT PROTESTORS in the streets.  https://t.co/X6RHHGeXxg

1313308115958329345 2020-10-06 10:40:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BadSkeewbs @TheBasedLiberal Sh*t like that is why some ppl don’t like other ppl and then they get dragged by their fkin weave.
1313303710357880835 2020-10-06 10:22:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So this troglodyte created a bar and restaurant task force to cite ppl for not following mask and social distancing rules, but cut funding for police officers that allowed BLM rioters to destroy property. #LeftistBrilliance at work.
1313302132041285632 2020-10-06 10:16:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Cuando tú pagas por tú propia aseguranza y la de otros entonces puedes comparar. Yo ni quiero pagar por la tuya. Págala tú!

1313266487876960257 2020-10-06 07:55:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deseeded1 It’s just so unnecessary. Why treat your neighbors like this? they weren’t bothering anyone. They were eating peacefully with each other. No music just chillin and these hos bust up their sh*t.   SMFH
1313264881425092608 2020-10-06 07:48:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well this just got a WHOLE more interesting.. some of us already knew this, but some of y’all prefer to remain blind to actual corruption. Hey yo @maddow you gonna have a segment on this or what?
1313264387151425536 2020-10-06 07:46:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Since when can ratchets approach and just start busting up other ppl’s things? B*tch yall wasn’t invited get over it and wheres your masks?  https://t.co/ZpqP6O8jke

So yes if you were trying to say you’re more likely to die in Afghanistan than by cop that would be correct.
1313210399135735808 2020-10-06 04:12:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PiggySan42 @mikeandmemes1 @BeardyMan1983 @Fabulous___Rose @A2ZJIRWINKO @Altsurrealist When did I say that means no one gets shot? That’s a strawman if i ever saw one. I showed you the stats of ppl killed by cops. While ppl like you scream cops are killing black ppl. It’s obvious they are killed less than whites by the numbers.
1313207687220391936 2020-10-06 04:01:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mikeandmemes1 @PiggySan42 @BeardyMan1983 @Fabulous___Rose @A2ZJIRWINKO @Altsurrealist And what’s the difference I’m showing you stats and ppl in this thread claimed ppl being shot daily by cops?   I’ve never been shot by a cop. I wonder why? I wonder what the likelihood of being shot by cops is if I obey the fkin law?   Puzzling I know.
1313204508504158208 2020-10-06 03:48:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mikeandmemes1 @PiggySan42 @BeardyMan1983 @Fabulous___Rose @A2ZJIRWINKO @Altsurrealist 800 unarmed black people? WRONG.   Statistically whites are killed more often by police. Although overall deaths by police officers have decreased significantly. If you factor in unarmed they decrease more.  https://t.co/CtAHSlD4n0

Why do you think news of black people getting shot by cops happens so much? Because the media wants you to believe it happens as much as they say it does. When you are more likely to win the damn lottery then get shot by cops.

You think it’s better to say blacks are oppressed so they can think they are?   Playing mental games to make them feel lesser than?   Imagine if you grew up in a home that told you every day you’d never make it. Wouldn’t you end up believing it?
1313165571857424390 2020-10-06 01:14:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mikeandmemes1 @BeardyMan1983 @Fabulous___Rose @A2ZJIRWINKO @Altsurrealist Oppressed by who? Aren’t they actually oppressed by their own in majority black countries?   If you think black people are oppressed in the US in 2020 you’ve never been anywhere else and don’t read much.
1313163882697953285 2020-10-06 01:07:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Fabulous___Rose @A2ZJIRWINKO @Altsurrealist Well that’s interesting because as someone who grew up in a traditional Hispanic home. I think it’s made me who I am and my traditions as a Hispanic aren’t worthless to me at all.   Also as some who is traditional I am none of the things you listed.
1313163186007240705 2020-10-06 01:04:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Fabulous___Rose @A2ZJIRWINKO @Altsurrealist Well if the problem is longing for something that never existed. I can bring up a lot of non traditional things that do the same.   If someone believes and feels it’s traditional then who are you to claim it’s not?

1313133840240574466 2020-10-05 23:07:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What the judges are actually saying is you can’t avoid the democratic process and not legislate and just decide to give rights to one single group while avoiding the rights of another group under the constitution.   Religious freedom is in the constitution.
1313133762062938112 2020-10-05 23:07:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Has she not been attacked for her religious beliefs? Second the best solution is to have someone who would issue marriage licenses to anyone that requested them without having to fire someone over their religious beliefs. Just like you can’t fire someone for their sexual pref.
1313006338801246211 2020-10-05 14:41:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Relying on the government for money means you become a slave to the government. It’s exactly where the government wants you. Dependent on them so they can control you.   Government: Don’t get a job we’ll pay you to stay home, be single and have kids.
1313004840172228610 2020-10-05 14:35:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The most contracting part: “I believe that the government has a responsibility to care for the people. I’m talking about making ppl self reliant. People able to take care of themselves.”  U don’t become self reliant by depending on the government to fix your life.
1313002418364317699 2020-10-05 14:25:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MysteryNameMys1 Pobrecita. Parece que no entiendes lo más simple.   La palabra es Latino o Latina. La palabra Latinx no existe en nuestro vocabulario. Es un término que usa la gente para no sentirse excluidos cuando no se sienten como hombres o mujeres.
1312986805138911233 2020-10-05 13:23:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is he jeopardizing USSS if he’s wearing a mask and they are wearing N95 respirators like medical staff do? Plus there’s a partition between them. They are well protected more protected than rioters and violent protestors in the street for 100+ days.
1312984776555462658 2020-10-05 13:15:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 And racists.. seriously the left has come full circle.

1312983475813670920 2020-10-05 13:10:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @smileefase1 We knew this..   Leftists: Riots are ok during COVID everyone is safe not social distancing.   Also Leftists: Rallies are COVID super spreaders.
1312980548516634624 2020-10-05 12:58:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The man is behind a glass window in a vehicle with a mask and the left is up in arms: OMG how dare he put his supporters and other staff at risk!!! He doesn’t care about you!!!  https://t.co/QoP49tMQcu
1312976580663152642 2020-10-05 12:43:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> A joy ride? The supporters were outside of Walter Reed waiting for him you hateful crow. Did you expect him to go around them or something?
1312975799427887107 2020-10-05 12:39:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @necktitties79 A purge always does.
1312975738270744576 2020-10-05 12:39:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> His O2 sats could drop and not be a huge deal. It depends on when they recorded the drop. Was he ambulating exerting himself or was he resting. Giving supplemental O2 at the hospital is common it doesn’t mean he would need it at home or long term.
1312974599043203072 2020-10-05 12:35:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @WendyLNDF So sorry for your loss. It’s heartbreaking to lose a pet.
1312973302101549056 2020-10-05 12:30:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EmersenLee You haven’t changed. You’re still gorgeous Em.
1312961404840767498 2020-10-05 11:42:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump kicked COVID ass! #merica 🇺🇸  https://t.co/OtukkAWHAl
1312957742890405889 2020-10-05 11:28:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Prolife_Sam Trump
1312950545485688832 2020-10-05 10:59:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I thought masks and social distancing were the save all? I don’t recall y’all as worried when rioters were yelling in people’s faces with no mask and possibly asymptomatic. Weird how TDS affects logic.
1312949426621566977 2020-10-05 10:55:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sorry military hospitals like Walter Reed aren’t open to the public for a reason. Honestly I don’t think I should pay for your healthcare as a member of Congress. We already pay your salary why can’t you pay for your insurance?
1312948691452325888 2020-10-05 10:52:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What are you going to report exactly that they followed protocol and wore the same masks hospital staff wear around COVID+ patients? Y’all really don’t know sh*t about safe discharges do you.
1312931209807187968 2020-10-05 09:42:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How to write a sh*t opinion piece by @benyt..   A little about Ben: “He joined The New York Times in 2020 after eight years as founding editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.” 😂👍🏼   https://t.co/rTruWTdu3v
1312929485512007680 2020-10-05 09:35:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @FaxProfessor @IngrahamAngle I base that on your claim that Trump would ban Sikhs from coming into the country.   Why would he ban them?
1312928431084978176 2020-10-05 09:31:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @FaxProfessor @IngrahamAngle I don’t think YOU know what a Sikh is.
1312928236221808640 2020-10-05 09:30:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thelightalex I believe you’re being offensive you should probably apologize and shut up.
1312927044666232832 2020-10-05 09:26:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OCpatriot123 Lmaoo.  https://t.co/KleKDBn57y
1312926352417325056 2020-10-05 09:23:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @yashar Everyone has an N95 mask in the vehicle. The president always travels with USSS as it is their duty to protect him at all costs. Medical staff are exposed everyday but now they are concerned about USSS? I’m sure they know the vehicle is equipped with a partition as well. #chill
1312925371931664384 2020-10-05 09:19:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey @dbongino..
1312924534010376193 2020-10-05 09:16:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is there anyway to find out how many times unhinged leftists have made this #25thAmendmentNow hashtag trend?  https://t.co/qINwhqt5Pt
1312923758068330496 2020-10-05 09:13:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m disgusted yet amazed.
1312922990024122369 2020-10-05 09:10:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Justasimian1 Yup. The left is so angry because they lost to someone they shouldn’t have lost to and they blame his supporters. Imagine what it’s gonna be like in 2020 if they lose again?
1312922709655908353 2020-10-05 09:09:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MaybeMouse They often like to use that term because they voted for republicans in the past.   I completely agree mouse she’s not.
1312922456563175427 2020-10-05 09:08:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Will_Is_My_Name @Ja1Ke3 @ColtsFanJlynRN @fleursjardin_ @korren40 @Janak183 @NeilGerardo @brianstelter You didn’t answer his question. Why are you willing to hand over the country to China? American jobs will go over seas. Our PPE shortage had to do with our PPE being manufactured outside of our country and why we had to start producing it ourselves after COVID.  https://t.co/TVLwzKMUVK
1312920943140892672 2020-10-05 09:02:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The nation will never heal as long as leftists are threatening ppl who don’t agree with them politically.
1312917192841732097 2020-10-05 08:47:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake They are insane.
1312915313751543808 2020-10-05 08:39:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl are spazzing out at the sight of Trump supporters and American flags. 😂 They are seriously unhinged.   https://t.co/vCMiz2cSUD
1312914561284993025 2020-10-05 08:36:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sanjep @AndrewFeinberg @carriecordero @lrozen You don’t have to sign anything if you don’t want when you leave AMA.   Also how do you know he left AMA?   The doctor could have signed discharge orders as long as his symptoms had not worsened and patient could quarantine at home. It’s considered a safe discharge.
1312913524033683457 2020-10-05 08:32:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lejarofwoke @venus_parton @ProjectLincoln They are so unhinged. They are damaging the legacy of Lincoln by attaching his name to their bs leftist pandering. #shame
1312913135544659968 2020-10-05 08:30:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThatBearUKnow No idea but it’s creepy.. he even knows the seat she was in? 😳
1312912852714315776 2020-10-05 08:29:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SurrealALincoln @AndrewFeinberg @carriecordero @lrozen Lmaoo  https://t.co/Bok5iLr6GD
1312912241063129088 2020-10-05 08:27:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The @NRA stays winning.. fk you @MayorOfLA! Congrats residents of LA you will be footing the bill for your dumbass mayor.
1312911283633582081 2020-10-05 08:23:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is straight stalker sh*t and creepy af.
1312911003676413952 2020-10-05 08:22:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The lies of @ProjectLincoln are extreme, it’s bordering on libel.
1312910042291609601 2020-10-05 08:18:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ol’ Mary hoping she profits in some way from turning on her family. All she’s done is prove what a horrible person she’s clearly always been.
1312909504376311809 2020-10-05 08:16:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But then again EVERYONE has the legal authority to leave AMA whether you like it or not. So does your TDS often play a part in your medical decision making Dr Wen? If so that’s very concerning.
1312908227554631680 2020-10-05 08:11:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead And just over all dumb af are all signs. 😂
1312905616310984705 2020-10-05 08:01:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Klingenlaufer Of course I remember morons got upset at a Hispanic girl for naming her BLACK dog BLACK in Spanish.   These people are fkin oxygen thieves.
1312905186126356480 2020-10-05 07:59:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MysteryNameMys1 Spanish is now all of a sudden Britain’s official language?   I was talking about leftists wanting to change Spanish numbnuts.   English isn’t a gendered language.  https://t.co/1q3CaZxnS4
1312904694839209985 2020-10-05 07:57:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MysteryNameMys1 I’m a waste of your time ol’ I got 3 whole followers in over a year lookin ass? 😂  https://t.co/rsFHdVjIcf
1312904265237557248 2020-10-05 07:55:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MysteryNameMys1 No asked you to jump in my tweet.. When you say “founder” you mean Gavin McInnes? The man that’s married to a Native American? 😂  https://t.co/YPXZyvOhFO
1312903530789756929 2020-10-05 07:52:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MysteryNameMys1 I’m getting at that lgbt has a problem with gendered language, but will push gendered terms like BOYS in hashtags.   Smells of hypocrisy.. leave my fkin language alone.
1312903276942094337 2020-10-05 07:51:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MysteryNameMys1 Trump didn’t bring up Proud Boys, Biden did during the debate when they asked Trump to call out white supremacy and he asked for a group.   And I know who the actual #ProudBoys are, they are the “white supremacist” who are lead by a Cuban American. 😂  https://t.co/R5HYzHmHny
1312900466724929536 2020-10-05 07:40:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So the leftists want my gendered language Spanish to switch from Latinos to #Latinx but they can push #ProudBoys and all of a sudden there’s no problem with gendered terms?  https://t.co/8khjomeMEs
1312899743178125313 2020-10-05 07:37:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do you know the gender identity of all these people? Maybe some don’t identify as “boys” shouldn’t you respect their gender identity?
1312899234333507585 2020-10-05 07:35:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @wattorney @ChristensonSher @BeingLGBTQPod The gendered term “boys” is offensive.
1312897280073068544 2020-10-05 07:27:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead It’s my fault I tend to not go look at their pages enough. I need to do better.
1312852630603874304 2020-10-05 04:30:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CanisAzureus #ProudXY? #Prouds #ProudBxys I mean the rules change daily.
1312852354551570432 2020-10-05 04:29:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So you mock him for his fake tan and then when his actual skin shows y’all do the same. Damn y’all some miserable fks I swear.
1312851687367819264 2020-10-05 04:26:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Isn’t “BOYS” a gendered term therefore insensitive to the LGBT community as a whole. Shouldn’t it be like ProudX or something?
1312816256555249664 2020-10-05 02:06:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The people did VOTE for their President he was elected in 2016 and serves a term of 4 years and is not officially replaced until Jan 20. Or did you forget that when Obama remained in the WH fulfilling his duties until Inauguration Day?
1312814708232056832 2020-10-05 01:59:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The leftist bigots really don’t like out of their echo chamber.  https://t.co/agVraNJ5vC
1312814209961353216 2020-10-05 01:57:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well in that case they should ask Biden and his staff when they give them a platform after Tara Reid allegations. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1312797609560477698 2020-10-05 00:51:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @docsforsafecare Because they are actively helping patients that’s why.   The fact YOU being up someone’s sex is truly irrelevant.   I’m sure you don’t go into the ER demanding a female help you in every part of your care.   So why bring up something so fkin petty.
1312796439496384514 2020-10-05 00:47:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine So black ppl called out MTV for not playing black music in 1981 while y’all already had BET in 1980? 😂  Black ppl already had a channel dedicated to black artists but still pissed MTV wasn’t playing enough black musicians. Damn that’s greedy.
1312791096326385666 2020-10-05 00:26:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Yep literally not playing black artists on Yo MTV Raps. 😂  Unless of course they weren’t BLACK enough for you..   According to you not black 👇🏼 😂  https://t.co/Veg2UwlLB1
1312783759175897088 2020-10-04 23:56:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine I’m pretty sure ppl were just excited to see music playing and videos but hey segregationists always make things about race including not getting “enough” airtime.   Shit I should be really pissed as a Hispanic we never had our own hour on MTV. lol
1312779425977573377 2020-10-04 23:39:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine What facts? That rap music and hip hop were on channels long before BET?   As much hip hop as they should? So now gotta dedicate a whole channel to it? 😂 Rap had they own hour.  https://t.co/DzaBamT1PL
1312778816125722624 2020-10-04 23:37:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Then why call it the black anthem? That’s mentioning race. Why tie it to race then? So black ppl feel more included while others can feel excluded?   The American anthem doesn’t mention race either.   You know who uses race to describe their anthems? ppl like the KKK.
1312777705574731779 2020-10-04 23:32:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine The first time I ever heard hip hop and rap and watched their videos was on MTV. So claiming they weren’t given the same grace is incorrect.   You just want to justify the need for BET when their was no need but hey it made some ppl very rich so good for them.
1312776833885073408 2020-10-04 23:29:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine No they don’t hurt they are things that can drive division though and it’s usually intentional.   I’m Hispanic. The America anthem sounds more inclusive to me than the black anthem. You seem to be very segregationist. So much so you don’t even consider some black ppl, black.
1312775909309464576 2020-10-04 23:25:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine So tell me when a rival tribe sold a pregnant mother into slavery wouldn’t that mean the child was born into slavery?   Or do they let the child go their separate way once they become a certain age freely?
1312775150320795653 2020-10-04 23:22:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine You: This isn’t about pointing fingers.    Also you: America radicalized slavery.  https://t.co/SenUOyLkHb
1312774719012171778 2020-10-04 23:20:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine But you said Obama is NOT black.   So then why were black folks so excited about his presidency if according to you he’s not even black?   So black folks gonna vote for joe Biden because you know if you don’t YOU AINT BLACK MAN. 😂
1312774140785352705 2020-10-04 23:18:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Who was pathetic towards black folks before Europeans came into the picture? Who sold them to white folks as slaves?   Oh yea other black folks.   You excluded them when you claimed the anthem was BLACK. Not sure how you feel excluded with the term American.
1312773487832961024 2020-10-04 23:16:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Yes people like me are so terrified of the term “black” I’ve used it multiple times. 😂  Sorry no matter how much you’d wish for ppl to have a phobia of terms like black, it’s not gonna happen.   So then Obama really wasn’t the first black president? lol
1312772670648283137 2020-10-04 23:12:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Again why is it called the”black anthem”?   So if ppl started calling the American anthem the “white anthem” and playing it everywhere how would that make you feel? Like you needed your own anthem to offset it?   Why does it have to be the black anthem when it’s just a song?
1312772041620164608 2020-10-04 23:10:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Why do HBCUs exist? What’s the purpose of them?   Why does BET exist? Spanish channels exist because ppl speak a different language. Why did black ppl need their own channel in the US when they speak English?   To segregate themselves?
1312771161294401536 2020-10-04 23:06:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine They weren’t crying because it was the “black anthem” they were merely saying if you have a problem with the American anthem that’s inclusive why would you need to switch it to an anthem that is only for black people? Does it help with racism?   It’s called hypocrisy.
1312770439819665408 2020-10-04 23:03:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine You have the right to your opinion, but let’s remember some ppl preferred to not treat black ppl like humans some died fighting and risking their lives to make sure black people had rights.   If you think I’m here to impress you, you don’t read ppl as well as you think u do.
1312769625571028999 2020-10-04 23:00:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Haha “some typical lefty”? I didn’t even assume you were a lefty at all, but thanks for clarifying that and YOUR side.   I don’t see conservatives getting outraged over the word black. There are lots of BLACK conservatives and you seem to have an issue with that.
1312768291153145856 2020-10-04 22:55:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine And Jesse Peterson is awesome. Again not sure why conservatives/Republicans get a bad wrap they were the ones who did sh*t like this when they didn’t have to.   Seward helped Harriet Tubman.  https://t.co/4CX4igfgon
1312767367772946435 2020-10-04 22:51:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Yea I’ve never seen a conservative get outraged over being called the wrong pronouns or gender but hey maybe I’m wrong.   Also Stacey dash *is* black “Dash is of Bajan, African American and Mexican descent.”  If Stacey isn’t black then Kamala Harris nor Obama are black.
1312622232322011140 2020-10-04 13:15:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 We don’t have to agree. It’s all part of being individuals with different opinions and experiences.   I completely agree, its is a complicated issue.
1312617942043951104 2020-10-04 12:57:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 Thank you you do the same. ☺️
1312615836004229121 2020-10-04 12:49:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 Thanks for the respectful chat. Enjoy your evening. I worked all day today and talking about COVID is tiresome for me.   Again you can believe what you want I’m not hear you convince you of anything. Just giving my personal experience.
1312614900716331008 2020-10-04 12:45:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 Wait so you think ppl aren’t being infected with COVID when they are terminally ill? 😂  Do you think ppl just abandon the terminally ill in their homes with zero visitors? You can be cautious and still contract the virus and in that time before symptoms give it to someone.
1312614298158542849 2020-10-04 12:43:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 That’s why I asked you have you heard of a person with ZERO underlying issues who’s died of COVID?   I personally have maybe run across 1. Everyone else I’ve been aware of from has had underlying issues most unknown at the time to the patient which have affected organs.
1312612834216304643 2020-10-04 12:37:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 I agree, but if the number doesn’t change much from previous years then what?
1312612232501489664 2020-10-04 12:35:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 I’m curious myself.   If we know that 647k ppl died of heart disease in 2017 but in 2020 that number is only 400k and COVID deaths are 200k. What would you think about that?   Like is said if the deaths remain around the same over all at 2M+ then did COVID really chg anything?
1312611378671230978 2020-10-04 12:31:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 Ok so you said he’s fat.. so is obesity an underlying condition?  Yes but the moment he tests positive for COVID has symptoms that now can become the “complication” and reason they died.
1312610513621151744 2020-10-04 12:28:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 So you think someone dying of cancer who gets the flu that their death is attributed to the flu nothing else?
1312609643391148032 2020-10-04 12:25:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 In the graph where COVID is listed what happened respiratory disease people die of every year in the US?   So if the deaths in the US remain around 2M like they have every year then what?  https://t.co/baPdFghw62
1312607695216631809 2020-10-04 12:17:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 Of course they can rise, but is COVID truly the reason ppl that tested positive are dying?   How many cases have you heard of that had ZERO underlying issues were healthy &amp; contracted COVID and died?   2M+ Americans die yearly before we had COVID.  https://t.co/XbQVauzx2A
1312605441440976897 2020-10-04 12:08:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 When a patient tests positive it’s in their history.   Had a patient who was diabetic refused to have dialysis had a heart attack, organs had shutdown for a bit and also needed a transplant. Contracted COVID and later passed.   What reason would give for death?
1312602926150344704 2020-10-04 11:58:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 I’m saying all those NEW CASES don’t equal death for most people.   That’s my whole point. You can have 10,000 new cases and 20 new deaths. Deaths you are told are COVID+ patients, but you don’t know every person’s medical history or their underlying issues.
1312602275106316291 2020-10-04 11:55:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 For instance if you have a person with HIV that has active AIDS and they die after contracting the common cold do we say AIDS killed them or a cold?
1312601536669777920 2020-10-04 11:52:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 No not necessarily.   If you have a person on hospice for instance and they test positive for the virus it will be reported as a COVID death.   The person was already actively dying at home so did COVID actually kill them or was it their over all condition?
1312600753198952448 2020-10-04 11:49:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 The only ppl tested for COVID are those with symptoms. So again positive cases are only of those who have actually been tested and had symptoms.   There are likely a large group of ppl that have already had it and recovered never being tested.
1312600045724684288 2020-10-04 11:46:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 It’s a head up or warning for who? Have you been tested for COVID?
1312599736122109952 2020-10-04 11:45:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 You really try to over analyze what I’m saying.   It’s simple more cases don’t = equal death.   Meaning if there are 5000 new cases NO ALL those NEW CASES of ppl won’t die in two weeks. Some won’t even require hospitalization.
1312599079831040000 2020-10-04 11:43:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 It’s a virus. Working at the hospital I also know that ppl are saying someone died from “COVID complications” while not giving out additional medical issues. I know about the underlying medical issues that made them more susceptible to the virus. 2M+ Americans die yearly.  https://t.co/3ScCIn1CVn
1312597226342899712 2020-10-04 11:35:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 Correct, but I’m saying the rise in COVID “cases” doesn’t mean all those new cases will die.   So hence contracting the virus doesn’t mean YOU will die. Most ppl have recovered. So trying to scare ppl by saying there’s been a rise in cases is simply that to scare ppl.
1312596566331408385 2020-10-04 11:33:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 You must be part of the 1/3 that gets their facts from memes.
1312594912483794945 2020-10-04 11:26:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DickChibbles @sheldon_unseen @stillgray Because one side actually respects the law while the other doesn’t.   Garcetti is a pos. Cops should stop protecting him and his home.
1312594626637832192 2020-10-04 11:25:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kongoring3 I don’t hate him.. I think he’s a perfect example of how being born in the US and having a talent like his can get you a lot. He should feel lucky he was born here and instead he talks sh*t. He’s a privileged black man whether he wants to admit it or not.

1312592984928522240 2020-10-04 11:18:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kongoring3 When ppl like LeBron stop claiming ppl are oppressed because of the color of their skin it will stop.   Obviously that’s not the case, he’s a perfect example.
1312592563757486080 2020-10-04 11:17:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDonkeyFishn @HoaxBuster6 I get my facts from working at a hospital numbnuts.   I never said more testing. I said more cases don’t equal deaths. If you have 10,000 new cases &amp; only 1 death from those cases that means the likelihood of decreases. I know math is hard for some.
1312591659943616512 2020-10-04 11:13:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wouldn’t using this gendered hashtag #ProudBoys be insensitive and exclusionary to other LGBT groups?
1312589535046324224 2020-10-04 11:05:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Patriots please stay out of the street. There are leftist actively waiting for an opportunity to harm you.
1312589056396587008 2020-10-04 11:03:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So oppressed.. look how badly black people are treated in the US. Shame really.
1312588799893856256 2020-10-04 11:02:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @stillgray And they arrested the Trump supporter for what? 🤦🏻‍♀️
1312587772322959360 2020-10-04 10:58:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s the fkin president you turd! He gets tested daily. This is a military hospital, you know the same military that leftists in congress want to defund.  https://t.co/s4QxM7nbnN
1312587284034674688 2020-10-04 10:56:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Stop with this already.. if you don’t have a problem with protestors out in the streets for months, NOT social distancing while yelling in the faces of counter protestors or spitting on cops you really don’t have a moral leg to stand on.

He’s against building low income housing in the suburbs, if you believe only poc live in low income housing, that’s YOUR racism not Trumps.
1312581470746112004 2020-10-04 10:33:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HoaxBuster6 I have no idea, but needs to be repeated often.   They say a rise in cases like that’s a bad thing. It’s just proof that more and more ppl have gotten the virus and will be in the recovered column. Which will then offset the death numbers and decrease the over all death rate.
1312579900478431233 2020-10-04 10:26:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Cases don’t = death

1312429333105893376 2020-10-04 00:28:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer Oh definitely I can agree with that.
1312417945289551874 2020-10-03 23:43:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer Nope, why would I post the article if I believed that.   Here’s the thing. The pope could have gone into Chile saying he was going to investigate the situation. He didn’t have to take sides. Instead he came out defending the clergy which he chose to do.
1312410912087658496 2020-10-03 23:15:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer You claimed “he’s never defended the clergy” for sexual abuse.   I just showed you he did, he admitted to it and later apologized.   So it wasn’t a smear merely the truth and something the pope admitted to doing.
1312410381101350914 2020-10-03 23:13:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer He admitted to defending those who committed sexual abuse which is what I stated. I never said he didn’t claim he had made a “grave mistake”. Which he did.
1312408659582840832 2020-10-03 23:06:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoshD0110 Omg I had no idea horses would do this 😩

Clearly arresting a poc for assault is racist because they never committed a real crime it’s just a white Jewish person they assaulted.

1312184599695425536 2020-10-03 08:16:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Again you are equating a degree with intelligence. We all know that’s not the case.   How many degrees do you have?
1312184044176564225 2020-10-03 08:13:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Nope.. and yet I know 3 languages and know how to spell dummies.   Shocking I know. Intelligence isn’t determined by degrees one collects.   There have been very smart ppl that dropped out of college and been very successful.
1312183294235078656 2020-10-03 08:10:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone I can speak 3 languages as well. What does that have to do with anything?   I’m not the one claiming I’m better than other ppl and making mistakes like misspelling dummies.
1312182981885259776 2020-10-03 08:09:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone College degrees don’t equate to being educated. Ppl can get degrees for almost anything. 😂  Also pay attention to the specifics. It says immigrants. Asians don’t necessarily come to the US to get educated. They have a pretty good education system and spend lots of money on it.
1312182010018848769 2020-10-03 08:05:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone So can you tell me why your African doctors come to the US and don’t stay in their country to save their own ppl?   Also being a doctor from Nigeria doesn’t equate to Africans being the most educated.   You don’t even know how to spell dummies. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Im gonna take your mamas advice.
1312181381775028224 2020-10-03 08:03:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone And? Does that change the fact that Asians are the most educated in the US?  https://t.co/0zaMCzmW8u
1312181166175211522 2020-10-03 08:02:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Yes Nigerians, Somalians, Haitians and Kenyans live in America.   Not ALL black ppl are from Africa. Some come from Trinidad, Jamaica and Dominican Republic. 🤷🏻‍♀️  So again not sure what you are trying to claim.
1312180132585504768 2020-10-03 07:58:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Proud? I’m saying Asians because it’s a fact. Looks like that might have hurt you a bit.
1312179601804677120 2020-10-03 07:56:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone We all were if you wanna go that far back. At least that’s what “our” bible tells us. 😂

1312178698942963712 2020-10-03 07:52:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone She told you that often did she? Sorry, but I can’t blame your mama. I feel her pain.

1312177862300987395 2020-10-03 07:49:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Also Hispanics do not make up the majority of Americans. Do you know how math works at all? So 40% of Hispanic eligible voters isn’t as much as you’d think. 😂 Good grief please just stop you seem ignorant as hell.  https://t.co/RibJEDAR22

Well at least you admit it. 🤷🏻‍♀️   Here you are talking about OUR elections looking like a complete clown because you don’t know sh*t about how ppl vote in our country.   You can judge all you want we aren’t the racist bigots.  https://t.co/ss4VWtxwq6

Hispanics mostly voted for Hillary. Do you know anything about our elections or just pretend you do? 😂 How embarrassing for you.  https://t.co/DxWa2C1UHT
1312174709430124547 2020-10-03 07:36:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone If he is what does that matter? So you’re a racist and a bigot? Wow I’m shocked.   Are you an American citizen?
1312174364322787328 2020-10-03 07:35:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone They are weak how exactly? Specifics please..
1312171102815178752 2020-10-03 07:22:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 @Katniss360 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone As a Hispanic I liked Obama as well. Until I realized how divisive his words were after listening to him clearly and ignoring the nice way he spoke.   Obama brings up race way too much to not be a racist.
1312170508343898113 2020-10-03 07:20:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone I’m actually Hispanic, but then again I don’t deny facts. 76% of ppl that voted in 2008 were white..yes white. If Obama has not been able to get 43% of the white vote he would have lost.   Again I’m not the racist. While you sure seem to be.
1312169803692478465 2020-10-03 07:17:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone I thought you liked facts? Are you saying white ppl didn’t vote for Obama in 2008 or 2012?   Here’s exit polling.. fact is without that 43% of whites Obama got he would have lost.  https://t.co/qMNQMul8uG
1312167205082025984 2020-10-03 07:06:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Really? So who are you voting for for president?  Also why would it matter what color Jesus’s skin is as long as you are saved?   Imagine going up to Jesus and being like, “nope sorry you are NOT pigmented enough to be may savior.”
1312166563378683904 2020-10-03 07:04:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Nope it doesn’t matter that Obama was black. If it did he wouldn’t have won the presidency.   See the reality is without the white vote (60% + of the population) you can’t win. It’s mathematically impossible.
1312166061865721856 2020-10-03 07:02:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone I’m not the one that claimed he was white, but I’m also not the one who claimed he was black. Which was also wrong.   If you feel like you won something because you were as wrong as those who claim that he was white congrats.
1312165626849312768 2020-10-03 07:00:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> All these lawyers stay breaking the fkin law.. What were they thinking?  https://t.co/LLf5MXWuQb
1312163574756700160 2020-10-03 06:52:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ok I ♥️ seeing @bias_jack’s little dog avi in my mentions. That little guys face always makes me smile.
1312162403258302465 2020-10-03 06:47:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He’s the president so of course precautions are taken. He is likely going to have an eval to make sure everything is ok.
1312161413746442240 2020-10-03 06:43:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Katniss360 @BeardyMan1983 @TucciTellsIt @frfrankpavone Haha he wasn’t black.. if anything he was Arab looking. So yes darker skinned, but not black.   The only ppl I ever hear spew this mess are the black Hebrew Israelites who are racist.
1312160284501442560 2020-10-03 06:39:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Acosta He’s just not that into you bruh. #chill
1312160108042809345 2020-10-03 06:38:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tryxie1010 I seriously am perfectly ok. I live my life happy. These ppl are fkin miserable every waking moment it’s a mental illness.
1312158930492039168 2020-10-03 06:34:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No, just those of you who live miserable every day since he won the presidency and are fkin insane.
1312158593001553920 2020-10-03 06:32:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You’re the creepiest fkin stalker ever.
1312156807171727362 2020-10-03 06:25:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Suck it @GovWhitmer!  https://t.co/6OIjSQlhDK
1312152594454781958 2020-10-03 06:08:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The WH has not failed to observe protocol. If ppl are social distanced a mask is NOT required. Good grief.
1312151569052229632 2020-10-03 06:04:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun Bro was struggling to break a twig. 😂
1312102898403176449 2020-10-03 02:51:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kach022 True AK.
1312093891248615426 2020-10-03 02:15:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The media is obsessed with black crime? 😂 Please stop making excuses for criminals NOT all black ppl turn to crime due to their economic situation or use movements to loot and destroy property.
1312072308228411392 2020-10-03 00:49:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Well you obviously don’t deal with conservatives all the time if you think you’re gonna hurt feelings by giving your honest opinion.   Conservative black people.  https://t.co/Ht1tLfg12c
1312070508205076480 2020-10-03 00:42:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So @JoeBiden just confirmed he and his wife Jill have tested negative for COVID. Biden during the debate no mask. Dr Fauci during a baseball game no mask, quit with the fkin virtue signaling bs.  https://t.co/jQKkmHta5M
1312065695065108480 2020-10-03 00:23:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine Ok so how can you tell someone isn’t a conservative? I mean since you claim these signs are so obvious not sure how they would be offensive.
1312065220655771648 2020-10-03 00:21:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThatBearUKnow Lmaooo. 💀 That one needs a trim.
1312062790836707328 2020-10-03 00:12:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gameoverman7 True but I love exposing these liars.
1312062351693148165 2020-10-03 00:10:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThatBearUKnow As a woman I wouldn’t be able to reach the buttons with my vagina. 😂
1312061726725033984 2020-10-03 00:07:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TayeCocaine @EddyGriffin14 I’m curious how can YOU tell? What are the obvious characteristics of a black republican?
1312060866238402560 2020-10-03 00:04:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Goodness boys.. staahp!
1312060455578263559 2020-10-03 00:02:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe you should verify things before looking like a bag of d*ck cheese.  https://t.co/Sc4cc5xRiY
1312058995327160322 2020-10-02 23:56:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob @HokuRae808 Wtf was he banned for?
1312058516757049345 2020-10-02 23:55:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ChrisMurphyCT is a certified pos.
1312057612133822464 2020-10-02 23:51:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I don’t believe a single word @SpeakerPelosi or @SenSchumer have said about wishing the president a quick recovery while they vilify him and call him a racist at every turn.   These *ARE* politicians. Two faced establishment pieces of sh*t.
1312056838175690754 2020-10-02 23:48:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This ignorant cow thinks talking thru masks during a debate while standing 20ft + away from each other is necessary. It’s a VIRUS yes ppl get infected. 99% survival rate!!
1312056251338035201 2020-10-02 23:46:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Which is it Jen? You want ppl to respect the COVID rules or you want to claim obeying the COVID rules makes Pence look weak?   This woman claims she’s a conservative.. that is the biggest joke I’ve ever heard in my fkin life! 🤣
1312055536418877443 2020-10-02 23:43:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wrong... I’m sure there are plenty of asymptomatic ppl out protesting that haven’t even been tested because they’ve had ZERO symptoms. Once he tests negative he can hit the trail again.. while Biden prefers to stay in the basement.
1312054930757230593 2020-10-02 23:40:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like Trump will make the debate no problem as will Pence.
1312054288068222981 2020-10-02 23:38:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Mary pandering again hoping it gets her paid. Don’t pretend like you care about anyone but yourself. Even after your father died here you are years later demanding what YOU think you deserve from your grandfather’s inheritance. Pretty disgusting.
1312052010246500353 2020-10-02 23:29:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 She’s still too lefty for my taste, but she’s obviously a good person.   I mean the establishment Dems attacked her as a “Russian asset” for going after Kamala Harris.   Just proves they will label anyone a Russian asset to vilify them.
1312051350255988737 2020-10-02 23:26:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @FLOTUS came off better than the woman who decided to secretly record her. CNN lies again.. the family separation wasn’t a NEW policy it was the law according to the Flores agreement, but then CNN isn’t a real news outlet.
1312050034360217600 2020-10-02 23:21:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> *call. Ffs. Although I’m sure y’all figured it out. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1312049744227659776 2020-10-02 23:20:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OvertonGaslight Lmaoo. 💀 Thats perfect.
1312045365185531904 2020-10-02 23:02:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m happy that she was finally sentenced, even tho 6 yrs doesn’t seem adequate for the crimes committed by this woman. #NXIVM Maybe we should go riot and destroy cities to show our disapproval.  https://t.co/24fMmMqYLG
1311934250095054848 2020-10-02 15:41:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Class act.. thank you Tulsi.
1311920397751742464 2020-10-02 14:46:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake Right? Yet somehow he’s going to prison for life according to some leftist who has done their own taxes for years which I’m sure they’ve never taken write offs for anything.
1311919973086883841 2020-10-02 14:44:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So I’m on YouTube about to listen to Tim Pool and this video comes up of Tim from 14 yrs ago skateboarding in a Chicago Warehouse. @Timcast do you still board?
1311916729270898688 2020-10-02 14:31:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer @jackiedubois00 @Hung_Hippo @BC_SquadronOne @NathanBrandWA @TheLastRefuge2 You did say senile my stupid phone switched it to senior! 🤦🏻‍♀️ I fkin hate this phone.
1311916190596362240 2020-10-02 14:29:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake We have to keep in mind it was the NYT. 😂 Im just curious what law Trump broke that would get him life in prison for getting his own money back.
1311915795279015938 2020-10-02 14:27:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer @jackiedubois00 @Hung_Hippo @BC_SquadronOne @NathanBrandWA @TheLastRefuge2 I lol’d at Socialist Senior Sniffer. 😂

1311914106878746624 2020-10-02 14:21:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jackiedubois00 @Hung_Hippo @BC_SquadronOne @NathanBrandWA @TheLastRefuge2 So then tell me do you pay quarterly taxes? Do you take legal deductions available to you by the government for business expenses? Do you own property which you are allowed to depreciate? Do you own multiple million dollar buildings you can take deductions on?
1311913379859066880 2020-10-02 14:18:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These are the same ppl who claim to be morally superior than everyone else. This hate is exactly why I no longer want anything to do with the left.
1311906983327330304 2020-10-02 13:52:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jackiedubois00 @Hung_Hippo @BC_SquadronOne @NathanBrandWA @TheLastRefuge2 Going to jail for life for what? You leftists are really oblivious about regular taxes work so trying to explain business taxes to ppl like would just be a waste of time.   Y’all don’t even know the difference between state and federal taxes.

1311889815323910145 2020-10-02 12:44:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DavidMiller603 @realDonaldTrump I don’t hold Cuomo accountable for deaths from a virus because I’m not an idiot. I hold him accountable for mandating nursing facilities take COVID+ patients and forcing other ppl to be exposed to them.   The president shutdown the country and Pelosi was telling them this..  https://t.co/vm5VXvk1Zn
1311884033425469441 2020-10-02 12:21:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whole_9_meters Ol’ Stares at hammers is a fkin bad ass.
1311881172280958976 2020-10-02 12:10:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake And with COVID you’ll still have the left saying “seeking asylum isn’t illegal” for moral reasons.   So now COVID among undocumented ppl entering the country illegally and protestors is perfectly ok for the left.  https://t.co/8kNYMAAJPG
1311880151341264896 2020-10-02 12:06:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco Lmao seriously?!
1311880008894279681 2020-10-02 12:05:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @whole_9_meters Either.
1311879967056117760 2020-10-02 12:05:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MsCristinaDrake I don’t even know what to say. How did that baby stay on that after the whiplash?! 😩

1311878313397284872 2020-10-02 11:58:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You know who will? The Mexican federal police. They aren’t like the US they will shoot your ass.  https://t.co/G7r3y01EIb
1311876737790164992 2020-10-02 11:52:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @__DJWilson @realDonaldTrump I think weak republicans have pushed him to do it. They fell for the left demanding he disavow. His supporters don’t care because it’s a broken fkin record by the left. Trump would actually like the patriotic Proud Boys unlike the fascist scum that is Antifa.
1311875201412472832 2020-10-02 11:46:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Living in a Democrat run city like yours is literally a death sentence. #Trump2020 🇺🇸  https://t.co/41I1EaTdec
1311874232985423872 2020-10-02 11:42:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How does one intimidate someone from voting by mail? 😂 This is a felony but we have ppl assaulting officers that are released in 24hrs by Democrats?  https://t.co/PnvQNXt0ON
1311873659972190209 2020-10-02 11:40:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Just FYI #ProudBoys know that backing Trump is the only option. Giving Trump haters an inch is not an option. @realDonaldTrump doesn’t need to condemn white supremacy more than he already has.

1311869934146744320 2020-10-02 11:25:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DavidMiller603 @realDonaldTrump Blaming Trump for a virus that originated in FKIN CHINA is the most ignorant fkin thing I’ve seen.    Cuomo has more blame considering he FORCED nursing homes to take in COVID+ patients via his mandate.

Never a damn question about anything that matters to normal Americans.   I’m hoping this ACB process gets done quicker with all the Dems defusing to meet with her. Fk em
1311853601543712768 2020-10-02 10:20:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And @PressSec admitted to her mistake live so what’s the issue?

I live in CA and I’ve been to skid row. It’s a fkin sh*thole. Would you rather ppl be more specific by naming the specific areas?

1311732141193977856 2020-10-02 02:18:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cpm5280 Oh it already did. I supported Hillary in 2016. I full support Trump in 2020.   Thanks to ppl just like you. ☺️ So again, thank you for being a constant reminder.
1311731744358363136 2020-10-02 02:16:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I laughed so hard when I saw it. I thought I’d share... 🤣 😭  https://t.co/m4HHacesBa

1311730755790229504 2020-10-02 02:12:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cpm5280 The fact you had to put your pronouns in your bio kinda tells me everything I need to know.
1311730542937665536 2020-10-02 02:11:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cpm5280 So care to answer any of my questions so you can get debamboozled?   Or do you always avoid legit questions while claiming others are the ones who are “bamboozled”?
1311723649464819712 2020-10-02 01:44:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cpm5280 How? I’ll ask you some simple questions.   1. Does the government earn money?  2. Is the government funded by tax payers?  3. What actual good has come from the government but make ppl dependent on them?
1311722960437178368 2020-10-02 01:41:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Make sure as a voter YOU know who you are voting for. That R doesn’t mean a damn thing if the policies aren’t aligned.  https://t.co/p83Qxy3cFq

1311721396666466305 2020-10-02 01:35:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TMalkier @johnrobertsFox It’s unbelievable they tell him to repeat the same sh*t over and over and @GOP @SenateGOP playing right into that sh*t asking him to clarify.   This is why Republicans get called out. Instead of just saying he has done it several times they cave to the left’s bully tactics.
1311719168547319808 2020-10-02 01:26:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Loduv2417 @johnrobertsFox And still they would be like, “Thats ambiguous and unclear why doesn’t he just come out and say it specifically?! Is it because he’s racist?!”  https://t.co/26VPG6rT81
1311718672986062848 2020-10-02 01:24:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Say what? A straight white woman is now a “modern version” of a “GAY ICON”? What a slap in the face of the LGBT community.

John mentioned his wife was “attacked” so I’m guessing this is where it’s shows with this bogus claim of failing to denounce it by name. 🙄
1311695392065511426 2020-10-01 23:52:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Omg. Fox News @johnrobertsFox saying Trump needs to denounce white supremacy. Wondering why Trump isn’t specifically saying he denounces white supremacy and using those words. Good lord how many fkin times does he need to say it and in how many different ways?!
1311689341828165632 2020-10-01 23:28:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ksorbs @theblaze You have ppl wanting to remove professors for giving his opinion on “black privilege”, but this man threatening physical violence is allowed to stay?

1311563166787092486 2020-10-01 15:06:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This election isn’t just Trump vs Biden. It’s:   Trump vs. Communism Trump vs. GND   Trump vs. UBI  Trump vs. more government Trump vs. M4A  Trump vs. College indoctrination at the cost of tax payers  Sitting this election out is not an option. Too much is at stake.
1311557503738552321 2020-10-01 14:44:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AdrianEngGast They were there to support Edgar Flores, a Democrat who of course supports Biden. These are probably all family or friends. 😂 This definitely wasn’t some roll out of support for Biden by Latinos. I’m sure Edgar organized it.  https://t.co/xBBTfpNjbh
1311554259561795585 2020-10-01 14:31:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Honestly I had to do a double take reading this, I thought it was a parody.
1311553692148006913 2020-10-01 14:29:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ewww no and I’m a Trump supporter too. So yes it’s that bad.
1311553260688273411 2020-10-01 14:27:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> At this point wouldn’t everyone have had it then? Pushing the “super spreader” idea just means that it’s likely very few haven’t contracted the virus and the fear y’all keep pushing is just fear mongering.

These ppl have gotten away with things for so long they just figured they could keep doing it with no problems.

If I believe you said something wrong but you don’t should you have to apologize because someone else thought it was?   I don’t apologize for things just because others have a problem with it. That’s a phony apology.

Again you ignoring the fact that some ppl do live in some pretty bad areas even in the US is willfully ignorant.   You think ppl on skid row think they live the glamorous life?

You obviously like to ignore the obvious because you think it’s moral in someway when it’s more moral to accept that not everyone lives like Americans do.

1311427329759956993 2020-10-01 06:06:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This stuff doesn’t happen with private healthcare because they have  utilization review that are well staffed to make sure they aren’t paying MORE then required. When the government is playing with YOUR money why would they care? Oh they care when they finally notice.
1311424157221965824 2020-10-01 05:54:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yet somehow ppl still believe government controlled healthcare is the best option. The government is who is paying these amounts out let’s not forget that.

That’s like saying if the Trump campaign disavows white supremacy all day Trump never has to. Because according to you The Trump campaign IS Trump, right?   Trump has disavowed white supremacy multiple times. Imagine asking the same question thinking that chngs.

Es que nosotros necesitamos a un macho como presidente no un pobre anciano que cambia su posición cada vez que mira que a la gente no le gusta. Imagínate tratar de negociar con China o los Rusos. 🤦🏻‍♀️ olvídalo!

He’s been telling the American ppl what they want to hear and doing the opposite because he’s a politician. His job is to convince you while he actually does NOTHING.
1311388044646215680 2020-10-01 03:30:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NoMoreWinning @itsreallyrocio @joshmendez79 @Hung_Hippo @DamianRanger1 @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Tell me where Biden disavowed Richard Spencer’s endorsement or disavowed the violence of Antifa? Even when asked yesterday Biden refused to do it by name why?   Biden said Antifa was an idea not an organization. That only changes when it polls negatively because he’s a politician

Maybe you should look it up.   I find it funny you call anyone else racist while using the term nopalero, but ok.
1311377676108574721 2020-10-01 02:49:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Have you ever worked at a hospital?
1311365222527975425 2020-10-01 02:00:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So what you’re saying Canadians are racist?
1311355155921600512 2020-10-01 01:20:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 The baby faces crack me up. 🤣
1311350433529565184 2020-10-01 01:01:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m 💀 🤣
1311332948168196096 2020-09-30 23:51:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Mejor cállate Jorge tú sabes que a los hispanos les gusta los MACHOS.
1311324042570289152 2020-09-30 23:16:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJ97241889 Did I stutter? Yes ppl like you.
1311322566217199616 2020-09-30 23:10:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Let me question this pos I’d do a better job and shut his lying ass down.
1311320620257308672 2020-09-30 23:02:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SenatorLeahy is bringing up COVID deaths and some other political bs at this Comey hearing? Fkin worthless.
1311319853265895424 2020-09-30 22:59:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The nerve of this pos Comey saying that Flynn lies to the FBI. When he knows damn well he never lied. Now we find out that when Comey spoke with Trump he could have mentioned that the Flynn investigation would end on Jan 4, 2017.   Did Comey try to set up Trump?
1311317672089378816 2020-09-30 22:51:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If manafort was a counter intelligence threat like you just stated @SenFeinstein then why did Comey fail to investigate Hillary if her campaign had actually paid Russian intelligence via Steele for the dossier?
1311316003268096001 2020-09-30 22:44:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Comey is under oath.. he’s lied multiple times at this point playing dumb isn’t gonna get you out of this you pos.
1311313421900550144 2020-09-30 22:34:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJ97241889 She’s not distressed. Didn’t you notice how quickly her tone changed after she was asked that question?   As a woman I can tell you that was all for show to try to get their way and to get ppl like you to chime in and yes it was hilarious.
1311193318739513344 2020-09-30 14:37:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Jeni’s the elitist politician ice cream.  https://t.co/WdkbyBk1tz
1311192182225645568 2020-09-30 14:32:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Twisted accurately describes you.
1311186046487461890 2020-09-30 14:08:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And I had no problem with this response. Unlike when Biden was asked about Antifa he said they weren’t an organization but an “idea”.

1311181416512720896 2020-09-30 13:49:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 They are literally slandering a dead man.
1311181170478993409 2020-09-30 13:48:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Maybe Mike Wallace had no control over this debate because he’s fkin dead.
1311180498509508608 2020-09-30 13:46:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Honestly tho these ppl vote? 🤦🏻‍♀️
1311179979296706561 2020-09-30 13:44:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @chris_b4 Omg I LOL’d when I read that.
1311179671912898560 2020-09-30 13:42:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> All these blue checks have ZERO clue who actually moderated this debate.
1311178437592195073 2020-09-30 13:37:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Breaking: Mike Wallace has returned from the dead to moderate the Trump/Biden #debate.
1311177669522812928 2020-09-30 13:34:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m guessing he’s not the only one who feels this way either. 🤣
1311177364571787264 2020-09-30 13:33:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @james3sons @BernardGoldberg The left never does.. so why should we?
1311176806691553280 2020-09-30 13:31:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hunter Biden profiting off his father being VP getting money from China and Russia was bad enough could you imagine what that would be like if he was president? Nothing but quid pro quos every damn day.
1311175781301628929 2020-09-30 13:27:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @monterolaw lol I see you!

1311172987517771776 2020-09-30 13:16:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tell me April did you get assaulted and hospitalized like @MrAndyNgo did by Antifa? So your biggest fear was ppl knowing where you live while Antifa has doxxed and assaulted reporters for doing nothing, but recording video?
1311170754461925378 2020-09-30 13:07:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AJyanksatlas Why do they want Biden to hide until Election Day? That’s not a good look for a president. It shows weakness.
1311170315796361216 2020-09-30 13:05:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hey yo @aprilaser why did you delete this? No #ProudBoy is interested in where you live stop lying.  https://t.co/XNpgHSOw6J
1311169433235124224 2020-09-30 13:02:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weekly town halls where Biden is given questions in advance by his supporters and can then provide  prepped answers? 😂
1311167431172263936 2020-09-30 12:54:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaooo. Where in China?
1311163330745122816 2020-09-30 12:37:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tambee14 @POdVet @CassandraRules No they are Latinos. Hispanics is particular to Spanish speaking countries. Latinos includes all Spanish speaking countries and Brazil that speaks Portuguese.
1311162605893951489 2020-09-30 12:35:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Cyborg1966 Every time I hear him bring up Beau I cringe. I’m like, “Here we go again. let him Rest In Peace ffs.”
1311160814653456384 2020-09-30 12:27:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @miketaylor6895 @VOfficial96 @funder Yes insulting other Biden supporters because they have an opinion that doesn’t agree with yours is a very smart tactic. Keep it up.
1311159805633937408 2020-09-30 12:23:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CNNisALie @POdVet @CassandraRules Probably like when Hispanics think every Asian is Chinese.   Mira El Chino. If a Hispanic has slanted small eyes they might get nicknamed El Chino too. 😂
1311158607912644616 2020-09-30 12:19:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump already denounced white supremacists. While democrats call ANTIFA the people burning down their cities an “idea” and a “myth”.
1311158123810308096 2020-09-30 12:17:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I want to see @joerogan moderate.
1311156427549933568 2020-09-30 12:10:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @thehill Biden is a politician, never forget that. He will tell you what you want to hear as soon as it polls negatively. So you might have to wait a week or so.   One of the most politician type statements I’ve heard is, “Whatever I say I’m gonna do, I do.” -Joe Biden
1311154906296758272 2020-09-30 12:04:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw Compa! I love my hispanic peeps.

1311150523022626816 2020-09-30 11:46:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw That’s not true John, Biden said so.
1311150406102167554 2020-09-30 11:46:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck @LoneStarTexian That Hispanics appreciate MEN with big ol’ cojones. 😂
1311150089243471873 2020-09-30 11:45:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GTrevise8 Haha. Basically it’s like saying we appreciate MEN with balls.

1311136390541762560 2020-09-30 10:50:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kayenmo @moodyredhead Yes and I totally get that. I’d get frustrated with it as well. Nothing but lies and he’s just supposed to stand there and take it.   Trump needs to let Biden mess up. I think his interruptions helped Biden not have to answer certain questions.
1311135844346945537 2020-09-30 10:48:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LizzerMack Of course not. I mean I don’t think I’ve ever heard Biden talk about his son Beau more than when he wants out of an uncomfortable situation.
1311135463516717058 2020-09-30 10:47:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @syl_capulet1 @who_am_i_3005 Oh I always have romantic feelings about you Lys. 😘
1311135177331019776 2020-09-30 10:46:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead @kayenmo That’s what I was saying the whole time. Just let Biden fumble.. a Trump often saved him from it with interruptions.
1311134794084884480 2020-09-30 10:44:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LadySusette Because Biden knows talking about Hunter doesn’t help him. It’s like he only has one son and that’s Beau.
1311133526150926337 2020-09-30 10:39:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RuriIroLobo Then when Trump brings up Hunter, Biden laughs and says claims Hunter getting $3.5M from Russians is a lie.
1311127797088223233 2020-09-30 10:16:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who’s fact checking Biden because holy sh*t the lies.   Every time Biden is losing he tries to get sympathy and he brings up Beau.
1311126537094135811 2020-09-30 10:11:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Sfahey_imp @GOPChairwoman Here’s some info... Some facts about low income earners, they pay less taxes overall.  https://t.co/DOG1qP0HS6
1311125087408463876 2020-09-30 10:05:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Sfahey_imp @GOPChairwoman Not sure what you don’t understand about getting rid of the Trump tax cuts will affect 82% of Americans.   Not sure why you attach $400k to that.
1311124041848160256 2020-09-30 10:01:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> We have 47 years of your “accomplishments” Joe.
1311123421296652288 2020-09-30 09:59:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea I’m sure Biden would have preferred to stay in his basement.
1311120058375049216 2020-09-30 09:45:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden: “I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts.”   Yes, that affects 82% of Americans.   #debates
1311119239147696128 2020-09-30 09:42:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sound_nobody He calls you “Harpo” and “garbage” because you won’t blindly agree?  https://t.co/ZavHAcpx3d
1311118567627132928 2020-09-30 09:40:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I had no idea twitter polls could tell you who’s voting? I thought you wanted democracy and ppl to retweet to reach more ppl? Has that changed because the results aren’t what you’d like them to be?
1311117823511465984 2020-09-30 09:37:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Biden you have much smaller events.   Trump: That’s because people don’t show up.  https://t.co/TwyuLVja9X

1311115885176782849 2020-09-30 09:29:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeyaFong @GOPChairwoman Biden said he would get rid of Trump tax cuts and that would affect 82% of Americans.
1311115703634731008 2020-09-30 09:28:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump reduced taxes for the middle class. Getting rid of Trump tax cuts like Biden stayed would affect 82% of Americans.
1311115157951533068 2020-09-30 09:26:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Every time Trump gets under Biden’s skin Biden laughs you try to brush it off.
1311114662004404225 2020-09-30 09:24:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not a good look @MSNBC lol
1311114227537469440 2020-09-30 09:22:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Both Kamala and Biden have refused to answer if they would pack the court or remove the filibuster if they won. Why?

1311108623775330304 2020-09-30 09:00:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @politico These are the ppl on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I’d love to know who voted against declassifying these documents. Also if they weren’t important why were they “classified” in the first place?  https://t.co/cPvy37hZmy
1311107732099883008 2020-09-30 08:56:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The poll is getting close. #VOTE
1311107528500019200 2020-09-30 08:56:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The enthusiasm gap has not changed. Ppl are NOT enthusiastic about having to vote for Biden even after adding Kamala Harris.  #Debates2020

1311105819857960962 2020-09-30 08:49:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Robert E. Mook is an American political strategist. He was the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.” It was all about their political strategy. They must have seen something in their internal polling that required a back up plan.

1311039671258943488 2020-09-30 04:26:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> As if we didn’t already know these ppl were corrupt as sh*t and would do anything to win. Look at the @nytimes coming out with a story about Trump taxes and Biden having a commercial about it hours later. 🙄 These criminals coordinate everything.
1311038785908482048 2020-09-30 04:22:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Caligula? 😂 You have lost your damn mind. The only ppl threatening the opposition with revenge if Trump wins is the left. Trump has been president and literally NONE of the things the left claimed he would do happened, NONE!
1311018099370389504 2020-09-30 03:00:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’ve run up to men who smell good and said, “Oh my you smell so good what’s cologne is that?” and sniffed them and the air as I walk away.  https://t.co/UBv1cGuzKI
1311016425138479104 2020-09-30 02:54:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So is this the only type of slander globalists can come up with? Sounds like democrats are worried that Trump might have gained MORE support from black voters than they’d like. 😂  https://t.co/UxYVhzwoMl

1310789881900101632 2020-09-29 11:53:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The ppl had the power in 2016 when they nominated Trump as POTUS and during the midterms when the ppl gave Republicans a majority in the senate.   So yes THE PEOPLE have the power at the ballot box.
1310783874935345153 2020-09-29 11:30:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PaulCHanson1 Lol of course. Everything about these ppl screams lame af.

1310783351951773696 2020-09-29 11:27:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea let me know when those ppl who have paid more in taxes have  multiple properties, businesses and employ 1000s of ppl. I’ve paid more in taxes but then I’m not an idiot who thinks business owners don’t pay other taxes I don’t have to.  https://t.co/vKA1CHzLgX
1310782748022382593 2020-09-29 11:25:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> $1M in 3 yrs while not taking a government salary? 😂 As if leftists in congress don’t spend tax payer money while still collecting a check while not working.
1310768298095603712 2020-09-29 10:28:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This has to be one of the saddest things I’ve seen. 😔  https://t.co/8jo6ZiEA1O
1310767085245444098 2020-09-29 10:23:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #Debates2020 it’s sad that most of us set the bar so low for Biden that if he remembers the basics we will give him credit for it.   And that has nothing to do with anything Trump has said. It’s from just watching him speak. CNN did him no favors at their townhall.
1310766070660132864 2020-09-29 10:19:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @brianstelter called himself a “media reporter”, in what fkin world?
1310765344328278017 2020-09-29 10:16:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MDeez92 @redwins3_first They want to martyr themselves. Because you know the moment something actually goes down they decry how the right are terrorists and fascist who assault ppl.
1310764880182431744 2020-09-29 10:14:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Look at him... you know he’d flinch and get into the fetal position if confronted.

Can you tell me what services Hunter Biden provided that would get him $3.5M from Putin fans?
1310763071246225408 2020-09-29 10:07:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I thought using any part of Pocahontas to identify someone is racist? Has that rule changed? ✍🏼

1310695047487041539 2020-09-29 05:37:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You believe this doesn’t happen in the black community or something?
1310493243356798977 2020-09-28 16:15:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LLinda_W Again how did he “evade” taxes? Just seeing what he paid doesn’t mean he evaded taxes or he did anything illegal.   Does it say he inflated his businesses or devalued his properties in an illegal way?

So again I’m asking who has been FORCED to have a child by the government?   I don’t care what the situation is in other countries I don’t vote there and don’t have a say in what happens. I’m speaking about the US only.
1310490721426706437 2020-09-28 16:05:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt So now you are claiming something that you claim isn’t living deserves a murder charge all because the non living thing was wanted by someone?   You can’t murder something that isn’t considered a living thing.
1310489998932631552 2020-09-28 16:02:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Again who was “forced” to have their babies because limits gestation on abortions were suggested in certain states? You seem to be misinformed.    https://t.co/FFlsi0uVyo
1310488838704214018 2020-09-28 15:57:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Where are they “forcing” women to NOT have abortions?
1310488676606963712 2020-09-28 15:57:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Are babies not living? It’s very odd you find more value of life in animals than you do for human beings.   Isn’t putting a dog down a choice? You’re ok with choices right?   Is it immoral to put a dog down just because you don’t want them? Do dogs not have bodily autonomy?
1310487541645103104 2020-09-28 15:52:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Is justice served when her baby is killed and now the mother is possibly unable to have any other children due to the attack?   According to you her baby wasn’t a life. By your logic regardless if she wanted the baby it’s life doesn’t begin until they are born.
1310486780362194944 2020-09-28 15:49:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt The polar opposite of what is happening?   I mentioned China forcing abortions on women. No one is forcing women via legislation to get pregnant and have babies in the US.
1310486118337376256 2020-09-28 15:46:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt If being against killing babies makes some women feel demonized then that’s their issue not mine. I believe it’s immoral to kill babies. I guess you don’t agree.   If I say I’m against killing dogs just because you no longer want them does that demonize all dog owners?
1310485075696300032 2020-09-28 15:42:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt So then if a pregnant woman is stabbed in the belly and kills her 38 week old fetus that shouldn’t be murder right?   Because according to you they aren’t a life until birth.   I don’t agree with killing babies for whatever reason women want.
1310484143143231488 2020-09-28 15:39:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt ✌🏼 Remember you jumped on my tweet not the other way around.   I wasn’t giving my opinion to change yours. I’m just not willing to support the immoral act of killing babies for whatever reason a woman gives.
1310482952178954240 2020-09-28 15:34:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt So do you often dehumanize fetal humans down to clumps of cells so you don’t feel guilty about being ok with killing them?   Here’s a baby at 6 wks and heart is visible. 91% of abortions are done up to 13 weeks.  https://t.co/rFaUZ5n3wz
1310480997515841536 2020-09-28 15:26:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CUinNov @chris_b4 Lol why do you trust Cohen? Just because he dislikes Trump? He admitted to lying to congress. 😂  https://t.co/QVf2dFHzOs
1310480271997718528 2020-09-28 15:23:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Actually as a pro life person I wouldn’t say we are against an abortion if the mother’s life is at risk medically.   But just like the other VERY RARE. Pro abortionists want to be able to have abortions for whatever reason that’s where we have a problem.
1310479150738669573 2020-09-28 15:19:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yet he worked for him for years.. if he was such a slime why stay at all?
1310478876762501120 2020-09-28 15:18:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> There’s a difference between evasion and using the tax code legally to get tax deductions. Also Michael Cohen doesn’t own real estate or employ thousands of ppl. 😂 c’mon man.
1310478058973884417 2020-09-28 15:14:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt So are you saying women should be allowed abortions in these rare cases?   Do you know that would be less than 1% and I don’t think pro life ppl would disagree in these limited and rare instances. The problem is that’s not the case.
1310476929712099328 2020-09-28 15:10:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt The fetus has a visible heartbeat by 6 weeks. Does this look like a clump of cells to you?  https://t.co/NfglbZ9Tia
1310476286402256896 2020-09-28 15:07:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt I’m saying you take birth control + have your partner wear a condom.   Plan B is if you’re worried you don’t take the pill and your partners condom broke. Plan B is supposed to be taken after an instance like this.
1310475819546943489 2020-09-28 15:05:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt I’m not arguing for adoption. I’m arguing for earlier sterilization being allowed for women who don’t want children ever versus worrying about having an unwanted pregnancy.   If you are 18 and want an ablation it should be allowed medically.
1310474883390828552 2020-09-28 15:02:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Ppl love to give all the excuses to have an abortion why not give reasons of how it isn’t necessary?
1310474557447262208 2020-09-28 15:00:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt There is Plan B and it’s sold over the counter. Also why not take the pill and make your partner wear a condom to make extra sure an unwanted pregnancy doesn’t happen?
1310474168899530752 2020-09-28 14:59:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt I sent you an article of how downs babies are being eliminated because ppl don’t want them.   You’re not pro choice. You’re pro abortion. Because the only “choice” you are giving an unwanted fetus is death and dismemberment via abortion. What other CHOICES are there?
1310473403833307138 2020-09-28 14:56:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Are we animals that have no control over our reproductive system that we need to use abortions to get rid of viable humans because, “I made a mistake”?
1310472937636392960 2020-09-28 14:54:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt So essentially you are saying you’re ok with animals being put down by owners because they don’t want them anymore correct? Putting healthy animals down because you can’t afford them anymore? How about taking your dog to have an abortion because you don’t want puppies?
1310472117369045001 2020-09-28 14:51:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt So tell me how a child that has downs of missing limbs can’t have a quality life while your animal can?   No one is talking about serious conditions where the child is not viable or will suffer. Most abortions are just because they aren’t wanted.
1310471363421855744 2020-09-28 14:48:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KateLouisePerr1 @ldluglio @andytoronto @MargaretAtwood @USSupremeCourt Also gendered abortions have happened in the US. Some states passed legislation to prevent it from happening but of course there are loopholes. Women can get around it by just claiming it’s because they can’t afford the child and don’t want it.    https://t.co/SvOEb5aCQ0

Because of course allowing them to live means they’d have poor quality of life and ultimately suffer further right?

That black people already enslaved whites but you’re excusing it with but they had to “in self defense”.   So is slavery bad or not?

1310408429874282501 2020-09-28 10:38:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Fomdb1 @hassandavis @latimes Aww we’re ignorant, but you seemed to ignore the fact blacks enslaved white Christians once. It’s funny y’all are the only ones that cry about being enslaved when history reveals every race has been enslaved at one point.   Who do you think sold black Africans to whites?
1310406199553056768 2020-09-28 10:29:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Fomdb1 @hassandavis @latimes Well that already happened...Can we talk about Black people still enslaving Black people in 2020 tho?    https://t.co/0bGBc4iazZ

1310374275635793922 2020-09-28 08:22:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait, but I thought y’all said he didn’t pay ANY taxes and how he’s making money from being president so which is it?
1310373547135496192 2020-09-28 08:19:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ranger23x I just want to show their obvious hypocrisy.. you know me. 😏 Proof that most of the ppl POLLED are leftists.  https://t.co/sNyNgeU19N

Apple, Google, Amazon and most of their employees are leftists. Why don’t you get their money? Where’s the BLM “donation” money going? Can we tax Jacob Blake for the millions he got?
1310372483459985409 2020-09-28 08:15:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The leftist sheep clearly don’t understand how taxes work.
1310371957985034240 2020-09-28 08:13:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you pay excess taxes for the year you get a refund. Unless you are attempting to claim he paid ZERO taxes and got an excess of what he paid from the federal government. Can we see your taxes Bernie?
1310370869080780801 2020-09-28 08:08:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 It’s fake but I have no doubt leftists would be ok with it.

If Obama would have had a Democrat majority senate I have no doubt they would have placed Garland in a heartbeat. So don’t give @senatemajldr sh*t for doing his job for a Republican POTUS. 🖕🏼 #FillTheSeat  https://t.co/35VC40iVGo

1310367010740555776 2020-09-28 07:53:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ranger23x @KerJTalit They benefit from those tax breaks as well and they know damn well they do. Another smear campaign by the left to try to destroy a duly elected POTUS. What are they afraid of? I thought they had this election in the bag? Oh there “backup” plan just in case.
1310366524742352897 2020-09-28 07:51:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KerJTalit Oh an you know there will be some. I wouldn’t doubt they planned this sh*t with ZERO evidence just like last time. Just some BS accusation released by the WaPo last time this time it’s the NYTimes.
1310362085990096897 2020-09-28 07:34:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KerJTalit They seem to forget accountants who do taxes exist. Although I’m not sure these are his actual taxes I find it hilarious they release it now likely as a stepping stone to Dems to start impeachment again.
1310361686356848640 2020-09-28 07:32:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Is this like when @Ilhan paid her now husband millions or naw?  https://t.co/UWV6GKMnQr
1310360448097607680 2020-09-28 07:27:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So the big exclusive is that Trump paid taxes, he’s losing money and employs people? 😂 Heaven forbid!

I’m not sure how calling whites racist and disparaging Trump supporters of color as “lost causes” helps your side at all.

His response: Well Im not saying it’s unconstitutional, it’s constitutional but some of the things in the constitution are dumb.   These ppl hate our constitution.
1310286123655073792 2020-09-28 02:32:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The ACA didn’t create insurance. It was a way for more government control over our lives and health. The insurance companies that provide benefits via the ACA don’t cease to exist if ACA does. Republicans plan on a replacement to include pre-existing conditions.
1310283887218536448 2020-09-28 02:23:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @OvertonGaslight Oh I’m sure there has been. They aren’t trans. He’s a gay man 55 who is in a relationship with his daughters ex boyfriend who’s 23. Both male.. the baby was born via surrogate and we all know how the left hates women being USED as “human incubators” for men.

The population of Texas 29M &amp; 15k dead from COVID thats less than .06% in deaths. Now let’s look at the counties that have the most cases &amp; deaths.. and see how they vote.

No protests at your home no harassment.   If the left actually showed KINDNESS &amp; RESPECT they wouldn’t be attacking a woman for merely being a mother and religious because she’s a Trump nominee.

1310244722556895233 2020-09-27 23:47:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TiffanyDCross on @msnbc: white supremacist groups and racism has been increasing since 2009.   Reality: The only way Obama could win the presidency is with the white vote.   So this whole racism bs kinda doesn’t have a leg to stand on.

1310067734886010880 2020-09-27 12:04:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because leftists are always out to please the loud minority mob with promises they KNOW they won’t make happen. Then they shift blame and say, “Well see wha happen was y’all misunderstood us” because they realized the actual majority doesn’t agree.
1310065602585788418 2020-09-27 11:55:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Here you have the @Lakers putting the name of a man who’s been accused of digitally raping a woman, kidnapping her children while also stealing her car. So don’t let these ppl ever claim they care about women. They’ll clearly sh*t on a woman for social justice.  https://t.co/oT2i4ONtA4
1310064365941346305 2020-09-27 11:50:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ScryingGlass Cover them in manure like the pieces of sh*t they are.

1310061556613353473 2020-09-27 11:39:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealPhilJones1 Yea fake imaginary laws don’t count.
1310061397355589632 2020-09-27 11:39:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump supporters need to stay tf off the streets when protesting. I know you’re trying to give leftists a taste of their own medicine, but we don’t need more ppl killed by the radical fascist terrorist left.  https://t.co/y4gbk7Y2xW
1310060427712163848 2020-09-27 11:35:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 Nope and does it matter if they are? They get released immediately to do the same sh*t 24 hrs later.
1310060264163700736 2020-09-27 11:34:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What actual law did the man break?
1310059570677514240 2020-09-27 11:31:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Dgrunt65 @FemineJud @thehill Only according to the hypocritical left.

1310058721167376384 2020-09-27 11:28:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is assault and the moment they are arrested or get pepper sprayed they cry like the b*tches they are.
1310057516391264257 2020-09-27 11:23:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MichaelRapaport @Breaking911 If those 9 were for Biden then what? No big deal?
1310052455204360192 2020-09-27 11:03:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Once again trying to negate the will of the ppl if they don’t win. Isn’t this the authoritarianism they accuse the right of?
1310051591852945408 2020-09-27 11:00:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So leftists are questioning the adoption of Haitian children by ACB into a nuclear family, but are completely silent on this?
1310043277563891712 2020-09-27 10:27:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Spewing partisan nonsense like this is why the left gets owned constantly.

1310036014912565248 2020-09-27 09:58:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead Is he against sweaters and hats for children? I don’t get wtf he’s arguing.
1310035332105084928 2020-09-27 09:55:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead The virtue signaling is so off the charts with these fks.
1310034902574723072 2020-09-27 09:53:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jenn_Pastrak Again your own tweet says the information could be “reliable” yet there are questions? Is that too difficult to understand for Canadians?   I hope you never have a condition that requires you to be seen immediately if this information is at all true. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1310034072341626880 2020-09-27 09:50:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> In this video Pence asks the children, “Are they taking good care of you here?”  The children: Yes.   But of course it’s a vile video because this man expects these kids to deal with 100° weather while in McAllen and not have air conditioning.
1310032522470764550 2020-09-27 09:44:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeyNada76 No Trump supporter gives af about Biden/Harris posters or stickers. It’s a fkin election year. 😂  To be honest when I see them I roll my eyes and laugh.
1310030642894127104 2020-09-27 09:36:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jenn_Pastrak So pointing out that the info “could be reliable” but there are questions doesn’t really go with your push off of the info as just opinion because it’s paid for by the Koch brothers now does it?   Don’t tell me these ppl are paid by the Koch brothers too?  https://t.co/fHFKOjqZ2e

That the information about wait times in Canada that the institute collected is fake? 😂  Good grief you Canadians are truly brain dead. I think we need a northern wall.
1310024192251764738 2020-09-27 09:11:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jenn_Pastrak @KrystlePrivott @sahilkapur How was I telling you how your healthcare works? I asked you how it works you troglodyte.

1310007248400211968 2020-09-27 08:04:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How is a nominee illegitimate? The constitution gives the president the authority to nominate someone. It’s up to the senate to confirm. Was Merrick Garland an illegitimate Supreme Court nominee as well you clown?
1310006582470537216 2020-09-27 08:01:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kennbartlett @thehill Sorry if you’re too much of a fkin simpleton to see the issue with the children of the former VP using his name to get money from Russia and China. I wonder what the trade off was? Because I’m sure Hunter’s coked out ass didn’t get millions for absolutely nothing.
1310005511689924608 2020-09-27 07:57:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kennbartlett @thehill How is it a distraction? You brought up Russia being an issue. I say Hunter Biden was paid millions by Russians and you clowns claim its to change the topic. I thought your topic was the problem with Russia and ppl being bought by them?    https://t.co/zdnVhwRAdl

1309945597370064897 2020-09-27 03:59:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Isn’t this the same tactic the left has been using by calling Trump a racist and white supremacist? 🤔  https://t.co/JE3nUA7dIo
1309943800593182720 2020-09-27 03:51:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are you under the impression that women aren’t capable of doing both?

1309930955537149954 2020-09-27 03:00:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> A word to my fellow Americans: Voting for Trump doesn’t mean you agree with every position he holds or that you can’t oppose decisions he makes as president. It just means that you're prioritizing the Constitution, truth &amp; decency that the left has failed to show for 3 yrs.

Just remember we have laws here that don’t allow ppl to get away with stuff like this if anything was actually done illegally.
1309907630165377024 2020-09-27 01:28:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk I’m Hispanic and it truly is a cultural thing and some ppl are very ignorant on certain subjects. It’s very common for Hispanics in countries like Mexico to not have completed elementary school or know how to read or write.
1309906722908041217 2020-09-27 01:24:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk Correct you would try to convince them, but at the same time you can’t make ppl do anything. You can discharge the patient have them sign documents and after they’ve claimed they understand everything and the next day return to their country. Can’t stop them.
1309906177245888513 2020-09-27 01:22:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk We can’t force anyone to have procedures or take treatments. Doctors have to obtain consents for surgeries and treatments that patients sign. You have rights as a patient, those medical laws don’t change because you are undocumented in the US.
1309905339760869377 2020-09-27 01:19:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk 1. Well here’s the thing. If a doctor gives a diagnoses of cancer and you explain completely, then ask them if they understand and they say yes,  then they make the decision to return to their country because they believe that they can be cured by herbs or prayers what do you do?
1309904376954122240 2020-09-27 01:15:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk You have to understand the facility is run by ICE, but they aren’t medical at all. They have doctors come in to screen patients to make sure they are healthy medically. They don’t want someone to die for failure to diagnose an obvious issue.
1309903478974636032 2020-09-27 01:11:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk No worries I don’t take things too personal on here. I just want ppl who are pushing this “forced hysterectomy” thing to understand what could have happened.   If the doctor did something illegal of course I want his license revoked so he can’t ever do this to anyone again.
1309902481330040833 2020-09-27 01:07:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk 2. I had to translate for a doctor who needed me to tell a patient they were a “NEW DIABETIC”. I am fluent in Spanish. I explained throughly, diet and meds. Their response, “I think I’ll go back to my town in Mexico because they don’t have that (diabetes) there.” 🤦🏻‍♀️
1309901782768709632 2020-09-27 01:04:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk 1. You have to understand that some ppl who come across the border illegally aren’t very educated you could explain throughly and they could still fail to understand completely. I work in a hospital I’ll give you an example of their medical ignorance.
1309901279272017921 2020-09-27 01:02:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco Right?! If someone like Amy saves Haitian children as a religious woman it’s wrong, but no one questions why celebrities do it?
1309900785367396352 2020-09-27 01:00:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The ppl of #metoo attacking a woman for adopting Haitian children while defending a man that digitally raped a woman and was kidnapping her children is the most disgusting type of hypocrisy I’ve ever seen in my life.
1309893972630925313 2020-09-27 00:33:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left is disgusting. Already questioning why Amy adopted Haitian children. Why don’t they question any of the celebrities that did the same?
1309890776352976899 2020-09-27 00:21:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk First answer my question.   Second.. Who said it was a “majority of women” this was happening to? It was one location and one specific doctor doing the surgeries according to the article. “Only 2 were performed there.”   https://t.co/DJF8xxHd9B
1309889549162536960 2020-09-27 00:16:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The fascist Antifa clowns burning down Portland, assaulting officers and PLANNING VIOLENCE for over 100 days don’t get this kind of treatment from ppl like Amy, why?   #ProudBoysArentAHateGroup
1309724690055745536 2020-09-26 13:21:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Bloomberg paid for Biden’s ad buy for $6M in Florida and fkin crickets from you ppl.
1309724127322714113 2020-09-26 13:19:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Have we heard anything new about this black man being murdered or does his life only matter to the left and BLM when they can use black deaths for political gain and profit?
1309688345031708673 2020-09-26 10:56:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JaayRuga @adam22 A man has a stroke on live tv and you post this? Tf is wrong with you?
1309683103124738048 2020-09-26 10:35:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Angel52940270 @BeardyMan1983 @sandytoze @cnnbrk Forced? I don’t think any of the women were FORCED..they were convinced and likely signed consents.   If you’re an undocumented immigrant and are told after your physical that you have a mass or irregular uterus and it could be cancerous.. what would you do?
1309552391679741954 2020-09-26 01:56:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HoaxBuster6 Haha. True, women can be unpredictable. Yea I said it.
1309551999268958208 2020-09-26 01:55:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Cabron!
1309551844218138626 2020-09-26 01:54:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I love these... 😂
1309551466047176704 2020-09-26 01:52:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The weather..
1309551367963328513 2020-09-26 01:52:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I never thought it was funny. I think he needs to retire and take care of himself.
1309548053045469184 2020-09-26 01:39:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kennbartlett @thehill So you’re an ass clown? Good to know.   YOU mentioned Russia yet I bring up Russia and Biden’s son and all of a sudden Russia doesn’t matter. It’s funny.
1309544833111846912 2020-09-26 01:26:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ReleaseUrReturn @thehill What “facts” are you talking about?
1309544655806029827 2020-09-26 01:25:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ReleaseUrReturn @thehill Here you go..players stood for the black anthem but kneeled for our national anthem.   https://t.co/WgTQzIKAlB

1309531006454525953 2020-09-26 00:31:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ReleaseUrReturn @thehill Maybe if we didn’t have ppl wanting to sing the black anthem vs the American anthem we could.   Maybe if ppl didn’t want to tear down our history and recreate it how they want we could.
1309530643215212544 2020-09-26 00:30:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kennbartlett @thehill And Hunter Biden was paid $2.3M by Russia for heaven knows what.
1309530448276500480 2020-09-26 00:29:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @pszalai123 @thehill Since when is saying this country is racist...truth?   Since when is pushing divisiveness and hate in schools...truth?   Teach THE FKIN non political curriculum!   You ppl disgust me!

1309373258232291328 2020-09-25 14:04:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AbleWlng Lmaoo.
1309373183758274562 2020-09-25 14:04:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> On today’s episode of Man vs Vehicle:
1309344789725282304 2020-09-25 12:11:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ChrisTharpExpat @LoneStarMama4 @JRubinBlogger Every interesting assumption by a garbage leftist. Just don’t forget ALL your insults got you Trump for 4 yrs and you’re about to get 4 more.
1309338681493209088 2020-09-25 11:47:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @monterolaw @pnjaban @NurseKV These cops have their hands tied their mayors have set them up to be assaulted. Just horrible.
1309325548552822789 2020-09-25 10:55:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Natronics1 @thehill How many times do we have to tell you leftists the US is NOT a democracy, WE ARE a constitutional republic!   Do they teach you ppl nothing? All you do is parrot the left and look dumb as hell.
1309304750861512704 2020-09-25 09:32:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This might get good... 😌🍿
1309301798163759104 2020-09-25 09:20:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Vote y’all..
1309301054924754947 2020-09-25 09:17:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 It was her grandfather’s money. She doesn’t have any right to it just for being kin.   Where do ppl get the idea they do?   You don’t have to leave shit to anyone. You can donate it all if you want too.
1309298654398701568 2020-09-25 09:08:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk Bye bye Almond Joy.
1309298412865556480 2020-09-25 09:07:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoo once again proving all her to efforts were because she was salty over not getting the inheritance she “believed” she deserved. Some b*tches stay greedy.
1309297219107872769 2020-09-25 09:02:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @realDevinDuncan @Breaking911 Oh we do support term limits, but why not congress first? Besides the Supreme Court isn’t political. They are there to uphold the law according to OUR constitution, nothing more.  https://t.co/zn4qE6XV8n
1309262501297532928 2020-09-25 06:44:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> True, and we aren’t the ones pushing for communism.
1309250420892561408 2020-09-25 05:56:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do you mean like when the leftist pundits go on CNN &amp; MSNBC and call Trump &amp; his supporters racists and Nazis?   Everything the left says is crazy. Antifa is a myth. Everything is fine here.  https://t.co/Fd2bT5k3Bb
1309228569365590016 2020-09-25 04:29:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion I just wish he would just admit he didn’t have proof..instead he went the route of “I don’t have to provide proof..I’d rather leave it in limbo” attitude and I set out to show him how much of a problem that is.   Because it’s what ppl do all the time.
1309219377242275840 2020-09-25 03:53:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M That’s good to know. Jigz is a sweetheart.
1309211638260666368 2020-09-25 03:22:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Soma4M Awww yes thanks I’m good. Hope you are well too 😘
1309210122284011520 2020-09-25 03:16:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why are you always so divisive? You can’t use words like “Trumpists” and “national nightmare” and think you seem bipartisan at all. YOUR hate filled words have caused this.. it’s why the media ratings are tanking.
1309207429595369477 2020-09-25 03:05:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion @aaron_skiles12 Of course not because he started with insults when he was backed in a corner and asked to provide proof for what he was claiming then said...  He thinks it’s more fun to leave things in limbo.  https://t.co/6vfgWGFNjy
1309206134536896512 2020-09-25 03:00:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @93MINDOFMINE @Deseeded1 @Hurrica32761115 @pi_mij @laceysculls Because I know him.
1309205989145473024 2020-09-25 03:00:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion @aaron_skiles12 Funny is I wasn’t even responding to him when I said what I said. I gave it as an example to you, but c’est la vie.  https://t.co/bjum4XWEy3
1309204761116160000 2020-09-25 02:55:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 @KidConfusion Yea maybe re-read what I said.   I gave it as an example of how ppl can make claims with ZERO evidence.. it has nothing to do with doxxing. I’m showing you how all of a sudden proving claims you or anyone makes matters.   While you claim it doesn’t.
1309204174240849921 2020-09-25 02:52:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 @KidConfusion And FYI no one here has asked you to vote for Trump or change your vote. Not once.   Weird how your mind works. You imagine things that aren’t even there.
1309203900994482177 2020-09-25 02:51:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 @KidConfusion When did I say you raped anyone? I said I “COULD” claim you raped someone or can’t you read?   Just like you can make claims about ppl and feel you don’t have to provide any proof? Remember “It’s more fun leaving it in limbo”.  https://t.co/ua4pJGPqI7
1309202949462089728 2020-09-25 02:48:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 @KidConfusion Report it for what? Making a claim that no one needs to prove? Isn’t that what you did?   Weird how that changes things doesn’t it? All of a sudden it matters huh?   Why are you worried Aaron it’s just Twitter?
1309202192876724224 2020-09-25 02:45:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 @KidConfusion There was no attempt by you to change my mind. If there was you’d have answered questions and provided information. You refused, because you’re above all that. My interaction with you doesn’t have to change YOUR mind, sometimes it helps change the minds of others.
1309201261028237312 2020-09-25 02:41:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion @aaron_skiles12 He likes to make assumptions.   I just think I could run around this place and make claims all day about ppl and things and not have any accountability and how is that right? That to me is wrong.   I could claim Aaron raped my friend.. and not provide evidence. Fair?
1309199287343931392 2020-09-25 02:33:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Translation: We can’t win according to the rules so we need to change that.   Sincerely,   The Losers
1309178103567130625 2020-09-25 01:09:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KidConfusion I know I’m a horrible person. Why should I ever expect anyone to back up their claims? I need to work on just taking ppl at their word more. 😂
1309167022035611649 2020-09-25 00:25:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 Yea that’s what I thought, because ppl like you enjoy making claims you have no evidence of. Typical leftist..  Feel free to come back when you can prove any of the bs you claimed.  https://t.co/w6bcglg579
1309166577791782914 2020-09-25 00:23:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 How am I arguing with myself? I’m asking you questions that you don’t want to answer.   I have no problem answering questions about my claims and providing evidence why do you?
1309166280595746816 2020-09-25 00:22:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 Here’s your claim.. got anything to back it up? Anything at all?  https://t.co/xGHKlRtK0Y
1309165896686952448 2020-09-25 00:20:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 Back this up..   Also.. like I said you don’t have to believe me, but then again I’m not a lying leftist who claims support as a joke.  https://t.co/vYCuIZFYI7
1309165055695495169 2020-09-25 00:17:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 I don’t say it because I expect you to believe me... believe what you want. Ppl who follow me know I supported Hillary in 2016.   Funny you make claims about what you believe to be true about me. Yet say I never said I knew you. Weird.
1309163369341972480 2020-09-25 00:10:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 Still waiting on your examples of right wing doxxing you know since there are so many.  😂  I never claimed doxxing was ok. I just gave you reasons different ppl have done it.
1309162763533479936 2020-09-25 00:08:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PopUp_Powerbomb @politicalamity2 @HarrisonLansing @sethdunlap @nickzantop I didn’t miss the point..  Jesus isn’t the same as violent protestors which is the comparison someone tried to make with that meme.  https://t.co/PioyS49jZn
1309162322808668167 2020-09-25 00:06:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 You don’t know anything about me. I’ll tell you a little secret. I was once on the left and I know first hand what they are capable of as soon as someone breaks ranks.
1309162051227365376 2020-09-25 00:05:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 Go ahead show me some..   Hey you were the one that claimed Republicans do all this doxxing so go ahead I’m sure you can provide some examples.
1309160703954124800 2020-09-25 00:00:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @93MINDOFMINE @Deseeded1 @Hurrica32761115 @pi_mij @laceysculls He’s not 60 either. 😂
1309159736730820608 2020-09-24 23:56:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 Lmaoo. Sure buddy. The left doxxed a 12 yr old for her parody acct and sent her family death threats. The left doxxes emotionally if a car drives by in a protest they doxx.  https://t.co/gZhymncN4u
1309157904134672386 2020-09-24 23:49:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BeardyMan1983 Haha.
1309157810572328960 2020-09-24 23:48:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PopUp_Powerbomb @politicalamity2 @HarrisonLansing @sethdunlap @nickzantop Haha yea Jesus wasn’t assaulting ppl, stabbing them and burning down private property.   He turned over tables because ppl were selling in the temple. That’s as “violent” as he got and he did it once! I didn’t last for 4 fkin months.
1309156797777936388 2020-09-24 23:44:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 I don’t doxx. The left does.   What have they been hypocritical about?   You read information? Care to provide it? I thought this was from personal experience?
1309143658491449352 2020-09-24 22:52:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @aaron_skiles12 You mean you don’t like to get doxxed as a leftist? Go figure.   Asking about where ppl got guns doesn’t mean they are opposed to black ppl having guns. That’s not a threat either. Americans should be allowed to defend themselves and their property. I have ZERO issue with this.  https://t.co/yHAdRuruIG
1309142542911451136 2020-09-24 22:47:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @UrBetsyJean Barack built the cages if she believes he didn’t use them she’s nuts. And they call us cultists.
1309142232532955139 2020-09-24 22:46:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Y’all doing what Trump has been saying for months is fkin hilarious. Y’all don’t seem too confident in the mail in process.. lol
1309140953882669056 2020-09-24 22:41:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait.. so now you’re recommending ppl vote in person while y’all pushed mail in voting and changed laws for months? 🤣😂🤣
1309140568811933696 2020-09-24 22:40:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Lmaoooo. Now it’s safe for ppl to vote in person? 🤡
1309026168721506310 2020-09-24 15:05:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GloriousLumi @DebJHolley @KyleHooten2 Remember Antifa is a myth. 😂

1309017034148188166 2020-09-24 14:29:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yea throwing Molotov cocktails would warrant that. @tedwheeler saying cops can’t use tear gas on these pieces of 💩 is ridiculous.

1309015333940924418 2020-09-24 14:22:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cleflore23 Depends on the circumstance. I don’t think it was appropriate in Breonna Taylor’s case.   If you have concrete evidence that someone was kidnapped and they need to do a rescue of a victim of course I’d be for a no knock.
1309014197401985024 2020-09-24 14:17:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I repeatedly said Ginsburg should retire and Nadler should as well after watching this. How are these ppl in charge of representing the ppl of their states accordingly?
1309013414468030465 2020-09-24 14:14:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BobbyDMAGA Ughh me too. What clowns. If this was a Dem nominee with a Dem senate majority they wouldn’t not hesitate to fill it as soon as possible.   Fk ‘em lets do what they’d do and watch them kick and scream.  https://t.co/alfU86mY7y
1309012351375626240 2020-09-24 14:10:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You’re mind is warped. He said nothing of the sort. He said “if” it ends up a tie that could be a problem. In the words of Obama..  https://t.co/agx72hQl5E
1309011926966513674 2020-09-24 14:08:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The insane delusional left screeches. You don’t even know who the nominee is as &amp; you are already against them? That’s not partisan AT ALL! 🤡
1309011126001303552 2020-09-24 14:05:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tripl3check @RealBrandonDonk You’re a bot acct trying to tell real ppl that they are inaccurate about what they believe? 😂 The fkin irony.
1309010233054855172 2020-09-24 14:02:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Sweetemmilyn It’s disgusting.
1309010145045815296 2020-09-24 14:01:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RexChapman Lies.. why are you lying to your followers REX?  https://t.co/vV6W1bOisG
1309009528558624769 2020-09-24 13:59:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EricVldw @CNN @MSNBC Oh hell yea..  https://t.co/wAwnb5Kkj1
1309007780209197059 2020-09-24 13:52:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They weren’t at the wrong house. The warrant has an address on it. You’re repeating bullsh*t posts that ppl had no evidence of.  https://t.co/KXn6FL4rh1
1309005980819128320 2020-09-24 13:45:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then you have @CNN &amp; @MSNBC saying these are just “peaceful protests”. When they get violent all of a sudden that’s Trump’s fault. Who do they think they are convincing with that bs when we see videos like this?
1309004050055213056 2020-09-24 13:37:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 Weird isn’t it? 😂
1309003943809355778 2020-09-24 13:37:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sav_says_ Get these animals one on one and they fkin run like the cowards they are. They only get brave in mobs.  https://t.co/rpc4NSaovX
1309002054623465474 2020-09-24 13:29:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @marinPeixes @SellUTheTop @wyamercy @KrisKetzKMBC @LMPD She was unfortunately killed when her bf decided to shoot at officers as they returned fire.   You want someone punished? Let’s charge her bf too.
1309001598887170049 2020-09-24 13:27:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @wyamercy @KrisKetzKMBC @LMPD And a suspect in custody... when you commit crimes like you go to prison.   The suspect just got themselves some jail time. Hope it was worth it to become someone’s pocket beotch. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1309000517050413057 2020-09-24 13:23:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AliBaumanTV @CBSNewYork Looks like a COVID super spreader to me.. and in NY? Gasp!
1309000207187816454 2020-09-24 13:22:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DebJHolley @KyleHooten2 That’s not an Antifa sign. That’s the Anarchist symbol. 🤦🏻‍♀️  https://t.co/vu5Z6iEPNj
1308995896965820416 2020-09-24 13:05:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HoaxBuster6 Oh and it’s clean.. lol
1308995406299267074 2020-09-24 13:03:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Eddie7757 I appreciate men that set priorities like having a place to live even if they can’t fill it with all the luxuries they’d like.
1308994762649800704 2020-09-24 13:00:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Y’all talk a hell of a lot about Q while claiming it’s just a conspiracy theory. 🤣    https://t.co/2ew5ZHcXyP
1308993733954867201 2020-09-24 12:56:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Some people truly have nothing better to do. This changes nothing except maybe get more ppl to vote for Trump in November. #Trump2020
1308992610451808256 2020-09-24 12:52:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealPhilJones1 Now we are talkin.
1308992184406994944 2020-09-24 12:50:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r She probably has an only fans selling pics of her butthole.
1308991953221169152 2020-09-24 12:49:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealPhilJones1 I could live like that too, but I’d want a huge bean bag instead of a fold out chair. 😂  https://t.co/BLyONsble3
1308991357000744960 2020-09-24 12:47:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SheldSink Right?
1308991247869251592 2020-09-24 12:46:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r I agree although they say 330+ got whiter. 🙄
1308991067346415617 2020-09-24 12:46:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @404___err0r It depends on the area that’s why some are more diverse while they claim others got whiter.   I don’t give af what color their skin is. Not everyone steps up to join the force especially now and if more are white who cares.
1308990509365563392 2020-09-24 12:43:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I have no issue with this.. at least he has a place to live. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1308989399649193985 2020-09-24 12:39:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like protestors have converted yet another couple of votes to TRUMP! 🤣 Keep it going.  https://t.co/blKI9HGfpo
1308988539762290691 2020-09-24 12:36:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HillaryClinton Projecting again Killary?
1308988146776932353 2020-09-24 12:34:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because white ppl are the only ones stepping up to sign up for the force. Why do you have a problem with that?
1308985406776631298 2020-09-24 12:23:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sxarmxnstx @SpiderDanni Bots? 😂 People are still using that excuse in 2020?
1308985146293575684 2020-09-24 12:22:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SpiderDanni I have no idea how Cassandra is gonna survive this harsh burn.
1308982357169508352 2020-09-24 12:11:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tjtwo1961 @GOPLeader Good luck with trying to impeach the president again for absolutely nothing just because you are sore losers.
1308980751367655424 2020-09-24 12:05:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left isn’t starting fires!!! 🥴
1308980512241922048 2020-09-24 12:04:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ppl are trying to pressure Mitt in the comments to not vote on a scotus pick. The failure of the left to play by the rules because they are losing is the problem. They want to destroy our republic and constitution. 🇺🇸
1308979976792928262 2020-09-24 12:02:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Do what? Trump has the constitutional right to nominate someone to fill an empty seat on the SUPREME COURT. The senate has the constitutional authority to appoint  one. If they have the votes FILL THE VACANCY!
1308979315321778178 2020-09-24 11:59:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Rick95648 Yes it is. I had never seen it before.
1308962841634852864 2020-09-24 10:53:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Watching The Sopranos and Janice just popped Richie... I’m like 😳 Two birds for Tony.
1308946551352356864 2020-09-24 09:49:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Cyborg1966 He totally is! He was helping a striper that one time to get off drugs so he had to snort coke with her and had to use a fake name so his heroism wouldn’t be mentioned in the news.   He’s an American H E R O!
1308945506987638785 2020-09-24 09:45:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Rick95648 Deputize all legal gun owners.
1308945011912790017 2020-09-24 09:43:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @blumpydag @nypost How do you know he didn’t?
1308944888034021376 2020-09-24 09:42:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nothing to see here folks, he was just given money because he WORKS for Russians. Totally legit.
1308932324109832192 2020-09-24 08:52:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The mayors:   1. Jacob Frey - Dem (2020) 2. Greg Fischer - Dem (2020) 3. Bob LeGare - NP (2019)  4. Bill DeBlasio - Dem (2014)  5. Rahm Emanuel - Dem (2012) 6. William Knowles - Rep (2014)   I’m starting to see a pattern here.. most are Dems and most deaths aren’t from 2020.
1308931298447306752 2020-09-24 08:48:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tampke @Justasimian1 What can we really expect from these Antifa clowns?
1308931095891767298 2020-09-24 08:47:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @93MINDOFMINE @Deseeded1 @Hurrica32761115 @pi_mij @laceysculls And who says WE are 60 while you call us old?
1308928126521610240 2020-09-24 08:35:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @93MINDOFMINE @Deseeded1 @Hurrica32761115 @pi_mij @laceysculls 😂 tf do you mean by “really old”?
1308927064179904515 2020-09-24 08:31:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These fkers are bored.. shutting down streets for this bs is ILLEGAL.
1308924376881008640 2020-09-24 08:21:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @who_am_i_3005 It’s uncanny..
1308920768240201730 2020-09-24 08:06:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @93MINDOFMINE @Deseeded1 @Hurrica32761115 @pi_mij @laceysculls Haha I’m sure that includes your momma.
1308919796944252931 2020-09-24 08:02:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco Yep.. instigating like she does.
1308915792084430852 2020-09-24 07:46:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @93MINDOFMINE @Hurrica32761115 @pi_mij @laceysculls Can you repeat that in English? Good lord.
1308915437531475971 2020-09-24 07:45:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Of course this hateful bigoted beotch is down in Louisville.  https://t.co/B59XJzXBew
1308915063189917697 2020-09-24 07:44:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Nothing good will come of this. Ppl have had enough of your BLM violence and destruction. Kentucky isn’t where you want to get crazy.   https://t.co/HCuVCajWS5
1308913505182113792 2020-09-24 07:37:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kimksmells I have ZERO WORDS...like ZERO!
1308913332762664961 2020-09-24 07:37:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It is worthless, but they will twist it into “Trump hates Meghan because she’s half black and he’s a racist!” 🥴
1308912458791301122 2020-09-24 07:33:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @VCollin15560538 I can’t even imagine.
1308911164508844039 2020-09-24 07:28:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine being the party that won’t even pass a bill to give life saving treatment to a baby who’s fighting to live after a failed abortion.   These ppl also call themselves MORAL.  https://t.co/Q0PAdBKfqt
1308909811011129346 2020-09-24 07:23:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I can’t y’all.. 😩
1308906537235218433 2020-09-24 07:10:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @stevieanntas @BeardyMan1983 @niceprinter12 @AceHighball @Keith4Change @justtradin @mtgreenee FYI Kyle wasn’t a gang banger or a criminal so your comparison argument already fails.
1308898294605717508 2020-09-24 06:37:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> tHeY aReNt oRgAnizEd!! 🥴
1308885763505950721 2020-09-24 05:47:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @syl_capulet1  https://t.co/vhHoEWo0oy
1308880915662340097 2020-09-24 05:28:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Triggering leftists with Trump/Pence posters has been a very effective campaign strategy for Trump. It’s so easy.  https://t.co/CtWM0AGCSH
1308840178048532494 2020-09-24 02:46:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PowTwatter Yea that’s what I heard. He admitted to it as well. He shot one of the officers if I recall.
1308835683193286661 2020-09-24 02:28:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @atrupar We are out of patience with Fauci.
1308829566874669061 2020-09-24 02:04:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RexChapman Well when you shoot at officers while your GF is in the next room not sure what ppl expect to happen.   Yes innocent ppl die daily in the crossfire and it’s always tragic.
1308827996187287552 2020-09-24 01:58:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Breonna’s BF also committed “wanton endangerment” then.
1308827809888960513 2020-09-24 01:57:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So then I’m guessing Breonna’s BF can be charged for “wanton endangerment” as well. Be careful what you wish for.
1308825536702029824 2020-09-24 01:48:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This officer will still get his day in court and could be found innocent of all charges. Breonna Taylor’s death although tragic was not criminal. If they want to charge the officer then I don’t see how Taylor’s BF isn’t indicted for endangerment as well.
1308811712297013249 2020-09-24 00:53:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Alexpad Lmaoo
1308811610312515585 2020-09-24 00:52:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jjparke82329935 @Unger57 @GeraltofPDX1 @BlackagarBolt @mbracemoore @AOC Your kind of ignorance and anger makes my day everyday.  #Trump2020
1308662377974345730 2020-09-23 14:59:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats the party for felons!! What a great endorsement that is!!
1308660626823081984 2020-09-23 14:53:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Who is she talking to? No one is clapping or cheering or anything. Is she out there alone? Kamala party of one.   https://t.co/tVWYULXxZH
1308655797090492416 2020-09-23 14:33:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I bet Dems never expected to regret their decision so quickly. Exactly why the senate should confirm while the left cries.  https://t.co/173yWgzfJs
1308653512494964736 2020-09-23 14:24:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hornyphilosophr You’re tweet started off racist for assuming “white people live here”.   Black ppl live in the suburbs too.
1308652504989577217 2020-09-23 14:20:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are you assuming criminals don’t target nice areas to commit crimes? 🤣 Tell me which house would you rather rob?   Image 1 of Image 2  https://t.co/o58iso6vRP
1308645211946450950 2020-09-23 13:51:46 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @WatchMeBGreat @nypost You knew Jesus and what he looked like I’m guessing?
1308642302777126912 2020-09-23 13:40:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Proof the Lincoln project is run by leftists. Just look at the meme suckage.
1308640683951976449 2020-09-23 13:33:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The only pos here is you.. if someone slandered your husband just because someone they didn’t like nominated him for a position maybe you’d understand.
1308635703249575936 2020-09-23 13:13:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TwitterGov I’m not confirming anything about voter registration on this site.
1308635308490067970 2020-09-23 13:12:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @IlhanMN If this is YOUR country why do you hate it so much?   Yes, you were part of the partisan impeachment of the president.   You fled civil war, but you sh*t on the country that took you in and got you elected to its Congress?
1308628162159415296 2020-09-23 12:44:01 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrSatanPower Another example of a horrible meme. Got anymore?
1308624210319740929 2020-09-23 12:28:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> How did they decide on Super Freak as the background music and think that was a bad thing? They are soooo bad at memes.
1308623597720625152 2020-09-23 12:25:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Where’s the lie? Do you ppl forget he actually speaks with officers/law enforcement and sees the images of things being thrown?  https://t.co/nkhMXVM2Gf
1308616067640508416 2020-09-23 11:55:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @sicteeco lol yes!!
1308608274984439808 2020-09-23 11:25:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BporH82 @Loduv2417 You couldn’t be MORE right.
1308607099484516353 2020-09-23 11:20:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lilredandy @ReutersPolitics She’s a woman.. it’s what y’all wanted.  https://t.co/QFOjmCUvmU
1308605226392252416 2020-09-23 11:12:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s because we aren’t a democracy you tit.. we are a constitutional republic. Y’all don’t know sh*t.
1308604240525291520 2020-09-23 11:08:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @PintSizePolemic Like always. 😂
1308604122191421440 2020-09-23 11:08:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I thought a world with more women in charge is what y’all wanted? 😂 OH you mean only the women WHO think like you...  https://t.co/KOhkE6alRf
1308602760162467840 2020-09-23 11:03:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is a blatant lie. Trump knew what CDC was telling him. Here is YOUR SPEAKER.. saying “don’t worry the city is on top of the situation”.  https://t.co/vEvcmMW85k
1308600387067236352 2020-09-23 10:53:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Why can’t you just have a regular curriculum? As a parent if you find out that educators aren’t sticking by it then they need to be reported and reprimanded and removed if necessary via parent vote.
1308599870383509504 2020-09-23 10:51:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> All of Seattle will now become a CHOP ZONE... congrats to the voters! This is what YOU voted for right? These ppl represent your voice when they make their political decisions right?
1308598297313947648 2020-09-23 10:45:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Even when constitutional issues are involved. I agree tho the ppl are the check but that is even over turned in some cases.   Do you know about Prop 187 in CA? The ppl voted for it and the Governor halted state appeals not allowing the ruling to be challenged.  https://t.co/pJy5ZZmJvd
1308595648594288641 2020-09-23 10:34:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Then who regulates the states to make sure they are teaching and not indoctrinating? Who is the check on the states?

1308594245498843139 2020-09-23 10:29:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But they call us the cultists. 🤣
1308593754090029058 2020-09-23 10:27:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Whats the point of a federal department of education then?   Wasn’t it Michelle Obama who implemented the change in school lunches?
1308592934673997824 2020-09-23 10:24:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Curriculum or actual history? Indoctrination is teaching racism and hate in schools by Marxist/anarchist educators.

He refused so he got slammed.   That could happen to anyone had nothing to do with him being a journalist. It was for being a jackhole.

What does body slamming a journalist have to do with anything we were discussing? Like I said he has a right to his opinion just like you under the 1A.   You have no idea what authoritarian is. There was no “forced” obedience.  https://t.co/D6do97yv8z

Are you claiming public servants can’t have an opinion? 😂  Where has he stated he wants to do anything that “literally wants to censor the media” in anything you posted?
1308541222730887168 2020-09-23 06:58:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead Here’s an example. SCOTUS RULED the ACA mandate is unconstitutional. California has decided as a state they will be charging ppl for it anyway.   States rights.. learn it.  https://t.co/YqQeZ8Od6N
1308540451402649602 2020-09-23 06:55:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead Do they teach you kids anything in school about the differences between STATE and FEDERAL laws?
1308539757731803136 2020-09-23 06:52:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead States rights my man. Don’t forget who issued the NO KNOCK warrant in the first place, the local courts.   If the state had taken SCOTUS ruling into account they wouldn’t need a Breonna Taylor Law now would they.    https://t.co/v5QpSPzC5H
1308538343462850560 2020-09-23 06:47:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Unger57 @GeraltofPDX1 @BlackagarBolt @mbracemoore @AOC Calling news fake isn’t censorship. 😂 Since when is a private citizen NOT allowed to give their opinion on the media? That’s his 1A right as well.   You said he’s “literally wants to censor the media”. It’s been 3 yrs and nothing. 😂  https://t.co/odZg0NfRPQ
1308537081895944192 2020-09-23 06:42:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead Yep Breonna had the choice NOT to associate with drug dealers and criminals who got her that no knock warrant in the first place.   Choices go both ways.. you said you’d shoot so don’t be surprised when ppl shoot back. You had a choice NOT to shoot too. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1308536256247201793 2020-09-23 06:38:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lmaorelaxxx @moodyredhead @BotchlaUS How am I being hypocritical? Do you even know what the term means?
1308536125682626560 2020-09-23 06:38:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This coming from a first gen American with immigrant parents who’s managed to get a seat in congress in this obviously horrible country.

That’s democratic. You get ppl to vote on it. Explaining the pros and cons.   You can’t just demand the law accommodate you because “feelings” that’s not how it works!
1308512538523389952 2020-09-23 05:04:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lmaorelaxxx @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead How was the situation in Breonna’s case corrupted?   Would I be upset if my sister died via cop? of course I would. Would I demand justice while knowing NO LAW had been broken by those just doing their jobs? No. That’s the difference between us.
1308511739844026368 2020-09-23 05:01:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 2.8M Americans die yearly. Here’s how many ppl die around the world in a year.  https://t.co/MjyR0adB7M
1308509100074921984 2020-09-23 04:50:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Notice how the break up of California was so gerrymandered that each section had to include one large Democrat sh*thole so they could guarantee a democrat majority?
1308508134034436096 2020-09-23 04:47:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s what California tried to do to gain more seats. 😂 How quickly you clowns forget.  https://t.co/k7Ukbrb5Dv
1308507620370604032 2020-09-23 04:45:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wait is that not the same as CA trying to break up into 3 sections to own the cons 2 yrs ago?   Awww someone doesn’t like when the their own “tropes” are used against them.
1308505831495725056 2020-09-23 04:37:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lmaorelaxxx @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead No you just sound like someone that doesn’t know how the law works and likes to throw a hissy fit when you don’t get your way.   Again if you don’t like the No knock warrant law... CHANGE IT!   That’s how sh*t works in a democracy, commie.. you vote on it.
1308500037027020801 2020-09-23 04:14:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead You just said you’d shoot at ppl as well if that happened to you. So would you call that self defense or not? Would you expect to go to jail if you killed someone for protecting your home and family?   According to you. You should go to jail for it.
1308499355456815104 2020-09-23 04:12:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BotchlaUS @moodyredhead You seem to not understand that they were following the no knock warrant instructions they received from the court.   Yes, you have the right to protect yourself. U however do not have the right to fire on officers &amp; not expect to be shot at.   Don’t like the no knock law chg it
1308490923098034177 2020-09-23 03:38:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Watch til the end... 🤣
1308489174215925761 2020-09-23 03:31:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Not sure how creating laws to prevent criminal activity against citizens is fascism, but then again the actual fascists have to project while they riot and threaten ppl with violence when they don’t do what they want. #ironic.

1308486440964075520 2020-09-23 03:20:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Shot_Of_Cabo @WLuftmensch This is exactly why they get arrested. They don’t know the law. Or they do and just think they are somehow immune because they are “protesting” and it’s their 1A right. 😂 They can’t infringe on other ppl’s rights. It’s against the law.  https://t.co/J7jwtnCcr7
1308482750026887169 2020-09-23 03:06:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead Exactly! Plus you shouldn’t shoot at officers and expect not to be fired back on.   Change the law so that doesn’t happen again.
1308478478648356864 2020-09-23 02:49:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No one has to threaten violence because they didn’t get the outcome they wanted, but please continue to flip ppl to vote for Trump and decrease support for BLM. 🤷🏻‍♀️  https://t.co/UEP0qARcDI
1308477637782765568 2020-09-23 02:45:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @WLuftmensch Sorry it’s illegal to be on private property. That’s not peaceful and if you refuse to leave you can be arrested.  That’s the fkin law.
1308477317912563712 2020-09-23 02:44:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> No, that just means that one side is using any excuse to riot because they didn’t get the decision they wanted. This isn’t the Salem witch trials. You can’t just demand ppl be charged because you “believe” they should be.

1308294396895358976 2020-09-22 14:37:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Correct, the people picked Trump in 2016. Trump is nominating a justice as our current president. The Republican senate was given a majority in 2018. They confirm the President’s judicial pick. What don’t you understand?

1308277393245655040 2020-09-22 13:30:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh but I thought Trump was a telling ppl to risk their lives and die just to vote in person? Fkin 🤡
1308276770391482368 2020-09-22 13:27:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HappyManor @Ja1Ke3 @willwilkinson Well that’s laughable. Imagine what Trump could do with a super majority and placing 3 Supreme Court justices. I was talking with @GeraltofPDX1 who said he believes Clarence Thomas should retire when Trump wins. This way Trump will have replaced 4 justices.
1308265297242066949 2020-09-22 12:42:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HappyManor @Ja1Ke3 @willwilkinson “Trump regime” oozes bias.
1308264657958760448 2020-09-22 12:39:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KatherynScott @marklevinshow Correct they are asking for exceptions for rallies like he made exemptions for religious gatherings.   But the area not wanting the rallies are acting at a local level not at a state level.
1308263796759171072 2020-09-22 12:36:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KatherynScott @marklevinshow I’ll read more but that’s what I’m getting so far.
1308259967581827072 2020-09-22 12:20:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KatherynScott @marklevinshow Correct but the GOP was wondering why the Governor made an exception for religious gatherings, but not rallies. If the governor decides to remove the exemption and say that only 50 ppl could gather then he has to do it across the board. That would include BLM protests.
1308255857742811137 2020-09-22 12:04:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 🤣👉🏼  #BidensUnitingUS from his basement. I can’t stop laughing. These ppl seem so desperate.
1308255281499926529 2020-09-22 12:02:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KatherynScott @marklevinshow Actually the article doesn’t say that exactly. I guess the Governor imposed exemptions for religious groups and somehow they couldn’t prove that he was allowing BLM protests to get away with more. The restrictions are at the local level not state. It’s complicated.
1308252319935467520 2020-09-22 11:50:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Hang tight and steady @SenCoryGardner!

YOU as well as others have blood on your hands.   This is like the Salem witch trials. When the finger is pointed at you for defending yourself left’s see if you feel it’s justified.

1307941054100860931 2020-09-21 15:13:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So no masks or social distancing in an enclosed area? What about COVID?! I guess ppl who win Emmys and their family members become immune at that moment.
1307939949233094656 2020-09-21 15:09:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @FordFischer Why do they always mention Trump and penises? They are so obsessed.
1307935505275711488 2020-09-21 14:51:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I will NEVER forget what Democrats and the left did to Kavanaugh and his family. Most disgusting display I’ve ever seen in my life while they have no problem electing Ralph Northam.. or Biden after what they call “credible accusations”.  https://t.co/tsuk4pwhDu
1307925958066724864 2020-09-21 14:13:43 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CeruleanBlwave @AnnCoulter Classic case of projection from the left.   Blue states don’t exist? 😂  https://t.co/HlYN1YbtEs

1307918022250651649 2020-09-21 13:42:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Q: If Democrats had the majority in the senate would they have confirmed a Supreme Court Justice for Obama in an election year @senatemajldr?   A:  https://t.co/3nYWjkRGaF

1307838035325722624 2020-09-21 08:24:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 I thought these ppl kept repeating how it’s too dangerous for ppl to vote and that’s why they pushed for mail-in voting. Yet these same ppl are voting in person?   Doing exactly what Trump has encouraged ppl to do while calling him and his supporters murderers!?
1307837623671562241 2020-09-21 08:22:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JenZ1111 @Hung_Hippo @AMErikaNGIRLLL @spearsdeni @Target Let’s put it this way had a conservative said something like that what would the left do?   Not just get you fired they’d ruin your whole life and run you out of town.   The left get away w/this because NO ONE holds them accountable. Don’t embolden them.
1307836404756430849 2020-09-21 08:17:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 @chromato_mania I thought so too. 🤗

1307814834247929859 2020-09-21 06:52:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why would a man ever risk all of that to become President?   @realDonaldTrump NEVER had to do this he chose to do it to save our country. #Trump2020 🇺🇸

1307811298663477248 2020-09-21 06:38:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Hung_Hippo Yes. Because of RBG.
1307810922346364928 2020-09-21 06:36:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 They might, unfortunately they move to other areas &amp; vote for the same sh*t policies &amp; ppl then move again.   And somehow they still can’t figure out what the problem is.   Them: Democrats &amp; their policies are so much better.   Also them: omg this state is so expensive! *moves*

1307809355140493312 2020-09-21 06:30:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Hung_Hippo Oh I’m good.
1307809153927114752 2020-09-21 06:29:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s probably because republicans usually like where they live and their Reps. Unlike Dems leaving in droves because of the leftists and their policies they elected into office. That comes with consequences too.  https://t.co/QzaWI8qwgv
1307807782616182784 2020-09-21 06:24:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> 😂🤣😂 How about NO!  https://t.co/z5tB7Xb3kQ

1307801994992648192 2020-09-21 06:01:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @McFaddenMegan I had no idea the president’s job was to fulfill a dying woman’s last wish.   Can you show me where it says that in the constitution?   The fact YOU want to use a dying woman’s last wish to get what you want politically is what’s disgusting.

1307797739426574337 2020-09-21 05:44:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> People living in Minnesota, Chicago, Portland and other democrat run areas have felt this way for months because of you do nothing jackholes.
1307784837655265280 2020-09-21 04:52:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sorry the US Senate isn’t the Make A Wish Foundation. 🤷🏻‍♀️

1307741089739075584 2020-09-21 01:59:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are we really surprised China is pissed about this? Do they think we don’t have Chinese spies working for American Tech companies in the US?
1307738317966815232 2020-09-21 01:48:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ChirrickMuro @AOC They also need them to employ ppl so other ppl can have money to spend.   We the people employ our government and they’ve been off more days then they’ve actually worked. I’d be fired if did that.

I’ll keep that in mind. You’ll have no reason to be upset either it was YOUR idea right?

1307734415506726912 2020-09-21 01:32:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If leftists like @AOC think socialism is so awesome and they don’t need the rich why are governors like Cuomo now begging the rich to come back?
1307722943795847168 2020-09-21 00:47:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> These ppl are a danger to our republic. The state she represents in congress is losing residents because of radical beliefs like AOC’s and DeBlasio. She’s aided in changing NY to a commie utopia and ppl are fleeing in droves.
1307718336155795458 2020-09-21 00:28:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @CDEgranny They have serious mental issues.
1307503656476917760 2020-09-20 10:15:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sounds like when I hear Dems talking about getting rid of the filibuster so they can get their way. In the words of Obama, “#DoYourJob fill the Supreme Court vacancy.”  https://t.co/Kqt8fQ0XZb

1307496006473244672 2020-09-20 09:45:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I would argue that the house abused their power when they impeached Trump with ZERO evidence. Had it not been for the checks in balances in place and republicans gaining seats ppl like you would have removed a duly elected president because he wasn’t who YOU wanted. #criminal
1307492710652153858 2020-09-20 09:32:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ProjectLincoln Weird Obama disagreed when he was president. It’s the job of the senate to confirm justices. #DoYourJob fill. the. Supreme. Court. vancancy.  https://t.co/TPuU1MXlJ4

1307478224989896706 2020-09-20 08:34:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> What I think is hilarious is democrats believe this won’t backfire on them eventually.   It’s because of comments like this YOU are the first Kennedy to lose an election.
1307477260870410241 2020-09-20 08:30:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It’s not actually since this is how the electoral college has worked for decades electing presidents via the constitution. Do you hate our constitution David?

That I somehow can’t make it without your help in the US.   YOU are NOT better than me in any way shape or form. So why do you keep insisting you are and I “deserve” something just because of my skin color?

What do you think I deserve as a minority?

1307414157264707584 2020-09-20 04:20:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> A white leftist male trying to justify violence by saying “MLK wasn’t as peaceful” as we’d like to think.

1307385107657834496 2020-09-20 02:24:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MattForceFields @AtomicMexican77 @ChristineSinno3 So yes you’re the fascist and you are attempting to use violence to accomplish your political goals. Congratulations you’ve come full circle leftist.
1307384788135755776 2020-09-20 02:23:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MattForceFields @AtomicMexican77 @ChristineSinno3 Republicans also voted for Obama numbnuts, in some cases twice.   Wait so if the right started and you’re finishing it doesn’t that make you the fascists now?   Weird MLK got things done with actual peaceful protesting. Plus I don’t recall the right doing this in 2008 or 2012.  https://t.co/cTCua8ETpv
1307382796223012864 2020-09-20 02:15:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MurchadhaC Yep list death from “COVID COMPLICATIONS” like everyone else.
1307382263819071488 2020-09-20 02:13:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @syl_capulet1 Looks like Tim is concerned as well.
1307381956997312512 2020-09-20 02:12:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @imitationbacun I was locked up by twitter for calling someone a dumb ho and bitch 😂  https://t.co/QGmIMWB7gK
1307381499352641536 2020-09-20 02:10:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BradinGlendora They call for violence and then go private fkin hilarious. What are they scared of? 😂
1307376385392963584 2020-09-20 01:49:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Can’t even let the dead Rest In Peace. Good lord Commies.
1307375861952163842 2020-09-20 01:47:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m posting this proactively after seeing the left’s reaction to the death of RBG while suffering from stage 11 TDS. HELP IS AVAILABLE. #RIPRBG  https://t.co/pqyJJ7edNZ
1307375152846364673 2020-09-20 01:45:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left is now cancelling RBG for daring to die of cancer in an election year.
1307370960803127296 2020-09-20 01:28:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MattForceFields @AtomicMexican77 @ChristineSinno3 The only fascists are the ppl calling for violence over a potential SCOTUS nomination who have been destroying cities across the country for political gain. This *IS* the left. Stop projecting...  https://t.co/HVuGeZx8YN

1307366302210637825 2020-09-20 01:09:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The TRUE fascists showing you who they are. Another reason to vote for Trump in 2020. If you thought leftist riots where gonna win you an election keep threatening Americans with violence. See what happens. #4MoreYears
1307365677838159873 2020-09-20 01:07:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So be it...
1307363371604488193 2020-09-20 00:58:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Where is twitter on these violations of their TOS?  https://t.co/9sfxVD0BZt

1307359706889908225 2020-09-20 00:43:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Spotify As a Latina I’m offended by the term Latinx. If this is OUR heritage why do insist on changing our language to suit your bs?  https://t.co/cfGI3YqAGo
1307357932506415104 2020-09-20 00:36:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ummm not in the senate. Senate Republicans gained seats. Checks and balances ever heard of it John?
1307356826443214850 2020-09-20 00:32:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This is why we don’t want to fund schools with federal money anymore. The money should follow the child! These Marxist lunatics are educating YOUR kids!!
1307356354173042691 2020-09-20 00:30:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Skol_1969 @GOPLeader @FBI Especially when they claim they are academics. These ppl always pass under the guise of educators.
1307355331282960384 2020-09-20 00:26:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Weird how the democrats want a 3T dollar stimulus bill passed while their supporters have no problem coming up with $35M in just 2hrs to ActBlue. The same ActBlue that takes donations for BLM. That BLM money should go to repairing the cities they destroyed with their rioting.
1307353899251113984 2020-09-20 00:20:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HappyManor @GOPLeader @FBI Of course he is.. if any of us had said what he had Twitter would have suspended us no problem. This man has been spreading hate and vitriol forever and still has his blue check and acct.
1307349690636095490 2020-09-20 00:03:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This man is threatening OUR country with violence for political means. Therefore he *is* a terrorist and should be deported immediately to his country of origin. @GOPLeader @FBI  https://t.co/LMbsJ6wxFl
1307348254351265793 2020-09-19 23:58:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> But #BLM... this is clearly racism.
1307347478203695104 2020-09-19 23:55:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HeshmatAlavi @NIACouncil @tparsi @hmousavian He was not born in the US therefore can be deported back to his country of birth if he is found to be violating our laws and is a threat to our country. In my opinion he’s basically a domestic terrorist.  https://t.co/paYu4U6XSD
1307345748413960192 2020-09-19 23:48:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RiderHonu I’ve been watching the Sopranos and they had rules you just never break or you’d be sleeping with the fishes.
1307344650865225729 2020-09-19 23:43:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The TRUE #fascists have spoken.
1307343079565750272 2020-09-19 23:37:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThmsHoward @Longduckdon2 @thehill Thanks for proving my point. Your intolerance and bigotry is showing.   See it’s this simple. I don’t have to agree with you, your politics or your opinion. Using bully tactics to get ppl to side with you is failing. You need my vote more than I need yours. Remember that.
1307342500927959041 2020-09-19 23:35:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Remember *THESE* are the ppl educating YOUR kids. Academia needs to be shutdown and if you are going to be an educator they need to be vetted throughly for stuff like this.
1307200764436127744 2020-09-19 14:12:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @stillgray How many of the officers are federally deputized now?   Also the state DA can’t do anything if they commit federal crimes... so let these terrorists go for it and arrest them all and charge them.
1307199514969690114 2020-09-19 14:07:05 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 @thehill Oh and their clear bias.
1307196687933296641 2020-09-19 13:55:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Calm down Fascist Karen.
1307196295547768834 2020-09-19 13:54:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hafNorthKorean All they need is 51 votes to confirm a SCOTUS pick. I know some republicans will be scared to vote because they have elections coming up, but the survival of our country is at stake. No excuses!
1307194055328067585 2020-09-19 13:45:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @hafNorthKorean Frightening. The senate should not cower to threats from the left. Confirm Trump’s SCOTUS pick if he picks one.
1307193612992569344 2020-09-19 13:43:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @slevinBad_Dog Nothing new from the fascist left.
1307192047040774144 2020-09-19 13:37:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left is acting like RBG wanted to die of cancer just to destroy what’s left of 2020. *smh* #RIPRBG   Leftists are about to implode.
1307191262676529152 2020-09-19 13:34:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Good lord I’m so glad I’m NOT a leftists. RBG can’t even Rest In Peace over the screeching.
1307184803528077315 2020-09-19 13:08:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Longduckdon2 @ThmsHoward @thehill Thank you. I was embraced by the right long before I became a Trump supporter. That’s when I knew it was different. I was instantly shunned the moment my opinion strayed from the left.
1307184284189429760 2020-09-19 13:06:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @saturnfour2 @Got_Mugged @BeardyMan1983 @Trump_owo I’m not the one that brought up Satan initially.. that was your leftist buddy. 😂  Is that why so many leftists are Satanists?
1307183622273642497 2020-09-19 13:03:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ZacharyHernlen @Loduv2417 You could tell it was an honest response and he was caught off guard.
1307174741053038592 2020-09-19 12:28:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Got_Mugged @BeardyMan1983 @Trump_owo Why would the devil want you to keep your babies? Satan rather they be dismembered in the womb tossed out like trash. The fetal screams are music to the devil’s ears.
1307167503659851776 2020-09-19 11:59:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Longduckdon2 @ThmsHoward @thehill Yes really. I walked away in 2018 before #walkaway became a big thing.   I left because I realized how controlling the left was. I also realized media blatantly lied to us and I was repeating that lie for them. Never again. #Trump2020 🇺🇸
1307166492195135488 2020-09-19 11:55:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Longduckdon2 @ThmsHoward @thehill Maybe he understands images better? Here’s one for the commie..  https://t.co/8EOH9VWrYJ
1307166289727635457 2020-09-19 11:55:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThmsHoward @Longduckdon2 @thehill It’s not. It’s actually pretty easy. I don’t live miserable with TDS every fkin day listening to what the media feeds me. I supported Hillary in 2016. I’m voting Trump in 2020 and couldn’t be happier. #vote #Trump2020 🇺🇸
1307165144795901953 2020-09-19 11:50:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Yup. He quoted McConnell as his first tweet when he heard RBG had passed, pretty horrifying.
1307164805220892673 2020-09-19 11:49:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThmsHoward @Longduckdon2 @thehill It’s weird you make fun of poor ppl when the left claims to be their saviors by pushing socialism and equality.   Don’t you hate the rich or something? 😂
1307162431521611776 2020-09-19 11:39:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThmsHoward @Longduckdon2 @thehill Trump.. Trump.. Trump!!!  https://t.co/bl9KvQWOXL
1307162210171412480 2020-09-19 11:38:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThmsHoward @Longduckdon2 @thehill What’s anti Semitic about mentioning Soros? 😂 Don’t you hate Israel and support Palestine as a leftist?
1307161746432430081 2020-09-19 11:37:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> He had a kinder more empathetic response then the left did to RBG’s death. #RIPRBG
1307153431782592512 2020-09-19 11:03:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ThmsHoward @thehill RBG was 87 and was dealing with cancer. Unlike the left I had hoped she would retire and live out her life in peace instead the left pressured her to stay alive and even offered to supply her w/organs if necessary. Y’all are sick. FYI Trump had a list of nominees in 2016.
1307134662322597888 2020-09-19 09:49:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @taylr Actually McConnell at least mourned her passing before mentioning anything about the nomination of a new SCOTUS. Unlike Schumer this is classless.  https://t.co/5jdp1Mdmel
1307117157759823872 2020-09-19 08:39:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> All this.. @senatemajldr
1307116395696619521 2020-09-19 08:36:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @my5fireflies What’s worse is he said that even before his condolences. *smh*  https://t.co/l2GeS3Qyj0

1307111754829369344 2020-09-19 08:18:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @InfoHippo @RealCandaceO @SenSchumer He literally made it political first then gave his condolences. What a true pos.  https://t.co/OOuYtgW6Y5
1307111421096988672 2020-09-19 08:17:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @InfoHippo @RealCandaceO She showed more empathy than @SenSchumer did in his tweet.
1307110797492051969 2020-09-19 08:14:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> RBG’s body isn’t even cold yet and this guy is making it political. 🤦🏻‍♀️ #RIPRBG

1307108492214497280 2020-09-19 08:05:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Omg.. #RIPRBG  https://t.co/gTwipdVQOx

1307073249638051847 2020-09-19 05:45:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Silverfoxnative @Nick85Houston @joerogan The left are stiff arming him to see what he does.. he failed.. he apologized.. Money talks.   And that’s unfortunate.
1307062098091020288 2020-09-19 05:01:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @kendallybrown @joerogan @Spotify Not necessary since what he stated was true. Maybe if the leftist media spent more time on doing the same they would have more credibility. 🤷🏻‍♀️  @joerogan gives a more truthful news than our own media does.
1307061593797210112 2020-09-19 04:59:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @mattbc @ThatCoolDude8 @kendallybrown @joerogan @Spotify What point was that exactly? That he was telling the truth just wasn’t aware of it? Yea it’s soooooo damaging telling the truth is these days.
1307061210936901635 2020-09-19 04:57:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Nick85Houston @joerogan Actually he didn’t lie. Ppl have been arrested in Portland for starting fires/arson. Not sure why he believes it’s not true.
1307052607769382913 2020-09-19 04:23:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now in a Biden commercial he’s saying it’s NOT a mask mandate, but a “patriotic duty” to protect others.   So tell me @JoeBiden why weren’t you wearing your mask in PA “protecting” our firefighters?  https://t.co/XBawH8vnsf
1307049932055080960 2020-09-19 04:12:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Don’t worry about that Matt you need to set a date to debate.
1307049740568268803 2020-09-19 04:11:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @cecy_mcdonald Funny Dems never forget when republicans get DUIs but will support democrats with DUIs like “Beto” like the DUI is non existent.  https://t.co/U2RWyMnzTs

1307019702930030593 2020-09-19 02:12:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jason_9905 Not angry enough to say what she did. She’s a COVID breeding ground, just look at her.
1307019288956432384 2020-09-19 02:10:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JackDoorsey Does she have teeth? I’m so confused by her old lady denture mouth speaking. 😂

1307013675190874114 2020-09-19 01:48:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Just a reminder to NOT #vote BLINDLY for someone just because they have a letter next to their name that you agree with. This person never hid who they were and their stances. YOU as a voter have to pay more attention to who you are casting your vote for.  https://t.co/lCSfQ7e1Jz
1307011187557588992 2020-09-19 01:38:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Looks like @AOC politics have literally given her the NY state she wanted.   They don’t need the rich.. keep this in mind when you decide to mistreat your constituents and they move.

1306997729621467136 2020-09-19 00:45:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> When you see headers like this the bias is evident. If you want to commend Jon Stewart for doing more for vets and Americans don’t single out Republicans when you have Democrats who helped deplete our military and sold us out to China.  https://t.co/PlG9WWplUN
1306995789810425856 2020-09-19 00:37:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ACTBrigitte @bgconlan I’d prefer @joerogan to moderate the first debate over Chris Wallace.   Who else?

1306992273851256832 2020-09-19 00:23:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well isn’t that something.. and I don’t even trust polls, but if they are showing Trump up 6pts it’s probably more like 12pts with all the lefty polls that bring down his overall numbers.

1306979740100698113 2020-09-18 23:33:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jason_9905 She lied in her video. She said Trump called the virus a hoax. That’s a lie. Even fact checked. Where is the tag from @twitter saying this is misleading media?  https://t.co/chraFrjzTS
1306824513192042496 2020-09-18 13:16:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “McCain/Bush Republican” says it all.

1306805671828967424 2020-09-18 12:02:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I’m wondering when this will be shutdown by Twitter.. “the virus is quite fragile”.
1306804809459093505 2020-09-18 11:58:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lib_loon Let them push unsolicited mail in ballots then go take them to a voting place in person and show ID.

1306787608979279872 2020-09-18 10:50:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Excellent point.
1306787341659525121 2020-09-18 10:49:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LadySusette @TwitterSupport Ok thanks. I’ll have to do that.
1306786736605925379 2020-09-18 10:46:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NoStrings_on_Me @TwitterSupport Hmmm something fishy going on!
1306786613729558529 2020-09-18 10:46:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 RINOs don’t count as conservative.   How can you vote for a man that’s pushing for M4A, spitting on our constitution and ok with critical race theory as a conservative?
1306786012585132033 2020-09-18 10:43:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Twitter just randomly asked me to verify my password. I cancelled out because why would twitter need me to do this on the app I’m already logged into?   @TwitterSupport what’s going on?
1306785418923446283 2020-09-18 10:41:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left in a nutshell. 🤣
1306784500811169792 2020-09-18 10:37:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Too little too late.. it’s been going on in Portland for 100 days. Then you had the nerve to call federal officers protecting federal buildings the gestapo. All of a sudden changing your tune because the polls are showing ppl do not support this lawlessness. 🖕🏼#Trump2020 🇺🇸
1306782774758715395 2020-09-18 10:31:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TeaBoots What US law are these officers enforcing exactly?   He is social distanced from everyone else I don’t see what the issue is.   But then again schools are infected with leftists. The same ppl that want to abolish the police call the police every chance they get. 🙄
1306626605104558080 2020-09-18 00:10:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Jason_9905 @Ja1Ke3 I didn’t know you rescued dogs. 🤗♥️
1306625424194109440 2020-09-18 00:05:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeyNada76 I said a few things before but that question got me banned from the live feed.
1306621529648635905 2020-09-17 23:50:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JoeyNada76 Yep the ppl in her live feed are fking pathetic.

1306618049152262149 2020-09-17 23:36:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Did you see the guy respond to me say “Trumps rhetoric”? That’s how uninformed they are. 😂
1306611903787970562 2020-09-17 23:12:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So I jumped into Nancy’s gotta break the law to get my hair done LIVE feed on the #heroesact and I was first limited then was blocked by moderator for asking this question:   Who’s burning down cities, destroying businesses and shutdown the country?  https://t.co/h6ZBmvmD3n
1306607396173742091 2020-09-17 22:54:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Are ppl going to try to tell us she was scared to come forward in 2020? Watch all the #believewomen #metoo leftists come out in droves while they were quiet about Joe Biden and Tara. But hey what do we expect from ppl that donated 2M to a man that digitally raped a woman.
1306458862468308992 2020-09-17 13:04:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrAndyNgo This person works for a mental health center?! She should be a patient.

1306411815748861952 2020-09-17 09:57:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Right now.. the blue states on the west coast and East coast are broke af. NY is so broke the mayor is requiring a furlow of a week for him and his staff. CA and Oregon are begging for federal assistance. Now what?
1306410265294991360 2020-09-17 09:50:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 Isn’t it obvious? I’ve just been converted. That’s all I needed to see. 😂
1306410103885590528 2020-09-17 09:50:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Because it’s factual? Democrats kept wanting to push off everything on the president. Blue states made choices and had consequences.
1306409741833310208 2020-09-17 09:48:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarkHarrisNYC That’s not what he said.   He’s letting ppl know blue states have a problem.   States rights MATTER until you don’t want to take responsibility for the damages your own leftist policies and mandates have caused and rather have Trump be the scape goat.
1306408252687527936 2020-09-17 09:42:53 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MarineCorpsRob Don’t be like Kyle.
1306407325196931078 2020-09-17 09:39:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Yes you can say huevos too. Huevos means eggs and slang for balls.
1306407145508802560 2020-09-17 09:38:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker No worries. You want to say cojones.
1306406896287412225 2020-09-17 09:37:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @rubycramer Thank you for reminding us how fkin violent the left is and how they’ve created terrorist cells across the country to push their fascism and intimidation in order to get what they want politically.
1306406284279783425 2020-09-17 09:35:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They committed a crime. I don’t care who the fk their friends are, what they do for a living or where their parents are from. Maybe if they were studying to be lawyers they’d fking know that they shouldn’t break the law!!
1306404975757594625 2020-09-17 09:29:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Nalgas? Ass cheeks? 😂

1306402458311090176 2020-09-17 09:19:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @BrokenSparrow5 They think it helps, but they have lost support over all.  https://t.co/Te1Mcuxitv
1306399598919864322 2020-09-17 09:08:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gameoverman7 They are literally wiping their ass with the flag. So disrespectful. *smh*
1306399306446856192 2020-09-17 09:07:21 +0800 <HarleyMonster> They illegally march in the streets and block traffic yet again. Blocking the roads is NOT peaceful you are actively blocking everyone else’s LIBERTY.

1306364230212268032 2020-09-17 06:47:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RealBrandonDonk So twitter put a choice message under your tweet asking me..   Is this tweet worth your time?   YES or NO buttons. So weird.   Of course I said Yes. 😂  https://t.co/tWsj34a7xF
1306356438952861696 2020-09-17 06:17:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> That’s because there aren’t enough cops plus they are being sent to stop riots and destruction of property. This isn’t a good thing.

1306307304124366848 2020-09-17 03:01:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Sheep have a herd mentality.
1306306907888480256 2020-09-17 03:00:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Translation: They scream Nazi at the top of their lungs, but have no clue what it means or what they did.
1306303155534090240 2020-09-17 02:45:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @gmfunk It’s a joke, but you’re a leftists so jokes aren’t allowed.

1306260173204328449 2020-09-16 23:54:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Oh dear.. this actually proves what the actual fascists (the left) would do if they ever got control and convinced the masses.

1306119490279669760 2020-09-16 14:35:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Well leftists are garbage ppl..
1306118539401543680 2020-09-16 14:31:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap Oh it might not change, but making them absolutely helpless against what’s to come will. No more mister nice guy.

Then you hear he was arrested for brandishing a weapon?! He has rights under the constitution to bear arms!   Wtf is wrong with @MilwaukeePolice defending these harassers?! This is why they do it!
1306115002965794818 2020-09-16 14:17:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ShoelessAncap Oh I do.. they have to be completely demoralized in this election. Have their legs pulled right from underneath them. They believe they are the MAJORITY.. we have to show them THEY AREN’T!

1306106770218049536 2020-09-16 13:44:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Demanding cops be arrested after they’ve already been investigated and did not intend to kill Breonna?  The officers were shot at and they returned fire &amp; that’s what got her killed. These ppl have no clue what they are talking about, everything is based off emotions.
1306097092406857728 2020-09-16 13:06:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ExitRowSnoozer @ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump My convo was legitimate Biden uses prompters for “live” Q&amp;As and still messes up. 🤷🏻‍♀️  Love to see how well he does without them.

1306051759849127936 2020-09-16 10:06:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Did the individual have a deportation order issued by the court?   From the article: “The woman had waived her right to appeal her deportation in July, long before the allegations became public.”

1305725727656960001 2020-09-15 12:30:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TheRickyDavila FYI 2M+ Americans die every year. In fact 2.7M died while Obama was President. So while you freak out over COVID deaths I’m thinking the number stays relatively steady at that 2M+.  https://t.co/a9nyvKI6zG

1305686995167973377 2020-09-15 09:56:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Klingenlaufer I’ve wondered that myself. It’s exactly why Kayne said this.. ppl tried to twist it by saying slavery isn’t a choice, but they weren’t thinking like he was. He’s basically saying 400 yrs is along time to remain in servitude especially if you’re “superior”.  https://t.co/mbgRE0Fpy9
1305686313769689088 2020-09-15 09:54:10 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GovHowardDean Those are the undocumented entering the country illegally. Their children weren’t “stolen”.
1305684574484086784 2020-09-15 09:47:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> “Slave ships” that make “slaves” millions and got them living in million dollar mansions.
1305683126467719168 2020-09-15 09:41:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The guy should NOT be in the road blocking traffic, much less jumping on the cop car and banging on the hood and expect nothing to happen.

They are affectively getting a ton of ppl to vote for Trump.   So thank you so much!
1305667508620279808 2020-09-15 08:39:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Blogaboutagirl @GeraltofPDX1 @thehill FYI “emotional intelligence” has nothing to do with IQ. 😂 This study finds that ppl that vote republican aren’t as emotional or don’t let their emotions drive their opinions.   Citing this as an example of lower IQ among republicans makes you look ridiculous.
1305666157068779521 2020-09-15 08:34:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Blogaboutagirl @GeraltofPDX1 @thehill Really? Hmm did you know those who vote democrat are less likely to know that the earth goes around the sun? 😂 Yea y’all smart as hell.  https://t.co/D4iMWMxf5x

1305665120782016517 2020-09-15 08:29:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Blogaboutagirl @GeraltofPDX1 @thehill So saying rioting and looting is a problem currently is an “old man” opinion?   Well fk.   I’m sure looting weave from hair salons puts an end to all racism too.
1305631871305314304 2020-09-15 06:17:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Also would need to know where the procedure was done. You can’t do a hysterectomy just anywhere. It has to be a medical facility in case there are any complications.   Getting surgery like that requires a lot of consents. It’s just the law.
1305630964136079361 2020-09-15 06:14:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker To compare it to a concentration camp is ridiculous. When you are in concentration camps they don’t get consent from patients. They just do it, but like I said they are pushing this narrative because it’s an election year.
1305628213893197824 2020-09-15 06:03:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LauraWhitt32 Beer can.. 😂
1305628049723908096 2020-09-15 06:02:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker There are doctors who would opt for removal of the uterus if a cyst or fibroid was an issue. We can’t know what the doctor saw. Some STDs can cause a lot of problems for the uterus which could require removal.   All depends what is found out about each case medically.
1305624728145506304 2020-09-15 05:49:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SaneSeeker Oh definitely worth an investigation, but to try to blame it on ICE is kinda dumb. It’s obviously the practice of a certain physician that sees patients there. That’s who should be reported not the ICE facility.   They just want to tie it to Trump somehow.
1305618476828995585 2020-09-15 05:24:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So one specific doctor was the issue? ICE agents aren’t medical. They trust the medical staff to know what they are doing. Funny how this flips to an ICE issue when per the article it was 1 particular doctor who was doing these MASS HYSTERECTOMIES.  https://t.co/JJ127jgjU6

1305390003984330753 2020-09-14 14:16:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @jack_venator You’d think so, but you know leftists toss that out the window as soon as they have to defend an accused rapist like Jacob Blake because he black and make him a millionaire. While his victim has to go into hiding.  https://t.co/N6BQLingA7

You are pushing how only black lives matter right now. How all lives can’t matter until black lives do. Well maybe remind black ppl of that while they are killing each other in Chicago every weekend.  https://t.co/wormvwFvlg

I told you ppl removed statues and tell me have riots and racism ceased? Nope. They wanted BLM on sports buildings, tshirts and called for the BLACK national anthem has that stopped racism?
1305387498428796928 2020-09-14 14:06:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @T_Swiizzle_ @JoeyNada76 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @OANN Also I supported Hillary in 2016, but of course that’s difficult for someone like you to understand. Socialists tend to run on emotions.   So what you’re saying is the left is racist?   That’s what I’ve been telling you. You’re a racist.

I said what do they want that will solve racism once and for all. Giving me a wishlist isn’t a solution.   I can say give me $1M to help. Does it help? Your wishlist will be different then someone else’s who’ll want more.

That’s not a first step that’s a demand for something that makes no fking change. The left removed statues and they’re still protesting about racism. So now what?

Because according to your wishlist doing all those things ends racism magically somehow.

What benefits does affordable housing have for ppl who moved out of the city to live there?   You haven’t answered how YOUR wish list ends racism. Unless of course you think only POC do weed &amp; live in affordable housing.

Which means the ACA has to be repealed in it’s entirety in order to be replaced with something that doesn’t require those things. You can’t piece meal ACA it’s written in a way that you can’t do that.

Due to the ACA requirements/standard insurances are too expensive for those who are healthy because they are off setting cost for the sick.

Especially ones that they aren’t able to change to accommodate their medical needs. Not everyone’s needs are the same.   Should men have to pay for prenatal care options they will never need?

The states that expanded ACA to give ppl insur hasn’t changed. Some states preferred not to add state debt.  https://t.co/Yi5bvdh3un

If ppl lost insurance it’s because they chose not to have insurance once the mandate was removed because they weren’t forced to anymore. That’s not Trump removing insurance that’s ppl having a CHOICE.

1305261136242065408 2020-09-14 05:44:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NathanielDunn17 Yes it is. The funny thing is the game also give him an “elite QB rating in the videogame”. 😂
1305260730560569344 2020-09-14 05:43:03 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NathanielDunn17 Yes it is..    https://t.co/xSHw99mdRN
1305260498644946945 2020-09-14 05:42:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I think ppl that talk like this should be investigated. Why do these ppl defend with such enthusiasm the sexualization and exploitation of children? I don’t get it.
1305259889149665280 2020-09-14 05:39:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @dandrezner So you think because it is a French film that somehow exploitation of children stops at our border and can’t be called out in other countries as a humanitarian issue? 🤔   Why would you justify exploitation of children? do you partake in their solicitation?
1305258974514569217 2020-09-14 05:36:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Kaeperdick couldn’t get an NFL job so they had to pretend for Madden. 😂 Who’s gonna want him with these career stats as their starter?  https://t.co/1VAFzjWqAL

1305257624082890753 2020-09-14 05:30:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> An “alarming rise in hunger” in places where hunger was already an issue. What did you think shutting countries down would do under socialism? There is still a hierarchy under socialism.

Trump didn’t lie. YOU did!

Why do you support the illegal trafficking of children across the border? That’s pretty immoral of you.

If their is only a break down of how ppl identify versus where the polling was conducted that says a lot. The breakdown is essential to get an accurate polling. It’s common sense for most of us who think logically.

I don’t trust polls much. I rather trust what I’m seeing happening out on the streets and at the rallies.
1304970104292081664 2020-09-13 10:28:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GuyCucks @JoeyNada76 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump @OANN That’s how simplistic ppl are with polls. They hear 60% of Latinos in a Buzzfeed poll are voting for Biden. They actually think that represents the whole of Latinos. He merely showed the number of who was polled and that had ppl up in arms. Here’s some polls.. look familiar?  https://t.co/6GgshHpeLY

For instance if you polled 638 Latinos in CA what difference does it make if 60% of those in CA vote for Biden?   CA is a blue state. Do you get that?  https://t.co/Ge3pOcN970

If it’s a national poll we’d need to know which states.

This is exactly why this hispanic is voting for Trump you ppl are crazy!

Not sure how you don’t understand the image he posted which is in the article. 638 ppl who “identify” as Latino were polled.   60% of 638 is 382.

Just that it’s available just like the right to try meds and procedures that ppl can try if they want. I also heard there are several different ones. I’d like to see the info on how it changes your DNA tho.
1304633079126917120 2020-09-12 12:08:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Fixing the record on actual deaths from COVID with NO UNDERLYING issues is necessary. Imagine a person has a heart attack and that person tests COVID+ and they die because of organ shutdown and they claim it was “COVID complications”. Why don’t we speak about survival numbers?
1304630979592511490 2020-09-12 12:00:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> It is political because Trump already has a vaccine plan and now democrats are down playing it. If this had been a democrat who was in office the praise would be endless but since it’s Trump the vaccine can’t be trusted. I thought they wanted to save lives?
1304608753031852033 2020-09-12 10:32:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Funny how accusing political opponents of doing drugs wasn’t a problem for the last 4 yrs against Trump but Trump says it about Biden and all of a sudden you ppl have a problem? 😂 Good grief. #hypocrats  https://t.co/9JLRVpZQHP
1304605047465021440 2020-09-12 10:17:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SomeWelder Yup.
1304603510944813057 2020-09-12 10:11:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @EmersenLee Thanks Em. I’m sure you’ve seen some of your own.
1304593006071148545 2020-09-12 09:29:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> As my buddy DJ who I miss so much said, “shut up Drac!”

1304589347564343297 2020-09-12 09:15:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lil_brown_bat @benyt Well I hope you feel better about correcting the “garner” part of what I said.   Now if it wasn’t something ppl do for clout and praise why have all these hashtags #lgbtvisibility #LGBTQoftwitter #BlackTransLivesMatter   I mean if it’s so scary to come out these days..
1304588539636510720 2020-09-12 09:12:00 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lil_brown_bat @benyt If it wasn’t something that ppl do for clout and money why the need to write articles about ppl coming out as lgbt? Why the need to tell ppl about your personal life at all? Let me know all the negative press they got for coming out as lgbt in 2019?    https://t.co/tzGb62uCvF
1304587600007553027 2020-09-12 09:08:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lil_brown_bat @benyt Of course they have. Look at Hollywood.

1304555505080131585 2020-09-12 07:00:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine starring in a film called #Unpregnant and not seeing the irony.

1304552741088497669 2020-09-12 06:49:45 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @MrMichaelBurkes Nope didn’t even realize it was on. Nor did I watch the NBA.
1304552637568704513 2020-09-12 06:49:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left have always been hypocrites.
1304552453883400198 2020-09-12 06:48:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Oh Joe you should really stay out of this one.. you are now siding with these ppl.. 😂  https://t.co/Q5U3XGMuYy
1304551693691088898 2020-09-12 06:45:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AlyssaRosenberg So you post a Washington post opinion piece as your go to for responsible and honest?   Sorry I’m not a cultural arbiter of child exploitation Alyssa. Kinda sad you would defend this so much. If you don’t want children being sexualized don’t sexualize them for profit either.

1304539475159130112 2020-09-12 05:57:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @atrupar Is Biden gonna do that drug test before the debates? I mean we know his son Hunter is privy to some quality stuff if he needs an upper.  https://t.co/u1NNmuCU2V
1304534395512975366 2020-09-12 05:36:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead @owillis That’s the thing. They want to claim these are “peaceful protests” while most of us are witnessing the reality of it all. This is a PEACEFUL BLM protest in Portland.. they say Antifa is a myth but now are claiming Antifa has highjacked the BLM movement. So which is it?  https://t.co/QKuc8XoaYT
1304532814352662528 2020-09-12 05:30:34 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @moodyredhead @owillis I mean it’s pretty simple to figure out if they just looked at the BLM site. Says it right there.. “board President” they are trying to get away from being held responsible for the crimes ppl are committing while claiming they are BLM activists.  https://t.co/UEYRJ9fj5p
1304532314148368384 2020-09-12 05:28:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @owillis Hmmm well someone is organizing them globally. Let’s look..  https://t.co/x21g4xtLQm

1304528389651357696 2020-09-12 05:12:59 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @bazylitch Good grief can’t even tell these days. That’s how insane the left has become in the last 4 yrs.
1304528119181713408 2020-09-12 05:11:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @KatC906 @IlhanMN “Speak your truth” it should never be YOUR truth just the TRUTH is fine.
1304525631967821825 2020-09-12 05:02:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> You are so hard to stomach. So I’m guessing you will be thanking the president for his efforts on getting peace in the Middle East now?
1304520833151295488 2020-09-12 04:42:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Deplorablawyer @McDonalds @BurgerKing Seems like a correlation of sorts. lol
1304516733571493888 2020-09-12 04:26:40 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @AtomicMexican77 Oh you know it. Election years are a hell of a ride.
1304514173074776064 2020-09-12 04:16:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Why after the election? Does she think it’s gonna disappear like some sort of miracle by then?

1304510599364141057 2020-09-12 04:02:18 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Democrats ruining the lives of young athletes who have worked so hard to get into the @NFL, @MLB &amp; @NBA.   Imagine if @KingJames had been in HS during this time and unable to play for scouts. There would be NO LeBron James in the NBA.
1304508911836258304 2020-09-12 03:55:35 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lil_brown_bat @benyt I’ll be honest probably more on the left who have come out recently in order to garnish more popularity and money for themselves. Therefore diminishing this “homophobia” accusation ppl keep tossing out.
1304507668707631110 2020-09-12 03:50:39 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @lil_brown_bat @benyt So then you feel the same way about anyone who comes out for clout and money? Plenty on the left who do the same.
1304507286329503744 2020-09-12 03:49:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And this is supposed to help @McDonalds and @BurgerKing how?
1304504643318415360 2020-09-12 03:38:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @benyt Why does the left hate gay conservatives?   Thiel “made history as the convention's first out gay speaker”   Thiel met with ONE “white nationalist” that buzzfeed refuses to name. Why not name him?  https://t.co/WbPnO6TsHh
1304503786719731712 2020-09-12 03:35:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @JuddLegum So who was this “white nationalist”? Is this the same “white nationalist” that’s going all in for Biden and democrats this election cycle?   Is that why whoever wrote this refused to say their name?  https://t.co/LvQn1bxPAY
1304501841862864896 2020-09-12 03:27:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @NFL 😞  https://t.co/Ulg2S8j2Uu

1304499941692174336 2020-09-12 03:19:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Seems like she’s demanding black privilege with NO MASK and getting in a woman’s face spreading her germs while her preferred pronoun is Queen. 😂
1304499216799072257 2020-09-12 03:17:04 +0800 <HarleyMonster> PSA: Twitter is NOT real life.   This is especially true for all the lefties who come here to understand how Americans feel about politics or the president.   Some right leaning ppl have been permanently deboosted and removed from this site so the intolerant left can deal.
1304495963906568192 2020-09-12 03:04:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @meggd123 Are you saying BLM are terrorists who are killing thousands?   Remind me how being against terrorism makes someone racist again? I missed that part in my racial studies and communications class.
1304495387365879808 2020-09-12 03:01:51 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Apparently gender reveals are violence backlash against trans visibility. Because we all know how much triggering the color blue and pink cause the trans community. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1304486271499157505 2020-09-12 02:25:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Trunks11198212 That’s horrible. *smh* It’s a historic moment in history and on 9/11. They are too busy trying to save Biden’s presidential bid from all his blunders.
1304478783919906817 2020-09-12 01:55:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @duty2warn Imagine mocking an immigrant woman on 9/11 for twitter clout. Leftists are the lowest of the low.

1304475445040087040 2020-09-12 01:42:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> #HistoricMiddleEastPeaceDeal is happening now! I wonder how CNN and MSNBC will report it? 🤔
1304474849180397568 2020-09-12 01:40:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Tell me why a film about exploiting and sexualizing children while exploiting and sexualizing children for money doesn’t bother you Alyssa?
1304473089506381829 2020-09-12 01:33:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder how many ppl that are currently protesting in Minneapolis screaming “No justice No peace” saw the body cam footage released about the George Floyd arrest?   Protesting to force the judicial system to cave to your will and grant a conviction is wrong.
1304471570019094528 2020-09-12 01:27:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> This means that none of this was LIVE &amp; that Biden was given these questions before so his staff could come up with appropriate answers.   How is this man supposed to run the country? He’s a literal PUPPET with other ppl pulling his strings. *smh*
1304469711829127169 2020-09-12 01:19:49 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @HKrassenstein Keeping it out completely and it being said loudly on mic is clearly the same thing for Biden voters.

1304467980227506176 2020-09-12 01:12:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RedSoledGooner @therecount Ahhh because you aren’t an American?
1304467561094938624 2020-09-12 01:11:17 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now ask yourself who benefits from causing Americans stress and lowering their immune system so they are unable to fight off antigens?   Why do you think democrats have been repeating the death numbers in their arguments while NEVER mentioning the recovery numbers?  https://t.co/vLcLy8EDRH
1304466534157283328 2020-09-12 01:07:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> While the left attacks Trump on saying COVID “was like the flu” lets not forget Obama did the same when H1N1 came to the US.   Had Obama been screaming millions will die from H1N1, the stress he would have put on Americans would have made them *more* susceptible to illness.  https://t.co/Jchd98Hwx0
1304464566483447809 2020-09-12 00:59:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @RedSoledGooner @therecount Yet I can bet you’re voting for Biden..
1304464348526510080 2020-09-12 00:58:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tjtwo1961 @therecount So a woman has to do the tackling over the pledge in Biden’s America?  https://t.co/IpTVvThIhJ
1304463524672860161 2020-09-12 00:55:14 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Ok so.. the black national anthem is ok to play during an @nfl game, but the American national anthem isn’t?  Which sounds more inclusive?
1304461948008820737 2020-09-12 00:48:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @DaveBurress I’m guessing the latter and him trying to save face..

1304443930314813440 2020-09-11 23:37:23 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TeddytheDudeMa1 @JFNYC1 Why someone running for the highest office in the country showing cognitive decline doesn’t bother you is more concerning.
1304443005517074433 2020-09-11 23:33:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So I just heard on the news that 6 teachers have died of COVID since school started. 1 of the teachers died just 1 week after returning to school.   So I ask you how is it that “going back to school” caused her to die from COVID in just 1 week? 🤔  https://t.co/Kwk7xkKEXi
1304440182674841600 2020-09-11 23:22:29 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Tampke Wasn’t it? It was everything I wanted to say in a British accent. 😂
1304440038013374466 2020-09-11 23:21:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Our military doing a flyover to show how NY and this country is protected from terrorists ever doing this again is now wrong? 🤔

1304436989299572736 2020-09-11 23:09:48 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Using 9/11 American deaths to push M4A is pretty fkin disgusting. When you didn’t think these ppl could go any lower. #NeverForget

1304278855906017280 2020-09-11 12:41:26 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I am completely and utterly outraged by this.. *This* is how they groom your children for pedophiles.

1304211547145682944 2020-09-11 08:13:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree Did you just skip over this part from my link? To prevent any other flu? So in fact Obama knew its was similar to the flu just a different strain? Hmmm.  https://t.co/8I1bk0wKTl
1304211169469591554 2020-09-11 08:12:28 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree Actually looks like you do. Are you aware that H1N1 is a coronavirus.   Again you’d have to understand basics of viruses. If you were so concerned with viruses then every flu season you’d get a vaccine and wear a mask afraid you are possibly infecting someone.  https://t.co/caoMDEnUGj
1304197697012772864 2020-09-11 07:18:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree The media and the left only called protecting the country from COVID xenophobic and racist. 😂
1304197187283288064 2020-09-11 07:16:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree I don’t it’s in the statement. Isn’t that what the media does constantly to Trump?   When the left was screeching he had called the coronavirus a hoax...  https://t.co/Ml1unUbBZa
1304196162157592577 2020-09-11 07:12:50 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree Funny looks to me like Trump was more open about what was going on. Had COVID briefings all the time. Spoke on record more often about it than Obama ever did about H1N1. Most definitely not the same.   So feel like answering my question on whether Obama said H1N1 was liked flu?  https://t.co/XJjhPApwvf
1304191641578684416 2020-09-11 06:54:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree Also I work in healthcare. I bet you’d be shocked to know how some ppl actually died while it was determined to be COVID “related”. 🤷🏻‍♀️
1304191051624665088 2020-09-11 06:52:32 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree I’m really glad you focused on the didn’t panic part it’s what I was hoping for.   As you can see Obama didn’t panic either in fact he also claimed H1N1 was like the “flu” and to take the same precautions as we are now with COVID weird. 🤔  So keep screeching hypocrite.
1304190479014096896 2020-09-11 06:50:15 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree Did Obama say H1N1 was like the flu?  https://t.co/C05ENebKNG
1304190148297461760 2020-09-11 06:48:56 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree Why do I need to include it? Do you think Obama panicked and said thousands would die during H1N1?   Or did he respond accordingly? He also stated that H1N1 was like the flu.. funny how that info is readily available but you don’t seem to care.    https://t.co/pNS92YfWnB
1304186986161266690 2020-09-11 06:36:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree Now to my point...   Was Obama a world leader? YES   Did Obama lie?  https://t.co/EtqErvVYmV
1304186440121688065 2020-09-11 06:34:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @TJM3ree “Funny how other world leaders never felt the need to lie.”   This is a broad statement. Of course world leaders lie. To claim that Trump is somehow the only one is pretty fkin rich.
1304180934036520961 2020-09-11 06:12:19 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Where’s that Russian info you had and was in plain sight you liar?!
1304175719216484354 2020-09-11 05:51:36 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @oktrainwreck @Travistritt @RealJamesWoods Sounds like a logical conclusion.
1304175607417171968 2020-09-11 05:51:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Big_Pauley @pi_mij @1776CC @TJM3ree I don’t think you know what fascism is. Or how fascism is used to intimidate your political opponents.   Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence &amp; war as means that can achieve their political goal.  https://t.co/vcmMlWem79

Manafort had dealings with Ukraine and Russia prior to being part of the Trump campaign. He was not indicted for having contact w/Russians he was indicted for lying about the “black ledger”.

The internet literally located the murderer the same day it happened. Posted images and his name.   Unlike Conservatives, they DO NOT turn themselves in.
1300995243328716801 2020-09-02 11:13:31 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Kmiller39Miller @benshapiro Donald Trump isn’t shutting down salon businesses and fining ppl for opening and then sneaking into a salon to get their own hair cut.   Dems are the biggest fkin hypocrites on the planet.

1300886110118187009 2020-09-02 03:59:52 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Makes me wonder what he’s scared of? 🤔 It’s weird he’d flip like this.  https://t.co/yzsC7waS74
1300884625737134080 2020-09-02 03:53:58 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump got the left to make the so called “myth” that is antifa trend.. 😂  https://t.co/t9Ukw9sEJ4
1300884213151875072 2020-09-02 03:52:20 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I thought antifa was a myth? You don’t even realize how you were duped to make this so called “non existent” antifa trend. 😂🤣😂
1300883400081813504 2020-09-02 03:49:06 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left and their conspiracy theories about Trump. 😂  https://t.co/bBhoc8GxLO
1300882652820418561 2020-09-02 03:46:08 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Imagine being so fkin miserable that you hate white ppl smiling at you.
1300882172241305600 2020-09-02 03:44:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Trump flags and MAGA hats.
1300838716336873474 2020-09-02 00:51:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Klingenlaufer @TaranaBurke #metoo my ass.
1300838555166494720 2020-09-02 00:50:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @syl_capulet1 @TaranaBurke Yup.. he’s a fkin criminal. If he was caught with the illegal possession of a gun and had previously assaulted officers it’s no wonder when he resisted arrest he got shot.  https://t.co/O568qRDaDw
1300833344238710787 2020-09-02 00:30:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The @nfl put the name of a rapist on their helmets.   We already knew they defended spousal abusers.   They even made that rapist a millionaire.  https://t.co/lJEwNkAXJb
1300833157554397184 2020-09-02 00:29:27 +0800 <HarleyMonster> So ppl can’t help Kyle Rittenhouse who acted in self defense against those who assaulted him on gofundme, but a rapist can be made a millionaire on their site? #metoo Imagine how the victim of Blake’s rape feels seeing this @TaranaBurke?  https://t.co/uR24oxEEzr
1300695452799569920 2020-09-01 15:22:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @secjr112 Here you go..  https://t.co/JMdNDiaMUW

1300695271605563394 2020-09-01 15:21:33 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @tariqnasheed Guess you must feel a certain way about white blacks too.   Fredi Washington  https://t.co/WBuxaZ5QIb
1300693718966575105 2020-09-01 15:15:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Wtf?! The clownery.
1300693159135997954 2020-09-01 15:13:09 +0800 <HarleyMonster> If Biden refuses to debate Trump he will not recover politically from that.  https://t.co/iJTSxhIdzh
1300688892765454336 2020-09-01 14:56:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Yes, if you are assaulted you have the right to defend yourself. Unlike the leftist antifa goon who murdered Jay just for turning the corner w/a hat they didn’t like.
1300688116240412674 2020-09-01 14:53:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @snauka420 Actually it never happened because even those who disliked Obama and thought he wasn’t doing a good job weren’t emotional nutters who demanded someone be removed just because they wanted him to be.   The ppl burning the country down are leftists.  https://t.co/fpRX1hNKcE
1300682103105810433 2020-09-01 14:29:13 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Lol. Si como no.  https://t.co/B9kP7jBxws

1300680604808142849 2020-09-01 14:23:16 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian Nada, aquí echada. Qué pasó con tu cuenta loco? Pórtate bien!
1300679330008162304 2020-09-01 14:18:12 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @LoneStarTexian 👈🏼 oh look who’s back.
1300678931394117633 2020-09-01 14:16:37 +0800 <HarleyMonster> I wonder how many times leftists have made this trend in the last 3+ yrs.. 😂 #25thAmendmentNow
1300677860798074881 2020-09-01 14:12:22 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Ja1Ke3 Haha thank goodness.
1300675436423163904 2020-09-01 14:02:44 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Leftists admitting to watching Ingraham clips
1300674737547309056 2020-09-01 13:59:57 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @SenSchumer She didn’t have to save him. He’s gonna say what he wants regardless of what Laura says.
1300674152920043520 2020-09-01 13:57:38 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @ikebarinholtz You obviously don’t watch Ingram very often.
1300663277941223425 2020-09-01 13:14:25 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Scottcoby1 Why would Trump supporters riot and assault officers? Like do they even hear what they are saying?   They are trying to flip the script after claiming these were just “peaceful protests”. Now they are saying, “Well see they were Trump supporters dressed as rioters!”  https://t.co/enZ9mxFf3F
1300661140003803136 2020-09-01 13:05:55 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @GeraltofPDX1 How many Trump supporters do you think live in Portland? Ffs they can’t even drive thru the city supporting the president without triggering fascists enough to murder Jay in cold blood.
1300660685555154944 2020-09-01 13:04:07 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Now do Joe Biden..

1300641956465311744 2020-09-01 11:49:41 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @1BasedMechanic They don’t even know what they are resisting at this point. It’s just all Orange Man Bad bs
1300641152396271619 2020-09-01 11:46:30 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Then you probably should have told Obama to never have built them in the first place.
1300640247198265344 2020-09-01 11:42:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The cowards and bigots always post some weak ass sh*t then block. Resister Hoes mad because they been clowned for months to wear a mask. 🤣  https://t.co/bZoz1tvf6h

1300633991830147072 2020-09-01 11:18:02 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Beachgirlpt @elanooch @DilaraEsengil @politicalamity2 Ever heard of photoshop? Now you’re saying Jennifer Love Hewitt is a man because you don’t like the way her pregnant belly looks? Is Katy Perry a man too?  https://t.co/Khks3IgSVP
1300631438715363328 2020-09-01 11:07:54 +0800 <HarleyMonster> And you call yourself an MD? 🤦🏻‍♀️ That does not look like foot drop. He looks like he’s intentionally swinging his leg out. Foot drop doesn’t do that. Also his arm was weak from saluting 600 cadets during “watergate”. And y’all call us conspiracy theorists. 😂
1300628798723907585 2020-09-01 10:57:24 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Paulette3052 @thehill Do you have to be black to realize there’s discrimination?
1300623859259904003 2020-09-01 10:37:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @Beachgirlpt @elanooch @DilaraEsengil @politicalamity2 She looks pretty pregnant here just saying.  https://t.co/hhU6xBbyUb
1300601060650745856 2020-09-01 09:07:11 +0800 <HarleyMonster> @facedowndead Of course he did. He needed the income he never cared about his constituents.
1300600707540680704 2020-09-01 09:05:47 +0800 <HarleyMonster> The left is soooo racist and bigoted. Good lord. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1300584327881748480 2020-09-01 08:00:42 +0800 <HarleyMonster> Boy, the left really goes hard for rapists and pedos don’t they? #metoo Blake got his name put on helmets @NFL. What of his victim?!  https://t.co/wuB9sVbeHd
