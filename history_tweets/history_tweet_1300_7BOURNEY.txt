1319154864946020352 2020-10-22 13:53:23 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @antedwards But testing positive doesnt mean they’re dying! I expect if the whole world got tested 95% of us have it! It’s not abadge of honour getting tested and being positive! That’s like me getting tested for having MS! It’s not about knowing you have it, it’s to get the right treatment
1318900724365955073 2020-10-21 21:03:31 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @BorisJohnson @MattHancock Why are you telling people to get tested with a test that doesn’t work? If they’ve got it you can’t treat it so what’s the point? Why shut down business’s? I why force the economy into another recession? What’s your point? You’re killing your country
1318803204503646209 2020-10-21 14:36:00 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @SmithTarquin Don’t worry about it! Beat him n bury him. The police don’t have time to follow up missing persons..

1318075162923835392 2020-10-19 14:23:02 +0800 <7BOURNEY> Why? How long have people been wearing masks? Has the infection stopped rising? #completewasteoftime! We have to get back to normal and learn to live with this! Ffs! Masks are far more dangerous than fresh air!!!
1318069148866457601 2020-10-19 13:59:08 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @realDonaldTrump Why must you slag people off in the hope to cause hate? And confusion? If you’re that great, let it show.
1317848197998497793 2020-10-18 23:21:09 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @BorisJohnson @BBCBreakfast @GMB So how long have you been wearing masks? How often do you change them? How often do you wash them? And when did numbers stop going up because of your ‘hard work’ Answer? You can’t! Because it’s a complete waste of time!

However, the writing on the poisonous pen letter you received was nearly identical to his. I’m no writing expert but I’m assuming it’s an older person by the style of writing?
1313165749704445952 2020-10-06 01:14:46 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @Love_Nature2020 Theres a video on social media which states that changes to the Control of Disease came into force in April 2020 regarding vaccines and Covid-19 medical treatmmean that the Government has the power to force medication on you and that this means vaccines.

1302825251403956224 2020-09-07 12:25:19 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @Prisoner0071 Go to CEO annual salary - it’s disgusting how much hard earned cash gets wasted on the ‘big wigs’ and so called ‘admin’ fees.

1302598963388911618 2020-09-06 21:26:08 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @Prisoner0071 I agree! Totally inappropriate and definitely not family entertainment!  It’s Britain’s Got Talent not Look how the British can take the piss out of American hysteria! 🤬
1302596883509018630 2020-09-06 21:17:52 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @antedwards Take that stupid mask off! You’re outside!! Xxx
1302258531186466822 2020-09-05 22:53:23 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @Andrea62928413 Yes earl grey!
1302203154201743362 2020-09-05 19:13:20 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @RealDeniseWelch @WWonker17 It’s obvious! They want to push this “new” vaccine!!! It’s why Cummings didn’t get the sack by ‘testing his eyesight’ driving!!
1302145399222874112 2020-09-05 15:23:50 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @BBCBreakfast it’s over 20 years since I went to raves BUT ravers don’t hug! They’re individuals who love to throw their own moves! It’s not house/pop/hip hop which might involve hugging/grinding. So why fine them? This is ridiculous! The government are ruining the economy!
1302133666357936129 2020-09-05 14:37:13 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @RealDeniseWelch It’s only scaremongering to try n force the vaccine! Boris did me a favour not sacking Cumming because that told me it’s all fake! Since then I’ve been everywhere inc on holiday in Zante! Cafes, supermarkets and not worn a mask once! And I have a very serious medical condition

1301626567844663297 2020-09-04 05:02:11 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @PartingtonSarah @BBCBreakfast We came back from ZANTE 2 weeks ago and had a fantastic time! Shock! Greece - woah! watch out keyboard warriors! Family of 4 AND I have a very serious underlying medical condition! The only thing we brought back was fantastic tans! Quarantine is a complete unnecessary farce!

1301613566961868800 2020-09-04 04:10:31 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @BBCBreakfast So most people will test positive for ‘a’ type of virus but even the news reported; they haven’t got a conclusive test yet! Boris is wasting thousands of British tax payers money on this farcical ‘project’ And if they’ve got no physical symptoms, probably healing naturally!
1301193094008836104 2020-09-03 00:19:43 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @nytimes Load of rubbish! What type of steroids are they talking about? From personal experience, they can do more harm than good if used incorrectly! And yes mine were for medical reasons!

1301057409381797889 2020-09-02 15:20:33 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @TripeUK @mjdtoffee I’m also a patient of a very serious underlying medical condition so I think it would have reared it’s ugly head by now!
1301051714255101957 2020-09-02 14:57:55 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @garethicke They can keep their poisonous vaccine too!
1301050874345783298 2020-09-02 14:54:35 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @LesleyManning18 @hannahthomasitv Just because they tested positive doesn’t mean they’re sick or going to get sick! Most people’s immune system can cope with it! I’ve got a very serious underlying medical condition and been back 2 weeks and couldn’t be better!
1301049285027471360 2020-09-02 14:48:16 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @Elmhart @hannahthomasitv I returned from Zante 2 weeks ago! No symptoms, illness - just a gorgeous tan! 😎

1301048395277230082 2020-09-02 14:44:44 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @KazLloyd1 @PantonMartin @hannahthomasitv Same! It’s a joke!
1301048077768437762 2020-09-02 14:43:28 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @PantonMartin @hannahthomasitv I’ve been back from Zante for 2 weeks now. Absolutely fine! But - QR codes checked on arrival in Greece, health certificates verified and passports checked!  On returning to UK no checks at all! Yet it’s Zante holiday makers that’s being penalised?! Ridiculous!
1301035105939587072 2020-09-02 13:51:55 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @mjdtoffee It’s just that! Absolute bullshit! Why only planes landing in Cardiff? Why not London, or Nottingham or Manchester? Ffs! We’ve been back from Zante 2 weeks and absolutely no symptoms of anything! This scaremongering is ridiculous and quarantine? Economy is fucked!
1301027052083204097 2020-09-02 13:19:55 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @DC_claxton @melindiscott @SkyNews Why only Cardiff? Why not London airports or Manchester or Nottingham? What a joke! We’ve been back from Zante over 2 weeks and had a fantastic time - we didn’t have to self isolate and are all very fit and well!
1301026069093527552 2020-09-02 13:16:01 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @SkyNews Completely unnecessary! Why only planes that landed in Cardiff? Why not in London or Manchester or anywhere else?! I won’t be voting this government in again! Total farce about coronavirus! Get the economy moving again! Stop penalising holiday makers!
1300855669176893442 2020-09-02 01:58:54 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @TonyFan1420 Most definitely! Scaremongering media has killed the economy! 🙄

1300792823701295105 2020-09-01 21:49:11 +0800 <7BOURNEY> @AngelaInGeneral E - I think it’s a government plot to scaremonger people into having an unnecessary vaccine!
