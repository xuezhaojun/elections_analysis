Issue a separate pardon for each crime, forcing Trump to admit to each and every one of them and do it publicly.  Use that evidence against all of the co-conspirators

1324842460800049152 2020-11-07 06:33:51 +0800 <Anthony66499826> Best thread today!!

1324840297872953349 2020-11-07 06:25:16 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @MaryPatHector Thank you. I want to help elect two Blue Senators. Sounds like these are the folks to contact.
1324839702780874760 2020-11-07 06:22:54 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @petermarksdrama That's stark.
1324839553023299585 2020-11-07 06:22:18 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @Jennanrun @linville maybe all the networks have decided they're going to announce together so that the Trump crazies can't all descend on one of them and maybe they can get away with their lives?
1324838923986706432 2020-11-07 06:19:48 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @billyeichner Yes. Ready to knock doors for a Blue Senate.
1324838342299652103 2020-11-07 06:17:29 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @SethMacFarlane We can do that if we all get on board with GA, and help put TWO Blue Senators in Washington!!

1324833095292456961 2020-11-07 05:56:38 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @KazePlays_JC Here's the thing .   You can't make peace with someone until they have changed their ways, asked forgiveness, and you have granted it to them.   At this point the Republicans have no intention of changing their ways. They're not asking forgiveness.
1324831269591654401 2020-11-07 05:49:23 +0800 <Anthony66499826> Are we really going to just forget about all the ballots the post office refused to deliver to Blue areas? Are we?

First decide that the ballots can't be counted on Election day and then say well gosh the Democrats are cheating by trying to count these ballots after election day. Fascist pig.

1324042474223009792 2020-11-05 01:35:00 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @AddieWoolf That's based on exit polling. Exit polling traces same day voters. What about all of the mail in ballots?

Court packing is going to continue under the Democrats because the GOP changed all the rules. They're fascists. And you must crush them because they recognize no laws.

THEY ANNOUNCED IT AN HOUR AFTER RBG DIED.
1315278113006325760 2020-10-11 21:08:33 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @sladesr That's SO wrong. The GOP packed the courts by refusing to consider over 100 Obama nominees to ANY Federal court, then rammed through their own. They left a SCOTUS seat vacant rather than allow Obama to even get a vote. The courts were just packed.  A response is in order.

1313222045614956551 2020-10-06 04:58:28 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @stonecold2050 No. He has it.  Herman Cain said ALL the same stuff about feeling better. He died.  The steroids are fooling him.
1313217738358300674 2020-10-06 04:41:21 +0800 <Anthony66499826> So the #GOP settles on "don't be afraid of Covid" to own the libs..  1 million dead on earth from Covid.  209 thousand Americans dead from Covid  This is madness. Wear a mask. Avoid crowds. Vote out every last Republican.
1313216633008263168 2020-10-06 04:36:58 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @effiedog I find that life makes a hell of a lot more sense when you ignore every single word out of that  traitor's mouth.

1313214145089744897 2020-10-06 04:27:05 +0800 <Anthony66499826> This new #Resister needs some follows!

1313204012498509830 2020-10-06 03:46:49 +0800 <Anthony66499826> "Go ahead and get it. It's not so bad"  Folks if we lose this election we're all going to be in the camps.
1313203722793766913 2020-10-06 03:45:40 +0800 <Anthony66499826> Now a whole bunch of top GOP leadership has Covid including the president. But instead of admitting that the Democrats were right, the GOP has decided to turn it into a manhood test.... even though over 1 million are dead worldwide, and American Covid deaths are over 209,000.
1313202323921854464 2020-10-06 03:40:06 +0800 <Anthony66499826> So the Democrats follow the advice of doctors and use social distancing and masks and avoid large gatherings. They don't come down with any Covid cases.  The Republicans refuse to listen to the doctors gather freely and large groups with no masks even in tight indoor spaces. 1/2

1308567595243757570 2020-09-23 08:43:21 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @atrupar Another thing that's not written in the stars - nine justices on the Supreme Court.
1308467403941195776 2020-09-23 02:05:13 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @jdwickie Not if we pack the courts.
1308466880991109122 2020-09-23 02:03:09 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @HKrassenstein It's very much about the money in that church. All this crime in the international banking game also touches the Mormons.

1308454655677079554 2020-09-23 01:14:34 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @JoeBiden Joe, I need to hear you address the SCOTUS situation. I need to hear you say that you WILL pack the courts if GOP goes through with their rank hypocrisy.

1308131186259177475 2020-09-22 03:49:13 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @HKrassenstein Pelosi should just stop with the subpoenas unless she's ready to enforce them.  The Republicans treat them like toilet paper.

1305475820916531202 2020-09-14 19:57:44 +0800 <Anthony66499826> The national debt is skyrocketing. Trump's base believes it's way down.  Trump has proposed absolutely no new health care initiatives. His base believes that he has solved health Care.  We are losing.
1305475315083481093 2020-09-14 19:55:44 +0800 <Anthony66499826> Of course, Trump has done absolutely none of these things.

1305318904357703680 2020-09-14 09:34:13 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @KimRuxton THIS is fascism. One group of people has all the rights, and the rest of the people have whatever rights the other group wants to give them, knowing they can be taken away at any time.

The RW propaganda Network is everywhere, and has been operating a campaign of hatred against liberals since the 1970's. It's an article of Faith with conservatives that liberals are the biggest enemy on Earth.

1304046651238232066 2020-09-10 21:18:44 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @DWPippy No. They'll keep it up until Biden takes office so the markets will collapse on Biden's watch.  And it's going to work.
1304035930429444096 2020-09-10 20:36:08 +0800 <Anthony66499826> I'm frankly amazed that Americans haven't physically dragged this a hole out of the White House.

1304022375193866240 2020-09-10 19:42:16 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @SenKamalaHarris It sure would help if your friends in the House would invoke inherent contempt and start holding these bastards accountable.

1304018974599000064 2020-09-10 19:28:45 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @michaeldblaylo I woke up today and realized that I could not  ever call myself an independent either.  The times call for clarity.    I'm a Democrat.
1304012277750935552 2020-09-10 19:02:09 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @bryanbehar I would say that the lesson is that Russia is a very good provocateur and that they have their hands all over this government.

1303816387878678530 2020-09-10 06:03:45 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @ImJohnEli Yes. But corrupt pardons are reversible crimes.
1303815863464873986 2020-09-10 06:01:40 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @TeamPelosi And you refuse to IMPEACH this Traitor again.  Like you refuse to hold Barr in contempt and impeach him.  Why?!!
1303814487447924743 2020-09-10 05:56:12 +0800 <Anthony66499826> @TeamPelosi Meanwhile, Inherent Contempt remains tabled. Your subpoenas are a joke because you won't enforce them.  And Trump/GOP know it.

Many Americans grew up with Hate radio and television as daily, constant background. To them, no enemy is as dangerous as a Liberal.
