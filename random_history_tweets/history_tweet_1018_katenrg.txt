1341222221759406080 2020-12-22 11:21:11 +0800 <katenrg> Can't wait to see @Ann_OLeary's next move! Thanks Ann for 2 great years!
1340445068222578688 2020-12-20 07:53:03 +0800 <katenrg> @LizMair Agree on LAX - how can there be NO FOOD inside entire airport terminals (except international)? Totally bizarre. Also to walk between terminals you have to cross the entire parking structure.
1340342326191738886 2020-12-20 01:04:47 +0800 <katenrg> @jennifermhaley @USanDiegoLaw Wow, they were stuck in the 1950s. Thanks for getting them up to speed with, you know, modern life and feminism.
1340341132488667136 2020-12-20 01:00:02 +0800 <katenrg> This year, since you're not traveling (please don't!!), it's a great time to spend the break donating ($ not food) or volunteering your time at a food bank. The need has never been greater.  https://t.co/iTfxhArIl2
1340088725930315776 2020-12-19 08:17:04 +0800 <katenrg> These are super cool; I want to move here. Thanks @kdeleon for always working to turn ideas to action.
1339988242523811840 2020-12-19 01:37:47 +0800 <katenrg> Great reminder that we can't have climate action without a serious regional &amp; local push on infill housing across all CA counties (incl suburban centers &amp; small towns!). Thanks @gbeltalliance &amp; @UrbanEnviroCA for elevating.  https://t.co/1VnFdT1WV3
1339729082427195392 2020-12-18 08:27:58 +0800 <katenrg> @JenGranholm @JoeBiden Thrilled for you, thrilled for the country!
1339637568715943936 2020-12-18 02:24:20 +0800 <katenrg> This amazing honor is the result of so many working across agencies and board and commissions to make sure energy efficiency is broadly shared, saves money, and creates #highroad jobs. So proud of my state!
1339637196790231040 2020-12-18 02:22:51 +0800 <katenrg> @rebleber Actually: have lawyer friend send stern letter. Then if no action, small claims court.
1339637101923426304 2020-12-18 02:22:29 +0800 <katenrg> @rebleber Small claims court.
1339636996327710720 2020-12-18 02:22:03 +0800 <katenrg> @Vicki_A_Arroyo @Carey_Writer Wow that's a beautiful dress!
1339454285830971392 2020-12-17 14:16:02 +0800 <katenrg> @loridroste @JesseArreguin @CityofBerkeley Congratulations!! So proud!
1339453899732787202 2020-12-17 14:14:30 +0800 <katenrg> I've known this kid since she was 6 and she was a powerhouse even then. You (continue to) rock, @NoraWD.  @katieporteroc is lucky.
1339115817036775424 2020-12-16 15:51:05 +0800 <katenrg> Thank you @MichaelDTubbs for being a climate champion for Stockton and for anchoring this critical @CalSGC project. You will be missed but your work lives on.
1338993491209113600 2020-12-16 07:45:00 +0800 <katenrg> Today @AirResources said goodbye to @MaryNicholsCA after decades of service and of providing a model of courage, political smarts, &amp; grit to younger #WomenInEnergy like me. There's a reason @SierraClub, @Earthjustice &amp; others have given her lifetime achievement awards!
1338989420100296708 2020-12-16 07:28:49 +0800 <katenrg> Truer words were never spoken.
1338981766544035840 2020-12-16 06:58:24 +0800 <katenrg> So proud of my friend and mentor @JenGranholm -- if anyone knows what it takes to get from ambition to on-the-ground #JustTransition for industries and communities, it's Jennifer. Right leader for the right time.
1338735096916897794 2020-12-15 14:38:14 +0800 <katenrg> @benserrurier No but I want to hear your review!
1338734064765784064 2020-12-15 14:34:08 +0800 <katenrg> Preach.
1338191203058249728 2020-12-14 02:36:59 +0800 <katenrg> Congratulations @deemyers and welcome to the team! Business and econ development are key to our carbon neutral future; can't wait to work together to find sustainable, resilient, and inclusive paths forward.
1337397140721561600 2020-12-11 22:01:40 +0800 <katenrg> Thanks @nytimes for covering this critical issue! We're reminded every day out here in CA that climate policies have to prioritize both adaptation and resilience to these immediate climate threats AND aggressive action to bring down emissions to reduce #climaterisk.
1334617759792033793 2020-12-04 05:57:24 +0800 <katenrg> Amen.
1334018678661103617 2020-12-02 14:16:52 +0800 <katenrg> @emilycwarren_ Totally hear you BUT -- also sick of those who act as if they do solve every single problem. Which they don't. Because they're just cars.
1334017363868454913 2020-12-02 14:11:39 +0800 <katenrg> @SCAGnews @LongBeachCity @CityofCostaMesa @FitchRatings @Cal_OPR Thanks so much for including me alongside these great local voices.
1334014137236480001 2020-12-02 13:58:49 +0800 <katenrg> The real question is: can we have economic recovery without climate policy? Spoiler alert: I don't believe we can.
1332156461753921536 2020-11-27 10:57:05 +0800 <katenrg> Ok so brining is SO worth it. Makes all the difference!!!
1332129212539445248 2020-11-27 09:08:48 +0800 <katenrg> Success!  https://t.co/iFFOinlNXp
1332015790837559297 2020-11-27 01:38:06 +0800 <katenrg> Congrats @JesseMelgar -- a true professional and wonderful colleague.
1331777418378416128 2020-11-26 09:50:54 +0800 <katenrg> @MattBakerEnergy Too late sadly but maybe next year!!
1331777338472759297 2020-11-26 09:50:35 +0800 <katenrg> @CleanEnergyNerd So helpful, thanks!!
1331670763389140993 2020-11-26 02:47:05 +0800 <katenrg> @AaronTBurgess @KamalaHarris I basically am, though she prefers dry brining and I'm going the other way.
1331667849824243713 2020-11-26 02:35:31 +0800 <katenrg> Brining a turkey for the first time this year. I figure why not try? Only my husband and kids will get to eat it so if I totally screw it up, the damage is minimal (though the mocking will be merciless). #staysafe #StayHomeForThanksgiving
1330937408259428354 2020-11-24 02:13:00 +0800 <katenrg> @mayorcabaldon Thank you so much for your service and especially your innovative approach on transportation - using micro-mobility to serve all your constituents. Your work will live on.
1329893389458784256 2020-11-21 05:04:26 +0800 <katenrg> Thrilled to see the Task Force report lift up the critical importance of #highroadjobs and #regionsrisetogether as key elements of our sustainable, resilience, inclusive economic future.
1329605503823933440 2020-11-20 10:00:29 +0800 <katenrg> @dfirgs Hm. So much for separation of powers.
1329604051638489088 2020-11-20 09:54:43 +0800 <katenrg> @rmchase @Anita_Sarah @LA_CoMotion @servicesflo @transportgovuk @NUMOalliance @Cal_OPR @GregorMacdonald I could have kept talking all day -- thanks to participants and audience!
1329591853142867969 2020-11-20 09:06:15 +0800 <katenrg> @DanielRaimi @rff @edf Yes we are proactively thinking about these issues as part of our just transition roadmap and our overall sustainable, equitable economic growth strategy for CA. Declining production is only part of the story.
1329121595764326400 2020-11-19 01:57:36 +0800 <katenrg> Would revise my own points to say "Early engagement with" rather than "buy-in from" (see @Cal_OPR guidance on making EJ real not just a talking point) but otherwise, yes.
1329116298354192387 2020-11-19 01:36:33 +0800 <katenrg> @sigpeterson I love people's anxiety dreams; you learn so much from them. Mine is about walking through endless grey corridors in a brutalist government building, and emerging to find myself about to speak at a press conference with no idea of the subject.
1328888288573198336 2020-11-18 10:30:32 +0800 <katenrg> @sigpeterson LOVE that show; I can't get enough. I think my humor/engagement w the world is essentially British.
1328858158702284802 2020-11-18 08:30:48 +0800 <katenrg> Incredibly important issues that interconnect with all work on equity, and on climate justice for that matter. Highly recommend.
1328595006073032704 2020-11-17 15:05:08 +0800 <katenrg> @jmijincha So jealous. 2027 is my magic year.
1328594918881824768 2020-11-17 15:04:47 +0800 <katenrg> OK this is hard to ignore. Masks up please!
1328594670247682053 2020-11-17 15:03:48 +0800 <katenrg> @jmijincha Have to admit I had the same response -- I thought one of the great things about new foundations was that they would look beyond traditional orgs and funding patterns and actually identify gaps/opportunities. I love these orgs but...really?
1328004840509874177 2020-11-16 00:00:01 +0800 <katenrg> This is incredibly powerful. PLEASE wear a mask and avoid indoor gatherings. Your life and many other lives depend on it.
1327844565030641665 2020-11-15 13:23:09 +0800 <katenrg> @JesseJenkins @JaneAFlegal @AlanLevinovitz I would argue that community organizing builds this skill. So does law school.
1327808547015458816 2020-11-15 11:00:01 +0800 <katenrg> Amen.
1327793902288478209 2020-11-15 10:01:50 +0800 <katenrg> @Robb4DC Also a fantastic t-shirt!
1327791820596674560 2020-11-15 09:53:33 +0800 <katenrg> Some really important and far-ranging ideas in here--among them a small thought I have about actually including @CommerceGov (econ development! NOAA! Trade!) as a key agency in our move to carbon neutrality.
1327783243215556608 2020-11-15 09:19:28 +0800 <katenrg> @aekbarnes Amen sister.
1327496708951982080 2020-11-14 14:20:53 +0800 <katenrg> @mateosfo That is one beautiful sourdough loaf!!
1327496560893067264 2020-11-14 14:20:18 +0800 <katenrg> .@WadeCrowfoot I see an art project in our future.
1327439799137890305 2020-11-14 10:34:45 +0800 <katenrg> @sigpeterson I dunno, I think you have some Trine Dyrholm going on too. Maybe Lena Olin? You just have to look at those Scandanavian actors.
1327082033860939777 2020-11-13 10:53:07 +0800 <katenrg> @Emdashes @DarcyCarden Totally true. We also occasionally sold our stuffed animals into slavery (aka made them play "pet store" ).
1327038518590246912 2020-11-13 08:00:12 +0800 <katenrg> @KifScheuer @BethBashert @elamin88 That's sort of the point of Beth -- she's this very closed-off, traumatized person who reaches into herself to excel at chess. But is obviously incredibly flawed.
1327026020835229696 2020-11-13 07:10:32 +0800 <katenrg> @BethBashert @KifScheuer @elamin88 You all must read the book! Walter Tevis, who wrote it, also wrote The Hustler -- remember that movie?
1326995169472696320 2020-11-13 05:07:57 +0800 <katenrg> This was my FAVORITE book growing up; I talk about it all the time and until now, no one had ever heard of it. Great adaptation (though Beth should not be this glamorous).  https://t.co/WUTy6oY6GH via @elamin88
1326982328384540672 2020-11-13 04:16:55 +0800 <katenrg> @Lenny_Mendonca Wow Lenny, I am very tempted! Hope to see you there!
1326966406944964613 2020-11-13 03:13:39 +0800 <katenrg> AND...could not have happened without co-chairs @TomSteyer @MikeBloomberg and Hank Paulson, all of whom have continued the work far beyond the initial project!
1326965042835673088 2020-11-13 03:08:14 +0800 <katenrg> @mateosfo I feel like I get this email at least once a week.
1326950024161288192 2020-11-13 02:08:33 +0800 <katenrg> @dfirgs @CommerceGov @eroston People don't think about it but it's really critical: NOAA, NIST, EDA, BEA...all foundational departments for a carbon neutral transition.
1326947874584858629 2020-11-13 02:00:01 +0800 <katenrg> Many ideas here for a more climate-conscious Biden-Harris administration--including my own obsession with turning @CommerceGov into a front-line just transition/climate risk management shop! Thanks @eroston for the platform!
1326939024687210496 2020-11-13 01:24:51 +0800 <katenrg> So gratifying to see that the tree we planted with @climaterisk is bearing so much fruit: the Fed, @blackrock, the UK, so many others recognizing that climate risk is investment risk.
1326938584352321536 2020-11-13 01:23:06 +0800 <katenrg> Join me on Nov 19 2:45-3:45 PT at #CoMotionLALIVE to talk about A New Deal for Mobility w/@rmchase @TravisJAllan @GregorMacdonald and Richard Bruce!  https://t.co/Ckn2PEqMwa
1326254202427858945 2020-11-11 04:03:37 +0800 <katenrg> Adaptation and resilience are top of mind not only for Californians but for all global citizens. @Cal_OPR 's Adaptation Clearinghouse should be your first stop to understand how CA communities are leading here as in so many other climate actions.
1325950575909826561 2020-11-10 07:57:06 +0800 <katenrg> Everyone's talking about housing in the WUI. Here's your chance to weigh in.
1325906453807292416 2020-11-10 05:01:47 +0800 <katenrg> CA is paying attention to this!
1325902342881857536 2020-11-10 04:45:27 +0800 <katenrg> @samjmintz @narprail We need both! HSR connected to regional rail, similar to how it's done in Europe.
1325223125856911360 2020-11-08 07:46:29 +0800 <katenrg> @sigpeterson I see you come by your love of bourbon honestly...
1325150210708787200 2020-11-08 02:56:44 +0800 <katenrg> CONGRATULATIONS @KamalaHarris -- first woman VEEP and proud Oaklander. Could not be more proud!!   https://t.co/tlsfORKOgD
1324434319289405440 2020-11-06 03:32:03 +0800 <katenrg> Congrats! So proud to have you representing me in the state legislature!
1324422043899551744 2020-11-06 02:43:16 +0800 <katenrg> @jgkoomey Jonathan, I worked w/the folks at @ColumbiaUEnergy on a report on the econ impact of fossil fuel volatility on local tax bases, jobs, etc that might be useful:  https://t.co/r0GmMdTlZQ
1324227892755136513 2020-11-05 13:51:47 +0800 <katenrg> This is what patriotism looks like.
1324218793988554752 2020-11-05 13:15:37 +0800 <katenrg> @jzimbabwe I think I need to boil then fully dry so I don't get steam causing popping internally. Next year!
1324165517939073024 2020-11-05 09:43:55 +0800 <katenrg> @leahstokes Love the list but can't get excited about bankruptcies. Those are wells that might not get capped, brownfields that might not get cleaned up, and--most important--workers that will certainly get laid off.
1324088651026821120 2020-11-05 04:38:29 +0800 <katenrg> As of midnight, the U.S. became the ONLY country to leave the global climate pact known as the Paris Agreement. Carbon pollution knows no geographic boundaries; this is a global crisis that demands a global solution. CA &amp; @USClimate will keep leading but we can't do it alone!  https://t.co/Iy7R8idW34
1323884058556862466 2020-11-04 15:05:30 +0800 <katenrg> In actual positive election news, my badass sister-in-law (and fellow @EmergeCA grad) won a seat on the Menlo Park school board!
1323883473208139778 2020-11-04 15:03:11 +0800 <katenrg> I just can't get my head around this. Addressing the pandemic IS "hustling to rebuild the economy." Doesn't the re-closing of places that opened up too early prove that point? #headscratcher  https://t.co/hhCWX8jqjV
1323876820035399680 2020-11-04 14:36:44 +0800 <katenrg> @francesca_segre @goMPCSD Congratulations sister-in-law!!!
1323810404389154818 2020-11-04 10:12:50 +0800 <katenrg> @Guay_JG I know!! I was just sitting here having the same reaction.
1323759230206111745 2020-11-04 06:49:29 +0800 <katenrg> I have been reading this on and off throughout the day...highly recommend! Freaking Out? Here Are 5 Ways to Ward Off Election Anxiety  https://t.co/O0fSju1mTL
1323755497376288771 2020-11-04 06:34:39 +0800 <katenrg> Something to think about tomorrow that's NOT the election results: this truly important conversation w key state agencies on issues central to our #climate goals. Tune in!
1323752960011038721 2020-11-04 06:24:34 +0800 <katenrg> Probably the truest thing I've read today.
1323752746676183040 2020-11-04 06:23:43 +0800 <katenrg> @binajv @MSNBC SO true. That's why they pay you the big bucks Bina!
1323703290874396672 2020-11-04 03:07:12 +0800 <katenrg> @jzimbabwe Do you boil yours before baking them? Some people swear by it. I tried and then they all exploded in the oven.
1323702930042580993 2020-11-04 03:05:46 +0800 <katenrg> Amen brother. Let's make this one a priority.
1323407193522143233 2020-11-03 07:30:37 +0800 <katenrg> If you haven't already done so, please get out and vote!
1323406784535486469 2020-11-03 07:28:59 +0800 <katenrg> @taykuy Shaved meat sandwich right?
1322669089010020352 2020-11-01 06:37:39 +0800 <katenrg> These are kind of amazing -- even if you're not a planner/map nerd like me.
1322639572925259776 2020-11-01 04:40:22 +0800 <katenrg> @Guay_JG Huge fan of the blackrock move. From a private sector perspective this is huge - having ripple effects already across corporations and asset owners everywhere - including the state of CA which is now looking at disclosure.
1322203255351382016 2020-10-30 23:46:36 +0800 <katenrg> Women are 2x more likely than men to lose their jobs in the COVID economy -- one many economists are calling a "she-cession".   I don't think this made any of them feel better.    https://t.co/A8NDWZugEa via @usatoday

1321826052071514114 2020-10-29 22:47:43 +0800 <katenrg> @noahqk Oh man. I was there for most of it (at @amprog at the time). But I've never seen the post-game analysis anywhere. I am more than happy give you an oral history though!
1321825664215912448 2020-10-29 22:46:11 +0800 <katenrg> @jzimbabwe Job, beach, wine - sounds like of like my life already actually.

1321206373053390849 2020-10-28 05:45:20 +0800 <katenrg> Said it before and will say it again: infill housing is one of CA's most important #climate strategies.

1318942988991483904 2020-10-21 23:51:28 +0800 <katenrg> @CarbonWrangler @amrogan @viendetta @NidhiJThakar You wrote the book my friend.
1318942786482171904 2020-10-21 23:50:39 +0800 <katenrg> Ain't no carbon neutral future without aggressive carbon mitigation AND aggressive carbon removal. Looking forward to this discussion with some of the best in the field!
1318617447314845696 2020-10-21 02:17:52 +0800 <katenrg> Fantastic initiative - and about time!
1318417671445082112 2020-10-20 13:04:02 +0800 <katenrg> Want to know how high-road job creation and equity can be a cornerstone of a carbon neutral clean energy transition? Don’t miss this great event on October 23 w/ me, @viendetta @NidhiJThakar #CleanEnergyforBiden #Justtransition #BidenHarris2020  https://t.co/UF1eXH6XqS
1317529719076630530 2020-10-18 02:15:38 +0800 <katenrg> Want a great example of ZEV infrastructure at scale? Look no further. @CaHSRA is a core part of CA's carbon neutral future.
1317516700309319680 2020-10-18 01:23:54 +0800 <katenrg> Another reminder (as if we needed one) to incorporate disaster planning including @climaterisk into all major infrastructure and planning decisions.
1317268543155499011 2020-10-17 08:57:49 +0800 <katenrg> Thinking about &amp; mourning Cecil took me back in time to the Newark's Green Future initiative--planting some of the seeds for the Green New Deal among other milestones.  https://t.co/Bb3zkPjr7p @AimeeGlobal @CoryBooker @PhilAngelides
1317267308809572352 2020-10-17 08:52:54 +0800 <katenrg> So incredibly sad to hear about Cecil's death; we worked together when I was at the Apollo Alliance and I was in awe of his poise, savvy, and unshakable commitment to justice. He will be enormously missed.
1317225583034593280 2020-10-17 06:07:06 +0800 <katenrg> Just, simply, the right thing to do.
1316971287277862912 2020-10-16 13:16:37 +0800 <katenrg> Another important piece to add to CA's new climate investment framework--@cdiac_sto report on #climaterisk disclosure in the bond markets. The more we (and the markets) know, the better (more sustainable, more resilient) decisions we'll make.
1315890851105497088 2020-10-13 13:43:21 +0800 <katenrg> Scratch that and rewrite as: a key climate strategy for anywhere that has any population growth, full stop. Land use policy = housing and transportation policy = climate policy = equity policy.
1315886501922701312 2020-10-13 13:26:04 +0800 <katenrg> @panamaredhat Agree 100%, we need a systems approach to housing, transportation, econ development that recognizes the underlying risks and opportunities of climate change. Hence...my job.
1315767439657820160 2020-10-13 05:32:58 +0800 <katenrg> Proud to be part of a government that recognizes we occupy, we don't own. Find out whose native lands you occupy here:  https://t.co/WWcIcy3i0x. I'm on Ohlone land at home, Nisenen land at work.
1315764588382547968 2020-10-13 05:21:38 +0800 <katenrg> @panamaredhat Agree these need to be reconciled, esp at the local level -- there are hundreds of sites across every county of CA that are low-VMT and perfect for infill/compact development. We need local govt to prioritize building on them.
1315680664692289538 2020-10-12 23:48:09 +0800 <katenrg> California is actually doing many of these things but I'm particularly happy Politico recognized that reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) must be a key climate strategy for anywhere that's urbanized or urbanizing!
1315076560437747713 2020-10-11 07:47:39 +0800 <katenrg> Reading the Game of Thrones series and I have to say it puts things in perspective. 2020 could have been SO much worse.
1314024975066570752 2020-10-08 10:09:02 +0800 <katenrg> Can't help myself, have to weigh in. This is like a master class in mansplaining. #VPDebate
1314024739183030273 2020-10-08 10:08:05 +0800 <katenrg> @Ce4biden_CA @KamalaHarris @JonDC51 @ce4biden @Negawatt_Nate So proud to participate! Thank you!
1313721379527688192 2020-10-07 14:02:39 +0800 <katenrg> NOT in my official capacity but YES please join us!
1313721271222366208 2020-10-07 14:02:13 +0800 <katenrg> @Negawatt_Nate @Ce4biden_CA Such kind words! Thank you!! Yes please join us -- we are getting down to the wire.
1312104365277110273 2020-10-03 02:57:13 +0800 <katenrg> Me too! Such a huge honor to be sharing the stage with one of my personal heroes @MichaelDTubbs.
1312038385247109120 2020-10-02 22:35:02 +0800 <katenrg> @KHayhoe @LouiseBedsworth you need to join this!
1311137030450024449 2020-09-30 10:53:22 +0800 <katenrg> @JosephMajkut Ok but it's not an answer on wildfires. Truth is most of CA forests are federally managed.
1309236330786729984 2020-09-25 05:00:40 +0800 <katenrg> Agriculture. Transportation. Energy. Water. Just a few of the areas where climate risk = infrastructure &amp; investment risk. Proud that CA is taking the first steps toward climate risk disclosure across investments &amp; assets!  https://t.co/Cc1qey1RbJ  https://t.co/E36FWcvGf9
1309224922409959425 2020-09-25 04:15:20 +0800 <katenrg> California can't afford to continue spending billions on climate-related disasters. Climate risk=financial risk for our governments and communities. Proud to be taking the 1st steps toward accountability and disclosure of our #climaterisk.  https://t.co/nTNWWKtur7 #CAClimateAction
1309202867333419009 2020-09-25 02:47:42 +0800 <katenrg> Up in 3 minutes: our panel on incorporating information on climate risks and opportunities into our financial decisionmaking -- including for our state and pension funds. Join me and James Manyika @DMankikar @Blitterman for a great discussion!
1309132513013624833 2020-09-24 22:08:08 +0800 <katenrg> Today is California Climate Action Day! Tune in for a series of conversations and panels featuring @CAgovernor @GavinNewsom, @VanJones68 @WadeCrowfoot &amp; many more from (including me!) 9-2PM PDT. #CAClimateAction  https://t.co/FaEoNJKjk0
1308535040381394946 2020-09-23 06:33:59 +0800 <katenrg> @JoshuaBaum93 Next time get me with eyes open! ;-)
1308080742132379654 2020-09-22 00:28:46 +0800 <katenrg> As I note here, it's CRITICAL to connect our land use policies to climate resilience &amp; our long-term climate goals. Infill housing + protection of natural &amp; working lands is a climate strategy--and more sustainable, resilient, &amp; equitable to boot.   https://t.co/KPbj9esC5G
1307194074475016192 2020-09-19 13:45:28 +0800 <katenrg> There it is, our rallying cry. Take a minute -- an hour -- the time you need to grieve, then pick up and get back to work. Let's make RBG proud.
1304509495624818688 2020-09-12 03:57:55 +0800 <katenrg> @mateosfo @bobkopp Yes this was due in no small part to leadership from Bob Litterman who as you may remember was one of our #climaterisk advisors.
1303029817101623298 2020-09-08 01:58:12 +0800 <katenrg> Creating jobs, connecting Californians, challenging #climatechange. @CaHSRA moves forward on all three fronts this #LaborDay.
1302732252942532608 2020-09-07 06:15:47 +0800 <katenrg> Californians: turn off those appliances! Time to save some energy and support those who truly need it during this heat wave -- and practice your #demandresponse skills for the frequent climate-driven heat waves to come. #KeepConservingCA
1302708702953127938 2020-09-07 04:42:12 +0800 <katenrg> @RuthReads @TheEnergyGang @mclott @JigarShahDC Sure always happy to talk about #demandresponse. Critical long-term approach; can't just be a once in a while option.
1302673958022467584 2020-09-07 02:24:08 +0800 <katenrg> Ever found yourself wondering what you personally can do to make California more resilient? Here's your chance! Today &amp; tomorrow from 3-9pm are CRITICAL hours to take action to conserve energy, support the overloaded grid, and stand up to #climatechange. #Californiaforall!
1302339376517505024 2020-09-06 04:14:38 +0800 <katenrg> Time to step up again and practice those #demandresponse skills! Your neighbors, communities, and all Californians are depending on you to keep the state safe and resilient. #CaliforniaForAll!
1300601695236313088 2020-09-01 09:09:42 +0800 <katenrg> Turns out that with housing policy, it's 10% passage, 90% implementation. At @Cal_OPR we're here to support you in that implementation phase, especially when it comes to your general plan. Join us tomorrow!
