Your 'achievement' is some rolled-over trade deals on the same or worse terms than we had in the EU and a deal with the EU which covers goods not services. They mainly export goods to the UK, we mainly export services to them. See the problem?

As for the vulnerable, no vaccine is 100% effective – they rely on a response from the host and the elderly have weaker immune responses, so are the ones where it's least likely to work. Vaccinating everyone is best.
1343816219690938369 2020-12-29 15:08:48 +0800 <CBtn13> @rockyrocky7 @QuislingT EU law allowed countries to require new arrivals to already have a job or find one within three months or have the means to support themselves. If they fail to meet those requirements, they can be sent back. The UK chose not to enforce those provisions.
1343815574506201089 2020-12-29 15:06:14 +0800 <CBtn13> @PhilNice2 @QuislingT So it's wrong to let people from Poland in  (despite Poland being bound by the same EU laws) but OK to let people from India in (where employment standards are minimal and frequently disregarded)?

1343608274692825088 2020-12-29 01:22:30 +0800 <CBtn13> @JohnWest_JAWS 1] Iran doesn't recognise dual nationality, so if she failed to renounce her Iranian nationality, she's an Iranian citizen in Iran. 2] Even with recognised dual nationality, one country has no right to interfere if you're in the other country that you're a national of.

French is the main language taught in UK schools, but most have only a poor knowledge of it. German would be the obvious other choice.

So far, the only deals the UK has is countries offering to roll over the conditions we had as EU members, but some have only offered that for a limited period.

The ones that succeed generally make a virus more infectious but often less deadly, though that's not always the case. Less deadly because it gives the virus more chance of spreading.

Boudica killed and tortured many Romans and Britons before committing suicide. I doubt @trussliz is flattered by either comparison.

Leave was the 'la la land' option, as it could mean anything you wanted it to – single market, customs union, meagre economy-damaging deal, full-on economic no-deal collapse. That ambiguity was deliberately encouraged too.

Some have a weak immune system (e.g. the elderly and some with chronic immune conditions). That's why effectiveness is never 100%. It's not the fault of the vaccine.
1339465466046259200 2020-12-17 15:00:27 +0800 <CBtn13> @WIOFY @Fox_Claire That was four years ago. There's no majority now after we've seen that 'keeping all the benefits' is not possible. it's not 'the easiest deal in history' and there's no £350m a week for the NHS.

1337360322873667588 2020-12-11 19:35:22 +0800 <CBtn13> @JGForsyth Standards will diverge over time and the EU wants a watertight agreement that doesn't need to be renegotiated every few years. It would have helped if the UK government hadn't shown that it couldn't be trusted.

It counts a local hairdresser with four employees as one business and likewise BP, which employs thousands. Exports account for around 30% of the UK's GDP and almost half of those go to the EU.

Unlike the pourable version they produce for export, it's thick and gloopy and used as a topping for deserts – traditionally on pancakes, but it's great on vanilla ice cream or sliced bananas.

I lived in a coastal city where there were about a dozen boats for a population of almost 300K. They mainly catered to local upmarket restaurants.

1332414298623242242 2020-11-28 04:01:38 +0800 <CBtn13> @Zeheart_Aznable @LozzaFox The example is the government's powers in an emergency. Given that nearly 70% of the UK population were wearing masks in indoor spaces before it became obligatory, they have public backing.

In World War Two, people were called up into the military, others had to perform fire duties, the government imposed rationing and told parents to send their children away from the cities, blackouts were obligatory, etc. The government has full powers in emergencies.

1332403874125271041 2020-11-28 03:20:13 +0800 <CBtn13> @Zeheart_Aznable @LozzaFox Because there's also a legal obligation to wear a mask in shops, hence the police being in an impossible situation. They can't force her to prove she's exempt, which means the only way to do it is to refer her to a court. The government is at fault here.
1332402267618766850 2020-11-28 03:13:50 +0800 <CBtn13> @Zeheart_Aznable @LozzaFox The government fails in everything it does – It can't even craft a law with teeth.

1329357635196510209 2020-11-19 17:35:33 +0800 <CBtn13> @WeNeedEU @barry_halverson Another idea would be the Swiss system of frequent referendums. By giving people choices over individual policies, voters become more engaged, i.e. believe they can make a difference.

1328974227152773122 2020-11-18 16:12:01 +0800 <CBtn13> @DrVxD @barry_halverson Firstly, a majority of pupils now take 'A' levels and over 40% go to university and secondly, many people take additional qualifications after leaving full-time education (evening classes, online courses, etc.).

They rely on your immune system to make antibodies and some, like the elderly and those with immune conditions, don't do that effectively. That's why the new vaccine claims to be 90% effective, which is better than many.

1326466723554480129 2020-11-11 18:08:06 +0800 <CBtn13> @cool_grandad No, but once the vaccine is available to all, those who have not been vaccinated should not be permitted to fly, enter a workplace, school, shop or any other enclosed public area.

Who exactly are 'our lot'? There have been no pro-EU demos during the pandemic as far as I'm aware. Several far-right ones though.

1313395043034640385 2020-10-06 16:25:54 +0800 <CBtn13> @super_buff @JoelBaccas Elderly people were discharged from hospital back to care homes at the height of the pandemic without being tested for Covid, taking the disease with them to infect those with the least resistance to it. So yes, it was sent there.

If a hospital sent patients to one of them, they also had to supply the staff – docs, nurses, etc., leaving them even shorter staffed. More beds is the easy bit – more staff not so much.

1303589802655322114 2020-09-09 15:03:23 +0800 <CBtn13> @Theopenofmind1 @mrjamesob In broad terms, I agree, but the reality is more nuanced. More accurately, it's harder if you're from a small town or depressed area than if you're from a major city. E.g. Manchester vs Grimsby or London vs Margate.

Certain areas (mainly cities) are quite prosperous, but the former industrial areas aren't. They look better than the UK equivalents because of the investment, but still have economic problems – un- or underemployment.
1303587610452004869 2020-09-09 14:54:40 +0800 <CBtn13> @Theopenofmind1 @mrjamesob Populism finds fertile ground because people can deflect their own failings. A fair proportion are 'left behind' because they chose not to keep up – showed little interest in acquiring education or skills, didn't seek out advancement, weren't prepared to leave a declining area.

1303586344556474368 2020-09-09 14:49:38 +0800 <CBtn13> @Theopenofmind1 @mrjamesob Given that the Tories were in govt and that LAs didn't have the budget, only central govt could have resolved those issues. As you say, populism took full advantage of the dissatisfaction.

There was also the ability to return EU citizens who came without jobs and failed to find work in their first few months in the UK. That was never used.
1303584501919027328 2020-09-09 14:42:19 +0800 <CBtn13> @Theopenofmind1 @mrjamesob The EU did though. Most of the poorest regions in N. Europe are in the UK and those regions received aid. Now they won't. With a Tory govt, what were local Labour and Lib Dems supposed to do? Local authorities have no money for aid projects – their budgets were slashed.

1301068777296142336 2020-09-02 16:05:43 +0800 <CBtn13> @DavidLammy The truth is now whatever the Conservative Party tells us it is. “The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.” – George Orwell.

1300919804820426754 2020-09-02 06:13:46 +0800 <CBtn13> @darrengrimes_ The EC only deters participation by those who do not abide by the law. That's exactly its purpose. You're obviously happy to see the democratic process subverted by any group willing to pay you. That makes you a traitor, Darren.

How will British exporters cover the costs of tariffs and paperwork and remain competitive in the European market? What about re-exports and semi-manufactures? Just-in-time supply chains? We're all ears!
1300785143221805057 2020-09-01 21:18:40 +0800 <CBtn13> @dano1311 @Anna84246988 @chairi06 @mrPbutters @LeaveEUOfficial @DavidGHFrost Yes, the UK has more to lose. The EU accounts for far more of the UK's exports than the other way around. The EU can find substitutes for most of the things it imports from the EU, but that's less the case for the UK.
