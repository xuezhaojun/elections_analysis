1318603513975504897 2020-10-21 01:22:30 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas None of it was shady , campaigns have hundreds of foreign contacts ! The media always plays up what trump does as if it‚Äôs new or special it was all crap meant to cast a cloud over his election. And they knew he wasn‚Äôt no fucking agent in early 2027
1318596285583269888 2020-10-21 00:53:47 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas The media acted shady as fuck never letting people call it out and instead pumping it out ignoring what was wrong with it and lying for years like Adam schiff lies about no fisa problems and that the fbi worked by the book
1318595847941197824 2020-10-21 00:52:03 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas I already said the fbi said it was s phone call that‚Äôs what the papa d was about. He was an intern basically so fbi wants to investigate him ok . But the only link to trump was in the steel papers and cater page which was used in fisa courts and was proven to be shit
1318593642521632768 2020-10-21 00:43:17 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas I‚Äôm aware they say it‚Äôs cause of a phone call but my point is for the fisa it‚Äôs the steel pee pee , the only reason people had to suspect trump himself was cause steel and his take that cater page was a money link between Russia and trump and that was crap and false
1318592619274997760 2020-10-21 00:39:13 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas Did you know fusion gps hired the Russian that met trump jr in trump tower and had a meeting with her before and after the trump tower meeting and goes on to hire steel too working with Hillary
1318590887337873410 2020-10-21 00:32:20 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas They used steel pee pee tape lies to start the investigation and once they knew it was crap kept investigating two year after they knew it was shit, it‚Äôs the fisa abuse for one

1318584937914732552 2020-10-21 00:08:41 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas One million dollar loan from the father from what I recall and he turned that into hundreds of millions til the 80s and 90s where he went into debt then made it out infact the nyts said it was one of the greatest come backs ever but how soon people forget
1318580141610704897 2020-10-20 23:49:38 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas But u know this and act accordingly huh
1318579979312074757 2020-10-20 23:48:59 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas And companies will lose money for years at a time and continue as normal this idea that trump is bad cause he writes loses or had 5 bankruptcies out of 500 businesses when half of all businesses go under is ridiculous propaganda meant to belittle him
1318579318197506048 2020-10-20 23:46:22 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas Yet trump is a billionaire huh and can sell a building and buy whatever he wants ya sounds like a billionaire to me it‚Äôs just simple facts he has a billion in capital well more like 3 bill according to Forbes if I recall
1318576565777825795 2020-10-20 23:35:25 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas And no trump isn‚Äôt worse for one he deported less people than Obama and started no wars while Obama started 7 new ones. He has less troops in the Middle East and would have none in Afghanistan if the democrat house didn‚Äôt fight him in it! Yes the democrat house
1318575587280232448 2020-10-20 23:31:32 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas When did trump use the fbi to frame his opponents ? Please tell me
1318575415871627274 2020-10-20 23:30:51 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas Then u don‚Äôt understand how companies can write off loses its common as hell and lots of companies lose money but anything to make trump look bad huh
1318574873111859200 2020-10-20 23:28:42 +0800 <bill77710> @EvanPoulas And James comey only trashed her cause it leaked he had more of her emails when he said the fbi didn‚Äôt ! It was him covering his ass
