1326419506089107456 2020-11-11 15:00:28 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @RedPill03266961 Paganism is a worthy exploration, however Europeans only ever convened as a monolith after the Council of Clermont. While doubtlessly flawed, the umbrella of Christianity facilitated something beautiful, at least for a time.
1326401614836625411 2020-11-11 13:49:22 +0800 <sir_fulcher> Early hominids practiced ritual burials. It is believed this was due to primitive spirituality. I theorize that this is evolutionarily beneficial. It furthers social cohesion, effectiveness, and collective purpose.  I think we’re built to believe.
1326393888500748292 2020-11-11 13:18:40 +0800 <sir_fulcher> It’s a tragic thing, being faithless. Admiring religion from afar. Believing confidently that it is crucial for society, and yet not believing in the thing that is crucial.
1325158196370092034 2020-11-08 03:28:28 +0800 <sir_fulcher> Censorship and oppression from big tech is tangible and observable, in a way that the activities under the patriot act and power grabs from the state are/were not. Big tech is now on the publics breath, and that is reassuring.  #BigTechCensorship

1320080276605816832 2020-10-25 03:10:38 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @RichardBSpencer This would be really sad. I loved going to the movies growing up. It would be a bit heartbreaking to see movie theaters go the way of blockbuster/movie rentals.
1317580287652626439 2020-10-18 05:36:34 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @DzLoundja @InterestingTim6 @Jasmine23xoxo @PuddyValentine @afneil We’re discussing the problem of violence within Islam, and you pivot to Bush and Tony Blair? As if two wrongs make a ‘who cares’. They’re not comparable anyway.  Muslims are not a minority, they’re not victimized or marginalized. Take off the kid gloves.
1317518269490860035 2020-10-18 01:30:08 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @rose42590078 @InterestingTim6 @Jasmine23xoxo @PuddyValentine @afneil It’s also a cultural thing. What benefit does society our receive from having Muslims in it? Seemingly none. So nah, they can go away. Thanks though. You can go back to camgirling now.
1317186284838936577 2020-10-17 03:30:57 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @InterestingTim6 @Jasmine23xoxo @PuddyValentine @afneil Well the most that are peaceful are useless if folks are still beheading people because of the religion.   There is a serious problem with Islam.
1314639930354786307 2020-10-10 02:52:38 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @markkieling @alexplitsas I am not saying they’re mutually exclusive stances dumbass. I’m responding to the folks who have said “secret service are not the police”. They have badges, guns, and can arrest you.
1313724323572703238 2020-10-07 14:14:21 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @RichardBSpencer Also I don’t see Minnesota going red, even with the riots. And Iowa going blue? There’s a lot fucked up with this map.
1313722514984570887 2020-10-07 14:07:10 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @RichardBSpencer AZ and Ohio going blue? I am highly skeptical.
1313272126619648002 2020-10-06 08:17:29 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @markkieling @alexplitsas Law enforcement is law enforcement, genius.
1313067472057249793 2020-10-05 18:44:15 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @SpeakUpChangeUp Polygraph testing is unreliable and inadmissible in court.
1312142073596837888 2020-10-03 05:27:03 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury In general I agree, a small to mid-size town style of policing is more effective. However I think it’s not realistic for major metro areas. Chances are very high that an officer and suspect could be from the same city and still never have encountered one another.
1312130051207393281 2020-10-03 04:39:17 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury Personally if I were a city administrator, I would want the best candidates possible. If they want to live in a smaller town or rural area, so be it. As long as they’re quality. Residence doesn’t really tell me much about an applicant.
1312127255003365377 2020-10-03 04:28:10 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury Not to mention that chances are good that all of the officers involved with the George Floyd case are from Minneapolis. I haven’t fact checked that, but I’m confident in that guess.
1312126605553094657 2020-10-03 04:25:35 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury The problem comes when you add to many layers. If you only hire officers who are residents of the city in question, you won’t always get the highest quality candidates, and not enough numbers to meet the needs of public safety. That was the point of my initial response to you.
1312124541041176576 2020-10-03 04:17:23 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury In St. Louis, officers with the metro PD must reside within the city. They can’t come into the city for work, then go home to a town outside the city limits. That is as far as it should go IMO. And it should be up to the city to determine if they want to do it, not nationally.
1312076192195977222 2020-10-03 01:05:16 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts If I didn’t have thick skin, I wouldn’t be on Twitter.
1312075396993736705 2020-10-03 01:02:06 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury We have already local control at the municipal level. Some depts have a residence requirement, some don’t.   In a major metropolitan area like Minneapolis, if we divide neighborhood by neighborhood, you are going to see a lot of what is effectively racially defined police forces.
1312072907451924481 2020-10-03 00:52:12 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury ‘From’ then. It’s the same. Most neighborhoods are not integrated. Again, by and large, whites live with whites, blacks with blacks, etc.  I actually agree that everyone would likely be happier under this system of policing. A lot less tension.
1312068836993257474 2020-10-03 00:36:02 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @Joseph2poms @wmsts @GlennLoury He would of course say no. If you forced him into a corner he basically wants special treatment for ghettos, and police officers who are passive with the criminals in the black community.
1312067891324481538 2020-10-03 00:32:16 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @Demosthenes9 @GlennLoury Sourcing police officers only from specific neighborhoods they grew up in so that the community feels safer means, by and large, blacks policing blacks and whites policing whites. Simple, end of statement.
1311750168874713089 2020-10-02 03:29:46 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @GlennLoury You understand that you’re effectively calling for segregated policing? Regardless if it’s within the SAME city, you want the specific population being policed to look like they do, specifically along racial lines.  I have no problem with it really, but just be honest about it.
1311721696269946882 2020-10-02 01:36:37 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @GlennLoury It’s not feasible in order to get the staffing and qualifications for a police dept.  You can either have well-trained officers who hold 4 year degrees and are extremely high quality, or you can have people from the neighborhood. You simply can’t always have both.
1311717488544145408 2020-10-02 01:19:54 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @zkandck @GlennLoury De-escalation is fine only after hands are visible. There won’t and never will be soothing calm tones while someone is digging around in the dark corners of their vehicle. You’re going to get yelled at and have a firearm pointed at you. No “reform” will change that. It just is.
1311716443776524289 2020-10-02 01:15:45 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @wmsts @GlennLoury Any sane individual would have some level of fear working in that environment, Bill.   Your plan is to police the neighborhood only with folks from the neighborhood, huh?  Yeah, good luck with that. It’s a pipe dream.
1311564918647328769 2020-10-01 15:13:38 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @cenkuygur This is cringe as fuck.  I’m an atheist who’s scared of the implications of widespread atheism.  Reality is depressing, and without the warmth of the crutch that is religion, would make for a depressed and unfulfilled populace.  Leave the people be, Cenk.
1309888618509611009 2020-09-27 00:12:37 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @JoeBiden Enough action has been taken, and then some. With the survival rates being what they are, it’s time we stop destroying the economy. We can do this while still being sensible about the safety of the elderly.  Open it up.
1300873869352411142 2020-09-02 03:11:14 +0800 <sir_fulcher> @SteveHofstetter Steve, it was obvious self-defense. You’re a fucking moron. Oh and you suck on PKA every time.
