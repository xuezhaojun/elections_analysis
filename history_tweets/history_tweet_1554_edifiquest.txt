1327683482550603776 2020-11-15 02:43:04 +0800 <edifiquest> @SophiaL81330160 Not sure I can help make sense of it since the UC Regents have allowed Richard Blum to retain his position after breaching policy in aiding unqualified students gain admission. Tax payers need to send @UCPrezDrake a clear message that @UofCalifornia is to serve all Californians.

1327464039157440512 2020-11-14 12:11:04 +0800 <edifiquest> @SKH245 Partly because the #APA communities have not drawn a wide enough, deep enough line in the sand that demarcates self-respect.

1327456511379996673 2020-11-14 11:41:09 +0800 <edifiquest> @CaliConsNews #Prop16 failed to pass because it failed to articulate how discrimination and preferences were going to help children when a significant portion of them are not reading at appropriate levels. CA needs to stop racial politics and hold #CALeg responsible for tax spending.
1327454016721231873 2020-11-14 11:31:15 +0800 <edifiquest> Will the supporters of #Prop16 reflect upon the fact that 57% of Californians voted #NoOnProp16? Or, will they remain convinced that they know better &amp; double down on their efforts to force preferences upon the will of the people who have spoken loudly &amp; clearly at the election?

They outspent us by millions &amp; lined up practically every politican/lobby. Yet, they could not overcome the heart of parents. The fight is not over. We stand with you #LowellHS #TJHS &amp; others.

1323295327462383617 2020-11-03 00:06:06 +0800 <edifiquest> Equality vs. equity is a false &amp; dangerous dichotomy. Equality is activated by liberty to produce equity.

Also, it is laughable when those who do not have any experience or knowledge of oppressive regimes overseas will lecture those who left them about equality.

1322291729148489728 2020-10-31 05:38:09 +0800 <edifiquest> #Prop16 attempts to portray women as requiring preferences to achieve. This is insulting and degrading to all  women. Women deserve equality, not low expectations. #NoOnProp16

If they are true to their word, unqualified ♂️ get in over qualified ♀️. Vote #NoOnProp16.

1322214688508182528 2020-10-31 00:32:01 +0800 <edifiquest> Academia will promote diversity along the lines of race, gender, etc. However, it draws a deep and wide line with respect to diversity of thought. A mind that is not challenged and asked to articulate will never reach its potential.

1315050614984904704 2020-10-11 06:04:33 +0800 <edifiquest> #APA are so privileged in California, especially the males, that there are ZERO APA men as UC Regents. You cannot get any more over representation than zero. Yet, UC Regents support the diversity agenda of #Prop16. #NoOnProp16 #hypocrisy
1315049756356349952 2020-10-11 06:01:09 +0800 <edifiquest> @NewerImmigrant Probably will not matter to #APA male students if the UC Regents composition is any indication. There are ZERO APA male Regents, but at least one rule-breaking, preference-granting to UNQUALIFIED students man. His initials are Richard Blum. #Blumgate #NoOnProp16

1315026748237586432 2020-10-11 04:29:43 +0800 <edifiquest> It is long overdue that we delete "government funds" from our policy lexicon. It always was and always will be taxpayer money. And, taxpayers never authorized the state to practice discrimination or grant preferences. Vote #NoOnProp16 and demand stewardship from leadership.

However, many immigrant parents are busy working long hours and are not familiar with the political system. They trust the schools to teach their children civics. In turn, the children become reliant on the state as their True North.
1313880497609601024 2020-10-08 00:34:56 +0800 <edifiquest> The voices of liberty &amp; justice are clear even at a whisper. They resonate with the mind &amp; the heart without ever  reaching the ears. Block out the ads and take the time to read #Prop16 carefully. It allows for discrimination and preferences. Let your voice be heard: #NoOnProp16.
1313878560268935174 2020-10-08 00:27:14 +0800 <edifiquest> @ycinnewyork @AsianDawn4 Agree. This is a prime example that Americans of Asian ancestry are not considered to be equals. Sadly, it is much of our own making. Too many will settle for crumbs and forget those who sacrificed to make their achievement possible. We need to do better.

That's what the Yes side is implying in their ads.
1312493269826248705 2020-10-04 04:42:35 +0800 <edifiquest> @PBlove2smile The Yes side is trying to link Trump &amp; white supremacists to the No side with their ads. This smacks of desperation.

1311388288846983168 2020-10-01 03:31:47 +0800 <edifiquest> Amen, @LeonydusJohnson. This is why our team is fighting so hard against #Prop16. We seek building the future together through unity, not tearing it apart with petty politics. California, fight discrimination by voting #NoOnProp16.

1311374615181094912 2020-10-01 02:37:27 +0800 <edifiquest> Team #NoOnProp16, come out swinging with your messaging. Figuratively, not literally like #Prop16 supporter @AsmGarcia who wanted to "punch the next Asian person" she saw. No need for violence. Just speak the truth that Prop16 discriminates under the cloak of diversity.
1311373205047656448 2020-10-01 02:31:50 +0800 <edifiquest> It's the wild, wild west at the @UofCalifornia. Regent Richard "No Big Deal" Blum is running amok by giving preferences to unqualified students for admission. Time for the new sheriff @UCPrezDrake to clean up this town and restore the public's confidence. #Blumgate
1311371128355479553 2020-10-01 02:23:35 +0800 <edifiquest> We are so much more than a check box. #Prop16 will have you believe otherwise. Instead of think outside of the box, they want to control your future based on your race/gender. Demand more from our government. Send a loud clear message against discrimination; vote #NoOnPrp16.
1311368823409225728 2020-10-01 02:14:26 +0800 <edifiquest> @gra0930 This goes against the Official Voter Information Guide take on fiscal effects of #Prop16. They said there would be no direct fiscal effects on public entities. This information needs to be included in the debate. Save money by voting #NoOnProp16. Taxpayers are not a blank check.

1311341225543217154 2020-10-01 00:24:46 +0800 <edifiquest> The dangers of identity politics. By basing our decisions on a check box, we miss the richness &amp; value an individual brings to the table or to the room. I read @RichardHanania's profile and thinks he merits consideration on his qualifications, not by his URM status. #NoOnProp16
1311339410676305920 2020-10-01 00:17:33 +0800 <edifiquest> Value clarity &amp; consistency? No cigar from #Prop16. They support diversity as a factor in public employment, education, and contracts w/o details, metrics, endpoints, or costs. FACT: it eliminates protection against discrimination/preferences from the constitution. #NoOnProp16
1311332158640848897 2020-09-30 23:48:44 +0800 <edifiquest> Last day of September. The bell lap will ring soon. Time to put it all on the line until #ElectionDay, Team #NoOnProp16. The other side may outspend us, but they will never show the voters the heart will have. We fight against discrimination AND for civil rights. Go, team!
1311328783643729920 2020-09-30 23:35:19 +0800 <edifiquest> @townerman1 I believe he supports it. The UC Regents have endorsed it as well as much of the UC system. Our tax dollars at work.   https://t.co/IZw0hkaFi8
1311321476998467584 2020-09-30 23:06:17 +0800 <edifiquest> We can never ask perfection from anyone. Yet, those in power need to understand the full ramifications of their actions.

1308533077098946560 2020-09-23 06:26:11 +0800 <edifiquest> Disgusting. This is how the UC spends taxpayer money? Where is the oversight from the Regents? Before endorsing #Prop16, prove you can conduct admissions in a honest and unbiased manner. You can't; that's why we need to vote #NoOnProp16.    https://t.co/P5EYvZkRlI via @WSJ
1308516148405653504 2020-09-23 05:18:55 +0800 <edifiquest> UC Regents, this would not have happened if you had at least one #APA man among the 19 appointed Regents. Okay, I don't know that to be a fact, but it's an election year. The truth takes a hit from time to time.

The Ye$ side will outspend us with 7 figure donations from Netflix CEO @reedhastings' wife &amp; @LAClippers owner @Steven_Ballmer. But, they cannot outwork us.

1307457991101349890 2020-09-20 07:14:11 +0800 <edifiquest> I am "horrified" that UC Regent Sherry Lansing is "horrified" about polls showing that #Prop16 is losing. Get the appointed Regents to reflect the state's demographics first, then you can be "horrified." Until then, #NoOnProp16
1307455053905539072 2020-09-20 07:02:30 +0800 <edifiquest> Since it is the Supreme Court, would Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, or Cindy Birdsong be considered?
1307453997922435073 2020-09-20 06:58:19 +0800 <edifiquest> Asking again of all the #APA students enrolled at UC's and CSU's who support #Prop16, if you agree that public universities should reflect the state's demographics and that #APA's are over represented, are you going to dis-enroll and give your spot to an URM student? #NoOnProp16
1307451476143300608 2020-09-20 06:48:17 +0800 <edifiquest> @JohnSungKim @drclhm I think we need to define affirmative action. Similar to #UBI UBI, it is frequently mentioned with the assumption that we have an unified understanding. After agreeing to a working definition, we can move the conversation forward and find common ground. Until then, #NoOnProp16
1307448147363340288 2020-09-20 06:35:04 +0800 <edifiquest> This is not an endorsement, but I do find her words compelling since they align with #NoOnProp16. Indeed, #LetHerSpeak.
1307446490692907008 2020-09-20 06:28:29 +0800 <edifiquest> Californians, if you believe that government is to protect the liberties of individuals and not advance the agenda of special interests, not discriminate against or grant preferences to specific groups, then voting #NoOnProp16 will send a clear and loud message to #CALeg.
1307435735453069312 2020-09-20 05:45:44 +0800 <edifiquest> Regent Lansing, are you "horrified" that of the 19 appointed UC Regents, 4 are Latino (21%) and only 1 is #APA ( 5%), well below their respective general population contributions of 39% and 15%? Take care of your own (glass) house before commenting on #Prop16. #NoOnProp16

1307188975530987520 2020-09-19 13:25:12 +0800 <edifiquest> A new dimension to #Prop16: cruelty. #NoOnProp16
1307187410862661632 2020-09-19 13:18:59 +0800 <edifiquest> Millionaire donors, entrenched politicians in safe districts, and elitists will go on their merry ways regardless of #Prop16's outcome. For the masses, recently naturalized citizens, and those who cherish equality, the passage of Prop16 would be devastating. #NoOnProp16
1307184829700612096 2020-09-19 13:08:44 +0800 <edifiquest> @townerman1 Then let us take up the challenge and recognize that our fight is for future generations.

The outcome of #Prop16 is an indicator of how we much we value individual liberties and how we view each other. Do we practice the soft bigotry of low expectations? Vote #NoOnProp16 and protect human dignity.
1307177922034192384 2020-09-19 12:41:17 +0800 <edifiquest> @townerman1 The #NoOnProp16 team and the good people of California who believe in equality and civil rights for all.
1307177065771413504 2020-09-19 12:37:53 +0800 <edifiquest> Supporters of #Prop16 will deny they seek quotas. Instead, they want race/gender-based outcomes to be predetermined by government agencies and delegates through the practice of discrimination &amp; preferences. Got it. Not a quota, just a caste system. Feel much better. #NoOnProp16

1306607535487479809 2020-09-17 22:54:46 +0800 <edifiquest> Let us be clear: under #Prop16, "diversity" amounts to government-sanctioned discrimination and preferences. This violates the 14th Amendment and destroys all that attracts immigrants from around the world. #California, continue to be a beacon of #liberty. Vote #NoOnProp16

1306597343165255682 2020-09-17 22:14:16 +0800 <edifiquest> The people of California do not want race-based preferences with regard to college admissions, government employment, and government contract. #CALeg, listen to the people you serve; do the duty you took a oath to do. #NoOnProp16
1306595525458759687 2020-09-17 22:07:03 +0800 <edifiquest> Prop 16 will punish students and workers for things they have no control over: race and gender. It will deny them college admission and employment based on what they can control: hard work, merit, and achievement. This cannot be the law of our state. Vote #NoOnProp16
1306594315414548483 2020-09-17 22:02:14 +0800 <edifiquest> The people of California are speaking the common language of common sense.

1306272212647776257 2020-09-17 00:42:19 +0800 <edifiquest> @SafariSmall @EvinSchwartz Another good point. The question is whether parents are open in allowing viewpoints that differ from theirs in the education of their children.
1306271955692077056 2020-09-17 00:41:18 +0800 <edifiquest> @SafariSmall @EvinSchwartz Absolutely. I realize that home-schooling is not an option for all. We should work together to ensure that every child has access to a learning environment that prioritizes the child.
1306269532126806016 2020-09-17 00:31:40 +0800 <edifiquest> @EvinSchwartz @SafariSmall It is an issue that deserves a great deal of thought. I have a bias since my wife home-schooled our kids, or at least think that homeschooling should be in the conversation. With the shut-down, we are re-examining "business as usual." Nimble and modular may be the next steps.

Return common sense &amp; service to others to the #CALeg by voting in @RosilicieBogh as State Senator in District 23. She understands the fiduciary duty of tax payers money.
