One of the reasons we had no PPE at the dawn of COVID-19, was because we outsourced entirely our supply chain

My church requires social distancing, masks and temperature checks. Plus they recommend if u have high risk factors they will minister to u virtually or home visits. We don’t need Cuomo regulating our first amendment rights.

Flynn was so cooperative at the time, Mueller recommended no prison time. Manafort’s alter ego, Rick Gates flipped early and he had nothing on Trump Russia. This is more rubbish.
1331788968233472000 2020-11-26 10:36:48 +0800 <gmandan007> @BillKristol First, Manafort plead guilty. If he had anything incriminating not gossipy he would’ve told them. Self preservation is paramount to anyone facing prison. Second Gates, his reliable #2 flipped and he had nothing on Russia. It’s more BS from the king of BS.

1326528925019811840 2020-11-11 22:15:16 +0800 <gmandan007> @SykesCharlie When you’re hanging your electoral integrity argument on pundits like John Avlon, you have to laugh at the depth of the corporate media’s depravity.  https://t.co/EBNxahQNux
1326519449005027331 2020-11-11 21:37:36 +0800 <gmandan007> @rickwtyler 37 days before Gore conceded in 2000! It’s day 8. Inspect and review all the paper ballots before impartial parties with full transparency and audit and certify all software used, and if Biden still wins, I’ll accept the result. Too many anomalies for us to move on.

1326401542472208384 2020-11-11 13:49:05 +0800 <gmandan007> @MaggieGrem @WajahatAli Biden hasn’t won anything yet. They are still counting, then canvassing and recounting to go and challenges before the States certify the election in December. That is the electoral process. The news media doesn’t get to declare who’s won.

1324777054559232001 2020-11-07 02:13:57 +0800 <gmandan007> @Lawrence Al Gore didn’t concede for 37 days. There are recounts, legal challenges to a non transparent mail in vote process. If at the end, they can’t prove any vote irregularities then he will accept. Not today. Not yet. Still in the fight got our democracy.

1323989698566651904 2020-11-04 22:05:17 +0800 <gmandan007> @harrylitman Conspiracy of the media to suppress voting with fake polls, aligning itself with one party so openly, permitting the unrestrained use of Mail in ballots with little security of ballots and no provision to count them all in a timely manner. I’d say so.
1323987965941604352 2020-11-04 21:58:24 +0800 <gmandan007> @AJDelgado13 Wrong. Carter and Bush were repudiations. This was a conspiracy of media, tech, and the establishment to ally with Dems, smear the president and wrest control of our nation away from working people. It may have succeeded but it’s a minor set back.

More interested in the politics of elections than policies or governing. That’s why her presidential run fizzled out before even one vote was cast. A candidate from the biggest state should’ve punched a little higher than 10th.

Zero indictments of any US person involved in collusion/conspiracy with Russia. They knew early on there was no crimes committed.

These are grievous mortal sins and before you can receive communion you must have been given absolution, and consciously agree to sin no more.

Did we not learn anything from Vietnam, Afghanistan &amp; Iraq. US force can’t settle centuries old scores w/out major escalations &amp; unconscionable casualties. For what? Some sand in the desert. Stop.

Russia was invading/annexing neighbors, moving militarily into Syria, Iran was a rising power in ME, NK developed nuclear weapons &amp;  China was orchestrating mayhem in the region. Today Russia is checked in Syria, Iran is weak/isolated, NK engaged w/SK in dialogue
1314966629634191362 2020-10-11 00:30:50 +0800 <gmandan007> @KantThink @vermontgmg How did that workout? We were told they would be slaughtered. Instead they’ve had to negotiate and work out issues with their neighbors. America isn’t the worlds policeman. Our soldiers aren’t hired referees. Enough endless wars.

Russia hasn’t invaded and annexed any of its neighbors unlike in the Obama years. Iran is more cornered and isolated then ever. They are weaker economically, militarily and diplomatically.

Art. 2, Sec. 2. Did he stop being POTUS when RBG died? Did the GOP majority end on her death? No. Dems are threatening to destroy the Republic if he follows the Constitution

1308161322861948928 2020-09-22 05:48:58 +0800 <gmandan007> @OrinKerr Section 3 isn’t functional. Keep it at “for all vacancies for whatever reason, the current president can nominate a successor for the remainder of the term with the advice and consent of the senate. The Senate must vote on the nomination within 90 days of nomination.

Absent crazy Nancy going off the deep end and kidnapping senators at gunpoint, she’s just an observer.

She may have privately expressed that hope but the granddaughter decided to make it public. I don’t recall any of the Scalia family coming out with a wish for his succession. Why? Cause it doesn’t matter.

1307491681432940545 2020-09-20 09:28:03 +0800 <gmandan007> @beach_hermit @JeffFlake What rules? Have u read the Constitution aka the Rulebook. Art 2 Sec 2 give POTUS the powers to appoint &amp; the Senate to confirm. Not for 3 yrs but for his term of office. So what will Dems do if he exercises his Con right? They will burn down the Constitution. Dems = Arsonists

The Republican Party’s core values is to preserve a conservative majority on the SCOTUS. It has earned that opportunity now fair and square. Seize the day.
1307450674330972160 2020-09-20 06:45:06 +0800 <gmandan007> @SenatorCollins Your plainly wrong. Read Article 2 Section 2. You can vote no or present on the nomination but the President has the right and duty to nominate and if a majority in the senate gives consent it is done.

He didn’t know how deadly it was at that time and followed the advice of the medical experts. States exacerbated deaths by deciding to move high risk infected patients to facilities with other high risk persons. Duh.
1303802047708508160 2020-09-10 05:06:46 +0800 <gmandan007> @VictoriaECM @MaxNordau @ProjectLincoln Cages or holding pens built and first used by Obama. BLM protesters have done their part in sowing fear of black persons. Trump has tried to heal the divisions thru economic reforms. He hasn’t told militias to hit the streets. Dream on.

Read what hillary abd Obama said about each other in the heat of battle or Harris vs Biden. Now all sing in unison. That’s politics. What’s offensive is the comparison to a parasite.

He commuted Stone because he believes Stone was only prosecuted because he was a friend of the President. He hasn’t pardoned Manafort whose crimes predated his relationship w/the campaign.

The pardon power is designed to right injustice (eg Jack Johnson) or express mercy (eg Alice Johnson).  I find it curious that Obama chose to express his mercy on someone who’s never expressed any repentance over his actions.

1300917541276135425 2020-09-02 06:04:46 +0800 <gmandan007> @VABVOX Collins is a US senator in the great tradition of Margaret Chase Smith. Losing her to a “lapdog pawn” of Chuck Schumer would be a great shame.
1300898115252346880 2020-09-02 04:47:34 +0800 <gmandan007> @back_ttys Journalists coordinating their tweets is suspicious. Journalistic malpractice designed to obfuscate the reality in other parts of their cities.

1300859852844077057 2020-09-02 02:15:32 +0800 <gmandan007> @MattCubstead @SykesCharlie In his defense 1) he said he didn’t cross state lines; 2) the video shows one of his victims had a glock pistol pointing at him and the other tried to take his head off. I’d say he has  pretty good self defense argument.
1300859034925494273 2020-09-02 02:12:17 +0800 <gmandan007> @wolfpackofone92 @SykesCharlie They are so delusional.

1300858336406110208 2020-09-02 02:09:30 +0800 <gmandan007> @KevinDoyle4 @SykesCharlie U mean buried in the basement in cold storage until 11/3. Sorry that won’t work.
1300857984466198536 2020-09-02 02:08:06 +0800 <gmandan007> @PeterMDavies80 @mallen2010 @SykesCharlie Two comments: 1/ I’ll let the law determine whether the cops acted within the scope of their authority (stop resisting lawful arrest and these things won’t happen); 2/ no one has a right to break the law in defense of their first amendment right to protest. Good day.

1300787391205122062 2020-09-01 21:27:36 +0800 <gmandan007> @TheMidd58152720 @SykesCharlie Same when it comes to police violence. The toxicology reports on George Floyd, hidden until now to feed a narrative, show he was strung out on a lethal dose of fentanyl &amp; meth during his police encounter which was the direct and proximate cause of his death.
1300785561473617925 2020-09-01 21:20:19 +0800 <gmandan007> @PeterMDavies80 @mallen2010 @SykesCharlie The violence in the city was all manufactured by the democrats. It’s a democrat run city.
1300779830041104384 2020-09-01 20:57:33 +0800 <gmandan007> @SykesCharlie If only you dealt in facts Charlie, instead of fantasy. The NYT already established that he was shot at before he fired back.
