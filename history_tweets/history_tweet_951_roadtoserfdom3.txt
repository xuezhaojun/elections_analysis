That is why it will work. I do not think this strategy is viable in cities for a variety of reasons but, 15000+ towns will be enough.

Broadcast would certainly help but, I think seeing it on a tree on your street will be more impactful than hearing it from a talking head on a radio. Also, it's a local action so it has be locals.

Since consent is the only justification for government in all philosophies which assert its necessity, it would be removing the only card it actually has to play and become an overtly conquering army which actually couldn't succeed.

If they use weapons of mass destruction against a whole population in open but orderly revolt simply out of spite, it would be a huge mistake. Firstly, it wouldn't work and second, if it would do that it would simply confirm the necessity of its removal.

If it's done by most towns and we remove all sitting officials and employees from counties and states, we then face a mostly impotent federal government w/o consent. They really can't nuke everyone.

1342648973249667073 2020-12-26 09:50:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rangermonk1 My first thought was state terrorism. As a means to keep people afraid, to maintain chaos and prevent stability. It's exactly the kind of thing government does.

They both believe that the state is a victim and not an assailant. It's not a reasonable conclusion, sshould be easy to dispel by identifying corporativism as the system.

1342633703407820800 2020-12-26 08:49:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If we remove those voices from the discussion as a whole, I'm not seeing tremendous support for what is happening. Tuning them out, blocking, muting, or ignoring them can have no negative effect on information discovery since they introduce no additional information or analysis.
1342631452270333952 2020-12-26 08:40:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> To reiterate an observation I've alluded to previously, it seems to me that anyone vehemently supporting the narrative is most likely employed by the state. Even the most ardent leftist or rightist should be at least a little confused by the rhetoric and behavior of "their team."
1342612887966277632 2020-12-26 07:27:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It is clearly the case that what governments, corporations, NGOs, non-profits, etc. say they will or won't do is the opposite of what they will or won't do. I don't think anyone really disputes this so why is anyone listening to what they say as if they are not blatant lies?

If they fail to perform, they're replaced.

1342306381618171911 2020-12-25 11:09:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Ronin72 Point is even that limited definition appears close to being satisfied. Economically speaking, command economy is the prerequisite for totalitarianism, if the state dictates what you can and can't buy. Planned economies necessarily can't allow free movement either, we have both.

The use of "anarchy" in the context of government is confusing though. I think chaoto-tyranny would be more apt but, it clearly doesn't roll of the tongue as readily. State terrorism is another option.👍

In reality, people using that term that way are typically biological interventionists which is the eugenic solution to natural selection.

1342293989605707777 2020-12-25 10:20:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wobblyeyez1 You see elements of this in average people who believe, for example, that children would build nuclear weapons in their basement and destroy the planet if innovative and creative tendencies were not crushed at an early age and their spirits held down by relentless indoctrination.
1342293346245611536 2020-12-25 10:17:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wobblyeyez1 In the mind of the totalitarian, to allow human beings to be free is the most reckless and dangerously irresponsible course of action. They believe all action must be prescribed and unanticipated developments must be prevented from occurring at all costs. To do otherwise is mad.
1342292702549975041 2020-12-25 10:14:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wobblyeyez1 I think it's important to understand the mind of your enemy. Perhaps some of them are satanists and there may well be an occult aspect to the psyche of many of their ranks. But my impression is that they simply believe in pure clinical analyses and are afraid of unplanned action.
1342290657705140224 2020-12-25 10:06:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wobblyeyez1 I think I understand what their outlook is from extensive descriptions of their philosophy and belief system. My impression is that eugenicists don't believe there are any moral constraints, only practical ones. Combined with knowledge of their goals, their plan is deducible.
1342289418590281729 2020-12-25 10:01:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @frankemsley I'd like you to suspend ignorance long enough to learn about what the actual situation is. You can forget it all afterwards and go back to denial but, I think you should try it. The risk is that you won't be able to forget.
1342287030760452096 2020-12-25 09:52:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wobblyeyez1 I reasoned it out from the perspective of eugenicists and the complete extinction of the human race is within accepted parameters at this point due to viability of mature artificial birth/IVF techniques. Not sure that's the goal but, it would be an acceptable outcome for them.

It is, after all, literally even more than decimating humanity.

1342264149951340544 2020-12-25 08:21:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MonsterGooder I have to ask, are you paying attention or is this just a knee-jerk reaction? Your statements led me to believe that you are mostly unaware of the nature of the situation.
1342263751362433028 2020-12-25 08:19:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @darelljackson0 First of all, this worldwide. But, if you want to talk about the US, all of this has happened under Trump. Either he couldn't do anything about it or he was complicit. I can't think of a line of reasoning that evades these basic conclusions.
1342263171063701506 2020-12-25 08:17:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MonsterGooder Ok, sounded like you were saying that.

1342262110626197505 2020-12-25 08:13:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MonsterGooder Lots of people are completely unaware, don't feel bad.
1342261811916251137 2020-12-25 08:12:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MonsterGooder I won't contest that characterization.
1342261340816232451 2020-12-25 08:10:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MonsterGooder The primary indicator is command economy and the entire world was converted to that in April. Most people just haven't processed the significance. Other symptoms will manifest.

1342258416702656517 2020-12-25 07:58:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NicRodriguez70 @EraseState Rights are inherent, they are not determined by government. You are referring to restrictions, edicts, and compelled behavior.
1342258130063929345 2020-12-25 07:57:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @annceline If you can get past idea that education needs to be collectivized, "school" becomes a beneficial rather than a detrimental factor for society. SMRs are becoming a possibility even with terrible government hinderances preventing their development and adoption, cost coming down.
1342255153550938117 2020-12-25 07:45:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NicRodriguez70 All of them.
1342255074656063488 2020-12-25 07:45:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @1CupNoLiberty @mcgoverntm I am getting that impression as well. It's encouraging. 🤞
1342254779616129024 2020-12-25 07:44:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @annceline Actually, yes, most electricity generated is lost in transmission over long cables. Competing local providers is the easiest and best way. Small modular reactors could be had by either a company or, if you wanted to chip in with your neighbors, share one. No government required.
1342253482703728641 2020-12-25 07:39:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mcgoverntm @1CupNoLiberty It's been a major hurdle for a long time but, I actually think they can;t avoid seeing it now. Still, not everyone and not all at once unfortunately. Not without some assistance.
1342252270952603648 2020-12-25 07:34:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AbolishLaborNow Sounds like a plan.
1342251349883441155 2020-12-25 07:30:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @annceline No, if I want a septic system, I buy one. What provision are you assuming would need to be collectivized?
1342249887447056384 2020-12-25 07:24:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @annceline Not really, market alternatives for everything. As it turns out, government actually controls a limited market for provision of those things. In the real world, we call that a monopoly. Most people consider it a coercive criminal enterprise to use violence to prevent competition.
1342247078404239360 2020-12-25 07:13:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @annceline I should clarify that I'm a decentralist for the reasons you imply. Children need parents to tell them what to do and some adults need other adults to tell them what to do. This handicap may always be present for some so allowing those people to choose that mode is reasonable.
1342245674532921345 2020-12-25 07:08:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @annceline Oh boy. You do realize that none of those things require government, right?  https://t.co/64Hxqjcref

1342238087741636610 2020-12-25 06:37:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RobertOzn1 The "left" and the "right" are both enthusiastically supporting their own imagined variations on the theme. Government is the threat and corporations are simply instruments of the state in corporativism. That's the missing link in people's understanding of the corporate state.
1342237250780868613 2020-12-25 06:34:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @annceline Trump is one of them, not an outlier. It's important that people begin to realize that government is our enemy.
1342236705391325187 2020-12-25 06:32:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RobertOzn1 @kksheld @zev_dr I think this a good place to start from but, it tends to imply that government could work with some tweaks or something. I disagree, government can't work and can only be used for nefarious purposes as with any coercive power.
1342234431860432897 2020-12-25 06:23:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> You are living under a totalitarian dictatorship already. IT IS A FACT
1342233723828383744 2020-12-25 06:20:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FrostieCash You don't think you are currently living under a totalitarian dictatorship?
1342232493311848451 2020-12-25 06:15:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RobertOzn1 I understand, the conclusion awaiting is that the welfare state leads inexorably to totalitarianism just as certainly as the warfare state does. As it happens, we currently have both and are pretty much already totalitarian and are lacking only popular acknowledgement.

1342025202146959360 2020-12-24 16:31:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 Feds though, much like military. I think it would be hard to find a small to mid-sized town staffed by people who are itching to murder all of their neighbor's children. It is actually not that bad yet.

1342023410252214272 2020-12-24 16:24:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB Which is why you don't go onto an aircraft carrier and attempt to remove the captain from the bridge. I think we can agree that is not wise and we can also agree that that scenario is not what mass recall is.
1342022998891573248 2020-12-24 16:23:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Anti_Dystopian 🧐
1342022743412404224 2020-12-24 16:22:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 Which is why mass recall is necessary before it gets to that stage. It's not any harder to do if that starts happening though, it just means we lose more people before we stop it.
1342022345037406208 2020-12-24 16:20:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB Remember that mass recall is a local civil action to remove local officials and employees from their positions peacefully. They are not military personnel and I suspect the military personnel you are describing are not locals to your area. Their families don't live next to you.
1342021362689466369 2020-12-24 16:16:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 I think it's safe to assume that most official denouncements of what is happening are being censored.
1342020952117440512 2020-12-24 16:15:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB One useful thing if you have already established a relationship with a particular media person is that you can gauge general trends by their behavior. A slight reduction in eye-roll factor from them probably represents a significant change in public opinion.
1342019993953837057 2020-12-24 16:11:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 Most major cities have already signed agreements with the UN so they are literally hostile foreign occupied territories already. Fortunately, cities do not count in the grand scheme and will serve as a hinderance to the GTCS in every practical sense.
1342019378347450369 2020-12-24 16:08:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB I think military personnel are actually more likely to appreciate the stakes. They are less able to speak freely so detecting conversions is harder but, they are in many ways the most important people to make aware. Measure them by their silence and, if you're lucky, subtle nods.
1342018681266692096 2020-12-24 16:06:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB I experience that as well but, less so now than 9 months ago and, I suspect, even less so in a few months.
1342018396846747648 2020-12-24 16:04:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 Yes, she actually uses the term "New World Order" to describe her policy.
1342018154172706816 2020-12-24 16:03:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 It's a matter of momentum. When we reach the point that people join the cause of liberty out of fear of peer pressure and not through personal awareness of the facts, it's mostly downhill from there.
1342017571336417282 2020-12-24 16:01:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB Of course the UN is our enemy. They are everybody's enemy. But, they are not yet in your town. As I've said, cities are most likely lost already as they do not still have local staff. They will not be part of mass recall.
1342017004643999744 2020-12-24 15:59:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB Is your entire town paralyzed with fear? Or, as is probably more likely, unaware of the gravity of the situation. If so, isn't it appropriate to make them aware  of the nature of the circumstances?
1342016522341011459 2020-12-24 15:57:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB Do we wait for blue helmets to show up in town if we are already convinced that our own neighbors would murder our children in cold blood just for a paycheck? I'm not sure I understand what the argument for doing that is.
1342016050355974144 2020-12-24 15:55:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB Again, if that is the case, if your actual mayor would order your actual police department, your town staff, etc. to murder your children and they would actually do it, what possible reason could there be not to address the issue?
1342014657792507905 2020-12-24 15:50:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 Time is not on our side.
1342013866016993285 2020-12-24 15:46:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB But they are still staffed by family, friends, and neighbors, albeit traitors. They will not mass murder innocent families in the streets just to keep their jobs. Let them be replaced by mercenary forces and the situation becomes more complicated.
1342013351480729600 2020-12-24 15:44:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AxelSavage4 @IvanaMariaB If government chooses to commit atrocities or use weapons of mass destruction on the general population, then it would merely confirm the necessity of its removal. If it would do that now, we obviously can't allow it to consolidate forces and tighten its stranglehold.
1342012747874238464 2020-12-24 15:42:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 It's already too late by all measurements except reversibility. We either stop it now or it may become irreversible.
1342010756133478400 2020-12-24 15:34:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @AxelSavage4 Stopping this is simple and peaceful, mass recall. Convincing people that it's necessary seems to be the challenge. I think many people think this will blow over without realizing that every moment they tolerate it encourages further abuse.

It actually most likely has made it possible for at-risk people to be infected when they would otherwise not have been or have been infected with the lesser form of the pathogen not likely to produce the syndrome. You are killing people with lockdowns as well.

I recommend picking a topic you're certain about and research opposing data on it. The test is not whether you're convinced otherwise but, whether you can tolerate the information. Note subconscious diversions.

1341880962087608320 2020-12-24 06:58:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HeineRandell Death is the simplest and most thorough method of control. The stated goal of population reduction detailed throughout the various documentation out in the open combined with observations of policies and their measurable outcomes support that conclusion.
1341879998874050568 2020-12-24 06:54:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Coronapandemina @AuditorInvestor @carlbildt @michaeljburry @LukeJohnsonRCP It's been long known that masks don't work against viruses. 70 years of controlled studies in ideal conditions confirm it.

1341871189422190593 2020-12-24 06:19:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Newnameel @checkmatestate The evidence appears to support this conclusion. However, free speech does appear to be the primary enemy of government and the only one which has a hope of informing the public of the government's extensive crimes and sustained abuse and harassment.

The presumption made by those who posit presymptomatic transmission is that everyone has been infected in the last 24 hours. Also, masks do not prevent transmission and universal medical isolation is impossible.
1341848386128007168 2020-12-24 04:49:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AuditorInvestor @carlbildt @michaeljburry @LukeJohnsonRCP Do not promote this untested experimental gene therapy.

Furthermore, it happens during period of production of a viral load sufficient to shed. Individuals do not shed until viral loads are high enough, accompanied by inflammation.
1341840049097363457 2020-12-24 04:16:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SHarp56_ Yes, time to pull their heads out of the trough.
1341839259804811264 2020-12-24 04:13:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SHarp56_ Maybe you do, not me.
1341838970527899648 2020-12-24 04:11:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The governments of the world clearly consider their own populations as a threat sufficient to merit the use of their militaries and police to make war upon.  Simply put, global government is making war on us all. I do not think this is hyperbole.
1341838839321669634 2020-12-24 04:11:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It is apparent to any who logically follow this step-by-step evaluation of government capability and manifest action can only conclude that the human race is currently under attack and every imagined defense against such an attack has been turned around to face us.
1341838649302855681 2020-12-24 04:10:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> 3) Weapons systems ostensibly developed to protect us from enemy governments (those which our governments are now in total cooperation with) are being fielded against native populations as internal security forces with aim of suppressing resistance to these destructive policies.
1341838317009158145 2020-12-24 04:09:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> 2) The ends which they are currently pursuing are producing untold devastation to civilization and severely harming the health, productivity, mental stability, and overall well-being of most people on the planet.
1341838187933691906 2020-12-24 04:08:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Therefore, simple logical deduction presents us with several inescapable conclusions:  1) Governments of the world are united in purpose and fully cooperative toward achieving the ends they are currently pursuing.
1341837992487505922 2020-12-24 04:08:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The likelihood that every government made the same mistakes simultaneously is simply not possible. The failure of every single one to remedy and reverse those deadly policies is similarly unbelievable. If they were operating independently, none of this could have come to pass.
1341837850296414209 2020-12-24 04:07:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> That the total global cooperation and completely synchronized response is merely spontaneous realization of shared value for human life? It is clear that the policies enacted are a catastrophic mistake. They are causing far more harm than any virus ever could.
1341837673422598145 2020-12-24 04:06:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Is it reasonable to assume that all the enmity and distrust we were led to believe prompted this military expansion simply disappeared overnight? That governments are now singing kumbaya and finally reaching levels of understanding and humanitarian enlightenment instantaneously?
1341837407465955333 2020-12-24 04:05:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> why are they presenting a seemingly unified front of cooperation with one another to supposedly fight what amounts to a bad cold? Why are these systems being deployed in-country and population-facing?
1341837220035092483 2020-12-24 04:04:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We're to believe these armaments and techniques have been developed to protect us from enemy attack. If governments are so threatened by other governments that it's been necessary to pursue the development of all of these offensive and defensive systems,
1341836683340369924 2020-12-24 04:02:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Less-than-lethal and so-called clean killing methods have become the preferred line of development. Emphasis has been on high precision ordinance and crowd control systems. Much effort has also gone into refining psychological warfare and propaganda routines and methodologies.
1341836525315760132 2020-12-24 04:02:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Governments of the world have been arming themselves for years. Vast military capabilities have already been achieved which are more than sufficient to eradicate all life on the planet, albeit in a messy way leaving a harsh and unaccommodating landscape.
1341824183261650944 2020-12-24 03:13:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @The_Evil_Barbie Absolutely, it started almost immediately in April and has not stopped. We are being terrorized.
1341823285437345800 2020-12-24 03:09:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SueC00K @MattHancock In order for a virus to accumulate in the system to levels enabling shedding, the virus must kill cells converting them into manufacturing plants for more virus. This causes inflammation and that is a symptom. Without it, it's basically not possible to shed virus. Simple as that.
1341822746616061952 2020-12-24 03:07:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SueC00K @MattHancock The normal cycle of burnout for viruses, mathematically speaking, is for the pathogen to mutate constantly and more communicable and less deadly variants assume prevalence while more harmful versions fizzle out. Community immunity is acquired via this process. All colds do this.
1341821876696457222 2020-12-24 03:03:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SueC00K @MattHancock Asymptomatic transmission is almost unheard of and even if it occurred occasionally it would not drive pandemic spread. The virus is not really a significant threat to anyone but the at-risk on par with the seasonal flu. Don't believe any government sources. They're simply lying.
1341660718861594629 2020-12-23 16:23:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lamuta27881931 It's a local civil peaceful action, not the familiar pseudo-democratic petition many confuse it with. The challenge is getting people to know that it is an option. In my opinion, after thorough analysis, the only option.   https://t.co/2I6l0V6h3h

It's peaceful and it's the only thing I have not seen any anticipated response to in the documentation. They want violence and chaotic uprisings to justify further restrictions for everyone. People have to know about it.
1341645678523637760 2020-12-23 15:23:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3>  https://t.co/2r4siyaiVn
1341645200666611712 2020-12-23 15:21:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @tesssummers98 Exactly, or a famine or disorganized uprising of violent mobs of looters. That's what they want people to think of any groups who might oppose them. I believe that's why riot conditioning was performed. And now "news" is referring to anti-lockdown protests as "white supremacist."
1341643094090018816 2020-12-23 15:13:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you're still not convinced that this is the object of all the careful preparation, programming, and manipulation, just read through the published materials from the organizations currently in control and what they say they are doing. It's really not hidden between any lines.
1341642187868672001 2020-12-23 15:09:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If they can get you to off yourself in a way that saves them the trouble and makes as little of a mess as possible, they'll subsidize that. They're not quite ready to exercise the final solution completely in the open. Many in their own organizations are unaware of the end goals.

1341640923046940677 2020-12-23 15:04:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We have seen it done overtly and explicitly. An enormous amount of resources has gone into building fantastically deadly military capabilities. Not just in the US but, worldwide. They have not been preparing to fight one another. They have been preparing to exterminate you.
1341640213240659969 2020-12-23 15:02:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Yes, they want to control you but, you're a threat to them. You think you have a right to exist, to go on adventures into the wilderness, drive on roads, eat nice food, etc. These are insults to them, those are their rights not yours. The easiest way to control a person is death.
1341639429673410560 2020-12-23 14:59:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Get a good night's sleep. Enjoy Christmas with your family. Eat well, take care of yourselves. Then remember each day you wake up from now on that government and its vast array of departments, agencies, and corporate instruments are trying to kill you and everything you old dear.

1341507999148466183 2020-12-23 06:16:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @559Chemist Not sure what the arrangements each region will choose. Some will likely maintain local versions of current institutions. They won't all do that though so the nature of their trial will depend where an apprehended suspect physically is. Important that we secure most of the data.
1341507007954767875 2020-12-23 06:12:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @559Chemist Yes, none of the familiar institutions will survive the transition to decentralization. At least not in their centralized architecture or with any of their existing staff.
1341504634167422977 2020-12-23 06:03:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ChoonedM It's probably a controlled opposition operation. I don't have any specific evidence of that exactly other than the obvious statist bias and hostility to all things freedom-adjacent. It's tiny anyway.🤷‍♂️
1341503172372783104 2020-12-23 05:57:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @559Chemist Meaning it's no longer a significant contributing factor. That construct will not survive the transition.

1341489188491976706 2020-12-23 05:02:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DrZoidb59930291 Many are individual but, I suspect most are coordinated, particularly those which are clearly employing the assistance of the state.

Backups should be distributed in a variety of locations, at least some should be hardened.
1341487799313305600 2020-12-23 04:56:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DrZoidb59930291 I say secure all of it. We don't know what the significance of any individual piece of evidence may have when correlated with the accumulated data from all sources in the future. Doesn't makes sense to divulge possession in the current adjudicative landscape unless time critical.

1341477874562457605 2020-12-23 04:17:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> As we see, there's no legislative or adjudicative recourse to tyranny. I think the task of white hat lawyers from here on out is simply to gather and secure evidence. It is fruitless and distractive to attempt legal opposition. Crimes are ignored, justified and used as precedent.

If they do use weapons of mass destruction or commit atrocities, the only justification they have, consent, is no longer valid. If they would mass murder peaceful families, better to know that now than to wait for them to consolidate any further.

I was looking at it from that perspective though, the bureaucratic self-destruction aspect was accurate. Only a government would build plants and experiment so irresponsibly.

1341218857986514944 2020-12-22 11:07:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This is following the British Empire self-occupation model used in India where local bureaucracies were used to contain their own populations. Local mass recall followed by bottom up removal of the enemy army's occupation administration is required.

1341183501928939520 2020-12-22 08:47:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @GatzTravis They are in fact dishing out summary executions already.
1341182056932491267 2020-12-22 08:41:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Holy_Cow_Pod @stuckupstate He's right though, they are pretty much all corporativists. It's critical that people not believe that any part of any government or political organization is on their side. Some of their individual members may be unaware of that fact but, the organizations are compromised.
1341178246818377730 2020-12-22 08:26:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Newnameel Yes, most towns are still staffed by locals who are family, friends, and neighbors. This minimizes the likelihood that they will commit atrocities. Once they are replaced by non-locals and mercenary forces, the situation becomes more dangerous.

Once they are replaced by mercenary forces as has already happened in cities, do you think the situation will improve? We have one chance to resolve this peacefully.

It's the only non-violent solution available. Opposing it is an antagonistic position which supports continuation of the status quo.
1341158192479424517 2020-12-22 07:06:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DracoVonFaust If simply telling people about the only thing that will get us out of this is a problem then you have chosen a side.

It actually isn't as useful as one might imagine to target the 'field officers' of corporativism, they are in a state of flux always anyway. Undermine the organizational strategy of turning our local bureaucracies against us.
1341128188588601346 2020-12-22 05:07:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Try to tell one person a day about mass recall. It might lower the stress a bit to be selective. I'm trying to focus on those who will propagate the idea. The followers will simply follow when the tide turns. Exponential growth looks slow at first. ♟️
1341126022364860421 2020-12-22 04:58:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @aardvarktumult It's frustrating for sure. The followers don't actually use reason which is why it doesn't work on them. However, that makes them simple to convert with peer pressure. Once the tide turns they will go with the tide. Not worth the time so focus on those who can be reasoned with.

So, it's not that every good idea began that way but, that any promising direction is either reigned in or made to serve a state purpose. Subtle but important difference.

It's about persistence, not martyrdom. Spread the word about mass recall as that is the only thing that can actually get us out of this. It can be done anonymously with flyers and posters.

1340709584969887744 2020-12-21 01:24:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DracoVonFaust Baby steps is ok but, not planck steps.
1340709347609997316 2020-12-21 01:23:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DracoVonFaust To speak to the essence of your comments though. I am a decentralist so, technically, I do not have any unrealistic expectations of the complete eradication of all government everywhere forever. I think we probably agree that decentralization is the path toward statelessness.
1340708681684574208 2020-12-21 01:20:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psynthesys1 I generally consider taxation to be theft or, technically, extortion but, other criminal aggressions have as much  of a share in its toolkit. In general, It's not inappropriate to use "taxation" as a catchall.
1340708163088166913 2020-12-21 01:18:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psynthesys1 Simply put, domination. I can't think of a mode of abuse that does not serve that purpose.
1340707772590112769 2020-12-21 01:16:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DracoVonFaust I think you represent a significant portion of the population with that outlook. I submit that it is an unjustified premature capitulation and I intend to do what I can to refute it. There certainly cannot be progress when progress is mocked or even vilified.
1340707330338529280 2020-12-21 01:15:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psynthesys1 As we can already see, taxation isn't the source of income for the state. I don't disagree that it shares a place among the modes of abuse favored by its agents and institutions along with rape, and murder but, it's not actually a limiting factor to its maintenance or growth.
1340706538802077697 2020-12-21 01:12:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ggx7_mane 🤣  https://t.co/fNhsQhtpa8
1340706254222667776 2020-12-21 01:10:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psynthesys1 This is theoretically true but, only in the case of sound money. Taxation is not a significant factor if government can mint its own coin at will. Perhaps that is the first step in the process.
1340705443316949002 2020-12-21 01:07:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DracoVonFaust I disagree. It may be true that success will take time and I surely agree that it will. But, the aim need not be truncated simply because the task is arduous, perhaps even unattainable in our own lifetimes.
1340703783257563140 2020-12-21 01:01:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DracoVonFaust Thanks! Could use some help though. If it isn't a terrible inconvenience, of course. 👍
1340703385754988544 2020-12-21 00:59:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HolyHaole @kateferguson4 Yes prudence dictates preparedness. It's evident that consent of the people is its only justification. If the state makes overt war against the people merely to maintain it's position of dominance and to assure its members continued employment, that single reason is thus removed.
1340701220772655110 2020-12-21 00:50:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I don't care if they offer to hand out blow jobs and  cunnilingus, the state must retreat into the pages of history. There it can serve a purpose as a constant reminder to future humans of what the greatest threat to humanity is. Not people, not even war, but government itself.
1340698599051685891 2020-12-21 00:40:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HolyHaole @kateferguson4 In essence, violence is all that government is. It's the only thing it's good at. Trick is to take away that strength with peaceful town level civil rebellion. However, this doesn't negate the implied threat of retaliation for atrocities it may commit against peaceful citizens.
1340680620809269252 2020-12-20 23:29:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kateferguson4 The only thing that will work is mass recall. Talk to your neighbors, make the fearful understand. Do your best, nothing else will get us out of this.

It can't happen if people don't know about it. Attempts to associate it with any national or global organization are misleading. Discouraging hope is not helpful, make sense?

1340293424478642180 2020-12-19 21:50:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We're in a war. At some point, the momentum will shift from the side of evil to the side of good. When that happens, we should behave in as civilized a manner as is possible despite tremendous temptation for cold retribution. I think discussing handling of prisoners is warranted.

We have time to do so at present but, once we begin to apprehend them less so, and possibly minimal public forums.

1340024209121144836 2020-12-19 04:00:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I was shocked it took so long to get department heads to let me fix problems. Improving productivity not only lowers staff requirements (therefore budgets) but, potentially exposes ineptitude depending on time they've held their position. How I discovered corps aren't capitalist.
1340021799006973954 2020-12-19 03:51:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 It's just digital calisthenics. I was actually told openly once by a hiring manager that they just want to fill seats with useless knobs because more people pads the health care racket. I believe that is a major factor in the middle management who don't see the big picture.
1340020193230204930 2020-12-19 03:44:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 The primary goal is to ensure that no individual is actually aware of the purpose of the system, even the project managers are usually highly specialized now. The excuse provided is fear of being held "hostage" by experts with complete understanding but, it's far more than that.
1340018694592860162 2020-12-19 03:38:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BLynch_23 @baccyleaves It's intentional. I've done expert systems by myself in multi-billion dollar corporations with great success.

1340016004177551360 2020-12-19 03:28:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @baccyleaves Same object that compartmentalization serves in government, the minimization of people who actually know what's going on, being done, by whom, and for what purpose. But, that's corporativism, corporations are merely extensions of government surreptitiously enacting state policy.
1340015018352529409 2020-12-19 03:24:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AnonymousSage1 All of this is a distraction from the global totalitarian corporativist state taking over the world.

I happen to know the purpose is compartmentalization but, the buzzwords thrown around would have people believe it's about "adaptability." That'll have to be added to the list of misleading euphemisms like "sustainability." 🙄

1339977508708626433 2020-12-19 00:55:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames And it was only possible because they ham-handedly threw an input filter script on it. I love "Agile," it basically ensures that nobody is qualified for any position they hold and nobody knows anything about the data model, lol. Achilles' heel in my opinion and, why they'll fail.

Not from an epidemiological standpoint and they can't actually work from a practical standpoint. I'm sure this additional evidence will have no effect on policy since it's obviously not based on scientific evidence.
1339960007237005314 2020-12-18 23:45:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheProffittier @1CupNoLiberty @thefreerifleman I think most pneumonia is bacterial if I'm not mistaken so it should as easy as looking at pneumonia cases on the whole. It would recorded as a "comorbidity" I presume in the case of death. Respiratory illnesses are not all necessarily pneumonia though either.

Not changing them frequently, when they get wet, etc. are all just additional risks piled onto the false security psychological issue. All of it is just distraction from GTCS.
1339956645254848515 2020-12-18 23:32:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @loxotic8 @TheProffittier @1CupNoLiberty @thefreerifleman The funny thing is that Fauci himself apparently participated in a paper which determined that bacterial pneumonia caused by masks was a primary cause of death in the "spanish flu" epidemic, unless that is also misinformation. Not a primary claim relevant to the takeover though.
1339956017942196225 2020-12-18 23:29:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates @libertytarian I'm not really questioning whether he is or isn't authentic or not. I just can't really know. It should be suspicious enough that he is more or less mainstream. He's not a source for me and, like I said, he was right about Agenda 21/2030 so I can't summarily dismiss him either.
1339954555996528646 2020-12-18 23:23:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheProffittier @1CupNoLiberty @thefreerifleman Mask debunk is pretty straight-forward.

He ought to be aware enough to have seen it. If he still isn't recognizing it, that's a significant negative indicator.

If someone like me who was about as untrusting of government as anyone took that many years to realize it, I'm not sure we can wait a decade for people to accept this is theatre. Upside is the science isn't really debatable so red-pilling much easier.
1339952408504528898 2020-12-18 23:15:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @1CupNoLiberty @thefreerifleman And the masked should be too since they don't work on viruses. There is an uptick in bacterial respiratory illnesses known to be caused by sustained mask usage so there's no question a new deadly viral pathogen is not prevalent.
1339951371114700801 2020-12-18 23:11:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates @libertytarian Could be, as we know, even shills have to include some legitimate information.

1339833013291675648 2020-12-18 15:20:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames One feature of the legacy interface was that it was a static page. Since the "unlike" script was server-side, you could toggle the like really quickly and it would only remove one like from the while loop total. I could put 30, 40 or even 50 likes on a tweet if network was slow.
1339831917877858304 2020-12-18 15:16:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames It's still not showing an interaction so you can probably see the "-1" thing now still. Go in and unclick the like, it will show -1 likes in the counter.  https://t.co/U7TemN3yvI
1339831476813242368 2020-12-18 15:14:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Yup, started for me in late 2016 around the time my pinned tweet stopped recording most activity. They've since deleted the master record for it so I can't even see what the impressions are anymore. It will go up and then interactions evaporate over course of a couple of days.
1339826704269926400 2020-12-18 14:55:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Next time you notice it on a virgin tweet with zero likes, unlike to start a toggle routine and look at the like counter. It goes to "-1." You can wait hours to attempt this and the behavior is the same establishing that it's not app or server lag.
1339825731497582592 2020-12-18 14:52:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames I think the idea is to prevent casual interactions from accruing on tweets that they want suppressed. Probably just accounts in shadowban but, the algorithm difficult to pin down. Appears to be a function of the limited feed, most followers only see a subset of tweets posted.
1339824942771302401 2020-12-18 14:48:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Not a glitch though. Happened all the time in the legacy interface which was a static page so no possibility of "app lag." I think that's why they shut down access to that interface a few months ago, too easy to see manipulation. Interact in a few tweets and it starts recording.
1339819076479311875 2020-12-18 14:25:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames I should probably document it more. It's easiest to see on virgin tweets with no likes. If you go back into the tweet you'll see a filled-in heart but no number in the "likes" counter. If you toggle the like and open and close the tweet a couple times, eventually it records it.
1339817913306517504 2020-12-18 14:20:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Part of why people's tweets don't have a lot of interactions is because twitter doesn't record them. I should do a screen recording of a session showing all the toggles necessary to get interactions to take, can be several.

It's the only thing that will work and it's just not an option for this to stand in the long run. The question is what will the casualties be by then?

1339727149813673985 2020-12-18 08:20:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KevinKautzman @Travis_Tyree We haven't really experienced a full year of planned economy yet. Food shortages and depression are almost on top of us already. The question is whether they will attempt to forestall those effects or exacerbated them. Probably both but in targeted ways against certain regions.
1339726145730822147 2020-12-18 08:16:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KevinKautzman @Travis_Tyree I would be surprised if anyone actually paid taxes next year. That's assuming there is still a federal government by then which seems like a coin flip at the moment.
1339725891593760769 2020-12-18 08:15:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KevinKautzman @Travis_Tyree I think taxes have become a non-issue in the sense that they really don't have anything to do with the financial system at all except that it was a way for the government to sop up currency and impoverish citizens. Debt is so big now taxes are basically irrelevant to big picture.
1339724774344429570 2020-12-18 08:10:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KevinKautzman @Travis_Tyree The thing we haven't talked about much is that the banking system was about to crash. It was inevitable and we've talked about it for decades but, a couple of fed magic tricks fell flat and I think this is at least in part a contingency plan for distracting from that collapse.
1339723042201759744 2020-12-18 08:03:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KevinKautzman @Travis_Tyree Concentration of surveillance and police dramatically increase the efficiency of their control assets at the very least. There are so many bad things about having people in cities it's hard to keep track. Much easier to do whatever terrible things might be done in general.
1339722132637532169 2020-12-18 08:00:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LockhartJam Makes me wonder if they could be sued for the endorsement. Manufacturers are absolved of liability but, I'm not sure if unassociated professional endorsements are covered in those indemnifications.
1339721668453871622 2020-12-18 07:58:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KevinKautzman @Travis_Tyree Going by Agenda 21/2030 and Great Reset plans, the idea is to cause the cessation of all independent economic activity and use resulting widespread dependence to corral all humans into cities. Been going on for a long time already but, gradually. This is a radical acceleration.
1339720915647651843 2020-12-18 07:55:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Timmyti60650909 Endorsed! 🤡
1339719572920930306 2020-12-18 07:50:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KevinKautzman @Travis_Tyree I sense it too. I want to get the idea of mass recall out there so people know what to do peacefully. Otherwise, people might just randomly fight back which actually helps totalitarians. At least that's what lockstep predicts to be used as justification for further restrictions.
1339718605030699009 2020-12-18 07:46:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Travis_Tyree I think that's what they are counting on. The thing I see no preparation for in any documentation is universal local renouncement of consent. It's the only way this can be done anyway. No government could claim consent with all of its towns in open but orderly peaceful revolt.

1339715904964321286 2020-12-18 07:35:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Conflagration of circumstances when you include the pandemic coronavirus exercise (event 201), military games in Wuhan, long delays in any response when spreading followed by hyper response just as it was petering out, etc. Was a plan to capitalize on it if not to release it.
1339714343122907140 2020-12-18 07:29:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames I remember it being controversial that that specific strain of coronavirus (not a particularly dangerous one mind you) was traced back to Fort Detrick. Shut down was the bigger story, many thought the outbreak may have even started there in late 2019.   https://t.co/3t6Lv8F0Ps

1339697964118380544 2020-12-18 06:24:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Under the impression that the original strain was confirmed to be developed at Fort Detrick. Shut down the program because of concerns about their gain of function efforts and research was moved to Wuhan. I'd have to go back and find sources but, didn't know it was in question.
1339684764345839616 2020-12-18 05:31:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RobertC81441651 Unfortunately, no. 😔
1339684566873874435 2020-12-18 05:31:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates It may seem that way but, the state directs corporations to achieve very specific ends. Ends which government couldn't implement without drawing attention to themselves in order to plan the economy. If they're caught it's blamed on "private business interests," process continues.
1339683729653059589 2020-12-18 05:27:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates Yes, major point I've been trying to make is that corporations are in fact nothing more than arms of the state. They follow the directives and implement the economic policies of the state. If they fail to do what they're told, they're replaced. That's the nature of corporativism.
1339681985917317120 2020-12-18 05:20:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates I think I see the problem. I have no confidence in any possibility of repairing the situation by relying on government. Well beyond the point where simply castigating and/or replacing state agents will result in a sea change in the aims of government. That ship is bombarding us.
1339680947634122753 2020-12-18 05:16:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates Perhaps this is true but, it seems like a distraction. Many organizations are known to have evil plans and they are all coming out of the woodwork to attack. If you can provide a plan for restoring civilization which relies solely on that assertion, I'm not sure what it would be.
1339678946166759430 2020-12-18 05:08:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In case it needs to be restated for the record. The virus released was engineered by government and carefully spread around the world. Local authorities then used police and other official agents to penetrate otherwise insulated environments in order to target at-risk patients.
1339676834976460806 2020-12-18 05:00:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates Gates has given us nothing.

1339670998749229058 2020-12-18 04:37:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates The story about the couple who committed suicide to "save the planet" had the opposite effect that was intended and was quickly brushed under the rug by the media. They really do want to trick people into killing themselves but, they'll settle for being allowed to murder them.
1339670487031541760 2020-12-18 04:35:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JackSundance It's such a transparent ruse and continues to be used by government despite all evidence. It's part of the confusingly necessary war on science and reason engaged in by sophists throughout history.
1339669853909757958 2020-12-18 04:32:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LindaO888 Many who have succumbed to the mirage of climate change and its related Malthusian mythologies are indeed enthusiastic antihumanists. Some tacitly and others openly but, the cancer has taken hold due to state education and media propaganda. They desperately need to be shamed.
1339667814785925121 2020-12-18 04:24:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Many great quotes detailing the folly of planned economy. A great difficulty I'm encountering is the fact that the evil we're currently up against does not actually misunderstand this point. It fully intends to use that feature as the mechanism to kill as many people as possible.

1339575952460943360 2020-12-17 22:19:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby The idea is most completely obliterated by the fundamental unenforceability in practical application but, through a series of simple logical steps, I'm confident we could identify the specific point at which we diverge. Therefore, it is certainly not a principle but an expedient.

Reality is that government actually enacted policies which destroyed private charities which used to provide a far better "safety net," it was truly evil what they did and why.

Should be clear that such laws invite misuse, discourage innovation.

Since all of the adverse reactions and some of the deaths caused by the treatment will be in the subset that would not have even contracted the pathogen, it's probably a wash. Better data in a decade though.

The idea is that a guy showed up in 2000 saying he was from 2036 and chatted with people for about a year on an online forum. It's essentially a modern ghost story or has the entertaining features of a tall tale.

1339247354814337024 2020-12-17 00:33:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IRA_Darth_Aggie Interventionism is poison and needs to be stopped. Not a fan of adjusting to these kinds of distortions. I don't think we should swim in that cesspool. I understand people have assets so no choice but, I'm coming at this from an economic standpoint, not as a beholden participant.
1339244441022967808 2020-12-17 00:22:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IRA_Darth_Aggie They are just executing the government's economic policies. It only works because the government has granted them virtual monopoly or cartel status within their "industry." Without that, competitors would displace them in an actual free market.
1339243992312057857 2020-12-17 00:20:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IRA_Darth_Aggie More importantly, the government ordered them to support it. Many of the policies adopted across the board in the corporate world are very damaging to their bottom lines. It's easiest to make sense of that fact when it's realized that they're not capitalist organizations at all.
1339243165358968832 2020-12-17 00:17:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IRA_Darth_Aggie Corporations just get replaced, rebranded, or the state takes over the "industry." Sometimes just replacing the masthead or placing a state official on the board is enough to quiet down the riffraff. A lot of people confuse corporativism with regulatory capture but, not the case.
1339242342096773120 2020-12-17 00:13:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @GhostOfEndora @epigwhisp There were a lot of anecdotal examples of fraud, too many to count really. I was just going by the indicator of command economy though so I didn't really need any convincing. I had no doubt what the goal was even before I had really read lockstep and the great reset materials.
1339241613189668867 2020-12-17 00:10:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IRA_Darth_Aggie Yes, whenever anyone gets caught doing something, they are replaced and the process resumes uninterrupted and perhaps picking up a little pace as many think the problem has been addressed.
1339241077736402945 2020-12-17 00:08:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IRA_Darth_Aggie In many ways, yes. I don't fight too hard against the left's belief that corporations are evil, they certainly are so it's a unifying factor. I mostly have to convince the right that corporations are anti-capitalist. The explanation of corporativism though explains it completely.
1339238126573793281 2020-12-16 23:57:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @GhostOfEndora @epigwhisp Yes, and the completely impossible uniformity of policy worldwide. A mistake here or there could be explained but not everybody making the same mistake everywhere all at once and then all invoking the same inappropriate measures immediately after. Had to coordinated and sinister.
1339236812968124417 2020-12-16 23:51:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @robinmonotti Without getting too technical, my understanding was that the only thing not supporting that hypothesis was that the tell-tale surrounding markers for a graft weren't there. Which in my mind could just mean the whole sequence was synthesized rather than grafting it into a sample.
1339235754036375555 2020-12-16 23:47:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @robinmonotti Crispr, I was under the impression that the origin of the strain was conclusively from Fort Detrick and then taken over to wuhan.
1339234332553203713 2020-12-16 23:42:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @GhostOfEndora @epigwhisp For whatever reason, maybe because of my Irish connections, I've found some of the Irish expert commentary to be among the most credible. Since the whole topic is a diversion, I never thought of this as a matter of scientific rivalry, just sources for good layman's explanations.
1339233088317100034 2020-12-16 23:37:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @GhostOfEndora @epigwhisp I haven't, my first task was to get up to speed on epidemiology, virology, and immunology since I wasn't well versed. Incredible to see the most respected epidemiologists being censored for giving appropriate recommendations. That and my command economy observations convinced me.
1339226217124392960 2020-12-16 23:09:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @GhostOfEndora @epigwhisp Fuguaci is definitely bad but, I don't really know if the lady is or not. Personal attacks on one whistleblower isn't particularly convincing since there are so many. I'm basically just sticking to the science I know and understand anyway and it's devastating to the narrative.

1339217117808365569 2020-12-16 22:33:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @serious_ass Yes, Georgia guide stones thing seems to be a genuine goal. I'm assuming this is incremental and focusing on fence-sitters with the understanding that more converters is more useful at the moment. Most people aren't likely to be brought wholly out of their trance right away.

1339209655965323265 2020-12-16 22:03:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @serious_ass Maybe, those are all legitimate concerns, particularly sterilization which seems to be the primary goal of just about every state medical program. I'm hoping they don't get that far with all of this. That said, if people discover they've been sterilized, they won't be happy.
1339209014048153601 2020-12-16 22:01:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @serious_ass @rangermonk1 Simple is probably best, just bag em. I am hoping some engineers will release rom images so their control systems will be better understood. Ultimately, if they become common enough, swapping out the rom and using them for counter-surveillance seems logical.
1339207274485739521 2020-12-16 21:54:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @serious_ass @rangermonk1 Full of useful parts, I for one encourage their immediate release.
1339205264675909632 2020-12-16 21:46:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Disseminating the general description for mass recall is critical in case we do lose power/comms. Towns will have to communicate with their neighboring towns to determine overall adoption and to determine timing. Messy but, best we can hope for and it can't really be interrupted.
1339204515631919105 2020-12-16 21:43:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The next attack according to the documentation we have available is likely to be a coordinated disruption of banking, communications, and electricity. It could also be in tandem with follow up biological attack as first one is fizzling out. At least we know who the aggressor is.
1339203550782611456 2020-12-16 21:39:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This biological attack conducted by the governments of the world as cover for conversion to a planned economy is not working out quite as I imagine they intended. It is taking longer than I would like to fully debunk but, be prepared for their next attack which could be anything.

1339188626157146112 2020-12-16 20:40:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Notorreyious @Deth2BigTech @HotepJesus @benavrim I agree that the US ought to be a leader in the global struggle against all of this but, I think mass recall will work wherever it is implemented and it does not require an armed population.
1339187484299833346 2020-12-16 20:35:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Chesschick01 The gobbledygook is discombobulating.

Indeed, things got a lot worse. Whether you think that's his doing or his failing is essentially irrelevant.

1339182384026095617 2020-12-16 20:15:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Notorreyious @HotepJesus @benavrim Yes, I'm not saying it didn't happen, just that it's not just happening in the US which is what is implied by  assigning the goal merely to this US election.
1339181731585331202 2020-12-16 20:13:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Yes, corporativism is a unification of corporate interests with state. It should be understood though that that's a one-way street from state to corporation. Too many view the state as powerless when they're directing it. "Nothing outside the state" wasn't a meaningless abstract.
1339179498449883137 2020-12-16 20:04:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Timmyti60650909 @AxelSavage4 @RickyBobby_USA @LovinIntention @jamesmarks176 @thpuzzler2 @Dave60866998 @LibertyViking1 @crosshairsonyou @JohnLeksander @JSmiffey @chbstone2 @scottkemp3 @DFSSoapBox @noneofy18309084 @AutoVisionzEmbl @MattRayLiberty That's a sufficient understanding to know they are not on the side of the public but, corporativism is all inclusive. They are organs of state and are the mechanism by which government can implement economic planning which would otherwise be unconstitutional. Bigger and simpler.

1339166527132676096 2020-12-16 19:12:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HotepJesus @benavrim It's a lot bigger than that.
1339163095026032640 2020-12-16 18:58:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think tyrants, totalitarians, useful idiots, and mindless followers should be very glad it'll be likely be people like me who advise the public on the conditions of their handling and captivity.

1339155544813264898 2020-12-16 18:28:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BardsFM @HambrickRo Mass recall will be a big surprise to the minority of stupid, deranged, manipulative, and evil people who're mostly connected to government or government money. Your improvised imprisonment will likely be more humane than an institutional one though, even if you don't deserve it.
1339153695070674945 2020-12-16 18:21:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> What's known is that masks don't work against viruses and you can't maintain universal medical isolation so this insane attempt to prevent less deadly mutations from reaching the general population is not working and natural community immunity is thankfully happening anyway.  https://t.co/ftBTjcTFnc
1339148679605837826 2020-12-16 18:01:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @zhenstranger Yes, it a pretty think scam when you look at it closely.
1339148412978073601 2020-12-16 18:00:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @yankee_bailey I go into a little more details about mass recall in this thread.  https://t.co/2I6l0V6h3h
1339147084918874115 2020-12-16 17:55:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LadyLubberty Even in blue states like Mass and NY, etc., relentless propaganda has been shoved down people's throats for decades and it still hasn't really gelled. A family might have 1 or 2 women enthusiastic for the garbage but the rest are quietly rolling their eyes. They think it'll pass.
1339064095136501762 2020-12-16 12:25:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dddalach I think we're just seeing the fringe. Media is driving the narrative so we're just not seeing much else. Problem isn't their prevalence but, the silence of the fearful. Simmering vexation is dangerously close to boiling which is why I think it's key people know about mass recall.
1339052175222317057 2020-12-16 11:38:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RebelScumHan I've had mostly positive results with my only-mutuals tradition. Some hate follows turn out to be constructive criticism and the ones who can't handle that generally block me. I don't see the high-profile activity so my impressions are not heavily influenced by opinion leaders.
1339051091359567877 2020-12-16 11:33:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @metwying I think using the psyop known as political parties against itself is a good initial strategy. However, the ace-in-the-hole is the widespread criminal activity throughout the system. Whichever "side" anyone thinks they're on, it will dissolve as they are exposed as criminal gangs.
1339048511703281665 2020-12-16 11:23:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @after_wisdom Don't get me wrong, weak can be very dangerous. But it just means we have to raise the decibel level high enough to drown out the monotony they're afraid of. If we don't steer the herd, it will go off the cliff but, we can steer the herd.
1339048136908664835 2020-12-16 11:22:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @after_wisdom What I've noticed is that friends and family who don't speak up are just afraid to ask questions. They know something is up but, they'd rather not get involved. It's very different than the supposed enthusiasm we're all expected to believe in. They're simply weak, not foolish.
1339047430428430336 2020-12-16 11:19:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbomberhat Automated accounts sound a lot like stupid people. Also, stupid people probably aren't itching to get into rows on public forums. It just doesn't add up. I think they're mostly fake. All the high-profile tyrants are club members. They might also be stupid but, they are insiders.
1339046655753146368 2020-12-16 11:16:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @carguy98204 It looks like that but, I'm not convinced. The more I actually look closely at the loud mouths, the more I suspect their aren't any legitimate defenders of this. All of the ones I've seen are connected to the state, corporations, NGOs, or are even actually automated accounts.
1339046065941655552 2020-12-16 11:13:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @after_wisdom At some point people will realize that media is showing them fiction. It's worked to keep people from investigating but, once they start talking amongst themselves and stop being afraid for their soon-to-be-nonexistent jobs, the truth will become apparent.
1339044683411042305 2020-12-16 11:08:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think most of the people advocating totalitarianism are lying. They're mostly paid actors, government employees, etc. Can't put my finger on it exactly but, I don't think there's a majority of people actually supporting any of this. Most are just keeping their heads down still.
1339035131269541888 2020-12-16 10:30:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's important to laugh and a great way to expose people to the truth but, it should be remembered that mass recall will actually happen. Reason I know that's true is because nothing else will actually work and there's simply no possibility that what's being attempted will stand.

1339020473909334016 2020-12-16 09:32:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Because it's assumed that some official records will be secured but that much of the evidence will be difficult to produce, part of the object of extensive rigorous trials is to document individual crimes, record testimony from victims. A reliable historical record is paramount.
1339008235752349701 2020-12-16 08:43:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FrogTurds This is a quaint outlook but, it betrays a persistent confidence in the maintenance of the existing authority structures which will not be the case. In their absence, we must construct a justifiable and well-documented legal process for establishing the fate of anyone accused.
1339007596167098368 2020-12-16 08:41:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We could be talking about as much as 5-10% of the population in some cases so this isn't a minor issue by any stretch and no, there will be no summary executions. Sorry to disappoint but, the whole idea is to save civilization, not forsake it as they have done. Rigorous trials.
1339006339687788544 2020-12-16 08:36:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Understand that by selecting none, the facilities to house them all will be significant. It isn't really realistic to imagine holding them all in existing jails and holding facilities. Non-violent offenders will likely be placed into the custody of households suited to hold them.
1339004579996987397 2020-12-16 08:29:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FrogTurds In order to restore rule of law and to reestablish civil society, we'll need to adequately prosecute each offender in a descending order of importance. The focus will initially be on individuals responsible for severe harm or death inflicted on innocents, minor criminals after.
1339001844358635520 2020-12-16 08:18:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> After mass recall there will be a large number of prisoners to manage. It may be necessary to release some of them temporarily on their own recognizance. Which of these government workers should be granted such leniency with the understanding that they will still stand trial?

1338980199166341120 2020-12-16 06:52:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RT_com If true, it just means the virus is "burning out" in the healthy population despite the best attempts of universal medical isolationists to keep it going. If community immunity is allowed to occur, successful mutations become more contagious and less deadly. Normal and desirable.

1338813277695074307 2020-12-15 19:48:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus One of the concerns is the process by which RNA can be taken up into permanent DNA. For some reason the adenovirus used in gene therapies resulted in the immune system attacking the host's organs as it was inadvertently trained to view the host's organs as foreign bodies.
1338812132692013057 2020-12-15 19:44:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus That's the basic idea, yes. It doesn't actually train your immune system to detect and destroy SARS-CoV2, just the spike protein which is why it doesn't actually convey immunity to SARS-CoV2. Of course, that's if everything goes as planned and assuming that's the genetic payload.
1338810756029165568 2020-12-15 19:38:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Amanda26124748 Yes, not much can be done about that. Best we can do is let everyone know what the solution is so that they don't just freak out when they finally wake up. Eventually this will have to be an in-person local endeavor to inform everyone in your town of the situation.
1338806982417862656 2020-12-15 19:23:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Amanda26124748 A lot of them will be killed by the totalitarian state so this process is somewhat self-correcting. Whatever the tipping point is will be up to them. Ironically, their capitulation to the depopulation agenda will be at least partially realized by their own unwitting sacrifice.
1338805500805345283 2020-12-15 19:17:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Amanda26124748 It's total insanity. Truth is those people have no will of their own and no interest in any kind of rational inspection of available data or deployment of any scientific methods which means they will do whatever they're told. Eventually, the truth will emerge and they'll follow.
1338804018177511427 2020-12-15 19:12:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mjonausk Issue isn't really about the effectiveness of the gene therapy to produce anti-proteins. That process, even if effective, doesn't really result in immunity exactly either. This is about conducting a genetic experiment on human beings and waiting just ten days before proceeding.
1338801941816766465 2020-12-15 19:03:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Amanda26124748 Spread the word about mass recall. All totalitarianisms are eventually forced to employ overt violence to support policies once the initial allowance afforded by unsuspecting and uneducated people is expended. I'm not sure exactly how long that will take but, it will be obvious.

1338595860435898371 2020-12-15 05:24:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @nihiofkdi @shazdeven @InfectiousMyth Yes, and the "drink bleach" story, lol. High dose study was the actual explanation if you dig down to the bottom of official explanation for any of the bans though. It was like 10 to 50 times stronger than it needed to be. Standard practice with lab rats but, not human subjects.
1338593727204401152 2020-12-15 05:16:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @shazdeven @nihiofkdi @InfectiousMyth The studies which claimed that it was "dangerous" were apparently conducted with enormous quantities, far above what would actually be necessary or prescribed completely invalidating those results.
1338593300215984128 2020-12-15 05:14:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @shazdeven @nihiofkdi @InfectiousMyth My understanding is that it facilitates the absorption of zinc into cells which is the actual medicinal mechanism slowing the propagation of the virus. The same effect could theoretically allow other chemicals to more easily penetrate but, my impression is that it's beneficial.
1338591608690929669 2020-12-15 05:08:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AdamsJoenice Anything's possible but, I'd say we haven't seen an explosion of the syndrome so attributing it to microwave radiation seems inapplicable, at least to the circumstances thus far. Not dismissing the dangers of high levels of microwave exposure but, it's not a factor yet at least.
1338588077024030724 2020-12-15 04:54:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @nihiofkdi Trying to fit it all in one tweet. I would add that it is effective against whatever the condition is and whatever it is caused by in the at-risk group as identified by those developing the syndrome, the common cold, some variant, or tummy demons.
1338586250106843139 2020-12-15 04:46:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Apparently some people think HCQ is ineffective or something. It's always been perhaps the only effective treatment. Issue as claimed by opponents was that it's dangerous so they banned it. I think banning the only effective treatment is criminal myself but, that's what they did.
1338582730586648576 2020-12-15 04:32:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Pleaseh32324321 Let me know if you hear anything. I'm treating it as hearsay for now.

I'm curious about details like the supposed HIV component. Sounds like an engineered bioweapon and HIV is apparently a side effect of some vaccinations.🤷‍♂️
1338581166849482763 2020-12-15 04:26:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Big_twig_guy @fivestarmichael @Chesschick01 @TheConservatar7 Basically zero evidence of that sort. If it really was a dangerous pathogen to anyone but people over 80 with two or comorbidities, there would be stacks of bodies since the police have been spreading/interacting heavily with everyone with no PPE from the outset and throughout.
1338579049090838530 2020-12-15 04:18:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Newnameel Cloud the field sort of thing, could be. If people paying attention are confused, you can be sure the superficial observers are completely lost at this point.

That's another one of the fake stories they pushed around as a diversion from talking about the only actual treatment (HCQ.) This story might be fake as well to divert from the handful of Bell's palsy cases. I don't know yet though. 🤷‍♂️
1338567473361285128 2020-12-15 03:32:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Maybe it's a diversion tactic. There are legitimate reports of vaccine damage so it could be a story designed to refer to if the question comes up. A talking head or politician could say, "no that was a fake story, blahdy-blah... don't be silly."  Dunno.
1338566761671757825 2020-12-15 03:29:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TuskBilasimo Yeah, basically. 😱
1338566445823832068 2020-12-15 03:28:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HolliCarr4 I'm trying to figure out if it's even true. It doesn't really make sense. We're all expecting people to get hurt but, probably not for a while as would be the expectation of a poorly tested or trojan treatment. Not instant harm/death which would completely defeat the purpose.
1338565680657002496 2020-12-15 03:25:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mattassmith Yeah, I saw that one too which is definitely true. This one doesn't really make any sense though. 🤷‍♂️

The alarm that got my attention.
1338532078506418177 2020-12-15 01:11:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HegKong It's about restricting free movement. Whatever the mechanism, the goal is to require asking for permission and providing foreknowledge of destination. It's a function of planned economy which simply can't withstand undirected migration. If not this, it would be some other excuse.

1338526203557384193 2020-12-15 00:48:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LarkinWilder I can understand the sentiment. I only can stress that tools are tools and deploying them in opposition to our enemies is much preferable to attempting to prevent their usage by anyone which is actually impossible. Doesn't mean you don't blow up enemy tanks though.
1338525003025965058 2020-12-15 00:43:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jake77052429 Yup, it's clearly not. I think it's even appropriate to say that any population suffering under government is necessarily unfree. It would be difficult to contradict that statement since any attempt would involve citing the power of government to restrict voluntary interactions.
1338522109677539331 2020-12-15 00:31:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @barrymerritt @bharri45 It's not a technical argument for "pretty good privacy." It's a reference to early discussions about popular usage of encryption for electronic communications. The basic form was "why do you send letters in envelopes, instead of postcards which are cheaper, to communicate?"

It is simply impossible for everyone everywhere to decide on a universal system and it just causes friction to those who might want a government.
1338520235721302033 2020-12-15 00:24:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Devinbear5 @1ThessCh5 Definitely, I call it the global totalitarian corporativist state. Technocracy is a term they use to describe themselves. Patrick Wood has been on top of it for decades apparently. Whatever we choose to call it, it is real and it means to control all resources, land and life.

Part of the problem is that removal of politicians is also a goal of technocracy. We have to "ban" or at least severely discourage centralization itself if we want to build a world safe for individuals and individualism.

A combination of drugs and repetitive conditioning qualifies but, probably not a simple additive. But, I don't know as I've said. If you can be ordered to die, you can probably be ordered to take just about anything.

1338495148641185796 2020-12-14 22:44:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Ultimately, the great success of cyberneticists in deceiving the public was the achievement of getting people to fear "robots" through pop culture references such as Terminator, etc. instead of scrutinizing the project managers and their masters, the bureaucrats and politicians.

All of the problems which directly harm everyone and have no possibility of constructive reform are exclusively associated with centralization, and government. In corporativism, that includes corporations.

1338480005853159424 2020-12-14 21:44:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I presume the idea is to get people to demand better "cybersecurity." Which is to say, in actual practice, through their incompetence or guile, to get you to demand more invasive and total "control" over "social" systems which interface biological and electronic systems.
1338478526870282244 2020-12-14 21:38:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It would've been called a data security breach even recently. It's subtle but, I think significant that such terminology is being injected into the narrative all over the place. Other examples of social engineering linguistic seeding and penetration include "sustainability," etc.
1338477349696888832 2020-12-14 21:34:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's probably also worth noting the choice of terminology with these electronic security systems failures constructed by the government to protect our critical systems from unauthorized breach. They are calling it a "cyber" breach, as in "cybernetics" which is social engineering.

1338468520175300609 2020-12-14 20:58:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Ironically, the decentralized nature of the internet would be immune to such interference but for the extreme centralization of these types of services. Indeed, I find it hard to believe that google isn't at least a little distributed in its architecture.
1338467917806100483 2020-12-14 20:56:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This is the sort of thing I have been expecting. It is consistent with Klaus von Auschwitz's threat of a global hack of systems as the trigger for further centralization of all digital services. I expect banking, communications and electricity to all experience similar "attacks."

1338440174519410690 2020-12-14 19:06:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates Can recipients shed the vaccine before it attacks all of their own cells? Too many unanswered questions seem to clearly indicate that the information conduits are tightly controlled to censor such questions. There's not even a canned response as would normally be the case.
1338439634041368580 2020-12-14 19:04:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArrestGates That should be a major concern and I'm not hearing it talked about at all. It's adenovirus for Pete's sake, of course it's contagious. Even if it doesn't carry a payload capable of replicating itself, what's the viral count of the injection? Is there a body weight adjusted dose?

Simply the case that masks don't prevent viruses from being released or inhaled.

1338077058950377472 2020-12-13 19:03:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Anyone who's primary argument is that "it's the law" are squarely in the former category while those who tend to appeal to "common sense," however mistaken their reasoning is, are probably in the latter group.
1338076240452972545 2020-12-13 19:00:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The former have declared themselves enemies of all humanity and deserve the very worst punishments we can summon the stomach to inflict. Be sure to keep track of who they are but, the merely gullible are a more complicated problem. Can be hard to distinguish but I think possible.
1338075267949076487 2020-12-13 18:56:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I support deriding and shaming pro-totalitarian idiots of all stripes. Those who advocate totalitarianism for its own sake and understand what they are doing and those who think this is about a bad cold. As the latter begin to come around to their error, we should forgive them.
1338065598446776320 2020-12-13 18:17:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Some are claiming that military distribution of this "vaccine" is a trap to obtain evidence. It's a falsifiable claim so we'll find out right away if it's true by whether they confiscate the deliveries for evaluation or try to actually administer it. This will be conclusive.

There were pockets of people insulated from the atrocities for sure but, they simply didn't know about them which is very different than accepting or approving of them. I think containing information is a lot harder now.

1337766504578822147 2020-12-12 22:29:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Devinbear5 @veggiesandherbs Exactly, the more deadly, the less of a threat of propagation. The only way around this "problem," from the perspective of mass-murdering bioterrorist psychopaths, is to directly introduce a deadly pathogen artificially to each and every victim in a systematized way. 🤔
1337765786321113091 2020-12-12 22:26:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The principle of centralization is completely open-ended. There's no point at which central control is not desirable to those who believe it's superior to independent decision making. Any limits to centralization are viewed with contempt by central planners. Thus, here we are.
1337764420332695555 2020-12-12 22:21:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Devinbear5 @veggiesandherbs Once I understood that viruses tend to trade off successful mutations for communicability over deadliness just as a mathematical truism, it became clear that it was the explanation for viral burnout, not non-mutated original sequences introduced artificially en masse.
1337763173915561987 2020-12-12 22:16:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @veggiesandherbs I owe it to mothers specifically for getting me to look at the problem and educate myself enough to understand the mechanisms and history. It's easy for computer scientists to view biological systems as on par with electronic, especially with shared terminology like "coding."
1337762210282663942 2020-12-12 22:12:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Devinbear5 I think it's just comfortable to think that we possess systemic means to subvert natural phenomena. This is only one example. Simply put, many people just believe that enough money and time thrown at a problem will produce a satisfactory solution in all cases.
1337761528704069632 2020-12-12 22:09:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Devinbear5 @veggiesandherbs In just about every case I looked at over the last century or more, I was unconvinced that a vaccine and not community immunity were responsible for the cessation of all of the outbreaks. Additionally, vaccines were typically associated with flare-ups.
1337760875541909505 2020-12-12 22:07:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Devinbear5 Yes, I've seen an abundance of evidence, or lack thereof depending on the context, that the pathogen itself is suspiciously unconfirmed or ill-defined. Since command economy is the dead giveaway that the goal is totalitarianism, I chose conventional science to refute policies.
1337758587033182210 2020-12-12 21:57:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Devinbear5 @veggiesandherbs Yes, my "all bad" conclusion was just because I ran out of space, lol. I can't think of a safe or necessary vaccine after looking into it. That said, this untested experimental gene therapy is on an entirely different level of insane. Even many vaccine proponents are against it.

1337757135233556481 2020-12-12 21:52:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @veggiesandherbs I was hesitant to refute vaccination before all of this. I was basically indifferent, even thought vaccinations probably indirectly benefitted me that others took them. After researching for myself since this began, I can safely state that all of that was entirely wrong, all bad.
1337754790097522695 2020-12-12 21:42:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I go into a little more detail about what is involved, what to expect, and what the ultimate goal is here.  https://t.co/2I6l0V6h3h
1337752356927254528 2020-12-12 21:33:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 That's why I think mass recall is the curveball.

1337687909449814017 2020-12-12 17:17:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Many are simply designed to bankrupt independent companies and exhaust individual savings. But, if you examine each of the preposterous edicts governments have issued, they all have a direct connection to implications associated with planned economy if you look closely enough.
1337686061363974146 2020-12-12 17:09:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Whatever happens, no matter what the real world situation is, government cannot and will not allow individuals to resume unapproved and uncoordinated activity ever again. This is important to realize. They actually can't stop now. It is why only mass recall can lift the yoke now.
1337684499329642497 2020-12-12 17:03:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It should be apparent that the inappropriate use of inaccurate testing at vast scale is being used to maintain lockdowns perpetually. It's because government forced us into planned economy and free movement cannot be allowed. If this ruse fails then some other excuse will emerge.

Even those who are generally pro-vaccine have well-founded serious concerns about this untested experimental gene therapy. Nothing about it is on the up-and-up.

1337658970014670850 2020-12-12 15:22:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Newnameel I have to believe it will become possible since it's the only thing that will work. I think the tipping point will be when normal people start to fear security state. It can't be far off. All totalitarianisms begin with cooperation of the fearful and then have to become violent.
1337658025985773571 2020-12-12 15:18:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Newnameel Everything that's happened since has been a distraction from the fact that we became a planned economy. Also seem to be very real depopulation ends in play but, the movement restrictions, etc. were easily predictable and no surprise since they're requirements of planned economy.
1337657159434297346 2020-12-12 15:14:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Newnameel The indicator for me was when we were forcibly converted to a command economy back in April. I thought about it for a while and decided that, if governments were willing to surreptitiously do that, there was no way to fix it other than peaceful town level civil rebellion.

I'll just send the government my updated my terms of service and include information about my community guidelines and Bob's your uncle.

What the genetic payload is completely unknown to all but the manufacturer. Getting samples of every batch for independent testing seems like an important thing to focus on.

Plenty of replacements waiting for their chance but, he appears to have been a major investment. It doesn't end with his failure but, his failure is necessary to turn the tide.
1337458226464514049 2020-12-12 02:04:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience I think critical mass is when ordinary people start fearing subjugation more than freedom. It's just a matter of time, I hope it doesn't take too long.
1337456133519384582 2020-12-12 01:56:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience I think so too, spot on.

Stick to reason and deny what is deniable until it isn't. I began with a healthy distrust of authority, government in particular, and it still took me this long. It really does take effort.

1337321475607572481 2020-12-11 17:01:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Bad as it is, this only gets worse. Mass recall is the only solution. Start thinking about it. Stop dismissing it. This cannot be allowed to stand. This will not end well one way or another. It's much preferable to stop it now than to allow this cancer to metastasize any further.

1337292673275863043 2020-12-11 15:06:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @checkmatestate I've thought about this a lot and determined that only one thing will save us, mass recall. Decentralization is the only answer possible in a world where everyone can't agree on how everybody should govern themselves everywhere. It's simple, true, and will work.
1337278549288423425 2020-12-11 14:10:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think it's fair to say that making the cover of Time is the quintessential measure of infamy at this point.

If people are aware of how it works, even if they let this intentional release slide, the next intentional release of an engineered pathogen will be about a century too soon.

1337099681332146179 2020-12-11 02:19:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's a good thing everyone is 100% on-board with the edicts of government bureaucrats no matter what they say. It'll be much easier to live once choice is completely removed from life. Decisions are so stupid, right? Independent thought is totally dangerous and anti-democratic.
1337098576019812353 2020-12-11 02:15:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm glad I replaced my entire wardrobe with mask-friendly neck attachments since everyone must wear masks forever. The decrease in oxygen has caused a welcome reduction in cognitive ability making acceptance of all of this much easier. I want cameras to watch me everywhere I go.
1337097266969145344 2020-12-11 02:10:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Thanks to the brave snitches, nobody will ever be able to do things that aren't approved. I'm sure there won't be any negative consequences to any of this at all ever. All of this is resulting in a much better society and everybody is much happier and safetier.
1337096236655124482 2020-12-11 02:05:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I hear the army will stand at every street corner with flu tests, so brave. It's all for your health, trust them. I love the new normal, it's so much better than the old normal. I never want that nasty old normal ever again. Good thing it will never come back.
1337093502241550337 2020-12-11 01:55:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I hope the mandatory flu gene therapy comes out soon so we can get through the next lockdown which is concurrent with this one though we just haven't been told yet. Not sure if you knew that the flu is actually worse than SARS-CoV-2. Should only take a couple of months, right? 🤔
1337089613219975171 2020-12-11 01:39:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames I am 100% certain that this has nothing to do with overzealous safety. It is the opposite of cautiousness in every conceivable way.
1337089261661790209 2020-12-11 01:38:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames So, we should do the same thing for the "bad flu" too, right? Rush an untested experimental mRNA flu gene therapy out to everybody in the world. After all, the bad flu is actually technically worse than SARS-COv2 by the fatality rates as I understand it. None of this makes sense.
1337088443621519360 2020-12-11 01:35:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames And do enough copies result in artificial shedding? Could those at risk of allergic reaction get exposed through vaccinated individuals? Etc, etc... None of these types of issues are addressed at all. It just doesn't make any sense from a medical standpoint to do any of this.
1337081587024924674 2020-12-11 01:07:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Yes, and it begs the question, what is the actual dose of synthesized virus if it doesn't reproduce? Do fat people get a double dose? Is there a weight to milliliter chart for delivery? A synthetic viral load count? Seems like it's a standardized dose which doesn't make sense.
1337075815830474755 2020-12-11 00:44:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames And even in that scenario, it wouldn't go down like this.
1337075421507149827 2020-12-11 00:43:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Yes, who knows but, SARS-CoV2 (if it exists and I decided to keep my mind open to the possibility that it doesn't though I think it does) is already in the environment while the new custom designed virus is has not yet infected the world. Government is insisting that it happen.
1337073399751991298 2020-12-11 00:35:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Yes, that's it. There is no reason to take that risk and they are going full steam. They have not done the normal safety testing phases and fully intend to deliver to it everybody before any data is available about safety. That in itself is cause for concern. It must be stopped.
1337072532273438722 2020-12-11 00:31:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames That's the AAV's primary advantage, that it can evade the immune system. The question is, does the virus replicate. If it does, it could be communicable. If it replicates, evades the immune system, and sheds, I can't see how that isn't a major concern, whatever its function is.
1337071342424887296 2020-12-11 00:27:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames To take such risks over what amounts to a mild seasonal irritation is inexplicable and merits additional attention since it is totally unnecessary. Everything that has been done by the state has been contrary to all scientific evidence, medical procedure, and ethical conduct.
1337070683734552577 2020-12-11 00:24:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Supposed to anyway. I'll have to find the name of the phenomenon but, it's possible in certain instances that DNA can be permanently updated from RNA. Again, we just don't know and that's my concern. The idea that experimenting at a global scale is even considered is reckless.
1337067834019606531 2020-12-11 00:13:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames This is both a feature and a troubling capability. In theory, it could be contagious and if it inadvertently does anything unintended, we will have introduced a new designer disease. It's not impossible to permanently change the human gene pool in ways not yet known.
1337067068680761344 2020-12-11 00:10:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames It's a gene therapy so it could introduce pretty much anything. It's not just new tech, it was shut down in the 2000s when first gen adenovirus caused the immune system to attack organs causing death. This is an adeno-associated virus which is better at evading the immune system.
1337065955445403651 2020-12-11 00:05:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @epigwhisp Everything I've heard about him is suspicious, way beyond merely being a hack. He's been on the government payroll basically his whole life. I only delved briefly into his record with HIV/AIDS and it was pretty bad.
1337062420838297601 2020-12-10 23:51:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Not the first time I've heard mention of it. I would like to hear someone knowledgable debunk each point specifically. It's consistent with the kinds of side effects I'm worried about though, better to stick to accidental rather than accusing anyone of intentional harm. Caution.
1337035460640649219 2020-12-10 22:04:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Since you are complaining about the lockdown, officials have authorized a new protocol for house arrest. Remember, the state is your biggest fan. 🔨🦶🥰  https://t.co/K9yuNZJIT1

It would essentially mean that this experiment could potentially be on every human being all at once. No undo, no recourse, no remedy. That's assuming they aren't completely insane which may not be the case.
1337024434809565189 2020-12-10 21:20:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MuttBull @t0ugh3r @blogchatter Yup, none of it makes sense even before considering the implications of this "vaccine." I'm trying to figure out if the synthesized adeno-associated virus carrying the genetic payload is itself communicable. I imagine it could be a recipient gets sick and sheds the "vaccine."
1337020804505202689 2020-12-10 21:06:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MuttBull @t0ugh3r @blogchatter I don't think anyone should get this vaccine at all. It's way more dangerous than the infection to almost everybody. The at-risk group is usually so close to dying already (two or more comorbidities in most cases) that the side effects probably makes any benefit not worth it.
1337016941366681601 2020-12-10 20:50:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The thing is, most people forget that when they are asleep, the plague can jump right down their throat. I suggest placing a pillow firmly on the face while sleeping. Otherwise, you know, grandma. 💀
1336992570774335490 2020-12-10 19:14:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @t0ugh3r @blogchatter Also, you are correct. Your cruise ship example is a good analog for what epidemiologists actually recommended and recommend. That is, medical isolation only for the at-risk until community immunity develops. That process is thwarted by institution of universal medical isolation.

1336989459997454337 2020-12-10 19:01:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @t0ugh3r @blogchatter Since children don't become sick, they don't shed virions generally. Parents are almost as immune to becoming sick and are no more likely to develop the syndrome known as COVID-19.

1336932412668981249 2020-12-10 15:15:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Anyone still virtue signaling masks, vaccines, lockdowns, etc. are not paying attention, being paid by the perpetrators in some way, or are well and truly not in possession of their faculties. They might just simply be evil too but, I'd like to think that's a little more rare.
1336930392142704641 2020-12-10 15:06:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JulieBorowski Except that masks are bad for you, have no effect on viral transmissions, and making people wear them is the opposite of caring about them. Otherwise, I agree.
1336923844003639296 2020-12-10 14:40:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ForestMommy It allows you to avoid the vaccination issue entirely if done preemptively. They can't argue because they're encouraging the hypochondria. They can't insist on vaccination because there would never be contact again. It should be the least confrontational way to avoid the crazies.
1336923146335756288 2020-12-10 14:38:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ForestMommy I've been thinking about this presuming we fail to oppose the takeover of the world by psychopaths right away. I think simply saying that you don't feel comfortable coming into contact with anyone is the solution. Offer to manage databases, communications, etc. but, no on-site.

1336699932003213312 2020-12-09 23:51:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @thuletide I do retweet a lot of material from people who are much better at specific exposés. My basic strategy is to stay general, focus on the risks, and cite evidence supporting patterns and agendas. I think I reach a lot of people on the fence. Hard to say but, I think it's helpful. 🤷‍♂️

If I simply click like, it records a filled in heart which it displays to me and possibly sends a notification to the recipient but does not update the likes counter on the tweet.

Exposure may be enough to contract it.

Is any mention being censored or is it just not a risk for some reason I'm not aware of? I know adenovirus is highly contagious and adeno-associated virus is what the gene therapy is based around.

1336418691773292547 2020-12-09 05:13:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @t0ugh3r @RussellOkung Government isn't just incorrect though. It's not merely useless. It is actively causing almost all the harm in the world on a day-to-day basis. I submit that its removal would alleviate more problems than all of the successful solutions it could ever actually realize.
1336417629322481669 2020-12-09 05:09:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @marchensley As an example, if it turns out that the number 2 is not actually valued at 2 but at 2.3, then the result of 4 would be incorrect. But, if the equation was rebalanced after the variables are adjusted, the result would be 4.6.
1336417150051946503 2020-12-09 05:07:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @marchensley OK, I'm not sure how that changes the meaning conveyed by the statement though. I'm sure there is a way to say it that satisfies the semantic requirements to be more logically absolute. I just have limited characters in a tweet.
1336414498354290688 2020-12-09 04:57:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @marchensley The current known physical limits provide the variables so, if they are wrong, the output will be adjusted. The most important factors are really time and location. That is, there may be X number of civilizations but, are they happening simultaneously and in close proximity.

1336409770933313540 2020-12-09 04:38:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @marchensley It's a formula so if any variables change significantly, it could become a possibility, however unlikely. At present, the variables make contact extremely unlikely and completely preclude any kind of communication making organizational structures across vast distances impossible.
1336408678627471362 2020-12-09 04:33:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dddalach The statistics just don't support the idea. They are 99.999999% likely to just be lying for their own benefit based on historical experience and alien visitation, particularly involving direct political contact, is about 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% likely.
1336407983987830786 2020-12-09 04:31:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dddalach No doubt the governments of the world are almost completely opaque. They do nothing to help, everything to harm, conceal all evidence, release all criminals, steal, rape, murder, etc. They are also quite incompetent. It's just that with enough power and money, lid can be kept on.

1336404917435691009 2020-12-09 04:18:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Rtonkins74 @BrazenJWT An admission of continuous lying up to this point (if we take it at face value.) Otherwise, it's naked deception which they must realize will backfire. Every transgression so far is so outrageous that no person with foresight would do it unless no expectation of accountability.

The Gates polio vaccine contained the full pathogen and the infected started shedding so it's now the prevalent version of polio outbreaks in Africa.

1335953313804783617 2020-12-07 22:24:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @DracoVonFaust @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 When a person becomes hostile, they become a bully. It is conversational but, the reason the term arose in the course of the description of these types of interactions is because of the similarities between the two modes, verbal and physical.
1335952176871579650 2020-12-07 22:19:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @DracoVonFaust @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 Bullying is in fact the topic. Again, you have developed a separate conversation which are engaging in with a phantom version of your correspondent rather than simply reading what is said and responding to that.
1335951792128090112 2020-12-07 22:18:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 It's just as valid as your 30+ years of experience, maybe more so as I believe it describes human behavior a little more accurately as a whole. More people would shake their head with disappointment at walking away from a bully than saying "he took the high road, good for him."
1335951252505698306 2020-12-07 22:16:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @DracoVonFaust @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 Isn't "flaming" unsolicited harassment?
1335951071747993601 2020-12-07 22:15:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 Maybe it's a character flaw of mine related to "white knighting." I just can't let the bully get away with it. Rather than break their nose, in real life I have generally stood my ground and used derision and taunting right back at them. They never seem to be expecting that.
1335950371773149185 2020-12-07 22:12:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @DracoVonFaust @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 To use the bully analogy, if a bully spits on you and throws sand in your face and you turn around and walk away without responding, I think most people would have a decreased respect for you. Perhaps that's not fair but, it is very human. It's an ongoing experiment.
1335948600283701249 2020-12-07 22:05:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @DracoVonFaust @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 It's subjective and, furthermore, you couldn't have any data on the effectiveness of something you refuse to attempt. Again, I'm not sure either but, I haven't seen much progress by the tactic of ceding the podium to bullies.

Don't you summarily truncate the conversation by leaving the discussion? How would any bystander get anything from the cessation of intercourse?
1335947862342070272 2020-12-07 22:02:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 Yes, that would be considered "running away." It's totally valid but I'm suggesting there may be an opportunity within that situation if you're willing to throw a few punches. I really don't know but, turning tail feels wrong and leaves the offender encouraged to continue.
1335947336946692099 2020-12-07 22:00:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BillBlake2018 @dogscantwhistle @BruceFo43322941 That is the question. I have yet to establish a conclusive answer yet. Perhaps it's just not knowable. From the evidence I can observe, retreating from hostile actors has not produced any positive results.

Much like bullies, I think holding your ground is perhaps a better stance.

It is always and only defensive. You are establishing a habit of intentionally misrepresenting the opposing viewpoint.

That's what I've been experimenting with. I understand it's not the nice thing to do and I don't enjoy it myself but, I've tried responding to irrational vitriol with peaches and cream. Works about as well as w/bullies.

Continue to include reason but, a hostile opponent is necessarily obstinate so they're not the recipient of the logic. Not above slinging mud for its own sake either.

1335787741498535936 2020-12-07 11:26:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @EckertClint It's not just one group, Patrick Woods has a good understanding of the nature of it. He uses their own term "technocracy" which describes the how deeply ingrained this ideology is in professional spheres. I'm focusing on showing that it's the manifestation of the corporate state.
1335786833314275328 2020-12-07 11:22:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @EckertClint Not just about money though. Making sure you can't compete and/or killing you and your family are very high on the list. Case in point being many if not most major corporations (the state too) actually operate at a loss. Wouldn't be the case if they held profit above ideology.

It sounds plausible because the people doing it are so stupid but, I think that might just be the act.

1335094314590932992 2020-12-05 13:31:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @catturd2 @jihchs Give up on "R" Republicans. 👍  Keep your name, don't volunteer an additional unnecessary interaction with the system.
1335093474140557314 2020-12-05 13:27:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @epigwhisp It's frankly shocking that we have to repeat ourselves.  "In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks.”   https://t.co/FOu7hpzumO

So much of what is on social media is paid propaganda. Occasionally someone will catch an identical tweet from dozens of accounts, all with lots of interactions. That's not an accident, that's the enemy.
1335065673421238275 2020-12-05 11:37:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IllustratedMan9 @ReedLetters I assume they are just paid agents. I've had people come back with, "well it might be true but, it must be good!"

But, if you shut up, pay attention, and start using your brain, most people will never know how easily you were fooled. Stop being humanity's enemy.
1334704083849056257 2020-12-04 11:40:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Where are all the immunology experts to assuage fears about an untested experimental gene therapy about to be delivered en mass?

1334697247246839811 2020-12-04 11:13:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheFutureLover @NOTDumPhuk Yes, I can't prove the latter but, the former can't be ruled out. The fact that any discussion on the subject is dismissed is yet more evidence of programming. It's no accident almost nobody picks fights with me over it and those who do seem to be completely oblivious.
1334695842310131725 2020-12-04 11:07:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheFutureLover @NOTDumPhuk That was my first reaction. I'm considering worst case scenarios. Knowing how contagious adenovirus is, I'm more than a little concerned that the gene therapy itself could be an inescapable infection. If they mean harm or just make a mistake, it could be devastating.
1334692988266672128 2020-12-04 10:56:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BenjaminSHunte1 I thought cruelty would be the winner.

Who knows how much longer these venues will be available but, we must use the time we have left to spread to idea of mass recall so people know what to do, how, and why in case communications are cut off.

Obviously a sheltered life can do that but, it's also part of notions like honor, courage, sacrifice, etc. in the traditional realm of values as with family, etc. A hard persona to maintain sincerely if dissembling.
1334398450792804354 2020-12-03 15:25:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Do you really need any more evidence?  Can you not see that none of this has to do with a bad cold.

I am legitimately shocked that the logical and irrefutable evidence establishing without question what is happening and by whom is met with blank stares. They must be made to snap out of it.

They are preferable to self-doubt and pity. You'll not do anyone any favors, least of all yourself. Trust me, it will get better. Stop thinking about it, start a project.

I think it's pretty clear that he is complicit. Whether he intended to help or not, he hasn't and obviously can't or won't. All Trump supporters should contemplate the implications.
1334120474234773505 2020-12-02 21:01:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This isn't going to solve itself. It's not going to just go away. Failure to stop it, as with any situation when dealing with bullies, emboldens and encourages more and more abuse. This is proceeding according to a carefully prepared plan, not spontaneous tyranny.  Mass recall.

1334014143251222528 2020-12-02 13:58:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TConfectrix Mass recall is a peaceful civil action directly executed at the local level by residents. Attempts to wrest power from sitting officials through legislative action cannot work. We cannot trust any government officials to act in good faith, elected or appointed.

1333948975976763394 2020-12-02 09:39:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TConfectrix Read the thread about mass recall, the idea is towns are still largely staffed by family, friends, and neighbors unlike cities which have mercenary forces. If town staff is willing to commit mass murder of entire families just to keep their jobs, we have an even bigger problem.
1333939899985240064 2020-12-02 09:03:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @tweettruth2me I'm not ashamed to say that I prefer sex.
1333937541989478400 2020-12-02 08:54:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> All of this taken together as a concert of corruption provides ample evidence for a moratorium on government authority. The first steps to rebuilding our civilization will require all officials to step down. If we must enact mass recall locally and work our way up, so be it.
1333936369396289538 2020-12-02 08:49:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Shawn_on_Games The thing is, as I understand it, identifying the specific antigens is a mixed bag. Some aspects make it show false positives and some tend toward not detecting past exposure. All of them simply show current or future immunity, not necessarily contemporaneous infection.
1333935236657393664 2020-12-02 08:45:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Loneprotester lol, no wonder so many can't past a single page of data.

1333934928124407808 2020-12-02 08:44:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The testing procedures are severely flawed showing anywhere from 50% to 90% or more false positives due to a variety of problems such as the incorrect use of rt-pcr as a diagnostic and shared markers with many common infections. Life-threatening sickness is uncommon and unlikely.
1333933881704280070 2020-12-02 08:39:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Pathogen shares much of the genetic code of the latter making positive diagnosis extremely difficult if not impossible. Many are already immune making evidence for the outbreak minimal outside of normal at-risk age groups for flu/cold. Year-to year fatalities appear unchanged.
1333932659123347459 2020-12-02 08:35:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The enemy in this case is not a foreign nation or religion but a pathogen engineered by government and either accidentally or intentionally released into the population by government that is functionally indistinguishable from a bad flu or cold.
1333932469545017347 2020-12-02 08:34:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Totalitarian corporate government across the world has instituted a forced war time economy in which everyone is asked to sacrifice almost all of their liberties and freedom to defeat the malicious enemy which aims at killing everyone and eating granny and the kids, so to speak.
1333925937306619904 2020-12-02 08:08:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TConfectrix I don't think guns are going to play a major part in this. Government is good at only one thing, violence. The idea is to take that option off the table. Armed retaliation for atrocities remains a defensive threat as always but, mass recall is a peaceful civil action.
1333923084227784705 2020-12-02 07:57:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus You're probably right, I should read it. I haven't wanted to actually do it. 😩
1333919562035834880 2020-12-02 07:43:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TConfectrix Because we can't force everyone everywhere to adhere to the same system, a requirement of all totalitarianisms, the only alternative is a decentralized world in which each region decides how they conduct themselves. Areas may choose to have governments of varying forms or not.

I'm not simply regurgitating economic, structural, and philosophical principles in the abstract. I'm calling for a solution to the problem. That solution or the preliminary movement toward each region's solution is mass recall.
1333908218809036806 2020-12-02 06:57:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TConfectrix Yes, and mass recall is the only thing we can do to start fixing this mess.
1333905807478558722 2020-12-02 06:48:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TConfectrix While I'm not arguing the importance of identifying and apprehending any and all of the responsible parties, it is a later action of a rejuvenated free society, not something to start with. 100% reserve banking would be my preference as well but, is that what people need to hear?
1333905097835880452 2020-12-02 06:45:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TConfectrix Central bankers too but, it's important to recognize that local government is the actual enactor and enforcer of these illegal edicts. They are following the orders issued by whoever the nefarious culprits may be. First they must be removed from their positions, then investigate.

1333894580928974860 2020-12-02 06:03:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Older people are the best ambassadors of mass recall so that role is ideal. They are not only the most informed and experienced people in the world but, they are personally within the "at-risk" age group so dispelling hypochondria and cowardice is much less of an obstacle.

If you believe you are surrounded by a town population which will ally with GTCS, perhaps you should move. Not much benefit in having such neighbors.

Any town which never hears about it, fails to gather the required representation, or consciously chooses to ally with the global totalitarian corporativist state will not mass recall.

1333883911504539649 2020-12-02 05:21:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> National governments are subverted and local governments are operating as subordinates in a command hierarchy instead of as representative bodies of their constituencies.  They are no longer valid. Their authorization is illegitimate. Our consent is withdrawn. Hence, mass recall.

1333490302267650050 2020-12-01 03:17:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IAMISjp It's the virus used to synthesize artificial gene therapies. It is very contagious and can survive much longer than most common colds on surfaces. The therapy being called a "vaccine" is based on a synthesized adeno-associated virus.
1333487681037361153 2020-12-01 03:06:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Do you know what adenovirus is?
1333482127091003397 2020-12-01 02:44:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TTDerandere Of course it's impossible but, more importantly, it has no valid medical premise. There are no clinical circumstances in which everyone should be isolated from everyone else. It defeats the point of insulating an at-risk group while the population develops community immunity.

1333469810911563777 2020-12-01 01:55:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Ultimately, no government can stand without popular support and what they're doing cannot actually sustain popular support, it can only suppress dissent for a spell. The psychological manipulation of the ignorant doesn't work forever. It's already violent and observes no limits.

1332530083840602113 2020-11-28 11:41:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon The other point I should make is that the whole idea of asymptomaticity is essentially modeled after typhoid Mary. Typhoid is salmonella typhi, a bacterium. Rare as it was, it was self-replicating. Because of the nature of virus replication, it can't happen asymptomatically.
1332526687444217856 2020-11-28 11:28:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon I have provided two official CDC documents establishing the known science. I have made the best case using pure reason and lack of opposing evidence to denounce the wacko conspiracy theory of asymptomaticity. I can't prove a negative.
1332526103987097600 2020-11-28 11:25:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon Well yeah, if you get a cold and become contagious, you can transmit it for a window of a day or so. I think the window is a few days this. That's not asymptomatic, it's presymptomatic. At any rate, masks don't work against viruses and universal medical isolation is absurd.
1332525244716871680 2020-11-28 11:22:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon The fact that no evidence suggests any particular infection patterns doesn't even allow for the speculation which was all it ever was. I can't prove a negative except through a priori logic and they can't prove their presence even using a posteriori or empirical  evidence.
1332524314135040001 2020-11-28 11:18:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon I don't think you'll find any doctors agreeing with that. It's obviously part of the story that they are pushing for whatever reason. Only contagious people can transmit virus through shedding. That said, someone could cough on their shirt (or a mask) and possibly infect someone.
1332523650147356672 2020-11-28 11:16:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon The idea of asymptomaticity is fear mongering and the only scenario that might be produce long-term shedding without development of symptoms would be in cryogenically suspended tissue. I'm probably not helping with my hyperbole.
1332522993570942977 2020-11-28 11:13:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon The issue is that there is a window of about a day or so where a person who is infected and producing virus but has not yet had a strong enough immune response to suppress shedding can transmit a virus to another person. This condition is called contagiousness or presymptomatic.
1332522015027245057 2020-11-28 11:09:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rapid_rar @ksorbsinnrvoice @BobMurphyEcon If you could somehow not get sick (have no immune response,) eventually every cell in your body would only be manufacturing virus and you would not be alive anymore.

In order for this to happen, you must become sick (i.e. the virus must reach critical mass in your system through replication.)

You may or may not get sick but, you are not contagious if you don't get sick or after being sick.

The presence of some virus via rt-pcr does not indicate "infection" anyway. You have to be sick to be contagious.

If that's your measure, you're in for a big surprise. That was never intended because it's impossible. Idea of two weeks was to alleviate estimated hospital over-usage which never materialized.

Clear by official statements of epidemiologists that almost every mandated policy is in direct conflict to recommended epidemiological procedures.
1332513890991738880 2020-11-28 10:37:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ksorbsinnrvoice @rapid_rar @BobMurphyEcon First, you're presuming everyone is infected. Second, epidemiologically speaking, viral transmission is part of developing community immunity. It's best if virus quantities are low and masks may contribute to aerosolizing virions possibly enhancing the direct respiratory vector.

If it's not a summary of all of valid studies, they are misrepresenting it. Just understand what you are saying though, that science has been completely wrong until this year. Is it that you can't believe that an incorrect belief can become popular?

It's literally a cold, it's endemic now and will be seasonal forever. As viruses become better at transmissibility, they necessarily get less dangerous as the process involved selects for communicability over lethality.

1332473453744693250 2020-11-28 07:56:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy There's a lot to learn about economics to understand just how far down the road we are. We haven't been a free market for a very long time. You must properly steward capital to qualify for that term. Corporations and the state do not properly steward capital.
1332472586400395271 2020-11-28 07:53:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AndywellsWells @charliekaliroy He's asking the right questions. I think he's doing pretty good for someone without a lot of economic background. I think we need to be a little easier on folks who see part of the picture. If we can clarify the major points while doing it, so much the better.
1332471979308421121 2020-11-28 07:50:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Gardy_OW @charliekaliroy Yes, and all with the expressed approval of the state. The government sold the cab companies a license to a monopoly on rides (taxi medallions) so they are simply holding up their end of the evil alliance by criminalizing competition. This could never happen in a free economy.
1332471269867073536 2020-11-28 07:48:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy Both, they are virtually indistinguishable at this point. They have been in league for a long time but, now it's all in the open. The familiar phrases "public-private partnership", "third way", and "sustainable development" are all euphemisms for corporativism.
1332470249808072705 2020-11-28 07:43:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy It's similar to how the state directs policy through proxy corporations. It can also direct political funding through the same mechanism. Makes it look like external influence is at work when it's all serving the same central plan. If someone gets caught, the state replaces them.
1332469659682156547 2020-11-28 07:41:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy We are not a free market economy. I estimate we had about 50% corporativist and 50% individually owned businesses before 'the event.' Now, we are approaching 90% corporativist and climbing. State-sponsored monopolies are common in any modern government and the US is no different.
1332469024207364099 2020-11-28 07:39:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy Yes, they are "statists" and ends justify their means which are always coercive.
1332468628726419459 2020-11-28 07:37:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @WhereIsJGaltNow No, in a free market, you would be responsible for your actions. Though, the threshold for filing suit and making claims would likely be different in a market judicial system.
1332468248462446592 2020-11-28 07:36:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy The familiar revolving door that employs the same agents in corporate and state positions is more of a managerial shuffling than what we might think of traditionally as regulatory capture. Though real, regulatory capture is not what corporativism is.
1332467794840068096 2020-11-28 07:34:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy They don't, it's one entity known as "the corporate state." The general perception is that the corporations manipulate the state but, it's actually the other way around. We all agree that corporations are our enemies so that's good enough for now but, the state directs it all.
1332466067432738822 2020-11-28 07:27:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy "Neoliberals" are roughly equivalent to neoconservatives and are almost entirely corporativist and entirely interventionist. Neither are capitalists.

1332465337925824512 2020-11-28 07:24:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy That's not capitalism. I don't want to get into an economics throw down since we have found agreement on such an important point. Monopolies are not usually even possible in a free economy where new competitors can undercut a greedy market leader. Only interventionism does that.
1332463928434102275 2020-11-28 07:18:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy I specify the nature of the relationship because it's a government form. The state is dominant and all corporate policies are in line with state policies which frequently don't align with corporate interests. The state can direct proxy corporation production to plan the economy.  https://t.co/kS4UOzG0i0
1332462813755924486 2020-11-28 07:14:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy Franky, it's enough to recognize that they are in bed together so to speak. It's central directed. It's a point of agreement that will make a huge difference as we move forward. Decentralization will allow those who wish to experiment with government can do so at smaller scales.

At the time Mises wrote this, he was trying to call out the rigged nature of the word before it became definitional. "Conservatives" in the US prefer the term "social security/safety net."
1332461138571882502 2020-11-28 07:07:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy So, "conservatives" as we probably both mean the term, are definitely socialists. Classical liberals, laissez-faire capitalists, etc. are what/who have been mostly eliminated from both our economies.
1332460640691216392 2020-11-28 07:05:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @charliekaliroy Only change I would point out is that capitalism isn't associated with corporations or corporativism. To the extent that the economy is populated with corporations (from 50% to 90% after event), it is a planned economy with the state directing production through the corporations.

1332426167622701057 2020-11-28 04:48:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BobMurphyEcon Since masks don't work on viruses, as is well established through decades of controlled studies on flu, and have many harmful side effects especially when worn long-term, making someone wear one, particularly if they're not sick, is a clear violation of the NAP, possibly torture.

Now you are trying to spin this as a catastrophic deadly disease outbreak. All of the problems facing civilization at this moment are related to the government's actions, not covid.

They are either legitimate or illegitimate but, letting them run their course is the only reasonable way to diffuse them. Most wouldn't happen absent government and voting was my point.

I suspect many of them were actually admitted for other reasons and not covid. Generally, if you need to be hospitalized with SARS-CoV2, you're in pretty rough shape. Usually happens to people who have other health issues already.

It's really not an either or. It's the myth of government and voting that spawns mobs which are unaware they're hostile entities.

There was a spike in NYC at the beginning but, that was 8 months ago. No hospitals are over capacity, period. The staff have been severely reduced making their workload excessive. There is strain on the hospital system but, it's caused by that and not covid.

1332330801502019584 2020-11-27 22:29:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames It's a trap though as the state can then effectively direct production enacting policies which it wants to achieve towards the end of a planned economy. Socialism through a roundabout way in which the state can simply denounce its corporate agents if they get caught misbehaving.

Not a problem in my book but, since there is a legal construct fabricated to prevent such responsibility, everyone chooses the protection of the state from accountability.

Unspoken function is to unite interests of organization with interests of state. Many think it means aligning state interests with corporate but, it's actually the reverse.

I don't expect anyone to be able to produce a single example of how incorporating has anything to do with the free market.

So, it's not really about the taxes per se but, their harmful effect on production in free society.

A major argument against them is that they foster special treatment. It's typically easier to evade most taxes/interventions as an incumbent or market leader than as an upstart challenger. Taxes themselves represent an obstacle to competition.

That's not what I'm getting at. What we want is for everyone to play by the same rules and not suffer intervention by the state. Should be no need to hide money.
1332300378625421315 2020-11-27 20:28:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I probably don't have to make too much effort to show that corporations aren't business organizations of capitalist enterprise. In case there remains any lingering doubt, imagine all the reasons why a company might incorporate. Are any of those reasons to do with a free market?

Entrepreneurs bear most of the risk as speculators but, when successful, can be highly rewarded. Their activity is what keeps competition fierce. Without them, progress would be nigh impossible.

When correlated with known activity either from network activity, gps, or other data sources, comprehensive model can be built that could ultimately describe emotional state. It's a first step into effective "mind reading."

It will work unless we don't do it and that seems to be a common first reaction. "They're too powerful" is a foolish outlook, they aren't.

There can't be any national or global leader for a decentralization movement anyway by definition. Why it's so important to get the general description of the procedure out to as many people as possible.

I'm just talking about the government offices currently known as "sheriffs" which are nothing more than subordinates in the hostile occupying force. As people, they can help.
1331281149805596674 2020-11-25 00:58:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Vetforpeace1 They are behaving as subordinates in the command hierarchy of the occupying force comprised of the entirety of government which includes them. They are welcome to join mass recall and they could provide a lot of help but, not as government officials.

I assume there will be some such towns. And again, no violence is necessary for that outcome either.

Because the global totalitarian state is bent on controlling all land, resources, and life on the planet, they'll eventually find your progeny and exterminate them. That may be years down the road but, with no resistance, it's assured. Beginning to understand?

Since mass recall requires 500-1000 families to gather to remove all sitting officials from your town hall and other facilities, anyone choosing to oppose their removal would be required to array themselves against it. Cowards would do no such thing.

If we choose not to, we can't really complain when our family, friends, and neighbors fall prey to the totalitarian menace. There's plenty to do, the question is whther we want to stop it or not.
1331186224388845570 2020-11-24 18:41:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you know any government employees or officials, you should advise them to accumulate as much intel as possible on illegal government activity and then resign, especially meeting minutes and budgets. Consult people in your locality to share this information for mass recall.
1331185116081774593 2020-11-24 18:37:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @john1gun Yes, the whole thing and everyone involved is criminal. I have no reason to believe any employees or officials are not participating in the occupation. Sheriffs loyal to their local constituents are welcome assets in the mass recall though, they will have to leave government.
1331183920491212800 2020-11-24 18:32:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Sisko73649846 This is very similar to how the British Empire conquered India. They could not have dominated militarily so they gave sweet deals to the local administrators to subdue their own populations and became part of the empire hierarchy. Unlike then, we can see it, so we can stop it.
1331181371331579909 2020-11-24 18:22:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @john1gun Yeah, that's why I figured I had to specifically call them out. I hear some empty rhetoric but, I know that some states have already instituted rules allowing them to remove anyone who doesn't follow direct orders, whatever they are. That includes elected sheriffs and deputies.
1331169432417292288 2020-11-24 17:34:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We can't trust the sheriffs either. Everyone in government is part of the command hierarchy that is acting as an occupational force to subdue resistance via illegal edicts. They are using our own local clerks and bureaucrats as foot soldiers against us. Everyone needs to wake up.

Decentralization recognizes the unlikelihood of universal agreement and so is amenable to just about any form of local government or lack thereof, it's the only way.
1331143485299322881 2020-11-24 15:51:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Perhaps "governmentism" needs to enter the lexicon to replace "statism." It's probably easier for those who advocate a state to readily admit while simultaneously being more descriptive of the mentality we wish to abolish when used as an opprobrium.

Since they're not useful for the protecting against viruses, it's cruel and sadistic.

The main reason for calling it corporativism is that it is easier for everyone on the left and right to understand why it is nobody's ally. It also prompts curiosity as the Italian form is rarely used.

I don't think of the church as being particularly significant, it's just a really big corporation directed by the state.

There is a problem when governments attempt to pin gold at a particular price or maintain a bimetallic system with a fixed exchange rate. Bad money drives good money out of circulation.

If more gold enters the market, gold is inflated driving the price of goods up. This is countered by the reverse effect of deflation by saving. The two trends produce the balance we refer to as "self-regulation".

"Hoarding" gold is just a derogatory term for saving and it drives circulating currency up in value lowering the price of goods.

Certificates of deposit can then provide loan capital. No reason you can't also have silver (or whatever) certificates.

It's the basic justification for what has happened in the 20th century to hand control of money over to government.

1330670426633236480 2020-11-23 08:32:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby I'm hoping the threat of being made sterile or killed by an errant medical experiment may be the kind of reality check that will get their attention. The trick is getting them to look at the data and listen to expert analysis.

In the context of biopharmaceutical research, "discovery" is the process of irradiating/damaging organic material to see if a useful novel agent can be produced. How is that helping anyone? It's like they're asking for donations to make a new pathogen. 🤨
1330654222799527937 2020-11-23 07:27:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @crwriter1 To illustrate my point, many corporations operate at a loss. It's only explainable by understanding that they're doing the government's bidding and receiving bailouts to compensate so that they don't go under. If corps were in control, they wouldn't lose money, part of the state.
1330652829602770944 2020-11-23 07:22:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @crwriter1 The phenomenon of regulatory capture is real but, that's not what's happening. To the extent that the revolving door moves corporate agents into the state, it's more like managers moving around from department to department. The one place RC is dominant is in banking regulation.
1330652026842345473 2020-11-23 07:19:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @crwriter1 Why corporativism is so deceptive. It's good to see the unholy alliance but, problem is in imagining corporations capturing government. It's really the other way around. Any business the state can't control, it destroys. Regulatory agencies dictate corporate policy as we now see.

1330552969402658817 2020-11-23 00:45:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jboyle8863 @hellothere3332 That would mean that everyone started mugging each other and fighting immediately in April which I find hard to believe. If they were responding to mask violations, that is also not a valid reason for endangering the public by speeding, blowing lights, and distracting drivers.
1330550292178477057 2020-11-23 00:34:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Yes, that seems clear. An additional thought on the previous subject, if police are speeding and using their sirens for mask violations, etc. they're obviously unnecessarily endangering public for no good reason further damning their behavior and overall mindset and credibility.
1330549075704475648 2020-11-23 00:29:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Of course, either way it's bad. I just couldn't imagine a real need to be doing that constantly for the last 8 months other than as a means to psychologically terrorize communities.

You obviously have a lot invested in the idea that they're not avowed enemies of the public. This is incorrect and easily verified.
1330547909608271873 2020-11-23 00:25:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I haven't mentioned it before because it seems somewhat below the radar but, I think that police all over have been told to drive around with their sirens on simply to intimidate the public. I noticed it almost immediately back in April. Vaguely similar to Castro's trucks psyop.

But, you would have make that case. For me, it is simply that they stand between purchasing whatever medication we want without permission. Other than that, they are not anywhere near the threat posed by the others.

We can do this peacefully so long as that remains true. It becomes much more difficult if we allow them to outsource mercenary forces.

1329875196128485377 2020-11-21 03:52:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @edwardstevens16 I picked something I was sure about. The test isn't to see if you can be convinced to change your mind, just to see if you can stomach new information, opinions, and perspectives. I was a bit surprised as I think of myself as pretty open minded.
1329873445031735298 2020-11-21 03:45:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @edwardstevens16 We do it to ourselves too. Back in March I decided the best way to test myself was to pick something I was certain about and read contrary information. I kept track of how many times I stopped, tried to do something else, daydreamed, etc. It was every couple of minutes, lol.
1329871886684184578 2020-11-21 03:39:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @edwardstevens16 Only convincing explanation is programming. I still notice it in myself with some things. The dead giveaway is when you subconsciously stop reading something with new information on a topic you think you've made a decision about. It's powerful but, noticing it is the first step.
1329862301130891266 2020-11-21 03:00:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you know absolutely nothing about epidemiology, virology, immunology, etc. but vehemently oppose people who are sounding the alarm of foul play, you should pause and reflect that perhaps you've been victimized by opinion programmers. Just about everything done so far is wrong.
1329827282056253440 2020-11-21 00:41:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ThomasEWoods @AncoreAggarwal And notice that other people are sending reports to the "watchdogs." Shouldn't watchdogs be watching?

If you cannot write cursive, you cannot read it and almost everything in our history is hand written and not digitized. It was rare to publish a book and have it professionally printed. Purpose is obviously to prevent or severely handicap research.

1329710216980668416 2020-11-20 16:56:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IvanaMariaB @MrLeadslinger I think keeping track of who is employed by government locally is important. Gather budgets and meeting minutes as well so we can have some information to work with when determining who to apprehend and prosecute.
1329709700498280449 2020-11-20 16:54:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Chicago4L Mass recall is the way.
1329582010797608960 2020-11-20 08:27:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Darioggggg @pintoproblem @USlawreview It's symptomatic of cracks in the armor, a good sign. Focus on the most likely first so as to not waste time. You may possibly spawn another mass recall proselytizer which would be ideal.
1329581125765828608 2020-11-20 08:23:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @pintoproblem @USlawreview Ain't that the truth. Teaching them to self-detect programming might help if they can be made to sit still long enough to comprehend the concept and not feel personally accused of anything. I know I rip into people on here but, not in real life. I don't try on truly brainwashed.
1329579093935976449 2020-11-20 08:15:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @pintoproblem @USlawreview If people can be made to see what is really happening I think even communists will agree.
1329578818122735620 2020-11-20 08:14:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dkraft @RareCamellia @CeciliaGlennon Mass recall has to make it out into the real world before communications are made even more difficult or even cut off. Use this time to spread it on social media with the message that it should be talked about locally.
1329578235240341506 2020-11-20 08:12:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @USlawreview @pintoproblem It's simple enough that it can be distilled into a flyer, poster, etc. and explaining it verbally is straight forward. It's logical as long as they see the problem. As things fall apart even more it will get easier. It's a local thing so it has to make it out into the real world.
1329576761370275847 2020-11-20 08:06:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @pintoproblem @USlawreview I have concluded there is just one remedy, peaceful town level civil rebellion. A mass recall of all sitting officials locally followed by recall of county and state officials. Ignoring cities, if done by locals in every town simultaneously, it is the only thing that will work.
1329575626978758658 2020-11-20 08:01:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @USlawreview Not easy but, I think the switch can be flipped.
1329575259964665856 2020-11-20 08:00:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon @RareCamellia Main thing in my mind is that the idea gets out there as far as possible and into local dialog. At some point it will have to jump to real world grass roots communications. Just in case they really do cut off communications, banking, power, etc., it's the most important thing.
1329573838154313728 2020-11-20 07:54:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RareCamellia @CeciliaGlennon Mass recall soon.

1329546722725531648 2020-11-20 06:06:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Whatever happens, we know who did it and why. It's more important than ever to know your neighbors and be prepared. It may be prudent to print up any flyers ahead of time. Explain mass recall, basic instructions, meeting places/times, etc. Establish inter-town communications.

It gets harder the longer we wait but, the other side of that is, the longer we wait the more people will have either woken up and/or learned about mass recall. We can't wait forever and we can't rush. Only thing we can be is certain.

You cannot make peace with psychopaths. They've doubled, tripled, and quadrupled down. We mass recall all officials starting locally or it won't stop.

It's just a question of whether it is achieved through normal exposure or by artificial assistance through vaccination. Mythical, lol.
1329346992246546434 2020-11-19 16:53:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rvjcallanan Good catch, I should probably make a thread on universal medical isolation.
1329341054492012544 2020-11-19 16:29:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ds13_manon It's possible but for the fact that he literally wrote the book on this "stakeholder" construct being touted as the official new world system. I have similar suspicions about Bill Gates, he's so bad at selling the idea it seems like he's being put up to be thrown under the bus.
1329337809568747520 2020-11-19 16:16:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ds13_manon It certainly seems beyond belief. For the moment, there is no reason to believe any of it not real. Especially since the entirety of the plan is already mostly outlined in Agenda 21 and is being openly adopted and supported by all governments worldwide. Mocking but not unserious.

1329305491072278530 2020-11-19 14:08:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @GatzTravis @cantsuicideus That seems like grasping. For one thing, he uses words like "equitable" and "no haves and have-nots." Do you think he is referring to states? You should be erring on the side of accepting statements at face value, not fabricating plausible excuses for their failure to be clear.
1329303152240242688 2020-11-19 13:59:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IAlways420 I'm talking about people who defend universal medical isolation in all its forms as if it were a valid medical procedure.
1329301745969876992 2020-11-19 13:53:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @louPino3 @4TruthMack That's how I've been approaching this. Everybody acknowledges that the executive branch has no jurisdiction in local matters so the bottom up strategy of mass recall won't have any effect on whatever Trump's top down plan for ridding the country of traitors may be. Time to begin.
1329301222071873536 2020-11-19 13:51:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IAlways420 You should be thankful.
1329301118652997633 2020-11-19 13:50:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @GatzTravis @cantsuicideus So, you don't actually have any specific justification for your claim, just that you think it can't really be true?
1329298584659963905 2020-11-19 13:40:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @louPino3 @4TruthMack Honestly, I don't see this type of criticism coming from TDS sufferers. If anything, it's coming from those who would really like to believe that he is not part of this. All of the evidence points to his complicity. He has done nothing to stop it.
1329296934805377026 2020-11-19 13:34:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Is it just me or does every person who vociferously defends all of this seem like a fed and a stupid fed at that?
1329295966432882689 2020-11-19 13:30:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @GatzTravis @cantsuicideus Is it a hoax video?
1329292781374861312 2020-11-19 13:17:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HBiggus Not just the UK, all national governments are subverted and local governments are operating as subordinates in a command hierarchy instead of as representative bodies of their constituencies.  They're no longer valid. They are illegitimate. Consent is withdrawn. Mass recall now.
1329287197330116611 2020-11-19 12:55:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LesserMegadeath @rvjcallanan @smith_graeme Moreover, the precedent set by implementing a completely unjustified and medically unsupported regimen on the whole of society for a pathogen which is no more dangerous than the flu will presumably allow it to be done for the flu and any other nonthreatening infections forever.
1329286477956706304 2020-11-19 12:52:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LesserMegadeath @rvjcallanan @smith_graeme Lockdowns actually prevent the acquisition of herd immunity in the section of the population where you want it developed, the people who are not at mortal risk from the infection. Then there's the destructive side effects of destroying the economy which causes enormous harm.
1329285992801570818 2020-11-19 12:50:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LesserMegadeath @rvjcallanan @smith_graeme The purpose of medical isolation for the 'at-risk' is so that they are shielded from the process of developing herd immunity in the general population which is the ultimate goal of any and all epidemiological procedures. This is true for natural exposure and vaccination regimens.
1329285439904223234 2020-11-19 12:48:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LesserMegadeath @rvjcallanan @smith_graeme Primary problem is that universal medical isolation (and masks, distancing, etc) is not a valid epidemiological procedure. Medical isolation is a tool used to protect the 'at-risk' section of the population, in this case people over 80 or who have compromised immune systems.

1329146947979137027 2020-11-19 03:38:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Fallakin @SharylAttkisson It's a distinct possibility and would explain why masks not only don't work but, in many cases appear to aggravate infection rates. It may just be the reduced immune response prompted by oxygen depravation and problems associated with sterile environments in long term wearers.
1329145263110418432 2020-11-19 03:31:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Fallakin @SharylAttkisson One of the potential problems with masks is that they may actually aerosolize virions making them even more able to penetrate already inadequate mask filtration.

The most astonishing thing I found when I first researched it was that there's not much evidence they actually help even in surgical environments. I don't typically bring that up as it's not really helpful.
1329031299529666560 2020-11-18 19:58:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riseupmelbourne It has to be mass recall, only thing that will work.

1328893531440771075 2020-11-18 10:51:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LetLaughRule I've looked into every (I think) purported catastrophic trend and in each case determined that they were based on unsupported or wholly disproven assumptions. In each case, the cause is said to be human freedom and life and the solution is to eliminate human freedom and life.

Few that are a problem are better handled by property rights as tragedy of the commons is the root of their mismanagement. Corporations are everyone's enemy.
1328772059481206787 2020-11-18 02:48:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LetLaughRule There are many so-called capitalists who don't understand the nature of corporativism either. I had mostly been trying to get them to see the threat before all of this started playing out. Why some still don't see it isn't exactly clear to me. Even leftists seem to cheer them on.

1328766809059823617 2020-11-18 02:27:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LetLaughRule Corporativism has already caused all of the problems to date. I had estimated that we were 50% corporativist before "the event" and we are close to 80 or 90% now that most individuals and small businesses have been bankrupted. Capitalism hasn't been much of a factor for decades.
1328765919972253702 2020-11-18 02:24:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltyMcSaltson Once totalitarianism takes hold, the descent into chaos is inevitable. I think most of us realize that that is the plan. Whatever else happens, they have destroyed the fabric of society. A new civilization will be born of this one way or another, as free people or as slaves.
1328765096378720256 2020-11-18 02:21:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LetLaughRule @Phazmaa8 @JohnWintermute2 I've been warning about corporativism for years, yes. I did not expect the takeover to be this accelerated but, in truth, the timeline indicated by the available materials is behind schedule. Subverting local bureaucracies as thoroughly as they have was also unexpected.
1328763750933999627 2020-11-18 02:15:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LetLaughRule I can't imagine how you came to that conclusion.

1328762607969427459 2020-11-18 02:11:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltyMcSaltson We just don't have enough good data on the actual effect of this yet. The censorship and reserved nature of most people may be concealing a massive groundswell of righteous defiance and will to survive. Many of these twitter totalitarians could actually be bots for all we know.

The logical approach is to stay calm and defend against obvious encroachments on your liberty. Try not to let your imagination run too wild, the psyop side of it is also a factor.
1328760053092986881 2020-11-18 02:00:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience @Timmyti60650909 Whatever democides they may or may not be secretly planning, the overt damage that has been done to civilization is enough to justify their removal. The "vaccine" is a symptom of the larger problem that should be apparent to everyone. Why it isn't is perplexing.

Irreparable damage is being done by the coercive regimens themselves which may be the totality of the plan for all we know. Bad even if it's a placebo.

Rather than attempt to divine the full extent of the plan, I believe removing all sitting officials and stopping the whole thing is our only option. They're going forward and it must be stopped. They aren't debating, nor should we.

However, I do not think that is the intention. My position is that accidents and unexpected side effects should be presumed and anyone suggesting that this experimental solution is "safe" is not being honest.
1328753670012407809 2020-11-18 01:35:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience We can already see the effect that all of this is having on people's psychological stability. I believe it is intended to break down everyone's resistance by bombarding everyone with nonsensical requirements until they just give up questioning the validity of anything.
1328752809475526656 2020-11-18 01:32:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience It's not impossible but the fact that it's being rushed out puts additional weight on the idea that it's something very bad considering the fact that it isn't even necessary in the first place. It seems the mandated procedures and regimens are themselves the behavioral training.
1328751671120441348 2020-11-18 01:27:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience I don't think it's a mind control drug. My research indicates that it is a development of gene therapy and is dangerous no matter what the developer's intentions are. The idea that we would test an experimental therapy of that nature on everyone all at once is beyond idiotic.
1328749367034056705 2020-11-18 01:18:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Liberal education encourages the ingestion of all ideas so as to continuously reevaluate existing conclusions with a constant tide of new perspectives testing presumed assumptions relentlessly.

1328563624626049026 2020-11-17 13:00:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BastiatBloc OK
1328563533873897472 2020-11-17 13:00:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BastiatBloc Yes, an organization that does not make a profit is not a business. You can't be a capitalist enterprise if you don't steward capital constructively.
1328562896629018625 2020-11-17 12:57:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BastiatBloc Do I have to block you or will you shut up? You're just wrong about everything, what I said, the nature of corporativism, what constitutes a business, etc. Do I need to cite additional examples of your misunderstanding?

1328551282320281601 2020-11-17 12:11:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BastiatBloc Soup kitchens for one. They provide both a service and a product and are certainly not businesses. They don't even necessarily receive state subsidy or direction and they are still not a business.
1328550851850481665 2020-11-17 12:09:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BastiatBloc Yes, they receive state-sponsorship, operate at a loss, have their production operating environments directed by the state. They are not enterprises in any sense of the word. Only when defended by the state can they monopolize a sector and maybe later make money. Make sense?
1328550205931786241 2020-11-17 12:07:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BastiatBloc I wouldn't say so. Many organizations that provide a service or product are not businesses. If making a profit is not a qualification to be considered a business then everything is a business. Once monopolized, state-sponsored corporations can eventually produce gains.
1328548411629596674 2020-11-17 11:59:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BastiatBloc They're not businesses really though. Most don't even show a profit. That alone should hint at the nature of the institutions.
1328544719048241153 2020-11-17 11:45:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> A symptom which clearly reveals centralized nature of corporativism is the uncanny ubiquity of corporate policy across the board. Such uniformity would never occur in companies directed by their owners. The synchronization of corporate response to this cold is a shining example.

1328368234819620867 2020-11-17 00:04:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @StahpL Jawoll, Kommandant!  https://t.co/toVMd9a347
1328367893734715397 2020-11-17 00:02:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @666_mage You should probably take the time to investigate it. I've been trying to find out why people are so enthusiastic but, it looks like they just don't believe it is true. All in all, best case scenario considering the alternative.
1328366486373752834 2020-11-16 23:57:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @L0labadazz @Sarah25540235 Yeah, I'm concerned about the faith so many have in him.
1328366101965705218 2020-11-16 23:55:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi @OuT_L0Ud 👍
1328365916967538688 2020-11-16 23:54:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ConsiderThis1 The main indicator for me is his support for the vaccine.
1328365600889036801 2020-11-16 23:53:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CutYourNoseOff @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts Are you still here?
1328365503899979776 2020-11-16 23:53:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OctopusMask Longer than that.
1328365375520727042 2020-11-16 23:52:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Nippinigel Ah, misunderstanding.
1328365030459510786 2020-11-16 23:51:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @L0labadazz @Sarah25540235 All politicians are a danger to freedom.
1328364820945657857 2020-11-16 23:50:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi @OuT_L0Ud That's a common attitude and while I think it's incorrect, it's far more acceptable than to laugh it off as make believe. I understand that most people simply can't believe that governments and corporations would do what they are doing, it's horrific.
1328364367528796165 2020-11-16 23:48:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @schrutedunkles Yes, and not a Biden supporter either, obviously.
1328364175022845953 2020-11-16 23:47:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CutYourNoseOff @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts Your several tweets greatly diminish the believability of that assertion.
1328363908088918017 2020-11-16 23:46:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OctopusMask Excellent, I wish more would out themselves.
1328363697958481924 2020-11-16 23:46:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @schrutedunkles Correct.
1328363538507837440 2020-11-16 23:45:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CutYourNoseOff @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts In the time it took you to respond, you could have looked it up. What do you think it does to your case to admit that you don't know anything about it? 🤔
1328363222664179713 2020-11-16 23:44:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @L0labadazz @Sarah25540235 I'm not actually a Trump supporter.
1328363085430730754 2020-11-16 23:43:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi @OuT_L0Ud It's already happened, the world is virtually a command economy and local governments are enacting and enforcing illegal edicts worldwide. Corporativism explains how and Agenda 21 explains what the ultimate goal is. The Great Reset is the latest euphemism for it.
1328362291876798464 2020-11-16 23:40:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OctopusMask At least you are honest about it. Most totalitarians feign support for freedom, at least rhetorically.
1328361905635942401 2020-11-16 23:38:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HumanityWorst What do think Agenda 21 is?
1328361781341851648 2020-11-16 23:38:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheFutureLover @OuT_L0Ud @Sarah25540235 @iAmMattN I think she might have just posted that wrong or something. 🤷‍♂️
1328361270530207744 2020-11-16 23:36:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ConsiderThis1 I think the left should be against it but, I have seen little evidence so far. As much as I suspect Trump, Biden appears to be even more overtly in favor of it and even repeats the messaging.  https://t.co/jRhunMkOyn
1328360558354198532 2020-11-16 23:33:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Sparklingconse2 What leads you to believe that? 🤔
1328360370122219523 2020-11-16 23:32:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kissames @Troscad_Dbarna @LoriBaggadonuts That's the plan, I thought you said you knew about Agenda 21? 🤔
1328359603999027211 2020-11-16 23:29:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheGenerationME So, basically, you're saying that you won't look into it? Why does this not surprise me?
1328359393461760000 2020-11-16 23:28:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @medzwidsense @OuT_L0Ud @iAmMattN I think you have convincingly disproved that postulate.
1328358995472605184 2020-11-16 23:27:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Magwheels4 I've been warning about corporativism for years but I did not expect things to take such a dramatic turn so soon.
1328358763858898946 2020-11-16 23:26:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @persimbanya Do any of you people actually do any research at all? I'm trying to find out what you like about this and nobody seems to believe that it's even real. 🤦‍♂️
1328358388888121345 2020-11-16 23:24:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OuT_L0Ud @LoriBaggadonuts  https://t.co/DKYiZgvt9L
1328358195828559872 2020-11-16 23:24:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OuT_L0Ud @LoriBaggadonuts Yes, it's based around the adeno-associated virus originating in the field of gene therapy.  https://t.co/us7bEqbXiC
1328357660404690945 2020-11-16 23:22:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheGenerationME I recommend you look into it. Disbelief is a natural response and not a problem so long as you inquire as to the legitimacy of the accusation. If you dismiss it without inspecting it, you merely do the bidding of your enslavers.
1328356865957355522 2020-11-16 23:18:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kissames @Troscad_Dbarna @LoriBaggadonuts Not sure what you mean by conspiracy in this context, that is is secret or that it is true? It is clearly not secret and it clearly is true.
1328354762912374788 2020-11-16 23:10:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @angelaronnette This is actually not far from the truth.
1328354416454414336 2020-11-16 23:09:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OuT_L0Ud @Sarah25540235 @iAmMattN  https://t.co/bNjUAsx6Og

1328352929288515585 2020-11-16 23:03:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @cjeck @Herrminator You should do some research into it. The primary organizational structures to focus on are the UN, WEF, World Bank, etc.
1328352114909777921 2020-11-16 22:59:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Sarah25540235 @iAmMattN I'm a little late to the game and I'm trying but, these people have been lobotomized, lol. It's OK, I knew this would be an uphill battle. Thank you too.👍
1328351525199093763 2020-11-16 22:57:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kissames @Troscad_Dbarna @LoriBaggadonuts OK, I heard about Agenda 21 in the late 90s but didn't even look into back then. I was forced into looking at it only recently once I saw that we had become a command economy. I didn't even know about lockstep.
1328350809944420353 2020-11-16 22:54:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @medzwidsense @PantheisticLass @Christrionics Because the only reason I interact with hostile noobs is to inquire as to the nature of their disagreement with my post. In this case, it is about Agenda 21 and The Great Reset.
1328350322159390720 2020-11-16 22:52:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Phazmaa8 @LetLaughRule @JohnWintermute2 You should actually read that.

1328349832667402240 2020-11-16 22:50:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Nippinigel I though you said something about people living in parks.
1328349681924050946 2020-11-16 22:50:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Static_FX 🤦‍♂️
1328349591801049088 2020-11-16 22:49:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @paigerpenland I am mystified that you think this is more important than the enslavement of the human race by the global totalitarian corporativist state. Why is that?
1328348873266503687 2020-11-16 22:47:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @comrade_bot @PRISCILLA_void I don't, no.
1328348747269632000 2020-11-16 22:46:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Bobdawiseraptor @AdrianN62729285 @JohnWintermute2 You should look into it because that is one of the lesser contested aspects of The Great Reset.
1328348495040966661 2020-11-16 22:45:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @medzwidsense @PantheisticLass @Christrionics If you were well-read on conspiracies and believe Agenda 21 and The Great Reset to be conspiracies, why are you so uninformed about both?
1328348134897053703 2020-11-16 22:44:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @paigerpenland I have not researched that topic very much as I've been focused on epidemiology, virology, and immunology for the last 8 months or so. I would not rule it out though.
1328347246665084930 2020-11-16 22:40:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @medzwidsense @iAmMattN I see, so even without learning about the nature of Agenda 21 and The Great Reset, you feel emboldened to not only deny the threat but be hostile to those who draw attention to it.
1328346628097531905 2020-11-16 22:38:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ST36037719 @itschaboinki lol, she blocked me too
1328346420223553536 2020-11-16 22:37:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @paigerpenland I'm no fan of Trump no. He appears to be cooperating with all of this.
1328346240006955009 2020-11-16 22:36:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @comrade_bot @PRISCILLA_void Are you saying I'm making a religious statement? 🤨
1328346007004975105 2020-11-16 22:35:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KenLaSalle Which word is made up?
1328345909193740296 2020-11-16 22:35:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @medzwidsense @PantheisticLass @Christrionics So, you also refuse to do any research and resort to name calling. Disappointing but, unsurprising. 🙄
1328345550123659264 2020-11-16 22:33:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Troscad_Dbarna @Christrionics I agree, most of my conversations are with people such as yourself. The ones who refuse to even look into anything don't tend to interact in any beneficial way.
1328344870516367363 2020-11-16 22:31:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Nippinigel Making fun of poor people isn't targeting vulnerable people? 🤨
1328344620200288258 2020-11-16 22:30:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @medzwidsense @iAmMattN This is not a relevant argument. I'm not sure exactly what the target of the criticism is either. Are you saying people should or shouldn't use technology?
1328344125331148803 2020-11-16 22:28:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kissames @Troscad_Dbarna @LoriBaggadonuts You should look this up too.
1328344001154588673 2020-11-16 22:27:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @qU2vlylH6VDpBAO @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts I believe so but, my argument began in March with the posit that government either released it or failed to prevent its release. Either is valid cause to revoke responsibility for stewarding such pathogens. Beginning with that conclusion, the state should be drawn down.
1328343415675908097 2020-11-16 22:25:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @medzwidsense @PantheisticLass @Christrionics You would be surprised. There is only one way to find out though, look it up.
1328343131109126144 2020-11-16 22:24:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @qU2vlylH6VDpBAO @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts That's kind of what I was hoping to figure out. So far, they are all just stupid. 😔
1328342824744611840 2020-11-16 22:23:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @paigerpenland If there is some truth to that, do you think it's possible that Agenda 21 and The Great Reset also exist?
1328342262691078144 2020-11-16 22:20:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Herrminator As I've been explaining, only one person has even gone to the trouble of looking any of this up. Most people, like yourself, seem to think pretending it doesn't exist is an adequate debunk. Can you tell me why that is?
1328341859945623553 2020-11-16 22:19:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Troscad_Dbarna @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts Yes, keep going.
1328341747101995009 2020-11-16 22:18:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Static_FX I'm a little mystified by this strategy and you are not alone. Essentially, your argument is that it doesn't exist and if it did it would probably be good. Do you see how vacant that is?
1328341280653533184 2020-11-16 22:16:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Troscad_Dbarna @Christrionics So far, you are the most informed engagement of the lot. Thank you for at least looking up some relevant content. I suggest you continue to investigate the topic some more. 👍
1328340868974194688 2020-11-16 22:15:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @qU2vlylH6VDpBAO @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts Probably but, I'm trying to elicit some explanation as to the attractiveness of the plan. So far, no one seems to believe it even exists. They are all just calling it a wacko conspiracy.
1328340333613244416 2020-11-16 22:13:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @paigerpenland You do realize your above statement essentially confirms the truth of the thing you are denying right?
1328340073021132800 2020-11-16 22:12:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Nippinigel Oh that's good, why does the left always make fun of poor people?

1328338489621041153 2020-11-16 22:05:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PRISCILLA_void Isn't there someone out there who knows what this is and defends it or is everyone content to just deny it as a joke with no investigation at all?
1328337972526190593 2020-11-16 22:03:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @paigerpenland Have you heard of a guy named Jeffrey Epstein? 🙄

1328337522150289409 2020-11-16 22:01:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi I refer you to my former response. This is not a legitimate criticism.
1328337234693599232 2020-11-16 22:00:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TerniValentine This is the most distressing response so far.

1328336390828986370 2020-11-16 21:57:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Christrionics @PantheisticLass I can tell.

1328335103269986304 2020-11-16 21:52:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @paigerpenland Easy lady, that's looking like it's true as well.
1328334693247414273 2020-11-16 21:50:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi So, basically, you know nothing about the subject and refuse to do any research. In what way does that establish your position as more logical, correct, or superior? 🙄

1328333900855341056 2020-11-16 21:47:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lesleyjseymour Another uniformed defender of the destroyers. You really should look into it at least. I am trying to find someone to defend the program, not deny its demonstrable existence.
1328333527457394693 2020-11-16 21:46:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PantheisticLass @Christrionics Occam's razor requires that you examine all the information and your conclusion will be the most obvious one. So, in effect, you are agreeing with me by asserting it. 🙄
1328332904485838850 2020-11-16 21:43:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Static_FX So far, nobody has actually addressed any part of the claims which are merely repeated from the Agenda 21 and Great Reset documentation. If you haven't read any of it, how can you be so sure it's not true? 🤔
1328332484053004288 2020-11-16 21:41:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PantheisticLass @Christrionics I await these discrediting facts and welcome the embarrassment they will surely bring me. I'm not kidding, go look into it and give me your best interpretation that might assuage my concerns.
1328332051267936258 2020-11-16 21:40:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PantheisticLass @Christrionics The data is available for anyone to read. I have made up nothing. The question is, why are you defending something you seem to know nothing about?
1328331796900179968 2020-11-16 21:39:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Christrionics @PantheisticLass It's basically impossible to discuss something which you do not appear to be informed about. If anybody is handwaving, it's you.
1328331449444020230 2020-11-16 21:37:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TerniValentine What set off my alarm in April was the conversion to command economy. No free country does that, certainly not surreptitiously.
1328331144622792704 2020-11-16 21:36:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TerniValentine I am forced to agree and I was unfortunately in your camp for many years dismissing those warnings as overreactions if not contrivances. It appears we were wrong.
1328330724831850496 2020-11-16 21:34:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi That's the guy from the world economic forum btw. I thought you would at least know that much. It's no fun sparring with unarmed combatants.
1328330158558867459 2020-11-16 21:32:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Christrionics @PantheisticLass Well then you should go get the facts and make a fool of me. I would genuinely appreciate it if you could disabuse me of my concerns.
1328329626754670594 2020-11-16 21:30:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PantheisticLass @Christrionics FYI, being ignorant of a thing in no way makes it not real.

1328329242296332288 2020-11-16 21:29:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts So, you think Agenda 21 and the Great Reset aren't real? 🤨

1328327276065402886 2020-11-16 21:21:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Brian_Alford All sitting officials.
1328327126924349442 2020-11-16 21:20:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Christrionics Oh dear, you've been terribly misinformed.
1328326835986444290 2020-11-16 21:19:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TerniValentine I've been trying to prompt some explanation to what about this is so attractive to some people but, so far nobody seems to be aware of the details. Are you informed about the nature of the plan and agree with it or is this just pavlovian ridicule?
1328326193926590466 2020-11-16 21:16:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kissames @LoriBaggadonuts OK, so you don't really know about it. That's probably better than fanaticism to be honest.
1328325769056149504 2020-11-16 21:15:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @itschaboinki I am intrigued by your faith and fervor for this. What exactly do you think is in it for you? 🤔
1328325124525842432 2020-11-16 21:12:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Christrionics Agenda 21, and most of it is restated in the Great Reset documentation. There's actually a lot more specifics that are pretty shocking but, the basic description of the goals are enough to put your hairs on end.
1328324369345622016 2020-11-16 21:09:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi I didn't think you were the religious type.
1328324259131908096 2020-11-16 21:09:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @L0labadazz Probably without knowing it yes. Whereas Biden supporters seem to be the most enthusiastic about it.
1328324027182624768 2020-11-16 21:08:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @itschaboinki I'm sorry you can't read. 😔
1328323862052933633 2020-11-16 21:07:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PigcrackRecords Cheerleaders for this will certainly be of particular interest. 😉
1328323232198500353 2020-11-16 21:05:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @YouGotSpeedKnot You should probably look into it. It's really quite significant.
1328323079810985984 2020-11-16 21:04:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LoriBaggadonuts Wow, I'm definitely triggering the totalitarians with this one more than usual. Must have cut a little too close to the bone. What is your favorite thing about The Great Reset and Agenda 21?
1328322605082955777 2020-11-16 21:02:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @iAmMattN It's kind of embarrassing to see people like yourself so disconnected from reality as to mock existential threat with enthusiasm.🙄
1328322318540677120 2020-11-16 21:01:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Brian_Alford Not if we stop it with mass recall.
1328322171953967105 2020-11-16 21:00:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @inesnesi My guess is that you probably won't be so lucky.
1328321968794382336 2020-11-16 21:00:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PigcrackRecords You think Biden isn't in on this? 🤔  https://t.co/on7ABDc4Wb

I was mostly referring to the fact that the Prussians have been central to centralization. Their influence is pervasive and have always wanted this, even created public schools.

1328316948028022785 2020-11-16 20:40:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The global totalitarian corporativist state in full cooperation with every national and local government on the planet is preparing to take control of all production, all consumption, all land, all animals, all plants, and all human life.  This is Agenda 21, aka The Great Reset.  https://t.co/zQ0NfsWrSD
1328312277452414978 2020-11-16 20:21:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AmeriBellarmine @JohnWintermute2 It's not capitalism, it's corporativism which is literally what the "third way" is. Also known colloquially as "public-private partnership." It is a form of socialism.
1328311723233861632 2020-11-16 20:19:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LetLaughRule @JohnWintermute2 It's not capitalism, it's corporativism. It's a type of centrally planned economy and a variation of socialism. It's has its roots in fascism, syndicalism and guild socialism.  https://t.co/vIHC9dpgYV
1328311099083665411 2020-11-16 20:16:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JohnWintermute2 Yes. Technically, it's the global totalitarian corporativist state but the important thing is to recognize the criminals and identify the crime. Call it communism, bolshevism, fascism, nwo, etc. It's real and it's the greatest threat to humanity in our lifetime, perhaps ever.
1328298195663921153 2020-11-16 19:25:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BILDERBERG_GP @mmjblair @MoragHamilton12 Hope or even confidence is one thing, absence of skepticism or lack of concern is another. Clever indeed.
1328260514636574720 2020-11-16 16:55:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @alijillTN Yup, while I tend to agree that the practical application of communes would be as unworkable as larger constructs, it's just a logical argument and not a belief system. The only hostility I feel is toward those who intend to forbid voluntary individual trade and compel community.
1328259374872219648 2020-11-16 16:51:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @synapse2000 @ZuluMediaCell Wake up please.
1328258219161096193 2020-11-16 16:46:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @alijillTN I agree, it shouldn't be a problem. It generally indicates ideology rather than rational posits. When I first came on twitter we used to agree that elimination of government is in the interests of any and all anarchists. Communes could exist, problem is in what they would trade.

My goal pretty much from the beginning has been to spread the idea of mass recall. All of this is a distraction from that end. Should have been cleared up by now tbh. 😔

To expect anything else from them is a mistake, especially since it is acknowledged that not many good ones actually exist.

I think that fact is as important to disseminate as mass recall itself. They must understand that it won't help them, only worsen their situation once they are apprehended.

Once everyone is talking about it, it becomes much more likely. I think a measure of its success will be any attempts to suppress the discussion. It's simple and peaceful. Officials cannot commit atrocities because it won't work.

Mass recall is about gathering whole families to remove sitting officials peacefully. Guns serve only as an implied threat of retaliation against any atrocities committed by local government officials.

It would be very difficult to get an accurate assessment of the actual danger considering the rampant politicization of it. The key point is that the it is a cold and the at-risk group is identical to flu.

1327091334981836801 2020-11-13 11:30:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This is fascinating for anyone interested in human consciousness.

1327073532799569922 2020-11-13 10:19:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Since incoming likes are also frequently hidden from me, I may sometimes presume disagreement in certain contexts. This is simply a throwback to when interactions were being recorded reliably that I haven't yet gotten out of the habit of, my apologies.
1327073015121719296 2020-11-13 10:17:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> As far as twitter interactions go, since twitter doesn't record most likes I've been going through the laborious process of opening tweets to confirm but this is becoming tedious. I mean to like all interactions as a "message received" marker, just assume I read it from now on.
1327070635563036672 2020-11-13 10:07:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @1Marchella I think you should discover for yourself what peaceful town level civil rebellion is. It sounds like you are directing your interpretations at me instead of the idea. I can't personally do this myself, nor can you. If you are angry at me because of that, I'm not sure what to say.
1327069845813407745 2020-11-13 10:04:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @1Marchella I obviously haven't made much of an impact since almost no one seems to know what even it is after 6 months of this.  https://t.co/2I6l0V6h3h
1327068810646532096 2020-11-13 10:00:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @1Marchella This is certainly true as a disseminator of information but, in this case, mass recall does have the requirement of simultaneity. It would not be useful to conduct a mass recall in only one or a few places. That would simply provide a target to make an example of.
1327053829108592640 2020-11-13 09:01:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The concept of mass recall is simple. It will come down to distributing flyers, making signs and posters, and word of mouth in your town. There can and should be no national or global leader in a decentralization movement by definition. Accept no such leader, organize locally.
1327052899227090944 2020-11-13 08:57:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TTDerandere Clearly not.
1327051157873758208 2020-11-13 08:50:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm committed to my attempts to propose the only corrective action I view as feasible. I've been going for the better part of a year and intend to continue. If I disappear, it will be necessary for others to spread the concept. I had been hoping that would have happened already.

I am constantly surprised that those who recognize the psychopathic nature of government nonetheless appear to discount this obvious solution despite indisputable historical evidence for its applicability.
1327047411819286528 2020-11-13 08:35:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TTDerandere Mass recall is peaceful town level civil rebellion. Gather 500-1000 families and remove all sitting officials in your town. From there, ask the county and state officials to step down. Needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but, it's the only thing that will work.
1327045267397484545 2020-11-13 08:27:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The creeps keep creeping. Whether it's because of classical propaganda, media interaction manipulation, chemical intervention, or mental retardation, it doesn't appear that people will become aware of the threat before effective counteraction is impossible.  Focus on mass recall.

They are told they have to put on a mask and lockdown so, they do it. Told to take a shot, they do it. Told to hand their children over to the state, they do it. How could that not be considered consent?

1326455809866391552 2020-11-11 17:24:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HegKong Social distancing is intended to limit local in-person interaction. Banning gatherings being the most effective.

1326445520785715201 2020-11-11 16:43:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder The main tangible arguments against it are that the disease is less dangerous than the flu and is only deadly to the same at-risk population in danger from colds and flus. It is a coronavirus in the cold family. There has long been a saying in medicine regarding the common cold.
1326444380786487297 2020-11-11 16:39:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder It could also be a gradual process or simply a lowering of fertility. If it's decided that a lower fertility rate is desirable and it is performed, what if it is misapplied or the parameters underestimated. It is possible to cause catastrophic damage by accident.
1326442828591980544 2020-11-11 16:33:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder Correct, it could take time for the change to propagate so some births would happen. It's more likely that it would only affect certain gene groups. Once the change is in place, it is permanent and, if fertility is retained, heritable.
1326441250921328640 2020-11-11 16:26:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder And now imagine that it is entirely possible that the side effect is sterility and will not measurably manifest for years but be permanent and heritable.
1326440373271539712 2020-11-11 16:23:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder So, imagine someone poisoned a large quantity of them and people died. That's the insinuation I was going for but, the analogy would work with anything. Maybe canned oysters?
1326439214997786624 2020-11-11 16:18:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder Yes, same thing.
1326438679301255168 2020-11-11 16:16:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder A commercial pain reliever. It's the brand name for acetaminophen. I chose it because there was a mass poisoning event in the 80s.
1326437901186572288 2020-11-11 16:13:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder I used a simple analogy for this. Let's say a single batch of 8 billion tylenol is produced all at once in a single facility and given out to every person on the planet. Would it be advisable for everyone take it at once?

Wheel has to be spun up by injecting energy, magnets arranged perfectly, moving just right could keep it spinning until resistance was applied stopping the system absent energy injection. Low loss not free energy.

They push back against opposing fields so you would have to move the magnets introducing energy. Extracting electricity would involve reversing that process putting resistance on the system.

Once spun, the wheel would spin indefinitely. It is a kinetic energy storage device, not a generator as such. This is essentially what a flywheel is.

1326123320631234560 2020-11-10 19:23:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @arnarchivore @FatEmperor Just means that the section of code necessary to produce the spike protein is delivered by the adeno-associated synthesized virus into the host cell. So it's the "vaccine" that allows host cells to manufacture SARS-CoV2 virus directly. In this case, only the spike protein part.
1326114280710746112 2020-11-10 18:47:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @arnarchivore @FatEmperor The "vaccine" is actually a development of gene therapy. Ideally, the host is infected with a synthetic virus that instructs host cells to produce a component protein of the targeted pathogen triggering immune response. Could produce whatever payload the synthetic virus contains.

However, he seems to be concluding that sound money is bad and state controlled fiat money is the panacea, not so.

He also correctly points to the overspending of the government resulting in debt and consequent debilitating interest payments.

1326005059570851841 2020-11-10 11:33:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @yankee_bailey Mass recall is peaceful town level civil rebellion as detailed earlier. It is the renouncement of consent. If you wish to join the totalitarians and your town agrees, you would simply fall into the same category as cities which we know are already lost.
1326004156163903488 2020-11-10 11:30:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @yankee_bailey A mass recall could be conducted through the legislature but, we have no confidence in the legislators acting in good faith so it will have to be a local recall. It remains an option if people want to simultaneously pursue that avenue. I see no reason to suspect that could work.
1326003357505425413 2020-11-10 11:26:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @yankee_bailey Remove all sitting officials. They are all guilty of enforcing unconstitutional edicts at the very least. No other recourse allows the alleviation of the tyranny. If you decide to consent to the global totalitarian corporativist state as a town and you all agree, you can do that.
1326001793197813768 2020-11-10 11:20:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @yankee_bailey Peaceful town level civil rebellion. Gather 500-1000 families in your home town and remove all sitting officials from office. From there ask county and state officials to step down. It needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but, it's the only thing that will work.

1325988849110093824 2020-11-10 10:29:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I won't be surprised if they catch the widespread election fraud. No top-level operatives will be apprehended nor could we trust them be properly prosecuted anyway. It's distractions like this that delay mass recall by providing interesting enough theatre to maintain ambiguity.

1325987170675531776 2020-11-10 10:22:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @strawberrycough They are enacting "second lockdown" as we speak in the UK. People need to realize that this is not merely a US phenomenon.
1325986734648266752 2020-11-10 10:20:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In case you need another reason in the long list of reasons why consent is already withdrawn, they can't/won't even conduct legitimate elections. I usually don't bother making the point as it's superfluous but, it may be a factor for those who still had faith, however misplaced.
1325984657054322690 2020-11-10 10:12:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's actually very encouraging that so many of us borderline poor folk actually did have enough savings to get through the worst of it. If we keep waiting, they'll suffocate all of us.

They'll use the former riot as universal justification for universal curfews. Once military becomes officially involved with vaccine distribution and the like, it becomes slightly more complicated.

People are starting to demand authoritarian crackdowns thus bolstering the existing effect. I believe it to be coordinated. Local officials are literally enacting and enforcing the edicts of the global totalitarian corporate state. It cannot be overlooked.

I identified it as part of the plan to destroy food infrastructure pretty early on. It was a major factor in convincing me way back in April.

1325934582101925889 2020-11-10 06:53:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OnlyRealLeftist Only controlled studies are useful because they provide an objective comparison which accounts for transmission of virions nasally and orally. Meaning that transmission was not significantly changed in either scenarion debunking "droplets" concept. They may actually exacerbate.
1325933160312565760 2020-11-10 06:47:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OnlyRealLeftist Important thing is to realize that the body evidence available at the time of the issuing of the order for mask mandates was conclusive. This has not been about protecting anyone. For one thing, if they worked, why wait through the spike, deploy police to interact without them?
1325931588430028804 2020-11-10 06:41:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OnlyRealLeftist Cloth masks aren't even in the running as effective PPE. You should look into what the proper procedure is for N95 surgical masks too. They're supposed to be fitted and only work for an hour or two, replaced if wet, etc. As it turns out, viruses just aren't affected.

It's a little unusual for someone to be aware of late stage indicators without any knowledge of their origins. It's a good sign if you're young. Just start reading about Rockefeller.
1325697405640126465 2020-11-09 15:11:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Pleaseh32324321 I hear you. I think ultimately this will have to be in the form of signs, posters, and flyers. It's less confrontational and allows them absorb the idea even if they initially dismiss it. It's simple enough to understand and will gain momentum as it enters into public discussion.

It's the natural process for working out the parameters of reality. In contrast, the more rational and demonstrably scientific an argument is the less possible it is to refute and, thus, the more enraging to to lockdowners.

More importantly, it doesn't matter since he can't influence local official policy as I have been reassured. Therefore, only mass recall will lift us out of tyranny. Can you see that he's not a factor?
1325524180159393793 2020-11-09 03:42:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @jetx86 Trump is discredited as far as I can tell, I understand that it's going to take time for his supporters to accept that. I see no action he could take that would restore confidence. Mind you, I'm considering his 4 years as the evidence, not just this last year.
1325523679485304834 2020-11-09 03:40:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @jetx86 Yes, I think you need to simply forget about party affiliation for everything. It's easier to make the connections if you don't preclude obvious cooperation.
1325523116584546308 2020-11-09 03:38:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @jetx86 What I remember from lockstep was that Nigeria succeeds in toppling its government providing justification for more aggressive external population control. The implication is that the world government will begin directing military forces from different nations against each other.
1325521111979855875 2020-11-09 03:30:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @jetx86 But, even that is happening in other countries such as Spain and elsewhere right now. It's part of what is referred to in the lockstep document as "pushback."
1325520772983611392 2020-11-09 03:29:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @jetx86 However, my comment is mostly regarding the US as far as instituting a federal police force due to contrived "riots" engineered by pro-state forces.

1325306774614896640 2020-11-08 13:18:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RonLHelton @cyaistheword Secession to the 50 states and dissolution of the federal government would be a reasonable course. I do not think a binary split would physically possible or desirable.

1325304778713423872 2020-11-08 13:10:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RonLHelton @cyaistheword Civil war is not a viable option. There are no clear borders to establish and any binary division would only result in two warring states. The only secession arrangement short of town level would be restoration of the 50 states and dissolution of the federal government.
1325304131431641088 2020-11-08 13:08:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @l29923941 @jetx86 I do not believe that there is any level of government which has as its operating goals or parameters, the best interests of the american people. Not the towns, counties, states or federal government. I have seen no evidence of it and do not expect to see any. This is theatre.
1325303449660121088 2020-11-08 13:05:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RonLHelton @cyaistheword Many US cities have already signed agreements with the UN. It's unclear whether such agreements would be valid but, that's not really a concern for the GTCS. If simply given orders our military probably would execute american citizens. We need peaceful town level civil rebellion.
1325300358307049472 2020-11-08 12:53:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @metwying I guess I have to restate my basic premise. I believe that there is a global totalitarian corporativist state which is currently occupying the entire world, has implemented a command economy, and is using local bureaucracies to enact and enforce its edicts.
1325299694424240132 2020-11-08 12:50:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @l29923941 @cyaistheword Given that Trump has no jurisdiction over local governments, as is universally recognized, it is up to us to remove the tyrannical elements of our own local bureaucracies. Mass recall is our only recourse regardless of the existing regime in Washington.
1325298935825649664 2020-11-08 12:47:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @metwying Meaning that we know that Trump is not in control of local or state governments and if Trump supporters can temporarily imagine that he is not in control of the federal government either, perceiving the connection of all of these events is plain to see.
1325296735263068161 2020-11-08 12:38:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @metwying I believe the organized nature of the deployments of both "rioters" and police indicate extensive coordination. The conclusion must be that they receive orders from the same or allied command hierarchies. I think if people can remove Trump from their assessment, they must agree.
1325291905152921600 2020-11-08 12:19:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jetx86 For months, yes. They were used to justify curfews and a bunch of restrictions. The defund aspect is clearly designed to bring forth a national police force. It's as if people think a riot didn't happen once it stops. These events are integral to totalitarian justifications.
1325291229861584896 2020-11-08 12:17:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @cyaistheword Yup, I don't understand why this is so difficult to get through to people.
1325290072581828608 2020-11-08 12:12:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I can't be the only person who understands that all of this "unrest" serves the purposes of the totalitarians. Riots, etc justify federal police. Voting irregularities provide an excuse for UN intervention. The list goes on, Trump did nothing to stop any of it, he can't or won't.

Straight out of the totalitarian playbook, could only be missed by those unaware of the historical precedent.

1325263205455851521 2020-11-08 10:25:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby Peaceful town level civil rebellion. Gather 500-1000 families in your home town and remove all sitting officials from office. From there ask county and state officials to step down. It needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but, it's the only thing that will work.

It doesn't matter with respect to mass recall. It has already been widely recognized that he can't do anything about local tyranny. Are we in agreement so far?
1325260616072892416 2020-11-08 10:15:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby 4 years dude. If that was his plan, he failed.
1325259822045007881 2020-11-08 10:12:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby Yes, I've been following it. The reason is say that it is irrelevant is because mass recall is local and is necessary whomever controls the federal government. It's at least a possibility that it isn't Trump or else, why hasn't he fixed anything? Trump couldn't or didn't help.

It isn't bitcoin or blockchain that is attempting to enslave the world, it is the corporativist state. Trade things or time as you like, the market isn't the problem.

I get really beat down by the censorship and stats culling so the modest numbers shown are certainly not representative of their viewership. Most people don't know that the likes frequently don't take so the numbers are likely much higher than 1%.

At least not in the sense that an ordinary person getting caught doing a crime does. This is why it's time to decentralize. You can't maintain a society with these levels of obvious double-standards.

1324802470296588289 2020-11-07 03:54:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TimeTrench22 That was another very good example of corporativism. Just viewing it as a transaction, no individual would have been allowed to make a speculative military purchase indicating special rules. It was a capital investment private parties might have made, I'm sure they sold them off.

Though really, it's probably better that you're laughing at someone who died from a syndrome that you are afraid of.

You would think them crazy and possibly abusive to their children. For those who may metaphorically view the government as paternal or maternal, what they're doing would be child abuse.

It's a massive social engineering effort that seems to be working. Even if the numbers you claim are dead, still not worth all this. It's basically no symptoms to a bad flu.   https://t.co/cFMMTGrtrR

Reverting to 50 states is probably best interim answer assuming we get that choice. Otherwise, mass recall is the only way to get the ball rolling. No binary split will work.
1324527628536131586 2020-11-06 09:42:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel @cappymar I think the only viable secession would be restoration of the 50 states and dissolution of the federal government. I'm tempted to elaborate but, with that initial requirement, it should just be known that it will be complicated.

1324119628558307328 2020-11-05 06:41:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames That's basically it but there are a few key differences. Unions are a significant part of corporativism for example and much of the political control exerted on employees is done through this mechanism. More control over their political/cultural voice than popular media actually.
1324118535304585216 2020-11-05 06:37:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @spamandjelly This is true. That's the accelerationist collapsitarian outlook. Who's to say it won't make a crucial difference in response time? 🤔

1324113328046825472 2020-11-05 06:16:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ChanceColemanTV @Sunnysidebot Old Marantz, Onkyo, Yamaha, Panasonic, Pioneer, etc. Probably not stupid high end though, too expensive. Put money in solid silver core cables if you really want good sound. Speakers are all over the place, I use them for compositional reference so I have NS-10s, a bit colored.🔊
1324110968117493763 2020-11-05 06:07:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SarahConnor39 Completely expected. They've been targeting food infrastructure from the beginning. Distribution and processing in particular as it causes disruptions up and down stream and since consolidation has already occurred in most cases, it can hinder supply while bankrupting businesses.
1324108503510884352 2020-11-05 05:57:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Yes, it's a point of agreement if everyone can recognize first the enemy and then the nature of the enemy. If neither communists nor capitalists acknowledge that corporativism isn't capitalist and is a government form, they will not understand the problem. It seems both court it.
1324102836360302595 2020-11-05 05:34:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Very similar in many ways, yes.

1324071812070821895 2020-11-05 03:31:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 It's not that simple and we don't want that anyway. If you are intent on board game approximations, think about 50 states seceding peacefully which is a viable option.
1324071213099077633 2020-11-05 03:29:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @o_rips We know about it now though so making sure as many people know about as possible is pretty high up on the list of things to do. At this point, it would be a declaration of war against humanity. Really, it already has been but, that's probably a bridge too far. Let's hope anyway.
1324070370832515077 2020-11-05 03:25:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 That there are clear geographical divisions between ideological adherents.

1324069053187690498 2020-11-05 03:20:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 It's just not true and, again, serves the purposes of the global totalitarian state for what is likely the last bastion (albeit severely handicapped) of some desire for freedom in the world to commit societal suicide. Even the commies don't want that if they can't win in the end.
1324066603030425604 2020-11-05 03:10:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Civil war is not a viable option for a variety of reasons. For one thing, there isn't any clear geographical boundary to establish between warring factions. It would be everyone kills everyone hoping that only those of one side will remain which serves the purposes of the GTCS.
1324065382798381057 2020-11-05 03:06:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RoxboroughAKM That's why I say cities are not included. They are already staffed by mercenary forces which are not connected to the local population. Whereas in towns, most employees are family, neighbors, and friends making the recall much more likely to be completely peaceful.
1324064667942195202 2020-11-05 03:03:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 That's how most people view it and that's a fine enough superficial analysis. It's better for people to understand it's not corporations dictating policy to the state but vice versa. By directing corporations, the state can direct production while evading constitutional limits.
1324063224430551040 2020-11-05 02:57:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RoxboroughAKM I encourage as much discussion about the caveats and features, benefits and risks of all of our options. According to my own extensive analysis, only mass recall will work but, it has a handful of necessary preconditions.
1324062503131906049 2020-11-05 02:54:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RoxboroughAKM Since we are aware of that strategy already, it would be obvious who did it making their position even less defensible, no justification. General idea is that no government could realistically claim consent of the governed while all of its towns are in open but orderly revolt.
1324061992588627968 2020-11-05 02:52:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RoxboroughAKM It doesn't have to be. If the central government decides to declare open war on the entire US population, I don't think that's going to work out well. For one thing, there really isn't any practical way to kill every person in the country except by releasing a virulent pathogen.
1324061580523352070 2020-11-05 02:50:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SThinksalot @ForestMommy I love Scotland. 😍
1324060160411787278 2020-11-05 02:45:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 It's certainly an acceptable term, Mussolini approved of it but, corporativism is more descriptive. It is a planned economy and as such it is a variant of socialism as well as having roots in syndicalism and guild socialism.
1324056932286713858 2020-11-05 02:32:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel They've been doing that for years to everybody as far as I know. You only get notified if it is directly connected to an interaction I think.
1324051730628227081 2020-11-05 02:11:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Macman_23 Many are familiar with secession and think of it as a battle to secure independence. There are no clear lines by which such a territorial secession could occur except back to the original 50 states. Not opposed to considering such a solution but, that's not civil war or even war.
1324049847301885952 2020-11-05 02:04:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @spamandjelly Even if that were possible, what is certainly impossible is for it to happen to everyone everywhere all at once. Therefore, decentralization is the only way to allow local control.
1324047407538122753 2020-11-05 01:54:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @spamandjelly Winner-take-all hasn't really ever been an attainable goal.
1324047107414761478 2020-11-05 01:53:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It is certainly the megacorporations which display the most obvious features of state policy arms and production control, effectively managing whole sectors of economy. But, it's not that hard to imagine how this regulatory construct can affect even the smallest corporations.
1324046094419087361 2020-11-05 01:49:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Many people work for corporativist organs of state from megacorporations to small incorporated companies. While I do recognize that small companies who incorporate aren't yet fully included in the model, they will be if they grow. What benefit to incorporation as compared to DBA?
1324041033521549313 2020-11-05 01:29:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rangermonk1 Precisely. All the more important that people know about mass recall so that frustrations don't result in pointless conflict which can achieve no desirable result.
1324040498085011457 2020-11-05 01:27:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @breeder_steve If you mean decentralization, yes. CoDominium, so-to-speak is only another way to present the 'third way.'
1324039790547914753 2020-11-05 01:24:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Communists need to understand that it's not communism and capitalists need to understand that it's not capitalism. Corporativism is a planned economy with all of the worst features of every totalitarian ideology mixed up in a bucket and shoved down your throat, nothing redeeming.
1324038065539682306 2020-11-05 01:17:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Talk of civil war is by those who either represent nefarious purposes or are unaware of the possibility of decentralization. No good can come from people fighting each other. Challenge is to get everyone to recognize global totalitarian corporativist state is the enemy of us all.

1324030425623384067 2020-11-05 00:47:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 The basic message is to stop this global totalitarian corporatavist state. Only expected result is decentralized towns with many differing polities, each with systems chosen by their local populations. This part needs improvement/localized messaging but, those are the basics.
1324029651749134338 2020-11-05 00:44:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Practically speaking, I think a decentralized word-of-mouth network will have to be the mechanism by which we determine timing. As towns around yours agree, you pass their known confirmations of neighboring towns along with your status. Lists will vary until reaching consensus.
1324027985087897612 2020-11-05 00:37:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It won't be constructive if it happens in only some places. That provides a single target to make an example of. It has to be in every town, or almost every one (ignoring cities.) I don't think the central government will declare open war on the entire population of the US.
1324027266297483264 2020-11-05 00:34:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I do not think this can happen in only some places. That provides a single target to make an example of.

1324026263481294850 2020-11-05 00:30:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 All of the above. I can't think of a bad way or time to mention it.
1324026005535772676 2020-11-05 00:29:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BIG215FLY That's what I think has to happen. It's a simple idea that is easily communicated. There can't be a leader for a variety of reasons, the primary one being that nobody can agree on anything but putting a stop to whatever it is that we're becoming.
1324025441557032960 2020-11-05 00:27:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @gabeh730 Maybe people will read more too but, that's kind of irrelevant to the issue at hand.
1324024527614058500 2020-11-05 00:23:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @gabeh730 Whatever happens, the illusion of consent or representation will be completely erased thus providing the opportunity for those unimaginative few to make a choice which they thought they could avoid.
1324024142702759941 2020-11-05 00:22:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @gabeh730 I think getting mass recall into the public sphere of conversation will force many hands. It will either compel the relaxation of restrictions, temporarily alleviating some of the hardship imposed on everyone, or require truly totalitarian crackdowns of any mention of liberty.
1324023292945190914 2020-11-05 00:18:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BIG215FLY This is a decentralization movement. There are no ideological goals except to reduce political power to the smallest possible geographic areas in order to contain the influence of any particular polities. There are no leaders. Towns will decide how to proceed once liberated.
1324022613535002626 2020-11-05 00:16:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BIG215FLY This has been proceeding unencumbered for decades. Trump did nothing as far as I can tell to stem the tide. He has been supporting every policy either by deferring to local authority or overtly agreeing with stated policy goals. This process is not affected by election results.
1324021263933853697 2020-11-05 00:10:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> What makes this a viable possibility even though many voters have participated in the destruction of the country is that they, for the most part, were expecting communism to take over. Once they realize that it is global totalitarian corporativism, they should be on board.
1324020629876727808 2020-11-05 00:08:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BIG215FLY All we really need is some number of people in each town who can put up flyers and arrange whatever methods of communication are convenient for letting everyone know what exactly the choice is and what exactly the plan is. It can be done with or without digital communications.
1324019226785521667 2020-11-05 00:02:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CoyoteMyp Then we choose global totalitarian corporativism forever and that's OK because we had a known option which we consciously chose not to do. This is why spreading the idea is so important. No one can complain once they know and refuse.
1324018846240571400 2020-11-05 00:01:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Main feature is that it would settle the issue once and for all. Mass recall can't happen if people in your town don't want it. If people in your town choose not to do it, that's absolute consent for the acceptance of the dominance of global totalitarian corporativism forever.
1324017902740246534 2020-11-04 23:57:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CoyoteMyp And that's OK because it would settle the issue once and for all. Mass recall can't happen if people in your town don't want it. If people in your town opt not to do it, it is conclusive consent for the acceptance of the dominance of global totalitarian corporativism forever.
1324017382541721601 2020-11-04 23:55:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rangermonk1 It's local so there should not be any leaders or coordination proper except timing. If the residents of your town don't want it, it won't happen.  The beauty is that it actually means that failure to do it, if people are aware of it, is categorical consent for global government.
1324016648400130048 2020-11-04 23:52:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @treadonthem1 The law means nothing. It either works against us or is ignored. This much should be apparent to any superficial observer.
1324016320346816513 2020-11-04 23:51:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IAlways420 I submit that this country has been lost for some time. freeing ourselves from the delusion that any of it is worth defending is paramount in moving forward and rebuilding our civilization which is very much still viable without this mutant monkey on our backs dragging us down.
1324015627749806082 2020-11-04 23:48:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Peaceful town level civil rebellion is the only option available to us. Mass recall all sitting officials in your town, from there we ask county and state officials to step down. Needs to be by local residents in each town and simultaneously. I have not surmised any other path.
1324014588241870849 2020-11-04 23:44:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The outcome is inevitable. The question's simply whether we want to allow this plan to come to fruition by the complete and final assimilation of america into the global totalitarian corporativist state or attempt to reassert our individual freedom. The window is quickly closing.
1324013548129996806 2020-11-04 23:40:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It seems obvious to me that the voters, politicians and bureaucrats have been eager to steer this ship of state into the iceberg. The deliberate whittling away of independents and sponsorship of dependents à la the well-known Cloward–Piven strategy has been thoroughly effective.
1324011715734966273 2020-11-04 23:32:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TsvMinarchy Irrespective of the outcome of the election, does anyone believe this country could possibly survive for another 4 years?
1324010279429169155 2020-11-04 23:27:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If Trump lost, what exactly changes? Does mass recall, the only solution to achieving liberty, seem more or less attractive? If Dems won't do it under Trump and Reps won't do it under Biden, is this vicious circle supposed to continue perpetually?  Does anyone want to be free? 🤨

1323700382628007937 2020-11-04 02:55:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AngelaTC Moreover, if I remember correctly, you asserted that the government can tell anyone what to produce. This makes it difficult to even begin to take you seriously.
1323698583904935937 2020-11-04 02:48:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AngelaTC You're defending rights of corporate entities instead of listening to what I'm saying. I have to assume you've not looked at anything on the subject or are intentionally trying to waste my time. You clearly don't view corporativism as a form of socialism much less as a threat.

1323686089001967616 2020-11-04 01:58:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AngelaTC OK
1323683922803331073 2020-11-04 01:50:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Nelson67 @metwying I've found some similar terms like "dark state" a bit earlier as well but, nothing going back to 2000 except the Turkish ref. Btw, I've added to the thread a bit. Forgot to respond to you directly.
1323682001187229696 2020-11-04 01:42:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AngelaTC Typically limits on prosecution for damage among other things. The personal property of officers can't be targeted for confiscation, etc. But, those are the somewhat insignificant features of the special status. The main feature is that the government can direct production.
1323679198175727618 2020-11-04 01:31:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AngelaTC It's very common for people to believe it to be merely a legal construct for limited liability. While it is that and that alone is anti-capitalist since it establishes special rules for the corporate entity not afforded market actors, it is also the basis for a planned economy.
1323678104066367490 2020-11-04 01:27:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Reason is that I've been visiting old conspiracy theories to let off steam and the John Titor story is always fun.

1323672437477773312 2020-11-04 01:04:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Nelson67 @metwying Yes, I knew it was a 19th century concept but, it wasn't referred to by that term anywhere I can find.
1323672150939738113 2020-11-04 01:03:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Nelson67 @metwying This is the earliest possible reference for the term but it's a translation from Turkish and I can't confirm that it was in widespread use. Still, it's the best candidate.

1323656701321641984 2020-11-04 00:02:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The term "deep state" is synonymous with "civil service" as I understand it which goes back to the late 19th century as a mechanism by which executive power is effectively limited. Does anyone know exactly how long this moniker has been is widespread use?
1323653162172076032 2020-11-03 23:48:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @asimplefoolblog Economically speaking, means there's a significant increase in purchases or dramatic catastrophe in production. I would guess the former. The only entities of sufficient size to affect the overall market are states. State hoarding of fuel generally indicates anticipation of war.

I'm planning on doing a thread on it but, I've been focused on bolognavirus and corporativism.
1323109325091545088 2020-11-02 11:46:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> One possibility that should be considered is that a popular mass recall movement that rises to the notice of media and bureaucratic administrators may well force an end to the lockdown at least which we must agree is the first order of business. Organizing MR will then be easier.

Once you look at the evidence and the potential sources, including the sun, the idea that it's because you drive a 4 cylinder, breathe, and occasionally fart is silly. The idea that it's catastrophic is more absurd.

1323051943196086275 2020-11-02 07:58:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience @JadedSystems The collapse was anticipated and unavoidable. Indeed, go back far enough and it was certainly understood if not intended. This is both their big grab and their emergency plan. I think that's why it's so grandiose. I suspect many of them want to see it happen before they die too.
1323051211411566593 2020-11-02 07:56:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @UberConvenience @JadedSystems That isn't unthinkable. He's not that smart of a guy and he probably could be fooled pretty easily. The shit-eating grin routine sort of suggests that. They get him to take credit and when something awful happens, which it's designed to I presume, he's left holding the syringe.

They will at some point since he has failed to perform his function.

1323043627363454977 2020-11-02 07:25:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dtempleton_smb Even worse than that. It's been well established for years that masks don't work for viruses.   https://t.co/FOu7hpzumO  "In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25).”

Reestablishing independent decentralized towns appears to me to be the only way to begin. Disassembling the central government just isn't going to happen otherwise. 50 states may be an organizational interim.
1323023179699441665 2020-11-02 06:04:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LibertyTre3 Other issue is corporativism. We can already see that global totalitarian corporativism is not concerned with borders at all. Each corporate organ may have a host country but, they are coordinated by the world state, whatever that turns out to be. They seem to be separate issues.
1323021623788773376 2020-11-02 05:58:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LibertyTre3 I'm not opposed to it. My only concern is the way the average person views secession. They think the left gets one country and the right gets the other. Any viable secession would need to start with the dissolution of the federal government and reestablishment of the 50 states.

Each is a stage in the complete subjugation of humanity. We can't allow these crimes to go unpunished but, primary challenge at this point is to reassert control over civilization, wrest it from hands of psychopaths.
1323017723924930564 2020-11-02 05:43:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AuditorInvestor @SalemLola Just as societal conflict with islam is created by governments deliberately importing hostile elements to excuse existing plans for a security state, the bolognavirus was either released or intentionally allowed to spread in order to justify existing plans for biosecurity state.
1323015613724372994 2020-11-02 05:34:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AuditorInvestor @SalemLola Yes, fully agree. This touches on a feature of all propaganda as well. I was taken in by the 911 propaganda but, it's not that islam isn't an enemy of the west. As always, there's an element of truth. Same with the bolognavirus. It exists but, it does not justify totalitarianism.

It can't be a coincidence they tend to carry a hostile tone and not a cautionary one which you would expect from genuine concern.
1322974183312207874 2020-11-02 02:49:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> So far I've seen an obvious uptick in quislings, defeatists, and misanthropes attempting to discourage any and all discussion of corrective action.

They are the smallest possible organizational structures which can be managed by local populations. In short, it's a decentralization movement, nothing more. Each town will decide how to move forward.
1322871397790699530 2020-11-01 20:01:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> That said, I do not think that this should be or even could be a centrally directed movement. It's just too easy to subvert, extort, threaten, or kill potential leaders. We also don't want to end up with a dictator which is highly likely if it becomes a "revolutionary" ideology.
1322870686763884545 2020-11-01 19:58:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I believe the challenge is to get the information out to as many people as possible since it won't be possible if people aren't aware of it. We want to avoid the chaos likely to ensue if frustrated people simply act without coordination or idea of what expected outcome should be.
1322869777690447872 2020-11-01 19:55:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JeanValliere8 I spent a lot of time formulating this strategy and have been openly talking about it since April. The only additions to it have been explanations, cautions, and more detailed descriptions of the procedures likely required to successfully enact. It is simple and it will work.
1322867640591941638 2020-11-01 19:46:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @chbstone2 I believe antifa, blm, etc. are government run or state sanctioned operations. They're certainly serving the purposes of totalitarians and not citizens. Plan for subjugating humanity at the planetary level appears to include expectation of "pushback" used to justify restrictions.
1322866703328530448 2020-11-01 19:42:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Purpose is to remove all sitting officials in every town. Apprehend every single person who's employed by state in any capacity. Many will cooperate as many are sympathetic to the cause and may possess critical intel on plans or procedures which will assist in removing superiors.
1322865718447247360 2020-11-01 19:38:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Members of military would not be predisposed to act on orders of that nature anyway with every town in revolt. It's probable that a large proportion of military is still comprised of citizens of the country's military in which they serve. We need to act before even that changes.
1322865317459222528 2020-11-01 19:37:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If a government did decide to deploy weapons of mass destruction against its own population, it would not last long and they could not kill all of us that way anyway. If they would do that, it would better to find that out now than to wait for them to further consolidate forces.
1322864718416125953 2020-11-01 19:35:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The primary idea is that no government could claim consent with all of its towns in open but orderly revolt. National governments would be unlikely to declare open war on the the whole of the population. Such a move would immediately discredit all of its supposed justifications.
1322863783019241479 2020-11-01 19:31:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> There's no legal recourse or legislative corrective action to end tyranny. Reason to bring families is because, in towns, it's likely police are still mostly family, neighbors, and friends. This will minimize the likelihood of mass slaughter. It's also reason to ignore cities.
1322862910528491521 2020-11-01 19:27:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's neither a protest nor the pseudo-democratic political process of a similar name which is simply a petition to government. Should be obvious to those of us aware of the situation that such approaches cannot work. We have no confidence in legislators to act in good faith.
1322861826187689984 2020-11-01 19:23:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's time to elucidate what peaceful town level civil rebellion is. Gather 500-1000 families and conduct mass recall of all sitting officials in your town. From there, ask county and state officials to step down. Needs to be locals in every town and simultaneous but it will work.

Now that I know that you are in fact, at least in part, personally responsible for the situation we find ourselves due to the personalities and policies you probably voted for. I repeat myself but, go fuck yourself you fucking scumbag traitor.
1322849519239860225 2020-11-01 18:34:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins Do you understand why I think you're part of the problem? What part of my idea is ineffective? It sounds to me like you're just another armchair revolutionary ready to send everyone else's kids into battle with no plan for success. Start listening, thinking, and shutting up.
1322848239339659266 2020-11-01 18:29:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins Fuck you.

All I know for sure is that you are definitely not helping and are unlikely to help in the future. Do you understand how that makes you not an ally, possibly an enemy?
1322844684574552065 2020-11-01 18:15:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins Sorry, I'm getting tired of the script for this type of conversation which seems to be a long list of reasons why it can't, won't, or shouldn't be done. The procedure is simple, clear and repeatable to others. That is the bottleneck I see, getting the information out.
1322841667720912896 2020-11-01 18:03:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins Indifference is poison. If you're not going to help, shut the fuck up.
1322841521977204737 2020-11-01 18:02:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins Not riots, remove all sitting officials in every town. Apprehend every single person who's employed by the state in any capacity. Many will cooperate as many are sympathetic to the cause and may possess critical intel on plans/procedures which will assist in removing superiors.

1322839592261853185 2020-11-01 17:55:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins Obviously, I have not spoken about the details of this as much as I ought to. The idea is that no government could claim consent with all of its towns in open but orderly revolt. National governments would be unlikely to declare open war on the the whole population.
1322839038160764928 2020-11-01 17:52:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins Not a protest, remove all sitting officials from their offices in your home town. Reason to bring families is because in towns it's likely the police are still mostly family, neighbors, and friends. This will minimize the likelihood of mass slaughter. Needs to be everywhere.
1322837797309452288 2020-11-01 17:48:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins I'm glad you see it, many people don't even conceive of the idea, much less associate it with the pseudo-democratic political process of a similar name which is simply a petition to government. Obvious to those of us aware of the situation, that won't work.
1322836996201611264 2020-11-01 17:44:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RBonlett @LPerrins The only option I'm aware of is peaceful town level civil rebellion.

Just as police engaging in unnecessary violence against peaceful people trying to live their lives are referred to as "gestapo." The truth is they're not actually Nazi soldiers. I'm guessing you're unfamiliar with a period in history we call the "20th century."
1322833008253165568 2020-11-01 17:29:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ClarkeMicah I have concluded that mass recall is the only mechanism by which we may peacefully bring this dark chapter to a close.
1322832608791793664 2020-11-01 17:27:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LPerrins Mass recall is the only solution.

1322662410268934145 2020-11-01 06:11:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @princesshutt I get you, the struggle is real. 😧
1322661887083978752 2020-11-01 06:09:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jozannyme Probably the closest thing to a proper usage of the term. Also, for great adventures such as climbing a mountain or sailing but, documentary works for those.
1322661099775397896 2020-11-01 06:05:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @john_parsons68 Editorials and polemics are all available venues for such pursuits, if "journalism" is supposed to mean them all, I think that is evidence enough that it means nothing.
1322660015073873920 2020-11-01 06:01:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @princesshutt I think it's a mistake to dismiss the dissimulation as trite or shallow. It's a calculated lie, intended to mislead in order to serve a destructive agenda.

1322657681249894402 2020-11-01 05:52:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @princesshutt Detective, investigator, documentarian, or polemicist, I think the term is fabricated and never really held any meaning other than what we attribute it from popular culture. I do comprehend its intended meaning in that context. I just dispute its legitimacy.

1322655769054117888 2020-11-01 05:44:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @john_parsons68 I'm pretty sure it's just writing down what someone said, hence the "journal" part.
1322654866758578176 2020-11-01 05:41:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The ultimate purpose of all of this is to 'burn the ships' so there's nothing left to go back to. To destroy all independent businesses and savings. Planned economies can't have free movement or resources will be misallocated. Acclimating public to permanent travel restrictions.
1322652757535444994 2020-11-01 05:32:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 Likewise between cameraman and filmmaker though, at least the latter suggests direction.
1322651978456064002 2020-11-01 05:29:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Journalism has never been a profession. To claim that title is to reveal a deep misunderstanding of the role of observers. The mere fact that such people cannot in good conscience call themselves documentarians is evidence of that. I'm convinced now more than ever of this fact.
1322647131111510018 2020-11-01 05:10:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ThomasEWoods World is now a command economy for the most part by definition. Planned economies can't have free movement. Purpose is to burn the ships. Threat building for a long time and this global totalitarian corporativist state is the manifestation of all of the work to date to that end.

1322509709388226565 2020-10-31 20:04:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @twitchy56209254 It's from Beowulf I think.
1322508422152159237 2020-10-31 19:59:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In the past, I've differentiated between "megacorporations" which are absolutely corporativist institutions of state in sense that I describe and merely companies which "incorporate" to benefit from special corporate legal exemptions. I no longer see purpose to this equivocation.
1322505405784825858 2020-10-31 19:47:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Shrugging our shoulders and allowing this to continue is suicidal. Maybe a noticeable drop in support will alert people to the threat we face from them and the state. If we can get normal people talking about it the seed of doubt and distrust will grow which certainly can't hurt.
1322504278506983427 2020-10-31 19:42:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you have a pet corporate interest, disinvest immediately. If you work for a corporation, leave it if you can. If you have the choice of acquiring goods or services from anyone but a corporation, do that. None of this will defeat corporations though, state makes them immortal.
1322503338898923520 2020-10-31 19:39:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Corporations are extensions of state policy in corporativism. Ergo, this is state censorship of dissenting voices, plain and simple. Corporations are everyone's enemy, do not defend them. Do what you can to disrupt the facade they display and to expose their nefarious activities.
1322502554798985217 2020-10-31 19:35:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> You may have noticed that twitter is not showing all notifications for interactions. If not, now you know why it seems like there is less activity. There isn't really much that can be done about it except to acknowledge the manipulation and understand that it must be intentional.
1322500963270193154 2020-10-31 19:29:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @anarchocheems @Voidwurm @TimeTrench22 @NicobanT @dannycantalk @cupthought27 @Azathot17 @ReapersLight Corporativism is not capitalism. Corporations are not capitalist, they're effectively state agencies. They're chartered by the state and granted limited liability not afforded market actors. It's an ideology in itself and a government form. Function is to manage planned economy.
1322497051683393536 2020-10-31 19:14:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @plattjo @beinlibertarian That's actually facebook but, I assume it's because they want liberty people to go away and not talk openly about what is happening. Twitter is a little more sneaky about it but, the effect is the same and it appears they are following suit and becoming more brazenly censorious.
1322494384034766849 2020-10-31 19:03:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @nightsky20201 @fivestarmichael @SlowZen Sorry, just noticed this. I'm not getting notifications for all replies. Small businesses are being intentionally destroyed as are individual savings. Anything which doesn't serve state interests is being intentionally smothered. Taxes are mostly irrelevant with respect to this.
1322492866220953602 2020-10-31 18:57:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BrainMechanical @SallyMayweather According to the plan, "pushback" is one of the goals. It's intended to be used as a justification for increased restrictions and deployment of military assets. It doesn't actually matter whether there actually is resistance but, where it happens it will be focused on for optics.
1322492133333520384 2020-10-31 18:54:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Xeelee1 @vinarmani Worldwide, the command economy we have in the US is not unique.
1322491759285460992 2020-10-31 18:53:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SeRoKeVA @SallyMayweather Basically, yes. they call them "quarantine facilities" and the assumption is they will be implemented in every country eventually. Most militaries are being activated for use against populations almost everywhere ostensibly to assist "vaccine delivery" or to control rioting.
1322439386877878272 2020-10-31 15:24:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @gyneth007 @beinlibertarian Yes, I didn't use it for the longest time because I thought that was its purpose until I was told that people used it as a publisher so I tried it. Glad I did so I at least got a sense of what their game was before dumping it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have the experience to comment.
1322438025406763010 2020-10-31 15:19:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @vinarmani Subtle clarification, we've been a command economy since "the event." A requirement of any planned economy is prevention of free movement. You can't allocate resources according to a central plan if people can move around freely. This is about control, yes, but it's to that end.
1322436880105984001 2020-10-31 15:14:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SlowZen Central to my point about corporativism. Corporations are not organizations of capitalist enterprise, they are granted limited liability charters from the state not afforded market actors to implement and manage sectors of the economy. They are already state institutions.
1322432865209114624 2020-10-31 14:58:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @gyneth007 @beinlibertarian Yup, all of them are. It's one of those things though, you write a book, people will read it, including your opponents. The difference is that they can freely burn copies at will and prevent you from selling your book in most venues. The only recourse is to write more and louder.
1322423815327154176 2020-10-31 14:23:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @gyneth007 @beinlibertarian The rest were similar too, Rand, Rothbard, Acton, Spooner, etc. I couldn't believe it.

1322364114476408832 2020-10-31 10:25:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @StopNewNormal @woolyback39 Gather 500-1000 families and conduct mass recall of all sitting officials in your home town, ignore cities. From there, ask county and on up officials to step down. Needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but it will work and it's the only thing that will.

1322351039681581058 2020-10-31 09:33:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hitherthou Peaceful town level civil rebellion. Gather 500-1000 families and remove all sitting officials in your town, ignore cities. From there, ask county/state officials to step down. Needs to be locals, in every town, and simultaneous but it'll work and it's the only thing that will.
1322256684186783745 2020-10-31 03:18:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hitherthou Mass recall is a local endeavor so there's nothing stopping everyone from doing it. But, everyone does have to do it. It's a long shot in the sense that if people don't want to do it, it won't happen. It's the only peaceful option and I believe it's the only thing that will work.

1322195466814136321 2020-10-30 23:15:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Bad so few on twitter. Bad so few on twitter are aware of idea of a threat. Bad so few aware of the idea believe in a threat. Bad believers of threat don't consider it imminent. Bad those who see imminent threat are indifferent. Bad indifference itself turns out to be the threat.
1322192095575244800 2020-10-30 23:02:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MuttBull Cronyism implies corruption of an otherwise workable system which is certainly not the case. Indeed, "corruption," meaning the errant behavior of individual actors within the system, is at an all-time low. Everybody is pretty much following orders to a tee.
1322191607429505024 2020-10-30 23:00:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MuttBull Cronyism works but corporativism is the most accurate and explains historical evolution to the current state and the path intended for the future. The key realization is the end of freedom and the gradual elimination of all aspects of life including, eventually, existence.

1322151965292404740 2020-10-30 20:22:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MuttBull One word for it. Corporativism is the most accurate term and I choose the Italian spelling to draw attention since many erroneously view "corporatism" as simply a derogatory word for capitalism. It's antithetical to capitalism with origins in syndicalism and guild socialism.

1322094866466222080 2020-10-30 16:35:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Homesteading is when you combine your labor with unclaimed land and thereby assume property rights over it.

1322091111637286912 2020-10-30 16:20:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I figured you weren't listening based on the over the top obnoxiousness of your rantings.

1322090531170693121 2020-10-30 16:18:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Alright, you can't even stick to your trolling script. I'll give you 10 minutes to review the conversation to find the points I made. It is possible you didn't even read what I said so I'll give that much.
1322090033520775168 2020-10-30 16:16:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner OK, who builds the "condo."
1322089777924026368 2020-10-30 16:15:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I'm getting annoyed because you're being a dick and refusing to even consider any of the completely valid points I've made.
1322089175311699969 2020-10-30 16:13:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I think I've explained why group ownership is absurd and could in no way be the basis for a voluntary society. I could also destroy your imaginary communal building if you would like.
1322087993721692162 2020-10-30 16:08:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Ah yes, the old, "I used to be an anarcho-capitalist." 🙄
1322087407613841408 2020-10-30 16:06:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Ah yes, because a field is too complicated as an example of group ownership but, a building with staircases is much easier.
1322087019770793984 2020-10-30 16:04:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @InsanityIsFree  https://t.co/HKWd7GynFG
1322086405342973952 2020-10-30 16:02:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Well, you've ignored every pertinent point I've made and now you're starting another perpetual shenanigan. Why not stick to the field argument? Because you lost that argument. Instead of conceding, the field now has staircases. Embarrassing.
1322085544420089856 2020-10-30 15:58:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Yes, they are absurd and I've explained why. It seems that my explanation of why it's absurd is the very reason you like it, because it can't be sold.
1322084490722844672 2020-10-30 15:54:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Because you demanded i tell you. And you pretended to believe that social ownership was not absurd. You;re being an asshole again btw.
1322084064292200450 2020-10-30 15:52:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If I ask you to tell me which parts of the property each owner owns, can you tell me? If so, it's subdivided, if not, none of you own it. You've effectively created a corporate entity which owns it, typically with a chief representative who, for all intents and purposes, owns it.
1322083114735357952 2020-10-30 15:49:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I do in fact know what it is, unlike you and, yes.
1322082725919117312 2020-10-30 15:47:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I'm using your example of family owned property to demonstrate the absurdity of group ownership. You can't own something if you can't sell it. If you can subdivide it, it's not really group owned, just not yet subdivided.
1322082068730384386 2020-10-30 15:45:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner See? You are an asshole.
1322081312652611584 2020-10-30 15:42:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner How is that "market socialism?"
1322081151473823744 2020-10-30 15:41:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner You are making the case for "social ownership." That's what that means.
1322080780647075840 2020-10-30 15:39:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner First of all, you must admit that you are an asshole. But, I was responding to you calling me stupid. Moreover, I am getting irritated by your dodging questions and pretending you don't understand the obvious flaw in your logic which I have presented clearly.
1322079921653633025 2020-10-30 15:36:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If done at the scale of society, it should be clear that the land could never be sold since you could never get everybody to agree to sell it. If you somehow did get agreement, you would be selling the entirely of all of the land comprising your society. See how stupid that is?
1322079720570298368 2020-10-30 15:35:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner You are suggesting that we treat everybody as if they are engaged in a marriage. If that is the case, why do you not do that with your neighbors already? Join your lands together so that neither can sell without the others permission?
1322079550457655296 2020-10-30 15:35:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner You fucking did asshole by defending the ridiculous idea of "social ownership" which is the topic of the fucking conversation, is it not?
1322079136513429506 2020-10-30 15:33:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Which is to say that you cannot sell it. Ergo, you don't really own it. At societal scales certainly.
1322078489793728512 2020-10-30 15:30:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If done at the scale of society, it should be clear that the land could never be sold since you could never get everybody to agree to sell it.

1322078153376964608 2020-10-30 15:29:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If it is a matter of familiarity. You are possibly suggesting that we treat everybody as if they are engaged in a marriage. If that is the case, why do you not do that with your neighbors already? Join your lands together so that neither can sell without the others permission?
1322077434288680960 2020-10-30 15:26:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If you can't sell it, what makes it yours?
1322077104641613824 2020-10-30 15:25:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner What's the difference between each member of my family owning a specific plot of the land within an area and your so-called "group ownership?" If there's no difference, why are you calling it something different? If "group ownership" can be subdivided, how's it "group ownership?"
1322076248756146176 2020-10-30 15:21:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner  https://t.co/dRjcNSvdCB
1322076074562494464 2020-10-30 15:21:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @sunbugg 😅
1322075352961875969 2020-10-30 15:18:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If an individual can own it, why don't they?
1322075156425121793 2020-10-30 15:17:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner How about you answer the question?
1322074868402262021 2020-10-30 15:16:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner How do you divide it up for sale? If it is already defined as a subportion, it is not technically group ownership.
1322074560372551680 2020-10-30 15:15:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner We are talking about private property, owned by an individual. The 'sell yourself into slavery' is a meaningless example for a variety reasons from disprovability to redundancy, possible or not, it has no bearing on the divisibility of group ownership one way or another.
1322073798674419713 2020-10-30 15:12:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If she sells her part, tell me what part that is.
1322073031708205056 2020-10-30 15:09:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner If you can't sell it, you don't own it.
1322072860232474625 2020-10-30 15:08:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Really? How does one sell their portion if it's not already defined? If it's defined, don't they own only that portion making "group ownership" inapplicable?
1322072454576091136 2020-10-30 15:06:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I'd have to see that quoted, preferably in his later works.
1322072173318754305 2020-10-30 15:05:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @M_Phatical I have only done it twice and it works if you want it to. What seemed to help was drinking water believe it or not. You just don't necessarily want to smoke when drinking water. It's a temporary fix though and you can drink too much water.
1322071334193557504 2020-10-30 15:02:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Nope.
1322070719950368768 2020-10-30 14:59:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Correct, when Mises says "liberal," he means free market.
1322070455583465473 2020-10-30 14:58:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Because "social ownership" is nonsense.

1322066753476808706 2020-10-30 14:44:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Yes, I agree, we can never be in agreement.

1322066289960112128 2020-10-30 14:42:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner No, many reasons why but, chief explanation for why it couldn't be is that it is unenforceable except by an interventionist state. Trade secrets are up to the possessor to defend if possible and theft of property would be criminal but, emulation of styles or techniques cannot be.
1322065433202216960 2020-10-30 14:38:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Correct, we went from feudalism to mercantilism to the closest thing we've ever had to capitalism, laissez-faire, considered to be minimal interventionist but, in practice, corporativist.
1322065024228171776 2020-10-30 14:37:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner You have not attempted to explain how the economic system of socialism could have anything to do with the free market as they are antithetical in nature. So, your "free market socialism" remains oxymoronic in my assessment.
1322064397343272960 2020-10-30 14:34:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Intellectual property cannot exist in a free market though, trade secrets may be kept close to the vest for as long as possible owing only to the diligence of the possessor to keep secret.
1322064071739482112 2020-10-30 14:33:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner No, capitalism has no institutions. It is simply the name of the process by which private property is exchanged based on the subjectively assessed value of the transaction participants. Any third party intervention is considered criminal or, at least a contractual violation .
1322063440236683266 2020-10-30 14:31:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner No economic system has been described as yet that I am aware of. Please attempt it.
1322063103392206848 2020-10-30 14:29:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Different interventionist theories, not capitalist.
1322062862383198208 2020-10-30 14:28:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Good guys and bad guys, got it.
1322062591036973057 2020-10-30 14:27:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Sounds like what I call interventionism, you call "state capitalism." There, we've solve that at least.
1322062139461349377 2020-10-30 14:25:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Sounds like my 'good guys' description. If you own stuff and trade that capital, you are capitalists. If you have anything less than that, it is no longer capitalism. Free markets implies ownership of property in order to effect trade thereby transferring ownership.
1322061479437361152 2020-10-30 14:23:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner You cannot have state capitalism. That is interventionism and negates capitalism. The measure being de facto removal of a free market by interventionism. We have traditionally called the closest thing to capitalism to have existed in practice laissez-faire.
1322059030710407169 2020-10-30 14:13:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Ah, the old "state capitalism" routine, eh? 🙄
1322058793014960128 2020-10-30 14:12:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776 idealismology? 🤔
1322058462042488832 2020-10-30 14:11:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776 I think you mean to combine ideology and idealism, ideologyism?
1322057990883737601 2020-10-30 14:09:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Yes, it certainly does mean they don't exist. Much like voluntary rape or consentual murder.
1322057614943989760 2020-10-30 14:07:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner See, you are just being an dick. Corporativism is not capitalism and you know it. If you don't, we're done here.
1322057331857854464 2020-10-30 14:06:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner 🤨
1322054389855670272 2020-10-30 13:55:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I thought you were denouncing property.

1322053066582011905 2020-10-30 13:49:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner So, how can you trade if you don't own?
1322052898973536257 2020-10-30 13:49:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner You do understand that goods and equipment are capital right?
1322052641808142336 2020-10-30 13:48:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @1Marchella You could put actual muzzles out but, it's not the poor kids' fault. Can't even have fun with it. 🙄
1322050481674506242 2020-10-30 13:39:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I'm not conflating them, they are synonymous. What "free market" is not "capitalism?"  https://t.co/jmNR9mQECQ
1322049787596857344 2020-10-30 13:36:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner How can you have an extended voluntary order using unhampered price fluctuations as the communicator of  supply and demand changes and somehow call that socialist? What part would not be free market?
1322048917165477888 2020-10-30 13:33:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner That's like saying that if the supreme soviet gives a special sticker, you get to be a capitalist. The existence of an interventionist state negates all capitalism. The only capitalism that can exist in an interventionist order is what's called "black market" but, it's distorted.
1322048199260098561 2020-10-30 13:30:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Basically, if I may summarize your worldview, you think that capitalists are bad guys and socialists are good guys and you pretty much don't know anything about economics. Sound about right?
1322047653719511041 2020-10-30 13:28:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner We already agreed that capitalism is the absence of a system. You can't "empower" yourself without interventionism. Authoritarianism/totalitarianism is simply naked unapologetic interventionism.
1322046966268874753 2020-10-30 13:25:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Oh dear god, please don't go down the road of anarcho-communism. I'm so sick of having to explain this to people. 🤦‍♂️
1322046561950552069 2020-10-30 13:23:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak I think we agree, directed energy, in whatever form it is delivered, has the potential to cause harm to living tissue depending on proximity to transmitter, power level of output and depth of penetration determined by frequency bandwidth. Pulsing may also be a factor.
1322045812512329728 2020-10-30 13:20:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner There's your problem. You don't seem to know what you're talking about.
1322045489521528832 2020-10-30 13:19:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Corporations are not capitalist institutions. Capitalism has no institutions per se. You are making the same mistake that many supposed capitalists make in attributing to corporations the features of a scaled business model into a firm/company, also not institutions per se.
1322044682688438272 2020-10-30 13:16:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Not sure why you're disagreeing with known origins of corporativism. Guild socialism was a planned economy, all socialisms are planned economies. Using them interchangeably perhaps incorrectly but, I can't think of a planned economy that isn't a form of socialism or vice versa.
1322043399785107457 2020-10-30 13:11:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon Anyone who is doing something is not on my list. I am specifically talking about people who say "the lord's got my back, see ya chump, lulz!" or something to that effect.
1322042989804474368 2020-10-30 13:09:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776 Semantics then. It sounds like you think an ideology is something more than a specific set of principles organized into a particular system.
1322042605501296640 2020-10-30 13:08:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner And as a mechanism for planning the economy, it qualifies as a form of socialism. That is in fact its direct origin. Perhaps it would be easier to understand that aspect by learning about its specific antecedent, guild socialism.
1322041680846094337 2020-10-30 13:04:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak So we are in agreement then. Non-ionizing radiation can be harmful.
1322041424720912384 2020-10-30 13:03:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776  https://t.co/h0ONulSOvp
1322041258257297409 2020-10-30 13:02:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon All true but, I'm not sure how that fits in with my complaint about people who are just waiting to catch the holy express to heaven while we all get tortured to death.
1322040769222508545 2020-10-30 13:00:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner You do you bud. I'm just telling you what my understanding of what the government form known as corporativism is. Capitalism is the absence of a system of management though, you are correct. And, if you believe socialism is just people being nice and sharing, so is that.
1322040215289081856 2020-10-30 12:58:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak Specifically, those bandwidths associated with 'backscatter' for 3D visual representations of real time activity completes the total surveillance package. Only thing left is brainwave monitoring which is further along than you might think (no pun intended.)
1322039556447834112 2020-10-30 12:56:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak Yeah, if the chief comfort is that "the law" forbids it, you'll understand my hesitance to accept that. The other issue has to do with pulsed emissions which I haven't fully investigated as yet. My primary concern is the 3D imaging capabilities though as I mentioned in before.
1322038761958625281 2020-10-30 12:52:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner In a socialist society, every person is a worker.
1322038294536986624 2020-10-30 12:51:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Mike_theKnife @princesshutt That's not such big a deal. It's just saying that '97 liked in this section of the notifications.' The rest happened in other sections of the notifications, usually more a few hours previous.
1322037631899836416 2020-10-30 12:48:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon It's a purely spiritual view and it might be correct. My problem with it is that, if it is not correct, we would have handed the planet over to psychopaths to enslave our descendants forever in perpetuity for nothing and possibly causing the extinction of the human race.
1322036881937387522 2020-10-30 12:45:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JohnBSmith1 Most thinking people detect a lot of this intuitively. It is rarely described publicly (in government schools) as it would expose the agenda long underway. Closest you will hear in public statements by politicians are euphemisms such as public-private partnership, third way, etc.
1322036095123623937 2020-10-30 12:42:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Function of socialism at its core is to supplant individual decision making which is reasoned to not be in the interests of the collective and replace it with central planning of the economy which is reasoned to be in the interests of the collective. The collective is "workers."
1322035256086663170 2020-10-30 12:39:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DaveLloyd12345 Technically, everybody is a lobbyist who directly interacts with a representative. To ban lobbyists would be to ban us all from asking any representative to do anything. In practice, they're agents of "special interests" (again, we are also spec ints) who do it professionally.
1322034277597519873 2020-10-30 12:35:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon I am of the mind that forgoing defense of the living in defense of the dead, or the soon to be dead, would be wrong. I just can't accept that not fighting evil with every fiber of my being, in this world, right now, could be a mistake.
1322033706488471552 2020-10-30 12:32:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon Wouldn't really alter my current understanding of what is paramount, saving the world from evil. I'm focusing on material existence and, as such, perhaps wholly wrong. As an example, if Mormons are right, maybe we should only be trying to baptize every dead person retroactively.
1322028331030765569 2020-10-30 12:11:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The chief function of corporations from the perspective of the state is that it's able to direct economic activity in ways that would be forbidden for the government to do directly. Corporativism is a form of socialism and its purpose is to implement and manage a planned economy.
1322027439745359877 2020-10-30 12:07:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The key realization is that corporations are not organizational structures for capitalist enterprise. Do not confuse them with firms or companies. They receive a charter from the state to manage a sector of the economy and are granted limited liability not afforded market actors.
1322026002978136065 2020-10-30 12:02:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's common to hear complaints about "lobbyists" and "the revolving door." The suggestion being that these are crimes and their exposure can be corrected by regulators. In fact, no different than an 'inside salesman' and manager moving from one government department to another.
1322023868970795009 2020-10-30 11:53:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Reason I explain corporativism as an ideology and government form is because that's what it actually is and always has been. It's necessary to understand what's happening and how long it has been this way. Many people believe that corporate malfeasance is "corruption," it's not.
1322021154475954177 2020-10-30 11:42:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LLinWood @DesiaAllyJoseph In corporativism, corporations do bidding of the state. The state gets to direct economic activity in ways it would be prohibited from doing directly and the actors placed in those management positions are rewarded or replaced if they fail to obey orders. DOJ won't upset that.
1322019548783120384 2020-10-30 11:36:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @princesshutt @Mike_theKnife They'll sometimes conceal replies from others too depending on the shadowban settings for your account. Usually, you'll at least get a notification for a received like but, not always. I actually haven't tried to keep track of likes as bookmarks, it wouldn't surprise me though.
1322017916552884224 2020-10-30 11:30:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MAGAGwen @MissWinMa 🧐🐶😌
1322016880975118336 2020-10-30 11:26:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShonadMcDermott Yeah, that's a symptom. In general, it's pretty obvious if they conceal retweets so they have typically only done it for likes though, I noticed a hidden retweet recently. Most people don't double-check likes to make sure they persist (and why would they?) so the ratio will skew.
1322013967703855104 2020-10-30 11:14:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Mike_theKnife I've noticed in the past, if I go through and relike a lot, it will eventually relent and allow likes again for a short period. That manipulation exposure mitigation technique appears to be less prevalent now. Hoping it kicks in soon so I can have a normal session.
1322013318056464389 2020-10-30 11:11:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShonadMcDermott Twitter will frequently show you a filled-in heart when you like but not submit it to the counter on the master stats record. It used to be that you could toggle it until the number incremented and that would fix it. Now, it's showing the number and then later deleting it.
1322012588532781057 2020-10-30 11:08:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @englishovals @chipsimons Had a lot too, never was into the dumb ones. Everyone was pissed that I refused to get married. I was essentially MGTOW before it was a thing. I always explained that marriage was an absurd deal and nobody ever seemed to understand my legal point. Who would sign such a contract?
1322011387187482626 2020-10-30 11:04:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Twitter's like deletion script is getting more aggressive. I've had to revisit likes 2-3 times so far today to get them to persist. I'm in the habit of making sure the number increments so they've added more regression to the script. Confirm tweet stats to notifications to see.
1322010365627084801 2020-10-30 11:00:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @farflungdung1 @alijillTN Had to come back 3 times to make this like stick. I swear I got the number to appear each time so maybe they're extending the delete script out past one or two. Let me know if it still doesn't persist for the sake of reference.
1322006897264889858 2020-10-30 10:46:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @chipsimons The only reason I avoided much of it was by resisting it from a young age. The cost was tremendous in terms of having a "normal" life but I'm much better prepared now than if I had gone with the flow. It costed me everything but at least I chose my path, suspicions now confirmed.
1322003531084214272 2020-10-30 10:32:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JR12493830 Shut up you idiot.

1322002969483743232 2020-10-30 10:30:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JR12493830 Just to let you know, you people are pretty easy to spot. No amount of effort will get you to wake up so that's why I don't bother with you anymore. When and if you realize your mistake, you will deny it and justify your "caution" somehow. You're beyond fixing. Make sense?
1322001793631531008 2020-10-30 10:26:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JR12493830 You are a tyrant and an enemy of the human race. Fuck you.
1322001358061477889 2020-10-30 10:24:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JR12493830 If you want to drink the bubbly green liquid right now, I'm sure there's a mad scientist who would be happy to pour you a glass. If you become sterile of die, hey, it's for the good of the collective, right?
1322001052665847811 2020-10-30 10:23:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JR12493830 Normally, it would take years to develop a vaccine and safety testing is a good part of that. If it is this gene therapy, it would take at least that long to properly test and side effects could only manifest decades down the road, possibly even only showing up in descendants.
1322000331212029954 2020-10-30 10:20:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JR12493830 You are part of the problem.
1321999908191305729 2020-10-30 10:18:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Keith53707199 Yup, me too. It just can't be the case that doing nothing is good.
1321999455537799170 2020-10-30 10:16:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hitherthou The fact that you have to ask that question means you haven't made any effort to pay attention. If you are persistent, I will eventually answer specific questions. The problem is, there's not really enough time to handhold anymore so I'd appreciate it if folks would try harder.
1321996769543290880 2020-10-30 10:06:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @farflungdung1 @alijillTN 🧐 Yeah, I guess you mentioning it made me think of episodes, lol. How far are you guys into it now?
1321917954846420992 2020-10-30 04:52:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DigbyKale One thing he says about "human energy fields" and "virus frequencies" at the end is nonsense but, it's plausible that he is just misunderstanding/misusing terminology and referring to non-ionizing radiation. If he's a plant, he's almost completely correct up until that point.
1321916445589151744 2020-10-30 04:46:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @tryhonesty3 @CJBowden1 @MonicaPerezShow This is the reason I've been hoping for mass recall sooner than later. We can't really afford to allow them to lead this thing. Time to take control of the timeline. They may still release a weaponized pathogen but, at least it will be clear who did it and why.
1321915493859688454 2020-10-30 04:43:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776 And that's the psychological warfare component. To bombard the psyche with so much torment that they go numb. If a person isn't conscious of it or even they are but fail to actively debunk the most plausible falsehoods, they end up having no choice but to submit to peer pressure.
1321905082447941634 2020-10-30 04:01:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776 Yup, it's amazing how consistent findings from completely different researchers is. Part of it seems to be that all of the information has been let out into the wild, perhaps intentionally. It's one of the reasons I'm even considering the "satanic" component as 'of interest.'

1321903191349465095 2020-10-30 03:54:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @its_not_urfault 😁👍
1321903007307628544 2020-10-30 03:53:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> There are some useful comments buried in this thread. It's kind of chaotic and you would have to view each question and follow all the forks to see them. Just an FYI, I don't have time at the moment to expand them out or quote them all.
1321898576734228480 2020-10-30 03:35:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @its_not_urfault Yes, I addressed a lot of this in other response within the thread. I'm not outright dismissing anything, except lizard people still. But, he said nothing about them in this interview.
1321897665970450432 2020-10-30 03:32:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak I would be interested to see what the power provision is on the towers actually is and if they are rated for power levels which might cause concern. It is further complicated by pulsed transmission which some claim is disruptive to cellular cohesiveness. So it's not all nonsense.
1321897082765090817 2020-10-30 03:29:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak Generally speaking, the only safety testing that is ever done with respect to microwave transmissions is done with handsets since they are so close to the user that they are presumed to outweigh all other sources in terms of that ratio. i.e Broadcast towers are not safety tested.
1321896501476532226 2020-10-30 03:27:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak My specific concerns with these bandwidths has mostly to do with their uses for 3D imaging. It's a surveillance network if nothing else, and not just for communications. The effects of microwave radiation on water is obvious in ovens. But it's a matter of proximity/power output.
1321895541635190785 2020-10-30 03:23:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DrZoidb59930291 Again, with respect to the information he presents in this interview. If he's claiming to get the information from aliens or lizard people or even insiders, it would be embarrassing since all of it is available for anyone to discover and confirm. None of this relies on his word.
1321892009397964802 2020-10-30 03:09:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DrZoidb59930291 It could be that he was selected to present these observations, be discredited, and have the body of examples sullied. However, he's a little late to the game to be considered a source for any of this. That means his discrediting wouldn't be particularly relevant.
1321891414528139265 2020-10-30 03:07:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak In other words, he could be crossing his proverbial circuits, misusing terminology, and not be completely looney even on that topic.
1321890953205030912 2020-10-30 03:05:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak lol, I don't believe the lizard people thing but, according to my research on non-ionizing radiation, high power microwave emissions are undeniably deleterious to living tissue. Also, that's the field of study where certain MW frequencies may interact with particular molecules.
1321889450583040000 2020-10-30 02:59:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @EconCircus All I can say is that I came to the same conclusions he presents on my own. I have a much more detailed description of the economic aspects of it all but, the only wacky thing in this is the "frequency" business at the end. If he's a plant, that history may be why he was chosen.
1321888535406936065 2020-10-30 02:56:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DrZoidb59930291 It's not relevant to the information he is presenting here so it amounts to ad hominem fro the moment. If he is a disinformation agent, that could all be part of the hook too. The idea would be to present all the correct information and then say the lizard people people did it.
1321887769107587072 2020-10-30 02:52:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I've been hesitant to give him credibility but, this is a spot on summary for the most part except the "frequency" bit at the end. It's just his wording and suggestion of a "human energy field" that's a bit looney. I should point out, I don't have a debunk, I just don't buy it.
1321887668930752513 2020-10-30 02:52:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I am tending toward believing that he could be a disinformation agent. All of the information he is relaying is available and accurate so, it gives him credibility to present it. However, adding the 'poison pill' of "human energy field" would be the discrediting attempt.
1321886930024468482 2020-10-30 02:49:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DrZoidb59930291 I've been hesitant to give him credibility but, this is a spot on summary for the most part except the "frequency" bit at the end. It's just his wording and suggestion of a "human energy field" that's a bit looney. I should point out, I don't have a debunk, I just don't buy it.
1321886185048973312 2020-10-30 02:46:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> One qualification is the part about "frequency" and "human energy field" at the end. So, just a bit of 'lizard people' is in here.
1321885220833026056 2020-10-30 02:42:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> No lizard people here. Everything he's saying in this is in agreement with my findings and I have not used David Icke as a source for any information at all for any of my research. So far, I have not found any disputed claims among any of the rational analyzers of available data.
1321885095050027014 2020-10-30 02:42:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DigbyKale No lizard people here.

1321843907026690048 2020-10-29 23:58:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TruthSeekerTKS @DangerousLiber1 @JasonHCrowe @ACFederation I gather you're making an assertion about their failure to convert in coded language. This is unhelpful as an answer to my question. As I'm lead to believe in my admittedly limited understanding, people who call themselves jews are necessarily not followers of Christian teaching.
1321842520498802688 2020-10-29 23:53:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TruthSeekerTKS @DangerousLiber1 @JasonHCrowe @ACFederation So why is it the #1 form of government for the jews?
1321840013924065286 2020-10-29 23:43:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KAnyadnak I believe the only way to do this right is with peaceful town level civil rebellion. Yet they still have their fingers up their asses and are willing to let everyone die so they can feel good about themselves. I'm not asking them to murder anyone or even break the fucking law.

1321795699533586432 2020-10-29 20:47:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hardrockbus Most of the Christians (mostly catholics) I know are in my camp. They see the evil pope and are horrified. This particular category of Christians are just very very faithful near as I can tell. Hardly damning as a feature except when it serves the ends and purposes of evil.
1321793801103560704 2020-10-29 20:39:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 There comes a point where hell may be the purchase price for the continued existence of our children. I'd like to avoid that myself but, it's got to be at least on the table or else rejecting it when the time comes would seem to mean nothing. It makes no sense to forfeit to evil.
1321792259021512704 2020-10-29 20:33:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @sherpalou I'm not exactly sure, probably dark humor.
1321791199796187145 2020-10-29 20:29:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I'm not well enough versed to have a scriptural interpretation of any of this though, I'm working on it. All I know is that fighting evil can't be against the interests of good. Avoiding blatant violations of commandments, sure. But, complete submission to evil can't be right.
1321787201907249153 2020-10-29 20:13:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I don't like this pattern I'm seeing with certain Christians who seem to have no intention of helping to fight evil. What if dogmatic faith and acquiescence to evil is wrong, what then? Claim to know it's all sewn up, think their hands will be clean. I don't believe in shoo-ins.
1321782792968163331 2020-10-29 19:55:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @moulds_w If it took it wrong, I'm sorry. But you sound like a self-righteous piece of shit. I know christians who aren't like you.
1321780382359015425 2020-10-29 19:46:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @moulds_w If you're going to pretend to be righteous and just sit back and watch while good people destroyed by evil, you are not on my side. Enjoy your book.
1321778715102187530 2020-10-29 19:39:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @moulds_w So, basically yeah. I'm going to take a huge gamble and say that I believe god will forgive me for fighting evil. You do you.

We've known about propaganda operations including use of military software. All of this is happening during Trump's office. There's no reason to expect it to stop if he stays in office. All of it just makes mass recall indispensable.
1321470507628322817 2020-10-28 23:14:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 That is what is happening. The world is occupied by the Global Totalitarian Corporativist State (presumed to be banksters) which hands down edicts to be enacted and enforced by national and local bureaucracies which naturally includes all major corporations, NGOs, etc. worldwide.
1321469838695534595 2020-10-28 23:12:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 It's important to recognize that because of the circus which promises to reign in corporate malfeasance are illusory. Like the example above, the DoJ prosecuting the DoT for criminal activity would not change anything regardless of whoever may be branded responsible and punished.
1321469105984122880 2020-10-28 23:09:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 It's not the reverse. There is phenomenon in 'mixed economies' (economies with of mixture of market and socialist institutions) known as 'regulatory capture' which asserts that the "regulators" become controlled by corporate interests which is true. That is not what's happening.
1321466950778834944 2020-10-28 23:00:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The fact that a corporation trades stock in the market does not make it a capitalist institution. It would be no different than the Post Office trading stock in the market. All of the state institutions presumed to be pro-business are in fact, anti-business. The SBA no exception.
1321465956166782978 2020-10-28 22:56:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Once you realize that major corporations are effectively state agencies for all intents and purposes, you may fully comprehend how much of our economy is already fully directed by the state. We were inching toward complete corporativization before the event. Now we have leapt in.
1321464536365490178 2020-10-28 22:51:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Complaints of "lobbyists" are misplaced. Yes, there are lobbyists, even federal government offices have their own lobbyists to lobby for expansion such as the post office, etc. But, the state prosecuting a magacorporation is more like the DOJ prosecuting the DOT, utter theatre.
1321463880242106369 2020-10-28 22:48:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> FYI, in corporativism, corporations do what the state tells them to do. If they are challenged or lose credibility, they are replaced. The appearance of correction is fulfilled and the practice either continues with new management, with another corporation or is assumed by state.

1321179752569491457 2020-10-28 03:59:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The most extreme examples being the limited distance for travel being imposed. Law enforcement setting up checkpoints and drones keeping track of vehicles to make sure that people don't travel away from their localities is all to that end. It's not airtight but, it's becoming so.
1321178274765090821 2020-10-28 03:53:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 I am concerned about what is happening generally to everybody.
1321178025208238080 2020-10-28 03:52:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> One absolutely necessary requirement of any planned economy is prevention of free movement. You can't plan distribution of resources if everyone can go where they like. This was the alarm bell convincing me so early on of what was happening and it's why we're still in lockdown.
1321177033125384193 2020-10-28 03:48:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> A prime example of this would be the unprecedented banning of "non-essential" goods from store shelves. There are many such examples but that one should strike anyone witnessing it as without explanation. It's been happening the whole time but, people are now beginning to notice.
1321176053453332482 2020-10-28 03:44:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This is where any economist aware of the dangers of planned economies little hairs should start standing up. We are being transformed into a command economy with government effectively banning certain trade and effectively mandating other trade. Not just here, happening globally.
1321174863172771844 2020-10-28 03:40:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 Not sure what your point is beyond that you are doing much better than many. Is that your point? That you are doing much better than many people are during this whole thing?
1321174464831328259 2020-10-28 03:38:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 Keep that up, it may be critical in the years ahead to have access to meat.
1321174144516562946 2020-10-28 03:37:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 I was being sarcastic. My point is that not everyone in the country or the world is experiencing the same thing during all of this. Your contribution is encouraging but, not representative of the experiences of many small businesses during this lockdown.
1321173543183372292 2020-10-28 03:34:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 Yes, that is the ultimate goal. For increased control of the industry by corporations which operate under the direction of government.
1321173248588062722 2020-10-28 03:33:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 Awesome, perhaps everyone should move to your town.
1321173100843704321 2020-10-28 03:33:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The overall result of all of the corporate consolidation and elimination or attenuation of small businesses is a shrinking of individuals able to survive unassisted and an expansion of corporate interests, directed by government in what is called "public-private" partnerships.
1321171890006798338 2020-10-28 03:28:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @rogersdavis9 It isn't a total eradication, it's a squeeze. Packers were the choke point. Similar squeezes were put on every small business not able to endure with no income. At least you probably could sell some of your stock while restaurants for example are forced to simply stay closed.
1321170557392560128 2020-10-28 03:23:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Most small businesses have limited resources and tend to reinvest much of their income. Savings are usually not a tremendous portion of their working capital. It would be unusual for a small business to survive more than a handful of months with no income and lockdowns kill most.
1321169029516697600 2020-10-28 03:16:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> While all this was going on, food production/distribution infrastructure seemingly methodically dismantled, livestock destroyed and corporate consolidation of industry tightened. Similar consolidation occurring in many industries, Amazon being exemplary.   https://t.co/vjodQiUkf5
1321161653052940288 2020-10-28 02:47:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This admittedly experimental technique using an adeno-associated virus related to adenovirus, which caused the immune system to attack organs killing a patient when it was halted in the 2000s, appears to be the "vaccine" which is intended to be administered to 7.8 billion people.  https://t.co/jWdBhvugcR

1321159157454643211 2020-10-28 02:37:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Already assumed that the "vaccine" would be based on gene therapy techniques rather than traditional vaccines. Normal safety testing for vaccines can take years but we're told that a "vaccine" developed using these techniques would ready within months.   https://t.co/us7bEqbXiC
1321157600935923717 2020-10-28 02:31:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Vaccines were put forward almost immediately as the de facto solution to a viral outbreak which was being assumed to never go away. Restrictions were imposed with open-ended undeclared durations hinted to last until the development of the vaccine.

1321154526200606727 2020-10-28 02:19:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This appearance on Ellen in April is representative of a host of his suspicious and downright disturbing declarations.   https://t.co/Erfnl6updu
1321151696295383044 2020-10-28 02:08:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> From the beginning, Bill Gates appeared to be the global representative of all doctors and all governments everywhere. He was to be your diagnosing physician and already had your prescription prepared. You just had to be informed of details of what you would be required to do.
1321147374320967681 2020-10-28 01:50:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Conventional science and logical deductions based on the available evidence at time didn't support the imposition of any of the procedures which governments all over the world seemed to be enacting in identical fashion simultaneously. Only variations of intensity were observable.
1321144026406522886 2020-10-28 01:37:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I should point out that there are a variety of plausible alternative medical interpretations of all of this from exosomes to assertions of its complete fiction. The mysterious disappearance of the flu supports much of that but, I am confining my analyses to conventional science.
1321140679410634759 2020-10-28 01:24:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This CDC report summarizes 70 years of controlled experiments which had already established widely known fact that masks don't work for viruses.  "In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks.”   https://t.co/FOu7hpzumO
1321139781397610496 2020-10-28 01:20:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Later revealed that Italian numbers were incorrect. Actual infection/fatality rates were about 10%-15% of what had been reported. This revelation had no effect on policy anywhere. In fact, it was around that time that increased restrictions were imposed, mask mandates introduced.
1321138361969610754 2020-10-28 01:15:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Most of the hysteria in the west was based on numbers coming out of Italy which seemed to show infection/fatality rates much higher than were witnessed in the handful of makeshift/uninteded controlled environments available at the time, namely the cruise ship and naval vessels.
1321135261133250561 2020-10-28 01:02:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ds13_manon Peaceful town level civil rebellion. Gather 500-1000 families in your home town and remove all sitting officials from office. From there ask county and state officials to step down. It needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but, it's the only thing that will work.
1321134706562387969 2020-10-28 01:00:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Assuming that the government just didn't notice this and was operating under the presumption that it was a deadly pathogen, the extensive interactions between law enforcement and the population with no biological mitigation strategy at all seemed at odds with that conclusion.
1321133481833996292 2020-10-28 00:55:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This is a UK government document showing that COVID-19 was declared not a high consequence infectious disease just before the lockdowns.  "As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK."   https://t.co/iPRtMuBxyw
1321132665404272644 2020-10-28 00:52:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Regardless of the nature of the release, we have known for some time that this virus is not the deadly pathogen claimed by government.  This shows actual fatality rates from CDC.  0-19 years: 0.00003 20-49 years: 0.0002 50-69 years: 0.005 70+ years: 0.054   https://t.co/uWhNoyBgp0

In months following, many shocking videos were released from China showing dramatic footage of spontaneous deaths, welding people in buildings, and other extreme fear propaganda as yet unsubstantiated and unobserved in the west.

Note that the restrictions will ramp up no matter what the reaction is so it's not exactly unwelcome but, I've concluded that only mass recall will get us out of this.

We'll have to do our best investigating such things when the dust settles but, they'll necessarily be forensic tasks and not instrumental in the defeat of the enemy. We'll need a good autopsy.
1321044523796094978 2020-10-27 19:02:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dumcoiner I think Libertarians are a lost cause but, even the libertarians are caught in repeating cycle of redundant rhetoric which has evolved into nothing more than mediocre virtue signaling. It's austrian economists who I fault most since they should be early detectors of such things.
1321041878188544000 2020-10-27 18:51:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LindaO888 @celticfanzone @skankyliar @Philly852 Very much a part of the build-up. In the US it officially began with the creation of the fed 100 years ago. I'm limiting my reference materials to within the decade but, the general outline for this specific plan appears to begin in the 70s and was begun in earnest in the 90s.

I'm mostly talking about people who claim to be liberty advocates but have either completely failed to perceive the threat or are actively discouraging its detection.

The state is supreme and corporations act as policy arms for it. They are virtual departments or agencies. They are not in conflict with one another.

It will require to get off of, and your head out of, your ass. I'm calling it by the technical term because it's evolution most easily described in that context.

1320821237900300291 2020-10-27 04:14:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken Note that this document is from 2010.
1320820672168382465 2020-10-27 04:12:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken This contains lockstep and the planned successive crises engineered to bring it all about.   https://t.co/KzUa70AXLx
1320820292596518914 2020-10-27 04:11:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken This is all happening much faster than I thought. I've been talking about corporativism for years but I wasn't expecting this to happen so soon or for people to fail to see it as it happens before our eyes. The climate agenda is the official justification and many just accept it.
1320818764238200837 2020-10-27 04:05:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken @POTUS Yes, China is coming from communism toward corporativism while the west is coming from soft corporativism with elements of free market (usually called a mixed economy) to more pure corporativism by eliminating independent businesses and free trade entirely.
1320817704526401538 2020-10-27 04:00:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken @POTUS The Nazis did outright own almost everything while the Italians were closer to corporativism with permitted corporations which were subordinate to the state giving the appearance of private ownership though they could be eliminated or replaced at the will of the state.
1320816926654926849 2020-10-27 03:57:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken I don't know exactly but, the face of it is the UN, WEF, WHO, world bank, etc. I am of the opinion that all of it is orchestrated in order to engineer the destruction of what's called the 'extended order,' voluntary decentralized system of private property and individual freedom.
1320815032725311488 2020-10-27 03:50:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken All life, all land, and all resources are to be centrally controlled according to the agenda.
1320814425297833984 2020-10-27 03:47:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken Some of it has already been presented. I'm trying to put together a semi-curated summary, at least a collated list.
1320813635556544514 2020-10-27 03:44:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken @POTUS All governments are participating, even the handful who've presented occasional obstacles may very well be theatre. In corporativism, the state is supreme and all corporations are subordinate. They are organs of state policy. I'll do a thread on that as well.  https://t.co/LqAnVPeSIF
1320811522856202240 2020-10-27 03:36:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken The point is not that we may defend our personal property but, that the world economy has been intentionally and artificially sabotaged with the intent of bringing humanity to its knees. With control over food and movement, starvation becomes a viable tool for killing en masse.
1320810644757749762 2020-10-27 03:32:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken By hopefully learning what is happening and for what purpose.
1320810424179326977 2020-10-27 03:31:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken The key observation being that it is deliberate.

1320808102460051461 2020-10-27 03:22:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken The collapse is currently happening.
1320745477319675904 2020-10-26 23:13:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken Who knows, not impossible given the state of things. I don't think it would change much though. The collapse of the world is speeding along just fine with or without Trump.
1320745103489597440 2020-10-26 23:12:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken The world is now virtually a command economy. Corporativists hold every person's life in their hand with almost complete control over food production and distribution and medical treatment. All property is about to be effectively taken away from everybody in the Great Reset.
1320739239823351813 2020-10-26 22:49:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken If we don't do something very soon, we could lose all of it. Nitpicking at policy is not where energies should be placed right now. We face a mortal threat to human civilization. It should at least be haunting the outskirts of every person's intuitive awareness by now.
1320735447597916160 2020-10-26 22:34:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PymPurnell yes
1320734602034597888 2020-10-26 22:30:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken Frankly, I expect nothing less from the big 'L' party but, austrian economists are an entirely different story.
1320730928742883329 2020-10-26 22:16:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @Crawfish4Kraken I discovered that almost all of these high profile libertarian accounts that don't follow anybody are in fact completely ignorant of the state of things. They've been jerking off talking about irrelevant nonsense while the fires of hell are being stroked beneath our feet.
1320730001583591424 2020-10-26 22:12:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Crawfish4Kraken The current rulers of the world are eugenicists. You really need to start paying attention.
1320724091968671745 2020-10-26 21:48:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Crawfish4Kraken I don't think you understand the full extent of what is going on. It's OK, most people don't. I'm just dismayed that the people who are supposed to be paying attention to such things have been so derelict in their duty. What if Mises didn't notice the rise of Nazi Germany?
1320716247537995776 2020-10-26 21:17:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel I know Tucker has been actively addressing the superficial aspects such as masks, etc. and I think Woods has as well to a lesser extent. But apparently almost no one else has done even that much. They're acting as if the Great Reset is some new shocking surprise, unfathomable.
1320714624971509762 2020-10-26 21:11:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Crawfish4Kraken I'm talking about the occupation of the world by the global totalitarian corporativist state. Of all people, these people ought to know that politics is drivel. If the most knowledgeable economists we have don't see what is happening, what fucking good are they?
1320710840253898753 2020-10-26 20:56:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LibertasInstruc I'm currently putting together reference materials for these fucking twatmongers who can't take 5 fucking minutes out of their fucking day to pay fucking attention to what the fuck is going on. I'll post it when I've calmed down a bit. This is tragically, criminally unforgivable.
1320708692506005507 2020-10-26 20:47:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @nongater Apparently never, but this is so much worse than failing to act. This is failing to know.
1320707717489659904 2020-10-26 20:43:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If it's really true that pretty much all high profile libertarians have been playing with themselves during the entire crisis, you've fucking pissed me off. I've been tolerant of voting blather and policy gobbledygook assuming it was optics while real work was being quietly done.

1320642895343439873 2020-10-26 16:26:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @chbstone2 The thing is, they clearly don't have to change it if they can just ignore it as they are. Furthermore, if we allow the sitting representatives to actually change it, it would not be likely to be improved but rather made to reflect current precedent. I think that's a dead end.
1320639257829167105 2020-10-26 16:11:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @denverbitcoin @joshhzimmer Holy shit, I heard "breasticles." 🤱
1320612772149952512 2020-10-26 14:26:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus Looks like this is what I was looking for. 👍
1320612536379711488 2020-10-26 14:25:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus Yes, that's in the list for the video thread on WEF's Great Reset. I will need a good isolated video of Klaus von Auschwitz doing his thing too if you happen to have a link to it.
1320611540240879616 2020-10-26 14:21:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus 😮  https://t.co/UxDzGFsWtD
1320607237505798144 2020-10-26 14:04:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus @anrko_anrkst Precisely. 🎯
1320603733789650944 2020-10-26 13:50:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Remember that the ultimate purpose of all of this is to reach the point where enough local residents in every town recognize the necessity of mass recall and be coordinated enough to enact it. If it can be done with no leaders at all, that would be ideal. No points of failure.
1320599519424368641 2020-10-26 13:33:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus @anrko_anrkst And it's the ones calling it out that get the caip bháis.
1320598622631845890 2020-10-26 13:30:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 It's significant. So much so that they shut off the ability to use the legacy interface which gave much better proof of manipulation. Depending on the content and circumstances, I think it's at least cut in half. Maybe much more.
1320597237714604034 2020-10-26 13:24:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 You certainly have. When you see only a few or no likes on posts, it's usually twitter deleting interactions. It's intended to make you question your effectiveness. The tactic is meant to reduce outward appearance as well. I expose it specifically to counter that perception.
1320595876822294530 2020-10-26 13:19:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Try anything. Try everything.
1320595492909309960 2020-10-26 13:17:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MADinMelbourne I would assume the Alex jones' of the world are back on these platforms in some capacity but, their distribution points have been incinerated. It's more of a recognition of who the totalitarians fear than any critical judgement of the persistence level of the anti-totalitarians.
1320594518094340096 2020-10-26 13:14:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Absolutely use their platforms, spread the message. Not saying don't try to convince them or their followers of the dire circumstances we face. I'm just saying any hopes of them becoming aware enough to lead constructive conversation is gone. They're mostly talking about policy.
1320591827733458945 2020-10-26 13:03:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm of the mind that we should probably cast aside the entirety of the professional intellectual class and begin discussing matters of actual importance amongst ourselves. It's possible some of them are savable but, there's likely just not enough time now. I will 'college try.'
1320590348096253952 2020-10-26 12:57:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It should be noted that the thought leaders in almost every intellectual sphere didn't perceive (or were aligned with) the threat and, consequently, did not raise the red flag. Some obvious exceptions come to mind. Almost all of those people have been silenced by corporate media.
1320588412727025674 2020-10-26 12:49:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It was treated as an exposure of the stupidity of the left and ridiculed. Most everyone just assumed the experiments would end in abject failure and result in restoring reasonable procedure, it was not taken seriously. It seems obvious in retrospect that that was a fatal mistake.
1320587421508128768 2020-10-26 12:45:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think most of the absurd policies enacted over the last couple of years/decades were actually just tests to get a measure of the critical thinking capacity of the public and to determine what, if any, limitations existed on the behavior of official bureaucrats at all levels.
1320577157698039809 2020-10-26 12:05:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lexie144 I found out about 'Chrislam' only recently.
1320576947555049473 2020-10-26 12:04:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lexie144 😂 Except organized religion is actually on the side of the totalitarians now. Have you been following any of the one-world religion developments? I've been ignoring it for the most part because of the importance of debunking the narrative, getting people to read about Agenda 21.
1320576253146112000 2020-10-26 12:01:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @js100js100 @Atters68 Good idea, maybe a thread for each section and a master thread for the series.
1320568810311745537 2020-10-26 11:31:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @js100js100 @Atters68 Cool, I'll include pdf but, I'll go ahead and pick best summary out there that's text readable with java/javascript off just in case some of these people are using text browsers, I don't want to send them unreadable content. May only have one chance to make case, need brevity.
1320567554260291584 2020-10-26 11:26:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @anrko_anrkst @123prometheus I'm putting together a thread to show to high profile accounts who haven't been paying attention in the hopes that they can be saved. I was pretty close to giving up until I noticed a post from someone that seemed to be starting to notice. I think they just don't read on twitter.
1320563538998550528 2020-10-26 11:10:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AngelaTC Sure seems that way.
1320449470065238017 2020-10-26 03:37:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus may have something here. GBN may actually be a Rockefeller site. 🤔  Gotta sleep though.   https://t.co/rTpLxR2Ra6
1320449018502303746 2020-10-26 03:35:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus Hmm, do you think GBN is actually a rockefeller site? I was just assuming it was the aggregator or something.
1320448534081081346 2020-10-26 03:33:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> OK off to bed, resume tomorrow.  Looking for most convincing Lockstep info. If internal link can't be found, best summary would probably be better than just linking a pdf. Target audience is new to the subject and will have limited attention span.  Thanks again everyone! 👍😴💤🛌
1320447172123480065 2020-10-26 03:28:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @js100js100 @Atters68 Awesome, thanks. 👍
1320445305322700800 2020-10-26 03:21:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JediTransition @latimeralder Yes, it couldn't protect us from what was supposed to be legitimate government. Of course, Spooner made that clear anyway. What is significant is not the failure of the constitution though, but rather the success of the global totalitarian corporativist state.
1320444607294017541 2020-10-26 03:18:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus To start the thread I'm looking for the most convincing Lockstep information. If an original internal link can't be found, the best summary would probably be better than just linking a pdf. The target audience is completely new to the subject and will have limited attention span.
1320443959760572421 2020-10-26 03:15:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @js100js100 @Atters68 Cool,  https://t.co/XvYwQuFnTX links are preferable to others so I may use those but, it looks like they are backups of GBN and not rockefeller. Still good to have as many copies around as possible. I should diff them all at some point to see if they are all exactly the same.
1320440793065312259 2020-10-26 03:03:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @js100js100 @Atters68 I tend to believe the Rothschild/Rockefeller origins but, it really doesn't matter where it came from and attempting to prove the architects of it works against enacting the solution. We can investigate it after we stop it. As I said, I hope it's not too late.
1320439896138534914 2020-10-26 02:59:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @js100js100 @Atters68 I analyzed the threat and pretty quickly came to the conclusion that there is only one solution to the problem, mass recall. I have been forced to address the symptoms such as mask and vax naziism because they are obstacles to mass recall. I hope we are closer to proceeding now.
1320438600778043395 2020-10-26 02:54:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TSvetlanab In this case, it turns out to be a plus in the sense that I had nearly given up on them. I was actually considering the possibility that they were being drugged or payed shills or something. This explanation accounts for their naked ignorance on the threat to human civilization.
1320437825360150529 2020-10-26 02:51:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TSvetlanab It's very true and very disheartening. I've come to the conclusion that it would be impossible to even have a chance of figuring out what is happening without being on twitter. But I mistakenly presumed that anyone on twitter was receiving and not merely broadcasting information.
1320436244430684160 2020-10-26 02:45:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SeanRyno1 @efreshwater5 @GforAnarchy12 Why are you still talking?
1320435968915218437 2020-10-26 02:44:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @js100js100 @Atters68 At least that long. Best estimates put this whole scenario as a general idea back to the 70s. Many believe it goes back to at least the creation of the fed 100 years ago. Others say hundreds, some 1000s. I'm only working with confirmed modern sources starting from 10 years ago.
1320434751342366721 2020-10-26 02:39:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TSvetlanab Trying to be coy so as not to embarrass but, it's important. I'm specifically talking about austrian economists associated with mises institute among others. They're not msm but 'elite' in the libertarian world and unfortunately do display some of the characteristics you mention.

1320425743034290178 2020-10-26 02:03:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @latimeralder The world has been captured by a global totalitarian corporativist state and we have been forcibly transformed into a command economy. National and local bureaucracies are being used to enact and enforce its edicts in complete defiance of any and all constitutional restrictions.
1320424993176592390 2020-10-26 02:00:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MarvKard @bright1082 Me too, I ride the roller coaster of despair and someone will usually give me an inspiring word when I need it. 🙂
1320423425689735170 2020-10-26 01:54:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MarvKard @bright1082 The task now is to get the word out about the only recourse we have left to get out of this before it's too late, mass recall. To that end, we must educate any who may yet be convinced of the threat. We no longer have time to spar with deniers.
1320422670589173765 2020-10-26 01:51:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @subjen32 @banthebbc  https://t.co/65MZx7vV6u
1320422199765979136 2020-10-26 01:49:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Angry_Okinawan Yes, that's very common. We're so far along now that I don't believe we should try to convince anyone who isn't openly inquiring or appears to be perplexed by some connected aspect. We must focus on the savable, it's triage. I'm not sure how much time is actually left.
1320421404890800128 2020-10-26 01:46:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wadefaber Yes, I'm only now beginning to fathom how uncommon my exposure is to all of this information.
1320420971765993472 2020-10-26 01:44:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @js100js100 @Atters68 Not saying it's not. I have a copy from watchtowers. For the sake of ironclad authenticity in the thread, I was looking for a direct link to an internal document which actually resides on a rockefeller server.
1320420326795321346 2020-10-26 01:41:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Angry_Okinawan We need them to wake up so I'm putting together a data set which I hope will expose them to enough information to convince them of threat without overloading them. That's the purpose of the request for ironclad links to those topics. Lockstep is an important opening reference.
1320419501972795392 2020-10-26 01:38:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MarvKard @bright1082 I guess what I'm saying is that I accept that we are actually currently in a crisis. Having access to all of the feeds from my followers was instrumental in my ability to arrive at this conclusion though, many of my deductions have been based largely on former knowledge.

1320413681105227779 2020-10-26 01:15:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 This is good, I will include it in the videos compilation.
1320413020523274245 2020-10-26 01:12:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SeanRyno1 @efreshwater5 @GforAnarchy12 The world has been captured by a global totalitarian corporativist state and we have been forcibly transformed into a command economy. National and local bureaucracies are being used to enact and enforce its edicts in complete defiance of any and all constitutional restrictions.
1320412275962937344 2020-10-26 01:09:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @js100js100 @Atters68 Yeah, that's also an external copy. Good to have another one though, thanks.

1320411528122826752 2020-10-26 01:06:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MarvKard @bright1082 I've been on firehose from the beginning. It's difficult but, I'm so used to it now, I guess I took it for granted that everyone must bite the bullet and they just used an alt to consume twibble. Stay on top and it's possible to process, walk away for week and it's start again.
1320410522332942336 2020-10-26 01:02:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Atters68 It's the best I have as well, some of the summaries might be better if authenticity can't be absolute. Let's see what folks come up with.

It happened way faster than I expected. We don't have time to squabble about minutiae anymore.
1320408369404981250 2020-10-26 00:54:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SeanRyno1 @efreshwater5 @GforAnarchy12 I've been trying to warn people about corporativism for years now. Corporativism is actually an ideology and government form. The state directs production through them. In this way the state evades all constitutional restrictions so as to direct a planned economy, now globally.  https://t.co/1iP8wErzHG
1320407000136798208 2020-10-26 00:48:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Angry_Okinawan Check out the other posts in my TL. I discovered that a lot of these high profile accounts that don't follow anyone are essentially totally unaware of what's going on. I'm trying to compile solid reference threads in an effort to rapid deprogram them and get them up to speed.
1320405701508943875 2020-10-26 00:43:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Atters68 I do have that, is it confirmed legit? I was kinda hoping for a direct link within rockefeller.
1320402378303090689 2020-10-26 00:30:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Next thing we need is a good set of official links to Lockstep, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, Great Reset, etc.  A solid link for Lockstep is needed to start the thread with.  Part of my problem is I'm using a sandboxed browser. We need text not applets for simplicity/universal access.
1320398106517790720 2020-10-26 00:13:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jeffdeist Here is a thread with links to official documentation to help get people up to speed on what's happening.  Next, I'll try to compile Lockstep, Agenda 21/2030, Great Reset, etc. materials.  Hope this helps, we could really use all the help we can get.   https://t.co/btSgJsnhDW
1320396666667749377 2020-10-26 00:07:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @bright1082 I'll try to post this thread to see how it does. I assume most won't DL a dropbox PDF so they'll probably only see the links.

1320393590426783746 2020-10-25 23:55:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I've been trying to explain to people that the "vaccine" is actually a gene therapy or at least is the evolution of the gene therapy programs halted in the 2000s due to immune response resulting in organ failure death.  More information on this would help.  https://t.co/us7bEqbXiC
1320391966165749763 2020-10-25 23:49:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This is a UK government document showing that COVID-19 was declared not a high consequence infectious disease in March.  "As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK."   https://t.co/iPRtMuBxyw
1320390515305684993 2020-10-25 23:43:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This shows summary report of studies proving masks don't work for viruses.  "In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (Figure 2).”   https://t.co/FOu7hpzumO
1320389455669350403 2020-10-25 23:39:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I have been using direct links to CDC documentation for the sake of credibility.  This shows fatality rates.  0-19 years: 0.00003 20-49 years: 0.0002 50-69 years: 0.005 70+ years: 0.054   https://t.co/uWhNoyBgp0
1320388611263651841 2020-10-25 23:35:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If anybody has links to summary documents, guides, etc. post them so we can go over them and figure out what combination might be most effective.  Here is one for review from @bright1082
1320387090849431552 2020-10-25 23:29:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @bright1082 Looks good, I have been linking the CDC data in case there is any doubt about authenticity. Even when doing that, many still won't accept the data much less the conclusions. I noticed the command economy back in April and reasoned that mass recall was our only hope to stop this.
1320385969145729029 2020-10-25 23:25:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @bright1082 OK, Dling now. I was trying to use a dedicated browser with everything off. Obviously, it has an applet.
1320384700981137411 2020-10-25 23:20:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FourVector8 @HansGruber420 @chazdezmend @FreeStateNH Primary thing is to stay away from cities. This is a global totalitarian corporativist state so there won't be anywhere that is actually safe. It can't hurt to be in traditionally freer areas though.
1320384193503891462 2020-10-25 23:18:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @bright1082 Doesn't seem to do much, is it just an image or is there a document to download?
1320382531125084169 2020-10-25 23:11:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FourVector8 @HansGruber420 @chazdezmend @FreeStateNH Lower population density, more land to retreat to if necessary.
1320382133924495360 2020-10-25 23:10:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @bright1082 That's tough, most of the best sources aren't even on the platform anymore. For efficiency, I would start them on videos from the three Cs: Corbett, Cullen, and Coleman. Trying to figure out if having them start with early videos so they can see the evolution of the logic helps.
1320381235533893632 2020-10-25 23:06:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Still a possibility, maybe even a guarantee for some of them. But I don't think they're all pod-people. lol
1320379092630458370 2020-10-25 22:58:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I seriously considered that as well. It was one of the 'unimportant' reasons I referred to earlier.
1320378764610719744 2020-10-25 22:56:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @bright1082 Of that I'm sure. Still, we need them to wake up. Maybe if everyone picked one and tried to bring them up to speed. Keep track of what works/what doesn't so we learn some applicable lessons in field deprogramming. Could be very useful practice for engaging normies in the wild.
1320377636850487297 2020-10-25 22:52:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Explains a weird phenomenon I can only call a 'digital blank stare' when making an off-hand comment about something and not seeming to evoke the expected response. They must've thought I was nuts, lol. Maybe we can use them as test subjects for rapid deprogramming in real world.
1320372598434390016 2020-10-25 22:32:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's somewhat comforting in that I'd been trying to figure out how so many people who really should understand what's happening weren't seeming to. I was starting to think it might be chemical interventions in prescriptions or something in the water. Seriously, I was mystified.
1320370994196918279 2020-10-25 22:25:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @98Simply 😺
1320370858804842496 2020-10-25 22:25:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm not sure if there's anything that can be done about it. Twitter doesn't allow you to just follow everyone back who follows you if it's a lot so they can never actually catch up. They've missed all of the significant events if this is true. At least we know how it happened. 😔

1320368696452435968 2020-10-25 22:16:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @plutoslovechild I think it's true of a lot of them. They've traded the old model for insularity for a new one. I've been trying to figure out how so many people that ought to understand what's happening don't seem to. I was starting to think it might be chemical, like prescriptions or something.
1320367104722407430 2020-10-25 22:10:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HansGruber420 @chazdezmend @FreeStateNH Still, it probably makes sense to start moving in a northward direction if you can.
1320365755918131200 2020-10-25 22:05:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Didn't really sink in until now but, all those high-profile accounts that don't follow people simply don't have access to most of the information available. Even if the people themselves would understand, they've cordoned themselves off, inadvertently insulated from information.
1320356416511746048 2020-10-25 21:27:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jeffdeist This is what we've been talking about for the last 7 months.

Sense of urgency imparted is an unavoidable consequence of this mode of communication. Hoping to prompt others to herald as well.
1320342226430578688 2020-10-25 20:31:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Remember that people unexposed to the madness will be unlikely to believe what the media says out loud. I know I wouldn't if I didn't see it for myself. So, you'll also have to save the demented examples of propaganda and public hysteria as proof, else they mightn't believe you.
1320339711769104384 2020-10-25 20:21:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> People online who don't already see what's happening aren't likely to come around now. There's just not enough time and they've presumably heaped on personal stakes to their faith. Those offline and don't consume popular media are probably the last bastion/best hope for humanity.
1320337121891307521 2020-10-25 20:11:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DarvisRobert It could be like sneaking out at night. Once they get used to it and for as long as it's verboten, they'll crave it.
1320335881677529090 2020-10-25 20:06:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> While the loss of this platform would be a blow in terms of amplitude and distributive reach, localization of efforts would make converts in your direct vicinity. This is important as any mass recall will necessarily involve your immediate neighbors. It will be up to you.

They would technically violate edicts so would provide a little adrenaline rush however slight without actually being dangerous. Maybe we can get people hooked on defiance.

1320329683809062916 2020-10-25 19:41:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm thinking anyone who doesn't get it pretty much right way on here is a lost cause for a variety of unimportant reasons. I think local watch parties could be productive endeavors. Both because it would defy policy and acclimate people to each other once again. Also might work.

1320270379311636485 2020-10-25 15:46:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest Mass recall is the only option we have.
1320270260361187330 2020-10-25 15:45:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest There is no future in politics. It's important to understand that as we go forward.
1320270003191644162 2020-10-25 15:44:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wadefaber So far, in the states where county officials have defied edicts, the states have drawn up new legislation making it possible to summarily remove them from their positions and replace them with cooperative administrators, elections be damned.
1320269396544278529 2020-10-25 15:42:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest Mass recall is the only solution we have at this point.
1320269168780972033 2020-10-25 15:41:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wadefaber This is generally understood to be mythological. That said, I would rather have popular mythology which supports the idea of liberty than not. County officials are likely to have access to much useful evidence supporting treasonous plans by states. They'll be welcome allies.
1320268294750863363 2020-10-25 15:37:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wadefaber I believe county officials will be some of our greatest allies in mass recall.
1320267958447448064 2020-10-25 15:36:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest There is no evidence of that as much as we would all like to believe it. Had that been true, we would not be in this situation.
1320267615164682240 2020-10-25 15:35:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest All politics is proved to be deleterious. Any solution which suggests the maintenance or adjustment of policy as a corrective fails to recognize this undeniable fact. Mass recall alone provides the legal recourse which will remove the hostile elements destructive to society.
1320266577695154176 2020-10-25 15:30:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wadefaber There exists no law enforcement or judicial construct which will revolt against their superiors. If they would, they would be considered insubordinate regardless of their absolute righteousness. The only body which is theoretically superior to legislators is the american people.
1320265750200942594 2020-10-25 15:27:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest There is no legislative response to tyranny. It's kind of definitional that way.
1320265302316298243 2020-10-25 15:25:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @wadefaber That's what they want. 'Protests' give them the opportunity and justification for further erosion of liberty in the eyes of the meek and uninformed.
1320264820793462785 2020-10-25 15:23:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest BLM are communist agitators whose intent is simply the destruction of society. They are chaoticians and, as far as I can tell, are enabled by the state. They are simply another paramilitary wing of the bureaucracy allowed to operate freely until it becomes useful to subdue them.
1320264076447145985 2020-10-25 15:20:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest Not focusing blame on them. It's clearly the apparatus which is the problem. While I don't specifically blame nor do I forgive. Since they have the option of resigning, not even self-preservation stands as a mitigating factor. Remaining plea is loss of income which we all endure.
1320262288989949952 2020-10-25 15:13:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest The only real difference is that the gang member probably really will be killed summarily if he fails to perform the task while the state agent, in most cases, likely has the option of resigning. Soon even that option will no longer be available to the state agent. Not much time.
1320261770573959173 2020-10-25 15:11:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FreedomDaBest The same can be said for all manner of torturers and executioners throughout history. It's no different than the gang member who must kill the innocent pregnant woman in order to get the important tattoo. Such assertions are of no consequence when measured by objective morality.
1320254652332544005 2020-10-25 14:43:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Most important thing to do right now is to talk about mass recall with everyone you can. Do it openly and honestly, listen to objections, consider alternatives. I've yet to be convinced that it isn't the sole path left available to us. It can't happen if people don't want it to.
1320250318395932672 2020-10-25 14:26:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Many town, county and state officials are sympathetic to the american people. They have jobs right now and can't do much as individuals in those positions. They can assist by informing the public of treasonous plans or intent to commit violence on the part of their superiors.
1320246610094424066 2020-10-25 14:11:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ac_wildcard If people aren't willing to conduct mass recall then it won't happen. If they are, it will. This has nothing to do with political affiliation. This is one of the most important aspects of the procedure. It can't happen unless it will happen correctly. It is not civil strife.
1320245213747621889 2020-10-25 14:06:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Once we have removed all sitting officials at the town level, the task will be to get the county officials to step down. Local officials who cooperate will be essential in conducting that stage peacefully as well. Then state officials, cities will have to be ignored at first.
1320243864939147264 2020-10-25 14:00:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Shit_Haus_Mouse No worries, there are folks who are just tasked by god to address certain specific issues too so I should have clarified that. There's but the one true path to liberty, mass recall. We need to focus.
1320243346443542528 2020-10-25 13:58:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ac_wildcard If we all conduct peaceful town level civil rebellions, we will be dealing with local officials who will be our family, friends, and neighbors. This will eliminate the need for any violence at all. Many local officials will happily step down and assist us with county and state.
1320241389444222983 2020-10-25 13:50:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> My understanding of the plan to enslave humanity includes extensive expectation of unrest/protesting. In my opinion, all of it works against the achievement of the ultimate goal of liberty. There's only one way out of this, mass recall. Anything else will power their propaganda.
1320240464403058689 2020-10-25 13:47:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FlibirtyGibbet @ksorbs Yes, The Law should be first on everyone's list.

1320238961290301445 2020-10-25 13:41:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you're worried about whether government will allow you to do something peaceful voluntarily, I can save you a lot of time by informing you of the answer to your question. No, it won't. All efforts to enact allowances are tacit acceptance of subjugation anyway, self-defeating.
1320235310983372800 2020-10-25 13:26:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel For one thing, all these protests and appeals to authority for 'allowances' all work against the basic purposes of liberation. It's not that we want permission to do anything. We want the idea that official permission is needed to do anything peaceful voluntarily to be abolished.
1320233737574109184 2020-10-25 13:20:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel Yup, I'm anti-abortion but, it's not a primary issue for me atm other than to excoriate those who advocate/defend it. And some people are just tasked to address particular issues so I should clarify that as well. I mostly mean the other 10,000 trifles like "legalizing" whatever.
1320231426802012165 2020-10-25 13:11:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I don't want to be a dick but, if you're complaining about something a lot and it's one of your central issues, not merely a jab every once in a while to make a point, ask yourself if the thing is actually significant compared to the existential threats to our very existence. 🤔

1320208218572947458 2020-10-25 11:39:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @checkmatestate @suchan104 That's pretty much where I was before I started down the rabbit hole this year. It's pretty bad, it's not even completely clear that the tapering off of outbreaks for the major success stories were even really due to the vaccines and not herd immunity. Key issue is key though.

There should be a recognition that capitalism has been eviscerated almost completely. These people are fighting a vague undefined memory of an unrealized ideal.

1319999899837095936 2020-10-24 21:51:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JediTransition What is a concern is pollution and that's aggravated by government, not private industry, at least not unsubsidized private industry existing in the constraints of property rights. Most of that becomes irrelevant with nuclear but, the state has been preventing its widespread use.
1319998577092005890 2020-10-24 21:45:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JediTransition It's around 8 billion to round it up and we could comfortably accommodate 10s of billions to round it down substantially. If we continue to develop technologically there's no reason we couldn't easily house a hundred billion by the time it matters. All without harming the planet.

1319994061340725256 2020-10-24 21:28:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JediTransition 😄 I had done a rough estimate and there are between 4500 and 5000 cities in the world averaging 250 square miles each. Rough estimate is around 1 million square miles in total of high density population.  It's astonishing that many people believe the 'crowded earth' conspiracy.

1319988928364056576 2020-10-24 21:07:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LarsonKellie There's no mechanism for federal government to override local mass recalls except to declare open war against the american people due to our reconsideration of our local political representatives. Doing so would, among other things, reveal it was never legitimate to begin with.
1319986105794629633 2020-10-24 20:56:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Based on these assumptions, I see no reason to oppose either methodology nor do I see any cause for concern or danger of conflict in enacting both procedures simultaneously. I think it's necessary to fully describe the goals of each to safely and successfully meet in the middle.
1319985059512856578 2020-10-24 20:52:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If Trump is on the side of the american people liberating ourselves, there should be no conflict from his top-down approach to removing all sitting officials in high positions while we remove all sitting officials in low positions through entirely legitimate local mass recalls.
1319984058496094212 2020-10-24 20:48:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If, as is frequently asserted, Trump has no jurisdiction over local government and is therefore unable to assist us in liberating ourselves from local tyranny, it should not be a problem if we recall our local governments en masse regardless of the results of this election.

However, a global totalitarian corporativist state is currently occupying the world. Mass recall is our only real hope.

1319946593576062976 2020-10-24 18:19:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jonathanbyrd22 Idea is that no government could claim consent with all of its towns in open but orderly revolt, ignore cities. The central government cannot simply declare open war against the general population and, if it did, it would not last long. If it would, better to know now than later.
1319946009540251648 2020-10-24 18:17:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jonathanbyrd22 Gather 500-1000 families and mass recall all sitting officials in your town. From there ask county and state officials to step down. Needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but, it's the only thing that will work. Then, assess situation, begin to rebuild society.

The existence of psychopaths is estimated to be around 1% which is not enough to account for all of them though, it may account for a substantial part of politically active component.

However, it's difficult to establish this as fact right now so, it would likely be ineffective.

1319925339745865735 2020-10-24 16:54:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm suggesting that, for those who recognize what is happening, such activity is clearly nothing more than virtue signaling at this point with no possibility of changing hearts and minds. What's a possible effective strategy for bringing people on board the mass recall movement?
1319924164799639552 2020-10-24 16:50:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I was unable to get that point through to many after years of attempts using everything from logic and hypothetical examples to analogies and metaphors, cool rationality and heated emotion. Wasting time on that approach is now dangerous considering how little time may be left.
1319923008581083137 2020-10-24 16:45:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I appreciate the enthusiasm for liberty as a philosophical topic. Favorite question was why government, which took so much during your working life, should be trusted to control your healthcare at your most vulnerable age when allowing you to die would solve all of its problems?
1319913443043016704 2020-10-24 16:07:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @opalessense ♥️🤔 Hard to deny there's something to this. I'm generally focusing on practical basic response but,  this needs to be fully investigated once we restore free society and save human civilization. No existing law enforcement or judicial system will help, that much seems obvious.

1319848494195220480 2020-10-24 11:49:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We need to achieve the next stage of popular awareness of the mortal threat to human civilization represented by current administrative bureaucracies at all levels everywhere. While austrian economists have never been mainstream, not having them understand this is devastating.
1319847081197129728 2020-10-24 11:44:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I encourage those who already see this underlying truth to now analyze the particular actors in today's measurable world economy. I understand that it's a stretch to ask theoreticians to make practical analyses outside of their 'wheelhouse' but, it's time to apply this knowledge.
1319845961506693122 2020-10-24 11:39:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Austrian economics has long explained why it might be in the interests of elite existing market dominators to discourage/prevent new competition and sabotage continuing inventive developments. The state and, in corporativism corporations, are the mechanism by which this is done.

1319841634985664513 2020-10-24 11:22:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> All popular notions of the benefits of reduced population are based on false notion that the world is or will be like the life of city-dwellers. They are artificial constructs and, especially now that we have such effective decentralized resources and communications, superfluous.

1319840148457181186 2020-10-24 11:16:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you believe that chief problem facing humanity is size of population, you're a de facto genocidalist. The question is only whether you subscribe to and/or participate in the practical application of that ideology. If you're merely a victim of the thought, reason can save you.

That's the message that needs to be shared before they shut off effective communication. The world can only be saved locally, the challenge is arranging simultaneity. Cheers- 🍻

1319828107851956224 2020-10-24 10:28:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I've presented my assessment of what I expect to happen and what the worst they could do is. Neither would result in their victory. Sounds like you're assuming they'll do their worst and try to murder everybody. Not impossible but, also not practical nor effective as a strategy.
1319827408569143296 2020-10-24 10:25:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon @HenryLindeman9 ♥️ I have an alt but, I can still tweet on this one. I just can't like or RT. At least not directly, I can paste a tweet URL so I can theoretically still RT. It just makes me focus on tweeting.
1319826953701101568 2020-10-24 10:24:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Mass recall is the towns which comprise the entirety of suburbs.
1319826636305584128 2020-10-24 10:22:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CeciliaGlennon @HenryLindeman9 ♥️ Again 🙄
1319826515970957312 2020-10-24 10:22:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Again, you're assuming that central government declares open war against the general population outside of cities. If we conduct mass recall, they would be essentially defeated immediately from a strategic standpoint. It doesn't mean they won't convulse in death throws though.
1319825091132334080 2020-10-24 10:16:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 If so, I say let them. I believe that's a losing strategy. Imagine having to airlift supplies to every city. Again, this assumes that the central government discards all pretense and declares open war against the general population, something I don't think would happen.
1319824005940105216 2020-10-24 10:12:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Maybe, I'd like to hear a well-reasoned explanation for why disabling and not assuming control is preferable. I say that because tools are tools, it only matters what they are used to for. There might be some exceptions to that but, not many.
1319821829381423104 2020-10-24 10:03:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Cities are lost causes and should be ignored for mass recall. If they remained hostile to the population, they would not be in a position to do much. No siege would be necessary, just twiddle thumbs until they collapse. Hoping that people will follow the masses and abandon them.
1319820592632242176 2020-10-24 09:58:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 It's the only solution I have come up with that is peaceful and it's also actually entirely within reason from a legal and a practical standpoint. The reason we must enact mass recall locally is that we have no confidence in good faith of legislators. Only thing that will work.

1319816605715599360 2020-10-24 09:42:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Yes, I just think we'll need to officially remove consent. With all towns in open but orderly revolt, no government could claim consent. They won't declare open war against the population and if they do it would be better to find that out now than allow any further consolidation.
1319816021184794624 2020-10-24 09:40:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KratomAID That thread of videos gets better in terms of specifying that this is a communist agenda. Not that the Malthusian Mandate wasn't good btw, just that the anti-specialization and anti-trade aspects rub me the wrong way. I call this global totalitarian corporativism  (socialism.)

1319813530644787200 2020-10-24 09:30:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 ♥️ Yes, that's the only solution. The only way to do it peacefully is mass recall. Once we're all towns again, we can proceed in a decentralized way to rebuild our civilization. Ant other way just attempts to get everyone to agree to a single system or order which is impossible.

I'm hoping the idea of mass recall will take hold before we all get shut off from these platforms entirely. As long as the idea gets out to enough people, there's hope.
1319812177914695682 2020-10-24 09:25:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KratomAID That's good, I think I've seen it before, and the thread of videos following are too.

1319581264446431233 2020-10-23 18:07:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @john_logical Not a time based thing either (db lag) because tweets can be hours old and still behave that way. With legacy interface I could spin up the cache during the time between being stalled and submitting. It'd only remove 1 from the field value. Sometimes 40 or 50 likes could post.
1319580178193022976 2020-10-23 18:03:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @john_logical ♥️ My guess based on experiments is that the applet is caching interactions so user will see them without updating the table. If you zoom a virgin tweet after liking it and the number 1 isn't displayed, unchecking will show -1 likes. Close it, re-like and zoom and it will be 1.

I keep discovering replies in the wild that I never received notifications for. Likes are obviously being deleted and I even found a hidden retweet, something I thought was basically impossible.

It used to be as simple saying; "Look, if the government said take this pill, it's free. Would you take it? No, so why wouldn't you question a guy on the street or a major corporation?"  Now, people just say "gulp."

Giving away free flu shots, for example, doesn't really have a 'profit' phase for corporations. Sometimes what seems like a pretext is simply the naked goal.

Who knows? What I find convincing is the consistency of the various predictions from all angles whether from those in favor or against population reduction. That and their age.
1319520696121368577 2020-10-23 14:07:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @123prometheus @JonahofNinevah I take in all of the analyses I come across as worthy of note without attributing any sort of scale for legitimacy. In part this is because I've never been able to actually confirm any documentation other than the UN, WHO and WEF stuff. But, all of that stuff is scary as hell.

It's not that science is somehow misrepresentative of the true nature of physical being but that it's been accepted as the whole of being. That nothing further than physical being is real.

It's an anticapitalist ideology and government form in and of itself. It's a planned economy, a form of socialism.

The rest are at best with covid-19 or erroneous reports. That's what the big scandal was when the CDC had to admit the real numbers. The fact that media are not making you aware of this should concern you.

Last time I looked up that particular statistic it was something like 3 months to live. There's nothing saying that someone who tested positive for SARS-COv2 didn't die with flu either.

1319282727355465728 2020-10-22 22:21:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @breeder_steve @Freedom76025251 @TheAliceSmith Think 'nationality,' it used to be synonymous with ethnic origin, tribe, or clan.
1319281907243180033 2020-10-22 22:18:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hardrockbus ♥️ Well, anyone in government is a lost cause but, there are people who belong to borderline academic institutions who I can imagine are both heavily programmed but also intelligent enough to notice that something is very wrong. They hear nothing about it so that's problem 1.
1319280898689298433 2020-10-22 22:14:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hardrockbus ♥️😁 That would be nice, yes. I did try shaming the austrian econ crowd already with limited results so, I am not hopeful that overt hostility is the most productive avenue to explore.
1319280294571110403 2020-10-22 22:11:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SpiritWild42 @Flimsy_AF Thanks for piping up, it's the first step to finding out what's going on. You've got a lot of researching to do and probably a lot of deprogramming first to be able to do it but, humanity needs defending. There are many people who can help you understand. Hope you decide to help.

Regulatory capture, while real in mixed economy, is illusory here as the state dictates corporate policy.

We frequently program ourselves, establishing a constructive work ethic, healthful diet, or helpful schedule being the most obvious examples. Good programming is not harmed by analysis.

Failures in particular are most important to document/detail to minimize dead ends.
1319204150148845568 2020-10-22 17:09:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Use the resources we still have while we still have them to communicate the direness of the situation with sufficient emphasis to prompt attention. Hysteria the tool of tyrants, not logicians. Any degeneration of communication into irrationality can only serve the totalitarians.

1319202242910707712 2020-10-22 17:01:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's very likely that many people we would've wanted to reach are already gone from these platforms. They will only be reachable by those around them when and if this culminates in the information crackdown we all assume is coming and, frankly, are already experiencing somewhat.
1319201427273764866 2020-10-22 16:58:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> One major advantage we have is that it's unlikely any such agents are very intelligent due to the selection process so, some relatively simple tests on wit may very well be all that's necessary to detect them. But, again, remaining grounded and speaking truth cannot be assailed.
1319199923846434816 2020-10-22 16:52:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Because they really can't be detected with any certainty, much like with undercover drug agents, prudence and not terror is the only reasonable course of action. Part of their function in both cases is to sew discord and distrust among their targets. In this way, it is nullified.

1319198925153169409 2020-10-22 16:48:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> As the true nature of this attack becomes clear, Milgram's hypothesis or not, even stormtroopers will have a breaking point. I'm of the mind that they should be welcomed if and when they do turn on their masters. Say what needs to be said and don't fall for antagonistic taunts.
1319197788337590273 2020-10-22 16:43:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Here's a breakdown of my logic regarding "feds." It's important to remember that it's likely that such agents are human beings and, therefore, able to be convinced by the materials which they are tasked to interfere with. Do not fear stating facts, fear only being manipulated.
1319195843937865729 2020-10-22 16:36:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Worth mentioning that statistics generated by twitter reveal a substantially larger number of people are likely interacting with your content than you're being told. While it's better than the content itself being suppressed, it's demoralizing. Just know that you're being heard.

I'm going to continue to spread the idea for the only solution I've come up with, mass recall. Maybe this can be headed off. I'm presuming that God will forgive me for trying to fight evil. Hopefully, I will spiritually ready if it comes to that.

1319182666160373760 2020-10-22 15:43:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez @MonicaPerezShow This is also a rather transparent untruth given my somewhat tempered hostility to your attitude and choice of communication mode. It's common to misrepresent an opponent's position as a means to elicit emotional reaction. This is a variant of the strawman attack, easily detected.
1319181606733709312 2020-10-22 15:39:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez @MonicaPerezShow I'm glad you're impressed. Generally, I would not recommend engaging with someone like yourself as it is typically a waste of time. That said, yours is a somewhat unusual case in that you have claimed knowledge on the subject from a credible source. The question now is motive.
1319180897619464193 2020-10-22 15:36:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez @MonicaPerezShow I can see that. I'm using your voluntary interaction to demonstrate the frequently encountered response to attempts to enlighten people to the threat we face in the near future. I'm also providing a template with which to interrogate such a person to determine their authenticity.
1319179902676094977 2020-10-22 15:32:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez @MonicaPerezShow Do I sound like I'm joking?
1319179620307161088 2020-10-22 15:31:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez @MonicaPerezShow Again, likelihood that you are not being honest is nearly certain. It's possible for me be so sure of that because I have read the materials and nobody walks away blasé. They either deny it completely because it's so horrifically unbelievable or they're eager to confirm/debunk.
1319178526373892098 2020-10-22 15:27:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez @MonicaPerezShow I don't believe you. In this context, constructive jokes are of the fate of humanity, they're usually dark humor and generally not internally rivalrous. Attempts to cover poor choices by claiming jest are a default defense among the immature against challenges to one's awareness.
1319177727220514816 2020-10-22 15:24:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez @MonicaPerezShow See, there it is again. You felt the need to lie about your actually having read the indicated materials which is indicative of the sort of denial that I am interested in exposing. In truth, you dodged it by saying that you've heard it all before implying nonexistent awareness.
1319176937873510400 2020-10-22 15:21:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AdrianN62729285 ♥️📢

Jokes are fine and I think a necessary release valve and maybe even a critical tactic in penetrating through to those who are overly credulous toward corporate state sources of information. In this thread, I'm trying to get a measure of just how bad public denial is.
1319174834434285570 2020-10-22 15:12:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riceman79 @NotSweetDeeSez Case in point, thank you for the example. I can deduce several things from your comment which I will attempt to diagnose with minimal information.  1. You have not read any of the documentation about Lockstep, Event 201, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, or the Great Reset.  Please verify.
1319173495289483264 2020-10-22 15:07:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you're still snorting and rolling your eyes, you should consider that the programming you've received through state education, popular media, and possible chemical interventions voluntarily chosen or unbeknownst to you are the cause, not the questionability of any evidence.
1319172343240024065 2020-10-22 15:02:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's reasonable to focus attention on social media forums to reach as many as possible but, it's a race until they feel comfortable enough or threatened enough to shut it down. At that point, our efforts must switch to our family, friends, and neighbors. Silence is not an option.
1319171437484265472 2020-10-22 14:59:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BlondeKbf ♥️📢
1319171329615187968 2020-10-22 14:58:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If we lose the ability to communicate openly about the circumstances we find ourselves in it will become much more difficult to disseminate new information. The critical task at hand is to get as many people aware of the basic strategy for liberation, mass recall. You must speak.
1319170452527468554 2020-10-22 14:55:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you are remaining quiet out of fear of digital repercussions, understand that I too am waiting for the other shoe to drop but, while I still do have the ability to share what information and analyses I can, I must make use of the tools at my disposal for as long as I can.
1319169912955437056 2020-10-22 14:53:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We really don't have much time. Every flippant remark I hear further condemns the intelligence of the majority of the population. Maybe people are already virtually lobotomized but, I'd like some confirmation if that's the case. I can't stress enough that indifference is poison.
1319168096016498689 2020-10-22 14:45:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I keep making apparently unfounded assumptions about popular recognition of the horrific future which is planned for world humanity by the global totalitarian corporativist state. It would seem that many are still saying "they wouldn't do that." Not so.   https://t.co/5koCjx2qjk

From there, ask county and state officials to step down. Needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but it will work and it's the only thing that will.

1319105826821341189 2020-10-22 10:38:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> National governments are subverted and local governments are operating as subordinates in a command hierarchy instead of as representative bodies of their constituencies.  They are no longer valid. Their authorization is illegitimate. Our consent is withdrawn. Hence, mass recall.
1319103198347415555 2020-10-22 10:28:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Because local governments are essentially behaving as subordinates in a command hierarchy instead of a representative bodies of their constituencies, they are no longer valid, their authorization is illegitimate, consent is withdrawn.

1319102396530790400 2020-10-22 10:24:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It was never really meant to be anything more than a thought experiment to demonstrate to people how little they actually receive in service provision from the federal government which was the level at which he was speaking. Most services are local and would be unaffected.

1319100055421288449 2020-10-22 10:15:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @asavage963 It began with a demonstration of utility to citizens. Take the whole tax amount and divide it equally among citizens. At the time he talked about it, it was about $18,000 annually which would have been enough for most families considering the payments would be to each citizen.
1319099006253936640 2020-10-22 10:11:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Shawn_on_Games Mass recall.
1319098588161544192 2020-10-22 10:09:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @asavage963 ♥️ It was really a Milton Friedman idea which he called "reverse income tax." His basic premise was that you could eliminate all government employees except the ones who count the taxes and send the checks.
1319098185659318272 2020-10-22 10:08:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Shawn_on_Games ♥️ Yes, better to eliminate government entirely.

But, people have the idea that it would an additional "benefit" and not a substitute for existing government spending. That is, immediate cessation of all service provision.
1319097251092959234 2020-10-22 10:04:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @asavage963 Continually lower taxes and corresponding payments until the government is completely withdrawn from economic interventions of any kind.
1319096813937373186 2020-10-22 10:02:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm against the idea because it's just another shell game and we know they won't fire everybody employed by the government. But hearing it presented as anything other than a thought experiment is exasperating. 🤦‍♂️
1319096000481460224 2020-10-22 09:59:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Just to talk econ for a second, I should clarify something about so-called "UBI." Times it has been brought up by economists, it's been a speculative solution for complete replacement of government spending. Entire gross taxes given back in equal shares. Then, shrink until gone.

1319045409554223106 2020-10-22 06:38:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheAliceSmith As far as I can tell, they've modified RT submission routine to always begin with the quote form. It must be associated with some new suppression script. I'm used to like suppression and deletion but, I noticed a somewhat rare hidden retweet. It's in the user's TL but no RT stat.  https://t.co/wd8i85aMgm

1318874601229864960 2020-10-21 19:19:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Think about it and we'll put together a list of men and women who may fit the bill. I suppose there's no particular reason to limit this to a single selection either. We can listen to arguments in favor and against as any boons or disqualifying features are brought to attention.
1318873178991714304 2020-10-21 19:14:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Truth_Abides Another good potential candidate. 👍
1318869872609210368 2020-10-21 19:00:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @oilscalp She's definitely a strong candidate. 👍
1318869566081146881 2020-10-21 18:59:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I almost feel like drawing up a d&amp;d character or something to suss out a persona. If anyone wants to do something like that it might be helpful. Any features to be desired or avoided that you can think of which might help describe her are requested so as to instantiate this lady.
1318866855667388416 2020-10-21 18:48:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @oilscalp Interesting... 🤔
1318865854193348609 2020-10-21 18:44:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Being a mother would seem to be a requirement though, I can think of a few exceptions to that. Aside from knowledge and wisdom, both useful, advanced age may not be a requirement. Physical attractiveness doesn't seem like a factor. Life experience is probably the chief attribute.
1318864182037696514 2020-10-21 18:38:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Being rich already is no asset since we know that a person can never have enough money. Having power is probably a disqualifier since anyone with power likely sought it and is, therefore, of subhuman character. Religious leaders have similar flaws, few women amongst them anyway.

1318858708995264515 2020-10-21 18:16:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Thinking a woman might be best. Not because of any feminist bullshit reason but, because so far I've seen mostly women understanding the implications of this. I have to attribute it to maternal instinct or something, the innate ability to recognize a mortal threat to the species.
1318856199266250752 2020-10-21 18:06:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Who's the best candidate for a famous person to try to bring over to the side of humanity? Someone who might understand the big picture and not just see it as an opportunity for political or professional advancement to jump aboard as we get closer to being heard by normal people.
1318852417929314305 2020-10-21 17:51:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @2013Boodicca Global totalitarian corporativism is the specific term for it. It's helpful to know the technical designation because it provides the correct reference point for the historical lead up to what's happening. It also explains why it seems to be so coordinated with governments.

I think it will take great efforts to investigate the origins and piece it all together. For now, I can only see one solution, mass recall. I'm focusing on that as it's simple and needs to be known.
1318800425584386054 2020-10-21 14:24:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dentintheworld I think it must be connected to retweet suppression.

1318629203399610368 2020-10-21 03:04:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JohnRad15 @besf0rt No, and I'm against the state generally. If you oppose all government, why are we at odds at all? The basic underlying principle of any socialist order is the monopoly of violence claimed by the state. The supposed problems it is imagined to correct are actually its consequences.
1318628206111526917 2020-10-21 03:00:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JohnRad15 @besf0rt Rothbard addresses this pretty thoroughly as pollution is a form of aggression against the property of others. However, air itself is not currently considered a scarce resource as such so the two issues are not the same.
1318627616740548619 2020-10-21 02:58:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JohnRad15 @besf0rt I strongly oppose all forms of socialism and corporativism is particularly nasty. Just about every complaint attributed to capitalism is actually the product of some state intervention.

I won't say there aren't issues with land as a problem though so maybe there is some room for conversation. I am sure that those problems are far in the distant future, not crises.

In a planned economy, taxation is superfluous, much like taxing government employees, you can't pay yourself.

1318475396057354240 2020-10-20 16:53:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @zerohedge In corporativism, the state can't allow one of its critical policy arms to be amputated. If it must sacrifice one of its instruments, it will have another ready to go in its place. If possible, management is simply replaced allowing for the appearance of corrective action.

1318373750463750144 2020-10-20 10:09:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If and when a particular corporation is exposed or gets caught doing something which the public recognizes as criminal, it is thrown under the bus, "private industry" is blamed, and a replacement is erected in its place. I think we'll see that with Bill Gates in the near future.
1318371940134957061 2020-10-20 10:02:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> As of today, I believe it's undeniable that the whole world is captured by a global totalitarian corporativist state. It's central plan is the course that's followed by all megacorporations worldwide. It can therefore go undetected as global government just as it does nationally.

1318370264648908807 2020-10-20 09:55:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It may appear that the decidedly nefarious actions of these megacorporations are simply the corrupt ends of individuals in charge for monetary gain or to exercise ideological influence, the real story is the puppet masters behind these corporate figureheads, the central planners.
1318369094677237760 2020-10-20 09:51:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If a corporation doesn't play ball, it's eviscerated by regulators/legislatures and replaced by a more compliant organization. Sometimes simply replacing a CEO or masthead of a corporation is sufficient to achieve the ends sought by the state. This is public-private partnership.
1318368639058411520 2020-10-20 09:49:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> A free market would otherwise displace bad actors if not for state subsidy and deterrent regulations which prevent new competition. It's simplest to consider all large corporations to be virtual departments or agencies of the government because that is exactly what they are.
1318368104502755328 2020-10-20 09:47:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In this way the state can wholly evade accountability for its interventions in the economy by blaming the manipulations and monopoly power on the "private industry." In fact, that monopoly power is only possible by the interventions by the state in markets preventing competition.
1318367648422465538 2020-10-20 09:45:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The truth is that corporativism is a form of socialism and it's end is to control production just as any totalitarian system has as its object, to plan the economy. The state dictates through its regulations and policies what corporations can and will do.
1318367364262539264 2020-10-20 09:44:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It may seem as though these corporations are being preferential as the subject here acknowledges. The behavior and policies of a corporation appear to be chaotic and may at one time lean one way and at another time a different way causing confusion and doubt about their agenda.

1318258499789475842 2020-10-20 02:31:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Cunningham Strategy noted several significant disparities between data collected in Yasutake's survey and the available GIS database indicating probable military designation. It was becoming clear that this was not just a biostore and they no longer had the element of surprise.😲
1318252700677570560 2020-10-20 02:08:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In tandem with Rand peace envoy, Yasutake Reconnaissance conducted an extensive survey of the island and close inspection of the shoreline producing high resolution topographical maps with arial lidar and photography. Ground penetrating radar considered too risky if detected.

1318231782639259648 2020-10-20 00:45:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Stage 1 negotiation contract is put forward against the recommendations of many but, ultimately, Paul Diplomacy is selected to attempt to gain access through negotiations risking alerting operators to its detection. Increased shares awarded to Wallace if diplomacy mission fails.

With only private interests, I can't see investing the kind of resources necessary to deploy weapons of mass destruction. Idea is to capture and sell off recovered assets so, destruction necessarily kept to a minimum.
1318224917603770371 2020-10-20 00:18:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Suspicious comms detected from an island in the Pacific by Wright Aviation. The find quickly posts to the prospect arbitration net and Wallace, already a veteran in the market, is favored to win the contract.  A lot is riding on this find as it's thought to be a pharma biostore.

The free world is already rebuilt following removal of sitting officials in all positions across all governments in all countries on all continents. Without state subsidy/protection, corporations are bankrupt.  'Bunker hunting' is a booming industry.

Understand, even if they are forced to back off, the agenda is clear, the state is a relentless enemy of humanity.

Once they established that, you could cite the precedent and tax anything. Christmas presents, donated labor, singing, etc. Almost any voluntary interaction at all.

The first time I saw a "scheduled" lockdown my eyes rolled back into my visual cortex. If a deadly pathogen is loose, you would freeze in current location, like the school, library, or auto shop, perhaps for days.

Who is allowed to sell what and where and who is allowed to work on what and where but you're right, shepherding consumer choice directly also qualifies.

1318048369265213440 2020-10-19 12:36:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BlastbeatATX ♥️ Yeah, I keep thinking about John Titor's wifi net. I assume it could be disrupted or penetrated but, long cat 5e runs are pretty cheap so maybe that would be the best for local comms. I haven't tossed my old routers and switches just in case.
1318047623010537472 2020-10-19 12:33:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NalaWasHere Oh well, it does let me do one thing every so often. I have been using it to follow back but, I need to remember that I can use it for a like if I want.  https://t.co/ETYBDzJcHl
1318047242452897793 2020-10-19 12:32:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NalaWasHere Wait, my like just worked.
1318046796061474816 2020-10-19 12:30:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> What I'm afraid of is loss of communication. If that happens, I think we need as many people to be aware of mass recall as possible so that there is at least a chance that the idea can propagate locally well enough to take hold. Many people think it's all about politics or death.
1318045653642190848 2020-10-19 12:25:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NalaWasHere ♥️ Perhaps but, we probably all have exposure to the full range if you include friends as well as family.

1318044534274740224 2020-10-19 12:21:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NalaWasHere ♥️🧐 Probably a good strategy but, it leaves them in control of the topic. Since most of the topics they pick are nonsense, I end up seeming to be aloof.

1318040734633762816 2020-10-19 12:06:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NalaWasHere ♥️Yeah, I've gone through the cycle a couple of times. I keep coming back to the fact that it just can't be left undone, the stakes are just too high. I do back off and then come back with a good analogy or explain that knowledge is actually better than ignorance, etc. Still try.

1318038406899826688 2020-10-19 11:56:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think we should be trying to deprogram our families. It's a critical point of failure that's so high on the danger meter that it must be done. For friends and casual acquaintances, they need to at least know that mass recall is our only hope. Maybe just joke about it is best.

Specifically the flu but SARS-COv2 is actually physically smaller. They've know this the whole time.

"In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (Figure 2).”   https://t.co/FOu7hpzumO

It's really unbelievable as an idea in and of itself but, the psychological implications and agenda its distracting from are ominous. Not to mention the hostile division it created out of thin air, diabolical.

There are other great works but those will give you everything you need, especially Human Action. The first two are pretty short in comparison and precede HA in time.

The fact that they've been able to destroy most private businesses and individual wealth in a short 6 months should be convincing enough to look at the evidence.

Start with the "lockstep" document and then read the descriptions for agenda 21 and agenda 2030 which detail the specific goals and the targeted years for their achievement.

1317820712946749443 2020-10-18 21:31:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jonflombee @TTDerandere I would assume some lower quality specimens could be allocated for certain tasks which would be intolerable for high IQ humans.

Somewhat less concrete evidence suggests 30 years and by conjecture at least 70 years.

1317754581418414084 2020-10-18 17:09:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AndreaBotos2 ♥️ (in twitter jail so I can't like or RT) I think mass recall is our only option at this point. As soon as it becomes clear that he can't/won't help because he's either complicit or under duress, I want people to know what the next step is. This is a global problem, not just US.
1317753583492829185 2020-10-18 17:05:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @realDonaldTrump I think that one really was mostly site wide. Though, I can't help noticing it wiped a whole mess of stats away. 🙄 But, as you say, not the end of the world. 😉
1317752721492029440 2020-10-18 17:01:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @realDonaldTrump I'm certainly not advocating voting for anyone else. I just think he's either complicit or under duress of some kind. I don't hold hope but maybe I'm wrong so I also won't dash hopes for others. I only ask that people mass recall if/when it becomes clear that he can't/won't help.
1317743151579353090 2020-10-18 16:23:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @realDonaldTrump ♥️ I'm currently in twitter jail again so I can't like or RT btw.
1317742205562486784 2020-10-18 16:19:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @realDonaldTrump I have seen no evidence of this so far in the 4 years he has been in supposed control of the country. If he doesn't have the power to effect any change to combat this threat and appears to be supporting the key players of it, the sooner we discard false hopes the better.

1317736199012962304 2020-10-18 15:56:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Only things that've changed are the restrictions have worsened and we now know that the fatality rate is at least an order of magnitude below what was already insufficient justification for any of this. It's now 6 months later and people are still not getting it?  Mass recall.
1317730107029622789 2020-10-18 15:31:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 I will put up another thread about peaceful town level civil rebellion but, that is the only solution to this that I know of. Mass recall is the sole recourse available to us at this point.

1317724337382838272 2020-10-18 15:08:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Trinity_X_ ♥️ I keep thinking it's understood only to discover that so many are either not aware or, worse, indifferent to the threat as if it's just another temporary stunt. Like it's merely an evolution of the political theatre we're so numbed by and that it just seems worse than it is.
1317723134968139778 2020-10-18 15:04:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 Indifference is poison.
1317723044907986944 2020-10-18 15:03:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 You're close enough to libertarians in your understanding to forego continued discussion with them on minor details of whatever system you're hopeful to have someday. Right now, we're at war for our lives against a real and very deadly foe. That's what we should be talking about.
1317722274972209152 2020-10-18 15:00:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In case anyone hasn't noticed, the world is currently occupied by a global totalitarian corporativist world order which is using national and local bureaucracies to enforce its edicts in complete defiance of constitutional, legislative, medical, scientific or logical procedures.
1317719916146008064 2020-10-18 14:51:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 Are you aware that the world is currently occupied by a global totalitarian corporativist world order?
1317719454105690112 2020-10-18 14:49:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 If you don't want anything to change, I'm not sure you should call yourself a libertarian. How do you expect anyone to come around if you don't make an effort. How many people do you know who have more information than you do? Are they also not screaming from the rooftops?
1317717999239991296 2020-10-18 14:43:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 The analogy is based on the fact that the lifeguards know how to save lives and can see the sharks coming. Not saying anything or not sitting in the high chair so as not to see the warning fins is the irresponsible part.
1317717454227972096 2020-10-18 14:41:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 It's a lesser slog with lower stakes outside of the family so if that's where it's possible, focus your efforts there. I have realized though that it is the family that will hand you over to the state to be murdered so convincing them seems like the most important immediate task.
1317716813258592257 2020-10-18 14:39:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Johnbeavers19 ♥️
1317716729066303488 2020-10-18 14:38:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 ♥️ It's definitely not going to happen without information. I appreciate just how hard this is. I've been only marginally successful and I've been at it for 7 months. I think it's probably easier outside of the family but, it's family that will turn you over to be incinerated.

I want those who have information that can help share it with people who don't have it, not endlessly squabble over minutiae amongst ourselves. Start with family and go from there.
1317707796117413888 2020-10-18 14:03:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 ♥️ Yes, life is full of pain and difficulty, even misery. It's a lot better than being a pile of ashes in a crematorium, that I can assure you. We hold at least part of the solution and failure to disseminate that information to people who have no clue is wildly irresponsible.
1317706509846011904 2020-10-18 13:58:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @archers6 6 people who supposedly understand how we might avert disaster, yes. If 6 lifeguards are jacking off in the corner while all the swimmers are consumed by sharks, you better fucking believe they bear responsibility for their inaction.
1317705218163937285 2020-10-18 13:53:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CliffJordan6 ♥️ For not helping.
1317705077323370496 2020-10-18 13:52:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This admonishment rightly applies to any political clowns in any ideology but I happen to be most in contact with libertarians.

I certainly don't think that there is any upside to wasting time disagreeing with each other. The stakes are life and death, stop the circle jerk.
1317701285416738817 2020-10-18 13:37:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In my opinion, the only excusable purpose of having any kind of organization could only be to strategize on how to spread these ideas to people who have been denied access to them. If they reject them, there's not much that can be done, move on to another, there are plenty.
1317700010725748736 2020-10-18 13:32:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LovinIntention ♥️ Absolutely, and these are supposed to be the people who evaded the conditioning and cast off their programming. Obviously, this is not the case.

It's a blunder of unfathomably enormous proportions and will certainly result in the end of human civilization. The most hopeful and rational adherents to liberty should be ashamed.

1317695415651831809 2020-10-18 13:14:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @trasHyTC ♥️ I would prefer we don't go that route but, I can't deny that I sympathize with the sentiment sometimes. Problem is if we let people allow the destruction of people the fact that we too are people is likely to be a significant caveat to the approach being thus destroyed people.
1317694448428515328 2020-10-18 13:10:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's become apparent that even within the various camps there are opposing factions which might even agree on the principles at play and yet still behave as though they are in public school vying for the attention of a handful of social gatekeepers to approve their popularity.
1317693917937152000 2020-10-18 13:08:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I have serious concerns about the “libertarian” identity politics that's developed. I don't know how far back it goes but, it’s not just embarrassing, it’s divisive and destructive. It's become a microcosm of the left/right theatre of popular politics only much less entertaining.

Dissimilar to communism only in its ability to conceal its true nature from most.
1317580705552093186 2020-10-18 05:38:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArbitraryDesign Has to do with economics. Extended order is the only arrangement which allows for resource allocation to be decentralized and, therefore, adaptive. Planned economies can never work and certainly not at the kinds of scales necessary for socialism proper. Prices inform not dictate.

1317568832370806786 2020-10-18 04:51:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArbitraryDesign It's the central point which proved that no socialism could ever function. Without the decentralized information transfer provided by the price function, no adaptations could ever be made to changes in the availability or necessity of resources. No prices means no information.

1317556816117698567 2020-10-18 04:03:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArbitraryDesign ♥️ agree
1317556634470764545 2020-10-18 04:02:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> "The Third Way is the fastest way to the Third World."  -Vaclav Klaus  This quote has been memory holed. I can't find an image on search engines which used to be common. This alone is dramatic evidence of the significance of his assertion and the threat it poses to corporativism.
1317553757803216904 2020-10-18 03:51:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArbitraryDesign ♥️ I would agree with that, certainly in practice. I think that is the basis for most claims of "communism has never been tried." I don't find it a convincing argument for additional attempts at communism but, there is some validity to the observation.
1317553248451133440 2020-10-18 03:49:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> To to see just how integrated the ideology of corporativism already is in our society, I will point out some prevalent tropes which should be recognizable. Primarily, the 'third way' is a common euphemism for corporativism as is 'bipartisanship' and 'public-private partnership.'

1317550606035320832 2020-10-18 03:38:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArbitraryDesign I haven't, I'm AC so I usually don't find much useful stuff in the leftosphere but, I do occasionally peruse. I do acknowledge the very similar threats we both seem to recognize. I'm just viewing it from a purely economic perspective which makes a lot of the rhetoric distasteful.

1317548051159011328 2020-10-18 03:28:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @USlawreview ♥️ Yup, it's been like that for me for years. Unless I specifically go to someone's TL, I'm unlikely to ever see their content. Only when something gets huge does it percolate out to the point where I see it retweeted by someone. I follow all so it actually helps in that respect.
1317546878284738560 2020-10-18 03:23:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @USlawreview ♥️ Very much so, I've been trying to get my own shit together recently so I'm consuming less media in general. Maybe Corbett, Cullen, Coleman, etc. every once in while. It's clear they are seeing the same things I am and speaking out about it so I'm trying to fill in the blanks.
1317546149226729479 2020-10-18 03:20:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RobertOLeary15 ♥️ I just haven't seen any such efforts thus far so I have to assume that none will arise. That said, it's not like there is a better candidate and certainly not slimy Biden. I am asking for a major change in understanding from people so I understand this will take some time.

1317544077236338688 2020-10-18 03:12:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ArbitraryDesign Exactly, only what we now face is global totalitarian corporativism closely allied with communist forces across the world. China has been moving from communism toward corporativism for some time while the rest of the world is moving from markets coming to meet them in the middle.
1317543460954644480 2020-10-18 03:10:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Rtonkins74 ♥️ Yes, so-called 'non-profits' are just a very slight alteration to the public relations model and are intended to appeal to those who tend to prefer socialist modes of production rather than capitalist. NGOs are essentially international corporations operating under this model.
1317542784006500353 2020-10-18 03:07:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> When you hear phrases like 'too big to fail,' 'too big to jail,' and 'essential national infrastructure' attributed to corporations, it should become clear that we're not talking about private actors operating a business for profit and beholden to the approval of their customers.
1317541523114831872 2020-10-18 03:02:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> By executing these functions by proxy through ostensibly 'private' entities, government is able to completely evade all constitutional restrictions which would be presumed to contain their economic planning objectives under a truly free market, open to all competitors by merit.
1317540869550034944 2020-10-18 02:59:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It is why large corporations generally operate at a loss and rely on subsidy and protectionism to exist. The state needs them as organs of policy to direct production which would otherwise be obviously forbidden to the government of a free people.
1317540078705573889 2020-10-18 02:56:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RobertOLeary15 @BalentineMarkie As I said, if voting is your solution, by all means vote for him. I don't want to dash the hopes of those who aren't ready to face what I believe is the real threat to humanity, global totalitarian corporativism. I have seen no movements to combat this threat in these 4 years.
1317539281594961922 2020-10-18 02:53:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's important people don't confuse businesses, companies, or firms with corporations. Even small corporations who may not fall precisely within this description and have incorporated out of legal necessity do benefit from the special exemptions not afforded market participants.
1317538697143779328 2020-10-18 02:51:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think it's necessary to address the nature of corporativism as I see many capitalists misunderstanding the arrangements which have brought us to this point. Corporations are implements of the state and corporativism is anti-capitalist. The state needs them as organs of policy.  https://t.co/XwJYWpcJKE

Because of this, I won't outright denounce him. For one thing, I could be wrong and he will save us all. My assessment is that he is either complicit or under duress by global corporativist state.

Only way to do that is to decentralize down as far as possible. Either through secession or by starting anew as towns again. Politics is worthless.

I can't shake the instinct to cut them off completely though if I really do suspect that they might orchestrate my death, knowingly or not.

I was mostly maneuvering to present intervention as a possible avenue for waking them up and ostracism would be the default threat.

1317088488911704066 2020-10-16 21:02:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lolScrybe @HegKong 70+ years of studies all in controlled environments and compiled by the CDC itself and you still don't even read the report. Instead you include a link to what amounts to speculation. I was wrong, you're not evil, just incredibly stupid. Still, go to hell.
1317086292887437315 2020-10-16 20:53:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lolScrybe @HegKong Why are you still talking shit. You've been notified of your colossal error and instead of retreating to confirm the data I've provided, you are maintaining your completely unsupported nonsense position out of pride. You were wrong before, now you are knowingly so, even worse.

You are an enemy of free people everywhere and should be ashamed. I condemn you to hell for your willing participation in the destruction of human civilization.
1317079231290101761 2020-10-16 20:25:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @StayOffTheRoad1 It's a disturbing realization. Many people have already reacted with shock and disbelief at the suggestion. I haven't brought this up in the past as much because of the obvious disunity the idea inspires. At this point though, I think some sort of intervention will be necessary.
1317076366848888833 2020-10-16 20:14:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SmartAssSOB They can get around any and all attempts to thwart mass vaccination. Only mass recall can get us out of this now.
1317075914593832962 2020-10-16 20:12:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MargeBouvier12 @checkmatestate And they have been since WWII or before. We were about 50% corporativist before 'the event' are we now 90% corporativist since 'the event.' Corporativism is a government form and is a variation of socialism.  https://t.co/PJWLA8raVO
1317074672807272449 2020-10-16 20:07:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HegKong We are biocriminals just because we are humans now. Thank the mask slaves for the end of freedom.
1317074071583076355 2020-10-16 20:05:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Let us hope this is true but, we failed the test for compliance against the threat of force for a demonstrably harmful procedure already so, they will now be emboldened to proceed with increasingly invasive requirements and can pick us off one by one as biocriminals at will now.
1317071808751951872 2020-10-16 19:56:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @checkmatestate Corporations are already part of the state. Regulation is simply the euphemism for state production and management direction. To nationalize a corporation is actually against the best interests of the state since it could no longer blame bad behavior of 'private industry.'
1317069200322662402 2020-10-16 19:45:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Mamajutsu At least the same procedure as is done for so-called "hoarders" or drug addicts.
1317056871333855232 2020-10-16 18:56:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Mamajutsu This should open your eyes to what I'm talking about. I don't think hoping for the best is adequate. I think we should conduct interventions on our brainwashed family members.    https://t.co/DdRAN9hA4X

1317052907339108354 2020-10-16 18:40:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 It is my reasonably well-informed assessment that we are well past the point of legislative, judicial, or executive correction.
1317049092036530177 2020-10-16 18:25:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 It's much worse than that though it's that too for well behaved agents of the state who are well taken care of. Essentially, the fed has been systematically destroying privately held wealth for its entire existence. We're now at point where only corporativists have real wealth.
1317043659360141312 2020-10-16 18:04:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JimTypeDude @DariusVolket Look at the results of the second poll. 👀  https://t.co/DdRAN9hA4X
1317042703608283136 2020-10-16 18:00:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 The illusion is that it's a revolving door. They are different offices in the same building, so to speak. They share the same boss and it isn't us.
1317040286258823169 2020-10-16 17:50:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Corporations have more power than any legislator by design. That is a structural feature of the design of the government form. If any "ceo" bucks the mandates, they are removed and replaced with a better behaved official.
1317038122836893702 2020-10-16 17:42:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @CynicalPublius I used the most extreme expression so as to minimize confusion as to the seriousness of the threat. If I'd said "take you in for questioning," I suspect many more would indicate a predisposition to turn over family members. Most don't even consider the state a mortal threat.
1317037020145995776 2020-10-16 17:37:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 This is mistaken. They are not capitalist enterprises interested in providing you with what you want. They are social engineering apparatuses designed to 'nudge' you into doing what the state directs them it wants. Most corporations operate at a loss and are subsidized.
1317036314542440450 2020-10-16 17:35:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Get angry, ask questions. Don't just think you know everyone. The brainwashing already implemented is plainly evident in the second poll. Denying it isn't logical. Your reaction is admirable from an ideological standpoint but, shortsighted and insufficient to address the problem.
1317035342155948033 2020-10-16 17:31:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @CynicalPublius I am absolutely delighted to hear that your family is loyal to one another and none are brainwashed. This is unfortunately not common though so, I'm trying to prompt some sort of intervention in the families compromised by state education and collectivist indoctrination.
1317034741930090496 2020-10-16 17:28:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Yes, fascism is another word for it. What we have is most precisely described by the term 'corporativism.' What is not widely understood is that this government form/ideology spans the planet already. If we're able to break free, it's likely they'll go to war against us.
1317033602153140224 2020-10-16 17:24:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SikorskyFlights @ScooterCasterNY @RachelDTobias Totally, first thought. lol
1317032956733640705 2020-10-16 17:21:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 It's not particularly true for my close family. Maybe because we're Irish but, I see this in the tertiary family and all over generally. What made me think to ask the question so bluntly was that we all simply assume they wouldn't but, with this new evidence of hysteria, not so.
1317031693522489345 2020-10-16 17:16:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Gulag's would be like a vacation in the bahamas compared to what is coming if we don't stop it.
1317030930880581632 2020-10-16 17:13:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @CynicalPublius I wish it was so.
1317030650231345154 2020-10-16 17:12:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Many have the mistaken impression that corporations are merely an organizational structure for capitalist enterprise. In fact, they're extensions of the state. They're anti-capitalist and most effective way for state to evade restrictions on implementing control over production.  https://t.co/uYjF9Fe7LR
1317028659102961664 2020-10-16 17:04:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kirstiealley Maybe you should discuss the fact that brainwashed family members would likely turn you over to the state to be murdered if told that it was necessary.  I think we have a much bigger problem than just censorship. 😢  https://t.co/DdRAN9hA4X
1317027013203578880 2020-10-16 16:58:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @CynicalPublius Guns won't help you if your family turns you in to be murdered.
1317026687243214850 2020-10-16 16:56:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Is that what you want? Because that's what you will get if you do nothing.

1317019802267942912 2020-10-16 16:29:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 @CynicalPublius I think that's tremendously optimistic but, best to prepare for all contingencies including those which are as simple as mere physical defense of your own property.
1317019279452213248 2020-10-16 16:27:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Two words and you are a pile of ashes in a crematorium in a matter of days. Don't you think that's a problem?
1317018866325835777 2020-10-16 16:25:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 This is a worldwide problem. America may be key to fighting back but, there is no evidence that Trump is at all interested in upending the global corporativist state which is ultimately what we must defeat if we are to survive as a species. Once you see it, you'll understand.

1317004011971760129 2020-10-16 15:26:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Wecx3 Many reason as you do.
1317002013176176640 2020-10-16 15:18:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> People do interventions for family members who have too much stuff, overeat, or play too many video games. Why not do them for family members who would willingly assist the government in murdering you or your other family members, including your children? What's more important?
1316999351344992256 2020-10-16 15:08:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @alijillTN If it weren't for the very real threat of perpetual human subjugation and possible eradication by a one world totalitarian state, I would be on a heck of lot less.
1316995272761815040 2020-10-16 14:51:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I don't enjoy asking these questions. The answers justify bringing up this very difficult problem. Ignoring this will only benefit the totalitarian state. As much as you may want to deny it, it must be addressed and fast. It's actually a matter of life and death for all of us.
1316993212033105921 2020-10-16 14:43:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @farflungdung1 I assume they read it in the less obviously wrong way you hinted at. Something like "if the state said your family member was a threat to national security, would you let us question them?"
1316992685425786882 2020-10-16 14:41:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @farflungdung1 And yet still a handful answered in the affirmative. 😔
1316990124442476545 2020-10-16 14:31:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @bharri45 As I think about it, it's maybe a bit paradoxical but, I think the family I'm already out of contact with would be the least likely to. Perhaps because they would be less likely to fear accusations of being an accomplice to an imagined crime having been out of touch for so long.
1316988291384811520 2020-10-16 14:24:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ZAKenworthy Yes, and this touches on the central common factor in almost all of the families whose fidelity is nearly beyond question. Almost all are considered criminal in some way by the state and, therefore, by the state's indoctrination machines, public schools in particular.
1316983855866314756 2020-10-16 14:06:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Do you think that some form of dramatic intervention is necessary to correct this problem before it's too late?
1316981793879412737 2020-10-16 13:58:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Are you confident that members of your family would not turn you over to the state to be murdered if they were told it was necessary?
1316980878388723714 2020-10-16 13:54:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Would you turn over a member of your family to the state to be murdered if they told you that it was necessary?
1316979747050688512 2020-10-16 13:50:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheSoccerDcn And I know there are parents who failed in the 60s and 70 because their children are so brainwashed as to turn their own children over to the state to be murdered. This phenomenon is not a modern failing but, a continuation of the process of familial disintegration.
1316978874757120003 2020-10-16 13:46:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you're dubious of the legitimacy of my concerns and are of the mind that your family would never turn you over to be murdered by the state, perhaps you should directly ask them the question. Would you hand me over to the government to be murdered if they said it was necessary?
1316978137272668161 2020-10-16 13:43:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheGreatRoh @MisesianChicago If they are not listening to you now and listening to the state on matters of such minimal importance as this, I can;t see how you don't understand that they will watch the state murder you if they are told it's necessary. Maybe you should ask them that as a direct question.
1316977222574624770 2020-10-16 13:40:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @noonesp95429433 @TheGreatRoh @MisesianChicago It's all by design. cybernetics and social engineering have been at work for a long time.
1316977023751946240 2020-10-16 13:39:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MisesianChicago @TheGreatRoh I can see that you do not believe that your family will turn you into the state and knowingly assist them in murdering you and then be liquidated. Like it or not, recognize it or don't but, that is what history tells us and you know it. I sympathize with you but, I know better.
1316976194676543490 2020-10-16 13:36:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MisesianChicago Correct, and when they do it to you, you will be crushed. But, psychologically, it is proven over and over that that is precisely what will happen.  I think a part of the problem is that people do not believe that their brainwashed family will assist the state in murdering you.
1316975690462449665 2020-10-16 13:34:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheGreatRoh @MisesianChicago After they turn you in to the state to be murdered, they themselves will be murdered eventually. You have done nobody any favors by failing to address this.
1316975267425013760 2020-10-16 13:32:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MisesianChicago They will happily turn you in though. I think many are under the mistaken impression that well-behaved nazis and commies didn't assist the state in murdering their family members. That day will come one way or another absent intervention of some dramatic sort.  I am not joking.
1316974754847477760 2020-10-16 13:30:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The question is this, would you rather have your family hate you and survive or love you and die?  This is actually not hyperbole. Granted, I am talking about time scales which many find incomprehensible. 30-50 years from now is virtually unimaginable for many but, it will come.
1316973744712261632 2020-10-16 13:26:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MisesianChicago I guess that's the question. Would I rather have them hate me and survive or love me and die?
1316973321565671424 2020-10-16 13:24:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @asimplefoolblog @MisesianChicago I agree, for my own benefit, I've kept contact with them as well I am now asking myself if my personal comfort for however long that will last worth trading the ultimate long term survival of my genetic line. If your descendants don't exist, I have to consider that a loss.
1316972908493852674 2020-10-16 13:23:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MisesianChicago I must be wrong but, I can't think of anything else to do.
1316972651299115008 2020-10-16 13:22:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I just don't know what else to do. They simply aren't responding to logical arguments and absolutely refuse to listen to relevant arguments. They are paralyzed by artificially induced unjustified fear. They can't or won't read. They may already be total losses but, try anything.
1316971593113927680 2020-10-16 13:17:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think disowning our families completely may be the only way to force people with blinders on to take them off and simply look at what's happening around them. They're currently unwittingly allied with the totalitarians. 😢  We do not have the luxury of time. The threat is real.

They halted all gene therapy testing back around 2000 after patients died from their immune systems attacking their organs. That was adenovirus based.

It's a completely different strategy than traditional vaccines.

Only market competition could provide a solution and that is prevented by a variety of policies, subsidy to the state actors, and business assassinations.
1316294835586859008 2020-10-14 16:28:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776 @kaitlin4liberty A simple example is censorship. Many people, even in the liberty community, consider corporate censorship to be OK because it's done by "private industry." People who don't see the connection think nationalizing the service is the answer but, it's already effectively state run.
1316293522211901440 2020-10-14 16:23:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SVAM_Campaign So figure out how to solve that problem.

Corporativism is a form of planned economy. It is a variant of socialism.

Granted, I'm talking about the mega-corps here, not merely businesses which find it a legal necessity to incorporate but, they do benefit from special exemptions to liability that market actors do not.
1316288696522608640 2020-10-14 16:04:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LVL1776 @kaitlin4liberty Corporations are organs of the state. Think of them as agencies or departments. They are directly controlled by government and interacting with them without understanding that relationship is what has us so far down this road. Absent-mindedly meandering into totalitarianism.

Corporativism is an ideology and a government form in which corporations are extensions of and not opponents of government. To differentiate is to self-deceive at this point.

However, so long as we are thinking critically about all information we come across, I would rather hear projections than not. For one thing, they serve as evidence with which to make further connections forensically. I won't condemn any of it yet.

1316036656034652162 2020-10-13 23:22:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @darreljorstad I believe the coming attacks against Belarus are connected to the president's rejection of the $1 billion bribe he refused from the WHO and UN to lockdown, force masks, and crash their economy. It will likely be called a "police action" under the guise of supposed election fraud.

Ultimate goal is to demonstrably remove consent. No government could claim consent with all of its towns in open but orderly revolt. Open war against all citizens would not be likely.

No planned economy can withstand free movement so it cannot be allowed, period. Many will still travel but, only with specific permission and with an official or work justification for the most part from now on.
1315834294087168001 2020-10-13 09:58:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riseupmelbourne @AussieVal10 Mass recall.
1315819663591460871 2020-10-13 09:00:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This isn't a secret, it is not a revolution per se. We intend to keep almost everything but hostile government intact and in place. We don't want any more harm to come to our people anywhere. We cannot trust legislators to act in good faith so mass recall must be enacted locally.
1315818542126825475 2020-10-13 08:56:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> There are still not enough people aware of the seriousness of our situation or the availability of this corrective procedure which I believe is the only peaceful option we have. We need 500-1000 families in every town to begin, ignore cities. Spread the word to everyone openly.
1315817463926460417 2020-10-13 08:51:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> As with most criminal organizations, specific information is unlikely to be available to actors in the field such as county officials, etc. but, they may very well have access to critical evidence needed to advance an effective peaceful town level civil rebellion as it develops.
1315816232940122115 2020-10-13 08:46:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's now time organize full mass recall of all sitting officials in all towns everywhere. From there, we will ask county and state officials to step down from their positions and disclose whatever documentation they possess regarding the organizational structure of their command.
1315815274101321728 2020-10-13 08:43:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Now that it's admitted by the authorities which many have considered legitimate and trustworthy that their policies have been inappropriate and harmful. Anyone paying attention to what information was available at the time of implementation knows that none of this was accidental.
1315814439585820673 2020-10-13 08:39:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We've been forced to fight amongst ourselves for the last 6+ months to try to convince people who were fooled that they need not fear their fellow human beings. It would have been impossible to take the next necessary steps without doing so first. A tremendous loss of initiative.
1315813622409560067 2020-10-13 08:36:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BalentineMarkie Yes, and it is now considerably more invasive and has become accepted in the minds of the drones who either said nothing or even celebrated the expansion.
1315813019906179073 2020-10-13 08:34:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> These changes are now permanent and will not be removed. It should be clear to everyone, even advocates of this destruction of human civilization and social cohesion, that this has always been about enacting the control now awarded to corporativist totalitarian world government.
1315811765779914752 2020-10-13 08:29:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We knew that lockdowns could not be maintained forever. The purpose was to implement surveillance infrastructure and acclimate population to movement restrictions, both of which are now complete. This entire procedure is now openly admitted to have been incorrect from the outset.

It promotes the idea that a person must or could be completely consistent which is not a useful requirement.

1315694742672465920 2020-10-13 00:44:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We should be cautious about when and where we do it but, we should grind these fucking scumbags faces into the proverbial dust and dung relentlessly, mercilessly, and with all of the cruelty we can muster.

1315685265499922432 2020-10-13 00:06:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jimmywonton2 Of course, I'm not saying stop trading. I believe we can't allow any of this. All of it must stop. There is only one way to do it peacefully, mass recall. Even if you can run or are already reasonably well insulated, they will eventually hunt down and exterminate our descendants.
1315684712304832514 2020-10-13 00:04:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I have been focused on corporativism because that's literally what we're up against. Understanding that it's anti-capitalist is important for the "right" and communicating that we all have a shared enemy is important to appeal to the "left" for the purposes of mass recall.
1315683298782457860 2020-10-12 23:58:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jimmywonton2 More or less but, criminalizing private trade is a pretty significant official step.

As I said, you should still wear one home if your doctor diagnoses you and you are in the contagious stage of infection.

I suppose you could say the same thing about talismans and the power of positive thinking but, the first example is referring to the largest resource of relevant data available.

Also, it may be the case that the aerosolization effect from masks may actually aggravate the spray pattern by more finely distributing the virions.

There's more to it and droplet reduction can be helpful if patient is known to be infected and currently contagious but, it's supposed to be for going home from doctor, not walking around.

1315457769621913604 2020-10-12 09:02:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you haven't read The Road to Serfdom yet, now is a good time. Many austrian econ folks mistakenly view it as a soft variant as compared to Human Action but, it's actually not really an econ book exactly. It's a warning against totalitarianism.   https://t.co/RrbKEW2heK  https://t.co/Q6loMCz0x6

1315440243030585344 2020-10-12 07:52:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mugsygogs @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate Yes, I've watched a fair amount on exosomes and I'm very interested in the explanation. As I continue to pursue additional fields such as EMF damage, this becomes more applicable. As it is, the threat to humanity could already come from the very therapies which are being touted.
1315438816002560000 2020-10-12 07:47:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AsapMayonaisse @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate Whoa man, you're sciencing me to death. 🙄
1315438596392968192 2020-10-12 07:46:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @tee_zone311 @checkmatestate @mcm_ct Tom's audience is much larger so he has limitations on the perceived wildness of the hypotheses he's able to safely put forth. He also derives income from his show so can't risk it. I don't have many normies amongst my followers so I'm not subject to those kinds of restrictions.
1315437247659991040 2020-10-12 07:40:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate @ThomasEWoods We should pursue whatever avenues we think are most important and have the highest possibility of effecting constructive change. I have the advantage of not having a preexisting public persona which restricts the scope of my intellectual questioning. Tom can't do what I'm doing.
1315435637231751168 2020-10-12 07:34:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate Yes, now I have to convince everyone that our food production and distribution infrastructure have been irrevocably damaged by government action. It's now consolidated into the hands of a few major international corporations which obey the commands of the central world authority.
1315434942252359682 2020-10-12 07:31:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @eallen83 It's possible to simply make almost everyone infertile or to introduce heritable genetic changes which would trend toward infertility or variety of disabling conditions for which there would be no treatment and from which there would be no escape. Mere accident merits moratorium.
1315433736729657344 2020-10-12 07:26:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Reagan_Girl @mz55qrf @realDonaldTrump No one would be more pleased to see that happen than me. However, based on my current understanding of the situation, that outcome is now virtually impossible. If he is trying, he hasn't been successful and if he isn't trying, it doesn't really matter why. I hope I'm wrong.
1315432799504138240 2020-10-12 07:23:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate Yes, so what is your plan to fight it?
1315432544431730689 2020-10-12 07:22:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate I don't have to because you already know that it is a cover story. You should be looking into global totalitarian corporativism since that is the real threat.  Why would you get yourself stuck on a transitional argument which is of little consequence to the actual danger?
1315431786525188096 2020-10-12 07:19:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate Which of our two arguments is more likely to receive the consideration of the average person terrified by the possibility of a deadly pathogen outbreak? The one I've chosen which repeats back established medical opinion supporting my position or "there's no proof of anything?" 🤨
1315431063167082496 2020-10-12 07:16:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate I hope you understand that my goal is not to make any final determination about the validity of the science of either theory. I'm simply trying to convey my concern for the long-term survival of free humanity and this obstacle has stood in the way requiring me to debunk it first.
1315430316119658498 2020-10-12 07:13:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @eallen83 We can't allow a global totalitarian corporativist regime (or any totalitarian planners) to possess the control capability to approve/disapprove individual reproductive capacity, the possibility alone is reason enough to stop it. Combined with economic indicators, I'm convinced.
1315429293179252737 2020-10-12 07:09:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @eallen83 It's hard to believe, I know. I'm definitely extending my evaluation out pretty far in time so I can't claim to know for sure but, I'm confident it's technically possible already to eradicate the human race by accident or by design and I know that's an attractive option for them.
1315428093239140352 2020-10-12 07:04:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate By not having to defend new theory, I can avoid the bulk of the quick and easy dismissals which are always at the immediate disposal of any technical authority working within an accepted paradigm. They're easily beaten at their own game so to speak so I'm playing by their rules.
1315427338188926976 2020-10-12 07:01:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate This is of course also true but, again, when inspected based on observable evidence (which is all we had until genetic sequencing became widely available,) it's not required to prove or disprove the existence of this particular strain in order to nullify the claims made thus far.
1315426589690212353 2020-10-12 06:58:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate lol
1315426254577905664 2020-10-12 06:57:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate I am interested in exosomes but, for the purposes of disproving the official narrative, I've determined that it is unnecessary and works against my immediate goals which are to dismiss this cover story and get to the heart of the threat, global corporativist totalitarianism.
1315425583552245762 2020-10-12 06:54:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate I have chosen to follow the conventional science mostly because it is available and I haven't found it necessary to diverge from it in order to clearly demonstrate that almost all of the policies implemented are contrary to established epidemiological procedure and evidence.
1315423926391050246 2020-10-12 06:47:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate I know I sound like I know what I'm talking about and to an extent I do but, I am not an expert on this. This is just what I've gleaned studying it for the last 6 months or so. I'm eager to be corrected on mistakes that I must be making in some of this. Please do so if possible.
1315423157264801792 2020-10-12 06:44:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @eallen83 They've already won. It's up to citizens all over the world to dismantle this from the bottom up. If we fail to do so, our descendants, no matter where they hide or for how long, will eventually be exterminated. If we want the human race not to be forever enslaved, we must act.
1315420629542281216 2020-10-12 06:34:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate An extreme example would be ebola where fatalities are within a matter of days and the victims experience horrific symptoms. Consequently, they are not typically wandering around oblivious in public generally and so reinfect relatively few new hosts.
1315420193401778176 2020-10-12 06:33:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate In most cases the immune response generated by the less harmful infections also protect the host from the more harmful variations. This is why vaccine developers are having such a hard time finding test cases for experimentation. The worst form already killed off most vulnerable.
1315419023186817026 2020-10-12 06:28:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CJBowden1 @checkmatestate That's how epidemiologists explain it. The idea is that a highly virulent pathogen kills off hosts much more quickly and allows for fewer transmissions. Those reduced transmissions propagate more slowly than less harmful ones whose hosts are less incapacitated by the infection.
1315417788140449792 2020-10-12 06:23:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @eallen83 I think the entire world is now occupied by a global totalitarian corporativist regime. The management of the conquered territories are carried out by preexisting local native bureaucracies, many of which are unaware of their role. Corporativism is an ideology of planned economy.  https://t.co/0gr6AXsI6J
1315416714121744384 2020-10-12 06:19:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @checkmatestate SARS-COv2 is a coronavirus in the cold family with about the same communicability as the common cold, actually a little less I believe. Viruses mutate and successful mutations which achieve higher communicability are the most successful. This is achieved by becoming less harmful.
1315406833214001152 2020-10-12 05:40:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @exyz_Jeremy Yeah, still good though. It's just because the first two were so good. There are a lot of other works in that universe that I haven't read yet.

I'm just saying that, according to my understanding of corporativization, no individual leader is capable of overturning the grasp now held by the one world government nor have I detected any such effort since Trump.
1315403252524109824 2020-10-12 05:25:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Reagan_Girl @mz55qrf @realDonaldTrump World commerce (and therefore global production) is now almost completely dominated by these corporations who are directed by the unelected and impervious world government which is now undeniably in complete control of the entire world. This includes the US and all of the west.
1315402581376729089 2020-10-12 05:23:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Reagan_Girl @mz55qrf @realDonaldTrump You may have noticed that many international corporations appear to be untouchable by national governments and they are but, not because they're evasive. It's due to them being above the authority of nation states and beholden only to global governance already. They are directed.
1315402026898132998 2020-10-12 05:20:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Reagan_Girl @mz55qrf @realDonaldTrump I am really talking about megacorporations and not small companies who find the limited liability aspect of incorporating a legal necessity due to restrictions but, they do benefit from the special rules which they are exempted from which normal business operators are subject to.

It's a government form and variation of socialism, not an organizational structure for capitalist enterprise.

I know most Trump supporters are objectively pro freedom, at least in spirit if not at the level of understanding I would prefer. I don't want to dash hopes that might be the last available for many but, I'm very concerned.
1315353474171838466 2020-10-12 02:08:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames I like the 'business card' format and it's unusual enough to probably work in many cases.
1315353092611862530 2020-10-12 02:06:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jimmywonton2 I don't understand why he is intent on discouraging disproportionate defensive force. It's at best an invitation to hostile exploration and at worst a literally fatal mistake.

I figured at one point that I probably get through to about 1 every three days. I presume that has gone up but, it's not nothing. If they also become communicators of information, it has the potential rapidly increase.
1315331775875473408 2020-10-12 00:41:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I'm speaking from a decentralist rather than a libertarian point of view. We can't know much less agree on what the best system is for everyone everywhere. As such, allowing smaller polities to reform and completely eliminating the overarching superstructure is the answer.
1315330622609600514 2020-10-12 00:37:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @moulds_w @StoicMDJ I still do it. I might not stick around of they are obvious cultists though.
1315330339884146689 2020-10-12 00:36:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I have just been saying spread the idea. People have to know about. It's simple enough to communicate to anybody. If communications and power get cut, it would be much better if people were already aware of what to do. Better if we head that off.

It is certainly possible to not wish to try but, what does that say about a person's integrity? Therefore, I ask not to hear from the voice of indifference. Let it be quiet malaise.
1315327414352871426 2020-10-12 00:24:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I'm saying I disapprove of messaging that encourages nihilism and denies any responsibility for the protection of our species and way of life.

1315326663320895490 2020-10-12 00:21:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I was referencing the hint I attempted as much as making the statement. If people are going to encourage blasé attitudes toward the potential end of everything we hold dear, I'm not interested in hearing about it. Indifference is poison, certainly on this grave matter.
1315325810237149188 2020-10-12 00:18:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FourVector8 @Psycosteve2 The difference is that no government has ever had the ability to control all life on the planet. Whether they can actually do it yet is immaterial since they have specifically declared that as their goal. They could end the cycle of which you speak. Indeed, they could humanity.

1315323346364641285 2020-10-12 00:08:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Are you saying that you don't see the threat?
1315323061479133185 2020-10-12 00:07:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FourVector8 @Psycosteve2 If we don't stop this in the next year or so, it's technically possible that humanity will never reemerge from having its individual lives and reproductive cycle managed by a one world totalitarian government. They've explained it so we don't have to imagine how bad it will be.
1315320933775802369 2020-10-11 23:58:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner It is my opinion that you have tremendously over-estimated your window of opportunity to escape.
1315319252887379968 2020-10-11 23:52:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @itsybrittc Individually or in total?
1315318556188442626 2020-10-11 23:49:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 @FourVector8 There are arguments that hint at this going back much further even than the creation of the fed which makes sense since the fed was a tool created to achieve the specific results observed. Somebody had been planning effectively enough to achieve its creation and not accidentally.
1315317928246603778 2020-10-11 23:46:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FourVector8 @Psycosteve2 As soon as 500-1000 families in every town are aware of and ready to conduct a mass recall. From there, I do not know exactly what kind of time frame we would be looking at to both displace the entrenched bureaucracy and rebuild civilization. I only know that we must.
1315317208663429120 2020-10-11 23:43:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 @FourVector8 What is your specific complaint with my statement.
1315316660388102146 2020-10-11 23:41:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 @FourVector8 Stop paying them.
1315316517442146304 2020-10-11 23:41:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 @FourVector8 Start.
1315316313020129282 2020-10-11 23:40:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 @FourVector8 Start shunning them. Your assertion, which I agree with, is founded on the idea that consequences shall befall the quislings. That could only happen once we've displaced the occupation. At the moment, they are rooting for the occupation. They need to shut up.
1315315682381238272 2020-10-11 23:37:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I can't blame you for wanting to run away but, we need all hands on deck if we are going to save humanity. Your descendants, if any, would not be able to survive. Run now if you must, the sooner the better if that is your plan.
1315314640696619008 2020-10-11 23:33:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 @FourVector8 That's certainly true but, I'm fucking sick of people cheering on tyrants and I'm not going to be quiet about it. I want them to shut their fucking mouths so we can save the god damn world, even for them.
1315314230522974209 2020-10-11 23:32:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner They've already claimed that the president won his election unfairly so they are going in on election fraud pretenses. This is actually happening, not a theory or prediction.
1315313797943488513 2020-10-11 23:30:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FourVector8 @Psycosteve2 Since I have no authority, it's just insistarian.
1315313055157366793 2020-10-11 23:27:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner Global totalitarian corporatism is the construct that has achieved dominance already. No, they will not allow anyone to opt out. Belarus will probably be the first national casualty since they bucked the takeover. It will simply be a UN-backed "police action," no nukes necessary.
1315312008477237249 2020-10-11 23:23:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner I'm not joking.
1315310536469422080 2020-10-11 23:17:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner They will kill us.
1315309880144801793 2020-10-11 23:14:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MattStirner The productive capabilities of free men have been all but destroyed. The "leaders of industry" are corporatavists wholly controlled by the state. They no longer have any competition. There's no where to run to. Handing these insane tyrants the keys to the planet is not an option.
1315307739174838274 2020-10-11 23:06:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Gattaca is a delightful yarn compared to what is coming if we don't stop it. Peaceful town level civil rebellion is the only answer. Mass recall is the single mechanism by which we can remove all sitting officials. #massrecall
1315284959385583617 2020-10-11 21:35:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @FXdestination Corona scam is long and well exposed. If you're lamenting the paucity of scientific arguments, it's not that they aren't being made, they have been. It's just that the stakes are now accepted by most people. I should hope people are now addressing the tyranny and not the symptom.
1315265260870348800 2020-10-11 20:17:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MarkStoval They've had 6 months to consolidate and implement movement restrictions. We all knew they couldn't keep it up forever nor did they need to. Now the infrastructure is in place to selectively isolate individuals so they have achieved their goal.
1315264454997741568 2020-10-11 20:14:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 Of this I am aware.
1315262902631366658 2020-10-11 20:08:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 I'm not an authority, just a person telling those who openly oppose freedom to stop. It's my conclusion that such people who excuse or equivocate tyranny provide no useful purpose to open discussion. We all know government doesn't want us to be free. They don't need cheerleaders.
1315261348494934018 2020-10-11 20:01:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OGBLACKPLAGUE 😄 Ok, I get that, lol.
1315260586809229312 2020-10-11 19:58:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OGBLACKPLAGUE I presume you intend to help so this is not addressed to you. I am speaking directly to people who oppose freedom.
1315258567402848256 2020-10-11 19:50:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Psycosteve2 That would be helpful if you are an enemy of free men.

1315253002782023681 2020-10-11 19:28:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mcla007 @ohboywhatashot What catches my attention primarily is the fact that he is a corporativist in charge of one of the megacorps given control of a significant portion of the global food supply. I'm always suspicious of high-profile takedowns in such positions because they are usually protected. 🤔

1315069646253494272 2020-10-11 07:20:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire You seem to veer when I directly answer a question. I was saying that violence and intrigue of defining characteristics of all governments which explains why they are expert at them.
1315067695851876353 2020-10-11 07:12:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire What government came into existence without emerging as the victor in some military conflict or by being placed there by such a victor?
1315066770428964865 2020-10-11 07:08:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire I don't understand, is that a question?
1315066318983516167 2020-10-11 07:06:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire All governments begin as military victors in a contest for dominance over a subject population.
1315065224618291200 2020-10-11 07:02:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire It is a defining characteristic.
1315064361074003968 2020-10-11 06:59:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Yes, the government is expert at violence and intrigue. It would seem a fruitless avenue to pursue because of that but, it's better than genuine capitulation I suppose.
1315063527317614602 2020-10-11 06:55:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire So, they act as though the government is not their enemy in order to lull in the potential victim (government?) By not openly admitting to their recognition that they (government) is hostile, they aim to surreptitiously defeat them through some gradual procedure in secret?
1315059446016507904 2020-10-11 06:39:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @M92020597 🧐

1315057477835259905 2020-10-11 06:31:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Zach_of_Earth So, to not attract attention?

1315055854790553600 2020-10-11 06:25:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire I'm saying that I am surprised by people who do not consider the government their enemy.

1315054244291121152 2020-10-11 06:18:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire We've already established that it's the size of the stick that determines your willingness to assert any objection. Bullies usually have some physical advantage sufficient to deter a pragmatist. I'm using the analogy to describe why allies are an impossibility for a pragmatist.
1315053485717696519 2020-10-11 06:15:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @contextproblem @TiddyGothTrader @volunt4ryvoice Not you, obviously. lol
1315053133291302912 2020-10-11 06:14:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire In your youth in your hometown, you probably witnessed a bullying event at some point in your life. Presuming you weren't the initiating bully, if you didn't object to the unjustified ill-treatment of another person, you couldn't reasonably expect anyone else to defend you.
1315051771077820418 2020-10-11 06:09:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jozannyme It sounds like you recognize government as an enemy but are currently 'in custody.'
1315051406504718336 2020-10-11 06:07:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Do you not understand the line of reasoning? I'll think about it and see if I can present it more clearly.
1315051104992858112 2020-10-11 06:06:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ForkintheForest I'm sure there is a lot of that but, I'm saying that the truth can circumvent suppression through word of mouth in the same way that lies can. And, if digital communications are lost or severely restricted, that will be the only distribution method available to us.
1315049949059526657 2020-10-11 06:01:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire So, yes? It's not a trick question but, it does mean that you have not chosen a philosophy per se as whatever is appropriate at any given moment is what you adopt. It is an unprincipled outlook. The danger in it is that you may minimize enemies but, you can never have allies.
1315048790714470406 2020-10-11 05:57:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Are you a pragmatist?
1315048404377055233 2020-10-11 05:55:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire I take it you haven't been paying attention to what is happening or you have accepted the official narrative to some degree. Or, my assessment is accurate.
1315048022309515272 2020-10-11 05:54:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Yes, you've put your stick down. The government hasn't. You're simply expressing the condition of subjugation but, instead of openly admitting the shame associated with that, you're attempting to present it as "common sense." It's OK to be defeated but, you can't claim otherwise.
1315047268735684610 2020-10-11 05:51:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TiddyGothTrader @volunt4ryvoice Whomsoever makes voluntary agreements with me and upholds their end. But, ally is a strong word so, I would have to say my faithful fellows.
1315046724273143814 2020-10-11 05:49:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Then you can't complain if someone aggresses upon you. You're essentially saying, "threaten to hit me with a big enough stick and I won't retaliate." As such, if someone threatens to hit you with a big enough stick, you couldn't, you mustn't, diverge from your pragmatic doctrine.
1315044533768519680 2020-10-11 05:40:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Unless you are an avowed pacifist and would never defend yourself against aggression nor seek to punish anyone who has aggressed upon you, your philosophy is utterly unworkable. How could you, in good conscience, complain about being violated by anyone at any time?
1315042065022095360 2020-10-11 05:30:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Not enhancing your case.

1315039621827506176 2020-10-11 05:20:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire But, assuming we agree that you are not, what makes you not consider the government your primary enemy?
1315038781700009986 2020-10-11 05:17:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Please explain, are you saying that you yourself is your worst enemy, above any other including government?
1315038215502475269 2020-10-11 05:15:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire If I may ask, without naming names, whom is your primary enemy?
1315037918700994561 2020-10-11 05:14:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire You are mistaken.
1315037800853536770 2020-10-11 05:13:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Are you just being argumentative or do you actually believe the government is not your primary enemy?
1315036921429663749 2020-10-11 05:10:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire I think I detect a multitude of errors in this line of thunking. It's not making enemies of everyone, it's recognizing your primary active enemy. The one which is most highly motivated and most capable of causing you harm.
1315032769647476738 2020-10-11 04:53:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SaltNFire Last meal of the crocodile syndrome? Just makes them traitors though if it's conscious. 🤔

Partly due to their viewing "the axis" as being diametrically opposed to communism. It's essentially the same ideology with a smaller geographical scope.

Fascism is a synonym for corporativism. I mostly choose to focus on corporativism and specifically chose the unfamiliar spelling so as to diffuse mistaken allegiance to corporations some supposed capitalists have. Makes them look it up.
1314957331025846274 2020-10-10 23:53:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @chbstone2 Yes, much of the misunderstanding is due to his approach when interacting with socialists which was generally amicable. Basic message was he sympathized with moral feelings of socialists but established that attempts to realize their polices would result in contrary outcomes.
1314949734818287618 2020-10-10 23:23:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @chbstone2 @previouslyGO372 @angrycrackbaby @JonahofNinevah I've been calling it global totalitarian corporativism. Like all variations on socialism, corporativism is anti-capitalist. Indeed, any qualifying prefix negates the validity of the root such as "stakeholder capitalism," etc. They are all against a free market. NWO works as well.

The main purpose of the outbreak is to provide cover for controlled crash of world economy. The vaccine/GT may be everything I fear it is or not but, it's primary function is covidpass to control movement.

1314774665953452032 2020-10-10 11:48:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I should mention the gene therapy aspect again. I thought everyone knew about it from the outset of all of this since they spoke of it openly so early on. It was one of the primary indicators besides command economy that convinced me from the beginning.   https://t.co/us7bEqbXiC

1314753934154760192 2020-10-10 10:25:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @tee_zone311 I think it's looking pretty accurate and, believe it or not, encouraging. I do not think over half of people accepted the assertion of a planned economy six months ago and now almost everyone who had been merely suspicious of the lockdown seem to be talking about it.
1314752999361781763 2020-10-10 10:21:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Mamajutsu @davy_jones8404 The documents listed in the follow-up poll may dispel that doubt.

1314746665065164806 2020-10-10 09:56:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Have you looked at the 2010 Lockstep document, reviewed the Event 201 scenario, and read the Agenda 21 and agenda 2030 descriptions?
1314743646483288067 2020-10-10 09:44:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> How convinced are you that the policies implemented by governments all over the world are not responsive to any actual threat of a pathogen, inordinately uniform and not ad hoc, almost entirely unwarranted, and probably structured to create a centrally controlled planned economy?

1314722286403026946 2020-10-10 08:19:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ercsnyder @Timcast This is helpful too but, I'll keep looking for accessible explanations.   https://t.co/vKd1xwoyVx
1314721793198956545 2020-10-10 08:17:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ercsnyder @Timcast I guess it was in a quote tweet that I put some useful info on this. I will try to find more articles that aren't too technical to help people understand what gene therapy is. Thank you for asking about it.   https://t.co/us7bEqbXiC
1314692476817506306 2020-10-10 06:21:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ACFederation I remember it being weaponized well over a decade ago. I'm surprised it's even still around. Like all corporations, it's not allowed to die if it serves a purpose for the state.
1314684484651028482 2020-10-10 05:49:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Voluntar7 It's actually kind of helpful that you prompted me to look this up again. I'll keep looking for articles with useful info that aren't too technical.   https://t.co/us7bEqbXiC
1314682564972548097 2020-10-10 05:42:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mithidates I always prefer comments so I hope I didn't suggest otherwise. Just wanted to clarify that I was being mean to the austrian econ folks in this rare case.
1314681734215147520 2020-10-10 05:38:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Voluntar7 Many things are "therapeutic" including rubbing someone's feet.  I would say "trust me," but you should instead read up on it yourself.   https://t.co/vKd1xwoyVx
1314679194773839875 2020-10-10 05:28:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Timcast A notable comment he makes is his fake dumb guy reference to "therapeutics." Therapeutics is a euphemism for gene therapy. It should make anyone still under the impression that he is not complicit with the global totalitarian corporativist state shudder.

1314657756180250624 2020-10-10 04:03:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 A lot of it probably is just human nature though. Part of why I try not to complain too much. People tend to back off if you look like you're doing well. I've noticed this in radio, music, publishing, etc. The trick is to have enough new traffic to make up for "the quieting." 😄
1314656608765566977 2020-10-10 03:58:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I get about 1 million (a month that is) and that is still going up. When they slap down the visibility ban I can see it pretty clearly in the daily chart. High profile poke-in-the-eyes do get a lot of views though. I should do more of that.
1314652808432492551 2020-10-10 03:43:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I just checked and impressions are also down for me actually. Hard to say though either way. I haven't been as concerned with it lest their gaslighting be too successful. I notice mostly when I see retweets with no like which is a dead giveaway that something is awry.
1314651581556625409 2020-10-10 03:38:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SouthParkMob @hellothere3332 Yeah, my pinned tweet is pretty tame compared to what's going on now so I probably should replace it. I try to leave the molested content in place for reference and pinned tweets don't really matter anyway. It's interesting to watch the stats evaporate and it's a good example.
1314650458720546818 2020-10-10 03:34:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SouthParkMob @hellothere3332 The legacy interface was better for detecting chicanery but they blocked access to it a couple of months ago. I will mention the like concealment trick when I see examples in other accounts to draw attention to the fact since many people don't believe it actually happens.
1314648952654962690 2020-10-10 03:28:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SouthParkMob @hellothere3332 I've been tracking it for about 4 years. My pinned tweet got up to about 130k impressions several years ago and then it just stopped. They've since deleted master record for that tweet so I can't view the stats anymore. Interactions expire so it stays around the same level now.
1314646904274407424 2020-10-10 03:20:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 Engagements are usually low because they represent a zoom or a content view. It could mean that people are zooming the tweet to confirm a like took which I do almost every time now. Impressions are up for me generally but, I've been SB for years now so same % of larger number.
1314644158213169153 2020-10-10 03:09:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Frequent twitter users are used to the soft censorship of notification limitation. Impressions are growing but interactions are almost disappearing. Retweets with no like is a symptom and that's become the norm. Whatever they're doing now is bringing the whole thing to a crawl.
1314631134932852736 2020-10-10 02:17:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShonadMcDermott Yes, and gene therapies are another animal altogether. People are still calling this a "vaccine" despite Trump's fake dumb guy use of the term "therapeutic."

1314616876736090117 2020-10-10 01:21:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We need more people to ask questions, process information, draw conclusions, and speak up.
1314615424332574723 2020-10-10 01:15:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Most people acknowledge that having everyone worldwide take a tylenol from the same batch all at once would be a ridiculous proposition. Not because it's certain to cause harm but, if it did, it would do so to everybody.  Why shouldn't this apply to an experimental gene therapy?

1314611528277032960 2020-10-10 00:59:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mithidates I tend to interface with people who aware of economics (specifically austrian economics) so my comment is meant to single out people whom I would expect to be considerably more dubious of the official narrative than I've observed. Common idiots aren't likely to be viewing this.

We already know that the actual count is literally a very small fraction of the reported numbers not counting the elderly with two or more comorbidities.   0-19 years: 0.00003 20-49 years: 0.0002 50-69 years: 0.005 70+ years: 0.054   https://t.co/uWhNoyBgp0
1314560877471895552 2020-10-09 21:38:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Yes, that's a primary feature of corporativism. The government is able to direct production by proxy without being subject to any constitutional restrictions. The danger being that anyone would be under the mistaken impression that constitutional restrictions would help anyway.

1314558520998715393 2020-10-09 21:29:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames It's all a variation on the basic myth that it is possible to plan an economy. One of the most effective ways to improve the chances of successful prediction is to eliminate the great bulk of actors whose actions are the least predictable. This is the real wet dream in essence.
1314556957211201542 2020-10-09 21:22:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MarcusTriton ya think?!
1314546578217107456 2020-10-09 20:41:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If I'm wrong (which I hope,) then things may get worse but not end. I'm perfectly happy to risk my reputation on trying to expose what appears to be the most dire threat to humanity, perhaps ever. What are you worried about? Losing your twitter credibility? Getting laughed at? 😠
1314542991470735360 2020-10-09 20:27:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby This is precisely my point. These people are arrogant enough to think that they will be spared or that eliminating the human race is justifiable or advisable. It would only take a mistake, not even a conscious effort. It may even be their intention to only farm mules from now on.
1314539331575525376 2020-10-09 20:12:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby I do not have confidence in that. For one thing, if every human being on the planet gets an rna virus which alters their dna to halt reproduction, that's it. If it's a communicable gene therapy, even those who avoid the "treatment" would eventually also be infected. Possible.
1314537218069999616 2020-10-09 20:04:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby I've been kind of a fan of the human race. Even with its many faults, I'd prefer that it remain in existence.

He's probably not stupid enough to actually believe the nonsense he spouts and he gets a handsome reward for his allegiance. I can't say the same for the great mass of people who do not get paid to ignore critical information.
1314498105639870464 2020-10-09 17:29:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @whitemenr Many of those people, like it or not, are the true investigators and pursuers of knowledge, right or wrong. It's the ones who laugh at them and shrug while civilization collapses thinking they are the smart ones that really 'grind my gears.'
1314497132079075328 2020-10-09 17:25:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm not shocked at common idiots who just want to keep the blinders on. They simply constitute the mass of peer-pressured livestock. What I'm bothered by is those who have enough presence of mind to investigate economics, specifically austrian econ, and yet do not question this.
1314495684268240896 2020-10-09 17:19:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @whitemenr Actually, I didn't even consider the merits of the argument. I'm talking about the impending doom that is upon us being completely ignored by people who are supposedly intelligent.
1314493567029698560 2020-10-09 17:11:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TheAliceSmith It's actually not the primary caveat of minimum wage though. The real disaster is the fact that it effectively makes it illegal to hire low skilled workers. The effect being to eliminate the normal process of accumulation of experience in gainful employment. It's really evil.
1314491668176003072 2020-10-09 17:03:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Mamajutsu @youshouldbe For example, after about 15 minutes I had to come back and toggle the like, zoom, and refresh your tweet in order to get the like to keep on your tweet. You probably got a notification and the heart was displayed to me but, the interaction was hidden in the UI to everyone else.
1314490386241462272 2020-10-09 16:58:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SeRoKeVA This kind of shit.  https://t.co/RKG3t792p1
1314488801339805702 2020-10-09 16:52:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Mamajutsu @youshouldbe That is what I mean but, twitter conceals those interactions pretty regularly now so other people won't see it. I may not see it either depending on the circumstances. Even when they do allow it to be recorded, they will frequently expire after a week or so.
1314381776802938880 2020-10-09 09:46:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I don't know man. I'm starting to think maybe there is a case for consent in all of this. The information is available so it's not even a matter of concealment. Many people are fine with being killed and don't really care about the human race at all. They even openly hope for it.

I frequently have to toggle, reload, and zoom tweets to get likes to stick. Even I'll give up when it takes a full minute or two of wrestling the UI.
1314355669265457152 2020-10-09 08:03:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @youshouldbe I would like to think most of my followers are aware of the situation but, because of twitter chicanery, I can't be sure who is actually paying attention.

In a sense, I'm not a Smithian or a Cantillonian but, I'm not anti-British, anti-French or anti-Irish. It is however undeniable that origins of "capitalism" harken back to them.

Venezuela is a national socialism. All of them then begin to trend toward corporativism.
1314125512361549824 2020-10-08 16:48:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @alijillTN @Mcgillionaire1 Perhaps the "ism" is the sticking point. A commune need not dominate all resources in the world but communism must. It definitely the case though that Marxist communism was a global ideology which intended to supplant economics as such and replace it with "scientific" allocation.

Hitler was a Marxist but was disillusioned at failure of the workers to seize means of production worldwide. Mussolini further reduced scope with a variation of guild socialism.

After all, they are also part of human race and if they are being deceived and can be given the ability to discover it, they might help.🤞
1314030559883075588 2020-10-08 10:31:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby I understand if people wish to discount the potential. I can't blame anyone for wanting to just listen to Bobby McFerrin. My concern is with the future of humanity and the threat I believe we face is not merely one government but a global corporativist totalitarian dictatorship.
1314029287868182533 2020-10-08 10:26:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby I disagree.
1314028723109343233 2020-10-08 10:23:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby Yes, that is the topic of the conversation, at least from my end.

1314027608577912832 2020-10-08 10:19:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby OK good. I was getting the impression that you weren't concerned about the government doing harm to the population out of fear of a nuremberg-like trial or something.
1314027168477974532 2020-10-08 10:17:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby In the case of the HPV vaccine, I understand they used the non-antigen components of the vaccine (suspected of causing harm) in place of saline for the safety study resulting in comparable damage in both test subject groups thus eliminating notable disparities in side effects.
1314026384205938689 2020-10-08 10:14:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby Specific indications of a successful reproductive suppression campaign could take many years to manifest. By then it won't matter who you shoot and, if an evil plan, they won't care. Not talking about government agents knowingly poisoning you necessarily, just following orders.
1314025123922554883 2020-10-08 10:09:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby I don't have confidence in the government to not commit grievous violations against the public and history clearly confirms my worst suspicions from the Tuskegee syphilis exposures to releasing radioactive materials over US cities and many horrors yet unknown. We know they do it.
1314023207968673793 2020-10-08 10:02:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby I think you should do your own research. You will learn things that are important to understand, especially the history of vaccinations generally and the programs implemented in Africa and India specifically which have been proven to have deleterious side effects, not a placebo.
1314022538230538240 2020-10-08 09:59:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby Meaning that forced physical vaccinations, though still a possibility especially given the military "distribution" and we know they have been training armed forces all over the world in basic medical injections. So, it would not be necessary to implement but it is in the quiver.
1314021506175963136 2020-10-08 09:55:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby The presumption to date has been that movement will be controlled based on a registry of "vaccinated persons." The idea being that people who do not take the treatment will be excluded from most activities associated with daily life such as work, dining, housing, exercise, etc.
1314020125507543043 2020-10-08 09:49:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby It's worse. 😧
1314019332117139457 2020-10-08 09:46:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The immune system is amazing so I think it's likely the synthesized virus would eventually be suppressed as with other viruses. Which would at least mean that it wouldn't be perpetually communicable if at all. Heritable modifications imparted into host cells would persist though.

After researching the history and understanding the unbelievably irresponsible quackery involved, I'm now also suspicious that vaccines have ever really been the primary factor in outbreak reduction vs natural immunity.

1314001038337355776 2020-10-08 08:33:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Again, these are generally relevant complications associated with the topic overall. There are many factors and there is a difference between a vaccine and a gene therapy. Adjuvants are additives in vaccines intended to enhance immune response allowing for lower antigen levels.
1313999441297276938 2020-10-08 08:27:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> One side effect observed in some vaccines which appears to be connected to adjuvants is the training of the immune system to disrupt otherwise beneficial chemical signals within the body such as those related to reproduction effectively making the immune system fight pregnancy.
1313993939163271169 2020-10-08 08:05:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Marina_Sirtis No politics at all. Can I leave now?  https://t.co/jfzHLbibKb

1313991077196636160 2020-10-08 07:54:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> One major question is whether the synthesized virus is communicable. A flu virus is eventually suppressed by the immune system making it no longer communicable. If it is true that the therapy is a virus and doesn't suppress itself, does it ever stop making copies? Do hosts shed?
1313989509864919043 2020-10-08 07:48:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Now, the next bit of this is strictly speculative so I will present it as an open question rather than imply that any of it is a priori. These are potential deductions presuming my line of thinking is thus far accurate, nothing more.
1313987767093932033 2020-10-08 07:41:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I freely admit that I have limited expertise in these topics so contributions are requested if I misrepresent or miscommunicate. I'm particularly interested in debunks to lower the stress level a bit. I suspect I have the "dangerous" level of knowledge, that is, just enough.
1313985950729613312 2020-10-08 07:33:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> In this case, the synthesized virus instructs cells to make antibodies to a different virus. Presumably, it won't defend against copies of itself or else the whole process would be curtailed by your immune system. Any and all updates to genes can be permanent and also heritable.
1313984541045010434 2020-10-08 07:28:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> To expound a little on gene therapy, the idea is that you synthesize an rna virus which you infect the host with and it invades the hosts cells and alters the gene expression of the cells to make whatever they are designed to make.
1313982796315201536 2020-10-08 07:21:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JacquieDebbie I hope Trump folks are coming to their senses but, we'll just have to wait and see. It's got to be a severe blow to their confidence if they were still believers up to this point. They probably didn't do any epidemiological or immunological research thinking Trump would stop it.
1313982014429822978 2020-10-08 07:18:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Considering that the fatality rate for this is actually below the seasonal flu. None of this makes any sense. Not lockdowns, masks, vaccines, therapeutics or any of it.  Fatality: 0-19 years: 0.00003 20-49 years: 0.0002 50-69 years: 0.005 70+ years: 0.054   https://t.co/uWhNoyBgp0
1313980655215280132 2020-10-08 07:12:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Obviously, with HCQ+AZM and even this merely viewed as a "treatment," there would be no need for lockdowns so there is a clear discongruity in the science vs the procedure of this no matter how you slice it. Please comment if you have additional information or clarifications btw.
1313979100361560064 2020-10-08 07:06:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> For those just catching up, "therapeutic" is a euphemism for gene therapy generally. He makes a point of noting that it's not a (or the) vaccine so he's now in a faux dumb guy way openly admitting to what we've been explaining about the nature of the treatment since the outset.
1313972669801521152 2020-10-08 06:41:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MrLeadslinger If all of this goes as deep and as far back as it seems to, elections haven't been a significant factor in the progress of the plan, whatever it is. I think we can forgive ourselves (and the voters) since nothing we could have done would prevent it. At least politically speaking.

1313971232958799872 2020-10-08 06:35:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MrLeadslinger Not sure, I've been seeing Trump people roundly rejecting the idea that he would support mandatory vaccinations. Apparent criminalization of the q people under his watch (whether it's a psyop, legitimate, or just to confuse) seems to indicate some sort of false flag preparation.
1313969708316717057 2020-10-08 06:29:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MrLeadslinger I can't see how this could be interpreted as anything other than a major confirmation of his collaboration with the global corporativist state. Maybe there's a chance people will wake up and snap out of it.

A mass recall of all sitting officials locally followed by recall of county and state officials. Ignoring cities, if done by locals in every town simultaneously, it is the only thing that will work.
1313888748023828481 2020-10-08 01:07:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I see support for exonerating prominent victims of state abuse which I enthusiastically support. However, even w/o GCT dominance over the world and rollout of global dystopia proceeding, success would simply mean the state would stop hurting a particular person. Mass recall now.
1313883569480232961 2020-10-08 00:47:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @RobSchneider I can only see one option, peaceful town level civil rebellion.

It is already attempting to assume the mantle of revolution in one or more of its corporate agencies of which the communists are one. Mass recall is peaceful decentralization by local consent.

Gather 500-1000 families and conduct mass recall of all sitting officials in your town. From there ask county and state officials to step down. Needs to be locals in every town and simultaneous but it will work.

1313102269924204550 2020-10-05 21:02:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> As in communist societies, the state isn't interested in convincing subjects of the validity of the arguments.

1313097290547105793 2020-10-05 20:42:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> What distinguishes global totalitarian corporativism is the preponderance of deputized corporate citizens carrying out much of the supervision rather than soldiers.

1313018297860882433 2020-10-05 15:28:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's becoming clearer why "the virus" has almost nothing to do with what's going on.

1313013363224477697 2020-10-05 15:09:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Much of it is actually a discovery process wherein flaws can be detected for future adaptations and restructuring which may adjust or eliminate that which is chaotic or disruptive to the central plan.

It appears that the only way for people to have a chance at understanding what is happening is if they are on twitter. Even then, as we know, it's no guarantee. The message needs to bridge the gap from online to grassroots and do so in every town, it takes time.

There is no down side, certainly not in comparison to the alternative.
1312459101205454849 2020-10-04 02:26:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 Depends, is the mayor of your town an avowed communist? Are your local dog catchers, dpw, meter maids, and police prepared to slaughter innocent women and children in the streets to protect their jobs? If he was and if they were, wouldn't we want to know that sooner than later?🤔

I hope he's OK but, we've got to protect ourselves. If it turns out the top down strategy is working, they'll meet the bottom up strategists in middle. No harm, no foul, no reason to oppose mass recall.

Merely incorporating a business out of legal necessity doesn't make it corporativist though, they benefit from special treatment not available to market actors.

It is a one world state comprised of monopolies and/or cartels which receive direction from the central authority. It is a command economy sharing the caveats of any planned economy.
1312012762969780224 2020-10-02 20:53:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @melbprisoner Ultimately, I don't think a single state could successfully combat it. Without the towns which comprise the body of their presumed economic base and obedient subjects, their cities could not last long.
1312011961496932352 2020-10-02 20:50:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @melbprisoner Corporativism is another variant of socialism and could be compared to guild socialism except that the state is paramount and corporations act as instruments of the state which is a little different than anarcho-syndicalism. It's really very close to communism.
1312009802101526528 2020-10-02 20:41:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @melbprisoner I think the axis of totalitarianism now forming can only be opposed by decentralization.
1312009355202625536 2020-10-02 20:39:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @melbprisoner Ayn Rand had some good arguments for maintaining a super-state to oppose communism's super-state and we do still have China to worry about. That said, as far as I can tell, China has been inducted into the corporativist family as has the US, though from opposite directions.
1312008671442935809 2020-10-02 20:36:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @melbprisoner At the moment, I see the communists allied with the corporativists against free society and they appear to be winning. I'm primarily concerned with stopping the global totalitarian corporativism and I'm somewhat relieved to not have communists on my side.
1312006746567737345 2020-10-02 20:29:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @melbprisoner I'm ok with towns.

Flus get worse as you get older so it could still be that. Based on data we had in April for the UK, models showed around 50% infection rate. I wonder if any others will be familiar with symptom description and duration.

I've had food poisoning and a lot of that sounds familiar including the sustained weakness afterwards. Usually it's bacterial so if antibacterials helped, that might be why.

I probably really don't have to go much further actually but, there are many examples of premeditated crimes (known to be in violation of law) being orchestrated by government agencies.

1311947630403112962 2020-10-02 16:34:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Voluntar7 @lecwah1 No, just checked briefly and it sounds like I should check him out. I'm finding it hard to deny the satanic symbolism.

1311946639733600263 2020-10-02 16:30:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Main difference is that government is able to direct production through its regulation of each industry's corporations, be they monopolies or cartels. This both affords the appearance of private ownership and the ability to circumvent legal restrictions on government behavior.
1311945544013676544 2020-10-02 16:26:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 In a similar way, their intentions are irrelevant. Either they are consciously committing crimes or they are not consciously committing crimes. The crimes are nonetheless being committed.
1311944730402586624 2020-10-02 16:22:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Voluntar7 @lecwah1 I would call those corporativists of which we have many national and international examples. The rest I just call bureaucracy for simplification's sake since it is not necessary for them to be sympathetic or even aware of their participation. The result is the same.
1311943427307769857 2020-10-02 16:17:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The purpose of explaining corporativist philosophy is to show how closely it aligns with communist doctrine of fairness and equality. Besides their shared anti-capitalist agenda, both ideologies are based on moral authority rather than the material improvement to quality of life.
1311941104762269698 2020-10-02 16:08:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 I'm able to avoid decisive clarification on such questions by knowing that whatever the explanation, whether he is or isn't in control of those agencies, those agencies are assembled in direct continued opposition to the freedom of all americans as demonstrated by their behavior.
1311937735796690944 2020-10-02 15:55:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Probably, though I wasn't specifically saying that the executive branch is specifically funding blm or antifa. It's widely acknowledged that he doesn't control all government. The elements of government over which he doesn't control are acknowledged to provide support to them.
1311936132536569856 2020-10-02 15:48:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Yes, the racist chaos being promoted has the direct support of government.
1311935097722073088 2020-10-02 15:44:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The British empire was only able to subdue the nation of India by arranging for India's bureaucracy to assure compliance with its edicts. It could not have succeeded using its military alone. The totalitarian corporativist order is being implemented in that fashion, but globally.
1311931133299429378 2020-10-02 15:28:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @QuoteLeader Corporativism, being a variation on socialism, does also posit a new order which it likes to present as an improvement to the extended order. It also, of course, directly applies to other variations such as communism which tends to dress itself more garishly in such rhetoric.

In my estimation, he has effectively, if not intentionally, provided material support to enemies of the american people (and the world) by not resisting this takeover.
1311702167666012167 2020-10-02 00:19:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 In his place, if I cared about the american people, I would admit my mistake and publicly announce the situation in all its gruesome detail so that we might prepare to defend ourselves. He is not doing that.
1311701536364539905 2020-10-02 00:16:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 I don't deny that but, it is entirely possible if not likely that this entire procedural political theatre is contrived to achieve the goal of delivering us into the maw of the global totalitarian corporativist state. To confuse and confound those who would otherwise revolt.
1311700600422387712 2020-10-02 00:12:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 We're past the point of any correction arising from legal challenge or legislative repair. Mass recall of all sitting officials is now the only option.

They are all either guilty of complicity, victims of coercion, or are so intellectually challenged as to be considered incompetent to hold office.
1311699222828322818 2020-10-02 00:07:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 I leave a sliver of opportunity for explanation but, as I hinted, I'm more or less convinced of his complicity. I cannot be sure if it's willingly or under duress but, his behavior is extremely damning. All of this is under his watch. With leaders like him, who needs enemies?
1311697675901861889 2020-10-02 00:01:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 The world is currently occupied by the global totalitarian corporativist state, US included.
1311697271617191936 2020-10-01 23:59:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @lecwah1 Which simply means that Trump was either in on it, under duress, or incapable of seeing what many of us saw from the outset. I find the latter explanation difficult to believe leaving only options 1 and 2 which put him squarely on the opposing side along with every other leader.

Mass recall all sitting officials in your town, then ask county and state officials to step down. Need to be local residents in each of all of the towns simultaneously but, it's the only thing that will work.

The idea is that most towns will still have officials who would be unwilling to slaughter their own families and those of the neighbors and friends just to keep their jobs.

Yes, if someone tells you otherwise, they're lying. What you'll find if you look into it is not claims of their effectiveness but, some other justification.
1311255405469802497 2020-09-30 18:43:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KarenTube1 Almost a century of research has established unequivocally that they are not useful.  "In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (Figure 2).”   https://t.co/FOu7hpzumO
1311254076726874112 2020-09-30 18:38:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DuxVitorI Perhaps the most vulnerable aspect of it is its paycheck personnel and unwitting enablers. If it's forced to overtly use state militaries on populations outright at such an early stage, it could completely collapse though, that's not really enough to route out its true believers.
1311251219227213824 2020-09-30 18:27:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DuxVitorI Yes, quite weak in its current stage. All sitting officials must be removed to halt its growth. All participants must be considered compromised either by acquisitive, psychological or coercive means. General population is being conditioned through propaganda to disregard threat.

We can expect it to be presented as "quarantine" from now on. If anyone has relatives in the anti-human forces, it would be helpful if you made them aware of who they serve. Not easy but, necessary.
1311243351769993216 2020-09-30 17:55:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I heard about this but, this example is pretty striking. Setting aside the obvious cognitive dysfunction and transparent noyouism, it's simple language warfare. I have a hard time imagining anyone could have made such a mistake leaving only conscious deception as an explanation.

Now, whole world is nearly completely subjugated under global totalitarian corporativism. Peaceful town level civil rebellion is only option.

Since they are coming from communism, most naked totalitarianism is unapologetically on display whereas the west, now transforming into corporativism from capitalism, is focused on concealing and obscuring its totalitarianism.

We need good answers to these questions (including me) and I hope more bitcoin folks will jump in with their take.

1311217714988568576 2020-09-30 16:13:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TJLK @alijillTN It's only a problem if someone attempts to suggest that markets could somehow exist absent capital. The markets are where we exchange capital.
1311216033672433664 2020-09-30 16:07:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @alijillTN @TJLK I'm happy to call it market economy, that's actually what it is. Free exchange of goods and services unhampered by state interference. Also known as liberalism, laissez-faire or anarcho-capitalism. Clarifying the lack of difference between these descriptions is the challenge.
1311214886622572544 2020-09-30 16:02:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TJLK @alijillTN Yes, the major point being that capitalism, as an economic system, is capable of allowing resources to find their most efficient usages through decentralized ownership and price function. Centrally planned resource allocation may not work at all and could never be an improvement.  https://t.co/22PZWF8BPS
1311210278407868419 2020-09-30 15:44:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @alijillTN @TJLK One of the misunderstandings that crops up a lot is the idea that capital is somehow unique to "capitalism." Even socialism has capital (buildings, goods, savings of any sort.) It's the consumption of that capital that ensures the finite nature of systems which cannot replenish.
1311188101256089600 2020-09-30 14:16:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KennedyNation He is basically saying that your employer would not pay you unless they feared being beaten up (so to speak) by government thugs. He is more or less placing the legitimacy of government (and taxes) on par with a (surprisingly well functioning and attentive) protection racket. 🙄
1311168427118276610 2020-09-30 12:58:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SwayCandy Me too but, animal keepers generally understand that their captives are (typically)  ill-equipped to survive in the wild. It's a very different mindset than prison guards.
1311166896612483072 2020-09-30 12:52:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @SwayCandy That implies a level of empathy which I think is not present.
1311163829066309632 2020-09-30 12:39:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LibertyCliff It needs to be understood that we are a command economy. Free movement is not allowable because it can't be planned. All actions taken by the state are related in some way to this most basic limitation of any planned economy. This has been apparent from the outset 6 months ago.

The people who resist drawing attention to it are afraid they were wrong and afraid of admitting this is not for their benefit. The people who celebrate it are beneficiaries in some way, either as guards or wardens.

Free movement cannot be allowed because it can't be planned. All policies inflicted on us will in some way revolve around this fact from now on regardless of the explanations provided.

1310931626671706112 2020-09-29 21:17:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @semicollegiate @ElliotA16608258 It's later revealed that he actually made some sort of deal with an ancestor personality so he really was at least partially possessed. His sister couldn't resist and became taken over by an ancestor so she killed herself if I remember correctly.
1310929877684584448 2020-09-29 21:10:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @semicollegiate @ElliotA16608258 Yes, the other thing is that he was exposed to the spice in the womb like his sister and they both survived. Their genetic memories were opened while still unborn. This makes his achievement of resisting possession impressive since he had no time to develop his own personality.
1310929007886696448 2020-09-29 21:06:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @semicollegiate @ElliotA16608258 He's happy about it and it's not just hope. It's understood that he is truly prescient so, he can see what the future will be when he achieves his goal. Moneo is only privy to part of conversation but, as the reader, you hear it all. This is why the movies are so hard to do well.

They laugh at him so he comes back out and confides with Moneo that they will destroy the myth of government.

Every time I read through I notice how good the other books are though. Highly recommended and very easy and entertaining to listen to in audio.
1310926075086753793 2020-09-29 20:55:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @semicollegiate @ElliotA16608258 I should explain a little more. The laughter mentioned is in his head. He has the entire memories of every person throughout history and those personalities are always trying to assert control. He can consult them but, possession is always a danger. I know, it's a little weird.
1310925497401040901 2020-09-29 20:52:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @semicollegiate @ElliotA16608258 You couldn't take it that way in context. I would find it hard to take any other other way even out of context though. What makes you think that? 🤔

Leto wrapped himself in sand trout (baby sand worms) and became a hybrid being with 3000 year lifespan. His blood line/spice exposure made him prescient so he could see all futures. It's a little complicated, lol.

1310800548438913026 2020-09-29 12:36:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NeoXJesus @sthenc It's not "tied to" the US dollar at all.
1310800175762415616 2020-09-29 12:34:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NeoXJesus @sthenc No, that would mean that bitcoin value, as expressed in dollars, would skyrocket.
1310799900251238401 2020-09-29 12:33:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NeoXJesus @sthenc You're not accounting (no pun intended) for its inherent security features. It's not just "Walmart Bucks."
1310798480559013888 2020-09-29 12:28:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NeoXJesus @sthenc I'm not sure what makes you think that. Do you mean if we lose all electricity and computers? Of course, hard currency is the mostly sure thing though, it is essentially barter at the level of personal exchange.
1310797808300183552 2020-09-29 12:25:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If anything positive comes from the riots it will be that we can point to them as demonstrable evidence of lack of consent of the governed. A potentially useful argument for mass recall.
1310796957854715904 2020-09-29 12:22:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NeoXJesus @sthenc Ironically, one possibility is that it's value is based on non-locality. It's certainly fiat though so, even I'm a little apprehensive. Gold seems better but, a gold economy wouldn't preclude promissory notes for which bitcoin may be an answer.

Unfortunately, we don't have the kind of time most of have invested in educating ourselves so there will have to be some deferment of specificity for time's sake.

Gather 500-1000 families to your town hall and remove your town officials. From there, ask the county and state officials to step down. Needs to be in all or, mostly all, 16000+ towns and simultaneous but, it's the only thing that will work.

As soon as they start to wake up, we will start to see real support for peaceful town level civil rebellion. I am confident that they will be really pissed off when they figure it out.

1310771901845905408 2020-09-29 10:42:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ACFederation Those libertarians (i.e. anarcho-capitalists) are correct understanding the ritual nature of voting. It should be apparent to anyone by now that expecting change from electing a candidate is ridiculous. Once you see the grand arc of statification for what it is, it's irrelevant.

I think they are putting new likes into cache records which are later deleted because many likes expire after a few days to a week.
1310755452918132737 2020-09-29 09:37:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @exyz_Jeremy Yup, I notice it on individual tweets that have no other likes mostly. If you zoom the tweet, you'll see that though the heart is filled in, the number is not present. When you unlike the heart, the number becomes "-1." If you toggle it in both views, it will eventually become 1.

1310554856881639425 2020-09-28 20:20:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Rastech919 The corporativist structure is state-centric so the government can't protect the public from corporations since they're virtual agencies of the state. Indeed, it's the state which grants them their limited liability and immunity from bankruptcy. They do the bidding of the state.

Decentralization is the general description of that arrangement. As long as we can move from town to town to flee government overreach, each of the 16000+ towns kept in check.

1310205824988590088 2020-09-27 21:13:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HollowChemist @WhipandSpoon Yes, and it's not the taxes corporations care about because they are always more able to pay them than challengers who might arise. It's the protection from legal recourse by citizens that limited liability granted by the state provides.
1310205101131337728 2020-09-27 21:10:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HollowChemist @WhipandSpoon Yes, town association are sort of presumed but, it needn't be a legal entity necessarily. I can think of reasons where that might be desirable though in terms of legal proceedings over water and resources, etc.
1310202812287143945 2020-09-27 21:01:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HollowChemist @WhipandSpoon Basically, I'm against state protectionism which is all corporatists arrangements really are.

Many such companies would likely fill transportation services for example due to the actual benefit of scale. I just mean no more companies with special limited liability state protection.

1310179300897939458 2020-09-27 19:27:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MADinMelbourne It's called the "cable-satellite public affairs network" and it was legislated into being when the central government sold the regional broadcast and direct distribution media monopolies to corporations in the late 70s.

So, the evil plan is racist but, that fact is a symptom rather than a cause.

1309638789372018688 2020-09-26 07:39:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I believe the first targets will be places with known resistance tendencies and existing public awareness such as Belarus and presented as "police actions." This is if assassinations, such as I suspect was case with the African leader who reported false testing, are ineffective.

As such, they will not help prevent it. If they're wrong, all is lost for nothing.
1309338230966321152 2020-09-25 11:45:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Just know that not all humans will be eradicated, just the useless eaters so the planet will not enjoy a reprieve of any sort, just a change of guard from groups of independent people to harvested chattel for which there'll remain a tightly controlled use for far into the future.
1309337633433309185 2020-09-25 11:43:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Many believe that the end of humanity will be a boon for the planet, you’ve been programmed to believe that, everyone has. It’s a hard thing to realize and accept. It’s possible to fight it but, you have to be aware and actually want to question the things you automatically do.

1309326688552132608 2020-09-25 10:59:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Make no mistake, this was no accident. This was a controlled demolition. I've confirmed plans going back at least a decade but, there are questionable sources which place it back much further. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give humanity a -3. Who would've thought it would be so easy?
1309326179770527744 2020-09-25 10:57:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The narrative is collapsing finally but, they’ve had half a year to consolidate. If it takes 6 months to get people to see such basic verifiable truths, we are completely lost so you can’t count on your neighbors. I was hoping for a different outcome but, I’m afraid it’s over.
1309325873238151168 2020-09-25 10:56:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It won’t be instantaneous but, the first casualty is always free speech. We can already see all the platforms mass banning opposition communications. This is why I was encouraging everyone to establish paper communication with their neighbors.
1309325738554859520 2020-09-25 10:55:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Historically, totalitarianisms trickle into being by the neglect of the caretakers. Once the reality sets in, simple misinformation becomes ineffective to subdue the population so the pure force model must be introduced.

1309055884006481921 2020-09-24 17:03:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Liberty_Vixen But, I would find it hard to believe no man is interested leaving only the possibility that they would expect to be required to submit to that institution. Therefore, informing them otherwise, tactfully and cautiously of course, may produce the results you desire.
1309050985864724480 2020-09-24 16:44:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @morgan_captain I should point out at the time when flat earth was the prevailing doctrine, many horrific crimes were committed by governments against their populations. I don't get the impression that it was all that much better back then before heliocentrism.
1309049973355446274 2020-09-24 16:40:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @morgan_captain As a student of economics, I am confident that I can draw direct cause and effect relationships between government policies/actions and their consequent harm to our civilization. Nihilism is really the default position absent some spiritual awareness. I think we do need religion.
1309048663876960256 2020-09-24 16:34:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @morgan_captain I think you understand my point so I'll consider that aspect mostly resolved.

1309039930161717252 2020-09-24 16:00:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @morgan_captain In many ways, it is like religious interpretations of the end times which, if taken to be inevitabilities, excuse completely the absolute voluntary submission of humanity to wretched evil so as to accelerate the second coming. Not my idea of a stalwart defense of liberty.
1309039090789167105 2020-09-24 15:56:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @morgan_captain I can't disagree that the meaning of life and the purpose and scope of the universe are ultimately greater questions but, practically speaking, it's at best a distraction from real and pressing concerns and at worst a disruption of confidence to insist on its consideration.

1308961152836263936 2020-09-24 10:47:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShaineScalph From a materialist/utilitarian perspective, socialist success (proven to be impossible by lack of price function btw) would be preferred over any less productive systems. But, you frame your question as "best to live under" for which socialism could have no hope of satisfying.
1308959569998213120 2020-09-24 10:40:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> This kind of research could be and probably is compartmentalized such that no researcher is aware of the other variations of the questionnaire. The results can then be collated by a the director of the variety of studies. Shocked at fact they are openly discussing this strategy.
1308957800807239683 2020-09-24 10:33:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JedManTalking Yes, that appears to be the plan.

1308956806765596673 2020-09-24 10:29:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DevourerofF @DolioJ Holy shit, was that just now?
1308955621719408641 2020-09-24 10:25:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JedManTalking Some of this could be bad code and server-side cacheing issues. If it updates to the correct numbers within an hour, that might be it. But, there's no explanation for what caught my attention when I logged in. I saw a tweet with 40 likes, clicked on like, and it went down to 33.
1308954182540578817 2020-09-24 10:19:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JedManTalking Well I'll be something-or-other. It didn't even occur to me to check that, lol. 👍  https://t.co/w0w1fu8g7F
1308953277657210880 2020-09-24 10:15:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Know_one2 I won't say it's likely that I could be convinced but, nothing's impossible with enough incontrovertible evidence. That said, a reason not to focus on that subject is there are so many other direct threats that have no baggage. Essentially, if the NWO is real, FE is irrelevant.

1308947221073866752 2020-09-24 09:51:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Case in point here. Count the users in the likes link at over 40 and compare it to the likes indicator currently showing only 6 likes. This is happening all over twitter.  https://t.co/8d6NqnCXIW

I will admit that I had to force myself to look into FE because I thought it was absurd from the get-go so, not my most open-minded research but, I did do it.

1308940458874335234 2020-09-24 09:24:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Liberty_Vixen Better than not doing it for sure but, if you're willing to do that it seems like it should be possible to find someone who is willing to be there but, not to sign the government contract which is the primary reason why most men hesitate to tie the knot. 🤔
1308939126150963200 2020-09-24 09:19:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ABoxintheBlack2 @NicolasDVillar1 @palladiummag They exist at the whim of the state and can be dissolved at any moment. I think the phenomenon you are referring to which is real is what is called regulatory capture. All it means is that the state's direction tends to prefer the special interests of the particular corporation.
1308937023445766144 2020-09-24 09:11:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ABoxintheBlack2 @NicolasDVillar1 @palladiummag All corporations are created by the state. That's the actual definition of them, the state grants them limited liability in return for allowing the state to direct their production through regulation.
1308936294546968583 2020-09-24 09:08:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ABoxintheBlack2 @NicolasDVillar1 @palladiummag Yes, they've been transitioning from communism to corporativism and we've been transitioning from about 50% market economy and 50% corporativism to what is now about 90% corporativism to meet them.
1308935760322662403 2020-09-24 09:06:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ABoxintheBlack2 @NicolasDVillar1 @palladiummag That doesn't sound like much of a refutation though. Besides being inaccurate on some major observations, it's internally contradictory to say that corporations aren't organs of the state because they are organs of another state.
1308934472767877122 2020-09-24 09:01:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 Short of austrian econ but wholly relevant is Bastiat. The Law is short and to the point and can be read in an hour or so.   https://t.co/NR35G9TZ4a
1308933847766183942 2020-09-24 08:58:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ABoxintheBlack2 @NicolasDVillar1 @palladiummag How come? 🤔
1308933575677546500 2020-09-24 08:57:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 Economics&gt;emotionalism, the truth is that far fewer people were destitute during the closet thing we had to free markets during the 19th century. Government policy has since intentionally demonized and dismantled private charity which used to pick up the slack.
1308932927091363840 2020-09-24 08:55:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 I would recommend diving into economics, specifically the austrian school. Once you get a grasp of the that, all questions about government can be reduced to interventionism vs noninterventionism. Socialism of any kind is always highly interventionist and, thus, destructive.
1308932185349595136 2020-09-24 08:52:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @EmperorReno1st Your response wasn't in my notifications, just happened to come back and check because they're doing that a lot too.
1308930509213511680 2020-09-24 08:45:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 All socialism is anti-economic and, therefore, irrational. It's hard to communicate the beneficial utility of free trade and the extended order to people who have never witnessed it. The only example being black market activity which has been demonized.  https://t.co/eKFuo7Fjnm
1308929626677350400 2020-09-24 08:41:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @moulds_w They've been doing that particular trick to me since late 2016. They like to wait for me to log out so they can have it last as long as possible. I just don't log out now and it keeps it to a minimum. The folks who unfollow are generally using automation so not a huge loss.
1308929003210899458 2020-09-24 08:39:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 Yup, corporativism is actually a form of socialism.
1308925349644980224 2020-09-24 08:24:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 The big corporations are actually agents of the state. Most people aren't aware that we are a command economy already.  https://t.co/p15a3ZyKZY
1308924944978505733 2020-09-24 08:23:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 I'm certain of it. I had better capabilities to detect it with the legacy interface but they shut down access to it a couple of months ago.
1308923345933602819 2020-09-24 08:16:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @9Nessa3 Sometimes the heart will go away after you click it but, I've found that that is usually related to network disconnections and/or really bad code. I'm more taling about the one where you, the user, sees the like persist but isn't actually submitted to the outward-facing counter.
1308922503084027906 2020-09-24 08:13:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NicolasDVillar1 @palladiummag It makes even more sense if you consider that these aren't capitalists at all. They're what's called corporativists and they are very much anti-capitalist.  https://t.co/4czzGvMDrn
1308921381439107072 2020-09-24 08:09:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If you want to be really thorough, you can go back through notifications to find likes you made on tweets with no other likes. You'll see a heart but, if you zoom the tweet, you won't see the number 1. Toggle the like a few times in both views and the 1 will eventually appear.
1308920177023737859 2020-09-24 08:04:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> And, obviously, notifications are almost turned off. In general, I will like a reply to any tweet so if I don't it's because I haven't been notified of it or it is being hidden from me entirely. That's not as big a deal but, worth mentioning as part of their gaslighting strategy.
1308912125327413253 2020-09-24 07:32:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LA_libertarian1 Yes, usually takes about a day from the point of reinstatement. It sucks but that's a separate problem from random unfollows.
1308911163997138944 2020-09-24 07:28:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LA_libertarian1 That sounds more like what they do when they challenge me as a bot. After I restore, my entire following list goes away temporarily but, usually gets restored after about a day. It's enough to strip off a decent amount of followers but, at this point my followers are savvy to it.
1308909380465758210 2020-09-24 07:21:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riseupmelbourne Yes, at least 50 since yesterday.
1308909163578302464 2020-09-24 07:20:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> So twitter is mass concealing likes. You can tell by comparing the list of users in the likes link to the like counter. They are also unfollowing users. Not sure what the criterion is yet but, easiest way to check is to peruse your follower list for people who you followed.
1308907941391749121 2020-09-24 07:15:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @spock246 @cathmckenna These people are zombies.
1308907366524620801 2020-09-24 07:13:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @riseupmelbourne I'm counting about 40 users in the likes link and only 10 in the like counter. I'm seeing this a lot right now. Twitter is removing all pretense.
1308905931598696449 2020-09-24 07:07:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PGroebbel Holy shit, you should read the first description of him on a google search. If the southern poverty law center calls him "a one-man organization of hate," you know he's a good guy, I'll check him out. Also, I'm specifically looking for high level officials who turn whistleblower.

1308900933812858880 2020-09-24 06:47:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NalaWasHere I'm seeing 47 users under the list of likes if you follow it just count them.
1308898325488435202 2020-09-24 06:37:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NalaWasHere So, I just clicked on the like which had a count of 40 and it switched to 33. Twitter is really tightening the screws and they clearly don't care what gets noticed anymore. 🤔
1308889912079527936 2020-09-24 06:04:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Here's my current assessment of some popular CTs:  True: anti-economic state propaganda pathogen experimentation on public vaccine damage EMF damage  False: flat earth AGW whites are nazis  Undecided: NWO (leaning heavily toward confirmed but, lacking high-profile whistleblowers)
1308884505881702400 2020-09-24 05:42:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jakfrac387 @n3rd_tty2 lol, in fairness though, I have to go back and look again anew. I was very convincingly deterred from a lot of this stuff by the photoshopped "giant skeletons" phase of the CT  genre. I'm trying to make sure that my dismissals are logical and not merely programmed responses.
1308882987011002368 2020-09-24 05:36:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jakfrac387 @n3rd_tty2 That sounds vaguely familiar. Must have been the giant reference I was talking about that sent me packing, lol.
1308882626154041344 2020-09-24 05:35:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jakfrac387 @n3rd_tty2 Cool, thanks, this is exactly the kind of thing I mean. Because so much of the misinformation propaganda is littered with legitimate info, there usually is something of value to be gained if I can hold my nose through the more absurd claims and pay attention to the details.
1308881757786300416 2020-09-24 05:31:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jakfrac387 @n3rd_tty2 I remember watching some of those and remember the underground facilities and construction overages but, for some reason I never associated it with aliens though, I vaguely remember giant references. I think I just stopped watching at that point. I should go back and watch again.
1308880833198067714 2020-09-24 05:28:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jakfrac387 @n3rd_tty2 Cool, the more I think about it, the more likely it appears that the primary object seems to be discrediting the forecasting element. If you look closely at the soldier, he isn't an alien but, seems to be wearing a gas mask. The rainbow and starving children are also predictive.
1308879185922928640 2020-09-24 05:21:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @smellycarney Surely, there are some exceptions? 🤔  https://t.co/uc6WI24CbI

Do you have more info/details of the conspiracy theories about the airport you could contribute? I know it might seem silly but, every bit of evidence, real or imagined, authentic or fabricated could be relevant.
1308876269833138176 2020-09-24 05:09:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Jakfrac387 @n3rd_tty2 In case you didn't follow the thread, that image is a hoax so we're trying to figure out what the motivation is. It ends up drawing attention to the much more ominous actual suspicious paintings at the airport. 🤔

1308708489984868355 2020-09-23 18:03:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Only thing that fits is an attempt to bundle Denver airport mystery in with mask controversy adding a little faux prophecy twist in to discredit the 'forecasting' phenomenon. Smells a lot like the bundling of anti-totalitarian criticism with flat earth I'm seeing more and more.
1308702364107497474 2020-09-23 17:38:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @agoriZmaniac This is one of the actual paintings from the airport.  https://t.co/L2CLxYJJpz
1308701213832163328 2020-09-23 17:34:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @agoriZmaniac Yes, and it's not really even that bad compared to what is there. We're trying to figure out what the motivation is to do it.

1308611718789169152 2020-09-23 11:38:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel It's interesting because this image appears to be a hoax but, as you may know, the actual images at the airport are much worse. Wondering if this is a misinformation campaign because there is a 200k person on the OPs thread who appears to claim to have seen this at the airport.🤔
1308611102436098048 2020-09-23 11:36:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @cliffreynolds13 @TheAliceSmith In fact, it's kind of the only way to guarantee that you don't.
1308602339465494529 2020-09-23 11:01:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DanQuixot1 Yeah, we concluded that and are discussing the possible motivations for presenting what is ultimately, a far less damning image than what actually exists at the airport. If you check the OP, there is someone who appears to be claiming to have seen this. 🤨
1308601752871219201 2020-09-23 10:59:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dnarby Yeah, these were the two first "conspiracy theories" I came across back in the 90s. I spent almost no time at all proving them to be true, such as they are. I took me until now to fully accept the nwo though which speaks both to my dubious nature and my obstinacy respectively.
1308593719734611968 2020-09-23 10:27:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Airy_Ale He's got 200K followers, though. Seems like one would be more careful about claiming eyewitness account for something that doesn't really matter. 😳
1308586542714281984 2020-09-23 09:58:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Airy_Ale Also makes me wonder about the guy in the OP's thread who claims that he lives there and that "it was always creepy." Awfully suspicious if you ask me. I assume he just knows that the art is creepy and wanted to make a comment and post a pic but... 🤔
1308584411936546822 2020-09-23 09:50:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Airy_Ale It seems like such misinformation is designed to deter interest in pursuing the history of the construction of the airport which is intriguing. Ironically, it rarely achieves this but instead starts people on the trail who then find the real stuff which is way worse.
1308583474098589696 2020-09-23 09:46:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Airy_Ale Yeah, that painting really isn't particularly bad compared to the others that are actually at the airport like this one that's just unbelievable. I remember when people were talking about how horrific it was 20+ years ago so they painted over it.  https://t.co/NZZBbPqZF3
1308580562416922632 2020-09-23 09:34:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @PetiteNicoco So, is all of it still in her? 🤮
1308578838394417159 2020-09-23 09:28:01 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JonahofNinevah Ah yes, the FBI who doesn't classify as "mass shootings" any incidents which have less than two point something casualties which happens to be the cutoff for incidents ended by individuals who are armed. Police-ended incidents have much higher casualties. 🙄
1308577345557729280 2020-09-23 09:22:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @n3rd_tty2 That makes more sense, I figured it would have to be recent. This one definitely was in the airport though. 😵  https://t.co/w8sOIJIDZ7
1308575553847537665 2020-09-23 09:14:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Airy_Ale When were you last in the airport?
1308575300524048389 2020-09-23 09:13:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Airy_Ale Someone posted in response to that tweet that he lives there and says it has always been creepy.

No major brawls need be had over government except locally.

It's virtually impossible for everyone everywhere to agree on a universal system so differing systems must be the norm. It's just a question of the size of differing systems' jurisdiction. I propose to keep them small. Decentralization minimizes the danger.

1308189070988906497 2020-09-22 07:39:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister I'm saying you should learn about epidemiology if you want to understand why people are upset with what is going on. From there, you can focus on any particular strategy or example you want. You could even start with polio epidemic of last century because of the plethora of data.
1308188147029880837 2020-09-22 07:35:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @knot_agency @dinfl577211 New test on the dental assistant exam for sure.
1308187579246948357 2020-09-22 07:33:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Apparently, refusing to understand a thing is thought to be adequate rebuttal. I'm seeing this a lot.
1308186184124960768 2020-09-22 07:27:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I'm guessing those are congresspeople voting 👍
1308184286592409600 2020-09-22 07:20:13 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @causticbob [checks notes] Has she been vaccinated?
1308184196784041985 2020-09-22 07:19:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Has she been vaccinated? 🤔
1308182812625973250 2020-09-22 07:14:22 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Do you mean google? 🤔
1308181606968983563 2020-09-22 07:09:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Start with polio if you want to start with an epidemic rather than the field generally. There's a lot of data from that initial catastrophic vaccine. It's also a primary example of the principle I suggest that herd immunity is the likely cause of the diminishment of outbreaks.
1308180663057739777 2020-09-22 07:05:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @johnnychop3 @cjsienna55 Also, we force them to be exposed to the sun. 🌞
1308179789254217729 2020-09-22 07:02:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister As I said, I had to force myself to learn about epidemiology first. The reason is because it is the only science which directly interfaces with public policy. Once you understand how that has worked in the past, you will begin to have an idea of what to research next.
1308178806461603840 2020-09-22 06:58:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @johnnychop3 @cjsienna55 And forbidden to lockdown too!
1308177889754591232 2020-09-22 06:54:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Yes, it was and is. But, the science is quite damning if you dive in.
1308177584505729024 2020-09-22 06:53:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @simonblackwell @beastynewall Ah, thanks for that. This is getting so bad that a little actual humor is refreshing. I'm pretty much reduced to simmering rage-adjacent sardonism. 🤣
1308176251430096896 2020-09-22 06:48:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister This is what I mean by dodgy btw. The post was condemning the practice of exposing participants to known risks for the purpose of equalizing the damage suffered by the two groups. If you hadn't gotten that, I'm not sure what the purpose is of this discussion.
1308175053167767554 2020-09-22 06:43:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister You initially misunderstood the post and after clarifying, defended the dishonest/immoral practice of misleading participants (even while recognizing the risk of NOT getting the medical benefit) into risking damage for the purpose of canceling out the known harms in disclosure.
1308173703260393473 2020-09-22 06:38:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister You are getting dodgy.
1308173564680515584 2020-09-22 06:37:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Yes, you'll have to start in epidemiology. That is, you will need to understand epidemiology generally, it's purposes, practice and historical significance first, then it's implementation as regards public policy.
1308172935291719685 2020-09-22 06:35:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister So, in many cases such polio, measles, mumps, rubella, etc., the population was already past the need or utility of vaccination. Considering the collateral damage they cause, there doesn't appear to have been a benefit at all as compared to the risk.
1308172259169898498 2020-09-22 06:32:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister It appears that, historically, herd immunity had been established before each credited vaccine. It's one of the great realizations I had when I began researching vaccines which I really didn't want to do. Both for fear of technical requirements and my relative indifference them.
1308171066544660482 2020-09-22 06:27:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Specifically Gardasil, for now.
1308170839129554945 2020-09-22 06:26:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister OK, if you are willing to, I would say go ahead and look up Gardasil first as it is the specific example I was alluding to.
1308170411105017858 2020-09-22 06:25:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister You should familiarize yourself with the actual science of epidemiology, immunology, and virology so you at least have the ability to understand the objections to the very idea of vaccination as against natural immunity in context of the risk/benefit analyses for each pathogen.
1308169678557270019 2020-09-22 06:22:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister I am extending the logic out. If consent is no longer relevant in one area of state enforced medicine, it will soon become obsolete in others. One day you have mandatory vaccinations, the next you have mandatory experimental vaccinations. This is already happening.
1308169126653964293 2020-09-22 06:19:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames That is, if left to the judgement of intelligent and informed people about the risk vs benefit analysis, almost nobody would choose to vaccinate.
1308168896931926018 2020-09-22 06:19:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames Yes, actuarially speaking vaccines cannot be profitable if left to the discretion of the potential users. That is quite aside from the necessity to compete with the numbers of immune people as a result of natural majority immunity by mass injection before such immunity manifests.
1308168165713739778 2020-09-22 06:16:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister What about the safety testing, how is that to be completed? You seem to be grasping at details in an attempt to obfuscate the dubious nature of the Gardasil vaccine. I though you wanted to talk about that and not other vaccines?
1308167162717253635 2020-09-22 06:12:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister You asked me for copies of the consent forms. It would seem that you wanted to expand the discussion in that direction but, if you didn't, I apologize for mentioning additional information.
1308166759682322439 2020-09-22 06:10:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister The believe the UK has already purchased 90 million doses. But no, you are correct, it does not officially exist yet. There simply isn't enough time to test the safety or long term effects of a new gene therapy in less than a decade so any therapy won't actually be safety tested.
1308165802672164864 2020-09-22 06:06:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister It is my understanding that all such exemptions will be removed. Perhaps that's only a proposed development, not sure. It's certainly going in that direction.
1308164046357696512 2020-09-22 05:59:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister I believe it's basically all of them.
1308163963839041538 2020-09-22 05:59:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Massachusetts is mandating them now.
1308163803796963329 2020-09-22 05:58:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Yes, the original tweet had to do with the consent of the victims of the trial not being properly carried out. Now, I'm talking about the existing vaccines now becoming mandated in various states already. You may not be aware that they are no longer implemented with consent.
1308158733516668930 2020-09-22 05:38:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Not sure what you mean. I'm bringing up the newly mandated vaccination schedules rolling out in many states already. The presumption is that they will be mandated everywhere. Thus, consent is irrelevant.
1308157296774705156 2020-09-22 05:32:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Well, they did. All of them will be mandatory anyway so consent is officially illegal.

1308154813708988420 2020-09-22 05:23:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister I wouldn't say that but, that was not the case for Gardasil anyway.
1308154509227589633 2020-09-22 05:21:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister Correct, which means they were aware of the side effects of the medium/adjuvants.

1308151500418449408 2020-09-22 05:09:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister The sound scientific reason seems to be the ability to declare no difference in likelihood of the acquisition of autoimmune disorders between the two.

1308143406376509441 2020-09-22 04:37:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @madbarrister You should probably read the scenario again.

1308139643339145217 2020-09-22 04:22:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JedManTalking I believe it was done. It wouldn't be that hard to do, just replicate the experience and give a saline shot.
1308139325964595202 2020-09-22 04:21:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mr__liberty Sounds an awful lot like the kind of human experimentation which repulses us doesn't it? On the plus side, they inadvertently established in their own study the specific harm caused not by the immunization but by its secondary ingredients.
1308137334307684356 2020-09-22 04:13:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> What if you volunteered your child for an experimental vaccine and they developed a severe autoimmune disorder? What if you found out they were in the control group which included everything from vaccine but the vaccine part? What if children given a true placebo didn't? What if?

There had to be some kind of demonstration after the obvious nuclear espionage was revealed. Perhaps the US government was simply in league the whole time.

It was dramatically reduced before McCarthy even got started and it was still really bad by then. He obviously wasn't able to finish the job.

1307936797868077057 2020-09-21 14:56:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Trinity_X_ Yeah, I guess so. The weak just let themselves die. I suppose it's for the best if that's really the case. How do we stop them from taking us with them though?
1307936399698669568 2020-09-21 14:55:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @JSmiffey I'm being a little hyperbolic in my use of term "fight." I don't mean actually fighting, just becoming informed or speaking out. I guess speaking your mind is now a drastic action. The communists have been programmed to be berserkers and don't count, they're just free ordinance.
1307933745291374592 2020-09-21 14:44:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> So, it would seem that those who might have fought for the freedom of others in the past simply won't do so this go around. I suppose I can understand since their sacrifice would not be appreciated or that's the message they're getting from their peers anyway. It's really tragic.
1307932116643131392 2020-09-21 14:38:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @semicollegiate @Angry_Okinawan Maybe fighters have been bred out of the gene pool altogether. It would be evolutionarily consistent since we must presume that it's the fighters who fight and die and usually before they procreate so whoever is left by definition won't fight, historically speaking. 🤔
1307931174023696384 2020-09-21 14:34:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Angry_Okinawan I'm really more talking about ordinary people who have comparatively ordinary lives.

This can't be a survival trait. Is it evolutionarily beneficial to the species in some way that I don't understand? Where does it come from?

I can't imagine anyone would think doing what they are doing would do anything but lose them the election.

That's why I don't think it's particularly important whether global police violence is staged or not, it's just that it's worse if it is. Proving that could be useful though.

The primary accusation I level at blm is that it's a communist organization and that it specifically intends to start a race war which will then become a class war. It's plainly revolutionary communist 101.

Fabricating such things has a significance of its own. I don't think being blasé about it is good though. Seems like it would lead to shrugging off actual events.
1307102941116014602 2020-09-19 07:43:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @HFREEMA83843708 @IkeB247 @Alex_7_Art Yes, I'm talking about this shit, not so much riots, etc.
1307102263673073664 2020-09-19 07:40:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @twatterpro @Freelanceroffu1 Correct, that's isolation and it's part of any immunity plan. Universal medical isolation means that everybody is subjected to it, not just at-risk and contagious. 🙄
1307101529594310656 2020-09-19 07:37:44 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IkeB247 @Alex_7_Art I guess what I'm getting at is that shrugging these thing off is indicative of a predisposition to indifference. I had it too and had to shake myself loose. Hope for the best sure but, do not eschew the worst, especially if you already suspect. Faking this would be significant.
1307099274388418565 2020-09-19 07:28:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IkeB247 @Alex_7_Art I guess what I'm asking is, so what now? Are you going to research the video and provide details so that we can be sure of whether it's legitimate or not? I'll admit that I am not volunteering to do the leg-work on that myself but, I'm also not impugning the source.
1307095595014856705 2020-09-19 07:14:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @DemonsDestroyer I say document it all. It's something people can do or delegate to their kids as a civics lesson. Maybe even get the schools to provide logistical assistance. Probably the only useful thing they could ever do.

1307094357217095683 2020-09-19 07:09:14 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IkeB247 @Alex_7_Art Do you have an absolute 100% reliable source for anything? By that logic you could just ignore all of the news. I don't disagree that might be the best thing to do but, I'm doubtful of the utility of impassable confirmation requirements for exposure to potentially relevant info.
1307084113841664005 2020-09-19 06:28:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @twatterpro @Freelanceroffu1 Are you saying that there has been a universal medical isolation order for every (or any) previous epidemiological situation? If so, please provide the details.

Does it mean the government is allowing itself to be framed for violations it actually doesn't commit? I'm not talking about riots btw, I'm talking about medical tyranny.
1307078192004567043 2020-09-19 06:04:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IkeB247 @Alex_7_Art Yes, they have been batoning, tasing, choking, hitting with cars, etc. It can be argued that some of these documented accounts are staged but, who but the state would do that? None of them have been disavowed that I know of.
1307077224743436290 2020-09-19 06:01:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @IkeB247 @Alex_7_Art That's what I meant too. How many media companies are likely to be spending money misrepresenting police activity in such a way as to support the outrage against masks though? How many would be likely to do so in favor of masks by intimidation? Are you saying they're both likely?

It is not even a possible valid procedure in epidemiology because it could serve no purpose. It wasn't recommended by medical professionals and certainly not by epidemiologists.

1307058123685933057 2020-09-19 04:45:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @stacey_rudin @DNC I certainly don't think the Democrats have a chance n this election, do you? It fits with the playbook for "reactionary" authoritarian measures too and very few if any actual bad guys have been dealt with. Four years is not a short period of time to have done something.
1307057639965294597 2020-09-19 04:43:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @stacey_rudin @DNC A possibility to consider is that Trump is under duress or complicit. If so, without too many logical somersaults, it can be imagined that keeping him in office serves the interests of the nwo since Trump supporters are effectively nullified waiting for him to fix everything. 😟

1307043592809132033 2020-09-19 03:47:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The dubious who aren’t yet refusing to wear masks are still gauging the long-term outlook. As soon as it becomes clear it'll end or will never end, the silent-muzzled will stop being pussies. I understand the fight another day argument but, what'll a day down the road look like?

1306707313789743104 2020-09-18 05:31:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @knutacious What I mean to say is the idea that society can be improved or that the ills of government can be eliminated or even minimized by political and/or legislative processes is not a believable position to hold. The fact that he asserts it is evidence of misunderstanding or deception.
1306699080765263873 2020-09-18 04:58:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @efreshwater5 Of course, there is no possibility of substantive reform. We do not have to allow them to collapse society though. We can decentralize through peaceful town level civil rebellion.
1306696620801744896 2020-09-18 04:48:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KantBreal Did you need to be told that by a politician though? Does what constitutes a threat by him on part of gun owners likely to dissuade government officials from their ever expanding and accelerating unconstitutional behavior? I see no useful purpose to such bluster, it's theatre.
1306694333366710280 2020-09-18 04:39:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> When I hear things like this from politicians, I am immediately suspicious. Their job is supposedly to ensure our liberties, not threaten violence by proxy as if that were a solution to anything. The implied retaliation by potential victims against aggressors goes without saying.
1306691108739653649 2020-09-18 04:26:52 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @seekthetruth27 They are trying to provoke violence. The only answer is peaceful town level civil rebellion. Mass recall all sitting officials in each town and then we can work our way up. It needs to be by locals, in every town, and simultaneous but, it will work.
1306688010671583235 2020-09-18 04:14:33 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @knutacious I don't think we have time for corrections via political processes even if such methods could work which I do not believe. Even if I were willing to entertain the possibility, he doesn't appear to be well versed in economics or the science of freedom as the solution.
1306686317804367875 2020-09-18 04:07:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @knutacious I'm past any confidence in political/legislative repair. Just as we'd be happy to accept defrocked mayors as consultants for criminal discovery when we have trials, any sympathetic legislators would also be welcome to advise. Strangely, he appears to believe government can work.
1306663133457637383 2020-09-18 02:35:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AdamsJoenice @Iberianite 500-1000 families in each of the 16000+ towns conduct a mass recall of all sitting officials at their town halls. From there, ask county and state officials to step down. Federal will be tricky but, there would be no possibility of claiming consent at that point.
1306662336250421253 2020-09-18 02:32:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Liberty_Jedi All the more reason to act before the plan has run its course any further. With every town official recalled and demands for the resignations of all sitting officials, no government could claim consent which is the single claim to legitimacy actually proffered.
1306640771832049664 2020-09-18 01:06:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Liberty_Jedi As expert at murder as the state is, it still does work against its interests since the whole operation depends on the majority being sympathetic to them. I believe any significant mass murders would be bad publicity and ultimately backfire.
1306639856328679424 2020-09-18 01:03:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AdamsJoenice @Iberianite I won't oppose demonstrations per se but, I do not think there is a lot of utility in them as it amounts to little more than asking for permission to live. It will take time to notify enough people in every town of mass recall but, it is the only mechanism which will work.
1306540725404921856 2020-09-17 18:29:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TyWebb1975 @previouslyGO372 @angrycrackbaby However, in that case, if they did murder families to protect their mayor's job, I think we should rather be alerted to this danger now rather than allow such a condition to persist. Because if that is true already, it could only get much worse if we failed to act now decisively.
1306539165128024068 2020-09-17 18:23:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TyWebb1975 @previouslyGO372 @angrycrackbaby Most towns have police who live in the area. Many are familiar with people in town and know their neighbor's children's names, families even interact. It makes mass murdering groups of families removing town officials from office very unlikely though, as you say, not impossible.

Remove all sitting officials and reassess our civilization as an association of 16000+ decentralized towns. I believe Trump is either in on the occupation or he is under duress of some kind and cannot help.
1306526339915280385 2020-09-17 17:32:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I think we can all see clearly that the worst possible outcome of this election in the US, from the perspective of the nwo/un, would be a Trump loss. A significant portion of the population is benched so long as they can maintain hope in his ability, next term, to fix everything.

It is a universal salve as well as any country can do it. It would be particularly helpful if all countries did it together.

I think we are an occupied country and the deployment of native paramilitary resources have been deployed to contain the population. The artificial pandemic has been used to destroy economy/infrastructure as starvation is the most effective tool for subjugation.

If they stay home on liberty day, they won't oppose the decentralized world they'll find when they emerge. I estimate 500-1000 families in each town is ideal, perhaps far fewer will be sufficient.
1306518781250990080 2020-09-17 17:02:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 @angrycrackbaby From what I can tell, we are already an nwo/un occupied region. What prompted me to ring the alarm bell was my judgement that we had already become a command economy in March or before. It will be important to be ready to defend against external attacks after decentralization.

I would prefer we manage the  collapse at the town level. If we don't, the death throws of the overfed monster will cause massive destruction if allowed to claim legitimacy.
1306516215423266817 2020-09-17 16:51:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 @angrycrackbaby If all towns have mass recalled their officials and are demanding the resignations of their county and state officials, there are just too many targets. The federal government can't invade america any more than any other military can and, if it tried to, it would collapse.

Most of these specialized systems are pretty boutique so the likelihood of average towns having such equipment at the ready in any kind of decisive quantities and that town employees would deliberately fire at their neighbor's family is pretty low.

If the federal government decides to use weapons of mass destruction on the US population which I doubt, it would be better to find that out now than to wait for further entrenchment.

It would therefore only require a vaccine fatality rate of that much to negate any benefit. The actual vaccine effectiveness rate is typically around 50% making it worthless.

1305996938358272000 2020-09-16 06:28:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jarurik @minvcivs Just explaining why, for instance, there is a plethora of woodchipper memes. I can guarantee you it isn't because people are interested in seeing it.

1305994883199623169 2020-09-16 06:20:19 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @jarurik @minvcivs It is helpful to imagine this being presented as a response to a variety of transgressions to assist with objective analysis (if this was a no-mask crime for instance.) Ultimately though, the purpose of public executions is to convey sufficient fear to discourage the behavior.
1305993662367756290 2020-09-16 06:15:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Vanyathalias Yes, autism statistics are actually very damning. Somehow, they've managed to disincentivize that discussion. The primary obfuscation though, is the complete lack of comparative analyses of any kind. Much as in Keynesian economics, the consideration of externalities is eschewed.
1305991670094274560 2020-09-16 06:07:32 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Vanyathalias Vaccine damage mostly, that's the one that nullifies all of it.

Mostly indifferent with automatic pass on past implementations and mild to moderate skepticism of new developments. Once I learned the actual history of the supposed successful campaigns and current statistics, my jaw dropped.

1305908737299939330 2020-09-16 00:38:00 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ACFederation This is actually the primary threat of capitalism. That those of lesser capability, motivation, and ingenuity can reproduce at competitive or superior rates to the supposed "winners" of social darwinism. Not to be defeated, family and broad prosperity itself become their target.
1305908008837414913 2020-09-16 00:35:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ACFederation It's a tricky thing though because social darwinism is the basis for all of their plans. To dictate it, that is, rather than observe it. Whereas, in capitalism, the bold notion is to deny it by making the possibility of fatal error smaller and smaller thus increasing survivors.

Before the event, we were 50% corporativist. I'd say we are now 85% corporativist. Perhaps it is much higher since I haven't considered the welfare state component which can glom onto any of them.

Almost everything they do in their shows is already in the discussion on twitter so, it's not that they provide that much in the way of data or analysis. Dave has great interviews though. 👍

I started to follow the Fort Detrick thread back in March and was convinced it originated there before they moved the project over to wuhan but, by then it was becoming apparent that the virulence was low.

1305651196083015680 2020-09-15 07:34:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw And Dave Cullen was still on board with the narrative actually back then too so, neither influenced me.
1305650852326146054 2020-09-15 07:33:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw No, I discovered him a couple of months after.
1305650658226384899 2020-09-15 07:32:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's certainly true that those who are aware of austrian econ would have a nose for government antics. I saw a bit of a slow uptake on rejecting the narrative but, I believe I'm seeing an awakening. When did you become mostly convinced of the nefarious nature of the all this?
1305647390381223936 2020-09-15 07:19:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Also, I say start with Italy because the china data is all over the place and completely unreliable from whatever angle you might look at it. I'd say the cruise ship case was the deciding moment for me that something was off.
1305645870021476358 2020-09-15 07:13:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw You sound like me, I didn't listen to the presented data from main stream outlets and didn't know of anyone to ask really so, I just did the research myself. I have to admit, I would not be so confident in my conclusions if I was just repeating the conclusions of others. Dig in.

1305644003338133504 2020-09-15 07:06:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw I was actually semi-provax when I started, at least for what I thought were established successes. That's why the early case studies are helpful. Understanding procedure and statistics helps and viewing the disasters turned me off to just about all of them. Children get 72 now.😢

1305641040200728576 2020-09-15 06:54:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw I just gave you many avenues to explore, jump in and decide for yourself.
1305640652047347713 2020-09-15 06:52:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Forget him then, do your own research as I've recommended. It's the only way you will be convinced anyway and that's not a bad thing. However, you are speaking as if you have been convinced without reviewing any of the data. That is a problem.
1305640251784912903 2020-09-15 06:51:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Btw, you should start with Italy so you can see big boom that caused the ruckus and then see the revised numbers after the scandal was exposed. Actual deaths was 10%-15% of reported. The cruise and navy ships are also very informative early case studies.
1305639026234454017 2020-09-15 06:46:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw I'll take that as a no.
1305638918528917504 2020-09-15 06:45:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw I actually didn't know he wrote books until a few episodes in and he doesn't really talk about them except in the context of fighting pharmaceutical companies and exposing UK gov madness. Have you actually watched an episode yet?
1305638393007702022 2020-09-15 06:43:45 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw So, it sounds like you are actually turned off by the implications of his conclusions rather criticizing any of the data.
1305637726360920064 2020-09-15 06:41:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @suenigma2 @beelzeb22736886 If it did work, vaccinating the at-risk would eld the discussion since everyone who is susceptible to it would potentially be protected. There is no logic to vaccinating the general population. It's actually supposed to be the 'at-risk' who are quarantined until virus burns out.
1305637092844883970 2020-09-15 06:38:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @suenigma2 @beelzeb22736886 My understanding is that they are all of the gene therapy variety. If they aren't, then they are just repeating the failures of the past 50 years of attempts to immunize against coronavirus. Bad as it is in my estimation considering side effects, at least it might work for 50%.
1305635560904691712 2020-09-15 06:32:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw I guess you'll just have to do the research on your own then. It's better that way anyway. I started by reviewing the actual results from past vaccination campaigns and epidemiological procedures. Then I moved on to virology and immunology. I only started serotology, not done.
1305634781137440770 2020-09-15 06:29:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Again, I'm interested to hear about the things he has commented on in the past if they are relevant but, your avoidance of the chief topic is getting a bit suspicious. Is your point that you won't listen to him or that he is wrong? And if he is wrong, can you explain in what way?
1305634122761728000 2020-09-15 06:26:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw I only discovered him some months ago but apparently he has published hundreds(?) of books, many fiction.

1305631122789928963 2020-09-15 06:14:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw It's kinda hard to read? I have to admit, I've never been to his website. I had already researched on my own when I found him so I was just happy to find someone else saying what I was saying. I think his presentation is effective for laymen.
1305629296929767424 2020-09-15 06:07:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Does this mean I'm a heavyweight now? 🤔  https://t.co/IERjohByCV

1305627177271144449 2020-09-15 05:59:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Doesn't ring any bells, what were the circumstances? Does that affect your interpretation of the information he presents or just make you unwilling to consider it? It seems a little weak and an obvious character attack unrelated to the topic. Am I wrong? 🤔
1305626170306818048 2020-09-15 05:55:11 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @spirit_llama Is this an excerpt from a study of cognitive dissonance?

Since almost everything in mass media is tainted, we should be careful not to accept official narratives. I've seen enough evidence to be convinced though, as you suggest, it doesn't surprise me.
1305624399819792387 2020-09-15 05:48:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @AmeliaAResister Nope.
1305624294236585987 2020-09-15 05:47:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BruceRayCarr1 Nope, bad data derived from an incorrect model.  Even the UK gov concluded the same.  "As of 19 March 2020, COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious disease (HCID) in the UK."   https://t.co/iPRtMuBxyw

1305621040081653765 2020-09-15 05:34:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BruceRayCarr1 50%-80% probably already have immunity, yes. T-cell response may be strong enough even if compatible antibodies aren't already present.

1305620507350499331 2020-09-15 05:32:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @suenigma2 @beelzeb22736886 The "vaccine" under development is actually a gene therapy which updates cells with custom instructions to build custom designed boutique antibodies. Once infected your immune system will not attack the therapy infected cells potentially converting you to a managed immune system.
1305619025095995392 2020-09-15 05:26:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Stick with it, it's important.
1305618751468048385 2020-09-15 05:25:42 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @BruceRayCarr1 Fatalities would have to exceed 0.1% to compete with recorded death rate (highly disputed.) But, the idea is that only 50% actually get immunity from the vaccine and in examples like polio in africa, vaccine introduced lab version into the wild making it a common disease again.

1305616629754101762 2020-09-15 05:17:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @suenigma2 @beelzeb22736886 Did you know that no vaccine has ever been developed for a coronavirus? It's the origin of the old adage "there's no cure for the common cold." These vaccines aren't likely to have much better than a 50/50 chance to be effective either. If harmful, not worth it (99.9% survivable)
1305615339212935174 2020-09-15 05:12:08 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Basically no epidemiologists recommend universal medical isolation. The goal of epidemiology is to study and possibly mitigate possible harm from infectious agents. The recommendations are to medically isolate at-risk patients, not healthy patients. It's not hard to understand.🙄
1305614701754298373 2020-09-15 05:09:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @GabbyMcNabb @joshdcaplan @GlenWoodfin So you think that map was selecting only US territory? That is possible. 🤔
1305614326577979392 2020-09-15 05:08:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @suenigma2 @beelzeb22736886 I think they already had a vote for compulsory vaccinations, not sure what the result was though. Much of the policy is actually dictated by the WHO under the existing health emergency treaties requiring uniform state action as directed by the UN.
1305613824637177858 2020-09-15 05:06:07 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw I think if you spend some time investigating the nature of our situation it will become apparent that we are in the process of a corporativist takeover of the entire world and the fate of humanity may very well be at stake. Unfortunately, I'm not even over-dramatizing it.

Unfortunately it doesn't really address the question of masks since 80% would never even have symptoms.  https://t.co/mVnRq6Qbda
1305611064416112640 2020-09-15 04:55:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw 🤦‍♂️ If you actually read those you would see a lot of what I'm talking about. Let ask you something which I typically bring up after identifying a simpering sterilist.  If masks do work, did the government use the police to spread the pathogen during the height of the "pandemic?"
1305608353817735169 2020-09-15 04:44:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @suenigma2 @beelzeb22736886 You too? 🙄
1305608000833572864 2020-09-15 04:42:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw But, somehow, everything else the government does is? Because they would never do that to people outside of concentration camps? Can you see the disconnect? 🤔
1305607706552696832 2020-09-15 04:41:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw The reason I know you have done zero research is because each of your statements is false and discovering that is about as easy as having lunch.
1305606659570569216 2020-09-15 04:37:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @suenigma2 I do recognize that difference.The key phrase, in my mind anyway and that's not necessarily how it's taken by others, is the concluding statement that these crimes are happening in a concentration camp.
1305605481445167104 2020-09-15 04:32:58 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw It's always the ones who don't pay attention who say things are peachy. 🙄
1305605007471972352 2020-09-15 04:31:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw In Victoria, only one person is allowed to leave a household and only for 1 hour.
1305604846284951560 2020-09-15 04:30:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Tonybaloney305 Yes, all of the things which reduce healthy normal exposure to common pathogens reduces immune response. Specifically though, the flu vaccine has been conclusively shown to reduce overall immune response by 30% or more.
1305604496400281603 2020-09-15 04:29:03 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Wisernow2019 It's astonishing how many "Christians" are on board with all of this.
1305604304234065922 2020-09-15 04:28:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @TricksParler No, very much against the state harming or sterilizing people.

1305603182563856392 2020-09-15 04:23:50 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @MarieMi64772900 Lab version of polio delivered by the vaccine is now the prevalent strain in the wild. Also, the first batch of polio way back when gave thousands polio as well and by the time it was brought under control, herd immunity is much more likely to have been credited with halting it.

1305601341616787457 2020-09-15 04:16:31 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ActualDavidShaw Reduced immune response from vaccines, social distancing, mask wearing, lack of sunlight, increased fear and confusion, reduced exercise, etc. That's some of the obvious dots anyway.

Granted, merely sterilizing is not a hysterectomy but, from the perspective of a hopeful mother, it is the same.
1305599618504364034 2020-09-15 04:09:40 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @heart_stamper Not sure whether to try to help you. Have you read any documentation before from medical studies or analyzed clinical results? Are you able to use logic and reason?

1305594561247535105 2020-09-15 03:49:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Let me get this straight, the pro-abortion totalitarian sterilists willing to harm everyone's immune response and potentially render barren every woman who takes a mandatory vaccine at what amounts to gunpoint are upset that there were mass hysterectomies in a concentration camp?

1305310403946315782 2020-09-14 09:00:26 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @comicalwagner I am guessing their PR team is trying to decide whether to parry, attack or retreat.

1305302394125905923 2020-09-14 08:28:36 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The suggestion here would seem to imply that those who genuinely abhor the evils of murder should watch Texas Chain Saw Massacre and those who do watch it are doing so because they need to be convinced. Not to mention the advertising which is clearly inconsistent with an exposé.
1305300392054583299 2020-09-14 08:20:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Perhaps comments like this explain the accusations of "libertarian" sympathy for this.  There are too many aspects to comment on in a tweet but, much like horror movies which appropriately cast the antagonist as the bad guy, the horror enthusiast typically watches for the gore.

You're really making the claims you're making. Ordinarily there would be some sort of substantial argument or reasonable doubt injected by an effective refutation. Such a case is conspicuously absent.

I described the only way that would be possible. I should add that I'm essentially ignoring chemistry and working only with the potential physics involved. Note that the engine would have to be dead center.

1305286030128537600 2020-09-14 07:23:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline The release of the center load from the outer load-bearing structure would not produce additional stress on the now lightened load conveyed to the outer frame in your scenario. It also fails to explain the simultaneous failure of the outer struts. Thank you for explaining though.

Communism suggested that, after totalitarian subjugation and equalization of the population, the state would no longer be necessary, a projected ideal in the distant future. Syndicalists view it as a first stage to the corporativist order.

I thought you acknowledged the demolition on building 7 but were accepting the idea that it was a normal thing to wire a building for on-call demolition which is one of the intermediate explanations which many people have settled on.
1304890338486767618 2020-09-13 05:11:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline So far you've only made evidentially contradictory statements and character attacks. This is hardly a debunk of the postulate. I certainly am not declaring agreement w/theory of the "energy weapon" idea. I am however newly committed to inspecting the available data and opinions.
1304889369036296192 2020-09-13 05:07:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline It's plain as day that building 7 was a controlled demolition. What makes you think otherwise?
1304820673248923650 2020-09-13 00:34:25 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline Although not the official narrative which claims that it collapsed because of fire, if the building had always been wired for demolition at any time, that would mean that anyone working in a federal building could at any time be killed if the government decided to demolish it.
1304820191029874695 2020-09-13 00:32:30 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline I'm primarily talking about WTC 7 which was a separate building from the two towers but which clearly collapsed in free fall. It was not struck by any planes. You should look into it.
1304798126121906178 2020-09-12 23:04:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline So, despite my hesitance, I'm considering all of the offered explanations. It's only prudent considering what has been revealed about the nature and goals of government. Aside from confirmed technical capability and a specific name for a weapon system, not necessarily impossible.
1304797357624758272 2020-09-12 23:01:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline I'm not certain about what exactly felled the twin towers themselves though, I'm convinced that the simultaneous failure of all structural supports causing free fall is essentially impossible. The reported explosions in the elevator shafts are indicative of controlled demolition.
1304796742701977600 2020-09-12 22:59:20 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @mike_soja @drbairdonline It is apparent that WTC 7 was demolished. That much I accepted close to 20 years ago. At the beginning of the rollout of the global corporate totalitarian state I decided to explore all theories regardless of my preconceptions. So far, only flat earth appears to be utter rubbish.

1303810976324751361 2020-09-10 05:42:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 The idea being that the unpulsed signal is uniformly lower power while the pulsed signal delivers the accumulated power from the untransmitted power cycle thus delivering the extra energy which more deeply penetrates organic tissue.
1303810463579492352 2020-09-10 05:40:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 It may be that the disruption of cells is dramatically increased by discordant disruption but, I'll modify your sentence as:  [If they were to send one continuous wave (at 1000 watts) instead of pulsating it often (at 2000 watts per pulse,) all of it would be far less dangerous.]
1303808049417723912 2020-09-10 05:30:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 Could be technical miscommunication on my part. I think damage could be experienced at lower power levels but higher ought to be more dangerous. A low power level transmitter could be made more dangerous by pulsing but, it's not the pulse but the power achieved that causes damage
1303806447898300416 2020-09-10 05:24:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 The CIA one (from 2012?) does specifically refer to SHF (super high frequency) which is in the millimeter range.
1303805560563916801 2020-09-10 05:20:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 It's a minor terminogical point but, I think you said pulsing is the issue and I said power levels is the issue. Since pulsing is done to increase power output at the cost of intermittency, I think we are discussing the same feature.

1303803693054210048 2020-09-10 05:13:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 As a digital signal, the data must be quantized somehow so maybe some of this is due to confusion of terms but, in the legacy (pre-80s) reports, they would not be referring to pulsing as a data transmission delimiter but as an accumulation/discharge cycle I imagine, dunno tho.

1303801881693696000 2020-09-10 05:06:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @previouslyGO372 I had heard that some of the techs doing installations were reporting what they thought were levels above whatever level they were used to seeing. I believe they were talking about fixed outdoor installations. My understanding is that you pulse to get intermittent higher power.

Not looking good though as very high power levels seem to be a regular claim by whistleblowers of the modern installations. That's without considering frequency specific effects.

There's nothing worth saving above the local level. The most difficult agency to decentralize is the military but it's by no means impossible.

Microwave irradiation excites molecules to the point of damage. Near as I can tell, oxygen uptake reduction is associated with lung, etc. exposure.

If people manage things for themselves in smaller geographical areas with smaller less powerful governments then they have a better chance of avoiding the mistakes made by others.

1302951518145056768 2020-09-07 20:47:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @coolrandompers1 @Freelanceroffu1 That's my faulty for not clarifying. I'm a decentralist so I believe many competing human arrangements sharing their results, much like the scientific method, is the best way for humans to survive and advance. The mistake of statists is the assumption of a vast occupied territory

1302948386430218241 2020-09-07 20:34:37 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @coolrandompers1 @Freelanceroffu1 I don't think so. If anything, the family structure preceded society and government was later modeled on the absolute authority of the parents (typically the father) long after society was well on its way as a way. Society exists with or without government as well as any interim.

They seem to merely be advanced criminal organizations which are unavoidable when monopoly control is granted to a subset of participants or, worse, to non-participants.
1302944519571345411 2020-09-07 20:19:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @coolrandompers1 @Freelanceroffu1 Whether it was defined or not, intended or not, theft, rape, kidnapping, and murder all exist as specifically allowed government procedures or are tacitly legal since the government does not police itself.
1302943988845076480 2020-09-07 20:17:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @coolrandompers1 @Freelanceroffu1 Nobody knows how everybody should live, what they they should do, etc. Any attempts to make human existence uniform, such as  central authority, is manifestly counter or anti-human and certainly anti-progress. It is better to allow men to administrate, if they must, with locals.
1302939115244191746 2020-09-07 19:57:47 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @KantBreal We let the government "educate" our children. We might not recover from that mistake this time.

1302933782073352193 2020-09-07 19:36:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @kkrnorth Yes, they should be probably be tried for child abuse.
1302933582273536005 2020-09-07 19:35:48 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @continu_um I agree but, for the same reason you can't impose a monarchy or other system on everyone everywhere, attempts to impose even the most perfect system (if it existed) is also impossible. It also alleviates the burden of trying to perfect a plan before abandoning the current system.
1302874150168657920 2020-09-07 15:39:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @dumcoiner I'm stumped, what can you actually do?
1302873912821379080 2020-09-07 15:38:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @continu_um Not sure, I think we need to start from towns because local residents can directly approve the mass recall. I'm not against economic associations or even going back to states ultimately but, I think it needs to be rebuilt slowly and carefully. For now, keep out-facing military.

Let the only real democratic act of 'voting with your feet' keep the insatiable burgeoning states at bay through population competition/migration.

1302860775841820672 2020-09-07 14:46:29 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Metaphorically, it is as if thanksgiving were interrupted by a 6 year old child threatening to kill the baby with the turkey knife if they didn't get chocolate pudding pie, times 6 billion and spread all over the world.  What do you do with that child? 🤔

1302459978180186112 2020-09-06 12:13:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LiiveOne707 I think the only thing we can really do to start to repair our society is to mass recall all sitting politicians so we can assess the situation. It has to start with local officials in each town by their own residents. From there, ask county and state officials to step down.

1302458733042298880 2020-09-06 12:08:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Bearded_Heretic Yes! That's it. Thanks! I can't believe they seem to have scrubbed every copy on YT. If that doesn't raise any doubts for people, I don't know what will.

1302452667625680899 2020-09-06 11:44:49 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's looking like that video of the WHO spokesperson describing taking children from homes with covid19 has been scrubbed. Does anyone have an offline copy or know of a podcast episode that included it?

I remember when these documents were being revealed and just thought people knowing would put a stop to it. 😒  I'm trying to show someone that video though because they don't believe it. He just flat out says it in the news conference plain as day.
1302447268621103106 2020-09-06 11:23:21 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @NEWDAWN20202 This video is down as well, I'm trying to find a copy of the UN guy (older with an Irish accent) in some news conference explaining that children will be taken from homes with covid. They talked about determining if a house had enough rooms and bathrooms or something as well.
1302442542869381121 2020-09-06 11:04:35 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @exyz_Jeremy ♥️ Yes, Ringworld is awesome!
1302441462102192130 2020-09-06 11:00:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Does anyone have a link to that Irish asshole from the WHO/UN who talks about taking children from homes with covid?

Violence will be very unlikely on all sides and we can begin to figure just how bad this shit really is without living in fear of stormtroopers.
1301558598695350277 2020-09-04 00:32:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel @Chesschick01 I'm actually pretty confident that there is a huge reservoir of enraged people who just don't know what to do.
1301557934267269120 2020-09-04 00:29:27 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel @Chesschick01 I'm pretty sure most people on twitter are not aware of it and twitter is a very small subset of the people who need to know. The challenge is how to get the information out to the people who have no access to uncensored information.
1301557246107824133 2020-09-04 00:26:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel @Chesschick01 Cities are not terribly important to achieve the desired effect. If anything, the problem may be how do we keep everyone in the cities from escaping and becoming a problem for the rest of us.
1301556548779606017 2020-09-04 00:23:57 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel @Chesschick01 I left out cities intentionally since they're really not communities in the same sense as a town is. There's almost no way that any police will know the name of any child in front of them in a city. The idea is that no government can claim consent if all towns are in open revolt.

Rather they are expanding at an increased rate with more and more drastic implications. Even in places where they have supposedly "partially lifted" restrictions, the restrictions remain and are intended to be permanent.
1301544806611648523 2020-09-03 23:37:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @newnameel @Chesschick01 If your town officials are willing to kill thousands of women and children just to hold their position I think we had best know that as soon as possible rather than allow such people to expand and consolidate their power. It'll work, catch is just that every town has to do it.

Hopefully we can identify/capture key criminals but, we must halt totalitarianism first.
1301375308315189249 2020-09-03 12:23:46 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CraigSpotter I began advocating for peaceful town level civil rebellion as the only way out around that time but, have been bound up with necessary efforts to refute the false claims made by officials regarding the scientific justifications (or lack thereof) for the measures introduced.
1301374585917538304 2020-09-03 12:20:54 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CraigSpotter The idea that this was an emergency makeshift is simply not believable. The specific details of all that has happened are well documented and go back much further than this. This has clearly been planned. We still have a chance. Let's not fail to act while we still can.
1301372675781259265 2020-09-03 12:13:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> I could be made to change my mind if a case can be made that we can't trust any military command structures due to infiltration and subversion by enemy forces. My hope is that we can avoid "dropping our shields" as we get through this uncomfortable transition.
1301370809164926977 2020-09-03 12:05:53 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @CraigSpotter Correct.
1301370653069783040 2020-09-03 12:05:16 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Given the volatile nature of the world having been put through the grinder, I am forced to admit that it will take a substantial period of time and expert analysis to  reorganize the military. This is a benefit in the sense that military personnel needn't be afraid of chaos.
1301369837453750273 2020-09-03 12:02:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> The goal is decentralization so starting from the position of 16000+ associated towns we can manage the dismantling or shifting of federal departments and agencies to localized funding and control. This will dramatically reduce the ability for unnecessary expenditures to persist.
1301367614963355648 2020-09-03 11:53:12 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> If we could trust government officials to operate in good faith, we could conduct this mass recall through legislatures and the judiciary but, as it's abundantly clear, that option has been made impossible by the demonstrated willingness to subvert lawful redress by officials.
1301364840091484160 2020-09-03 11:42:10 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @carguy98204 If not that then something else. We have to act as soon as the reality of this fraud is widely appreciated and public opinion is in full swing back to civil society and away from collectivist psychosis.
1301363710968107008 2020-09-03 11:37:41 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Peaceful town level civil rebellion is nothing more than a mass recall of all sitting officials. This will consist of 500-1000 families in each of the 16000+ towns in the US going to their town hall and removing town officials. Then we ask county and state officials to step down.
1301360767233650689 2020-09-03 11:25:59 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> For whatever reason, divine providence or good luck, the would-be masters of the planet have chosen a falsifiable pretext to usher in the new world order. Do not imagine that they will repeat that mistake. They may release a truly deadly pathogen next so time is of the essence.

1301348366404792320 2020-09-03 10:36:43 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @LarkinWilder I have found decentralization to be the only solution to our unworkable situation. It does not require anyone to be amenable to "anarchy" of any flavor. It simply means that our polities should be divided so as to minimize political power to the smallest geographic area possible.
1301347281514434562 2020-09-03 10:32:24 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It should be apparent by now to any law abiding citizen that we are experiencing full-blown tyranny. I can only reach you so it's up to you to pass along this information. It would be tragic if we failed to assert ourselves in the face of this undeniable existential threat.
1301344647982313474 2020-09-03 10:21:56 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> These examples will continue. I see no utility in waiting. As soon as everyone is aware of our predicament, we should conduct a mass recall of all sitting officials. I hope it can be done before or shortly after we lose power and communications. #peacefultownlevelcivilrebellion

1301167813680394240 2020-09-02 22:39:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @doomcultgames @ShonadMcDermott This is for the majority of people who own land or a house and can't escape. It's really a mass recall but, since we have no confidence in officials to cooperate in good faith, an impromptu town meeting. Whatever happens, we can't allow the existing command structure to continue.

Very low efficacy anyway even if they guess seasonal flu strain correctly.

1301158258128887808 2020-09-02 22:01:17 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShonadMcDermott Plus, a leader implies a set course which is guaranteed to divide rather than unite. It needs to be presented without false hope. We do not know where we go from here, just that this cannot be allowed to continue.
1301157707353858051 2020-09-02 21:59:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShonadMcDermott It's a valid criticism. I'm starting from a decentralized perspective so it doesn't seem unnatural to me. Other concerns are problems with assassination, bribery, extortion, hostages or other frauds which are dramatically minimized without leaders.
1301156691036307461 2020-09-02 21:55:04 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShonadMcDermott I think people to whom those questions are still not in doubt simply aren't savable. That doesn't mean they won't join the mass recall necessarily though. Followers will follow so we just have to give them people to follow locally. Otherwise they'll just stay home on liberty day.

1301153294174347266 2020-09-02 21:41:34 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @ShonadMcDermott Ultimately, peaceful town level civil rebellion has to be in every town by locals so as long as we have someone getting the ball rolling in every town, there's a chance. I don't like the idea of a leader though there will have to be some organization in each of the 16000+ towns.

They'll only have a nagging doubt.
1301143849084104704 2020-09-02 21:04:02 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @hellothere3332 I'm concerned about the short term. Assume that someone is only just now beginning to understand what is happening and has no access to unconditioned minds. That sounds terrifying. I think the domesticated can't break free but they're mostly not a threat except as collaborators.
1301141597749477376 2020-09-02 20:55:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @markie123567 That's still helpful but, I'm thinking about the person who has deduced most of this but hasn't been able to discuss it with anyone. I never thought I would be so glad to be on social media, that sounds even worse. I think I'd rather see this much of the shit-show than be alone.
1301140226816049152 2020-09-02 20:49:38 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> We have to start worrying about how to help people come to grips with what they are learning. How can we deprogram people if they're not reachable on social media? I'm thinking flyers and posters just to let people know they're not going crazy or misunderstanding the situation.

When they realize their employer doesn't have their back will be the trigger. Once it's revealed that the company won't or can't protect them, that's when we'll see a major scatter.

It's likely that citizen management will be further centralized and automated. Police will largely be victimized as well so getting through to them would be preferable.

The word itself is really a verb; 'to educate,' not a noun; 'to possess an education.'

1301049545275699200 2020-09-02 14:49:18 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> Corporativism is the alignment of interests between government and a select few authorized entities who are granted special exemption from prosecution and damages for causing harm or death. Monopolies, cartels, and their unions receive direction from the state for all activities.

What I'm saying is that my understanding of satanism is that it is wholly reliant on science which would be a very bad plan if it was fake. The scientific method cuts away the disprovable.
1301037930413256704 2020-09-02 14:03:09 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @STrimaran @o_rips So, I'd say focus on the evil, not the science. A lot of us are with you on fighting evil.

That's where we should be focusing the investigation, not so much on trying to disprove astronomical evidence. I'll put it this way, would that matter if the first thing is true?
1301034396863131649 2020-09-02 13:49:06 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @STrimaran @o_rips This stuff is more convincing from my perspective but, the fact that satanic baby eating monsters want to kill 95% of us wouldn't be any kind of evidence of anything other than evil. It seems entirely irrational to me to conclude that physics itself is false.

The main thing is that expressing ratios is particularly difficult in decimal (base 10.) 2/3, a common ratio, always comes out as the irrational number 6.66666...

1300683283701915648 2020-09-01 14:33:55 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @heathroi @topsafari If you mean they're not "educated" commies, yes. But, I'm seeing plenty of black people among them and they're not all rich kids. As far as I can tell, they're genuine communists in every way that matters.
1300645618839363584 2020-09-01 12:04:15 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Flimsy_AF It's yet another unfalsifiable claim supporting the elimination of individual freedom and vilifying productivity.
1300638471753797632 2020-09-01 11:35:51 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> It's funny that the Kommie-Kidz™ always laugh at memes talking about the staggering death tolls under communism not realizing that it will always be the other communists who will kill them.  https://t.co/mYUhTHf3ez
1300620304004403200 2020-09-01 10:23:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Cosmic_Engineer @1CupNoLiberty The reported explosions in the base and elevator shafts are completely consistent with a controlled collapse. Given they've already been forced to admit demolition on one building, it's obvious they did it to the towers. Case closed imho without having to get too speculative.
1300618224820727808 2020-09-01 10:15:23 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @Cosmic_Engineer @1CupNoLiberty No plane hit building seven and that's enough to confirm the demolition hypothesis. The molten steel and near freefall trajectory also confirm demolition. I don't think it's necessary to address the nature of the vehicles (mil/com) which do appear to have hit in footage I've seen

1300596503501824000 2020-09-01 08:49:05 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> So wait, does this mean egghead is a communist? If not, why would he think they'll listen to him? 🤔
1300595846988402689 2020-09-01 08:46:28 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @OrsonWe35330777 @FatEmperor I did a traditional Irish music show and had it taken off the air by communists. Cultural destruction is at least part of the elimination of pub culture. Containment of dissidents is likely as well.

1300584568857202688 2020-09-01 08:01:39 +0800 <roadtoserfdom3> @anarchypuppyx I don't think it's all that useful to speculate on the nitty-gritty details of the nature of any future governments right now only because I think it reinforces the idea that we have the time to debate minutia. Generalities and principles probably are good to flesh out though.
