1344061058047213574 2020-12-30 07:21:42 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @AaronHJonas @thehill Your insults say more about you than @MichelleObama. I have zero respect for @FLOTUS but I don‚Äôt call her out of her name or joke about her checkered past. Dislike Michelle all you want but insults are childish.

1325457141579325441 2020-11-08 23:16:23 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> Thinking about @realDonaldTrump and #whatIhatethemostaboutTrumpspresidency are all the things he DIDN'T care about: 230K+ #COVID19 deaths, children in cages, denouncing #WhiteSupremacy, people losing their jobs and homes..the list is so long.
1325419830476943360 2020-11-08 20:48:07 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @DonnieWahlberg So sorry to hear that Miss Alma may not be well. Treasure every second with her! Huge fan of @DonnieWahlberg since his episode on ‚ÄúThe Practice‚Äù.  Wishing your family the best.
1325151733631291398 2020-11-08 03:02:48 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @DiamondandSilk @KatieAtnip I was going to ask how the black Trump supporters were doing since their candidate lost but I realized I don't care. Wonder how long it will take for Trump to turn on y'all.
1325150304820727810 2020-11-08 02:57:07 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Yes. Your dad lied, triggered white supremacists, disrespected the military, and put himself first. People are dying from COVID19, losing their jobs, going hungry, and being evicted from their homes. You dad didn't care. Now we have someone who does. #PresidentElectJoe

1325120032565841920 2020-11-08 00:56:49 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @ABC Last week, the elementary kids on my kids' bus were chanting "Trump 2020". Wonder what they'll be saying next week now that #PresidentElectJoe has won and @realDonaldTrump LOST!!!! Think it's going to be really quiet at the bus stop on Monday.  https://t.co/WrM2TiGLE4
1325117259719847936 2020-11-08 00:45:48 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @scientificrealm Not a fan of @VanJones68 but he expressed my pain perfectly. Hard to live in a country where the president approves of systemic racism. So glad this election is over and that @JoeBiden won.
1325115572506550274 2020-11-08 00:39:06 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @realDonaldTrump PRAISE GOD! @realDonaldTrump, may GOD have mercy on your soul. Your callous, heartless disregard for the 230K+ COVID-19 deaths, children in cages, blatant disrespect, LIES, LIES, LIES, failure to denounce white supremacy, narcissism ....the list goes on. Grateful to God you lost!
1324760751467352069 2020-11-07 01:09:10 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @IvankaTrump Votes cast for Joe Biden are not illegal. To some, your father is the worst president ever. He didn't renounce white supremacy, downplayed COVID-19 to the detriment of 230K lives, and doesn't even care about his supporters. That's the short list. Folks want your family GONE!
1324501678201163778 2020-11-06 07:59:42 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @ABC @TheView Do liars and whiners ever get tired of lying and whining?  Asking for a friend. The hypocrisy from the person in the White House and his supporters is so tiring.

It's been proven that outside agitators attached themselves to peaceful #BlackLivesMatter protests to ratchet them up. Keep believing lies if you want. And ANYONE who incites violence, riots, destruction, and domestic terror is wrong REGARDLESS OF COLOR.
1322970206180986881 2020-11-02 02:34:11 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @Falconeddie1 @JoeBiden Not true. NO ONE wants a lockdown.  Or to wear a mask. But we also don‚Äôt want people to continue to die at such a rapid rate. At least @JoeBiden expresses concern for those affected by #COVID19. @realDonaldTrump does not care. His words: #ItIsWhatItIs.
1322718071757393921 2020-11-01 09:52:17 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Trump is a billionaire so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs arranging for a quick resolution of this problem for his devout supporters at this very minute. Oh wait. That‚Äôs right. He doesn‚Äôt care. ü§î
1322290834465763328 2020-10-31 05:34:36 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @wsbtv I don‚Äôt understand. Why is he quarantining? He cared more about Trump‚Äôs directives than the health of Georgians. And sued Keisha Lance-Bottoms for trying to save Atlantans. He should just carry on as he did before.  Hope his wife and family are ok tho.

1321084346380525571 2020-10-27 21:40:27 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @ryanwaddup @anna_orso Willful refusal to see the facts that the young man was in crisis and autistic in order to justify the actions of the cops. People can‚Äôt see the truth in front of them, huh?

White people cuss the police out, lunge at them, get in their faces and still live. Anyone who can‚Äôt acknowledge that needs to take a hard look at their own views on race.

1319454922316959749 2020-10-23 09:45:42 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> Note to America: Trump doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre hungry, near homeless, or have bald tires.  Imagine that. #DebateTonight
1319451911289032706 2020-10-23 09:33:44 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> Trump could actually do a recording and just press play depending on the question. I‚Äôve heard all these answers before.  #DebateTonight

1318925273123983362 2020-10-21 22:41:04 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @icecube The US has made over 500 treaties with the Native Americans and have broken ALL of them!

1315677590821142531 2020-10-12 23:35:56 +0800 <hiswordsbyhim> @HelenKennedy @sarahcpr I completely agree. I would expect her deep religious views to guide her in doing the right thing--both personally and for the U.S.

If so, he still hasn't experienced the worst of it. May God have mercy on his soul.
