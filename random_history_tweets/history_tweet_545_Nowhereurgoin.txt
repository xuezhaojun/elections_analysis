1326589237018419203 2020-11-12 02:14:55 +0800 <Nowhereurgoin> @PhilippeReines Georgia will claim victory after a the hand counting (throwing out of ballots) is done.

1326585079934509056 2020-11-12 01:58:24 +0800 <Nowhereurgoin> @Amy_Siskind I think the margin is too big for hand recount in Georgia, but Brian Kemp is the governor and you know about him. 🙄
1326584191828553729 2020-11-12 01:54:52 +0800 <Nowhereurgoin> @getreal2 @DeanBrowningPA True too. I guess my point is that they only care if the kid is born, but not whether it thrives.

1324723218230452224 2020-11-06 22:40:02 +0800 <Nowhereurgoin> Joe Biden was compared to Mr. Rogers, but that's a compliment and not an insult.  Mr. Rogers was from Pittsburgh in Allegheny county. I think his window still lives there.  It'll probably be the last county to finish the count in PA and Joe will win!
