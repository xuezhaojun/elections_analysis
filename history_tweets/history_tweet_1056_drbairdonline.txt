1310629414850367489 2020-09-29 01:16:17 +0800 <drbairdonline> I should add this Swedish professor is undoubtedly Per Gunnar Berglund who has been promoting the idea that two 3rd-gen 0.3-0.4 kt NPLs (nuclear pumped laser) were used on 9/11, NOT 4th-gen as Pomer reports. 110/  https://t.co/TNY4bhxBKC  https://t.co/HyGM2oFztI
1310629410517610496 2020-09-29 01:16:16 +0800 <drbairdonline> But when the Swedish prof contacted Pommer summer 2017 abt 0.3 kt 4th-gen nuke that "could fire a nuclear plasma jet out of the earth" for several secs (before evaporating), Pommer rejected the idea saying the "main problem" was "the rockbed would not turn hot for so long" 109/  https://t.co/8lXGusn9RS
1310602751294857217 2020-09-28 23:30:20 +0800 <drbairdonline> And if the problem is you need 80-150 kt TNT equiv energy input in the bedrock under each of the three towers or the size &amp; location of "as-if-formerly-molten-rock-formations" (or are they glacier valleys?), how about multiple or larger 3rd-gen RRR nukes? 108/  https://t.co/TdL4H0kOxE
1310602746085568514 2020-09-28 23:30:19 +0800 <drbairdonline> And why try to come up with a way for three 0th-gen nuclear reactor bombs to do all the damage to WTC when multiple 3rd-gen weapons in WTC3, WTC4, WTC5 &amp; WTC6.

1310602742809812992 2020-09-28 23:30:18 +0800 <drbairdonline> If there are observations of EMP in the hour(s) before "collapse" of the towers as Pommer observed in his 2018 London talk, how about a 3rd-gen EMP nuke that Andre Gsponer wrote scientists were working on back in 1982? 106/  https://t.co/kihZvRd4am
1310602735578877953 2020-09-28 23:30:16 +0800 <drbairdonline> But Pommer does not really explain WHY a highly problematic 0th-gen nuclear reactor bomb was necessary. Does he really imagine the perpetrators he calls "killing psychopaths" couldn't have positions an ARRAY of 3rd-gen nukes around the WTC to account for all these phenomena? 105/  https://t.co/xXM0m6WmmS
1310540773637550081 2020-09-28 19:24:03 +0800 <drbairdonline> The actual theory Pommer comes up with to replace his 3rd-gen 10-kt MRR NDEW theory is "a beryllium-polluted lump of weapons-grade uranium" that when activated by external neutron flash will heat &amp; melt causingdenser U-235 to sink &amp; purify, leading to nuclear fizzle. 104/  https://t.co/XodZQc235y
1310539965449695234 2020-09-28 19:20:51 +0800 <drbairdonline> As he tells the story, Pommer found the solution - a 0th-generation (i.e., primitive) nuclear reactor bomb - inspired by learning abt a natural nuclear reactor in Gabun. "The devil's trick" was that the solution wasn't futuristic technology but a design taken from NATURE! 103/  https://t.co/sUSSC2xv2k
1310539956733931521 2020-09-28 19:20:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> Pommer didn't try to find some way to modify his current 3rd-gen theory to fit new data like scientists typically do. No, rather angrily - he didn't like to "waste" his time "thinking how the nuclear device actually worked" - he started from scratch. 102/  https://t.co/7mbiviFwnN  https://t.co/5D0MnmJG4u
1310539950295674880 2020-09-28 19:20:47 +0800 <drbairdonline> Altho Pommer bought Roby's 10^15 J, he had years before rejected the deeply-buried-large-nuke theory (first proposed by Dimitri Khalezov) b/c it would have greatly damaged the "bathtub" wall. So he was left with a conundrum: "Some futuristic design - or old technology?" 101/  https://t.co/CHxz1D1Mur
1310438608650735616 2020-09-28 12:38:05 +0800 <drbairdonline> @djggml Do you have any inside info?
1310437376758439936 2020-09-28 12:33:12 +0800 <drbairdonline> Indeed we need to question Prof Roby abt his own assumptions that his order of magnitude numbers reject every other nuclear 9/11 theory except his own suspect theory that only a 100 kt nuke buried at depth of ~100 m could have caused WTC7 "collapse" 100/  https://t.co/XrWoGsKgZZ
1310437375365926912 2020-09-28 12:33:11 +0800 <drbairdonline> The problem w/order of magnitude calculations is that the people doing them are NOT Enrico Fermi (they stop asking questions!) &amp; can easily come up w/quite different estimates for hot spot area/depth, ŒîT, etc. wch when multiplied together can readily lead to 1.5 kt or 80 kt. 99/  https://t.co/7haeh398fh
1310437371159015426 2020-09-28 12:33:10 +0800 <drbairdonline> To put this amount of energy in perspective, the HEAT released from EACH of the THREE hot spots would be equal to HEAT that would be released from a SOCCER PITCH maintaining 377 C/711 F for 120 days from 9/11 to 1/9/2002!  98/  https://t.co/Fq3ktbSiZ6
1310437364074856448 2020-09-28 12:33:09 +0800 <drbairdonline> Total GZ heat release (per Roby) = Total hot spot area (20,000 m¬≤) x ŒîT avg hot spot &amp; ambient temps on 9/11 (350 K) x avg heat transfer coeff (10 W/m¬≤K) x "characteristic cooling time" (120 days) ~10^15 J ~240 kT TNT equiv 97/  https://t.co/x0oXlXzVSz
1310357007216517122 2020-09-28 07:13:50 +0800 <drbairdonline> Contrary to Pommer, Roby most definitely did NOT use a cooking plate analogue! But his method also raises a lot of questions. To come up with his "order of magnitude calculation" of 10^15 J for "total heat released at GZ", Roby multiplies four roughly estimated numbers. 96/  https://t.co/jAlsZ8Jd8A
1310357003139596288 2020-09-28 07:13:49 +0800 <drbairdonline> Curiously, in explaining how Roby came up w/80 kt per tower, Pommer shows this slide &amp; says Roby used the same cooking plate analogue that Pommer had used the previous year! Did nobody (inc Pommer) question how the same analogue could give 1.5 kt one year &amp; 80 kt the next?! 95/  https://t.co/m2dd5rpIhU
1310335554022588417 2020-09-28 05:48:35 +0800 <drbairdonline> To get a number like 1.5 kT for WTC7, I backcalculated a "similar" cylinder for WTC hot spot w/radius 42.3 m (529x cooking plate radius which seems a bit larger than the radius of the circle on the diagram) &amp; hot spot height 529x cooking plate height. 94/  https://t.co/DARoH8pj3v
1310335550780399616 2020-09-28 05:48:34 +0800 <drbairdonline> However, there are immediate problems with Pommer's calculation when you notice that he has the size of the WTC hot spot at 3,750,000 m¬≤! Did he mean 3,750 m¬≤? Then, in scaling up, he seems to assume the WTC hot spot to be the SAME THICKNESS as a regular cooking plate! 93/  https://t.co/Pg4MTJlvm0
1310335547638870016 2020-09-28 05:48:34 +0800 <drbairdonline> To come up with that 1.5 kt TNT equiv for WTC, Pommer used a "cooking plate" analogue calculating how much energy was used to heat the cooking plate to 300 C and then scaling up to a cooking plate the size of the hot spot where WTC7 used to be &amp; comes up with 1.5 kt TNT eq. 92/  https://t.co/rcDeXPCSws
1310327460903358464 2020-09-28 05:16:26 +0800 <drbairdonline> For one thing, Pommer had NOT been blissfully ignorant of the issue of energy input into the rock. Indeed, in his 2017 London talk, he had presented his own calculations for WTC7 but had come up with only 1.5 kt TNT equiv - much, much lower than Roby's 80 kt per tower! 91/  https://t.co/leOtbS2Q1H
1310327457136799744 2020-09-28 05:16:25 +0800 <drbairdonline> 240 kt TNT equiv would definitely be hard to account for w/Pommer's three 10 kt (max) 3rd-gen RRR NDEWs but before REJECTING the 3rd-gen model completely based on Roby's calculations - as Pommer does - we really should dig more deeply into the whole 9/11 bedrock energy issue. 90/  https://t.co/kL8pb6yKtx
1310327452065964032 2020-09-28 05:16:23 +0800 <drbairdonline> Roby convinced Pommer "The Towers' destruction was a mere SIDE EFFECT of what happened in the rockbed!" b/c 90% energy expended at Ground Zero on 9/11 remained in the rock. Roby had calculated 10^15 J (240 kt TNT equiv) to maintain hot spots for 3 mos! 89/  https://t.co/XTgKFiFanZ  https://t.co/M14AvaqtyZ
1310307364227018752 2020-09-28 03:56:34 +0800 <drbairdonline> The communication that obviously troubled Pommer most was from the French prof who we can easily identify as Fran√ßois Roby, Physics Prof at Univ of Pau, since he later published the exact same analysis that Pommer discusses in 2018 London presentation 88/  https://t.co/nnU0n1kzcm  https://t.co/1ZCL9Sq4QI
1310305517223305217 2020-09-28 03:49:14 +0800 <drbairdonline> As convincing as Pommer had made case for 3rd-gen nukes, only a year later - after two professors (French &amp; Swedish) contacted him summer 2017 - he had completely abandoned 3rd-gen idea as seen in his follow-up talk to London 9/11Keeptalking (May 2018) 87/  https://t.co/j1uAv7ihDM
1310305515193344000 2020-09-28 03:49:13 +0800 <drbairdonline> Thus, after 3 years of testing his model, physicist Heinz Pommer had concluded that 3rd-gen Directed Energy/Minimum Residual Radiation nukes (10 kt max) were ‚Äúthe prime suspect for being used on 9/11‚Äù. In the rest of this thread I will defend that thesis agst its challengers. 86/  https://t.co/miswYF3Wpi

1303791371174649856 2020-09-10 04:24:20 +0800 <drbairdonline> @JeremyRys2 Is that your conclusion after reading the entire 99-tweet thread? If so, then we have very different ideas about what constitutes "scientific evidence"!
1303768020678975489 2020-09-10 02:51:33 +0800 <drbairdonline> Robert McFarlane's attempt to stir up animosity toward Syria &amp; Iran accusing them of killing 241 US military men with "one of the largest non-nuclear explosions known to man" in the end was just #FalseFlag propaganda directing attention away from Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúnuclear terrorism‚Äù 98/  https://t.co/qRgS4vcQab
1303768018808258560 2020-09-10 02:51:33 +0800 <drbairdonline> Begin, terrorist founder of Israel's ruling Likud party (now headed by PM Benjamin Netanyahu) that came to power in Israel in 1977, gloried in calling himself ‚Äúthe father of terrorism in all the world‚Äù!

1303768017185062912 2020-09-10 02:51:32 +0800 <drbairdonline> Menachem Begin - who resigned as Israeli PM two weeks before US Marine barracks bombing &amp; would undoubtedly have had final approval on the operation - was the man who planned the bombing of British HQ in King David Hotel in Jerusalem in July 1946 in which 91 were killed. 96/  https://t.co/ZxaDqjZfJ2

1303768011665362949 2020-09-10 02:51:31 +0800 <drbairdonline> In addition, Reagan in his Dec 27 Q&amp;A enlisted the US in Israel's "war on terrorism", a pledge he repeated in his 1984 State of the Union. Thus, as a direct result of the Oct 23 attack, Israel got practically everything they had wanted from the US! 93/  https://t.co/xomgqKI07T  https://t.co/1F0Oa7Kvix

1303670835530461184 2020-09-09 20:25:22 +0800 <drbairdonline> In addition, Pres Reagan "secretly decided to give the Israelis something they had long wanted: permission to use $60 million of U.S. military sales credits to develop portions of the Lavi fighter plane in the United States" 90/  https://t.co/JT4lgSrLWz
1303670833991229440 2020-09-09 20:25:22 +0800 <drbairdonline> McFarlane et al finally accepted what Israelis long contended that no ME issue can be solved w/o "a solid foundation of trust" btwn Israel &amp; US based on giving Israelis "firmer sense of security" from constant threats &amp; letting Arabs know US top priority was a strong Israel 89/  https://t.co/Trv1Bj5mzp
1303670831399092224 2020-09-09 20:25:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> Bernard Gwertzman @nytimes reported NSDD 111 passed after two weeks of debate within NSC but the US Marine barracks attack "provided the FINAL PUSH"  https://t.co/vZvRMIGzZr  https://t.co/SoVgYM5wHK 88/  https://t.co/Llo0rvYSoK
1303670829838819328 2020-09-09 20:25:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> Oct 29, six days after bombing, Pres Reagan signed highly classified Natl Sec Decision Directive 111 on the Middle East, at request of Sec of State Shultz &amp; Natl Sec Adv McFarlane, calling for "generally closer strategic cooperation w/Israel on Lebanon &amp; elsewhere in the ME" 87/  https://t.co/AKG2SJt4OG
1303670828123394048 2020-09-09 20:25:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> But Oct 25, two days after BLT HQ bombing, McFarlane was reported as suggesting restoring 1981 U.S.-Israeli strategic cooperation agreement (suspended Dec 1981 following Israel‚Äôs annexation of Golan Heights) as part of an overall reassessment of US policy in the Middle East 86/  https://t.co/tzMvl3S5Oq
1303436901232254978 2020-09-09 04:55:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> As ME envoy, McFarlane's attitude was no secret. Daily News reported McFarlane ‚Äúhas privately described Israeli actions over the past 13 months as a ‚Äúlitany of perfidy‚Äù ‚Äì phony pretexts, broken promises, lengthy stalls ‚Äì even unwarranted provocations of US forces in Beirut.‚Äù 85/  https://t.co/8L3wZ7WS2q
1303436899000832000 2020-09-09 04:55:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> There was increasing bad blood btwn Reagan admin &amp; Israel over Israeli opposition to sale of AWACS aircraft to Saudi Arabia, Israeli invasion of Lebanon June 1982 &amp; especially after the Sabra &amp; Shatila massacre which utterly horrified Reagan. ("Oh, my God!")  84/  https://t.co/V6msPrcwkv
1303436897142927360 2020-09-09 04:55:47 +0800 <drbairdonline> I believe Israel's nuclear extortion explains the dramatic pro-Israeli change in US policy after 23 Oct 1983 that Bud McFarlane was at the center of. Tensions began June 1981 when Israel used American F-16s to destroy Iraqi nuclear reactor leading Reagan to suspend F-16 sales 83/  https://t.co/iA2rbvtyvj
1303415899844571136 2020-09-09 03:32:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> Joe Vialls exposed this nuclear extortion racket in reporting on 2002 Bali explosion caused by a Dimona ‚Äústealth‚Äù SADM that killed 202 people, ‚Äúthe ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô meted out to Australians &amp; others opposed to the Judeo-Christian Crusade agst Islam‚Äù 82/  https://t.co/zq3OiiqUo0  https://t.co/cdlJwQnBQr

1303415895922896896 2020-09-09 03:32:20 +0800 <drbairdonline> But as long as people robotically think "NO radioactivity means NO nukes", "clean" SADMs - combined w/Zionist media control that suppresses questioning - gives Israel a free hand to engage in #FalseFlag terrorism &amp; "nuclear extortion" agst state leaders all over the world 80/  https://t.co/XTdNqerKHs
1303303065227812864 2020-09-08 20:03:59 +0800 <drbairdonline> DOD thus might have known or highly suspected that Israel had the capability to pull off the US Marine barrack bombing using an underground "clean" SADM. They also knew Israeli army had been last to occupy the BLT before the Marines arrived in Sep 1982. 79/  https://t.co/MUWRef2pTa
1303303063520727045 2020-09-08 20:03:59 +0800 <drbairdonline> The fact that in all reporting by Vanunu, Hersh, et al, much is written abt Israel's "neutron bomb" but NOTHING on "clean" nukes suggests all part of #LimitedHangout. If Israelis were able to develop a neutron bomb, they certainly could &amp; would have developed a "clean" SADM. 78/  https://t.co/qiIr4Zf9Jp
1303303061012586497 2020-09-08 20:03:58 +0800 <drbairdonline> If Israel didn't develop "clean" SADMs jointly w/US, IDF would certainly have wanted to get their hands on them b/c a major limiting factor in using tactical nukes is always radioactive fallout on your own armies &amp; civilians while others probably saw "terrorist" potential 77/  https://t.co/118bFm1RX4
1303275873483644928 2020-09-08 18:15:56 +0800 <drbairdonline> Aussie online investigator Joe Vialls reported in 2002 that it wasn't just the US. By 1981 Israel &amp; US together had successfully developed at Dimona a "clean" SADM that could be used in "stealth" mode "invisible" to a standard Geiger counter. 76/  https://t.co/zq3OiiqUo0  https://t.co/WTZR8YZa5R
1303275871759773697 2020-09-08 18:15:56 +0800 <drbairdonline> However, if no radioactivity was detected, we have to suspect the perpetrators were using "Minimum Residual Radiation" SADMs which the New York Times reported in 1985 had been successfully developed at LLNL in the 1970s. 75/  https://t.co/4SFDCLfQme
1303272305427013633 2020-09-08 18:01:45 +0800 <drbairdonline> One telltale SADM sign should have been residual radiation it would have left in the crater &amp; fallout area which was an integral part of their design. Indeed Joe Vialls says the photo shows what looks like Geiger counters being used at the blast site. 74/  https://t.co/cz6NUsY08v  https://t.co/o1v3pNtk4m
1303154875891474440 2020-09-08 10:15:08 +0800 <drbairdonline> @abadfamily @nadimtarhini I'll get more into the issues (I think) you are raising later in this thread but I've posted three long threads recently that might answer your questions.  https://t.co/EYOzK3jZXC  https://t.co/LZYF2bhFRH  https://t.co/BvpiomFs3O
1303119383414235136 2020-09-08 07:54:06 +0800 <drbairdonline> @jtrathgeber I'll touch on this as I wrap up the thread, likely by tomorrow.
1303118994535145472 2020-09-08 07:52:33 +0800 <drbairdonline> @harveydarin26 As I'll conclude, I second Joe Vialls that this is an Israeli "clean" micronuke but I don't know enough about how Israel works to know whether this was a Mossad operation.
1303110613686652929 2020-09-08 07:19:15 +0800 <drbairdonline> Also indicative of a nuclear (in contrast to a conventional) explosive, as Capt. Chris Cowdrey put it, "Some things simply vaporized." The official history reported "Some [bodies] were never recovered." Many Marines were caught inside the BLT were "burned beyond recognition.‚Äù 73/  https://t.co/NU5c8h6hGQ
1303100847291686913 2020-09-08 06:40:27 +0800 <drbairdonline> Besides the evidence of the tremendous blast, there was other evidence that would have helped to confirm the device was a SADM. Many Marines &amp; others in Beirut on 23 Oct 1983 distinctly recall seeing what they themselves called a "mushroom cloud" over Beirut 72/  https://t.co/Xxs8uH2WvV
1303075616867065856 2020-09-08 05:00:11 +0800 <drbairdonline> I'm certain Robert McFarlane &amp; many others in DOD knew the 1983 Beirut blast HAD to have been a shallowly buried SADM. Indeed the DOD was quite familiar with burying SADMs as part of the "Zebra Package" &amp; many were already buried near/under Korean DMZ. 71/  https://t.co/piiTh0GMsm
1303071696392314880 2020-09-08 04:44:36 +0800 <drbairdonline> If the explosive device was half buried (HOB = 0 ft), it would require only 60 tons TNT equiv. And if it was shallowly buried (DOB = 2 ft), only about 10 tons TNT equiv, the yield of the smallest ever nuke in US arsenal, the Special Atomic Demolition Munition (SADM). 70/  https://t.co/yWqOR1Sech
1303068976746909696 2020-09-08 04:33:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> So how powerful a "truck bomb" would be needed to blast the FBI 8' 8" deep crater? Even if we use smaller Mercedes L 406 (bed ht ~3 ft) &amp; assumed explosive device only 4 ft in ht placed on the bed (thus HOB = 5 ft), using Fig 4.3 would still require a yield of 750 tons TNT equiv!  https://t.co/R2WArLNG20
1303068975442456576 2020-09-08 04:33:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> US Army Engineers long ago compiled depth results of cratering tests in desert alluvium &amp; similar media in this declassified Figure 4.3 so that, knowing the apparent depth of the crater &amp; Height/Depth of Burst, you can calculate the explosive yield 68/  https://t.co/K5lSlh1x9Z  https://t.co/JfK8Hw19yi
1303045325695844352 2020-09-08 02:59:49 +0800 <drbairdonline> US Special Forces loaded these two light trucks with 1,000 lb ANFO each &amp; then filmed detonation w/high-speed cameras showing a clear air gap between vehicle chassis &amp; the road in both cases (Courtesy of Joe Vialls) 67/  https://t.co/0QimK4su90  https://t.co/QjURquxec5
1303045324139708417 2020-09-08 02:59:49 +0800 <drbairdonline> USAF in Vietnam used 10,000 lb M121 &amp; 15,000 lb BLU-82 to clear landing pads for helicopters in dense jungle used ‚ÄúDaisy Cutter‚Äù fuses so the bomb would detonate 3 feet above the ground to make sure the bomb left NO crater 66/  https://t.co/bxu2RqgNXR
1303045322491355136 2020-09-08 02:59:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> Furthermore any DOD explosives expert would know that there is no way a "truck bomb" whether 2,000 lbs or "gas-enhanced" 12,000 lbs TNT equiv could blast a crater whether the original est of 20-40 feet deep or the FBI's 8' 8" deep 65/  https://t.co/6zr9JhFyRv
1303045319681175553 2020-09-08 02:59:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> Just looking at the damage to the Marine compound anybody who knew any DOD explosives expert would know there was no way Syria and/or Iran could put enough high explosives - ‚Äúgas-enhanced‚Äù or otherwise ‚Äì into a Mercedes pickup truck to pull that off 64/  https://t.co/4hTexmH71i
1303032626232598533 2020-09-08 02:09:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> @BonkersArchie Agreed. And I think the perps sometimes actually flaunting in your face just to show you that you are powerless to do anything about them!
1303032175994875904 2020-09-08 02:07:34 +0800 <drbairdonline> @joser202 Agreed. But I wouldn't be surprised if Najah Wakim believes that ammonium nitrate was the cause of the blast and he is only arguing over "who" caused it to explode. I looked over his recent tweets (in Arabic) &amp; he speaks about "ammonia" &amp; "bombing", e.g.,  https://t.co/e5ktVvNilT
1303028514992529409 2020-09-08 01:53:01 +0800 <drbairdonline> @BonkersArchie The "we're not there to protect Americans" line come from Israeli Victor Ostrovsky whom I consider to be a #LimitedHangout, meaning he might provide some useful info but his key role is to distract you from the real "truth" so I don't really trust anything he says.
1303026408277422081 2020-09-08 01:44:39 +0800 <drbairdonline> @SlowGoncalves Most of my conclusions are based on cratering analysis that employ cube root (or similar) scaling so correlations work equally well for either high explosives (HE) or nuclear explosives (NE). Given crater depth &amp; HOB/DOB, I can calculate yield &amp; determine whether it's HE or NE.  https://t.co/1U53UNk8Tv

1302982737704353792 2020-09-07 22:51:07 +0800 <drbairdonline> Najah Wakim, People's Movement president, told al-Mayadeen "Beirut‚Äôs port was blown up by American &amp; Israeli spy services‚Äù &amp; FBI, "the US‚Äôs criminal investigation organization," trying to hide the truth just like they did w/PM Rafiq Hariri's assassination  https://t.co/vHaWutn0zn

1302974755276861440 2020-09-07 22:19:24 +0800 <drbairdonline> But I want to speculate that SOME lied because they knew the ‚Äútruth‚Äù abt what happened on 23 October 1983, that what destroyed the BLT was NOT ‚Äúthe largest non-nuclear explosion ever‚Äù but was actually a small MINI-NUKE. And it wasn‚Äôt Syria &amp; Iran behind it but rather ISRAEL. 62/  https://t.co/cnnTCiBYy0
1302966714439667712 2020-09-07 21:47:27 +0800 <drbairdonline> Some might have thought US really needed to join Israel's ‚Äúwar on terrorism‚Äù and, even if Syria &amp; Iran weren't directly involved in BLT blast, both were "terrorist states" engaging in "state-sponsored terrorism". The Iran hostage crisis was still fresh in US minds in 1983. 61/  https://t.co/KE0d0GX5Wt
1302963098001666048 2020-09-07 21:33:05 +0800 <drbairdonline> Some may been trying to protect the Marines from blame  by making the bomb so monstrously big that it would have done the same kind of damage to BLT Headquarters in Beirut even if the truck had not penetrated the Marine compound. 60/  https://t.co/TlsrL7A27p
1302963096080637952 2020-09-07 21:33:04 +0800 <drbairdonline> Undoubtedly different things motivated the individuals who consciously or unconsciously contributed to creating &amp; maintaining the "the largest non-nuclear explosion ever" myth.

1302954687319031808 2020-09-07 20:59:39 +0800 <drbairdonline> Making the bomb ever bigger &amp; more elaborate seemed designed to push the narrative away from the original simple suicide truck bomber story to "state-sponsored terrorism" b/c who else but a "terrorist state" could have developed such a monstrous "non-nuclear" weapon 57/  https://t.co/EleEyfnL3J
1302954685737754625 2020-09-07 20:59:39 +0800 <drbairdonline> The 1983 Beirut "myth" was built upon a framework of outrageous claims going back to the Marines' crankshaft photo, Gen Kelley‚Äôs manipulations, the FBI non-investigation &amp; House Subcmte/Long Commission reports before the ‚Äúsenior WH official‚Äù had chance to put last spin on it 56/  https://t.co/ecmam7VCBI

1302911451183509504 2020-09-07 18:07:51 +0800 <drbairdonline> This "senior WH official" used Pres Reagan's wording from Dec 27 Q&amp;A abt evidence possibly not holding up in a court of law, but Reagan was referring to "state-sponsored terrorism" in general &amp; did not suggest who was responsible for BLT explosion 54/   https://t.co/M04GxdQUZt  https://t.co/M7RqGozsUO

But I can't imagine there are too many terrorists that could get their hands on the kind of Israeli ‚Äúclean‚Äù micro-nuke that Joe Vialls ID'ed in 2002. Any ideas?  https://t.co/WQePQQFVlh

1302284759846985728 2020-09-06 00:37:36 +0800 <drbairdonline> @whiskeypapa8 @apgnan01 @relay_data The terrorists who wanted the Marines out of Lebanon!
1302283664026288128 2020-09-06 00:33:15 +0800 <drbairdonline> Here's a fascinating video from Aug 9 of Beirut's Ground Zero showing how truly big the sea-filled crater was. You can also see divers &amp; rafts that I think may be the "French experts" who actually measured the 43-m crater depth that was also reported Aug 9  https://t.co/RsvKLz7R4P
1302276395351994368 2020-09-06 00:04:22 +0800 <drbairdonline> @apgnan01 @relay_data I think that would be a fair reading of the evidence, only adding that the terrorists also wanted the Marines out of Lebanon and they got that as well.
1302252402095972352 2020-09-05 22:29:01 +0800 <drbairdonline> @Samwil226hotma1 I estimate the 1983 Beirut bomb was a shallowly buried 10-20 ton nuke whereas the 2020 Beirut bomb was a deeply buried 5+ kiloton nuke and I even suggest it could easily have been a Hiroshima-size 15 kiloton nuke - or even greater!
1302244227397464064 2020-09-05 21:56:32 +0800 <drbairdonline> @FecundStench I can't say that for sure. The nukes I've studied seem to have been "clean" Atomic Demolition Munitions (ADMs) buried underground. But I'm not at all sure how the nuke that caused the 2015 blast outside Sana'a in Yemen was delivered.  https://t.co/pjzMwfQrcN
1302242381715054592 2020-09-05 21:49:12 +0800 <drbairdonline> @FecundStench Hmmm. I think the US &amp; Israel still have plenty of "normal" nukes they can use if they want to so I wouldn't stop worrying about radiation just yet!
1302241755140505600 2020-09-05 21:46:43 +0800 <drbairdonline> @BurtReynolds0 @relay_data I think I'm supposed to move up to being ridiculed before they take me out. So far they're just ignoring me!  https://t.co/7gdAtnT7Zh

1302236596918337536 2020-09-05 21:26:13 +0800 <drbairdonline> DOD rpt concludes BLT bombing was ‚Äúa terrorist act sponsored by sovereign states [hinting Syria &amp; Iran] or organized political entities for the purpose of defeating US objectives in Lebanon‚Äù &amp; ‚Äústate sponsored terrorism is an important part of the spectrum of warfare‚Äù 47/  https://t.co/hFgxnPKIvj
1302231763775676416 2020-09-05 21:07:01 +0800 <drbairdonline> Interestingly the DOD rpt states that the last people to occupy the BLT before the Marines moved in Sept 1982 was actually the ISRAELI ARMY who used the building as a field hospital during their June 1982 invasion of Lebanon! 46/  https://t.co/uF6UvTcydn
1302229498708934656 2020-09-05 20:58:01 +0800 <drbairdonline> Is anyone else having the same problems that @relay_data is having with Twitter about liking or retweeting my thread on the 1983 bombing of the US Marine barracks in Beirut?  https://t.co/CJhZu5rmRs
1302224652207439874 2020-09-05 20:38:45 +0800 <drbairdonline> DOD rpt gives more precise details on the "oblong crater measuring 39' by 29' 6" and 8' 8" in depth" w/pure BS abt "tamping effect" of BLT ‚Äì which was WIDE OPEN from top to bottom ‚Äì due to ‚Äúthe confinement of the explosive force" &amp; "resultant convergence of force vectors‚Äù! 45/  https://t.co/Fi4nLxzUfc
1302224650101874688 2020-09-05 20:38:45 +0800 <drbairdonline> DOD rpt also leaves ludicrous impression that 12,000-lb TNT equiv bomb would have had similar devastating impact even if it had detonated 330 ft from BLT! One wonders if the Long Comm was pushing a bigger bomb simply to exonerate the Marines from any blame for what happened! 44/  https://t.co/LSFqwOgw4z
1302217264909832192 2020-09-05 20:09:24 +0800 <drbairdonline> Later DOD rpt even asserts ‚ÄúThe FBI Forensic Laboratory described the bomb as the largest conventional blast ever seen by the explosive experts community‚Äù! Utterly NONSENSICAL b/c ‚Äúexplosive experts‚Äù had ‚Äúseen‚Äù MANY ‚Äúconventional‚Äù blasts MUCH larger than 6 tons TNT equiv! 43/  https://t.co/Dax5OrnNs6
1302212380219244547 2020-09-05 19:50:00 +0800 <drbairdonline> DOD rpt also has STRANGE statements like "FBI forensic experts have stated that it was the largest non-nuclear blast that they have ever examined." Strange b/c I doubt seriously FBI had ever "examined" a NUCLEAR blast &amp; I suspect precious few ‚Äúnon-nuclear‚Äù blasts! 42/  https://t.co/5frOiTbuxq
1302210500307034112 2020-09-05 19:42:31 +0800 <drbairdonline> But DOD rpt added some new details, e.g., there was an FBI report on Apr 1983 US Embassy bombing that had concluded BEFORE Oct 1983 BLT blast that "explosive-activated bottle bombs" were used (but Marines never informed!) &amp; added new details on "the gas-enhancement process" 41/  https://t.co/2C8frWmWSz
1302210499040260096 2020-09-05 19:42:31 +0800 <drbairdonline> DOD rpt finished Dec 20 (just a day after House Subcmte rpt but not made public until Dec 29) accepts yellow Mercedes Benz stakebed truck but reports FBI assessment of possibly much bigger ‚Äúgas-enhanced‚Äù bomb now est OVER 12,000 lbs &amp; ‚Äúperhaps six to NINE times" Embassy bomb  40/  https://t.co/jn4eT6XRzP
1302199581657063424 2020-09-05 18:59:08 +0800 <drbairdonline> @lordycults I'd bet the perpetrators would have had access to something like this portable Chinese rig that can drill a hole 80-110 mm in diameter and 20 m deep.  https://t.co/g7fkCBNtJJ  https://t.co/YWEFhVr8oI
1302195980016652289 2020-09-05 18:44:49 +0800 <drbairdonline> At same time as House Subcmte, the five-member "Long Commission" (after its chair Adm Robert Long but officially The DOD Commission on Beirut International Airport (BIA) Terrorist Act of 23 October 1983) appointed by Def Sec Casper Weinberger also investigating BLT bombing 39/  https://t.co/EHVHqbrWPN
1302171176785985536 2020-09-05 17:06:16 +0800 <drbairdonline> Indeed an earlier House delegation that had visited Beirut Oct 28-30 (AFTER Gen Kelley's visit to Beirut but BEFORE he had reported the 5-ton truck to the Senate) had already concluded in its report "a Mercedes truck, approximately 5 tons in size" 38/  https://t.co/JcDrbv71d4
1302171174839840768 2020-09-05 17:06:15 +0800 <drbairdonline> I believe the five Marine eyewitnesses were being pressured to support Gen. Kelley's 5-ton truck assertion. It is curious the House Subcmte sharply criticized Gen Kelley's Senate testimony saying he NEVER spoke to the eyewitnesses, but they do not criticize his 5-ton truck. 37/  https://t.co/HEqe5C9nqX

1302024900958273536 2020-09-05 07:25:01 +0800 <drbairdonline> @collins_daman @FecundStench I have lots of quotes from people who were in Beirut in 1983 who distinctly recall seeing what they themselves called a "mushroom cloud". (I'll be discussing this later in the thread.) As for radiation, I believe the device was an underground 10-20 ton "clean" micro-nuke.  https://t.co/dihHIpcO6O

That's why I was so shocked that NONE of them saw what I saw in Beirut so I had to go it alone! I'll have a new #911Truth thread starting next Friday.
1302010311436677120 2020-09-05 06:27:03 +0800 <drbairdonline> @DJThermalD I'm pretty sure at this point that the 1983 nuking of the US Marine barracks in Beirut was an Israeli #MIHOP rather than #LimitedHangout Victor Ostrovsky's #LIHOP
1302008240985735168 2020-09-05 06:18:49 +0800 <drbairdonline> @Tastybeverage7u I'd be interested in turning these threads into videos but I'd prefer to work with someone who could handle the technical end so I could focus on content. I have LOTS of ideas! Any volunteers?

1302002250970259457 2020-09-05 05:55:01 +0800 <drbairdonline> However, this consensus represents a quite different truck than news accts originally reported. No one earlier mentioned a stakebed let alone described it as yellow. The truck had never been described as "big" 5-ton, rather witnesses said 2 1/2-ton more like a Mercedes L 406. 36/  https://t.co/4larbCKPdc
1302002248512307200 2020-09-05 05:55:00 +0800 <drbairdonline> The witnesses agreed it was a Mercedes truck with a yellow stakebed. Two also said it look like a "six-by"(US military 6x6 medium-duty truck) (right). One mentioned "a gray, pugnose cab". That description seems to fit pretty closely the Mercedes 5-ton L 911 B (left). 35/  https://t.co/DqTpoQ7PbX
1302002246360670212 2020-09-05 05:55:00 +0800 <drbairdonline> As for the ‚Äútruck‚Äù part of the ‚Äútruck bomb‚Äù, since FBI clueless, House subcmte delegation traveled to Beirut to interview the five eyewitnesses. Amazingly from the rather disparate views right after blast, two weeks later all witnesses had achieved a remarkable consensus! 34/  https://t.co/PUd8RTmX3B
1301985844639670273 2020-09-05 04:49:49 +0800 <drbairdonline> As for FBI "hair expert" John W. Hicks, he's the one who demoted Dr Whitehurst to "trainee paint analyst" &amp; then came under the gun himself when DNA tests proved many innocent people had been sent to prison based on his "junk hair science" 33/  https://t.co/NMnHhxjZJx  https://t.co/9ztfqLIttv
1301980292161220608 2020-09-05 04:27:45 +0800 <drbairdonline> But we should probably take whatever FBI crime lab said abt BLT bombing w/grain of salt. This is the same FBI crime lab that a REAL ‚Äúexplosives expert‚Äù - Dr. Frederic Whitehurst - accused of falsifying evidence from many cases inc 1993 WTC &amp; 1995 OKC!  https://t.co/lI6oA8H2ba 32/  https://t.co/8lwdFHriIh
1301980289770479616 2020-09-05 04:27:45 +0800 <drbairdonline> Altho there's NO WAY placing gas cylinders inside/outside explosives will do more than create shrapnel (which FBI also didn't find in Beirut!), nevertheless here's origins of the "gas-enhanced" non-nuclear "superbomb" idea that will by end of 1983 make BLT blast LARGEST ever! 31/  https://t.co/sJv5DCWxU8
1301954909277958146 2020-09-05 02:46:54 +0800 <drbairdonline> No subcmte member seemed to ask Hicks, "Well how abt 12000 lbs of TNT in the back of a 6-ton truck?" That much TNT would almost fit into this 5-ft mini-container. After all Gen. Kelley/DIA thought a "simple explosion" of only 5000 lbs explosives would have destroyed the BLT. 30/  https://t.co/2ZpzlNZHAl
1301954907096801280 2020-09-05 02:46:53 +0800 <drbairdonline> As for how FBI came up w/such a "massive" truck bomb, the "hair expert" doesn't say but offers cryptically that a "simple explosion" from "an ordinary car bomb" could NOT have brought the BLT (w/its weight borne by reinforced-concrete pillars) crashing down. 29/  https://t.co/ISdfda20qy
1301924548359536642 2020-09-05 00:46:15 +0800 <drbairdonline> @borisyeltzin I believe there is quite likely residual radiation that COULD be detected at Ground Zero ("unfortunately" under the sea in case of 2020 Beirut) but these nuclear terrorists long ago figured out how to get practically everyone to robotically reject ANY evidence as "proof" of nukes
1301920435819261955 2020-09-05 00:29:55 +0800 <drbairdonline> @erwinsudarman Yes, "nuke bombing" BUT specifically an UNDERGROUND nuke (i.e., a nuke buried a certain distance below the surface of the earth) like "c." or "d." that blasts a sizeable crater  https://t.co/Kyh7I8mIB7
1301919211036368903 2020-09-05 00:25:03 +0800 <drbairdonline> @Fliggsy The crater depth of 43 m (141 ft) is totally accepted by #MSM - hell it's even on Wikipedia! - and I say if you can use MSM to refute MSM then go for it!  https://t.co/9LGeKNy7l0

1301917071614173184 2020-09-05 00:16:32 +0800 <drbairdonline> Hicks added "the device is believed to have been comprised of explosives placed around cylinders of gas." As to what that does - besides blowing up the cylinders - the "hair expert" explained "the gas-enhanced explosion had the effect of increasing the destructive power" 28/  https://t.co/vjTiHbxm7S
1301917069995159554 2020-09-05 00:16:32 +0800 <drbairdonline> House subcommittee didn't interview the so-called "FBI explosive experts" who went to Beirut but heard from Hicks they conservatively estimated the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of the device in the truck at 12,000-lb TNT equiv, "six times" that of US embassy "car bomb" 27/  https://t.co/fJA341CXTZ  https://t.co/Bxxl5uvHrH
1301917067818401794 2020-09-05 00:16:32 +0800 <drbairdonline> 8-9 Dec 1983 John W. Hicks from FBI Crime Lab, an "expert" in HAIR ANALYSIS(!) was only person from FBI to go before Investigations Subcmte of House Armed Services Cmte.

1301874304146001921 2020-09-04 21:26:36 +0800 <drbairdonline> ONE MONTH after the August 4 blast and NO ONE has seriously challenged my analysis that concludes ONLY a 5+ kT Minimum Residual Radiation ("clean") nuke could have blasted the 43-m (141-ft) deep Beirut crater &amp; left no detectable radioactive fallout  https://t.co/8jIhnXXzrP
1301871303540928515 2020-09-04 21:14:41 +0800 <drbairdonline> @yeahkook @Mr_Communicator I addressed the question of "Where's the radioactivity?" and why I believe a modern Minimum Residual Radiation (i.e., "clean") nuke was used in Beirut pretty thoroughly in tweets #17 thru #40 of this long thread from August 9.  https://t.co/EYOzK3jZXC
1301663089989804032 2020-09-04 07:27:19 +0800 <drbairdonline> The FBI techs further "BELIEVE the bomb was carried in a dump truck". Amazingly &amp; w/o precedent the FBI NEVER reported any more precise vehicle ID for the BLT "truck bomb"! What about all the blast site debris they brought back to DC for analysis? What about that CRANKSHAFT?! 25/  https://t.co/lU4lYrtzD0
1301658542961602560 2020-09-04 07:09:14 +0800 <drbairdonline> The FBI techs measured the "bomb" blew "a rectangular hole in the ground measuring 39 ft by 29 ft &amp; drove a 7-in-thick reinforced concrete deck eight ft into the ground." Unfortunately the only photo of entire crater they provided looks more like bad "xerox art" than crater! 24/  https://t.co/DTmmn5wtcv
1301658541338443777 2020-09-04 07:09:14 +0800 <drbairdonline> But Gen Kelley/DIA's 5,000 lbs explosives would not stand long b/c even as he spoke "two FBI lab technicians" were over in Beirut &amp; they would come up w/even greater explosive yield of 12,000 lbs TNT equiv, although as of Nov 10 they still hadn't determined actual explosive 23/  https://t.co/VUcRYe3tAl

Kelley reported to Senate Armed Services Comm that actually "a five-ton Mercedes truck" (size of "a large dump truck") that drove into BLT lobby &amp; Defense Intelligence Agency estimated it carried 5,000 lbs explosives, NOT 2,000 lbs 22/  https://t.co/SHoZUduVrR
1301572868438814720 2020-09-04 01:28:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> If everybody originally thought the BLT explosion comparable to the embassy blast, it didn't take long for others to conclude the BLT blast had to have been much, much bigger, beginning with Gen. Paul X. Kelley, Commandant of the Marine Corps (pictured here on the left) 21/  https://t.co/2470Y0cAQQ
1301572866970775553 2020-09-04 01:28:48 +0800 <drbairdonline> US State Dept promptly ignored ITN report &amp; the 2,000-lb suicide truck bomb that destroyed the US Embassy in Beirut on 18 Apr 1983 became set in stone, a benchmark by which the later US Marine barracks bombing six months later on 23 Oct 1983 would be measured 20/  https://t.co/c4KEOzwMoq
1301562343176896512 2020-09-04 00:46:59 +0800 <drbairdonline> Late July 1983 British ITN aired a report that claimed State Dept "truck bomb" theory was incorrect, US embassy bombing was "inside job" carried out by 16 Islamic extremists employed in the bldg who placed 300-400 lbs of explosives near the staff cafeteria in the embassy 19/  https://t.co/hCm2kyJv2b
1301559095002972161 2020-09-04 00:34:04 +0800 <drbairdonline> State Dept officials must have decided they didn't like where that was going b/c that's the last you hear about the Lebanese police investigation! Late June 1983 they told House panel the explosion was "set off by the kamikaze attack of a pickup, loaded with one ton of TNT" 18/  https://t.co/dBAsFZAPvm
1301554134210850817 2020-09-04 00:14:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> By early May 1983, An-Nahar newspaper reported Lebanese police, after rounding up nearly 100 people for questioning, had abandoned "truck bomb" theory for new theory that the blast was from 440 pounds of explosives hidden in the embassy's canned food consignment 17/  https://t.co/iVP721XHyq
1301547013939503104 2020-09-03 23:46:04 +0800 <drbairdonline> Initial reports on US embassy blast from both Lebanese police &amp; State Dept claimed a vehicle packed w/explosives had driven up to front of embassy where it exploded but lot of contradictory reports on kind of vehicle, most saying it was a car but this AP rpt says GMC pickup 16/  https://t.co/oo6syDPBJI
1301533870756560896 2020-09-03 22:53:50 +0800 <drbairdonline> 18 Apr 1983 Beirut US Embassy blast killed 63 people (incl 17 Americans) w/reports of ‚Äúa flash &amp; fireball‚Äù shooting up into the sky, shock waves breaking windows a mile away, cars blown apart &amp; on fire, melted traffic light, bodies blown out into sea  https://t.co/1w4OM4s0fJ 15/
1301533869057798144 2020-09-03 22:53:50 +0800 <drbairdonline> One possibility is that Maj. Jordan et al were all assuming the BLT ‚Äútruck bomb‚Äù would be similar to the ‚Äútruck bomb‚Äù that the US State Dept had officially concluded had detonated 2,000 lbs of explosives to blow the front off of the US Embassy in Beirut six months earlier 14/  https://t.co/BwHAslMXpv
1301530327031005184 2020-09-03 22:39:45 +0800 <drbairdonline> One wonders how Maj. Jordan &amp; Friedman's informants -while the smoke was literally still clearing - could come up with a meager 2,000+ pounds of TNT for what would, by the end of 1983, be transformed into ‚Äúthe largest non-nuclear explosion ever"? 13/  https://t.co/klP8xbm85R
1301290629197037568 2020-09-03 06:47:17 +0800 <drbairdonline> If 15-year, $1 billion FARCE of investigation into 2005 #BeirutBlast that killed former PM Rafic Hariri &amp; destroyed much of downtown Beirut is anything to go on, I doubt either #truth or #justice will ever come out of any investigation of 2020 explosion  https://t.co/LZYF2bhFRH  https://t.co/idf6oN3Lna
1301281927563898880 2020-09-03 06:12:42 +0800 <drbairdonline> The only reporter who offered an independent estimate of the bomb's yield was Thomas Friedman @nytimes who reported "about 2,500 pounds of TNT" ("a Pentagon spokesman") &amp; "roughly 2,600 pounds of TNT" (Yousef Bitar, Lebanese Army explosives expert) 12/  https://t.co/Bqe2oHPsY3
1301277892551168000 2020-09-03 05:56:40 +0800 <drbairdonline> @B1essedMess @timourazhari 2020 long ago topped 2001 for total weirdness and we're only 2/3 through the year!
1301277356791754752 2020-09-03 05:54:33 +0800 <drbairdonline> @Mike38959003 I was suspicious of videos like this when they started spreading on social media. I was waiting for more info which never came &amp; interest died down. However, in case people were using this to claim the Beirut explosion was an FAE, I posted this thread.  https://t.co/mYjMXcxLmN
1301273904137170945 2020-09-03 05:40:49 +0800 <drbairdonline> One thing that practically all early reporting on 1983 Beirut blast agreed on, echoing words of Marine spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan, was that the explosion was caused by detonation of "2,000 pounds"/"a ton" of "explosives"/"high explosives"/"TNT" 11/  https://t.co/i6v21YTrvw
1301264528399712256 2020-09-03 05:03:34 +0800 <drbairdonline> Does the UN want to "disappear" the evidence of the crime in Beirut just like Rudy Giuliani et al "disappeared" the evidence of the 9/11 crime?  https://t.co/8nksYC5VSD  https://t.co/TeMlySmNSa
1301259838224121856 2020-09-03 04:44:56 +0800 <drbairdonline> @wakeupworld15 @MDB501 Yes, it's the kind of person who believes whatever #MSM reports even if it would, under normal circumstances, seem physically impossible.
1301259076584710144 2020-09-03 04:41:54 +0800 <drbairdonline> @TheArcaneGolem Yes, and it's interesting kind of "terrorists" who use nukes but don't want you to know they use nukes. What kind of terrorist is that?!
1301258374034595840 2020-09-03 04:39:07 +0800 <drbairdonline> @FecundStench I don't know where you got that I said US had Reduced Residual Radiation weapons in 1952. I clearly said the 1970s according to the #NYTimes.  https://t.co/yJEWbRzkTE
1301257667264954368 2020-09-03 04:36:18 +0800 <drbairdonline> @ScottDBlalock1 I'll be getting around to Victor Ostrovsky as well as Ronen Bergman &amp; Christopher Bollyn later in this thread.  https://t.co/hrwkIKAcpK
1301252325969784833 2020-09-03 04:15:05 +0800 <drbairdonline> As to color, there was no agreement. The truck was initially reported alternately as "red" or "blue" or "yellow".  A week later Marine spokesman Maj. Robert Jordan said it was a ‚Äúgrayish, tan, light-yellow vehicle‚Äù like those delivering fresh fruits &amp; vegetables to markets. 10/  https://t.co/Pvdz3pPU6m
1301252324266897408 2020-09-03 04:15:04 +0800 <drbairdonline> As to what the five had actually seen - wch the media often picked up 2nd or 3rd hand - there was initially no consensus. All agreed it was a "truck" but some accts added "pickup truck" or ‚ÄúMercedes truck‚Äù or ‚Äú2 ¬Ω ton truck‚Äù or, simply, ‚Äútruck bomb‚Äù. 9/  https://t.co/clHcpAQnFi
1301252322215956480 2020-09-03 04:15:04 +0800 <drbairdonline> The evidence that it was a "truck bomb" that blasted the BLT comes down to five Marine eyewitnesses who reported that abt 6:21 am they had seen a vehicle drive through the Marine compound &amp; into the BLT lobby, followed almost immediately by a huge explosion. 8/  https://t.co/l1mupN7xxQ
1301233123166842880 2020-09-03 02:58:46 +0800 <drbairdonline> It's funny but I can't find anybody commenting at the time or later that high explosives CANNOT completely "disappear" a truck leaving ONLY the CRANKSHAFT! Both 1995 OKC (L) &amp; 1996 Khobar Towers (R) bombings left crankshafts but also 100s if not 1000s of other truck pieces!  7/  https://t.co/FfYy2rpb3S
1301211560698941443 2020-09-03 01:33:06 +0800 <drbairdonline> The USMC photo of the Marines looking at the crankshaft in the crater is undated, but we can probably assume this is the same "crankshaft" that Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for Associated Press, reported on the day after the blast. 6/  https://t.co/4kxstFoZqN
1301211557372850179 2020-09-03 01:33:05 +0800 <drbairdonline> Actually what the USMC caption refers to as a "crankcase" is clearly NOT a crankcase (which houses the crankshaft) but rather a crankshaft with (as I count them) six connecting rods (without the pistons) meaning this is from a 6-cylinder engine. 5/  https://t.co/qRzZexoU1h
1301211554982096898 2020-09-03 01:33:04 +0800 <drbairdonline> As the only "physical evidence" of the "truck bomb" that the USMC said caused the massive explosion, they provided this official photo of the crater where "the white arrow points to a crankcase, all that remained of the truck after it was detonated." 4/  https://t.co/3Ej8gKH0LK  https://t.co/tQfmwxGgi7
1301195773439172608 2020-09-03 00:30:22 +0800 <drbairdonline> The pile of rubble stretched as far as 70 meters from where the 4-story Battalion Landing Team (BLT) bldg had been &amp; rose to height of at least 15 ft. At the pile's center was a massive crater initially reported as 30-40 ft wide &amp; 20-40 ft deep in what was the BLT lobby floor. 3/  https://t.co/Kr0KKIymgh
1301195771975401472 2020-09-03 00:30:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> Although hardly "the largest non-nuclear explosion since WWII" or otherwise, the 1983 Beirut blast that killed 241 US military personnel was certainly the most powerful "terrorist" explosive device as of that date, based on the force of the explosion alone. 2/  https://t.co/vtCUqWMBeZ
1301195770138210309 2020-09-03 00:30:21 +0800 <drbairdonline> 1983 bombing of US Marine barracks in Beirut called repeatedly ‚Äúthe largest non-nuclear explosion ever" (or since WWII). This propaganda served many purposes, incl possibly providing cover for what was actually an Israeli ‚Äúclean‚Äù micro-nuke that Joe Vialls ID'ed in 2002 Thread 1/  https://t.co/1TUUr39N70
1300897599709351937 2020-09-02 04:45:31 +0800 <drbairdonline> @Prash_Chainani @zaraalichaudhry I encourage to read the full article by Aussie online investigator Joe Vialls but here's a snapshot answer to your question.  https://t.co/zq3OiiqUo0  https://t.co/yMwurXo9nC
1300860568585121792 2020-09-02 02:18:23 +0800 <drbairdonline> @Leila1H @LebIsThePhoenix Unfortunately the so-called "explosives experts" you would probably trust long ago became totally corrupted paid consultants to prop up "official" Military-Industrial-Media-Academic Complex #MIMAC stories as I showed in this thread on the 2005 Beirut blast  https://t.co/C3ntlwF3Yo
1300847217465389056 2020-09-02 01:25:19 +0800 <drbairdonline> If you're interested in my journey from complete psyop on 9/11 to red-pilled HS history teacher in summer of 2013 to my current Twitter threads on nuclear terrorism like this one on the 2020 Beirut mega-blast, check out my conversation with @100thMPP  https://t.co/CbuX1OX6b1  https://t.co/llchLFollF
1300809255528755202 2020-09-01 22:54:29 +0800 <drbairdonline> Great thread fm Syrian Girl @partisangirl on the #BeirutBlast! She doesn't address most likely scenario (underground nuke) but asks the right questions (e.g., What blasted 43-m deep crater?) &amp; as a chemist she certainly knows it was NOT ammonium nitrate!  https://t.co/vmN9jTqDNv  https://t.co/YZt46J4spw
