Trump, Flynn, and any other Senator or Representative claiming this election was stolen and should be overturned by military or unconstitutional means are traitors! Flynn should have his military rank and pension stripped, and every elected official should be gone!
1344068199130791937 2020-12-30 07:50:04 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump Really? "Fake Tapper" has the highest rated cable news program in the 25-54 demographic!  Want to try again, Fox Network laughingstock? Project Veritas? 🤣😂 The same Project Veritas with the Pennsylvania lying mailman claiming election fraud? Talk about "Fake"!
1344067474732556288 2020-12-30 07:47:12 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Nope. You didn't win the Nobel Peace prize...again. Using "Hoedown" from Aaron Copeland's "Rodeo" is fitting music. Your life on the Presidential farm has been truly one of picking up horse shit.

You got impeached because you were caught and now you've been voted out of office because the American people are sick of you and your antics. Just go away. The sooner the better.

Placing trucks of mail-in votes, absentee votes under tables allows counters to start counting these ballots as soon as they are finished processing Election Day ballots. It is standard even in the states you won.

1338867770952306690 2020-12-15 23:25:26 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump You stated in November that if the Electoral College declared Joe Biden as President-elect, you would leave. Were you just lying again?

1338863583841505289 2020-12-15 23:08:47 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @KMCRadio @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden This is not a credible audit. The "evidence" provided in this report has already been invalidated. Second, why is this a "revised" report? What parts of the report have been changed?
1338863254538350597 2020-12-15 23:07:29 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂  We can see this a "revised report". Let's see the original report. Additionally, "evidence" on this was presented to several courts and was not accepted but deemed not credible. This individual didn't do an actual audit of the voting machines, but info.

1338152730855170055 2020-12-14 00:04:07 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump "Standing" means "harm". Texas had no standing means they (and other states) were not harmed by the election regulations of other states. You might have standing; however, you should have challenged these laws when they were enacted, not just because you lost.
1338151443711348739 2020-12-13 23:59:00 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GravelInstitute Have you performed any research on past picks of SecDef and where they were employed previously? Or just Biden's?

1338149320672088066 2020-12-13 23:50:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump You certainly tried to make it that way but it didn't work. All those efforts to destroy the USPS. Getting Red State governors to get rid of ballot drop boxes. Purging voter rolls. Gerrymandering. All the screams of voter fraud BEFORE the election. Fact is - YOU ARE A LOSER!

A man who will be remembered by his failure

1337429294793023488 2020-12-12 00:09:26 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC The media didn't have the info and as soon as they did, they reported it, prompting Hunter Biden's statement. Now why don't you tell us about all of the Trump investigations...
1337425349681029120 2020-12-11 23:53:46 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC @SCAttyGenOffice How many improper votes have been found? Two in Pennsylvania. Both by Republicans voting for Trump. You disgusting trope!

This IS NOT the Trump vaccine unless we are also going to name the virus the Trump Virus.
1337422086227304455 2020-12-11 23:40:48 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @senatemajldr They did not say that they blocked due to the election. Their bill has been sitting on your desk since May. You blocked passage by not even bringing it up for a vote. Republican Senate blocked relief because you thought Trump was going to cheat and win! But he cheated and LOST!!

Now his employees turned him in for bribery, using his office illegally, etc. and he fired them with some resigning. Then he concocts this bullshit. Pardon, anyone?

1336071858341507072 2020-12-08 06:15:28 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @RepBrianBabin to continue to chase this farcical nonsense about voter fraud is beyond ridiculous. Then for a Texas elected official to actual proffer a bill to stop dead people from voting? Seriously? This was why you were elected? The only reason people are confused is this BS!

1336033725445001221 2020-12-08 03:43:57 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey, see the "SC" at the end of your Twitter handle? That's your state - tend to it and keep your nose out of other states' business.
1336033331427876864 2020-12-08 03:42:23 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump You thought recounts would get you the win also; how'd that work out for ya?

Hmmm, Lindsey learned nothing from his near loss during the election. Americans are tired of corrupt elected officials.

Go now to the other Trump propaganda networks that soon will find themselves excluded from the White House Press Corps and Press Secretary briefings. Or as I call them, the Trump Bullshit Networks.

How an individual voted shouldn't be identified back to them. That's why ballots aren't signed. The signature is on the envelope and is matched against voter registration signatures. The QR code ensures the ballot is counted once.

The Governor has no power to interfere in the election. If the Secretary of State finds no reason to do this, it won't be done. You lost. Period.

You might to also do some research. The Supreme Court won't take cases other courts dismiss due to lack or no evidence. You can't just take a case to the Supreme Court. You petition the court to hear your case; the vast majority of cases petitioned aren't heard

What is there about a structure that makes it essential for religion to be practiced in? Is there something there that makes it essential for religious services? Can people not practice their religion at home?
1332716790816911362 2020-11-29 00:03:38 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @DanCrenshawTX The 2020 election was the best run and protected election in history. Keep being a Trump sheep and insist there is widespread wrongdoing when NONE has been proven in a court of law where lying can get you jail time. 2005 election primers should be updated to today's issues
1332714065903423488 2020-11-28 23:52:48 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump You lost. By millions. Still. So far your sheep Republicans in the state legislatures haven't helped you because they can't break the law.  There is nothing that displays a man's character more than the way he handles defeat. #DiaperDonnie

People telling stories about supposed voting process errors they know nothing about. Crying about being told they can't handle ballots, not being allowed to violate COVID #'s

Let's kiss some more Trump ass before he's out the door. A pardon is an admission of guilt and takes away Flynn's use of the 5th Amendment. In this case, it also keeps him from talking about Trump

1331715962962391040 2020-11-26 05:46:42 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @MarkMeadows Huh? Trump FIRED Flynn for lying to the VP. Flynn pled guilty TWICE then tried to take it back. Flynn is a disgrace not a patriot. A pardon is an admission of guilt and Flynn can't plead the 5th.
1331714651541958657 2020-11-26 05:41:29 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump SO, WHAT INFO DOES @GenFlynn HAVE ON YOU?  So far, you've commuted or pardoned those who could spill the beans on your misdeeds and who've kept silent. You're a criminal and so is Flynn and company.
1331708522166358022 2020-11-26 05:17:08 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump @GenFlynn A pardon is an admission of guilt.

No more if this bullshit about how Flynn was harassed into pleading guilty. In order to accept the pardon, Flynn is admitting guilt. Flynn is a disgrace to the uniform and to this country.

As a monitor, that is what you'll be watching. No signatures for you to check. The ballots aren't signed for privacy purposes.
1331058623045365760 2020-11-24 10:14:40 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @mtgreenee @realDonaldTrump Ballots aren't signed, QAnon idiot. The US believes in privacy. You don't have a right to see how people voted. Signatures were verified against registration information; envelopes aren't kept. Big difference between a "monitor" and handling ballots, which you WON'T be doing.

This trip should be investigated.
1330551903126740996 2020-11-23 00:41:08 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @mog7546 @AlanDersh A lawsuit based on the Equal Protection Clause still must have the foundation of factual evidence, which is the element the Trump campaign and its advocates have lacked. Their "sworn affidavits" have proven repeatedly to be lies or assumptions. Your BS is collapsing.
1330549736236064768 2020-11-23 00:32:32 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @ColoradoDavidSu Yes. But he's always put the country before his party. He's not hesitated to criticize Trump when his actions called for it.
1330546612674973698 2020-11-23 00:20:07 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @JennaEllisEsq Unless the outcome was GUARANTEED prior to its finish, it couldn't be STOLEN. Trump did try to cheat - dismantle USPS, get Repub Govs to remove ballot drop boxes in heavy Dem districts, get Repub legislatures to limit days of return of mail-in ballots, sow seeds of fraud before.
1330544891441582083 2020-11-23 00:13:17 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @ColoradoDavidSu Kemp already certified the election. He can't overturn it now. The SoS already agreed to conduct yet another recount, this time will be conducted via electronic machine. This needs to be the end. Forget their request for signature audits!

1330522298831482881 2020-11-22 22:43:30 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LizRNC From the Trump appointee that took years for Senate approval, and proclaimed that churches should endorse political candidates in violation of the separation of church and state and tax-exempt status. Trey Trainor has no standing in this ongoing election issue. The judges rule.
1330520163519754240 2020-11-22 22:35:01 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @AnthonySabatini You should be censured.

1330518759820374019 2020-11-22 22:29:26 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump I thought it was all about mail-in ballots and the numbers couldn't possibly be right. So they did a hand recount. Then when that didn't come out in your favor, you want another check of something else. Georgia has been certified!

It is ridiculous to continue to go over this just to appease the childish behavior of a 73 year-old man. The election in Georgia is certified. Move on.

1330267518825619456 2020-11-22 05:51:06 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @BrettDGilman Just let @Jim_Jordan try and run for Governor. All the Ohio State sexual assault stuff he's been hiding will all come up. In addition to all the complicity with Trumpism. Go ahead Jim. Give it a shot. Can't wait to see your buried by your own hypocrisy.

Hundreds of ill-informed sponges who trust a man because he's the President. Not understanding that he is lying to them and has used them over the last four years for his own gain.
1330238648286130181 2020-11-22 03:56:23 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @CNN Guy should be removed from his position.

As you said, she's been in public health for decades. We needed her leadership at a very crucial time when the nation's leader was insisting on opening up the country. She remained silent.

It's not cheating; it completely legal, and should have been emphasized even more since we're in a pandemic. That's where Trump screwed up - telling Repubs not to use it.

Too bad for Trump and his integrity- and character-lacking Klan, but the state canvassing board already stated they fully expect to certify the election at their level.

Who will be the first  person with integrity to put the country before self, put your foot down, tell the President he's wrong and to stop all the lies about the election; he lost, start the transition process, and get on with it!!!

Chris Krebs did his job and contradicted you regarding election security and he would know!  No dead people voted (already proven incorrect), no voter fraud, no DOMINION issues, observers WERE allowed. YOU LOST!!!!
1328835825740767235 2020-11-18 07:02:04 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @jilevin Nope. Pardoning Trump will also send a message that it's ok to abuse your power by using govt agencies to do your personal bidding. There should NEVER be another President that behaved like Trump behaved!

One question about the Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania SecState phone calls - did you also phone any of the SecStates of Trump-won states?  Or just those that Biden flipped and won?  Because you know how ALL the other states run elections?  Hmmm...

Additionally, if the ballots are bad, so are ALL of the Senate votes as they were on the same ballot, so those need to be discounted also. You Republicans need to check the background of your witnesses.

That's what Trump wants; he wants a fight in the streets. His Klan open carries and are just looking for a fight. Let them march for him; who gives a crap? We voted and we won!

And we won't forget in January, mid-terms, or in 2024. No chance!

You just want to sew seeds of doubt about our Democracy with Trump's base because you know they believe ANYTHING you tell them, regardless of facts. SAD!
1325902611078406152 2020-11-10 04:46:31 +0800 <JudyC57625988> And then go out and try to find evidence to back up the accusation. You are denigrating both Repub and Dem volunteer side-by-side workers in election centers who've been laboring for days. Comparing this to Gore v Bush is ridiculous. Absolutely apples and oranges. Thousands of

As soon as a network projected Biden a win in a typically RED state, Trump spouted "voter fraud", with absolutely no evidence. And it progressed. You don't accuse

1325529824379727872 2020-11-09 04:05:11 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @genuine_ersatz Good one! 🤣

1325528425319329793 2020-11-09 03:59:38 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @megynkelly You were hoping to become relevant again when Trump was re-elected. Then you could feel good spouting this bullshit. You are irrelevant now and have been for some time. You won't ever be relevant again. Go to Newsmax or OANN and stretch those "journalist" talents. Waste of time.
1325525893469581322 2020-11-09 03:49:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @AJDelgado13 That was good! 🤣😂

1325524364817813509 2020-11-09 03:43:30 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Here's what we've learned: You tried to cheat by dismantling the USPS, getting GOP Govs to restrict ballot drop boxes, getting GOP govs and legislatures to change election laws, and now you're enlisting folks to make up bullshit stories. Guess what? We voted and you're out! GO!
1325523619854815234 2020-11-09 03:40:32 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump I believe the words they all used were "we can project...".   YOU DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT IN 2016!
1325468228399853568 2020-11-09 00:00:26 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @sarahcpr I so want Mitch, Cruz, Rubio, Graham to lose their "power".

Perhaps they didn't run strong enough campaigns. Police reform needs to happen. Period. If some didn't understand "Defund the police" then turn off the tv and do some research.

Yet we still voted!
1325464929701388288 2020-11-08 23:47:19 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @oncerepublican 🤣😂

America has had mail-in ballots since the Civil War. Trump was calling fraud BEFORE the election, which gave him an out when he was outvoted. Face it - you lost!

1325224268381229059 2020-11-08 07:51:01 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @fwtoney Yes
1325224211993014273 2020-11-08 07:50:48 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @SebGorka Actually, the election is over.
1325207195433144321 2020-11-08 06:43:11 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump @GOP You need to step up. The courts assessed that observers WERE allowed in counting rooms. The US doesn't grant the winner of an election based on vote counts but on the Electoral College. Allegations about "bad things not seen" are a joke. Go to court with evidence. STOP BS!
1325206287420846082 2020-11-08 06:39:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @AshaRangappa_ I hate to say it, but he may be crafting an unconditional pardon for Pence to give Trump, once he resigns after the SCOTUS refuses to hear election cases. I think this was always the plan should he lose. That way he can always say his election was stolen and never concede he lost
1325204936112680960 2020-11-08 06:34:12 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Republican observers were allowed, in EVERY counting center nationwide. It doesn't matter if mail-in ballots went out unsolicited. They were scanned going out, scanned coming in. If someone voted in-person, their mail-in ballot was nullified if it wasn't used or came in after.
1325204249429438466 2020-11-08 06:31:28 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump And you should be proud of that. President-Elect Joe Biden has broken the record for votes in any presidential election in history.
1325203577275609089 2020-11-08 06:28:48 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @DanaPerino That is how it's done across the country for adjudication: 1 Dem, 1 Repub at the least. Some even include an Independent.

The same USPS that was damaged by Trump in order to slow down arrival of ballots to election centers so they wouldn't be counted? That USPS? Interesting...also interesting this would take place in a RED stronghold. Hmmm, didn't actually see anything and had no evidence.

Interesting that it's about USPS, the service that Trump screwed with to slow down the arrival of ballots so they couldn't be counted, yet @LindseyGrahamSC didn't have an issue with that.

1324902074719547392 2020-11-07 10:30:44 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @AshaRangappa_ That's exactly why they WON'T call it. Statistically, with the votes still outstanding, there is a possibility that Trump could pull it out. I believe the last dump tonight for PA and perhaps AZ might be the one they need. The problem is soooo many still outstanding votes...
1324900084669100037 2020-11-07 10:22:50 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GOPChairwoman How can you say that Republican observers were not allowed in Michigan election centers to observe vote counting, yet you say you have over 100 affidavits from Michigan stating there was voter fraud occurring? You can't have it both ways here, Ronna. Lies!
1324895773641814017 2020-11-07 10:05:42 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @cooperchip1 Then he can kiss any chance of running again goodbye, along with members of his family. It would be a tremendous mistake.
1324894436153815040 2020-11-07 10:00:23 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Can you seriously not understand how the election system works? Please get someone to explain it to you. This is ridiculous.

1324853246368894976 2020-11-07 07:16:43 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @KatrinaPierson All ballots were cast either before or on Election Day. Polling centers are closed after Election Day. The first counted are in-person votes. The second are mail-in/absentee ballots. The third group are military/overseas ballots. With the large turnout, it takes time to count.

They believe the Dems rigged a nationwide election involving 100K's of people, stretched out for days until a winner could be determined. No blue wave to substantiate polls and yet we forgot to rig Senate and House elections. No wonder...
1324831013109964806 2020-11-07 05:48:22 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @johncardillo And we just forgot to also rig the Senate and House elections? Asshat.

You will NEVER be President or a credible representative of your state or country because you crave air time, no matter the subject. All election centers had observers, there is no controversy here.

1324760616259608576 2020-11-07 01:08:38 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @gop Your party told Hillary Clinton every day since the election in 2016 to "get over it, you lost." She NEVER filed a legal fight to stop vote counting, invalidate votes, decry the institution of our democracy, etc.. She conceded the election when it was verified she lost.

Someone needs to intervene here from your party. If someone gets hurt because of this crazy man, it's on you because you refused to step up. THIS IS WRONG!
1324503439251066880 2020-11-06 08:06:42 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @gop It is indeed a sad night in America when the top representative of your party is calling the election a fraud because there is a good possibility he will lose. This is pathetic. This is illogical and makes no sense. Mail-in votes are not fraudulent because Dems used them.

Don't be an asshole, Sean. If Trump loses, he lost. Period. People got tired of his bullshit.
1324452112227512322 2020-11-06 04:42:45 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @FXMoore2 @Joyfulvink94 To be honest, Kentucky is very richly RED. While watching MSNBC and flipping back and forth between them and CNN, all called California, Oregon, Washington for Biden, almost right after their polls closed, so it's the same thing. I don't believe there's anything funky there.
1324450685522481154 2020-11-06 04:37:05 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @BillOReilly Why? Because Trump's not winning? Ridiculous. Do you see Biden discounting any of the President's wins in the states Trump won? No. The fact is Trump is a bad loser. There was NEVER a guarantee he was going to win reelection. Far from it.
1324440535403237384 2020-11-06 03:56:45 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Nope. The "big legal win" allows you to watch. Watch Biden votes be counted. Wow! 😂🤣

We will uncover every illegal act. If you think for one minute Trump should be your candidate in 2024 or anyone else affiliated with him, recommend you keep looking.
1324436553901506563 2020-11-06 03:40:55 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GOP, Trump is your President. He dismantled the USPS to prevent ballots from arriving on time. You did nothing. He didn't start screaming about fraud after the election until it looked like he might not win. This is not how elections work. Count the votes - name the winner.

STOP SUPPORTING TRUMP!  He is a despicable human being and a worse President. The media treated him exactly as they should have - calling out his lies and acts
1324076149325111296 2020-11-05 03:48:48 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump So many people wanted you voted out that the total votes in this election far exceed those of any other. WE WANT YOU GONE!
1324075377564766210 2020-11-05 03:45:44 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Yes there are. Let them be counted.
1324071221462552577 2020-11-05 03:29:13 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Yeah, you tried everything you could think of to suppress the vote: screw around with the Postal Service, get Republican Governors to get rid of ballot drop boxes, sue states over their election laws, etc..  But the voter will speak and you can't stop them. Karma is a good thing.
1324007761550757895 2020-11-04 23:17:03 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @BlairBrandt Someone unwilling to concede your candidate made a HUGE error in judgement?

Harassing an opponent's campaign vehicles on a major highway is against the law. An accident could easily have happened and people could have been injured or died. GROW UP!

He's not doing this out of his heart.

And yes, they surrounded, slowed down, and attempted to run the bus off the road. I live in this area. We are fully aware of what took place.

Bobulinski is the male Tara Reade. I'm disappointed in him because he's a vet. While he only did the obligatory four years, he's still a vet. And vets that stoop this low are sad.
1319491070003171329 2020-10-23 12:09:20 +0800 <JudyC57625988> Tony Bobulinski is the male equivalent of Tara Reade, the first Trump-paid accuser of Joe Biden. That story crumbled as will this one. What's disgusting about this one is that Tony is a Navy vet. Only did his obligatory four years but still a vet. And for a vet to stoop is sad.

For your information, 56% of asylum seekers showed up for their initial hearings, even though many don't speak or read English. Not speaking a second language is not a basis for judging a person's IQ.

But I don't agree with your comment that flyovers won't be happening if Biden-Harris get elected. Ridiculous comment and as a veteran, it was uncalled for. Not cool, Troy. I know you're a Trump supporter (to each his own) but not cool

He voted on a bill to get rid of Medicare, get rid of CHIP, and at one time, to abolish the ACA. He's like Flake - feels free to criticize Trump once he's resigned from his seat but not before.
1318745924252950530 2020-10-21 10:48:24 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Over 220,000 dead and those numbers grow everyday. And you are telling people to ignore COVID because you're tired of it. Each one of those who've passed had families and you owe each family an apology. Ignore COVID? No we won't. And @JoeBiden won't. Because it matters.
1318745342385553408 2020-10-21 10:46:05 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump We need to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy. Period. That does not mean lost jobs. That means those with fossil fuel jobs will transition to clean energy jobs. Better jobs, better pay. Under a far better administration whose primary concern is the people, not money.

Hunter Biden doesn't live in Delaware; he lives in California. He's not flying to Wilmington to drop off a computer to a blind repairman. Tell Rudy his bs attempts to get Biden are getting worse.

It's just as bad as Trump retweeting QAnon conspiracy theories. Either take the time to do some basic research or don't report it, i.e., Hunter Biden has lived in California since 2018.

You've already tried voter suppression with your "one ballot box per county" trick. That didn't stop Dems. We've come out in droves! 2 million + early voters already! Piss us off?

LA has computer repair stores. He's not going to fly to Delaware to give a laptop to a blind repairman and not pick it up. Ridiculous. Let's see. Tara Reade, Ukraine, pedophilia. All Repub BS.
1317314570671841281 2020-10-17 12:00:42 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @JoyceWhiteVance Honestly, I believe it will. Come January, when all of Trump's secrets in government are uncovered and disclosed, everyone who supported him will be quickly saying how they were hoodwinked, fooled, manipulated, etc.. This is really why Trump is afraid. It's all going to come out.

Hunter Biden lives in California and has since 2018. LA has computer repair shops. Basic research. He's not flying to Wilmington for repairs. Do the work.

My question is: are all these people carrying this corrupt gene before working with Trump and he uncovers it, or do they become infected by Trump? It's amazing how some people I once respected have changed so much after four years of Trump.

The fact is YOU DON'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT HEALTH CARE PLAN. YOU DON'T PLAN EVER. You make decisions off the fly; the wrong thing.

While you may think that's fair, Trump is the one that pulled out of the virtual debate. I can't wait until your incompetent ass is canned!
1316552765070610432 2020-10-15 09:33:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @NBCNews At the same time as the Biden Town Hall on ABC?  Absolutely stupid decision. Why not push it back and get the entire audience instead of splitting the baby here. I would have watched both but because of your idiotic decision, I'll be watching Joe only.

Additionally, what right did the store owner have to make a copy of the hard drive and turn it over to a non-owner third party (Giuliani)?

It's up to Congress to try to get support for it. I'm with Biden. Right now, we don't know how the hearings will go with Barrett or whether she'll be confirmed.

1314684708278632457 2020-10-10 05:50:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @bblock29 @SecPompeo is @HillaryClinton trying to sneak into the election? I could have sworn she wasn't running! She is so amazing, isn't she???
1314684154576080898 2020-10-10 05:48:22 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @JoyceWhiteVance @SecPompeo The State Dept investigation found there were no systemic violations among the rare instances of classified found on the unclass system. Are you also going to investigate @IvankaTrump's use of personal email to conduct US Govt work? When can we expect that to begin?
1314678353513852928 2020-10-10 05:25:19 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC @harrisonjaime Nope. He's ducking the debate because during a pandemic with outbreaks all over, especially at the WH and Congress, you are refusing to take a COVID TEST. He beat your ass on the first debate; you are the one that needed this debate, not Jaime. You played the debate game and lost
1314677784321687555 2020-10-10 05:23:03 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @charliekirk11 What does that tell you Charlie? The Nobel Committee are not stupid. Those "peace" deals between countries not in conflict are nothing but closet arms sales. He's a crook and everyone knows it. Nobel Prizes don't go to impeached corrupt leaders.
1314677224696619013 2020-10-10 05:20:50 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @atrupar So 1) Why is @SecPompeo involved with Clinton's e-mails unless this is further Russian misinformation? 2) Clinton isn't running for office - what exactly does Pompeo think the effect will be except raise suspicion on the release?
1314675619641331712 2020-10-10 05:14:27 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Hmmm. Why are these mistakes with ballots happening in Republican-led states? NOT voter fraud as the ballots were not filled in.
1314674717173874690 2020-10-10 05:10:52 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @MarshaBlackburn Just like Republicans have done over the last four years, not only SCOTUS, but also district and appeals courts?  With a lot of people deemed "unqualified" by the American Bar Association!  Can't wait until you get voted out of office!
1314579347722899457 2020-10-09 22:51:54 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @KellyannePolls For those of us Americans who do our own shopping, it's a true statement. But those of you who are above this task, just keep looking down your nose and see where it gets you @KellyannePolls @Peggynoonannyc
1314577393672228864 2020-10-09 22:44:08 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @JillWineBanks The ballots were to be delivered to voters, so they were still blank. Looks like a young frustrated postal worker. Trump shouldn't be tweeting this - blank ballots is not voter fraud.

1314414457364328448 2020-10-09 11:56:41 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Biden owns guns, Virginia. He supports the 2nd Amendment.

1314413723201818626 2020-10-09 11:53:46 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump The ballots were being delivered to residents. They had not been filled out. Once again, NOT VOTER FRAUD!!!

1314407945036337153 2020-10-09 11:30:49 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Texans know Joe owns guns and supports the 2nd Amendment. Joe DOES NOT support weapons whose sole purpose is killing humans. Military-style weapons have no place in the general public. Joe is a practicing Catholic. You are a practicing nothing. Joe believes in clean energy jobs!
1314407256641937413 2020-10-09 11:28:05 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump This is exactly why Governor Whitmer's life was at stake, you 322-pound fat ignorant asshat! You knew nothing of the FBI's operation until it was complete. Why the hell should she thank you? For calling your right-wing armed militia to action with your "LIBERATE MICHIGAN" skree?
1314403939853512708 2020-10-09 11:14:54 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @maggieNYT Even when Trump had absolutely nothing to do with any of it.

With the exception of a Hannity interview conducted via phone, this POTUS has not publicly denounced white supremacists/nationalists. His "LIBERATE MICHIGAN" skree was a call for action. He NEVER denounced armed right-wing militia taking over the capitol building.
1314401794139795457 2020-10-09 11:06:22 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC Why not get tested, Lindsey? Why not? Stop playing the Trump game. You're gonna lose.
1314401459769925632 2020-10-09 11:05:03 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Harris called for a ban as a Presidential candidate. Now she's a VP candidate, she follows Biden's plan, which is keep current fracking but transition in the future to clean energy. Also not a lie that Lincoln waited until AFTER the election to confirm his nominee for SCOTUS.

That Russian misinformation about Clinton planning a Russian hoax is too funny but you idiot Repubs keep saying it's a fact. It's a fact that the Russians made it up.

When POTUS starts calling sitting senators "monsters" and "communists", demands past POTUS and VP be charged with crimes, etc., it's time to wonder if he is being affected by medications or his illness, which he is NOT "cured" from. Out of control!

Biden isn't against fracking; he plans on banning future fracking and transitioning those in fossil fuel jobs to more clean energy jobs. Joe owns guns; he's not anti-2nd Amendment. Joe is a practicing Catholic; more than we can say about Trump.

1312939562168090628 2020-10-05 10:15:59 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @DearAuntCrabby I'm with you. This is making no sense. I have no doubt he tested positive, but I doubt the rest of it. I believe they thought this would give him a bump in polls, which didn't happen. His treatment isn't measuring up to a quick discharge tomorrow.
1312939022776504321 2020-10-05 10:13:50 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @joelockhart @VP Or is it because this is all a stunt over nothing but a positive test? The doctors say one thing, Chief of Staff say another, videos and pictures of POTUS none in hospital garb, his limo parade today, etc...

1312934864832868353 2020-10-05 09:57:19 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Just based on the questions (Joe Biden's mental acuity, but not Trump's, etc.), this was a Republican-led poll and that alone means it's skewed. Such bullshit. Maybe some of your base believes it, but those of us with some semblance of intelligence do not. Nice try, Donny!

1312914272897445889 2020-10-05 08:35:30 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump What a waste of taxpayer funds to secure extra law enforcement for the sides of the street as you did your little parade in front of the hospital? What a waste of funds? Yet people are losing their jobs, don't have food or a roof over their head, and your ego needs stroking?  Sad
1312841966917484548 2020-10-05 03:48:10 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GOP That's not delivering for Americans. That's delivering for ill-informed Republicans. Sad that the vast majority were "not qualified" by the ABA.

Having a sponsored bill passed in the Senate-only is not a passed bill. A successful bill is passed by both chambers and signed into law by POTUS - you should know that.

1311871297413148673 2020-10-02 11:31:05 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @CNN It's not going to matter. They have the votes to confirm her. Democrats refusing to see her doesn't prove a point here. Honestly, I would rather the Dems talk to her and discuss with her their concerns.

Michigan just lodged felony charges against them for voter intimidation based on 1000's of robocalls made to predominantly black registered voters.

The vast majority of voters (red, blue, undecided) were disgusted at the behavior displayed at the debate. Even Trump's coaches were not happy.

1311493934976167937 2020-10-01 10:31:35 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @kayleighmcenany Trump sought to do business with Luzhkov in 1990s, according to SEC filings, comments made by Luzhkov. He planned to secure high-profile real-estate deals in Russia, which Trump was still pursuing as recently as 2016 with a proposal for a Trump Tower Moscow.

Once signed and returned, the ballots' signatures are matched against those on the voter registration rolls. Stop being so dramatic. Fill in your ballot, sign it, get it back. Stop with the "fraud" bullshit.

The ratings certainly didn't show how many tuned out after the first 15 minutes of your shitshow. The vast majority of unbiased polls show Americans hated your behavior. You lost!

And you have some incorrect. 1) Joe Biden is a private citizen - he doesn't have to respond to demands for his justice noms. 2) Joe said AntiFa isn't a left wing group 3) Biden walked back the lockdown talk awhile ago.  Stop trying to be relevant.

1311320476564754432 2020-09-30 23:02:19 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump YOU ARE WEAK! Your lies last night were obvious, and you have no plans for the next four years. You refused to denounce white supremacy and have bolstered the Proud Boys even more. You're a bully in a bad suit and red tie. You're a loser.

The President of the United States acted like a man-child last night, throwing a tantrum when criticized. This is who you are supporting? Sad.

Most of my friends turned it off after 8 minutes because they couldn't watch it. He lost whatever audience he was going after. Just chaos, hatred, disrespect, etc.. He showed you what he is - a bully.
1311138431653871619 2020-09-30 10:58:56 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Yes. We saw your plan tonight for the next four years. It is this. This comportment where rules agreed upon go out the window, no respect, no acceptance of criticism, lying, spewing of debunked conspiracy theories, just pure SHIT FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS!!!
1311136484393725954 2020-09-30 10:51:12 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump A complete disgrace as a President. Interrupt, talk-over, demean, mock, etc.. You can't stand to hear the truth about yourself, so you pivot and attack. Biden was talking about his dead son, you said "Who? Hunter?" Refused to denounce right-wing militia groups. "Stand by"?

Is it the same reason you can't participate in an election with claiming you can't lose unless your opponent cheated?  Dishonest POTUS.

I have yet to hear a Democratic office holder or political pundit attach her because of her Catholicism. If confirmed, she won't be the only Catholic on the bench. It's not her faith they're going after. It's her not wanting to separate church and state.

Churchill watched bombing raids from London rooftops but he never gave a speech from there. Churchill's message was not to keep calm - it was to brace for the worst and to sacrifice to fight back.

Yes, Biden is raising taxes on those making over $400,000 to take the tax burden off the middle class, where Trump put it. You need to get a dose of reality because you're going down with Ship Trump!

Rasmussen is the ONLY poll of many that is feeding you those numbers. All others have your disapproval numbers above your approval numbers.

1305207005825687552 2020-09-14 02:09:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @GOP @NatalieJHarp Lies. Trump is suing to end the ACA and that includes coverage of pre-existing conditions. There is no Trump Healthcare Plan, even though he said he was signing it over a month ago. Didn't happen because it doesn't exist.

No more rallies, no more golfing on taxpayer dime, no more using taxpayer money to boost Trump Org, no more adulation of world dictators because you'll just be another failed businessman going to prison.
1305203716094595081 2020-09-14 01:56:30 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump There is no Bay of Pigs award. A group of octogenarian vets from Cuba who still believe President Kennedy betrayed them endorsed you back in 2016. You went to them and asked for an endorsement. That's like getting an endorsement from the employees of Trump Doral.

He said it to Woodward - it's on tape. Is this not true, Lindsey? Don't start with this fake "disappointment". Trump knows what this is about; no doubt you do also.

Biden supported travel restrictions.
1304253221175734272 2020-09-11 10:59:34 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @TuckerCarlson Are the "leaked audio tapes" of CNN's Cuomo discussing accusations of sexual harassment or Zucker praising Trump your equivalency to Trump's admitted lies to America regarding COVID, racism, covering up for Khashoggi's murder? If so, you failed miserably. A joke.

There is intel that Russia is. Russia is more than "pro-Trump"; they are actively engaged in the same tactics they used in 2016. The IC already stated China indicated a preference for Biden. Sane choice

Dictating to your doctor what you want said is ridiculous. Tell us what gives or shut up
1300917684033519619 2020-09-02 06:05:20 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @LindseyGrahamSC And of course, Lindsey is one of many Republicans to jump to conclusions and scream "Foul!". "Contextualizing" is also one of the options. Some of these monuments don't fall under their jurisdiction and even then, any changes have to go through the city council for approval.

1300813233926877187 2020-09-01 23:10:17 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @realDonaldTrump Biden is going to raise taxes on anyone making over $400,000 a year. Gotta get back those billions you gave away to all your rich friends.
1300810486452228097 2020-09-01 22:59:22 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @marcorubio Dearest Dumb Marco, back in the old days, men and women of color were not thought to be a part of "all men are created equal". They were thought of as property, not people. They were owned, kidnapped, and sold as property, just like livestock. So please just be quiet.

He started it at Lafayette Square when the protestors were gassed and shit at with rubber bullets. Now his right-wing agitators travel to protest cities to instigate violence. He's been consistent all right. Consistently supporting those who try to stop protests.

What I don't get is this, so Biden will stumble over a passage in his speech, but you say nothing about Trump doing the same, or slurring his words, or talking about "dark shadowy figures controlling the streets" or his other conspiracies?
1300628213404762112 2020-09-01 10:55:05 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @abigailmarone Uhh, Biden said "No NEW fracking." Not banning fracking. Did you see Trump's interview on Fox? OMG. Plane load of black-dressed thugs loaded up with gear? Deal shadowy people controlling Biden. Your man is absolutely a nut job!

1300617066593083393 2020-09-01 10:10:47 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @benshapiro The systemic racism comes in when you routinely use that force against certain people, especially when it's unjustified. Racism is a learned trait.
1300616655480016896 2020-09-01 10:09:09 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @benshapiro Systemic: definition - relating to a system, especially as opposed to a particular part. It's not about the people. The people are a part of the system. Law enforcement has systemic racism - due to its core element of using force, either verbal or physical, to control actions

The peaceful protests started because of unarmed Black men being killed by white LE. Trump has DONE NOTHING to try to fix this. Instead he refuses to say LE is flawed. His supporters take up arms and travel to these cities
1300614083364958208 2020-09-01 09:58:56 +0800 <JudyC57625988> @Jim_Jordan That's right, Jim. When's the last time we had such a racist, white nationalist President?  Huh? You know what's stoking these flames? His complete disregard for the issues that initially started the protests. Then his white boy right-wing militia gangs traveled to these cities.
