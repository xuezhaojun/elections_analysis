1329515398794858497 2020-11-20 04:02:26 +0800 <sharmaparth03> Notice most of the deserts of the world are located on these latitudes? Now you know one of the reasons why.
1329515396857163776 2020-11-20 04:02:26 +0800 <sharmaparth03> But why did their boats not move on these latitudes? 30°N &amp; S are areas of "very high air pressure" aka subtropical high. These areas are characterised by very calm winds and very less precipitation.
1329515388330143746 2020-11-20 04:02:24 +0800 <sharmaparth03> The sailors then had a shortage of food and drinking water forcing them to dump their horses into the ocean in order to survive (also to reduce weight of the ship). This location of 30°N and 30°S latitudes is also known as horse latitudes.  https://t.co/Kn8JPmLxqH
1329515380428001281 2020-11-20 04:02:22 +0800 <sharmaparth03> Interesting story: In earlier times many sailors travelling huge distances often boarded their horses onto the ships as they could stop on any island to collect food and other products. But during their course they often reached a point where their ships would not move at all.

1328015529592832000 2020-11-16 00:42:30 +0800 <sharmaparth03> Earth surface receives only 51% of energy radiated by the sun (insolation). Rest 49% is absorbed in the atmosphere of reflected back immediately. Deserts recieve more than 51%. Just imagine 100% of sun's energy (if possible) on earth's surface.

1312143453376057344 2020-10-03 05:32:32 +0800 <sharmaparth03> Was watching UCL draw the other night and the interviewer asked #Kimmich and @DeBruyneKev about their kids, both answered their wife takes care of them and a night before the match they sleep alone. This made me debate about female footballers and athletes. Mad respect for them.
