1343909130554241028 2020-12-29 21:18:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Does it freak #Feminists out when the only way they can open their emails is to recognise they need 'Mail' to look after it and to read it?🤣👍🇬🇧

1343879637454233600 2020-12-29 19:20:48 +0800 <BainzyC> With the ECJ gone, I'd like to see #Boris's plan for the UK LAW and if and what changes he is going/planning to make to it.   There is a once in a nearly 1000 years opportunity for someone to seize a lot of power right now in the UK.  Our own law books open in 2 days!🇬🇧

1343846589115346944 2020-12-29 17:09:28 +0800 <BainzyC> The Race Card is the Joker in the pack, it used to trump every other card but not any more, people don't want to play with it in the pack anymore, it has become unfair for the game.  https://t.co/DO9Znc6Iy6

1343439669699211264 2020-12-28 14:12:31 +0800 <BainzyC> It's all about control, this liar can never tell the truth but tough surveillance is control, they want to watch us because they want to control us.  We can't let this liar anywhere near any control of us, he will sell us out without even blinking.  He is dangerous for the UK.

1343180173169094658 2020-12-27 21:01:23 +0800 <BainzyC> We should work towards that, no EU business from now to then, it's not difficult to buy British and from the rest of the world.
1343178656236109825 2020-12-27 20:55:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Ach aie yer did, yeh wee whippersnapper, Scotland is part of the UK, didnyee knoo!

1343160357691547648 2020-12-27 19:42:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Does anyone really care? The Labour Party doesn't actually do anything except spread hate and division, who the hell needs them?
1343158349202919424 2020-12-27 19:34:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Why is it that these big international institutions and international charities etc attract the foulest of people?🧐🤢🤮🤬

1343144138951294976 2020-12-27 18:38:11 +0800 <BainzyC> They would in a fair world but the world is not fair, only white countries need to be diversified for a reason no one has told or explained to us yet!
1343143546199699459 2020-12-27 18:35:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Well, Doc! Nothing stopping you pissing off elsewhere, or does the draw of the healthy salary our country provides you make your mouth bigger than your convictions?
1343142910477406209 2020-12-27 18:33:18 +0800 <BainzyC> I think it's on Ebay for sale, no takers, no one wants a bus with a giant fishwifes face splattered on it! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍾

It's better when you start to control what you spend your time on and far more interesting when you let your own brain think and feel for you!
1342772461587337218 2020-12-26 18:01:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Do we get a fully restored Common Law system after #Brexit, is that what taking back our laws means?

1341672377541914625 2020-12-23 17:09:56 +0800 <BainzyC> We have other major ports that we have let slip into decline or build massive apartment blocks on, we need to recover them, Southampton and the Solent can expand, Liverpool is great if we get a US deal plus we have numerous others, we are an Island FFS, we can let the ships in.
1341670309049581569 2020-12-23 17:01:43 +0800 <BainzyC> The #ScumMedia won't tell us that, we must learn it by ourselves.

1341664936267755521 2020-12-23 16:40:22 +0800 <BainzyC> It's great to see the British get behind the Sikhs helping out at Dover. Sikhs respect everybody.   If you want to help, nip down to one of their temples, as long as you cover your head when you enter, you will be more than welcome to help them!
1341662302379110400 2020-12-23 16:29:54 +0800 <BainzyC> I have no time for pessimists, spread your pathetic doom and gloom elsewhere, I really detest people like you, you contribute nothing of value to anyone!  #Brexit #NoDealIsTheBestDeal

1341657343700951040 2020-12-23 16:10:12 +0800 <BainzyC> The proper, real version, concerning real everyday people, not those egomaniacs that cry out for attention!
1341656115914956800 2020-12-23 16:05:19 +0800 <BainzyC> The real power in this world need idiots in control, just look who they are trying to instal in the USA!  Look at the way they have treated Trump, not one of their idiots!  That should tell us everything we need to know about who really rules the world.

1341649582837673985 2020-12-23 15:39:21 +0800 <BainzyC> This is what scaremongering does.   UK borders will not be shared in 8 days time thank God.

1341475433292939265 2020-12-23 04:07:21 +0800 <BainzyC> And rightly so, no country in the EU even comes close to😉👊🇬🇧 being as great as the UK, hotter and smellier maybe!
1341474548550610948 2020-12-23 04:03:50 +0800 <BainzyC> C*nt!🤬  @BorisJohnson if, after all these years, you give in to this, then you will never be forgiven, NEVER!
1341473279522050051 2020-12-23 03:58:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Surrendering should come second nature to a froggie president! 👊🤣👊🇬🇧😉
1341472757683515398 2020-12-23 03:56:43 +0800 <BainzyC> #Brexit doesn't truly happen for another 9 days, so unless you have crystals balls, you're talking shite!🤣👊🇬🇧  #GodIsABrexiteer #BrexitParty🎶🍾🤣👍🇬🇧🥃🍺🍾🎶😉
1341450982039937025 2020-12-23 02:30:11 +0800 <BainzyC> It would take you 10 years to read that!🤣👊
1341448336512061440 2020-12-23 02:19:40 +0800 <BainzyC> You are such a nasty guy!🤬
1341447621676773378 2020-12-23 02:16:50 +0800 <BainzyC> If this is true #Boris, you will be one of the most hated men in British History, ever, it will stick to you like shit in hair!  Jimmy Saville will be more popular than you!
1341446657712517120 2020-12-23 02:13:00 +0800 <BainzyC> 😎👍  https://t.co/WX1hVa5RD2
1341443531588681730 2020-12-23 02:00:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Because #ScumMedia had already picked 'Dick of the Year' as the winner.
1341441359748710400 2020-12-23 01:51:57 +0800 <BainzyC> He is envious of the UK, the EU could never achieve what The British Empire did and he knows it!🇬🇧
1341440274166411264 2020-12-23 01:47:38 +0800 <BainzyC> The Labour party reacts like a fart in a wind tunnel!
1341439222834753538 2020-12-23 01:43:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Bring back the ones that came in them too!
1341438896681455616 2020-12-23 01:42:10 +0800 <BainzyC> I have no problem crossing borders, in fact, it's all part of the travelling experience, collecting stamps in your passport is great!
1341432766932652032 2020-12-23 01:17:48 +0800 <BainzyC> I have a unorthodox way but it worked for me
1341357126816559104 2020-12-22 20:17:14 +0800 <BainzyC> #Brexit and how it ends up will define #Boris, if rumours are true, he is going to do the off in Jan.  We will see???
1341313225816743938 2020-12-22 17:22:48 +0800 <BainzyC> It's a global effort that has been planned for a long time!  https://t.co/9yvn4ksyk4
1341312483592691715 2020-12-22 17:19:51 +0800 <BainzyC> I wonder how things would have worked out if Barry had been the bitch? 🤣👍
1341311932704419840 2020-12-22 17:17:39 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1341310736514080768 2020-12-22 17:12:54 +0800 <BainzyC> That won't do!  #Brexit
1341310199483645953 2020-12-22 17:10:46 +0800 <BainzyC> To get that needle in you, there is more in it than we are being told!
1341309975432445958 2020-12-22 17:09:53 +0800 <BainzyC> If Labour were an affective opposition they would be looking at the numbers instead of blustery agreeing and going along with them.  Anyone visiting any hospital can see for themselves that things don't seem to add up, also the testing centres.  None of them can be trusted!🤬
1341307671484502016 2020-12-22 17:00:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Until the Nazis invaded Russia the Russians were neutral, the nazis got the raw materials to bomb the UK from Europe, which it mostly occupied, no one gave them anything, they took it.  What do they teach you over there?🧐
1341246165707329537 2020-12-22 12:56:19 +0800 <BainzyC> They used to be!
1341244416024059904 2020-12-22 12:49:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Someone ought to show her how much icecream she could get for that amount, just to bring her to reality!
1341243540219817986 2020-12-22 12:45:53 +0800 <BainzyC> I would suggest, just for the fun of it, we send frogmen with drills instead to sink them, but the bloody barbarians, if they caught them, would probably eat their legs!🧐🤣👍🇬🇧
1341190378821660672 2020-12-22 09:14:39 +0800 <BainzyC> They are 100% ours, why can't we sell them our fish? We can buy their boats, we have no allegiance to them, we owe them nothing!
1341188506387886081 2020-12-22 09:07:12 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍  https://t.co/XP910mTFaz
1341184839148593152 2020-12-22 08:52:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Thank you! 👍🇬🇧
1341175870178947073 2020-12-22 08:16:59 +0800 <BainzyC> We don't give our history the thought it deserves. If only the #ScumMedia reminded us of the heroes and the zeros of our past, our future generations would have real examples to aspire to or to condemn, instead of the nancy pansies they shove down R throats. They dont deserve us!
1341173846183981060 2020-12-22 08:08:57 +0800 <BainzyC> Her mouth reminds me of Popeye!
1341171024637947904 2020-12-22 07:57:44 +0800 <BainzyC> If I was a girl, I'd be a British cheese kinda girl too! 🤣👍🇬🇧  I like a cheese to bite me back when I bite it, like my girls 😉👍🇬🇧
1341167709644570624 2020-12-22 07:44:34 +0800 <BainzyC> I bought Stilton with apricots today, what a lovely cheese. For 15 years I lived in Gruyeré in Switzerland, everyone ranted and raved over the cheese they make there, personally, I thought it tasted like soap and smelt of cows piss. British cheeses are the best in the world.👍🇬🇧
1341166090072764418 2020-12-22 07:38:08 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍
1341165570260086785 2020-12-22 07:36:04 +0800 <BainzyC> It's very difficult 2 believe a word any politician says anymore.If the government cannot tell that the country is on the brink mentally, it doesn't deserve to govern.What is happening is a very dangerous'I don't give a shit' attitude arising from every demographic, that's scary!
1341164071597584386 2020-12-22 07:30:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Me neither, I'm on a diet!🧐🤣👍
1341159483330994176 2020-12-22 07:11:53 +0800 <BainzyC> If ever there was a revolution in the UK the first thing to go would have to be the #BBC.  Make an example of it so that no #ScumMedia would ever be tolerated in the UK again!
1341157952443592704 2020-12-22 07:05:48 +0800 <BainzyC> You, Sir, are such a bore!
1341113419978715142 2020-12-22 04:08:50 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍
1341101844857294850 2020-12-22 03:22:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Sod off! Go and be a dick somewhere else.
1341097508672581632 2020-12-22 03:05:37 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm a lot worse than you can ever image🤣👊🇬🇧
1341091583274479616 2020-12-22 02:42:04 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't give a fook about your concerns, sod off!
1341087385287864322 2020-12-22 02:25:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Great idea, just to piss remainers off!🤣👍🇬🇧  #GodIsABrexiteer
1341085064084516864 2020-12-22 02:16:10 +0800 <BainzyC> You would not do that if you were brother because you would know from bitter experience that you would be spending Christmas in hospital!🤣👍👊
1341082540011102216 2020-12-22 02:06:08 +0800 <BainzyC> A short and sweet STFU 🤣👍🇬🇧
1341080929457082373 2020-12-22 01:59:44 +0800 <BainzyC> It won't be in my garage anyway, I got wiped out at the auction! I'm looking at a Yankie car now, I can stick 'I love Trump' stickers all over it and drive it around Islington for a laugh!🤣👍🇬🇧
1341078451537801216 2020-12-22 01:49:53 +0800 <BainzyC> That won't concern me for another 10 years, I have a nice red one minus the shit written on it!  By that time we will probably be making them ourselves, the French are not the only ones that can print security items.BTW They R British passports. Sorry for pissing on your bonfire!  https://t.co/484Dg8BaGK
1341045180753993729 2020-12-21 23:37:41 +0800 <BainzyC> It wouldn't bother her, she died last year &amp; I don't give a shit, so feel better, knobhead?
1341044017576996865 2020-12-21 23:33:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Not likely, I like the old colour with the shit taken off!🤣🇬🇧  https://t.co/cObg040sue
1341041326327013378 2020-12-21 23:22:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Cheers Sydney!🍾👍🇬🇧
1341040643272007685 2020-12-21 23:19:39 +0800 <BainzyC> I see that the 'losers' have begun bedwetting over this post, so pathetic the lot of them 🤣👍🇬🇧  Hay losers, are you all getting ready for your #BrexitParty in 10 days?  I'll be drinking some lovely British Sparkling wine, pissing myself laughing over your loss! #HappyBrexit! 🍾
1341038953282060288 2020-12-21 23:12:56 +0800 <BainzyC> This did make me laugh!🤣👍🇬🇧  https://t.co/Eqo064lnEY
1341034846534184961 2020-12-21 22:56:37 +0800 <BainzyC> And you'd be right, I was, but I was a patriotic, ungrateful c**t, and he was a silly twat sending it to me knowing how I felt about the EU. 😉👍🇬🇧
1341029252184076294 2020-12-21 22:34:23 +0800 <BainzyC> In 2016 when we won #Brexit I was so, so happy, then the #Remainers started their hate of #Brexit campaign, filling us with fear etc.  But one of their questions got me, that was 'How is the country going to benefit, what is in it for you?'.  I've been working on a project. #Soon  https://t.co/Ot8nWLIwnk
1341026379639492612 2020-12-21 22:22:58 +0800 <BainzyC> That will hopefully get them to question the unelected cabal that rules over them!  We will see them coming to the UK to buy cars from us, happy dayz!🇬🇧👍
1341015410846687237 2020-12-21 21:39:23 +0800 <BainzyC> 2020 has proven that we Brits. can take turbulence and more!👍🇬🇧
1341014898239782913 2020-12-21 21:37:21 +0800 <BainzyC> 😉👍🇬🇧🍾
1341014357648551938 2020-12-21 21:35:12 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍  https://t.co/Yqyx5EyM99
1341009695507673090 2020-12-21 21:16:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Shop for Britain! 🇬🇧👍
1341009083734876163 2020-12-21 21:14:14 +0800 <BainzyC> I enjoy the chase, now I have discovered a snipeing tool, I'll enjoy it more!
1341007788873543680 2020-12-21 21:09:06 +0800 <BainzyC> #Boris has held strong so far, I just pray he doesn't cave in at the last moment and do the off, leaving us in it!
1341007240543801347 2020-12-21 21:06:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Poo sums that up!🤣👍🇬🇧
1341006956098666497 2020-12-21 21:05:47 +0800 <BainzyC> The #Brexiteers will have to eat the #Remainers when we run out of food, seeing as they don't like Plague Island, they won't be a loss! I know they will be tasteless and hard to stomach but we #Brexiteers are a resourceful bunch and will do it for the good of our great islands!🇬🇧
1341005801515864064 2020-12-21 21:01:12 +0800 <BainzyC> I thought he found a #Brexiteer dentist who modelled his teeth around Stonehenge whilst he was gassed out! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1340998662068027392 2020-12-21 20:32:50 +0800 <BainzyC> at 17.33 I might too! 😉👍🇬🇧
1340992931109478401 2020-12-21 20:10:03 +0800 <BainzyC> That's a sport, I think I might bid on it!
1340989983092576256 2020-12-21 19:58:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Not for me thank you, but I will share it, maybe someone I share it to will want to buy it?
1340987330400759809 2020-12-21 19:47:48 +0800 <BainzyC> My favourite, nowhere in the world can they match the taste of it sold in our Chippys, many try, they all fail!
1340986719886331904 2020-12-21 19:45:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Future classics! I do love Jags, I've had a few in the past, but the main reason I buy them is that they are British, they haven't sold out like other tasty brands. 🇬🇧
1340983703678402560 2020-12-21 19:33:23 +0800 <BainzyC> You are not wrong there, jokers and losers!
1340980974348349441 2020-12-21 19:22:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Talking of ways to sell, how about this, you list an item for sale, you offer a 10% commission, then you say to the world buy that or find someone to buy it, someone comes along, cant buy it shares to his M8 &amp; his M8 does. You, the sharer and the buyer share the 10%, Y or N? (c)
1340979717932003334 2020-12-21 19:17:33 +0800 <BainzyC> That's the beauty of selling at auction, it can also work the other way, I paid £0.5 the other day for a £100+ item, I was happy!😉👍  An item is worth what someone is prepared to pay for it, setting prices takes the fun out of buying, we all love to barter a bit or get a deal!
1340979074387210240 2020-12-21 19:15:00 +0800 <BainzyC> It's on offer today!! 😉👍🇬🇧
1340977943523299330 2020-12-21 19:10:30 +0800 <BainzyC> I have been doing that but I always seem to be beaten, maybe others use software, anyway, today I found some and have put in an offer that will take them all out!  I will see at 17.33 today if it worked 😉👍
1340974726500462598 2020-12-21 18:57:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes or no?  It's British!🇬🇧  https://t.co/ik84LeVg5B
1340973907545894912 2020-12-21 18:54:28 +0800 <BainzyC> I started that about 10 years ago, I only buy British or rest of the world, I don't touch anything from the #EU.  My brother sent me some French wine for Christmas last week, I sent it back, he called me an ungrateful c**t! 😉👍🇬🇧🍾
1340969672817127424 2020-12-21 18:37:38 +0800 <BainzyC> 300 bottles of English Sparkling Wine for me please, put it on my tab!😎👍🇬🇧🍾
1340968601822621696 2020-12-21 18:33:23 +0800 <BainzyC> It's no joke anymore!
1340968465398697986 2020-12-21 18:32:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Well said and very true!
1340967586922688514 2020-12-21 18:29:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Looks a bit like me that guy! 👍😎👍🇬🇧
1340967313588310016 2020-12-21 18:28:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Has anyone had any experience using sniping software on Ebay?  I'm cheesed off with little sneaks coming in at the last second!
1340965981154385920 2020-12-21 18:22:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Great, I won't have to sell the pig then! 🤣👍
1340965633685655558 2020-12-21 18:21:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Castro's bastard son is destroying Canada, trying to make it the same as Cuba!
1340965032482512898 2020-12-21 18:19:12 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🍾
1340964313926909959 2020-12-21 18:16:21 +0800 <BainzyC> There is a message in there, £10 if you can crack it! 😎👍
1340964055159324678 2020-12-21 18:15:19 +0800 <BainzyC> I've got news for you, you unpatriotic mess, your beloved #EU doesn't want you, they have blockaded all Brits. 🤣👍🇬🇧  Bang your head against the wall to knock some sense into it and get ready to #BrexitParty in 10 days!😎🍾🎶🇬🇧
1340963099134881793 2020-12-21 18:11:31 +0800 <BainzyC> The Swiss our friends, they are a bit weird, but #Brexit friendly!
1340962273641320448 2020-12-21 18:08:14 +0800 <BainzyC> You are not. Thank God!
1340947850608439296 2020-12-21 17:10:55 +0800 <BainzyC> #LBC radio, what has happened to that?  What a load of shite it has become, I used to like listening to that!🤬
1340946506774409216 2020-12-21 17:05:35 +0800 <BainzyC> The #UK has a message to give the #EU   Fook Off!  Can someone with balls please deliver it? 🤬🇬🇧👊
1340945310579892224 2020-12-21 17:00:50 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm surprised it wasn't BLM!🤬
1340943711065280512 2020-12-21 16:54:28 +0800 <BainzyC> I better start catching pigeons then 😉👍🇬🇧
1340942776398188545 2020-12-21 16:50:46 +0800 <BainzyC> I think our historical ties to India are stronger than the #EU's they still think very highly of the British.
1340942225174310912 2020-12-21 16:48:34 +0800 <BainzyC> How will rebels communicate if the shit hits the fan?  All unauthorised movement and gatherings will be banned.  The only way left will be online, and that will all be monitored.  Anyone got any pigeons??
1340941367636332544 2020-12-21 16:45:10 +0800 <BainzyC> If those Great Reset crazies get their way there will no longer be political parties &amp; there will be no #Brexit, just global medical martial law.  Everyone will be given a set amount of money to live on &amp; for that, we will be told what we must do to earn it!  Is there a way out?
1340940173392175105 2020-12-21 16:40:25 +0800 <BainzyC> X2lq+2YRUnZ3V2sOFohEmbAp/WB9vx/9goASSTHCQUyKz3hh7WKbziKgY7mdZsDWGA7sXLawfJn5plkpMbgbNg==?
1340935020370915328 2020-12-21 16:19:56 +0800 <BainzyC> COVID - TRUMP - BREXIT All linked I think, they are using COVID to try and stop Trump and Brexit, we must not give in in these final days, they are ruthless.  Next month will be the most important month for the world since the end of WW2, a New Trump and a New UK? Or DISASTERS?
1340933386425266177 2020-12-21 16:13:27 +0800 <BainzyC> I reckon I should give the gym a miss for a few days 🤣👍  https://t.co/2RUkALqrBB
1340931727645143044 2020-12-21 16:06:51 +0800 <BainzyC> More stringing out announced this morning FFS, they are a bunch of clowns, wasting time!
1340917075443933185 2020-12-21 15:08:38 +0800 <BainzyC> We can use this experience 2 test how they will react if #Brexit talks dont go their way, we should B calling on our world partners now 2 keep the flow of food.  A free trial run, let's get on with it, I think this is a blessing in disguise, prove we dont need the EU for anything
1340915156910559232 2020-12-21 15:01:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Hopefully, his opinion won't matter, he should end his days in prison for treason
1340829112286531588 2020-12-21 09:19:06 +0800 <BainzyC> They can't completely control you if you do that!
1340828425125244928 2020-12-21 09:16:22 +0800 <BainzyC> No, he never, he denied that, an x advisor suggested it! More shit from #ScumMedia

1340798371800502273 2020-12-21 07:16:57 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1340798195887202306 2020-12-21 07:16:15 +0800 <BainzyC> During mass interruption #Brexit could not come at a better time, when the interruption and the chaos it causes end we will heal the #Brexit way.  COVID is a Godsend for #Brexit, it has proven that the UK can still run despite the most serious interruptions, we are resilient!👍🇬🇧
1340796943967154180 2020-12-21 07:11:16 +0800 <BainzyC> They did a CV test on a glass of Coca Cola, it proved positive?
1340796638621777922 2020-12-21 07:10:04 +0800 <BainzyC> 👍
1340796044674818051 2020-12-21 07:07:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Eastbourne, you'll get that, Sovereign Harbour.
1340791801574285313 2020-12-21 06:50:50 +0800 <BainzyC> When you go to jail for treason?
1340791570652688396 2020-12-21 06:49:55 +0800 <BainzyC> But, but....They said they would never do that?? 🧐  On the sweet side, how they handle this now will be a great test of how we can do it in the future, an unexpected dry run 👍🤣🇬🇧🍾
1340778787391361032 2020-12-21 05:59:08 +0800 <BainzyC> The #ScumMedia directs the narrative!
1340777785476984839 2020-12-21 05:55:09 +0800 <BainzyC> Stuffing a turkey is more fun than stuffing a vegan! 🤣👍
1340777080619986945 2020-12-21 05:52:21 +0800 <BainzyC> It won't change #Brexit, too late for that!
1340772946617483266 2020-12-21 05:35:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Our fish, our money, we want it all!
1340772014131470341 2020-12-21 05:32:13 +0800 <BainzyC> The cost to the world over COVID does not matter, the more it is the better it is for the planners, the more it is the more their intervention will be required.  The present system with its impossible to pay debt was unsustainable anyway, spend what you can whilst you can!
1340771269634093063 2020-12-21 05:29:15 +0800 <BainzyC> I think their 'New Strain' story has backfired very badly! Who will carry the can for this one?
1340770817513312262 2020-12-21 05:27:27 +0800 <BainzyC> I hope he returns with an empty folder!
1340769665832939523 2020-12-21 05:22:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Isn't it more viable we just all get it?  The country is so pissed off scared of living, risking death is more favourable!  We risk death every time we eat, every time we leave our homes, life is a risk, we are used to them.
1340766363451797506 2020-12-21 05:09:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Crying out for attention I guess!
1340766162574041091 2020-12-21 05:08:58 +0800 <BainzyC> You must have lived a sheltered life Tania 🤣👍🇬🇧🍾
1340765877684367361 2020-12-21 05:07:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Yeah, Ping Pong Cheong!
1340758882554142723 2020-12-21 04:40:02 +0800 <BainzyC> A good #Brexit start, now let's move on without them trying to stop us, a blessing in disguise!
1340758039738126338 2020-12-21 04:36:41 +0800 <BainzyC> The Express is full of shite, they have spewed headlines like this every day for years! #ScumMedia
1340756648437149696 2020-12-21 04:31:09 +0800 <BainzyC> And stick to your own bloody language too!
1340756545584455680 2020-12-21 04:30:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Those clothes you are wearing and that hairstyle look western, WTF are you doing culturally appropriating our stuff? Hypocrite.
1340749828222021639 2020-12-21 04:04:03 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧 Normally I'm a pheasant plucker!
1340741388426764289 2020-12-21 03:30:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Shagging it is fine, just a sexual preference, who doesn't like to shag a bird? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1340735108140179471 2020-12-21 03:05:34 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🍾
1340734555205066753 2020-12-21 03:03:22 +0800 <BainzyC> #BLM or #BlackLivesMatter do NOT matter, black people do!
1340733812200890370 2020-12-21 03:00:25 +0800 <BainzyC> The past, or the 'Old Normal', will gradually be erased from history, those that try to remind or resurrect it, will soon be silenced or erased themselves!
1340731955520950273 2020-12-21 02:53:02 +0800 <BainzyC> OK
1340729029238939648 2020-12-21 02:41:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Too late! 😉👍🇬🇧
1340728378308091909 2020-12-21 02:38:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Je sais que «merde» est le nom français et suisse de l'herbe, mais notre public est principalement anglais!  J'aurais aimé pouvoir fermer les yeux parfois, ils en ont trop vu! 😉👍🇬🇧
1340726363792297986 2020-12-21 02:30:49 +0800 <BainzyC> @DonaldJTrumpJr I doubt you answer all of your tweets that are directed at you but I have a question I pray you to answer please. Before your father ran for president did he have a family meeting warning All The Trump Family of the bad that would be directed at you all?#Important

1340672065159000064 2020-12-20 22:55:03 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't know any leaver that would vote to now remain, but I do know many remainers that would now vote to leave!
1340671767224979456 2020-12-20 22:53:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Always buy British, keep our money in house!
1340671148112097282 2020-12-20 22:51:24 +0800 <BainzyC> I would not let it in!
1340669079900839936 2020-12-20 22:43:11 +0800 <BainzyC> They are prepared for it now, the benefits system has recently been renamed Universal Credit in preparation for when it goes mainstream.
1340667977348354050 2020-12-20 22:38:48 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍 You need one in reserve, you never want to be called chinless!
1340666908480315393 2020-12-20 22:34:34 +0800 <BainzyC> My grandfather passed that spirit to me and I passed it to my kids, never give up, never surrender and make the most of everything because we never know when it will end!  God Save The Queen!  https://t.co/Dwek5bHLEA
1340665909686521857 2020-12-20 22:30:35 +0800 <BainzyC> So, what will be the outcome? Those running could spread it worse than it would have been if things were left as they were!  They really do not think these things through do they?
1340664489100894211 2020-12-20 22:24:57 +0800 <BainzyC> That don't teach that these days, they are told to believe what they are taught and nothing else, such a waste of brain power!
1340663912786763778 2020-12-20 22:22:39 +0800 <BainzyC> That will do! 😉👍
1340663710864584710 2020-12-20 22:21:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Non monsieur, vous devez faire tester vos yeux!

1340636741959606277 2020-12-20 20:34:41 +0800 <BainzyC> Gloating is a really bad thing and should not be allowed on social media..... BUT..... Since it is......  I'm just off to the gym, after which I'm off to the pub to put it all back on again.... It's a wonderful life in tier 2 🤣👍🇬🇧
1340635436763525120 2020-12-20 20:29:30 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍
1340631707268091905 2020-12-20 20:14:41 +0800 <BainzyC> So it's a life giver? 🤣👍
1340631557816672257 2020-12-20 20:14:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Complete bullshit, hospitals don't send dead people home, funeral parlours do if they do, and that's in a wooden overcoat!

1340625911285227522 2020-12-20 19:51:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Let them laugh! It's not your job to convince people, once you make them aware your job is done... Leading a horse to water and all that!!!
1340625556015099904 2020-12-20 19:50:14 +0800 <BainzyC> No, a new bath! 😉

I will speak to him tomorrow, I'll ask him for pics

1340503821974441986 2020-12-20 11:46:31 +0800 <BainzyC> It's stronger than that, its state reliance, some just cant believe that the people who rule them might just be telling fibs, despite history being written on the basis of lies told by their rulers. Iraq is a typical example, we knew it was all lies yet the Liars are still walk.
1340502636857085952 2020-12-20 11:41:48 +0800 <BainzyC> The French have always been our M8s haven't they?  Except when it comes to war of course, then they just make white flags and give their guns to the enemy.  Brits are not afraid of the French. 🇬🇧
1340501180863164417 2020-12-20 11:36:01 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't think Taiwan would agree with you there!

1340498034166214656 2020-12-20 11:23:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Some people just cannot, they are so conditioned to dispel anything apart from what they are told, brainwashing washes, it's difficult to almost impossible to break that conditioning, no matter if you have undeniable facts.

1340407262091862018 2020-12-20 05:22:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Again and again, we are told it's not as bad as they say but we all still go along with it, when I say 'They' I mean the scientists, the experts at the CDC etc.  We are well and truly f**ked!  https://t.co/D9L0ylm3AC

1340398729661177858 2020-12-20 04:48:55 +0800 <BainzyC> I like her, I think she is restricted by circumstances, I remain loyal to friends, I won't bad mouth her!
1340398428971515907 2020-12-20 04:47:43 +0800 <BainzyC> @Bobilly10 The world is an insane place to be in right now, more dangerous than open warfare, our silent enemy is all powerful and intent on stealing everything!
1340393012803809282 2020-12-20 04:26:12 +0800 <BainzyC> How dare they!!! Could you just imagine? 🤢🤮
1340392836299169794 2020-12-20 04:25:30 +0800 <BainzyC> But DESPERATION? 🤣👍🍺
1340392073862795264 2020-12-20 04:22:28 +0800 <BainzyC> I bloody hope not, he has been very active on the world stage recently, I don't know who it will be but it will be some worshipful master from somewhere, being groomed to take over all!
1340390928817778688 2020-12-20 04:17:55 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't think even #Boris could sink that low, I mean, that mouth, you'd pop yer willy in it and you'd think Popeye was munching on it! 🤣👍🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺
1340390114313314313 2020-12-20 04:14:41 +0800 <BainzyC> Or one name on the ballot paper, the new Man-God, they want to install! One World leader.
1340388497853722628 2020-12-20 04:08:15 +0800 <BainzyC> The #EU are hinting at more extensions, I think one more + COVID would be the straw that broke the camel's back, already the country is fuming, an extension could cause it to go up in flames! #Brexit
1340387626910670850 2020-12-20 04:04:48 +0800 <BainzyC> Kick me if I'm wrong, but I don't think things will be anything like the past as we knew it in 5 years, including elections, I think the globalists would be settled in by then!
1340387133245177856 2020-12-20 04:02:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Wasn't she just awful? We don't need ratbags like her in days like these, we want to see and hear nice people.
1340386758563950595 2020-12-20 04:01:21 +0800 <BainzyC> It's a hard job being a monarch, she doesn't use money and her houses are usually dank and damp because they are so old.  Things are just things, jewels are just jewels, to her they are just part of her work uniform!
1340383631420878849 2020-12-20 03:48:55 +0800 <BainzyC> If Christmas has been cancelled, do you think I could a refund for all my families presents from Poundland? 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1340373698008805379 2020-12-20 03:09:27 +0800 <BainzyC> I have been looking for something for ages and have just spotted it on Ebay ending in 4 hours for £0.50p, I was going to spend at least a £100 for it. Fingers crossed no one sneaks in and nicks it!!
1340372902894579718 2020-12-20 03:06:17 +0800 <BainzyC> That was me 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1340372377084043266 2020-12-20 03:04:12 +0800 <BainzyC> The NEW SANTA gifting you throughout 2021  https://t.co/mi8ALcdPYh
1340371519311138818 2020-12-20 03:00:47 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't like it when I follow someone back and get an immediate DM from them trying to flog me something, it's rather rude I think!🧐
1340367483300179968 2020-12-20 02:44:45 +0800 <BainzyC> I sprained my thumb in Switzerland, they took an Xray and 3D printed me a brace, it took about 35 minutes, one that fitted me perfectly.
1340367037558906882 2020-12-20 02:42:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Why has the Home Office finally pulled their heads out of their arses and they are going to start to deport illegals?
1340356981555654665 2020-12-20 02:03:01 +0800 <BainzyC> I saw it, they don't want more than 500 million people on the planet, everyone else is surplus to requirements!  I pity the ones that will have to clear up the mess!
1340351749576658944 2020-12-20 01:42:14 +0800 <BainzyC> The great reset loonie mentioned worse, he said there would be a global attack on the internet, it would disrupt everything, he mentioned it would cause a global food shortage.
1340351317554958336 2020-12-20 01:40:31 +0800 <BainzyC> It's all very sad, I knew it was coming but I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime, I'm not sure it's escapable unless you're on a boat somewhere, but where is the fun there?  South America is about the only place I can think of where you could live off the land without fear!
1340345154553716742 2020-12-20 01:16:01 +0800 <BainzyC> It's already happened, what they will do as time goes on is enforce it more, the one way walking in shops, the 2M, no cash, no alcohol, no church, no property, no travel, no cars. They want us to have nothing, bit by bit they'll take it until their plan is complete! #Globally
1340343974649884673 2020-12-20 01:11:20 +0800 <BainzyC> This is what they want, someone called it out the other day for what it will become, Medical Martial Law!  Vaccines for everything!
1340342621391237123 2020-12-20 01:05:57 +0800 <BainzyC> Will he drop a #Brexit bomb and do one as Cameron did?
1340342087007518728 2020-12-20 01:03:50 +0800 <BainzyC> I do, he smells! 🤢🤮🤣
1340341837035425793 2020-12-20 01:02:50 +0800 <BainzyC> @robertl35261487 Cheeky fooker keeps arguing with me, last time we nearly came to blows!!!🧐👊
1340341138654412801 2020-12-20 01:00:04 +0800 <BainzyC> I might just end up with a litre of voddie and drink with that handsome chap that lives in my mirror! 🤣👍🇬🇧🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃🥃
1340339407820349440 2020-12-20 00:53:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Oxford still in tier 2, now I must try and find 5 Unwoke Wankers to have a piss up with 🤣👍🇬🇧🍾
1340330842405675008 2020-12-20 00:19:09 +0800 <BainzyC> #Boris is stuffing Christmas and New Years Eve/#Brexit Eve as I write!
1340308376081866752 2020-12-19 22:49:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Something is very wrong with the London Police!
1340307442920525824 2020-12-19 22:46:10 +0800 <BainzyC> How could she say that with a straight face?
1340306725702934528 2020-12-19 22:43:19 +0800 <BainzyC> COVID revisited 2021, they will make that more scary, funny enough, the vaccine works on that one too, conveniently!
1340306170259656704 2020-12-19 22:41:07 +0800 <BainzyC> We need 100% of all that is in our waters, then we can license EU trawlers to fish, that's the way business works when letting another entity make use of an asset!
1340305442371743744 2020-12-19 22:38:13 +0800 <BainzyC> Not forgetting the £39 billion they want as a divorce settlement, which is a complete shambles, we should be getting out money we put in!
1340304890447409152 2020-12-19 22:36:02 +0800 <BainzyC> It's quite possible now with today's tech. you could control them with a mobile phone, not that you need to control them, you can equip them with AI, they can seek and find.
1340266647135936512 2020-12-19 20:04:04 +0800 <BainzyC> They don't need nukes to wipe out cities, nukes are so last decade, especially when they have these   https://t.co/O4aihRmVCo  No need to harm any infrastructure or have any human collateral damage!
1340265324478906368 2020-12-19 19:58:48 +0800 <BainzyC> This should help him get his Equity card!
1340264933834043392 2020-12-19 19:57:15 +0800 <BainzyC> @wiganwoody @OutragedOf We CAN do it!
1340262553205796870 2020-12-19 19:47:48 +0800 <BainzyC> I think most of them did celebrate those holidays, they just didn't advertise it or make a big deal out of it as our Anti-Christian #ScumMedia has!
1340261964124139526 2020-12-19 19:45:27 +0800 <BainzyC> Look what AD twitter put under your post!  https://t.co/3cIT6JxPvE
1340260931251671040 2020-12-19 19:41:21 +0800 <BainzyC> The Kenwood? 🤣👍
1340260720341086209 2020-12-19 19:40:31 +0800 <BainzyC> There are plenty of them about!
1340260384121491456 2020-12-19 19:39:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Now you have an electric woman in the kitchen, do you really need the wife? 🤣👍🇬🇧🍾
1340259973989879808 2020-12-19 19:37:33 +0800 <BainzyC> We won't know until Dawn French sings!
1340259029503905792 2020-12-19 19:33:48 +0800 <BainzyC> I can imagine Guy Whatevertwat acting like that 🤣👍🇬🇧  https://t.co/HQQejr3bQa
1340257507785228292 2020-12-19 19:27:45 +0800 <BainzyC> If the truth be known 'tiers' is just another word for 'tears', because that's what they cause!  Nothing is by mistake, it's all by design!
1340256920125513730 2020-12-19 19:25:25 +0800 <BainzyC>  https://t.co/0VWZlzJbdk
1340255867552346112 2020-12-19 19:21:14 +0800 <BainzyC> We had to do them on a blackboard when I was a kid, I got caned for designing a multi chalk holding device out of rulers, pencils and rubber bands so I could do 4 lines at once!   If you made one mistake the sadists would just rub them all out and make you do it again!
1340254789729447937 2020-12-19 19:16:57 +0800 <BainzyC> The nutter behind the great reset said in the new year anyone who is not vaccinated will not get the processed, plant-based food supplied by the government.Apparently, the world is going to run out of food in early 2021 and rations will be the only way we can eat.They told us so!
1340253942966595584 2020-12-19 19:13:35 +0800 <BainzyC> #Boris himself recovered without a vaccine too, apparently, he suffered more, because he is a fat lazy sod!
1340253219428118528 2020-12-19 19:10:42 +0800 <BainzyC> That will come as all meat, they are trying that now, apparently animals create too much Co2 and it's bad for global warming, like all life on Earth now!
1340247065214017536 2020-12-19 18:46:15 +0800 <BainzyC> It has crossed my mind, Islamification, bit by bit, the churches burning, the pubs closing down, covering up our faces, cancelling Christmas (the main Christian holiday) all beneficial to islam.I've been out of the UK for 15 years, I notice it more than most I think, I'm shocked!
1340245952330936320 2020-12-19 18:41:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Asian Mayors have seized control of most of the country via local government!  How did we allow this to happen?  Maybe their numbers are far, far more than we are told?  If you walk down any high street in the UK it feels that there are very few white people left, EVERYWHERE!
1340245176770551808 2020-12-19 18:38:45 +0800 <BainzyC>  https://t.co/5x3HXi0Be0
1340239822905094145 2020-12-19 18:17:28 +0800 <BainzyC> After 01.01.21 we must relish our sovereignty and never, ever let it be shamed again.  Great Britain is GREAT for a reason, the GREAT people that live on our islands, we must stop people putting us down, restore optimism and dispel the negative narrative that poisons our airways!
1340238750488670208 2020-12-19 18:13:13 +0800 <BainzyC> Ca Ching! 🤢🤮🤬
1340237908855435265 2020-12-19 18:09:52 +0800 <BainzyC> They are running scared, you can hear the fear in his voice!  Bloody love it! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍾

1340231183511281665 2020-12-19 17:43:09 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm waiting for someone to pick me up on my Isle of White post next! 🤣👍🇬🇧  I like setting twatter traps, it pleases my little mind 🤯🤣👍
1340225401029857280 2020-12-19 17:20:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Of course, I do, I live in Oxford!🤣👍
1340211369250091017 2020-12-19 16:24:25 +0800 <BainzyC> I think all psychiatric patients should be allowed out for Christmas, even these 3 nutters!
1340210360461242368 2020-12-19 16:20:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Many people think that it's not the vaccine that world governments what to put in us but something in it that is vital for their nefarious plans for the human race, that makes more sense than a killer cold!🧐
1340209336367386624 2020-12-19 16:16:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Allowing people like you to give their own personal opinion about a nation suffering is irresponsible and an abdication of authority by a nation's people to muzzle the idiots within it! #MerryChristmas #BrexitParty #HappyNewyear #PartyEveryoneItsChristmas #DieHappyIfYouMust!
1340207819853864961 2020-12-19 16:10:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Just in time to sink froggie trawlers nicking our fish!😉👍🇬🇧
1340207358413328384 2020-12-19 16:08:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Something very bad!
1340077705975443459 2020-12-19 07:33:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Did you miss it?  The world ended in September!😉👍🇬🇧
1340076580589154304 2020-12-19 07:28:48 +0800 <BainzyC> The BBC only keeps relics on if they sell their souls to them, he is as funny as a dose of COVID!
1340075673369632768 2020-12-19 07:25:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Écoutez mon ami `` froggie '', vous ne pouvez avoir aucun de nos poissons sans payer avec eux, nous pouvons si vous le souhaitez, vous laisser quelques coquilles gratuites si vous entrez dans nos eaux, de super gros obus de 50 mm gracieuseté de The Royal Marine!🇬🇧😎👍
1340074664769572867 2020-12-19 07:21:12 +0800 <BainzyC> But we can fu*king sell them to you, muppet!!!🤣👍🇬🇧
1340072627600297987 2020-12-19 07:13:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Lambs to the slaughter!
1340072366655860736 2020-12-19 07:12:04 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm glad they didn't!👍🇬🇧👍🍺
1340071634582069250 2020-12-19 07:09:09 +0800 <BainzyC> That's a crime, isn't it?
1340068999619616768 2020-12-19 06:58:41 +0800 <BainzyC> He deserves a lot worse!
1340068703577264129 2020-12-19 06:57:30 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1340052664399368193 2020-12-19 05:53:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Whitehall must be living up to its name then!🤣👍🇬🇧  FFS.... Can't you do anything constructive woman?
1340051088049926147 2020-12-19 05:47:30 +0800 <BainzyC> I just retweet, I must have some sick followers or I follow some nut cases 🤣👍
1340049928752689152 2020-12-19 05:42:54 +0800 <BainzyC> British Fish #Boris, never stop reminding them of that!

1340044873475502082 2020-12-19 05:22:49 +0800 <BainzyC> MP expenses I expect, Labour-run shitholes are expensive to live in, security is not cheap!
1340044368196087810 2020-12-19 05:20:48 +0800 <BainzyC> It will have a scary name, I bet!
1340041537267372033 2020-12-19 05:09:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Have you ever heard that the UK is a country that exercises freedom?   If you are so scared of COVID, there is a vaccine for it now, take it and let others live the lives they want or die the way they want to. If God calls, we must all answer him, like it or not!
1340040390246866947 2020-12-19 05:05:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Sounds like someone's paying Yang for his Ying!
1340038276921626627 2020-12-19 04:56:36 +0800 <BainzyC> M8s World!
1340037917599739905 2020-12-19 04:55:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Rightly so, you treacherous dog!
1340037471254540288 2020-12-19 04:53:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Ewwww! 🤢🤮😷
1340036718112718849 2020-12-19 04:50:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Big #Brexit Ben tolls for the demise of the #EU!
1340035607389761537 2020-12-19 04:46:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Since COVID if we believe what we are told, the NHS is getting so much more these days!
1340033353626624010 2020-12-19 04:37:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Necause they have nothing to say, everything that could be said has been said!
1340031531121831937 2020-12-19 04:29:48 +0800 <BainzyC> We want the right to have guns in the UK, who took them from us?
1340030901716172800 2020-12-19 04:27:18 +0800 <BainzyC> 'Spidey senses' little fat boy?
1340030051342049285 2020-12-19 04:23:55 +0800 <BainzyC> COVID cured it, isn't that obvious?🧐

1339979595391660039 2020-12-19 01:03:25 +0800 <BainzyC> The last one, is that a French one?  'Hands up and surrender'? 🇬🇧🤣👍
1339979193384353792 2020-12-19 01:01:49 +0800 <BainzyC> The world is waiting for Trump to finish his mission in 2024, then he can retire, not that he will, but we will let him, retire in a far better USA and a far better world! @realDonaldTrump
1339978039208386563 2020-12-19 00:57:14 +0800 <BainzyC> ANOTHER ONE! I have been sharing tweets that show personalities getting jabbed with the virus vaccine, but in reality, like this one, they are all fake. They are spending a fortune on getting whatever is in that vaccine into everyone, it'll B mandatory very soon, just wait &amp; see!
1339976794297016326 2020-12-19 00:52:17 +0800 <BainzyC> The Manchester Police Farce has finally been taken to task for not doing its tasks. At last!
1339975153632104448 2020-12-19 00:45:46 +0800 <BainzyC> I can't get my lazy ass motivated to go to the gym today, the lure of the beef casserole I'm slow cooking is just making me want to crack open a bottle of red.  It's Christmas, by next year we'll all be dead or juiced up on vaccine I doubt I will need to be fit.  Wine it is then!
1339974041927618563 2020-12-19 00:41:21 +0800 <BainzyC> To be candid Godfrey, I'm not really an energy guy, I just read an interesting article on a new type of array that Tesla was working on, it seemed to me, to be far more effective and efficent.
1339973200776728576 2020-12-19 00:38:01 +0800 <BainzyC> They don't know the meaning of a level playing field, unless it tilts their way, it's not level!
1339972830272864256 2020-12-19 00:36:32 +0800 <BainzyC> @PDevonian Last year someone sent me back the wife, but not the bow, that was expensive that bow!😉🇬🇧👍🤣
1339972089420365824 2020-12-19 00:33:36 +0800 <BainzyC> The dumb leading the dumber! Uncle #Soros has her back though, unlike the millions she deludes!
1339967653155319809 2020-12-19 00:15:58 +0800 <BainzyC> We all know what to do then? Request one!
1339967204780064773 2020-12-19 00:14:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Sorry Guy Whatevertwat, or whatever you call yourself, its the stinking attitude that you display in this speech which is why the #EU is so shit for the #UK. Mark my words, it will be #EuropeanYouth that will want a taste of #UK freedom once we take advantage of independent trade
1339965564643643393 2020-12-19 00:07:40 +0800 <BainzyC> The old designs were clumsy &amp; expensive, new machines with vertical blades set in particular arrays arent just far more cost &amp; efficiency effective, their movements create air movements that give energy to other machines in the same array, close 2 perpetual motion once started!
1339961750779813888 2020-12-18 23:52:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Do not be fooled! The British still have many friends leftover from our Empire days, the only ones that don't seem to like us are some of the ones that came to the UK, those who are trying to destroy us from within, Marxist Globalists, flogging hate and fake racism!🇬🇧👍 #WakeUp
1339959721118363650 2020-12-18 23:44:27 +0800 <BainzyC> I will stand by a Sikh, the Sikhs stood and died side by side with The British!👍🇬🇧
1339959182825566209 2020-12-18 23:42:19 +0800 <BainzyC> This would help #Brexiteers no end! 👍🇬🇧
1339863800573538304 2020-12-18 17:23:18 +0800 <BainzyC> I reckon when they bring about this 'Great Reset' we will get a world council, 1 that will exist of 144,000 people. That number keeps coming up, even in ADs on the radio, its subtle but its there.They using The Bible or parts of it as a 'blueprint' making it come true, their way!
1339862089326862337 2020-12-18 17:16:30 +0800 <BainzyC> 2 fu*king right, being able 2 defend oneself verbally is essential 2 ward off violence or flipping out. We R beginning 2 see, people going crazy because they get frustrated, unable 2 say what they really want 2 say 2 stop offending people, instead, they offend themselves!
1339682930277425160 2020-12-18 05:24:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Apple's new IOS Big Sur?  Yes or no?
1339680662060732417 2020-12-18 05:15:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Another 1, I don't know how many videos I've seen of high up people showboating themselves, only to see the cap on, the syringe empty or something else equally fraudulent. THIS IS GETTING BLOODY SCARY FOLKS, WHATEVER THEY ARE PUTTING INTO THE SYRINGE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY BAD INDEED!
1339678107528249344 2020-12-18 05:05:25 +0800 <BainzyC> I've had an idea about how to stop the invaders from Calais, simple, we became invaders ourselves, we get loads of aeroplanes, ships &amp; that &amp; just go invade Normandy, they did it to us, only fair, plus we get Calais, no more invaders, we just tow them to international waters!🧐🇬🇧
1339676467643473923 2020-12-18 04:58:54 +0800 <BainzyC> Is this the first rat to desert the COVID ship?  Why would anyone sell stock of what is potentially one of the hottest in history?  What does the CEO of Pfizer know? Does he know it's a killer so he wants out before it starts to kill? Or has he got a conscience? #CautionMankind!
1339674589543223297 2020-12-18 04:51:26 +0800 <BainzyC> @goodnitebob @davidbent1948 I have an awful sinking feeling that #Boris &amp; Co are no longer in charge, in fact, I don't think they have been in charge all this year. Dark forces are moving rapidly in the shadows, preparing to lift the veil so that humanity can be made fully aware of its fate!#LotsaDeath!☠️
1339672772226789385 2020-12-18 04:44:13 +0800 <BainzyC> @BrexitHome @christi73224817 The Brits. built Spain and coastal Portugal, only now are they seeing that without us they are finished, all these years us Brits. have been messed around and their eyes are only opening now. From denial to panic, why didn't our dependants help us get a good deal 5 years ago?
1339584301940129797 2020-12-17 22:52:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Where've all these starving kids come from? Universal Credit has risen this year, charities feeding families during COVID have delivered at no cost food &amp; essentials saving families £s. Labour R pathetic, all they want to do is make problems, if there aren't any,they create them.

1339213535306543106 2020-12-16 22:19:22 +0800 <BainzyC> We in the UK should have a one size fits all GLOBAL Free Trade Agreement!🇬🇧  The world would be very eager to oblige us and probably want one too.🇬🇧  True Globalisation, without selling off or giving away homelands to savage businessmen intend on monopolising all global trade!🇬🇧
1339211902325563399 2020-12-16 22:12:53 +0800 <BainzyC> This is the only one we need with her!  https://t.co/KaZcShZ1SA

1339204993979650049 2020-12-16 21:45:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Prove it, don't just say it! I've just come from my local hospital, it's like a ghost town, the car parks are empty, there is no flood of ambulances arriving, everyone looks bored to tears!
1339204127432257538 2020-12-16 21:41:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Or, you had to get tested to catch the virus!
1339203888940019713 2020-12-16 21:41:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Not with Dems in power they won't!
1339199357359448067 2020-12-16 21:23:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Away from the Royal Family, they may find that they are not that special, if personality alone became a measure of their success, they would be homeless in a month!

1339197499253329920 2020-12-16 21:15:39 +0800 <BainzyC> The economy must be destroyed to allow the maniacs going ahead with their reset to have credibility, they must blame COVID because a virus is something that every human is vulnerable too.  Like terrorism, an invisible enemy is always the hardest one to fight!  We suck it all up!
1339196296494780416 2020-12-16 21:10:52 +0800 <BainzyC> When you believe that a god has told you to kill, some twatty 'woke' teacher telling you to replace that idea for one to buy hamburgers &amp; chips to fit in with your neighbours the deluded ones will only laugh at you. Murder for a god &amp; 72 bits of muff is just too strong a draw!
1339194849191464962 2020-12-16 21:05:07 +0800 <BainzyC> All those videos being promoted showing people actually being injected are proving, like this one, complete bullshit??? There must be some really bad shit in those syringes that anybody boasting they have been injected are just pretending! Everyone in the world should be worried!

1339177142479937536 2020-12-16 19:54:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes, I'm really connected to a disgruntled over-privileged UK Prince and his racist US wife, we are so connected, please connect my bank account to theirs, they are so 'woke' I'm sure they won't mind sharing.  What a load of shite!
1339176137650561024 2020-12-16 19:50:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Who gives a toss?
1339157567688347648 2020-12-16 18:36:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Put a few drops of it into a large brandy, that kills the taste of it!

1338144916153790469 2020-12-13 23:33:04 +0800 <BainzyC> I wonder what The Queen will say regarding #Brexit in her speech this year?  Leaving the #EU is going to have a big effect on her and her estate, she will regain her true persona as the Queen of an Independent country once more.  #GodSaveTheQueen 🍾🇬🇧
1338143313191374850 2020-12-13 23:26:42 +0800 <BainzyC> We can.🇬🇧
1338140918243848193 2020-12-13 23:17:11 +0800 <BainzyC> 01.01.21 British entrepreneurs can exploit the separation with vigour, build their footprints in the soil of our land by making it bear fruit, we are a brand, a GREAT brand &amp; we can thrive in it, &amp; be proud doing it, not just for our kids but 4 all countrymen!

1338126015453929475 2020-12-13 22:17:57 +0800 <BainzyC> I think investing in British Shipping will be a great investment, so many more avenues in that sector to make some great money, in a good cause too, join in to help re-build the fleets, tickle the palette of the Brits. the treasures of our seas, healthy stuff fish, &amp; tasty! 😋🇬🇧
1338124544264056833 2020-12-13 22:12:07 +0800 <BainzyC> That's the plan, we will own nothing, they have shut down the pubs and stopped us meeting up so we can't blow as much as we can on good times before they take it all. 😪

1338056453760950272 2020-12-13 17:41:33 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm becoming nostalgic today looking back, one of my elder brothers told me that when a girl was born the doctors cut off her willy and didn't even bother sewing the hole up.  I believed that until I was 14! 🤣👍
1338055338273222658 2020-12-13 17:37:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Yeah, but in my house the more you cried the more you had the piss taken out of you. I ended up with 8 cu*ty brothers, every time I saw a bump pop up in my mother I wanted a sister!   My dad didn't do too much to help, he only wanted boys!🤣👍
1338054485747388417 2020-12-13 17:33:43 +0800 <BainzyC> He tried to console me by giving me a pair of socks telling me they were made from the same stuff!

1338051876865122304 2020-12-13 17:23:21 +0800 <BainzyC> When big brothers were real cu*ts, as nature intended!🤣👍
1338051025585004544 2020-12-13 17:19:58 +0800 <BainzyC> FFS! I would rather chew off my own legs 🤣👍🇬🇧

1338050079475830788 2020-12-13 17:16:13 +0800 <BainzyC> You still have time! 😎👍🇬🇧  PS I'm not affiliated in any way, but I may be in the future, they are a great idea
1338048851001872385 2020-12-13 17:11:20 +0800 <BainzyC> For #BrexitEve I bought one of these to wear! 😎👍🇬🇧   https://t.co/sbfW6cycI9
1338048114373124096 2020-12-13 17:08:24 +0800 <BainzyC> #Antifa need wiping off the face of the Earth!
1338047561823907840 2020-12-13 17:06:13 +0800 <BainzyC> Yesterday, I booked a table at Wetherspoons for #BrexitEve, I'm gonna #BrexitParty in a #BritishPub owned by a great #Brexiteer!  https://t.co/k2Lr5Ag5NQ
1338046565567651840 2020-12-13 17:02:15 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤬 They are BRITISH FISH! 🤬
1338045590429720577 2020-12-13 16:58:23 +0800 <BainzyC> But it will probably be opened by somebody else, my body being dumped in a mass grave because it killed everyone!
1338045320362676226 2020-12-13 16:57:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Listening to that song yesterday on the radio, I wondered why that had not been attacked yesterday!
1338044473746591744 2020-12-13 16:53:56 +0800 <BainzyC> I have for decades! 🇬🇧👍  If I pick something up that has #EU written on it I throw it down as if it's COVID ridden.  To thrive in the UK we must strive for the UK, that includes ONLY buying British and supporting OUR local businesses, ones that make the effort to stock UK goods!
1338041048669560832 2020-12-13 16:40:20 +0800 <BainzyC> I just don't watch it Helen, I don't watch The Lying Box at all, it's just crap followed by crap, my life is far more interesting the minute I pulled it off the wall and bunged it out the window!😎👍🇬🇧
1338040227877842944 2020-12-13 16:37:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Dear EU,  Angela is an #EU shill, please come and take her back, we in the UK don't like the shills that you have tried to infiltrate our country with.  We have a massive #BrexitParty to organise and Angela types are party poopers.  #GetRid!  The UK
1338039033914601472 2020-12-13 16:32:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes, we want another war!  Keep your fishermen out of our waters or else.
1338038586457853952 2020-12-13 16:30:33 +0800 <BainzyC> And none of them are funny!
1338038072437510144 2020-12-13 16:28:30 +0800 <BainzyC> Why isn't our media full of articles like this enthusing our nation instead of scaring the shit out of everyone?
1337861881005027334 2020-12-13 04:48:23 +0800 <BainzyC> He leant that from The West!
1337858362705387521 2020-12-13 04:34:24 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍
1337858176717365250 2020-12-13 04:33:40 +0800 <BainzyC> She had a majority, she deliberately lost it by calling a GE! She had to dilute the Tories to do what she did, set Parliament against the people. She knew what she was doing, we all knew. Treason May caused the #Brexit Saga on purpose to stuff us with her shit deal!
1337843876833484800 2020-12-13 03:36:50 +0800 <BainzyC> I like this tweet  https://t.co/1ourXB1r5D
1337843411488043008 2020-12-13 03:34:59 +0800 <BainzyC> No, you are not, friends don't treat friends the way you have treated the Brits.   After all the Brits. did for you lot, you lot of ungrateful twats.  Good riddance after #Brexit, send in your trawlers, we'll sink them!🇬🇧
1337841692402135045 2020-12-13 03:28:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Clinton was Bush's drug runner out of Arkansas, that's how he got to be number 1.
1337840836789276673 2020-12-13 03:24:46 +0800 <BainzyC> @George52259993 It's not New Year's Eve you want to cancel you bitter old sack, it's #Brexit Eve, isn't? Such a nasty creature you are!
1337814552138960899 2020-12-13 01:40:19 +0800 <BainzyC> With a few mushrooms chucked in, it's not that bad, sort of grub you'd get at The Ivy! 😋👍🤣🇬🇧🍺🍺  https://t.co/PySWlRRFRu
1337813469282918404 2020-12-13 01:36:01 +0800 <BainzyC> @viksta2209 I'll go out poaching later 😉👍🥩
1337783685987315716 2020-12-12 23:37:40 +0800 <BainzyC> How do you remove the shell from the sausage meat once it has cooked?🧐
1337781249977556993 2020-12-12 23:27:59 +0800 <BainzyC> 👍😎👍🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🥩🌭
1337780769331228675 2020-12-12 23:26:04 +0800 <BainzyC> I've just popped in a few mushrooms and S&amp;P, if I slow cook it for a week or so it should be OK, if not, the loo can eat it! 🤣👍
1337779817618534402 2020-12-12 23:22:17 +0800 <BainzyC> I didn't pick them, the tin of coconut milk has been there for years, something my X wife used to dispel her demons with(I think) the spuds were growing legs and the leek was leaking. I just bought a slow cooker so I thought if I bung them all in something nice might come out? 🧐
1337778948764282880 2020-12-12 23:18:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Why haven't they cancelled Anna, The Sour Faced Soubry?
1337778377101635587 2020-12-12 23:16:34 +0800 <BainzyC> There is a Wetherspoons close by, I'm thinking an all-day brekkie and a half dozen pints. On the bright side, I can't smell that spliff any more 😎👍
1337777821381513216 2020-12-12 23:14:21 +0800 <BainzyC> You're not trying to put me off, are you?  Took me 3 minutes to slice that stuff up and open the tin, I won't bother in the future if you discourage me from exercising my culinary skills! 🧐
1337777149965705217 2020-12-12 23:11:41 +0800 <BainzyC> Cheers to that!  https://t.co/8VelqpVDUA
1337776221652979717 2020-12-12 23:08:00 +0800 <BainzyC> I bet #Boris is so proud of that title, who wouldn't be?🇬🇧🤣😎👍
1337775670580088834 2020-12-12 23:05:49 +0800 <BainzyC> I think I might agree with you, fu*king stinks!😷  I've finally found a real use for the bloody mask 🤣👍🍺🇬🇧
1337774782226554887 2020-12-12 23:02:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Potatoe and leek slow-cooked in coconut milk!  Yes or No?
1337773753112080390 2020-12-12 22:58:12 +0800 <BainzyC> They've lost it!🤣👍🇬🇧
1337773320851378178 2020-12-12 22:56:28 +0800 <BainzyC> The NHS has had a hell of a lot this year without doing much!
1337771677527269376 2020-12-12 22:49:57 +0800 <BainzyC> And rightly so, we are excellent traders and should be feared by all of our competitors, that's the business of business!
1337771229776912385 2020-12-12 22:48:10 +0800 <BainzyC> 👍😎👍
1337771006669299718 2020-12-12 22:47:17 +0800 <BainzyC> We will be able to with #NoDeal, we will play on our own fields!
1337769817412079619 2020-12-12 22:42:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Remember the song 'Rule Brittannia' Debbie?  That was written because we had the best gunboats in the world, our glory days are returning, let's just hope our marksmanship still exists!  https://t.co/7y3ykKStsN
1337768297136328704 2020-12-12 22:36:31 +0800 <BainzyC> How are they defining the word 'Person'?
1337766611298754560 2020-12-12 22:29:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't rule out a last-minute extension, count our chickens tomorrow when the deadline has gone. How many times have they brought hopes up so high then dashed them?
1337764099946635264 2020-12-12 22:19:50 +0800 <BainzyC> I think SCOTUS &amp; Barr have been compromised!
1337763670412185602 2020-12-12 22:18:08 +0800 <BainzyC> Ohhh....I bangy pin, I like it!👍🤣👍🇬🇧
1337762201302683650 2020-12-12 22:12:17 +0800 <BainzyC> A weapon!
1337761979260342272 2020-12-12 22:11:24 +0800 <BainzyC> They don't, they tell fibs!
1337760704955359232 2020-12-12 22:06:21 +0800 <BainzyC> I did it for us! 😉👍👍👍👍👍👍🇬🇧
1337760379498340353 2020-12-12 22:05:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Racism has become a virus in the minds of narcissistic wannabes who declare it exists in everything!
1337758627931811842 2020-12-12 21:58:05 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣🇬🇧 The UK built the largest trading network the world has ever seen, it conquered continents by trade alone.
1337757376213094401 2020-12-12 21:53:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Dad's Navy! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1337757235204722690 2020-12-12 21:52:33 +0800 <BainzyC> I hope they are armed with pins to pop the rubber dinghies crossing! 👍🇬🇧
1337756950868725766 2020-12-12 21:51:26 +0800 <BainzyC> @GingersRus And....If we put it on those shelves we would have to bin it in as few hours, they are not refrigerated!🧐🤣🤣👍
1337732703064629248 2020-12-12 20:15:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Like, compensate them stopping illegals leaving France, do you mean?  Do me a favour, they just pocket the money and piss themselves laughing as they load them up and escort them into our waters (above our fish)!🇬🇧
1337732026712137728 2020-12-12 20:12:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Be British!🇬🇧
1337731300887842819 2020-12-12 20:09:30 +0800 <BainzyC> 👍😉🇬🇧
1337730048800006149 2020-12-12 20:04:32 +0800 <BainzyC> It's all well and good letting the world know this titch, but some of us are a little sceptical, we don't believe everything we read on twatter (no pun intended), we want proof! 😉👍🇬🇧  #FannyFirst
1337710579604140032 2020-12-12 18:47:10 +0800 <BainzyC> I can't be bothered, you cost me a day already!🤬
1337704736527708160 2020-12-12 18:23:57 +0800 <BainzyC> And how much does the EU owe us for the money we gave to build it? The land alone is worth a good few quid and all the tech, and other infrastructure.  Knock that off the bill or if, hopefully, we leave with #NoDeal and we pay you nothing, sent it within 28 days. OR ELSE! 🇬🇧
1337704048552710146 2020-12-12 18:21:13 +0800 <BainzyC> No, in pennies! 🤣👍🇬🇧

1337701520633188352 2020-12-12 18:11:10 +0800 <BainzyC> The Brits. built Spain and their islands after their civil war, if it wasn't for us, it would still be a desert!🇬🇧
1337700447365292033 2020-12-12 18:06:54 +0800 <BainzyC> 'Journalists'?  At the BBC?  Is she having a laugh?  The only thing left at the BBC are shills to their globalist masters!
1337693981522751491 2020-12-12 17:41:13 +0800 <BainzyC> The Tories are your rulers, submit to them, peasant!  😉👍🇬🇧🍺  #Brexit is coming full force very soon, get ready to party!🥳🍾
1337693221447733254 2020-12-12 17:38:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Debbie, didn't mummy or daddy ever say NO to you?  Today, let me be your daddy...  Debbie, NO!😉👍🇬🇧  #Brexit is the greatest thing to happen to the UK since we last beat the Germans 🇬🇧👍😉
1337685798364311552 2020-12-12 17:08:41 +0800 <BainzyC> Good point! 👍🇬🇧
1337673919415930881 2020-12-12 16:21:29 +0800 <BainzyC> 😢 If this whole COVID thing proves to be a scam, the scammers must pay so severely, they are wrecking the world!
1337673232032411650 2020-12-12 16:18:45 +0800 <BainzyC> I like boobies, if we can't buy beer, can we open booby bars?😋😉👍🍺🇬🇧
1337672348112183297 2020-12-12 16:15:15 +0800 <BainzyC> We must never be ashamed of being GREAT!🇬🇧

1337667459625652224 2020-12-12 15:55:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Anyone with a brain cell still active knows that #Nodeal is the deal we need! #Brexit
1337538659667619840 2020-12-12 07:24:01 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm feeling a tad squiffy, I may retire for the evening!  Good night and God bless all xxx

1337535838553591813 2020-12-12 07:12:48 +0800 <BainzyC> What does that #FBPE mean? Someone tweeted yesterday it was the LBGTQZYX+ or whatever branch of the remainers?
1337534440738795521 2020-12-12 07:07:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't worry, people like her go on forever!🧐🤣👍
1337533652931112962 2020-12-12 07:04:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Start agreeing with everything she says, get her all excited, make her believe she has converted you, then just as she begins to congratulate herself, pull the rug!! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1337532991338409984 2020-12-12 07:01:29 +0800 <BainzyC> I ran out of wine so I'm sniffing the whiskey, better not send her my way, I may take the piss!🤣👍🇬🇧

1337530746932785153 2020-12-12 06:52:34 +0800 <BainzyC> On the contrary, coming through Poland as a Brit in the rest of the world lines, I didn't stop for a second, strolled through whilst the EU queue was a mile long! 👍🇬🇧🍺
1337529534527246337 2020-12-12 06:47:45 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm sure he was devastated! 🤣👍🇬🇧 #Brexit is only a few weeks now. #NoDeal is the best deal. #RuleBritannia
1337528096417849346 2020-12-12 06:42:02 +0800 <BainzyC> @alastairdick What idiot wrote this? You weren't mug enough to pay him, were you? 🧐
1337527268969754632 2020-12-12 06:38:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Exciting news, might just get a telly if we start blowing the french out of our waters!🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1337498091755347969 2020-12-12 04:42:49 +0800 <BainzyC> I stayed in Calais for a few weeks, it's surrounded by countryside, I spoke to one of the locals and she told me that nearly every bit of livestock that was not guarded had disappeared.
1337496985503490051 2020-12-12 04:38:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Once Britain starts up again we will be impossible to beat, we will be like a brand new country saying to the world, 'Come eat at our table, it's huge and laden with goodies, we'll get yer pissed and make you rich!'🍺👍🤣👍🇬🇧🎶
1337496277119102976 2020-12-12 04:35:36 +0800 <BainzyC> What a joke!

1337495358415523845 2020-12-12 04:31:57 +0800 <BainzyC> Can we have it too?
1337494894944849921 2020-12-12 04:30:07 +0800 <BainzyC> You are not afraid of a little diversification are you Nat's Hat?  You need your schools &amp; hospitals turned into 3rd world shitholes like the rest of the countries.  Hampshire is too nice &amp; there are far too many tasty ponies in the forest down there to satisfy foreign palettes.
1337493426791739393 2020-12-12 04:24:17 +0800 <BainzyC> SUCKERS! 🤣 #BLM
1337492428811595790 2020-12-12 04:20:19 +0800 <BainzyC> To be candid, I'm happy they played it their way, it will be their downfall, it only worked in the beginning because of enthusiasm. The EU is proving it's too big, a world order would be chaos &amp; impossible to administer unless it was done with an iron fist &amp; 100% brutal control.
1337490994196074499 2020-12-12 04:14:37 +0800 <BainzyC> YES!!  At last, real British Power!  Rule Britannia, Britannia Rules OUR waves!🇬🇧👍
1337490354522763264 2020-12-12 04:12:04 +0800 <BainzyC> 'May be' which means 'bullshit'  Why do we put up with such shit reporting?
1337489496494006272 2020-12-12 04:08:39 +0800 <BainzyC> That little dog thinks nothing in the UK deserves attention, it's all shit to her, she is determined to destroy our country!
1337488845223366661 2020-12-12 04:06:04 +0800 <BainzyC> It was probably too white, they don't like that!

1337371598488301568 2020-12-11 20:20:10 +0800 <BainzyC> I suspect that the leaders of the 26 have personally all been offered great deals to sell out their countries, none of them has a right to surrender sovereignty, they are all here today and gone tomorrow.🤬

1337341562238464001 2020-12-11 18:20:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Not an achievement at all, no one reads that rag anymore!
1337341033819017216 2020-12-11 18:18:43 +0800 <BainzyC> It has been a mega struggle to get this far, let's hope it remains #NoDeal and we keep all the money!

1337193184036868099 2020-12-11 08:31:13 +0800 <BainzyC> Thank you, for admitting that it was our idea, #NoDeal it is. That's what we need to thrive, we don't need any more than WTO from them until they grovel for a deal!
1337192611673673728 2020-12-11 08:28:57 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey Give him bugger all, you can't trust him, I wanted a new bike 40 years ago and I'm still waiting!
1337191986118451200 2020-12-11 08:26:27 +0800 <BainzyC> News is not about you narcissist, that's the problem with you, you think it is!

1337174082283065346 2020-12-11 07:15:19 +0800 <BainzyC> The EU are a select bunch of Eurocrats, just like many local councillors, they have no sovereign power!
1337173652324970498 2020-12-11 07:13:36 +0800 <BainzyC> BAME should change their leaders, their present ones are leading them into an inferno!
1337173310384336910 2020-12-11 07:12:15 +0800 <BainzyC> They should, and we should, let sleeping dogs lie and Unite against the #EU!
1337172498258030592 2020-12-11 07:09:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Since I got divorced some strange things are beginning to happen, I bought a new vacuum cleaner yet the floor still has shit everywhere, I chuck my dirty stuff in the laundry and the next day it's still there? This new place must be haunted? 🧐

1337166331381166080 2020-12-11 06:44:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Every great leader has only achieved GREATNESS because he had followers that believed in them!

1337162013567574017 2020-12-11 06:27:21 +0800 <BainzyC> If you have ever had a fight in your life and won, you should always respect the loser who dared to face you!🇬🇧
1337160286344769536 2020-12-11 06:20:30 +0800 <BainzyC> Sometimes I think that life would be better if I became a woman, but the meat and two veg that swings between my legs tells me that I would be a deluded twat if I did!🧐🤣🇬🇧👍

1337155806136045574 2020-12-11 06:02:41 +0800 <BainzyC> HORRIBLE TWATS!  That is what we Brits think of the Dem Cheats!👍🇬🇧
1337153309854101505 2020-12-11 05:52:46 +0800 <BainzyC> My teachers would have given her a slap, a real one, one that hurt! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1337152071590694919 2020-12-11 05:47:51 +0800 <BainzyC> If you are Welsh and you can prove you are Welsh, I will post you some beer at my expense. Limited to the first Welsh person that responds. Britons, support our Welsh Brothers, sober, they are intolerable 🤣👍🇬🇧  BTW, that's on my honour as an Englishman, I promise I will do it!

1337149304444743687 2020-12-11 05:36:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe try to broaden your horizons M8?  Be a guy who gives work to other drivers whilst you sit at home and make you and them money?
1337148594378379264 2020-12-11 05:34:02 +0800 <BainzyC> The Muslim Brotherhood has conquered Wales!
1337147448918237184 2020-12-11 05:29:29 +0800 <BainzyC> What affects a #Brexiteer affects a #Remainer, those names R now history. We all have our nation's interests at our heart, not our discrepancies, we can move on! Today I lose my twitter handle for the good of my country!I love Bainzy The Brixiteer, but it isolates me from us all!
1337140208802861056 2020-12-11 05:00:43 +0800 <BainzyC> The problem we have in the UK at this time in our history is our 'Stiff Upper Lip'.  We, as a nation, have always faced adversity head-on, even if defeat is inevitable.  So I take my hat off to #Remainers, they have stuck to their guns, despite defeat, they are #TrueBrits. too!
1337137300233474050 2020-12-11 04:49:09 +0800 <BainzyC> Twitter being a global private corporation censors our tweets?  What gives them authority?
1337135475014967297 2020-12-11 04:41:54 +0800 <BainzyC> 3 dots?  Is that morse code?   It means S! 🧐🤣👍🇬🇧
1337134173367234567 2020-12-11 04:36:44 +0800 <BainzyC> COVID19  is a weapon, do you agree?
1337116929539125248 2020-12-11 03:28:13 +0800 <BainzyC> You can get nicked for that these days!  M8 is like Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms, Mister, Love, etc.But it's gender-neutral, something you need to know these days to keep you out of the nick for being labelled a sex offender. Times are changing, we gotta go with that flow until we change it
1337115860763340803 2020-12-11 03:23:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Are you proud to be British?

I must applaud you for not surrendering our glorious country to the EU over lunch, we Brits will feed you better!
1337099619747172368 2020-12-11 02:19:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Farage and Rees-Mogg speak at Leave Means Leave rally  https://t.co/pRNWyMjyU8 via @YouTube   We should not forget these days or how far we #Brexiteers have come and how we have fought domestic enemies in upholding democracy.  #BelieveInBritain #BuyBritish #RuleBrittania #Brexit

1337048736019738624 2020-12-10 22:57:14 +0800 <BainzyC> When you see the abbreviation M8 for mate, do you associate it with
1337036664733097989 2020-12-10 22:09:16 +0800 <BainzyC> They say every empire sows the seeds of its own destruction at its conception!  I think facebook and twitter have both done it, they allowed hostile environments to fester, when they could have done so much better!
1337032826194178049 2020-12-10 21:54:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Harry is thinking 'How the fu8k do I get out of this?'.

1337027355710283777 2020-12-10 21:32:17 +0800 <BainzyC> The Royal Navy can dictate how many boats come into our waters, retrain your fishermen to catch snails and frogs!
1337026826863079425 2020-12-10 21:30:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Personally I find #BLM and #Antifa a bunch of cowards, patriots would make mincemeat of them, and should if they got a tiny bit aggressive if they came out of their festering cities!
1337026265203806210 2020-12-10 21:27:57 +0800 <BainzyC> They still aren't!
1337026184937345024 2020-12-10 21:27:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Have a word with your nose mush!  What the hell happened there? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1337022950403346432 2020-12-10 21:14:46 +0800 <BainzyC> We don't want a deal, you will load everything in your favour, you will never let us have a level playing field in any deal you give us.  WTO is fine, we Brits. are fine with that.  Merry Christmas, end talks now!
1337021698860871682 2020-12-10 21:09:48 +0800 <BainzyC> We need the #EU like a pussie spot on the bum!  #Brexit
1337021331259486216 2020-12-10 21:08:20 +0800 <BainzyC> I turned Radio Scotland on for about 3 seconds, arrgh, I thought my eardrums were being ripped apart, such a harsh accent!
1336982741032833024 2020-12-10 18:35:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Normally the RC has kept the money to themselves, I dont like them sharing it, the RC has survived because it does not like change!
1336982455362981889 2020-12-10 18:33:51 +0800 <BainzyC> I was educated down that way, I love it, especially the forest!
1336982194091405312 2020-12-10 18:32:49 +0800 <BainzyC> He is a bit wayward, but let's hope The British Bulldog has rubbed off on him and that his heart is with the country and not his wallet.
1336961556744171521 2020-12-10 17:10:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Profiteering, they did the same when we went metric
1336958618038657025 2020-12-10 16:59:08 +0800 <BainzyC> Fingers crossed, they still have 3 x weeks to stuff it up!
1336953712028381186 2020-12-10 16:39:39 +0800 <BainzyC> All I hope, there are no 'woke' football teams...

1336691215660617735 2020-12-09 23:16:34 +0800 <BainzyC> I was being pedantic, you said 'Your mean', the correct English is   ''You're (or you are) mean''  🤣👍  A little free 🎁 for you, now write it on the blackboard 1000 times so you don't forget! 🧐✍️

1336682780135223299 2020-12-09 22:43:03 +0800 <BainzyC> @w1mav The guy has arranged on the wall lots of spanners, under each is the mm size of them.  The guy only needs one because it can be adjusted to all sizes 😎👍

1336674399462756359 2020-12-09 22:09:45 +0800 <BainzyC> We want people sovereignty not parliamentary, we saw what a mess you lot make of things!
1336673941579063299 2020-12-09 22:07:56 +0800 <BainzyC> How many were injected yesterday?  If it was 1000 then 2 would be 0.2%  If 0.2% of 68million get sick that's a big number of sick people!  Who needs a virus to get sick when you have a cure to do that job?
1336672559513931778 2020-12-09 22:02:27 +0800 <BainzyC> We are damaging our own immune systems by not getting the germs we need in our body, without germs to kill, our internal defence systems remain idle.
1336671426452000768 2020-12-09 21:57:56 +0800 <BainzyC> The must get rid of @realDonaldTrump or they cannot progress much further!

1336623009621225472 2020-12-09 18:45:33 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey Boris, Brexit, COVID, Biden, Putin?
1336622516136239104 2020-12-09 18:43:35 +0800 <BainzyC> He knows the hatred he will receive if he betrays us. Let's hope #Boris's ego and his need for a lasting legacy holds strong!  @BorisJohnson if you betray us you will be the most hated PM ever, if you stick to your guns you will be a hero up there with #Churchill!  #GiveThemHell!

1336608174556786690 2020-12-09 17:46:36 +0800 <BainzyC> You are better off using your credit card and paying it off at the end of the month for the bonuses you don't get with a debit card 🧐👍
1336606764754583552 2020-12-09 17:41:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Pope Francis is a Jesuit, not a Catholic!
1336604550950744064 2020-12-09 17:32:12 +0800 <BainzyC> One of those vaccines needs to be taken twice, so give or take a few mil here and there that's half, maybe the other half are for the boat people we can expect coming from the french?
1336603711196581888 2020-12-09 17:28:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Every Brit. feels that #Boris is going to play cat and mouse with us right up until the end, then betray us by selling us out. I hope he doesn't, the consequences would be devastating, who would want to work and contribute to the country again to give part of it to the EU? #NotMe
1336602545972781056 2020-12-09 17:24:14 +0800 <BainzyC> Got any of that smack left FranK?  Sounds like you are caning it!

1336600194805325825 2020-12-09 17:14:53 +0800 <BainzyC> I felt the same, now I use a bandana, I can breathe in that and I look like a real bandit! 😎👍
1336599595321876480 2020-12-09 17:12:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Give the good boy a nice jab, he has worked so hard for it!
1336599090570858497 2020-12-09 17:10:30 +0800 <BainzyC> If it worked once they would not stop using it, they would use it to sort out every problem and more.  It doesn't take many 5% losses for the country to lose the wealthy who would pay it, in fact, most would probably relocate themselves or their assets before the 1st hit.
1336597166584983553 2020-12-09 17:02:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Thou shalt not kill!  You are not a man of God, you are a charlatan, get behind us satan!

1336585490707910657 2020-12-09 16:16:28 +0800 <BainzyC> What did the leper say to the sex worker?   Keep the tip.  Two lepers playing cards  One threw his hand in, the other laughed his head off! 🤣

1336578930568990720 2020-12-09 15:50:24 +0800 <BainzyC> What's the difference between your penis and a bonus check?   Someone's always willing to blow your bonus.
1336577862531506176 2020-12-09 15:46:09 +0800 <BainzyC> What's worse than waking up at a party and finding a penis drawn on your face?   Finding out it was traced.
1336577586969927681 2020-12-09 15:45:03 +0800 <BainzyC> What do you call a cheap circumcision?   A rip-off!

1336290909802143744 2020-12-08 20:45:54 +0800 <BainzyC> It does nothing, has cost a bloody fortune to make and they want everyone to take it?  We must ask, what else is in it to make it so urgent for us to all have, it's not a vaccine or a cure?
1336245410915037184 2020-12-08 17:45:06 +0800 <BainzyC> So it's the EU trough she is aiming for?   Not helping Scotland at all.   #WakeUpScotland #nicolasturgeon

1335981571896209409 2020-12-08 00:16:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe we should all wait?  We've put up with crap for 9 months, I'd rather carry on like this than inject something into me which might kill me or harm me so I no longer have 9 months.
1335977848214065154 2020-12-08 00:01:54 +0800 <BainzyC> Until negotiations are settled one way or another, nothing can be agreed, so the steps to take cannot be decided because the scenario will have to match the outcome of the talks.  How the hell did you become an MP?
1335976658747133954 2020-12-07 23:57:11 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't think you do, but who am I to argue what goes on in your head? Bye

1335946660153843713 2020-12-07 21:57:59 +0800 <BainzyC> They are no longer our concern, our concern is to look after our own fisherman and our own assets.  Just to remind you, WE ARE OUT OF THE EU NOW!  Would the french allow us to fish amongst their banking clients or have access to any of their nation's capital assets?   Non!

1335541922870464516 2020-12-06 19:09:42 +0800 <BainzyC> There is little the EU produces that we cannot produce in the UK or get cheaper out of the EU!  We can match their cheeses, wines and even Champagne now, we can improve our home built cars by taking on electric with vigour.  We are far more competitive &amp; have a better Brand name!

1335185692121571329 2020-12-05 19:34:10 +0800 <BainzyC> The UK is not putting up a physical border.   Are you Irish by any chance?   Please find an Englishman to translate what's on your mind for me to understand please, and of course to translate English into whatever language you understand. 🧐🇬🇧
1335184934567292929 2020-12-05 19:31:09 +0800 <BainzyC> The EU is so used to getting its own way it just cannot comprehend anyone saying NO to them.  I think we should make them understand by changing the way we communicate, I think our negotiators instead of saying 'No' should say 'Non'. 🧐🇬🇧
1335183839904272384 2020-12-05 19:26:48 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey That will piss on his bonfire! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1335183583296823296 2020-12-05 19:25:47 +0800 <BainzyC> You said 'Putting Up' so I was referring to a physical border.
1335139834738970626 2020-12-05 16:31:56 +0800 <BainzyC> The UK won't, if a border goes up it will be the EU that erects it!
1335022612049768450 2020-12-05 08:46:08 +0800 <BainzyC> I have no TV!
1335020424812441601 2020-12-05 08:37:27 +0800 <BainzyC> The Dominion executives should be locked up!
1335016960854208513 2020-12-05 08:23:41 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey 🤢🤮  Just the thought of it!!!
1335016814049366016 2020-12-05 08:23:06 +0800 <BainzyC> I've never heard of Anglo-Catholic before, are they the Church of England?
1335016394300289024 2020-12-05 08:21:26 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey Fantastic views and a historic location!  If I had the spare change I'd have it 🤣👍🇬🇧
1335015624435789828 2020-12-05 08:18:22 +0800 <BainzyC> I know better Suzeanne to expect anything anymore!

1335014875605692417 2020-12-05 08:15:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Coming to your town centre before long!
1335014453306331137 2020-12-05 08:13:43 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey That house on the edge of the White Cliffs is for sale, £5mil!
1335013875759112192 2020-12-05 08:11:25 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey Add Lammy and they can form a triangle! 🤣
1335012480393863169 2020-12-05 08:05:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Little snowflakes melting in their own piss!  Yes, I see it! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1335012091485425664 2020-12-05 08:04:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Annie, you will be pissed when we #Brexiteers convince Ireland to unite and join us out of the EU! #Brexit
1335011565557444613 2020-12-05 08:02:15 +0800 <BainzyC> WHO indeed?
1335005114122330113 2020-12-05 07:36:37 +0800 <BainzyC> If only she was black! 😪😪
1335004160324939779 2020-12-05 07:32:49 +0800 <BainzyC> If the situation was reversed your statement would be too! #ScumMedia
1335003347695394821 2020-12-05 07:29:35 +0800 <BainzyC> @NutsMrs I shave my head! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1335001751477510146 2020-12-05 07:23:15 +0800 <BainzyC> It appears that way!
1335001207312699397 2020-12-05 07:21:05 +0800 <BainzyC> @NutsMrs Not a chance, I go Brazillian 🤣👍🇬🇧
1335000982611255298 2020-12-05 07:20:12 +0800 <BainzyC> No matter how hard you are, or how big and strong you are, you will become 1000 times bigger and better if you recognise God as your saviour and dedicate your life to him.  #JesusRocks!
1334999777545687042 2020-12-05 07:15:24 +0800 <BainzyC> My MP, she makes my skin crawl!
1334999493675200512 2020-12-05 07:14:17 +0800 <BainzyC> People that, aided by #ScumMedia, feel that white nations need to give what is theirs to them!
1334997877010145283 2020-12-05 07:07:51 +0800 <BainzyC> #ScumMedia has turned The British People against Christianity, in exchange they gave us football and other sports.   'Bread &amp; Circus' does not benefit the soul!  British men and their families need to humble themselves and recognise what our glorious ancestors knew. #GodIsBetter!
1334996077997662209 2020-12-05 07:00:42 +0800 <BainzyC> @Bobilly10 Because our leaders, without our people's consent, became too familiar  Familiarity breeds contempt!
1334995546994577408 2020-12-05 06:58:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Attempted treason?
1334995280975060994 2020-12-05 06:57:32 +0800 <BainzyC> A little girl's throat! 😪  As a Christain country, we Brits. only have this solace when it comes to our slaughtered baby  “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.”  Amen.
1334992915509207040 2020-12-05 06:48:08 +0800 <BainzyC> Chalk and cheese!  One side has to fold, none should!  #NoDealisTheBestDeal
1334991753250746370 2020-12-05 06:43:31 +0800 <BainzyC> @w1mav IMAGINE?  IT'S FACT!🤢🤮🤬
1334991329491898371 2020-12-05 06:41:50 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey Power corrupts!   He is no Trump!
1334991163011567624 2020-12-05 06:41:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Good riddance!   The UK needs pessimists like you, like a snake needs legs!
1334990580351430658 2020-12-05 06:38:51 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey I will not bend, I will not lock!
1334990123818217472 2020-12-05 06:37:03 +0800 <BainzyC> @MaidCakey More probably! They own most of the money making machines in the world that now, because most are digital, costs them sweet naff all!
1334989074562764804 2020-12-05 06:32:52 +0800 <BainzyC> @Bobilly10 Taking the piss or what?

1334959488445640710 2020-12-05 04:35:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Satan will feast on his soul soon, he can't live forever, especially with an ambitious Kammie on his heals!
1334958531922042880 2020-12-05 04:31:30 +0800 <BainzyC> YEAH, BUGGER OFF, LISTEN TO LUCYROSE5! 🤣👍🇬🇧  https://t.co/mgwaOarDfg

1334955541668442113 2020-12-05 04:19:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Please bugger off then! We've had enough of you, we want to get on and thrive on our own now. You are a stone in The British Shoe!  We'll send you a Christmas card next year if you scrape talks tomorrow, if not, we will send you a photo of our new fishing fleet instead! 😎👍🇬🇧
1334954478236299265 2020-12-05 04:15:24 +0800 <BainzyC> I need not apply, one look at my twitter handle and you will immediately reject me.
1334953272558440454 2020-12-05 04:10:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Poke your tongue out at her #Boris and give her a big raspberry! 🤪👍🇬🇧
1334952803006111756 2020-12-05 04:08:45 +0800 <BainzyC> 😪 Something will snap one day and the Brits will explode, this cannot go one for much longer!!!!
1334952415049764874 2020-12-05 04:07:12 +0800 <BainzyC> No one, it must stop or they will get worse!
1334951802123513871 2020-12-05 04:04:46 +0800 <BainzyC> 17,500 new British jobs in the offering, nice one! 🇬🇧
1334951290321981440 2020-12-05 04:02:44 +0800 <BainzyC> It will go to the wire that's for sure, on the bright side, it's only a few weeks away!
1334950993776218115 2020-12-05 04:01:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Why don't we just stamp on his toes and run off laughing?🤪🤣👍 Our negotiating team need to learn a few more tricks!
1334949861578387456 2020-12-05 03:57:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Who has learned to locate the letters on their keyboard since using twatter?  https://t.co/quc1BoY9UJ
1334949117542477826 2020-12-05 03:54:06 +0800 <BainzyC> She is cute, in an 'absolutely fabulous' sort of way 🤪👍🇬🇧

1334904485995552769 2020-12-05 00:56:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Where is the plug? It must be somewhere new Portsmouth, that place is a toilet! 🤪👍🇬🇧
1334883623275737088 2020-12-04 23:33:51 +0800 <BainzyC> @ctlmonkton Will they be in a gender-neutral jail together?
1334878161364979724 2020-12-04 23:12:09 +0800 <BainzyC> @Bobilly10 @pritipatel @BorisJohnson @SuellaBraverman We are still under EU rules until next month, if we play our cards right and keep away from foreign laws and treaties we can stop them. If we also put a leash on, or get rid of Blair's legal bitches, we can stop them 01.01.21 and save the country a small fortune.
1334876340533780481 2020-12-04 23:04:55 +0800 <BainzyC> I would like to change my job title to 'Chief Sinker' instead of 'Chief Stinker'! ☺️👍
1334875853856059398 2020-12-04 23:02:59 +0800 <BainzyC> I always find in a situation not going my way, 'F off' always works for me!  #Brexit negotiators grow a pair...
1334859068167614466 2020-12-04 21:56:16 +0800 <BainzyC> We have the power to stop them, turn them back or sink them!  Our borders are porous, that's not the UK any more, plug the holes by any and all means needed to get the job done.  If the border force does not have the stomach for it, employ folks who have.  https://t.co/rXUUhZsdJ5
1334858162181124097 2020-12-04 21:52:40 +0800 <BainzyC> The Royal Navy should do what it is for, protect our shores from foreign invaders no matter what vessels the invaders use.
1334857833360318467 2020-12-04 21:51:22 +0800 <BainzyC> With wheels on!
1334857564186619906 2020-12-04 21:50:18 +0800 <BainzyC> The word #Brexit triggers that lot 🤪
1334798921634295808 2020-12-04 17:57:16 +0800 <BainzyC> What's the difference between hungry and horny?   Where you stick the cucumber.🤪
1334798758731771906 2020-12-04 17:56:38 +0800 <BainzyC> When is it okay to beat up a dwarf?   When he's standing next to your girlfriend and telling her that her hair smells nice.🤪
1334798526069485568 2020-12-04 17:55:42 +0800 <BainzyC> An old woman walked into a dentist's office, took off all her clothes, and spread her legs. The dentist said, "I think you have the wrong room." "You put in my husband's teeth last week," she replied. "Now you have to remove them."🤪
1334797046281347073 2020-12-04 17:49:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Are they all at it? Is that the reason for the cover-up?  We must expose all of those monsters! 🤬🤬🤬
1334796316036263937 2020-12-04 17:46:55 +0800 <BainzyC> What do a nearsighted gynaecologist and a puppy have in common?   A wet nose.
1334796166542872577 2020-12-04 17:46:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Why did the sperm cross the road?   Because I put on the wrong sock this morning.
1334795137290031105 2020-12-04 17:42:14 +0800 <BainzyC> We must rebuild the Christian Churchs that are being burnt down, bigger and better and use them!
1334788577952194562 2020-12-04 17:16:10 +0800 <BainzyC> It will be the Germans that force the EU into a sweet deal if we end up having one, they need us far more than we need them. #Brexit
1334774575536754688 2020-12-04 16:20:32 +0800 <BainzyC> And they are NOT CHEAP!   #BuyBritishFish 🇬🇧
1334639698447306753 2020-12-04 07:24:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Who?
1334639050712604674 2020-12-04 07:22:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Go there then! 🤣
1334637039183073286 2020-12-04 07:14:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Disputed by the fraudsters and their allies!
1334633866141818880 2020-12-04 07:01:24 +0800 <BainzyC> They will argue that they have purchased it, purchased it with money they made out of nothing!
1334633395071168513 2020-12-04 06:59:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Define false? There is very little information about any of these vaccinations, many people just want them tested more, tested for long term side effects. If people who have the vaccines start to get ill or die you might not have any followers left or people to follow. #CAUTION
1334631705030889472 2020-12-04 06:52:49 +0800 <BainzyC> So #AbortionIsMurder in Ohio.  Well done Ohio!
1334630824457744385 2020-12-04 06:49:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Pierre is telling you fibs, he's in Brighton shacked up with Donny Dongle having a whale of a time!

1334623123157737473 2020-12-04 06:18:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Brilliant! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1334622170828468226 2020-12-04 06:14:56 +0800 <BainzyC> He is what we get when his mummy messed around!
1334590225671204865 2020-12-04 04:07:59 +0800 <BainzyC> @GingersRus She did the count, she one by eleventy hundred and twenteen. 🤣👍
1334589932355121153 2020-12-04 04:06:50 +0800 <BainzyC> What is the point?
1334589549473882114 2020-12-04 04:05:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Why do you want to turn the USA into a shithole?
1334588384648499208 2020-12-04 04:00:41 +0800 <BainzyC> Bung him some fish and chips before he goes!🤪👍🇬🇧
1334588011716243458 2020-12-04 03:59:12 +0800 <BainzyC> So what? He has worked hard to get his job. Are you jealous baldy? You want his hair, don't you? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1334585651308716035 2020-12-04 03:49:49 +0800 <BainzyC> I check online for the side effects too.
1334557682821369858 2020-12-04 01:58:41 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm going to go off-grid until the madness is over I think!  Shit is getting serious now.
1334557229870100481 2020-12-04 01:56:53 +0800 <BainzyC> I walked out of Boots today and a young girl stopped me, she asked me if I could come back in and go out the door next to it!  I bit my tongue and walked off...  WTF is going on with people, 100% control of everything?
1334554651337879557 2020-12-04 01:46:38 +0800 <BainzyC> When it comes to that sort of information we only get what we are given, anyone offering different more informative info is quickly silenced.  They want us to have whatever is in that vaccine, at first we will have a choice then we won't.  Times are changing rapidly, everywhere!
1334552373830836224 2020-12-04 01:37:35 +0800 <BainzyC> There is one, it's called Donald Trump! 🤣👍
1334551035604594689 2020-12-04 01:32:16 +0800 <BainzyC> I shared 20 last week at least a dozen times, it's my job!
1334511431694381056 2020-12-03 22:54:53 +0800 <BainzyC> How do you know for sure which one is photoshopped, his daughter could have been shortened in the photoshopped pic!
1334511060590727169 2020-12-03 22:53:25 +0800 <BainzyC> It was put out to debunk the original
1334510656566026241 2020-12-03 22:51:49 +0800 <BainzyC> If a few more people cared about important issues such as the integrity of our leaders, this world would be a much finer place.
1334510095955267584 2020-12-03 22:49:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Guessing is not really comforting when it involves sticking chemicals into your body is it?
1334509719474610177 2020-12-03 22:48:05 +0800 <BainzyC> It does
1334508068709789699 2020-12-03 22:41:32 +0800 <BainzyC> More scary is, who doesn't care!  If he has lived a lie as the most powerful man on Earth, what else could he have done?  I care!
1334507493905592326 2020-12-03 22:39:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Are they his natural children?
1334505893975773184 2020-12-03 22:32:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Which one?
1334504954191638529 2020-12-03 22:29:09 +0800 <BainzyC> What on Earth is he doing here? 🤢🤢🤮🤬   Forgot his pizza or hotdogs?  https://t.co/kqvP8KkmVC
1334503110107144194 2020-12-03 22:21:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Everyone is saying about the vaccine  'Trust the scientists'  If a scientist said the only way to successfully deliver the vaccine was to put it on the end of his willy and poke it down your throat would you let him?  Let me know  Dr. Bainzy (scientist) 🧐🤣👍

1334501212775997445 2020-12-03 22:14:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Sharing an item on Whatsapp has dropped from unlimited to 20 to just 5 now.  Big tech is stopping any and all from competitors!
1334500516248903683 2020-12-03 22:11:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Are you looking to earn some money Your Majesty?
1334499933840400385 2020-12-03 22:09:12 +0800 <BainzyC> When did I do that? Are you sane? 🧐🤣
1334495788836261888 2020-12-03 21:52:44 +0800 <BainzyC> They change their policies with the wind to jump on any bandwagon that's passing them.  When will the UK get a decent opposing party that is constructive, we are bloody sick of these ass wipes!
1334494939556798465 2020-12-03 21:49:21 +0800 <BainzyC> The vaccine topic is a hot one, people should chill out a bit and understand the reasons why people would want to take it and why they would not.  It does not harm to play Devil's Advocate either way.
1334494331449860096 2020-12-03 21:46:56 +0800 <BainzyC> It's my choice....AT THE MOMENT!

1334458361358782465 2020-12-03 19:24:01 +0800 <BainzyC> No, every drug has to go through years of vigorous testing and if a drug gets through that and it causes problems the makers are extremely liable!NEVER, ever have drugs got through testing as fast as these vaccines and what is even more worrying, 1 that they expect us all 2 take!
1334457569444851713 2020-12-03 19:20:52 +0800 <BainzyC> So everyone should be a guinea pig? Is that what you are saying?🧐  After you mush...........!🤣
1334457186962075648 2020-12-03 19:19:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Clinical Trials?For how long? A few days?The last trial they had on an Oxford person with the Oxford vaccine one of them died and others were very sick, that was 2 x months ago, who have they trialled them on since? People in Oxford are very worried. Maybe you should turn off TV?
1334456092689108992 2020-12-03 19:15:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Peoples doctors do, why can't they administer the jabs? They are not bloody busy that's for sure!
1334451216772984833 2020-12-03 18:55:37 +0800 <BainzyC> How would U feel if your family all died because they were injected with the vaccine and side effects proved to be fatal? Would you be so negative then or would you have wished that more trials were done and that the makers were liable, which they are not right now? Big Questions

1334246052048855040 2020-12-03 05:20:22 +0800 <BainzyC> She will need to chill once Trump gets re-elected!🤣👍🇬🇧
1334245544676519944 2020-12-03 05:18:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Just imagine how subtle we will be in everything without the millstone of the EU burdening us!  Like a Whippet let off its leash, the UK will be able to adopt new tech, policies and laws etc so quickly.
1334242319537737730 2020-12-03 05:05:32 +0800 <BainzyC> #ScumMedia can never be trusted with anything anymore, even if something they say happens to be true, they have cried wolf so often, no one believes a word of what they say.
1334238570408783876 2020-12-03 04:50:38 +0800 <BainzyC> It makes me smile thinking that by 01.01.21 the smell of Brussells will be out of every British body following Christmas Lunch and leftovers! #Brexit 🧐🤣👍🇬🇧
1334235221248634887 2020-12-03 04:37:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Have those symbols replaced the ink blots?
1334234969393270786 2020-12-03 04:36:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Even though it's my business I think that social media and TV should be limited to one hour a day, bring back some real-life into people's lives, it is so easy to get lost in these digital playgrounds.

1334169661898944515 2020-12-03 00:16:49 +0800 <BainzyC> 2 x weeks in quarantine first and after that I must get a certificate before I visit each household saying I don't have the lergie!   I might go to India for a while if I can get in, I spent 9 months of 2019 there, had a great laugh.  My M8s there nicked a camel, so funny 🤣👍

1334145237866979328 2020-12-02 22:39:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Im not sure, I got outbid but I dont like losing so I bid again, he emailed me before it ends &amp; asked if I wanted to buy now, which sent warnings to my little brain, I will see how it plays out, two days still to go, I could go get it but its way up north near polar bears I think
1334142004213714946 2020-12-02 22:26:55 +0800 <BainzyC> This did make me laugh, little things as they say 🤣👍  https://t.co/B0bUm78IgY

1334101018058100737 2020-12-02 19:44:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Islamaphobia needs to be defined as it is said, fear of Islam because islam's holy books tell their believers to kill, we all fear death.  It's a very clever ploy to use that word, just like Black Lives Matter, of course black lives matter but the term denotes that others don't.
1334099888506888192 2020-12-02 19:39:34 +0800 <BainzyC> We can make them, why not????👍😉👍🇬🇧
1334099485379731456 2020-12-02 19:37:58 +0800 <BainzyC> I understand your point, very much so, you can't silence people without a lot of money or the law on your side.
1334095645947400198 2020-12-02 19:22:42 +0800 <BainzyC> It wouldn't have worked, my school teachers tried to do that, messing around and having a good laugh was just too much fun.  I made millions, they are probably still there taking shit from little shits like me!🤣👍🇬🇧

1334087760379060224 2020-12-02 18:51:22 +0800 <BainzyC> The IRA were not global and didn't have the money to influence governments and pay the mainstream media to  do their marketing.
1334086574582231040 2020-12-02 18:46:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe they should stop chopping people's heads off, stabbing innocent people in the streets and plowing them down with cars? People get scared when groups of people believe their religion asks them to kill people who don't believe in it. Who wants to die because of them?

It will become mandatory just wait and see!

1333152319190540288 2020-11-30 04:54:16 +0800 <BainzyC> We are being kept 'comfortably fearful' not too fearful, just fearful enough so that we comply and not revolt!
1333148149481955330 2020-11-30 04:37:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Five guys walk into a bar.   You think one of them would've seen it.

1333128443727286275 2020-11-30 03:19:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Those films are not for the faint-hearted, they start off as a warning, then they draw you in, they then declare it like a manifesto.  Be careful, when you hear it being played backwards turn off your sound, when you see the strobes look away.  It is so repetitive on purpose!

1332619905439584256 2020-11-28 17:38:38 +0800 <BainzyC> zzz
1332618470375247873 2020-11-28 17:32:56 +0800 <BainzyC> They are fibbing!
1332617910712487936 2020-11-28 17:30:43 +0800 <BainzyC> They really did mess the fraud up, they never thought it through, Biden said they had, Biden was wrong, they got too greedy and they tried to steal it to quickly.  If only they had trickled the votes in, instead of chucking them in all at once, they would have got away with it!
1332617051458969604 2020-11-28 17:27:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Because we are being led into a future where vaccines will be a new commercial industry, we will have vaccines to enhance us physically and mentally.  Ask Bill Gates about it, he will lead the charge.
1332615642843910144 2020-11-28 17:21:42 +0800 <BainzyC> A victim of a group with far too much power!
1332613763778932736 2020-11-28 17:14:14 +0800 <BainzyC> 11.11 left 🤣👍🇬🇧  All I said was that the partner of a certain world leader was the ugliest tranny in the USA.  Not offensive, just stating my opinion, we all have our own tastes, or used to!  https://t.co/hN9VZUIN4d
1332611150945669120 2020-11-28 17:03:51 +0800 <BainzyC> When U look at the US2020Election as more evidence is found proving the count was manipulated, I'm beginning to think that it has a similarity to COVID. The true numbers don't matter, those counting the numbers determine the numbers &amp; how they are used to get the required result!
1332604687128940545 2020-11-28 16:38:10 +0800 <BainzyC> You hit the nail on the head there Captain ''COVID linked'' What other underlying illnesses did they have? Old people and sick people die as you know, what you may not know is that all deaths are being labelled COVID as many will testify to. Vaccine producers wanna sell vaccines!
1332603314668773376 2020-11-28 16:32:43 +0800 <BainzyC> I had the same
1332602478819414016 2020-11-28 16:29:24 +0800 <BainzyC> He must flog PPE or something? 🧐🤣👍🇬🇧
1332602240444608512 2020-11-28 16:28:27 +0800 <BainzyC> Nature is a bitch, it's been that way for millions of years, putting a snotty rag over your mouth or not meeting others does not stop a virus, it just prolongs it.  Sooner or later everyone must get it, we've already staggered it for 9 months, we should be prepared for it by now!
1332600599146336258 2020-11-28 16:21:56 +0800 <BainzyC> I was thinking that this morning!
1332600186502307841 2020-11-28 16:20:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Stop boasting, you sound like the BBC!

Some alien monster that will devour and destroy everything in its path? 🤪🤣👍🇬🇧  Helga, the EU has a place for you if you are so scared!
1332595953908461568 2020-11-28 16:03:28 +0800 <BainzyC> @PDevonian Certainly a challenge, on par with converting a lesbian 🤣👍🇬🇧🤣
1332594879453683713 2020-11-28 15:59:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Since it was discovered, I don't know anyone who has caught it yet &amp; I don't live in a bubble!
1332594068908613632 2020-11-28 15:55:59 +0800 <BainzyC> One way to prolong a meal is to serve peas and rice with every meal and use chopsticks instead of cutlery.
1332592468701949953 2020-11-28 15:49:37 +0800 <BainzyC> During the war, the French taunted   'We need the Germans more because we have no balls'🤣👍🇬🇧
1332591835181625345 2020-11-28 15:47:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Dress up as muslims and they will send out their 'Lady-Boy' divisions instead of their 'Riot Squad'.
1332591304203767810 2020-11-28 15:44:59 +0800 <BainzyC> They must pay for their part in this fraud!  #SuspendTwitter
1332590832445173760 2020-11-28 15:43:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Lots of rumours that he was a pedo too! 🤢🤮
1332590047531585536 2020-11-28 15:40:00 +0800 <BainzyC> 34 days left until the EU finally fu*ks off!  #Brexit
1332589340493553664 2020-11-28 15:37:11 +0800 <BainzyC> It's a typical lefty loser tactic, if they cannot find anything to attack you with, they just make it up, they only apologise or pay if you get them in court. #AaronBanks #DarrenGrimes are testimony to that.
1332588596633669632 2020-11-28 15:34:14 +0800 <BainzyC> When Trump is reelected do you think he is going to come down on twatter and FB like a ton of bricks!

1332586446801297409 2020-11-28 15:25:41 +0800 <BainzyC> The media must have their licenses revoked until they behave in a better manner!
1332586031934214144 2020-11-28 15:24:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Many who met Hitler said the same

1332581783393677314 2020-11-28 15:07:09 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm thinking of calling the X wife Rona, she destroyed my life and left me skint.🤣👍🇬🇧

1332539777091039232 2020-11-28 12:20:14 +0800 <BainzyC> #Trump will soon start to win states that Biden cheated in as the evidence becomes undeniable and the courts are left with no other choice except declare the rightful winner.  The Dems will send out their #BLM and antifa domestic terrorists out in force to hide and distract us!
1332538522826366976 2020-11-28 12:15:15 +0800 <BainzyC> He needs a massive lawsuit against him!
1332536207545397250 2020-11-28 12:06:03 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1332534874826215428 2020-11-28 12:00:46 +0800 <BainzyC> The people have never lost faith in your dad, only in the states that backed the fraud and their allies #ScumMedia.
1332534210305921027 2020-11-28 11:58:07 +0800 <BainzyC> 5 years ago we voted to leave the EU! 5 years the EU have been wanting our fish, we've said NO! 5 years the EU have been wanting to rule over us, we've said NO! 5 years the EU  have been wanting to control our trade, we've said NO!  What do 5 years of fu*k offs look like? 🧐🇬🇧
1332434467013726219 2020-11-28 05:21:47 +0800 <BainzyC> He was only dancing, if his Mrs did a bit more dancing and lost some blubber he would probably dance like that with her 🤣👍#SpoilSport

1332432235547471876 2020-11-28 05:12:55 +0800 <BainzyC> He is 100% right, you don't have to be a Pope to work that one out  #AbortionIsMurder!

1332430571792953347 2020-11-28 05:06:18 +0800 <BainzyC> That's a pedo sign, Comet Pizza had a similar logo before they got found out.  #Pizzagate #PedoGate
1332428410728165376 2020-11-28 04:57:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Cup of tea with that sir?🤣👍🇬🇧
1332374686882263041 2020-11-28 01:24:14 +0800 <BainzyC> If he had one it didnt work 🧐😎👍
1332344125467762688 2020-11-27 23:22:47 +0800 <BainzyC> A bit of cross-examination would prove it, a random question a 14 year old from his country could not know but an older person would.  It's not that difficult, if he was 14 he would not be able to get such a trick, if older his life experience would give him away if he did.
1332341491952455685 2020-11-27 23:12:20 +0800 <BainzyC> @JuanckersGhost @Brookranger Could you get any cornea? 🤣👍
1332340374241685510 2020-11-27 23:07:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Because they found his son in the year above him maybe?
1332312176040742916 2020-11-27 21:15:50 +0800 <BainzyC> He will be worse, they must get rid of 7 billion.
1332309634292588545 2020-11-27 21:05:44 +0800 <BainzyC> So, to even it out, we whites should start stabbing, robbing and killing more, that should do it!  #CommitCrimeForDiversity

1332246184665223168 2020-11-27 16:53:37 +0800 <BainzyC> All news comes from the same places, the Associated Press and Reuters, Rothschild owned.
1332245899003752456 2020-11-27 16:52:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Just about right!

1332239219331305473 2020-11-27 16:25:56 +0800 <BainzyC> I think it was Goebbels who said  ''Repeat a lie often enough and people will take it for the truth''.  Might not be the exact words but I got the point.  (Who wants to learn that weirdo language anyway?)🤪👍🇬🇧
1332238496820498432 2020-11-27 16:23:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Worse for the curtain I think! 😎👍

1332087687470321665 2020-11-27 06:23:48 +0800 <BainzyC> #BLM got global recognition by rioting, looting and violence.  The normal, law-abiding people of this world are missing something.....  I was always taught that breaking the law and violence was not the answer!  Was I taught wrong?

1332085425889038338 2020-11-27 06:14:49 +0800 <BainzyC> The only thing COVID is killing is our freedoms!
1332079223914307584 2020-11-27 05:50:10 +0800 <BainzyC> How many more will surrender their loyalty? Do they really give a shit? Honestly?
1332078826147475460 2020-11-27 05:48:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Do you get paid for your words?
1332062630190702592 2020-11-27 04:44:14 +0800 <BainzyC> These are not normal times, as we are told 24/7 by #ScumMedia!

1332056577105387522 2020-11-27 04:20:11 +0800 <BainzyC> HAUNTING!  The deaths attributed to COVID will not even register on a scale if the people of the world refuse to accept the plans of the so-called elite.  If the freedom of our kids is at stake,  then most patriots will die protecting it.  There is a better way, it must be found!
1332053728078258178 2020-11-27 04:08:51 +0800 <BainzyC> A new Cromwell will B born if we R betrayed, not only 2 sort out Charlie 3 but the foundations of R nation's future.  When I hear R nation's national anthem, I stiffen with loyalty, I never want to lose that, I'm proud of R ancestors &amp; what they achieved, it can't B wasted! #UK!
1332049690351853569 2020-11-27 03:52:49 +0800 <BainzyC> I have always been a monarchist, I have sworn allegiance to my monarch, if my monarch no longer rules our country but surrenders it to foreign powers, then all bets are off.
1332049329884962817 2020-11-27 03:51:23 +0800 <BainzyC> The Great Reset means you own bugger all, not even the clothes on your back, it pitches that if you think it, a drone will arrive at your location, not your house but OUR house, &amp; give it to you, even food. Everything owned and distributed by a world government, even your dreams!
1332048099578142726 2020-11-27 03:46:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Charles the 1st suffered the will of the people, he lost his head, the British do not like our monarchy taking the piss out of us. Since Charlie 1, they learned to respect that our islands belong to the people and not them.  We give them their privilege by denying ours. #TakeHeed
1332017930415071234 2020-11-27 01:46:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Who believes that the role of the press and the media in our societies need to be assessed and redefined?
1332017242486284291 2020-11-27 01:43:52 +0800 <BainzyC> The more we accept it the longer it will go on, this is our new normal!

1332002202559393794 2020-11-27 00:44:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Or get pissed up at Christmas and give them a kicking after the Christmas party!
1332002002113601542 2020-11-27 00:43:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Sorry I misread, I understand, no they don't know why, nor do I, they are a lovely people, they also love their leader.
1332001427275870209 2020-11-27 00:41:02 +0800 <BainzyC> I married a Russian, spent loads of time over there, they do love us, most countries love us except half of our own citizens, well less than half #Brexit 🤣
1331983696765837322 2020-11-26 23:30:35 +0800 <BainzyC> It is, worst still, foundations have tax-free status so they screw us twice!
1331976300249174019 2020-11-26 23:01:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Until today, I always thought 'Thanks Giving' was Christmas in the USA 🤪  My X wife was only partially correct say the fact-checkers, I am mostly only always right!
1331975543038877696 2020-11-26 22:58:11 +0800 <BainzyC> The Russians are used as scapegoats for lefty loonies in the UK and the US.  Both are so stupid, they both follow the same agendas but don't ever learn from each other's mistakes.  How did the fake Russian collusion fiasco go down with Trump?   Lies, all lies, stupid fake lies!
1331974111862673409 2020-11-26 22:52:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Foreign M8s with their hands on the levers of distribution?
1331973694269296645 2020-11-26 22:50:50 +0800 <BainzyC> And a Trump dynasty will last a 1000 years!  (Just to annoy the loonie left) 🤣👍🇬🇧
1331973422977576961 2020-11-26 22:49:45 +0800 <BainzyC> When America farts, we smell it in the UK in seconds!🧐🇬🇧
1331970729378766850 2020-11-26 22:39:03 +0800 <BainzyC> You need to remember Pervy Joe that it was the Dems that started a war 5 years ago and have made no attempt at a truce.  If you believe that a few snake oil words can heal the damage the Dems created, you are more stupid than you look  #TrumpWon2020
1331969651010654208 2020-11-26 22:34:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Everyone I know says it's about time!
1331968714925862914 2020-11-26 22:31:03 +0800 <BainzyC>  https://t.co/D0COZVFRRd
1331967815797051392 2020-11-26 22:27:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Nicola wants schools shut so she can play with Keegan look-a-likies 🤣
1331967423151558657 2020-11-26 22:25:55 +0800 <BainzyC> When Trump says it he is accused of destroying democracy @realDonaldTrump
1331966840382349315 2020-11-26 22:23:36 +0800 <BainzyC> None, we are getting sent the dregs of the world to drain our last pennies!
1331966531991986177 2020-11-26 22:22:22 +0800 <BainzyC> How much are you and your family going to rack in this Christmas from selling out the USA Joe?  BTW, putting music behind your words does not make you appear to be honest, use CGI and grow your nose as you speak, that will make you honest! #BidenIsACheat and his family are crooks
1331965798160736258 2020-11-26 22:19:27 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't worry, there won't be.
1331963886774456320 2020-11-26 22:11:51 +0800 <BainzyC> When @realDonaldTrump gets reelected very soon, his battle will be against the globalists at home and abroad. I can envisage his enemies being new ones the EU, China &amp; maybe even the UK if we go with this bloody Reset nonsense. A US &amp; Russian alliance along with Poland, Hungary?
1331961613851774978 2020-11-26 22:02:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't stand so close to me
1331953537081876483 2020-11-26 21:30:44 +0800 <BainzyC> ''Cock Inn'? Maybe that's what got Batty Boy Matty the contract?🤣👍🍺🍺🍺
1331948516508377089 2020-11-26 21:10:47 +0800 <BainzyC> When @realDonaldTrump gets his second term I hope he dismantles facebook, they have tried to dismantle him!  https://t.co/Bi0VLWozDl
1331922015607992322 2020-11-26 19:25:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Fright, flight or fight!
1331921509946941442 2020-11-26 19:23:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Someone gave the order!
1331916282250276864 2020-11-26 19:02:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Most of the money goes on salaries, Biden's Foundation, not one cent went to any cancer cause, the Clinton Foundation the same, Save The Children was found to be little more than a pimping service for pedos.  Stinking, the whole bloody lot of them, I give to pro-life and Poppies!
1331915630656835586 2020-11-26 19:00:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Diddums! Face a pig's head Dave, to rock your world, to take your mind off it?
1331912592772763648 2020-11-26 18:48:02 +0800 <BainzyC> But Joe is in the firing line!!!
1331912405622927360 2020-11-26 18:47:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump was on zoom listening in, it was fascinating, so much fraud, it is unbelievable to think that that they thought they would get away with it.  Who the hell thought that one up? Defiantly not a Republican that's for sure.
1331910352880230402 2020-11-26 18:39:08 +0800 <BainzyC> Will Joe Biden die in jail because he will be tried and convicted of election fraud?
1331867680412987393 2020-11-26 15:49:34 +0800 <BainzyC> SCARY AS HELL!
1331865014643384327 2020-11-26 15:38:59 +0800 <BainzyC> More than that I reckon, when all the tallying is done, signatures matched, Joe's fraud he boasted about will fall apart and it will all be exposed.
1331864177812656131 2020-11-26 15:35:39 +0800 <BainzyC> About those boobies, you must prove on twitter they are awesome, or you might get banned! 🧐😉🤣👍🍺
1331848080338145280 2020-11-26 14:31:41 +0800 <BainzyC> Is that because her willy might pop out?🧐
1331847463037235200 2020-11-26 14:29:14 +0800 <BainzyC> You will never understand because you are brain dead.
1331846877776654336 2020-11-26 14:26:54 +0800 <BainzyC> That's what they all say!
1331845870321602562 2020-11-26 14:22:54 +0800 <BainzyC> When Trump wins, twatter, facebook, mainstream media and untold politicians MUST be held to account in the attempted coup against @realDonaldTrump   NO MERCY!  An attempted coup is treason and those involved should swing!
1331844556518789127 2020-11-26 14:17:41 +0800 <BainzyC> He is such a fraud, a senile, old, perverty fraud!
1331702261475631110 2020-11-26 04:52:15 +0800 <BainzyC> It's like watching a 'Bash Britain' series, who, out of the pathetic lumps they put in the panel, can slag our country off the most wins smug kudos.   Good riddance to it, it used to be good before it went 'woke'.  As the saying goes 'Go woke, go broke'.
1331700953104388096 2020-11-26 04:47:03 +0800 <BainzyC> They do that every day, bloody boring now, can't we just say 'We're off'' and actually go?
1331700204018544641 2020-11-26 04:44:05 +0800 <BainzyC> The UK is already a charity case looking after the world's illegal dregs, now our own people need help.  Sell off some of the church's massive wealth and help out if you want, hypocrite!
1331693273631617025 2020-11-26 04:16:32 +0800 <BainzyC> They are not supposed to tell normal people what is happening in our hospitals.
1331692076292067330 2020-11-26 04:11:47 +0800 <BainzyC> His grandfather when he dies wants to come back as a killer virus.  Maybe COVID is one of the old fossils farts?🧐😉🇬🇧🍺
1331691382050861057 2020-11-26 04:09:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't you just hate it when some slime ball nicks a thing you are bidding on in the last few seconds? 🤬🤣
1331690180068126721 2020-11-26 04:04:15 +0800 <BainzyC> I can't wait to see 🧐😉👍🇬🇧
1331688570986303490 2020-11-26 03:57:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Boring, no one is listening Joe to a wannabe.  The White House, is Trump's House, not yours! 🧐🤣🇬🇧
1331687714492723200 2020-11-26 03:54:27 +0800 <BainzyC> Peter Shilton, you said what millions thought! 🤣  The REAL Hand of God will give him a slap, for cheating England! 🧐👍🇬🇧🤣  @Peter_Shilton  https://t.co/W4TEwbtXVU
1331686405093937153 2020-11-26 03:49:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Biden is not a threat, he's a perv!
1331686005435412489 2020-11-26 03:47:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Now 'The Hand of God' is gonna give him a slap for nicking England's chances of World Cup glory.  God being an Englishman and all that!🤣👍🇬🇧
1331685316290367492 2020-11-26 03:44:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Never mind hay!  I'm sure someone else will fill her place pretty damn sharpish at the trough!
1331684883178074118 2020-11-26 03:43:12 +0800 <BainzyC> All EU shills....
1331684714302812166 2020-11-26 03:42:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Those women may have saved themselves from an eternity of torment.   Thank God for COVID, what we lose at one end of life we save at the other.   Amen.
1331683615651061761 2020-11-26 03:38:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Why? Is he planning on sneaking kids across the border?
1331682262979649537 2020-11-26 03:32:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Ridiculous, with sycophants like that around, the world is doomed!
1331681591089901571 2020-11-26 03:30:07 +0800 <BainzyC> The Kiddies ones are full of pedos.....The whole charity game is a scam now!
1331671799420100612 2020-11-26 02:51:12 +0800 <BainzyC> It should be used to pay for COVID
1331671592728924160 2020-11-26 02:50:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Go to your local butcher and get a bag of the burger mix they use, that and mince is all you will need. I have hand made millions with just that.
1331662784275357697 2020-11-26 02:15:23 +0800 <BainzyC> It was in the 17thCentury we last experienced the financial turmoil we will see over the next years.  Charity begins at home, we could do with keeping all the 0.7% of our GDP!
1331604993556836353 2020-11-25 22:25:45 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1331584592768339969 2020-11-25 21:04:41 +0800 <BainzyC> F*ck off pervy pedo! Sounds about right...
1331584288224145410 2020-11-25 21:03:28 +0800 <BainzyC> He does not run, good lad!
1331583876565782533 2020-11-25 21:01:50 +0800 <BainzyC> On yer own Pervy Joe, no one wants a perv telling them what to do!
1331583313438531584 2020-11-25 20:59:36 +0800 <BainzyC> A Mess!
1331582957816000514 2020-11-25 20:58:11 +0800 <BainzyC> He is a senile old fool, I doubt he even know where we are on the map🤣👍🇬🇧
1331582550863712261 2020-11-25 20:56:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Surely that goes against islam?  Has he converted to 'wokism' or is he exercising taqiya to undermine the fabric of our society?  Hard to tell these days, so many forces attacking common decency it's difficult to say.
1331570189968814086 2020-11-25 20:07:27 +0800 <BainzyC> #ScumMedia  They are the biggest threat to humanity right now!
1331569927363375105 2020-11-25 20:06:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Laziness, their pay should be stopped if they cant do what they are paid for.
1331569645694947332 2020-11-25 20:05:17 +0800 <BainzyC> #Boris has a lot on his plate, no wonder he hid!
1331567973363048454 2020-11-25 19:58:38 +0800 <BainzyC> In the UK we need to regroup and take stock of our countries, serious things are going wrong and the wrong people have too much power in making wrong decisions for us all.
1331566260874866688 2020-11-25 19:51:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Her whole manner tells us that, she is lost to ISIS and always will be.  If we let her in and she kills then the people who made the decision should face the consequences.  She is a rotten egg, we don't want that in the UK.
1331565784477425665 2020-11-25 19:49:56 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes, I smashed my bits and pieces on that bloody gear changer...
1331554905107148800 2020-11-25 19:06:43 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't want to, its too scary!
1331539028697624583 2020-11-25 18:03:37 +0800 <BainzyC> The UK needs to restore common values and get rid of diversity. Diversity is dividing us beyond the point we will never be able to unite because the nation's values are too diverse.  Our laws forbid us to question the values of the people that are imported, diluting what we had!
1331536220841791489 2020-11-25 17:52:28 +0800 <BainzyC> A real constable would arrest the police here!
1331535913680334851 2020-11-25 17:51:15 +0800 <BainzyC> America is strongest when you reign in your domestic terror groups BLM and antifa and halt the importation of illegals from God only knows where with God only knows intentions!  Patriotism is not extremism, its good Americans protecting the country they love from the above.
1331528964796542976 2020-11-25 17:23:38 +0800 <BainzyC> What is the UK becoming?  https://t.co/H5SYsdGOgF
1331526642708180992 2020-11-25 17:14:24 +0800 <BainzyC> The left has no shame or conscience
1331526050417958912 2020-11-25 17:12:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Will England pay for them?
1331525692060803073 2020-11-25 17:10:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Its 10 times as worse as it was 10 years ago!🤬
1331525499911348225 2020-11-25 17:09:52 +0800 <BainzyC> They are all 'woke' recruits taking from the universities, they can only work in big gangs because they are all too scared to police properly.
1331521240671129600 2020-11-25 16:52:56 +0800 <BainzyC> If you ever fraud your way into The Whitehouse Joe, will you have access to many more children to sniff, caress and perv over?
1331520678571413504 2020-11-25 16:50:42 +0800 <BainzyC> We took this literally!!!!!   https://t.co/VR0OZLLiq2
1331520231706140678 2020-11-25 16:48:56 +0800 <BainzyC> London is over 50% BAME, they want it themselves, that includes the law.
1331517540166733827 2020-11-25 16:38:14 +0800 <BainzyC> It's not the vaccine we should worry about, it's what's in it!
1331516823137890304 2020-11-25 16:35:23 +0800 <BainzyC> What does the UK get in future except for people who come from the places we help, wanting more?
1331516395742502918 2020-11-25 16:33:41 +0800 <BainzyC> The Churches too!
1331516086848778240 2020-11-25 16:32:28 +0800 <BainzyC> It will kill the US!
1331386672349638657 2020-11-25 07:58:13 +0800 <BainzyC> He was a PayPal founder + he has many other successful projects, Space X, solar roof tiles, fast train tunnels plus a lot more to come..
1331382990270771202 2020-11-25 07:43:35 +0800 <BainzyC> How many 'glitches' gave Trump any votes?
1331379385912467459 2020-11-25 07:29:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Otvali, suka
1331378317946138632 2020-11-25 07:25:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Who said anything about 520 years, Brexit or Trump you idiot?  Don't bother replying, idiots bore me!
1331377849966731267 2020-11-25 07:23:09 +0800 <BainzyC> The Scots have rebuilt Hadrian's Wall!
1331376246207508480 2020-11-25 07:16:47 +0800 <BainzyC> I know that! Why are you laughing? Are you a blithering idiot?
1331372589336436745 2020-11-25 07:02:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump is the only thing stopping it, if he fails, the world falls!
1331369435718938627 2020-11-25 06:49:43 +0800 <BainzyC> They have been planning it for hundreds of years, I knew we were close, I never thought I would see it, I doubt I will live to see the end of it.
1331368112512495619 2020-11-25 06:44:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Or the vote counters
1331367116109393924 2020-11-25 06:40:30 +0800 <BainzyC> It looks like he is going that way, maybe the real reason Cummings did the off?
1331366321670467584 2020-11-25 06:37:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Walking through Oxford today, the High St has been decimated, most small businesses gone, loads of cafés gone, the streets filled with gormless masked idiots walking or waiting in lines at distance.  This, the new normal, is so unnatural, we have been turned into robots!
1331365316459368449 2020-11-25 06:33:21 +0800 <BainzyC> It makes you wonder what is the true reason?  Are we going to incur so much debt that the Great Resetters are going to write it or some of it off so we comply with what they want to do?  So much smoke and poisoned daggers!
1331364608192507907 2020-11-25 06:30:32 +0800 <BainzyC> New Year, New UK!
1331364466139795456 2020-11-25 06:29:58 +0800 <BainzyC> World record!
1331363967982243843 2020-11-25 06:28:00 +0800 <BainzyC> So boring, just get behind your country or your country will leave you behind!
1331361979232100353 2020-11-25 06:20:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Should I test my dog?🧐
1331361759404437506 2020-11-25 06:19:13 +0800 <BainzyC> Rightly so, the word ILLEGAL still means something there.  You can break into our country illegally, get 5* treatment and looked after like a VIP, yet if you are born here you say the wrong word on twitter and you get nicked.  Its all very, horribly wrong and it must change soon!
1331360704792645632 2020-11-25 06:15:02 +0800 <BainzyC> I need support like this when I do my exercise🧐😉👍  https://t.co/50L0rKgv0B
1331335356478795776 2020-11-25 04:34:18 +0800 <BainzyC> 👍
1331304641015975939 2020-11-25 02:32:15 +0800 <BainzyC> SKY news #ScumMedia are saying #Trump has conceded?  True????
1331240572280053768 2020-11-24 22:17:40 +0800 <BainzyC> What is wrong with him? Apart from being deluded, he really is an odd-looking guy!
1331236337480069121 2020-11-24 22:00:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Can't see that in the terms of service, are you sure?  I think you are talking nonsense.
1331235585911042053 2020-11-24 21:57:51 +0800 <BainzyC> It's what we want, it won't be free but it's what we voted for and what we demand, that, or a fantastic deal!
1331235225247096834 2020-11-24 21:56:25 +0800 <BainzyC> He is not in the White House just as your lot are no longer in Our Houses Of Parliament.  Biden and his motley crew are all fake!
1331169094620622848 2020-11-24 17:33:38 +0800 <BainzyC> He should get a dong, not Hamilton!
1331167556430929920 2020-11-24 17:27:32 +0800 <BainzyC> The Oxford 2
1331167198942031872 2020-11-24 17:26:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Sounds very WHITE!
1331166856158253057 2020-11-24 17:24:45 +0800 <BainzyC> I wished they had asked this before they went ahead and did it behind our backs!🤬
1331166466926841857 2020-11-24 17:23:12 +0800 <BainzyC> But, it can be fun🤣👍
1331039944488476673 2020-11-24 09:00:26 +0800 <BainzyC> I think you confuse Trump with 007 🤣👍🇬🇧
1330761990759964673 2020-11-23 14:35:57 +0800 <BainzyC> It's TIME, to be honest Louie!
1330184615223586821 2020-11-22 00:21:40 +0800 <BainzyC> I keep tweeting him and asking him the time 🤣👍🍺🇬🇧
1330099158871629826 2020-11-21 18:42:06 +0800 <BainzyC> He reminds me of the guy in the Hamlet Ad. the one with the awful combover 🤣👍🍺🇬🇧
1330098544791998465 2020-11-21 18:39:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Who would like to give that fat twat a 10-minute head start and then hunt him to the death?
1330097687719514114 2020-11-21 18:36:15 +0800 <BainzyC> They are OK when they go to sleep!
1330096724392734725 2020-11-21 18:32:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Evidence is in the hands of the best!
1330096238990135296 2020-11-21 18:30:30 +0800 <BainzyC> #Boris, with his 80 seat majority and the full authority to deal with his government personally, has decided to let you bedwetters scream and scream to no avail, in fact, if he is like most of us, he is pissing himself laughing at the faux rage you spew, it really is amusing! 🤣
1330094786594959364 2020-11-21 18:24:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Ed Davey PM has wet his trousers, the little piss ant!
1330094562476494848 2020-11-21 18:23:50 +0800 <BainzyC> God willing!
1330094428363612169 2020-11-21 18:23:18 +0800 <BainzyC> We can change our diet to a fish-based one and really benefit from our seas, blow obesity out of the water!
1330093390566920192 2020-11-21 18:19:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't let them bully you, that's what this is, bloody hypocrites. Rest assured Priti, the British People love you, we know that the fools that signed this 'Bog Roll only want to stop you protecting our nation.Keep it up, can I lend you a 'cat a 9 tails'? That will make them work.
1330090305421512704 2020-11-21 18:06:55 +0800 <BainzyC> It has 🤣
1330090163276537856 2020-11-21 18:06:21 +0800 <BainzyC> This is going to happen worldwide, Global Martial Law!
1330087120728453121 2020-11-21 17:54:16 +0800 <BainzyC> OK clever clogs, name the 9 people you can see in the photo! 🤣👍🇬🇧  https://t.co/IuqgDyP0st
1330086435840532485 2020-11-21 17:51:32 +0800 <BainzyC> A Global conspiracy against him, as it has been for the last 5 years.
1330086146815242241 2020-11-21 17:50:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Small ones if he copies the group of people in that photo!
1330084804067520516 2020-11-21 17:45:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Was it an 'If you don't take the jab, we'll turn you off' practice?
1330083637115678720 2020-11-21 17:40:25 +0800 <BainzyC> A question to you Keir  Who is killed most?  a) Trans people b) Christians  You should get your priorities right you bandwagon-jumping charlatan.
1330083094657982474 2020-11-21 17:38:16 +0800 <BainzyC> He probably did it!
1330082976349229057 2020-11-21 17:37:47 +0800 <BainzyC> The Stripe in Playa Las Americas looks like Africa now, you can't go there without being harrassed, the island has had it.
1330082382276403200 2020-11-21 17:35:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Is @piersmorgan one of THEM?  He certainly likes kicking around with THEM!  #SaveOurChildren #HangPedophiles
1330076458711207939 2020-11-21 17:11:54 +0800 <BainzyC> Yesterday you were remembering all those trans people KILLED until you were asked to name them.  You, Kier, are a cad!
1330073665719980034 2020-11-21 17:00:48 +0800 <BainzyC> I think that you are more likely to catch the 'Woke' virus from FB or twitter than you are COVID19
1330067167996489728 2020-11-21 16:34:58 +0800 <BainzyC> She has class, they don't!
1330066643851075587 2020-11-21 16:32:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Not just the Home Office, the WHOLE of the Civil Service.
1330065990416273412 2020-11-21 16:30:18 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't know why they didn't as soon as #Brexit happened. NONE of the current Home Office has any experience of running the country without EU interference, we need a 100% cleanout there, now its time for them to do some work they don't want to.
1330065077211377668 2020-11-21 16:26:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Something very weird is happening, all of a sudden Andrew O'Neil and Tucker Carson, both have gone completely 'woke' on this subject.  Have they both been compromised?  #ItIsNotMakingSense
1330063609830006786 2020-11-21 16:20:50 +0800 <BainzyC> And worship Jesus!
1330063473729019913 2020-11-21 16:20:18 +0800 <BainzyC> If she's giving away snogs, I'd have one! ☺️😉👍🇬🇧
1330062964532113409 2020-11-21 16:18:16 +0800 <BainzyC> That is a really bad cartoon, if it was against Islam and not Hindus, heads would roll,literally, the Muslim religious maniacs would cut peoples heads off for a cartoon like this if it was against Islam, you don't have to believe me, just look at Nice and Paris, 2 C the headless
1330060941971566594 2020-11-21 16:10:14 +0800 <BainzyC> That's for sure, thank God she has the strength to rise above them.
1330060492354842630 2020-11-21 16:08:27 +0800 <BainzyC> #ILovePritti   RT if you love our beautiful, intelligent, strong, BAME, resourceful Home Secretary.  If we want to close our borders then we must support her and help her get rid of entities within our government who want our borders porous.
1330059583012950024 2020-11-21 16:04:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Corrupted Dominion voting machines seem to have a trail that leads to the door of George Soros, nothing would surprise me when it comes to that demon, he likes to destroy the odd country here and there.  He is not above the law, grab him and punish him!
1330058809482620932 2020-11-21 16:01:46 +0800 <BainzyC> They have been naughty and now they have been caught!
1330057663556820993 2020-11-21 15:57:12 +0800 <BainzyC> That's why they hate her, they hate all good people, they want our government to be as corrupted and stupid as them.
1330055462960705538 2020-11-21 15:48:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Politics of hate don't work numbnuts, you are changing The Liebour Party into a rotten kindergarten, it is not a good look for a party, filled with Jew-hating, petty misfits, you lot of spoilt kids are going nowhere!
1330054348781576195 2020-11-21 15:44:02 +0800 <BainzyC> I agree 100%

1330052551815925764 2020-11-21 15:36:54 +0800 <BainzyC> I'd even let her whip me with a wet lettuce leaf, in fact, I'd encourage her   ''Pritti, Pritti, I jammed the copier on purpose, chastise me, chastise me''. 🤣👍☺️🇬🇧
1330049925917401088 2020-11-21 15:26:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Here is another bully going for Pritti, hoping to get blood, they are all the same.  Well done #Boris, don't let the c*nts bring you or your team done, get #Brexit done and get Pritti to slam our borders closed. #WeLovePritti
1330049265088000000 2020-11-21 15:23:50 +0800 <BainzyC> All #ScumMedia seem to be in on it
1330048553142657025 2020-11-21 15:21:00 +0800 <BainzyC> The Labour Party is lost!

1329927383848247296 2020-11-21 07:19:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Unfortunately, I cannot be naughty anymore this evening, I have a 4am zoom conference I must host tomorrow.  I will continue this thread Judy when I have more time.  In the meantime, be good to yourself and think of me🤣☺️👍😋

1329925536282456066 2020-11-21 07:12:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Why? Because when push comes to shove, it will be forced into you!
1329922118058958848 2020-11-21 06:58:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Jealousy and envy seep from every ragged old pore on your body!
1329920635636768770 2020-11-21 06:52:42 +0800 <BainzyC> All good until you make a claim, then it all goes tits up! 🤬
1329918231231016962 2020-11-21 06:43:09 +0800 <BainzyC> It's the only thing I'm good at, being naughty 🤣👍🍺☺️

1329916462203547650 2020-11-21 06:36:07 +0800 <BainzyC> This poll is crap, you spend ages on it, it grabs your details but never gives you an answer
1329915544137555971 2020-11-21 06:32:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Brilliant, even that's too many days!
1329914811665305602 2020-11-21 06:29:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Judy, you are a bad influence on me, I'll get banned again, then you will miss me.  I love a Brazillian too, nothing worse than getting a bit of dental floss when you don't need it! 😉🤣👍🍺
1329913284334661637 2020-11-21 06:23:30 +0800 <BainzyC> If you are sporting a 'Kojak' you must have had your shoes around your ear area then, I can just picture that....Nice! ☺️🤣👍😎🍺
1329912413211287553 2020-11-21 06:20:02 +0800 <BainzyC> It's not over yet, 10 trillion and still counting, most of it debt,  the wealth of our great-grandchildren stolen too!
1329911606478823427 2020-11-21 06:16:50 +0800 <BainzyC> I was only 5 when I had mine, no cummerband but 3 x buttons high  https://t.co/awGCOjIWzq
1329910451942154240 2020-11-21 06:12:14 +0800 <BainzyC> muslims should stop chopping peoples heads off, people don't like that, it bloody hurts!
1329908902775955460 2020-11-21 06:06:05 +0800 <BainzyC> I used to love the high waistband trousers
1329907161296756736 2020-11-21 05:59:10 +0800 <BainzyC> 1984
1329906692528754689 2020-11-21 05:57:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Possibly? I know that in Switzerland to take any data of American citizens was a nightmare, and they were not as strict as the EU.
1329904761076932613 2020-11-21 05:49:38 +0800 <BainzyC> I remember that very bloody well, I soon found out that the hardware shop did not sell Skyhooks, tartan paint or glass hammers! 😉
1329902899154071553 2020-11-21 05:42:14 +0800 <BainzyC> And the first one?  Only for besties? .............. (Fingers X'ed!)  🤣👍😎😉🇬🇧🍺

1329877787994361857 2020-11-21 04:02:27 +0800 <BainzyC> You are just jealous because your 'wokey' mater brought you up on urine.
1329876168686919680 2020-11-21 03:56:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Le Pen was a victim of it, little Napoleon came from a nothing and won at the last hurdle.
1329873384679874574 2020-11-21 03:44:57 +0800 <BainzyC> Not really, but they do show that those with them have usually earned them.

1329797350248869889 2020-11-20 22:42:49 +0800 <BainzyC> He is such a twat that guy, it's about time there was a credible opposition in British politics, the shower of shites in the Liebour party have all lost it, they have adopted the US Democratic policies of hate &amp; they do that very badly.  Politics can be positive and constructive!

1329781814915964930 2020-11-20 21:41:05 +0800 <BainzyC> For the growing number of people committing suicide due to the stresses of the lockdown, it is the end of their world dickhead!  Bogging the TV 24/7 for braindead imbeciles like yourself might be OK, but for people who like to engage life, it's a bloody nightmare!
1329780350759919617 2020-11-20 21:35:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Ghost of Pinnochio more like!  They shut him up because his nose kept giving them away!   🤪👍
1329779648323051520 2020-11-20 21:32:28 +0800 <BainzyC> If I was him, I would be looking at getting a little hut high up in the Ukrainian Urals before his chickens come to roost.
1329779244478685184 2020-11-20 21:30:52 +0800 <BainzyC> He will not, only the person who gets most legal votes gets to be president.

1329777301215735809 2020-11-20 21:23:09 +0800 <BainzyC> There is no progress because anyone with teeth keeps getting muzzled by the loony left and those lazy sods in the civil service.
1329776312257396736 2020-11-20 21:19:13 +0800 <BainzyC> @pritipatel The UK loves you.

1329774864606040066 2020-11-20 21:13:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Thank God you are not PM, not just my point of view but most of the UK.  Talking of sacking and getting rid of hateful bullies, how is Jezza settling back in?  Is he drawing up plans for concentration camps yet?
1329773659150487553 2020-11-20 21:08:40 +0800 <BainzyC> She should have told them where to go.   She is boss, she needs to be able to control without soppy lefties crying.
1329773286599888901 2020-11-20 21:07:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Her 'leftie' enemies are calling strength and determination 'bullying'.  She apologised for doing her job, for being boss.   On this occasion, I think she was wrong to do that, she must be able to deal with Swamp Creatures in a way they understand, or they will take advantage.
1329769122733977600 2020-11-20 20:50:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Show him your boobies, works with me every time!😊👍🇬🇧🍺
1329768465650102277 2020-11-20 20:48:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump will never roll over, they will have to drag him out of The Whitehouse kicking and screaming if anyone brave enough to do it, can get past his supporters and fight him.

1329748644237545473 2020-11-20 19:29:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Most probably, I sent her to the Salvation Army to get some knickers and some Head &amp; Shoulders!
1329747348776509442 2020-11-20 19:24:08 +0800 <BainzyC> I tried it before but only managed to recruit one old lady, not the type I was hoping to attract, dandruff on her shoes put me off!🧐🤣👍🇬🇧
1329743899024367618 2020-11-20 19:10:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Not as easy as it looks, I've laddered two pairs of tights already and I have nothing decent to wear 😊👍
1329742034161324032 2020-11-20 19:03:01 +0800 <BainzyC> I was thinking of Gender Bending this weekend and become a lesbian, I will then try and lead heterosexual women in a 'Let it Breathe' campaign, asking all birds, I mean women, to go pantyless. Lesbians will think I'm recruiting not perving. Great plan! Did I mention boobies? Yum!
1329740820229054464 2020-11-20 18:58:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Spot on Ash, Labour are the Muslim Brotherhood Party, they don't want us to protect ourselves!
1329740579991908354 2020-11-20 18:57:14 +0800 <BainzyC> Without a proper defence, we may not have a future Einstein, especially moving away from the EU, we need to be able to defend ourselves against any threat.

1328994319085268992 2020-11-18 17:31:51 +0800 <BainzyC> On #Brexit Day in March, I got asked for proof of age ID, I was well chuffed, I'm over 50!
1328993651368878081 2020-11-18 17:29:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Very much so, he has been Piers Morgon'ed!
1328987515362086912 2020-11-18 17:04:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Who thinks he is more attractive than Melania Trump?  https://t.co/NeD1hXfdE4
1328986709242093568 2020-11-18 17:01:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Have you noticed that spotty, jumped up teenagers and insignificant losers given 'Keyworker' jobs are becoming far too big for their boots armed with COVID?  That's what Hitler did, gave power to the bitter and twisted who got drunk very quickly on it.
1328985848314990592 2020-11-18 16:58:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Smoke &amp; daggers are the order of the day and every day of 2020.

1328984927266873346 2020-11-18 16:54:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump only fires twats!
1328984291452313601 2020-11-18 16:52:01 +0800 <BainzyC> @blueeyedboy001 Trump has revealed the viper's nest!
1328983443481513984 2020-11-18 16:48:38 +0800 <BainzyC> @blueeyedboy001 'Is' Trump!
1328983127553961984 2020-11-18 16:47:23 +0800 <BainzyC> They have taken over everything on The Bullshit Box.  If a white man gets any part at all he is portrayed as 'The Dopey Twat'.  Why on earth do you think people are dumping traditional channels and going online?  Give it to the gays &amp; BAME, it's shit anyway!
1328981964657987586 2020-11-18 16:42:46 +0800 <BainzyC> COVID has gifted me already this Christmas, I won't have to put up with all the family 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺
1328981418542817280 2020-11-18 16:40:36 +0800 <BainzyC> @blueeyedboy001 The two parties are chalk and cheese, Dems hate and drain their states, Republicans govern and thrive.
1328979981297479682 2020-11-18 16:34:53 +0800 <BainzyC> I know, I was making a point.   Trump is President-elect + President!
1328979140956090369 2020-11-18 16:31:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Politicised hate!
1328978754237063168 2020-11-18 16:30:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Could Joe have taken the same sort of shit Trump took over the last 5 years?  Republicans are not evil like Democrats but they could have made his life hell if his theft plan had worked. I doubt he would have lasted 6 x months.  Kammie has no soul, she could laugh it off!
1328977454095069186 2020-11-18 16:24:50 +0800 <BainzyC> The model for the rest of us, controlled by AI, fart in the wrong direction and get punished.
1328976677104472065 2020-11-18 16:21:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Joe Biden 45 1/2th President.  The Big Man who tried to cheat A Giant!  #KarmaIsChasingJoe
1328976061221179392 2020-11-18 16:19:18 +0800 <BainzyC> They are realising that their necks could be on the blocks very soon!  How they have acted over the theft of Election2020 could be called complicity.  One man who is not scared to call it as it is, is Donald J. Trump, 45th (and 46th) US president.
1328975148742008833 2020-11-18 16:15:41 +0800 <BainzyC> It's probably holiday money to him! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1328974917820268544 2020-11-18 16:14:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Labour does not need to win Parliament, what they have done is win the country at the local level, the majors and councillors, the people that actually control the country.  Blow your mind by researching who the majors are of all our cities!
1328970883797540864 2020-11-18 15:58:44 +0800 <BainzyC> There are less than 80,000 British troops!
1328848038773874689 2020-11-18 07:50:35 +0800 <BainzyC> A bit premature Moron!

1328846123872772097 2020-11-18 07:42:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Like Joe did with his cancer foundation? Nice little earner that!!!!
1328818988407795712 2020-11-18 05:55:09 +0800 <BainzyC> He thinks he is far superior to everyone else!

1328759339746779137 2020-11-18 01:58:08 +0800 <BainzyC> @PDevonian There must be a pure black one that has exceeded in a white privileged world, can he really call himself black?  How would he react if we said all his driving skills came from his white half?  This race thing is getting shitty!
1328757659235983362 2020-11-18 01:51:27 +0800 <BainzyC> He lives in Monaco so he doesn't have to pay his fair share of taxes.  If that's influential to other blacks, the black treasury will be empty!
1328756996691136515 2020-11-18 01:48:49 +0800 <BainzyC> BAME MPs love licking the cream! 🤬

1328752192086487042 2020-11-18 01:29:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Just give me power of attorney, I'll make sure you are remembered.   Every year I will pour a bottle of whiskey over the last spot you were in, in one piece!  PS I hope you don't mind it passing through my kidneys first though? 🧐👍🇬🇧

1328707878795022336 2020-11-17 22:33:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Well, it's obvious that they're not using your readings, what they're doing is tempting you to get a smart meter by deliberately putting your fees up. Best thing to do is to go into arrears &amp; underpay for a while, it's expensive to be in credit these days.Negative Interest Rules!

1328628157319090176 2020-11-17 17:16:52 +0800 <BainzyC> The Left is an all-encompassing term, what they are, are a Marxist/Communist/Fascist hybrid with a bit of 'Je ne sais pas' evil included, more cult-like than political, more an illness than an ideology.  I expect in years to come they will be given an 'ist' name!
1328621015157645314 2020-11-17 16:48:29 +0800 <BainzyC> They will attack the internet, that's my bet!  Silence everyone with one hit.
1328620087910207488 2020-11-17 16:44:48 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump cannot concede, he must expose the fraud so it never can happen again!  The 2nd term for him now will be purely coincidental, a result not of an election but of exposing the most corrupt incident in American history.  Watergate is dwarfed by the ELECTION2020 attempted coup!
1328618717882822656 2020-11-17 16:39:21 +0800 <BainzyC> You need glasses mush, that's a jar of coffee!
1328617993392295936 2020-11-17 16:36:28 +0800 <BainzyC> It's shit scared of soap, give us your Palm Olive!
1328617336530755584 2020-11-17 16:33:52 +0800 <BainzyC> I know it's very difficult to get a straight, truthful answer out of any politician except Trump, but can you please tell us:  Is C19 designed to bring in The Great Reset designed by the megalomaniac below?   All we want is honesty!  https://t.co/0e2nTtznN4
1328615413274595328 2020-11-17 16:26:13 +0800 <BainzyC> @blueeyedboy001 I'm such 'Hot Stuff' I should really give my underpants the time to cool down before I put them in that electric woman thing!🤣👍🍺
1328613521492471810 2020-11-17 16:18:42 +0800 <BainzyC> TRUMP WON BY LANDSLIDE WITH COUNT OF LEGAL VOTES ONLY!
1328613112094789633 2020-11-17 16:17:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Cur! I think he means?
1328612826412441600 2020-11-17 16:15:56 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍 Nice one!
1328610878112075776 2020-11-17 16:08:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe I should follow the mantra of my mate  If it flys, floats or f*cks, rent it? 🤣👍🍺
1328609787282591744 2020-11-17 16:03:52 +0800 <BainzyC> We don't need it, dump it, along with anything else the B Liar did!
1328608855266353152 2020-11-17 16:00:10 +0800 <BainzyC> What official sources?   I thought Trump, as the most powerful man on Earth, was probably the most official too?  Or have the twats at twitter overtaken him?  https://t.co/FEDSTHJqI5
1328608119493169153 2020-11-17 15:57:14 +0800 <BainzyC> I need a new woman in my life! My house is trying to kill me.  https://t.co/GYKCD1DWbf

1328606039592349697 2020-11-17 15:48:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Haven't you got it yet?  There is a huge bunch of idiots in the UK that are offended by the truth!
1328599783007776768 2020-11-17 15:24:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Because Marxist educated students are taught how to manipulate through protest whilst a plumber just gets on with his job.  If plumbers were educated in the same way they would tell students to 'piss off' and, I almost forgot,  'fuc* Trump!'.
1328599021536092162 2020-11-17 15:21:05 +0800 <BainzyC> I've seen the local one's advertising, looks a bit odd during a pandemic?
1328598221254516736 2020-11-17 15:17:54 +0800 <BainzyC> 😪 Goodbye brave British warrior +RIP+

1328596626865315841 2020-11-17 15:11:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Yesterday was a day!  https://t.co/2FQFikE2TI
1328595647843475456 2020-11-17 15:07:41 +0800 <BainzyC> That can't be right, my TV said there was no credible evidence anywhere. Karen, are you fibbing?
1328595173471887361 2020-11-17 15:05:48 +0800 <BainzyC> A violent, cowardly sex offender, where do BLM and antifa recruit from? Prisons?
1328593860025602049 2020-11-17 15:00:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Bum Chums maybe? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1328592727290867712 2020-11-17 14:56:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't be a twat all your life please, I know it's difficult for you, but please, make the effort!
1328591991467364352 2020-11-17 14:53:09 +0800 <BainzyC> He is a cowardly chump who sucker punches from behind, he is also a pervy sex offender!
1328591414217863169 2020-11-17 14:50:51 +0800 <BainzyC> He doesn't, he has been 'tracked and traced'.
1328591068523356162 2020-11-17 14:49:29 +0800 <BainzyC> #Boris is hiding!
1328590451394351105 2020-11-17 14:47:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump holds a massive political rally whilst Biden conducts a 'Hula Hoop' competition.🤣👍🇬🇧
1328589684142968835 2020-11-17 14:43:59 +0800 <BainzyC> It's a Marxist issue!
1328587189299646465 2020-11-17 14:34:04 +0800 <BainzyC> I can Mr Neil, with 100% confidence, tell you, that in the very near future, you are going to eat those words.   Be careful not to choke on them.  Joe Biden may be the next long term resident at Gitmo, not Pennsylvania Avenue!
1328586123149516806 2020-11-17 14:29:50 +0800 <BainzyC> I wonder if anyone has ever shagged on the Space Station?  Now, there's a mission!🤣👍🇬🇧  Join The Out of This World Club, membership prices start at $10 million.
1328581798138437632 2020-11-17 14:12:39 +0800 <BainzyC> It will be a crisis caused by an attack by them, to the web.
1328580143493885958 2020-11-17 14:06:04 +0800 <BainzyC> It brought about The Rise of The Crankie!
1328579171405230080 2020-11-17 14:02:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Im looking forward to seeing how the #BBC &amp; the rest of the #ScumMedia are going to react when it is proven that #Biden cheated and Trump won by a landslide.  The near future might prove the end of Biden and all those that pushed for Trump to concede prematurely for a Biden steal
1328575558645673984 2020-11-17 13:47:51 +0800 <BainzyC> This is a big storey, there are pics of him on Biden's laptop with young children in compromising positions.  Start quivering Nancy, the truth is coming out!
1328573491239645184 2020-11-17 13:39:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Is he hiding from some bad news that is coming our way?
1328571764826365954 2020-11-17 13:32:47 +0800 <BainzyC> The British stiff upper lip has been diluted with too many foreign tongues!
1328571437502894081 2020-11-17 13:31:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Muppets
1328570403057512456 2020-11-17 13:27:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Plausible deniability when the fix is found out maybe?
1328564499381706752 2020-11-17 13:03:54 +0800 <BainzyC> Joey, Joey, they are coming for you Big Guy!
1328563207460581377 2020-11-17 12:58:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Scummy ideas the UK must reject always
1328562492277186560 2020-11-17 12:55:56 +0800 <BainzyC> Machines are not required to count votes, machines can be corrupted by corrupt people.
1328497394691006466 2020-11-17 08:37:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Concede Joe, before they come and get you  Tribunal Watch @tribunal_watch  " It would be beneficial for  @JoeBiden  to concede the race before he incriminates himself for widespread election fraud that could put him behind bars for the rest of his life.”  @RudyGiuliani
1328494859922120708 2020-11-17 08:27:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Tax-free charities and foundations are a fantastic way to launder money.
1328494453254991873 2020-11-17 08:25:34 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1328494254927327233 2020-11-17 08:24:47 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣 Clever boy!

1328469891050049537 2020-11-17 06:47:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Thank God, so many more babies will be saved 😉👍🇬🇧🍺
1328468779752448000 2020-11-17 06:43:33 +0800 <BainzyC> I feel the same!
1328468080515833857 2020-11-17 06:40:46 +0800 <BainzyC> He tried to plagiarise a presidency, not Trump's, he's not smart enough to do that!
1328467441064816644 2020-11-17 06:38:14 +0800 <BainzyC> Bloody colonials, sometimes they get a little bit too big for their boots! 🧐👍🇬🇧
1328467100671864833 2020-11-17 06:36:53 +0800 <BainzyC> This is Biden about 30 years ago.  Where did he get all his new hair from?  https://t.co/QccZnZhkoY
1328465246651080705 2020-11-17 06:29:31 +0800 <BainzyC> WHAT A FRAUD!  Lazy bastard.
1328464454015733763 2020-11-17 06:26:22 +0800 <BainzyC> They've been had, you can pick up a new none smart phone for £5. How many did they buy?
1328460017377439756 2020-11-17 06:08:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Be careful Ryan, or we will come back and evict you from the land you tenant from us 🤣👍🇬🇧
1328458643793174533 2020-11-17 06:03:16 +0800 <BainzyC> I used to beg the X wife to do that every night! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1328458282642649088 2020-11-17 06:01:50 +0800 <BainzyC> But that's as far as I got, I had to leave!
1328457577945067526 2020-11-17 05:59:02 +0800 <BainzyC> I like the booths in Qatar and the service, BA feels cheap and nasty, but it was what I was looking for.  https://t.co/LcjwA48fOm
1328455623105802242 2020-11-17 05:51:16 +0800 <BainzyC> For long haul I prefer Qatar, 1st is nice but business is more than acceptable.   I was thinking a more patriotic carrier being from the UK, our historical ties to OZ should be remembered always.
1328453687094759424 2020-11-17 05:43:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Anyway, enough of that, I need have to book a flight to OZ, what airline is best for a good deal?
1328452925077790720 2020-11-17 05:40:33 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm sure though that they have codes and secret words that they can identify each other with?
1328452246582013953 2020-11-17 05:37:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Only Freemasons know of Freemasonry, or should anyway!
1328451903051673602 2020-11-17 05:36:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Unfortunately, the certificate will be in you, we will be scanned like lost dogs!
1328451185641185283 2020-11-17 05:33:38 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍
1328451069744132099 2020-11-17 05:33:11 +0800 <BainzyC> On the right I think
1328450955474595841 2020-11-17 05:32:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Come on man, Commie Joe, wants your everything to give to the nothings, equality man, you know that thing, pay The Big Man and shut up!
1328450443836600321 2020-11-17 05:30:41 +0800 <BainzyC> Plastic surgery and then too long under the sun bed!
1328449579860320257 2020-11-17 05:27:15 +0800 <BainzyC> So many guys get caught knocking one out on zoom because they forget that other people can see them!  How embarrassing!  How would you explain it to the Church Crib Club?🧐🤣👍
1328448930774986753 2020-11-17 05:24:41 +0800 <BainzyC> The Freemasons are a secret society, anything written down that the public has access to is hearsay!
1328448348609777666 2020-11-17 05:22:22 +0800 <BainzyC> LADIES, LISTEN TO LUCYROSE5  She knows what she's talking about, burn those bras and undies.  PS Then DM me for my Zoom codes :)
1328447256668876806 2020-11-17 05:18:02 +0800 <BainzyC> I like boobies, probably one of God's best creations 🤣👍
1328446923087503371 2020-11-17 05:16:42 +0800 <BainzyC> From the now-bankrupt brand 'Passion Killer' 🤣👍
1328446182692171786 2020-11-17 05:13:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Simple maths  7,500,000,000 x 25 = £187,500,000,000  £187.5 billion   Not worth getting out of bed for, it will be more than twice a year I think, I also think it will mutate to boost revenues.
1328444952293019651 2020-11-17 05:08:52 +0800 <BainzyC> He follows me!  VACANT  One follower space, must be a Conservative, #Brexiteer or #Trump supporter. Press FOLLOW now.
1328443803968163840 2020-11-17 05:04:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Are you mad? Cancer is a multi-billion ££ industry, why would you want to cure your customers? Der!!!!🧐
1328443253209894912 2020-11-17 05:02:07 +0800 <BainzyC> I cannot get the verification code from Rumble, I've tried many times
1328443013060845571 2020-11-17 05:01:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Our leaders are making it out like it's our fault and that we are not victims to A China Virus but victims of our day to day life!
1328441981794709506 2020-11-17 04:57:04 +0800 <BainzyC> itchy but warm.
1328440796819951616 2020-11-17 04:52:21 +0800 <BainzyC> The flag was rescued from the terrorist, it was silenced and disarmed. Job done!
1328440165061120002 2020-11-17 04:49:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Only 1 on there deserves it, the others....no comment!
1328439739188449280 2020-11-17 04:48:09 +0800 <BainzyC> Auto
1328439266389741568 2020-11-17 04:46:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Go, Trump!   Leave no survivors, your time to heal America for good is almost here.
1328437878888820738 2020-11-17 04:40:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Good sanitation helped rid the world from the Plague too, sanitation is the key to good human health.
1328437531092918272 2020-11-17 04:39:23 +0800 <BainzyC> The Sun and The Star don't count, page 3 used to be good!🤣👍🇬🇧
1328436923816349697 2020-11-17 04:36:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Plenty of common rif raf in the Lords!
1328436587391291394 2020-11-17 04:35:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Or made us all infertile, the end of us all...
1328436036054212610 2020-11-17 04:33:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Such an arrogant twat
1328433377502957569 2020-11-17 04:22:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Is a nation's heritage a fair sacrifice for diversity?
1328432236371308546 2020-11-17 04:18:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Following meetings with the WEF regarding, The Great Reset?
1328431309077798913 2020-11-17 04:14:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Gold has always been a source of value, however, if everything becomes digital credits it will only be used for jewellery and industry.
1328430489158479880 2020-11-17 04:11:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Liar, you are using it to try to steal the world!

1328425472632479749 2020-11-17 03:51:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Best flat packs, easier to carry
1328423495936651265 2020-11-17 03:43:37 +0800 <BainzyC> That's Joe's Plan, get the money, it's all about the green man!
1328423140234563592 2020-11-17 03:42:12 +0800 <BainzyC> It would not be allowed, the only thing stopping it not being now is Trump! If he falls, #Brexit and the world are likely to follow.  The Great Reset must consume everything and everyone to work.
1328421349652647938 2020-11-17 03:35:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Tic tok Pervy Joe, ask your kiddies if your legs will look good in orange?
1328420996618063879 2020-11-17 03:33:41 +0800 <BainzyC> She is not one to mess with!
1328420791218802691 2020-11-17 03:32:52 +0800 <BainzyC> I agree, but unlike some, I do not want to jump the gun, so I say wait for the recount and the law to decide, as it should be if there are any disputes, just like it did for Gore and Bush in 2000!  Then the #ScumMedia called Gore President Gore before he won, where's he now?🤣👍
1328419314593107972 2020-11-17 03:27:00 +0800 <BainzyC> As a fisher's wife, doesn't that pay her any benefits? 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1328419026217947136 2020-11-17 03:25:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Do you know who baldy is, and what he is up to?
1328418480979402753 2020-11-17 03:23:41 +0800 <BainzyC> No, Trump suspected it months ago!
1328418281649299456 2020-11-17 03:22:53 +0800 <BainzyC> A retirement vacation at Her Majesty's Hotel in Wandsworth maybe?
1328417910700838918 2020-11-17 03:21:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Give it an hour or too then I'll change it to suit me
1328417402649006081 2020-11-17 03:19:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Joe Biden is doing to win a prison cell, nothing more!
1328417145361985537 2020-11-17 03:18:22 +0800 <BainzyC> It was planned from the day your father won, every slander, every jibe, every false allegation and everything else all designed to try and swing votes against him.

1328415466403016715 2020-11-17 03:11:42 +0800 <BainzyC> If you live that long, I reckon cut off age will be 70 then decrease as time goes on.
1328415134763655174 2020-11-17 03:10:23 +0800 <BainzyC> The best versatile tradable items you can carry a stock of if the shit hits the fan: Small bottles of spirits Rolling tobacco Papers Tins of fish Multi-vitamins Water cleaning tabs Pain killers Razor blades Antiseptic wipes Plasters and bandages  Anything else, hide it very well.

1328413588885745681 2020-11-17 03:04:14 +0800 <BainzyC> The only way to test it is to inject 100 random people and see how many die!
1328413391568908288 2020-11-17 03:03:27 +0800 <BainzyC> The satanic paedophile cult that Trump wants rid of is a myth, however, so many cases are turning up, it's hard NOT to say that out loud without it ringing true.
1328412728386588674 2020-11-17 03:00:49 +0800 <BainzyC> The Dems have declared WAR on Trump supporters, antifa and BLM should be captured and kept as Prisoners of War!
1328412363385671680 2020-11-17 02:59:22 +0800 <BainzyC> £1k a month if we are lucky, enough to survive not to thrive!

1328392389548007424 2020-11-17 01:40:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Very weird, in Feb 2020 my doc's surgery told us that vaccines for pneumonia were not getting through to them and they doubt they would have any for 2020.  This was before the pandemic.  Now looking back, feels like they knew it was coming and wanted maximum ill or death numbers!
1328391097492631558 2020-11-17 01:34:52 +0800 <BainzyC> How are you going to feel when your family 3bed house, which is already a tight squeeze, is delegated as under-occupied and needs to be shared with 4 other families.   Can't see that happening?  Nor could the Russians!  But it did and could well happen to you.
1328389942091919360 2020-11-17 01:30:17 +0800 <BainzyC> She has earned her immaculate credibility!
1328389403958456320 2020-11-17 01:28:08 +0800 <BainzyC> I fear that the new UK national dish that will be served up soon will be 'Vaccine &amp; Chips'.  https://t.co/u4kJRW60K0
1328388899551449090 2020-11-17 01:26:08 +0800 <BainzyC> If it was a fair fight no problem, but sucker punching from behind whilst the victim was being harassed by multiple assailants is just about as low as you can go.  I hope his rusty sheriff's badge ends up looking like a beef tomato during his time inside.
1328387388847116290 2020-11-17 01:20:08 +0800 <BainzyC> It's bloody brilliant being British! 🍺👍😉👍🍺🇬🇧  https://t.co/m7drncASa6
1328386735743655938 2020-11-17 01:17:32 +0800 <BainzyC> The New Green Deal/The Great Reset/The NWO Takeover will not distinguish between rich &amp; poor, just rule givers and rule takes, the ability to affect those rules will be stripped from mankind.   “Ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs” Barack Obama
1328384893064269827 2020-11-17 01:10:13 +0800 <BainzyC> If you admit you have a Mental Health Issue, you immediately lose your rights, the police can take you from anywhere without a warrant and can detain you indefinitely.  They are selling it right now, they just want an excuse to nab you!

1328383553009315840 2020-11-17 01:04:53 +0800 <BainzyC> The Race Act is only given the force of law if you are white dumb, dumb! Where have you been for the last decade?🧐
1328381997782327297 2020-11-17 00:58:43 +0800 <BainzyC> The UK is The World's GREEN and Pleasant Land, she hardly omits anything, compared to other commercialised countries.

1328376499041427457 2020-11-17 00:36:52 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm an official source because I'm from the internet!
1328375881551765506 2020-11-17 00:34:24 +0800 <BainzyC> We are witnessing the EU crumble, as soon as the UK straw is pulled...Ka'Plunk!
1328375495050792965 2020-11-17 00:32:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Rightly so!
1328372804954316802 2020-11-17 00:22:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Whenever I got pissed when I was out in London and got on the tube, I'd always end up there, far away from Chelsea and more than a few quid taxi fare home.  Never actually looked around that place, I always saw it as a trap!😎👍🧐🇬🇧🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺
1328371843519180801 2020-11-17 00:18:22 +0800 <BainzyC> More excuse for the EU to move on in their plan to eliminate separate state opinions, they want the full authority to make all decisions for all the states in the EU. No oversight!
1328366324226138118 2020-11-16 23:56:26 +0800 <BainzyC> You should not have removed your paper bag 🤣👍

1328344035564654592 2020-11-16 22:27:52 +0800 <BainzyC> It is not acceptable within our Christian country, it is a hideous practice that is not recognised in any civilised country.   Criminals who practice it should be cast into the sea, far away from our shores!
1328343368246685702 2020-11-16 22:25:13 +0800 <BainzyC> And they always leave a natural trail, if there is no obvious trail, anomalies will help find it.
1328342871179743233 2020-11-16 22:23:14 +0800 <BainzyC> And their mother's souls if they refuse.  Abortion is murder.   If you are a murderer, your soul is in danger of eternal torment, unlike here on earth, there is NO NEGOTIATION on that when you die, is it worth the risk?  #AbortionIsMurder
1328341840739917824 2020-11-16 22:19:08 +0800 <BainzyC> @OANN we need a truthful news network in the UK.  News networks that only report, and don't give their bias opinions, is a real growth industry, as people lose faith in the mainstream #ScumMedia and their lies and distorted facts.  https://t.co/ojXBEQC1Cy

1328323393142321154 2020-11-16 21:05:50 +0800 <BainzyC> B Liar! is the worst, he makes my skin crawl, the blood on his hands should have silenced him forever at The Hague!

1328303461864189955 2020-11-16 19:46:38 +0800 <BainzyC> I always wanted Giant Haystacks to win because Big Daddy had such a gay name. That's how we thought in those days 😎   Mind you, I still think I would think twice dealing with any bloke today called Shirley, it just doesn't have the correct ring to it.
1328298751119777793 2020-11-16 19:27:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Same old same old, we get these warnings everyday from some rag or another.
1328297445084827648 2020-11-16 19:22:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Our economy has been practically destroyed, 'can't afford' has not been allowed to be used as an excuse, the country cannot afford to be locked down but it is.
1328286385225289728 2020-11-16 18:38:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Too right, the scum bags are really taking advantage of us as we are cut out and silenced with the face rag!
1328282898752004097 2020-11-16 18:24:56 +0800 <BainzyC> We are bonkers, now do the sums from the day we voted to leave in 2016...

1328276286628880388 2020-11-16 17:58:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Ms Hitler has to go, the Hitlers have never been good for Germany, they start off well but end up getting greedy, just like the Napoleons in France. Bad idea!

1328269485468504064 2020-11-16 17:31:38 +0800 <BainzyC> It is certainly very annoying and makes people instantly opposed to whoever is doing it and whatever entity they represent.
1328144873388699649 2020-11-16 09:16:28 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm a well-travelled experienced person and I'm a Lord, lol 🧐😊👍🇬🇧

1328140720981553152 2020-11-16 08:59:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Our success will mean the failure of the EU. 4 those that are obviously not so clear about the situation, if the EU doesn't punish the UK 4 leaving, itself will be punished. We must not just leave 010121 we should run as far away from it as we can, we cannot be collateral damage!

1328133264763203584 2020-11-16 08:30:20 +0800 <BainzyC> During the US election2020 postal votes were used as a smokescreen, the real steal came from in the voting machines themselves that were coded to change the results on demand.  Stalin said 'He who counts the votes, wins'.  Have the Dems gone full commie?
1328132145760645120 2020-11-16 08:25:53 +0800 <BainzyC> COVID19 has decimated the WeWork type, shared office model now that humans scare other humans just by being close to each other.
1328130954347548673 2020-11-16 08:21:09 +0800 <BainzyC> I've been tempted so many times to do that after a glass or two, but memories of mates getting their crown jewels mashed stopped me
1328129959546793984 2020-11-16 08:17:12 +0800 <BainzyC> They took it down but I saw it  https://t.co/7XLauG57tV

1328128150304415745 2020-11-16 08:10:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Before the US election is finally called, I think I may start a new business manufacturing a product that will be in much demand by the #ScumMedia after it has been officially called and decided.   Only thing is, I'm lacking the recipe for Humble Pie!🧐
1328125562976690178 2020-11-16 07:59:44 +0800 <BainzyC> I was quite surprised when no one shouted 'TIMBER'! the way the knife-wielder went down! 🤣👍🇬🇧

1328110400068612098 2020-11-16 06:59:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Go to 0.30 for 'The Felling' 🤣  Pulling knives is a bad idea.
1328109429095608320 2020-11-16 06:55:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Who are 'They' Gary? British people who have an opinion, or in your opinion something else.  Have you drawn battle lines, if so, which side are you on and what do your lot represent?
1328108646195146752 2020-11-16 06:52:30 +0800 <BainzyC> Currently, corporations call the shots!

1328101159593271296 2020-11-16 06:22:46 +0800 <BainzyC> @Berumster His Guardian, (or Sugar Daddy to the 'Woke' wonders) has deserted him. No loyalty on the left, just for the moment, HATE gratification is all that is required from them. Obviously, his bile became too sweet. 🤣👍

1328096093796757510 2020-11-16 06:02:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Not only that, with thriving farming communities, our youth can rebuild our small towns and villages, bring the British back to the farms, it's a very honourable, sustainable sector to work in, healthy too, plus fun and farm girls, cider and rolls in the hay! 😊😎👍🇬🇧🍺
1328095122911850501 2020-11-16 05:58:46 +0800 <BainzyC> At that age, if a kid in my class wore that, he would never be able to show his face again? Why? We were taught boundaries. Now the Marxists want no boundaries is it correct or are we being forced to believe it is correct. I think much more debate on the subject is required!
1328093808802848768 2020-11-16 05:53:33 +0800 <BainzyC> His chickens will come home to roost one day soon!
1328093461791334404 2020-11-16 05:52:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes, it is, it will also keep UK money in the UK!
1328088691693260802 2020-11-16 05:33:13 +0800 <BainzyC> It might be true, look down the High Streets of every town in the UK, where are all the white people gone?
1328070160553562112 2020-11-16 04:19:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Not if we became a Marxist Socialist country which is what the looney left want, no private property for Marcus or anyone else, no one can have more than anyone else, diversity and equality, that's that full-blown..
1328067892676538370 2020-11-16 04:10:34 +0800 <BainzyC> He will regret that because he will have to pay for it!
1328065673046749188 2020-11-16 04:01:45 +0800 <BainzyC> #ScumMedia would say 'A few' if they could fake the angles!
1328062853929177091 2020-11-16 03:50:33 +0800 <BainzyC> The less money the poor have the more available for him!
1328062414538072065 2020-11-16 03:48:48 +0800 <BainzyC> They are using 'reverse advertising', spending money to lose customers, a 'woke' business policy I expect!
1328054117776941059 2020-11-16 03:15:50 +0800 <BainzyC> The money is leaving, it's not CV19 its Dem taxes/policies and lawlessness.
1328040789470015490 2020-11-16 02:22:52 +0800 <BainzyC> We can exploit our fisheries and offer very attractive packages to bail our businesses, that, and relaxing regulations, should put more than a bit into the treasury!
1328032707423727619 2020-11-16 01:50:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Great Danes!😎👍🇬🇧

1327980682681966594 2020-11-15 22:24:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Some do, but many men are shut out by the newer family unit made after separations.

I think better than me? Equal us out old boy!
1327972869083697155 2020-11-15 21:52:59 +0800 <BainzyC> When ballot discrepancies cannot be checked, democracy is void. Truth and fact should always win, no matter what!
1327971603557322752 2020-11-15 21:47:57 +0800 <BainzyC> It's not over yet, just one word.....GORE!
1327971303861710853 2020-11-15 21:46:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Justin or Boris speaking here? If I close my eyes I hear the same words but with different accents.

1327933019127238656 2020-11-15 19:14:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Nigel Farage should have gone for it before but now he could be more important, would he become a Tory again to do it?
1327931150619164672 2020-11-15 19:07:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Lefty with words, Tory in actions!
1327930883698028544 2020-11-15 19:06:09 +0800 <BainzyC> Only if you don't AirBNB them!
1327930623013629953 2020-11-15 19:05:06 +0800 <BainzyC> And the money to pay for it will mostly come from the working-class poor. The Left doesn't care where it comes from as long as they don't have to suffer a significant loss.
1327928289042821121 2020-11-15 18:55:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Exposure?

1327925419073474560 2020-11-15 18:44:26 +0800 <BainzyC> How many of those weak cowards did it take to take out, by sucker punch, that brave patriot?  If I was BLM or antifa I would be so embarrassed of my troops, such weaklings!
1327921933539811328 2020-11-15 18:30:35 +0800 <BainzyC> 1000s according to the #BBC #ScumMedia here in the UK. 🤢🤮🤬
1327921473936297985 2020-11-15 18:28:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Only the UK uses Sterling. Where have you been for the last half a decade+? This is an asshole question, the UK leaves the transition period in a few weeks. Why would we want to join when we haven't fully left yet? You Sir, are in denial, I suggest you go see a brain doc. #Brexit
1327919150598156291 2020-11-15 18:19:31 +0800 <BainzyC> We should not worry about the Biden threats, when we voted in 2016, Obama who was in power told us we would be at the back of their queue.Politics change, as an independent nation we must not think that we have to rely on the EU or the USA, in many cases, they rely on us! #Brexit
1327917109742096385 2020-11-15 18:11:25 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm awake! If only I was lovely. 😶

1327878843961630720 2020-11-15 15:39:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Old Xi must be cumming in his pants at the thought of Biden replacing Trump!
1327878114588958720 2020-11-15 15:36:27 +0800 <BainzyC> 20 votes there, could do a lot of good for ~Trump!

1327680029979979776 2020-11-15 02:29:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Antifa and BLM are not attacking Trump Supporters when they out in force, pooing pants going on now I should think!
1327679270139928577 2020-11-15 02:26:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump is resourceful, I would not write him off, many have before, at their peril

1327552895278084096 2020-11-14 18:04:09 +0800 <BainzyC> If #Boris does betray the UK it will be the last time the UK ever is, after that we will be under the control of whoever is controlling The Great Reset, and that will be forever.

1327545161887444993 2020-11-14 17:33:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Once they get the source codes off that server they will tell them everything, let's hope they never deleted it or they kept good backups. Spain &amp; Germany reading US votes?  The EU hate Trump, how could that ever happen. It must stop, the US should count US votes don't you think?

1327340904680656903 2020-11-14 04:01:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Kids + BBC = Jimmy Saville types
1327340364785651714 2020-11-14 03:59:38 +0800 <BainzyC> So much money being thrown around because of COVID, almost as if it's going out of fashion. . . Maybe it is? Maybe money will be different after The Great Reset?  That would explain a great deal!

1326931777869516801 2020-11-13 00:56:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Gag the old fool someone, please!

1326930853721747457 2020-11-13 00:52:23 +0800 <BainzyC> They must have vested interests in Biden to keep the fraud going for so long, twitter knows Trump wants their ass on a plate!
1326930497415602178 2020-11-13 00:50:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump: ''Biden, this is MY HOUSE'' Biden: ''C'mon man....EEk!'' 🤣👍🇬🇧

1326929163631153154 2020-11-13 00:45:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Of course it's disputed, if they owned up to election fraud lots and lots and lots of people will end up in jail.  https://t.co/Dg830JKYpz
1326925858297286657 2020-11-13 00:32:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Will there be any comeback for the #ScumMedia if widespread fraud is discovered?  If not, why not?  They have falsely let the world, non-stop!
1326925070212734979 2020-11-13 00:29:24 +0800 <BainzyC> When Boris went into ICU with COVID did he die and was he replaced?  Asking for a friend

1326898434092232710 2020-11-12 22:43:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Kammie you had better wake up now and run to the hills before Trump appears in your nightmares to rudely awake you.
1326897714844610563 2020-11-12 22:40:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Euromillion lottery, 3 numbers + 1 lucky number, a measly £7.50 😟  I had better ring Rolls Royce and cancel!

1326894961271463936 2020-11-12 22:29:45 +0800 <BainzyC> We should have done that in June 2016, all the time, money and opportunities we have lost so far is staggering!
1326894689077907457 2020-11-12 22:28:41 +0800 <BainzyC> An attempted coup that will fail!
1326894087140675588 2020-11-12 22:26:17 +0800 <BainzyC> The whole World is with you, except the cheating Dems!
1326893636458569728 2020-11-12 22:24:30 +0800 <BainzyC> The tide is turning and the Biden ship is becoming stranded on to the rocks it set Trump's ship's GPS to crash into.  Never trust tech Joe, especially if Hillary has been anywhere near it 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326892659533869063 2020-11-12 22:20:37 +0800 <BainzyC> With 6 states yet to imply a winner!
1326889947803086849 2020-11-12 22:09:50 +0800 <BainzyC> It's the murder of the evilest kind, ripping apart little humans when they are at their most vulnerable by the only person who can protect them, is the work of the cruellest beasts amongst us.  One thing is for sure, they won't meet their victims in Heaven, no way José. #Murder
1326888443692150785 2020-11-12 22:03:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Stolen valour?
1326887702340509696 2020-11-12 22:00:55 +0800 <BainzyC> @BBCNews, The British People hate you! How did that happen? You used to be so respectable.   I think the day the people destroy you, there will be parties in the streets.
1326884742432698370 2020-11-12 21:49:09 +0800 <BainzyC> The World!
1326878983561097218 2020-11-12 21:26:16 +0800 <BainzyC> i don't trust people with Big Ears
1326876021203865600 2020-11-12 21:14:30 +0800 <BainzyC> I went to the same chemist, I asked her for 99 condoms, she looked at me in astonishment and said   ''Fuck me''  ''Make that 100''    I said. 😎
1326874934015111168 2020-11-12 21:10:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Heated discussion and squabbling happen whenever groups of people work together, if we all agreed on everything, what a boring species we would be.
1326874145976619011 2020-11-12 21:07:03 +0800 <BainzyC> That's why he is such a big girl's blouse, he has never had to fend for himself...... And he gives advise?😂👍
1326873782787710976 2020-11-12 21:05:36 +0800 <BainzyC> I would too, the USA needs a political bath.
1326873196734390275 2020-11-12 21:03:16 +0800 <BainzyC> There is no president elect yet
1326823505191702528 2020-11-12 17:45:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Jealousy, they say whites rule the world but we are only a small minority, it's not our fault we tend to excel, it's in our genes.
1326820458180841473 2020-11-12 17:33:43 +0800 <BainzyC> It would be helpful having the US as a trading partner but we can do without a special deal, we manage quite well with them without one.
1326819983251410949 2020-11-12 17:31:49 +0800 <BainzyC> The problem with Femi is that he hates being black, so he blames the whites instead of his mummy.
1326819530618904576 2020-11-12 17:30:01 +0800 <BainzyC> A wannabe imposter did, however, his father is English😂👍🇬🇧
1326812433135128578 2020-11-12 17:01:49 +0800 <BainzyC> What Brexiteers said that Femi? Or are you LYING AGAIN?  Prove your statements or they are just as laughable as this one.
1326790771048148992 2020-11-12 15:35:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Doomsday for tictoc in the US today as trump's deadline to flog it runs out.
1326788020322914307 2020-11-12 15:24:49 +0800 <BainzyC> TRUTH!

1326786629944700928 2020-11-12 15:19:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Has been for a while now
1326786435375108098 2020-11-12 15:18:31 +0800 <BainzyC> And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is 666. See it in the logo?  https://t.co/H7VWemqUOp
1326784519131832322 2020-11-12 15:10:54 +0800 <BainzyC> Before COVID it was Brexit, before that Trump, they need a bogeyman to provide us with constant, crappy, cheap shitty TV.
1326782894254256130 2020-11-12 15:04:27 +0800 <BainzyC> At the moment its only hot air, Trump is still in charge!
1326782376291299330 2020-11-12 15:02:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes I know that, they own a lot more, they renamed their parent company to alphabet because they control A to Z
1326781936262582274 2020-11-12 15:00:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Bravado!   He must have hit the Guinness? 😂🍺👍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
1326779809914114049 2020-11-12 14:52:11 +0800 <BainzyC> They have the tech to close us all down. Just look at youtube today.
1326779195171753986 2020-11-12 14:49:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Must be a typo, he is 41
1326775275376533504 2020-11-12 14:34:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Looks can be very deceptive, she looks like one of those NHS angels we hear so much about.  We didn't see her on tictoc, she was too busy! 🤢🤮🤬
1326774768008388609 2020-11-12 14:32:09 +0800 <BainzyC> Good morning little chilly one 😎👍🇬🇧
1326773382873047041 2020-11-12 14:26:39 +0800 <BainzyC> I prefer it, must be my British blood, hot weather does not agree too much with me, it's easier to warm up than to cool down.  If you need to warm up Titch, I'm a little oven 😉👍🇬🇧🍺
1326772731598299143 2020-11-12 14:24:04 +0800 <BainzyC> They've got you well trained 😂👍🇬🇧
1326771906004070403 2020-11-12 14:20:47 +0800 <BainzyC> You've missed the point completely, read it again, if you don't get it, go back to school....
1326771439417118721 2020-11-12 14:18:56 +0800 <BainzyC> If only....
1326770175094484998 2020-11-12 14:13:54 +0800 <BainzyC> On the ballot papers, there were options for other positions apart from the president, 100s of 1000s of ballots found to be fraudulent only showed presidential choice, this has only occurred on postal ballots which are 99.99% for Biden.  A very clear indication of fraud!
1326768669981102081 2020-11-12 14:07:55 +0800 <BainzyC> No, it's not, it's socialism

1326758965741576193 2020-11-12 13:29:22 +0800 <BainzyC> I think you mean 41 not 14, obviously a typo!

1326754435800969217 2020-11-12 13:11:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump told the truth yet they labelled him a liar, this liar they call truthful!

1326661802684506112 2020-11-12 07:03:16 +0800 <BainzyC> A pound of silver used to be £1 now its £156.18
1326660804729593856 2020-11-12 06:59:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Is that where the UK's 'Deal Money' will end up?  Keeping fat twats in the lap of luxury?
1326659455648493571 2020-11-12 06:53:57 +0800 <BainzyC> £5k would buy you a 3-bed house in London, a nice part.
1326659133769199624 2020-11-12 06:52:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes, after the calculator, it all went downhill. 🧐😂👍
1326658103820087296 2020-11-12 06:48:34 +0800 <BainzyC> I can't, I'll get sad... It's worth bugger all now!
1326657778451144706 2020-11-12 06:47:17 +0800 <BainzyC> I had an Indian girlfriend (a Singh) for 7 years in the 90's I saw and felt it too then.   The only racism in 2020 is propaganda.

1326654490003582978 2020-11-12 06:34:13 +0800 <BainzyC> They should not be allowed to benefit from that!
1326653933704650754 2020-11-12 06:32:00 +0800 <BainzyC> It's palpable!
1326653547358941193 2020-11-12 06:30:28 +0800 <BainzyC> For over 300 years they have been planning to take the world, now they are planted so deep into every aspect of our lives that they cannot all be found.  Even the big bosses, they are under oath to fulfil the agenda even if they don't personally benefit. It is a global cult.
1326651659045515266 2020-11-12 06:22:58 +0800 <BainzyC> And them to be vetted carefully, any one with extreme political views not allowed to count.

1326634154075762697 2020-11-12 05:13:24 +0800 <BainzyC> I want to go back to live in the UK year 1920
1326633707302739969 2020-11-12 05:11:38 +0800 <BainzyC> no comment apart from no comment!
1326632571766181889 2020-11-12 05:07:07 +0800 <BainzyC> So is Arnie...
1326630912809988098 2020-11-12 05:00:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Too late in the UK, they have seized all the mayor's jobs in all our cities
1326630425389887497 2020-11-12 04:58:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Anything in common there?  Local government is being stolen, and the power that goes with it!
1326630091368132609 2020-11-12 04:57:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Whilst bigging up the NHS they are destroying it in the background.
1326629741034614784 2020-11-12 04:55:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Best thing I ever did
1326629397441425409 2020-11-12 04:54:30 +0800 <BainzyC> Go woke, go broke!
1326629110265810944 2020-11-12 04:53:22 +0800 <BainzyC> I ripped my TV off the wall and threw it out the window a decade ago in a fit of anger!
1326628698641100800 2020-11-12 04:51:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Everything digital leaves a trail, how on earth did they think they could get away with it?My theory is that they would use the MSM to force Trump to concede.They have learned nothing, Trump does not give in and Trump does not like getting nicked from.Trump is on the warpath now!
1326626790278909959 2020-11-12 04:44:08 +0800 <BainzyC> RT like crazy
1326624786089463809 2020-11-12 04:36:11 +0800 <BainzyC> When I see this guy I always get the feeling that they are using him and his lovely nature.
1326623941264363522 2020-11-12 04:32:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Here it is folks, this is the cure to C19, the chip to enslave you.
1326623153636995073 2020-11-12 04:29:41 +0800 <BainzyC> I have already, I'm no worse off!
1326622312205004802 2020-11-12 04:26:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Who has the most power?
1326621942657507329 2020-11-12 04:24:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump did win! He just has to prove it.
1326621780807725058 2020-11-12 04:24:14 +0800 <BainzyC> Salute that man!
1326620558985998345 2020-11-12 04:19:23 +0800 <BainzyC> At our expense, let's give it to them and turn off!
1326618819717197825 2020-11-12 04:12:28 +0800 <BainzyC> He doesn't look like Bob The Builder!
1326617996639526912 2020-11-12 04:09:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Let them have their own league, let them build their own stadiums, let them invest in their own game, that's better, then, then they can't keep telling us how shit white people's stuff is. I'm bored of this shit, it's destroying everything!
1326617055752314881 2020-11-12 04:05:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Is she off Seasame Street?😂👍😉🇬🇧

1326612458690277376 2020-11-12 03:47:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Imprisoned!
1326612307946901505 2020-11-12 03:46:36 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't normally watch infowars but what they say here is all based on actual events. We all witnessed it..
1326610517360861191 2020-11-12 03:39:29 +0800 <BainzyC> His electoral tally is growing as Biden's shrinks, the real will of the American People is being uncovered.
1326610247130222593 2020-11-12 03:38:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Attempted......!
1326610104389693447 2020-11-12 03:37:50 +0800 <BainzyC> It is, globally! If they are not scared to do it to a guy like Trump, we all mean nothing at all.
1326609856263049217 2020-11-12 03:36:51 +0800 <BainzyC> I love that guy! (not in a gay way).

1326609311569752065 2020-11-12 03:34:41 +0800 <BainzyC> What do you call a cat with no legs?
1326609162797805573 2020-11-12 03:34:06 +0800 <BainzyC> A mandate to heal America! &amp; hopefully, the rest of the world because of!
1326608004888879109 2020-11-12 03:29:30 +0800 <BainzyC> Did he get an answer?
1326606730344722435 2020-11-12 03:24:26 +0800 <BainzyC> The vaccine if fears are to be believed, will change our DNA and contain a chip.  If we change our DNA we will no longer be 100% human, the legal ramifications of that are immense, no private property, no inheritance, we will be just like cattle, domestic cattle, maybe even food!
1326605684922871809 2020-11-12 03:20:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Please, please, please Diane, give us the numerical longitude and latitude of the location of The Global South, wait one minute, I want to get comfortable, I feel a peal of hysterical laughter about to happen. 🤣👍🤪🇬🇧
1326604692072357890 2020-11-12 03:16:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Real hard guys!
1326603911545958402 2020-11-12 03:13:14 +0800 <BainzyC> How about Saudi Arabia, they have interesting LGBT+ policies?
1326600978213310464 2020-11-12 03:01:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Because they did not want to win?
1326600761841692672 2020-11-12 03:00:43 +0800 <BainzyC> No one is safe from it 🤪👍
1326592420268699648 2020-11-12 02:27:34 +0800 <BainzyC> We need all our kids like her!
1326589348121284609 2020-11-12 02:15:22 +0800 <BainzyC> As Joe let slip!
1326584302696599553 2020-11-12 01:55:19 +0800 <BainzyC> It will get a lot worse than this when Trump's results come back
1326583878178529280 2020-11-12 01:53:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Must try this at home 🤪👍🤣
1326582159776370689 2020-11-12 01:46:48 +0800 <BainzyC> Watch it if you can spare the time, better than Eastenders and all that crap
1326579888745304071 2020-11-12 01:37:46 +0800 <BainzyC> yeah right!!!! 🤬
1326578572581023745 2020-11-12 01:32:32 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣
1326546789088911363 2020-11-11 23:26:15 +0800 <BainzyC> That is what we should be hearing all over our nation today and every day, not foreign noises from places spewing foreign words to foreign gods.
1326546241191211013 2020-11-11 23:24:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Put refugees in them and park them in international waters
1326544006688301056 2020-11-11 23:15:11 +0800 <BainzyC> He should take it all the way, he has a mission HE needs to finish, Pence does not have the charisma of Trump.
1326543267735826439 2020-11-11 23:12:15 +0800 <BainzyC> It always seems to be women that come up with these vile ideas. Whatever happened to the fairer sex?

1326540348521263116 2020-11-11 23:00:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Some people are attracted to sheep, there is an interesting thread on here regarding that subject. You can not alienate the Welsh. 🤪👍🇬🇧
1326539522323066883 2020-11-11 22:57:22 +0800 <BainzyC> 'Bumming' 🤣 I don't think if have heard that word since I was at school. Sorry Danny, bumming is part of the job description, bend down &amp; think of England, I've heard if you drink coconut milk, it takes your mind of it. I cannot verify that, I have never taken part in that stuff
1326532706964967424 2020-11-11 22:30:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Bend down to see The Golden Rivet!🤣👍🇬🇧
1326531990238064640 2020-11-11 22:27:26 +0800 <BainzyC> White men don't matter anymore in the UK, we've lost the country!
1326531621852340227 2020-11-11 22:25:59 +0800 <BainzyC> A disgrace, making a mockery of our heroes!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

1326483601396015108 2020-11-11 19:15:10 +0800 <BainzyC> No, we want war with them! 🧐  We Brits. won that peace, it had nothing to do with the EU, the EU did not exist, we and the Yanks put them in line and forced peace.
1326480801312202754 2020-11-11 19:04:02 +0800 <BainzyC> I can't help shed a tear when I hear The Last Post!😪🇬🇧
1326479475224301569 2020-11-11 18:58:46 +0800 <BainzyC> In yer dreams, you gotta earn them! 🤣  When I was over the Chinese were buying everything, especially the property hotspots like Surfers Paradise and the Sydney suburbs.
1326478925590122496 2020-11-11 18:56:35 +0800 <BainzyC> 😪🇬🇧 Sooo many of our very best went the same way!

1326475457127124997 2020-11-11 18:42:48 +0800 <BainzyC> I spent 18 months over there, I got kicked out for working without the correct visa...I'll be back one day, I want to mine gold.  We should have left all the convicts on this rock and all gone there, I think our predecessors dropped the ball.👍🇬🇧🍺
1326473258892472321 2020-11-11 18:34:04 +0800 <BainzyC> There are far uglier animals to shag than sheep, camels-yuck, a giraffe - a challenge, a skunk - rather you than me. I could go on but my coffee is finished! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺  You're a good sport! 🍺
1326472312128999427 2020-11-11 18:30:18 +0800 <BainzyC> A POM or POM'E is an acronym meaning 'Prisoner Of Mother England' only English folks in Oz should really be called that.   However, I'm not the pedantic sort, so I'll let it rest this time, Yer bloody crim. 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺  Cheers!🍺

1326468836795756544 2020-11-11 18:16:29 +0800 <BainzyC> I may even end my recently acquired🧐👍🍺🇬🇧 twatter addiction.
1326468180471123969 2020-11-11 18:13:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Spot on JC M, I've only just come to the UK after 15 years away, I just cannot believe the way people have been subdued to be spineless, miserable PC drones. Me, I don't give a shit, if I get nicked and jailed I will look on the bright side, no rent, free food and TV all day!
1326467241878171648 2020-11-11 18:10:09 +0800 <BainzyC> No, nearly.......... A Vark! 🤪👍🍺🇬🇧
1326466204232454144 2020-11-11 18:06:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Personally, I don't think we should, I think they should be kept personal and private, but I'm a bit Old School.  I can see why people do, I mean how on earth are you gonna get yer hands into Larry The Lamb's wool if he doesn't know you fancy him? 🧐🤪👍🇬🇧🍺
1326465386649444354 2020-11-11 18:02:47 +0800 <BainzyC> What do you call an Aardvark that's been beaten in a fight?
1326464615639822340 2020-11-11 17:59:43 +0800 <BainzyC> What is hateful about discussing sexual preferences?   Nowadays, very few conversations wander above the waist....
1326463542304923649 2020-11-11 17:55:27 +0800 <BainzyC> @alastairdick I have nothing against it, but you wouldn't want an ugly one! 🧐👍🍺
1326462948471156738 2020-11-11 17:53:06 +0800 <BainzyC> The results are not in on that yet, you may have to wait sometime, even then you may have to wait some more time, depending on whether I like the result.  In the meantime, you can stick that finger up yer bum!
1326461918748479488 2020-11-11 17:49:00 +0800 <BainzyC> A question for all 'Woke'  If I call a Welshman a Sheep Shagger am I

1326458871964119040 2020-11-11 17:36:54 +0800 <BainzyC> Not Sheep Shagger? 🤣👍🇬🇧🍺
1326454943495163904 2020-11-11 17:21:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Twitter is a spy machine, we should all be careful about answering questions like this, we might start to get visitors at our homes with handfuls of needles and guns.
1326453817307697152 2020-11-11 17:16:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't worry, I'm sure they will think something up!
1326453525568774144 2020-11-11 17:15:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Didn't she do well!  https://t.co/ULxtkA9fWI
1326441867442065408 2020-11-11 16:29:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Phew, that puts my mind at rest!  🧐  They must think we are as dumb as them! 🤬  https://t.co/mKLZCAylVF
1326438921560088577 2020-11-11 16:17:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Crazy, Pervy, Senile Joe, still can't forgive us for the War of Independence, he still thinks he's fighting it!
1326437760052367361 2020-11-11 16:13:00 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm only just getting my head around US politics but one thing keeps stumping me...  How the fu*k did she get the job in the first place?
1326437322066456576 2020-11-11 16:11:16 +0800 <BainzyC> You cannot hide the truth, it always finds a way!
1326437025730490369 2020-11-11 16:10:05 +0800 <BainzyC> He did that on purpose!
1326436464662605831 2020-11-11 16:07:51 +0800 <BainzyC> It's very easy to spot electoral fraud, for example, when a senile, old, kiddie fiddling pervert wins record-breaking votes, beating a very successful, much-loved incumbent, your instincts kick in. Your natural guide tells you it's a fraud, it's called 'Common Sense'. #BidenLost!
1326432613230403584 2020-11-11 15:52:33 +0800 <BainzyC> That's how they make their living, flogging racism is big business!
1326432354748030981 2020-11-11 15:51:31 +0800 <BainzyC> The USA should set an example for the world, not become a laughing stock or the world's piggy bank.
1326431685957836800 2020-11-11 15:48:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Always tell the truth, if you have a memory as bad as mine, you never have to worry what you say!
1326429658456469504 2020-11-11 15:40:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Call me Thomas!
1326429287621287937 2020-11-11 15:39:20 +0800 <BainzyC> I was going to go into Ladbookes and bet on Trump 'Each Way' for a laugh, little did I ever think it would come in...
1326428339427487744 2020-11-11 15:35:34 +0800 <BainzyC> They don't care, they just aim to divide, nothing more and nothing less, they have no morals only faux racism.
1326426514381037568 2020-11-11 15:28:19 +0800 <BainzyC> No, not at all, I would, however, like to rename him to, John Minor, The Irrelevant!
1326425821226160135 2020-11-11 15:25:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Either I'm boring people to tears or I have a twatter follower leak!  I like following Conservatives in the US and the UK, follow me and I follow back.
1326425046718558208 2020-11-11 15:22:29 +0800 <BainzyC> For the good of democracy around the world, Biden and Harris should give themselves in!
1326424099745386499 2020-11-11 15:18:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Pence too, I trust him!
1326423507882954753 2020-11-11 15:16:22 +0800 <BainzyC> The spoiled brat got his bottom smacked, she did not give in to his tantrum. 😂👍🇬🇧
1326423201627447298 2020-11-11 15:15:09 +0800 <BainzyC> True! Asian? Not quite as true, no Thais, no Chinese, no other groups of people except muslims.
1326422065243680769 2020-11-11 15:10:38 +0800 <BainzyC> They rest now with their creator, forever in their prime!  +RIP+  11.11.11   Lest we forget!  https://t.co/KrAoTOdSyr
1326421236310741001 2020-11-11 15:07:21 +0800 <BainzyC> It will become more interesting when the reasons for those changes become widely known.  Trump is on the warpath, the Dem's nuke failed to do off!

1326419322856755200 2020-11-11 14:59:44 +0800 <BainzyC> You have yet to achieve anything yet Kammie, except maybe launch an investigation 1000 times bigger than Watergate.  You and Pervy Joe had better start looking for somewhere to hide, the law may start looking for you two very soon.
1326418207410966528 2020-11-11 14:55:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Great news, never surrender to dishonest people!

1326416829070315521 2020-11-11 14:49:50 +0800 <BainzyC> You won't get a reply from either of those racists!
1326416577181442051 2020-11-11 14:48:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Humble Pie is on the menu!
1326416259697799173 2020-11-11 14:47:34 +0800 <BainzyC> 🎶 I did it Joe's way🎶
1326414219835740163 2020-11-11 14:39:28 +0800 <BainzyC> He has denied that and calls upon you to stop telling lies!
1326413602853675009 2020-11-11 14:37:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Because that's where the fraud was
1326412129281445889 2020-11-11 14:31:09 +0800 <BainzyC> That's where mine went!
1326410072306671616 2020-11-11 14:22:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Irrelevant! Who needs a call from a usurper?
1326404268258189312 2020-11-11 13:59:55 +0800 <BainzyC> You just can't trust #ScumMedia, the bigger they are the worse they get!
1326403972731723778 2020-11-11 13:58:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Wow, so the FBI is still riddled with bad apples!!! 🤬
1326323501804957697 2020-11-11 08:38:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Hooray, the world is sick of that crazy pisshead!
1326323093107838976 2020-11-11 08:37:21 +0800 <BainzyC> She is so cute, lucky Trump! 😍
1326322502960865280 2020-11-11 08:35:01 +0800 <BainzyC> I got that, hence my original comment
1326321713609650176 2020-11-11 08:31:53 +0800 <BainzyC> How you got that from that I will not even pretend to understand, but I agree, they are beginning to shit themselves! 👍  https://t.co/qsAYDyV3y7
1326321205637509121 2020-11-11 08:29:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Hay Guy Whatevertwat, let me try and explain so that even you can understand. If I gave you a bag of coins some of them were worth something £1 and the others shit Euro1 and I said to count the £1s, would you count the Euro1s too?
1326319706953932806 2020-11-11 08:23:54 +0800 <BainzyC> WTF is that supposed to mean?
1326317123476606977 2020-11-11 08:13:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Money
1326317069932109824 2020-11-11 08:13:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Money!
1326315742103474177 2020-11-11 08:08:09 +0800 <BainzyC> He is good, very good, I would not like to face him!
1326314876692738049 2020-11-11 08:04:42 +0800 <BainzyC> You will be eating those words soon, be careful you don't choke on them 🤣👍
1326314285811765248 2020-11-11 08:02:22 +0800 <BainzyC> In the meantime, Hunter will be visiting you taking your highest bids for America's secrets and lucrative state contracts.
1326313037662482432 2020-11-11 07:57:24 +0800 <BainzyC> President of the library at Gitmo, Pervy Joe?
1326312388254195713 2020-11-11 07:54:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Lefties in 2020 don't drink bitter, they prefer a Moet!
1326311366983086081 2020-11-11 07:50:46 +0800 <BainzyC> When will #ScumMedia tell us that Biden has managed to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326310560393293824 2020-11-11 07:47:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Hay Pervy, looks like you've lost the game before you have begun it, looks like you've been Trumped!  https://t.co/r9DcfqRPjF
1326308794935226369 2020-11-11 07:40:32 +0800 <BainzyC> I was being sarcastic 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326306976641519618 2020-11-11 07:33:19 +0800 <BainzyC> And rightly so, loyalty must be Trump's main concern right now.
1326306177966346240 2020-11-11 07:30:09 +0800 <BainzyC> 'Beliefs' or 'feelings' do not replace votes!
1326305634027966465 2020-11-11 07:27:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Biden just called, no, I will not let my kids out to play!
1326304988470063111 2020-11-11 07:25:25 +0800 <BainzyC> He did not phase her at all, she made him look like a spoilt brat throwing his toys out of his pram.   Well done that girl!
1326303866162450432 2020-11-11 07:20:57 +0800 <BainzyC> Publically flogged would be the best form of justice for people who attempt to destroy their own company, not just in the USA!
1326302217620615170 2020-11-11 07:14:24 +0800 <BainzyC> His sister 🤣👍🇬🇧  https://t.co/zaFoCkRkNb
1326301889865134082 2020-11-11 07:13:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Pelosi's quivers were absentee ballots, they have missed their target for Pervy Joe and possibly herself as well, as she is struggling to get enough votes to maintain her very lucrative post. #byebyenancy  https://t.co/csVs6S0ymZ
1326300729192144899 2020-11-11 07:08:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Like you, to the Great British People, he is irrelevant!🇬🇧
1326298560934055937 2020-11-11 06:59:53 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326295012590690311 2020-11-11 06:45:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Cher
1326286261234110469 2020-11-11 06:11:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Probably the first and last for the little ginga!🤣👍🇬🇧
1326284340653854723 2020-11-11 06:03:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Do you have a link please?
1326284140921106434 2020-11-11 06:02:35 +0800 <BainzyC> 29 years in jail will give him time to reflect his stupid crimes!
1326283513075802113 2020-11-11 06:00:05 +0800 <BainzyC> It's now blatantly obvious that Fox News was in on the Trump 'stitch-up', the way they dumped him for Biden.  Will they crawl back to Trump tails between their legs or will they go down because Trump supporters blank them and the Dems punish them for backing Trump before? #Trump
1326281759751888906 2020-11-11 05:53:07 +0800 <BainzyC> We are not all bandits like you Pervy Joe!
1326280171985522688 2020-11-11 05:46:48 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326278827576856577 2020-11-11 05:41:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Excellent news, but what clown will replace her?  Bug-eyed Schiff?
1326278581631279104 2020-11-11 05:40:29 +0800 <BainzyC> He is going to win, he won before the cheats tried to steal it!
1326276122745720835 2020-11-11 05:30:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Please tell me, folks, do I tweet too much and fill up your twatter walls or do you accept me doing my part trying to protect a great president?
1326275031677210626 2020-11-11 05:26:23 +0800 <BainzyC> We really need police like this! 🤢🤮
1326273283675787264 2020-11-11 05:19:26 +0800 <BainzyC> This time next month Trump will still be working every hour God sends making America Great Again secured for at least another 4 years in the US whilst here in the UK we will be laughing our nuts off listening to frantic remoaners give their last shots to try and damage #Brexit!
1326264894472282113 2020-11-11 04:46:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump is securing the armed forces, he may need them....

1326261955196301314 2020-11-11 04:34:25 +0800 <BainzyC> They won't until the votes have been verified Pervy Joe.
1326247472839135241 2020-11-11 03:36:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't you mean Usurper Biden?
1326247359895003136 2020-11-11 03:36:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Well done, ignore them!
1326244231246131202 2020-11-11 03:23:59 +0800 <BainzyC> +15 for Trump
1326243223145209860 2020-11-11 03:19:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Show off! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326242678082834439 2020-11-11 03:17:49 +0800 <BainzyC> When Trump proves he was right I think Kammie will have the 'Hump'. 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326242337253699584 2020-11-11 03:16:28 +0800 <BainzyC> If you are counting marbles and there are stones in the bag, you don't count the stones as marbles!
1326241883778142208 2020-11-11 03:14:40 +0800 <BainzyC> As much as I dislike Macron for his treatment of the #YellowVests (COVID got rid of them) I would rather see him voted out of office than beheaded.
1326240324298149889 2020-11-11 03:08:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Plausible deniability if people start dropping like flies and NO comeback once the needles start pricking!
1326238397774651392 2020-11-11 03:00:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Is 'Hope' another word for the ID chip?
1326221452333490176 2020-11-11 01:53:28 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm not sure, but I think he is a big, fat, cocky, egotistical, dickhead that needs taking down a peg or two!  And if you listen to my X wife, I'm always bloody right!👍🤣👍🇬🇧
1326214215812657155 2020-11-11 01:24:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Brilliant 👍🤣
1326213412280524800 2020-11-11 01:21:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Most of the kids in school now in the UK come from countries where they don't use knives and forks.  The UK kids who have lazy parents feed their kids pizza from a box or takeaways in bags and cartons.
1326212578436112384 2020-11-11 01:18:13 +0800 <BainzyC> I think Ken is out of a job today? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326211638912020486 2020-11-11 01:14:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Does Biden realise that this guy would end him next year if he had the power to do it?  Then again, does Joe understand that he is actually alive today?
1326210017285042176 2020-11-11 01:08:02 +0800 <BainzyC> No good if you get brain damage or die!
1326209750577651712 2020-11-11 01:06:58 +0800 <BainzyC> He has not been elected #Boris   You should rescind that, if Trump does expose massive fraud you could end up looking like a big twat when Biden ends up in jail and Trump stays in his home, The Whitehouse.  Every hour they are finding fraud, all over the USA.  Do it for the UK!
1326186516729696256 2020-11-10 23:34:39 +0800 <BainzyC> 😰
1326186100080173057 2020-11-10 23:33:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Never, and I'm from the UK.  The world has never seen the likes of a man like him, one of the richest men on the planet working 20 hours a day to fix his broken country, hated at every step, vilified and cheated.  Trump is what all in power should aspire to.  God bless Trump!

1326170730669740032 2020-11-10 22:31:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Biden has fallen below 270 because the count was fudged
1326169341205819392 2020-11-10 22:26:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump after consuming Biden and Harris for breakfast 🤣👍🇬🇧
1326168809225465858 2020-11-10 22:24:17 +0800 <BainzyC> There are no 'IFs' about it, the fraud is being exposed
1326168618019721218 2020-11-10 22:23:32 +0800 <BainzyC> They are waiting for the exposed fraud to capture Biden and Harris then they will riot!

1326154575947177985 2020-11-10 21:27:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Poor Diane, I am mean to her sometimes, but she is such a delicious target. When you put yourself in the public eye then you must expect a bit of banter here and there, especially when you prove you are shite at maths.  🤣👍🇬🇧
1326154067102621698 2020-11-10 21:25:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Just like witchcraft

1326086803628171264 2020-11-10 16:58:26 +0800 <BainzyC> The same type of people arrive every day by dinghy and we give them 5* accommodation to sharpen their machetes in.
1326085149805703168 2020-11-10 16:51:51 +0800 <BainzyC> He would if he could, in fact, he would probably be commissioned to fill Pervy Joe's stable!
1326084474464034818 2020-11-10 16:49:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Monty Python is back folks with the best joke of 2020
1326084153851453440 2020-11-10 16:47:54 +0800 <BainzyC> The whole world needs to be reassured!  @realDonaldTrump we are all relying on you to destroy this monster the Dems created.  God speed!  https://t.co/fjllWbNMec
1326083178092785664 2020-11-10 16:44:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Ignore all #ScumMedia otherwise, you cannot ignore them.
1326082859510140934 2020-11-10 16:42:45 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🍺🇬🇧 and a £0.1/2p
1326082497193586691 2020-11-10 16:41:19 +0800 <BainzyC> This is what they are counting on, every possible wannabe dictator is salivating at the opportunity of getting hold of 'The Biden Method' on how to steal an election.  It must be revealed for the fraud that it is.
1326081659532349440 2020-11-10 16:37:59 +0800 <BainzyC> I bet the soldiers in their graves all turned when these two muppets came for their media opportunity, they did not die to enrich fools.
1326077264778452993 2020-11-10 16:20:31 +0800 <BainzyC> They are offering a tadpole in exchange for a whale!
1326076507467489282 2020-11-10 16:17:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Did Diane Abbott go to the USA to help with their count? 🧐🤣👍🍺🇬🇧  @realDonaldTrump
1326075673937649664 2020-11-10 16:14:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Good question!   Will he go quietly when he is arrested for rigging the election?
1326074961199591425 2020-11-10 16:11:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Health Secretary - UK population has one of the highest acceptance rates for a vaccine, we just can't wait to get that chip, I mean cure, inside us!
1326073534309920768 2020-11-10 16:05:42 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🍺🇬🇧
1326073265916440576 2020-11-10 16:04:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Will they be the first to take it?
1326072866958434305 2020-11-10 16:03:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Logan's Run anyone?
1326072532492017666 2020-11-10 16:01:43 +0800 <BainzyC> The biggest mistake Fox has ever made, they will really regret doing that, in fact, they will pay dearly for it if Trump remains in power.  Fox may have overstepped their press privilege and could lose their license to broadcast.  That would be suitable karma.
1326071023750569984 2020-11-10 15:55:43 +0800 <BainzyC> Oh dear Joe and Kammie, are you sweating yet?
1326070426599088128 2020-11-10 15:53:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Quislings!
1325979146674184195 2020-11-10 09:50:38 +0800 <BainzyC> @bainzy
1325975243731705859 2020-11-10 09:35:08 +0800 <BainzyC> This is a monster predator, even this baby feels the threat! 🤢🤮🤬
1325973543427969024 2020-11-10 09:28:22 +0800 <BainzyC> In law, MSM is irrelevant.
1325972763962732544 2020-11-10 09:25:16 +0800 <BainzyC> We have all seen these things on Trump and Conservative posts regarding the 2020election.   Are they an attempt to cover up fraud?  If so, is twitter guilty of aiding and abetting a serious crime?  @realDonaldTrump 's legal team, have you considered these?  https://t.co/eZvIA7F8nl
1325964703525462016 2020-11-10 08:53:15 +0800 <BainzyC> You're ranting, what's up mush? Things not going your way?
1325964086069366786 2020-11-10 08:50:47 +0800 <BainzyC> 666? You should really be asking Pervy Joe, he was Obama's wingman when they caged the kids.  The X president and his VP could have turned them into hotdogs, they just loved their hotdogs in Obama's administration.
1325959557928062977 2020-11-10 08:32:48 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump was putting an end to that, they hate him.
1325959246845014017 2020-11-10 08:31:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Hasbeens lose their voices when they became former!  If they were any good they would still be in their jobs.
1325958421141655552 2020-11-10 08:28:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Real democracy is transparency, you don't appear to want to be transparent, what do you have to hide congresswoman?  Your comment sounds very suspicious, it's a good job that the USA has checks and balances, if it didn't, things like elections could be stolen.   Let the law rule!
1325950266236170241 2020-11-10 07:55:53 +0800 <BainzyC> The answers are very clear, they were preparing to rig the election, pre-emptive actions that are clear to everyone except the guilty or their allies.
1325948333031108608 2020-11-10 07:48:12 +0800 <BainzyC> So predictable, sometimes I think that politicians are so dumb, do they train to be so stupid?
1325947669676699651 2020-11-10 07:45:34 +0800 <BainzyC> I think it's time Biden and Harris conceded their fake win and scarpered to the hills, it's going to get VERY HOT for them over the next few weeks!
1325947227693518853 2020-11-10 07:43:48 +0800 <BainzyC> It's coming apart at the seems minute by minute, the Dems thought the world would fall for it if the #ScumMedia promoted it 24/7. it's having the opposite effect, people are seeing right through it. How foolish to even attempt it in a tech run world? Fraud always leaves a trail!
1325944421490307079 2020-11-10 07:32:39 +0800 <BainzyC> It would be fun if Trump gave The Whitehouse to Biden and sat back for 4 years, then come back to fix Biden's mess with a full remit to destroy BLM and Antifa.
1325943537804976131 2020-11-10 07:29:08 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump The Dalek 🤣👍🍺🇬🇧  https://t.co/iVdWpNsT0K
1325942856717127680 2020-11-10 07:26:26 +0800 <BainzyC> He does 🤣👍🍺
1325939636636700672 2020-11-10 07:13:38 +0800 <BainzyC> I think Kammie has put her in her place 🤣👍🍺
1325938030763454464 2020-11-10 07:07:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Marxism tends to do that to empty minds
1325937775787597824 2020-11-10 07:06:15 +0800 <BainzyC> The world is holding it's breathe 😎👍🍺
1325935290347827200 2020-11-10 06:56:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Glad to see there are still some warriors out there...
1325934976769138690 2020-11-10 06:55:07 +0800 <BainzyC> I sent this to @realDonaldTrump earlier 👍🍺🇬🇧  https://t.co/Bs9uqc0ksb
1325930683785736193 2020-11-10 06:38:04 +0800 <BainzyC> @realDonaldTrump
1325930426721071104 2020-11-10 06:37:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Fox news is dying
1325928920278069253 2020-11-10 06:31:03 +0800 <BainzyC> English is also the language of law, business, the skies and the seas.  Plus, as a people, we are bloody great! 👍🇬🇧
1325928144256327682 2020-11-10 06:27:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Where did he get all his hair from, when he was 40 he was nearly bald, now he has had loads of hair, is it a transplant or they have replaced him?
1325927395782774790 2020-11-10 06:25:00 +0800 <BainzyC> The media, you just have to turn it off.
1325926910761824258 2020-11-10 06:23:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Naughty people trying to take away Mr Trump's job off him.
1325926397592920065 2020-11-10 06:21:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Now listen you lot, don't think, we think for you, don't dare dispute us, we know better than you. you must listen to us, we are making lists!  https://t.co/b8pb89Fk8c
1325925361809575937 2020-11-10 06:16:55 +0800 <BainzyC> She's smart and sexy xxx
1325925074302603269 2020-11-10 06:15:46 +0800 <BainzyC> He has more chance of getting a wank off the Pope...   Mind you, this Pope....??? 🤣👍🍺🇬🇧
1325924748900102145 2020-11-10 06:14:29 +0800 <BainzyC> No hassle from him, I can handle that, besides, I'm bored🤣👍🍺🇬🇧
1325924174066544642 2020-11-10 06:12:12 +0800 <BainzyC> The Hate Gang! They are race-baiters, fuelling hatred and division, they are no good for anything except that. But things are changing, Owen has just been dumped by the Guardian, the others hopefully will hate themselves out of employment soon.
1325922953062719490 2020-11-10 06:07:21 +0800 <BainzyC> If you look at their personal fortunes, Pelosi for example, it is impossible for her to have earned what she has on her salary, she has no business or investment experience, where did all her money come from?
1325922346268553223 2020-11-10 06:04:56 +0800 <BainzyC> Do you know how stupid you sound? If you don't, let me tell you... ''You sound stupid''.  FFS, these idiots, where do they all come from?
1325921804918067200 2020-11-10 06:02:47 +0800 <BainzyC> No money in that!
1325920514049789952 2020-11-10 05:57:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe, just maybe they have been naughty there?
1325920155352838150 2020-11-10 05:56:14 +0800 <BainzyC> That's why the claim is BS.
1325919792453349377 2020-11-10 05:54:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Have Biden and Harris bitten off too much than they can chew stealing off Trump?
1325919347437674503 2020-11-10 05:53:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Not the best of friends these two! One has power, real power, the usurper will not be able to get anything past him.
1325919048085987335 2020-11-10 05:51:50 +0800 <BainzyC> @realDonaldTrump  More evidence
1325918855357722626 2020-11-10 05:51:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Just look at her face, who the hell do these people think they are?
1325918399520780288 2020-11-10 05:49:15 +0800 <BainzyC> @realDonaldTrump   More evidence
1325918053872316424 2020-11-10 05:47:53 +0800 <BainzyC> If Hillary was made VP, Kammie would be a dead girl walking 🤣👍🇬🇧
1325917381391224837 2020-11-10 05:45:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Oh, Diane, you poor mathematical delinquent, 7.00 is in the early morning, you mean 19h which is in the evening, did you wait there on your lonesome?
1325916320253284353 2020-11-10 05:40:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Less than two months to go, let's pray he holds on, let's also pray Trump defeats his usurpers too.
1325915597981552642 2020-11-10 05:38:07 +0800 <BainzyC> I doubt they had them, if so Trump would have an open and shut case. All countries should be counterfeit-proof, like money, its not difficult to do.
1325914651469770757 2020-11-10 05:34:21 +0800 <BainzyC> He is a great man, the British love strong leaders, Winston, Maggie, Boris we thought was one....Yet to prove himself!
1325912949807046658 2020-11-10 05:27:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't believe the hype Andrew, you are better than that!
1325912735838851077 2020-11-10 05:26:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Usurpers by fraud!  https://t.co/lyxvKXegXD
1325912422574657537 2020-11-10 05:25:30 +0800 <BainzyC> And hopefully throw the usurpers in jail.
1325911963260641281 2020-11-10 05:23:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump is in your way! And the whole world is watching, this is what democracy really looks like... And the whole world is watching, this is what democracy really looks like... And the whole world is watching, this is what democracy really looks like... We can chant too Kammie xxx
1325910599713378307 2020-11-10 05:18:15 +0800 <BainzyC> SCUM
1325910470004518912 2020-11-10 05:17:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Boris must hold on to the very last day but he must not surrender to their demands, he must not give them an inch.
1325909308220076033 2020-11-10 05:13:07 +0800 <BainzyC> The world is behind you, Mr VP!
1325908560887361548 2020-11-10 05:10:09 +0800 <BainzyC> Great!
1325908375029362691 2020-11-10 05:09:25 +0800 <BainzyC> He is caught up in The Great Reset, he has sold his soul to the new world leaders, he is hoping one day, he will be King of The World as he dreamed of. Unfortunately, he is not their type, he is just a useful idiot to them. They will drop him when he is not useful any more. #Word
1325907159041925124 2020-11-10 05:04:35 +0800 <BainzyC> They are the cornerstone of civilisation.

1325904012177235970 2020-11-10 04:52:05 +0800 <BainzyC> I do
1325903430699929602 2020-11-10 04:49:46 +0800 <BainzyC> They tell fibs!
1325902893417959427 2020-11-10 04:47:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Perfect for a Dutch Oven 🤣👍🍺
1325900654812999682 2020-11-10 04:38:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Joe, you will be in jail by then
1325899951180800005 2020-11-10 04:35:57 +0800 <BainzyC> Me too, I just love to buy British as well.🇬🇧
1325899680522395648 2020-11-10 04:34:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Predators! 🤢🤮🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
1325899528113967104 2020-11-10 04:34:16 +0800 <BainzyC> I have seen this same tweet dozens of times, same wording, are you a police officer by chance?
1325898712514666497 2020-11-10 04:31:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Thank you, I'm in no rush, if I don't get one soon I like the look of the new Jag, I'll settle for that 🙂👍🍺🇬🇧
1325896451000573952 2020-11-10 04:22:02 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't worry too much about things like that MrsTjg, I like to use twatter to have fun and dabble in politics here and there, right now I'm looking for a lucky lady to rub my belly 👍🙂🍺
1325894951041953795 2020-11-10 04:16:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Antifa?   The oddball, no-mates, can I join your gang, bunch of pussys?   They are a kind, the kind you want to dispose of quickly with no remorse.
1325892717881257985 2020-11-10 04:07:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Even better, cut the head off the snake and get back to normal.
1325892184537780235 2020-11-10 04:05:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Is that funny? Doesn't make any sense Mr Popular? Maybe if you got a few more mates they might give you some pointers on how to communicate in an understanding way. But from your comments I think that will be quite hard, you appear to be an annoying twat!
1325890177093554179 2020-11-10 03:57:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Mr Popular 🤣👍🇬🇧
1325889541761343488 2020-11-10 03:54:35 +0800 <BainzyC> What a ripper, give her my number 🤣👍
1325889295647985664 2020-11-10 03:53:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Beaver St would suit me more right now, I'm horny as hell 🤣👍🇬🇧
1325889060494319617 2020-11-10 03:52:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Your just jealous because when you rub your willy only wee comes out! 🧐
1325888334938431488 2020-11-10 03:49:47 +0800 <BainzyC> So boring in fakebook now, no sense of humour 🧐👍🇬🇧🤣  https://t.co/bgh5EqHLX6
1325886692570656768 2020-11-10 03:43:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Twatter didn't give me enough characters Janet 🤣👍🇬🇧

1325883290247639041 2020-11-10 03:29:44 +0800 <BainzyC> How is it possible to find a partner with this lockdown doing on?  I need a woman (no bits of anything else) from 35-50, Conservative patriot that likes a laugh, big boobies a bonus but not essential, likes travelling and belly rubbing. 🤣👍🇬🇧
1325882214035431425 2020-11-10 03:25:28 +0800 <BainzyC> That's their plan, they are so unhinged after 4+ years of nothing but 'Fuck Trump', when Trump gets his 4 more years they will explode.  Trump should have the Home Guard waiting with orders to   'shoot to deter violence and vandalism!'  They must be stopped once and for all.
1325881205317906435 2020-11-10 03:21:27 +0800 <BainzyC> I hope Brett and Amy are waiting for Donald.
1325879810820861957 2020-11-10 03:15:55 +0800 <BainzyC> You can have mine Terry, I'm such a generous guy! 🙂👍🇬🇧
1325879591676866561 2020-11-10 03:15:02 +0800 <BainzyC> How brainwashing works in 2020, repeat then repeat again, if you lie so often people believe it to be the truth.  Unless of course, you recognise it.
1325877774792454150 2020-11-10 03:07:49 +0800 <BainzyC> India went normal 3 x months ago, they have 1.4 billion people and very limited hygiene, it just does not make sense that the UK and other developed countries are locking down. Are people deliberately spreading it or are the figures wrong? COVID19 is a very intelligent virus.
1325876829920632835 2020-11-10 03:04:04 +0800 <BainzyC> They are going too far, who are these idiots doing this? Expose them, please 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
1325876216683958273 2020-11-10 03:01:38 +0800 <BainzyC> The new Democratic software makes it impossible to lose any type of vote or poll 🤣👍🇬🇧

1325846868564324352 2020-11-10 01:05:01 +0800 <BainzyC> It's not an easy job, lots of hard work, long hours, no heating, no breaks, no staff room, eating on the hoof.  Most butchers are not scared of hard work.
1325846329650802688 2020-11-10 01:02:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Did you get a UB45 or don't they do them anymore for sacked failures?  Are you looking for a job?  I will offer you one as my asslicker, bog roll is getting expensive.
1325845496217423873 2020-11-10 00:59:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Tell him. there are Master Butchers and there are Ynafs that think they are 🤣👍🇬🇧 (a Master Butcher will know that).

1325839127363907588 2020-11-10 00:34:15 +0800 <BainzyC> That's easy to throw a box with about 100 ballot papers and envelops in like that, unless you throw like a pussy.

1325837075522981894 2020-11-10 00:26:06 +0800 <BainzyC> There are Dem experts and then there are mad Republican professors and charlatans.
1325836764532142082 2020-11-10 00:24:52 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't know why your dad doesn't become a dictator to fix it, Obama put all the legals in place to do that, your dad could do it, then destroy what gave him that power so it cannot be broken again, and no dictator will not follow him.
1325835697492811776 2020-11-10 00:20:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Where is Hunter Biden? Maybe he is jetting around the world selling America's secrets to the highest bidder? The Big Man does not care, his cut is 15%.
1325835253680906241 2020-11-10 00:18:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't pick them up, harbouring criminals is against the law.  Oops sorry, I forgot, you believe you are above the law.
1325834381437579264 2020-11-10 00:15:24 +0800 <BainzyC> In January 2025 when Trump retires from The Whitehouse, the world will look back on this time and thank God that Trump did not give in.
1325833471923806209 2020-11-10 00:11:47 +0800 <BainzyC> I would like them to trace the fraud right up to Biden, Harris and Pelosi.

1325827267830947843 2020-11-09 23:47:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Parody maybe, but people are being told that and some people will believe that.
1325826533768957953 2020-11-09 23:44:12 +0800 <BainzyC> It is, Uruguay is the best, the best parts of it, built by the British.
1325826216373473282 2020-11-09 23:42:57 +0800 <BainzyC> None, I think if Trump supporters went rogue they would exercise their right and seize the government, make productive changes and not bullying, destructive changes.
1325825680530153472 2020-11-09 23:40:49 +0800 <BainzyC> I would have gone backpacking in Sth America, staying off the grid, wild camping on the beach and in the woods.
1325823451551166467 2020-11-09 23:31:58 +0800 <BainzyC> If you look at the middle-aged Biden and the today Biden, the middle-aged Biden was nearly bald, the new one has a very distinguished head of silver hair. Is it a wig or hair transplants or is it a person transplant?
1325822821843537922 2020-11-09 23:29:27 +0800 <BainzyC> He is Predator in Chief!
1325822539919187969 2020-11-09 23:28:20 +0800 <BainzyC> I wonder if the ID chip they put in the vaccine will be detectable and removable?
1325820846867406851 2020-11-09 23:21:37 +0800 <BainzyC> India - 1.5 billion people and about 10 times less hygienic than the UK has been fully open for 3 x months!

1325733165521133568 2020-11-09 17:33:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Dear God,Your servant Donald J. Trump who has donated his twilight years to serve the people of his nation requires your help. Please assist him to correct the wrongs that have been imposed on him and restore him to the place where he can do the most good. In the name of your son
1325732321098600449 2020-11-09 17:29:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Hold on to this thought boys &amp; girls  If Trump manages to expose the fraud then The Great British People will have a mandate to close the BBC and reform all of our #ScumMedia for their damaging bias.
1325730622409756672 2020-11-09 17:23:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Great excuse for him to declare that he is mentally ill...!
1325730279722463234 2020-11-09 17:21:44 +0800 <BainzyC> European cities are becoming barracks for islamist armies!
1325729887383035904 2020-11-09 17:20:10 +0800 <BainzyC> He can't even unify his lips to form the words that come out of his mouth.
1325728451370901506 2020-11-09 17:14:28 +0800 <BainzyC> How wrong was I?  I always thought it was 'Bloody Bullshitting C*nts'!   Oh well, we live and learn 🧐🤣👍🇬🇧

1325727372348448770 2020-11-09 17:10:11 +0800 <BainzyC> The Dems are fucking themselves, the cat is out of the bag now and momentum to get the real results is growing.  ***TRUMP2020*** IS THE WINNER!
1325726772797829120 2020-11-09 17:07:48 +0800 <BainzyC> It's not working in the UK despite our own #ScumMedia RAMMING it down our throats.  #BidenIsNotPresidentElect
1325721397176496128 2020-11-09 16:46:26 +0800 <BainzyC> We never really go away when we go inside!
1325720974365499392 2020-11-09 16:44:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Why is Gordon Brown, the twat, dictating policy regarding Biden?  Rotten hasbeens from the past are no good for the future!
1325717890725711872 2020-11-09 16:32:30 +0800 <BainzyC> They are so eager to promote that he has won because if the results are turned the maximum amount of OUTRAGE can be exercised.   A PROJECTION is not a result everyone, Biden has not won the US 2020 presidential election.  https://t.co/Z5iQnyJxXh
1325716847229100032 2020-11-09 16:28:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Fucking Hell!🤢🤮😪🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

1325715708932714496 2020-11-09 16:23:50 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't have your confidence and I think the majority feel as I do...
1325715445215883265 2020-11-09 16:22:47 +0800 <BainzyC> There seems to be a global effort to lower the mood of the human race..
1325715080319791104 2020-11-09 16:21:20 +0800 <BainzyC> I wonder if Biden as president will continue (allegedly) to use Hunter to sell America's secrets to foreign governments and syphon off his cuts?
1325714510397632512 2020-11-09 16:19:04 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't watch any sport any more, #BLM did do one good thing for me, it made me realise that my support, paid mostly dumbasses, whose only ability was to kick a bit of cow around, extra-ordinary sums of money. They don't deserve it, I'd rather give the money to the homeless.
1325712617399349249 2020-11-09 16:11:33 +0800 <BainzyC> It is NOT a requirement that a rogue royal does anything, if it was personal then it should have been done in private. Have the pictures been purchased? If they have that will tell us why they were there.
1325712047481499650 2020-11-09 16:09:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe plan B is plausible deniability, don't call them just in case the fraud is discovered?
1325711625958150146 2020-11-09 16:07:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Twitter is saying this claim is disputed, so take it as fact!
1325711149539725312 2020-11-09 16:05:43 +0800 <BainzyC> I think so, that's because we all love the world when we are young then as we get older we wake up and realise the world doesn't love us back 😎👍🇬🇧

1325570754289799173 2020-11-09 06:47:50 +0800 <BainzyC> How did the US armed forces vote? Anyone???
1325570249203310592 2020-11-09 06:45:49 +0800 <BainzyC> The Dems are trying a Kavannah type of attack on the 2020ELECTION.  Declaring Biden the winner before he is, is just like claiming Kavannah was guilty of bad conduct when he was not.  They never learn people are not stupid, facts are facts, not feelings or wishes.

1325531940024414214 2020-11-09 04:13:36 +0800 <BainzyC> The US election charts make as much sense as the ones thrown out by the UK govt. to justify lockdown.
1325531419821682691 2020-11-09 04:11:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Salesmanship is not conning, it is an art form!
1325530774930644993 2020-11-09 04:08:58 +0800 <BainzyC> #ScumMedia has mocked every word and action that Trump has said or made in the last 5 years, this has made him into a very thick-skinned warrior.  Do not be surprised if you get another 4 years extra to mock him...
1325530131771912195 2020-11-09 04:06:25 +0800 <BainzyC> The USA is in a very dangerous place right now...
1325529748580278272 2020-11-09 04:04:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Mexico more democratic than the US? The Founding Fathers must be turning in their graves.
1325529347374141441 2020-11-09 04:03:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Would he be so brave in the line of fire?
1325529121955438592 2020-11-09 04:02:24 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe it was Ukraine hacking the voting machines, covering for Hunter and The Big Man?
1325525647821737984 2020-11-09 03:48:36 +0800 <BainzyC> i didn't....
1325524554089979904 2020-11-09 03:44:15 +0800 <BainzyC> This may be a parody account but children of the 'woke' are being brainwashed this way!
1325524262334115840 2020-11-09 03:43:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Legally so, correct!
1325523900760006657 2020-11-09 03:41:39 +0800 <BainzyC> To the US vote counters, all you need to do is verify the authenticity of the vote and learn basic math +1= +1 more.
1325523293705805831 2020-11-09 03:39:14 +0800 <BainzyC> I think they managed to raise a quid?
1325522730884673536 2020-11-09 03:37:00 +0800 <BainzyC> They haven't understood Trump!
1325522464294711300 2020-11-09 03:35:57 +0800 <BainzyC> Somebodies mask slipped off their nose? Or a religious nutter has attacked innocent people with a murderous weapon...
1325521776344969218 2020-11-09 03:33:13 +0800 <BainzyC> Let's just say that Trump and the courts decide that the election was flawed and that action needs to be taken to rectify it...  I will be intrigued to see how the Dems will try and get out of that one, they must have a plan B, if they don't have a plan B then they are not smart!

1325515689902428168 2020-11-09 03:09:02 +0800 <BainzyC> One gloating voice we have yet to hear, maybe because she knows that Trump has a lot more fight left him, is Hillary....  https://t.co/IX1lRJE1Zq

1325430045435899904 2020-11-08 21:28:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Even the Mexicans give the law more weight than the US, a bastion of so-called law!
1325429677465473025 2020-11-08 21:27:15 +0800 <BainzyC> How are they going to take back the pre-emptive presidency the media have granted Pervy Joe when the courts rule in Trump's favour?
1325427603738669056 2020-11-08 21:19:00 +0800 <BainzyC> I was just watching a video of poll watchers pulling sacks of Trump ballots out of a dumpster when it was completely cut off, now no longer available.  The fraud is widespread and massive.

1325420141153312768 2020-11-08 20:49:21 +0800 <BainzyC> And the death of the USA!
1325419930100101122 2020-11-08 20:48:31 +0800 <BainzyC> At this moment in time, Trump is not the loser, the real loser is America &amp; her people, all of them. If they get away with stealing an election once that nation will be lost, only blood will cleanse it. Freedom comes at a cost, with Trump it was his manner, with Biden its blood

In a way I'm jealous, I would love to go out with sword in hand instead of being stuffed into an old folks home, out the way when I am of no more use, shitting my own pants because the only thing I will have left is the thought of a cute nurse wiping my ass!
1325405277810794496 2020-11-08 19:50:17 +0800 <BainzyC> That was a girl he began to sucker punch, cowardly twat!

1325398770134245378 2020-11-08 19:24:26 +0800 <BainzyC> If they get elected I just cannot imagine what the US will look like in 4 years time, they will flood the US with illegals and put in place the chance for them to vote so they get to stay in that's a no brainer, plus they will stack the supreme court. They said Trump was bad!

1325353967937785856 2020-11-08 16:26:24 +0800 <BainzyC> With the Senate and a favourable Supreme Court, the Republicans could make Pervy Joe's live a complete misery if he managed to get into The Whitehouse.

He has a lot of powerful friends who were prepared to do any &amp; all nefarious actions to get him in, let's pray that the evidence is found so that the courts allow your father to continue his great work!

1325323916932493313 2020-11-08 14:26:59 +0800 <BainzyC> FOUR years of deliberate hostility piled onto Trump, every word and every action he took, good works slandered and bad works created to paint him in a bad light. Before the election is over those haters now want that hate and hostility to magically disappear! Good luck with that!
1325322520111755264 2020-11-08 14:21:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Today we celebrate our fallen heroes, it's Remembrance Sunday, a good day to remember other sacrifices people have made to improve the plight of others, its a day when we should celebrate loyalty, its a day when we should look across The Pond to a great man that is being cheated!
1325319176198770688 2020-11-08 14:08:09 +0800 <BainzyC> A good politician, loyalty is the greatest trait any man can have!
1325317540810252289 2020-11-08 14:01:39 +0800 <BainzyC> The Dems need as much legitimacy as they can get for Biden right now because if Trump wins in the courts, they have the perfect excuse to reignite the riots and protests they have fanned for the last 4 years. It's far from over yet they act as if it is. Bloody dangerous game!
1325315968571215872 2020-11-08 13:55:24 +0800 <BainzyC> @realDonaldTrump
1325315817374932994 2020-11-08 13:54:48 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump never did join their global club, I doubt he will think of many as allies!
1325314521154654214 2020-11-08 13:49:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Revenge is a dish best served cold, there are a lot of scores to settle in the US, patriots that bit their tounges and withheld violence to protect Trump may now do more than speak out.
1325311808564056064 2020-11-08 13:38:52 +0800 <BainzyC> If the Dems get away with what has happened in the US, there will never B a Republican next win again, over time their places in the house and senate will be whittled away using the same tech.The tech will be exported worldwide to wipe out all sovereign right-wing leading nations
1325148887305302018 2020-11-08 02:51:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Not the people of the UK, only our foolish leaders! #TRUMP2020WON 👍🇬🇧
1325148574821216256 2020-11-08 02:50:14 +0800 <BainzyC> War is just beginning I feel, the US people have been cheated, will they take it lying down? I doubt it, I can hear the knives being sharpened and the magazines being filled, the Trump army will defend their king!

1325145564757942279 2020-11-08 02:38:17 +0800 <BainzyC> President Trump is the 45th president of the USA, mush!

1325100103800074240 2020-11-07 23:37:38 +0800 <BainzyC> They and the #ScumMedia will do everything they can to suppress it because they are all complicit in it.

1325085094302912513 2020-11-07 22:38:00 +0800 <BainzyC> If they can link the fraud to Biden &amp; Harris can you just imagine the uproar?
1325080195460689922 2020-11-07 22:18:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Just like every other #ScumMedia attack, ALL MSM outlets coordinate their responses.  The #2020FRAUD buzz words they are all using now are ''No evidence'' despite the Trump legal team saying they have loads.  Good luck Trump, go for the jugular! @realDonaldTrump

1325036284222599168 2020-11-07 19:24:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Biden and Harris are going to get sussed out, Trump will expose them.  Unchartered waters!!!!!

1324990879438925824 2020-11-07 16:23:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Who will the US armed forces side with?  Trump or Biden?  If the left march in the streets kicking off now I think the right will come out and wipe them out.  THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FRAUD THE US PEOPLE!
1324982026789941248 2020-11-07 15:48:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't forget me m'fu*kers!

1324973875990589441 2020-11-07 15:16:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Was COVID designed to take out Trump?
1324970153973575682 2020-11-07 15:01:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Expect non stop Trump-bashing in the next few weeks as he fights to defend democracy. 4 years of constant anti-Trump rhetoric from #ScumMedia has whipped the weak-willed and brainwashed into a righteous frenzy, breaking through the noise is going to be hard.Trump needs support!
1324967074507206657 2020-11-07 14:49:01 +0800 <BainzyC> You will be found out!
1324961609190694912 2020-11-07 14:27:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump should go Media-Silent, give #ScumMedia no ammo until the courts have spoken, if he gives too much they will slaughter him and boost Biden's claim.  #realDonaldTrump let the courts speak for you!
1324960661458325504 2020-11-07 14:23:32 +0800 <BainzyC> If you were Trump would you concede?

1324838395089215489 2020-11-07 06:17:42 +0800 <BainzyC> We are witnessing the latest stages of a very long plan being played out, very soon the 'Gotcha' moment will take place and the horrors awaiting will commence.
1324829499574419456 2020-11-07 05:42:21 +0800 <BainzyC> I bet Soros is playing with his wizened old todger today watching Trump trying to get out of his web!
1324828565091852289 2020-11-07 05:38:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Le Pen was the first to suffer from the new global ballot-counting method.

1324827836662878208 2020-11-07 05:35:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Will a Biden presidency legalise the pedos?
1324827411855364102 2020-11-07 05:34:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Fail! You don't just sound like one, you look like one!
1324815113443049473 2020-11-07 04:45:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump is probably the only president in recent U|S history that could raise an army within the states.  @realDonaldTrump

1324809392403959808 2020-11-07 04:22:27 +0800 <BainzyC> How careless, I bet no glitch was in Trump's favour! @realDonaldTrump

1324806806447730688 2020-11-07 04:12:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Biden telling everyone to keep calm with that smug face after he and his people set up all the shit that's happening is like pissing petrol on to a fire!
1324762520155029506 2020-11-07 01:16:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump must call a state of emergency, recount and check every vote and don't move on until every vote is counted and every vote is checked, as is his right.  It wont take a few days, get the home guard to do it.
1324761298270326784 2020-11-07 01:11:21 +0800 <BainzyC> The ballot counters are playing their part of the fraud, treating voters like a cat with a mouse, the longer they can extend the result the more opportunity they have of giving Biden credibility.  Nasty antics are afoot, we must call them out before their results take you out!
1324760454942629890 2020-11-07 01:07:59 +0800 <BainzyC> I do not expect Trump to go down quietly if he has been robbed!
1324749270331916290 2020-11-07 00:23:33 +0800 <BainzyC> We need Trump!
1324747612126384128 2020-11-07 00:16:58 +0800 <BainzyC> I was tempted to put Civil War on there but I did not want to tempt fate
1324745394107154433 2020-11-07 00:08:09 +0800 <BainzyC> THE MOST RELEVANT QUESTION ON TWITTER TODAY  WILL THEY GET AWAY WITH IT?
1324654603506487296 2020-11-06 18:07:23 +0800 <BainzyC> The guy can't even do up his shoelaces, either the US people have all been whacked over the head with the idiot stick or this man's people are cheating for him!
1324648201685782528 2020-11-06 17:41:56 +0800 <BainzyC> More....

1324645327601881088 2020-11-06 17:30:31 +0800 <BainzyC> That, I think is the problem, they should have done a few Trump ones too, 100% Biden postal votes stink, it's impossible unless a cheat was in...
1324638723447947265 2020-11-06 17:04:16 +0800 <BainzyC> So many of them....  No wonder Trump is pissed off  @realDonaldTrump

1324432376727035905 2020-11-06 03:24:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Why do the Dems always get to control the count?
1324318971299057664 2020-11-05 19:53:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Brainy? No, it's sunny here 🧐
1324317335449206786 2020-11-05 19:47:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Defa who? No, my name's Bainzy? 🤪👍🇬🇧🍺

1324315827504644097 2020-11-05 19:41:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Now the Supreme Court has a set of true judges he might just be able to do something, thank God for ending Ginsberg, just in time!
1324311573620469761 2020-11-05 19:24:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Votes are being rejected because of the felt tip pens being given out at polling stations, in some cases ballpoint pens (legal use pens) are being taken off voters and they are being forced to use the felt tips instead, making the ballot paper invalid. #DirtyRottenFraud
1324309479937245184 2020-11-05 19:15:59 +0800 <BainzyC> WHAT?????......Mine's on the blink!!! 🤪👍🍺🇬🇧
1324307887414534144 2020-11-05 19:09:39 +0800 <BainzyC> I've seen this and many more instances, people burning his ballots, 1000s found in dumpsters and at the sides of the road, people buying votes, so many instances.
1324307386836934659 2020-11-05 19:07:40 +0800 <BainzyC> With the #ScumMedia, even the BBC in the UK backing up the fraud they might, it depends on how quickly and efficiently Trump's legal team act.  The odds are heavily stacked against Trump!
1324305686784868353 2020-11-05 19:00:54 +0800 <BainzyC> If they had any brains at all they would have trickled the dodgy votes in with the real ones, that way it would not be so obvious, chucking them all in at once was a big mistake, not adding Trump votes in also was a big mistake. 100K all Biden votes, no Trump? Yeah right! #Cheats
1324303629541584896 2020-11-05 18:52:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Things are going to get a lot hotter than this 😰
1324303274238005249 2020-11-05 18:51:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Great read, however, he did get the year wrong, he missed it by 36 years.
1324301623175401472 2020-11-05 18:44:45 +0800 <BainzyC> A process called fraud
1324296351132377089 2020-11-05 18:23:49 +0800 <BainzyC> If the scam is allowed and the courts won't listen to Trump, if you were him what would you do?
1324295635198185472 2020-11-05 18:20:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Biden and his cheaters will have no problem magically finding 30,001 if required...!  #WhatASham
1324294145054298113 2020-11-05 18:15:03 +0800 <BainzyC> I voted FRAUD!
1324261356246306818 2020-11-05 16:04:45 +0800 <BainzyC> I rest my case!
1324119296969158656 2020-11-05 06:40:16 +0800 <BainzyC> I wonder if the SHTF would the US military stand with Trump?🧐
1324116094353813505 2020-11-05 06:27:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Bad losers
1324109626640601088 2020-11-05 06:01:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Good question!
1324089215521619970 2020-11-05 04:40:44 +0800 <BainzyC> We have not witnessed a record vote in the US, we have, and are witnessing, a massive fraud, spewed out across the globe by #ScumMedia.  They must be held to account if found to have broken the law, if not, then the system is broken.
1324087414198018050 2020-11-05 04:33:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't make it obvious....Der!
1324084369749889026 2020-11-05 04:21:28 +0800 <BainzyC> You mean the dodgy ballots will decide? You messed up! You should have trickled the dodgy ones with the real ones to hide them, throwing them in all at once will expose any discrepancies. Too confident, you've been sussed I suspect!
1324083444230590464 2020-11-05 04:17:48 +0800 <BainzyC> I think they were 2 successful in their fraud, if only they had mixed the postal ballots with the 'on the day ones'. The postal votes for Biden are an obvious fraud, all coming in overwhelming amounts just where they R needed to fake a tight race, they will pip Trump at the post!
1323669359248769024 2020-11-04 00:52:22 +0800 <BainzyC> A Christmas of Terror or worse?  Their war goes on whilst we fall and fail to fight back.
1323665736976531457 2020-11-04 00:37:58 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm Sparticus 🤪👍🇬🇧🍺
1323635615292887040 2020-11-03 22:38:17 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump must not only retain The Whitehouse and The Senate, but he must also take The House.  When he has all three he can finally address the world's biggest problem  The #ScumMedia!
1323632150361657345 2020-11-03 22:24:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Who is voting for Biden, don't be shy, I won't laugh?
1323596601185783811 2020-11-03 20:03:15 +0800 <BainzyC> So inconsiderate of her, you better call her sister to cook for you... 🤪👍🇬🇧🍺

Because the west and all its institutions have been infiltrated by Islam and anti-Christian groups.  The war is hot and hidden!

1323409741297733634 2020-11-03 07:40:44 +0800 <BainzyC> We went to the heathen, we didn't invite them in and barrack them as we are doing now.  The Crusades were fought in Jerusalem and the EU did not exist, that landmass was made up of independent states, very much like what we will be next year!

1323398541532975104 2020-11-03 06:56:14 +0800 <BainzyC> I will not stop saying it until this fact becomes universally accepted:  Femi is one of those deluded losers that thinks his ranting on twitter is going to have any effect on an event that has happened and cannot be changed.  Poor sad twat, don't be like Femi, he'a joke!  #Brexit
1323397127482073089 2020-11-03 06:50:37 +0800 <BainzyC> A fat lot of good that does 'Standing'!  How many times have Christians stood for the murdered and mutilated?   How about showing a bit of backbone and say   ''Do that again and you'll be bloody sorry''  Boris the British people have had enough of this, we must defend our faith!
1323393510276554757 2020-11-03 06:36:14 +0800 <BainzyC> How would you rather die?

1323392378477096960 2020-11-03 06:31:45 +0800 <BainzyC> You horrible tosser!  We British wear poppies lest we forget the sacrifice of our heroes, our family members that died defending our values, values that allow twats like you to ridicule them.  Horrible tosser!
1323387658454896641 2020-11-03 06:12:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Because he fixed the vote?  They are too confident, they have fixed it I'm sure, there cannot be that many idiots in the US that would vote for Biden.

Trump supporters should not let Antifa or BLM or other US domestic terrorists get the upper hand, they need to be crushed, once and for all.  America must cleanse

1322477855641620480 2020-10-31 17:57:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Baron, there is only hearsay proving that this virus kills the elderly more, age kills us all. If we ever get to see the true records of how all so-called COVID victims really died, we may find out we have been had. If a Dr. says a patient was killed by COVID they get paid!
1322476652513890304 2020-10-31 17:52:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Only two months to go before we #Brexit 100%  Do you think that they will use #COVID19 to try and stop #Brexit?
1322474696022106113 2020-10-31 17:45:12 +0800 <BainzyC> During the war, we suffered far, far, far more than we are suffering now from this virus, however, it is going to cost us so much, much, much more now to recover.  KNOW YOUR ENEMY!
1322473666609844229 2020-10-31 17:41:07 +0800 <BainzyC> White people are becoming an endangered species in the UK!
1322467608017424384 2020-10-31 17:17:02 +0800 <BainzyC> If you have a small business, what % of your product price do you set aside for sales and marketing?
1322467075928039424 2020-10-31 17:14:55 +0800 <BainzyC> And if she doesn't do a runner! 🤣👍🇬🇧

1322460679975194624 2020-10-31 16:49:30 +0800 <BainzyC> No one lives forever! Only Jesus.
1322457866016608256 2020-10-31 16:38:19 +0800 <BainzyC> That's not the point of this post, the point is old people die, because old people die the world is being stopped, there has not even been a massive rise in deaths that can be the fault of this virus, most die because it was their time or their illnesses have caught up on them.
1322457226133573632 2020-10-31 16:35:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Are you just trying to look cool then? 🤣👍🇬🇧  https://t.co/J07sxqMk01
1322456857621991424 2020-10-31 16:34:19 +0800 <BainzyC> On a scale of 1-3,  1 being OK,  2 being angry  and 3 being livid  How do you generally feel right now with all that's going on in the world?
1322456211627872256 2020-10-31 16:31:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Because the UK has been infiltrated with islamists.
1322455459375304704 2020-10-31 16:28:46 +0800 <BainzyC> BREAKING NEWS  It looks like next week we may have a 100% lockdown, so get your hair done, catch COVID and go to the gym before you're locked up.

1322445823800651776 2020-10-31 15:50:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Let's all just get it and take our chances or it will never go away, we have done that for millions of years and humanity is still here!
1322445350532165633 2020-10-31 15:48:36 +0800 <BainzyC> 31st October is traditionally known as Halloween, however, Halloween in 2020 started 1st January.  https://t.co/Vl58rjbXR4

1322443870089740288 2020-10-31 15:42:43 +0800 <BainzyC> We should teach our kids politics in school, not brainwash them with Marxist ideologies.
1322442848730492928 2020-10-31 15:38:39 +0800 <BainzyC> We need a leader like Trump!
1322441839182532608 2020-10-31 15:34:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't be silly, Ali Baba looks after his own!
1322441301338607616 2020-10-31 15:32:30 +0800 <BainzyC> 07.31am and a lot of people in the UK are up and about.  Good morning countrymen and women and the other ones!  https://t.co/vw0hOOd1k2
1322439905117614080 2020-10-31 15:26:57 +0800 <BainzyC> I think that over the last years, in particular the #Brexit fiasco, we should have learnt that any government in the UK does not represent the people, they have wrestled sovereignty off the people and now only pay us lip service.
1322438615415332865 2020-10-31 15:21:50 +0800 <BainzyC> He is a crook, a perfect specimen of a Swamp Creature!

1322434608709935106 2020-10-31 15:05:55 +0800 <BainzyC> This is not for diversity reasons, this is cultural destruction. Our culture!!!!🤢🤮🤬🇬🇧
1322433403258572801 2020-10-31 15:01:07 +0800 <BainzyC> The Old are being punished for #Brexit I think 🤢🤮🤬
1322429769376477184 2020-10-31 14:46:41 +0800 <BainzyC> That might be what we are shown but the world is collapsing economically because it has been planned for a very long time, we will come out of this farce with a global cashless currency and a one-world leader, no rights only privileges! It's no secret, the world is being reset!
1322427374953205760 2020-10-31 14:37:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Boris, I fear, is not pulling the strings, bigger global players are making the rules.

1322260444103561216 2020-10-31 03:33:50 +0800 <BainzyC> We teach our little girls how to be boys and how to masturbate, our possible future enemy teaches their little girls how to behead! 🤢🤮🤬  https://t.co/ReYC8bD6tT

1321954332384919553 2020-10-30 07:17:28 +0800 <BainzyC> You can't expect anything except lies from the Dems.
1321953854620078081 2020-10-30 07:15:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Following recent beheadings we must acknowledge that these people only want to destroy our way of life, they do what this guy has done, they get into positions of power and destroy us within, using our own system against us. One day we will wake up and we will be all gone!
1321950188613869569 2020-10-30 07:01:00 +0800 <BainzyC> It must get on her tits that her nipples no longer point to the ceiling but the floor!  No wonder she is such a bad-tempered person. 🤣👍🇬🇧  https://t.co/M0s3Qn690E
1321946320165343237 2020-10-30 06:45:37 +0800 <BainzyC> His footsteps are louder than his supporters!
1321945514724724737 2020-10-30 06:42:25 +0800 <BainzyC> A huge number of them are imports who have no historical claim to the UK but are made equal to us because of our messed-up immigration system.  Of course, they want to destroy us, not only us but all of the Western or Free World as we used to call it.  Dark times are upon us!
1321943036667068418 2020-10-30 06:32:35 +0800 <BainzyC> If we keep hiding we will be destroyed!
1321933758061256704 2020-10-30 05:55:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Here is a start   https://t.co/ZyNP1R9epc

1321931246956589057 2020-10-30 05:45:44 +0800 <BainzyC> No one wants them, they are just trouble!
1321907391101886465 2020-10-30 04:10:56 +0800 <BainzyC> He is certainly no quitter, he has been stealing and selling America's secrets for decades, allegedly!   Biden will charge American's to 'fix' the virus but he is more likely to come up with a 'plan' to pocket the money for him and his mates!
1321906514219683854 2020-10-30 04:07:27 +0800 <BainzyC> and the French, for letting them loose in their waters!
1321903776823939072 2020-10-30 03:56:34 +0800 <BainzyC> ~What happened to black pound month? Did they manage to raise a quid? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1321902233127211015 2020-10-30 03:50:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Get a tan, change your name, shriek Ali Baba every now and then and get yourself a dinghy after a trip to France, then come back into the UK, bung your passport into the deep and claim you are 12 years old from Serbia, before you know it, you'll be living like a king.
1321901255376207872 2020-10-30 03:46:33 +0800 <BainzyC> We should all be worried, but our governments have made it illegal to worry, we have to accept the fact that we can be murdered and beheaded going to church or have our children raped.   We in The West are all in very serious trouble but we can't talk about it or try to fix it!
1321900337842790400 2020-10-30 03:42:54 +0800 <BainzyC> That treacherous 'Fog Horn' disappeared soon enough into the dustbin of history!
1321899544167276544 2020-10-30 03:39:45 +0800 <BainzyC> There is no such thing as a moderate Muslim, they all believe in jihad and they all believe that the world belongs to Islam.   If they say any different they can lie, they are allowed to lie about that.

1321893287343652865 2020-10-30 03:14:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Should the recent murders and beheadings committed by muslims be avenged?

1321861415104356354 2020-10-30 01:08:15 +0800 <BainzyC> What hospital? People are checking up on claims like yours and they are finding empty hospitals as well as empty testing centres. Facts, we need facts, not hearsay!
1321860175515557894 2020-10-30 01:03:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Sad but true!
1321858784080388096 2020-10-30 00:57:47 +0800 <BainzyC> How can anyone have confidence in a senile old pervert Nancy?  What do you know that you are not telling everyone?  Have you already rigged it so Trump cannot win?  You are making the 2020 election smell very fishy! 🤢🤮

1321848887888482312 2020-10-30 00:18:28 +0800 <BainzyC> The more self-sufficient we are the better, we should look at the way Switzerland does it.

1320659429713477632 2020-10-26 17:31:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Not until they have stolen the election, then they will dump him!  Until then, they will subdue all of the crimes he and his family have committed.
1320658760382226438 2020-10-26 17:29:19 +0800 <BainzyC> No, until they can get into the benefits system, a precursor for children to become 100% dependent on the state.
1320656047955189763 2020-10-26 17:18:33 +0800 <BainzyC> And empty bellies! ☠️

1320655056287469569 2020-10-26 17:14:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Define 'WE' IMHO 'We' is the #ScumMedia who have picked a black (obviously) dopey footballer to create a storm in a teacup to force the government to do something, exercising their power. This shitstorm is manufactured by scummy people we should not listen to. #ScumMedia is bad!
1320653935678525442 2020-10-26 17:10:09 +0800 <BainzyC> You should ask these, so starving kids, if they want their kids and grandkids to pay for their food, because that is who will pay, the national debt has caught COVID. Spending more &amp; more now will cripple generations to come, maybe even kill the welfare state. Keep killing Piers!
1320651960220082184 2020-10-26 17:02:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Their attack dogs the #ScumMedia are fuelling the constant bashing of on the government, we need to curb and fix that part of our system.  Media has gone rogue, it has abused its mandate and needs to be brought back into line.

1320373260454928387 2020-10-25 22:34:51 +0800 <BainzyC> They will vote after the election in places where they will affect Trump wins!   The Dems are going to use voter fraud so effectively as Biden said, they have created the best voter fraud scheme ever!

I think we should also resurrect the severest penalty for treason!

1319932397526405120 2020-10-24 17:23:01 +0800 <BainzyC> No, the lefty media is
1319932142902743041 2020-10-24 17:22:00 +0800 <BainzyC> Unfortunately, our police are now full of 'woke' university plebs that have been 'woke' brainwashed, they would never side with the people, the state stole their loyalty at nursery school.

1319930034270969857 2020-10-24 17:13:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Why indeed?   It's a leftie storm in a teacup to make the Tories look bad, using kids is a horrible thing to do but the left thrives on it.  'Kids in Cages' remember that in the US?  Obama built them, then his lefty hoards blamed Trump.  Lefties, globally, are wankers!
1319928255785349120 2020-10-24 17:06:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Not a good start to the day, went to ATM ordered some cash, forgot to take the cash, went back. Some thieving skank had nicked it :(

1319880450500927489 2020-10-24 13:56:36 +0800 <BainzyC> And who gets involved in it! The Chinese apparently have been videoing The Biden's in all sorts of this type of filth, it's not only on his laptop. One day we will bring them down, unfortunately, the most powerful are kept there because they have been compromised and blackmailed!
1319878907781402625 2020-10-24 13:50:28 +0800 <BainzyC> They hide it in plain sight, it's a satanic thing!

1319710697815756801 2020-10-24 02:42:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Do you really exist as a productive entity?  From what the world sees, you appear to be just a divisive, hate-mongering group of misfits and spiteful old hags.

1319668307922911232 2020-10-23 23:53:37 +0800 <BainzyC> As soon as a woman gives birth and signs the babies birth certificate, she gives ownership of the baby to the state.  The state should really take responsibility for all animals in their farms!

1319582207690801153 2020-10-23 18:11:29 +0800 <BainzyC> Mate or M8 as I like to say, is not gender-specific, it is the perfect salutation and a word of endearment for all genders
1319570014127726592 2020-10-23 17:23:02 +0800 <BainzyC> The big question all the guys are asking right now in Wales is: Can we still shag sheep? If so, at what time do we have to finish by? 🤣👍🇬🇧  PS.... I love the Welsh really, softer wool...
1319569271693987840 2020-10-23 17:20:05 +0800 <BainzyC> This is what happened.. #ScumMedia got a dopey footballer to campaign for free food for kids, made a big song and dance about it and got the suggestion put to the HoC, they rejected it, so #ScumMedia used that rejection to politically bash the government. They made and fanned it!
1319558846529011712 2020-10-23 16:38:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Pervy Joe said he'd like to kick Trump's ass, I think it would be better if they both got into a ring and physically fought it out, no gloves, no holds barred.   That would be fun, a fight to the death 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319558117512851456 2020-10-23 16:35:46 +0800 <BainzyC> He must be a father of one of the kids in that class, just looking out for him I expect! 🧐
1319556640438423557 2020-10-23 16:29:53 +0800 <BainzyC> My bad, I thought that was a Welsh female protest march! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319556096814612480 2020-10-23 16:27:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Latine Latina uti Twitter profile super hoc superbia te tamquam stultus! 😉👍🇬🇧
1319554389259018240 2020-10-23 16:20:57 +0800 <BainzyC> No, you are not alone! 😉👍🇬🇧
1319554185432530945 2020-10-23 16:20:08 +0800 <BainzyC> If he carries on the way he has for the last 4 years we won't have a deal with him, onthe otherhand, his stance, which is beginning to weaken, was one of the EU being superior to a runt of a nation trying to break from his club, by losing May &amp; not bending,we have dispelled that.
1319548072297463808 2020-10-23 15:55:51 +0800 <BainzyC> They are using fear &amp; an invisible enemy to force The Great Reset upon us, they are preparing it in so-called Global Institutions, institutions that are led by unelected people appointed in undemocratic ways. Democracy &amp; what the people think are of no concern to them only power!
1319546901784633346 2020-10-23 15:51:12 +0800 <BainzyC> Don't give up on us Jane, after such a long and arduous battle against the EU and their shills in our own country, we have our exit in view, it's not long now, we have the upper hand!
1319546139545403395 2020-10-23 15:48:10 +0800 <BainzyC> I think this small poll illustrates the pulse of the UK.  WE ARE FED UP AND WANT TO MOVE ON UNLESS THE EU PULLS IT'S FINGER OUT!
1319436838646566914 2020-10-23 08:33:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Let's see if you can hold that smile all night old boy!!
1319434606207225858 2020-10-23 08:24:58 +0800 <BainzyC> He's got it coming to him, that's for sure, Trump will make sure of that! 🤣👍  I think Pervy Joe might sweat a bit tonight.
1319433228969775105 2020-10-23 08:19:30 +0800 <BainzyC> 👍
1319428837705420800 2020-10-23 08:02:03 +0800 <BainzyC> @emilyhewertson Thank you Emily, the kettle is on 😉👍🇬🇧
1319428293591007233 2020-10-23 07:59:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Cheers M8 👍
1319426777274552320 2020-10-23 07:53:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Can you tell me please where can you watch it and what time GMT Emily?
1319426308913364997 2020-10-23 07:52:00 +0800 <BainzyC> You dad should roast him live on TV, expose him to the world!
1319425617792827392 2020-10-23 07:49:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Speaking to an empty field is far more difficult than speaking to a crowd, this is theatre, she believes that they have enough influence already to win so it doesn't matter what she says, it's only lip service, her smugness is putrid!
1319424725056184320 2020-10-23 07:45:42 +0800 <BainzyC> No one will be surprised if Trump makes Biden sweat tonight, not only Biden, a house of cards is on the verge of crumbling, a lot of people should be very worried about what your glorious president may say tonight or ask Honest Joe!
1319423514160529409 2020-10-23 07:40:54 +0800 <BainzyC> He was probably out of his tree!
1319423316491370497 2020-10-23 07:40:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Congratulations!! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319422815599316993 2020-10-23 07:38:07 +0800 <BainzyC> For a £tenner I'll tell you about me 🤣🧐👍
1319410592080416768 2020-10-23 06:49:33 +0800 <BainzyC> Wham BAME thank you maam!
1319408657797423106 2020-10-23 06:41:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Just had a thought!  What if during the Trump V Biden debate, Trump goes after Biden regarding all the latest revelations, Biden can't take it and has a heart attack and dies on stage, LIVE! 🧐  #ScumMedia would immediately go after Trump as a murderer.   #ItCouldHappen  🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1319403105348427781 2020-10-23 06:19:48 +0800 <BainzyC>  https://t.co/0eRLZ8Rare
1319394976380440576 2020-10-23 05:47:30 +0800 <BainzyC> They are doing a pretty good job exposing themselves, Trump just pushes them along!
1319394385214214147 2020-10-23 05:45:09 +0800 <BainzyC> I did get them but, ehhh....... They were empty when I bought them 🙄  https://t.co/UO3J5nMWwF
1319393526719893506 2020-10-23 05:41:44 +0800 <BainzyC> They nominated him as their best candidate, he was as dumb then as he is now. If he wins it won't be down to him, but the Deep State backing him.   He would be the perfect president to manipulate, unlike Trump The Disruptor.
1319392674416414723 2020-10-23 05:38:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Your account has been compromised and restricted, to release all features please send $100.00 to my PayPal account imarobbingbastard@gmail.com 🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1319391985447424003 2020-10-23 05:35:37 +0800 <BainzyC> Through voter fraud and big tech manipulation, he still could!
1319385911466053634 2020-10-23 05:11:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Because we are Great!
1319384578444886016 2020-10-23 05:06:11 +0800 <BainzyC> We only make up that saying to confuse you EU weirdos, of course you can have your cake and eat it, that's what cakes are for, Dodo!
1319383826590728192 2020-10-23 05:03:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Will Biden snatch defeat from the jaws of victory because he's been found out?
1319383418346573831 2020-10-23 05:01:34 +0800 <BainzyC> I did think of you.....I think? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319383039424778241 2020-10-23 05:00:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Diane Abbott has been messing in US politics again!!!! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1319380409768181762 2020-10-23 04:49:37 +0800 <BainzyC> You were late and they were going flat so I drank them for you, you really liked them! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319379280149811210 2020-10-23 04:45:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Sorry about that, but I thought the bars were going to shut tonight, so I needed a top-up *hic*  https://t.co/ZQ3Y9bp4pC
1319378664967049216 2020-10-23 04:42:41 +0800 <BainzyC> She left him, he gave her a love bite, she farted and flew out the window! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1319377027376599042 2020-10-23 04:36:10 +0800 <BainzyC> I've got your wallet!!! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319375527791202304 2020-10-23 04:30:13 +0800 <BainzyC> 220,000,000 died in the last few months in the US according to this pathetic clown, the population of the entire country is about 330,000,000.  The Dems are taking the piss, they believe the American people will believe anything!
1319371427162849280 2020-10-23 04:13:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Voting in the US elections has already started, what would happen if Biden got nicked and thrown in jail?   Surely, Trump would have to win by default?
1319366589343551488 2020-10-23 03:54:42 +0800 <BainzyC> When the Biden data is fully released I think the world should go back and reinvestigate #PizzaGate, find out why Obama paid $65,000 for a night of hotdogs!
1319366011439796224 2020-10-23 03:52:24 +0800 <BainzyC> The guy is on fire, I bet all the Bidens are shitting themselves right now 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319358888995639303 2020-10-23 03:24:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Poor Rodders, his son died recently 😨
1319357286922551296 2020-10-23 03:17:44 +0800 <BainzyC> They have the same agenda, a new type of global socialism run by maniacs.
1319356375214993408 2020-10-23 03:14:06 +0800 <BainzyC> It did!
1319355822745538560 2020-10-23 03:11:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Call the bank
1319355235064840193 2020-10-23 03:09:35 +0800 <BainzyC> If we feed children over the school holidays, who will end up paying forit? Not you or I, but those kids themselves or maybe even their grandchildren. This virus is costing trillions, it will take generations 2 pay it off, not just ours. Virtue signalling is expensive, some1 pays
1319352816369078272 2020-10-23 02:59:58 +0800 <BainzyC> They all know he's corrupt, if he goes down, many of them will fall too, I'm looking Obama's way, those to were pizza buddies!
1319343255448915975 2020-10-23 02:21:58 +0800 <BainzyC> +RIP+ warrior!🇬🇧
1319339340166762503 2020-10-23 02:06:25 +0800 <BainzyC> They are slowly going to stop us from being consumers.  When they are ready, and they almost are, what we consume will be decided for us.  The Big Reset is going to take over every aspect of our lives.  We are witnessing a global takeover!
1319330702945550341 2020-10-23 01:32:06 +0800 <BainzyC> I'm one of 9, my parents would never have lowered themselves to accept food from the state to feed their children.
1319329916400402432 2020-10-23 01:28:58 +0800 <BainzyC> So it pays to be a crook!
1319310352199393281 2020-10-23 00:11:14 +0800 <BainzyC> Sometimes it pays to take a step back to get a good look at what's happening 😉👍🇬🇧🍷
1319309563238166531 2020-10-23 00:08:06 +0800 <BainzyC> We are far worse than slaves, a slave does his work and his master feeds and shelters him, we 2020 slaves are far less fortunate, we do our work and pay for our own food and shelter and our masters for doing the work they want us to do. We are also paying for our own destruction!
1319302145242550272 2020-10-22 23:38:37 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319294296504164352 2020-10-22 23:07:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Wherever he is, I hope he is pooping his pants!
1319290086144364544 2020-10-22 22:50:42 +0800 <BainzyC> If what is being said is true, he should be in jail, maybe he is, he seems to have disappeared??
1319288180911206402 2020-10-22 22:43:08 +0800 <BainzyC> What's happening??????
1319284279889653760 2020-10-22 22:27:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Confirmed: Trump Has Footage Of Hunter Biden Raping And Torturing Little Girls - Set To Release  https://t.co/DWo5DpfUOA
1319283885860007943 2020-10-22 22:26:04 +0800 <BainzyC> They are, but somethings cannot be stopped, very bad, sick videos have been seen and shared, Trump has copies!
1319272148058341380 2020-10-22 21:39:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Like #pizzagate  The horrors that went on there were very quickly hidden, hopefully, it will all come out one day and the monsters involved punished.
1319236095318556672 2020-10-22 19:16:10 +0800 <BainzyC> PS... In your picture, I can see your underpants 😉👍
1319235860894785536 2020-10-22 19:15:14 +0800 <BainzyC> The old RT box you were able to just RT or make a reply, not it's just the same as the reply button. When you reply ONLY your followers see the post, before it went out into the Twittersphere
1319235323721809921 2020-10-22 19:13:06 +0800 <BainzyC> If you mean the blue button in the bottom right hand corner, that is a reply not a RT button  https://t.co/BjKePoAuS0
1319228419318702086 2020-10-22 18:45:39 +0800 <BainzyC> You must be twitter's little pet, I don't have any buttons there...?
1319227703397126146 2020-10-22 18:42:49 +0800 <BainzyC> Sometimes we must take the shock of horror to expose it so it doesn't happen anymore.  This is sick, but not the sickest, Biden Jr. is, it appears, attracted to our babies as much as his father 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
1319227160478044166 2020-10-22 18:40:39 +0800 <BainzyC> Spot on Mark, we humans are so gullible!

1319201006777962496 2020-10-22 16:56:44 +0800 <BainzyC> Start here, it's not a UK thing, it's a global thing, if Trump falls next month, then this will speed up and the ownership of the World and everything in it will change hands....   https://t.co/0eRLZ8Rare
1319199705553915904 2020-10-22 16:51:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Good idea! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319198316459065345 2020-10-22 16:46:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Classic 🤣👍🇬🇧
1319195956018106369 2020-10-22 16:36:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Very true!!  https://t.co/vQMD8N6zOZ
1319181865803259905 2020-10-22 15:40:40 +0800 <BainzyC> We are being played like a bunch of mugs! 🤢🤮
1319181208518000640 2020-10-22 15:38:03 +0800 <BainzyC> You voted to give away other peoples money to pay for other peoples responsibilities, it's a good job the Tories stopped your socialist shit festering in our UK.
1319179890709712897 2020-10-22 15:32:49 +0800 <BainzyC> He should be in an old folks home far away from children!
1319179151727824896 2020-10-22 15:29:53 +0800 <BainzyC> And they said we would crumble and fall! 🤣👍🇬🇧  We are BRITISH, and we are GREAT!

1318996865019510789 2020-10-22 03:25:33 +0800 <BainzyC> There is but you can't see it

1318985345241808897 2020-10-22 02:39:46 +0800 <BainzyC> Try adding 1+1
1318985057118375937 2020-10-22 02:38:37 +0800 <BainzyC> It would not matter, he is expendable, the real candidate would take her place and call in a Clinton or an Obama as VP.
1318980203532701696 2020-10-22 02:19:20 +0800 <BainzyC> There is no turning back, they are funnelling us into a way of life very different to what we can remember, the longer they keep the ruse going the more we will forget the old normal and the more likely we will be of accepting the new normal, or the #GreatReset as they call it!
1318976415866433538 2020-10-22 02:04:17 +0800 <BainzyC> The way we tweet has changed, you are being muzzled on here too. Try retweeting, it won't allow it, it only allows us to comment on an existing tweet when you press RT, now our tweets have no reach further than immediate followers.

1318953001797779459 2020-10-22 00:31:15 +0800 <BainzyC> @CrimeLdn Just imagine the uproar if someone started throwing all Halal stuff on the floor!
1318952522523037697 2020-10-22 00:29:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Now would be a very good time to look for ways to make extra money online!  https://t.co/R2JwsuZ3kt

1318815943649316864 2020-10-21 15:26:38 +0800 <BainzyC> I still have shivers when I think what could have happened to the UK If we went with May's deal! #NoDeal will save us the £33bil and give us the cleanest break. The EU will crawl back to us by March 2021 begging to trade with us, they will have to, we are too big a client to lose
1318814188144295938 2020-10-21 15:19:39 +0800 <BainzyC> He is a false candidate testing the Dems new vote-rigging strategy. If he does down in flames because Trump wins despite that rigging, he will be no great loss, if he wins Harris will take over as soon as he gets ill, which I think will be almost immediate.
1318811415587803136 2020-10-21 15:08:38 +0800 <BainzyC> That's my idea! 🤣👍🇬🇧🍷

1318808691341250561 2020-10-21 14:57:48 +0800 <BainzyC> It's not a tree anymore, 1st, we took its fruit and leaves, then it's branches and trunk now we are digging up its roots. By the time COVID is done, we'll all be left with only a stinking huge hole with nothing to replace it.   #TheGreatReset will offer us all false hope to heal!
1318801815350222853 2020-10-21 14:30:29 +0800 <BainzyC> He is being hunted because he has been a very naughty boy!🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1318801320099401729 2020-10-21 14:28:31 +0800 <BainzyC> It would B refreshing in a few years to see no new German, French, Italian or Spanish made cars on UK roads, just our own and others imported from around the world, there are a lot more brands out there that the European manufacturers have subdued for decades. #LiveTheBrexitDream
1318798862417563651 2020-10-21 14:18:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Very true, so sad, they then come out with worthless degrees no employer wants, saddled with immense debt, their brains fried by Marxist doctrines. It's an unforgivable waste that the US should be ashamed of for letting it happen.  https://t.co/cCf5nfl2rb

1318574831714041858 2020-10-20 23:28:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Not only do we want to leave with a #NoDeal, give you bugger all, many of us are drolling at picking off the international trade you do with the rest of the world. EU companies will be shackled as we reap the real benefits of AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD. You stuffed it mate!🤣👍🇬🇧🍷

1318551608263954432 2020-10-20 21:56:15 +0800 <BainzyC> The Great Reset! What do you know about it? It is a thing...
1318547035331637257 2020-10-20 21:38:05 +0800 <BainzyC> I knew it was coming, it was just a matter of how or when!   https://t.co/xd0bLcxwx7
1318532397114294272 2020-10-20 20:39:55 +0800 <BainzyC> Have you seen one or more of them?
1318528620999151616 2020-10-20 20:24:54 +0800 <BainzyC> Problem is, most of those so-called 'children' are 40+ years old, as we have seen time and time again.   The country is sick of it!   The Conservatives have the pulse of the nation, you don't!
1318527851654750208 2020-10-20 20:21:51 +0800 <BainzyC> TOP CLASS WANKER!
1318180715465482241 2020-10-19 21:22:27 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't understand???  Pervy Joe is so high in the polls, a done deal, he is choosing curtains for The Oval Office, something is not quite right??  Topmpoll was posted by a Biden supporter, I think he regrets starting it now 🤣🇬🇧👍🍷  https://t.co/lNIpXNDkY8
1318180067302907905 2020-10-19 21:19:53 +0800 <BainzyC> I think this poll backfired on the poster 🤣🇬🇧👍
1318156446899515392 2020-10-19 19:46:01 +0800 <BainzyC> I hope she does not die, in fact I hope she lives until she is 150 so that she can carry on despising the country that gave her refuge whilst it thrives around her!
1318155948175855616 2020-10-19 19:44:02 +0800 <BainzyC> He has been told he will win no matter what. After the 2016 election, Google, FB and twitter vowed that a Trump-like figure would NEVER win an election again, they have had 4 years to perfect a digital steal of the 2020 election.  Biden thinks he is sitting pretty, we'll see!
1318154309473832962 2020-10-19 19:37:32 +0800 <BainzyC> Have you got it in you to become A Godlion?  https://t.co/izfMyG0brd
1318153640310353922 2020-10-19 19:34:52 +0800 <BainzyC> I've only been blocked twice this morning, once by a muslim condoning the beheading in Paris and the other from a young'un thinking I'm a muslim supporter.  I must really up my game, I need at least 5 deals per day 🤣🇬🇧👍🍷
1318144028832051201 2020-10-19 18:56:41 +0800 <BainzyC> I've just come back from the Post office, walked all the way there to find I left the letter I wanted to post on the kitchen table. Grrrrr! 🙃😊

1318136757603414016 2020-10-19 18:27:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Just in case you missed it, I'm posting this again, this is Joe Biden, sniffing cocaine of a naked child!!!! 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮  https://t.co/O63he5iP1A

1318133185457364992 2020-10-19 18:13:35 +0800 <BainzyC> Who in government? These individuals that make these decisions need to be held to account!

1318126749214007297 2020-10-19 17:48:01 +0800 <BainzyC> I just don't understand why, I would like to know who on earth started this perversion and ask them to give a reason.
1318124968102793216 2020-10-19 17:40:56 +0800 <BainzyC> My pleasure
1318117524664438784 2020-10-19 17:11:21 +0800 <BainzyC> BTW it is physically impossible to 'Fuck Off' alone, as the act requires at least two people 😉🍷

1318113489353908225 2020-10-19 16:55:19 +0800 <BainzyC> The poor East End!   What a shame, that place has never been Mayfair but now its worse than The Black Hole of Calcutta.  London as a whole is now more BAME that English, it would take a civil war to win that back...
1318112600933228544 2020-10-19 16:51:48 +0800 <BainzyC> First, the laws have to change, right now we are still in transition from the EU, their laws trump our own, then after 01.01.21 at the latest, we have to address our Blair's judges which are destroying our own laws, then and only then can we guarantee real meaningful change.
1318111926753394699 2020-10-19 16:49:07 +0800 <BainzyC> I think I can say I'm finished now, you will miss me when I'm gone! 🖐️
1318110642017046528 2020-10-19 16:44:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Have you been to that part of the woods recently? If not go there for a drive round, it does not look like it used to, the demographics have completely changed.
1318110176076091392 2020-10-19 16:42:09 +0800 <BainzyC> But Jane, you're such a pleasant target 🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1318110017401327616 2020-10-19 16:41:32 +0800 <BainzyC> As a landlord consider it this way...  What happens if you don't pour a pint of Guinness properly?  Some things just take time, if you don't give them the time they need they fuck up!
1318109477342793731 2020-10-19 16:39:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe you should go help them then Tommy?   See if you can do better with what they were given from May?
1318108654873268224 2020-10-19 16:36:07 +0800 <BainzyC> It's the ginger coming out, there are never ANY good ginger hair days 🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1318105471371431938 2020-10-19 16:23:28 +0800 <BainzyC> Will I be professionally looked after and receive special care if I smash up a mosque?  No, I won't, I will be demonised GLOBALLY and the legal system would throw the book at me, probably The Bible if it didn't burn their hands touching it.
1318104175255916545 2020-10-19 16:18:19 +0800 <BainzyC> Can't we just build a wall around Liverpool or put an EPA dome like the one in The Simpsons Movie over it?   I doubt anyone living there would be missed and students are two a penny! 🧐
1318103162788712449 2020-10-19 16:14:17 +0800 <BainzyC> They have a lot on their plate before they can clear up Blair's treacherous mess, we have a pandemic to deal with, Brexit and other major issues that need resolving. Rome was not built in a day nor laws passed that are needed for those changes.
1318101797945397248 2020-10-19 16:08:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Because the law holds her back, every move she makes they find a way to block her, they even pull illegals off planes that she has fought hard to deport. Our biggest enemy is our own legal system when it comes to removing illegals. Blair made sure of that, this is his doing!
1318098917301637121 2020-10-19 15:57:25 +0800 <BainzyC> The FBI was in on it, if not leading it
1318097369867706369 2020-10-19 15:51:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Belgium is an islamic country now
1318097081194729473 2020-10-19 15:50:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Get rid of those judges completely, they are a legacy of Arch Liar Blair, they are foreign to the UK.
1318096173878681600 2020-10-19 15:46:31 +0800 <BainzyC> 10 minutes with me and he'd be signing it with his own blood that's for sure!
1318095276901605376 2020-10-19 15:42:57 +0800 <BainzyC> I do this quite often, but I lie on my kitchen table and face it to the house on the other side of the street, not because I get any psychic benefits or whatever, I do it because I just don't like the bloke who lives over there 🤣👍🇬🇧🍷
1318093704180256770 2020-10-19 15:36:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Arrested and then what? Can't we nail him to it??? 🧐
1318092892360101888 2020-10-19 15:33:29 +0800 <BainzyC> We must turn it, things have gone too far now!
1318091925640089600 2020-10-19 15:29:38 +0800 <BainzyC> If he is a teacher recommend to him a book that will correct his deluded, backwards ways and lead him to a better place   https://t.co/QGhfaS8FST

1318083428357636097 2020-10-19 14:55:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Good riddance, I wish he'd take his M8s with him!
1318083238938742784 2020-10-19 14:55:07 +0800 <BainzyC> And the coward has blocked me! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1318082973032468481 2020-10-19 14:54:04 +0800 <BainzyC> He is a muslim condoning the beheading!
1318080826190548994 2020-10-19 14:45:32 +0800 <BainzyC> 'You're' is that what you are going to say next? If so I'll piss on your bonfire before you do 🤣
1318080296269631488 2020-10-19 14:43:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Like your something special you stupid twat 🤣
1318041166617694209 2020-10-19 12:07:56 +0800 <BainzyC> Our incentive to 'Make our own' will only increase and France will lose a customer.

1318036001919557634 2020-10-19 11:47:25 +0800 <BainzyC> In your opinion
1317915775764779010 2020-10-19 03:49:41 +0800 <BainzyC> The last 1st lady was a bloke, Harry would not be the first bitch guy to play 2nd fiddle at The Whitehouse!
1317914038253355013 2020-10-19 03:42:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Before diversity was forced upon us, Fish &amp; Chips was our national dish, more fish, cheaper fish, we can bring back part of our heritage and improve the lives of our fishermen and that part of our domestic economy. Not all doom and gloom unless you make your living being it!
1317911882775277568 2020-10-19 03:34:13 +0800 <BainzyC> In 2020 one of the hardest parts of any new life is getting past your mother's desire to murder you before you are born!   #AbortionIsMurder

1317880622094974984 2020-10-19 01:30:00 +0800 <BainzyC> So this is why they are being let in, to destroy our culture!🤢🤮
1317879793401081857 2020-10-19 01:26:42 +0800 <BainzyC> What he did was expess his right to free speech, it did not deserve him to be brutally beheaded by a religious loonie. He was teaching the kids, not chopping their bloody heads off! #FFS
1317879100623781889 2020-10-19 01:23:57 +0800 <BainzyC> The country has been also been asset stripped 🤢🤮
1317811692642979842 2020-10-18 20:56:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Those that fail due to lack of planning will be preceded by #Brexit advantage takers, they should already be looking further afield for more exotic flavours. UK inclusive, you can go into almost any shop in the EU and the same stuff is being sold, unlike what could be available!
1317806609507225601 2020-10-18 20:35:54 +0800 <BainzyC> I think the Dems have used up all their Ace cards and their two Jokers, the only thing left is the Trump card, which they don't have. People will not keep swallowing Russia, it's becoming a joke even for the Dems. ***TRUMP2020***
1317805856130478080 2020-10-18 20:32:54 +0800 <BainzyC> We don't do outrage well, to the left outrage is a weapon. If we were really outraged we would be out in the streets now instead of talking about it on twitter. It's our fault we don't get him the headlines (no pun intended) that he deserves.
1317804356666855429 2020-10-18 20:26:56 +0800 <BainzyC> She does!
1317802490801410054 2020-10-18 20:19:32 +0800 <BainzyC> No backflips???  Pfft.... I'm not interested! 🧐🍷
1317797455287799818 2020-10-18 19:59:31 +0800 <BainzyC> The guy is a fraud, he is being used to make the way for someone else...
1317795954167341057 2020-10-18 19:53:33 +0800 <BainzyC> He should at least be tried!
1317795582501675011 2020-10-18 19:52:04 +0800 <BainzyC> What if they turn out to be true?
1317794934527827969 2020-10-18 19:49:30 +0800 <BainzyC> There's no fun in that?🤣👍🇬🇧🍷

1315941410772787202 2020-10-13 17:04:15 +0800 <BainzyC> Did your nose grow Pervy Joe when you wrote that statement?

1315691731027976194 2020-10-13 00:32:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Being a lesbian of unspecified gender shouldn't she be Majordomo Dick and not Dame?  I don't know how it works these days, so confusing!!

1315644838780506113 2020-10-12 21:25:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Watch how quickly the new COVID terminology spreads, new from now is the 'tier' system, the 'R number' confused people, 'Infected' number is confusing as well, people think that number will die.

1315593578282987520 2020-10-12 18:02:06 +0800 <BainzyC> 10 minutes ago I predicted sub-0 rates &amp; hey presto, the banks are talking about it. We are all being screwed folks and it's too late to change it, if only we embraced our fears 10 years ago we could have avoided what's coming, now nothing can stop it.The lunatics WILL take over!

1315591578149433344 2020-10-12 17:54:09 +0800 <BainzyC> We R borrowing money on a scale that has never been seen before as we destroy the businesses that should be the means to pay it back. SO, ask yourself the question, apart from money what else have you got to trade, then minus your assets what then? Your ASS is on the table folks!
1315590678047580161 2020-10-12 17:50:34 +0800 <BainzyC> To pay for all this money our leaders are borrowing on our behalf has to be paid back with interest sooner or later. The lenders have to think of themselves first so I predict very soon negative interest rates and higher fees from banks to hold our money. #TheGreatestTheftEver

All along I have been saying that our NHS is going to end up as our SS, they are saving untold amounts not doing everyday work whilst our hospitals sit empty. Next the poisonous injections!
1315575654650441728 2020-10-12 16:50:52 +0800 <BainzyC> California is just about to hit him with a mega tax bill too, his little 'woke' angel's actions are beginning to bite him...

1315406744592551938 2020-10-12 05:39:41 +0800 <BainzyC> asked me to poke my bum out, I did as instructed and I asked him if it would help cure them, the doctor said  ''No'', confused I asked him why he wanted me to poke my smelly grape-like piles out the window, he replied, ''I don't like the guy opposite looking at us''...
1315406136963674112 2020-10-12 05:37:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Funny enough I went to see my doctor yesterday suffering from severe piles, he asked me to drop his pants and show them to him, he gasped and said that the huge pile of smelly grape-like structures hanging from my bum was the worst he had ever seen, he guided me to the window and

The United Kingdom is one of the wealthiest advanced societies that has ever walked the planet, we don't need EU bureaucrats to tell us how to look after our home, we can do that ourselves, better than the EU because we are less restricted by bureaucracy.
1315040354199048192 2020-10-11 05:23:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Government seems to be led by the mainstream media and the looney left, we pay them to look after our interests not to fulfil nefarious agendas...

1315021534927388672 2020-10-11 04:09:00 +0800 <BainzyC> One of the top that's for sure, nothing on this planet has ever had more influence than The British Empire!
1315019992363081729 2020-10-11 04:02:52 +0800 <BainzyC> I travelled the world searching for a Cunt Tree! I heard it everywhere I went but I never found one?? 🤣👍🇬🇧
1315019357995630592 2020-10-11 04:00:21 +0800 <BainzyC> We forget sometimes how 'Great' Great Britain is, we should nurture our Greatness instead of being ashamed of it.   I LOVE GREAT BRITAIN!  RT if you do too!  https://t.co/lWvuFMM1Qf
1315018473941143553 2020-10-11 03:56:50 +0800 <BainzyC> How many marches have we heard the chant 'Fuck Trump'?  How many signs and interviewees have said the same? It's a nothing burger!
1315015840786460673 2020-10-11 03:46:22 +0800 <BainzyC> 90% of all of the defunct #FBPE have turned #Brexiteer!

1315014816466075648 2020-10-11 03:42:18 +0800 <BainzyC> I would much rather discuss #Brexit than COVID.  REMOANERS, are you coming out to play tonight?  My wine is being wasted 🤣🇬🇧
1315013633978634240 2020-10-11 03:37:36 +0800 <BainzyC> I've now got over 500 followers, it's about time I came clean with you lot, you're all following me but you've got no idea, that I don't know where the fuck I'm going!!! 🤛🇬🇧🤜🏴‍☠️🤣
1315012193210052610 2020-10-11 03:31:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Pence told you in front of the world that that is NOT true Kamala. U have very little respect for the people U want to vote for U, U treat them like bloody fools who cannot see through the lies U tell. U are typical of an untrustworthy politician that people are really sick of!
1315010934767845376 2020-10-11 03:26:53 +0800 <BainzyC> He stood on a #Brexit deal at all costs, if its no deal that's what it is, all bets are off with the EU come 01.01.2021 unless they start playing ball, hopefully, sooner but that date is the date!
1315010330259525638 2020-10-11 03:24:29 +0800 <BainzyC> A #NoDealBrexit is infinitely better than any deal the EU can give us now. We must break free 100% from them for them to really understand that we have left.   Then we can work on doing a deal, they think they still own us, they will try and get hooks into us whenever they can.
1315009146354372608 2020-10-11 03:19:46 +0800 <BainzyC> no, they don't realise the rich can go anywhere where taxes are low, look at Facebook and Google, they pay almost nothing in most countries, yet they are so cash-rich...  The rich are rich not because they spend money but because they find ways NOT to spend money!
1315008154162393089 2020-10-11 03:15:50 +0800 <BainzyC> Nicola Tesla without doubt
1315007291616382978 2020-10-11 03:12:24 +0800 <BainzyC> I used to love it, make a few ££ and have a great community party.
1315006715780378624 2020-10-11 03:10:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Postal fraud is already being discovered everywhere, never in the favour of Trump!
1315006423802277890 2020-10-11 03:08:57 +0800 <BainzyC> and theft!
1315006089470119943 2020-10-11 03:07:38 +0800 <BainzyC> Rupert, you forgot to add 'and some shitty memes'.
1315001203382718464 2020-10-11 02:48:13 +0800 <BainzyC> Nor does your vote!
1314988089660657665 2020-10-11 01:56:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Seeing as we are so good at breaking laws and rules, let's break that one and any other that does not sit well with us post-Brexit, if we are going to do it, let's do it in style!
1314983013818736641 2020-10-11 01:35:56 +0800 <BainzyC> Bigger things than Boris are in play right now, the world is going to hit crunch point very soon...
1314982561077231617 2020-10-11 01:34:08 +0800 <BainzyC> Its here folks, what the conspiracy theorists have been warning about for the last few decades, it's beginning to rear its ugly head! The NWO is making its move, the new normal is going to be a living nightmare, say goodbye to anything you own because WE will own it soon!
1314979786964504576 2020-10-11 01:23:07 +0800 <BainzyC> Deafness and blindness....
1314979396525137920 2020-10-11 01:21:33 +0800 <BainzyC> And they will all be pedantic little bedwetters with no friends who enjoy fucking up someone's day, like traffic wardens but worse!
1314978980123074560 2020-10-11 01:19:54 +0800 <BainzyC> I predict the NHS is going to end up like the SS.
1314978247189422083 2020-10-11 01:16:59 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't think 10 pints &amp; a bottle of voddie would make her look attractive for me!!
1314977387713646593 2020-10-11 01:13:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Invite her to her home, see how much that will cost you, you should also find out how many sick relatives she has and how many emergency operations need desperately paying for. 🤣👍🇬🇧
1314975740753063936 2020-10-11 01:07:02 +0800 <BainzyC> Dick by name.......
1314975460812623872 2020-10-11 01:05:55 +0800 <BainzyC> How do we win it back?  There are not enough traditional Londoners left to vote against the BAME hoards that have taken it over.
1314974481006419972 2020-10-11 01:02:01 +0800 <BainzyC> They should have made burgers outta the slimy runts.
1314973020566544384 2020-10-11 00:56:13 +0800 <BainzyC> So do the police who troll twatter now 🤣👍🇬🇧
1314930896336814081 2020-10-10 22:08:50 +0800 <BainzyC> He made the choice to bugger off so he is buggered off!
1314928969037369344 2020-10-10 22:01:11 +0800 <BainzyC> PM is not good enough for #Boris, he wants to be King of The World, maybe the globalists have got to him?
1314928433588326400 2020-10-10 21:59:03 +0800 <BainzyC> What is happening with notifications? None showing but plenty when clicked on, half my posts are being hidden I think, this censorship is going beyond a joke...
1314836857444761600 2020-10-10 15:55:09 +0800 <BainzyC> Across the globe, every country is in the same position, those offering the bribes have very, very deep pockets, so deep it feels like the money as we know it, is going out of fashion!
1314835508149784576 2020-10-10 15:49:48 +0800 <BainzyC> Did our PM?
1314835301404114945 2020-10-10 15:48:58 +0800 <BainzyC> The same agenda worldwide, how much are our leaders getting paid to sell us out? And it does appear, we are being sold out!
1314834816962093057 2020-10-10 15:47:03 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes or no or is it too 'Old Manish? I must buy British!  https://t.co/auxSmkWZ2g
1314832280460947456 2020-10-10 15:36:58 +0800 <BainzyC> Agenda21
1314830855702011904 2020-10-10 15:31:19 +0800 <BainzyC> They were and greatly missed, I feel sorry for kids these days, they have no idea how to be young!
1314830441007001600 2020-10-10 15:29:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes or no or is it too old manish? I must buy British!  https://t.co/TLv0kW2LU3
1314828437945753601 2020-10-10 15:21:42 +0800 <BainzyC> You could always get a refund on the Lucozade bottle, they were highly-priced to kids, finding one was like finding a pot of gold, 10p being the prize, a small fortune, a 20 x blackjack bonanza 🤣👍🇬🇧
1314827688427872257 2020-10-10 15:18:43 +0800 <BainzyC> #MeToo
1314827574355333120 2020-10-10 15:18:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes it is but I feel no remorse, I might as well watch a match at the local park, the ambience is just as good these days, besides, when they knelt to Marxist destroyers they showed no loyalty to me so my loyalty to them ended.
1314825319958937600 2020-10-10 15:09:19 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't nor won't watch football again, a life long West Ham United fan no more, enough is enough!
1314823771677691904 2020-10-10 15:03:10 +0800 <BainzyC> I've had the same :(
1314823675527520257 2020-10-10 15:02:47 +0800 <BainzyC> The correct colour
1314822827544129536 2020-10-10 14:59:24 +0800 <BainzyC> London has become a tip, fill yer boots!
1314678486817214465 2020-10-10 05:25:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Leary Queen of Scots!🤣👍🇬🇧
1314676682440216577 2020-10-10 05:18:41 +0800 <BainzyC> No, they are following their well-published plan, Agenda21.  21 begins in less than 3 x months, everything will make sense soon, not good sense.

1314552621131354114 2020-10-09 21:05:42 +0800 <BainzyC> If I don't have to cut anything off or tuck it away, I think I will become a lesbian for the day, grab myself a little lesy bird. If it works out, I might remain one.  Gender is fluid for everyone I'm told! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1314549967915298816 2020-10-09 20:55:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Ego tripping!

1314497430755454976 2020-10-09 17:26:24 +0800 <BainzyC> You mean elevated him to a clown, he was the village idiot before!
1314497253516738560 2020-10-09 17:25:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Every cloud has a silver lining! 🤣👍🇬🇧
1314496251090665472 2020-10-09 17:21:43 +0800 <BainzyC> He will die soon if he doesn't tow the correct narrative! :(
1314495712902733824 2020-10-09 17:19:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Stripped, whipped and then deported or just thrown into the sea after, a deep part!
1314495281011068928 2020-10-09 17:17:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Rubbish, the MSM is after white people globally, you are all #ScumMedia

1314236331258720256 2020-10-09 00:08:53 +0800 <BainzyC> I miss people's smiles with everyone wearing masks!
1314235872397742080 2020-10-09 00:07:03 +0800 <BainzyC> We can all see what you are doing Yasmin!   By that tweet you know it will provoke comments such as   'If you don't like it here...whatever'   so that you can harvest the comments and say they belong to the racist white people, you are a race-baiter nothing more.   Disgusting! 🤮
1314102474102525952 2020-10-08 15:16:59 +0800 <BainzyC> You are such a  YUGE liar!
1313874870791438341 2020-10-08 00:12:34 +0800 <BainzyC> They tell us we have improved but I remember before, we have not improved IMHO!
1313874663873941504 2020-10-08 00:11:45 +0800 <BainzyC> HORRIFIC :(  NOT FOR THE SENSITIVE.  Adrenochrome Human Trafficking Celebrity Fail  https://t.co/GsFn1FyRVg via @YouTube

1313813771446620160 2020-10-07 20:09:47 +0800 <BainzyC> What's the death rate of those that died of ONLY COVID19? That is the only number that matters to most people but the number we are never given. Why not?

1313764878683967494 2020-10-07 16:55:30 +0800 <BainzyC> But not the media.... Without cheap TV, COVID19 , #Bnew expensive rexit etc they would have to produce programmes, we are being brainwashed with shit from the #ScumMedia because they are cheap!

1313753175766302721 2020-10-07 16:09:00 +0800 <BainzyC> It's a very successful tactic for their handlers, by shutting down debate they propagate their own brainwashing...
1313752264545370112 2020-10-07 16:05:22 +0800 <BainzyC> That's too clever a word for me Phil 😊👍
1313749341123874817 2020-10-07 15:53:45 +0800 <BainzyC> REALITY CHECK!! This is twitter, a digital platform where people come to rant and rave, what I say and what you say on here has little relevance to anything, if you want change, become an activist, scoring points on here is pointless, its only an ego trip, have a good one!! 😉👍
1313740296753209345 2020-10-07 15:17:49 +0800 <BainzyC> They love minority rights until they become the majority then they abolish minority rights. A proven plan of action that has allowed islam to devour nations.  This fellow put his faith in them, he paid the price, there is always a price!
1313739443673673729 2020-10-07 15:14:26 +0800 <BainzyC> The passing of a Great British Warrior! 💪🇬🇧💪 +RIP+ Lest we forget!
1313738386201509898 2020-10-07 15:10:14 +0800 <BainzyC> All MSM in the UK spew the same propaganda, a constant slander of everything that we perceive as NORMAL.  We must be very watchful, what they are destroying must be replaced with something else.  What is that 'Something Else?' and who controls it?
1313736585192636416 2020-10-07 15:03:04 +0800 <BainzyC> Let the scientists and doctors decide, politicians are not qualified.

1313731042059091968 2020-10-07 14:41:03 +0800 <BainzyC> She is not saying HUGE numbers, she is saying 6 is a non-number, it could be any small number, there is no science behind that number.
1313730581054840832 2020-10-07 14:39:13 +0800 <BainzyC> It's too early for that!!!!! 🤣👍

1313729874830520321 2020-10-07 14:36:24 +0800 <BainzyC> No it won't, far from it, COVID19  and the cost to the world will take generations to pay off, it has cost more than WW1 and WW2 combined and yet they are still printing money out of control.  The day will come when the COVID bill will need to be settled...OR ELSE! #GlobalSetUp!
1313729106702467072 2020-10-07 14:33:21 +0800 <BainzyC> We must nip #Boris in the bud otherwise #Brexit Britain could become a totalitarian hellhole!

He is certainly the greatest politician of my life time, a genuine legend, master trollster and an all-round funny guy.  ***TRUMP2020***  https://t.co/fvAQdYDpsb
1313516032460546048 2020-10-07 00:26:40 +0800 <BainzyC> What a crock of shit from The Washington Post as usual #ScumMedia   What compassion did the left offer?   A cruel, long, painful death seemed to be the narrative.  Trump has stuffed you losers once again by returning more powerful from COVID than when he got it.  God Bless Trump!

1313408536253280258 2020-10-06 17:19:31 +0800 <BainzyC> Funchal is a very small airport, just imagine doing it at Heathrow or JFK, the time and resources required would be massive, it's not just taking the tests, it's processing them too.

1313401076339675137 2020-10-06 16:49:53 +0800 <BainzyC> He should never surrender, the EU are ruthless, they would cut their own nose off just to spite their face, so far he has kept his nerve, he must carry on to the bitter end.

1313189125080715264 2020-10-06 02:47:39 +0800 <BainzyC> I am beginning to think that they know something that the rest of us don't. It appears that they are committing commercial suicide but more and more of the big ones are doing it?????
1313188634032517123 2020-10-06 02:45:42 +0800 <BainzyC> I've stopped watching football altogether since it decided to become political.

1313181327508877312 2020-10-06 02:16:40 +0800 <BainzyC> Not ALL Americans are stupid, the loonie left over there suffer from the same brain deadening disease as the loonie left do in the UK!
1313180554746097665 2020-10-06 02:13:36 +0800 <BainzyC> Your endorsement should lose Sainsbury's 17.4 million+ customers 🤣
1313179325085233152 2020-10-06 02:08:43 +0800 <BainzyC> The same happened in Rhodesia, the country starved!
1313178402023706630 2020-10-06 02:05:03 +0800 <BainzyC> 🤣👍  https://t.co/mbkHNOvU4e
1313177198673657859 2020-10-06 02:00:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Not good, I already spend 14 days fumigating myself after leaving Wales 🤣
1313176603938168838 2020-10-06 01:57:54 +0800 <BainzyC> It would take him 5 minutes to get that monster ass off the ground 🤣👍
1313175333466787840 2020-10-06 01:52:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Not even the lion could eat that fat twat all at once, the king of the cats would need a doggie bag!🤣
1313174428331773953 2020-10-06 01:49:15 +0800 <BainzyC> She is a beautiful, smart woman!
1313174222156509184 2020-10-06 01:48:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Retweet if you would like to give that fat twat a 10-minute headstart and hunt HIM!
1313162341295456256 2020-10-06 01:01:14 +0800 <BainzyC> And I thought it was COVID19 😊👍
1313162094318096385 2020-10-06 01:00:15 +0800 <BainzyC> We need judges with balls that will lock those monsters up for good, in Oxford, they are too wet and woke!
1313160528424992768 2020-10-06 00:54:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Lovely 😊👍
1313159111110995972 2020-10-06 00:48:24 +0800 <BainzyC> I have a little 'Thing' for her, she's lovely :P
1313157910885793794 2020-10-06 00:43:37 +0800 <BainzyC> They have some prime real estate 👍
1313157185715793923 2020-10-06 00:40:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Jugged Hare 🤢🤮
1313135573079650306 2020-10-05 23:14:52 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump will come out of isolation a Superhero who defeated COVID19 with little or no effort, an elderly, obese man who destroyed the #ScumMedia narrative!
1313130286214008833 2020-10-05 22:53:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Like a moose would miss a hatrack 🤣
1313129645852815360 2020-10-05 22:51:18 +0800 <BainzyC> Please wear a muzzle for the sake of truth! 🤣👍
1313129410531336193 2020-10-05 22:50:22 +0800 <BainzyC> Without the roar of the crowd, ego-maniacs badly perform!

1313117835489619968 2020-10-05 22:04:23 +0800 <BainzyC> They are a drain on the UK's coffers, relics to the disastrous BLiar days, they should be sacked, they are not needed.
1313117513065132037 2020-10-05 22:03:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Because they have warned the UK will sink into the sea if we #Brexit, for them any good news makes them look like twats!
1313115321214078980 2020-10-05 21:54:23 +0800 <BainzyC> Boobies are lovely 😀👍
1313114731574554625 2020-10-05 21:52:03 +0800 <BainzyC> He has been given special medication 'Liberal Tears' 🤣👍
1313114494235799552 2020-10-05 21:51:06 +0800 <BainzyC> BAME Broadcasting Corporation is Anti-British!
1313111468359987200 2020-10-05 21:39:05 +0800 <BainzyC> Trump is offering himself as a guinea pig taking experiential drugs, if they work on an elderly obese guy they should work on almost anyone, maybe even eliminate the need for a vaccine. What other world leader would do that?   The guy is a legend. ***TRUMP2020***
1313110020981223425 2020-10-05 21:33:20 +0800 <BainzyC> @OldProgger 🤣
1313109790143504384 2020-10-05 21:32:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Have you ever heard the saying 'Flogging a dead horse?' 🤣👍  Finding a mate in 2020 is a lot different than trying to find a date in 2019 was. 🤣👍😊
1313070101386723329 2020-10-05 18:54:42 +0800 <BainzyC> Obviously, we don't think the same, many companies are looking at EU companies licking their lips, once out of the EU grasp EU companies are sitting ducks, the EU knows this very well, why else do they want their 'level playing field'?  The UK will thrive off won EU business.
1313068733741625344 2020-10-05 18:49:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Have women become so equal that they are now no longer women, but they are now classed as men?  Surely that is sexist? Why aren't men classed as women? Things become confusing when you lie about nature!
1313067745806876672 2020-10-05 18:45:20 +0800 <BainzyC> Not 'Awake' but 'Woke' there is a huge difference, 'Woke' is a deluded movement, being 'Awake' is understanding the delusions of the 'Woke'.
1313066298209898497 2020-10-05 18:39:35 +0800 <BainzyC> ''In MY Captain's Chair''.  Where is HE, Her Captain?  If she wants to get pedantic we can all do that 🤣
1313065175721947137 2020-10-05 18:35:08 +0800 <BainzyC> Or even male 😀
1313064444637982720 2020-10-05 18:32:13 +0800 <BainzyC> How about having the ability to undercut EU businesses on trading with the rest of the world? We have our eyes on many vulnerable EU companies that will not be able to compete with our company because of EU restrictions..
1313056445638860802 2020-10-05 18:00:26 +0800 <BainzyC> Figures from 2021 only will reflect what #Brexit has done to our economy. Unless you are a witch or weirdo you can't predict them :)
1313054677706080258 2020-10-05 17:53:25 +0800 <BainzyC> It did but during the transition, we are still subject to EU rules so in effect we have not left yet, on 01.01.21 we are on our own, our rules, no EU say in anything anymore.
1313054074883969025 2020-10-05 17:51:01 +0800 <BainzyC> Whinging optimism is acceptable in a post #Brexit world, get used to it, #BrexitedBritain will be your home very soon :)
1313053618447282178 2020-10-05 17:49:12 +0800 <BainzyC> IF I grew wings I could probably fly! There is no place for pessimism in a post #Brexit UK
1313053092011794432 2020-10-05 17:47:07 +0800 <BainzyC> British is Best for Britain!
1313052510937063424 2020-10-05 17:44:48 +0800 <BainzyC> Losers are still losing and whinging and whining, #Brexit is only a few breaths away!
1313051864133402624 2020-10-05 17:42:14 +0800 <BainzyC> They have shown their true colours, not their skins!!
1313051597690343424 2020-10-05 17:41:10 +0800 <BainzyC> Would Trump's &amp; Melania's rapid recoveries from COVID19 leave you with suspicions that maybe this virus is not as bad as they say it is and make you want to look closer at the deaths recorded? Did they all die JUST of COVID19 or other things as well, like old age etc? Worrying!!
1313050509675237379 2020-10-05 17:36:51 +0800 <BainzyC> Cheers John!

1312862834309713920 2020-10-05 05:11:06 +0800 <BainzyC> Because they lose at everything else!
1312862431216128001 2020-10-05 05:09:30 +0800 <BainzyC> They say masturbation keeps the virus away?  Build up your immunity with every stroke 🤣👍
1312862025761067011 2020-10-05 05:07:53 +0800 <BainzyC> 30 days until you are badly humiliated Joe, 31 days until you retire!
1312857805225955330 2020-10-05 04:51:07 +0800 <BainzyC> ''Grandmaster''??? Are they a secret society? Who is funding them?
1312857216341467139 2020-10-05 04:48:46 +0800 <BainzyC> I don't think that they considered that by locking people up would cause them to shag each other silly, come #Brexit there will be loads more Brits 🤣
1312856213797900290 2020-10-05 04:44:47 +0800 <BainzyC> Did your nose grow when you wrote that Kamala? Trump has signed an EO saying he will protect pre-existing conditions. Trump has a proven record of keeping his word, unlike Democrats who just don't!
1312855049656250368 2020-10-05 04:40:10 +0800 <BainzyC>  https://t.co/ebeiWOuIu7
1312853353626558467 2020-10-05 04:33:25 +0800 <BainzyC> Crazy Joe, your VP choice wants to end America, so do her crazy gang, they don't want to be Americans, you should be a Republican, you'll fit in better there if you can stop lying and remember your own name.
1312851823884210179 2020-10-05 04:27:21 +0800 <BainzyC> Yes, we are, the tide is changing, #Brexit looms and your EU funding will cease.

1312818940402425856 2020-10-05 02:16:41 +0800 <BainzyC> He nor his wife deserve any media time, ginger-minger is just an Xpat now.
1312818392986984449 2020-10-05 02:14:30 +0800 <BainzyC> All Hail Boris! 🤣
1312818081601851392 2020-10-05 02:13:16 +0800 <BainzyC> Maybe he was cheating the naughty guy?
1312817507166834688 2020-10-05 02:10:59 +0800 <BainzyC> Another little puppet  https://t.co/ViQvkjd6xc
1312816808148303873 2020-10-05 02:08:12 +0800 <BainzyC> They are a sick Godless bunch!
1312816430421811200 2020-10-05 02:06:42 +0800 <BainzyC> They are still in denial, they will wonder what the hell happened on 1st Jan 2021 when they no longer mean anything to us. 🤣
1312812921211301888 2020-10-05 01:52:45 +0800 <BainzyC> Worrisome he is defeating the virus? The guy could cure cancer and CNN would claim he has lost the jobs of medical researchers and doctors 🤣
1312811616665305090 2020-10-05 01:47:34 +0800 <BainzyC> Have all the arsonists caught been charged?
1312808801309949952 2020-10-05 01:36:23 +0800 <BainzyC> The left's claims are always a great source for humour :)
1312808389727133696 2020-10-05 01:34:45 +0800 <BainzyC> We are all dying! Not all from The China Virus. Trump is too fit for it to bring him down...
1312806662844055553 2020-10-05 01:27:53 +0800 <BainzyC> Legal farmworkers are fantastic!
1312805981747777536 2020-10-05 01:25:11 +0800 <BainzyC> Wheeeyyyyy, haaayyyyyy.... I have A follower 😊
1312805458068090883 2020-10-05 01:23:06 +0800 <BainzyC> You are very, very lucky to have a father like him, if all were the same just imagine what a wonderful world this would be...I won't make a song and dance about it though 😉
1312804863487680518 2020-10-05 01:20:44 +0800 <BainzyC> He is not Human, he is Super Human!
1312804316487577600 2020-10-05 01:18:34 +0800 <BainzyC> I've had my account blocked for months because I changed my laptop, I would like some Conservative and commonsense people to follow me if there are any left out there, any old followers, I'M Back!
