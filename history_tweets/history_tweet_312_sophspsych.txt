1305003313595850752 2020-09-13 12:40:10 +0800 <sophspsych> chocolate is just such a mood booster
1304994323382050816 2020-09-13 12:04:26 +0800 <sophspsych> my life is a cycle of drafting dms
1304993786855120896 2020-09-13 12:02:19 +0800 <sophspsych> @nccmiller ‚Äúhaha so weird how we have so much privilege that we literally will risk other people‚Äôs lives for what we think is a mild inconvenience‚Äù
1304992786412900352 2020-09-13 11:58:20 +0800 <sophspsych> is it appropriate to dm a scientist on twitter whose paper you read and you want to ask about/say is awesome?   i don‚Äôt want to seem like a nuisance, but there is a scientist i very much want to dm lol!
1304916244341166086 2020-09-13 06:54:11 +0800 <sophspsych> @ramencult @rookarmeremanko i love learning this stuff!
1304914741131988994 2020-09-13 06:48:13 +0800 <sophspsych> i really, really miss him. there‚Äôs a picture on my phone- i was 15, and he looks frail next to me. but he was so, so strong. and he‚Äôs standing next to me, his arm around me.  and i know he would be proud of me right now. i know he would.
1304914431655079936 2020-09-13 06:46:59 +0800 <sophspsych> i don‚Äôt have claim to this part of my identity or life and i feel like i have access to him through material things like the necklace my Aie gave me or the papers my Oja authored on or the art from their garage that my Aie made for years
1304914112292499459 2020-09-13 06:45:43 +0800 <sophspsych> sometimes it hurts so badly to have lost someone who was so strongly a part of making sure he taught me about indian culture, about words in Hindi, and how he and my Aie loved us so so much all the time and gave us so much life
1304913626634092544 2020-09-13 06:43:47 +0800 <sophspsych> 3/? and meeting my uncle. My Oja gave me things that i wouldn‚Äôt have found without him. he gave me so much love and encouragement and let me help him, and every single time we travelled to their house for thanksgiving is a time that i cannot forget
1304913320911273985 2020-09-13 06:42:34 +0800 <sophspsych> 2/? i think about him a lot. he squeezed my hand the night before he passed away. he heard me. he said my name. he came to america after his two older children had both traveled to america, my uncle becoming a social worker and getting his PhD, and my aunt moving to the UK
1304912803157901316 2020-09-13 06:40:31 +0800 <sophspsych> 1/? i miss my oja so so much. he was my main link to indian culture, he was the scientist, he was so kind and smart. he always encouraged me and always talked to me on the phone. we planted a tree for him in the front yard, but i did something wrong, and it didn‚Äôt live very long
1304911129370652674 2020-09-13 06:33:51 +0800 <sophspsych> someone tell me not to buy this immediately  https://t.co/Czeq8kppNX
