1344058357364248585 2020-12-30 07:10:58 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonOverstreet I have seen and heard people VOTE for Republicans because they believe they are pro life. No other reason.

1343737421922504709 2020-12-29 09:55:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Why are you only concerned with the debt, you helped rack up, when a Democrat is elected for president? If it was trump you'd still be adding to the debt without a care to the world.
1343710731208978439 2020-12-29 08:09:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @andylassner Was looking into this. Haven't pulled the cord yet.

1343549880799801351 2020-12-28 21:30:28 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @BMeiselas Trump's legacy is being the worst US president ever.
1343549527618420739 2020-12-28 21:29:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @andylassner Andy, it didn't matter how long someone lived in LA. They always lost their ability to drive when it rained. Sprinkle or downpour.

1343378359330463749 2020-12-28 10:08:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Just what would $600 do for you Kevin? Pay mortgage, utilities, food?  What?   Republicans are fuckers.

1343361861903904768 2020-12-28 09:03:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @donwinslow @marcorubio What they don't get. Only trump can get away with this because we know he is the lowest of lows.  We expect more from everyone else.

1343360556284203008 2020-12-28 08:58:09 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Just had a thought. If trump cult won't reelect Republicans in office today. Are they using there own deplorables to run?  We must not let them win.....ever!

1343350486334898177 2020-12-28 08:18:08 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> After 4 years of suffering with trump. He better be made to pay for all Americans suffering.  The last year being the worst.   Justice must be served.  He must pay with living out his life behind bars.  No one is above the law.

1342928302638571524 2020-12-27 04:20:32 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepMattGaetz Why do you not care if people get sick, get further or new pre-existing conditions or die after getting Covid-19?  Why do you hate Americans?
1342888485850636292 2020-12-27 01:42:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @donwinslow @FLOTUS @realDonaldTrump Serious question, how many women wear a blouse like this without a bra?  How many?  I'll go first, I don't know of one.

1341869519522983936 2020-12-24 06:13:18 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @FudgeTrunp I'm sorry.  I hope he finds the support he should have amongst friends.

1341818211021545474 2020-12-24 02:49:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> We need someone to pretend to play trumps fraud game for the next few weeks until 1/20/21 to keep him in check.   Volunteers! Con: people will hate you.  Pro: you'll know you did good.

1341703508341514242 2020-12-23 19:13:38 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @trom771 Dumb question. How does trump have any say about this? It's a Twitter White House account. How does he just delete millions of followers?

A miracle would have been minimal deaths (100 or less) sickness (1000 or less)due to Covid-19. It could have been done IF you'd had an ounce of smarts. Worse/Stupidest president in history.
1341504858919190528 2020-12-23 06:04:16 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Just because you type it in all caps doesn't make it factual.

1341469385387634690 2020-12-23 03:43:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepMattGaetz Why do you hate people?  A real person with intelligence would be telling people to social distance, wear a mask and stay safe to enjoy next year with family and friends.   You are a hateful despicable person.
1341387296122257414 2020-12-22 22:17:07 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz You are a traitor to the constitution.  You need to be held accountable!

1340308938919698433 2020-12-19 22:52:07 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> How long do think it will take the trump cult to realize they've been duped? Weeks, months or years?

1340279517831675905 2020-12-19 20:55:12 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> The Republican senate elections need to be double checked.    There is something so fishy it smells.

Even now they won't even let Pfizer send the millions of vaccines because they won't tell them where.  This administration and the complicit GOP are fuckers!
1340117490945433600 2020-12-19 10:11:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @H_MitchellPhoto They are all the worse of the worst fuckers.
1340111253516283906 2020-12-19 09:46:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepMattGaetz We did. Joe Biden won because that's who we all voted for.  You should really get on board Matty, President Joe Biden!

1340088192255582210 2020-12-19 08:14:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GeoffRBennett Now he's obstructing the vaccine from delivery.  Such a sweet caring person, he is not.
1340064167236145159 2020-12-19 06:39:29 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump I absolutely hate you all.  The number of people that died and continue to die is unacceptable.  So please shut the fuck up!

1340054523587534848 2020-12-19 06:01:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @AmSrAlliance @GovRonDeSantis Impressive would be if we lead number one with no Covid-19 sicknesses or deaths.   If we were more like New Zealand.  Even Taiwan with the same number of people is doing better than Florida.

1339944936360316929 2020-12-18 22:45:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @senatemajldr Kentucky demand an election Senate recount.  We know you aren't stupid enough to have voted this horrid man in again.

1339908569148387330 2020-12-18 20:21:11 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> There is election fraud.    It's trump defrauding his cult asking for millions of free money for himself.  That's the fraud!

1339750283275071490 2020-12-18 09:52:13 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio @Twitter Fact. We have a vaccine from a company that has absolutely nothing to do with the trump administration.  Why did trump turn down getting more from Pfizer when offered? Where's that vaccine Marco from the fast track companies they went to? Where? Fucker!

1339664174616592386 2020-12-18 04:10:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Let me say it for you President Elect Joe Biden will be sworn in January 20th.   If she was concerned about fair elections she would congratulate Joe Biden.
1339662737706762240 2020-12-18 04:04:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> #FireLiddleMarco is a hypocrite.  Let's retire him in 2020. Let's show these hypocrites we mean business.

1339649256156741634 2020-12-18 03:10:46 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio It's worse backing traitors, rapist, white supremacists, nra and russia.    You are a fucker #FireLiddleMarco

1339616836359512072 2020-12-18 01:01:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz We all want to go to restaurants again Matty. We just don't want to be responsible for another person getting sick or dying. You'd think a Congressman would want that as well.  Question is, why aren't you responsible?
1339583734647963649 2020-12-17 22:50:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @TheRealDevonV @SteveSchmidtSES @marcorubio The only good thing trump did was bring to light all the hypocrites in government, federally and locally.  All the politicians that truly do not give a damn about this country.  It was proven over and over again in the last 4 years.
1339556814543831042 2020-12-17 21:03:27 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Great TV watching his ass being g dragged from the White House.  Can't wait.

1339387000835719170 2020-12-17 09:48:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> And Desantis is helping him.
1339386877632258048 2020-12-17 09:48:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio You are a bunch of fuckers.  What's the issue?  Never heard you bad mouth all the shit that came out of trumps little mouth.   Rubio is one of the biggest hypocrites.
1339374434935836673 2020-12-17 08:58:44 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I hope any nd all state investigates all the trumps including Jared Kushner.    They will continue to hurt this country until they are all behind bars.

1339371734739333121 2020-12-17 08:48:00 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepMattGaetz Matty, this state depends upon tourist dollars.  As long as we have Covid-19 in this state we will not have tourist.  We need Europeans and South Americans not someone coming from Mississippi.  Why aren't you fighting for zero cases?
1339352749717282820 2020-12-17 07:32:34 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @SSullivan38 Yes.

1339237490088144901 2020-12-16 23:54:34 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Bill_Maxwell_ @SpeakerPelosi Yes.  But she won't because she'll think if it was the reverse the GOP would play fairly.  They don't and never will and they WOULD kick the 126 out. Nancy should throw their asses out.  This is our country that they are against.
1339218859967074305 2020-12-16 22:40:32 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DWUhlfelderLaw Thank you for doing this.
1339218622724575234 2020-12-16 22:39:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> And it will happen sooner rather than later.

1339218184918929411 2020-12-16 22:37:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DoreenDeFlavis @GovRonDeSantis Without a complete lockdown we will never recover.  And the longer this takes to do the more resistant people will be.  Without zero Covid-19 we are losing millions of tourism dollars and taxes which this states has to have to survive.
1339207068482408449 2020-12-16 21:53:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DJWilderness It would tell the rest of us that it's the party of white supremacists rather than hiding behind the Republican party.

1339176115047424003 2020-12-16 19:50:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Why didn't we win all the Senate seats if we rigged the election.  We hate McConnell, Collins, Graham, Gaetz, Jordan, Cornyn etc as much as we all hate you.   It just doesn't make sense.  But then you never do.
1339175489328586753 2020-12-16 19:48:11 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump @MailOnline 81,000,000 that voted for President Elect Joe Biden is still more than the deplorable 75,000 000.
1339175017104412674 2020-12-16 19:46:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Only 92% of those asked.  Sad!  Who in your administration felt it wasn't rigged Donald.
1339174339715817473 2020-12-16 19:43:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @TerrySchoenfel1 How about the companies that are producing the vaccines?  And the countries that have listened to scientists have seen very little deaths unlike this state.

1339173103843348482 2020-12-16 19:38:43 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @CathyNotToday @RonGOPVet4Biden Florida will only recover when Desantis is out of office. This state needs tourism and no one with the money we need will come here with Covid-19. He is destroying this states future economy.
1339171815877472258 2020-12-16 19:33:36 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @MysterySolvent His hatred of people and democracy makes him an ugly person.
1339170830023069697 2020-12-16 19:29:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @educated_educ8r I did until I read he is as awful as the rest of the trump's.  Makes sense after watching how his mom and dad treat people.  So no I don't feel sorry for him.

1339166294441156609 2020-12-16 19:11:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @senatemajldr finally got his orders from Putin.

1338993532300877829 2020-12-16 07:45:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GovRonDeSantis You didn't protect the people that were unemployed.
1338993196366499840 2020-12-16 07:43:49 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DoreenDeFlavis @GovRonDeSantis He hasn't followed science and still isn't.  2 vaccine shots needed. Desantis said take 1.  That isn't following science.

1338950330353147906 2020-12-16 04:53:29 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> The 2020 election tells us We must ALL VOTE and NEVER take anything for granted, locally or federally. We must must work harder locally to eliminate those with proven track records for bad judgment. We must ALL VOTE for our presidents.
1338948721686482945 2020-12-16 04:47:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonOverstreet Between that and a 21 year marriage. 2020 worst year ever!

1338914977185476609 2020-12-16 02:33:01 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @AP_Politics @senatemajldr  We noticed.  Putin finally gave you all the okay to acknowledge what we've known for weeks. January 20th Joe Biden will be our new wonderful.  Long over due since you couldn't do your damn job.
1338914405837320193 2020-12-16 02:30:44 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @KittyBeeJr I think I'd buy them more alcohol.  Poor things.
1338913325221076995 2020-12-16 02:26:27 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepMattGaetz Matty you're a traitor to the American people who voted.

1338766903796436994 2020-12-15 16:44:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Darkest years of America's history. November 2016 through January 2021.  May we never ever get her again.  We must fight on to save and keep our country from dictatorship.

1338542919301607426 2020-12-15 01:54:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Maybe because she won by more than 3 Million votes. If she had won we wouldn't be mourning over 300,000 Americans. Over 500 children wouldn't have been separated from family and lost forever from families.

Legalization of cannabis frees millions of people that shouldn't be behind bars.  But that goes against your racist plans.
1335570461267255296 2020-12-06 21:03:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Joe Biden won by huge margins. So how did every horrid GOP senator win reelection?  How?    As an American I want this investigated.

Again if scott had looked after Floridians rather than refused a Democrat president we'd all be better off.

1333128703614791680 2020-11-30 03:20:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Hey Marco aren't you a senator? Do it yourself.  I'm sure you have Pelosi and Schumer's numbers.  But as usual you'd rather place blame.
1333101304252657665 2020-11-30 01:31:33 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @rxjef77 Every day will get better.

1333058861897539584 2020-11-29 22:42:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mjblanco322 Feel better. Hoping for a speedy recovery.
1333053986337943552 2020-11-29 22:23:31 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JohnMappin @zev_dr @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Florida got millions of doses as Desantis is buddies with trump.  Think, if it worked Desantis would be a hero. Hydro isn't the miracle they wanted you to believe.
1333053061166718976 2020-11-29 22:19:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @KazePlays_JC They destroy, then a Democrat takes over and gets blamed for what the GOP party did. Most things that effect us don't take place while a Republican is still in office.  The fallout is usually during a Democratic run.  My opinion.
1333003106758647811 2020-11-29 19:01:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @UROCKlive1 You can't. It's impossible to refute alternative facts. Plus the more they say the same thing over and over they believe it.

1332980571736313864 2020-11-29 17:31:48 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DenDonally Wishing you a speedy recovery.
1332971395207278593 2020-11-29 16:55:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @BillKristol We need to stop thinking the GOP have a conscience. The work starts with eliminating each and everyone of the trump cult, local and federal elections.  It will take a few years but it must be done.  Today's GOP are traitors.

1332520505363083268 2020-11-28 11:03:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Biden beat your ass by winning by a super landslide.

1332482788566704128 2020-11-28 08:33:47 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Yup. Guess no one likes #DiaperDon

1332402457645903874 2020-11-28 03:14:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @FoxNews Trump must prove votes in 2016 were legal!
1332389257584009216 2020-11-28 02:22:08 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Laughing.  Is this the same evidence produced in all your other failed cases?

1332103465074630668 2020-11-27 07:26:30 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PeteCornwell1 @DaxGigandet I've only cooked a Turkey twice, both times it was cooked to perfection. In the past I had to have cranberry sauce to help with the dryness.    The moral of your story is cook poultry with their butts in the air. Have to try.  😂
1332091387282591752 2020-11-27 06:38:30 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DaxGigandet If the Turkey is dry, yes.
1332091164594479104 2020-11-27 06:37:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Yes. And we need to go back to the days a candidate for president must be intelligent.
1332087084719411200 2020-11-27 06:21:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> They can't. It's all about the money. No peeps no money.

1332046948346580993 2020-11-27 03:41:55 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Joe Biden your new president won with over 6 million votes and the electoral votes of 306.    Game over January 20th.

I wasn't put on earth for you to kill off from someone senseless experiment.    Social distancing and masks.  Words and actions matter. Resign this state needs someone that gives a damn.

1331700966018719744 2020-11-26 04:47:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GovRonDeSantis  Why are you so intent on killing Floridians?   Are you making money off each death?    Why isn't the governor's mansion open for tours if it is so safe?

1331579878769123328 2020-11-25 20:45:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump @EPA The only way daddy gets credit is because people stayed home due to Covid-19. Lacking any trump plans. Thus not traveling. Plus we've lost 255,000 lives.   Your children's school kicked you out because you couldn't even teach your kids to follow rules.

1331554978012475394 2020-11-25 19:07:00 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I agree.  It needs to be investigated.
1331554546158620672 2020-11-25 19:05:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LisaHagan7 He was elected.
1331554022306754563 2020-11-25 19:03:12 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @QtrThnUR @DaxGigandet Yes he does. 2024 will be another hard win. Biden has so much to do, but will it be enough for Americans to VOTE democratic again and keep this country moving forward. I hope so.
1331552622453661702 2020-11-25 18:57:38 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GwenGraham @marcorubio Hope to hear you are running either against Desantis or Rubio.   Whichever it needs to start now. Democrats need to start talking with Republicans to let them get to know you and change their VOTE to you.

1331419020315283456 2020-11-25 10:06:45 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ResistMona I would have but I didn't see anything.  I'm very sorry. I know how you feel as my cat died election evening. It is very painful losing our fur babies.
1331418399348584451 2020-11-25 10:04:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I don't care what Paul Ryan thinks.  He may have quit but he is just as awful as the rest.
1331412562613837826 2020-11-25 09:41:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @l78lancer Congratulations

1331393368572760065 2020-11-25 08:24:49 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @OmarComing3 Fingers crossed it's a mild form.
1331393047553335296 2020-11-25 08:23:33 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Domini_Templari @realDonaldTrump @Lawrence @TheLastWord Where are all the trump supporters?  This picture says it all.  Loser!
1331392262585126913 2020-11-25 08:20:26 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ECMcLaughlin Florida needs someone really special. Someone super relatable to everyone, seniors, kids, every race.  And they need to start now.    We also need a better message regarding socialism.
1331391397455409154 2020-11-25 08:16:59 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ECMcLaughlin 2022. No one yet that I know of.
1331391150519889920 2020-11-25 08:16:00 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Me too
1331389840500400128 2020-11-25 08:10:48 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Georgia we are all on pins and needles. Without you voting in both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff this country will get no where with #MoscowMitch.  Please vote for @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff. Please save us.
1331388725109125120 2020-11-25 08:06:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Thanks to you, America is now last.  You screwed our farmers.  You screwed Americans by pretending Covid-19 was a hoax.  Fuck you, your family and administration.
1331379743640461317 2020-11-25 07:30:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PalmerReport @MSNBC this has got to stop.  Between now and forever trump needs to be an extremely minor story.
1331373219417296896 2020-11-25 07:04:45 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IngrahamAngle No Hillary Clinton voters considered trump the legitimate 2016 winner.   Your not when you have Russia working to get you elected.
1331369101458026510 2020-11-25 06:48:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PalmerReport @PRyan is a piece of shit!
1331368923355377664 2020-11-25 06:47:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> That would make my day!

1331358867570225152 2020-11-25 06:07:44 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> 100% true. But worse, it can be someone with brain.

1331356592747520002 2020-11-25 05:58:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @senatemajldr Stop screwing Americans.  Instead of not holding companies accountable if employees get Covid-19, you are doing everything to protect them and not Americans.  I demand a recount in Kentucky.
1331355716565798913 2020-11-25 05:55:12 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I want to live in a country where Colin Kaepernick is seen as a hero and Kyle Rittenhouse is seen as a terrorist.

1331354783656120329 2020-11-25 05:51:30 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonOverstreet Hoping someone really good.
1331354669533327367 2020-11-25 05:51:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @MaryLTrump Without holding them accountable tells everyone you will never be held accountable for disgusting crimes if you have money or know someone with money or power.
1331354256587239426 2020-11-25 05:49:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonMillerinDC Yup!  Fact. Money was Iran's not Americans money.  It was part of the deal to not go nuclear.  Facts matter.  Now more important. Be an adult and pay your damn child support payments.
1331337587215249414 2020-11-25 04:43:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> After trump, the GOP will pretend they never backed him. We can't le that happen    They will pretend so they can try to control our government again.    The GOP must go.  No ifs, ands or buts.
1331336713495584769 2020-11-25 04:39:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump This means nothing to most Americans.  A Covid-19 relief package is needed but your senators are on vacation.  While people starve, get sick and die they are on vacation.  On fucking vacation.   So nice Biden will be our president.
1331333483109740549 2020-11-25 04:26:52 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LindseyGrahamSC Enough of this socialist crap. Democrats will do more for Americans for the next 4 years than you bozos did.
1331332678822584320 2020-11-25 04:23:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JoeBiden This warms my heart.
1331331157808517123 2020-11-25 04:17:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Democrats need better messaging. We are not the party of socialist.  We are the party of the people!  People associate Socialism with communism.   Education is really needed.
1331330657549750273 2020-11-25 04:15:38 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio No Marco they just need more education to understand the GOP lies. Democrats aren't the socialist party. But the GOP has no problem giving our money to the rich and farmers because of trump's horrible deals.
1331329977393049602 2020-11-25 04:12:56 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @politvidchannel Trump will leave as President Biden is sworn in to try (and he'll fail) to take away from our new Presidents day.
1331327801052569601 2020-11-25 04:04:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Glad you recognize America's decline that you were and still are a part of.    Thank God for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
1331292519859171332 2020-11-25 01:44:05 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LindseyGrahamSC You are a traitor to our elections.  Resign!
1331290698226823169 2020-11-25 01:36:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonOverstreet 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1331283353916624899 2020-11-25 01:07:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump Everyone is excited Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will now be in charge instead of diaper don and nepotism barbie.
1331282756345753601 2020-11-25 01:05:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepMattGaetz A government that wants to restrict women is not our government.   January 20th President Biden and Kamala Harris are in charge.
1331282250420383751 2020-11-25 01:03:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I stand by and with @GovWhitmer
1331280897799303172 2020-11-25 00:57:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Bill_Maxwell_ This is an excellent idea

1331258106458857477 2020-11-24 23:27:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Hilarious marco. It took many years for our so called China dependance.  Not one Gov. Official tried to stop as we sent more and more jobs to China.   At least be fucking honest.  Oh right, forgot that isn't a strong suit of yours.
1331256794363080705 2020-11-24 23:22:07 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> America needs you Georgia. VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.

1331236293255327744 2020-11-24 22:00:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RandyRRQuaid 😂 like trump you're not good with numbers.  Over 79 million voted for the new president. His name is Joe Biden.  In fact he won by a super landslide, the electoral and popular VOTE. Can't say that about.....
1331235046582317073 2020-11-24 21:55:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GGCalwel @cljmo Trump needs a new home away from America.
1331234345282129935 2020-11-24 21:52:55 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> This needs more exposure.
1331233681466396672 2020-11-24 21:50:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @thesaucyliberal That is just wrong! Of course there is a Santa.
1331232312214876160 2020-11-24 21:44:50 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonOverstreet Me too.  Wondering if Biden isn't pulling the best from the Senate because we need control of the Senate.
1331231651008028673 2020-11-24 21:42:13 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump Thank God a real teacher will help with education and not a worthless billionaire that doesn't have a fucking clue.

1331227735344226305 2020-11-24 21:26:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Trump supporters should ban fox news for calling electios.  You should show the Republican party you mean business in Georgia and write in Donald J Trump as your VOTE.   Show them you mean business!
1331225470394912769 2020-11-24 21:17:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Yes

1331023255826796545 2020-11-24 07:54:08 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @KamalaHarris Yes. What's even better is you and Joe will actually listen and hear what these people have to say.  Thank you.

1331020776053596162 2020-11-24 07:44:16 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GSAEmily finally fucking did her job. A lot of bullshit in her letter. But now the transition can begin.

1330975194039586821 2020-11-24 04:43:09 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @KYGOP  Can you explain why you all voted for #MoscowMitch?   He's done absolutely nothing for Kentucky, you're practically last in everything compared to the other 49 states.
1330973835034832897 2020-11-24 04:37:45 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RandPaul @KYGOP 😂😂😂😂 Rand Paul gets yelled at and he thinks he's been attacked. 😂😂😂😂

1330951519424884744 2020-11-24 03:09:04 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Scattered211 I made a Turkey, sweet potatoes, green beans, mashed potatoes last year for just my husband (who I wasn't sure would be there) and myself. First time Turkey and it was the best so ate until it was gone. Normally not a fan. One year my sister made tacos.
1330949270208274432 2020-11-24 03:00:08 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @AliMayorkas Congratulations!
1330947234742071296 2020-11-24 02:52:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I agree. Republicans should not back them at all.
1330915223864307713 2020-11-24 00:44:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Herd immunity is an American death wish from your family to ours.   So as nice as possible I wish you all a huge fuck you!

1330847909726785537 2020-11-23 20:17:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @tedcruz  You are an incompetent worthless human being.   People are dying in your state! Oh let's not forget you telling everyone to get together and celebrate Thanksgiving.  No money because GOP is too busy hiring unqualified judges, but sure celebrate.
1330845735429017603 2020-11-23 20:08:43 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @e_whittler And the silence of the Republicans in office is once again deafening and putting our country at risk.
1330844895112728577 2020-11-23 20:05:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @KathleenKatfox Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won by a super landslide.

1330567727141056514 2020-11-23 01:44:01 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Every president looks more mature when they leave office.  Trump just looks old!

1330538422570782720 2020-11-22 23:47:34 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PamKeithFL Personally all these senators who won, need to be double checked.  They ALL won reelection. They are the most hated and they ALL won.  Very fishy!

1330520924538417160 2020-11-22 22:38:02 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PalmerReport Jeb and George lost any respect I had for them by staying silent during this election.   This wasn't about red vs Blue, this fight was about America or trump.

1330508486116052993 2020-11-22 21:48:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP @realDonaldTrump There is no Republican party.  It is the party of whats in it for me and only me. It is a cult.
1330507658017779712 2020-11-22 21:45:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @MysterySolvent For someone in the fashion industry as a model you'd think she'd have better taste.  But she doesn't.  Which begs the question, was she ever really a model?
1330506835128950785 2020-11-22 21:42:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JennaEllisEsq Who's scared?   Fact, Joe Biden has the largest and best base in history and won with more than six million votes.  SIX MILLION!

1330159599996047361 2020-11-21 22:42:16 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Because we have bad laws regarding roofing companies all homeowners are paying double for our insurance.   How about change the laws!

Instead because people have money and white they walk away to be more destructive on another day.   Enough. No one is above the law.

1330144224679964676 2020-11-21 21:41:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Don't you find it odd that all the horrible hated Republican senators were reelectef? Yet Democrats voted more in this election than any other election.  It's almost like they knew they didn't have to worry about it, except begging #LeningradLindsey.
1330142480155742208 2020-11-21 21:34:14 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> This does need to be a bigger story.

They are evil white supremacists telling us they are Republicans.  They are power hungry and only out for themselves.   This party must be destroyed before we can be the America we always thought we were  .
1330141158484357120 2020-11-21 21:28:59 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Yes.  Trump is who the GOP always was.   They made that known when Obama was president and it was ignored.  Trump brought it out front and center for the world to see our evil.
1330138673334145032 2020-11-21 21:19:07 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ananavarro You'd think that.  But they only care about themselves and don't know how to care about others.

1329747362676428802 2020-11-20 19:24:11 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @punk2009ct @mmpadellan 80 million MORE people voted for Biden.  That is his base.  Biden's base has 80 million more Americans backing him.

First and foremost, the media has to stop giving these vipers free coverage.    This country has a long way to go which is obvious since states just reelected the most awful hateful senators.    Messaging needs to be better.
1329744740779253763 2020-11-20 19:13:46 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Very happy to hear that Susan is recovering.  I'm sorry you both had to go through this.   Stay safe and healthy.

1329580514781655048 2020-11-20 08:21:11 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Question has always been. Why does everyone let trump get away with what he has the last 4 years?  I think they used him to achieve what they wanted.  They know time is running out and they aren't finished yet. Thus ignoring trump.
1329576794832465923 2020-11-20 08:06:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Jim_Jordan American votes matter.  Joe Biden has the largest and best base in history.

Call for a recount on #MoscowMitch.  Guessing he cheated and didn't win.    He doesn't have your best interest at heart nor the rest of the US.

1329505051195355136 2020-11-20 03:21:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @WindsorMann True. I never thought I'd ever see the day a group of people in the US would back someone that does not have the US's best interest at heart.
1329503395883986947 2020-11-20 03:14:45 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @acnewsitics Me too. At least until last year, I made the best tasting Turkey I've ever had.  Making another this year. Fingers crossed it states as good.
1329502629370716167 2020-11-20 03:11:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LindseyGrahamSC #LeningradLindsey you need to resign.  You tried to dismiss American votes.  That is something that would happen in Venezuela.

He took away Floridians voice when we voted for felons to vote. Now this.   He celebrates and does nothing to keep Floridians safe from Covid-19.    Desantis needs to resign.

1329373459680534530 2020-11-19 18:38:26 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> The real story is hated senators who won reelection.  Did they really?  Trump is keeping that story away from the media with his bullshit.  Did Lindsey talk to someone in South Carolina to win?  How did #MoscowMitch win. He is the most hated man in the US?

1329179892831891459 2020-11-19 05:49:16 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Jim_Jordan GOP want you to believe there was something wrong with the election either absolutely no evidence.  Every lawsuit has FAILED just like trump FAILED.

1329155201610211328 2020-11-19 04:11:09 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @perlmutations It needs to be better than the one we had in place that obviously didn't work with a bunch of power hungry cowards.
1329147756229894148 2020-11-19 03:41:34 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @senatemajldr @ChuckGrassley How did you win?  Kentucky needs to look into the senator votes.  Too many Democrats voted this year.  Everyone hates you #MoscowMitch.
1329146692420112385 2020-11-19 03:37:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @CPriceDenver @BillPascrell Guess you missed the part where the Republicans after numerous investigations on Hillary found nothing.   Know this is hard to believe, but the current GOP hate strong intelligent women and hated the the thought of having one as president.
1329129909852246021 2020-11-19 02:30:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Shhhhh. Math obviously is your strong suit.

1329127099748278272 2020-11-19 02:19:29 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @HKrassenstein Wish you wouldn't leave.  We still have tons of work to do, especially in Florida.    Wish you, your husband and brother the very best. Thank you for all you did.
1329106803884494850 2020-11-19 00:58:50 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JennaEllisEsq @realDonaldTrump It didn't work, did it?  Trump loses again because Americans voted and were counted as they should be.

1329063811488362496 2020-11-18 22:08:00 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Those elections results need to be checked.
1329054882616184835 2020-11-18 21:32:31 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GovRonDeSantis needs to resign   Floridians know you want your own way in elections. We voted so felons could VOTE and you took that away.   So who would be surprised at this.
1329054127960305665 2020-11-18 21:29:31 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump Daddy lost. Now tell him to put country over his fucking childish ego. Tell him he won't be reelected in 2024 if he doesn't concede now. Tell him whatever you need to but do it.   Country over trump!
1329052305849769984 2020-11-18 21:22:16 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump Why couldn't you and Jared pass a FBI background check to get clearance?  What have you both done in your entitled lives?   The average American can get clearance.
1329050380781690880 2020-11-18 21:14:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Kentucky, South Carolina, Iowa, Maine, Texas Ohio and California.  All these senators won reelection.  How? Every single one of them are hated more than they are liked.  This year more Democrats voted so HOW did these senators win reelection? Very suspicious!
1329036720801804289 2020-11-18 20:20:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump You are so clueless! People don't give a shit about the stock market. They do care about not getting the trump virus, paying rent or mortgage and feeding their families.

1328781188287369218 2020-11-18 03:24:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonOverstreet Biden will leave it all up to the justice department.  Frankly Biden and Harris need to concentrate on this country. Let's let the justice department do their job, whoever takes Barr's job.

1328738594501038087 2020-11-18 00:35:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio @LindseyGrahamSC is the only one trying out the fraud card.  He's been caught and needs to pay the price of resigning or put behind bars.    Americans demand to have their votes counted.

1328722900061462535 2020-11-17 23:33:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz So Floridians paid you to write a book?  It has to be the case because you've done no real work.

1328722169627635716 2020-11-17 23:30:26 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio You won't condemn trump who gives farmers money because he screwed up. That's socialism. Or trying to extort Ukraine to get dirt on Biden.  Your poor children when they grow up and realize what a weak coward of a man you really are.
1328721614809296897 2020-11-17 23:28:14 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @FoxNews This is what you run with rather than a sitting senator tried to get valid legal votes thrown out.  And for the record the whole Democratic party would love to do this. But reality is no one has money to pick up and move.

1328456896462860289 2020-11-17 05:56:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DamonLinker I get how people may think this is unfair because they paid off their loans. But this will help the economy and it's better than giving the rich money.  It isn't like Biden can just give every American 25k to be fair.
1328453124101713922 2020-11-17 05:41:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @jeverage713 If I can ask.  What was it that changed her mind?
1328448396189904897 2020-11-17 05:22:33 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I think both trump and pence should be handcuffed and put away, right now.  Neither has done a damn thing while the trump virus soars and people die.  They are murderers and should be in prison.
1328447675457548289 2020-11-17 05:19:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RCampbellmc58 I'm sorry you lost your brother David.  May your memories help you with the loss.

1328445015253807104 2020-11-17 05:09:07 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Jim_Jordan People don't have money for Thanksgiving or Christmas. All because the Senate and trump would rather ignore the trump virus. 15 to 0. It will go away. It's okay if grandparents die. Etc etc.
1328444319649370114 2020-11-17 05:06:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump Lie.  People are struggling more than ever before. People depleted their savings because this administration and Senate could care less.  January 20 2021 Joe Biden will be your president.
1328443677027553281 2020-11-17 05:03:48 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> And jimbo will have no problem with you dying when you get the trump virus.  And if you survive he'll vote against you having health care.
1328442645299998729 2020-11-17 04:59:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Better options? @GovRonDeSantis is using us as an experiment. People dying is not a better outcome.   Mandatory masks. Social distancing.  Doing yourselves rather than high fiving people in crowds. The immaturity is fucking unbelievable.
1328441535097171969 2020-11-17 04:55:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GovRonDeSantis   Do your job.  Stop using Floridians as a science experiment.  https://t.co/kHBJNIJCCj

1328438175899987970 2020-11-17 04:41:56 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @BillOReilly Hmm good reason. From day 1 trump has lied starting with the number of people at the inauguration. If he didn't lie which there was usually a video proving it he wouldn't have been as you call it attacked.  Facts matter bill.

1328379526108360704 2020-11-17 00:48:53 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Christians here's a fact for you.  No one cares that you are a Christian.    No one is trying to take Christianity away from you.  The only ones posting that someone is trying to take away your religion is Christians.  I'd ask yourselves why this is!
1328376196149678080 2020-11-17 00:35:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP @GOPChairwoman The implication that this party isn't out for only itself are slim to none.    You are all the most disgusting people that are using your power only to get rich.
1328371929338830848 2020-11-17 00:18:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @TimTebow Then where is your home.  Here's the thing, the only ones telling Christians people are against Christians are, wait for it, Christians.    No one cares what you believe in. What church you go to. No one. So don't put that on anyone else.

1328316822790221824 2020-11-16 20:39:44 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Joe Biden won with a super landslide.  How then did these awful evil Republican senators get reelected?  KY, TX, SC, OH and ME ballots need to be double checked.   I'd also check FL, matt Gaetz ballots.

1328308803838898177 2020-11-16 20:07:52 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PalmerReport This is how trump won in 2016. All the coverage he got.  He needs to stop being a topic unless they have the guts to call him out in real time on every lie.
1328306082343743489 2020-11-16 19:57:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Before the election Deutsche bank said they were going after trumps loans if he lost reelection.  Why have they been silent? Did Putin pay trumps debt?
1328300957998911488 2020-11-16 19:36:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio One day in the future your children will ask, how did you help when we had a pandemic.  Make sure you've saved enough not for college but their therapy when they realize you were a spineless coward and did nothing.
1328293365406969856 2020-11-16 19:06:31 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Funny I'm old enough to remember not hearing you say this about the women's million march.  Where there were a million women.    January 20th Joe Biden will be your president.

1328121075729883137 2020-11-16 07:41:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP The party that became the trump cult!  Are there any real Republican believers anymore?  I'm guessing, no!
1328120040298852352 2020-11-16 07:37:47 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Speaker71111280 Very sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what you are going through. I hope you'll seek a professional to see you through this time.
1328118928518897665 2020-11-16 07:33:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP Last night people were attacked, where is your fucking outrage?   Proud boys (such a dumb name) attacked peaceful protesters.  Can't wait for the day all you racist old white men are out of politics.
1328097769387593728 2020-11-16 06:09:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump The problem with you and family. You pretend to give a damn but nothing and I mean nothing gets done.   Others do give a damn and things do get done.  Who has to take classes to not defraud a children's charity!  Disgusting!

1327929499636346880 2020-11-15 19:00:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Donald it was free and fair. We voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They won by a super landslide!    2021 best year!

1327670784576401408 2020-11-15 01:52:36 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Don't you find it odd, that every corrupt hated republican senator won reelection, yet Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won by huge margins? Almost impossible in fact.
1327669401257127937 2020-11-15 01:47:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Jared Kushner and Mike Pence need to be put in prison for doing nothing and killing thousands due to Covid-19.

1327423495832281089 2020-11-14 09:29:58 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Wouldn't be surprised.

1327268477070143488 2020-11-13 23:13:59 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Georgia, America needs you more than ever.   VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.  We need both to win to control the Senate.  We need to win to move this country forward.    VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff   Sincerely,  America
1327267656924340224 2020-11-13 23:10:43 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I sure hope New York has enough on trump, his children and kushner to put them all away for many years to come.
1327267293546606594 2020-11-13 23:09:16 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Trump has always said say something 3 times and people believe you. Here's the truth.  #BidenWon #BidenWon #BidenWon  Now be a decent person for the 1st time in your life and concede.   #TrumpLost #TrumpLost #TrumpLost
1327266343842963456 2020-11-13 23:05:30 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Your poor daughters!

1327262796887846915 2020-11-13 22:51:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> It is what it is!
1327262468238942210 2020-11-13 22:50:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Georgia. VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.  We need to control the Senate and can't without these wins.  McConnell is voting in more judges instead of Covid-19 relief as  cases surge across the nation.  VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.
1327260673680748544 2020-11-13 22:42:58 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @eliehonig Pence pardons a traitor!  Sounds about right.
1327260020694798336 2020-11-13 22:40:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DonaldJTrumpJr Best day. #BidenWon and is our President elect.  Daddy lost bigly.  A great day to celebrate.
1327259554279731201 2020-11-13 22:38:31 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Who ever said Friday the 13th was an unlucky day?  Biden won by a landslide!  Best day!
1327258974857662464 2020-11-13 22:36:13 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @betsy_klein These guys are really scared of being fired by trump before the holidays I guess.  As of January 20th they are all fired anyway.
1327258266750029825 2020-11-13 22:33:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @TheRickWilson If people really wanted to put FB in it's place, people would sell their FB stock, money talks louder than everyone deleting their FB pages.
1327256825406828545 2020-11-13 22:27:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Marco is a hypocrite. How any man could back trump when he has a daughter is unbelievable. Especially when said man knows exactly the type of horrible man trump is.  Would you leave one of your daughters in a room alone with trump for a few hours?
1327254796265529346 2020-11-13 22:19:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @sstopshere So very sorry for your loss.

1327244122143543302 2020-11-13 21:37:12 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GovRonDeSantis should resign! #WorstFloridaGovernor and that is saying a lot.

1327231128697249792 2020-11-13 20:45:34 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> A vote for kelly is a vote for her to get richer and do nothing for GA and obstruct the Biden administration.  A VOTE for Reverend Warnock is a VOTE for Georgia's future and the US.   VOTE for @ReverendWarnock
1327229248571060226 2020-11-13 20:38:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @funder I object.  They  need to double check Kentucky, South Carolina and Maine.  Especially KY and SC.

1326997254981423105 2020-11-13 05:16:14 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz Rick what about the 3 fake candidates in Florida to take votes away from Democrat candidates?  How did you win? You're never around! I demand a recount because I believe @PhilEhr is the real winner.

1326989052885807124 2020-11-13 04:43:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Do you quote bible verses to your children when they ask or want to know hard questions? Where are babies from? Why do you back a rapist for president?

1326983483391156225 2020-11-13 04:21:31 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews If you had an employee that was given notice. Then they stopped doing the job, and they did everything they could to sabotage they person taking over from them.  What would you do?  That's you donny.
1326977440967692288 2020-11-13 03:57:30 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepSwalwell Question would be, is there anyone that he'd believe?

1326926992948801540 2020-11-13 00:37:02 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Ordinary1World Yes
1326906317353705477 2020-11-12 23:14:53 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> This country is extremely sad! We aren't calling states in favor of Joe Biden because they don't want to hurt trump's feelings!    Every single one of you are complicit in every death due to Covid-19 and the security of our country.
1326890385189253120 2020-11-12 22:11:34 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Georgia we need to stop all voter suppression. To do this, you must VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.   We must control the Senate.  Be America's super hero.   VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.
1326889823903371274 2020-11-12 22:09:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> To the state of Georgia we need your help. VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.   Taking control of the Senate gives this administration the tools to work for us the people.   Without it very little will get done because #MoscowMitch won't allow it.
1326888956487737344 2020-11-12 22:05:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @gtconway3d I agree. But sick and tired of letting him even do this.
1326887474208141313 2020-11-12 22:00:00 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Absolutely
1326887263742156800 2020-11-12 21:59:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LindseyGrahamSC @foxandfriends VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff.

1326877016570912769 2020-11-12 21:18:27 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> How? How is it Joe Biden wins by over 5 million votes. Yet we didn't pick up the Senate.   These senators are hated. Yet they won. They ignore their constituents, yet they won.    KY, SC, TX, OH and ME need to be double checked.
1326875495087153153 2020-11-12 21:12:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Think of this in dollars.  77 million is more than 72 million.  For a fake billionaire you aren't very good with numbers.    Maybe just maybe that's why you aren't a real billionaire.
1326872462240477186 2020-11-12 21:00:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Floridians really need to read this!  If it hasn't happened already in other states it will.

1326667583689527303 2020-11-12 07:26:14 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Democrats need to demand a check on this.  #MoscowMitch is hated.  But what I noticed was McConnell, Graham, collins and Gaetz all were over confident and then they won. Yet were rarely in their districts or states campaigning
1326666090961924096 2020-11-12 07:20:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @AmyMcGrathKY However it needs to be done double triple check how #MoscowMitch could win!

1326606821885358084 2020-11-12 03:24:48 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> To continue having Democrats in power we must take control of the Senate and keep the House.  Georgia we can only do this with your help.  Be America's super hero.  VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff
1326606289007423488 2020-11-12 03:22:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @DanSullivan_AK OMG what a surprise!  Not.  We all knew it was red you complete stupid moron.  Tell daddy to grow up and concede. The longer he goes the weaker he is.

1326516731746119680 2020-11-11 21:26:48 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Don't churches welcome everyone Marco?  But on another note this was 1995 and Castro is dead.

1326492446839222272 2020-11-11 19:50:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Thank you to all that served!

1326490064428404736 2020-11-11 19:40:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio It was more important to the Republicans to fast forward a SC justice than help Americans. In fact #MoscowMitch took vacations also rather than help Americans. Or pass an election security bill.
1326488280528019456 2020-11-11 19:33:45 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @gtconway3d Isn't giving away secrets treason, especially if you were president of the United States?

1326323089400094724 2020-11-11 08:37:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> The GOP party and trump are playing a game. They are doing everything to piss us off and distract us.  We MUST turn Georgia BLUE!  VOTE for @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff
1326320276636831744 2020-11-11 08:26:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump You are the dumbest person!   The person that was paid $130,000 by the GOP lied.  There is NO fraud.

1326257887535124495 2020-11-11 04:18:15 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> #MoscowMitch is evil and loves that he is.  He stopped hiding his evilness when President Obama was elected.
1326243904803524609 2020-11-11 03:22:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DavidBegnaud @EricTrump What's the issue?  They could have thousands after the election. It doesn't change the presidential election. Not one little bit.  But you'd know that if you were a stable genius like your daddy.  Oh maybe you are!  Education is key!
1326242830612918274 2020-11-11 03:18:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @washingtonpost No shit. This is why you don't elect a complete dipshit to be president. He has no morals and will sell us to the highest bidder.
1326242455050711042 2020-11-11 03:16:56 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @atrupar No then he'd have to pay the bill. This way Americans pay for his vacation.

1326228423237382144 2020-11-11 02:21:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Georgia if you hate #MoscowMitch as much as we do. YOU have the super power of taking his power away.  VOTE for both @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff for the win!

1325908859152715777 2020-11-10 05:11:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> It will always be talked about how a stupid talk show host took down the Republican party.   @senatemajldr  @LindseyGrahamSC  @SenatorCollins  @GOPLeader   @GOP  @SenateGOP  @HouseGOP   The laughingstock party!
1325908073630851072 2020-11-10 05:08:13 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @therecount @RexChapman @senatemajldr @senatemajldr  He has the right as long as there is evidence.  There is no fucking evidence of voter fraud.  There is tons of you suppressing the VOTE. But no fraud.   Kentucky, South Carolina and Maine must check the votes for cheating.
1325907317720817667 2020-11-10 05:05:13 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @WhiteHouse   Since you love firing people on Twitter.  Donald J. Trump you're fired!   You have until January 20 2021 to vacate the premises.    ~ Sincerely America
1325905025994993674 2020-11-10 04:56:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I really don't want to wish time away. But can it be January 21 2021 already with the Bidens in their new home for at least the next 4 years.  This stress is getting to me!

1325900054843027456 2020-11-10 04:36:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @senatemajldr  How did you, @LindseyGrahamSC and @SenatorCollins win if there is voter fraud?    Americans want your totals reviewed. You have lowest ratings yet you won!    How are your votes okay but trump's aren't? Same election.
1325885704585535489 2020-11-10 03:39:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IngrahamAngle Laura facts matter.  Our government did not fund Pfizer.  In other words trump CAN'T take credit.

1325518360927498241 2020-11-09 03:19:38 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @BillKristol I'll go with Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, or Elizabeth Warren. Romney is totally out of touch of the average person. That was obvious when he ran against Obama.
1325517364646076420 2020-11-09 03:15:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I agree. Didn't vote for either but Bush stayed silent and that's inexcusable to me.  The Choice was clear. America ir trump.

1325207496781299718 2020-11-08 06:44:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ossoff Georgia vote for this man.  We need the Senate to heal this country.

1325171340727365633 2020-11-08 04:20:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Who's going to the inauguration?  I'd love to go.

1325091536175063043 2020-11-07 23:03:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PalmerReport Not to be mean, but to be mean.  It couldn't happen to a better person.
1325091275968815105 2020-11-07 23:02:33 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @voteblue8888 Happy Birthday!
1325089955639595009 2020-11-07 22:57:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JoyceWhiteVance @Bullsranch99 No one said he was a stable genius.  Oh wait.
1325080047229734912 2020-11-07 22:17:56 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrFan Here it is people. Proof that aliens do exist.
1325079501945122817 2020-11-07 22:15:46 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GrandpaSnarky Amazing that he'd want to stay. He hates the white house.  But for all enjoyment it would be fun to watch them all dragged from our house.   In fact if we had to pay to watch it would pay for the next election to keep it blue.
1325070774802190336 2020-11-07 21:41:05 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit Donny it's simple.  More people voted for Biden.  Biden is more popular, just like Obama was and still is more popular.    In other words, people hate you!  Me included.
1325070302678831106 2020-11-07 21:39:13 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @PaulFox50854324 Congrats. Me too.

1325064173202657283 2020-11-07 21:14:52 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Actually I'm shocked it isn't more. We want a president for all the people. Not one that does for you as long as you lie and tell him how great he is. No more red vs Blue. But a president for the UNITED States.
1325062140462555138 2020-11-07 21:06:47 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ThewigglywormSj So very sorry for your loss.
1325058619134578688 2020-11-07 20:52:47 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz That win is pretty suspicious rick!
1325055431505547271 2020-11-07 20:40:07 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Jobs haven't been added. Those are people that returned to work.
1324917525885358081 2020-11-07 11:32:08 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz Oh Rick, your bestie doesn't even know your name!
1324906625522659328 2020-11-07 10:48:49 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ksorbs Hard to accept an election when Russia was behind it.  And who'd want a killer for president, bounties on troops and does nothing for Covid-19.
1324902829820096514 2020-11-07 10:33:44 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DonaldJTrumpJr Proof?    Oh that's right you just throw shit out without ever proving anything.
1324902109691699200 2020-11-07 10:30:53 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump @EveningEdit Wow for a stable genius it's amazing you ask this.

1324888061252136962 2020-11-07 09:35:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Makes sense #LeningradLindsey sticking yourself with the biggest loser.    When he's gone who will you attach yourself to?
1324885473249071104 2020-11-07 09:24:46 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> When is Biden speaking?

1324875175330975747 2020-11-07 08:43:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP You are all hated in your states along with the rest of America. So how'd you win reelection?

1324856864451055616 2020-11-07 07:31:05 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump President Biden! President Biden! President Biden!
1324856009630928898 2020-11-07 07:27:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Does anyone else find it odd that all the good for nothing republican senators won reelection?  Americans and their states hate them yet they won. Am I the only one?
1324853371057164289 2020-11-07 07:17:12 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @CharlesBenson4 They really aren't good with math.  More than half the country voted for Joe Biden.
1324852784831881216 2020-11-07 07:14:53 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump President Biden has a nice ring to it. Can't wait!

1324818804589924356 2020-11-07 04:59:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I've been exhausted. Took a 1/2 nap. Check Twitter and all hell has broken loose.  GOP yelling about fraud etc.   Enough.  Call it already. Joe Biden is president. Kamala Harris is VP.  Don't let trump run this. Don't!
1324817222540341253 2020-11-07 04:53:34 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz As usual you're throwing shit to see what will stick.  I'm so disappointed FL-1 reelected your sorry ass.    Trump loss. Deal with it!
1324813020112015361 2020-11-07 04:36:52 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Bill_Maxwell_ Congrats. Best way to stop.
1324785501216395270 2020-11-07 02:47:31 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump They voted, for Joe Biden who cares about what happens and will do something about bounties on them. Enough said!
1324784861962555395 2020-11-07 02:44:59 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DWUhlfelderLaw You are horrid @GovRonDeSantis  This didn't have to be.
1324778265119215617 2020-11-07 02:18:46 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @SenWhitehouse Trump showed us exactly who each of these senators are.  It's not good.

1324771275852623872 2020-11-07 01:50:59 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonOverstreet Thank you Jason. You've gotten me through especially the last few months.  Like you my 1st choice was Elizabeth Warren and my second was Kamala Harris.  Both these women inspire me. I've loved every one of your posts and your undying support of Warren.

1324763069885665288 2020-11-07 01:18:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOPLeader What battle?  Voters having their voices heard?
1324756780778459143 2020-11-07 00:53:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @ReporterCioffi That nothing will get done and everyone will blame Biden.
1324756461990432773 2020-11-07 00:52:07 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @harrisonjaime America was rooting for you.  On a side note, you should check the votes, I think you were cheated. Graham is hated.

1324746052566716418 2020-11-07 00:10:46 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Agree and frankly someone needs to look into how McConnell. Graham, Collins and Ernst won.
1324745211357122560 2020-11-07 00:07:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Once it is announced that Joe Biden has won.  Every single person needs to watch your backs.  Be careful there will be extremists out to cause harm. And trump will be egging them on.  Be safe!
1324744315281747970 2020-11-07 00:03:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @HMonkbottle @GovRonDeSantis It was @GovRonDeSantis. He got it overturned taking away Floridians voice.
1324743863072968704 2020-11-07 00:02:04 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DonaldJTrumpJr We love Joe and hate your daddy with a passion.   What country are you all running to so you aren't put behind bars?
1324742449944809472 2020-11-06 23:56:27 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I have a bottle of champagne and may even bathe (kidding, I'm clean) in celebration.  Announce 46 ~ President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris already!
1324741138377527298 2020-11-06 23:51:14 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DonaldJTrumpJr Yes. There are that many people that hate you!
1324739992174944269 2020-11-06 23:46:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @HMonkbottle @GovRonDeSantis Maybe we should start a fund and pay off their do called debts so they can help us VOTE in the future. 2020 is right around the corner.
1324739037786230784 2020-11-06 23:42:53 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @IvankaTrump Get the fuck out! And take your horrid husband and daddy with you

1324723448518791169 2020-11-06 22:40:56 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @senatemajldr How'd you steal the election? Kentucky and all other states hate you.
1324721694955786240 2020-11-06 22:33:58 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @chrislhayes Disagree. Democrats need to figure out how to win more in every town and city.
1324721165017993217 2020-11-06 22:31:52 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> You'd think a governor would be screaming for their constituents to have their ballots counted.  But not @GovRonDeSantis.   Trump barely won FL.  If USPS delivered ballots Biden may have won.   Desantis kills ballots &amp; people.
1324711864220135424 2020-11-06 21:54:55 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Mocraig13 They followed him for the ratings.  We had 4 years of hell so the media could have ratings.
1324703501319024640 2020-11-06 21:21:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @senatemajldr How did you steal your VOTE?  You are the most hated man in this country and Kentucky.   Kentucky you need to verify your VOTE went to the candidate you actually voted for.
1324701743473659909 2020-11-06 21:14:42 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @CBSNews @weijia Frankly I don't give a damn if trump pulls up his panties and concedes.   We will dance and celebrate our new president, President Biden and VP Kamala Harris.
1324700658616930304 2020-11-06 21:10:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Just what do you get out of a trump presidency?
1324699530554712064 2020-11-06 21:05:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @BillKristol None of them can ever "redeem" themselves. Ever!
1324698803753127937 2020-11-06 21:03:01 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @BlueVotr None.  I never want to ever hear their names again.  Ever!
1324698133658521600 2020-11-06 21:00:21 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP Americans need this party to stand up and defend our integrity of our elections.
1324697545965215744 2020-11-06 20:58:01 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Your poor children! When they are old enough to know their dad was a weak coward only out for himself.
1324685293178507266 2020-11-06 20:09:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio The USPS didn't deliver 27% if the ballots that they were ordered to deliver.  Why are you not outraged?  These need to be allowed!
1324670957475299328 2020-11-06 19:12:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Yamiche @LindseyGrahamSC @LindseyGrahamSC you were literally begging for money. Where did you get $500,000 to donate?  Your win needs to be looked into, it smells rotten.
1324538516739706881 2020-11-06 10:26:05 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio You should be demanding these ballots get counted.  Aren't you for Floridians and their rights?   Instead you go back to red vs Blue.    Your poor children that have to grow up knowing what a spineless jerk you really are.
1324529532733448193 2020-11-06 09:50:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @OttoTopci The good old days when we had the gumption to NOT elect stupid people.
1324528687883145219 2020-11-06 09:47:02 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> OMG! Did I miss it? Did Hillary and Hunter win the election?
1324512495374159872 2020-11-06 08:42:41 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Marco you and the rest of us sane people know damn well trump has no leg to stand on.  So shut the fuck up!!!
1324511229591855112 2020-11-06 08:37:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> differences, etc.    I truly believe this is so important.  Biden will have his hands full dealing with the pandemic and getting people back to work.  To go forward we need to be ahead of game.
1324511228480442368 2020-11-06 08:37:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I know there are so called experts but they missed the mark big time.    I'd really like to know what groups are really looking for.  I know late term abortion is huge. How do we educate people on this subject. That guns won't be taken away, religion
1324511226936889344 2020-11-06 08:37:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> ▪︎Japanese?  ▪︎African Americans? ▪︎LGBTQ? ▪︎Women- Protection against violence, equal pay ▪︎the young ▪︎whites  There are super important things groups look for in a candidate. What is "it"?  We need to know so this never happens a day again.
1324511224160202752 2020-11-06 08:37:38 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> I'm on to the next election. This is too damn close. How do we get the message across Democrats are better for our literal health.  Targeting groups. ▪︎Cuban community- healthcare is important. What else? ▪︎Puerto Ricans? ▪︎Mexicans? ▪︎Chinese?
1324486849629462528 2020-11-06 07:00:47 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC No one with an ounce of brain would listen to anything you say.
1324473272960954369 2020-11-06 06:06:50 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump All the VOTES are legal.  How is it you politicians protect trump yet you don't protect Americans who VOTE you in, that you're working for?
1324471704941432832 2020-11-06 06:00:36 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DWUhlfelderLaw As matty did.
1324470461208690690 2020-11-06 05:55:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz No Matty you're sad. Every VOTE matters. You work for Floridians act like it
1324468565676875777 2020-11-06 05:48:08 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @sunsetsue2 The ballots held back on election day should still be delivered and counted.  The people did the right thing, the government's screwing us.
1324467960635936768 2020-11-06 05:45:43 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Every time I look at Twitter I expect to see Joe and Kamala have won.    Am I the only one that does this?
1324457146189303809 2020-11-06 05:02:45 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realhomomarcus @realDonaldTrump Yes
1324451626065735681 2020-11-06 04:40:49 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Trump is suing the Atlantic Ocean because it touches Mar a lago and it's full of sharks.
1324451084795084803 2020-11-06 04:38:40 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonMillerinDC Illegal?  Since when don't we count mail in voting? Military etc. How'd you feel if we said your VOTE is invalid?
1324449925439082499 2020-11-06 04:34:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RepMattGaetz Matty Democrats aren't socialists but we do care about our fellow citizens unlike your party.   We do want the best for everyone not just the rich that do benefit from socialism.
1324449308234702849 2020-11-06 04:31:36 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Chasten Christmas has been up since August.
1324432900155150337 2020-11-06 03:26:24 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz Matty every VOTE should count. How would you feel if we said your VOTE didn't count?
1324415622760042499 2020-11-06 02:17:45 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @politvidchannel Hell no.
1324414129214529536 2020-11-06 02:11:49 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JuliBunting People of Kentucky should demand proof that the way they voted was not changed.   Kentucky, South Carolina and Maine. It's almost like Putin ran the election.  No matter who you voted for it was changed to one of these candidates.
1324409182506934279 2020-11-06 01:52:10 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DWUhlfelderLaw Can't come soon enough.
1324408755094769665 2020-11-06 01:50:28 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> #MoscowMitch is unamerican. When Obama was elected he said even if a bill helps the American people he'd make sure it failed.  Now he wants to tell a 46 who he can put in his cabinet, meaning only his picks.  He is out to destroy America. Fuck you Kentucky.
1324402998882295808 2020-11-06 01:27:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio  @SenRickScott  @GovRonDeSantis   DeJoy didn't deliver ballots on time. They need to be delivered and counted.  Stand up for Americans. You know do your job.
1324402586728992768 2020-11-06 01:25:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Jim_Jordan Every presidential election Florida has had problems. Last I checked they aren't blue.    In fact they still have issues. The USPS didn't deliver ballots.  We demand they do and they are counted.
1324376187376992260 2020-11-05 23:41:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Jim_Jordan Not true. Florida's votes weren't delivered by DeJoy!  Talk about cheating!  Fuck you jim!
1324373105909944321 2020-11-05 23:28:48 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JustJOlson1more That calls for a talk with this teacher.
1324372506627768328 2020-11-05 23:26:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump This is not presidential!
1324358654838099971 2020-11-05 22:31:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Every ballot deserves to be counted.  You don't hear us yelling to stop all the trump votes.    This is the American process.  Deal with it.
1324357989554413571 2020-11-05 22:28:44 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @rxjef77 Jeff you've got this. Hoping you have a quick pain free recovery.
1324338231379398661 2020-11-05 21:10:14 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @RBTrepessa @JacekJasinski @iamsojinxy @LindaBr67589020 @harrisonjaime All the Republican senators that won. McConnell, Graham Collins etc.
1324336288112222208 2020-11-05 21:02:30 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JebBush You and your brother George are useless.  This was and is a fight for America and you chose to remain silent.
1324336000005480456 2020-11-05 21:01:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @clarkgal @JebBush This is a joke. Right?
1324316923581091841 2020-11-05 19:45:33 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @H_MitchellPhoto @pat1556 It is unbelievable.
1324316757939675136 2020-11-05 19:44:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @williamlegate He has over $420 million dollars to pay back.  He needs every dime he can steal.
1324316063224500224 2020-11-05 19:42:08 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonMillerinDC No one cares what you think. Just pay all your child support payments.
1324312274170007553 2020-11-05 19:27:05 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JacekJasinski @RBTrepessa @iamsojinxy @LindaBr67589020 @harrisonjaime These need to be contested.
1324309253063139328 2020-11-05 19:15:05 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @UROCKlive1 I agree. How did these hateful senators that were hated in their states win reelection?   There is something very fishy about these wins.
1324304475650248704 2020-11-05 18:56:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LizForTX8 Some one reliable needs to check those votes.  He is the most hated man.
1324302516423663621 2020-11-05 18:48:18 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @WordswithSteph @GovRonDeSantis why are you not screaming that these ballots must be delivered and counted?  Are you not a governor for all Floridians?
1324178678188855296 2020-11-05 10:36:13 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz There are thousands of ballots that need to be counted in Miami Dade.  Haven't you heard DeJoy held them rather than delivering them? Every ballot has a right to be counted.
1324154966467108866 2020-11-05 09:02:00 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @snarkgrapefruit Soda
1324132005999685634 2020-11-05 07:30:46 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Hilarious.  That isn't how elections work.  OMG this is just fucking hilarious.
1324131223522975744 2020-11-05 07:27:39 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realhomomarcus Yes a little
1324106493466152964 2020-11-05 05:49:23 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GovRonDeSantis @FLSecofState Florida is a model for cheating. It started in 2000 and just gets worse with every election.
1324080940977688577 2020-11-05 04:07:51 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JoyAnnReid Education.  Send them to school to understand the difference.  The United States will never be like Cuba ( unless trump wins).
1324079997120925696 2020-11-05 04:04:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LindseyGrahamSC I don't believe you.  Jaime Harrison was getting small donor donations, not you.    How'd you steal this #LeningradLindsey? How?
1324079354394091522 2020-11-05 04:01:32 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @LindseyGrahamSC How'd you steal this?  You are hated!
1324079111866851337 2020-11-05 04:00:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DismantleNRA Did that a long time ago.
1324078969902321666 2020-11-05 04:00:01 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetzisbad @mattgaetz @RepMattGaetz @PhilEhr I guess the panhandle is more white supremacists than I thought. I for one was hoping they'd VOTE for the decent man not the ignorant immature one.
1324071244568944641 2020-11-05 03:29:19 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @erichirshberg @Marston4ca42 @marcorubio He is. But unless people wake up in Florida he will be reelected. And he's hated here.
1324070479750176768 2020-11-05 03:26:17 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @leahvallee @LeinoErica Not one on these "wins"makes sense. I think those votes all need to be verified. These are all 3 candidates that were hated in their states and the country.
1324055653741187072 2020-11-05 02:27:22 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Is anyone else struggling with the Republican senators that won.    It makes absolutely no sense.  Something smells wrong about these wins.
1324052518968713216 2020-11-05 02:14:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mstone1104 Ahhh.  Happy Birthday!  Just saw.
1324050235904172036 2020-11-05 02:05:50 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Shame you don't really follow him.

1324017921631391744 2020-11-04 23:57:26 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio  We demand an answer.
1324016532255580160 2020-11-04 23:51:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @michaelharriot I'm white and it sickens and infuriates me that white people screwed this up.
1324015786516795392 2020-11-04 23:48:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Today I am so pissed at George W and Jeb Bush keeping silent.    It tells me though they were and are only out for themselves.   This election was not a time for silence.
1323960673920028673 2020-11-04 20:09:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @Dr_Crater We know your pain. I live in Florida and don't get it. With #MoscowMitch's numbers I think foul play is at hand. The same in S Carolina.
1323956422493773824 2020-11-04 19:53:03 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @atdavidhoffman I agree. Americans have had enough. Yet Republicans are winning?  No. Something smells rotten.
1323940110103158785 2020-11-04 18:48:14 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> McConnell and Lindsey won. If Collins wins. Someone needs to check these votes.    People aren't this stupid.  They can't be.  Did machines change votes?    These 3 are hated, even in their own states.    Something doesn't smell right.
1323931449955913731 2020-11-04 18:13:49 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @donwinslow It makes you wonder about the votes. How have so many people turned into trump supporters.  Makes no sense.
1323930899466063873 2020-11-04 18:11:38 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Had a horrible night to wake up to Graham being reelected and Biden still not called our president.  I can't do this anymore.  I don't know where to go to live but this isn't our country anymore.   I hate people and their ignorance.
1323803252186632194 2020-11-04 09:44:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Give up your DNA trump on the rape charges!  But you won't because you're fucking guilty+
1323800858698633216 2020-11-04 09:34:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @mattgaetz Such a shame that an immature little boy won.

1323796823228796928 2020-11-04 09:18:52 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @kayleighmcenany No Americans are in charge. God wouldn't take that away from the people since he gave us all brains.
1323796206200459266 2020-11-04 09:16:25 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @AP Kentucky once again votes against themselves.
1323795179489341440 2020-11-04 09:12:20 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JollyMollyRoger May death take McConnell and put us all out of misery. Covid-19 or heart attack.   Maybe then Kentucky will wake up.
1323792552886210560 2020-11-04 09:01:54 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @gerribrod @JamesCarville Strict Republicans and ignorant people.

1323782157391794177 2020-11-04 08:20:35 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @koviebiakolo Last night I slept. Refused to stay up. Prayed Americans were smart enough to VOTE for Hillary. I knew if trump won, I wouldn't sleep for 4 years.
1323781116906606592 2020-11-04 08:16:27 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @FoxNews Trump campaign claims God wants trump.  Not true. God gave us all a brain and then VOTE.  Biden for the win.

1320701458178887681 2020-10-26 20:18:59 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump confused @RepMattGaetz with Rick Gates.  The guy that pleaded guilty for conspiracy.  Remember him.

1320052593050193926 2020-10-25 01:20:38 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @guelphgirlchris It's voter fraud because he can't use a business as a residence address of where he  lives, mar a lago.   He mailed in his ballot for the primary, not this election.    He and Melania should be thrown in jail for voting in Florida.

Democrats know, you may recover but more than likely you may have pre-existing conditions that will follow you.  Democrats want to protect health care. Democrats also gave you coverage for them.

We care that the supreme court will not overturn, Gay Marriage, Roe vs Wade, and the ACA. We care that the Senate is going against Americans by trying to nominate a SCJ.

No one is ever taking guns away.

They truly believe any woman can abort a 8 month old pregnancy.  We need to do better.

1301342695630295041 2020-09-03 10:14:11 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @JasonMillerinDC Pay your child support payments!  82% of Americans don't make over $400,000 which is who Joe Biden will tax.
1301341694835777536 2020-09-03 10:10:12 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @GOP Lies.  And you're not good at it.    #AmericaStrongerWithBiden  VOTE for @JoeBiden  VOTE out @GOP party

1301305334875803648 2020-09-03 07:45:43 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @DonaldJTrumpJr So what!  It isn't like she is out golfing every weekend while people, thousands of people die.
1301304806343086081 2020-09-03 07:43:37 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @HKrassenstein Think about this.  He told his base!  Let them vote twice.  All these votes will be discarded for fraud,  trump loses.
1301304131659890689 2020-09-03 07:40:56 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Has there ever been an attorney general that one side or the other had called for their resignation besides Bill Barr?  Anyone?

1301248232660635651 2020-09-03 03:58:49 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @marcorubio Wonder when Putin will come after Americans?  Who will be first?

1301134304609796099 2020-09-02 20:26:06 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> Trump lies, then lies about the lie etc.  The @GOP have followed suit.   People will say, oh that's just trump. But no one will forgive the @GOP for the same.  We actually hold them to a higher standard than we do a president.   VOTE out @GOP party

1300889148631457792 2020-09-02 04:11:57 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> We must send a loud indisputable message November  3rd 2020.   Biden MUST win in the biggest, largest, hugest, most gigantic landslide in American history!  Let's do this!    And VOTE out every GOP member.  Your VOTE counts!

1300842788582494208 2020-09-02 01:07:43 +0800 <GardeniaCoast> @realDonaldTrump Comical that you always have to tell people that YOU are their favorite president.
