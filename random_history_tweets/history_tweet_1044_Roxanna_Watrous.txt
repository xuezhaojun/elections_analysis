Weâ€™re also subject to ever increasing regulations that limits customer freedom of choice in materials.

Europeans settled New England, then fought a war of Independence from England and then founded the US, or did they forget to teach you that in school? Iâ€™m native.

We have the first hand records that the US history text books are written from. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. Love that racists Anglophobes like you are telling founding families our history.   Apologize for your racism &amp; stop being anti-White racist and Ameriphobe.

It increases the surrounding property values and creates a tourist attraction that drives up tax revenue &amp; the budget for the city. Beauty pays.

You may hate the ethnic European tribes who founded this country but this architecture is our native heritage and moreover itâ€™s beautiful.

1341083890736250880 2020-12-22 02:11:30 +0800 <Roxanna_Watrous> @amber_athey I love this idea. The classical architecture is so much more beautiful and such a public treasure for us all to enjoy.
