Today? I revisited that dreadful memory once again. I hope the victim recovers quickly, and the shooter is brought to justice.

1328515721991745536 2020-11-17 09:50:05 +0800 <SherylReeder> @cryborg trump’s the guy who advises you to go out and max out the credit cards and buy a new car when you confide in him you’re forced to file bankruptcy. He’s a vindictive, sadistic pos.

1328509208887664641 2020-11-17 09:24:12 +0800 <SherylReeder> @Kat4Obama I can’t buy anything until pay day this Friday, and am wondering if there will BE anything to buy, and whether or not my daughter and her husband will join me... I am so damned sad right now.

1327719870461427715 2020-11-15 05:07:39 +0800 <SherylReeder> @peacelovinMimi While in America my daughter-in-law, the GM of a successful seafood restaurant, had to lay off nearly all of her staff due to a 4 week pause for indoor dining, just before the holidays. I will dance in the streets for days when trump is no longer on the planet.

1327652839330521088 2020-11-15 00:41:18 +0800 <SherylReeder> This was a delightful distraction last night.
1327495240173854720 2020-11-14 14:15:03 +0800 <SherylReeder> I am confused. All the speculation regarding a self-pardon or pence pardon for trump begs the question: what indictments/charges will be pardoned? Surely it wouldn’t be for future indictments, would it? Any lawyers, scholars, and intellectuals chime in anytime. @20thgrader

1306408953710952448 2020-09-17 09:45:41 +0800 <SherylReeder> I cannot stress enough how every person on the West Coast is affected by these horrific fires. The air quality is off the charts, and piling on to an already god awful year.  #WestCoastFires  #AirQuality

1306055926294540288 2020-09-16 10:22:52 +0800 <SherylReeder> Seriously, firefighters on the West Coast - where I live - need to drop some sage along with that fire retardant. It’s time to smudge the country.

1303858768891969536 2020-09-10 08:52:09 +0800 <SherylReeder> @Eiggam5955 He’s not getting re-elected. He’s going to lose by the biggest margin in American politics.
1303800041170108418 2020-09-10 04:58:47 +0800 <SherylReeder> I, unfortunately, am more than aware as I have family in Medford, OR, friends on alert to evacuate outside of Portland, and am commuting through smoke so thick it's like being in the middle of a giant campfire.  All those who pray, pray for rain.

1303471301865009153 2020-09-09 07:12:30 +0800 <SherylReeder> @Takethepwrback @bader_diedrich Same - I live in Vancouver, WA and commute to Longview, WA (45 miles north). The smoke is so thick it's like being in the middle of a huge camp fire.

Slight cataracts that likely won’t need surgery for 10 more years. 3. The answer to the age old question: “Which is better, 1 or 2?” remains elusive. 😉 #FridayThoughts

1301383387500834816 2020-09-03 12:55:52 +0800 <SherylReeder> @TammySueRuhl @dragonflei I don’t trust a weather report coming out of this administration, and I won’t trust a vaccine that hasn’t gone through proper testing protocols.

1300970521031393285 2020-09-02 09:35:17 +0800 <SherylReeder> @1813Doncarlo Does he say:  “...like me perfect...” ?
1300966066965757954 2020-09-02 09:17:35 +0800 <SherylReeder> @1813Doncarlo I love to quote Shakespeare, too.

1300638446168367104 2020-09-01 11:35:44 +0800 <SherylReeder> @MommaUnfiltered I loved the miniseries Lonesome Dove; the book was extraordinary. The reason the miniseries was so superb was 100% because the prose of the book read as though a screenplay.  The cast was primo, too.
1300624953604100097 2020-09-01 10:42:08 +0800 <SherylReeder> @BoysAndRescues I was lost for months after my dad died.  I locked my keys in the car. I couldn’t concentrate. I miss and grieve him even now,  11 years later. Be gentle with yourself, and take all the time you need. 💔
