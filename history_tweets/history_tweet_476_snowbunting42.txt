1344012527454330881 2020-12-30 04:08:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JenniferLinn17 Bernie has lied to you, and you don't even see it. Free insulin? That's too funny. Take  a second look at Canadian socialized health care...it may not be the panacea you think it is. here's some examples: https://t.co/vJEhX33tkP ( and no, medication is not free here...)
1344011619169431554 2020-12-30 04:05:15 +0800 <snowbunting42> @GreenNewDeal21 Bernie? The same guy who lies to you about Canadian health care?
1344011437539291138 2020-12-30 04:04:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @theken3000 @prageru here's a question...what would you consider a Failure' of socialized health acre to be? Not being able to get a doctor? Waiting a year or more to see a specialist for cardiac care? Needing the military to come in and take care of seniors in a care home?
1343954919712284674 2020-12-30 00:19:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MarkJaccard the problem is for his supporters, the ends will always justify the means. Right now, with so many hurting economically, it's not the time for a carbon tax. A good leader would see that.

1343922355266052098 2020-12-29 22:10:33 +0800 <snowbunting42> @kiraIeigh @vonToddenstein @washingtonpost maybe start asking celebrities, sports stars, corps like Amazon, Apple etc to start paying their fair share. If these CEOs gave just a fraction of their wealth, that would be a start.

1343709132768030722 2020-12-29 08:03:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Maria4rmatx do you take the same stand against the ANTIFA movement? If not, you're a hypocrite.
1343708796011614214 2020-12-29 08:01:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> @daybreaker how about the ANTIFA movement...they actually killed people, rioted, looted, destroyed property, etc, etc,. etc. Doesn't that count?
1343708423456755714 2020-12-29 08:00:27 +0800 <snowbunting42> @fcdpsc @NikkiHaley no,. they just riot, loot, burn things down, kill people during "protests"...if what this man did is terrorism, then the ATIFA movement needs the same designation...

1343703173370949632 2020-12-29 07:39:35 +0800 <snowbunting42> @fdjordanjr you know, your country is so violent that maybe just maybe, it doesn't seem like"news" anymore.  https://t.co/ULSHxqF2rZ
1343702465133293571 2020-12-29 07:36:47 +0800 <snowbunting42> @_camilleexoxo That likely speaks more to the level of violence in American society than anything else.   https://t.co/ULSHxqF2rZ
1343701400908423172 2020-12-29 07:32:33 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Asclepius_xray @AymanM the 24/7 doom and gloom news cycle doesn't help either. It just feeds paranoia and fear. I expect this will just be the tip of the iceberg. People's mental health is hurting, but somehow, no one seems to care all that much...until something like this happens.
1343699505825386496 2020-12-29 07:25:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Marina_Sirtis @NikkiHaley so how much of YOUR income are you giving away...hmmmm? I always find it frickin' hilarious when the elites of this world bleat on about how great socialism is.

Vancouver? #Alberta? The #North? #Canada
1343600617982451714 2020-12-29 00:52:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CthulhuHulu @WarlockWoods @MickIrishMuslim he could be like the Unibomber. If he is, his motives may not make any sense to anyone but him. Logic won't apply. Garbreoild Wartman was like that- already paranoid, and all the #covid19 measures set him off-he killed 22 people.
1343600166746664961 2020-12-29 00:50:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MickIrishMuslim If it was mental health related, this could be just the tip of the iceberg. People are scared, and the 24/7 doom and gloom on the news doesn't help. It's expected that, even if/when #COVID19 is under control, the long term health impacts will be here for a long time to come.
1343552596494217216 2020-12-28 21:41:15 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TonyTwoTap_ there's a suicide memorial wall on a walking trail where people place painted stones in memory of some lost to #suicide. There's been a lot more placed there lately, and many of them are elderly or young people. It's really taking a toll- I hope people start talking about that.
1343550863105785856 2020-12-28 21:34:22 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MzFlowerChilds @JustinNBC4 there was a guy up here (a  denturist of all people) who "broke" and went on a killing spree. He killed at least 22 people, burned down several house and would have kept going if the police hadn't shot him. All in one night.
1343550453053878275 2020-12-28 21:32:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JustinNBC4 if this is a case of mental illness, whet all the stress form #COVIDー19 , politics, constant "doom and gloom" of the 24 hours news cycle, he may be  a sign of #suicide rates spiking. What's being done to help?
1343549925276196880 2020-12-28 21:30:38 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JimRosicaFL if this report is true (suicide), then it brings forward questions about the mental health care system. People are under a huge amount of mental stress right now-what's being done to help?
1343306246976319491 2020-12-28 05:22:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AngelRTalk I could be very wrong, but if it was case of someone who was in poor mental health, the reasons for what they did may not make sense to anyone but them. The Unibomber and this guy are good examples.... https://t.co/aXgtZOaCB1
1343305492542664706 2020-12-28 05:19:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TonyTwoTap_ People are scared, and the 24 hour doom and gloom news cycle doesn't help. You take someone who is already unstable, add that, and the results can be terrible.

1343209247824375810 2020-12-27 22:56:54 +0800 <snowbunting42> it's not about hate. It's about expecting an elected official to do his job, to show up for work, to make decisions for the good of all and not just his personal pet projects.e.g.- carbon tax- when even the extinction rebellion crowd say it's not the time, its pretty bad.

The TB model would work-provide care those with #covid19 in a separate facility so it won't spread to those who dont have it in a general hospital setting.

1342886754190319619 2020-12-27 01:35:26 +0800 <snowbunting42> @1ofakndLizzy @CP24 that doesn't work unless it's enforced.e.g.-  They tried it here when the unis. started up classes in the fall. the residences were opened, and the students told to self isolate for 14 days.  Most did, but there were several who didn't
1342826802058813440 2020-12-26 21:37:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> @normbean4 @FOXNashville @TomiLahren you might want to check out this site. It gives factual, real time covid statistics  https://t.co/HgsUWcP3hD
1342823686437548033 2020-12-26 21:24:49 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TXKarlRichter There's people out there who act for reasons that won't make sense to anyone but them. If that's what's going on, it maybe very difficult to catch it.
1342823129698201603 2020-12-26 21:22:37 +0800 <snowbunting42> @sybil_wright_wi @girldrawsghosts I could be wrong, but it really does sound like someone who had an axe to grind, and their reasons might only make sense to them. The Unibomber was someone like that. He was a very paranoid man.
1342821432879943680 2020-12-26 21:15:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @trustrestored I know it might sound silly, but after all the stresses of the past year, maybe the pressure finally got to someone? The reason for the bomb may only make sense to them.
1342643319046860801 2020-12-26 09:28:07 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AlexLittleTN what if it is someone like the Unibomber...his actions didn't makes sense to anyone but him, other than that he hated technology. Of course, he didn't care who he hurt.
1342571828515102723 2020-12-26 04:44:02 +0800 <snowbunting42> @i_am_dree @NBCNews @WSMV In their mind, yes. You assume everything has to have some sort of political motive. It could well be whoever did this was reacting to something that makes sense to no one else but them.
1342571070486933504 2020-12-26 04:41:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> @i_am_dree @NBCNews @WSMV Why not wait for more evidence before jumping to conclusions? As it stands, people are spreading stories like wildfire. Some are even saying people were killed when they weren't. What good does that do?
1342569323538358272 2020-12-26 04:34:05 +0800 <snowbunting42> @i_am_dree @NBCNews @WSMV Nope. It can and does happen. People are desperate to try and make sense of it, so they'll come up with some rationale that fits in with their own world view. It could be a prank or someone who is angry for reasons that make no sense to no one else but them.
1342568756288114688 2020-12-26 04:31:49 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ray24271791 @LucasFoxNews @benshapiro you could be  https://t.co/F1OLg6dtRm quickly people forget the Unibomber. He made bombs for reasons that only made sense to him. It possible that's what's going on here. Someone with an axe to grind.

One got hurt, the rest took off. Stupid sure, but not a bomb.
1342564798056304640 2020-12-26 04:16:06 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Kevin974780671 @HLAurora63 You assume it was a bomb because that fits your world view.

That happened up here. Some teens thought it would be funny to light off some explosives in a car. All it did was make a big mess. One got burned and the others took off.
1342562844936720384 2020-12-26 04:08:20 +0800 <snowbunting42> @i_am_dree @NBCNews @WSMV so three people sustained non-serious injuries. sounds more like a prank gone wrong  to me.

1342232387657342977 2020-12-25 06:15:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> This is about the intellectual level of some of #Trudeau most staunch supporters. I can respect the ones who are open to discussion, but this? It's like talking to a concrete floor.

1341932599879544833 2020-12-24 10:23:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> and THIS is the attitude of the typical #Liberal #Trudeau supporter. Perfectly fine with ethics violations etc. Makes me wonder what they're paying these people.

1341809882895446018 2020-12-24 02:16:20 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MRafique234 and? why do feel your religious sensibilities are he most important thing? As an agnostic, I find them very offensive-does that mean I should be able to say there should be no religious symbolism in public spaces? Of course not.
1341809229569675264 2020-12-24 02:13:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MRafique234 good. religion has NO place in politics.

I have to wear a medical mask covid or not ( I used to get weird looks) because I'm immunosupressed thanks to medication I have to take. The dust style masks do little to nothing. They seem more like a way to placate people.

Many times, it's just mono culture of fast growing species (larch, spruce) for pulp and paper. they are not chosen because they help wildlife, increase biodiversity etc.
1341389427113930752 2020-12-22 22:25:35 +0800 <snowbunting42> @tonydr0 but that's the thing...our taxes aren't going down. they are staying the same or rising. There's lots of reasons for that( aging population, rising obesity rates, a more sedantary lifestyle, increased drug costs)
1341389026792763392 2020-12-22 22:24:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @tonydr0 that's  not the whole story... "In the UK the public health system ... is almost entirely paid for through taxation." and then there's these... https://t.co/45IKgASoAU

1341383220328316930 2020-12-22 22:00:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> @tonydr0 what? No it's not! The only "free" is at the hospital or doctors office. Everything else you pay for upfront. I'm lucky my husband is veteran so we have extended insurance that covers 90 percent of the other costs. Most don't have that .

1341382197941551106 2020-12-22 21:56:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @tonydr0 he lied about the Canadian system. just like many Americans, he thinks we get free medication, free vision care, free paraprofessional services, free dental. We most certainly do not. Shall I go on? I encourage you to do some more research on your own. Find out the truth.
1341381346388799489 2020-12-22 21:53:29 +0800 <snowbunting42> @tonydr0 Of course not. You are mixing up #entertainment with #science. Mr. Moore's "documentaries" are made to sensationalize and sell.

It's easy to say that when you're not going to have your health impacted waiting for medical acre while hospitals sit is limbo, waiting for a"surge" of covid patients that may or may not happen.
1341340215248621568 2020-12-22 19:10:02 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TheDiMono the thing is most are wearing dust mask style, not medical ones. if, as some say they can adequately prevent the spread of a virus, would you be okay if your doctor wore when when providing you with medical care?
1341339764214161408 2020-12-22 19:08:15 +0800 <snowbunting42> @xxivvixx here's a thought re: #masks. Most people are wearing dust masks, not medical ones. If you say they can still prevent viral spread, then I guess you'd be fine with your #doctor wearing one the next time you go to the #ER, get #surgery, etc.
1341338639624769537 2020-12-22 19:03:47 +0800 <snowbunting42> @PatBruc a significant number of those were in one (underfunded) care home -Northwood in #Halifax. How is #Trudeau  addressing this? Where is he actually admitted our country's health care system in in crisis, and that's been true long before covid?
1341337655901077513 2020-12-22 18:59:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @PatBruc sir. here in NS. more people may well die due to #COVID19  measures than the virus itself. We've had 65 direct #COVID20  deaths, but t #suicide, postponment of medical testing/treatments and sheer loneliness are taking an even heavier toll.  https://t.co/jZy6pILFyu

Smallpox vaccines were tested and found safe. they've been around in one form or another for a long time ( since 1796-using cowpox). This vaccine works in a very different way. It hasn't even undergone third stage trials yet.
1341140514767331328 2020-12-22 05:56:30 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ItsReallyAmber So you really think masks prevent the spread of #covid19? Maybe medical masks do,but eh "dust mask" style? What type would you want your doctor wearing during surgery or other treatments? If not, why?

What the hell does that even mean?
1341121302514573312 2020-12-22 04:40:10 +0800 <snowbunting42> @222Minutes It better not be. I need that med to live. It's sued to treat a variety of #autoimmune diseases. That, Imuran, omeprazole and amlodipiene help me keep mine under control.

1341011353499275264 2020-12-21 21:23:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @EkeBronc @canmericanized wait and see the end result. if a significant number of the people involved don't come down with #COVID19 in about two weeks, how will you explain that that?

1341010241866125312 2020-12-21 21:18:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> Here's a thought that should please voters no matter who they support. How about it be a requirement for federal level #politicians to agree to have a deep dive audit done of their finances, the non-redacted results to be made #public! #Canada #Liberals #CPC #NDP #Greens #PQ
1341009667401674752 2020-12-21 21:16:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> @rexglacer even I know more about not for profit governance than he does. I'd love to see a deep dive forensic audit of his finances.
1341009329873440769 2020-12-21 21:15:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ChrisMurphyCT Would recipients be asked to pay it back? Would it be taxed? That's what's going on up here with #CERB  https://t.co/oWJZVhPqvi
1341009025849290753 2020-12-21 21:14:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JillColtonFree it will be interesting to see if there's big spike in cases in those involved in the protest. If there's not, then something is up.
1341007742119624705 2020-12-21 21:08:55 +0800 <snowbunting42> @KidsHelpPhone St. Mary's has a program to reach out to students who will be on their own. Not sure about Dalhoiusie, NASCAD, Mount ST. Vincent's etc.

1340989505302638593 2020-12-21 19:56:27 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TheMacFarlane @IBoyd1966 @Mountai61137001 They take them  off on breaks.  seeing what some of the masks people are wearing , it's a moot point anyway. There's people out there who think a coffee filter will protect them and others ( I am not trying to be funny-it was actually recommend)
1340988806300897281 2020-12-21 19:53:40 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TheMacFarlane @IBoyd1966 @Mountai61137001 yes, a MEDICAL mask...people are wearing dust masks, those masks you wear when you're painting, those weird scarf things they pull up over their mouth- I even saw one woman wearing one made of of an old bra (I'm serious)
1340987334813229056 2020-12-21 19:47:49 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Mountai61137001 @Marie35396768 This is data from my province. A mask mandate came into effect at the end of July. Note the rise in numbers and when they happened and draw your own conclusion.  https://t.co/jZy6pILFyu
1340986990616047616 2020-12-21 19:46:27 +0800 <snowbunting42> @PawsRat @Mountai61137001 @ironandwine11 funny how out here in NS, we had almost no cases of #Covid_19 in July. Mask wearing mandate came into force, and now, even with everyone being forced to wear one, there's more cases than before.  https://t.co/jZy6pILFyu

1340982434838491137 2020-12-21 19:28:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TheMacFarlane @Mountai61137001 @IBoyd1966 I have to wear one, #Covid_19  or not. It's not always as simple as that.
1340981988120023040 2020-12-21 19:26:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> I wear my #mask, out of courtesy to others, but to all those who insist those dinky little non-medical dust #masks prevent the spread of disease, ask yourself this. Would you be satisfied if that's what your #doctor wore when treating you, performing surgery, etc.? #Covid_19
1340980334171721729 2020-12-21 19:20:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> Not to mention the drain it's is causing to the #healthcare system. We don't need to #fat shame, but there's ways to frankly address the issue that's both supportive and effective to help people to lose #weight and get #healthy. #Diet, #exercise, counselling and therapy if needed
1340980333118967808 2020-12-21 19:20:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> Since we're talking about ways to prevent #Covid_19  deaths, whey are we not discussing the #obesity #epidemic and how overweight people at higher risk of many illnesses- #diabetes, heart disease, #cancer, etc.
1340977844525133826 2020-12-21 19:10:06 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CalgaryPolice I usually support the police-most I have had the pleasure of knowing are good cops .  however, I've been seeing some very troubling behaviour lately  from some of your members.they are giving the rest a bad name. Surely you can get rid of those bad apples and leave the good ones.
1340975850527834112 2020-12-21 19:02:11 +0800 <snowbunting42> @SunGarrioch now THAT'S what's important
1340972527812816902 2020-12-21 18:48:59 +0800 <snowbunting42> @GilNimni wait until you see what this going to do to the students currently in university studying the sciences. On line labs are no substitute for hands on learning. Some will be the future doctor's nurses and other health care providers.
1340930408456851459 2020-12-21 16:01:37 +0800 <snowbunting42> @realCEOofANTIFA @jimmy_dore If you;re going to institute a public health care system get it right. Don't end up like us up here in eastern #Canada, where we have to wait almost a year or even longer for many types of medical care... this is just one example  https://t.co/h6bcXUpfZR
1340929591561613312 2020-12-21 15:58:22 +0800 <snowbunting42> @2018Aoc @AOC oh god, PLEASE tell me you're not someone else who lies about how we get free insulin up here, etc. I appreciate Canada's  pubic health system, but it is in need of some TLC. Get yours right! Don't end up like this...  https://t.co/h6bcXUpfZR

1340927609216114688 2020-12-21 15:50:29 +0800 <snowbunting42> @rogerapage @CalgaryPolice please can the "we're all in this other" nonsense. No we are not.
1340927316927655937 2020-12-21 15:49:20 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JideAkinwale @CalgaryPolice They both acted badly. however, the police, being in a position of authority, paid for by the public, should have done better

1340925569433817088 2020-12-21 15:42:23 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Cherylmcl57 @CalgaryPolice meh, if he was a member of a minority ( and I am one) this would have you singing a different tune
1340922273583280133 2020-12-21 15:29:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @cettytheyetty @wirthie33_31 @CalgaryPolice Safe? let me ask you this. How many people has covid killed in Calgary? Now compare that to the number of deaths due to delays medical treatment, delayed cancer screenings, suicides, mental health issues, spousal abuse, hunger, etc. Which side of the scale will be heavier?
1340921629841510401 2020-12-21 15:26:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @cettytheyetty @CalgaryPolice no masks, no social distancing, etc. Please try again.

1340920906290442240 2020-12-21 15:23:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Thurston79_79 @CalgaryPolice I assume you would say the same if this were a ANTIFA protester?

1340917295095418880 2020-12-21 15:09:30 +0800 <snowbunting42> @inky_mark I've met Liberal party supporters who absolutely loathe him and want him out. That's something i can respect. They don't just tow the party line. they can actually think for themselves. Hopefully, their numbers will grow.
1340916424349528065 2020-12-21 15:06:03 +0800 <snowbunting42> @EvanAKilgore questionable ( I'm agnostic)
1340916289267789824 2020-12-21 15:05:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @inky_mark This is the truth, although some want to deny it.
1340915374561345542 2020-12-21 15:01:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @NoelComics not only that, for some students, the school breakfast/lunch program was the only real meal they'd get all day. What are they supposed to do now?
1340915012106399745 2020-12-21 15:00:26 +0800 <snowbunting42> @NoelComics It's also not so great for #specialneeds students, university #students ( especially those in the sciences who have to do labs) etc. Not for profits have had to cancel many in person fundraisers,  and the #virtual replacements aren't filling the gap. #Covid_19

1340833806874501120 2020-12-21 09:37:45 +0800 <snowbunting42> @NoelComics I really wish people would can the crap about "virtual learning:" being an accepatble alternative to in person leaning. For many IT ISN'T!
1340833359501602817 2020-12-21 09:35:59 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MichaelLeoM @Randall_Denley so let me get this straight- it;s safe for my son to go to school wearing a mask, but it's not safe to do other things while wearing one? I'm sorry, but that's just silly.

1340751812689846275 2020-12-21 04:11:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> Only three days until #Festivus...anyone want to get the airing of grievances off to an early start,lol #canada #Covid_19 #COVID19 #holidays  https://t.co/41ad4UpCY9
1340686360139730946 2020-12-20 23:51:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> @merry123459 that;s fricking' hilarious. #Trudeau does nothing but kiss #CCP behind.
1340686169542189056 2020-12-20 23:51:06 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JustinTrudeau sir, my kids are some of these "young people". They aren't stupid enough to fall for your lines. You have done NOTHING but create divisiveness.
1340685546511851521 2020-12-20 23:48:37 +0800 <snowbunting42> @RagingLibNana must be nice to be able to spend the holidays with his family. not all of us are so lucky.

1340684722184335364 2020-12-20 23:45:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> @cblackst and yet we keep being fed the tripe that he cares. what's the saying about before removing the mote from your neighbour's eye, attend to the beam in thine own?
1340684379065094146 2020-12-20 23:43:59 +0800 <snowbunting42> @WaytowichNeil really? you must be one of the privileged few.
1340684074181156866 2020-12-20 23:42:46 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ResearchWing I feel so awful for the average people there who are just trying to live their lives.
1340683701492068355 2020-12-20 23:41:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Kotyjo the rank and file in #Quebec and #Ontario don't matter either. I really think it's high time we stopped allowing politicians to divide us.
1340683267385790464 2020-12-20 23:39:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> @bmyska the same is true for all this "we're all in this together" nonsense. I challenge anyone who says this to take a look at the not for profit orgs. that are cancelling fundraisers and even closing their doors for good. that's our social safety net, and no one seems to care.
1340658467724517379 2020-12-20 22:01:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> @LPatrol4 @melflower586 @jeannetix @CalgaryPolice ah, I see :). Sometimes things get "lost in translation" on social media
1340658162345586688 2020-12-20 21:59:48 +0800 <snowbunting42> @dubsndoo @paulaspeak2 I think the goal of this government is to get people squabbling. If we're bickering among ourselves, we won't notice the crap he's trying to pull.
1340657694131302400 2020-12-20 21:57:57 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Kotyjo unless you're and elite from #Quebec or #Ontario, you don't matter. It's bad for us out on the east coast too. Stick boy needs to go. #trudeau  https://t.co/owxmT5L9sx

1340656499878752256 2020-12-20 21:53:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AEvanoff_TheAce @RosemaryHamulka How much of ti is actually reaching the people we are told we are "helping" ? How is it actually being used? Anyone from #Somalia,  can you shed some light on this? #africa
1340655744904007683 2020-12-20 21:50:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> Darn kid is almost an adult now, and he's a techie. most of the time, I have no idea what he's up to. Maybe it's better I don't, lol.
1340655743683485696 2020-12-20 21:50:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> Anybody else out there have a kid who's a #techie?  My son is. When he was four, he figured out how to access the #wifi on the printer at the school we lived next door to. No password, and he tried to get it to print off a bunch of weird things.
1340654858609844228 2020-12-20 21:46:41 +0800 <snowbunting42> @elonmusk not for me...my brother gave my kids $100.00 bucks worth a while back, but I had no idea what to do with it. It got "stolen"😭🤣. I have a feeling my techie son has some sort of bitcoin miner going (ha! I just used a techie phrase.good for me,lol)
1340653676642361345 2020-12-20 21:41:59 +0800 <snowbunting42> We must have looked pretty funny, all crowded under one umbrella, walking home from the bus stop. It was a small kindness but one that made. a big difference.
1340653674654273540 2020-12-20 21:41:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> In fact, they have been some of the kindest people I've met, especially seniors. I will never for how one elderly couple say me out walking with my young kids in the rain and insisted I get under their umbrella with them. (1/2)
1340652911173484546 2020-12-20 21:38:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Bret_Sears @Marie35396768 what if a private individual were to file a suit against him or ( tongue in cheek...sort of) make a "citizen's arrest". It might be the only way to get rid of stick boy. https://t.co/VRc9dvWMnW
1340651655025537027 2020-12-20 21:33:57 +0800 <snowbunting42> @DrEricDing I was among the last people in Canada to get it. My dad was working in public health at the time (mycology) and dragged me, apparently kicking and screaming to get it, lol.
1340651167571988480 2020-12-20 21:32:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> I wish people wild stop blaming people from #China for #Covid_19 . It's not their fault. The #CCP is a draconian entity, but the #Chinese people, at least those I have been fortunate enough to meet, are not.
1340650459594448899 2020-12-20 21:29:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MickIrishMuslim I really wish people would be more honest about this. I appreciate our health care system, but it needs help. It breaks my heart for my daughter. She's has a disease that is getting worse, and need to see a neurologist. These are the current wait times... https://t.co/h6bcXUpfZR
1340649577960124417 2020-12-20 21:25:42 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ColinBawn @Bob_Loblaw1970 @Marie35396768 @nenshi Are you seriously telling me that going from nearly NO cases over the summer and early fall to a current level 46 (two new today) is not a spike?   https://t.co/jZy6pILFyu
1340648694669045760 2020-12-20 21:22:11 +0800 <snowbunting42> I guess #socialdistancing bylaws only apply in certain situations. #Covid_19 NONE of these people are six feet apart. Why no arrests or tickets issued?  https://t.co/UtPIqMBM6D
1340648015355371520 2020-12-20 21:19:29 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Jamiescribbles @CalgaryPolice did you demand that blm protesters be arrested for not following social distancing protocols? Even the police departments own photos show that wasn't happening.
1340647707866750980 2020-12-20 21:18:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @daniellemelie @CalgaryPolice did you say the same thing during BLM protests? Even the police's own pictures show no social distancing was taking place.
1340647194072891392 2020-12-20 21:16:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @LPatrol4 @melflower586 @jeannetix @CalgaryPolice bull. I saw a lot of footage of those BLM protests.  An awful lot weren't wearing masks of any kind, and social distancing was out the window.
1340646634124939266 2020-12-20 21:14:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @iceTyyc @CalgaryPolice I agree the police usually do a really good job, and in most cases I fully support them.  In this instance? No.
1340646145010360324 2020-12-20 21:12:03 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CalgaryPolice Usually I am in full support  of the police. they have a really tough job that I wouldn't want to do, and I appreciate that they are willing to take it on. This being said, this recent activity is starting to smack of "I was only following orders"
1340489596019355649 2020-12-20 10:49:59 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MickIrishMuslim Ugh, he's the one who kept insisting we get free insulin in Canada. He lied.
1340468262820327425 2020-12-20 09:25:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ItsMeJesseDee @Cartwright_Four You don't get to decide what is a valid reason or not...
1340467596513177604 2020-12-20 09:22:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ItsMeJesseDee really? did you say they same saying when people were protesting for a cause YOU support?
1340467295429283840 2020-12-20 09:21:22 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ItsMeJesseDee @Cartwright_Four maybe all those BLM protest should have been cancelled too.
1340466678531055616 2020-12-20 09:18:55 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ItsMeJesseDee oh i forgot..."we're all in this together"...

1340335661711302658 2020-12-20 00:38:18 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ColinBawn @Bob_Loblaw1970 @Marie35396768 @nenshi of for eff sake...we went up from basically zero in the summer. The new cases didn't just pop in from nowhere.
1340335329916674053 2020-12-20 00:36:59 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MockingjayMo @oklahomacaptive @JosephGKogutJr @perlmutations you can embrace completely different ideologies and sill be as corrupt as all get out.
1340279398319198208 2020-12-19 20:54:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @GasPriceWizard @paulaspeak2 My older daughter attends a very #liberal leaning university. Her fellow students think this is wrong, including the "Extinction Rebellion" crowd. Even they get it.
1340278426935173121 2020-12-19 20:50:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ErinHSchultz @BrentButt @TSpencerNairn here's some decor for you, lol  https://t.co/gJzgpBlYue
1340277432532807682 2020-12-19 20:46:55 +0800 <snowbunting42> @realangsiegel My daughters have been inspired by strong women. Women who are HONEST. This woman does not fit that category.
1340276904377593857 2020-12-19 20:44:49 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Deniseasteele @petestory771 @dubsndoo millions of dollars though?
1340276775352463360 2020-12-19 20:44:19 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MockingjayMo @oklahomacaptive @JosephGKogutJr @perlmutations first off, I hold not affiliation to either party., Both have dirty hands. Democrats and republican leadership play down and dirty...otherwise, they would never rise to the top. You'd be a fool to think otherwise.
1340276200133029893 2020-12-19 20:42:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> @tazgecko @perlmutations and do you really believe this is new? I mean think about it. Yes, trump is an ass who should never have been elected, but the idea that he is somehow the cause of all this nonsense is silly.
1340275465077092352 2020-12-19 20:39:06 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Canadabuster if these people were gathering for a protest, it would be a-okay.
1340275066488156161 2020-12-19 20:37:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @cozy_dr_josie That's really good news! I'm happy for you and best of luck in your new position :)
1340274752750022657 2020-12-19 20:36:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @LisaMacVP @StMargBay they really are great :)
1340274394346774528 2020-12-19 20:34:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Bob_Loblaw1970 @Marie35396768 @nenshi out her in NS, there's been a spike in cases that pretty much all originated from someone travelling outside the province.
1340273916607156225 2020-12-19 20:32:57 +0800 <snowbunting42> @SabrinatheGood @ASoftstar one could always buy one of those gag toilet paper roll holders that plays a recorded message. It could scold the user for installing the #TP roll the correct way, lol.
1340273418495733762 2020-12-19 20:30:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> @samike88 let's not forget a health care system in shambles, at least here. yes, I am fully aware that is provincial, but an increase inf federal funding could go a long way. People are literally dying and no one cares (unless it's #Covid_19 )
1340095611161460736 2020-12-19 08:44:26 +0800 <snowbunting42> @oklahomacaptive @JosephGKogutJr @MockingjayMo @perlmutations you people are ridiculous. You bleat on and on about Russia...if someone really wanted to attack you, it would happen and you wouldn't even know it.
1340094802956853251 2020-12-19 08:41:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @commiefifi because they don't see the rest of the world as owing them something.

1340034983071805441 2020-12-19 04:43:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AOC and what are you doing to help make that happen?

1340033918213500929 2020-12-19 04:39:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @DomesticMarine my daughter's an indie writer who has gotten pretty popular. She is taking her pieces done from GoodReads (Amazon)etc. Amazon won't let her delete her retired titles...some bull explanation about "ISBN Issues") (not true)
1340033201922818050 2020-12-19 04:36:26 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JustMattMichael @SashaBeauloux @RockOnLiberals he must be fuming at what she's doing. whether she did it out of a sense of philanthropy or just to take a jab at him, I don't care. I'm just glad she's doing it.
1340032464937467913 2020-12-19 04:33:30 +0800 <snowbunting42> @bobguano You can even add #local stores to the list
1340032125920227329 2020-12-19 04:32:10 +0800 <snowbunting42> @GimbalLocke @jipley @amazonnews uh huh, and I have a lovely piece of swampland in #Florida I'd like to show you...
1340031716430364691 2020-12-19 04:30:32 +0800 <snowbunting42> @VitaVitaVita48 @CBSNews It also takes advantage of indie writers, prevents them form deleted retired titles and tries to say it can't because of "ISBN issues" ...bull-you-know-what
1340030704474877955 2020-12-19 04:26:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @a_place_n_time You can also add #local  businesses to the site if you live in the cities covered. I've added a few  to the #Halifax site

1340020798296367106 2020-12-19 03:47:09 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Braveheart_USA weird how the state with the highest population (39,512,223)- California  is still behind Texas and New York for covid cases.  https://t.co/WgbZ7qGQAD
1340019841894387712 2020-12-19 03:43:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> @numbers_truth @McLauri34721541 @Braveheart_USA How many of the cases were actually positive and truly form covid and not just "it looks like it:" Unless the bulk of those deaths were ACTUALLY positive cases, your stats mean nothing
1340019504173244419 2020-12-19 03:42:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @numbers_truth @Jeremy05749458 @McLauri34721541 @Braveheart_USA again, without a listing of the causes, your point is useless. America is a country with an aging population (boomers) it's only expected death rates would go up
1340019067709775875 2020-12-19 03:40:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @numbers_truth @McLauri34721541 @Braveheart_USA and? what are the causes of those deaths? how many suicides, people dying because they can't get health care to to covid restrictions, domestic violence, etc.  https://t.co/HgsUWcP3hD
1340017701973012481 2020-12-19 03:34:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MoralEthicsNow1 @Braveheart_USA @rising_serpent by that logic, because I know people who have had covid and been just fine, that means everyone else will be too  https://t.co/HgsUWcP3hD
1340017127860920320 2020-12-19 03:32:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> @EmmMacfarlane would you please cut the dramatics. These are the ACTUAL numbers. Hundreds of deaths my foot...  https://t.co/GT92f7Icgk Only 0.9 percent of cases are even considered critical. (and yes the site is a scientific one. It's updated daily and is used to make policy decisions)
1340015621225009154 2020-12-19 03:26:35 +0800 <snowbunting42> @inky_mark Just look at these examples of wait times. (cardiology) https://t.co/BhenU9g0Bq , neurology  https://t.co/h6bcXUpfZR  etc. #Canada #healthcare #NovaScotia

1340013293591773184 2020-12-19 03:17:20 +0800 <snowbunting42> and yet we are told the borders are closed...

Unless the CERB amount was at the same level they were getting on pogey ( EI) hoe did they explain the sudden bump in income at a time when may were being thrown out of work? did they think they were just getting a free windfall?
1339993420337713152 2020-12-19 01:58:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MissLadyRea @petestory771 @dubsndoo That's just common sense. there's no such thing as a free ride. My adult daughters both qualified but chose to move back home instead ( they didn't trust the government). It was a tight budget squeeze, but we made it work.
1339992568998866944 2020-12-19 01:54:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> @perlmutations oh for eff sake...the USA has been attacked by Russia since its Soviet days. As the saying goes, there's nothing new under the sun.
1339992122737487873 2020-12-19 01:53:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> @rb_rhodes @inky_mark It's elites everywhere. They play the peons off against each other.
1339991979644641281 2020-12-19 01:52:38 +0800 <snowbunting42> @petestory771 @dubsndoo it doesn't make any sense. the whole point of #CERB was to help those who had lost their income. How did these people suddenly have the money to pay it back by the millions?
1339958785989894145 2020-12-18 23:40:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Michell06017336 @theSnoopiest @martinm34060415 @thehill that's another reason corn is grown so widely. it's often used to manufacture high fructose corn syrup-that's so bad for you.
1339958520935051265 2020-12-18 23:39:41 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Michell06017336 @theSnoopiest @martinm34060415 @thehill Big agra has it's tentacles in there too. Factory style farming depletes soils, encourages mono culture, etc.  crop rotation and allowing fields to go "fallow" for a year get left in the dust.

1339941650383200261 2020-12-18 22:32:39 +0800 <snowbunting42> @BashCo_ @adamogardner @Crystamped @bopinion I'll ask my son. he's a bit of a techie...to be honest, I don't know what the hell he's even doing a lot of the time, lol
1339941293032697857 2020-12-18 22:31:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Michell06017336 @theSnoopiest @martinm34060415 @thehill I worked in the administration side of agriculture for several years.  It's all tied in with commodity pricing, crop value and even consumer choice. I hated working with soy...it's so genetically modified and that never sat right with me.
1339940701950386177 2020-12-18 22:28:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @BashCo_ @adamogardner @Crystamped @bopinion Thanks for the answer. I really don't know much about it, but one thing I have seen is there's dozens of online courses on offer that deal with blockchain. I have to wonder if there's much value in those.
1339924898983141377 2020-12-18 21:26:05 +0800 <snowbunting42> @GilNimni @Marie35396768 I hate the way it's being used to rationalize problems int he health care system here in #Canada. Wait times, doctor shortages etc. were here long before #covid19.
1339923739115401217 2020-12-18 21:21:28 +0800 <snowbunting42> @tcigsulli @TuckerCarlson my dad has a doctorate in education. Lots of people do. Did she buy her way in, the way a lot of elites do or did she actually do the work required?
1339923462094270464 2020-12-18 21:20:22 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AndyDaigle1 does ms. cortez have any actual scientific background? Not being snide, I just don't know. If she doesn't, then what makes her qualified for the position?
1339922618502266880 2020-12-18 21:17:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Michell06017336 @theSnoopiest @martinm34060415 @thehill The sad part is much of that is to "big agra" . Family farms are rapidly becoming a thing of the past. A lot of arable farmland is being used to raise corn for biofuel production, animal feed etc. It's a "heavy feeder" and requires large inputs of fertilizers, pesticides, etc.
1339921583075454977 2020-12-18 21:12:54 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Jhelmuth I'd like to see political leaders in every country be the FIRST to get the vaccine. It would show they have confidence in its safety
1339920251828523011 2020-12-18 21:07:37 +0800 <snowbunting42> @inky_mark mind you, a lot of Westerners are from here anyway. Heading out to Alberta etc. to try and find work is a way of life.
1339920081510404097 2020-12-18 21:06:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> @inky_mark try coming out to NS sometime. Our health care is in shambles, The doctors, nurses, cleaners dietary staff etc are doing their best, but it's got so many problems. The small towns and cities are really hurting economically. (1/2)
1339919171979681795 2020-12-18 21:03:19 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MickIrishMuslim I know it's not what it is, but I keep picturing a hacker down in their parent's, basement giggling with glee over what he or she did.

1339677171657433089 2020-12-18 05:01:42 +0800 <snowbunting42> @KeffKorvos @wwg1wga4evr who is supposed to have hacked these systems and why? If it happened, shouldn't solving that be the priority, not all this political quibbling I keep seeing in social media? I don't understand any of this at all.

1339668536164294658 2020-12-18 04:27:23 +0800 <snowbunting42> @VaughanPappy @CBCNews why is that always the answer to Liberals? Oh oh oh but they do...geeze, you sound like a three year old
1339646284098093056 2020-12-18 02:58:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> @globeandmail so now we're trying to protect #China?

1339633785919422466 2020-12-18 02:09:18 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CBCNews the irony of this is #protecting people who are considered "high risk" is being totted out as the reason for so many of these measures, yet they then turn around and make it hard for those people to see their doctors to treat the very disease that makes them high risk. #Covid_19
1339632879521951745 2020-12-18 02:05:42 +0800 <snowbunting42> @urcounsel @CBCNews we kept being told "we need to save spaces for #Covid_19  patients" ...why would that apply to specialties like oncology, rhuematology , neurology etc.?
1339632155085967360 2020-12-18 02:02:49 +0800 <snowbunting42> @hippyjoe1955 @CBCNews @TheBuffalo11 some of us have no choice. You're pretty privileged to be able to wait

1339630381155241984 2020-12-18 01:55:46 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Crystamped @bopinion I don't pretend to know much about it, but a while back, my brother gave my kids $100.00 bucks worth. He never told me how to access it, and when I did, it was gone. How does that happen ( he didn't take it)
1339629823765979137 2020-12-18 01:53:33 +0800 <snowbunting42> @melissawiebe @JaneDenton_CA @CBCToronto do you really think that if someone was going to do this you would even know about it, warning or not?
1339629246008893440 2020-12-18 01:51:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AlleyBillings @CBCNews I live out east in NS. Our health  care system was already facing some issues. Lack of doctors was one.
1339603430482931714 2020-12-18 00:08:41 +0800 <snowbunting42> @cgbrads @MarkGerretsen I'm sorry, but that still in no way justifies that #tax at this time.
1339602899962220546 2020-12-18 00:06:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CBCNews It's also impacting other areas as well, e.g.- #Rheumatology. These are current wait times in NS-over a year! Diseases like #lupus, #scleroderma, #sjogrens   https://t.co/B4jY3BAWJe
1339602266567880704 2020-12-18 00:04:03 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CBCNews These are wait times here in NS for men with possible #prostatecancer.   https://t.co/rlgGuvQ6xN
1339601425953771525 2020-12-18 00:00:43 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AlleyBillings @CBCNews I'm glad it worked well for you :) . I had to wait over six months for  a lymphoma biopsy and then treatment.
1339600911560110085 2020-12-17 23:58:40 +0800 <snowbunting42> @stonehe14411019 @ausgov @ScottMorrisonMP and guess what happened? said students decided to go out and get drunk, causing a flare up of #covid19. They're kids, and just like most kids, they don't always do what they should.
1339599755878395905 2020-12-17 23:54:05 +0800 <snowbunting42> @nshealth nice work...hold that carrot out.
1339598802903154693 2020-12-17 23:50:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Evelynne24 @MarkGerretsen I thought #trudeau was going to bring about electoral reform. Of course he can't, because if he did, he'd be turfed next #election.
1339598204585664518 2020-12-17 23:47:55 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MarkGerretsen @royh44 how can you look that little girl in the face and know that while you and yours will be comfortable and warm, food on your table, due to this tax, other families will go without? Do you really, honestly believe what you say?
1339597588580847621 2020-12-17 23:45:28 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Tyler52943242 @MarkGerretsen no one seems to know
1339596989906882564 2020-12-17 23:43:05 +0800 <snowbunting42> @fred_l_c @MarkGerretsen this is the worst time for this sort of crud. so many are struggling...maybe that's what the  #Trudeau and many in the #Liberal party really want?
1339596224144367617 2020-12-17 23:40:02 +0800 <snowbunting42> @droid1963 @MarkGerretsen maybe he and his party's ilk should start working for free...That's how we could recoup at least some of the expense.
1339595952227639297 2020-12-17 23:38:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> @FredHow02132661 @MarkGerretsen just in my own family, but our two adult daughters (uni. students) weren't able to find summer employment this year. That means we have to make our budget stretch, and thanks to measures like this, it's really hard.
1339595266723221505 2020-12-17 23:36:14 +0800 <snowbunting42> @cgbrads @MarkGerretsen even some die hard Liberals are fuming over this. I get the need to address climate change, but to impose that tax at a time when many are already struggling? Why couldn't it wait until things are a least a bit more stable?
1339594631189680129 2020-12-17 23:33:43 +0800 <snowbunting42> @REIMERholics @rm90276 @MarkGerretsen it's like the old shell game...what a bunch of grifters
1339593574661255176 2020-12-17 23:29:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MarkGerretsen And saying there won't be any left in government coffers means nothing. It will be spent on #Trudeaus pet projects. You don't sound like a fool...how can you keep on supporting him?
1339592997311135751 2020-12-17 23:27:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MarkGerretsen I don't believe you. Why bring this tax in now when people are struggling thanks to #COVID19 ? Even if people do get it back as a rebate, how will that help them keep food on the table now? How will that help a disabled person trying to get by on a pittance each month?
1339591253810286597 2020-12-17 23:20:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @NancySm19917303 @MarkGerretsen how about the civil servants who say they are at risk and have been at home since the pandemic stared, not working and still getting their full pay? My spouse works for DND, and that's what's been going on at the office-he went back in July, may of his office mates are still out
1339590393826930690 2020-12-17 23:16:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CooperLorne @MarkGerretsen it's just more of this...  https://t.co/7ULPuaQEFL
1339590064037265413 2020-12-17 23:15:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> @stevjo9 @MarkGerretsen It makes no sense. I don't drive-walk almost everywhere. yet I am paying for my supposed "carbon footprint" on groceries, heating fuel, etc. Meanwhile, the dollar store's full of plastic crap made by the poor people slaving away in a Chinese factory.Maybe we need to address THAT.
1339588377570504704 2020-12-17 23:08:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @q_enns @MarkGerretsen I could be wrong, but every time fuel prices go up, doesn't the amount of tax being paid also go up since it's a percentage of the price?
1339588079565168647 2020-12-17 23:07:41 +0800 <snowbunting42> @gord1351 @MarkGerretsen look at how much groceries have already gone up, and it's only going to get worse.
1339587840087261186 2020-12-17 23:06:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @DevinSmith1976 @MarkGerretsen It's not even the #Liberal party so much anymore- at least it has a couple of good ideas...it's #trudeau. He's completely out of touch.

1339586525319712774 2020-12-17 23:01:30 +0800 <snowbunting42> @david_lush @MarkGerretsen families are also trying to get by on less. My adult kids (students) are all at home, and our budget has had to stretch to accommodate everyone. We're pretty lucky, but others are really struggling.
1339585774577020932 2020-12-17 22:58:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MarkGerretsen I highly doubt any of it will end up back in the pockets of the public. To be fair though, this is pretty much par for the course with most taxes.
1339585297797922818 2020-12-17 22:56:37 +0800 <snowbunting42> @jitsiereveld @Daily_Express you as well. :)

1339580888443662338 2020-12-17 22:39:06 +0800 <snowbunting42> @jitsiereveld @Daily_Express they are BORN that way. It occurs in fetal development, often close to birth

1339441302891614210 2020-12-17 13:24:26 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CorruptPoliticz @Bret_Sears I'm not discounting those deaths as sad for their families, but if a 89 year old in renal failure who has a bad heart and other issues dies, blaming covid seems rather pointless.
1339439754769821696 2020-12-17 13:18:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Bret_Sears part of the issue could be the rise in obesity...one in four canadians are #obese, which is a risk factor for #covid  https://t.co/aHm1Zn9Kqh

1339435268156370947 2020-12-17 13:00:28 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ThatEricAlper none. why does their death hurt more than anyone else's?

1339281393596190726 2020-12-17 02:49:01 +0800 <snowbunting42> how  #ironic that the same people who took great delight in such phrases as "#boomer remover" re: #covid19 are now bleating that "we need to protect our #grandparents" . Do people only matter when they are related to you? Why do you suddenly care now?

1338953745699393538 2020-12-16 05:07:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Ray_vibezz take , for example, a guy I grew up with. He collects social assistance benefits and is also working as a tattoo artist under the table, making a quite a bit. This sort of thing is really common.

You don't drive, shop, own a business? You have no children, never use a park or walk on a outdoor trail? What do you do all day?

I have no problem helping people who are in need of some help, but it's galling to know that, while my family went without, others were scamming the system.

1338304106742636544 2020-12-14 10:05:38 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JerryGrundman @TimKennedyMMA honestly, why should anyone. Mr. Gates may or may not be a good man, but he has no business discussing anything medical. He is not qualified. A first year biology major would give a more informed opinion.

They looked at her income, decided she didn't qualify for the amount she asked for, and they are acting accordingly.
1338172639563616260 2020-12-14 01:23:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MrMichaelBurkes In all seriousness, the same laws that protect the rights of #ANTIFA to protest also protect the #rights of others to do the same.

1337757346022436864 2020-12-12 21:53:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @J71860312 @CBCPEI I'm wondering if she's set up a "go fund me" account to help pay for her "mistake". I hope she hasn't.
1337756461963874304 2020-12-12 21:49:29 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CBCPEI no offence intended to her, but this really is her own fault. Why did she think she qualified for so much? I expect she's hoping for sympathy and maybe even has a Go Fund Me to pay for her "mistake"

1337425767031037954 2020-12-11 23:55:25 +0800 <snowbunting42> @warzombie3701 @NicolasT_AT @alt_dont @latimes I really do feel that there are cases where there should never be a possibility of parole.
1337425608318578689 2020-12-11 23:54:47 +0800 <snowbunting42> @warzombie3701 @NicolasT_AT @alt_dont @latimes ah, I see. The question then becomes who should the penal system treat someone who is a threat to society. Up here, we don't have the death penalty, but we do have people who should never be allowed out of prison ( Paul Bernardo comes to mind) (1/2)
1337421154663981056 2020-12-11 23:37:06 +0800 <snowbunting42> @warzombie3701 @NicolasT_AT @alt_dont @latimes a victim of what, exactly?
1337420940859346945 2020-12-11 23:36:15 +0800 <snowbunting42> @HealthNS @IWKHealthCentre thanks for the prompt reply :), but I'm not really talking about visitors. I was in the ER the other day. without my daughter ( she helps "hear" for me) I missed a lot of what was being said. btw, thank you for all you're doing. I really do appreciate it.
1337390216437510144 2020-12-11 21:34:09 +0800 <snowbunting42> support your independent #bookstore today! #indie
1337389713058131968 2020-12-11 21:32:09 +0800 <snowbunting42> like I said above...fat, orange and his mouth is almost always open. At least my #donald is quiet, lol
1337389375047524354 2020-12-11 21:30:49 +0800 <snowbunting42> @coreydd97 @The_Antipodean_ @realDonaldTrump Being honest, I have no use for #trump and would like for him to go away, but I don't like the idea that someone would tell people how to vote. Shouldn't it up to their individual conscience?
1337388578872016896 2020-12-11 21:27:39 +0800 <snowbunting42> Unlike the real #trump, my #Donald doesn't like having his photo taken, but this guy looks just like him.  https://t.co/7wul5dqTor

1337387210065244160 2020-12-11 21:22:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> I'm admittedly a "#bird #nerd" , but I also have a aquarium with an assortment of #fish. One is named "#Donald" in honour of #trump. Why? Because, like the person he;s named for, he's fat, #orange and has a big mouth that's always open, lol.
1337386275679170561 2020-12-11 21:18:30 +0800 <snowbunting42> @coreydd97 @The_Antipodean_ @realDonaldTrump You're right. It should be "persons". Good catch :)
1337385985513025540 2020-12-11 21:17:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> I think to some, #twitter is just a popularity contest and ego feed. Is that why #trump was so eager to gather followers?
1337385008672231429 2020-12-11 21:13:28 +0800 <snowbunting42> re: Brandon Bernard  I hate what he did, but I also don't believe in state sanctioned murder.
1337384433633124354 2020-12-11 21:11:11 +0800 <snowbunting42> @latimes when you get right down to it, isn't the #DeathPenalty  state sanctioned #murder? The only viable argument I can see for it is it would keep a person from ever committing another #crime, but wouldn't a life sentence with no #parole accomplish the same end?
1337383566406279170 2020-12-11 21:07:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @NicolasT_AT @alt_dont @latimes there's criminals I would love to see gone from he face of the earth for what they have done, but I don't believe in state sanctioned murder. My daughter just submitted a research paper on this topic- focused on an execution in Japan of a man who may well have been innocent.
1337382545227472896 2020-12-11 21:03:40 +0800 <snowbunting42> Look at the difference between the way #men and #women are treated in the penal system. Equal my foot! I'm #female,  and that's incredibly patronizing. part of #womenempowerment is taking responsibility for ourselves.
1337380555290259465 2020-12-11 20:55:46 +0800 <snowbunting42> @NicolasT_AT @alt_dont @latimes I don't think this man should have been executed ( I think the death penalty is wrong) but I dont like the way people are trying to frame this guy as some sort of victim either.
1337378565327900672 2020-12-11 20:47:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> @BuckeyeinFL13 @MilHistNow as far as I know it does. There were the red red crescent and red lion as well.

Both are disabled, but she inspires them to keep going.
1337377343459954691 2020-12-11 20:43:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AHMalcolm Hitler also was a person of the year
1337377050945089538 2020-12-11 20:41:50 +0800 <snowbunting42> @The_Antipodean_ @realDonaldTrump I hate trump too, but this really isn't a measure of someone's capability. After all, Hitler is a former person of the year
1337376525763620874 2020-12-11 20:39:45 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MaajidNawaz fwiw, Hitler was a person of the year way back when
1337376099546894337 2020-12-11 20:38:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> @HealthNS @IWKHealthCentre I would like to bring up something. I know why hospitals are asking people to come on their own, but if you;re special needs, hearing impaired ( like me) you need someone with you when you are seen in the ER. Is it possible to make allowances for that?
1337375415229419521 2020-12-11 20:35:20 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MavenOfMayhem we do this each year too. one year, my aunt spent the holidays with us. We did our usual joke gift labels...she didn't know what the heck was going on when she got a gift from #DarthVader (he may be an evil guy, but he gives nice gifts, lol)
1337374841196978181 2020-12-11 20:33:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> @MavenOfMayhem My oldest identifies as asexual. She has a hard go sometimes. Some people are very cruel. I don't understand why they think it's even any of their business. It's like they think she's "broken" and needs to be fixed.
1337372378725306370 2020-12-11 20:23:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AlyAlyOutnFree I hope you'll say it with pride. Sounds like you've followed  a tough road that takes so much #courage! Never let anyone tell you differently.
1337369838319243264 2020-12-11 20:13:11 +0800 <snowbunting42> @HarnettJordan @mattletiss7 in the example I gave, those people have already waited a year or more for these cardiac services. Adding more time means they may not get the treatment they need.
1337369512363102208 2020-12-11 20:11:53 +0800 <snowbunting42> @HarnettJordan @mattletiss7 I don;t know about the NHS, but here in Canada,m our health care system was already struggling. Everyone is really trying to make the best of it, nut these wait times were already awful This is an example, and it would be this way, covid19 or not- https://t.co/BhenU9g0Bq
1337368995863924736 2020-12-11 20:09:50 +0800 <snowbunting42> @scubasteve1414 @mattletiss7 here in Canada, my province's health care system was already struggling, and while I know everyone is doing their best to cope with a bad situation, covid19 has really highlighted its deficiencies. (eg. of wait times here already) https://t.co/BhenU9g0Bq
1337368078410244096 2020-12-11 20:06:11 +0800 <snowbunting42> @mattletiss7 it's also been a hard got or those of us who are immunocomprimised. My #doctors have gone above and beyond trying to make #telephone appointments work, but the thing they don't, not really.
1337154040782843911 2020-12-11 05:55:41 +0800 <snowbunting42> @News24 While I am in no way condoning this man's death , what about the women he hurt? Do they not matter?
1337153689971286022 2020-12-11 05:54:17 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JesseReshetylo a plumber, #electrician etc. will always be in demand. When your toilet's overflowing, you call a #plumber not a professor,lol
1337153349960015872 2020-12-11 05:52:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> @IanKielly when I see sports celebrities and entertainers held to the same standard i will happily come on board. The same holds true for companies like #Amazon
1337129709600174080 2020-12-11 04:19:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JesseReshetylo trades training, yes. useless degrees like"gender studies" no way.
1337128753630126080 2020-12-11 04:15:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JSiculli @mat_schmaltz I highly suggest you do some research into "peace keeping" it's not what you think. The days of the blue helmets are long gone
1337128327799316480 2020-12-11 04:13:30 +0800 <snowbunting42> @mat_schmaltz why would they need to train here anyway? northern #china experiences winter conditions each year

Anyone I have ever met from #China has been friendly, kind and a lot fo fun, especially its #seniors. . I can't say the same for the #Chinese government.
1337052067073040387 2020-12-10 23:10:28 +0800 <snowbunting42> A question to all those who spout "eat the #rich" type rhetoric. Do you also say the same thing to #sports celebrities, entertainers, and the #corporate execs of companies that you like? (e.g.-#Apple, #Amazon)? If not, you're a big #fat hypocrite :)
1337039348307529733 2020-12-10 22:19:56 +0800 <snowbunting42> If you're an #event organizer, here's a tip. If you are postponing an expo, etc. to 2022, don't list the businesses that will be participating, especially if they are small/ local. there's a good chance they will be gone by then. #eventbrite #COVID19
1337027855365058565 2020-12-10 21:34:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TRE45ON__TRUMP What about #Amazon? My daughter is an indie writer, and has used the platform for several years. It's gobbling up independent publishers/sites hand over fist. She's lucky that she's gained enough popularity that she doesn't need it anymore, but what about those just starting out?
1337027223304466433 2020-12-10 21:31:45 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AP_Politics meh, if he's got nothing to hide, nothing will be found
1337026892327759880 2020-12-10 21:30:26 +0800 <snowbunting42> @SeanRos26250158 @macjbby I expect it's got more to do with the government realizing the program at least in its original form, is not sustainable. To be fair to #trudeau, he had to act quickly, but there's no such thing as a fee lunch. Sooner or later, someone has to pay the bill.
1337026194068402180 2020-12-10 21:27:40 +0800 <snowbunting42> @kpac_15 my two older daughters qualified to get it, but after some discussion, they decided not to apply. they moved home, and we've been doing our best to make the budget stretch. They were worried that what was "free" now would be paid back later (with a hefty tax bill to boot)
1337025370638479360 2020-12-10 21:24:23 +0800 <snowbunting42> @mamafax @BrianKrzyzaniak @bejames1972 again, just because someone says something you don't like doesn't make them a #bot. some people actually have a life and don't need to spend all day on social media feeding their ego by collecting followers. #canada
1337024954618011648 2020-12-10 21:22:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @mamafax @mordicaioshea @bejames1972 @JustinTrudeau @MaximeBernier @erinotoole that's right, anyone you don't agree with MUST be a bot
1337024584739147777 2020-12-10 21:21:16 +0800 <snowbunting42> @mordicaioshea @bejames1972 @JustinTrudeau @MaximeBernier @erinotoole I just find it disgusting that the lives of these men are used as a bargaining chip. They're people, not pawns.
1337024033431359489 2020-12-10 21:19:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Bettere36733657 @bejames1972 @JustinTrudeau she had a reputation for being "a town bicycle" of sorts.
1337008905558368258 2020-12-10 20:18:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> I know this is rude, but I'm just going to say it...#scleroderma flares suck
1336671146448662530 2020-12-09 21:56:50 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AltMorgans @Josh_Cranfield @bro_no_u @Gary80SuzukiRM Again, that's not the point. Many don't know e.g.-many don't know what Aspartame is, but it's included on ingredient lists so people can decide whether or not they wish to assume the risk of consuming it (it's linked to several forms of cancer)
1336670355713355778 2020-12-09 21:53:41 +0800 <snowbunting42> @basementvegan @michaelmina_lab yeah, Harvard doesn't mean much anymore. I'd actually trust research form another institution over them seeing as one can pay to get in ahead of the rest,  pay for grades etc.
1336669918666907652 2020-12-09 21:51:57 +0800 <snowbunting42> @SueC00K Nature published similar findings, but no one wants to hear that.
1336669130934657028 2020-12-09 21:48:49 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AltMorgans @Josh_Cranfield @bro_no_u @Gary80SuzukiRM if you would, you're a fool

1336415505196994563 2020-12-09 05:01:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Notte510 @AltMorgans @Gary80SuzukiRM @BorisJohnson I do hope it will work for you. I can't get it even if I wanted to.
1336414862344400899 2020-12-09 04:58:27 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Bear1Kuma @Xtreme20X @BorisJohnson you could also try this site. it;s updated daily, and you can check each country for it's own data  https://t.co/HgsUWcP3hD
1336414519875268613 2020-12-09 04:57:05 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ineedmoretoys @IMcgregor8 @mamachildie @_dries_v @BorisJohnson so you really trust a vaccine that was developed, tested and put on the market in about eight months when the usual cycle is five to ten years?
1336412921371488256 2020-12-09 04:50:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Benjtweet19 @giftgalleries @heyflower80 @BorisJohnson I'm one of those who cant get the vaccine. My immune system is effectively shut down because of meds. I take.
1336412515958476808 2020-12-09 04:49:07 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Benjtweet19 @IamRichyP1 @BorisJohnson the testing time has been far too short. with most drugs/ vaccines it's years, not months. I really don't think there; any grand conspiracy beyond drug companies seeing a chance to get some money and of course, they went after it.
1336412040467001345 2020-12-09 04:47:14 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Notte510 @AltMorgans @Gary80SuzukiRM @BorisJohnson I don't think there's any conspiracy other than a chance to make quite a bit of money. I am just worried the vaccine was rushed to market. Would you take a new drug that had only undergone a few months of testing to make sure it was safe as well as effective?
1336411599431753728 2020-12-09 04:45:29 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AltMorgans @Josh_Cranfield @bro_no_u @Gary80SuzukiRM I'm sorry, but that is not acceptable.
1336411389552963584 2020-12-09 04:44:39 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Gary80SuzukiRM @BorisJohnson considering how the development cycle for most drugs/vaccine to get to market is years, not a few months, I'm leery, not because I think there's a conspiracy, I just don't think it was adequately tested.
1336410470769684481 2020-12-09 04:41:00 +0800 <snowbunting42> @GoFlyers73 @bighaireecoo @BorisJohnson agreed. the normal development cycle is between six and ten years, not a few months
1336410092082778118 2020-12-09 04:39:29 +0800 <snowbunting42> @JamesSi41932301 @bighaireecoo @BorisJohnson honestly, I think it really comes down to big pharma saw an opportunity to make some money and they went after it, whole hog.
1336409199547387908 2020-12-09 04:35:57 +0800 <snowbunting42> @enemy88_ @bighaireecoo @BorisJohnson the rules surrounding #drug trials were relaxed in the 80's/90's so drugs to treat #HIV reach the market faster. people were desperate/ dying. The unintended outcome was drugs that should have been better tested ( e.g.-Seldane, VIoxx) were released early and people got sick
1336407878840750080 2020-12-09 04:30:42 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Istabraq28 @BorisJohnson how would thy even know. the vaccine hasn't even existed for a year

1335119344213356545 2020-12-05 15:10:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @simmsy501 @jumbo57937410 @justin_hart @GavinNewsom @ericgarcetti what is really scary is how corps like Amazon buy up indie author sites like Goodreads and then censor what they sell.

1335117525684719616 2020-12-05 15:03:18 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ComfortablySmug look at what Amazon has done to indie authors...and the don't even see it
1335115889805496323 2020-12-05 14:56:48 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ScarlettFrost @AoifeHazen and yet people keep on spending money on the latest iPhone or Amazon crap
1335036508076711936 2020-12-05 09:41:21 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AoifeHazen jealous much? Every time I hear someone as rabid about this as you, it's always smacks of envy.
1335007974188789760 2020-12-05 07:47:58 +0800 <snowbunting42> @nsgov according to studies published in Nature, asymptomatic spread may not be as important factor as was once thought. If this is true, will health policy adapt? (source: https://t.co/Pq8H9VEJdC )
1335006896022052864 2020-12-05 07:43:41 +0800 <snowbunting42> @BjrnIro23895119 @toddred1234 @AoifeHazen many of these social programs have already been gutted. I know you were trying to explain why it would be a good thing, but all you did was demonstrate why it won't work.
1335006487106752517 2020-12-05 07:42:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> @AoifeHazen @JaredJConway Do you really think billionaires will be happy to fund this? They'll just do what they always have. Pick p stakes and move on to places with a tax system that suits them better. After all, they didn't get rich by having a social conscience.
1335006028191199241 2020-12-05 07:40:14 +0800 <snowbunting42> @robotcca @AdrianG008 @AoifeHazen Meh, the ones you think will help fund this( wealthy, corporations) will just pick p and leave. After all, why wouldn't they? They didn't get rich by giving their money away.

1335004470783193088 2020-12-05 07:34:03 +0800 <snowbunting42> @BjrnIro23895119 @toddred1234 @AoifeHazen ever heard the saying "there's no such thing as a free lunch". Someone will have to pay for it, and the easy targets? Social programs.
1335004016657494016 2020-12-05 07:32:15 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Sarah_Colero @AoifeHazen As a #disabled person, I find it degrading.  I want to work and be a productive member of society. I have lot to give. What I need is the tools to help, not a pat on the head and a handout.

1334869266689089539 2020-12-04 22:36:48 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TorontoStar I expect there's also a significant number who are #disabled and who need frequent contact with the #healthcare system. How much are do people who are dependent on a #disability allowance  getting nowadays anyway?
1334868529443704835 2020-12-04 22:33:52 +0800 <snowbunting42> @jyangstar The question becomes "why". Is this due to factors in the community or ones that are external?
1334867902705627141 2020-12-04 22:31:23 +0800 <snowbunting42> that's too #funny! #Twitter thinks this sign is "potentially #sensitive content"!  I guess if you are Karen or Hank you might find this upsetting...except, it was from a TV show called "Corner #Gas"

1334807356170006532 2020-12-04 18:30:47 +0800 <snowbunting42> @PapaGlider @49Berserker @LibQn32 @briebriejoy ah, I see. I find American politics to be very confusing. Nothing is ever as it seems.
1334806986781827073 2020-12-04 18:29:19 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Savion We legalized it up here. I have no issue with weed use ( I use it myself) but then the #government got involved. You can just guess what that led to. It's just another #tax grab, and no one seems to know where the money is going.
1334806030425927680 2020-12-04 18:25:31 +0800 <snowbunting42> @WaveGawd6 I saw the lede and thought it was an "#Onion " article. I understand the idea of trying to take ownership of a phrase and make it mean something #positive, but to me, this is going too far.

1334802876351307776 2020-12-04 18:12:59 +0800 <snowbunting42> #boomers again ? The cry that we "have to protect out #seniors!"all while secretly despising them. Remember just how funny some thought #boomerremover was when #COVID19  first hit?
1334601159332474881 2020-12-04 04:51:26 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Laurie_McNelles so would you like to take some away from First Nations, disabled people, the food bank?
1334600606925926400 2020-12-04 04:49:15 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ruthzowdu so are you saying black people can't be autistic, don't have health issues, don't use food banks, don't get cancer etc. Charities that aid in those areas help everyone.
1334600228624797698 2020-12-04 04:47:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Energized will not support any org that is only focused on one race. I don't care what race it is.

1334599801523015680 2020-12-04 04:46:03 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ssimmarr @CBCAlerts depending on the NFP. Most NFPs are subject to annual audits. A few of the larger ones are able to get around them
1334599598019637251 2020-12-04 04:45:14 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ManfromOntario @CBCAlerts I can't make a monetary donation so I try and volunteer instead
1334599429496705029 2020-12-04 04:44:34 +0800 <snowbunting42> @CBCAlerts and? how much goes to first nations, disabled, people with cancer, etc. I will not support ANY charity that only aids one race
1334504931060047874 2020-12-03 22:29:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> A shout out to all the front line #healthcare workers, #hospital cleaning staff etc. You guys rock! #COVIDー19
1334465062447222786 2020-12-03 19:50:38 +0800 <snowbunting42> @KGPatrice When the unis. here closed down she was still working and she ended up being essentially stranded here. We asked her to come and stay with our family-I didn't want her to be all alone. She was really missing her mom and family.
1334463194895683586 2020-12-03 19:43:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @Yem_xX who is he anyway?
1334462613695180800 2020-12-03 19:40:54 +0800 <snowbunting42> @S_Johnson_ Okay, maybe I am completely out of the loop, but who the heck is this guy anyway?
1334462225986318337 2020-12-03 19:39:22 +0800 <snowbunting42> @KGPatrice If other people from Jamaica are anything like my daughter's friend, they are both tough and kind. They also have a great sense of humour. She's a full time uni. student with top grades and also a nurse working with dementia patients.
1334334595303682048 2020-12-03 11:12:12 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ahh_monkey @no_silenced @nytimes Good public health policy is based on quality, unbiased information. You have to admit, that can be hard to get sometimes.
1334331046104543234 2020-12-03 10:58:06 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TheGISDiva and patients being left in the hall is de rigguer at most hospitals, at least here
1334330821122121728 2020-12-03 10:57:13 +0800 <snowbunting42> @TheGISDiva the article states “We are currently caring for 10 patients in our Alternate Care Site,” Renown said in an e-mailed response to the Reno Gazette Journal. “These patients are clinically stable or improving, and do not require critical care.”
1334327328709685250 2020-12-03 10:43:20 +0800 <snowbunting42> @WSurviror @Mikel_Jollett you mean the latest incantation of the brownshirts?
1334212953227268096 2020-12-03 03:08:51 +0800 <snowbunting42> @ReutersScience maybe it's really just a large phallic symbol? Overcompensating, anyone?
1334073341859291136 2020-12-02 17:54:05 +0800 <snowbunting42> I realize that many kids who bully others are lashing out at other factors in their life, but that doesn't excuse their behaviour. For her to go back to school the next day and see him right back in the classroom snickering at her after she was hurt was ridiculous,
1334073339908911106 2020-12-02 17:54:04 +0800 <snowbunting42> As the parent to a child who was the victim of a #bully in one of your schools, I can tell you that the #support provided to her was minimal, while all the retention was paid to the kid who physicality assaulted her. why?
1334071719443779586 2020-12-02 17:47:38 +0800 <snowbunting42> @HRCE_NS  re: #bullying in #schools. why is calling #police not included as a last resort? If it was an adult workplace, many forms of bullying would be considered assault/ harassment, Why is this same standard no applied, at least wit older #students?
1333849027557912576 2020-12-02 03:02:44 +0800 <snowbunting42> #Covid19 has hit a lot of not for profits hard. They need all the help they can get.
