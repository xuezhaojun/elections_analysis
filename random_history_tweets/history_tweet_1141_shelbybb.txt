1338681205932384256 2020-12-15 11:04:05 +0800 <shelbybb> The ONLY thing that Geraldo said that was correct, was that the GOP will continue to "fight" for trump until he says "The election is over - I lost.)    Hey, that does sound a lot like a wonna-be dictator. 🤔
1338679611954253826 2020-12-15 10:57:45 +0800 <shelbybb> It is such a farce! Nobody gives a crap what you say or don't say. Wasn't it O'Reilly that made that up a few years ago? Sounds like something he'd start a fight over.  Lord, there is NO maturity in the GOP or @FoxNews - NONE  HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO ALL!  🎅👼🌙🥂🧹🥳🧙❄️🎉🕎

1332699063339380737 2020-11-28 22:53:11 +0800 <shelbybb> I have always been drawn to small villages but never lived in one. Now I do, sorta. It's right by a big city but I have everything I need within walking distance and yes, I know the "baker". Love walks in the park across the street. Just  a small change has took years off my life
1332695289090748417 2020-11-28 22:38:11 +0800 <shelbybb> "I give thanks repeatedly" Yep, that's the answer right there. ☺️

1332449527975071746 2020-11-28 06:21:37 +0800 <shelbybb> @JoyceHutchens3 Does anyone understand that was said in 1976, very drunk and very high. But if you're still shocked, that's ok.
1332448880076738561 2020-11-28 06:19:03 +0800 <shelbybb> I heard the same thing. Stay at home! That'll show them.

1316573169206079488 2020-10-15 10:54:38 +0800 <shelbybb> Just speaking for the area where I live I saw three little trump signs. There are a lot of former republicans around here. He killed the GOP with the help of the GOP in the Senate and Congress.

1316569617893122048 2020-10-15 10:40:32 +0800 <shelbybb> When you are standing in line for hours to vote remember those government officials that have made it that hard to vote. This is 2020 there is NO reason this should be happening except to try and steel elections like GA. Gov. did. 💙🇺🇸🌊👍  Demand voter reform!
1316567778569183235 2020-10-15 10:33:13 +0800 <shelbybb> You are disliked Linds because you're a jerk and that just doesn't sit well in Southern states.

1313665449637433350 2020-10-07 10:20:24 +0800 <shelbybb> Louder now! Lets all the people in the back feel your breath. Let's show America that we can get all God's children infected at one time. Then we must pray for the hospitals so they will know where to take us so we can get the "trump three-day medical cure special." u need $$$$$

1313278959208067074 2020-10-06 08:44:38 +0800 <shelbybb> Since all of you MAGA types really hate @CNN then why does it matter what they say. They are progressive and so are their audience, so why do you care what they say?  Unless maybe YOU are the ones LYING! 😝  We can go as low as you want to go! 😛
1313275105653522432 2020-10-06 08:29:19 +0800 <shelbybb> I really can't believe anyone would hear anything new at this point that would sway their vote. Sorta makes me mad to hear people say "I'm still undecided" - if you're really undecided now you got big problems assimilating information.
1313249064339812352 2020-10-06 06:45:50 +0800 <shelbybb> Thank God he's out of the hospital so the REAL sick people there can have some peace and quiet. I pray for their recovery from this nightmare. 🙏  We Won't Back Down 🌊🇺🇸💙🌊🇺🇸💙🌊🇺🇸💙🌊🇺🇸

1312915678568099841 2020-10-05 08:41:05 +0800 <shelbybb> @bryanbehar He made a mockery of all the brave patients that lost their battle, (2000,000O plus). All the families that have suffered and watched love ones die, everything to him is a joke. I plan to show him what I think of his jokes and lack of compassion on Nov.3 if not sooner.
1312913847804735488 2020-10-05 08:33:48 +0800 <shelbybb> #WalterReedMedicalCenter has showed very little concern for the many ill patients in their care. VERY disappointed in their actions!

1312452861393956867 2020-10-04 02:02:01 +0800 <shelbybb> NEVER forget who trump really is. He has NOT cared one bit about the MILLIONS of people he has effected.  He doesn't care and I don't care about him. 😡

1312421598440419328 2020-10-03 23:57:47 +0800 <shelbybb> Another lie??? How shocking 😳
1312421440495456256 2020-10-03 23:57:09 +0800 <shelbybb> Because he's on the TrumpTrain. trump wouldn't have it any other way. He only works with liars.
1312419511803539463 2020-10-03 23:49:29 +0800 <shelbybb> ACB and "beer drinker" have NO confidence that they would be good for the job. They have to cheat to win, plain and simple. If they truly thought they could be fair they would have preferred to have a non-biased vote not a rigged one. Speaks volumes as to who they are.
1312417212154683396 2020-10-03 23:40:21 +0800 <shelbybb> I completely agree! ACB really showed her true character by preforming at the "Republican show" - Not respectful, cool or classy. She saw life long dollar marks just like the other drunk he appointed. Disgusting!
1312414894348787714 2020-10-03 23:31:08 +0800 <shelbybb> P!NK is a one of a kind! I'm so thrilled to have seen her several times in concert. There is NO concert better than hers! I really hope I'll see her again one day.    Love u 2 Keith 😛

1312370664620216320 2020-10-03 20:35:23 +0800 <shelbybb> @ananavarro They are so young and stupid.
1312224574310961152 2020-10-03 10:54:53 +0800 <shelbybb> You reap what you sow. There was NO reason to have this women pushed through so quickly (and she knew it) so now in addition to many adults, she has put her many children in harms way also. EGO is a bad thing.
1312205574575067136 2020-10-03 09:39:23 +0800 <shelbybb> Let me guess....a republican event? Old white men, blonde women and no mask. that about says it all. 👍
1312204272033951749 2020-10-03 09:34:12 +0800 <shelbybb> Only the little people wear mask - right Ivanka? You're just above everything - right sweetie? Well, until daddy dies. That might change everything.  Still got our eye on Nov. 3, 2020 🇺🇸🙏💙👍🌊😎🇺🇸🙏💙👍🌊😎🇺🇸🙏💙👍🌊😎🇺🇸💙

1312178120397520898 2020-10-03 07:50:17 +0800 <shelbybb> I am heartbroken at what your family is going through. 💔   All you crying MAGA's look at these pictures and think of all the families that have gone through this because trump chose his EGO instead of safety for Americans.
1312175150763175941 2020-10-03 07:38:29 +0800 <shelbybb> And is anyone surprised??? The GOP are who they are! NEVER let your guard down. They are disgusting! Send your "thoughts and prayers" to Americans that deserve them not the man who created the problem!
1312174503565254656 2020-10-03 07:35:55 +0800 <shelbybb> @mercedesschlapp - Over 200,000 Americans are dead and millions infected and NOW you want to put "politics aside"? I bet you do. Well it doesn't work that way. We have been begging trump for months to tell everyone to wear a mask but he played politics and this was his choice.

1312138339810566144 2020-10-03 05:12:13 +0800 <shelbybb> @FoxNews is saying the EXACT same thing the UK said about Boris until he went into intensive care and then they couldn't spin quit as much but they tried. The truth finally came out when he was released from hospital. TRUTH is not high on the list for politics especially the GOP!
1312132914516160516 2020-10-03 04:50:39 +0800 <shelbybb> How can you not love Freddie? What a #BravesMoment. #ULTRAMoment via @MichelobUltra

1312128233404465152 2020-10-03 04:32:03 +0800 <shelbybb> @realDonaldTrump Your shinning new nominee A C Barrett doesn't look too smart to me. Why would she drag her kids to an event with no masks, during a worldwide pandemic, to show off in front of America's stupidest politicians. Did you think for a second they cared about you? SAD
1312122782294044672 2020-10-03 04:10:24 +0800 <shelbybb> @realDonaldTrump You deserve everything that is coming your way. Bring it on....EVERY BIT OF IT!
1312121064609050625 2020-10-03 04:03:34 +0800 <shelbybb> So true!!! He did nothing but harass her and put out ENDLESS FAKE accusations on her health. What goes around, comes around trumpy!!!!!
1312099322859712514 2020-10-03 02:37:10 +0800 <shelbybb> But if he dies before that....oh well, shit happens. He's made my life hell for years.
