Keep working on it, because I always believe: ‚Äú there is a better way‚Äù. What just happened in the rigged Election is a historical travesty for this Country.
1338240044671242241 2020-12-14 05:51:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Not_a_game__ I do believe, I‚Äôve seen that statement several times on other Lefty accounts. That‚Äôs standard procedure for them to repeat a lie often enough to believe it. Their recent big lie of ‚Äú no  evidence of any fraud‚Äù has been the biggest WHOPPER lately. Thanks for clarifying. üëç
1338237700030099457 2020-12-14 05:41:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Not_a_game__ My statement or Hillary‚Äôs? I haven‚Äôt looked around Twit to much today...

1338213462736977922 2020-12-14 04:05:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Quite surprising eh?
1338202794688356352 2020-12-14 03:23:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow I‚Äôve always been inspired by the Powerball tickets. Your ticket is unique. The winning numbers are unique. I don‚Äôt think anyone has cashed in a 500 million dollar Fraudulent ticket. ( could the little balls be rigged? Another issue.)
1338200317276508161 2020-12-14 03:13:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GregReports Rest assured, you are not alone. At this point, count on paper. Let it take a week. Television do it only for ratings! Seal the paper tallies with an old fashioned Wax Seal. It needs a complete restart.
1338199559470661634 2020-12-14 03:10:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Honestly, I used to have great hope for a Dominion type system. However when you get a total radical  communist like Eric Coomer stating on the record that he can fix it at midnight, with the flip of switch, it breaks the link of the chain. It‚Äôs over.
1338198781049753600 2020-12-14 03:07:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Amen!

1338196793180372992 2020-12-14 02:59:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown @realDonaldTrump @X4Rose Figure of speech, to outline a possibility. If such &amp; such wins, then this is likely to occur, type of statement. I thought it was well stated &amp; predictive. Trump‚Äôs old tweets have been VERY predictive.
1338195245251489792 2020-12-14 02:53:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He probably did win! Who is EVER going to trust ELECTRONIC Voting again?
1338193689395412992 2020-12-14 02:46:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ORGANlCROBOT @WordSpkr Correct.
1338192053662990336 2020-12-14 02:40:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Trin20201 Was it on TV? Was it recorded, as I would like to go back &amp; watch? Trump answered perfectly nonetheless as it was a typing partisan hack trying to ask a loaded ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù question. The Democrats should just call themselves ‚Äú The Gotcha Party‚Äù, it‚Äôs all they do.

1337241028319821824 2020-12-11 11:41:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @_Love_Anon Telegraph/Telegram...love it.
1337240748173889539 2020-12-11 11:40:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @War_HammerTime We were just talking a short while about moves. It‚Äôs all moves &amp; countermoves. The ones I have examined seem to favor Trump. Your Plan B is one viable option.
1337232464557662210 2020-12-11 11:07:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> We live in very interesting times as this whole Election issue is going to force all members of the Supreme Court to sh!t or get off of the pot. Trump has them also, because if they are compromised, they HAVE to show their hand. Will their loyalty be to China or US? Choose wisely
1337230520808194048 2020-12-11 10:59:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @littlehummer True. I use these terms for sake of simplicity.
1337230230243577856 2020-12-11 10:58:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RCult45 Of course. RINO‚Äôs live. The whole Uniparty is another issue to be dealt with. The Federal Elections Commission is a private corporation restricting any other Parties. I wasn‚Äôt a Ralph Nader supporter, but he railed against this.
1337229381425500160 2020-12-11 10:55:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TX_Justus I ran out of characters. Q would always say look here not there. As if: look to China, not Russia like Schiff bitched about...following along same lines..,Media looked at Qanon but missed the EO‚Äôs If that is the case, then brilliant strategy.
1337228487753564161 2020-12-11 10:51:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Bubbavonzipper I used to have a joke. What do you call a thug in a suit? A thug! ( ...that‚Äôs what they are.)

1337226196891779077 2020-12-11 10:42:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Democrats are nothing more than an Organized Crime Syndicate.
1337225325932027904 2020-12-11 10:38:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TX_Justus I also believe a lot of Q‚Äôs questions, writings, drops &amp; proofs are embodied in the EO‚Äôs. Call those ultimate Proofs if you will. The Media got fooled again by ‚Äòaccusing Qanon of being (?), but failed to see the EO‚Äôs. Much now to their peril.
1337223988968243202 2020-12-11 10:33:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Yup!
1337221489620209664 2020-12-11 10:23:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> A big problem is the Media/Big Tech suppressed all this evidence before the Election. That unto itself is Election Interference. They were warned not to, but couldn‚Äôt help themselves. They are now complicit under EO2018. Too bad. Too sad.
1337220279957778434 2020-12-11 10:18:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @War_HammerTime Even if he doesn‚Äôt, he got permits to build Skyscrapers. That takes years &amp; years of planning &amp; setbacks &amp; changes. Always fighting pissants in City Hall. Not only that, he had the ‚Äòvision‚Äô to see the properties &amp; then what could be done with them.
1337219395462987778 2020-12-11 10:15:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @anejills Without a ‚Äòsauce that is just a spreadsheet, or someone‚Äôs Christmas Wish list?
1337211018167033857 2020-12-11 09:42:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @TraderJohn990 Yes, however there are military exercises going on now &amp; ever since Flynn has been Pardoned &amp; ‚Äúsigned off‚Äù by corrupt Judge Sullivan, the pace of things has really amped up.
1337201284961562626 2020-12-11 09:03:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Audragirl01 @AsspocalypseN @paul_furber Lot of them lately. They sense things are up, but snarky little one liners are not absolutes. For example, they all decry, ‚Äú No evidence of fraud‚Äù. The dead people alone on the existing Govt. Voter Rolls disprove this. Underage Voters...easy to prove. Low information people.

1337173280826949632 2020-12-11 07:12:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @tammiesawakenow Seriously getting worse for them. Have they read the EO? If they are complicit it‚Äôs not a happy ending for them. (No pun intended)

1337091104395517953 2020-12-11 01:45:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He‚Äôs right about Donald Trump being right. The Left have become very tiresome.

Personally I don‚Äôt think Patriots are going to let them act up too much. Things be different.

1335977043595468800 2020-12-07 23:58:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The fact that none of the States Election Commissions &amp; Governors don‚Äôt even throw out the Votes from dead people &amp; underage Voters is awfully suspicious. These should be an Automatic No Vote from both sides of the aisle. These are easy to prove. Not ONE Democrat disavows these?
1335975759953842177 2020-12-07 23:53:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LawDog323 Yes. My neighbors knew of them from Arkansas days. They warned me then.

1335784035566555138 2020-12-07 11:11:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @r8rsforlife Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong, but in this equilibrium the Dems best strategy was to cheat. In 2016 Hillary technically wasn‚Äôt supposed to lose. Unfortunately for the Dems, weak Biden wasn‚Äôt capable of the win, therefore stuff the ballots is the best strategy.
1335781410708209665 2020-12-07 11:01:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @r8rsforlife I liked that! ü§†
1335777887052419073 2020-12-07 10:47:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When the Democrats gamed this Election con out, did they really plan on Trump conceding? There is no EndGame, but many going to jail &amp; worse. It‚Äôs a colossal blunder. Watch them turn on each other. In Game Theory that is a terrible miscalculation.

1333603845587357696 2020-12-01 10:48:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The fact that all 5 battleground states stopped counting at the same time, ‚ÄúDemonstrates prior coordination by election officials in five battleground states.‚Äù Then they used HAMMER and Scorecard, plus Dominion, to move Joe Biden into the lead. It is a ‚Äòmathematical impossibility

1333597889730285569 2020-12-01 10:24:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> To be sure though, The Dems were in on this one. The 4am ballot drops are your clues there. I do believe though Foreign influence will be proven to be a factor. Hunter Biden‚Äôs Laptop alone shows ties to China Bigly.

1333596338781515779 2020-12-01 10:18:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> ...so even though the Democrats think they won, a software switch in Germany linked to a Foreign Actor could have changed the outcome of a US Election. Trump has no recourse but to uphold The Constitution.

1328250653550931968 2020-11-16 16:16:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @K12Lioness @BardsFM It is.

1328249451194896386 2020-11-16 16:12:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @moipun Do you happen to have the number of it handy?
1328249228016066562 2020-11-16 16:11:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JaggerMickOZ @realDonaldTrump Oh it‚Äôs much worse than that. All assets can be seized for Election interference. ( that includes the employees reading this tweet.)
1328248610190868480 2020-11-16 16:08:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> What a genius concept? You cheat you forfeit!
1328246306947571714 2020-11-16 15:59:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LawDog323 @JanetBa44871836 üëç Twitter needs to remove that disclaimer because it‚Äôs Official now. If they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs Treason for trying to alter the result of an Election. It‚Äôs stated clearly in the 2018 EO.
1328243656856272896 2020-11-16 15:49:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Never bet against Donald Trump!
1328242682972442624 2020-11-16 15:45:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The whole time the Left/ Media were freaking out about Q &amp; Anons, they focused on us hard. Made big accusations. That‚Äôs okay. They not once focused on the EO‚Äôs, particularly the one from 2018. More of the genius of Q. Look here not there. Well that 2018 EO cost them the Election.

I‚Äôm thinking tomorrow of shoving the 2018 EO up liberals asses, because that‚Äôs the guts of the takedown. If you attempt to cheat or interfere in the outcome of an Election you lose! How perfect? ü§†
1328238624526139394 2020-11-16 15:29:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @dannyshanor Oh I know. I‚Äôm just being super careful &amp; cautious. It‚Äôs going to be a little tricky but we‚Äôll get through that part.

1328223421914746880 2020-11-16 14:28:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MarkSZaidEsq We don‚Äôt give a flying fuck anymore we just won the Election. Thanks for playing. Game over to be blunt. Oh, if you were knowingly involved in the Treason to steal the Election, get some good representation. All assets can be seized.
1328222361997373440 2020-11-16 14:24:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He just stole  the Election back from us! No son, it‚Äôs a return of Stolen Property!

Trump won by so much, the Democrats had to go into overdrive in the middle of the night to create millions of Votes. This is an easily provable statistical anomaly. A few only Votes they could have swung. Arrogance will be their fall.

1326366588279291904 2020-11-11 11:30:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> In the event of a worst case scenario, an Impasse if you will, I doubt that the US Military would come to the side of Joe Biden.

1326234265261023232 2020-11-11 02:44:23 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @PeterZeihan Picking a candidate with Dementia is never a good strategy. Trump filled stadiums with thousands, Biden couldn‚Äôt fill a minvan. You might want to reassess the meaning of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù, otherwise your credibility is sinking lower than the Pollsters.
1326223666804269057 2020-11-11 02:02:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Sh!t! We thought the Russians were going to hack our Election? We had no idea it was going to be the Democrats! üòâ
1326223164297285632 2020-11-11 02:00:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Democrats should be pleased we Monitored the Elections! Adam Schiff has been telling us for 4 years of the Russians. Why so serious, now?
1326222598082949121 2020-11-11 01:58:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BarbHaugen Yes. Good point. We had every right to monitor the Election in case the Russians? Infiltrated our Voting system. We weren‚Äôt expecting our own kind to cheat on us were we? üòâ

1326193091464753159 2020-11-11 00:00:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Part of our Plan, was letting the Democrats execute their Plan. Simply put, we let them rob the bank, except the Bills have been specially marked. What did our friends say in the early days?  "How do capture a Wild Animal?", as always  the answer is  A TRAP.
1326190669623255040 2020-11-10 23:51:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> That's right. Now f*ck them.

This has gone from Election to Overthrow of a popular President, who won in a Landslide. Scary stuff, really! The Fraud can be proven, stay with us.

1325485014520262656 2020-11-09 01:07:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump taking a LID like this drives the crooked Libs crazy. If you don‚Äôt know why he is doing this, then you ain‚Äôt a Trump believer!
1325479466961760256 2020-11-09 00:45:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @tracybeanz He wanted to win fair &amp; square, that‚Äôs why! However, he knew the potential for thievery- exactly like the Cops will use a bait car in the Hood. After the Dems did steal the car, Plan B, goes into effect. Let‚Äôs call it ‚Äú Insurance‚Äù, shall we? We learned that from Peter Stzrok.

1325340947299725312 2020-11-08 15:34:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @melanie52746044 They just updated all their Voting systems. The DEMs thought the Paper Ballots would be Key to Ballot stuffing, Covid-19 ‚úÖ, because they are really good at it, hence 600,000 Fresh Votes for Biden were just minted, except on the wrong Encoded paper.  https://t.co/vAy4L6xT4z
1325339968164622338 2020-11-08 15:30:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If this is indeed The Sting it really is Fooking Genius. It's like printing perfect $100 bills , except not on the right specially encoded paper.
1325339495592468482 2020-11-08 15:28:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Rogue States like Cali, thinking they have the entire recipe of Water marks &amp; special inks , which they are allowed to do send out the "Copy" of their Recipe to China who prints what they think are good ballots. Everything is perfect about them, except they are not on QFS paper.

1325338081499652096 2020-11-08 15:23:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This Cue drop is I believe the Keystone Drop re the Paper Ballots. If the DHS/cisa delivers Govt. Approved Blank Paper only to the States, they are then free to design &amp; print w/ USPS approval. The ‚ÄúSting‚Äù is the special encoded blank paper. Consider it Unmarked Currency.  https://t.co/0iri4lNdce
1325335016168022016 2020-11-08 15:11:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow if DHS supplied the QFS paper then that really is a fooking bombshell. (They may not supply direct but have Govt. approved suppliers.) Do you realize what this means?

1324611954619547648 2020-11-06 15:17:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Shakespeares Macbeth sums up the US Election process: ‚ÄúFair is foul and fouls is fair: Hover through the fog and filthy air.‚Äù
1324610596537470976 2020-11-06 15:12:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EddaMonaco He lives for this. Don‚Äôt tell anyone.
1324610232199176193 2020-11-06 15:11:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How come Joe Biden isn‚Äôt requesting transparency in the ballot counting process? Oh, that‚Äôs right, he‚Äôs the bastard cheating in this instance.
1324609763078930434 2020-11-06 15:09:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I mentioned earlier today, Biden won‚Äôt be asking for recounts? That would be a fool‚Äôs errand. This will all play out. Don‚Äôt worry.
1324604538913845248 2020-11-06 14:48:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Amethyst_DJT Haha...Twitter steals followers like Dems steal votes!
1324604288455200768 2020-11-06 14:47:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers You stole this from me bro, I had my tweet watermarked!
1324603529990844416 2020-11-06 14:44:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Like most of you, have been really focused on the Election &amp; it‚Äôs subsequent Coup. Each day, I think I‚Äôve followed back more followers than ever. I‚Äôm still less than what I was 3 weeks ago. I‚Äôm now going to steal followers. Old Dem trick!

1324590762453946368 2020-11-06 13:53:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Our 1A has been under unbelievable assault here, particularly last past 2 months. Our own President FFS! Just too many others for me to name. You know who they are. Imagine now if Joe Biden &amp; The Traveling Kamal succeed, what would happen to the 2A. Society on a precipice.
1324588905207746563 2020-11-06 13:46:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> America‚Äôs favorite Mayor, can‚Äôt even get his tweets liked! They‚Äôve even blocked that. Even when twit cheats it can‚Äôt win.  https://t.co/lxYUWdld62
1324587129918271488 2020-11-06 13:39:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trust the Science? After another Election fiasco, the Pollsters false numbers of trying to measure something that couldn‚Äôt be measured! @FrankLuntz I would like fries with my order please?
1324569914418495490 2020-11-06 12:30:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LaurieSmith1000 @hollywdharriet This seems to go along with the dots that anons are connecting re watermarks &amp; careful releasing of ballots. Many people are now confirming this.
1324541573837643776 2020-11-06 10:38:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MastodonOz @russ_ayers Unfortunately we are at a stage where more is going on behind the scenes. This is a Legal Warfare level now. Behind closed doors. Evidence is mounting. Check out Gateway Pundits recent tweet about the Dem calling fraud. He got thrown out of the Counting Ballots area.
1324533987012849664 2020-11-06 10:08:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JuliansRum @AwakenedOutlaw I prefer to win. Declas after that.

1324525653320896513 2020-11-06 09:34:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MastodonOz Agreed. In the middle of this storm, so as to speak. Wasn't like we were not forewarned.
1324525181348446208 2020-11-06 09:33:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @russ_ayers @MastodonOz I did see that. Makes sense.

1324514040463306752 2020-11-06 08:48:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @droseseest @artificialcaged I hate them both. I only tweet to myself anyways.

1324247500241408002 2020-11-05 15:09:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is supposedly more popular than Barack Obama.
1324247072040652800 2020-11-05 15:07:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> All of Joe Biden‚Äôs Votes, are just a Myth!

1324236536779481088 2020-11-05 14:26:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> So, our President Donald Trump has had to endure two attempted take over Coups in 4 years! These are extremely Desperate People, to do such Desperate things.

1323513691971686405 2020-11-03 14:33:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is why we laugh at you.
1323512958589153280 2020-11-03 14:30:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @GregReports I was laughing so hard, had tears running my face. Zoom in on the photos, you can see Trump is fully aware &amp; he can't stop grinning. That's gonna be a heck of plane ride back to DC sharing that story.
1323511346399379458 2020-11-03 14:24:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Never seen anything like it. I don't think Trump was tired at the end, he was just nursing his voice to get through &amp; he did it. Fkn amazing.

I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that good of an actor, but to put it all in perspective, doesn‚Äôt matter that much. Just want him to lose &amp; Trump to win. Get the Universe back to One.
1323488148366635008 2020-11-03 12:52:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Soonergirl_kp I‚Äôve never really liked JB ( not much a fan of any Dem), but I always thought he was a Moderate ( I was wrong again), but the picture on the left is the angry bastard I‚Äôve always disliked.

1323482350580236289 2020-11-03 12:29:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SpyGateDown If you go back &amp; analyze from day 1, they haven‚Äôt made a correct call. Russia, Mueller, Kavanaugh, Impeachment, Covid , Masks. Simply Hating Trump is NOT a Political Platform. Have you heard a single idea from them?....picking Biden , there‚Äôs another Gem!

1323480785538613249 2020-11-03 12:23:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trump_gigi Everything I‚Äôve read is that they pump him up &amp; it wears off. Trump has even said it himself.

1323480138378473473 2020-11-03 12:20:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RJB06953045 That‚Äôs a strong theory. I‚Äôve heard of other diseases, but the observed appearance can‚Äôt be denied. His cognitive skills are clearly displayed when Trump plays the video clips at the rallies.
1323479518703620096 2020-11-03 12:18:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trump_gigi Honestly, I haven‚Äôt thought of that angle. In 2020, anything is possible. Especially from very desperate people like the Dems.

1323478446731743233 2020-11-03 12:13:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This is how he looked about 24 months ago. The decline has been rapid.  https://t.co/q7xMms1mow

1323058011204591616 2020-11-02 08:23:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Make of this what you will, but some close family tried to place a sizable bet on Trump to win. No insider info, just thinking Trump has a reasonably good chance to win. After opening acct at  https://t.co/LRBvr9GtmK notified, taking no more bets on Trump.  (Balanced for payouts.)
1323054304354213889 2020-11-02 08:08:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Has this been done before in political history where our Candidate, Donald Trump, saves his breath by playing extensive video of the opposing Candidate Joe Biden? We are now at the point we can play Joe Biden‚Äôs entire speech at our Rally. Boggles the mind. Joe is Comedy Central!

1322832186072948738 2020-11-01 17:25:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Your perception may vary but I don‚Äôt think Donald Trump looks to be a day over 63. Joe Biden to me looks 84. In actuality Trump is 74, Biden is a few weeks from 78. I didn‚Äôt put any pictures, besides they‚Äôre everywhere. At minimum I‚Äôm saying there is a 20 year difference in look.

Unfortunately UPS/Fedex don‚Äôt have a camera tracking the package down the line, but they can narrow it down to the last person Scanning the package. We‚Äôll see. ( I have lost some packages over the years &amp; sometimes you get lucky.)
1321669002012209153 2020-10-29 12:23:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Oddly enough, I‚Äôve tried scanning Biden‚Äôs crowds. With no one there at every rally, it lets me know that this isn‚Äôt normal. It‚Äôs wrong that a Candidate running for President can‚Äôt get a soul to attend.
1321667416678526976 2020-10-29 12:17:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ApTnFlagsOut Tucker did make the missing package part of his segment, that‚Äôs for sure. That‚Äôs a lot of people tonight who viewed his show to find that out. Valid what you said.
1321665586791768066 2020-10-29 12:10:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ @Grayman1995 Good point.
1321659827253256192 2020-10-29 11:47:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @wild_borneo @MiaFarrow Trump hates war. She doesn‚Äôt know much about him. His Doctrine is Peace through Strength.
1321659458712293376 2020-10-29 11:45:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MikayesFiona I don‚Äôt know the details ( would love to), but it must have taken a lot of courage for the Adm. to meet Trump at Trump Tower.
1321658876731686913 2020-10-29 11:43:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Grayman1995 Doesn‚Äôt seem right. Has her account been hacked? She‚Äôs not capable of love.
1321652518074556416 2020-10-29 11:18:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is either telling the truth about having no business dealings with China, or telling the world a big fat lie. His ‚Äúactions‚Äù, even without the confirmation of texts, phone calls &amp; emails from Tony #Bobulinksi indicate the latter. A complete refusal to answer is not good
1321647385596977154 2020-10-29 10:57:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @theconservador It is! (...gold is still cool though.)

1321636238378455040 2020-10-29 10:13:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @szymon12463 It just seems to me, to pilfer Documents that someone would have copies of reeks of a certain desperate level.

We all send high res scans via email these days unless a ‚ÄúWet Signature‚Äù is required. Could have been ‚Äúbait‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt see why? Tucker knew this was biggest interview of his career, time was of essence.

1321608206204895232 2020-10-29 08:22:05 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tucker had been in Los Angeles to interview Tony #Bobulinski , therefore had requested the Confidential Documents be sent overnight.
1321607669736615936 2020-10-29 08:19:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Holy shit. Tucker just said that he had important Hunter Biden Docs overnighted to him by a major carrier ( NY to LA) and they disappeared around 3 am from the sorting facility. VANISHED! Don‚Äôt tell me Deep State isn‚Äôt playing for keeps. The Documents on Hunter are real!

1321303785705263110 2020-10-28 12:12:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @40dayz40knights I got sick of the Hot/Cold routine. Ann Coulter does that. One reason Trump resonates with me, he hasn't changed his tunes too much in 30-40 years. Every video of his past proves that. Biden on the other hand, changes like a leaf blower.
1321302342344560642 2020-10-28 12:06:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Grayman1995 üëç
1321302213428453377 2020-10-28 12:06:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @QArmy1973 After tonight he is. I know I am not the only one who is simply "Sick &amp; Tired" of being "Sick &amp; Tired" of the Dem lies. I think I've seen every good Spy/Political thriller movie out there. Nothing comes as close as these Dems &amp; their new Prince of Darkness the lying Joe Biden.
1321299718207668225 2020-10-28 11:56:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The ENTIRE reason Tony B. came forward is because Adam S. accused him of this being another Russian disinfo. Tony demanded Adam S. retract that statement. In Tony‚Äôs eyes Adam is calling him a traitor to his Country. Tony served with honor in the Navy. It‚Äôs a big deal. A real BFD.
1321296521283936256 2020-10-28 11:43:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @galloy_tammie Honestly, he's on my maul list.
1321296228827672576 2020-10-28 11:42:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Tony #Bobulinsky is a big hungry bear &amp; Adam Schiff is looking a little tasty right now. Run Adam Run. Hunters becomes the Hunted.
1321295454517317635 2020-10-28 11:39:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @galloy_tammie I'm pissed, but Tony has the Facts on his side. Truth is a beautiful thing to behold. The right people saw this tonight. The Real Chairman on AF1 saw it. Essentially, that's what really matters. Adam Schiff better be looking for a very remote cabin.
1321294457694785538 2020-10-28 11:35:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> #bobulinsky Thank You Tony . Thank You Tucker. So many take aways from that powerful interview. Just think @AdamSchiff just like Hunter left his Laptop, you tonight just played that Russia Card one time too many. You poked the wrong bear Son &amp; he's coming after you. Good Luck!

1321290368684642307 2020-10-28 11:19:06 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @RealJudasGoat Probably the best interview I‚Äôve ever seen. Tony is telling the gospel truth. Adam Schiff had better not get within 6 ‚Äò of Tony B.

1320480044028887040 2020-10-26 05:39:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Something is really off &amp; amiss with the Biden Campaign. (I'm quite aware of the Placeholder Theory). So many questions? (Ha...Comey!)  Running, trying to lose? (Harris payoff $$$)  I do expect a Trump Win, the enthusiasm is off of the charts.
1320478235948298240 2020-10-26 05:31:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow I saw that this morning. That is SO plausible. I'm talking in general about, well let's put it this way, for a while there our beloved WhiteHouse was a BathHouse. Leave it at that. Trump mentioned so many little clues about the general condition of the WH. It all makes sense now.

1320287651941920768 2020-10-25 16:54:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me I have a stupid photographic memory but not a good filing system! God Bless our President. I‚Äôve had long days on airplane flights &amp; just want to drag myself in. How he does this I‚Äôll never know?  https://t.co/2GoLkBvILO
1320286343218352129 2020-10-25 16:49:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me It was something like that. Thanks. Maybe that was it. I thought I saw one with the red tie draped around his neck...but this would have worked. In the end I liked that one I chose, kinda dramatic, almost noir. üëçüá∫üá∏ü§†
1320284190974242817 2020-10-25 16:40:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Thanks. I was looking for the picture of him walking across the lawn without a tie, end of the day &amp; when I saw that pic WOW! I often wonder what it‚Äôs like for him in The Quietest Moments? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs prayer &amp; guidance from JFK &amp; Abe. He just talks about it too often.
1320277976554954753 2020-10-25 16:16:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Sometimes it‚Äôs not your speeches, not your rallies (3x Today), not your Peace deals, trade deals...it‚Äôs the quietest moment like this at the end of the longest day, I have the utmost respect for what you carry on shoulders. Thank You, Mr. President @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/CAtN1RnBqS

1320275121915883521 2020-10-25 16:04:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow You got it. Quite clever really. The whole Q operation/ scheme/ marketing is one of the greatest ideas in History...particularly in this our first True Cyber era &amp; the Digital Wars we are encountering. I even resisted Twat for years, not caring where someone ate lunch.

This is not done in a bad banner but to keep a finger on the pulse of Patriots for what we want. 1A, 2A etc. I know you‚Äôre into software &amp; this can be done.

1320264257565454416 2020-10-25 15:21:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Another little interesting I like about Trump. We all know at heart he likes to talk at the Contractor level with some choice language. Not once has he ever said, GFYS bitch to any of the reporters. Jim Acosta included. He should have. I‚Äôve never seen a more rude disgusting bunch  https://t.co/GMR44iTOm6

1320262195024834560 2020-10-25 15:13:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Great Point. If Joe Biden was stupid &amp; dumb not to know his son was on the Board of Burisma earning $183,000 a month, he would never be my President. What a dumb ass!
1320260412907024384 2020-10-25 15:06:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @spetry9 They went back &amp; found an old tweet of mine in which I had recommended that Hillary should face a ......squad before dawn. Had to delete it. I thought it was reasonable. I even offered a last meal &amp; cigar. They didn‚Äôt see it my way.
1320258494964981760 2020-10-25 14:58:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SSG_PAIN You‚Äôll also notice that the MSM has never mentioned the powerful EO‚Äôs that Trump has executed. Interesting because they can strip away all your assets for human trafficking. Dec 2017.
1320254590315495425 2020-10-25 14:43:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I‚Äôve never mentioned this once in 33k tweets, but if I thought Q or Anons were into some nefarious evil stuff, would have walked away 2 + yrs ago. I‚Äôve lived long enough to see the good &amp; the bad. All the folks I mingle love their families, their Faiths, their Country &amp; Trump.
1320253554607620098 2020-10-25 14:39:11 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Infiltration not Invasion. I‚Äôm noticing these anti Q attacks that were ramped up this past several months were in anticipation of all the news we are getting. These @CNN @MSNBC hacks, this Witch Savannah Guthrie also, are ALL in on it. They propagate an evil sickness.
1320252075297566720 2020-10-25 14:33:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ Agreed.
1320250224774836225 2020-10-25 14:25:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Beardly_ That‚Äôs pretty messed up isn‚Äôt it?
1320250120768679938 2020-10-25 14:25:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @terryca53306307 Think there was a kew drop stating that. If not it‚Äôs Orwell. Lot of creepy things are not right with this World now. Fortunately Trump &amp; many good people are aware of this. ( ..,that includes us. We are the Good Guys. I have no desire to be on Their side.)
1320248790314487808 2020-10-25 14:20:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @filmdude63 I was thinking today, would have been an irony had Hunter been into the Shower thing? Maybe?? I‚Äôve followed Trump since 1987, having dabbled in RE &amp; business. Visited his office in 91. He‚Äôs always been a clean freak/ germaphobe, so when those stories came out my Radar went up.
1320247457314304004 2020-10-25 14:14:57 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I agree. Heck I think the NY post is still banned here for what emails? 2020 An Election like no other. My theory is on Hunters computer were details of The Dark Winter. Far greater implications for humanity than his one night stands.
1320246002276728832 2020-10-25 14:09:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SaberX01 I‚Äôm trying to take a lot of this in, but the ChyNa people releasing this are anti communist within the Country. Makes sense. I did business in Hong Kong for 35 years, they hated the Mainland. ( ..,even more so now!)
1320245069232758784 2020-10-25 14:05:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The information coming out is metaphorically like a dam bursting. ( I know, I know). I don‚Äôt know how Twat can stop it. Hunter‚Äôs dalliances only really show he is complicit &amp; compromised. (CP ??) Information on Joe Biden is beyond repair for him. Biden is done.  https://t.co/QkfAkOnNx3
1320240298010636289 2020-10-25 13:46:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SaberX01 @brenner_colleen Wouldn‚Äôt you consider that everything we do is a bit uphill? Probably why we get frustrated. I‚Äôve said this so often, but look what Trump does for us everyday. I still think millions of us banging at the keyboards helps. I have to believe that. (...not easy.)
1320238690271064065 2020-10-25 13:40:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DarleneIronCity He did.
1320236857309851648 2020-10-25 13:32:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @hmcd123 Yes. She‚Äôs a Democrat.
1320236719812214785 2020-10-25 13:32:17 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Side note. I chose not to R/T any Hunter Video links today ( not a Saint, just wasn‚Äôt interested), but my point here is Twitter shut everyone &amp; every link real quick, yet they were real pleased to share the fake Rudy Guilani Borat scene. Imagine if Don Jr. had a tape? No ban!
1320232705582272512 2020-10-25 13:16:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Blackstonecomms @3days3nights That‚Äôs pretty common. Happens frequently. They will come back.

1320231535673442309 2020-10-25 13:11:41 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Blackstonecomms @3days3nights I noticed 3d is restricted, but then I click again  it comes good. I‚Äôm surprised that 3d would be, because he is certainly smart enough not to R/T anything salacious about Hunter Biden. I know we are all shadow banned &amp; losing followers.

1319552040125689856 2020-10-23 16:11:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @4heartandsoul It was 3,500 years ago...long time ago 1974. The music was good then. It wasn't angry. You could listen to entire Albums. They were cohesive. The music would take you places as you sat on Bean Bag chairs!
1319551062060060673 2020-10-23 16:07:43 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SantinosCigars You get it. It's a hassle but it's also a fail safe option.

1319545707020185600 2020-10-23 15:46:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow ...bit of info overload lately, which is fine. Part of me is glad the so called Debates are out of the way, because they are never really satisfying anyway. It was even getting a glimpse of being better when Trump asked the questions of Joe direct. Didn't get an answer, but still

1319515756585861122 2020-10-23 13:47:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> In his 47 years Joe Biden has successfully created one job for his son Hunter, as a bagman, which has enriched his family with millions of Foreign $$. So there‚Äôs that.  https://t.co/EQKrj5BIww

1319502189472018432 2020-10-23 12:53:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @61_kerry Out of Chris Wallace, Savannah Guthrie , Kristen Welker is the tallest midget in the room.
1319501300711616512 2020-10-23 12:49:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Donald Trump built his debate performance on a Solid Foundation ( ...as a good builder would + he just knew Joe was lying thru his dentures re Foreign Income.) Joe Biden‚Äôs debate performance was built on a House of Cards. That‚Äôs the difference.
1319500155331043330 2020-10-23 12:45:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I probably just don‚Äôt appreciate just how good President Trump‚Äôs debate performance was until after the Debate. I know why. Was too busy being a smart ass live tweeting it. Won‚Äôt do that next time.
1319499294450171906 2020-10-23 12:42:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @61_kerry I was impressed because I thought President Trump would get ‚Äú angrier‚Äù ( as he should üòÖ), but he was very measured &amp; focused. He set some nice little traps which Joe fell into.
1319498047575871488 2020-10-23 12:37:04 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Fight Club Rule. Never look at your watch during a debate.
1319496972475138048 2020-10-23 12:32:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> As we all know the MSM has been largely crickets on Hunter‚Äôs Laptop.

1319491567162253314 2020-10-23 12:11:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LaTxGal I thought that was Trump‚Äôs basic winning point tonight. Biden kept saying, ‚Äú I‚Äôm gonna fix it‚Äù &amp; Trump hammered back every time, ‚Äú Why didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù It left Biden with no response as there was none.
1319486335149768704 2020-10-23 11:50:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Go.
1319485858634887168 2020-10-23 11:48:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Quick thought. Joe Biden‚Äôs 47 years in Politics is basically One Half a Century. Ponder that!

1319483486382665730 2020-10-23 11:39:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> To sum up Joe Biden‚Äôs debate performance tonight in his words he says he NEVER received a penny in Foreign monies from anyone.

1318640345010249728 2020-10-21 03:48:52 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Socialism. Just Say NO!
1318595887560454153 2020-10-21 00:52:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I wouldn‚Äôt want this tweet in my honor from Hillary. She is not a good predictor!
1318591088643305472 2020-10-21 00:33:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 It‚Äôs Politics before Justice. This concept has aways been difficult for me to accept. I‚Äôm not part of the Political Machine. It‚Äôs a dirty business.
1318590625600581632 2020-10-21 00:31:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Colin, it‚Äôs a mixed bag. You‚Äôre right. I do see information coming out. I do see reporting &amp; it has increased. I realize it has to be a Public Relations item in order to win over undecided or Biden Voters who will realize Joe is a crook. It has to be that way.
1318588109706063872 2020-10-21 00:21:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Simple question here. Shouldn‚Äôt our Dept. of Injustice be looking into the Biden Crime Family accusations? Not that difficult for them...they have ALL the resources. Technically the MSM should be reporting after the charges are filed. Not up to us to make the case. Hate to say it
1318584708469436416 2020-10-21 00:07:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @kylegriffin1 I can‚Äôt even look at Kyle Griffin profile pic. He is a reincarnated Nazi Youth. Worked in the Propaganda Dept. under Goebbels.
1318583371442778113 2020-10-21 00:02:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Has anyone ever seen a negative hashtag on Biden, since they have been on Twitter? No need to reply. Save your valuable digital ink. There are none. Welcome to the Manifesto.

1318567845480026116 2020-10-20 23:00:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @wjarbuckles1 I think you will find Chy-Na/Iran work close together on many deals against their enemy, which is us.
1318566819288903680 2020-10-20 22:56:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I don‚Äôt care where you stand politically. For example, accusations now about Hunter Biden accepting monies &amp; funneling back to his father Joe Biden. All the he said, she said means nothing to me. The solution? Follow the $$$$. Forensic Accountants can trace ALL money=Answers.
1318563808005124099 2020-10-20 22:44:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Interesting how the Left always blame Russia. Never China. ü§î
1318562810461257728 2020-10-20 22:40:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden pimped out his drug addicted son Hunter, to sell America out.

1318416964570685446 2020-10-20 13:01:14 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> When Joe Biden brags about giving $1Billion in aid to Ukraine, then withholding funds until the Prosecutor is fired...then he gets a CUT of said funds paid back to him, that is Taxpayer money that YOU paid &amp; he has stolen it from YOU! Trump should have him arrested at the Debate.  https://t.co/PjkGoxpiRj

Hillary Clinton ran a better Campaign in 2016 than Joe Biden has in 2020. His has been a very lackluster, unenthusiastic Campaign &amp; now he is exposed as being a genuine criminal.

1318208133227933697 2020-10-19 23:11:24 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> 15 months ago would have been better than with 15 days to go. These guys can‚Äôt even order foot long Subs at Subway in that amount of time.

1317625732055461889 2020-10-18 08:37:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Most people have shown some common sense, by saying only if absolutely, necessary. Which is the correct answer to give Trump a Vote. There were a couple of stoics that said never under any circumstance. They also would not put the Oxygen Mask on while the plane is going down!
1317624645739188227 2020-10-18 08:32:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You created just ONE in your life, for Hunter, then took 50% of his paycheck. Way to go Pops.

I'm saying, hold your nose, wear the damn mask, because Voting for Trump is more important. I also think there will a a mask burning day on Nov 4th.

I think Trump will win on Nov 3rd, and it will fade away quickly. I live in SoCal &amp; people are wearing them less &amp; less. Just an observation on society.

1317006272353300480 2020-10-16 15:35:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @squiidink @KillAuDeepState Yes. It fits in with the Hunters will be Hunted. Pretty bad since deep state actors in FBI had this since around Jan? Repair guy was super smart to make back up copies. Who needs to watch Spy/Thriller movies with all this?
1317002404882051072 2020-10-16 15:20:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> You want to Empower People? Let us decide. Thanks Mom.
1317000520393895939 2020-10-16 15:12:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @KillAuDeepState @squiidink Simple answer. Plausible. I don‚Äôt think the Hunter laptop was meant to come out but it did. This is the real big tell. The last 2 days Twitter/YT has shut down any/every lge acct. No RT of NYPost story? Twitter outage JUST TODAY? No body does something for Nothing. No one.

1316952995997896709 2020-10-16 12:03:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Is there any way that we can actually legally divorce ourselves from the Democrats? We don‚Äôt need these users &amp; abusers in our lives, but they sure as heck want us around to tell us what to do. Naturally we are going to need a good settlement from them for ruining 4 yrs for us.

1314632466611617792 2020-10-10 02:22:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @martingeddes Hello PenPal!
1314630894485815296 2020-10-10 02:16:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Rush Limbaugh today very astutely pointed out that during the 2 hours on the air with President Trump, uninterrupted, not once did the President demur, deflect, delay, lose train of thought or cough. Could Joe Biden do the same?
1314629203644432385 2020-10-10 02:10:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I was on the fence about Voting, but after hearing President Trump so clear, vibrant &amp; healthy today, he's got my Vote.
1314628140786802690 2020-10-10 02:05:48 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump on Rush Limbaugh today:  "The people are smarter than the Media!"
1314612663704457216 2020-10-10 01:04:18 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> let me be perfectly clear. Scully was not hacked because Scaramucci REPLIED to him! These two are nothing but lying dog faced pony soldiers.
1314608797210431493 2020-10-10 00:48:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @BoSnerdley 1. Can Rush ask our President please: When does Joe Biden release his full medical report &amp; mental evaluation? No one has a clue? 2. President Trump can ask Joe Biden, why did he have to drop out of 1988 Presidential Race? ( he was caught lying!) üá∫üá∏
1314602918322946048 2020-10-10 00:25:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @unseen1_unseen Good question. Great answer.

1314100379634728960 2020-10-08 15:08:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Think so. Different styles, which is good. I believe Trump was throwing Biden off with purposeful interruption, as Biden‚Äôs prep was all based on linear ( memorized ) thinking. Wasn‚Äôt pretty, but was effective. Pence disarmed Cabala like a fuse on a nuclear b*mb. Most excellent.

1314055668358246400 2020-10-08 12:10:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Hard to really answer, but all my digging on this shows that for the Dems this is not a Pro-Biden Campaign but an Anti-Trump Campaign. The AOC crowd can't name a thing about Biden. Can't blame them, he's done nothing. All the Left's comment are against Trump. Never Pro Biden.
1314052993084387330 2020-10-08 12:00:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon She basically was auditioning for the role of President tonight, but she made it very clear on several occasions , that she won't be lectured to. Cannot tell you how many I've hired &amp; interviewed, but that's usually a non starter.
1314050629929635840 2020-10-08 11:50:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Kamala Harris has to consider herself as one of the luckiest woman alive tonight. THERE'S ONLY ONE VP DEBATE. #VpDebate
1314046546409783296 2020-10-08 11:34:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Mike Pence did a great job for us tonight. Kamala Harris also did a great job for us tonight! #VpDebate
1314043374819704832 2020-10-08 11:22:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @MikayesFiona I freaking hate the lies. The one about the Troops sent me flying across the room. Still though, if Kamala just told the truth, wouldn't be much to say would there?
1314042653395173377 2020-10-08 11:19:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Parody Account? ...no, apparently it's the Biden Campaign.

Better than Wallace...but she still had a strong bias in a lot of questions &amp; she cut Pence off when he got too Truthful. It was really crappy she didn't let Pence respond about Kamala huge lie about the Troops. BAD!

1314034372324913152 2020-10-08 10:46:22 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Pence was such a gentleman, he pauses enough. He didn't allow Kamala to get angry enough. Quite brilliant really. Harris proves she really is unlikable &amp; a real LIAR. I couldn't do this w/Trump....his mind goes at Warp Speed.
1314030336460771328 2020-10-08 10:30:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @montana2552 I get that. I just don‚Äôt think it changes dynamics, as in the outcome.

1314016263639756802 2020-10-08 09:34:25 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @EdwardCIB Yes. Pence is disarming her. It‚Äôs difficult for her to get scrappy &amp; throw mud, Pence just keeps giving her Roses. He‚Äôs very specific. She goes off tangent.
1314015774311284736 2020-10-08 09:32:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @montana2552 Yes. üëç
1314014941037223936 2020-10-08 09:29:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Pence is disarming her, by being the gentleman. Kamala isn‚Äôt used to that. Not in the way you think, but she prefers scrappy debates. He‚Äôs good...from the pure debating aspect.
1314014330552115200 2020-10-08 09:26:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I can‚Äôt disagree with that.

1313672393945018368 2020-10-07 10:48:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Did this broad look at any Cities the Democrats have ruined. Business ruined. People‚Äôs lives ended due to unnecessary murder? Journalistic Slut.
1313671636772556803 2020-10-07 10:44:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 I‚Äôve seen more accounts doing that lately. Kind of takes away the open forum aspect.
1313670086348034048 2020-10-07 10:38:50 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Deceptiongoodo1 I hate that. I was trying to be fair to give her credit as it was the first one in my TL.
1313667360448892928 2020-10-07 10:28:00 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @beardly01 I knew something was up when President Trump landed home so ‚Äúmagnificent‚Äù last night. The unhinging was too great. I couldn‚Äôt figure it out at the time. Dem insiders must have got the word re declas &amp; they all went 4am.
1313666516324212737 2020-10-07 10:24:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @99Cindygrice Declas by President Trump tonight. See his tweets.
1313666106540748806 2020-10-07 10:23:01 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @echas3wi Just from memory, when Donald Trump was Campaigning I saw the Dems use violence to stop his  appearance in Chicago. They blocked the road in Arizona. Since then it‚Äôs worse with Antifa/BLM. I have a zero tolerance attitude towards that. Don‚Äôt like the Dem lies either.

1313348647732486145 2020-10-06 13:21:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I love capitalism. These folks have invented a completely useless breathable mask. I don‚Äôt wear one 99% of the time, but if you need to do an overseas flight or to visit an ER this can work until the Covid crap settles down. I get anxiety from masks.

1312985552757555200 2020-10-05 13:18:44 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If (IF?) there is another so called debate, I would love for @realDonaldTrump to directly ask Joe Biden, Just how did you get thrown out of the 1988 Presidential Election? (...for those unaware, he was caught lying &amp; plagiarizing!) ..oddly enough, nothing has changed in 32 years.

1312962072544567298 2020-10-05 11:45:26 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I‚Äôm reading that Joe Biden is ill. The thing is I can‚Äôt confirm that, but the point is, if he is {they} will cover it up. President Trump didn‚Äôt cover up his Covid diagnosis. Immediate transparency &amp; straight into good medical care. All we are seeing is Jill Biden &amp; Joe sneezing.
1312960733496262656 2020-10-05 11:40:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> All the Blue Checks freaking out today about President Trump having a masked SUV ride with the blessing of highly trained Doctors, and yet not a one of them condemned the thousands of rioters out in the streets. The hypocrisy spreads thick with the Left.

1312940470129946624 2020-10-05 10:19:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> If you wear a mask you are now a killer. Liberal Illogical Logic.

1312917820221448192 2020-10-05 08:49:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon I just have been noticing that all over the board. Bear in mind had that been Joe Biden leaving today in the same situation, would have been a mass Media Collective Cheering. Therefore they are all full of sh!t.
1312916789328662528 2020-10-05 08:45:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Bruno062418 I have a real good hunch as to who makes her payroll. Secondly, had that been Biden leaving the hospital she would be tweeting tears of joy.
1312912384076341248 2020-10-05 08:27:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @StaubGreg That‚Äôs a favorite word. Had Joe Biden, left the hospital today, the Left would cheer.

1312908344772841472 2020-10-05 08:11:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Meanwhile occurring in a parallel Universe today. Joe Biden left the hospital this afternoon, recovering from Covid, to wave to the crowd from inside his SUV. The Media: This is so exciting. This is incredible. He is well. He lives. We love you. -(I‚Äôm grateful, Trumps Universe!)
1312904243100045313 2020-10-05 07:55:38 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> This has been such a wonderful uplifting day for all Patriots. Our President is getting super healthy.

1312631158434230272 2020-10-04 13:50:30 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trishtweety I see your point Trish, but as a former small business owner, the Insurance companies only pay out so often until they cancel you. They did it to me on real estate owned with broken water pipes ( extreme cold).
1312630475085627392 2020-10-04 13:47:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LaTxGal Seems that way doesn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs quite terrifying really. These are Joe Biden‚Äôs goons &amp; thugs. He owns them now.

I‚Äôm only posting this as a marker to see how much more lies &amp; bullsh!t the MSM/Dems can foist upon us. This last two days with President Trump out with Covid has been putting Burger King Whoppers to shame. Start your engines idiots.  https://t.co/9sKdWrWCdF

1312620491882991618 2020-10-04 13:08:07 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HankDeplo I think so. Those hybrid experiments need to be looked into.
1312618241957584896 2020-10-04 12:59:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> A fully recovered Donald Trump could do Holographic rallies &amp; thousands &amp; thousands would attend across the Country.

1312534726414987265 2020-10-04 07:27:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump should give Joe Biden a call. Just check up on him &amp; see how he is doing?

1311547849838977024 2020-10-01 14:05:49 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trailrunner12 We saw how the Dems tried to throw Barr off thought with that fiasco hearing. It didn‚Äôt work, Barr didn‚Äôt take the bait as he is naturally a clear thinker. Biden, has to struggle to keep his thoughts straight, earpiece or not. Trump was successful therefore in throwing Joe off.
1311547056910004225 2020-10-01 14:02:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @trailrunner12 That line of thinking that you are alluding to would also apply if Biden did not have an earpiece. All of Biden‚Äôs rehearsals are based on linear thought A&gt;B&gt;C. Trumps interruptions cause him to go A&gt;C.

What Trump did last night was a stealth attack in broad light in front of millions &amp; very few saw it. In plain sight. It was masterful.

1311524067275534336 2020-10-01 12:31:19 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HandsomeSean1 Biden sold out the Green Deal, threw BLM under the bus. Had no answer at all re lack of Law Enforcement &amp; committed massive perjury on Live TV, denying he &amp; his sons crooked deals. Trump then calmy said, We have it all. So good!
1311523226514673664 2020-10-01 12:27:58 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @HandsomeSean1 So they say. Trump said he heard tonight that Biden doesn‚Äôt want to do anymore. No wonder. Trump basically rolled a grenade over to Biden &amp; he wasn‚Äôt aware he had exploded.

His speaking style more up tempo, faster delivery. Not anger, but some impatience. Probably still pissed at the double teaming last night &amp; was brutally cold in Duluth. Message Delivered.

1311190662373466114 2020-09-30 14:26:29 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lex31555 Swearing. I swear by it!
1311187998059315200 2020-09-30 14:15:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @skyfallingsoon Yes. It was scrappy &amp; ugly, but Trump scored the points he NEEDED to. Biden nearly lost his temper several times, very close. Biden was disrespectful, but I was surprised the drugs they had pumped into him kept him in the match just long enough.
1311184982489006080 2020-09-30 14:03:55 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @Jorju5 Hair plug surgery.

1311183188211822592 2020-09-30 13:56:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Biden backstage bragging how he stood up to that son of a bitch Trump. Except this üëá
1311181676383330304 2020-09-30 13:50:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow @shilo1949 Have you seen the size of those things, like a knitting needle.
1311180185782218753 2020-09-30 13:44:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Stay a loser then. Choice is yours.
1311179415565393926 2020-09-30 13:41:47 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @lex31555 Didn‚Äôt help him much. Trump refuted his so called facts. The things that Biden lied about, all the crooked dealings, we know Trump has physical evidence.
1311178858121420802 2020-09-30 13:39:34 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ncsunsetlover He was!
1311178592772997120 2020-09-30 13:38:31 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @SweeneyMomma It was scrappy but Trump scored more hidden points than meets the eye. Biden doesn‚Äôt support New Green Deal. No Police support him. He claims zero wrongdoing on Burisma, China...I believe Trump has ‚Äúactual‚Äù evidence. He was rude, his temper flared. Cognitively the drugs worked.

A favorite zinger when Trump asked Biden to name any Police supporting him. Trump said we have time, I‚Äôll wait. Biden said he didn‚Äôt have time. ( TKO )
1311162043332882433 2020-09-30 12:32:46 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights @SpeakWrong @boehmeb It‚Äôs the only way. Exactly why Trump had to let us see the riots.

1311158314550439937 2020-09-30 12:17:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights @boehmeb Exactly.
1311157585240756229 2020-09-30 12:15:03 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @3days3nights @boehmeb When do you show the Trump Card?because that‚Äôs a beauty to have on your hand. It‚Äôs got Bank Accts, Tracking no‚Äôs, routing no‚Äôs , addresses &amp; phone no‚Äôs.
1311156859105996800 2020-09-30 12:12:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Since Biden admitted tonight on Live TV, that he is the Democrat Party now, I just want to introduce him to a couple of lovely kids he got with the package deal. Joe meet Antifa &amp; BLM. You‚Äôre just gonna love them.
1311156098066341889 2020-09-30 12:09:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @menton_m Yep. Boss of Antifa/BLM.  Inherited b*stard children also.

1311148509752516609 2020-09-30 11:38:59 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @1FreeInhabitant Since Biden denied everything on Live TV, I believe Trump set him up for a future time, because he has the facts. (Banks, Wire Transfers,Routing #‚Äôs ...fun stuff like that)

1311144124699926528 2020-09-30 11:21:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @FedUpnTX Biden denied all the claims against him live, in front of a national audience. You are correct. Trump has proof of the malfeasance &amp; will at the right time bring down the hammer. It was a set up against Joe.
1311136824585195520 2020-09-30 10:52:33 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Trump should just arrest Joe Biden tomorrow.

1311125981290061824 2020-09-30 10:09:28 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Anything to do with Law &amp; Order, Biden can‚Äôt respond. Trump asked Biden who in Law supports him? Trump said, go ahead we have time. Biden said we have no time! üòÖ

The tax loss carryforward can be claimed by an individual or a business in order to reduce any future tax payments.

1310245348938407936 2020-09-27 23:50:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeplorableGoldn @Breaking911 Biden has a dreadful temper.
1310127977531727883 2020-09-27 16:03:45 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @KittygirlTara Trump has been alluding to this in his rallies by also saying that Biden is too weak &amp; feeble to engage World Leaders...Putin, Xi &amp; kim jong-un etc.
1310123404729544705 2020-09-27 15:45:35 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> How can Joe Biden appear on the World Stage if he can‚Äôt even appear on his backyard patio? #Trump2020
1310122636207300608 2020-09-27 15:42:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @bjamesc2020 I never thought they had ANY candidate that could beat Trump. Also thought their whole message of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just Hate Trump‚Äù was poor. Lastly the whole Burning, looting, Rioting &amp; murder, as Trump would say: ‚Äú That‚Äôs a real beauty!‚Äù Weak pathetic Party really.
1310120156547354626 2020-09-27 15:32:40 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeplorableGoldn @Breaking911 Poorly I would think. I‚Äôm thinking now that Trump won‚Äôt come on so strong, but more so with pushes &amp; prods to let the world see ( &amp; of course the prospective voters), that Joe really has lost his mind &amp; is not qualified to be President.

1309981434895986689 2020-09-27 06:21:27 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @P51leahy Interesting enough Trump only has to watch him destroy himself. Trump may give a little poke or prod to push him along. It‚Äôs better this way.

The best strategy IMO is for Trump to let him destroy himself. It‚Äôs all about Votes. Any fence sitters/Undecided can see then for themselves that Biden is mentally ‚Äúnot fit‚Äù for the job. Votes Matter.
1309940263985455104 2020-09-27 03:37:51 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Twitter needs to shut itself down since its Trends section clearly violates its own policy of influencing Voting. Honest Trends would show Trump leading in every area possible. #TwitterTrendsAreRigged

1309557286923190274 2020-09-26 02:16:02 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> He doesn't want to win. His team know s he can't. No ground game across the Country for Joe Biden. I read today, that some will be taking the easy way out.  The dynamics ALL changed after RBG passed.
1309553178568876033 2020-09-26 01:59:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> I propose a simple new Rule. Kayleigh it‚Äôs time now to ask the Reporters some questions! 1. Who do really work for?
1309550640083816448 2020-09-26 01:49:37 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> As of today antifa (.) com still redirects to joebiden (.) com. If you support Joe, you are supporting Domestic Terrorism.

1309537574461927425 2020-09-26 00:57:42 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> The Left have actually turned into what for so many years they said they despise. #Trump2020
1309535520582590465 2020-09-26 00:49:32 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @ColinSkow Here is an example. We just learned yesterday that had Gen Flynns case been dismissed, we wouldn‚Äôt have learned the bombshell revelations that Techno Fog revealed.

The usual suspects will have a hissy fit, but I believe it will die down for several reasons. It won‚Äôt be organic. They won‚Äôt get paid. No pay, no riot. Finally good citizens will be willing then to put an end to it. IMO
1309309712492453889 2020-09-25 09:52:15 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me Haha skid mark! üòÖ I‚Äôll read it thanks.
1309308456227151872 2020-09-25 09:47:16 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @FotherTyme @LJT_is_me When you have a major Election just weeks away, you don‚Äôt just ‚Äúchange horses in mid-stream‚Äù The Dems never do anything without a good valid crooked reason. We may never find out, but the PANIC from them is real.
1309306934743375874 2020-09-25 09:41:13 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @LJT_is_me He‚Äôs not even trying now. Something about RBG passing has changed the entire dynamic. Maybe they thought the Supremes would allow the fake mail in ballots with Comprised Roberts giving a 5-4 victory. Similar to the hanging Chads fiasco Bush-Gore.

1309234704873218048 2020-09-25 04:54:12 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Joe Biden is a walk on extra, on "The Walking Dead."
1309234235895545856 2020-09-25 04:52:20 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> It should be really interesting to see how the Democrats de brainwash all of their Voters from the Mail-in Ballots scheme.

1309186304324767744 2020-09-25 01:41:53 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> President Trump probably is doing close to zero time prepping for the so called debate. Why? Because Trump knows what he is talking about. I hope he makes a verbal pi√±ata out of Biden. Gloves are off.

1308649088397631488 2020-09-23 14:07:10 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @COsweda I can‚Äôt wait to watch it. Consider it, Reclaiming some Time, although if his handlers can come up with a way to wriggle Biden out of it they will. They‚Äôve covered him up thus far with a friendly media, but a Debate is their single worst nightmare.

He may have been put up just to lose, he really is a lousy candidate. Also he or (they) may think this would give him some sort of immunity from criminal Burisma charges &amp; crooked China deals involving Hunter?
1308636195467849728 2020-09-23 13:15:56 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @DeplorableMikeG Very similar. In 2016 he had to make the sale. His manner now is quietly very assured, without letting up. He still repeats the core phrases, but it‚Äôs the off script stuff I‚Äôm trying to hone in on.

1308266612139548672 2020-09-22 12:47:21 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher Trump has alluded to this many times &amp; frankly he would have been harder to beat. The young Antifa‚Äôs buy into socialism easily, as if it‚Äôs something cool. ( they can‚Äôt explain what it is however when questioned.)
1308266053567303680 2020-09-22 12:45:08 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @JustAnArcher I used to think that way, but THEY put him up as the nominee &amp; had plenty of time to do so otherwise. How come no Democrats call Joe Biden out? ( ...many know, believe me.) If Trump couldn‚Äôt speak for 2-3 minutes I would speak up. That probably is the difference.

1307195254982942723 2020-09-19 13:50:09 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> @COsweda I agree. The irony here is that the DNC have seen the violence affect the Polls- hence Nancy &amp; Joe have made a few comments alluding to it this past week, albeit too late. More violence will NOT help them.
1307188835789406209 2020-09-19 13:24:39 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Apparently Covid-19 ended today, now we have to play "Dying Wishes" for the next 45 days, or we burn the Country down. That seems to be the early version of today's 4am memo all you folks are mass tweeting now.
1307182606048403457 2020-09-19 12:59:54 +0800 <JohnOutbakjak> Well, I guess the masks got ripped off today. No need for them anymore, when the Left will be marching for Fervent Wishes now.
