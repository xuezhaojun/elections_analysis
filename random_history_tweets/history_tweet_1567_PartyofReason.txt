1341463604873277442 2020-12-23 03:20:21 +0800 <PartyofReason> Dr. Firestone is RIGHT.

1341462575859576834 2020-12-23 03:16:15 +0800 <PartyofReason> correct - he and his supporters aren't going anywhere - if anything, they're going to get stronger, more angry &amp; more organized. That's what we were concerned about with a neolib. Our policies helped Republicans too. But Ds had to torpedo those policies for their donors.

A person with a gun often kills a person without a gun.

1340710517430743045 2020-12-21 01:27:51 +0800 <PartyofReason> @joefirestonephd A bit of a case. You explained why each may or wouldn‚Äôt be acceptable to the other side. Easy to absorb, clear, concise .The PowerPoint was very helpful for visual learners too.

1340502722592862210 2020-12-20 11:42:09 +0800 <PartyofReason> this, @joefirestonephd, is an outstanding breakdown. Thank you.
1340492044381409284 2020-12-20 10:59:43 +0800 <PartyofReason> @Deprogram_Amer @SarcasmStardust I was on board a month ago - about #600 or so. Jesse lives in my district and they called my Congressperson on Livestream

1340490907460755456 2020-12-20 10:55:12 +0800 <PartyofReason> @greg06897 I agree - so does @joefirestonephd - 20 minutes worth watching - and give his new YouTube channel a sub!  https://t.co/EBNYZFGLg8

If we can't get this at least in the national conversation, it‚Äôll be literally years before we can get it on the agenda again (Rs will likely take House back in '22). We have leverage. Use it.

1340372122661740549 2020-12-20 03:03:11 +0800 <PartyofReason> @RayGordonChess2 @RoKhanna @Joshua4NPV1 You're never going to get assets from people who have them. Wiping out debt is an entirely different conversation. There is inherent value in objects. That doesn't all go back to zero.

NEEDS IT. NOW. It may fail today, but that sets it up to pass tomorrow. The fact that it can't even be discussed shows how just out of touch most of Congress is.
1340361526734155776 2020-12-20 02:21:05 +0800 <PartyofReason> @mexieYT @YouTube Did you set up a bot in Discord to bypass their notifs? At least the hardcores will know and spread the word. Not in your Discord (yet) so I don't know.
1340357587162836992 2020-12-20 02:05:26 +0800 <PartyofReason> @NomikiKonst @richimedhurst @jimmy_dore What progressives actually should do is #ForcePelosiOut and shoot much bigger than a M4A floor vote. If she goes, we push for an advocate speaker &amp; maybe is one of the 118 who already "supports" it. The vote should be the absolute minimum we settle for.  https://t.co/OKxJ16CcYY

The condescension, not letting Katie finish a sentence. I was upset yelling at my phone listening to it. I wanted them to get along. Sam‚Äôs smugness definitely rubbed off on Nomi.

How about we try outright obstruction, illegal interference &amp; downright election fraud/vote theft? This is what we have to fight or it ensures corporatists will continue to win rigged Presidential primaries.

1338195034970198018 2020-12-14 02:52:13 +0800 <PartyofReason> @Ah_occ_o @AnaKasparian @AOC Imagine thinking whoever Jimmy supported wasn‚Äôt for M4A? Like he wouldn‚Äôt have pushed his preferred candidate to do the same? He had to personally delcare bankruptcy due to medical when he had top insurance. But go on about what you think Jimmy cares about...
1338192590018056193 2020-12-14 02:42:30 +0800 <PartyofReason> @vicvonbadmeme @briebriejoy 2022 will be a Republican sweep, and the Dems know that. The party who wins the Presidential usually loses seats in a midterm. This is the only time we‚Äôll have the leverage in the next 4 years minimum. Get everyone on record.
1338192005701251072 2020-12-14 02:40:11 +0800 <PartyofReason> @mattyglesias Only among neolibs - you just reveal yoursel every day. Medicare for All or Primary for You. Welcome to the left. I know you think that‚Äôs where you live, but everyone actually on the left is laughing at that notion.
1338180759228706817 2020-12-14 01:55:29 +0800 <PartyofReason> @UrbeWSS @aaronjmate @AnaKasparian He personally had to declare bankruptcy after having the ‚Äúbest‚Äù insurance, so I‚Äôd say his faith on this is motivated in not seeing anyone else go through what he did. Gross.
1338169236167020544 2020-12-14 01:09:42 +0800 <PartyofReason> @AnaKasparian @AOC You have done zero in the last 6 mos to hold a Dem accountable, then you stood by while TYT sheep dogged for the establishment. So you can just sit right down now. You‚Äôve been too busy calling out Rs and making fun of Ben Shapiro. Personal pettiness about Jimmy over Russiagate

1338155720785661962 2020-12-14 00:16:00 +0800 <PartyofReason> @AOC @matthewstoller Why are you answering everyone but the person who initiated this push? As someone who researched your district for JDs, this is disappointing. It's downright insulting. Did someone pull you aside &amp; tell you to never engage Jimmy again? That he's "toxic"? Was it an MSNBC producer?
1338129289930285056 2020-12-13 22:30:58 +0800 <PartyofReason> @TheMarieFonseca Not sure this is all on her, but the lack of public pushback against Nancy to me since the Sunrise sit in is the part that angers me more than anything. That‚Äôs what we sent her there to do. Question every Dem Establishment move &amp; be loud about it - from the left.

1337847060243091457 2020-12-13 03:49:29 +0800 <PartyofReason> @Its_Miss_Riss @brundocks Yeah, but we both know they don't really fight Republicans. They're already freaking out about Pascrell's idea. They primarily punch the powerless left &amp; suck up to the money on the right. That tactic could also backfire &amp; further push the RWNJs to call for secession.
1337845736856281089 2020-12-13 03:44:14 +0800 <PartyofReason> @brundocks @Its_Miss_Riss If 15 progressives just decide not to vote at all, there are more Rs to vote than Ds. No D has to vote for McCarthy, and he still gets the speakership. No other D is even running for Speaker - Ds unanimously nominated her last month, so it's her or lose to Rs.

I'm in favor of this, I just think we should ask for more than a vote. And what if she says yes &amp; welches? There's a decent chance this could be her last term, since she'd be 83 &amp; agreed to no more than 4 terms as Speaker

He exposed their donors &amp; friends as elitists who actually looked down on Bernie &amp; progressives with the Podesta emails. It's revenge by proxy. Did he actually commit a crime? Completely lost.

1312972147149733888 2020-10-05 12:25:28 +0800 <PartyofReason> YouTube censoring &amp; penalizing the left is real. There is a concerted effort by MSM networks on YouTube to go after non-corporate-owned channels, which gets their content shown even more &amp; further suppresses independent media. Consider @TheRokfin as a backup alternative.
1312971400085471234 2020-10-05 12:22:30 +0800 <PartyofReason> @danduq00 @commondreams What did it showcase about Joe Biden. Serious question, as I refused to watch the shitshow.

This is all mental m*sturbation if we can't stop our Congress being bought &amp; paid for. And this has to be bipartisan to be enforced beyond 1 presidential term. I support the uncorrupted left, but they don't oppose Ds enough

1312967558555934720 2020-10-05 12:07:14 +0800 <PartyofReason> @wagepeace @davwim Just like a Republican - "everyone can go to work until it happens to me, NOW it's a problem." Overprivileged millionaires doing the bidding of billionaires &amp; CEOs. If they don't need to show up in person &amp; get paid, neither does every teacher that doesn't feel completely safe.

There is still a chance for Joe to actually NOT give the finger to the left. You could actually help by demanding he do that. We know he won't, but not gonna stop us from screaming the obvious. He can guarantee a win by pledging to legalize cannabis

The Dems have been absolutely repellent since February to the left of their base, to attract 8% of Republicans. When Trump will get 10% of Dems. 100m don‚Äôt vote, why offer them policy &amp; a reason to come out?

1306622477859196928 2020-09-17 23:54:09 +0800 <PartyofReason> @skyking517 @Amy_Siskind LOL #NeverTrumpNeverBiden in a heavy blue state. Now what? You move. Both suck and are going to kill us all - Biden just a little slower.
1306621134046101504 2020-09-17 23:48:48 +0800 <PartyofReason> @Amy_Siskind Biden is doing just fine tanking this election on his own. Those vapid tweets that say nothing are cringeworthy. Help from Russia isn't what's turning off Americans to the fact that Biden offers his base nothing but platitudes &amp; a return to the policies that delivered Trump.
1306618384788926465 2020-09-17 23:37:53 +0800 <PartyofReason> @VeroniquePerrot People who watch TYT don‚Äôt really thing Assange is the enemy. That‚Äôs the perplexing part to me.

But this lack of coverage, plus the way they didn't report that there was an #MPP convention happening August 30 until after it happened was really bad. They could've helped make it even bigger.
1306602985133428739 2020-09-17 22:36:41 +0800 <PartyofReason> @AnaKasparian hey @threadreaderapp can you unroll comments?

There are people canceling over this too, but there's practically unlimited sums if you seek investors. Cenk has a business to run, people that he's responsible for.

1306599719624376320 2020-09-17 22:23:43 +0800 <PartyofReason> @JCheruvathoor @NBotsk @AnaKasparian @tihuachang @DanielEllsberg Hate to tell you - VBNMW people still DESPISE TYT - even after they endorsed Biden. Just like they still can't stand Bernie. I'm done hanging around a bunch of people who fight against everything I stand for, demanding my vote. TYT even got denied a Press Cred for the convention.
1306596815874281472 2020-09-17 22:12:10 +0800 <PartyofReason> @JCheruvathoor @NBotsk @AnaKasparian @tihuachang @DanielEllsberg I think you're completely wrong about the TYT audience, and who they're trying to appeal to, but they probably realize that they've lost many Bernie-or-Bust-ers due to their endorsing of Biden. Don't see many MSNBC-watchers moving to TYT TBH. And I'm in the "TYT Army."
1306592866521636864 2020-09-17 21:56:29 +0800 <PartyofReason> @NBotsk @JCheruvathoor @AnaKasparian @tihuachang For "crimes" he committed (exposing the war crimes of the US Government) - when you have @DanielEllsberg testifying on your behalf, that's something that should be covered. Like it or not. Nothing to do with Russia. This is a freedom of the press case. It should interest TYT.
1306592258754408449 2020-09-17 21:54:04 +0800 <PartyofReason> @NBotsk @JCheruvathoor @AnaKasparian That's why this is so disappointing. They have a full time investigative journalist on staff, for crying out loud - @tihuachang. He, or ANY TYT employee, couldn't be watching the trial &amp; reporting on what's happening? Really? This has nothing to do with Russiagate. Extradition.
1306591861939859456 2020-09-17 21:52:29 +0800 <PartyofReason> @NBotsk @JCheruvathoor @AnaKasparian Julian isn't going to testify. That's a ridiculous assertion. They could easily make mention of it. It's borderline journalistic malpractice to their viewers to not even acknowledge it's happening. Instead, they'd rather make fun of Republican clowns. TYT has done journalism be4

Their names are every journalist who's been assaulted the past X months by the hyper-militarized cops for doing their job. They are more than just Julian &amp; Edward, but I would've liked her to mention them too. Still ‚ù§Ô∏è her
1306403358136205316 2020-09-17 09:23:27 +0800 <PartyofReason> @richimedhurst @MaxBlumenthal I think that's who she's talking about, brother. She'd be a vote to set him free for sure. Which is why the party stupidly acts like she doesn't exist.
1306401185537167361 2020-09-17 09:14:49 +0800 <PartyofReason> @1Dussy The post office could be financially self-sustainable with postage &amp; shipping alone if the mandate to fund their pension forward 75 years - something no other org in the world has to do. Congress knows that and won't do anything about it. Republicans block it every time.
1306400609227112449 2020-09-17 09:12:31 +0800 <PartyofReason> @TrawickMary @1Dussy @meows4all So do you WANT rates to go up? You're saying you want rural, majority-Republican areas to not have postal service, because FedEx &amp; UPS won't go there (not profitable enough)? Or pay 3-5x for the same thing that's Constitutionally mandated? I'm confused here.
1306399526127841280 2020-09-17 09:08:13 +0800 <PartyofReason> @TrawickMary @1Dussy @meows4all Actually, that was Darrell Issa's crusade. A Republican. One of the wealthiest ever to serve in Congress. He's a Republican. Sure, there are corrupt Dems, but the Dems aren't trying to privatize the Post Office, Mary.
1306396200497827848 2020-09-17 08:55:00 +0800 <PartyofReason> @cbgiff87 You feel that way because it's Republican.

But agreed Trump would continue to roll back protections. The Dems should definitely try to convince people that they didn't screw over yet, living in swing states.
1306257243747364881 2020-09-16 23:42:50 +0800 <PartyofReason> @LovesTheBern Agreed. But coal ash in water? Chemicals in the water? Will he fix Flint‚Äôs pipes? No. Lots of other areas the regulations have also been rolled back besides fracking that may be put back in place. But still not getting my vote

1306090576669016064 2020-09-16 12:40:34 +0800 <PartyofReason> @davidsirota It was all illusion. A bullshit fairytale story sold to us in school.

Just be slightly less awful than the Republican &amp; suppress other challengers, no policy necessary. But it‚Äôs a choice we all have to make, which we should do eyes open.
1302699717843877888 2020-09-07 04:06:30 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare Yet you‚Äôre telling people to vote for one.

1302698976513228800 2020-09-07 04:03:33 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare Voting for Joe, when do the Dems ever grt held accountable? All they have to be is a hair better than Republicans? That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre telling them to set the bar.
1302698662733271041 2020-09-07 04:02:18 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare Then the Dems should try to earn it. Because they‚Äôve kicked me in the gut, co-opted our leaders then told me to vote for their guy for class president.

1302628663834357760 2020-09-06 23:24:09 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare @OP_Omom @MMFlint We are beyond a solution. We are screwed regardless. Like Chris Hedges brilliantly explained at MPP last Sunday
1302627221471997953 2020-09-06 23:18:25 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare @OP_Omom @MMFlint No, but Biden supporters aren‚Äôt the remedy to blunting that momentum
1302621462726168578 2020-09-06 22:55:32 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare @OP_Omom @MMFlint Fact: blue states like mine are already basically decided, and there will be others on the ballot. Mark Charles, Howie Hawkins, Gloria La Riva &amp; more.
1302619810325508098 2020-09-06 22:48:58 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare @OP_Omom @MMFlint If the Dems wanted to crush Trumpism they would‚Äôve joined us in pushing for the candidate beat suited to tackle corruption to be their nominee.
1302619470628818950 2020-09-06 22:47:37 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare @OP_Omom @MMFlint Im in one of the safest blue states so Biden will win my state regardless. 40 out of 50 states are already decided
1302613448908513287 2020-09-06 22:23:42 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare @OP_Omom @MMFlint They also did it to protect their donors' fortunes, which brings us back to the whole problem. Joe wasn't anyone's 1st choice. Yet he's the nominee. How did that happen? Voting for Joe tells them you're ok with everything they did in this primary. And that they can keep doing it.
1302612159768268800 2020-09-06 22:18:34 +0800 <PartyofReason> @thetokensquare @OP_Omom @MMFlint Let me lay it out for you. We gave our time &amp; many donated money they could have used for important things to earn Bernie the nomination. Worked tirelessly for 4 years. Got millions excited. The Dems openly opposed him &amp; us only to prevent their own corruption from being exposed.

Who kneecapped Bernie's candidacy, primaried AOC &amp; Rashida, smeared Ilhan? Establishment Dems. And that was AFTER they all bent the knee to Biden &amp; signed off on the CARES act.
