Obama did not prioritize judges not even when he had the whole government.  These judges are right.  When you change laws w/o going through the legal procedures, aka the state legislature, then it is unconstitutional and should be rejected.

These states changed the laws w/o going through the legal way which is through the legislature.  The court rejected the changes b/c of the way it was made.  🙄

The bench is following tbt ale and the states who tried to the law w/o going through the legislature are the ones who are not following legal procedure.    Why are you lying?

1317245230073131010 2020-10-17 07:25:10 +0800 <sternergulch> @ltgins @BiasedGirl The fact that students have to pay more to so they can “fake pay” Joe Biden is a scam.
1317161950669922304 2020-10-17 01:54:15 +0800 <sternergulch> @BiasedGirl Apparently he has a title there and would come by when he was around, which sounds like never b/c a real professor was actually teaching the class.

You honestly believe MJ Hegar will beat Cornyn?  50% of people here still don’t know who she is.  And what’s wrong w/ LA?  It’s a great state, full of good people and delicious food.

Could it be b/c his bill put many of them away for something as stupid as a small amount of weed. I wish corn pop was alive to smack him upside the head

1316533084154720256 2020-10-15 08:15:21 +0800 <sternergulch> @Queenfreemarket This right here.  His son left his belongings and drugs in an abandoned rental car.  What happened?  He got a welfare check.  If we applied Biden’s laws, he’d be in jail, but he had a “my daddy is someone special” card that made him untouchable.

For ex, # of heart attacks &amp; stroke they’d seen, in the ER, had dropped dramatically even though people were still having which worried them more than covid.  Leadership &amp; media have been so irresponsible.

Even democrats did like how she came across in the primary debates which turned people off from her.  For me, it’s her prosecutorial records and failures as a prosecutor and AG.  She only wants to climb the ladder of power. Start w/ Jamal Trulove, George Gage

He stayed pretty moderate during the senate race and was never pressed to hard on certain things.  He made things very clear during his run for presidency.  His emotions were guiding his policies &amp; it showed.

1307760340688662533 2020-09-21 03:15:36 +0800 <sternergulch> @jtLOL When Dems lose the  Presidency: “abolish the electoral college” Senate: “make DC &amp; PR states to give us 4 more senators” House: push ballot harvesting  SCOTUS:  “pack the court &amp; add more judges”  Dems threaten to change the rules &amp; we, the American people, are held hostage.

It’s despicable especially when their are damn good nurses who have helped treat vile human beings such as murders and rapists b/c their oath is above all else.  The right thing to do.  Saving a life should not be political.  Thank you for what you do!

As a former teacher, it was 🤯.  They have a room for teachers, principals etc that have done horrible things but unions won’t let them fire so they just go collect a paycheck

Why was the WHO only telling us it was airborne in July????  I feel like Trump didn’t know what he was saying.  Maybe he meant droplets?
1303755397065576451 2020-09-10 02:01:23 +0800 <sternergulch> @bobmangold @Neoavatara So the WHO lied.  The WHO didn’t say it was airborne until July.

Without anyone willing to go on the record, it should not be printed.
1301873893410471936 2020-09-04 21:24:58 +0800 <sternergulch> @Mees_Moose @PurpleRain713 @StuckyFresh @RexChapman @fadde @JeffreyGoldberg @AlexDiPrato I’m looking at a single story. Fallen for what?  The 100s of “anonymous” stories w/ sources that have turned out to be false?  The fact this comes right before the election &amp; after a single poll floated out about DT losing military support?
1301853470409007105 2020-09-04 20:03:49 +0800 <sternergulch> @mickscal @ByronYork @JeffreyGoldberg is credible?  🤣🤣🤣 uh no
1301851669383258112 2020-09-04 19:56:39 +0800 <sternergulch> @Mees_Moose @PurpleRain713 @StuckyFresh @RexChapman @fadde @JeffreyGoldberg @AlexDiPrato He personally attacked McCain b/c he didn’t like him b/c McCains’s constant involvement to underhand and help him lose the election.  I never said it was okay what he said.  I do not believe he would randomly attack dead soldiers. “You people” 🙄
1301811125605015552 2020-09-04 17:15:33 +0800 <sternergulch> @AnaCabrera Ana, pushing more fear than fact.  Everything you post is just useless.
1301806053609353216 2020-09-04 16:55:24 +0800 <sternergulch> @colorblindk1d It’s so obvious though.  The poll came out about Trump losing military support.  Cue the hit job smear piece.  Biden then “disavows” and makes a promise.  Run ad.  This election season is going to be gross.

I have issues w/ McCain but it’s not w/ his service.  This is same shit.  Poll comes out he’s losing military support.  Cue the hit piece.  Cut Biden disavowing.  Run ad.  This is gross.
1301802582055190528 2020-09-04 16:41:36 +0800 <sternergulch> @HuffPost Perfect timing.  Put out poll saying he’s losing military support.  Run a hit job smear piece.  Cue Biden disavowing and running a ad.

Put out a poll showing he’s losing support, now it’s the military, then run a hit job.  Rinse and repeat.  Media is so toxic.  Who remembers Christopher Steele and his circular sourcing?
