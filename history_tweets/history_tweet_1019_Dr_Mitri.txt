1340749587204644864 2020-12-21 04:03:06 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> @PatriotForJesus has anyone else noticed that when you get a new follower your follower number does not increase?  Is this censorship from Twitter?  Happened to me again today!  #strange #censorship #Censorship2020
1340382299666468870 2020-12-20 03:43:37 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> Twitter friends...I have noticed oddly that I have gained several follower notifications over the past couple weeks, however my follower count has barely moved.  Have you experienced this?  I though it was conspiracy when people talked about this until I expected it personally.

1330900267244589057 2020-11-23 23:45:25 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> Thanksgiving 2020.  So thankful for my team.  Here is my message to them.  Hope it is an encouragement to you.  #Thanksgiving #thanksgiving2020 #team #leadership #wvstrong   https://t.co/bNngxUy958
1330551931878649856 2020-11-23 00:41:15 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> Thanksgiving week!  If this were today in many states two or three of these attendees would have to stay home. Which two would you pick?  Definitely Judas but who else?  Thomas - I doubt it. :) #Thanksgiving #Thanksgiving2020 #COVID #restrictions #biblicalhumor  https://t.co/x5tH2PEswu

1320115045536272385 2020-10-25 05:28:48 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> @MattWalshBlog I wrote an op ed in my local newspaper in Charleston, WV on this very topic a couple months ago.  Hope you enjoy. @wvgazette  https://t.co/bIPEUrg6QW

1314613590326943746 2020-10-10 01:07:58 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> @cspan This is tragic....not sure which is worse: the original tweet, the alleged hacking, the cover up of the tweet with alleged hacking, or the reality that we no longer have an independent press.  "Without evidence" @cspan has claimed this since he only "believes" he has been hacked.
1309168091478323202 2020-09-25 00:29:30 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> Don't disregard conviction the Spirit brings to you. If it's important enough to bring to mind, it is the very thing He is detecting in you. You were looking for some big thing to give up, while He is telling you of some tiny thing that must go. Matt 5:23-24
1306635380255531009 2020-09-18 00:45:25 +0800 <Dr_Mitri> God does not save us from temptationsâ€” He sustains us in the midst of them.  #graceisenough #stronggod #wvstrong #hebrews #Thankful
