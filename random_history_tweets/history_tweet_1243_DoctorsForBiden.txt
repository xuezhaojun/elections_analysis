1312584326131974145 2020-10-04 10:44:24 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> As news focuses on POTUS and Christie, please also remember the over 30,000 Americans who are currently hospitalized for #COVID19, many from our minority communities.

The #SuperSpreader ‚Äúevent‚Äù includes those parts too. This is why it‚Äôs important to follow rules always. Sad to say this was preventable, like so much in this pandemic.
1312445356160942081 2020-10-04 01:32:11 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> IMPORTANT message worth repeating this morning given concerns of #SuperSpreader event in Rose Garden
1312431277203689472 2020-10-04 00:36:14 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> We are extremely concerned about the lack of transparency about when the President tested positive.  The timing is absolutely relevant to be able to test, trace and isolate/quarantine those that have been exposed. Failure to follow these most basic guidelines puts people at risk.

1312241582939275266 2020-10-03 12:02:28 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Remdesevir is a drug that we use in hospitalized patients with #COVID19 who ARE on oxygen and can reduce the duration of symptoms.

For contact tracers to do their work, cooperation, honesty &amp;  transparency are key.   They will look at where Trump went &amp; who he was with, like Kelly Anne Conway who has now tested positive.  https://t.co/sAHc03umBC
1312204457770328064 2020-10-03 09:34:56 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> As we hear of more people testing positive for coronavirus after Judge Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs SCOTUS nomination at the Rose Garden, we worry this was a #superspreader event. To be safe, we recommend all attendees get tested AND quarantine even if their test is negative. #COVID19

1312141975655571458 2020-10-03 05:26:40 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> We do know Trump is at higher-risk of hospitalization based on his older age and being overweight.

1312130364811350016 2020-10-03 04:40:31 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Thank you @JoeBiden for being a champion of public health and for speaking to Americans in Grand Rapids #Michigan while wearing a mask.  "We can save 100,000 lives if everyone wears a mask in public...It's not about being a tough guy. It's about doing your part."  #WearAMask
1312098739062935552 2020-10-03 02:34:51 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> As doctors, we don‚Äôt care whether Trump used the word ‚Äúhoax‚Äù.  The truth: He consistently undermines health professionals and public health experts ability to counsel Americans about stopping the spread of #COVID19. We need a leadership who models mask wearing, not mocks them.
1312076414410280963 2020-10-03 01:06:09 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Trump's debate attack on Hunter Biden's struggles with alcohol and drug use was shameful and an attack on all Americans who have ever struggled with addiction.

1311895850872963072 2020-10-02 13:08:39 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> As Trump and FLOTUS have now tested positive, we want to remind everyone that #COVID19 is very real.  The virus does not care about your politics or who you are.    Please be careful and #WearAMask #watchyourdistance and #WashYourHands
1311856115701952512 2020-10-02 10:30:45 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> In our medical opinion, there is only one safe and responsible answer after Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus:   #QuarantineTrump...  well there is another...  #VoteHealth
1311849438478991361 2020-10-02 10:04:13 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> @loctastic @darakass Question is who was in close contact with her per the definition above.  People watching TV didn‚Äôt see all interactions so contact tracers absolutely do need to be involved.
1311847729212133382 2020-10-02 09:57:26 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> @loctastic @darakass To be considered a close contact he would have to be  &lt;6 feet away of Hope Hicks (who tested positive) for &gt;15 min.  Contact tracers definitely need to be involved and honest open reporting with contact tracers and following quarantine is critical to minimizing spread.
1311842521346080768 2020-10-02 09:36:44 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> IMPORTANT: As health professionals, we would like to remind all close contacts of White House official Hope Hicks, who tested positive for coronavirus and flew with Trump to a rally, that you will need to quarantine for 14 days.   #VoteHealth   https://t.co/hndX5CiI3u

1304427143640707072 2020-09-11 22:30:40 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> On this 19th anniversary of 9/11, we are thinking of all the first responders who lost their lives that day and the families and communities that lost someone they loved. We are thinking, too, of the sense of unity we had 19 years ago -- with hope that we can heal together again.
1304096485416538113 2020-09-11 00:36:45 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> We all want a vaccine ASAP. It's key for getting back to business, school, and community  But Trump wants to skip critical safety checks - just to say he got a vaccine approved before the election  Americans deserve better  #VoteEarly #VoteHealth   https://t.co/ejrgVv15OH
1304041026231980032 2020-09-10 20:56:23 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> That‚Äôs the kind of President we deserve.   There‚Äôs so much at stake here. More Americans can‚Äôt afford to lose more family members because the President does not care. #TrumpKnewVoteBlue #VoteHealth (/9)
1304041025313406976 2020-09-10 20:56:23 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> In every way, Joe is the polar opposite of Donald Trump.   He‚Äôs faced unimaginable grief and channeled that pain into purpose. (/8)
1304041024302579714 2020-09-10 20:56:22 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> We‚Äôve neither seen a plan, heard the truth, or witnessed anything but negligence from this administration.   While in stark contrast, @JoeBiden has provided several plans, spoken the truth, and demonstrated leadership and compassion to the American public.  (/7)
1304041023249801216 2020-09-10 20:56:22 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Enough is enough. The American people deserve a President who won‚Äôt lie to them about life and death situations.   The American people need someone who will be straightforward with them instead of purposely injecting disinformation into the news cycle and stirring chaos.  (/6)
1304041022243123200 2020-09-10 20:56:22 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> But instead President Trump intentionally misled the American people, all for political gain.   He admitted the virus was ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù, that it was more serious than a flu, but despite knowing all that he told the American people ‚Äú99%‚Äù of COVID-19 cases are ‚Äútotally harmless.‚Äù  (/5)
1304041021228175360 2020-09-10 20:56:22 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> It didn‚Äôt have to be this bad.   If Trump had acted just one week earlier, 36,000 Americans would still be alive. If we‚Äôd acted two weeks sooner, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. (/4)
1304041019944701954 2020-09-10 20:56:21 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> How many families are missing a loved one at their dinner table ‚Äî because of his failures?  More than 190,000 Americans have died and this President has shown no remorse, no compassion, no grief.  (/3)
1304041019013562369 2020-09-10 20:56:21 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> If Donald Trump had told the American people in public what he told #BobWoodward in private- thousands of lives could have been spared. (/2)
1304041018040426507 2020-09-10 20:56:21 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> This Impact of Lives Lost:  A President‚Äôs words matter.  #TrumpKnewVoteBlue #VoteHealth (/Thread)
1304030914222186496 2020-09-10 20:16:12 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> It‚Äôs not just the nearly 200k lives Trump‚Äôs lies and failure cost the United States. No, they crushed our economy on the scale of the great depression.   Help set it right - get working for Joe and Kamala today. #TrumpKnewVoteBlue #VoteHealth   https://t.co/kuk2g4DEsL
1304030328462471169 2020-09-10 20:13:52 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Acting just one week earlier could have saved 36,000 lives. Two weeks? 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. But Trump lied. Don‚Äôt let it happen anymore. #TrumpKnewVoteBlue #VoteEarly #VoteHealth   https://t.co/kSMehUB3NI
1303730440981929984 2020-09-10 00:22:13 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Nurses are facing a shortage of PPE. Our leaders should value the lives of healthcare workers.   Biden's plan guarantees that workers in all communities have access to masks and protective equipment so they can work safely. #VoteEarly #VoteHealth   https://t.co/TZTR5n2FQS
1303446500643614721 2020-09-09 05:33:57 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Moms and doctors (and doctor-moms) are teaming up for @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris to make sure America votes for a better future for our kids. Great brainstorming this afternoon with the amazing women leading @Women4Biden (@JillNash1) and @JoeMamas2020 (@JulieZebrak)!
1303376516445765632 2020-09-09 00:55:51 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> The right way to herd immunity is to distribute safe, effective vaccines  The wrong way is Trump putting politics over people, allowing millions of Americans to get infected and thousands to die  Thank you @DaraKass for the insights #VoteEarly #VoteHealth   https://t.co/AtULVAAhAB
1303337346386014208 2020-09-08 22:20:12 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> A former employee filed wrongful termination suit against Gov. Reynolds (R), alleging that her office withheld COVID information from the public. When the President denies science, others follow.

1303134395310772224 2020-09-08 08:53:45 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> This summer, Trump declared "victory" over COVID-19  But in August, 30,000 Americans died. On average, 44,000 Americans were in the hospital with COVID-19 each day  Biden and Harris find this unacceptable. That's why doctors are organizing to support them  #VoteEarly #VoteHealth
1302996648709234693 2020-09-07 23:46:24 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Happy #LaborDay2020! Today, we celebrate American workers. Our economy has suffered due to Trump's failure to address the pandemic, with 30 million currently unemployed. To help our economy recover, we must contain COVID-19 and elect new leadership. #VoteEarly #VoteHealth
1302957362144260096 2020-09-07 21:10:17 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> .@ActiveRetirees endorses @joebiden bc Trump betrayed seniors when he promised to eliminate funding for Social Security &amp; cut Medicare.   Prescription drug prices are higher now than in 2016 &amp; he has asked SCOTUS to strike down the ACA. #VoteHealth

1301916949040033794 2020-09-05 00:16:03 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> About 100 police officers have died from COVID-19 infection, more than all other causes of on-duty death in 2020 combined.  Trump‚Äôs new advisor is wrong on  ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù: mass infection will only put frontline workers at risk.  #VoteEarly #VoteHealth  https://t.co/3KXl1GZwMQ
1301866994346717185 2020-09-04 20:57:33 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Trump is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief. Our military service members, veterans, and families deserve far better. #BidenSupportsVets   https://t.co/KuAYU4w5jN
1301606769576284161 2020-09-04 03:43:31 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> We see 40K new daily cases of COVID with outbreaks in the Midwest. And flu season is coming   Trump wants to declare victory. Healthcare workers know: we're not winning. Not by a long shot. That's why we're speaking up this election #VoteEarly #VoteHealth   https://t.co/42SVcH80Au
1301527362308321282 2020-09-03 22:27:59 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> 72% of Republicans &amp; 82% of Democrats worry that Trump may prematurely greenlight a vaccine to advance his own political agenda  We need a vaccine that is trusted by Americans. And we need a President who puts people over politics. #VoteHealth #VoteEarly   https://t.co/rbFAl0LIPl
1301162983251488777 2020-09-02 22:20:04 +0800 <DoctorsForBiden> Trump wants to overturn the ACA and strip protections for HIV.

This was preventable.   Each student should make sure they #VoteHealth as if their health &amp; education depend on it. Because it does.   https://t.co/hVxO5zvK0v
