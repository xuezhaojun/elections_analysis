The surgery patient is responsible for 85-99% of the bottom line as they consume ancillary services like radiology and lab studies. So, putting them on hold destroys the bottom line. Elderly medical patients generally cost more than they pay because of Medicare.

Capacity is based on staffed beds not by gross number of beds. We are taking huge losses because of this and it will soon destroy healthcare as we know it. This will make it easy to bring in socialized medicine.

All masks become permeable when moist. It takes 5min for a cloth mask, 20min for a surgical mask and 2hr for N95 masks. Once moist, it’s easy to cross contaminate to self and others.

1341804984149499904 2020-12-24 01:56:52 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse The literature cannot give you a time frame when it will stop. Statements like indefinite infertility are listed as risks associated with the vaccine. Anything that changes cell function does fundamentally change it whether it is temporary or indefinitely. Too many questions.

There is no information on when this function stops, if ever. There is no information if this passes on to unborn children. There is no information to determine if the maternal response will target fetal tissue as a pathogen
1341801788156956672 2020-12-24 01:44:10 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse The current test can only tell you that it found a COVID virus. It cannot differentiate between COVID 19 or the common cold. Positive tests are reported by the tests NOT by patients. 1 patient can generate more than 1 positive test just to confirm the result &amp; to return to work.
1341800762641248257 2020-12-24 01:40:05 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse My aunt had Parkinson’s and was in hospice once her feeding tube was discontinued. My uncle had pneumococcal pneumonia. Neither were tested for COVID. There was no history of exposure. Both were expected to die as they were in their late 80s.
1341799539741585408 2020-12-24 01:35:14 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse The CDC numbers lump most flu and pneumonia cases into COVID. many deaths that have been labeled COVID were not confirmed, especially in the beginning. My aunt and my uncle both had COVID on their death certificate.

Can this response target a fetus by changing its immune response?  The answer is, we don’t know.
1341796304490352640 2020-12-24 01:22:23 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse H1N1, SARS 2, MERS and the common cold are COVID viruses. This technology has had multiple fails from the 90s to today. Broader use of RNA therapeutics for diseases where important proteins are missing or defective and mRNA treatments could be used to express a functional copy
1341794857602351104 2020-12-24 01:16:38 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse Once the RNA enters the cell it reprogram the cell to trigger and develop its immune response. We do not know when or if it can be stopped. There are too many unanswered questions to justify vaccine mandates. Especially, in children and those of child bearing age.
1341793536396541955 2020-12-24 01:11:23 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse For a disease that has a 99% survival rate, most likely even higher when miscategorized deaths are removed, to do mass scale vaccinations seems irresponsible. The drug companies have requested to be exempt from liability due to the lack of long term studies.
1341792391750012929 2020-12-24 01:06:50 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse evidence of their long term efficacy Since the RNA must enter the cell to effectively produce an immune response, it does change how our DNA functions. There are no long term studies to determine its impact on human reproduction and when it shuts off protein production.
1341791530445492224 2020-12-24 01:03:24 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse This antigen is then displayed on the cell surface, where it is recognized by the immune system. There is still a lot of work to be done before mRNA vaccines can become standard treatments, in the meantime, we need a better understanding of their potential side effects, and more
1341789698381946880 2020-12-24 00:56:07 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse An RNA vaccine consists of an mRNA strand that codes for a disease-specific antigen. Once the mRNA strand in the vaccine is inside the body’s cells, the cells use the genetic information to produce the antigen.
1341789400833818624 2020-12-24 00:54:57 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MarkEwoodruff @WhiteHouse RNA vax uses a different approach that takes advantage of the process that cells use to make proteins: cells use DNA as the template to make messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, which are then translated to build proteins.

Both vaccines permanently changes the human genome and there are no long term studies evaluating its safety and its effects on reproduction. Hard pass.

The air is filtered with heptafilters, surfaces are cleaned with high level disinfectants &amp; UV light. When masks are used outside of that setting they can become a health hazard as all protective measures are gone.

Every time a person touches something &amp; then touches their mask, they have contaminated their mask and anything else they touch after touching their mask.

They are a known source of nosocomial infections. Hospitals can lose their license if mask protocols are lax. There is a rise in bacterial pneumonia as a result of mask use. The #s are counted as CVD
1340320291642253312 2020-12-19 23:37:14 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @ScottAdamsSays Once a mask is moist it becomes very permeable. Pathogens that are on the mask are held by your airway for constant inhalation, making the mask wearer sick. This is why more people died of bacterial pneumonia from dirty cloth masks than the Spanish flu in 1917. The CDC knows this

Now, visits with your doctor are interviews while they type. Little eye contact or in-depth questions. They follow what’s on the screen. They have lost their ability to look at a pt for clues.

Dirty masks are one of the most monitored and regulated PPE that we wear. Cloth masks are moist in 5min, surgical masks are 10 min and N95s are 2 hours.

1338367982607585281 2020-12-14 14:19:27 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MrAndyNgo This really should be an easy fix. But, Ted Wheeler and Kate Brown are in on it.

1338349902674325507 2020-12-14 13:07:36 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @StateofusAll The Mederna vaccine uses the same technology. Without long term studies, anyone of child bearing age and children should take a hard pass.

1338344821044350976 2020-12-14 12:47:25 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @KurtSchlichter I don’t think it’s does anyone any good to diminish anyone’s hard work.  People are easily confused the title of doctor is used outside of academia. Just as a chiropractor using the title of doctor. It is really our job to know the difference before assuming their specialty.

When infertility for an indefinite amount of time is listed a possible side effect we all should be worried. Additionally, RNA based vaccines fundamentally change the human genome. I’m not an anti-vaxer either.

They cannot differentiate between COVID 19 and the common cold. That is why the CDC cannot give us cold and flu numbers. They are all COVID viruses.

There is no long term data on the effects on human reproduction. Big pharma has ensured they have no liability and they know it can cause indefinite female sterility.

This is a very slippery slope my friend. It is up to us to know what works and what is acceptable risk. HCQ in general is safer than Tylenol. Tylenol is one of the most dangerous drugs on the market.

So, destroying our economies is the way they forces us to become dependent on the government while they instill a communistic government. This is scary $hit.

Most positive patients will have a repeat test to confirm and another to be cleared to go back to work. The test is positive for all COVID viruses. It first differentiate between COVID 19, 2 or 5.

They include flu, cold and pneumonia. In addition they used COVID codes on patients that were in hospice, car accidents and ones with multiple co-morbidities. 1/2

One positive person may generate 2-3 tests to confirm the original diagnosis and/ or return to work.  The test only tells you that you are + for a COVID virus. It could be the common cold, COVID19, SARS, MERS. H1N1 etc. We are being fed a big lie.

1327727152423337984 2020-11-15 05:36:35 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MikeyMulkey It means it’s cold &amp; flu season. Many cold &amp; flu viruses are COVID viruses. The tests being used can only tell it’s a COVID virus. It doesn’t differentiate between COVID 2, 5 or 19. Additionally, most people that are + will have more tag 1 test. The number are tests not people.

The first time I heard Pelosi use the term it triggered a memory of when we used the drill in Portland many years ago. Then Biden, Harris and Schumer used it, I thought they were signaling for action. Now all blue states are locking down.
1327640391147896832 2020-11-14 23:51:50 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Doophenshmirtz @iamwandasykes We are becoming political prisoners in Democratic led states. This needs to end. The term Dark Winter is a mass casualty drill scenario for a bio terrorist attack. Last OR Gov interrupted programming to review the states CERT plan.  https://t.co/ZNM92CenRQ

During the Spanish flu pandemic most who died, died of bacterial pneumonia from using cloth masks, not from the Spanish flu. Masks are one of the most highly monitored &amp; regulated POE used in healthcare for this reason.
1327506082177056768 2020-11-14 14:58:08 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> We are now political prisoners of the lefts need to lockdown blue states over bogus COVID numbers. Last week OR Gov Brown went on tv to go over what is the state’s mass casualty plan. Dark Winter is a term used for bio terrorist drills.  https://t.co/ZNM92CenRQ
1327503278054141954 2020-11-14 14:46:59 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @matthewstoller Look up the term “Dark Winter” that is currently being used in the Dem’s echo chamber and see who is like Hitler.  https://t.co/ZNM92CenRQ
1327469470701420544 2020-11-14 12:32:39 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> Like the Boston Tea Party we need to have the COVID mask party and dump masks on the steps of the states that are locking down based on bogus data.

The tests being used only tell us that you have a COVID virus. It doesn’t tell us that you have COVID 19 or the common cold. So, these huge numbers are not close to being correct.
1327262175409307648 2020-11-13 22:48:56 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @dmorgado @JamesTodaroMD Read up on the polio vaccine efforts by Gates and the WHO in Africa. Over million have contracted the disease using an experimental vaccine. Now the synthetic virus is spreading faster than the wild strain. This is the kind of mistake that happens without good studies.
1327260768878751747 2020-11-13 22:43:21 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @JamesTodaroMD Pfizer’s vaccine is an a RNA based that changes the human genome-same with Mederna.  There are no long term studies of the impact in reproduction in child-bearing population. Without that information mass vaccination for a disease with a 99.9% survival rate is irresponsible.

Masks are dirty &amp; are one of the most monitored PPE used in healthcare because they can be a major source of nosocomial infections. Without good guidelines they are a bigger risk than benefit.

1327029338793906176 2020-11-13 07:23:44 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @catturd2 Lastly, I have heard Biden, Pelosi, Schumer &amp; Harris use the term “Dark Winter” a couple of times. This triggered a memory from years ago doing mass casualty drills in healthcare. Here’s a link on what “Dark Winter” means and why we should be concerned.  https://t.co/ZNM92CenRQ
1327025098058915841 2020-11-13 07:06:52 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @kcirpgnikcuf @catturd2 Those testing positive are likely to be tested at least one more time before they are released to normal activity. So divide the total in half if not by 3. There is so much more that is being done to give the appearance of huge spikes.

I have been an OR nurse for 35 years. I  research &amp; write policies. Then educate teams for accreditation. I am a certified infection control specialist too. They have been lying to us.
1327022684698406912 2020-11-13 06:57:17 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @catturd2 COVID viruses die off in the summer because they are not stable able in heat &amp; die in UV light. The lockdowns &amp; indoor mandates blew our chance to let nature take its course and cleanse the environment. We did NOT follow science. Fauci mislead us and didn’t use science to end BS!
1327021651981004800 2020-11-13 06:53:11 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @catturd2 Another fun COVID fact. The tests used only tells you that you have a COVID virus. It doesn’t tell us if it is COVID 19. The common cold is a COVID virus. This is cold and flu season when spikes occur. So, these spikes are not necessarily COVID 19. It could just be a cold.
1327020724385505280 2020-11-13 06:49:30 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @catturd2 Masks are one the most highly monitored PPE and their use is strictly regulated in the healthcare setting. Why? Because they are very dirty and are a major source of nosocomial infections. Wearing without understanding this only harbor &amp; spreads pathogens to yourself and others!
1327001720686211072 2020-11-13 05:33:59 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @tedcruz @Trump_Girl_USA @AOC If there is such concern to require a manual recount of the Presidential race, why wouldn’t that facilitate a manual recount of all races?  Especially with two run off candidates. It would spare a second election and the cost associated with it.
1326999611395825666 2020-11-13 05:25:36 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot Honestly, if there is widespread fraud all races should be recounted.

The Founding Fathers were wise in their mandate to include the separation of church &amp; state in the Constitution. The Pope is in bed with Globalists. By doing so he leaves much of the flock behind and ignores the most basic teachings.

The term “Dark Winter” that has been used by the left’s echo chamber several times is from a bio terrorist attack drill used healthcare for mass casualties set up by Johns Hopkins.

1326387942714200066 2020-11-11 12:55:03 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @prayingmedic @NataliaDarrigo I have heard Biden, Pelosi and I believe McConnell use the term “Dark Winter” a couple of times.

1326268798882639872 2020-11-11 05:01:37 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @b4iknew There are many COVID viruses that cause colds &amp; flus. The current test tells you that you have a COVID virus. It cannot differentiate between COVID 19 or any other COVID virus. This is a huge scam. We are also seeing increases in bacterial pneumonia from using dirty masks.
1326213298790961155 2020-11-11 01:21:04 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @JonathanTurley With severability, the ACA risks death as it’s too expensive &amp; will open the market to more affordable plans that have higher deductibles for catastrophic coverage. For many that is more appealing. Pay cash for an annual visit &amp; limit your risk on major medical events.

1323854421860642818 2020-11-04 13:07:44 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @newsbreakApp I think this fails to recognize is that taxpayers pay the salaries of most teachers. There should be some level of performance expected and the Union has failed to create a system that recognizes its customers. They are entitled.

We are governed by many strict policies as they are just as dangerous to those that wear them as to those at risk of cross contamination if policies are not upheld. Mass use is never indicated and was a bad decision.
1323097891758505985 2020-11-02 11:01:34 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @FrederickGale1 The number of positive tests are just tests. Each person that tests positive will generate 2-3 tests before they will test negative to be cleared. So, even the number of positive cases is sky high.  Then, the CDC has no good flu and pneumonia numbers. We are being conned.

1322607902884966400 2020-11-01 02:34:31 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @drvancouver @IngrahamAngle Mask use is selective science. We have decades of research that shows wide spread &amp; prolonged use of dirty masks are very dangerous to the user &amp; is a source of infections in hospitals. It the reason mask use is heavily regulated by policy and compliance is documented monthly.
1322605124875776001 2020-11-01 02:23:29 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Emytrousdale @IngrahamAngle Even N95 &amp; KN95 are only good until they become moist &amp; permeable to everything they come in contact with. Cloth masks are good for 5 min, surgical mask is about 20min &amp; N95/KN 95 are about 2 hrs. The other issue with masks is that bacterial growth cause bacteria all pneumonia.
1322602297252179969 2020-11-01 02:12:15 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @NancyDeLuca11 @Dago70_2 If socialized medicine is ushered in as Medicare for all, our entire health system will crash. We lose money on every Medicare patient we care for. The loss is greater with Medicaid. It takes the private insurance to keep private practices afloat.

1321934908311285761 2020-10-30 06:00:17 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @BreitbartNews President Trump has declared a favored nations position for all medications and will impact all insurance plans, not just Medicare. Insulin went from $700 per month to $45 per month. His proposal impacts all Americans.

1320430796646174720 2020-10-26 02:23:28 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot I am concerned about the vaccines that are being tested are RNA based.  These vaccines will change the human genome. There hasn’t been enough testing to know the long term affects, especial for those of child baring age. What will this do to the human race? I’m not an anti-vaxer.

I was stunned that these mask mandates were being promoted without any training on their proper use and disposal.

1320235356785000448 2020-10-25 13:26:52 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot You’re correct. OSHA requires each employee to complete a 15 page health history. If the employee has one positive response they must be cleared by a physician before they receive a mask N95 or higher. Think about that when you see the elderly wearing one in the grocery store.
1320224722580238336 2020-10-25 12:44:37 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot Masks hold inherent dangers if not used and disposed of properly. In healthcare we have many policies regarding mask use including required monthly surveillance for quality reporting. Requiring masks was very irresponsible, especially without specific training.

1320060286452207616 2020-10-25 01:51:12 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Bidnow73 @realDonaldTrump The state holds and uses that information. However, that is scrubbed before sending it to the CDC. So, the CDC cannot link multiple tests from one patient. If you look at the bottom of the screenshot it states that identities are not sent to the CDC just results.
1320059382646796289 2020-10-25 01:47:36 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Bidnow73 @realDonaldTrump The CDC hasn’t given us a good number for flu and pneumonia cases and deaths for 2020. Even in Canada, they show 6 deaths from the flu and none for pneumonia.
1320059184864350208 2020-10-25 01:46:49 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Bidnow73 @realDonaldTrump There were also a million test kits sent out from the CDC that had been contaminated with the positive reagent that is used to calibrate the analyzer. The tests kits aren’t specific to COVID 19. So, the test can be positive for all types oof COVID viruses.
1320057427098693632 2020-10-25 01:39:50 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Bidnow73 @realDonaldTrump You also might want to take notice of is the way the media reports the increases as a percentage. So, last week you can have 2 positive test and this week you have 4. That means you have a spike of 100% from one week to the next. You don’t know if those are new or retests.
1320056607619698688 2020-10-25 01:36:35 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Bidnow73 @realDonaldTrump Once you remove the identifiers, you cannot match them up once they are sent to the CDC. The local health departments have a better handle on the numbers. Another issue in reporting is that you don’t even have to have a positive test to report it as COVID. This is very flawed.
1320055197138219008 2020-10-25 01:30:59 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Bidnow73 @realDonaldTrump Here is a screenshot from the CDC website on reporting. Notice towards the bottom we have to remove identifiers before we send it. The state uses the identities for contact tracing but not for reporting. It is redundant and confusing.  https://t.co/4dnsrXqh05  https://t.co/c1l5swVmtc
1320052550897332224 2020-10-25 01:20:28 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Bidnow73 @realDonaldTrump It’s how we report them from test sites.  We just send positive and negative results.  Additionally, you don’t need a positive test to report a death as COVID. So, anyone with the symptoms at death can be classified as a COVID death without a test.
1320041203463712768 2020-10-25 00:35:22 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @ChuckCallesto This is nothing short of idiotic and unscientific. This is just more fear mongering.
1320038491225423872 2020-10-25 00:24:36 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @realDonaldTrump The number of “cases” equal the number of positive tests. One person can generate 2-3 positive tests as they need a negative test to go back to work. Additionally, the CDC haven’t isolated both flu and pneumonia cases either. The numbers being reported are much lower than stated.

We have seen an uptick in staph pneumonia and impetigo just to name a couple. Touching a dirty mask and touching something else will spread the pathogens to another person.

1319674830287896582 2020-10-24 00:19:32 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @kirstiealley Because of the costs, choices in ACA plans have been limited by states. Many states have only one or twi carriers because many insurance companies don’t offer any plans in specific regions because they are not profitable even with the Obama kickback, they lose money.
1319674176387510274 2020-10-24 00:16:56 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @kirstiealley The ACA created another class in healthcare. The mandate forced people to buy the least expensive ACA plan with high monthly premiums that they cannot afford to use because of the sky high deductibles and copays.

By doing so, we have a bigger pie to cut from. Whereas, you will have to cut a larger piece of a small pie to get the same amount.
1319471734966214657 2020-10-23 10:52:30 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @DLoesch This was a missed opportunity to talk about premiums and deductible have gone up between 100-500%. Thus, making access to healthcare unaffordable.

Yesterday I’ve 200 were killed and over 100 the day before. They have shutting down power and are just shooting into the crowds. The protestors have been peaceful.

ICE &amp;DHS need to detain the Nigerian President unless he stops the killing of peaceful protestors.                                               RETWEET! RETWEET!  https://t.co/HhTIsCwhgF
1318718836141559808 2020-10-21 09:00:45 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> This was from yesterday. Last night the Nigerian army, privately hired thugs and SARS shut off all street lighting, removed &amp; destroyed any camera and started shooting, killing &amp; injuring peaceful protestors.

Long term use can be dangerous.

1318470955199393792 2020-10-20 16:35:46 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Sen_JoeManchin Fauci &amp; Gates have ownership interest in some of the vaccine corporations. Fauci &amp; Bill Gates sent taxpayer money to China to fund C19 research. The President is right to call him out regarding conflicts of interest &amp; flip flopping on lockdowns &amp; masks. It’s time to end the game.

When in fact herd immunity is achieved by the transmission of the disease along WITH vaccination to make it sound like a sinister plot.

A cloth mask is permeable in about 5 min, a surgical mask about 20 min &amp; N95 mask is 2 hr. Touching a mask can transfer pathogens to &amp; from the wearer when they touch the mask &amp; then surfaces.

Because it takes what we call in surgery a “sterile conscious” to use them without cross contamination. Improper use of masks spreads pathogens.  https://t.co/peod3qaSsJ

However, the primary research demonstrates how HCQ penetrates the the virus. He also withheld information on HIV which cost many lives. One of the co-researchers keeps being silenced.
1310472835958099968 2020-09-28 14:54:06 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 You were my 1000th follower. 😂

1310456949473832960 2020-09-28 13:50:58 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @ScottAdamsSays Trump is real estate. There is a ton of eligible front loaded and rapid depreciation expense that is written off. It is then added back when the asset is sold.
1310456230834401280 2020-09-28 13:48:07 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 What is happening here is nothing short of criminal.
1310455612413628416 2020-09-28 13:45:39 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 The Soros funded DA just lets them go and doesn’t even charge them with any crimes. He needs to be disbarred.

1310453249690853377 2020-09-28 13:36:16 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 I grew up here and it was such a beautiful and safe city that has been turned into a $hithole from liberal leadership. It’s so sad.
1310453002893811712 2020-09-28 13:35:17 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 I’m 20 miles from Portland OR ugh!!
1310447811842904065 2020-09-28 13:14:39 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 This whole thing pisses me off. It never made sense. And, if we want to paint a picture of who has blood on their hands go no further than Fauci.
1310443360230891520 2020-09-28 12:56:58 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @charliekirk11 SDNY?
1310442519629455361 2020-09-28 12:53:38 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 We meaning CDC and WHO. Fauci was the author of the research in 2005.
1310441725672841217 2020-09-28 12:50:28 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 Sadly, they could have used HCQ for SARS and MERS they knew that it was effective for both and didn’t share the information.
1310441398361927681 2020-09-28 12:49:10 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 Agreed. These governors prohibiting the use of HCQ are practicing medicine without a license. It’s ironic the Africa has done a better job managing COVID than more “developed” nations because you can purchase HCQ over the counter for malaria.
1310437717046517762 2020-09-28 12:34:33 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 We have a 15 page health history to complete before we can issue a N95 mask to an employee. If one question in the health history is positive a physician must clear the employee before they can use one. Now consider that when you see the elderly wearing them.
1310436996054089728 2020-09-28 12:31:41 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 Ignored and buried because it does meet their needs. Hospitals can lose their licenses if staff do not follow very strict policy and monitoring of mask protocols. It was irresponsible to mandate to the general public without proper education.
1310434407409307648 2020-09-28 12:21:24 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @d_forch @SpeakerPelosi Clearly you do not understand depreciation expense.
1310434231407968256 2020-09-28 12:20:42 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @iamsunshine78 @SpeakerPelosi For what?
1310434096795975680 2020-09-28 12:20:10 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @SpeakerPelosi There was no abuse. Tax laws were used to calculate his taxes. Let’s see yours.
1310433569941024768 2020-09-28 12:18:04 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @gatewaypundit Seems as if the SDNY leaked Trump’s tax information just before the election &amp; are coordinating with the MSM and the DNC to smear the President. However, rapid depreciation expense can applied legally to offset taxes. It is then added back at the time of sale. Nothing burger 🍔
1310427838705668098 2020-09-28 11:55:17 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @realsled @HolliGlendenni2 @LatulippeSteven I agree. The fact that it’s a minor, the information should be handled as if it’s protected.
1310427407594135552 2020-09-28 11:53:35 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 We have thrown away decades of research on best practices because this has been politicized. There are much more dangerous pathogens than COVID that are being ignored.
1310427067314446336 2020-09-28 11:52:14 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 The misinformation campaign is criminal at this point. Quarantining healthy people is insane as it diminishes healthy immune systems. Only those that are at risks should take precautions. Washing your hands is the best prevention of spreading all diseases.
1310426480745177088 2020-09-28 11:49:54 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 The data is so corrupt on COVID. There is a lot of data on masks and how they transmit bacteria &amp; viruses to the person wearing. And, the cross contamination that occurs when you touch the mask &amp; touch other items. Now the CDC is saying COVID is not spread via airborne droplets.
1310425640265367552 2020-09-28 11:46:33 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PoetryPatriot @7mdk7 I think the biggest issue is the over reporting because the numbers are based on tests conducted vs. by the patient. If you look at the past numbers of pneumonia and flu deaths you could pull an average year from the COVID deaths as they have been commingled into the data.
1310416404647043072 2020-09-28 11:09:51 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Alyssa_Milano You should know your history before making such idiotic statements.
1310413896075804673 2020-09-28 10:59:53 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @realsled @HolliGlendenni2 @LatulippeSteven These entities should have signed a Business Associate Agreement that binds them to HIPPA. It would be prudent to keep any &amp; all medical records confidential. Did the parents/guardian give permission to publish the information. Not enough detail to make the call.
1310406969472110595 2020-09-28 10:32:22 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @HolliGlendenni2 @LatulippeSteven If the child/patient is identified by name it would fall in a gray area of HIPPA. However, making them public would seem questionable as well.
1310390678094897153 2020-09-28 09:27:38 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @BernardKerik @gatewaypundit The DA needs to be brought on charges and disbarred. This is BS. He is ruining my hometown.
1310370850164494337 2020-09-28 08:08:50 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @SenSchumer There is nothing affordable about the affordable care plan. It double our premiums, co-pays and deductibles. And of the 10% that are buying Obamacare plans, most can’t afford to use it because the deductibles are so high.
1310361092082688000 2020-09-28 07:30:04 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Robertl01464344 And, MSM is ignoring it as usual.

1310072381038157829 2020-09-27 12:22:50 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @tiogamom1 It isn’t up to Cuomo. If people want access to the vaccine he should have absolutely no say in their healthcare. Just as these liberal governors signing executive orders against the use of HCQ
1310053990206328832 2020-09-27 11:09:45 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @tracied51 So, they are denying these folks their Constitutional rights of free speech.  While BLM and ANTIFA show up with the only intent is violence.

There are so many more pathogens that are more dangerous than COVID 19 that are being introduced into our bodies by poor practices of wearing a mask.
1309873391126544384 2020-09-26 23:12:07 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @LatulippeSteven These mask mandates have been the most dangerous and irresponsible provision throughout this plandemic. Most do not realize the training and policies that are in place in regards to the use of masks because of the potential for nosocomial infections.

One person can generate 2-3+tests in an effort to be cleared for work. They should be counting the number of people that test positive, not the number of positive tests. This practice inflates the numbers dramatically. FRAUD!
1308968244221485056 2020-09-24 11:15:23 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @TheRealKoala2 @CHIZMAGA It’s not a mistake when the police are being shot by the perpetrator. It was self defense.
1308963465273380864 2020-09-24 10:56:24 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @TeaBoots I’m speechless.

1308941807334506497 2020-09-24 09:30:20 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @piersmorgan You absolutely correct!
1308912376528408581 2020-09-24 07:33:23 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Acosta And, President Trump is absolutely correct.

1308625779182379008 2020-09-23 12:34:33 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @SenSanders No Bernie it’s not. Read R v. W. It is very broad and gives women the right to make their own medical decisions. It doesn’t carve out aborts. And it’s not a Constitutional amendment.
1308621190794113029 2020-09-23 12:16:19 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Brash_1 It’s gives power back to the woman for all medical procedures and gives women personhood instead of a subservient role to their spouse. It’s never been specifically outlined in the Constitution. Other than the inalienable rights given to all men.
1308620362364592129 2020-09-23 12:13:02 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Brash_1 R vs  W is written quite broadly to ensure that woman  have the right to make medical decisions for themselves. It doesn’t specifically cover abortion rights , but it doesn’t exclude them either. It’s flaw is that it assumes that ones husband has more authority over the wife.
1308578484487254019 2020-09-23 09:26:37 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @LatulippeSteven Taking away the one thing that the elderly enjoy is visits from their family when they need them the most. Despicable!
1308577599098990593 2020-09-23 09:23:06 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @w_terrence Even her birth certificate states she is Caucasian. Both parents were 50% Caucasian. Maybe Kamala she do a DNA test like Elizabeth Warren did. The fact that Warren was willing to do a DNA test, my guess is that she believed that she was American Indian.
1308576570072657920 2020-09-23 09:19:01 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Brash_1 Abortion isn’t a Constitutional right.
1308576221865811968 2020-09-23 09:17:38 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MrAndyNgo If fascist aren’t allowed, the ANTIFA and BLM aren’t invited.
1308567210684628992 2020-09-23 08:41:49 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @SenFeinstein When nominating Garland you didn’t have the votes because you didn’t control the senate. If you were in the same position today &amp; controlled the senate you would do the same thing. After the way you treated Justice Kavenaugh you don’t deserve any courtesy. STFU
1308543951431852032 2020-09-23 07:09:24 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @BullPup2A There is no Muslim ban. Won’t Joe be surprised.
1308540893138305024 2020-09-23 06:57:15 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Nobodybutme17 I guess the Trump march in Canada the other day with over 70k attendees really pissed her off 🤡🤡
1308540196351172610 2020-09-23 06:54:28 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @RepStevenSmith If you don’t want children don’t have sex without birth control.  Then there is the morning after pill that prevents conception as well.  This is called taking responsibility.
1308538946800893952 2020-09-23 06:49:31 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @SpeakerPelosi Out of that number less than 10k actually died from COVID. The rest had multiple comorbidites and were over age of 75.  You were trying to impeach the President on BS charges &amp; encouraged us to go the Chinatown &amp; Mardi Gras.  Dem governors sent infected people to nursing homes🤬
1308507351553466368 2020-09-23 04:43:58 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @thehill @realDonaldTrump With how Kavenaugh was treated and all of the new threats of violence, it seems reasonable.
1308455264622972928 2020-09-23 01:16:59 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MissILmom @Patriqtscott Sounds like a declaration of war and anyone pushing this needs to be forcibly from office and charged with treason.

1308235186090377216 2020-09-22 10:42:28 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MayorJenny You allowed the occupation of Seattle, vandalism, looting, assaults and arson in the city you swore to uphold. That is criminal and abuse of power. You need to resign.

1308192036227436549 2020-09-22 07:51:01 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @sekouking @kirstiealley Republicans owned the senate and the presidency. Therefore, there was no hope to get the votes needed to confirm.
1308187831353749504 2020-09-22 07:34:18 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @amyklobuchar We voted for our president and he isn’t finished with four year term. After, how you treated Justice Kavenaugh you and the others that accused him of unsubstantiated heinous crimes need to sit down and shut up.

1308148191422865413 2020-09-22 04:56:47 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @SenSchumer After the way the Dems have treated JUSTICE KAVENAUGH &amp; a DULY ELECTED PRESIDENT there is no reason to treat them as anything but hostile. Pelosi &amp; Biden have said to expect more violence. ANY elected official that incites violence needs to be removed from office immediately!
1308147177823191040 2020-09-22 04:52:46 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @ScottyPatriot1 @gatewaypundit I hope the school system understands why the BLM agenda is completely inappropriate to include in a school curriculum. This needs to end.
1308096511369076736 2020-09-22 01:31:26 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Brash_1 After the way the Dems treated Kavenough they do not deserve any courtesies when it comes to appointing a Supreme Court Justice. And, by the way they treated President Trump, he should get a third term.
1308095232639033344 2020-09-22 01:26:21 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @HTodd01 @texasrecks The man should have never been charged.

1308087305727389696 2020-09-22 00:54:51 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @BreitbartNews Dems would do the same thing. The difference between now and then was the fact that the Dems were the minority in the senate and didn’t have the votes to confirm Obama’s nomination.

With what is happening in our big cities &amp; the fires started by domestic terrorist organizations, anyone condoning these horrible and treasonous acts needs to be charged for their role in these acts of treason.

So, until we have an actual patient numbers, none of these numbers accurately represent the actual number of people that contracted C19.

The more you step outside of your known belief systems, the more likely you will go into an understanding and tolerant person to the beliefs of others. As the old adage goes “ you can lead your horse to water, but you can’t make them drink”.

Some have appropriated it to represent an ugliness. There is only one American Flag &amp; it needs to be revered &amp; respected. As, it still stands as a sign of freedom.

As, I try to read our friend’s tweet about power and nudity I see a woman in her mid 20s where physical attraction is given an a higher value than education and experience.

I wish young woman would develop their mind and independence before having children. Children are amazing but need examples to develop themselves. As we age, we all recognize that our beliefs change with education and experience.

1306387799864606720 2020-09-17 08:21:37 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @kaijuichi @TheRightMelissa There is a build up of bacteria and other pathogens being held directly against the face.  Everything you touch and then touching your mask is then placed by your skin and airways. There are much more dangerous pathogens than COVID 19. Do some light research and learn something.

1306385469341532160 2020-09-17 08:12:22 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @kaijuichi @TheRightMelissa Wrong. I’ve been in the OR for 35 yrs. a basic surgical mask becomes permeable in 20 min. That means any pathogen can transfer through the mask at that point because it’s moist. A hospital can lose it’s license based on how the staff handle masks. They become that dirty quickly.
1306383213510537216 2020-09-17 08:03:24 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @kaijuichi @TheRightMelissa We are also required to get new masks every time we leave the OR, see a new patient, when it’s soiled, and don’t reuse the masks day after day. Bacteria and fungus grows within 2 hours. There is also an increase in staphylococcus pneumonia because of long term use of dirty masks.

1300855936278355968 2020-09-02 01:59:58 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @gaye_gallops @Preciouslindy Recently, the SCOTUS ruled against Soros organizations rights under the 1st amendment because they are considered foreign entities &amp; are not entitled to protections under the Constitution. This opened the door to designation as foreign terrorist and election interference.

1300828414538993664 2020-09-02 00:10:36 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @IngrahamAngle @tedwheeler @realDonaldTrump They need to take down Kate Brown and the Portland City Council too. Otherwise true change will escape the city and its citizens.

1300814483783213056 2020-09-01 23:15:15 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Acosta His donor list and your endorse indicates that he is.

They use the exact same language. Please read on some of the recent resignations from these media organizations and why they left. You sir are anything but woke.

ANTIFA and BLM are the new Brownshirts and the useful idiots don’t even know they are just pawns in an effort for history to repeat itself.

1300806052481396736 2020-09-01 22:41:45 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @jhduffy44 @SaraCarterDC Jim, please take the time to look up the donors on all candidates. You will be shocked to see the financial influence of George Soros and Bill Gates. Please read up on Soros especially and ask yourself if you want to see history repeat itself.
1300803409700769792 2020-09-01 22:31:15 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @ArmyRangerRick Please be armed. This is my hometown. It was a beautiful, fun and safe city until Ted Wheeler and Kate Brown started tearing it apart. It began with the homeless, legalized street camping and drugs. Be safe.
1300802144249946115 2020-09-01 22:26:13 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @blackhat_1 @ChrisCuomo This started when Hillary lost. Remember Resist?  That was a call to war by the Democratic Party because they tried to sell our country to our enemies. Trump didn’t start this the Dems did. But, they will not prevail. This country belongs to the citizens not politicians.

1300800610661363714 2020-09-01 22:20:07 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Acosta You mean like major donors like George Soros who donates to the most liberal of these politicians that are allowing their cities burn. By the way, ANTIFA are the new Brownshirts. And Soros, the old Nazi is trying the finish what he began in Germany. That’s a real news story,.
1300799224427114497 2020-09-01 22:14:37 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Oheythere53 @thehill All senior citizens with multiple co-morbidities will be vulnerable regardless of where they live and travel to whatever viruses are active. And, it is their responsibility to do the things to make themselves safe-as it should be. To stop the world has done damage beyond belief.

1300794892570902528 2020-09-01 21:57:24 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @Brash_1 Sadly, the little f**kers will be released on bail today and back on the streets for another night of rioting.

1300792079484768256 2020-09-01 21:46:13 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @MrAndyNgo @tedwheeler This gives Ted plausible deniability that has inaction allowed the riots and these fascists get out of control. I don’t see the same damage to his and threats of physical harm that the rest of the city and citizens have experienced. He has supported ANTIFA and BLM for years.
1300652678557495297 2020-09-01 12:32:18 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @realchrisrufo I’m so sorry. I have watched my home town of Portland turned into a live $hit$how every night. This has to end.
1300643375142416384 2020-09-01 11:55:20 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @hill_danita @WhiteHouse You clearly haven’t read the latest CDC results. You’re argument is dead in the water
1300591956121194496 2020-09-01 08:31:00 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @JackPosobiec Biden just said expect more violence if we elect Trump. WTF!
1300590241909100544 2020-09-01 08:24:12 +0800 <KerryOLeary4> @PlutoDad I love you too.  My kids are grown productive adults that don’t live in my basement asking me to bring them a juice box and sammich.
