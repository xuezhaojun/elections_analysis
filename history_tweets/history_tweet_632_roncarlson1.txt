If true, why would retirees require a COVID stimulus check from the government? More money should go to unemployment benefits.  I'd appreciate civil comments. Much thanks.

You seem to intimate that you have never said "good morning" in the afternoon or visa-versa? I don't like liberal policies or many liberal politicians, but if this was the best you could come up with you need to try harder. IMO. Thank you.

Then these pols go to outdoor restaurants &amp; eat.   https://t.co/Lja1PGaYch

There is much more to this story than just the original story from @newyorkpost - Red Hook Seafood is getting a bad rap on this.

1333846168988598272 2020-12-02 02:51:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal I did a quick search &amp; found student failures have increased drastically as reported in VA.

1328522638268923905 2020-11-17 10:17:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 People say Trump divided the country and Trump is the reason for so much hatred.

1324515596445249537 2020-11-06 08:55:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie @RudyGiuliani @pnjaban Hi Katie: I don't know this @GregRubini but I went to his twitter feed and he didn't provide any sources for his claim of 9.7 missing votes. I searched the internet &amp; I couldn't find any info on 9.7 mission votes in California. Would you happen to have a source?
1324514449785417730 2020-11-06 08:50:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie @RudyGiuliani @pnjaban Actually that is not true. I vote conservative down the line. I contribute to conservative Pols in Calif when I can. I send emails to my representatives voicing my concerns, but they go nowhere because all happen to be Liberal. What else should I do?
1324513508726251520 2020-11-06 08:46:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @alexmjordan @PG_46 If this holds then Biden would win, correct?
1324512715142950912 2020-11-06 08:43:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CovfefeKatie @RudyGiuliani @pnjaban I concur but I think ultimately our vote counts in Calif. At least we got some of the props shot down &amp; we got 22 approved. As far as politicians go, there's way too much of a blue wall in the state that 4 the time being our votes 4 politicians don't matter. Maybe someday.
1324394624878747648 2020-11-06 00:54:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> @reallouiehuey I believe he could but IMO he would be too old. That said, I would totally be in favor if one of his children ran.

My personal opinion is I'm not going to believe anything until the 4th estate makes their announcements. That said, if they numbers you posted here are correct, that is a good sign. :-)
1323725732242055168 2020-11-04 04:36:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Mommie_03 I don't think you will see any "results" until either 5pm PST or 8pm PST. I believe the policy is results are not announced so that they don't affect states whose polls have yet to close.

1323675787946418177 2020-11-04 01:17:55 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Liz_Wheeler Ms. Wheeler - Do you have any way of determining who is voting in this poll? Conservatives or Liberals?  I actually hope President Trump wins but I clicked Biden because I didn't want to jinx President Trump. Thank you.

1320397711640686592 2020-10-26 00:12:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> I don‚Äôt watch @FaceTheNation or  @MeetThePress very often because I find shows, routinely bias against conservatives, IMO. I watched today &amp; there was no mention about @nypost expose about #Hunterbidenlaptop or #JoeBidenUkraineScandal  Media conveniently keeps story from viewers.

1320381120781807623 2020-10-25 23:06:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @darksecretplace All of this is happening due to the horrible liberal policies of California politicians. Includes Props 47 &amp; 57 and AB 109, in addition to high taxes and horrible business climate.  All Calif voters must vote ‚Äúno‚Äù this year on all Props except 20 &amp; 22   https://t.co/BPvW9KPgN1

1320378237831110656 2020-10-25 22:54:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> IMO one of the major issues affecting California‚Äôs demise is its horrible tax business climate. Taxes taxes taxes are driving many businesses out. How do politicians not see this? Vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on all props except 20 &amp; 22. &amp; vote Democrats out of office.    https://t.co/d4LfQlbU44

1318583836066803712 2020-10-21 00:04:19 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Timcast why is it we almost never see the camera pan out to the crowds at #BidenHarris rallies?
1318571164126433287 2020-10-20 23:13:58 +0800 <roncarlson1> @WAFC88 @heckyessica I actually believe it has nothing to do with our tax dollars. Especially when they said this won‚Äôt happen under Biden / Harris. Again, my belief.
1318570689389940736 2020-10-20 23:12:04 +0800 <roncarlson1> So have I. In fact I‚Äôve lost all respect for @TroyAikman and @Buck and my disgust for #NFL just goes lower and lower.
1318561924116668416 2020-10-20 22:37:15 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump You have my vote sir!!
1318395881884852227 2020-10-20 11:37:27 +0800 <roncarlson1> @PeteButtigieg I did. I voted for @realDonaldTrump and Republican across the board in California @GOPChairwoman @CAGOP #RecallGavinNewsom
1318395525830299648 2020-10-20 11:36:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CNN continued to display their liberal bias and they are not even ashamed of it.

1318363845736370178 2020-10-20 09:30:09 +0800 <roncarlson1> @CBS_Herridge @CBSNews These R not debates. A debate is when 2 people square off against each other. Not when a moderator asks 1 person a question then other person another question &amp; then only provides 2 minutes 2 ans before cutting them off. A person can him-haw for 90 seconds &amp; never provide answer.
1318290532733341697 2020-10-20 04:38:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BazinetTeresa @johnkartch I didn't see the quote, but he may be correct. The only salary he has ever had was the 47 years he was in political life. He never had a "salary" that high.
1318290164867756032 2020-10-20 04:37:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> These debates are so rigged. Just liked everything with the @DNC The #PresidentialDebateCommission appears to be in the tank with the liberals &amp; #KristenWelker is as bias as they come. Horrible...Horrible.
1318289718824423425 2020-10-20 04:35:36 +0800 <roncarlson1> So, Doctor Fauci #AnthonyFauci needs body guards to do a power walk?? Why gawds name did they have to get the press involved? Maybe he does need bodyguards, I don't know but publicizing with a photo op reeks of BS to me.   https://t.co/lMBBXGOsem

1317279282071171072 2020-10-17 09:40:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> I believe liberal media is saying the polls R favoring Biden by great numbers because they want Conservatives 2 think there‚Äôs no chance 4 Trump &amp; 2 not vote.

1317260359644839938 2020-10-17 08:25:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> @nytimes again doesn‚Äôt give honest info.

1317235720461799424 2020-10-17 06:47:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Ccantoon1 Then let‚Äôs tag  @SavannahGuthrie so maybe we will know how horrible and bias she was during this town hall. IMO she was a disgrace but, sadly I expected nothing else. #NBC was horribly bias.
1317232613229092864 2020-10-17 06:35:02 +0800 <roncarlson1> I thought the #nbc thing with Trump was supposed to be a town hall. For the first 20 minutes this ‚Äúreporter‚Äù has been slamming trump. What the hell!!!! Here are the citizens???
1317229632811225089 2020-10-17 06:23:12 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am now watching the Trump town hall, tape delayed.

He is getting away with it. He is doing whatever he wants to do. He keeps changing the rules. We need to make it stop. Recall Gavin Newsom now!!

1316917280828198912 2020-10-16 09:42:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> End of #Biden Town Hall.  Not one question on #HunterBidenEmails not one question on debate moderator #Scully lying about his twitter being hacked or about moderator bias against Trump. Were these forbidden by @ABC . (#Scully &amp; #ChrisWallace) Some decent questions but not hard.
1316914468132212738 2020-10-16 09:30:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> I live in California. I was in a store today &amp; got into a discussion with a black man. Yeah, he‚Äôs a Steelers fan &amp; I‚Äôm Pats, but he said he‚Äôs no longer voting Democrat, based on how bad Calif is now &amp; how scary he believes the Democrats in the nation are. That was good to hear.

1316912350000304128 2020-10-16 09:22:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepVernonJones @JoeBiden @GStephanopoulos IMO, There would not be any big long running headlines if he says he ‚Äúwill not‚Äù pack the Supreme Court. Only major headlines if he ‚Äúdoes support‚Äù packing. To me, that is an answer right there. I believe he is in favor of packing the Supreme Court.

1316908420797255686 2020-10-16 09:06:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AlexMillerNews Another non answer. There would not be any big long running headlines if he says he ‚Äúwill not‚Äù pack the Supreme Court. Only major headlines if he ‚Äúdoes support‚Äù packing. To me, that is an answer right there. I believe he is in favor of packing the Supreme Court.

1316841958157873152 2020-10-16 04:42:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> It appears to me that @NBCNews #NBC caved to the wine community and will not be showing the @realDonaldTrump tow hall until 8:00 pm. How bloody sad. Shame on you #NBC

1316153012620984320 2020-10-14 07:05:05 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LAPDHQ Make the district attorneys, prosecutors and politicians ensure people who commit crimes are not let out without bail. Repeal props 47 &amp; 57. Lock up offenders. Then you‚Äôll see the crime rate go back down. Making an actual crime not a crime isn‚Äôt reducing the crime rate. IMO.

Also, we seem 2 B seeing much more mail thefts than previous. Unless previous mail thefts have not been reported. I do believe thefts are related 2 the mail-in ballots.

1315706675660165120 2020-10-13 01:31:30 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AnnetteGH86 I concur. But maybe, just maybe, we'll turn a bit purple.
1315706461016584192 2020-10-13 01:30:39 +0800 <roncarlson1> Would someone please tell me why every Judiciary Committee member has to have their own speech at the SCOTUS nomination? I know one answer is because they like to hear themselves talk, but is there an official reason they all bloviate? Much thanks to those who provide answer.
1315648518971822084 2020-10-12 21:40:25 +0800 <roncarlson1> @AlexMillerNews Do you think this confirmation hearing has any impact on Graham's re-election? I do not. The confirmation is almost assured and his supporters realize this. Hard to believe Harrison raised $57M. I've contributed to Graham but I can't contribute that much. üò≥ Hoping Graham wins.

As far a I‚Äôm concerned, there is as much interest in baseball as there is any sports and I will remain that way fit me until sports gets back to being sports and gets away from this ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù they out themselves in.

1314029039728750592 2020-10-08 10:25:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> The left media will say Harris won and the right media will say Pence won. Such is the way with wickedly bias media...Both sides. The American people must decide for them selves and not rely omg the media.

It of late I‚Äôve come 2 believe The Vatican is just a puppet of a larger sinister group &amp; now believes it has the power &amp; backing, from someone, 2 attempt 2 change a capitalist society

Shame on you for your power grab and for lying to your constituents. Hopefully, they will realize you do not speak the truth.

However, I have not watched it in the past six months and every time I see #ChrisWallace on any shows I am very sadly disillusioned. #ChrisWallace no longer appears to be impartial. I don‚Äôt plan on watching @FoxNewsSunday again.
1312776537477795843 2020-10-04 23:28:11 +0800 <roncarlson1> @BrandonStraka @ILovedat Sadly, it is what hateful media does. When good things are happening, many in MSM do whatever they can to exacerbate anything negative, no matter how minor. Good will prevail. Great work you are doing.

1312495236866691072 2020-10-04 04:50:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @DbigOrion @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump IMO, pandering is saying similar things ever 4 years as Democrats do. Pres.Trump talks the talk &amp; walks the walk. The difference between Democrats &amp; President Trump is the Democrats just ‚Äúsay‚Äù things every 4 years while President Trump actually does things he says he will do.

I don't like they have bias people as commentators &amp; I will only watch @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle &amp; @seanhannity going fwd. Was UR intent was 2 lose viewers?

1312433854146256897 2020-10-04 00:46:29 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Pismo_B @ILovedat @FoxNews I have to disagree with this. I believe in God and I support all those who have other beliefs. However, I don't believe that any news outlet should be doing these things on public air time. New Media should report the news. Thanks for listening.
1312431567961088006 2020-10-04 00:37:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @vmsalama Why won't you actually name the "source" so your comment can be verified?

1311852079271477249 2020-10-02 10:14:43 +0800 <roncarlson1> @ridersd49 @SenKamalaHarris Many people on the right have apologized for things they have said and the left didn‚Äôt let them slide. I believe the only time any politician apologizes is because they got caught. I believe mostly what they say is how they feel. BOTH sides.
1311850735965929472 2020-10-02 10:09:23 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Breaking911 I do blame the media. I blame @johnrobertsFox because the question has been asked and answered ad nauseam.

1311725397881487360 2020-10-02 01:51:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am not well versed at all on the process for vetting a SCOTUS nominee but wasn‚Äôt Judge Coney-Barrett vetted two years ago for District Judge?

1311690406925492224 2020-10-01 23:32:17 +0800 <roncarlson1> If these reporters continue to interrupt @PressSec when she is answering questions I foresee the briefings being stopped. The @whpressscorps better get a hold on this.
1311689534459928576 2020-10-01 23:28:49 +0800 <roncarlson1> These reporters at the White House briefing are horrendous. @whpressscorps

1311679855419781120 2020-10-01 22:50:22 +0800 <roncarlson1> Is this the world we want? Were people cannot express their views in a civil manner without being punished for it just because they support Trump?? @QuinnSimmons9 - So sad this happened to you. üò¢  https://t.co/F2Tjxn7Gog
1311506455799894016 2020-10-01 11:21:20 +0800 <roncarlson1> @LAPDHQ I am just an avg citizen. I don‚Äôt know politics or reasons leaders make decisions but I believe letting prisoners out early no cash bail very lax punishment 4 some crimes leads 2 increased crime rates. If we don‚Äôt fix broken windows more damage occurs. Keep up great work @LAPDHQ
1311493667434110976 2020-10-01 10:30:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am looking forward to the senate hearing because I don‚Äôt think the Democrats will be able to help themselves. They will ask questions that will make them look more bigoted and horrible.

1311488320388567040 2020-10-01 10:09:16 +0800 <roncarlson1> @realDonaldTrump fully supports school choice.

That strategy must end. Thank you.
1311454938250190848 2020-10-01 07:56:37 +0800 <roncarlson1> @hearing_nelson @JoeBiden IMO he never will becuz the liberal leftist Dems also supported KKK, segregationist &amp; Robert Byrd. I‚Äôm waiting 4 other people who‚Äôve been adversely affected by these people 2 say ‚Äúenough is enough.‚Äù Every 4 years Dems pander 2 people who‚Äôve  been affected, counting on their vote.
1311400107024154624 2020-10-01 04:18:44 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Alyssa_Milano - I'm pretty sure you won't respond but I sincerely hope you do. #Trump has denounced White Supremacy time and time again. Why won't you admit this? Thank you  https://t.co/p6tyZHOZRe

1311398074644754432 2020-10-01 04:10:40 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RefladyData @the1murdock Yes, he was arrested on a Carjacking incident on 09/16 and the DA just announced this morning he is being charged with the LA Cop shooting. I can't find a source to that yet.
1311397178686889985 2020-10-01 04:07:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @the1murdock I'm starting to believe, for the past few years now, the death penalty in California is BS. It only provides the prisoners with better accommodations, (I believe) and we spend bunches of money on appeals. I say "Life and a day" in prison with no possibility of parole at all.
1311393759247036417 2020-10-01 03:53:31 +0800 <roncarlson1> @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Prove it.  Unless you're saying "If Joe Biden were the president China would not have loosed the virus on the world."

1311391648329297920 2020-10-01 03:45:08 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Ilhan I would be willing to wager, if everyone spoke honestly,  they would take all the tax deductions they legally can. If what Trump did was legal, according to the tax laws, then he has every right to take advantage of those laws.
1311391115338158082 2020-10-01 03:43:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Adorable_Todd I can understand voting for a 3rd party. In 2016 I totally didn't want Clinton and was real worried about Trump so I voted for Johnson. I voted because it's my right and, IMO, my duty. Also, I feel, if I don't vote, I don't have a right to complain.
1311345296530501632 2020-10-01 00:40:56 +0800 <roncarlson1> @HelmholzW @larryelder @AOC I agree.
1311345200267223041 2020-10-01 00:40:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Crozierguy @larryelder @AOC Sir: How many times does Trump have to condemn white supremacy? Does he have to do it every single time he's asked and if he doesn't people just say he doesn't condemn it. He has condemned it!!!   https://t.co/fwi8NwoRsN

1311174068385714176 2020-09-30 13:20:32 +0800 <roncarlson1> @4MiddleAmerican @rdargnews @JoeBiden Trump did the same thing. He was texting while on stage.
1311136962284191744 2020-09-30 10:53:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @Liz_Wheeler I say no one won. I voted Trump because I wanted to see the results.
1311136435026583553 2020-09-30 10:51:00 +0800 <roncarlson1> Well, so much for @JoeBiden supporting the #GreenNewDeal   He flatly stated he does not support the #GreenNewDeal.

1311121544882528256 2020-09-30 09:51:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> Trump does need to tone it down a bit. @GOPChairwoman

1310996034928087040 2020-09-30 01:33:06 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SJPFISH @mollyday15 I am so hoping all the #BLM protests, street blocking, disrupting people's ability 2 get 2 their jobs backfires on them so hugely that President Trump is reelected in a landslide, Republicans increase seats in the Senate &amp; take the House. I hate when protestors disrupt my life.

He did a 90 minute briefing / question &amp; answer session with PBS a couple of weeks ago and he didn't do badly at all. I think the @TeamTrump campaign lowered the bar too much.

He's lied many times in his career, when it helps "him".  https://t.co/anXUxs09tR  https://t.co/Vj9IqbzzCX
1310256604034465792 2020-09-28 00:34:52 +0800 <roncarlson1> @JoeBiden has said twice already in his speech (see below) that people "..are voting right now.."  Maybe this should B a reason not 2 have early voting well over 30 days before elections. IMO, early voting is a very bad idea. It should be done away with.   https://t.co/swGjNYOgdI

When all the athletes start showing the same kind of support for all the white people killed by black people then I will probably start respecting their causes. I have never seen any celebrities condemn thugs for killing white people. That is racism!!!

But on another note, if the Democrats in California are going to use the ballot harvesting, how can we not expect the Republicans to do so also? If it were outlawed, no party could use it.

If I were a cop and the man continuously refused to stop and reached into his car and I had no idea what was in the car I would have shot him multiple times.

Are cops supposed 2 wait until the bullet is coming towards them before they defend themselves? Pls do a search on ‚Äútraffic stops that end in shootings‚Äù &amp; C how often it happens

1306059330320359424 2020-09-16 10:36:24 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi do not care about the American people. The Republicans are offering a quick fix bill right now for the American workers but the Democrats are saying, "....sorry, not enough. It's all or nothing..." The @DNC @TheDemocrats don't care about us!!!
1306058685098029062 2020-09-16 10:33:50 +0800 <roncarlson1> @rad_republicans Probably right after he does the no holds barred interview with Chris Wallace like @realDonaldTrump did.  @JoeBiden doesn't have the courage to do any hard interviews. He is afraid!!!!

But I also heard they @JoeBiden #JoeBiden #JoeBiden2020 campaign said they "couldn't find a workable time to do a similar interview" (paraphrasing) Just like they couldn't find a time to meet with Chris Wallace.

That said, did U happen 2 C the video I posted about the traffic stop that turned in2 a shooting. Driver escaped officer's grasp, got 2 his car door, reached in &amp; came out with gun firing @ them. #LEO in Blake case had no idea what was in the car.

1305893025122410497 2020-09-15 23:35:34 +0800 <roncarlson1> @RepCohen Y don't U criticize #HillaryClinton 4 saying #JoeBiden shud not concede election at any cost but U criticize the "possibility" of Trump not standing down when this situation was "never" said by Trump. Reason I don't believe many people is becuz they always talk on only 1 side.

I have not seen any briefing by #JoeBiden that happens after the late afternoon. Why???
1305573855000313856 2020-09-15 02:27:18 +0800 <roncarlson1> @SoCalValleyGal and if not for the outstanding medical capabilities of our EMTs, Doctors and nurses, how many more of these shooting victims would have died??

Keep the Anthem &amp; when enuf "fans" decide not 2 watch games, league officials will realize the mistake they made. If they take away the National Anthem, they have no chance at all of getting me back as a fan.

1303518491836739586 2020-09-09 10:20:01 +0800 <roncarlson1> I am watching @TuckerCarlson (recorded) and he is tearing up Jeff Zucker of CNN and Michael Cohen. He will continue tearing up CNN tomorrow night as he goes after Cuomo‚Äôs interview process!!
