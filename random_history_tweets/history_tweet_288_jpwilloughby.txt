1344069691875192839 2020-12-30 07:56:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We got tired of being screwed by whoever was in power and after a long and exhausting process determined that @realDonaldTrump would always do the opposite of that, so we delegated to him the authority to make our lives better.
1344051308257562624 2020-12-30 06:42:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The GOP establishment threw @realDonaldTrump overboard and now they're getting booted out of office. Instant Karma! Shouldn't have taken everything Trump did for them for granted.
1344049583517790210 2020-12-30 06:36:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. Vote em' down. @senatemajldr has got to go! Make @SenTedCruz minority leader.
1344048374631309312 2020-12-30 06:31:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDailyWire How much you want to bet it was staged and there was nothing but saline in that shot?
1344047157188431875 2020-12-30 06:26:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @elonmusk I've figured it out. It's all about trying to create intersections of basic shapes. Circle, cross, plus, square, short line, star.
1344046287918944263 2020-12-30 06:23:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @willchamberlain Because they're establishment hack grifters. Power corrupts.
1344045990295298048 2020-12-30 06:21:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> These people. Always another excuse to shut down businesses and capitalism.

1344045295752122368 2020-12-30 06:19:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tedcruz in a good mood today as @senatemajldr saved him from a tough vote.
1344045072489308161 2020-12-30 06:18:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EmeraldRobinson Yeah. Fiscal conservativism my a**. They can always find money for foreign countries and government pork. But only chump change for Americans.

1343983324537171968 2020-12-30 02:12:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Vote. Them. Down. In. Georgia.
1343959333827182594 2020-12-30 00:37:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec I imagine this would be a tough sell for @SenTedCruz.
1343959092377878528 2020-12-30 00:36:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> After a few months of @SpeakerPelosi and @JoeBiden in charge, we're really going to want to elect some young fresh-faced people. @PeteButtigieg and @TulsiGabbard on the Dems side. Republicans TBD.

1343816816435589122 2020-12-29 15:11:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump won, period, end of story. The election was obviously stolen. Now are any of the cowardly politicians who are supposed to be on our side going to do anything about it?
1343816583672717312 2020-12-29 15:10:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "National security" is a code word for the #DeepState establishment. It means government security.

1343778761305677824 2020-12-29 12:39:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He certainly shouldn't rubber stamp fraudulent results!

1343763013380288515 2020-12-29 11:37:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze And guess who's buying the products and services of that labor? Yup, US corporations. Just another reason we need tariffs and American labor instead of foreign replacements.

1343706285473226753 2020-12-29 07:51:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SenTedCruz, what say you? You gonna stick with Trump and populists or the establishment and fiscal restraint?
1343705972477480960 2020-12-29 07:50:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I will say this is an interesting precedent. Will people keep voting for politicians who give them a check from the government? At least it's better than them spending that money for you (on their own interests). Tax refund!

1343217079890169865 2020-12-27 23:28:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Then it's welfare and blatant redistribution of wealth. You're stealing from workers only. Definition of socialism.
1343216557942599683 2020-12-27 23:25:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The electors from the states where fraud overturned the results of the election must be objected to on Jan. 6th. Then @vp must not open the seal and count the votes from those states where the results are in question.

1343059206522474496 2020-12-27 13:00:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Yes. And bill China for it!
1343059019662024705 2020-12-27 12:59:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is my president. Cheatin' @JoeBiden is not my president.
1342996704438726668 2020-12-27 08:52:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump @58163 Ok, but how?
1342996317665185798 2020-12-27 08:50:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... AT&amp;T. Verizon I guess? T-Mobile only has good coverage in high population density areas.
1342990422264700930 2020-12-27 08:27:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr vs @realDonaldTrump is going to be an interesting fight. Bye bye Republican majorities! You lost your working class base.

1342978947705954315 2020-12-27 07:41:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Selfish? It's not selfish to not steal from other people. That's self-less.
1342978616079118336 2020-12-27 07:40:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I did, sold it. WAY overpriced right now. Might buy after it crashes.

1342955439634472963 2020-12-27 06:08:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The average household salary in America is $60k. The average # of kids is around 2. You pay about 35% of that in all forms of taxes. So every person should be getting $60k / 4 = $15k / 3 = $5k as a refund for the financial damage the government has caused with lockdowns.

1342860568412221443 2020-12-26 23:51:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump How the hell could any court argue that @realDonaldTrump does not have standing? He was clearly and directly harmed by the fraud.
1342859622336622592 2020-12-26 23:47:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES! That's $2000 per person in America.

1342316987901468672 2020-12-25 11:51:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And go back to plundering working class Americans and growing government as you did last time when Obama was president. Time for a new party.

1342316124621447169 2020-12-25 11:47:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @RobWittman Actually, if we're not doing the foreign aid, then we can up it to like $6000 per household. But of course you crooks and globalists in congress would rather use that money for your own purposes.
1342315835008970753 2020-12-25 11:46:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump @RobWittman How about we both NOT spend the money on foreign aid AND spend it on the American people? Ok guys? Not hard.

1342131714257260553 2020-12-24 23:35:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Huh? Last I checked Dems had the majority. So some Dems blocked it.

1341923390999900160 2020-12-24 09:47:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @gwtiawah @bennyjohnson @TrumpStudents I think Biden will be seated as president. But I will say this, I think the odds of Trump overturning the fraud are a lot higher than I did at first. The election was clearly stolen. It may be a close vote in Congress on Jan 6th.

1341911529051090946 2020-12-24 09:00:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ewarren Just call it the #DeepState refund checks. They've been plundering you for years.

1341908801180626947 2020-12-24 08:49:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec I'm not too sure about the others, but PLEASE @realDonaldTrump, pardon @Snowden for Christmas! It would be perfect. He is the original fighter against the #DeepState which was spying on Americans to control us.
1341908198333313024 2020-12-24 08:47:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank They will not. The left in the #DeepState had no basis for these political persecutions.
1341907874654679040 2020-12-24 08:45:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What's despicable is the unjust way these perfectly innocent people were persecuted by the #DeepState. While he's at it he should pardon @Snowden too.

1341607323802849280 2020-12-23 12:51:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is exactly why he should veto it.
1341607192659709952 2020-12-23 12:50:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JennaEllisEsq I tell ya man, that @JoeBiden is a one cat dog!
1341606969807941632 2020-12-23 12:50:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How you get vaccines to a small town in Minnesota? It's called @FedEx, @SenAmyKlobuchar. Yay capitalism.
1341606336774156288 2020-12-23 12:47:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay!
1341605856673226752 2020-12-23 12:45:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I love when the line politicians have been towing gets all twisted up. Hilarity ensues.
1341605458591801346 2020-12-23 12:44:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ChadPergram So @realDonaldTrump is making deals with populist Dems now to oppose @JoeBiden and the establishment? LOL genius.
1341605163279257602 2020-12-23 12:42:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup, sounds like Dems. If they can't take your money and spend it for you, it's an "attack" on you. Ridiculous!
1341604817031065607 2020-12-23 12:41:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What if... this was all choreographed? Maybe Trump knew establishment Republicans would object to giving money back to people, so he made this deal with Pelosi and put the crap bill on the table first, knowing he could gin up outrage to it? If so, a billion dimensional chess.
1341604395348336640 2020-12-23 12:39:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara I mean technically true, because he will be dying. But not from COVID, since he got the vaccine.
1341604204113252355 2020-12-23 12:39:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SpeakerPelosi Also, @SpeakerPelosi, you do realize that this is a tax refund, right? Government spending on other things has to be cut to make it work.
1341603925959557120 2020-12-23 12:37:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> OooooK now I'm completely confused. So why didn't the House pass $2000 originally???
1341603660812464130 2020-12-23 12:36:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pence? What can he do?
1341587912425680897 2020-12-23 11:34:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ChadPergram Excellent. Pocket veto it is.
1341587812366381056 2020-12-23 11:33:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MattWolking @MZHemingway Literally every single one of them is under investigation for something. Joe, James, Hunter, that niece with the DUI, etc #BidenCrimeFamily
1341587165453709313 2020-12-23 11:31:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LindseyGrahamSC @ARmastrangelo @realDonaldTrump We need to emphasize that this is a refund for all the taxes you pay. Not just federal. State tax, sales tax, property tax, vehicle registration fees, etc etc etc
1341586763882655744 2020-12-23 11:29:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> As he should. Like a good president who is serving his base.
1341586313762451457 2020-12-23 11:27:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We were already starting to peak, but the roll out of vaccines in hospitals should help stop the spread even more.
1341586110976307202 2020-12-23 11:27:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What. The Hell. Is Happening? @realDonaldTrump and @aoc on the same team fighting the bipartisan establishment?
1341585796122501128 2020-12-23 11:25:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. His base is solidly behind a veto (and who wouldn't be when they're just stealing from us to give our money to foreign countries?) He will veto it.
1341585249323630592 2020-12-23 11:23:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So what did he do? Sounds like a possible extortion attempt.
1341577812076015616 2020-12-23 10:54:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No.
1341577648326238208 2020-12-23 10:53:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *Prevent Dems from stealing the election.  YES do it shut the government down until we can figure out what the hell is going on.
1341577351788937216 2020-12-23 10:52:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL because Iran loves @realDonaldTrump. You guys, they've moved from "Russian collusion" to "Iranian collusion". Ridiculous!
1341551315395162113 2020-12-23 09:08:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you could win on one agenda item despite a hostile @JoeBiden administration, but only one, what would you choose?
1341550972980654082 2020-12-23 09:07:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good. Hopefully we can drag this out two years.
1341550767497502721 2020-12-23 09:06:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SaraCarterDC Socialism is slavery. You have to give all your money, the product of your labors, to the collective, which goes to enrich lazy bureaucrats.
1341550468171001860 2020-12-23 09:05:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Can confirm it is rolling out to hospital workers.
1341550166332084226 2020-12-23 09:04:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ARmastrangelo Yes. This is key. It's not handing out free money if the government took it from you first. It's a refund.
1341549751142133763 2020-12-23 09:02:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Ericbryant5 @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump What recourse do we have? Sure, we can stand up another Tea Party and take the House in two years. But a lot of damage can be done in that time. We may never recover financially.
1341549492659744768 2020-12-23 09:01:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Br61Tex @jennfranconews Well yes. Obviously. I just thought it was funny how he said that.
1341547962036596743 2020-12-23 08:55:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What the hell are we going to do without @realDonaldTrump? It's clear @senatemajldr will not place any sort of check on @JoeBiden. Democrats will cave to their worst instincts and no one will stop them. Time for mass protests in the streets. #Resist
1341546959056875523 2020-12-23 08:51:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump It's scary just how much awful crap is going to happen if @realDonaldTrump is forced out of office and the brakes are off. Hold on to your wallets!
1341546489659744257 2020-12-23 08:49:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good. Shut it down. After the insulting theft they want to foist on us with that bill? Shut it down.
1341546347527323648 2020-12-23 08:49:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Just veto it.
1341546286600904704 2020-12-23 08:48:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jennfranconews LOL "or else the next administration will have to deliver a COVID relief package. And maybe that administration will be me."
1341544999004106759 2020-12-23 08:43:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jennfranconews @realDonaldTrump is exactly right. Congress would rather give $1400 of your tax money to foreign countries than let you keep it.

1341532585873338380 2020-12-23 07:54:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wow, if @elonmusk can launch a 100 person spaceship for $2 million, that's only $20,000 / per person. How many people would pay that for an extravagant vacation to space? My guess is a lot of people. Gonna be a lot of launches, and a lot of spaceships.

1341420647633829889 2020-12-23 00:29:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How the hell are we supposed to fight back when Dems lock us down, kill all our businesses, and ship all our jobs to China. Are we just supposed to starve? We can't even strike.

1340734674939899906 2020-12-21 03:03:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DailyCaller But I mean yeah, democracy dying in darkness is exactly who they are. God forbid they report any real news.
1340734513190678530 2020-12-21 03:03:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL @JoeBiden not far left enough for the MSM
1340719177158541316 2020-12-21 02:02:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is not over. We have just begun to fight. The next 4 years will be all out WAR against the globalist establishment elites that seek to subdue and control us.
1340711681568235520 2020-12-21 01:32:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL amazing what a poll showing a close race can achieve.
1340693765066022913 2020-12-21 00:21:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's not "investing". That's racism.

1340320700977057793 2020-12-19 23:38:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And this is precisely the problem. The president is not a therapist, mother, or lover. He is the commander in chief. "Empathy" in the presidency is cover for him to take your labor via tax dollars to benefit the upper classes.

1339749480103555072 2020-12-18 09:49:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is smart to fight the election results. Even if Biden is ultimately seated, he essentially turns a loss into a draw.
1339749213383634944 2020-12-18 09:47:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara This is why Dems hate freedom. They don't want to have to provide incentives. They want to be able to order people to do things. A system of slavery, basically.

1339372757218439168 2020-12-17 08:52:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @catturd2 If this dude does somehow ever actually acquire the presidency, he will crash and burn in a second.
1339349573823844354 2020-12-17 07:19:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It will be a comedic tragedy when this finishes him off so Kamala can take office.
1339349243295899648 2020-12-17 07:18:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra Ah. She's one of those English majors. Explains everything.
1339347961512378371 2020-12-17 07:13:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NickMiroff @maggieNYT @jdawsey1 We're gonna need another 4 years to finish the wall, and four besides that to undo the damage Biden/Kamala does.
1339347714811768838 2020-12-17 07:12:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous.

1339316094138511361 2020-12-17 05:06:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We're about to have the "best and the brightest" conversation, in which all of the elderly politicians are retired.
1339314295344128000 2020-12-17 04:59:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I expect rainbow colored crosswalks, no less.
1339314118231199744 2020-12-17 04:59:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A house with @aoc as Speaker would at least be honest. Then we can have a genuine argument about how bad liberals are.
1339313938949959686 2020-12-17 04:58:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This will not end well.
1339313840656429061 2020-12-17 04:57:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @emzanotti @AsheSchow Liberals will literally sacrifice the comfort of their children's sleep if a penny goes to a conservative businessman.
1339272208057765889 2020-12-17 02:12:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Also that I got that crappy of a cabinet position, given my #2 status from the primaries.

1339222744542666752 2020-12-16 22:55:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @lorrieposo @JackPosobiec Maybe we should stop relying on the government to tell us what to eat and just listen to doctors. The new pyramid is simple - there are only three categories of food. Sugars, proteins/fats, carbs.

Vote them down in GA and the next time the GOP has a majority in the senate, make @SenTedCruz Senate Majority Leader.
1339068644748382208 2020-12-16 12:43:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I should note that in siding with @aoc over @senatemajldr, I am also siding with @realDonaldTrump, because that is what he did.

1339032614653603843 2020-12-16 10:20:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @catturd2 Right. Establishment RINOs have long wanted to stick a knife in his back. Vote the GOP senators down in GA and deny them power.

1338910042490359809 2020-12-16 02:13:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What does "works" mean? Makes people who shouldn't feel guilty feel guilty about nonsense?
1338909699731820546 2020-12-16 02:12:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If who doesn't show up? If the Republican establishment doesn't get their butts in gear, and no one likes them or votes for them, THEY have nobody to blame but themselves for not sufficiently and vigorously supporting @realDonaldTrump.
1338909319681683458 2020-12-16 02:10:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So this is how @KamalaHarris finishes him off.
1338909033990926340 2020-12-16 02:09:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who the hell names a company "Dominion" anyway besides leftist totalitarians? No one should have "dominion" over us! We want FREEDOM!
1338869056569544709 2020-12-15 23:30:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Every vote total reported by a Dominion voting machine must be examined. A lot of fraudulent votes will have to be thrown out.
1338868298251988992 2020-12-15 23:27:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That you are irrelevant @aoc. He got your votes, now he doesn't need you any more. Go back to bartending.

1338684863449337857 2020-12-15 11:18:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MittRomney that's because it was clear to everyone that you lost, badly. You were not winning on election night, unlike @realDonaldTrump.
1338684488717656064 2020-12-15 11:17:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damn elitists. Models are garbage to them, not humans.
1338684229186674689 2020-12-15 11:16:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whether or not Biden becomes president, one thing cannot be disputed. Dems cheated and stole and election.
1338635631942119424 2020-12-15 08:02:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They should have thrown you out on the street to fend for yourself. Then see if you'd rather live under their "oppressive" rule.

1338571181969039361 2020-12-15 03:46:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SolarWinds is one of the top network management software companies, everybody uses them.
1338472982533074949 2020-12-14 21:16:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Obama was president for 8 years
1338379850428657664 2020-12-14 15:06:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. I haven't given him any money after the election and the fraud is right out there for everyone to see. Just because the media says it doesn't exist doesn't make it so.
1338378721028403200 2020-12-14 15:02:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Depends if he raises taxes and increases government control.

1338375790594039808 2020-12-14 14:50:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody is diminishing real accomplishments of women. Sleeping your way to power or becoming an expert Democrat propagandist are not included.
1338375063184285697 2020-12-14 14:47:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm not sure what this means. But it should be obvious to everyone that I am a man and wish to be addressed appropriately. No explainers needed!
1338374622279032834 2020-12-14 14:45:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. Next year I have half a mind to move there and work for @SpaceX.
1338373781908283393 2020-12-14 14:42:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody cares whether a woman or man is president. We're looking for competency, and you don't have it. Slept your way to the top. Sick.
1338373200665866241 2020-12-14 14:40:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody idolizes Trump as a Christian leader. But he is the kraken that keeps the secularist big government types at bay. They worship the state and creation instead of the Creator.

1338276508750721025 2020-12-14 08:15:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOLing at @benshapiro with a mullet
1338276073067450376 2020-12-14 08:14:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Didn't she leave her husband for Biden? A lot of names there to call her.
1338266964645605378 2020-12-14 07:38:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Typical of the left. Using academic "credentials" to try to make it sound like they are knowledgeable or good at something.
1338265484383367168 2020-12-14 07:32:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes
1338241147349704709 2020-12-14 05:55:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No one should ever benefit from being jobless.
1338240976616349698 2020-12-14 05:54:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL they're STILL at it.
1338240409311580166 2020-12-14 05:52:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Of course they are, they want @KamalaHarris.
1338240283528585217 2020-12-14 05:52:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JenniferJJacobs @davelevinthal If I were in the @realDonaldTrump admin, I would not take it. All too easy to off an entire administration.
1338240073226182657 2020-12-14 05:51:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous. Trump has already had it. He is IMMUNE.
1338173901856272385 2020-12-14 01:28:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Sure. So far one Patriot Prayer guy was shot to death point blank in Portland, and a Proud Boy was stabbed. The worst I've seen the Proud Boys do is knock an Antifa weenie to the ground, and he richly deserved it.
1338173097422229508 2020-12-14 01:25:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They are a (barely) adequate counter-weight to Antifa. Lock up the terrorists, not the counter-terrorists.

1338171827080851459 2020-12-14 01:20:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara We had barely gotten to a booming economy when COVID hit. It takes time.
1338145735011938307 2020-12-13 23:36:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BS
1338029806852534274 2020-12-13 15:55:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And how sweet it was when we got rid of @BarackObama!
1338027277536403457 2020-12-13 15:45:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Didn't know you were a BLM/Antifa supporter.

1338026847796391937 2020-12-13 15:43:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tedcruz More like the fight against cars, buses, airplanes, rockets, and vehicles of all sorts. Also against all consumer goods made of plastic.
1337908565055598593 2020-12-13 07:53:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Bottom line is that if you really want to pay down the debt, you have to have a booming American economy with which to pay it. Shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic does nothing.
1337907560213516288 2020-12-13 07:49:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara You have to create the economic growth first. Then the debt comes down over time. Unfortunately we got hit with a pandemic and shut down. But Trump got the economy going again, cured the virus, and next year will be better.
1337906963976478720 2020-12-13 07:47:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So Democrats.
1337906733189013504 2020-12-13 07:46:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara He literally brought about the best economic growth in the history of our country. TWICE.
1337906188097351681 2020-12-13 07:44:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara We're not going back to establishment Republican elitism. If you don't like Trumpism, it'll be Democrats in charge.
1337905910950338565 2020-12-13 07:43:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Trump fixed all the problems. Even Coronavirus.
1337905695807713281 2020-12-13 07:42:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara George HW Bushism is not going to cut it. Raising taxes will not help. About a decade of sustained growth is what it will take. Why we have to get back to where we were before COVID.
1337904489131597826 2020-12-13 07:37:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara A) I doubt you really care about that B) You only reduce debt with growth, not taxes. And you're faulting *him* for not implementing Republican policies?
1337903890235334656 2020-12-13 07:35:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara ...best economy in the history of America! World peace! COVID vaccine! Are you blind, man? No president has ever worked harder or accomplished more for the American people than Trump.
1337903593517674498 2020-12-13 07:34:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Made America Great Again! The hell are you talking about? He fought Dems every step of the way, unlike establishment RINOs supporting Democrat Joe Biden.
1337903099390939136 2020-12-13 07:32:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara I guarantee you those people aren't coming out to vote for establishment Republicans shipping their jobs to China and destroying their lives. They know only Trump cares about them.
1337902951264886784 2020-12-13 07:31:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Trust me, without Trump Democrats would have taken over LONG ago. Because of Trump, Republicans won  everything in 2016. Because of Trump, the GOP gained House seats this year.
1337902111112245249 2020-12-13 07:28:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. He saved the party. Obviously.
1337901276521226240 2020-12-13 07:24:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Most normal people, unlike you, don't think Trump broke the nation, they think he saved it.
1337850393020215299 2020-12-13 04:02:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> CHINESE COLLUSION!!!
1337850175981826050 2020-12-13 04:01:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JennPellegrino Did @KamalaHarris poison him?
1337849435108347907 2020-12-13 03:58:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KenGardner11 @Neoavatara But @JoeBiden really did get $1 billion from China. No one denies this.
1337840724990177299 2020-12-13 03:24:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden will never be a legitimate president, @KamalaHarris even less so as soon as they boot him out. @realDonaldTrump 2024, we're going to have to clean it up again.
1337840379886964739 2020-12-13 03:22:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They're just flat out lying now.
1337839931213946880 2020-12-13 03:21:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Blasphemy
1337806081771311106 2020-12-13 01:06:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Still not a democracy.
1337804324508999680 2020-12-13 00:59:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Colleges have become daycares for trust fund babies and those willing to motgage their futures. They are not for people looking to accomplish serious things in the world.
1337803733158260743 2020-12-13 00:57:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump needs to appoint a new AG who will quickly investigate everything in a month. Maybe @JudgeJeanine?
1337802279345336325 2020-12-13 00:51:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? That's literally what they ruled on.  https://t.co/LbNvxt9BIk
1337801910825472002 2020-12-13 00:50:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara We don't need any AGs that cover for corrupt Democrats.
1337801688854441985 2020-12-13 00:49:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara So you believe the election was fraudulently stolen from Trump, but because Dems hid it well enough we're just supposed to shut up and accept an illegitimate president?
1337801137735536642 2020-12-13 00:47:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because @realDonaldTrump, unlike the establishment GOP, is loyal to Republican base.
1337800097665609729 2020-12-13 00:42:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara If you really believe Dems did shady stuff, then no it is not over unless you support their unconstitutional actions.
1337799661789335554 2020-12-13 00:41:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara It was "ethical" to cover up Biden's corruption to throw the election? SMDH you establishment Republicans are something else.
1337799176801890308 2020-12-13 00:39:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Exactly. What's the point if they're just going to throw elections to Democrats anyway?
1337798825931657216 2020-12-13 00:37:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Please. We did not "lose". They did not hear the case based on standing. On to the next case! And if you support the shady stuff Dems did to overturn the election, you're probably not a conservative.
1337689572768145409 2020-12-12 17:23:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze @AOC @ProjectLincoln They're the type of guys that eat at Hooters, and not for the wings, so yeah I believe that.
1337689223596552194 2020-12-12 17:22:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah time to go ahead and secede. This phony government is a joke.
1337685697315151875 2020-12-12 17:08:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why though? Even if he is right, that still doesn't mean he will win.
1337685111412764675 2020-12-12 17:05:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher That these guys are hard core leftist Democrats. Are they even pretending to be Republicans any more?
1337684893388726274 2020-12-12 17:05:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Aaron Sorkin is one of the most narcissistic people on the face of the planet.
1337644401296871424 2020-12-12 14:24:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jennfranconews LOL he appointed half of them. Republicans are useless. I guess the nation has settled on "moderate" Dems.

1337641957879902208 2020-12-12 14:14:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LisaMarieBoothe Being a Democrat means you never have to work and the government gives you tons of money. Sounds great, right? Also there is no food.
1337641653503488005 2020-12-12 14:13:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Please. Russian collusion was a hoax, not this.

1337602685374226435 2020-12-12 11:38:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup.
1337602019352322049 2020-12-12 11:35:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No. Trump exposed the media as the con men. That's why we stick with him.
1337600317928640512 2020-12-12 11:29:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS.  The only barriers to freedom are in our minds. We don't have to put up with wannabe tyrants.
1337599100498403331 2020-12-12 11:24:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's not what they ruled. They dodged and said Texas didn't have standing. They did NOT deny the allegations made by Texas in the lawsuit.
1337598746771795968 2020-12-12 11:22:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GregAbbott_TX But you know what's going to happen. Austin and the hill country will simply become the new California and they'll ruin that too.
1337598016073723905 2020-12-12 11:19:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How many red states out there are down with secession? I'd venture to say a good many.
1337597393928384517 2020-12-12 11:17:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We just lost the Republic. We now live in a Democracy. Have fun!
1337596570116755457 2020-12-12 11:14:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How the hell does Texas NOT have standing? They were cheated out of winning an election.
1337596001176137728 2020-12-12 11:11:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tedcruz @maggieNYT knows, but she's a biased partisan hack and Clinton flunkie.

1337593974941429761 2020-12-12 11:03:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Let's form a new country. Call it the Real United States of America. It will have the same Constitution and laws as the old one. But California will be excluded and Trump will be president.
1337593465065050112 2020-12-12 11:01:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AllenWest the first to call for secession after an illegitimate election in which the will of the people was subverted through fraud. Who will be next?
1337592874406465537 2020-12-12 10:59:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nope. Heads in the sand. Ostriches everywhere.

1337250012376477696 2020-12-11 12:17:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TopOfTheArch We most certainly do not.
1337249853655625729 2020-12-11 12:16:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JesseKellyDC The election was conducted without the American people having all the relevant info, and it affected the results. We need a do over.
1337249575296503812 2020-12-11 12:15:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I've never seen a worse Benedict Arnold since Bill Barr. Quite the mole!
1337249444996190209 2020-12-11 12:14:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Barr is a TRAITOR! Boot him out!

1337248995471716352 2020-12-11 12:13:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TopOfTheArch LOL please. Stop with that mumbo jumbo. And we don't live in a Democracy.

1337248234570395649 2020-12-11 12:09:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TopOfTheArch Sure whatever man. Not saying it's likely. Just possible. And that has the left worried.
1337248028399374338 2020-12-11 12:09:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They're worried about this one... taking it seriously.
1337247798622883842 2020-12-11 12:08:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Gonna be hilarious when SCOTUS overturns the election.
1337247608448962562 2020-12-11 12:07:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> People say 2020 was bad, but honestly it was my best year yet, career wise. Guess I'm just an odd duck that prospers in bad times and suffers in good ones.
1337247320816164866 2020-12-11 12:06:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @thewillwitt Why wars are terrible domestically. They drain all the tough men.
1337246939793018880 2020-12-11 12:04:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScotsFyre @JesseKellyDC It's time. Red states are doing fine. Blue states are screwed up. People are leaving.

1337153402770509826 2020-12-11 05:53:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @fermayo @redsteeze It does not. And there is little risk.
1337153269802688518 2020-12-11 05:52:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If SCOTUS rejects the case brought by Texas and the other 18 states, they should prepare to secede on the basis of a fraudulent election.
1337122483594555393 2020-12-11 03:50:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Interesting idea. We'll have the Constitutional Republic of America vs the Democracy of Californistan and see which fares better.

1336518133948014592 2020-12-09 11:48:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOPLeader would do well to remember that the increase in GOP House seats is due ENTIRELY to @realDonaldTrump galvanizing a movement and getting out the vote.

1336478180572598272 2020-12-09 09:10:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah I agree. And that is the essence of what Democrats are all about - shutting private initiative down and bringing everything under government control.

1336357220561412096 2020-12-09 01:09:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? You can't just ignore a presidential pardon. Appeal to SCOTUS and seek to have this man disbarred.
1336356840100261892 2020-12-09 01:07:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Say thank you, President @realDonaldTrump sir!
1336356717001641987 2020-12-09 01:07:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You see guys? You see? This is the kind of crap the media pulls. Who wears a mask *in a photo*? Ridiculous.
1336330542543847425 2020-12-08 23:23:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr We need a shut down on all liberal media due to COVID.
1336194263491743744 2020-12-08 14:21:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What happens is we become the #Resistance

1336191627652718597 2020-12-08 14:11:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fact check: accurate, as to how Fauci sees himself. A celebrity!
1336190888750403586 2020-12-08 14:08:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets It's what Dems are best at. Spending your tax dollars on useless "education" aka propaganda, as if people are not capable of looking into an issue and reaching their own conclusions.
1336184672905256962 2020-12-08 13:43:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> CHINESE COLLUSION
1336183642247323648 2020-12-08 13:39:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Sadly, China beat America in this election.
1336154308883181568 2020-12-08 11:43:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Four the next four years, we must fight the @JoeBiden administration's collusion with the communist Chinese Party, and impeach him for it.
1336153606333079555 2020-12-08 11:40:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Screw that and give me my money back.
1336153054274592768 2020-12-08 11:38:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You're literally taking their money to give it to your friends.
1336146658959249416 2020-12-08 11:12:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Very true. Here's hoping to a rebound in 2021.
1336122357669367811 2020-12-08 09:36:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Has he acknowledged his stripper's son grandchild yet or no?
1336121863244800000 2020-12-08 09:34:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That is in fact the opposite of what he said. Fraudulent signatures are not lawful or the will of Georgia voters.
1336108902912577536 2020-12-08 08:42:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL @realDonaldTrump should just form a PAC. He can be a shadow president and still have way more influence than senile old @JoeBiden.
1336108377110425602 2020-12-08 08:40:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Smart man. He knows he has no chance of ever being president if Trump's base is not fully behind him.

1336106453036396544 2020-12-08 08:32:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> China LITERALLY took out our country's leaders and installed their own puppet president using Coronavirus. This is biological warfare.

1336001894330806284 2020-12-08 01:37:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> But they haven't done a signature audit. Re-counting fraudulent ballots is pointless.
1335988521245487112 2020-12-08 00:44:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What is the point of these big news outlets if they don't cover real news? Spew #FakeNews propaganda, this is what you're gonna get.

1335987818598895619 2020-12-08 00:41:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Exactly. But this is what you get with Dems and the GOPe. Corporate giveaways with taxpayer dollars. Time for a new Tea Party!

1335972342141509634 2020-12-07 23:40:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Translation: the Democrats masquerading as Republicans and selling us out to the left are the big threat
1335971996400836610 2020-12-07 23:38:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So the judge was a biased left-wing hack, got it.
1335971782264836099 2020-12-07 23:37:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Exactly. Boot the weak out and let's start rebuilding on a firm foundation.

1335970655603478531 2020-12-07 23:33:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democrats do not believe in science. Maybe a politized version that they claim supports their agenda.

1335969825101930497 2020-12-07 23:30:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The fight of our times is government education. Nothing else really matters, everything else is downstream of that. We must fight to destroy public education and teacher's unions, and replace them with school choice, private sector education, homeschool, etc.
1335945729852968967 2020-12-07 21:54:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No, not as a whole, but individual free states exist.

1335933661099810819 2020-12-07 21:06:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Welp I guess that's it. Now that germs have been discovered, we all have to lock ourselves inside our houses until we die.
1335841947353755648 2020-12-07 15:01:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is not, in fact, happening.

1335839523855605760 2020-12-07 14:52:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) That office doesn't exist B) Seems *just a touch* unbalanced, gender wise.

1335769836136378368 2020-12-07 10:15:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL its a race to resign before @realDonaldTrump fires him. Somehow he lost his spine and the #DeepState got to him. Good riddance!
1335713154840444929 2020-12-07 06:30:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hadn't thought of that before, but makes sense.

1335712838434820098 2020-12-07 06:28:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous. With these people responsibility is always collective, never personal.

1335706623990509568 2020-12-07 06:04:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Heck, they told us. "Count every vote" was their rallying cry for months. They did not discriminate between legal and illegal.

1335647812768423938 2020-12-07 02:10:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PRyan and the #DeepState gonna deep state.
1335642725341949953 2020-12-07 01:50:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah... basically we're giving people something that is just as bad as COVID. How can a drug be approved if a side effect is death? And why aren't we using HCQ + Zinc?
1335640885623730176 2020-12-07 01:42:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden is not president yet and Hunter does not live there.

1335329219145052160 2020-12-06 05:04:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @disabstraction @elonmusk It is, actually. @elonmusk says "I bet we can do this". Then they design, build, and test a prototype, iterating until they are successful.
1335328599604391943 2020-12-06 05:02:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll It's going to be HILARIOUS when @cnn has to become pro-Trump again. They are shameless media whores and always support the party out of power.
1335327656997490689 2020-12-06 04:58:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So who ya gonna screw out of that money then?
1335327009032036353 2020-12-06 04:55:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How many people have died from other causes in this year? Statistically, it would have to be north of 3 million. I think we can calm down now. Or not, and live our entire lives freaked out about death.
1335325853216088065 2020-12-06 04:51:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RyanAFournier @McConaughey president 20... whenever @realDonaldTrump is done.
1335325662652100608 2020-12-06 04:50:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @RudyGiuliani says "we don't need the courts", he probably doesn't have solid enough evidence to win there. I doubt stage legislators will appoint alternate electors just based on a hunch. DOOM
1335325285374451714 2020-12-06 04:48:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @disabstraction @elonmusk Sure but for Earth it would be good. Also if you made the wheels big and soft enough, I bet you could slow it down enough in low G to land on a flat spot somewhere.
1335297188939915264 2020-12-06 02:57:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uhh it's called capitalism and you're the one trying to stop it.
1335297034061012992 2020-12-06 02:56:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shocker. They care nothing about people. Everything is just an excuse to expand big government and shut you down.

1335295869202075650 2020-12-06 02:51:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @elonmusk should just put landing gear on Starship and make it a space shuttle. Way easier to land.
1335289634289545217 2020-12-06 02:27:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank For the record, teenagers also do not understand adults.

1335288313557741568 2020-12-06 02:21:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not true. The dominoes would fall in PA, MI, WI, AZ, etc.

1335286239424077829 2020-12-06 02:13:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @prageru We should not implement big government programs in the name of "taking care of the environment" though. The national park program and sensible regulations for toxic or poisonous substances are it.
1335156103961858049 2020-12-05 17:36:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Many people would prefer to live before they die.

1335092140205027329 2020-12-05 13:22:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @FlashReport ...and worse, government growth will then be accepted as "bipartisan". We can't have that happen. We must fight against it for 2022 and 2024.
1335091940069675008 2020-12-05 13:21:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @FlashReport I have ZERO confidence that Republicans in the Senate will stop them growing government. They will enable them.
1335091124617183232 2020-12-05 13:18:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's... not what's going on here. The question is if Republicans will be any better than Dems, or maybe even worse? If so, why bother? At least with Dems you have something to fight against.

1335085825936281600 2020-12-05 12:57:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fun!
1335085631748321281 2020-12-05 12:56:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well no, because we have vaccines and antibody cures now.
1335084661639409665 2020-12-05 12:52:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr You know you are going to have to use profanity just a little bit less if you want to run for office soon.
1335084188060561408 2020-12-05 12:50:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Don't... do this. Why help the establishment that wants you to lose?
1335083997748228098 2020-12-05 12:50:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TomFitton @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump would then go to @parler_app and take half of Twitter's user base with him.
1335083375196065792 2020-12-05 12:47:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He has to be disbarred, right?
1335082780083023873 2020-12-05 12:45:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When we return to power in 2024 our first order of business will be terminating the Department of Education.
1335025074760462337 2020-12-05 08:55:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1335024915968364544 2020-12-05 08:55:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It does. But you all are Democrats who routinely cover for Biden.
1335024249522823169 2020-12-05 08:52:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> At least you have the chance of fire burning it down - then you can collect the insurance.
1335023786899419137 2020-12-05 08:50:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Tells me to VOTE THEM DOWN in Georgia. They are functional Democrats. Time to start over.
1335023410917879809 2020-12-05 08:49:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you have to say it... FRAUD!
1335019381982629888 2020-12-05 08:33:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We're done being polite to her.
1335019000032616449 2020-12-05 08:31:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll Everybody knows there was fraud, and it changed the outcome of election. All eyes on the courts now.
1335018821833383937 2020-12-05 08:31:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay!
1335018080255307777 2020-12-05 08:28:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why would you NOT build a wall unless you are FOR illegal immigration?
1335017913611395072 2020-12-05 08:27:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Heritage @JJCarafano @Anna_Giaritelli No. We have thousands of miles of wall to go. If you build a wall only in some places, people will simply go around it. #Idiots
1334880077008482306 2020-12-04 23:19:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug Damn we knew he was a creep, but this is some really kinky stuff.
1334879673973678081 2020-12-04 23:18:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hell yes! I admire @tedcruz's principled stand here, even though he personally would be harmed by losing the majority.
1334878378437058561 2020-12-04 23:13:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Huh? I think I said the opposite. You didn't vote for Trump.
1334877721596481536 2020-12-04 23:10:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sure there is. Because the GOP establishment doesn't care if Trump loses. Why should we care if they lose?
1334792404235378689 2020-12-04 17:31:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Finally!
1334791323258335234 2020-12-04 17:27:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "COVID guilt" 😂🤣😂 They're supposed to feel guilty for not dying in a pandemic?
1334741741996531712 2020-12-04 14:10:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You have a cushy gig here in Oklahoma @JimInhofe. You never say anything and always vote Republican. If you do not include an end to section 230, I and other constituents will begin to look for new leadership.
1334737278736986114 2020-12-04 13:52:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> AMEN
1334737089133486082 2020-12-04 13:51:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who the hell cares if Republicans have the Senate? Meaningless. We need a new Trump party.
1334736827606061057 2020-12-04 13:50:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Vote em down in Georgia. This is who they are.
1334736522520784897 2020-12-04 13:49:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So I mean, what, a D-Day on the shores of China?
1334699080476471296 2020-12-04 11:20:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The permanent @realDonaldTrump is HERE and it will not end until he serves his second term. Sadly, he'll have to spend it all undoing everything Biden does, and we'll never get to reforming media/tech/education.
1334698506687221761 2020-12-04 11:18:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The alien spaceship has arrived and it is sampling our atmosphere.
1334697742178906114 2020-12-04 11:15:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamalaHarris will be happy to oblige. She'll find something, anything, to disagree with him on.
1334682493614743553 2020-12-04 10:14:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. THIRD PARTY
1334682430138175488 2020-12-04 10:14:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How does someone who cries whenever they make a mistake become a congresswoman?
1334672593018875904 2020-12-04 09:35:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Working class already left Dems after they were taken for granted and treated horribly under @BarackObama. Now the @gop is doing the same. Where will they go? #ThirdParty
1334672168089751552 2020-12-04 09:33:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @aoc serves DC cocktail parties?

1334670758392586241 2020-12-04 09:28:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> VOTE HIM DOWN
1334663252970762240 2020-12-04 08:58:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ...and is 100% CORRECT about the fraud. (You forgot that part.)
1334662748949667841 2020-12-04 08:56:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. We have the power. If they don't play ball... we'll make them walk the plank.
1334662197142638592 2020-12-04 08:53:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bookmark it.
1334661872382078976 2020-12-04 08:52:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They're all in for a rough surprise.
1334661513370603521 2020-12-04 08:51:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS (They won't do it. They hate him more.)
1334661390049619971 2020-12-04 08:50:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not completely correct. @senatemajldr would lose his position as maj. leader, and all the power for the GOP establishment that goes with it. While I like him personally, he's clearly not going to fight for Americans first. The country may need to be punished for voting for Biden.
1334659163859931139 2020-12-04 08:41:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Every American? What about those who don't trust it, don't want it, or have already had COVID?
1334658938424406016 2020-12-04 08:41:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sucking up to Biden.
1334658787773456390 2020-12-04 08:40:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Anybody who is willing to wear a mask is already wearing masks. This will change nothing.
1334587499528728576 2020-12-04 03:57:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is dumb. Hospital units try to operate as close to 0% capacity as possible to maximize profits.
1334587134913753088 2020-12-04 03:55:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Seriously, guys. @realDonaldTrump was way ahead. He was winning on election night. Then in the middle of the night, Dems throw in a few hundred thousand ballots in each swing state, changing it to Biden. They have no good explanation for this, and we're just supposed to take it?
1334586802037026818 2020-12-04 03:54:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 1) Trump 2) Support 3) Irrelevant, hypothetical  Throw anybody out who does not answer this way.
1334586598311260161 2020-12-04 03:53:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What kind of political party pulls secret ballots out from under a table on camera, changing the winner of the election, and expects the public to just go along with it? Laughable.
1334583582208167944 2020-12-04 03:41:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell is wrong with these people? Throw them all out and start over.
1334583487194664965 2020-12-04 03:41:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Since this is factually incorrect, you would be forcing them to lie in an interview. That should be illegal.
1334582626137616384 2020-12-04 03:37:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug Basically all our elections are about these days are whether the US is China's b**** or the other way around.
1334537791779246080 2020-12-04 00:39:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> VETO IT. This damn GOPe.
1334524701926952966 2020-12-03 23:47:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If the best the left can come up with to oppose the GOP lawsuits is a typo, we are on VERY solid ground here!
1334523347091251206 2020-12-03 23:42:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL duh.
1334523265956651012 2020-12-03 23:41:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This should not even be a question. Nothing should be mandated. If the government can force you to be injected with potentially deadly disease, there's no rights they can't violate.
1334522462135062530 2020-12-03 23:38:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Right. We will not rest until @realDonaldTrump gets 4 more years to finish cleaning up the swamp and fixing media/tech/education. If Biden gets 4 years, then it will take another 4 to 8 as well. Don Jr or whoever the heir apparent is.
1334521897254612993 2020-12-03 23:36:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sound like the NDAA is DOA then.
1334463052666859520 2020-12-03 19:42:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> These guys? Decreases my trust in the vaccine.

1334397942086692865 2020-12-03 15:23:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I live in OK so probably not gonna do that.
1334395655406694401 2020-12-03 15:14:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I like Trumpism. I'm not really sure if I like Republicans any more. Definitely don't like Democrats. Libertarians are kooky and never have the votes. Need a new Trump Party.
1334351323047792640 2020-12-03 12:18:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> AMEN
1334351212968284163 2020-12-03 12:18:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whether he will run in the GOP remains to be seen.
1334350951180869633 2020-12-03 12:17:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Huh. I could have sworn the entire GOP establishment just supported a Democrat presidential candidate over the Republican president, and no one said a word.
1334350700097265664 2020-12-03 12:16:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Agree with Lin Wood.
1334350433054318592 2020-12-03 12:15:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sexism!
1334349906258104328 2020-12-03 12:13:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Thank God for @realDonaldTrump! VETO IT NOW
1334340676671180801 2020-12-03 11:36:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I will vote for anybody who unapologetically stands FOR American workers and AGAINST offshoring job or importing workers, and no one else. Who out there wants to represent me, and millions of other Americans? Maybe I should just run for office. Easiest win ever.
1334340210897850368 2020-12-03 11:34:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> At long last, the lies are exposed and our nation can rest in peace.
1334338160587902976 2020-12-03 11:26:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What do you mean? You don't take her seriously because she is a woman?
1334337900176142338 2020-12-03 11:25:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Seriously, we need a third party. Only @realDonaldTrump has the following to do it.
1334337730902446080 2020-12-03 11:24:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> With unlimited fuel stations, supply stations, repair stations, etc in orbit around various planets and flying back and forth, we can travel virtually anywhere in the solar system.
1334337305193144320 2020-12-03 11:22:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They can also just put a bunch of crew dragons up there for emergency de-orbits.
1334337170581188609 2020-12-03 11:22:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Also space tow vehicles. Starship breaks down? A drone ship will tow you to the nearest fuel station.
1334336577158438913 2020-12-03 11:20:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Some company, maybe @SpaceX, is going to make a LOT of money putting gas stations in space. Just launching fuel capsules up there, one a day. Food/medical capsules too. Just get them all up there in orbit. Will enable travel to Mars and farther. Put stations in orbit there too.
1334334172211646465 2020-12-03 11:10:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You could also report that the third wave has broken and new cases are finally dropping.
1334333634518654977 2020-12-03 11:08:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ah. I see we're to the "there was widespread voter fraud that overturned the election, so we'll just make fun of the looks of those exposing it" phase.
1334333113686761474 2020-12-03 11:06:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I mean they literally have everybody's emails at their fingertips. They could blackmail the entire country any time they wanted.
1334332403196846080 2020-12-03 11:03:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JZmirak Every business that replaces Americans with foreign labor should be burned down. Pitchforks and torches time.
1334331577648689152 2020-12-03 11:00:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1334331295250456576 2020-12-03 10:59:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *Truth
1334331150077222913 2020-12-03 10:58:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Alternatively, she knows what she saw and thinks that Democrats are being ridiculous, especially since she will go to jail if what she is saying is not true.
1334330270632308737 2020-12-03 10:55:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Actual per Johns Hopkins the third wave is finally breaking and the number of cases are dropping.
1334330000875642881 2020-12-03 10:53:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? The government spends $1 trillion on "Coronavirus relief" but none of it goes to actual Americans. This is the real steal. #StopTheSteal
1334329709912584193 2020-12-03 10:52:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So was he fired or no?
1334329562726019074 2020-12-03 10:52:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How the hell do both parties continue to push the one issue that all Americans are united against? We cannot let them keep crapping on us like this!
1334326924097761280 2020-12-03 10:41:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> #MAGA needs to elect senators. Throw these anti-American bums out.
1334326223812562944 2020-12-03 10:38:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You know what to do, #MAGA. Vote em down, throw em out. They'll scream and cry to high heaven, but always remember what they did to you. They deserve a spanking.
1334325967070892032 2020-12-03 10:37:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Biden is not in the senate.
1334325763852603394 2020-12-03 10:37:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *telling the truth
1334325470809255936 2020-12-03 10:35:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why? They'll just ship your job to China and chortle over a glass of bourbon while you drown in debt and unemployment.
1334325099655270401 2020-12-03 10:34:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Disagree. Throw the current pack of anti-American establishment GOP grifters out of the Senate on their asses and start over.
1334324407599304707 2020-12-03 10:31:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's clear the GOP senate will now give away American jobs to foreigners and make us suck again. It's time to vote them out of the Senate and start fresh.
1334323899639738371 2020-12-03 10:29:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? America eliminated slavery.
1334323498119032834 2020-12-03 10:28:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Vote the GA senators down. This cannot stand.
1334323323791151104 2020-12-03 10:27:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> With Democrats, at least there's something to fight against. With the GOP establishment, we're all doomed forever.
1334322787704594433 2020-12-03 10:25:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA every word a lie.
1334322570208956417 2020-12-03 10:24:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There's a very good excuse, and that's to not let RINOs take over the party.
1334322299823149056 2020-12-03 10:23:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Someone should create a twitter plug-in that disables all of Twitter's censoring. Wouldn't be too hard to do.
1334322086769270785 2020-12-03 10:22:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Congrats!
1334322019488452608 2020-12-03 10:22:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Any times someone says "looks like" it's code for racism.
1334321785328820224 2020-12-03 10:21:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @joopto__ @ezraronge @TrumpWarRoom @JoeBiden Please. He's never stuttered before in his life. Roll the tape.
1334321663555604481 2020-12-03 10:20:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shameless.
1334265926003396610 2020-12-03 06:39:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> While other companies perform better in, you know, business.
1334265597341921280 2020-12-03 06:38:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SecretsBedard @kimguilfoyle @ACUConservative @mschlapp Although some people do actually live in RV camps. Usually  Trump voters though.
1334264418360848385 2020-12-03 06:33:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL jokes on her.
1334263855665569792 2020-12-03 06:31:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RameshPonnuru This also depends to a large degree on WHY said woman is single. Did she just up and leave her husband? Then no. Is she a widower, was cheated on, abused, etc? Different story.
1334263074627457026 2020-12-03 06:28:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CalebJHull @RealSaavedra What, burn down some servers? They'll just move the data.

1334262621843886080 2020-12-03 06:26:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I would have a similar feeling about a Barack Obama portrait made out of used toilet paper.
1334262308038701057 2020-12-03 06:24:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @btysonmd @MelissaTweets How many deaths could have been prevented if big pharma hadn't squelched HCQ + Zinc, which is perfectly safe and has been used for years?
1334254561603751937 2020-12-03 05:54:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fraud?
1334254341146992643 2020-12-03 05:53:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Maybe. Depends on if @realDonaldTrump wins the election or not.
1334243468856717314 2020-12-03 05:10:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't really care, do you?
1334243149968011268 2020-12-03 05:08:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The solution is for people to get jobs and use that money to purchase food from stores.

1334241700445876236 2020-12-03 05:03:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> But it will punish the establishment GOP for throwing him to the wolves.
1334241007819509769 2020-12-03 05:00:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The "Lincoln" Project is a fully Democrat group.
1334240776218402818 2020-12-03 04:59:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We have TWO Coronavirus cures (Eli Lilly and Regeneron) besides hydroxychloroquine. Do we really need a vaccine?
1334224540910678026 2020-12-03 03:54:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Agreed.
1334206997080776709 2020-12-03 02:45:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I mean he was getting the literal creator of the universe as a son, so quite a bargain there.
1334205501467488257 2020-12-03 02:39:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There's a difference between blowing money on crack and strippers vs. investing it in productive and growing businesses, and everyone knows it.

1334204971978543106 2020-12-03 02:37:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bullcrap. No one cares in the slightest except elites who use it to push government controls.

1334158830465392643 2020-12-02 23:33:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There is ZERO limited hospital capacity. This is all politics.
1334158477820907521 2020-12-02 23:32:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When there isn't fraud in an election, you don't have all these people coming forward with sworn testimony about the fraud they witnessed. There was fraud, and it swung the election for @JoeBiden in the dead of night.
1334151548214112258 2020-12-02 23:04:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He did the work. He built the coalition. He delivered on his promises. The party is his.
1334077855203004416 2020-12-02 18:12:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous. @realDonaldTrump won the hearts of the American people, and the election if the fraud is not overturned. He's not going anywhere, and if the GOP doesn't like that, he'll easily win on his own 3rd party ticket in 2024.
1334077353878827012 2020-12-02 18:10:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Will women want to date this "man" with a vagina?
1334028906295386112 2020-12-02 14:57:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker Exactly. The way these things go, the people on the side of truth usually win and everybody else is confused as to what happened.
1334028690041298948 2020-12-02 14:56:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's December 2, 2020. For the next four years, if @JoeBiden wins, I will be reminding you every day to #Resist. They never accepted @realDonaldTrump as president, we will never accept @JoeBiden. Impeach.
1334026553991319552 2020-12-02 14:48:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> In other words, they're just going to use COVID as an excuse to steal $1 trillion from the American people.
1334025827302912000 2020-12-02 14:45:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is literally everything I hate about the left. Everything in it is LIES.

Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
1334013378201837569 2020-12-02 13:55:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @fred_connection @peterktodd LOL and by "black people" they mean "leftist Democrats".
1334013205954387968 2020-12-02 13:55:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whatever, something must be done. Twitter cannot be allowed to lie with impunity to subvert our democracy.
1334012429198643200 2020-12-02 13:52:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Twitter disputes the whistleblowers? Why, pray tell?
1334012034455891970 2020-12-02 13:50:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I mean, if hypocritical Democrats do it all the time...

1333974675295244288 2020-12-02 11:22:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not really. Depends whether the GOP establishment gets behind Trump in his quest for electoral justice (they won't).
1333973804683571201 2020-12-02 11:18:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why do you people keep saying "baseless"? There are people testifying by the dozens every day about all the clear cut fraud they witnessed.
1333973558138195969 2020-12-02 11:17:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *tell the truth in America where we have freedom of speech
1333973410850992130 2020-12-02 11:16:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> As you have pointed out, presidents aren't eligible for a third term.

1333970022750973961 2020-12-02 11:03:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Can we just skip to the end? "There is rock solid evidence of widespread fraud that overturned the election, but orange man bad and LALALALALALA I CANT HEAR YOU"
1333969188398960640 2020-12-02 11:00:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec @JamesOKeefeIII Quick release all the tapes before they can strangle it.
1333968892247625729 2020-12-02 10:59:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sounds pretty on brand.
1333968814350938114 2020-12-02 10:58:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Barr is a dirty traitor. Is he angling for a job in the Biden administration? Ain't gonna happen.
1333916163861065728 2020-12-02 07:29:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pull the party down around them?  What the hell? Him being on the campaign trail GAINED Republicans House seats and seats in state legislatures. Off your rocker.
1333915881181753345 2020-12-02 07:28:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL "experts". Like @maggieNYT, the hack @HillaryClinton flunkie?
1333913818448220166 2020-12-02 07:20:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That money was not yours. That money belonged to the corporations. They generated it. Through production. It belongs to everyone with a 401k. Stop pretending that tax reductions are gift from the government. They are a lessening of theft.
1333909841111343111 2020-12-02 07:04:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous.

1333812588153548801 2020-12-02 00:37:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara What if they just decided to inject everyone with the virus to get it over with and called it a vaccine?
1333811255333806085 2020-12-02 00:32:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sounds like the vaccine is worse than just getting Coronavirus in most cases lol
1333802790863269888 2020-12-01 23:59:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bitcoin has little value. It is not widely used today.

1333649398379798533 2020-12-01 13:49:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dang. Teachers have been on welfare this whole time while the rest of us suffer.
1333647602911498240 2020-12-01 13:42:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Exactly. Good teachers will actually make boatloads more money with school choice.
1333647393385025536 2020-12-01 13:41:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup.
1333646964567793664 2020-12-01 13:39:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Don't you think @realDonaldTrump would LOVE to have his own party where he gets to call all the shots?
1333646829221711875 2020-12-01 13:39:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES
1333646576229773312 2020-12-01 13:38:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If the @gop thinks that with @realDonaldTrump out of the way they can resume their usual program, they are sorely mistaken. The have power *because* of #MAGA, not the other way around. We can and WILL walk if we need to.
1333646065770360833 2020-12-01 13:36:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The symbol of our new party will be the lion. What shall we call it? I say the American Party.
1333645739231211522 2020-12-01 13:34:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Vote Perdue and Loeffler down. Guys like this sold us out to Democrats. Stick it to them, and let's start a new @realDonaldTrump party for 2024!
1333645227962355712 2020-12-01 13:32:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Agreed. @realDonaldTrump should mount an INDEPENDENT bid in 2024 and screw the powers that be in both parties. Especially #NeverTrump. He could pull enough votes from both parties to win a plurality.
1333644743927095296 2020-12-01 13:30:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The GOP establishment didn't come out to vote for Trump. Some actively campaigned for Biden. Some were inwardly hoping he lost. Why should #MAGA come out to vote for them in Georgia and let them have the Senate? I certainly don't care. They made their bed, now let them lie in it.

1333610584848420865 2020-12-01 11:15:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. The GOP establishment finally had enough. Good luck with the Senate! #MAGA ain't showing up.

1333174446807523336 2020-11-30 06:22:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bullcrap it does little, if anything.
1333152327084236801 2020-11-30 04:54:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is the root of all problems in America. Abolish it and replace it with patriotic education!!!
1333148951831334912 2020-11-30 04:40:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 🚨🚨🚨
1333148609622274048 2020-11-30 04:39:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Every time someone says @realDonaldTrump "baselessly" did something, you know that it is based on something solid.
1333130561808965632 2020-11-30 03:27:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay!
1333129882109403140 2020-11-30 03:25:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TeamTrump @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump Why is this disputed, Twitter, and by who? There is literally evidence of dead people voting.
1333129685417529344 2020-11-30 03:24:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Probably more fraud, but yeah I don't think anybody is seriously contesting Minnesota. Heck they were the only state to vote for Mondale over Reagan.
1333128884603277312 2020-11-30 03:21:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hilarious. This from the guy that shut them all down.
1333081506227556358 2020-11-30 00:12:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @colbyhall Whatever lets you stick your head in the sand and avoid the dreaded task of considering whether his claims are true.
1333080418527145984 2020-11-30 00:08:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> She's not really this much of an idiot, she just plays one on TV.
1333080099923615751 2020-11-30 00:07:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Everything is fine no vote fraud Biden won shut up shut up shut up LALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU
1332899118797250560 2020-11-29 12:08:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara LOL every day they claim a different country.
1332895963720130563 2020-11-29 11:55:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nice.
1332895775236485122 2020-11-29 11:54:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because they did cheat.
1332894180918620160 2020-11-29 11:48:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The student loan debt was entered into voluntarily. The taxes were not.
1332892804394196993 2020-11-29 11:43:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sorry, @realDonaldTrump already solved that problem. We already have the vaccine. And I am NOT locking down.
1332892490597273600 2020-11-29 11:41:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who?
1332861061146562562 2020-11-29 09:36:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well that endorsement wasn't obviously corrupt or anything. He bought her with an ambassadorship.
1332860464053825537 2020-11-29 09:34:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay! Useless government schools should go the way of the dinosaur.
1332842566841151489 2020-11-29 08:23:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Alternatively, we could let individuals decide what gets injected into them.
1332842321742880771 2020-11-29 08:22:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SCOTUS
1332814778918690816 2020-11-29 06:33:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I guess... we're still alive?
1332805400773713923 2020-11-29 05:55:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SebGorka @GretaThunberg It's been a tough year. Buy all the stuff you want, and more.
1332596602771484672 2020-11-28 16:06:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SebGorka These GOP state legislatures may turn out to be the real heros of the election.
1332579562094518273 2020-11-28 14:58:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS
1332530920713285633 2020-11-28 11:45:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> DO IT!
1332530836604932096 2020-11-28 11:44:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 👀
1332527918698946560 2020-11-28 11:33:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SCOTUS must prevent the vote in PA from being certified, period. Also in Georgia (due to Atlanta) and Michigan (Detroit). Without those states, Biden will not have 270 electoral votes, the House will vote by state, and @realDonaldTrump will WIN!
1332527489730703360 2020-11-28 11:31:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SebGorka @SebGorka has a good point. We don't need to overturn the election in any state. We simply need to stop them from certifying a fraudulent election. If @JoeBiden doesn't get 270 electoral votes, the House votes BY STATE and we win.
1332525540738273281 2020-11-28 11:23:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? I watch college football to see grown men beat each other up. I don't want to see them do that to a woman.
1332525059626373121 2020-11-28 11:21:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump That old @BarackObama. Always got to find some way to inject racism into the conversation.
1332480490587172866 2020-11-28 08:24:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Can't they, like, just send them via @FedEx or @UPS? You know... the normal way you ship stuff?
1332479983650967554 2020-11-28 08:22:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL they even dumped more ballots in on the recount.
1332477621502963713 2020-11-28 08:13:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Please.
1332474912674607105 2020-11-28 08:02:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh. As clean as when @staceyabrams lost?
1332411228568891392 2020-11-28 03:49:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Your daily reminder that @JoeBiden was not the legitimate winner of the election and we must always #Resist. If not SCOTUS, then state legislatures. If not state legislatures, then electors. If he is seated, investigate him for Chinese collusion. If that yields nothing, impeach.
1332410789836300288 2020-11-28 03:47:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay!
1332410118852521986 2020-11-28 03:45:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dumb. The lawsuit alleged that the election was not carried out according to state law. Having black and white proof of votes being changed is irrelevant.
1332409588684042241 2020-11-28 03:42:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Crack journalist fails to understand basic text.
1332387228958461954 2020-11-28 02:14:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is definitely true. We do have a lot of marijuana shops. Eventually competition will whittle them down.
1332386938251333633 2020-11-28 02:12:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I have lived here for a decade and I have never heard that nickname. You guys made it up.
1332386424058949632 2020-11-28 02:10:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SCOTUS. Specific allegations were made with witness testimony under oath as proof.
1332373894955724802 2020-11-28 01:21:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KYWeise @ComfortablySmug We should abolish the legal concept of an "employee". Every person is their own business, essentially, and all work performed is on contract. Taxes, benefits, etc are all the responsibility of the individual.
1332371977143726088 2020-11-28 01:13:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec @JoeBiden has attorneys? Funny, I thought the election was over. He should let them go home.
1332371424821080066 2020-11-28 01:11:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is not hard. Give it to the people who are the most in contact with COVID. Healthcare workers first, then work your way down from the most socially connected to the least.
1332366979089489922 2020-11-28 00:53:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pretty on brand for the left. No gratefulness, entitled little brats.
1332365525436002305 2020-11-28 00:47:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> These freaks actually thought they could just make up ballots to win the election.
1332205101440782336 2020-11-27 14:10:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @70scum421 @prageru Simply false.
1332204602729635841 2020-11-27 14:08:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democrats thought they could add enough votes in the counties they controlled to win the election, and the media would cover for them. They didn't count on @realDonaldTrump actually following through with massive lawsuits. They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar.
1332203297474797568 2020-11-27 14:03:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jsende @conservmillen There is only one party I blame for Coronavirus and that is the Chinese Communist Party.
1332202762424213504 2020-11-27 14:01:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Amen. There's a mountain of evidence that the election was fraudulent. FORWARD.
1332202406155784192 2020-11-27 13:59:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @OD_ant @AnnCoulter Of course. @JoeBiden will bring an agenda of corporate hegemony. Not free market capitalism. Corporatism.
1332202105906601987 2020-11-27 13:58:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> High time this was done.
1332201974784266243 2020-11-27 13:57:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @70scum421 @prageru Oh I don't know, living in warring bands of tribes at a subsistence level?
1332169470299746305 2020-11-27 11:48:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze @jaketapper The great conceit of the media is that they are the only arbiters of truth.
1332139666347347969 2020-11-27 09:50:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes he's an elector.
1332138951419846656 2020-11-27 09:47:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @70scum421 @prageru You're free to go live a barbaric life (and death) in the Amazon jungles.
1332105093894836224 2020-11-27 07:32:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> INTO MY VEINS
1332104562271014912 2020-11-27 07:30:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I have to say, my faith was not strong and initially I doubted. Now I am 100% convinced that the election was stolen and @realDonaldTrump was the legitimate winner. There is just too much evidence that cannot be ignored.
1332102736402374656 2020-11-27 07:23:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Twitter's continual blocking of pro Trump tweets is laughable. They can in no way claim to be anything other than a propaganda outlet for Biden.
1332102402523213825 2020-11-27 07:22:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @prageru Western Civilization was the best thing to ever happen to Native Americans, who prior to that time lived in a feudal society of constantly warring tribes.
1332101678091427842 2020-11-27 07:19:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Lies. There was ALWAYS fraud in Dem controlled city machines, but @realDonaldTrump won in a big enough landslide that it didn't matter in 2016.
1332096145867337728 2020-11-27 06:57:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *with overwhelming evidence
1332095599332745217 2020-11-27 06:55:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because Biden won't be inaugurated.
1332095528222425089 2020-11-27 06:54:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Alternatively, because freedom, and people like their churches.

1332073431274283012 2020-11-27 05:27:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Send the marshal of the Supreme Court to lock him up.
1332072997864214532 2020-11-27 05:25:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I regret to inform you that once again, the media has been lying to you. @JoeBiden is not the president elect.
1332072297516191749 2020-11-27 05:22:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No! Shocker.
1331991363882274817 2020-11-27 00:01:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I am at war with the left and those who seek to lock down my freedoms in violation of my rights. SCOTUS agrees with me.
1331871136842461184 2020-11-26 16:03:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHA yes! Let's all start labeling (the real) misinformation on Twitter.

1331732147825217542 2020-11-26 06:51:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Funny how there was no outbreak in whatever country said products came from before China.
1331731835223560192 2020-11-26 06:49:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets Another #ProTip - cut the potatoes up and boil them. Much faster than baking in the oven and they come out with the perfect texture.
1331727076244774914 2020-11-26 06:30:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> TERRIBLE let's hope the courts stop this travesty.

1331671678095593472 2020-11-26 02:50:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EpochTimes If @realDonaldTrump overturns PA, WI or MI, and NV, he wins.

1331503743301509121 2020-11-25 15:43:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Idea: make @realDonaldTrump governor of a large state like Texas or Florida, rename it the free state of Trump, and we all move there.
1331502535417475072 2020-11-25 15:38:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fire all "educators". Abolish the Dept. of Education. Ban government schools. Only then will education be worth anything again.

1331349219253362691 2020-11-25 05:29:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump has the trust of the American people, and that's something @JoeBiden can never buy or rig, despite whatever arbitrary title comes before his name.

1330341766596276225 2020-11-22 10:46:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is a ridiculous pack of lies. No president ever worked harder than @realDonaldTrump.
1330341447728508929 2020-11-22 10:44:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Real_Gigabear @JudicialWatch @TomFitton @LouDobbs Which is why the @realDonaldTrump campaign is suing. But now the state court says "oopsie no one saw anything tough luck!" So on to SCOTUS.
1330313314824577030 2020-11-22 08:53:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @realDonaldTrump loses, whatever. The #MAGA movement continues. We take the House in 2022 and the Presidency back in 2024.
1330308894799896577 2020-11-22 08:35:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JudicialWatch @TomFitton @LouDobbs Well I mean you can't just throw them out without any good reason. But you can force them to be scrutinized.
1330307745468309504 2020-11-22 08:30:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stclairashley *sigh* They'll get us all eventually. Twitter is a left wing rag; switch to Parler.
1330306497469960195 2020-11-22 08:25:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SCOTUS
1330306344415600651 2020-11-22 08:25:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This guy is too good for them. The establishment never stuck up for him.
1330302061792079874 2020-11-22 08:08:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> After this pandemic, we're going to have parties and social gatherings every day of the week for a year.
1330299314095218690 2020-11-22 07:57:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @freep The fraud is all one way due to corrupt Democrat big city political machines. Republicans are law and order type people, they don't cheat.
1330295066510970881 2020-11-22 07:40:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @freep Actually the courts in PA threw out 200k ballots with no date as illegal. Sorry, you lose.
1330294962873831425 2020-11-22 07:40:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @freep A) They all expected Hillary to win, they weren't prepared like this time. B) Yeah probably, but Trump won by a big enough landslide that it didn't matter.
1330294633084162052 2020-11-22 07:38:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JesseKellyDC Also, how the hell would she genuinely know there wasn't?
1330294210344472576 2020-11-22 07:37:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ? There is no transition process at this point. @JoeBiden has not been certified the winner and the election is contested.
1330293903531053059 2020-11-22 07:35:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No. One. Cares. Give us the vaccines and antibodies, and let us go on with our lives.
1330292723308498947 2020-11-22 07:31:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @freep Plenty of evidence showing significant fraud.

1330292237327065088 2020-11-22 07:29:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump What's the status of the Eli Lilly antibodies? Can we get those? A lot easier to cure the smaller number that get sick than to vaccinate the entire population.
1330274827798798341 2020-11-22 06:20:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Of course antibodies provide lasting immunity. The #PartyOfScience doesn't stay so sciencey when they can make something up to attack Trump.

1330273550561914880 2020-11-22 06:15:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScotsFyre @BernieSanders knows, he's just a coward and wouldn't do anything about it.
1330273374480855040 2020-11-22 06:14:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> All I want before I die is that a "lazy summer Sunday afternoon" becomes something that is possible one more time in America.
1330262308178845697 2020-11-22 05:30:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Exactly. I tested negative in the ER but I'm pretty damn certain I had it.
1330261959074340865 2020-11-22 05:29:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm not familiar with anybody by that name being the president-elect.
1330246205167775747 2020-11-22 04:26:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody. Because 95% of the party is behind @realDonaldTrump's re re-election bid.
1330245500826685441 2020-11-22 04:23:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Um, Trump. Working class people. Faith &amp; family. Right up their alley.
1330244672866947075 2020-11-22 04:20:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The fatal conceit here is thinking that this one guy's "conscience" should rule Utah instead of consciences of the millions of Americans who live in his state.
1330243766754611202 2020-11-22 04:16:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RepAndyBiggsAZ @TrumpStudents Folks, life ain't safe. You risk getting a million different diseases, being struck by lighting, or dying in a car crash every time you walk out your front door.
1330243168017805313 2020-11-22 04:14:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's about time we got rid of @SpeakerPelosi. An insurgent Republican House would be great. More grassroots over there, not establishment Republicans in the Senate. Trump supporters should mobilize to take the House.
1330242490583166978 2020-11-22 04:11:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He did not. There is no president elect. No election winner has been certified.
1330242280335286276 2020-11-22 04:10:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So you agree with @realDonaldTrump that tech companies have too much power, exploitation of cheap foreign labor is bad, and antitrust lawsuits must be brought?
1330237054790356994 2020-11-22 03:50:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh shut up. Enough with your bullcrap.
1330210796740210690 2020-11-22 02:05:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScotsFyre We need to build back America first, not "better" according to the globalists (i.e. America subservient to other nations and large unaccountable global corporations).
1330210255029084162 2020-11-22 02:03:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> People saying @realDonaldTrump will face legal troubles once out of office - why hasn't @BarackObama been sued for all he's worth and locked up?
1330209186853101579 2020-11-22 01:59:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze They've been at this ever since they got mad about conservative email chains.
1330208792248717323 2020-11-22 01:57:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MattBraynard @ScotsFyre @BarackObama Yes. I hate these stupid vague apocalyptic statements. "Harming democracy" what does that even mean? It just means they didn't get their way (because "democracy" functioned correctly) and they are mad about it.
1330193689398882307 2020-11-22 00:57:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AnotherWildBull @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Abandoning the youth? We're busy working to put food on the table and a roof over their head. We're paying for their health insurance until age 26. We're letting them live at home forever. We are literally doing everything for them. But yes we do need to abolish public education.
1330193334225281037 2020-11-22 00:56:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @newtgingrich I mean we already have them. They're called public schools and universities.
1330192391630938115 2020-11-22 00:52:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara It is true. I work in a hospital. I visit patient floors regularly.

1330178328217722885 2020-11-21 23:56:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AnotherWildBull @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Who said the goal was "bringing people together"? That's not the goal. The goal is to win.
1330174376000561152 2020-11-21 23:40:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara It's a thing, but probably no more than 5-10% of what hospitals deal with on a daily basis.

1330160591969902597 2020-11-21 22:46:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @HTX_Con @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump He's the (very successful) president of the United States and the leader of our party.
1330155801399484424 2020-11-21 22:27:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Maybe you should be nicer to him. Treat him like a kindly old grandfather. You know, the way you'd cover @JoeBiden.
1330155242084847622 2020-11-21 22:24:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh.
1330154800785338370 2020-11-21 22:23:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> After @realDonaldTrump wins, we need a purge of every party member who was not loyal to their president.
1330154323968405514 2020-11-21 22:21:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1330076353958436864 2020-11-21 17:11:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Is this code?
1330076146575298561 2020-11-21 17:10:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Funny, that's actually the @realDonaldTrump plan.
1329980300601024513 2020-11-21 10:49:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "conspiracy theory" There they go, at it again.
1329958250813468672 2020-11-21 09:22:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL projection again
1329957830267465728 2020-11-21 09:20:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They just changed 200k votes.
1329957640668114944 2020-11-21 09:19:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Plenty of proof. Are you blind?
1329957321569689602 2020-11-21 09:18:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Judge just ruled 200k ballots in PA are invalid.
1329956614317731841 2020-11-21 09:15:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And by "black voters" she means "the extra ballots we added".
1329956413184102406 2020-11-21 09:14:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll @gatewaypundit That's over 50% total. We have a consenus, despite the lies of the media and the quisling @GOP establishment.
1329956092525375495 2020-11-21 09:13:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You will respect the decision of the courts, Tapper.
1329955914972094468 2020-11-21 09:12:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So @realDonaldTrump won PA and all bets are off! Expect similar results in MI and WI. Also, when the media declares that @JoeBiden won, they are a pack of liars.
1329955196479401984 2020-11-21 09:10:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The outcome is not certain, and you saying Biden won doesn't make that outcome any more likely.
1329954945358028802 2020-11-21 09:09:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And @BernieSanders knows what he's talking about! He folded like a cheap suit to a doddering, senile old man.
1329933548409806848 2020-11-21 07:44:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Goes to hospitals and front line workers first. Then the elderly and high risk.  Then employees.
1329933166514212864 2020-11-21 07:42:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Check the signatures!
1329926604726947846 2020-11-21 07:16:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LIES
1329926411713392642 2020-11-21 07:15:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because he didn't cause those deaths? Because they were caused by @JoeBiden's masters in the Communist Party of China?
1329916865544597504 2020-11-21 06:37:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I will never concede the election to @JoeBiden or refer to him as President-Elect while Dems and the media refuse to even consider the possibility that the election was legitimately fraudulent.
1329910275932385280 2020-11-21 06:11:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @zerohedge @dbongino Good. It's finally effective.
1329910182998990848 2020-11-21 06:11:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @catturd2 @JDRucker They got caught cheating and they know it. Now they have to RUN!
1329909241973444608 2020-11-21 06:07:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If the media had treated @JoeBiden with 1/10th the animosity they routinely show @realDonaldTrump, he would have crumbled immediately.
1329908247235620865 2020-11-21 06:03:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JedediahBila LOL federal government cybersecurity was probably the one that created it, to manipulate foreign elections. Of course they've got to cover their butts.
1329907527090368516 2020-11-21 06:00:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Or the more likely story, he's telling the truth and the media is lying (as usual).
1329907384140050432 2020-11-21 06:00:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Right. Election was stolen.
1329906795280789506 2020-11-21 05:57:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. He tried tice to pass it, but @SpeakerPelosi and House Dems voted it down for political reasons. They were trying to steal money for unrelated purposes.
1329905298904059913 2020-11-21 05:51:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A little birdie tells me the Pfizer vaccine will be arriving at hospitals MONDAY!!!
1329892029254545410 2020-11-21 04:59:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why on earth would would name a company "Dominion"? Unless the service you are selling to powerful global and corporate interests is... political dominion. Election rigging!
1329889579793526785 2020-11-21 04:49:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeTalkShow @JDRucker @Twitter The left somehow thinks their "fact checkers", who routinely get things wrong, are a substitute for the courts.
1329889287236620288 2020-11-21 04:48:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... no. They teach socialism in government schools. Keeping them closed is a good thing!
1329888542915502081 2020-11-21 04:45:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @justin_hart @MelissaTweets @realDonaldTrump How do you *lose* votes when a batch of new votes is added?
1329888109090238466 2020-11-21 04:43:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump never wanted anyone to tout "unfounded" accusations, you idiot. He wanted them founded.

1329869513882562567 2020-11-21 03:29:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What is REALLY FREAKING IRRITATING is how the press discounts the conservative point of view and refuses to cover it, but later when it turns out to be valid and they're asked why it wasn't covered, they say "oh well conservatives already brought it up". Hello???
1329868579882328065 2020-11-21 03:25:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> An election involving 150 million people may have been subverted by Dems in collusion with foreign communist powers, but what's really important here is a drop of sweat on Giuliani's jowl.
1329867244445241345 2020-11-21 03:20:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is utter BS. I work in a hospital in rural Oklahoma. PLENTY OF BEDS. One floor out of 9 is reserved for COVID patients.
1329866974982266884 2020-11-21 03:19:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Were you under the impression that the minimum wage was supposed to be tied to the net worth of one individual in particular?

1329831350686412801 2020-11-21 00:57:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL Dems voted the bill down twice.
1329831272294871051 2020-11-21 00:57:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because, as usual, Dems are trying to take advantage of a life or death crisis to get money from taxpayers for unrelated things. Crooks!
1329830775777341446 2020-11-21 00:55:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It should be ready on Monday.

1329829348678004740 2020-11-21 00:49:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> OMG *eyeroll*. Give me a break! You've been trying to overturn the legitimate 2016 election for four years. Trump is using the established legal process to root out fraud.
1329828980011266055 2020-11-21 00:48:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec They should approve it today, ship it tomorrow. Why is this so hard?

1329828635801423874 2020-11-21 00:47:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dems do have a large constituency with the deceased.
1329828262319710215 2020-11-21 00:45:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not a gambit. Why are you defending Dem voter fraud? This is why establishment Republicans are worthless.

1329688626393919491 2020-11-20 15:30:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHAHA YES! They're forced to join @parler_app where there is NO CENSORSHIP.
1329673673347887104 2020-11-20 14:31:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> By having a normally functioning economy and society.
1329666844790231041 2020-11-20 14:04:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Obama? Ended 4 years ago.
1329666015500902400 2020-11-20 14:00:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... no. Trump to Trump does not require any transition.
1329664801488957440 2020-11-20 13:56:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Womp womp.
1329664531841363969 2020-11-20 13:55:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is where we're moving when the time comes. Y'all know what I'm talking about. Prepare.
1329663808541962240 2020-11-20 13:52:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fortunately, in America, the people are sovereign, not some washed up establishment hacks masquerading as "conservatives".
1329641359167401985 2020-11-20 12:22:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank Agree, with the caveat that it's increasing likely that he finds enough evidence to actually have a case.
1329641135397097472 2020-11-20 12:22:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And he will, plus a feather in his cap for being President, that's PRESIDENT, @realDonaldTrump's top lawyer.
1329640938919038977 2020-11-20 12:21:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Amen.
1329640683255304192 2020-11-20 12:20:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker @TuckerCarlson @SidneyPowell1 He *has* always been a bit of a misogynist, ever since the Palin days.
1329640508201836546 2020-11-20 12:19:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS
1329640382024519680 2020-11-20 12:19:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I guess we're anti stimulus checks now?
1329639483181060096 2020-11-20 12:15:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDailyWire HAHA they should all run. Every single Trump family member and associate, in various states. Built in base. FLOOD THE ZONE
1329639213273329670 2020-11-20 12:14:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When can we get rid of this lying fool? Why is he even still in the GOP?
1329639031177670657 2020-11-20 12:13:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nakedly partisan. They're running scared now. Trying to destroy the credibility of @RudyGiuliani, which remains perfectly intact.
1329627852640301060 2020-11-20 11:29:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Psssh. Nope! Biden won't last a year. It'll Kamala and Pelosi cooking up harebrained schemes to destroy America and McConnell mostly powerless to stop it.
1329627558753701890 2020-11-20 11:28:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EpochTimes That would be... interesting. Who decides what that one vote is? A majority of the congresspeople from that state? Can they pick a third option besides Trump or Biden? Is there anyone that would be universally trusted to be president? LOL make @joerogan president.
1329627018368065537 2020-11-20 11:25:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM
1329626937573208066 2020-11-20 11:25:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Listen, all this back and forth does not matter. The truth will come out in the courts. The only opinions that matter are those of the SCOTUS justices who will decide the case.
1329626503873753091 2020-11-20 11:23:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If Democrats could baselessly scream "Russian collusion" for 4 years, we can CERTAINLY investigate whether there was Chinese collusion when there is good evidence to suggest that possibility.
1329624475290230786 2020-11-20 11:15:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDailyWire Of course her answer to everything is welfare. But even if you have food stamps, you have to have functioning grocery stores to spend them.
1329624253331877888 2020-11-20 11:14:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sounds great! Fire up the presses and give everybody $100k in cash. If nobody is working, I guess we burn it to heat our homes?
1329623714804150273 2020-11-20 11:12:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Anyone who covers for cheating Dems cannot be taken seriously.
1329623168454111233 2020-11-20 11:10:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara The election does not rest on which cable news show hosts think the election was rigged or not. It will be decided in the courts.
1329594639431720961 2020-11-20 09:17:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I was super sick, went to the ER, and they said I was negative. Don't believe it.
1329593719645986816 2020-11-20 09:13:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We have. 100k fraudulent Biden votes in the dead of night in Michigan, after counting was supposed to be done for the night.
1329593068165730306 2020-11-20 09:11:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I've made my pick as well.
1329592870450376705 2020-11-20 09:10:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1329592539385634816 2020-11-20 09:08:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara If you listened to the press conference, they haven't had the opportunity yet. They will, this was their opening argument in the case.
1329512555203719178 2020-11-20 03:51:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Affidavits are witness testimony under oath. That is legally admissible evidence.
1329512443341643779 2020-11-20 03:50:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @RudyGiuliani We shall see. Sworn affidavits are pretty strong. You go to jail if you lie on those - not much incentive to do so.
1329512280262893572 2020-11-20 03:50:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Uh... he said he had enough without that. But there are plenty of red flags with Dominion and Dem city political machines that they are still pursuing.
1329511498083864587 2020-11-20 03:46:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara 100k Dem vote dumps being overturned would change that
1329510318545002498 2020-11-20 03:42:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @RudyGiuliani He has tons, he said what he has, and he will prove it in court.
1329509822732120064 2020-11-20 03:40:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara He just did. Did you miss the press conference? Sworn. Affidavits. Under oath.
1329497903006670849 2020-11-20 02:52:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why is foreign interference in our election a laughing matter to you?
1329497182345588738 2020-11-20 02:50:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> She alleged that they switched GOP votes to Dem, not vice versa. #Idiot
1329496293580943365 2020-11-20 02:46:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara They have evidence. They are putting it up. Court cases take time.
1329495994057289730 2020-11-20 02:45:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Turns out all the foreign interference in the elections was on the Dem side. Venezuela, Canada, China. Of course - they always project what they are doing onto the other side.
1329495589835431938 2020-11-20 02:43:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You literally just lied in this tweet. The claims are NOT baseless, there are tons of sworn affidavits!
1329494997004136450 2020-11-20 02:41:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RudyGiuliani: LEEEEEEROOOOOOY JEEEEEEEEEEENKINS
1329484513005723648 2020-11-20 01:59:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's not real, but even if it were a slightly warmer atmosphere would only be great for a greener world.
1329484114198720516 2020-11-20 01:58:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @secupp You're about to lose.
1329483859700936706 2020-11-20 01:57:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaang. With all this cheating, was @BarackObama's election illegitimate as well?
1329483363774828546 2020-11-20 01:55:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Which he's not.
1329480338662453251 2020-11-20 01:43:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's a GREAT idea.
1329480204704751616 2020-11-20 01:42:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC Democrats think that precedent equals law. "Oh we've been doing this for 60 years, it's fine." No, it's not fine, and we're going to stop it here and now.
1329479907420893185 2020-11-20 01:41:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This means 54%, A MAJORITY, do not believe @realDonaldTrump should concede right now!
1329479707117707268 2020-11-20 01:40:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Screw the CDC. Give us the damn antibodies and let us go about our business.
1329459418065494021 2020-11-20 00:20:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AmandaPresto @JackPosobiec If you have a wife that is trying to use the power of the state to compel your behavior... you have serious marriage problems.
1329452799390789634 2020-11-19 23:53:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LPDonovan He says he does have a viable path to victory.
1329428255519240199 2020-11-19 22:16:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TomKattman @LegInsurrection Luckily @dbongino is busy creating his own platforms.
1329427703745945601 2020-11-19 22:13:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Greenhouse gases are good. Plants love CO2.
1329427402670346241 2020-11-19 22:12:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's what a @JoeBiden election does to an economy. Before the election the numbers were always better than expected.
1329426874573991936 2020-11-19 22:10:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This does not work from a systemic point of view. You cannot build a business or an economy with this philosophy. Everybody is entitled and nobody does any work, leading to suffering for everyone. Leave this to church and family.
1329425725187911680 2020-11-19 22:06:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That and not having won the election.
1329424730269622272 2020-11-19 22:02:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Let's kill the #DeepState
1329423922593472512 2020-11-19 21:58:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I have no debt, so I just want $50k in cash.
1329317263611228160 2020-11-19 14:55:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AnnCoulter I guess that's why @IlhanMN hates us.
1329317020077322241 2020-11-19 14:54:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If only we had chosen one of those. So many people that should have been locked up. Obama, Biden, Hillary, Brennan, Holder, Clapper, Rice, Soros, Jarrett, Schiff, Nadler, Pelosi, Reid, etc etc etc
1329315918262964229 2020-11-19 14:49:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker Who still watches cable anyway? Nobody needs a bunch of fake narratives on TV to tell them how to think.
1329267860221390848 2020-11-19 11:38:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benshapiro Although, as a practicing Jew, you should be very familiar with the Year of Jubilee. Clears out the system every 50 years I guess.
1329267188184870914 2020-11-19 11:36:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EmeraldRobinson And did @HillaryClinton wipe them... with a cloth?
1329266503175303171 2020-11-19 11:33:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Give the damn vaccine to people! Why are we holding back and letting people die?
1329266244458061824 2020-11-19 11:32:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @awstar11 And you also have to keep in mind there are professors who are paid large sums of money to do nothing but teach this crap.
1329265755628728322 2020-11-19 11:30:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I believe the government should stay out of my house too. Just too small. Anyone I want to kill inside it, I can do so.
1329265475277172740 2020-11-19 11:29:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who the hell cares? Get back to work.
1329240115529605120 2020-11-19 09:48:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ugh. Why did I ever support you?
1329239608077529088 2020-11-19 09:46:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I want to see everything that Twitter bans or adds context labels to. Can I do that?
1329233778791870465 2020-11-19 09:23:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SebGorka Why does everyone think you need a "study" with a approved opinion given to you by great and mighty Scientists to know anything? Obviously breathing on people less helps. But probably when you are in close quarters, not out in public, which is the reverse of how we do it.
1329232718786334720 2020-11-19 09:19:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hey I love it. Parents are finding alternatives. Everyone knew the public school system was pointless already.
1329185649388351495 2020-11-19 06:12:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I would follow McConaughey anywhere.
1329184811668398081 2020-11-19 06:08:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL cases are like three times as high as the previous surge when everybody was freaking out and now no one cares.
1329167790759141376 2020-11-19 05:01:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Will they just recount the fraudulent ballots or will somebody be checking them?
1329167545782456322 2020-11-19 05:00:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) Half-Jamaican descendant of a slave owner, so not really "black" B) That's not why we're upset, it's her leftists politics (and general flooziness)

1329166617620733958 2020-11-19 04:56:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 10/10 would vote for @McConaughey
1329165989976608768 2020-11-19 04:54:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealKyleMorris @TrumpStudents @realDonaldTrump I mean, I would say it's an open question, depending on how much Democrat election fraud happened. Definitely needs to be investigated.
1329165486177849346 2020-11-19 04:52:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (@realDonaldTrump won't be calling)
1329122654356447232 2020-11-19 02:01:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell is she smoking? @realDonaldTrump had the economy soaring in 2019, lowest unemployment ever, and we all know it. Something she and Obama could never do. She's starting to lose her marbles too.
1329122132505276417 2020-11-19 01:59:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara I would hope they do! We have the vaccines and antibodies. Get them to people before Christmas, get everybody cured. Then we go back to work. No more stalling! Let's get this recovery on the road.

1329104118724648961 2020-11-19 00:48:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump is saving lives right now, and has been the entire time. Biden won't do crap - he's not mentally competent.
1329103907331706880 2020-11-19 00:47:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What's treasonous is the coups they tried to pull for 4 years when @realDonaldTrump legitimately won the election.
1329103468737531906 2020-11-19 00:45:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Please. We had hanging chads in Florida in 2000, and it eventually got resolved. Close races need scrutiny to avoid miscounts / cheating.
1329090559915376643 2020-11-18 23:54:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That we believe in a Constitution and God given, inalienable rights to freedom, private property, life, pursuit of happiness, etc etc - not subject to the temporary whims of the majority at any given time.
1329086370757820419 2020-11-18 23:37:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell is wrong with them?
1329086118571065346 2020-11-18 23:36:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I've seen enough. The election was clearly tainted with massive fraud.
1329085793982287874 2020-11-18 23:35:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benshapiro BREAKING (wind)
1329085471566168066 2020-11-18 23:34:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... since the election is not settled, your first sentence invalidates the third.
1329084812997496833 2020-11-18 23:31:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not true at all. Only close elections.
1329057421298425856 2020-11-18 21:42:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? @realDonaldTrump reduced that gap through low black unemployment, opportunity zones, etc. @JoeBiden will do the OPPOSITE to serve his upper class white base that voted for him.
1329057029000994816 2020-11-18 21:41:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jgarzik Why the hell is bitcoin surging *now*? It's not like anyone new is adopting it.
1329056438854049792 2020-11-18 21:38:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> TERRIBLE
1329055857011732481 2020-11-18 21:36:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL this is just pharma companies trying to one up each other. Pfizer said 90%, so Moderna said 94%, so Pfizer now says 95%. We get it guys, they work.
1328940427140079617 2020-11-18 13:57:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hopefully not ever getting what they want from Dems will kill off progressivism forever.
1328940022859522048 2020-11-18 13:56:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jsolomonReports After they flipped the whole election, of course.
1328925321966587906 2020-11-18 12:57:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL this was obvious from the start, they just hate @realDonaldTrump so they changed the definition of immunity and said it was only good for a few months.
1328924932579995650 2020-11-18 12:56:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is the real cost to our nation of electing Biden over Trump. We almost had school choice and private education. Now we'll have some crappy union goon indoctrinating kids with leftism instead of teaching them anything.
1328904909543133184 2020-11-18 11:36:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Democrats have a different conception of elections than we do. They don't believe in one person one vote. To them its a game to see how many ballots they can force the system to accept.
1328904613202980866 2020-11-18 11:35:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't see how it's possible. But we can certainly hope. Have to find hard evidence that enough votes were changed to change the outcome of the election. If so, SCOTUS would uphold Trump.
1328904101686616066 2020-11-18 11:33:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL are they banning and censoring you too? Mm hmm. Ok.
1328903612949549063 2020-11-18 11:31:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Spoken too soon.
1328903447920472064 2020-11-18 11:30:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Governor probably threatened to lock them up. Or lock them down. Same diff.
1328902887792107522 2020-11-18 11:28:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES! Fire the entire deep state.
1328902690152255490 2020-11-18 11:27:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> One can dream.
1328902539174088704 2020-11-18 11:27:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. The election is not over. We have a legal process to resolve disputes and it will be followed.
1328902305543032834 2020-11-18 11:26:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Another #DeepStater bites the dust. Good riddance! Covering for Dem election fraud.
1328902066077659144 2020-11-18 11:25:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SenTedCruz @jack I think we can all agree at this point that Twitter is a left wing publisher and does not pay its content producers. The @HuffPost model!
1328901620458008578 2020-11-18 11:23:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ugh, no, we live in a Constitutional Republic. Representatives of the government are elected democratically, but that does not mean they can subvert the Constitution or trample on people's rights.
1328846080398778371 2020-11-18 07:42:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Try working at a job for a change.
1328845866027847681 2020-11-18 07:41:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Rats jumping ship.
1328845539983691776 2020-11-18 07:40:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because you censor us.
1328845377857085443 2020-11-18 07:40:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why do big government lovers think that distributing a vaccine is "hard"? There are a thousand different ways to ship something from point A to point B.
1328845133744320515 2020-11-18 07:39:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well we sure as hell better delay it then because @JoeBiden is certainly not competent enough to distribute it. @realDonaldTrump is, and its actually as simple as having military planes fly it around to hospitals.
1328825507694206979 2020-11-18 06:21:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Freaking establishment. Always sending our kids off to die in foreign countries alone, gibbering, and afraid - just to increase their global power.
1328778274974130188 2020-11-18 03:13:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why would our economy need to be kept "at bay"? We need a recovery right now.
1328773816806412288 2020-11-18 02:55:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Bryan_E_Leib @JasonMillerinDC @TeamTrump Hmm de hmm hmm. If this gains momentum and systematic Democrat machine politics cheating are revealed... all bets are off.
1328773305004945408 2020-11-18 02:53:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Your daily reminder that we live in a Constitutional Republic where the God given rights of individuals are not subject to the whims of the current majority. If we can all just get this one thing straight, we'll be fine.
1328772875902447617 2020-11-18 02:51:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fall short of righteousness. Not leftism.
1328739347596718083 2020-11-18 00:38:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why didn't @realDonaldTrump do this immediately?

1328738910940385281 2020-11-18 00:36:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @johnrobertsFox @BretBaier @Twitter @jack @CBPMarkMorgan Yeah whatever @jack saying "oopsies my bad" after every nefarious thing Twitter does still doesn't fix the problem.
1328738705528516608 2020-11-18 00:36:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) "Looks like" America is irrelevant to the job qualifications. Let's not be racist. B) "Expertise in governing" is a negative, code for #DeepState  C) @realDonaldTrump delivered results for working families, you delivered stagnation and job loss for 8 years.
1328618665361764352 2020-11-17 16:39:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm not sure how that was your decision, but ok. I wouldn't advertise your failures to the world.
1328618473224884224 2020-11-17 16:38:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pfizer it is then.
1328618301048680449 2020-11-17 16:37:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LeonHWolf Much like the health insurance / health provider inflationary spiral, we have the student loan / education provider inflationary spiral.
1328501155685675009 2020-11-17 08:52:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I regret to inform you that the Dems are at it again.
1328500630118412288 2020-11-17 08:50:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @seanmdav @ScotsFyre *sigh* MUST we develop a conservative alternative for every tech company out there? You cannot stop free speech.
1328500166870097921 2020-11-17 08:48:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara How it happens is Democrats involved in the counting process. FRAUD!

1328499615595974656 2020-11-17 08:46:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra "Oops sorry we accidentally disenfranchised 2600 Trump voters."  Media: nothing to see here
1328473371592568832 2020-11-17 07:01:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So money will be worthless. Are we going to use some other form of legal tender or just go straight to bartering chickens for health care?
1328465788030881803 2020-11-17 06:31:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Republicans have been doing that for 4 years and you've done nothing but obstruct.
1328465537890979843 2020-11-17 06:30:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Not really strange, but yeah. The globalist establishment loves foreign wars to increase their power.
1328429944200945665 2020-11-17 04:09:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Actually, theft is always wrong. It's like if I point a gun at you, make you give me $50k, and then tell you "deal with it, forgiveness is good!"
1328410542315347975 2020-11-17 02:52:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dbongino Or to put it better, money is just paper. What matters is the labor required to produce goods and services. These people believe they are entitled to the labor of others, without contributing anything themselves.
1328409869129572352 2020-11-17 02:49:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen Because stupid rubes shut up shut up shut up.
1328368725242810368 2020-11-17 00:05:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shouldn't affect it in the slightest, unless you guys are acting nefariously.
1328366351094849536 2020-11-16 23:56:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good. We need a space free from censorship.
1328365731277381633 2020-11-16 23:54:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Jealousy is a new look for the Reagan family.

1328365116375621634 2020-11-16 23:51:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> But your Antifa base does.
1328360375860023297 2020-11-16 23:32:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Smooth? LOL
1328359894416842752 2020-11-16 23:30:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Twitter is garbage.
1328221489406103553 2020-11-16 14:20:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It was stolen, we all know it, but they've buried the evidence so we can never prove it. America loses.
1328220422102519808 2020-11-16 14:16:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ZaidJilani Can @realDonaldTrump PLEASE abolish the Dept of Education before he leaves?
1328209507718139905 2020-11-16 13:33:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Nora8230 That would be nice. But apparently Democrat administrations in blue states can count votes (and add them) behind closed doors with no repercussions. We have no proof, after all.
1328205011415920641 2020-11-16 13:15:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank So they can just cheat behind closed doors and there is no legal remedy? Then voting is pointless.
1328203472576057346 2020-11-16 13:09:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Nora8230 You have more faith in blue state Democrats than I do.

1328194384546975745 2020-11-16 12:33:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @michaelbd @snarkandboobs @JoeBiden just saddled you with $50,000 of someone else's student loans. Just free money for those who were financially irresponsible.
1328193675051094016 2020-11-16 12:30:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra Get ready for your doctor to have no medical training. Feel safe?

1328159503305617409 2020-11-16 10:14:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They are not. The American people are important to American economic growth. Duh.
1328140664505315329 2020-11-16 08:59:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's doctorsplaining.
1328140499576877057 2020-11-16 08:59:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> OK well we can just dissolve the country and be a collection of states then.

1328107398054211584 2020-11-16 06:47:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews I cut the cord long ago. Cable is a dying relic of a pre-Internet age.

1327992162080919554 2020-11-15 23:09:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll Which means that if he does get inaugurated, there's going to be a hell of a media industry opposing him for any conservatives who want to take advantage of it.
1327991242039365634 2020-11-15 23:05:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We need to root out Democrat election fraud.
1327990483881242625 2020-11-15 23:02:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL reap what you sow, Dems.
1327989497561223169 2020-11-15 22:59:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dbongino If you allow free speech, people will believe and share conservative things. Can't have that!
1327989237044613120 2020-11-15 22:58:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Uh... no not if the election was rigged. Lawsuits!

1327883639988883456 2020-11-15 15:58:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell does that do for me? If you want to help, enact conservative policies. (You won't.)
1327881187034062848 2020-11-15 15:48:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL how much? Conservatives need to pool their money, buy it, fire everyone that works there, and turn it into a conservative news network.
1327878992842678272 2020-11-15 15:39:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (There is no violence from the right.)

1327878149376446464 2020-11-15 15:36:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... no. In a few months, things will be much different. First of all, Trump will have already ended the pandemic. Second, @JoeBiden will not be sentient. Third, Trump will be taking his 2nd term.
1327790779125862401 2020-11-15 09:49:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why? Why do we do this to ourselves? Is it just to keep the masses poor?

1327759833458765824 2020-11-15 07:46:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'll donate to stop that guy, that's for sure.
1327759124696862722 2020-11-15 07:43:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ChooseCommon @varadmehta @Neoavatara Really depends on how I feel about the establishment. Chortling about how smart they were to get Trump out of office yet demanding my vote for the Senate makes it less likely.
1327739852037758985 2020-11-15 06:27:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @mmdd2006 You literally had the power to go and vote for him, and you chose not to.
1327739741966622723 2020-11-15 06:26:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Uh... it is.
1327739674618716161 2020-11-15 06:26:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ChooseCommon @varadmehta @Neoavatara That will happen, and did happen, because Republicans did not vote for Trump.
1327739579324043264 2020-11-15 06:25:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @varadmehta @Neoavatara A Republican who wants a Biden Presidency is not a Republican and shouldn't pretend to be one.
1327739375065714690 2020-11-15 06:25:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @kyjeeper65 @Neoavatara Still needed school choice, but close.
1327681987512037376 2020-11-15 02:37:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @mmdd2006 @Neoavatara I don't work in the industry. I'm as content with a Democrat senate as the establishment elites are with Trump losing the presidency to the Dems.
1327680357144129537 2020-11-15 02:30:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Well your previous tweet did. Just saying, if the establishment isn't willing to play ball and just wants to let the Dems have it, the base can do the same. Good luck!
1327680047587745799 2020-11-15 02:29:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. And you guys shut down public schools anyway.

1327675165661130759 2020-11-15 02:10:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Conservatives need to focus on taking over education and the media. Nothing changes, long term, until we do this. Those who control what people think have the ultimate power in America.

1327535732634882048 2020-11-14 16:55:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Notice how no Dems are even trying to find evidence of Republican voter fraud? Everybody knows which party the fraud is in.
1327532956995514368 2020-11-14 16:44:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You don't actually *need* a laptop to survive. Did you know their are hospitals full of people who are dying? If only they had had a laptop.

1327371437519331328 2020-11-14 06:03:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL yeah that's what happens if @JoeBiden wins instead of @realDonaldTrump. The people didn't vote for this - the election was stolen.
1327370951483416578 2020-11-14 06:01:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CSinclairtv @OANN @realDonaldTrump We have to wait two months, then after the vaccines have been distributed and the virus is gone, Biden will shut everything down.
1327370622696034305 2020-11-14 05:59:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So just ignoring reality then?
1327370079252721682 2020-11-14 05:57:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @HotlineJosh Yes, um, because we live in, um, reality.

1327346768451956737 2020-11-14 04:25:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I just find it hard to believe that the actual will of the people was to elect... @JoeBiden. They found votes somewhere, but the people wanted Trump.
1327346317803315203 2020-11-14 04:23:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent.
1327345789228736514 2020-11-14 04:21:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay!

1327290614166278145 2020-11-14 00:41:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Exactly. Winning or losing is irrelevant. The fight is to stop Dems from rigging election after election.
1327273367460777985 2020-11-13 23:33:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sure, shut it down. Too much "education" i.e. brainwashing these days anyway.
1327258400447733760 2020-11-13 22:33:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If Biden wins because of the pandemic... and he has close ties to China... think he had anything to do with it?
1327256354713694208 2020-11-13 22:25:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Resist. Obstruct. Sabotage.

1327120747312123906 2020-11-13 13:26:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze It was based zero on race and 100% on his leftism and incompetence that ruined our country for years.
1327120398551572482 2020-11-13 13:25:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL its a race between how fast Dems can make up votes and how fast Republicans can get the court to strike them down.

1327025387117883392 2020-11-13 07:08:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We have to keep Republicans in the Senate or Dems will see to it that food banks are not able to handle the demand.

1326974474097487878 2020-11-13 03:45:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank Why is there a double senate election in GA? Aren't they supposed to be staggered?
1326974165145038848 2020-11-13 03:44:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh dang! Well if that's the case then the election in PA is certainly invalid.
1326925653153886208 2020-11-13 00:31:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We never should have locked down for the pandemic. We killed the economy and @realDonaldTrump still lost.

1326767070978191364 2020-11-12 14:01:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Without AZ, is there any path to victory for @realDonaldTrump? He'd have to get Michigan overturned. That or get electors to change their votes.
1326765584818851841 2020-11-12 13:55:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MZHemingway @GrahamTAllison True, Republican legislatures could simply send their own slate of electors. Dems would scream and howl about it not representing the will of the people. But an argument can be made that after all the fraud &amp; hoaxes we've seen from the Dems for 4 years, it's time to play hardball
1326763434218823681 2020-11-12 13:47:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump may not win in the end, but he still needs to fight the battle. It exposes Dems and media for the frauds and hypocrites they are, and reminds them that they can't always get away with it.
1326755818637815817 2020-11-12 13:16:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump deserves a Medal of Honor for all the fighting he's done for us.
1326755195766910976 2020-11-12 13:14:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RpwWilliams @MZHemingway Maybe this platform is not worth as much any more. The whole point was free speech. Now they're telling us what to think (and it's all lies). Why do new technologies that allow people to speak freely always end up in Orwellian thought control?

1326613735868428288 2020-11-12 03:52:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because he has not won.
1326612114195308549 2020-11-12 03:45:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? @realDonaldTrump WAS the third way. There is Republicans, Democrats, and Trump. There is no fourth way. Just leftist Dems by another name.

1326553470728433677 2020-11-11 23:52:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> All Americans do have guaranteed healthcare. It is illegal to turn people away from the ER. We're talking about health insurance and who pays for it, not who gets care.
1326552956049616899 2020-11-11 23:50:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous. Wasting taxpayer dollars on a fake bogeyman to grow government.

1326422144914513921 2020-11-11 15:10:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democracy = slavery. The majority enslave the minority. This was literally the case with slavery in America. Why the new abolitionist party was named the REPUBLICAN party. In a Constitutional Republic, indivudual, inalienable rights are protected, especially the right to FREEDOM.
1326421050368925698 2020-11-11 15:06:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We are not a democracy and never will be. We are a Constitutional Republic. More Rome than Greece.

1326274595108827136 2020-11-11 05:24:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yikes!
1326274514066567174 2020-11-11 05:24:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> PROOF OF FRAUD!!!
1326274245765304321 2020-11-11 05:23:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) No he didn't. B) I though you were against Wall St and the corporate lobbyists? Apparently not - you'll sell out for power just like the rest of them.
1326273593387388929 2020-11-11 05:20:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent!
1326263128825401345 2020-11-11 04:39:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay!
1326242170660147202 2020-11-11 03:15:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sure. And they support @JoeBiden. I await your endorsement of @realDonaldTrump.
1326241994830647297 2020-11-11 03:15:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent!
1326239701104283648 2020-11-11 03:05:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FRAUD!
1326239639934558209 2020-11-11 03:05:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DavidShafer @MelissaTweets @ajc Wow. So Twitter's official position is that there is no evidence of irregularity in the election? They are now complicit.
1326239195384393735 2020-11-11 03:03:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Current state of the race: PA likely to be overturned due to voter fraud - illegitimate ballots received after the election thrown out Trump has won NC Trump likely to win AZ So where are we at with GA? If he wins that, he could win the election.
1326238590792331271 2020-11-11 03:01:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nice!
1326215791742693381 2020-11-11 01:30:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Holy crap you guys this is who we've put in charge. A guy who wants to send the vaccine to globalists and let Americans die.
1326215602919370753 2020-11-11 01:30:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YAY!
1326215247435337735 2020-11-11 01:28:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher Ballot fraud.
1326213007777689605 2020-11-11 01:19:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL wut? Hey if he doesn't want to be in this fight, replace him as VP. Nobody said he couldn't resign.
1326212673143529473 2020-11-11 01:18:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor" was a complete lie.
1326201572381036544 2020-11-11 00:34:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So would this flip it PA to @realDonaldTrump? If so he has a very good chance of winning!
1326201224572637192 2020-11-11 00:33:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Progress would be a booming economy under @realDonaldTrump, not collectivism.
1326198413638197248 2020-11-11 00:21:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dawnharris999 @Neoavatara Yeah. So socialized healthcare, one way or the other.
1326198156128817152 2020-11-11 00:20:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Might as well make it official. @Google runs the world and is evil.
1326197839215685632 2020-11-11 00:19:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Thank God.
1326195885022343169 2020-11-11 00:11:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara I think everybody is probably ok with this outcome - ACA without the mandate. Who pays for it though, I have no idea. The federal debt I guess.
1326195177799737344 2020-11-11 00:09:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fire whoever is in charge over there, quickly.
1326194450981384194 2020-11-11 00:06:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @rand0mcharacter @JackPosobiec Literally a mountain of proof, you'd just prefer to stick your head in the sand.
1326178000954601475 2020-11-10 23:00:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. Social gatherings every night.
1326176488983506950 2020-11-10 22:54:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Third wave
1326175376201158660 2020-11-10 22:50:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Money is simply a measure of value. No, you can't magically create things of value out of thin air.
1326174849140748288 2020-11-10 22:48:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damn. Widespread election fraud was REAL and DID impact the outcome of the election.
1326168878167240712 2020-11-10 22:24:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug "The articles are factual but that helps Trump and we don't like that." Hacks!
1326164897454059520 2020-11-10 22:08:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's the best thing that ever happened to the party and the fact that you don't like him is proof of it.
1326163933644918786 2020-11-10 22:04:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We'll do exactly that. So not accept them at all.
1326163678840885253 2020-11-10 22:03:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM
1326162994737385473 2020-11-10 22:01:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC He's right. And with good reason. Democracy is terrible - God given rights are not protected. We are a Constitutional Republic.
1326162125505634305 2020-11-10 21:57:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDailyWire Funny how when spoiled brats don't get their way and have to face the real world of competing interests, they quit.
1326161152984936449 2020-11-10 21:53:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SWEET! Closer and closer. All we need is the courts to intervene in PA.
1326048681565564928 2020-11-10 14:26:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Just gonna say this, a whole lot of people are gonna be shocked, shocked I tell ya how much cheating in an election routinely occurs in blue cities and states.
1326047550655356933 2020-11-10 14:22:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Didn't I call it? Widespread voter fraud exists, but... the problem is conservatives making an issue of it.
1326047349257474049 2020-11-10 14:21:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec The problem wasn't that voter fraud was committed, you see. It's that conservatives are uncovering it and not letting it stand.
1326046866228867072 2020-11-10 14:19:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> These are not "glitches". This is software that is designed to surreptitiously add votes for Democrats.
1326045673742086147 2020-11-10 14:15:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Never unity. #Resist
1326045153447075842 2020-11-10 14:12:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A whole lot of people are prepared for @realDonaldTrump to lose after the recounts and the lawsuits are finished. Is anyone preparing for what happens if the courts overturn the election and he wins?
1326041825312985091 2020-11-10 13:59:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Does... does Twitter think that slapping a "disputed" label on any tweet they don't like will change anyone's mind? All it does is reminds people of their bias.
1325968472451518464 2020-11-10 09:08:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (The tax cuts were for middle class and working class Americans. Enriching the government does not make anybody better off.)
1325967980522565632 2020-11-10 09:06:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We really need a Trump rally right now.
1325967539084677120 2020-11-10 09:04:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. When you see their goalposts move... you know there's something there.
1325962350051069953 2020-11-10 08:43:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL sure Graham. I'm sure that's what you desperately wish for.
1325961806460968963 2020-11-10 08:41:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damage to what? You don't know that there isn't any voter fraud, and in fact there's very good evidence that there is, in Dem controlled city political machines. Normally it doesn't matter, but in a close race it does.
1325961201331957761 2020-11-10 08:39:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Don't fall for it. He's trying win GA for the Dems. He'll switch as soon as it's over.
1325960836167446529 2020-11-10 08:37:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damage to all powerful public institutions? That's kind of the point.
1325960149450756096 2020-11-10 08:35:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *a massive mountain of evidence
1325959871594967041 2020-11-10 08:34:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM EUA granted!!! Coronavirus is coming to an end. (Long before Biden ever takes office.)

1325958980749942784 2020-11-10 08:30:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 1) There is not the slightest bit of voter fraud. 2) There is no evidence of voter fraud. 3) There is no widespread voter fraud. 4) There is widespread voter fraud, but...  What will it be? Media is so predictable.
1325949015469535238 2020-11-10 07:50:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because he hasn't won the election yet. #Idiots
1325948093792186374 2020-11-10 07:47:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pretty much.
1325947586600194048 2020-11-10 07:45:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Actually agree with this, with the caveat that a win at SCOTUS is more likely if there is any merit to his case at all given the three justices he has appointed.
1325947373030428672 2020-11-10 07:44:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If we don't root out Dem voter fraud now, we never will. It's time.
1325926597950574599 2020-11-10 06:21:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It really doesn't matter how many people declare the election over. That doesn't somehow stop courts from hearing lawsuits and ruling on them.
1325925362266763264 2020-11-10 06:16:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sick.
1325924030667501568 2020-11-10 06:11:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Media is #FakeNews as always.
1325923511530098688 2020-11-10 06:09:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is exactly the opposite of what happened. The corporate lobbyists supported @JoeBiden, and I'm shocked that @SenWarren is supporting that by supporting him.
1325923338779234304 2020-11-10 06:08:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He legally may not. The election has not been certified yet and is disputed. Electors have not been chosen. Etc.
1325922835286659074 2020-11-10 06:06:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Awesome. Cocaine Mitch never makes a misstep.

1325922638695428096 2020-11-10 06:06:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I automatically RT everything Twitter says is disputed. That's how you know it's true.
1325921996581048321 2020-11-10 06:03:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EricTrump Ugh. Teneo? Then it's hopelessly compromised.
1325921418094194689 2020-11-10 06:01:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? @FoxNews is fake news. It's about time for all legacy media to die a quick death. Let's move to places like @oann, @TheFirstonTV, @newsmax, @RSBNetwork, @parler_app, @rumblevideo, etc. Media and education are where the battle must be fought.
1325920730522005506 2020-11-10 05:58:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker Same old #FakeNews. We were ignoring and resisting it a week ago, no reason why we can't continue to do the same.

1325672450252812290 2020-11-09 13:31:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra Also George W Bush fled to his ranch in Texas after a disastrous presidency in which he started a war on false pretences and got thousands of young Americans killed, a presidency so bad that Americans elected *Obama* for relief.

1325597527140413440 2020-11-09 08:34:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Really bad look for Dave Chappelle. Just blatant racism and sexism. It wasn't funny. Nobody laughed or clapped.
1325572305444081665 2020-11-09 06:54:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Exactly.
1325560073419182081 2020-11-09 06:05:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze It's going to be worse than ever under @JoeBiden, people dying left and right. And we won't be allowed to question his handling of it, a la Cuomo and nursing homes.
1325559879747186689 2020-11-09 06:04:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent! Evidence of voter fraud.
1325558769225506817 2020-11-09 06:00:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Never. Unite. #Resist
1325558651386474511 2020-11-09 05:59:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent. I'm glad you finally came around. Not much hope that we can actually find proof, but we need to try.
1325558380711321600 2020-11-09 05:58:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benshapiro You are correct, sir! Everything to them is an opportunity for bigger government. Even death.
1325518606470418432 2020-11-09 03:20:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We will never have the economy of 2019 again. Not for the rest of my lifetime. Sad, we had finally achieved as close to a utopia as you can get.

1325517576663949312 2020-11-09 03:16:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Holy crap I agree with Warren. She is suggesting NOT to unite behind @JoeBiden? TOTALLY AGREE
1325517048450060290 2020-11-09 03:14:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> INTO MY VEINS
1325516868094988289 2020-11-09 03:13:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> One thing is key. DO NOT let the media lull you into complacency. Always fight for AMERICA FIRST and call out the globalist BS.

1325507233833226240 2020-11-09 02:35:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wait, crap, we don't have the Senate either? It's 50-50 and the tiebreaker goes to Kamala Harris. We're screwed.
1325505999776718848 2020-11-09 02:30:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We must hold the line in the Senate. Gridlock for four years until we can elect another Trump to restore the country.
1325505719731417088 2020-11-09 02:29:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL. He called lids every day.

1325505223893413888 2020-11-09 02:27:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trumpism is here to stay. We must fight the globalist elites. We cannot let them steal our country from us again. America first.

1325502845156814849 2020-11-09 02:17:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> All Americans never came together to support President Trump. Neither will we support Biden.
1325499857784754176 2020-11-09 02:06:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Apparently the American people do not want peace and prosperity. We have voted for endless wars and economic decline, along with the domestic strife it brings. We are complete idiots.

1325498637594587139 2020-11-09 02:01:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Unity" means "give me all the power". I refuse.  #Resist
1325498142347948035 2020-11-09 01:59:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug I cannot support anyone who calls America "our democracy". That is leftist code for democratic socialism, and it will not be tolerated. We are a Constitutional Republic and individual rights must be protected.

1325467564194009091 2020-11-08 23:57:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How stupid do they think people are? It does no good to cut taxes if people are banned from working at said businesses.
1325466351587225602 2020-11-08 23:52:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Surprised he would even concede this.
1325464570224402437 2020-11-08 23:45:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You know it is actually possible that Dems cheated to steal an election. They do it all the time in city political machines. And they think Trump is Hitler - ends justify the means.
1325463344258686977 2020-11-08 23:41:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Can he just go ahead and call a lid on being president?
1325417087720894465 2020-11-08 20:37:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They had four years to unite with us and they chose to resist instead. There will be no reuniting.
1325413570188898304 2020-11-08 20:23:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A time to fight, a time to resist.
1325412032120844290 2020-11-08 20:17:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra The funny thing is that there is, in fact, a massive wave happening right now.
1325326734103810048 2020-11-08 14:38:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Everybody knows that the election was a complete fraud. The only question is whether anybody wants to do anything about it.
1325326106304634880 2020-11-08 14:35:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. It's toast.

1325320257280544769 2020-11-08 14:12:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 4 years, actually

1325310408446644225 2020-11-08 13:33:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realBradBrewer @JackPosobiec We will always hold a grudge against @JoeBiden for removing the best president we've ever had and replacing him with an addled dementia patient. There will be no easy "uniting" to give him unchecked power.
1325310043160457216 2020-11-08 13:31:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't care if @JoeBiden did win, I still want to see the fraud uncovered and brought to light in the courts. Don't concede, @realDonaldTrump.
1325309549490941953 2020-11-08 13:29:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Waaaa poor @secupp and her "psyche". Also, we are not a Democracy and never will be. We are a Constitutional Republic and individual rights WILL be upheld.

1325308147381235712 2020-11-08 13:24:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> These freaking a**holes. They purposely divided the country for four years with lies and hoaxes and refused to unite the country under @realDonaldTrump. All they did was resist.
1325306542741204992 2020-11-08 13:17:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Logan Act - prosecute

1325304768051486720 2020-11-08 13:10:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @snarkandboobs @realDonaldTrump has a plan, which he will be executing for the next three months. At that point, there will be nothing left for @JoeBiden to do.
1325304031145766916 2020-11-08 13:07:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze *sigh* I just want no more leftists, forever. Is that too much to ask?
1325303107337809920 2020-11-08 13:04:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump please resist these cowards and do not concede while the elections in MI, PA, and GA are under audit.
1325302866198867969 2020-11-08 13:03:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker @newtgingrich @FoxNews And Jeanine, of course.
1325301726061223937 2020-11-08 12:58:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *sigh* Of course he would. Does @realDonaldTrump believe there was fraud or not? If he does, he should not concede. At least expose it in the courts.
1325274268666630147 2020-11-08 11:09:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> All this stuff that @JoeBiden is saying he'll do doesn't mean jack squat. He will be a lame duck president hamstrung by a GOP congress, not to mention his own advancing dementia. Things don't get interesting until the 25th amendment is invoked. And even then it's still gridlock.
1325273601596149760 2020-11-08 11:07:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> All this stuff from Team Biden will be HILARIOUS if SCOTUS overturns the election.
1325273233369731072 2020-11-08 11:05:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Very seriously thinking of switching to @parler_app. There are few good accounts on Twitter any more, and Twitter has done its best to purge them. The #Resistance may have to go underground.

1325272291475918848 2020-11-08 11:01:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze @MichelleObama is about the most spiteful, hateful Democrat I can think of.
1325271805838372864 2020-11-08 10:59:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara On race? @realDonaldTrump doesn't have a racist bone in his body. What did he ever do that was racist? Massive increase in minority turn out for him.
1325263319511535616 2020-11-08 10:26:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra Also, healed from what? COVID? He's not magic. Under @realDonaldTrump America was the best its ever been.
1325261598869610496 2020-11-08 10:19:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden is going to flood our country with illegals, sticking it to @realDonaldTrump supporters. He will jack healthcare costs through the roof, and waste all our money on environmental crap. Congrats, America.
1325261190164078592 2020-11-08 10:17:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Awful.

1325260399936217089 2020-11-08 10:14:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We can never heal after the way you CCP controlled globalists have squashed @realDonaldTrump and the American dream.
1325259667010973698 2020-11-08 10:11:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Congrats on your vagina.
1325259588040527875 2020-11-08 10:11:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They never gave Trump a chance, so no.
1325259290643476482 2020-11-08 10:10:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> After four years of you guys demonizing Trump and his supporters? You literally just called us "chumps" and "ugly folks". I DONT THINK SO.
1325259004738752514 2020-11-08 10:09:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Here come the lockdowns and mandatory vaccines.
1325258594187677696 2020-11-08 10:07:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'll give @JoeBiden as much of a chance as the left gave @realDonaldTrump. BWAAAAAHAHAHA! Also the election is not over.
1325258436255379457 2020-11-08 10:06:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you really mean that @JoeBiden, appoint @realDonaldTrump to a high level position like Treasury or Commerce.
1325258191245078528 2020-11-08 10:05:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You guys impeached Trump with a hoax and tried to obstruct him at every turn. No chances for you.
1325257983576723456 2020-11-08 10:05:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stevengberman We will NEVER allow @JoeBiden and the left to consolidate unchecked power! We will NOT unite behind their socialist big government agenda!
1325257757445005312 2020-11-08 10:04:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara That would have been the case with the president after Trump if he had won. Now Biden will grow government again and it will impact everyone.
1325256293238665217 2020-11-08 09:58:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Never. We will not "unite" behind socialism.
1325254701424766979 2020-11-08 09:51:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stevengberman No. He'll be gone by January 20th. It will be Kamala Harris being nominated.

1325230758508769280 2020-11-08 08:16:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra Married women know what the left will do to their homes and communities. Trump would have protected them.

1325155413822758912 2020-11-08 03:17:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Guys. Here's how this goes:   1) @realDonaldTrump brings every possible lawsuit against election fraud. 2) Courts rule. 3a) Trump wins 3b) Trump concedes only after every possible legal resource has been exhausted.  Nothing else matters.
1325154845226098688 2020-11-08 03:15:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The left/media can scream and shout all they want but one thing they can't actually do is rule on court cases.
1325154132445941766 2020-11-08 03:12:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Biden has not won the presidential election.)

1325146882025254918 2020-11-08 02:43:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hopefully. It's not that I don't have confidence in the courts. It's that I think Dems have buried their election fraud so deep that no one will be able to prove it. If SCOTUS declares Biden the winner though, the fight is not over just because he is president.

1325121665617965062 2020-11-08 01:03:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hatred for the patriotic, working class backbone of this country is off the charts.

1325120513954361348 2020-11-08 00:58:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec They want to squash and enslave patriotic, hard-working Americans for their globalist paymasters.

1325118714942001153 2020-11-08 00:51:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher Because mail in ballots are where the fraud is.

1325020662726078464 2020-11-07 18:21:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The problem isn't that Dems didn't steal the election - they did. The problem is that blue state governments have covered their tracks well enough that there's no way to prove it.
1325019167360217088 2020-11-07 18:16:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Wow. The vendor was upgrading their software at the same moment as the ballots were being tabulated? Definitely no fraud there.
1324951433989459969 2020-11-07 13:46:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If we can all agree to accept the results from SCOTUS, we'll get through this.
1324949099741843457 2020-11-07 13:37:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Yes, USA, in case it wasn't clear.)
1324949012420702208 2020-11-07 13:37:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Colorado has fallen to the communists.
1324948251435479040 2020-11-07 13:34:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It seems that Dems and the establishment GOP have learned nothing from the last 4 years. Why does the working class always get kicked around by the elites? What are we supposed to do with our votes now? Who represents us?
1324946114949246978 2020-11-07 13:25:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> OK I declare Trump won them.
1324945865870614528 2020-11-07 13:24:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Biden can claim victory all he wants but if @realDonaldTrump wins at SCOTUS (and why wouldn't he, he appointed half of them) it doesn't matter.
1324945645367685121 2020-11-07 13:23:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM this ain't over.
1324945291586527234 2020-11-07 13:22:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So what happens to the 50% of the country that is Trump's base? They just get ignored now? Does @senatemajldr represent them? Surely such a large voting block will not go uncatered to.
1324944894788558848 2020-11-07 13:20:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Then you are NOT a conservative. Conservatives support Federalism, not a big federal government.
1324944388858974209 2020-11-07 13:18:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There is zero mandate. Dems LOST seats in the House. But Dems gonna Dem.
1324943445602017280 2020-11-07 13:15:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He certainly won't last two years. Then we'll have President Kamala, which will be so awful that Republicans will sweep 2022.
1324943280069545985 2020-11-07 13:14:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Neither of those things exist, voters don't care about them, and he didn't run on them. Actually he didn't run on much at all.
1324942877483552770 2020-11-07 13:12:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Are... are they not aware that the President and his family already had Coronavirus?
1324942694054027265 2020-11-07 13:12:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's doing no such thing. First of all, @realDonaldTrump may beat Biden's voter fraud organization in the courts. Second, even if he doesn't, he is president for 3 more months. Biden won't be sentient by that point.
1324942134177390592 2020-11-07 13:09:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Climate change does not exist. It is a fake idea used to increase government control of a population.
1324940307843207168 2020-11-07 13:02:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOP senate better damn well stop it.
1324939080786964480 2020-11-07 12:57:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Obviously. Doesn't matter now I suppose.
1324938925388013568 2020-11-07 12:57:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Biden certainly isn't going to be able to herd any cats to achieve some agenda. But Kamala will be able to, and that's what scares me.
1324938555425230848 2020-11-07 12:55:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump will always be my president. The persecution he endures from your ilk on my behalf only makes me love him even more.

1324890042779770880 2020-11-07 09:42:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden is clearly not fit to be president. Why can't he just concede and let a functioning human being continue to lead the country?

1324824246099628033 2020-11-07 05:21:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 🚨🚨🚨 They hacked the voting machines.
1324823467171188738 2020-11-07 05:18:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Feature, obviously. It's who counts the votes that matters.
1324812991922085889 2020-11-07 04:36:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PipPlays @BeigeShiba @YmeChudnik Well, if they do a full investigation I have no doubt they'll find all sorts of shenanigans in Philly and Atlanta. As Blagojevich said, it's what these political machines do.
1324809971737964546 2020-11-07 04:24:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ok, we do have one actual racist on our side, and that is @AnnCoulter. Sorry, America.
1324806499378565122 2020-11-07 04:10:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dems will just find more ballots to counteract.
1324806147589787654 2020-11-07 04:09:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Trump is both competent and sane. He is an extremely talented executive, which is how he won the presidency in the first place.)
1324805943390064646 2020-11-07 04:08:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Simping for @JoeBiden.
1324805869553463298 2020-11-07 04:08:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec LOL he would know.
1324801962651648003 2020-11-07 03:52:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Kept his campaign promises.
1324801752043003906 2020-11-07 03:52:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Thank God. My president, always.
1324800645023629314 2020-11-07 03:47:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (No curiosity as to whether said widespread fraud does indeed actually exist.)
1324800114859401216 2020-11-07 03:45:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Did anybody actually vote for Biden or are all these votes just made up? Certainly not much evidence of people voting for him.
1324799933388607490 2020-11-07 03:44:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shocker. They hacked the voting machines.
1324799616299257858 2020-11-07 03:43:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Amen! Damn ballot box stuffers.
1324799479824920576 2020-11-07 03:43:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA TEARS!
1324796445476724739 2020-11-07 03:31:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara We're only halfway there. There's still a lot of #DeepState that needs to be cleaned out. Public education (if it still exists?) is a joke - need to private it. Media still needs cleaned out as well.
1324795973294579712 2020-11-07 03:29:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah I don't think so.
1324795600131547137 2020-11-07 03:27:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Heh. Trump fundraising emails are actually interesting to read now. Insights on how the campaign is strategizing.
1324762935621832704 2020-11-07 01:17:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump 2024. That's all. NO to @NikkiHaley and all the other establishment hacks.
1324761600285384704 2020-11-07 01:12:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False??? #FakeNews
1324761019428884485 2020-11-07 01:10:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1324760351439802368 2020-11-07 01:07:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Karma will get you in the end.
1324755997290827779 2020-11-07 00:50:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @StaggySteer @KHerriage @RyanAFournier @JoeBiden 74 million Americans have mental problems, apparently. Because so does Biden.
1324755828428124162 2020-11-07 00:49:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Let's be clear... the GOP (officials, office holders, etc) is handing this election to Biden. They'd rather lose to him than win with Trump. Duly noted. They'll be out on their asses soon when Trump supporters don't show up for them.
1324754448493805569 2020-11-07 00:44:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not really. Journos are pretty useless. All propaganda, no hard news.
1324753309018820609 2020-11-07 00:39:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BenjySarlin Why... would Dems think that stimulus would help anything, if at the same time they are regulating and taxing businesses out of existence? There's nothing left to stimulate!
1324752422724640768 2020-11-07 00:36:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nevada is irrelevant.
1324748749390884865 2020-11-07 00:21:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Racist" means something entirely different to AOC. Basically it just means you're someone who won't let her get her way.
1324745999722680320 2020-11-07 00:10:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I thought Dems didn't think you are allowed to declare victory before all ballots are counted?
1324745214955819011 2020-11-07 00:07:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump And sadly, they are all about to be overturned. Depression headed our way.
1324744478855467010 2020-11-07 00:04:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @runawayjimbo @baseballcrank Uh... perfectly. Based on those things, Trump should have won.
1324743968106651650 2020-11-07 00:02:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Look, win or lose, we are fighting your fraudulent ballots all the way to SCOTUS. You WILL be held to account one way or another.
1324740839147524102 2020-11-06 23:50:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Overturn?
1324740640064888832 2020-11-06 23:49:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excuse you, first of all @realDonaldTrump is still president for three more months. Second, the race is not over.
1324740254784512000 2020-11-06 23:47:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because nobody is asking them to overturn the results. We're asking them to uphold the results, in which @realDonaldTrump won.
1324739219588325376 2020-11-06 23:43:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank Lawsuits over blatant fraud in Philly.
1324733349144023041 2020-11-06 23:20:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good. Sounds right. Also do a recount and WI and overturn the fraudulent 100k Biden votes in MI.
1324732428401954817 2020-11-06 23:16:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Says who?
1324731300373319680 2020-11-06 23:12:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze #ImpeachKamala let's get it going, folks.
1324730468898607104 2020-11-06 23:08:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They won't, because it didn't matter enough to people like you to vote for @realDonaldTrump to stop them.
1324729737109999616 2020-11-06 23:05:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sure. Take it to the courts. Will it do any good? IDK
1324729481563693062 2020-11-06 23:04:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec The revolt against communist China has been put down. We are all serfs now.
1324729148691173377 2020-11-06 23:03:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We haven't had a truly conservative, prosperous, happy era in America since the 80's and 90's. Another term of Trump would have gotten us there. Back to doom and gloom.
1324728546204540930 2020-11-06 23:01:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Arrrg! When can we get rid of this hag?
1324728122617536513 2020-11-06 22:59:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> As we have seen time and time again, it is the @nytimes that lies, not @realDonaldTrump.
1324714229342048256 2020-11-06 22:04:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AaronBlake @mindyfinn Shouldn't take that long. They are delaying because they can accept ballots 3 days after the election.
1324713174415847426 2020-11-06 22:00:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MattWalshBlog Because Trump's policies would *actually* help minorities rise, not just buy them off with welfare, and they are racist?
1324711589023518724 2020-11-06 21:53:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr @kimguilfoyle Thank you for saying "our Republic". We are not and never will be a socialist "democracy".
1324710954177802240 2020-11-06 21:51:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He did. Roll the tape.)
1324707409995202560 2020-11-06 21:37:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh shut it, government worshipper.
1324594824343887872 2020-11-06 14:09:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Great, now Haley will be working to destroy Pence and Don Jr.
1324594401587404806 2020-11-06 14:08:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara He said "state legislature".
1324594209928695812 2020-11-06 14:07:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> DO IT
1324593804217884672 2020-11-06 14:05:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank Ugh. We are in serious trouble as a nation.
1324592657709092865 2020-11-06 14:01:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr on deck!
1324592422207266821 2020-11-06 14:00:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why he's suing to stop the fraud!
1324556243969691651 2020-11-06 11:36:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze I guess that leaves @senatemajldr as the de facto leader of the country?
1324555294500921344 2020-11-06 11:32:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @kasie @HotlineJosh It will be better for everyone if the full truth of the matter is determined. We need to have a THOROUGH investigation of all ballot counting activities by Trump campaign observers and SCOTUS. Biden campaign observers welcome as well. What do they have to hide?
1324554987578470402 2020-11-06 11:31:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *AHEM* Just because Dems declare themselves the victors due to their fraudulent vote counts does not mean anything is over, at all.
1324554386924806144 2020-11-06 11:29:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I can live with that. After SCOTUS rules. And Dems should be prepared to accept a Trump victory after fraudulent ballots are disallowed.
1324551209152368640 2020-11-06 11:16:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SCOTUS
1324551079707791360 2020-11-06 11:16:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @sailingroxy @MZHemingway Sad. This is how we got Obama. And it's happening again. GOP must become the working class party or die.
1324550869266956288 2020-11-06 11:15:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> GOP legislatures in AZ, GA, and PA should all appoint pro Trump electors to counter the election fraud going on. They must represent the true will of the people.
1324550353296261120 2020-11-06 11:13:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> DO IT
1324549970205310976 2020-11-06 11:11:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... no. Nevada - LIKELY BIDEN Pennsylvania - TRUMP, but Dems stole it Georgia - TIED Arizona - TRUMP North Carolina - TRUMP
1324549244569735168 2020-11-06 11:08:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Note: Dems will declare the election over tonight before all the ballots have been counted (and checked by the courts for legality). Twitter will issue no warning. Biased hacks!
1324547716991647744 2020-11-06 11:02:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If the courts declare @JoeBiden president, @realDonaldTrump needs to fire every single deep state government employee in revenge before he leaves. At the very least the full leadership of each agency.
1324545697627197440 2020-11-06 10:54:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Just as soon as they add enough ballots in after the fact.
1324544401213894656 2020-11-06 10:49:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... ok. Buying himself off the hook?
1324535968179912705 2020-11-06 10:15:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DavidAFrench The @gop are idiots. If they had any spine at all to fight, they could have the presidency, the senate, and a reduced Dem majority in the House. Instead they'd rather stick it to working class voters and line their pockets with the globalist elites. Sell outs!
1324535529254363139 2020-11-06 10:14:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara It did. These are close races in blue states. If they hadn't allowed postmarked ballots to come in up to 3 days after the election, Trump would have won PA. Just for starters.
1324535162412109827 2020-11-06 10:12:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (They are founded, and they are not conspiracy theories.)
1324534373543219202 2020-11-06 10:09:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Glad they lost seats. The House is long overdue to switch parties. We'll get @SpeakerPelosi out of there in 2022.
1324533925302198273 2020-11-06 10:07:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YAAAAAAAASSSSS!
1324533654224326656 2020-11-06 10:06:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Typo? Who said that? I doubt it. Who makes a "typo" that gives 100k extra votes to someone?
1324532998147100676 2020-11-06 10:04:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES
1324531910010392576 2020-11-06 09:59:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara So you all are just going to accept the fraud occurring in blue states?
1324531772797915137 2020-11-06 09:59:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Um you do know he is still the President until January right? This is treason. Lock @KeithOlbermann up.
1324531426696564737 2020-11-06 09:57:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen Also it's really disgusting of them to say that when they are packing in extra fraudulent votes after the election.
1324518701023068162 2020-11-06 09:07:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democrats have been trying to invalidate the 2016 election results for 4 years... give me a break!
1324516642261471232 2020-11-06 08:59:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You don't know that at all.
1324515371307671552 2020-11-06 08:54:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FRAUD! See you in court.
1324514667713253376 2020-11-06 08:51:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It is NOT over. Fraud! We'll meet them in the courts.
1324514479909019649 2020-11-06 08:50:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Edwillin16 @TrumpWarRoom @JoeBiden No, that proves my point. Based on the Republican senators winning, @realDonaldTrump should have won also.
1324512869879320576 2020-11-06 08:44:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOTS of indications of that. Nov. 3rd was two days ago.
1324509469145993220 2020-11-06 08:30:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The claims are not baseless and any @GOP official who embraces Democrat lies will lose their seat ASAP.
1324503455172579329 2020-11-06 08:06:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damage??? You don't support the integrity of our election?
1324494827090857986 2020-11-06 07:32:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES
1324494682882220032 2020-11-06 07:31:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr He's in for another 6 years, so that's the last we'll probably hear from him.
1324494462974906369 2020-11-06 07:31:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PrestonTl2700 @TrumpWarRoom @JoeBiden So that's the cover story.
1324494289070600198 2020-11-06 07:30:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Srvdmc2163David @TrumpWarRoom @JoeBiden Uh huh. Nice try.
1324483106221543426 2020-11-06 06:45:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Don't trust any @FoxNews calls. @PRyan is the snake.🐍🐍🐍
1324482871558606855 2020-11-06 06:44:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That is, in fact, the current bargain.
1324482436907126784 2020-11-06 06:43:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If WI, MI, PA (Philly), or GA (Atlanta) are called for @JoeBiden, I WILL NOT accept it. Clear cut evidence of ballot fraud in those places.
1324481417624096768 2020-11-06 06:39:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Barnes_Law @DonaldJTrumpJr If you wanted to flip a state, and you needed a nice round number of ballots to add, what would it be? Exactly.
1324480901586309120 2020-11-06 06:37:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He won. Dang fraud.)
1324480694744211458 2020-11-06 06:36:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Does @JudicialWatch have standing to bring any lawsuits? Please do.
1324480564251009032 2020-11-06 06:35:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Will Twitter put up warnings that the election is still in dispute when @FoxNews (unfairly) calls it? Doubt it.
1324474933574012929 2020-11-06 06:13:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES!
1324474319980896256 2020-11-06 06:11:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES
1324473809307656196 2020-11-06 06:08:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JimPethokoukis Dems stealing PA is not a conspiracy theory. No votes should have been accepted after the election was over.
1324472837218983937 2020-11-06 06:05:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *sigh* Now here's what happens. 1) Dems steal PA 2) Trump refuses to concede 3) Dems claim he won't agree to peaceful transition of power like they said
1324472506665848832 2020-11-06 06:03:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When a Democrat says they are "counting" mail in ballots, they mean they are "gathering" them from voters after the election.
1324472101559033857 2020-11-06 06:02:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Kamala is the socialist. The issue is that she'll be president within a year.
1324471856754294786 2020-11-06 06:01:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because we are LAW AND ORDER people, unlike the rioters in Philly.
1324471764966117382 2020-11-06 06:00:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher You mean as Democrats continue to submit fraudulent votes with no postmark after the election date.
1324471297301164032 2020-11-06 05:58:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SCOTUS, ASAP!
1324471053796651008 2020-11-06 05:58:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Even if AZ and GA go Trump (I believe they will), they're still gonna steal PA, unless we can stop them in the courts. That's the key state right now.
1324469719781486596 2020-11-06 05:52:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LanaDarkNS @dbongino @parler_app I get on Twitter to dunk on journos. Can't do that on @parler_app, they're not there.
1324469569772228609 2020-11-06 05:52:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LeaheyEsther @TrumpWarRoom @JoeBiden Mm hmm I'm sure.
1324454852995518465 2020-11-06 04:53:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Probably due to all the election rallies and protests. We can probably say that now.
1324454569959706627 2020-11-06 04:52:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Brian_Riedl @benshapiro A silver lining to soften the blow if Trump loses. Very evenly divided government.
1324453769451573248 2020-11-06 04:49:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dbongino @parler_app has to diversify its user base if they want people to use it. It's a meaningless echo chamber right now.
1324453209541324806 2020-11-06 04:47:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @realDonaldTrump wins somehow, Twitter is DEFINITELY losing their section 230 protected status.
1324452217588514818 2020-11-06 04:43:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TrumpWarRoom @JoeBiden was caught on tape! Note that nobody ever denied it, they just *assumed* we would think it was a mistake. It was not, the only mistake was that he said it out loud.
1324451908921294848 2020-11-06 04:41:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> EXACTLY 🚨🚨🚨
1324451599700414466 2020-11-06 04:40:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Either @realDonaldTrump or a member of his family will be running for president in 2024, GUARANTEED. #AlwaysTrump

1324446024811843585 2020-11-06 04:18:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @kayleighmcenany Because they're adding Democrat votes. Duh.
1324445732800237568 2020-11-06 04:17:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen Democrats don't believe in an arbitrary election deadline. They think that they should be able to keep counting votes until Biden wins.
1324445040022818817 2020-11-06 04:14:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TrumpWarRoom If you give all the red states to Republicans and blue states to Dems, Biden wins with PA being the difference, due to the fraud in Philly.
1324443888040497153 2020-11-06 04:10:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Remember that @JoeBiden already told us he built the largest voter fraud organization in history. BELIEVE HIM
1324443631835586560 2020-11-06 04:09:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC Any election in which it takes more than a day or two to tally all the votes is definitely fraudulent. It doesn't take that long to count, people.
1324443405255135234 2020-11-06 04:08:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> As long as @SpeakerPelosi is speaker House Dems will continue to lose seats. Happens every time. She's our greatest asset.
1324442406788517891 2020-11-06 04:04:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen Biden, if he becomes president, will be illegitimate. And Kamala too.

1324420076053868545 2020-11-06 02:35:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> At issue, obviously, is whether these newfound Dem votes that are 100% for @JoeBiden are fraudulent or not.
1324416908821696513 2020-11-06 02:22:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We are going to FIGHT till the end. But whoever wins, it's not like the makeup of the country has changed. If they steal it, @realDonaldTrump supporters are not going anywhere. We will still be supporting his policies for years to come.

1324365756084162562 2020-11-05 22:59:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah we already knew that. PA and AZ
1324364513752326147 2020-11-05 22:54:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES!
1324299752616402946 2020-11-05 18:37:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hmm de hmm hmm. GA and AZ looking solid for @realDonaldTrump now. Means there's a chance if he wins PA or overturns the fraud in MI.

1324285485611687936 2020-11-05 17:40:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Even if we win GA and AZ, sadly it appears that PA was not outside the margin of fraud.
1324282568435503104 2020-11-05 17:29:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Tactic? @JoeBiden did the same thing. All candidates always do in tight races.
1324281785556094976 2020-11-05 17:25:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Will they?
1324281253533802497 2020-11-05 17:23:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why?
1324217095966654464 2020-11-05 13:08:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't understand why people voted to let globalists rape America again. Makes no sense.

1324212684183740418 2020-11-05 12:51:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Biden did not win Michigan, check their website. PA is full of voter fraud. I doubt Nevada is in play, and if so it doesn't matter.
1324211757909463045 2020-11-05 12:47:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Look folks, Dems are blatantly stealing the election. @realDonaldTrump must challenge it in the courts, take it to SCOTUS, and whatever happens, happens.
1324211560236093450 2020-11-05 12:46:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @kathyannbryant @GOP They forgot to add the extra 100k all Biden vote dump to the website LOL.

1324210101780172804 2020-11-05 12:41:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I guess we can say that *sigh* moderation somehow still managed to win in the most polarized election ever.
1324209812943572992 2020-11-05 12:39:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Interesting that the @gop held on to the Senate, increased seats in the House, but lost ground in the electoral vote for president. What does it all mean?
1324207720556363776 2020-11-05 12:31:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump needs AZ, PA, and GA to win the election. He'd have to run the table with the slimmest of margins.
1324207424539103233 2020-11-05 12:30:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So guys. Yes, Dems stole the election with fraud, as we predicted. We'll fight as far as we can, but are unlikely to get very far in states with Democrat controlled state governments. It's time to start talking @realDonaldTrump #Resistance. We can't let the establishment back in.
1324206489763012608 2020-11-05 12:26:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Guys, Arizona only matters if Trump can hold PA and GA. Unlikely. Maaaybe he can get Michigan back at SCOTUS, but that's dicey.
1324206090154901504 2020-11-05 12:25:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr @SaraCarterDC Hey didn't @SecPompeo say he was going to release @HillaryClinton's emails? Why didn't he do it?
1324205676697145345 2020-11-05 12:23:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @catturd2 @LibertyAndTech Michigan definitely should have gone to @realDonaldTrump. The extra 100k all Biden votes in the middle of the night was an obvious fraud.
1324205431028330496 2020-11-05 12:22:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOPLeader @KellyannePolls Smallest bit of good news. People are rejecting crazy @SpeakerPelosi and the left.
1324204169889255426 2020-11-05 12:17:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr DOJ? Barr made a deal with the @JoeBiden campaign long ago. Talk to @RudyGiuliani. Your own campaign will have to spring for the lawsuits.
1324203770411188224 2020-11-05 12:15:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Big Tech, Big Hollywood, Big Education. They must all be destroyed.
1324203231694774274 2020-11-05 12:13:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How the hell does it take three days for swing states to count votes? Give us the numbers already. It's time to move forward.
1324185666394218497 2020-11-05 11:03:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Arizona to Trump, Georgia to Biden leaves Nevada as key state. If it goes to Trump we're in a 269-269 tie.
1324183067590873089 2020-11-05 10:53:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ARmastrangelo They've already got Georgia as a backup plan. No matter how many we win, they find places to steal states to compensate.
1324182826930024448 2020-11-05 10:52:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Intimidate them? Why would they have anything to fear if they are counting the votes correctly?
1324180364064149504 2020-11-05 10:42:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FRAUD!
1324179795731689473 2020-11-05 10:40:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If Biden wins Georgia and Trump wins AZ/NV, we're at a 269-269 tie. Which I think both sides might accept at this point.

1324174131080925190 2020-11-05 10:18:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump will always be president in our hearts though, and that's something that all your money and scheming can never buy.
1324158641633693696 2020-11-05 09:16:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> At this point I don't really care what happens. @realDonaldTrump will always be the legitimate president in my mind.
1324136370881835008 2020-11-05 07:48:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It doesn't matter what the establishment does, @realDonaldTrump will always be the people's hero. And we will win in the end.
1324135271563145224 2020-11-05 07:43:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm afraid @JoeBiden was right - he organized a massive voter fraud campaign and there's not much we can do to stop it.
1324131677581488129 2020-11-05 07:29:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC @realDonaldTrump Yeah but they're stealing PA at this very moment. Take it to SCOTUS.

1324126635336048640 2020-11-05 07:09:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden was not legitimately elected. Trump won, and had the election stolen from him.
1324125991241945089 2020-11-05 07:06:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden did not win the election. His presidency, if it happens will be illegitimate. #NeverBiden you heard it here first.
1324125356857663488 2020-11-05 07:04:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @JoeBiden wins the election fraudulently, his presidency will NEVER be legitimate. It will have no power and @senatemajldr should feel free to simply ignore him. Do not remove him because then we get @KamalaHarris, in that case we'd have to impeach her.
1324124819588263936 2020-11-05 07:02:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Where the hell are NV and AZ? SHOW US THE VOTES

1324123749176778754 2020-11-05 06:57:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ya think?
1324122415438454784 2020-11-05 06:52:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democrats can try to steal the election all they want, but we already put the trump card in place for just this situation. ACB will sort it out.
1324121661617176578 2020-11-05 06:49:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump won, Biden is cheating to steal the election. God is in control, it will be ok. In fact, four years of rallies for Trump 2024 against an ailing Biden might be sweet revenge.

1324022220553900039 2020-11-05 00:14:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pan-ethnic working class conservatism is where we're going. We should have gone there 12 years ago but Obama didn't do crap to really help minorities.
1324020625632055297 2020-11-05 00:08:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We have no problem with it taking longer... as long as it proceeds and is not paused to insert fraudulent ballots.
1324020300992962560 2020-11-05 00:06:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Obviously.
1324020168310358016 2020-11-05 00:06:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PWashTX22 @proteinwisdom @JackPosobiec I don't see how we get AZ.
1324018544598753288 2020-11-04 23:59:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You're down 4% with 98% reporting. Where are you going to get the votes?
1324018405108830209 2020-11-04 23:59:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We really need to know what's holding up vote counting in NV, and why the Trump campaign expects to win it.
1324017777422774274 2020-11-04 23:56:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL what are they protesting? No one knows the results yet.
1324017198260752386 2020-11-04 23:54:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @esaagar Damn establishment.
1324017036872339456 2020-11-04 23:53:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Indeed. Let's get those Nevada votes in, folks. If @realDonaldTrump can swing Nevada it's over.
1324016762371874816 2020-11-04 23:52:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Aaaaand that's the end of the Internet, folks.
1324016547443187718 2020-11-04 23:51:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Arizona is 98% in and Biden is up by 4%. I don't see how Trump swings it. The rest is correct; everything hinges on WI/MI/NV.
1324016261840445441 2020-11-04 23:50:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec There's not enough left to swing PA. The election comes down to Nevada, or stopping the fraud in WI and MI.
1324015882197237760 2020-11-04 23:49:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Could win it for him in Nevada.
1324015606228725762 2020-11-04 23:48:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? You are not allowed to censor facts just because you don't like them.
1324015187914072065 2020-11-04 23:46:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @theloftusparty @ScotsFyre I wonder what leverage they had on the county election clerk they got to take the fall for this.
1324015001850564610 2020-11-04 23:45:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight in the air, we shall defend our country, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.
1324011997432786945 2020-11-04 23:33:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So this election depends on PA being outside the margin of fraud and the lead switching in NV. Not great, Bob.
1324010404037730306 2020-11-04 23:27:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Two whole years? Ugh!
1324009506096009218 2020-11-04 23:23:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Especially restarting it with a huge jump in unexplained Biden votes (none for Trump) that hands him the election. Fishy as hell.
1324008408589152256 2020-11-04 23:19:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SaraCarterDC @madisongesiotto Naked election stealing. Shameful!
1324007350789951490 2020-11-04 23:15:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FRAUD
1324007055041220609 2020-11-04 23:14:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @davecatanese There have been LOTs of irregularities. Just because you guys are hiding the corruption behind closed doors doesn't mean it doesn't exist. We WILL find you out.
1324006385672216577 2020-11-04 23:11:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We will not stand for election fraud. We will fight to the fullest extent in the courts to protect our right to free and fair elections.
1324001663821225993 2020-11-04 22:52:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damn frauds. We know exactly how democracy works. Corruption and cheating by people like you. We are a Constitutional Republic.
1324001253320499201 2020-11-04 22:51:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Of course Dems would only unleash that if Trump won.
1324001137490644994 2020-11-04 22:50:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I was told that you are not allowed to claim this while they are still counting ballots.
1324001020117159936 2020-11-04 22:50:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump can still win without WI and MI if he flips Nevada.
1323990637176377346 2020-11-04 22:09:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The @realDonaldTrump campaign must fight this every inch of the way in the courts to stop Dem election fraud.
1323989203403898880 2020-11-04 22:03:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is a lie.
1323988748531650566 2020-11-04 22:01:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @duckdiver19 @LibertyAndTech Sue the hell out of the fraudulent election electioneering in these states.
1323988137555755010 2020-11-04 21:59:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EmeraldRobinson That's the worst part about it. You know these extra ballots are fake, given their history of faking everything else.
1323987195796082690 2020-11-04 21:55:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's a good thing the @realDonaldTrump campaign knows their way around a courthouse.
1323986693872037889 2020-11-04 21:53:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sad. Our country is hopelessly corrupt. We were so close to saving it. Death comes for us all.
1323985819200270336 2020-11-04 21:49:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I can't believe this election is going to be stolen.
1323983818269798407 2020-11-04 21:41:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Guess they were able to cheat overnight, as expected.
1323982610469715968 2020-11-04 21:37:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @HotlineJosh They *still* can't admit that their absurd leftist policies lost them the working class since 2016.
1323911509597167616 2020-11-04 16:54:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES! Taking care of business here in Oklahoma.
1323906636143013890 2020-11-04 16:35:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LIES he did not say that. He said he would stop voting.
1323905381198909440 2020-11-04 16:30:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Election FRAUD! Take it to SCOTUS!
1323905201951199232 2020-11-04 16:29:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES
1323904798236835840 2020-11-04 16:27:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excuse you. Biden said he won, is that not irresponsible? And is this not what every candidate does every election if there is any plausible path to victory? Stop being an establishment hack.
1323877157664219137 2020-11-04 14:38:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's true. What @realDonaldTrump has been saying the whole time.
1323876679706619904 2020-11-04 14:36:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Gonna be pretty hard for them to manufacture 700,000 votes overnight in PA.
1323875366600118274 2020-11-04 14:30:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Race is over. The rest is BS.
1323874717036646402 2020-11-04 14:28:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1323874250726531072 2020-11-04 14:26:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Every election, like clockwork. They always think they can flip it and they never do.
1323873855971229696 2020-11-04 14:24:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh yeah, remember @realDonaldTrump also gets +3 when Alaska comes in.
1323872990744989696 2020-11-04 14:21:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT Rough night, eh @maggieNYT?
1323872093142999043 2020-11-04 14:17:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You don't know much about anything. And you lost.
1323872019256086528 2020-11-04 14:17:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's winning all of them, although they're trying to cheat in PA.
1323871292970455041 2020-11-04 14:14:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nevada starting to roll in.
1323870284068302851 2020-11-04 14:10:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (It's not particularly close.)
1323870092753600512 2020-11-04 14:10:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @loganclarkhall @ComfortablySmug After @JoeBiden just declared victory. Ridiculous!
1323869727333228545 2020-11-04 14:08:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Once WI is called, it's over. We don't need PA.
1323869232719908864 2020-11-04 14:06:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @realDonaldTrump wins WI and MI, it's over. We don't need NV, AZ, or cheating PA.
1323867178723090432 2020-11-04 13:58:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Call it. @realDonaldTrump has won WI.
1323866498981646337 2020-11-04 13:55:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Who took @scrowder down and why?
1323865528868442113 2020-11-04 13:51:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump or twitter deleted it. Staffer?
1323864970677886977 2020-11-04 13:49:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whoa. Did Twitter just delete a @realDonaldTrump tweet?
1323863799842148353 2020-11-04 13:45:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Poor guy has lost it.
1323863641477812224 2020-11-04 13:44:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden conceding?
1323863369930149891 2020-11-04 13:43:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nice! .@RealKiraDavis
1323862757662404610 2020-11-04 13:40:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell?
1323862418850779143 2020-11-04 13:39:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dems won Dem states only. @realDonaldTrump won GOP and swing states. I mean, who else would actually vote for @JoeBiden?
1323861125822337024 2020-11-04 13:34:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This race was over a long time ago.
1323860669452685313 2020-11-04 13:32:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher Oh really? That's what @scrowder said.
1323860466154786817 2020-11-04 13:31:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @esaagar Also a big factor was simply that @realDonaldTrump closed hard while @JoeBiden was wandering around in a field somewhere when @BarackObama called him to the stage.
1323860156371947521 2020-11-04 13:30:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Arizona BACK IN PLAY! @FoxNews backs down.
1323859022274023426 2020-11-04 13:26:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1323858499479154688 2020-11-04 13:23:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Got to do the fraud overnight.
1323858390888685568 2020-11-04 13:23:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent. @realDonaldTrump should get to appoint at least 1-2 more SCOTUS justices.
1323858281098629121 2020-11-04 13:23:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The coalition held, for all the infighting. @realDonaldTrump won the working class voters and @senatemajldr kept the Senate with traditional Republicans.
1323857880806772736 2020-11-04 13:21:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So nothing changed - presidency, Senate, or House. People leaving things the way they are.
1323857107783995393 2020-11-04 13:18:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The only reason the race hasn't been called yet is the time needed for Dem media to grieve and admit defeat.
1323856148643090432 2020-11-04 13:14:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes. Good dog.
1323855691266838528 2020-11-04 13:12:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ouch! First real loss of the night.
1323854451527110656 2020-11-04 13:07:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL why is Twitter having a hissy fit about these calls for Texas?
1323854247688130561 2020-11-04 13:07:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You know it. Representin'
1323854147595210758 2020-11-04 13:06:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScottFConroy Never believe the MSM pollsters again. Only @trafalgar_group and @Rasmussen_Poll.
1323853574036721667 2020-11-04 13:04:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL Twitter added a warning to this.
1323852913224146949 2020-11-04 13:01:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Turns out you do actually have to win an election by going out and getting the votes. @JoeBiden is the Democrat version of McCain. @BernieSanders would have put up a better fight. That would have been a crazy race!
1323850103233433600 2020-11-04 12:50:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> PA is outside the margin of fraud. Congrats guys, we did it!
1323849283754430464 2020-11-04 12:47:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @FoxNews must fire @PRyan. TERRIBLE in every way, clearly holds a grudge against @realDonaldTrump and supports @JoeBiden.
1323849059250089985 2020-11-04 12:46:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is sweeping MI, WI, and PA. It's over, even if they won't admit it.
1323847465913778179 2020-11-04 12:40:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damn straight. And WE ARE GOING to root out the Epstein pedophile network in power.
1323847181250502656 2020-11-04 12:38:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ALEX JONES IS COMING UP ON @scrowder. Internet about to melt down.
1323847057531117568 2020-11-04 12:38:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh Pottawattamie County (IA), what is wrong with you? Still holding grudges?
1323846146687643651 2020-11-04 12:34:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL yup.
1323845762611073025 2020-11-04 12:33:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL  https://t.co/VATwge5a7y
1323844913151254530 2020-11-04 12:29:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I was right. I was always right. Deal with it, everybody.
1323844735581257729 2020-11-04 12:29:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL what were Dems thinking? @JoeBiden, a candidate? The guy has dementia and can't even speak!
1323844445570273281 2020-11-04 12:28:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This night was everything we hoped for and more. The schadenfreude is delicious.
1323843611319033856 2020-11-04 12:24:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher hardest hit tonight LOL. So predictable. He was always grasping at straws.
1323842438084104193 2020-11-04 12:20:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden ain't winning anywhere in Michigan but Ann Arbor and Detroit. RED WALL!!!
1323839201956237312 2020-11-04 12:07:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Here it is. @DonaldJTrumpJr on the phone!
1323837820268695552 2020-11-04 12:01:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HERE WE GO!
1323837648004407303 2020-11-04 12:01:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL not happening AT ALL.
1323837280096800769 2020-11-04 11:59:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When is the victory speech and who's livestreaming it?
1323836921630642176 2020-11-04 11:58:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The Rust Belt came home for @realDonaldTrump after all. He blew them out of the water.
1323836348332167178 2020-11-04 11:55:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaaaang @realDonaldTrump is now BLOWING BIDEN AWAY in PA. LANDSLIDE!!!
1323835344983347202 2020-11-04 11:51:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> PA is irrelevant. @JoeBiden lost.
1323832680744701957 2020-11-04 11:41:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump simply blew @JoeBiden out of the water in Michigan. As I predicted.
1323832371330822144 2020-11-04 11:40:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1323831618948182016 2020-11-04 11:37:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's over.
1323831327272165376 2020-11-04 11:35:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Egg. On. Their. Freaking. Face. @cnn should go out of business.
1323830828007346176 2020-11-04 11:33:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @JoeBiden was the one trying to put together the minority white rule. @realDonaldTrump's campaign was multiracial working class.
1323830569285935105 2020-11-04 11:32:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dude is a genius. Only one to do, you know, actual polling. Congratulations to his booming business!
1323830108122193922 2020-11-04 11:31:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is the moment. It was all worth it. Tears.
1323829625328488449 2020-11-04 11:29:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Every. Gosh. Damn. Thing. @realDonaldTrump Said. Was. True. Never trust the lying fakers ever again.
1323829245592952833 2020-11-04 11:27:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is up in WI, PA, and MI with 30% of the vote in. Arizona is irrelevant. He WINS! All the lying mainstream media can suck it.
1323828944546783233 2020-11-04 11:26:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BREAKING: I'm calling it. @realDonaldTrump WINS!!!
1323825989416353794 2020-11-04 11:14:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We're one state away, and Michigan is looking good so far. Just as I foresaw.
1323825091562622977 2020-11-04 11:11:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Squeaker, but it'll do.
1323824703228813314 2020-11-04 11:09:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump You did, you did. Safe there.

1323824171063848960 2020-11-04 11:07:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> OK so Ohio is now solid for @realDonaldTrump. Still waiting on NC.
1323822026176581639 2020-11-04 10:59:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Closer... closer...
1323821761767624706 2020-11-04 10:57:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yay for more judges.
1323821132294901761 2020-11-04 10:55:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Polling is dead. Except @Rasmussen_Poll and @trafalgar_group. Trust no others.
1323820897640263682 2020-11-04 10:54:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why hasn't @realDonaldTrump tweeted yet?
1323819155141894144 2020-11-04 10:47:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump We're *this* close. This is not a good night for Biden.

1323818759820398593 2020-11-04 10:46:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How the hell is @realDonaldTrump winning Virginia?
1323817923610370048 2020-11-04 10:42:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 10% of Wisconsin in and it's neck and neck.
1323817699496124416 2020-11-04 10:41:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden just lost Ohio. I'm on the brink of making the call.
1323817569564925958 2020-11-04 10:41:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (I don't think she is a racist. What did she say?)
1323817391499915265 2020-11-04 10:40:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHAHA YAAAAAAAASSSSSS! A win for QAnon! Get them pedophiles in government!
1323817240966422532 2020-11-04 10:40:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Gonna be a loooooong night for journos. Win or lose, EVERYTHING @realDonaldTrump said about them was correct.
1323816784055750663 2020-11-04 10:38:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I was curious why it wasn't flipped earlier. Thought about trying to make some money that way. But of course everything was very uncertain.
1323816127106076672 2020-11-04 10:35:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Suddenly @realDonaldTrump is only 1.5% behind in Ohio.
1323814627772420105 2020-11-04 10:29:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who?
1323813707466612737 2020-11-04 10:25:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Grrr when can we get rid of @SpeakerPelosi?
1323812643182923786 2020-11-04 10:21:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ohio tightening (finally). Where's the @nytimes needle?
1323812183734714369 2020-11-04 10:19:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not sufficiently Trumpy I guess. Try Buck again? But the state is probably lost.
1323806987394666498 2020-11-04 09:59:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ohio appears to be @realDonaldTrump's Achilles Heel though.
1323806774357610497 2020-11-04 09:58:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Michigan looking really good for Trump. Every county except the one with Ann Arbor has @realDonaldTrump up big. Detroit and Grand Rapids included. Told ya!
1323805748711882753 2020-11-04 09:54:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Drums in the distance.
1323805347702857729 2020-11-04 09:52:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's been his strategy from day 1.
1323804841538428937 2020-11-04 09:50:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @trafalgar_group having a GREAT night tonight.
1323804673380405249 2020-11-04 09:50:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> My favorite part of the night. Sweet, sweet vindication!
1323802110488621056 2020-11-04 09:39:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra NC is locked. We're worried about Ohio now.
1323801969027387394 2020-11-04 09:39:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Some of the biggest swing states coming in now. PA and MI.
1323801447084007425 2020-11-04 09:37:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHAHA YES
1323800797214351363 2020-11-04 09:34:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Give us the needle for Ohio. Dems up pretty big with 44% counted. Not great, Bob.
1323799201701076992 2020-11-04 09:28:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Georgia coming home for @realDonaldTrump. Things are looking mildly positive right now.
1323798741925711873 2020-11-04 09:26:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> NC needle trending back toward toward @realDonaldTrump. Good sign.
1323796330242809857 2020-11-04 09:16:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Georgia back solid for @realDonaldTrump. Concerning numbers in NC and OH, but not much is in yet.
1323794790295756800 2020-11-04 09:10:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hate to throw water on everyone's parade but if Ohio and NC are bad for @realDonaldTrump he probably loses.
1323794008104198144 2020-11-04 09:07:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> North Carolina and Ohio...
1323793676116627462 2020-11-04 09:06:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shocker, Oklahoma goes for @realDonaldTrump with no votes counted.
1323791065388851203 2020-11-04 08:55:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. We got the young single white women back!
1323790916784660482 2020-11-04 08:55:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not good... it's dropping.
1323790031308443651 2020-11-04 08:51:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Cubanos votaron por Donald Trump.
1323789211963695105 2020-11-04 08:48:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shocker.
1323788948070649859 2020-11-04 08:47:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ok. We're at baseline. Now to see what happens in North Carolina.
1323788679840747522 2020-11-04 08:46:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Please guys... every vote counts!
1323787565862998019 2020-11-04 08:42:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @nytimes has @JoeBiden up by 2 in Florida with 72% in but a 95% chance of a @realDonaldTrump win. Closer than I'd like.
1323783938041589760 2020-11-04 08:27:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @realDonaldTrump loses North Carolina this is not going to be a very fun night.
1323781102931202048 2020-11-04 08:16:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Aaaaaand the first state to go to @realDonaldTrump is... KENTUCKY!
1323778690426294274 2020-11-04 08:06:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Man I'd rather be in Afghanistan being shot at by the Taliban than... sitting on TV counting votes.
1323766195795959808 2020-11-04 07:17:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Obviously. I would have gone but they charged to get in.
1323765551139835904 2020-11-04 07:14:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. We definitely left it all on the field, and that's all we can do.
1323765194795945985 2020-11-04 07:13:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> SWEEEEEEET
1323765036398137350 2020-11-04 07:12:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> VOTE VOTE VOTE people get in more VOTES as fast as you can!
1323764741962125314 2020-11-04 07:11:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> OK I'm off work let's get the party started!

1323729786246729729 2020-11-04 04:52:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I know what winning feels like. I know what losing feels like. She's losing.

1323728600034586627 2020-11-04 04:47:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Naw man. Michigan.
1323719046831972352 2020-11-04 04:09:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LibertyAndTech LOL I don't give a crap about PA. That was just a head fake to throw Biden off. MI is where it will be won.
1323712145968816129 2020-11-04 03:42:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why... are they soaring? Uncertainty is usually bad for markets.
1323710031410438149 2020-11-04 03:33:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Feisty_FL @JDRucker I get that you need anxiety medication dude, but voting has nothing to do with anything. It's a pandemic. You're gonna lose people. Trump saved lives and Biden would be a disaster. Everyone dies in the end.
1323709317426589699 2020-11-04 03:31:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NolteNC @LegInsurrection I was in pain all day, found out my driver's license expired three days ago, went to the county courthouse and got a voter registration card, and voted. Turns out my prediction of crawling over broken glass to vote for @realDonaldTrump was closer to the truth than expected.
1323705759729942528 2020-11-04 03:17:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Without PA??? Someone's getting worried.
1323704351404208128 2020-11-04 03:11:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Heavy voting today. That's got to be good for @realDonaldTrump. Right?
1323662303250755585 2020-11-04 00:24:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL bet she wrote in herself.
1323659401383862273 2020-11-04 00:12:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Long lines to vote *in Oklahoma*, a state that's guaranteed for @realDonaldTrump. I've never seen this before.
1323659077134786563 2020-11-04 00:11:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bitter old hag
1323658052541779968 2020-11-04 00:07:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHA there it is. Always at the end. Psych!
1323657771557027842 2020-11-04 00:06:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Voting now. DO IT, PEOPLE
1323632588163088386 2020-11-03 22:26:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So besides his granddaughters and secret service there is a grand total of... 1 person. 😂😂😂
1323631872736452609 2020-11-03 22:23:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The important thing is that @realDonaldTrump WINS.
1323625019029729281 2020-11-03 21:56:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... duh. This is always how it's worked. If you are the winner, you declare victory.
1323620054920028162 2020-11-03 21:36:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We live a Constitutional Republic, not a Democracy.
1323619031950176256 2020-11-03 21:32:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Projection.
1323538777177051136 2020-11-03 16:13:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @VitalikButerin Because polls are fake.

1323529428606033921 2020-11-03 15:36:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker Hopefully he agrees to a peaceful transfer of power - from Trump to Trump.
1323514254197182464 2020-11-03 14:36:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC I'd be reeeeeeally curious which states your internal polling says you're gonna win.
1323513819717619713 2020-11-03 14:34:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Very true. They all have their unique strengths. I guess that makes Don Jr the establishment heir.
1323513649097510913 2020-11-03 14:33:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The die is cast. And now we wait.
1323511445435359232 2020-11-03 14:24:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's a wrap, folks! Que YMCA. We will never see another Trump rally again.

1323492264786698240 2020-11-03 13:08:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 👀
1323491767136722945 2020-11-03 13:06:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump I mean his former wife claimed he raped her.
1323487439017660417 2020-11-03 12:49:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker @realDonaldTrump team never pushed it because it would have backfired on them (Stormy Daniels).
1323487148251750400 2020-11-03 12:48:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They don't have any right to taxpayer money from red states.
1323483593373528064 2020-11-03 12:34:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Death comes for us all.
1323483347037921280 2020-11-03 12:33:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because they don't have capitalism.
1323482096619368449 2020-11-03 12:28:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's called a food bank.
1323480646342348800 2020-11-03 12:22:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I reject socialism. It has failed every time it has been tried.
1323480306192703488 2020-11-03 12:21:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Capitalism creates wealth. Socialism destroys it.

1323474198384332800 2020-11-03 11:56:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> While we're at it, it is VERY unfair that Delaware and Rhode Island have so much influence. Let's reapportion senate votes based on land mass.
1323472047272611840 2020-11-03 11:48:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He would tax the hell out of your son and condemn him to homelessness and poverty.
1323470742596521985 2020-11-03 11:43:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There it is. @VP says Michigan will win it for them. SNEAK ATTACK!
1323468917214425089 2020-11-03 11:35:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 50-50 whether you lose all your money.

1323466265026023425 2020-11-03 11:25:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScottAdamsSays It's the code. We know.
1323466049229119488 2020-11-03 11:24:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Luky_BB @baseballcrank The thing about places like @PredictIt is that it's all or nothing. You either clean up or lose everything. Not like an investment that you can hedge. Unless you sell before the election. Still... limited time horizon.
1323465613285752833 2020-11-03 11:22:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> With a 17% chance that you lose all your money.
1323465220237463558 2020-11-03 11:21:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> One more rally to wind it all up in Grand Rapids, MI. HERE WE GO!
1323464665800822784 2020-11-03 11:18:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Told ya.
1323464587858087936 2020-11-03 11:18:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHA psych! @realDonaldTrump tricked him, the real battleground is MI. Where he is closing the deal RIGHT NOW.
1323464077243523073 2020-11-03 11:16:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS
1323464019144003585 2020-11-03 11:16:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @mtracey @LibertyAndTech Umm.... won't they just light them on fire?
1323463266325176322 2020-11-03 11:13:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fraudulent votes must NOT be counted.
1323462612831580161 2020-11-03 11:10:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1323461652344459264 2020-11-03 11:07:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pathetic. The elites look down their nose at him (and us). In actual fact, he is very effective at getting results for his base.
1323461335871557633 2020-11-03 11:05:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It ain't PA you have to worry about, it's Michigan. And possibly Minnesota.
1323458635096313863 2020-11-03 10:55:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @scrowder Nice. Love it! Those are some fantastic guests. Probably the most watched event of the night.
1323457757983420418 2020-11-03 10:51:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jannyfayray This is an interesting trend I've been seeing. Trump may have problems with suburban housewives (establishment?) but the young single females that were so gaga for @BarackObama are voting @realDonaldTrump! Charisma, I guess. Leadership.
1323457047401291777 2020-11-03 10:48:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug I prefer the @ComfortablySmug brand of conservative politics to @baseballcrank's spineless moralizing.
1323456691174809600 2020-11-03 10:47:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dang. Was the pointy headed conservative establishment ever more useless? I see no point for them to remain in any positions of influence or power.
1323443317582036993 2020-11-03 09:54:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL as we wait for @realDonaldTrump... trying to think what I would do as a campaign strategist if the plane crashed. I think I'd say new data has come in and the president is preparing a big rally tomorrow night in PA with a huge surprise.
1323410967091437568 2020-11-03 07:45:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Time for the #RedWave, people! You know what to do. MAKE IT HAPPEN

1323408835181268992 2020-11-03 07:37:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL funny how the fakers put in ONE real poll right before the election so they can claim they were never biased.
1323407630249984001 2020-11-03 07:32:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @emilymiller I mean, conservatives definitely aren't going to stop them from destroying DC.
1323407245120589831 2020-11-03 07:30:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shouldn't be. Count the votes. Tell us who won. NO FRAUD!!!
1323390083370766336 2020-11-03 06:22:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whoop there it is.
1323388978800824323 2020-11-03 06:18:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaaaamn we can swing it!
1323387625600884737 2020-11-03 06:12:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Easily doable. Trump voters vote in person, on Election Day.
1323387512941850625 2020-11-03 06:12:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker @270toWin Nah Latinos will come out for Trump.
1323386482057465857 2020-11-03 06:08:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @scrowder Sounds like @JoeBiden not willing to transfer power peacefully. 🤔
1323386065282043905 2020-11-03 06:06:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TrumpWarRoom Is she running for VP or Brittney Spears dancer?
1323381345394020353 2020-11-03 05:47:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Every time he speaks we get "badakathcare", "trunalinnashufodepressure", and that's if he even shows up when his name is called. So... better of two evils.
1323322597069758464 2020-11-03 01:54:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ELECTION FRAUD!!!
1323316676469923840 2020-11-03 01:30:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. The election will be over on Nov. 4th. If you want to participate, return your ballot before that date.
1323316367886606336 2020-11-03 01:29:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You're not allowed to change lanes into another vehicle. That's not how driving works.
1323315011318669312 2020-11-03 01:24:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Inequity is GREAT! It helps EVERYONE do better.
1323265845041266688 2020-11-02 22:08:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScotsFyre Somehow I don't think @JoeBiden will be able to work the equivalent of 160 million jobs all by himself.
1323265208811487233 2020-11-02 22:06:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sorry you can't vote after the election is over.

1323261005015732224 2020-11-02 21:49:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What states do y'all think the Latino sneak attack is going to flip for @realDonaldTrump?
1323260453997498368 2020-11-02 21:47:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Donor money? I thought they were strapped for cash.
1323259430885097474 2020-11-02 21:43:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 👀 They won't know what hit them.
1323259131248189440 2020-11-02 21:42:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is not the one dividing people. He has united people of all races under a ONE AMERICA platform. Globalist elites want to divide the nation for profit.
1323257691603668993 2020-11-02 21:36:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScotsFyre The more inequity, the better for everyone. Someone has to work those 80 hour weeks building a huge company.
1323257087053438979 2020-11-02 21:34:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FACT CHECK: You are not allowed to vote after the election is over. This is fraud.

1323114926605520904 2020-11-02 12:09:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jhaskinscabrera @MelissaTweets "Equity" is actually unfair. It is not an equal exchange of money for value. It steals from those who work harder. Capitalism is perfectly equitable.
1323114333589671936 2020-11-02 12:06:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's his MO. Same way he won last time.

1323109922540789762 2020-11-02 11:49:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KMCRadio @VeritasSola @realDonaldTrump ...I told you people it was MI, not PA, that would win it for @realDonaldTrump. NAILED IT
1323108624575713286 2020-11-02 11:44:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker This is seriously disturbing. Her plan is to tax "the rich" (i.e. the middle class) and use it to fund government programs (which won't help anyway). Businesses will shut down, and there will be nothing to distribute. People will be poor and suffering - depression.
1323084980587765761 2020-11-02 10:10:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen The only way of guaranteeing equity in life is for everyone to be dead.
1323078940479660034 2020-11-02 09:46:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AnnCoulter I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. Vote @JoeBiden if you somehow think he'd be better.

1323072303777910784 2020-11-02 09:19:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SaraGonzalesTX @LibertyAndTech @KamalaHarris wants to kill people. That is the only plausible interpretation of this.
1323060598939308032 2020-11-02 08:33:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This poll is from the end of September LOL. Such fakers!
1323059904421265409 2020-11-02 08:30:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes. @realDonaldTrump is winning undecideds! Bodes well for swing states.

1323059214298873856 2020-11-02 08:27:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews I think it's hilarious that @ladygaga actually thought this would appeal to rednecks. Pretty easy to spot a BS artist.

1323042010530521093 2020-11-02 07:19:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What if Christians lived by "he who does not work, shall not eat"? Look it up.
1323038565870219264 2020-11-02 07:05:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is not how anything works, at all. Some people contribute more than others and deserve to be rewarded more. Everyone faces problems in life. You can't just "make everyone equal" without destroying any incentive to create &amp; produce. Then nobody has anything and we all starve.

1322662938923192325 2020-11-01 06:13:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @shipwreckedcrew @LibertyAndTech Turns out you *can't* actually change lanes into another vehicle.
1322660892501311488 2020-11-01 06:05:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll @retinaldoctor Unstoppable object of @realDonaldTrump meets immovable object of MSM pollsters. What happens next is anyone's guess.
1322659854532661248 2020-11-01 06:00:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TrumpWarRoom He is correct! They think it is a right for all people to have bad healthcare.
1322659636600852484 2020-11-01 06:00:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @nedryun @JDRucker Did not vote for him in 2016. If I am gasping for air on a ventilator in the hopsital with COVID, I will rip it out and crawl out of the hospital, across the street to the church, and vote for @realDonaldTrump with my last ounce of strength before I die.
1322659236686532608 2020-11-01 05:58:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @scrowder Who are you gonna believe, the MSM pollsters or your lying eyes?

1322656494744199168 2020-11-01 05:47:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Where's Hunter @JoeBiden? Are you freaking kidding me? It's not "not a scandal" just because you say it isn't.
1322637486607290369 2020-11-01 04:32:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I support free speech and candy corn is the Devil's scat.
1322636437615972352 2020-11-01 04:27:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @pollreport All these polls are from a week ago.
1322636221575794690 2020-11-01 04:27:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @exjon Why isn't it causing inflation?
1322635841861287937 2020-11-01 04:25:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody cares about the debt. Federal spending is just a tool to advance certain interests. I'd much rather that be going directly to the people if we're going to spend it anyway.
1322635448636899334 2020-11-01 04:23:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He better.

1322628443520094208 2020-11-01 03:56:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'll decide that, thanks. Please report the news.

1322580779235508224 2020-11-01 00:46:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Voting isn't some great noble civic responsibility. The choice of whether or not to vote is every bit as important as the choice of who to vote for. Government should be mostly irrelevant to our daily lives.
1322576710416683008 2020-11-01 00:30:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Taxes, regulations, bureaucracy, lobbyists, corruption. No thanks!

1322509297637576705 2020-10-31 20:02:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So @realDonaldTrump is at the exact same level of support when he won last time.
1322507531940409344 2020-10-31 19:55:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Huh? @realDonaldTrump = FREEDOM

1322401644261289985 2020-10-31 12:54:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec ...now they can say "hey look we reported on it before the election, we're not biased" too late for it to matter.
1322401444432150529 2020-10-31 12:54:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ooooh I see. They all put it in a Friday evening news dump and hope no one is paying attention over the weekend.
1322401093796638722 2020-10-31 12:52:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec @ABC being the most moderate of the left leaning MSM. Will @CBSNews be next? Doubt @MSNBC or @CNN ever cover it.

1322368162822803457 2020-10-31 10:41:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LisaMarieBoothe @DonaldJTrumpJr Well, yeah, I mean it's men. Not so sure about women.
1322355693026971649 2020-10-31 09:52:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Told ya. It's MI, not PA, that will win it for @realDonaldTrump.
1322355569773129735 2020-10-31 09:51:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LPDonovan Maybe they don't have any magic beans but they simply lack the biased turnout models of the mainstream pollsters?
1322354724490850304 2020-10-31 09:48:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara It will only be the same if @realDonaldTrump wins, rebuilds the economy, and as a result the GOP wins in 2024 with a more typical politician, a la W Bush after Reagan.
1322353731200045056 2020-10-31 09:44:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Besides fixing the public education system, this would probably be the biggest reason to vote for him. Imagine health care that is as easy to purchase as groceries!
1322353433710628865 2020-10-31 09:43:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze I don't know why Georgia would be close. It's a Republican stronghold and @realDonaldTrump is eating into the black vote.
1322353131141926913 2020-10-31 09:42:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Even @cnn sees the writing on the wall. Surprised they allowed this to be published on their propaganda site.
1322352955912343554 2020-10-31 09:41:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ToryAnarchist @MZHemingway I guess they're admitting @realDonaldTrump is going to win?
1322352756817072128 2020-10-31 09:40:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I just... can't see @JoeBiden actually winning. I mean what sort of a presidency would that be? We really can't be governed by truinternatioverdapressure.
1322352369548623872 2020-10-31 09:39:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't get this. Why would anyone lie to a pollster? It's anonymous.
1322350899990274050 2020-10-31 09:33:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ladyeng48 @MarkMeadows Uh... in pharmaceutical storage? Have to get the EUA approved by the @US_FDA first. Aren't you guys the ones saying it's not safe and you don't trust a Trump vaccine? Safety first!

1322348188632817664 2020-10-31 09:22:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump should schedule a rally in Wisconsin just across the border from Minneapolis. .@JasonMillerinDC
1322341133654069249 2020-10-31 08:54:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Serious question: will @JoeBiden die if he loses? It just might break him. Heavy thing. @HillaryClinton had to wander around in the woods for a while.
1322340576705028098 2020-10-31 08:52:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDailyWire "Yay we're all here together as Americans to campaign, cheer, and have a good time with this election!" @JoeBiden: "You ugly divisive folks, to hell with you! Bend the knee to China."

1322338168323145728 2020-10-31 08:42:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews There it is. "truaninonashufodopressure" or as I spelled it "truintern-natioverdapressure"
1322337484047589377 2020-10-31 08:39:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TrumpWarRoom Sounds to me like Truinternatioverdapressure
1322336743127994368 2020-10-31 08:37:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Thank God state officials only let 250 in. That definitely stopped the spread of Coronavirus among the crowds outside. #Idiots

1322335173975986176 2020-10-31 08:30:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "COVID concerns" is the most ridiculous BS excuse I've ever heard. They were fine with their guys rioting in the streets and burning down the city. No "COVID concerns" there!
1322317072702050306 2020-10-31 07:18:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I can tell you right here right now that @JoeBiden going for white men AIN'T gonna work. We know what y'all want to do to us.
1322297056292184064 2020-10-31 05:59:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @esaagar The only way you get a GOP establishment is YEARS of economic growth, like what happened in the 80's and 90's. The only way out for them is through - vote @realDonaldTrump.
1322295507788681216 2020-10-31 05:53:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What part of QAnon is false? Go watch @joerogan with Alex Jones.

1322283327144034314 2020-10-31 05:04:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Right. This time the pollsters are deliberately lying.

1322279513158504449 2020-10-31 04:49:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'd prefer a conservative House. We could do with a few less of the squishes and backstabbers. Do any of them support @realDonaldTrump?
1322272611825582085 2020-10-31 04:22:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shocker. They're getting very worried folks!
1322272420523319297 2020-10-31 04:21:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @JoeBiden is losing older voters it's over. That was all he had left.
1322271831919857665 2020-10-31 04:19:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL you mean the 4% establishment hack grifter part of the party that only sees the party as a means to profit, doesn't ever actually enact conservative principles, and will chuck the party at the drop of a hat when they can no longer ravish it? Dems can have them.
1322270654620672002 2020-10-31 04:14:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES!
1322206223878574080 2020-10-30 23:58:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BecketAdams @MelissaTweets @nypost should not be forced to bend the knee and suck up to Twitter. Their original post was factual and there is no reason for them to delete it. Twitter must unblock them.

1322202051309424640 2020-10-30 23:41:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank When Democrats say "right to vote", they mean "right to vote whenever they want, wherever they want, however they want, as many times as they want". They fetishize ballot casting. They want everybody to just be casting ballots all day. Ridiculous!
1322191028133257216 2020-10-30 22:58:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We really have to do something about the House though. When are we going to get rid of @SpeakerPelosi?
1322189989128605698 2020-10-30 22:53:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I really don't give a crap about most of the @GOP senate races. Since when have they been there to support @realDonaldTrump? And now they want to ride his coattails? I don't think so. I'll support Trump and they can get themselves re-elected.

1322186604530774018 2020-10-30 22:40:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AmyEGardner The GOP is securing the election and making sure votes are legitimate. Prevent voter fraud!

1322172637402025986 2020-10-30 21:44:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOPChairwoman is our secret weapon. They won't even know what hit them!
1322172138636431363 2020-10-30 21:42:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dems would have you believe that all these people coming out to vote in Texas are Democrats. 🤣
1322168336243957769 2020-10-30 21:27:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara No. Open everything up and get it over with.
1322168000150151168 2020-10-30 21:26:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden would kill the economy.

1322166342653530112 2020-10-30 21:19:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is literally the exact opposite of what is happening.
1322159033210556419 2020-10-30 20:50:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is precisely why people voted for @realDonaldTrump. We don't have to put up with that establishment crap any more.

1322054565068496896 2020-10-30 13:55:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Either Trafalgar is a hack poll or the rest of them are. We shall see in a few days.

1322053558569754624 2020-10-30 13:51:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze @secupp @secupp always was a bit of a sell out.
1322053462474018816 2020-10-30 13:51:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll That's great but Florida is the baseline. We need one or two more big swing states.
1322053118205530112 2020-10-30 13:50:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LeeSmithDC @JackPosobiec These ****ers. They all see @realDonaldTrump as just a means to a job. Now they're just waiting for @JoeBiden to take over. FIRE THEM ALL
1322035055913537536 2020-10-30 12:38:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @michellemalkin That's right I forgot. We already have a cheap cure for Coronavirus, but of course Democrats can't let people have that. Never let a crisis go to waste! They're trying to use Coronavirus to take down @realDonaldTrump, no matter how many deaths it takes.
1322034670301810690 2020-10-30 12:36:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No they didn't. They died *with* it. Big difference.
1322032304110317571 2020-10-30 12:27:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MZHemingway It's not too hard to get Americans from all walks of your life when the main plank in your platform is... America.

1322031278548520963 2020-10-30 12:23:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> One way we could test this is to have the candidates hold competing gatherings, also known as "rallies", and see who shows up.
1322018109784530944 2020-10-30 11:30:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Votes received after the election is over are illegitimate, yes. #Idiots
1322017488549326848 2020-10-30 11:28:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @jimgeraghty Well I mean the obvious question is where do you cut it off? And you just give people more time to commit various types of election fraud by adding or removing ballots illegitimately.
1322017166225453057 2020-10-30 11:27:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Anybody who uses the term "our democracy" should be locked up for TREASON. We are a Constitutional Republic.

1321980224414900225 2020-10-30 09:00:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Zuckerberg said "our democracy" in the hearings. Dead giveaway, he's totally biased. (We are a Constitutional Republic.)
1321974572963549184 2020-10-30 08:37:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daily reminder: we are a Constitutional Republic, not a Democracy.

1321836094044983296 2020-10-29 23:27:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's more likely to win MI than PA. But both are possibilities. WI too.
1321835949563748353 2020-10-29 23:27:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes! Optionality, and #RedWave. There are many paths to 270.

1321652537892741120 2020-10-29 11:18:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The @joerogan interview with Alex Jones proves QAnon is right. That's why they banned it.

1321441260037701634 2020-10-28 21:18:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Look guys, there will be no redemption for journos. All we can do is try to get the real stories out there and eventually drive them out of business.
1321439919265501184 2020-10-28 21:13:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Why not? That's what vaccines do isn't it? Not everyone has to get it, just enough to slow the spread.
1321439115305517057 2020-10-28 21:10:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Uhh... yes a "magic wand" will stop it. It's called a vaccine.
1321437951688122376 2020-10-28 21:05:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EmeraldRobinson They're all waiting to see if @realDonaldTrump loses and hope to keep their jobs.
1321321747090755586 2020-10-28 13:23:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No. There is no "ahead". There is stupidity vs tried and true. This is the problem with arrogant Dems who think they have all the answers and in reality have none.
1321321297268350978 2020-10-28 13:22:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You're not a typical suburban woman. You have a cushy TV gig at a leftist propaganda outlet. Most suburban women want safety and security for themselves and their families.
1321320706764951552 2020-10-28 13:19:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Life ain't beanbag. Kids need to learn that.

1321260107251044352 2020-10-28 09:18:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TrumpWarRoom Whoa! Just realized - Bobulinski is THE GUY. @JoeBiden wanted to cash in on his position, but he didn't know how to set it up business-wise. That was the purpose of Bobulinski. He knows EVERYTHING.
1321259244671434753 2020-10-28 09:15:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 🚨🚨🚨 Biden business partners were UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE @FBI!!!
1321257775637405696 2020-10-28 09:09:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What are the odds that Twitter bans all conservatives in 3... 2..
1321255920010231808 2020-10-28 09:02:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They're desperate, grasping at straws...
1321254302715961348 2020-10-28 08:55:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Is 28000 the small plane or the big plane? Can't remember.
1321254108398034947 2020-10-28 08:55:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL they left like a 50 foot wide path in the middle.
1321253149643100160 2020-10-28 08:51:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Yeah but he was running against Obama. I don't think there was a *lack* of crowds for Obama like there is for Biden.

1321227968312680454 2020-10-28 07:11:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @JoeBiden wins, we're screwed folks. He's mentally incompetent. And if he's is removed on 25th amendment grounds, even worse, @KamalaHarris is president. And if *she* is impeached for absolute inanity, we then get @SpeakerPelosi as president! Like I said, screwed.
1321225782899912704 2020-10-28 07:02:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @davecatanese Internal polling I suppose.
1321223892342607874 2020-10-28 06:54:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The more this guy speaks... the further he falls in the polls.
1321223175674470404 2020-10-28 06:52:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because he's losing, and dying at the same time.
1321215357261152261 2020-10-28 06:21:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> In the United States of America, we hold 50 state elections. States count the votes, not the federal government. #Federalism
1321213818811416580 2020-10-28 06:14:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why, were you planning on submitting extra ballots after the election?
1321158912096247817 2020-10-28 02:36:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not the way checks and balances work. You can't vote to remove justices. They are appointed for life, precisely so that they are insulated from stupid politics like this.
1321157172487720960 2020-10-28 02:29:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whoo boy that new ad they just played in Lansing. Goosebumps!
1321140234155888643 2020-10-28 01:22:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benyt @esaagar Of course. The media lied, as usual.
1321140037006856192 2020-10-28 01:21:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There's PLENTY of evidence.
1321139277804244994 2020-10-28 01:18:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze The holidays are just a peaceful protest of work.
1321130116857155584 2020-10-28 00:42:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LibertyAndTech LOL what if Republicans and Democrats both decided to extend term limits so @realDonaldTrump could run against @BarackObama in 2024? I mean this has always been the real contest.
1321129919750037504 2020-10-28 00:41:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LibertyAndTech Dems really wish Obama could run again.
1321129566010822661 2020-10-28 00:40:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Another way of saying this is that it will be dead, because @JoeBiden will do ZERO work for the American people and instead just cash his checks from China as he convalesces.
1321120356695003136 2020-10-28 00:03:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Absolutely ridiculous fearmongering. They do that with *every* sickness. The point is that your body has some and knows how to make them so it can ramp up when necessary.
1321119268042383360 2020-10-27 23:59:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaaaaang no wonder we had people like Clapper spying on everyone.
1321118620618022913 2020-10-27 23:56:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Proof that @JoeBiden sold the VP seat of the United States to foreign countries.
1321118382318604291 2020-10-27 23:55:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 🚨🚨🚨 Using. @JoeBiden's. VP. Position. For. Profit. Isn't this illegal?
1321109156984770562 2020-10-27 23:19:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fortunately, in America, the people really do get the final say.
1321108351770628097 2020-10-27 23:15:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because, in fact, we did not change the rules at all.
1321088349675888641 2020-10-27 21:56:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Keeping paths open"? Sounds like they're LOSING!

1321082852457484288 2020-10-27 21:34:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SaintRPh @AsheSchow We need to get rid of the 17th amendment. Too democratic, not republican enough. Need Federalism - more power devolved away from the federal government to the States.
1321081705608990721 2020-10-27 21:29:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaaamn something got into the water over there.

1321076928779067392 2020-10-27 21:10:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> These poor schmucks. Raised in a bubble, too dumb to see through the crap their wives are feeding them.
1321075655254093826 2020-10-27 21:05:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Such hacks.
1321074347415642115 2020-10-27 21:00:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @esaagar Why do these 4 old white guys call it the "Lincoln Project"? @realDonaldTrump has way more support from the black community than their establishment GOP candidates ever got.
1321073839049232385 2020-10-27 20:58:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker Exactly. Keep calm and vote @realDonaldTrump.
1321073475948290048 2020-10-27 20:57:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dems are FREAKING OUT that they are seeing the election slip away!!!

1321072296191283201 2020-10-27 20:52:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This does NOT sound like a campaign that is confident they are winning. #PollsAreFake
1320982293763284993 2020-10-27 14:54:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It is.
1320981726328401920 2020-10-27 14:52:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ONE WEEK
1320964275775655936 2020-10-27 13:43:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) Nobody is trying to keep you from voting. We're trying to keep you from cheating after the election is already over. B) If we all vote and there are more Trump supporters than Biden supporters, we win. It's really that simple.
1320949345529847809 2020-10-27 12:44:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL nice shot with the billboard that says "justice" there. The hell are they mad about now?
1320948687384809474 2020-10-27 12:41:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JimDeMint Leftist attack dogs. They're unleashed wherever and whenever Biden (or the leftists who run his campaign) want them.
1320948433130266624 2020-10-27 12:40:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Of course @realDonaldTrump would see himself as the chosen one.
1320947771977928704 2020-10-27 12:37:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Then it could be amended. But the people don't see a need to, because it is awesome! And it is you who are out of touch. Move to a different country.

1320944838410412032 2020-10-27 12:26:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stclairashley Karate move to disarm them. Block their arm with a sideswipe. Then grab it and twist their wrist to make them drop the knife.
1320932354928611328 2020-10-27 11:36:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SenWarren thinks it is "difficult", "confusing", and "scary" to return your ballot by a certain date. How low is the IQ of her followers?
1320932173541756928 2020-10-27 11:35:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you have problems getting your ballot in by Election Day, or showing up in person to vote, you probably shouldn't be voting.
1320931942079074304 2020-10-27 11:34:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> More difficult for people to vote? By having a deadline? LOL

1320746108021342210 2020-10-26 23:16:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm FULLY ok with that. We needed to be privatizing our broken education system anyway.
1320741947846307840 2020-10-26 22:59:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Read 'em and weep, libs!
1320738791091556358 2020-10-26 22:47:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Everything @realDonaldTrump is saying about Hunter Biden is very true and has been verified by hard evidence on his laptop and multiple eyewitnesses.)
1320738006282752001 2020-10-26 22:44:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What the hell is wrong with reporters? @Mike_Pence DOES NOT HAVE CORONAVIRUS. He has tested negative multiple times.
1320737148513996801 2020-10-26 22:40:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Thank God! @cnn is going under. Our long national nightmare is over.
1320736135862231044 2020-10-26 22:36:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hospitals that are overwhelmed don't have the luxury of running ads about stuff. Completely political.
1320733176302571523 2020-10-26 22:25:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Plausible deniability does not equal character. And they certainly can't look up to you and all your creepiness with women and corruption. Why @BarackObama would not endorse you for the longest time.
1320732368303509504 2020-10-26 22:21:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM 🚨🚨🚨
1320719412715028480 2020-10-26 21:30:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr He might accidentally fire a nuclear weapon at Russia.

1320716783188410369 2020-10-26 21:19:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara If Dems are going to court pack, we should be court packing right now to compensate.
1320712852626427906 2020-10-26 21:04:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jsolomonReports Pretty obvious - everyone's wearing masks.

1320710812860895232 2020-10-26 20:56:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll @realDonaldTrump Why are you weighting Dems so heavily? Ridiculous.
1320709162062565376 2020-10-26 20:49:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL is that what you call what @JoeBiden is doing? What a joke of a rag!

1320703961880530944 2020-10-26 20:28:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SebGorka Notice how building up America is "abuse and destruction" to them. They serve foreign powers.
1320703445779755008 2020-10-26 20:26:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> One of the GOP senators that I wouldn't mind if she lost.

1320701783073869829 2020-10-26 20:20:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's very bad. @KamalaHarris will be running things.
1320595320468840448 2020-10-26 13:17:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Then we would not be the United STATES of America and we'd probably have a tyrannical dictator like North Korea.
1320580909532327936 2020-10-26 12:19:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How can people seriously look at @JoeBiden and cast a vote for him? He obviously can't be the commander-in-chief. And @KamalaHarris is even worse.
1320580614836396032 2020-10-26 12:18:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Mmm-hmm. Just like you're against fracking was a "lie"?

You don't worry about investing in a company when it's growing and you're getting an ROI. You worry when it's being pissed away on pet projects.
1320577632363229186 2020-10-26 12:06:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec No. Doesn't matter much here though. Lol there is zero chance that Biden wins Oklahoma.
1320566321701158913 2020-10-26 11:22:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Perfectly legitimate process.
1320565094166790144 2020-10-26 11:17:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher Climate change IS a hoax and no amount of liberal fantasies will change that.
1320563438150688769 2020-10-26 11:10:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What rule breaking?
1320548740294447104 2020-10-26 10:12:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? This guy is a habitual liar. @realDonaldTrump has TONS of plans! No administration has ever developed vaccines and therapeutics so quickly.
1320547401506213888 2020-10-26 10:06:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AGHamilton29 @LibertyAndTech Run up the vote in Michigan. All I'm saying.
1320546327911190528 2020-10-26 10:02:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC What the hell is @JoeBiden talking about? @realDonaldTrump is not racist at all and does not see things that way. @JoeBiden is the one that has a history of racism.
1320543601135357952 2020-10-26 09:51:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oooh tough sell.
1320542355787780096 2020-10-26 09:46:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's a terrible candidate. He could even get Coronavirus and no one would know.
1320541726252126208 2020-10-26 09:44:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher So what, should we lock everything down again? Or just wait a few weeks for the vaccine.
1320541522509631488 2020-10-26 09:43:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank Oh of course he's not, and the left is fully aware of this. They're counting on it, so they get @KamalaHarris. On the plus side, America will turn into such a hell hole that Republicans will take back the House in 2022.
1320540891656921088 2020-10-26 09:40:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @robbystarbuck @LibertyAndTech Exactly. Basically, other industries will suffer. You know, housing, food, transportation, etc.
1320538016985849857 2020-10-26 09:29:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RichardGrenell @JDRucker What, exactly, do we hire "journalists" for? They certainly don't investigate or report the news. She denies plain facts!
1320536266451070977 2020-10-26 09:22:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES!
1320536136075325440 2020-10-26 09:22:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara He'll win Michigan and win the election with 281 electoral votes. Trust only Trafalgar, which has a record of accuracy. The rest are fake leftist polls that vastly overestimate Dem turnout relative to Trump turnout.
1320534535092789250 2020-10-26 09:15:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Neither the crowds nor @Mike_Pence has Coronavirus. But he was saying that *Pence* is socially distant, and I think you knew that. #Idiot

1320532983133151238 2020-10-26 09:09:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @baseballcrank I don't want to hear about "glass ceilings" from Democrats again. @realDonaldTrump chose the most qualified possible woman for the job and Democrats voted to block her en masse.
1320532445381468161 2020-10-26 09:07:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JimDeMint What exactly is "out of whack" with the current system of checks and balances? Would you not have the President appoint justices? Would you not have the Senate confirm?

1320527969941626883 2020-10-26 08:49:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @DispatchAlerts And you know every Democrat in the medical establishment is trying to push those case numbers as high as possible.
1320527413298761728 2020-10-26 08:47:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why do we keep trying to send every student to college? For most, it's 4 years of Club Med that saddles them with insurmountable obstacles in life - a boat load of debt and no career prospects. Or maybe that's the plan? Less competition for Boomers = $$$.
1320526871986163717 2020-10-26 08:45:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'd rather die of Coronavirus than have @KamalaHarris become president. *shudder*

1320507339678646272 2020-10-26 07:27:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't care how high it spikes, we are not locking down again. That ship has sailed. We can take other measures to protect the vulnerable.
1320506242117361664 2020-10-26 07:23:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> OoooooK lol after all this time? Yeah Scottish Presbyterian sounds about right. Now after three wives, prostitutes, not going to church forever, and prosperity gospel crap, he now identifies as "non-denominational Christian"? What role would he say God plays in his life?
1320497349056233473 2020-10-26 06:47:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fact check: true. Affects his plans for 2024.

1320476686513852422 2020-10-26 05:25:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr No. Not a single person believes that. They want @KamalaHarris. Not that she's any more competent. But she's young, and, most importantly, not dying, so they have time to mold her. Just hope she doesn't kill us all before she gets trained.
1320476358959661063 2020-10-26 05:24:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dbongino It's become America vs. foreign powers. I would certainly hope that Americans have the good sense to vote for America, but some people are pretty dumb (brainwashed) out there.
1320467029850263558 2020-10-26 04:47:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody is suffering other than people who are locked down in blue states. In red states life is pretty much back to normal.

1320465747743789058 2020-10-26 04:42:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> AWWWWWW YEAAAAAAAH folks, @realDonaldTrump is WINNING!!!

1320432932314644482 2020-10-26 02:31:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Both @KamalaHarris and @Mike_Pence had staff that got Coronavirus. Guess which one the media criticize for campaigning? Shocker, I know.
1320432730899943427 2020-10-26 02:31:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHA *literally* 7 people showed up for a @KamalaHarris rally. Probably all campaign workers.

His son has pedophilia and other disgusting stuff on his laptop. Hookers and blow. Banged his dead brother's wife. Respects women my ass!
1320417531740475393 2020-10-26 01:30:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KHerriage @RyanAFournier Who. The. Hell. is voting for @JoeBiden?
1320415676226588672 2020-10-26 01:23:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (This is why they put out fake polls.)
1320415409296842752 2020-10-26 01:22:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Did I miss something or did @JoeBiden just accidentally reveal his massive voter fraud operation and no one on his campaign or in the media has said anything abut it?
1320408147216007169 2020-10-26 00:53:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Probably exposing his voter fraud operation, calling PA voters chumps, and wandering around on stage while his wife was speaking were not deemed as positive for the campaign.
1320401355127857153 2020-10-26 00:26:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Said companies are banning conservatives and negative facts about the Bidens left and right.)
1320394484396548096 2020-10-25 23:59:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump needs to look America in the eyes and tell them Coronavirus will be GONE by January.

1320269654313623554 2020-10-25 15:43:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @IngrahamAngle One press conference from @kayleighmcenany could clear this all up. Get her back out there!

1320228173016141825 2020-10-25 12:58:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL! @JoeBiden has max 100 people at a rally @realDonaldTrump has tens of thousands at his rallies ... @kanyewest just got 3 million views on @joerogan
1320174333923385344 2020-10-25 09:24:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And exposed his VOTER FRAUD operation.
1320173484966924288 2020-10-25 09:21:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> After today? "Hi everybody, we do great voter fraud here!" LID
1320173366871994369 2020-10-25 09:20:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We need to move away from free video hosting. If you're paying a platform like @rumblevideo to host your videos, they're obliged to give you good customer service.

1320144957324361728 2020-10-25 07:27:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah OK I'm not really sure that you would know anything about how God works @realDonaldTrump.
1320138876208533505 2020-10-25 07:03:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He slipped and let the cat out of the bag.

1320133314125156353 2020-10-25 06:41:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (This is why they hide him under a lid in the basement.)
1320133154661945345 2020-10-25 06:40:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No, guys, he didn't mean something else. He meant what he said, he just doesn't have the brains to realize he shouldn't have said it.
1320132901053353984 2020-10-25 06:39:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOCK HIM UP
1320132437377191936 2020-10-25 06:37:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What. The. Hell. Joe's mind is slipping and he accidentally revealed the truth!

1320097882003935233 2020-10-25 04:20:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pretty sure he knows he's black. @chelseahandler wants him to be a leftist Democrat. Despicable!
1320096976625598464 2020-10-25 04:17:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There's a historical pattern that everyone has forgotten about. After a conservative victory and economic growth comes... revival. After Reagan came the Billy Graham crusades. After @realDonaldTrump? There's only man who sees it - @kanyewest is the unquestionable leader.

1319887092709793792 2020-10-24 14:22:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is satire, right?
1319853515393687552 2020-10-24 12:09:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I currently have @realDonaldTrump winning the electoral college with at least 281 electoral votes.
1319849391960821760 2020-10-24 11:53:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you don't like @realDonaldTrump but also don't want to have to vote for @JoeBiden *cough* Bernie bros *cough* it's perfectly fine NOT to vote. Ignore the noise that says you have to vote.

1319819166430494720 2020-10-24 09:53:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump: 10 new massive rallies @JoeBiden: slinks off back to his basement, defeated
1319818580746248192 2020-10-24 09:50:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara They can say COVID is surging all they want, but I haven't seen it. I don't know of anybody else who's getting it. And "testing positive" does not mean you get sick.
1319811138423488512 2020-10-24 09:21:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tedcruz Actually I think they're putting that warning on every link.

1319785296590999552 2020-10-24 07:38:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden LITERALLY helped China KILL a Michigan manufacturing business. He's not winning the state.

1319481643099357185 2020-10-23 11:31:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> In 2017 @JoeBiden would already have been putting together his campaign. China knew. They were buying influence over a potential future president.

1319081506808209411 2020-10-22 09:01:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hence the virus.
1319080200341196806 2020-10-22 08:56:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We're not stupid here.
1319079492527230976 2020-10-22 08:53:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well they won't be there, so change the rules.
1319079255058284545 2020-10-22 08:52:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bet he gets #MeToo'd.
1319078658628268033 2020-10-22 08:50:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He voted for Biden, obviously. Damn Benedict Arnold. He'll betray you at the drop of hat if it serves his purposes.
1319077950348812289 2020-10-22 08:47:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'd prefer you hold Twitter accountable. What happened to that one?
1319077154697740293 2020-10-22 08:44:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheRightScoop Twitter (the company) is FAKE NEWS!
1319076948216303619 2020-10-22 08:43:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher How can you side with these people? Seriously! You know they're frauds and phonies.
1319076776002420736 2020-10-22 08:43:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The rules are that if it helps @JoeBiden and is fake, everything is good, but if it is real and helps @realDonaldTrump, they will spin it with fake context.
1319076304298323970 2020-10-22 08:41:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benshapiro Wow, such fake media! So he DIDN'T get the treatment, and died as a result. GIVE PEOPLE THE TREATMENT.
1319076075436187648 2020-10-22 08:40:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug The prophecy has been fulfilled.

1319075135853416449 2020-10-22 08:36:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LeeSmithDC @LibertyAndTech Because they're NeverTrumpers who support @JoeBiden.
1319053779300438017 2020-10-22 07:11:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The private sector makes things better. The government only destroys.
1319050924485234690 2020-10-22 07:00:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So tell @JoeBiden to cut it out! He literally JUST lied to our faces about Hunter Biden.
1319050643164811265 2020-10-22 06:59:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Smack 'em down @tedcruz. Let people sue them on 1st amendment grounds!
1319049121748189186 2020-10-22 06:53:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell?
1319048495421149190 2020-10-22 06:50:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The left totally wants to unify the country. /sarc
1319038176862867457 2020-10-22 06:09:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He has show himself the opposite of that. Y'all killed manufacturing and told us it was never coming back.
1319037370436640768 2020-10-22 06:06:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec @Twitter @nypost Twitter is just openly showing their bias. And for some crooked reason, Republicans in Congress are allowing them to squelch free speech.
1319036332308574210 2020-10-22 06:02:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Then not a single one of you would have any cute little babies.
1319035046783799297 2020-10-22 05:57:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You won't go back to "normal" with @JoeBiden. You'll go to poverty and depression, while he shakes down more countries to make DC rich.
1318988714962505729 2020-10-22 02:53:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Traitor! Boot him out of the party.

1318987225212854275 2020-10-22 02:47:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You don't know how the market works. Redundant workers, lazy ones, etc don't get money for free. The market rewards the most efficient businesses. Otherwise investment would go elsewhere and the company would slowly die.
1318985926622707713 2020-10-22 02:42:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EmeraldRobinson Did they die from the virus though?
1318985547466014720 2020-10-22 02:40:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Twitter flagged. Means it's real news.
1318985067218259974 2020-10-22 02:38:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Twitter adding a context warning to tweets is going to make them super valuable.
1318984840671277058 2020-10-22 02:37:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RyanAFournier No, Twitter, I do not want to read the article first. I trust the people who wrote it. This sucks so much. Regulate twitter now.
1318984327435268096 2020-10-22 02:35:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RobHerring @realDonaldTrump Because Democrats are evil and want more people to die from Coronavirus so they can blame @realDonaldTrump for it.
1318983034830553089 2020-10-22 02:30:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SenTedCruz @Newsweek LOL Twitter "adding context" to this tweet just proves the veracity of it.
1318982748065980418 2020-10-22 02:29:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why the HELL is twitter censoring this story?
1318981065592180736 2020-10-22 02:22:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Come on, man. Of course it's true!
1318980150382440448 2020-10-22 02:19:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why is Twitter providing "context" "for me"? I don't need or want their biased fake crap!
1318965578967797760 2020-10-22 01:21:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Vindication for Louis C.K.
1318965066562232320 2020-10-22 01:19:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @catturd2 He should walk out the first time they cut his mic.
1318964392705331200 2020-10-22 01:16:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Hospitalizations and deaths are way down, and continue to decrease.)
1318963607481257984 2020-10-22 01:13:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well I guess #MeToo is officially over. Literally the definition of workplace sexual harassment.
1318955613070741507 2020-10-22 00:41:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So I guess @JoeBiden is just going with straight up lying to our faces now?
1318953293431951360 2020-10-22 00:32:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democrats are the ones keeping everybody locked down. So...
1318952979165335553 2020-10-22 00:31:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't know how he still has ANY lead at all, but this is  @HillaryClinton territory.
1318952522468478978 2020-10-22 00:29:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews The people will not be defeated.
1318937483086876677 2020-10-21 23:29:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well that's ridiculous. LVs are *more* likely to vote for Biden? LOL
1318937074519638019 2020-10-21 23:27:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOPChairwoman @TrumpWarRoom @realDonaldTrump You need to just camp out there doing rallies.
1318935992607322113 2020-10-21 23:23:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Awful. They're going to use this to not call it on election night, so they know where to commit fraud afterwards.
1318929378169028612 2020-10-21 22:57:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Your daily reminder: Keep calm and vote @realDonaldTrump.
1318927887890776065 2020-10-21 22:51:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I can think of one thing he covered himself in.
1318927513536573441 2020-10-21 22:49:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DrewHolden360 @baseballcrank It's a stick up. "Give me money or I'll call you a fascist." Get a job, punk.
1318924075847352322 2020-10-21 22:36:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1318923753485705217 2020-10-21 22:35:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Improper??? @JoeBiden DEFINITELY needs to be investigated.
1318864866204155904 2020-10-21 18:41:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fortunately. We're not out here pandering hat in hand to liberal squishes. We're out here providing strong leadership! Get on the train or get left behind.
1318854410727030784 2020-10-21 17:59:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealSaavedra It's amazing how they continue to push the Russian hoax on anything they don't like, even though it's been so thoroughly discredited.
1318811718122864640 2020-10-21 15:09:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @davidharsanyi @RealSaavedra If the Senate weren't set up this way, it would just be the House.
1318801651592024064 2020-10-21 14:29:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Is it a scandal if the @fbi finds child porn on the computer of the vice president's son and covers it up instead of investigating?
1318791993519185920 2020-10-21 13:51:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chuckwoolery Heck, if no one wants to investigate, just let the Trump campaign use it in ads. Better yet, make a searchable database like they did for @SarahPalinUSA's emails. Crowdsource it!
1318789596545798144 2020-10-21 13:41:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why... why do people still watch @cnn? It's a fake news channel that outright lies to people.
1318789093510217728 2020-10-21 13:39:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CalebJHull Obviously @JoeBiden would have to be impeached. *which is what they want* President  @KamalaHarris .
1318788770737639425 2020-10-21 13:38:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Jim_Jordan @RealSaavedra Sue again after Monday.
1318787424789606400 2020-10-21 13:33:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @w_terrence @JackPosobiec Good point. @KamalaHarris probably tipped @RudyGiuliani off to the Hunter stuff in the first place. The left always pretends to aim at Trump while aiming at Biden.
1318786973839069185 2020-10-21 13:31:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you think the @FBI will actually do anything about it.
1318786727910297600 2020-10-21 13:30:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PaulRevere1999 @LibertyAndTech Hunter Biden Hot Potato! No one wants to be the agency who has to investigate him.
1318782472201641986 2020-10-21 13:13:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CalebJHull @LibertyAndTech No he meant what he said. He was proud of how well he covered it up.
1318770654460710912 2020-10-21 12:26:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Do suburban women want to turn the Oval Office into a child porn theater? No? Vote @realDonaldTrump.

1318767938661384192 2020-10-21 12:15:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CassandraRules @LibertyAndTech Hunter molested children in his family!
1318767522657804288 2020-10-21 12:14:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CassandraRules @LibertyAndTech Daaaamn Hunter is going to jail.

1318750191164555265 2020-10-21 11:05:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Obviously. Arizona too. Your biggest problem though is that you're about to be hit with a crap ton of spending from the Biden campaign. Hope you can scrounge up some dough. Why doesn't @realDonaldTrump take a loan against his assets? This is his last rodeo anyway.
1318749389809213440 2020-10-21 11:02:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @One____Nation @Neoavatara Lol? Those are numbers directly from the rallies. Have you not see @GOPChairwoman and the @gop tweeting them out all the time?

1318556173319217152 2020-10-20 22:14:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @HeyTammyBruce @AdamLaxalt @realDonaldTrump should ask her about this whenever she asks a bad question.

1317066352683831298 2020-10-16 19:34:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (You will.)
1317066173545066498 2020-10-16 19:33:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What an idiot.
1317065948491296770 2020-10-16 19:32:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Let's clear something up right now. We are NOT a Democracy. We are a Constitutional Republic! Our representatives are chosen *democratically*, but the Constitution is the ultimate law of the land and rights are protected.
1317065128811036672 2020-10-16 19:29:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PolitiBunny There was another stream of Biden with 500k viewers.
1317064506531598337 2020-10-16 19:27:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @esaagar I mean they actually did do that.
1317064094676099074 2020-10-16 19:25:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL no.
1317063980238688257 2020-10-16 19:24:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @karunsagar15 @robbysoave @HotlineJosh Uh... false. I know more than young people not because I'm smarter than them, but simply because I've been around longer and seen more crap. Life experience!
1316983769467920384 2020-10-16 14:06:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. There was no error. It was deliberate. @jack was forced to comply by a congressional subpoena.
1316963374752796675 2020-10-16 12:45:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Congressional subpoenas do the trick!
1316963199703535616 2020-10-16 12:44:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why do people buy this crap?
1316962382137200640 2020-10-16 12:41:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because there's nothing wrong with QAnon. Jeffrey Epstein ran a Satanic Democrat pedophile ring and you guys are covering for him.
1316960986717442052 2020-10-16 12:35:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "unverified"  Obviously not widespread enough.
1316959281518907393 2020-10-16 12:28:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Presumably he would immediately be under investigation by the Senate for corruption.
1316958715413749760 2020-10-16 12:26:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He's not.)
1316958552280473601 2020-10-16 12:26:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump please fire everyone at the @fbi and start over.
1316958244359819264 2020-10-16 12:24:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's... kind of sad. He's 75. Bowing and scraping for a few million? Doesn't he have billions?
1316945665029799937 2020-10-16 11:34:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It really is @realDonaldTrump vs the media. Their corruption and duplicity never ceases to astound.
1316940047178993664 2020-10-16 11:12:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wow. @GStephanopoulos said @JoeBiden did a "service to our democracy". We do not live in a democracy. We live in a Constitutional republic.

1316929001651396614 2020-10-16 10:28:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Epstein's Satanic pedophile ring IS REAL and it should be covered in the news. And the banks he owes $400 million to are public record. He did reference the banks.
1316928144788627456 2020-10-16 10:25:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @vijaya @HotlineJosh Why must you weigh in with a biased opinion on content?
1316927988630519810 2020-10-16 10:24:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) It was not hacked. B) Needs no additional "context" i.e. spin from twitter.

1316925428230246401 2020-10-16 10:14:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheBrandonMorse @LibertyAndTech @realDonaldTrump @joerogan IDK @joerogan is kind of loopy sometimes. He isn't going to convince @realDonaldTrump to do drugs or... not be a square.

1316924150045413376 2020-10-16 10:09:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Epstein led a Satanic pedophile ring full of Democrats, and he didn't kill himself.

1316920921488326661 2020-10-16 09:56:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Epstein didn't kill himself.
1316920485846917120 2020-10-16 09:54:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @robbysoave @HotlineJosh As said uncle, my response is "I'm older than you and I know more about how the world works.

1316918513483874307 2020-10-16 09:46:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sadly, there wouldn't have been as many viewers, especially those in the middle or on the left.
1316914666019454976 2020-10-16 09:31:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MZHemingway @MelissaTweets @exjon Probably began with Epstein, who DID INDEED run a Satanic pedophile ring with elitists and Democrats.
1316913392570060802 2020-10-16 09:26:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "I'm a lousy candidate and I didn't do a good job." - @JoeBiden   Truer words were never spoken.

1316912528723759116 2020-10-16 09:23:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And they say there's no pedophile ring.

1316910339078950912 2020-10-16 09:14:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Why does anyone let @GStephanopoulos do anything? He is literally @HillaryClinton's puppet. A virtual surrogate.
1316909843463196672 2020-10-16 09:12:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hadn't done that in a few days. Dems were getting antsy!
1316908614930542593 2020-10-16 09:07:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SmoosieQ @RealKiraDavis @realDonaldTrump I think what he was trying to say is that once the border has been fully secured, it will not be a big deal to help Dreamers who are already here.
1316908154488344577 2020-10-16 09:05:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LibertyAndTech When I think of @realDonaldTrump, "man in the arena" comes to mind. @JoeBiden is the man on the sidelines taking potshots.
1316907715663400963 2020-10-16 09:04:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL well he won over the studio audience. Points for going into the lion's den and arguing his case.
1316902914686943232 2020-10-16 08:44:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pretty genius so far. @realDonaldTrump cutting through the media and speaking directly to Dems, showing how the media is lying to them.
1316899699371200514 2020-10-16 08:32:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why are all the questioners young to middle age women?
1316899521465561088 2020-10-16 08:31:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> In a way, this is actually more representative of the race, which is between @realDonaldTrump and the media, not @JoeBiden, who is largely irrelevant.
1316899137108008960 2020-10-16 08:29:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL at least it's entertaining... guess where all the eyeballs will be.

1316537058723332097 2020-10-15 08:31:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So fix it, and fire whoever was responsible for this crap. As penance, I recommend that you promote the article in question on Twitter.
1316527879983968258 2020-10-15 07:54:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why they're shutting everybody down. You'll probably be banned next.
1316526401642737666 2020-10-15 07:48:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Gonna have to start referring to Hunter as he who shall not be named.
1316526145618284549 2020-10-15 07:47:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is on 🔥🔥🔥 tonight.

1316519451257434115 2020-10-15 07:21:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody in DC built America. They are parasites who suck off of America. @realDonaldTrump is a builder. He's the one who built America.
1316515173348368385 2020-10-15 07:04:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @abandonedshoe @JackPosobiec @OANN Hunter/Burisma is this cycle's Hillary's emails.
1316514963788308481 2020-10-15 07:03:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Twitter would have covered up Watergate (if Nixon had been on the other side).

1316211497887059968 2020-10-14 10:57:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL because N95 masks are the best and most comfortable but they don't protect *other* people.

1316204492501782531 2020-10-14 10:29:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The thing that pisses me off the most about Democrats is that they want to get rid of individual, inalienable rights. Only the collective matters and they'll screw you if they feel like it. THAT is why they want to get rid of a court that would protect your rights.
1316202591399956481 2020-10-14 10:22:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @philipaklein In the history of presidential politics, I do not believe that the dry, humorless worry wort has ever beaten the charismatic candidate dancing and having a good time with large crowds.

1315699594169405441 2020-10-13 01:03:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Meadows was at @realDonaldTrump's side in the hospital. Doubt he cares if he gets it.
1315699023324549122 2020-10-13 01:01:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Show us the plan, man. How you gonna do it? Cut red tape? Price transparency? Flood the market with doctors? More competition in the pharmaceutical industry? Let us know!
1315698522742755329 2020-10-13 00:59:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Also prices are so high in New Zealand that only retired doctors have enough money to move there.

1315697153424207872 2020-10-13 00:53:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump People are skeptical. What's your plan? Do we need a plan besides the free market, which could provide excellent, affordable health care?

He has the entire media arrayed against him. He's not arrogant, he just has to cut through the media lies.
1315500351626326016 2020-10-12 11:51:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec That's because @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris love to accuse @realDonaldTrump of murdering people for a virus that came from China, and secretly are happy to see their supporters murdering Trump supporters.

1315458611770990592 2020-10-12 09:05:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The purpose of @JoeBiden is for the elites to put down the plebes. Don't let him!

B) When you have billions in assets, and just half a billion of debt due to financing development projects, you are not in debt. You are leveraged - i.e. you have the assets to back up the debt. It's like a mortgage where the house is the collateral

1315128975992279042 2020-10-11 11:15:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealKiraDavis Yup. Same in Oklahoma. If we wear masks at all.
1315111317536153601 2020-10-11 10:05:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @amandacarpenter @redsteeze @rumpfshaker Actually I believe she was harassing him.
1315109977695100928 2020-10-11 10:00:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So... did he test negative?
1315108645835767810 2020-10-11 09:55:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @reallouiehuey @jannyfayray Is this the first presidential campaign when supporters of one candidate are literally assassinating supporters of the other one? Can't remember a campaign where that has happened before.

1315106663855259654 2020-10-11 09:47:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen And murdering patriots in cold blood.

There was no "precedent" set, Republicans simply didn't like him and didn't vote to confirm him. And if there was any "precedent" it would be when the Senate was held by the *opposing* party to the President.
1315025493339582466 2020-10-11 04:24:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @yashar @JasonMillerinDC is currently running @realDonaldTrump's campaign lol.

1315023728019939333 2020-10-11 04:17:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's literally why we support @realDonaldTrump over the likes of you and McCain.

1315016750522658818 2020-10-11 03:49:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump Not the liberal media's norms anyway. More in the tradition of Reagan and Limbaugh. We had suffered under 8 years of progressive rule. He had to shake things up to get us back to normal.

1315014434436374528 2020-10-11 03:40:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara If that were true, then why isn't he out there in public life? He got his tail kicked and has now retreated to his ranch where he does art therapy to deal with the trauma. The one time he popped his head up it was quickly whacked down again.
1315014049894146058 2020-10-11 03:39:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Republicans "packing" the court? How so?

1315011663981170688 2020-10-11 03:29:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SmugSmugy @__dylon___ @redsteeze He did no such thing. If you expand it, the GOP will expand it further next time they have power to undo your harmful changes.
1314998874306740229 2020-10-11 02:38:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Interesting realignment happening here. Minorities to @realDonaldTrump, establishment GOP hacks/Wall St/globalists to @JoeBiden. Who can get more crossover votes?

1314943334037819393 2020-10-10 22:58:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump should just say "Biden plans to pack the courts" and leave it up to him if he wants to deny it.

1314787932457381888 2020-10-10 12:40:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I mean if you consider outright lies to be within norms.
1314786183927541761 2020-10-10 12:33:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uhhh... no. It would ensure that he is universally hated.
1314785989395730432 2020-10-10 12:33:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> To never allow free elections again?

1314781097666973697 2020-10-10 12:13:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. He said that he will raise taxes by $4 trillion. There's not enough money in the world to get that from those making over $400,000 / yr.
1314766948127969281 2020-10-10 11:17:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Keep calm and vote @realDonaldTrump. What will be, will be.

1314742380256428033 2020-10-10 09:39:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT Means he had the typical white dots on the CT scan, inflammation, etc. Dexamethasone probably knocked that out.
1314742130737401856 2020-10-10 09:38:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Let's get one thing straight, @realDonaldTrump does NOT have to test negative before returning to the campaign trail. He is fully recovered, asymptomatic, and non-contagious.

1314596493098135554 2020-10-10 00:00:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @kayleighmcenany should hold a press conference. Invite the reporters to the room and then have her on a screen.

1314549844439109632 2020-10-09 20:54:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden is the one who pulled out of the debate. He is afraid to debate in person, because he knows he will lose.

1314336669303267328 2020-10-09 06:47:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh. Oh gosh. It's going to be Harris-Clinton, isn't it? We are so screwed.
1314336451765637120 2020-10-09 06:46:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen They don't really care about stopping abortion.
1314336260471873536 2020-10-09 06:45:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Are... are kidnapping hoaxes common on the left? First Smollett, now this.
1314336057329160194 2020-10-09 06:45:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The power would go straight to her head and we'd all be screwed.
1314335901401649152 2020-10-09 06:44:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We need a new Tea Party.
1314335640532791296 2020-10-09 06:43:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Well, you're the one that calls her crazy. But yeah.
1314335529454968833 2020-10-09 06:43:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamalaHarris is going to raise your taxes and take all your money for her little "power girl" feminist fantasy, while enslaving you to work for minimum wage.
1314335046761938946 2020-10-09 06:41:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr @JoeBiden will not be the one packing the courts. @KamalaHarris will.
1314334814351355910 2020-10-09 06:40:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @megynkelly Vote @realDonaldTrump then. *sigh* Why do we always do this to ourselves, America?
1314334427057709056 2020-10-09 06:38:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You guys do understand what's going on here, right? The left is plotting a coup. As soon as the election is won, they'll do away with @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris will be prez. Harris, whatever terrible person she picks for VP, and Pelosi. Is that who you want running the govt?
1314334039059374080 2020-10-09 06:37:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets Needs to dump @JoeBiden after the election.
1314333856569405440 2020-10-09 06:36:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> COVID is now spreading among reporters... only a matter of time before the @JoeBiden campaign gets it.
1314333344725970944 2020-10-09 06:34:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) Unconstitutional B) It would immediately be used on @JoeBiden. I guess that's the real goal here - make @KamalaHarris president.
1314333076676370433 2020-10-09 06:33:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RyanAFournier Damn people keep voting for Democrats, and they keep electing a far left loon as Speaker.

1314284497173655557 2020-10-09 03:20:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You absolute imbecile. Have you ever been sick before? You don't get sick from the same thing again. You develop immunity.
1314284207397646336 2020-10-09 03:19:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Good. A whole 3 hours to speak, uninterrupted.
1314283893273620482 2020-10-09 03:17:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr She needs to be removed for health reasons. "Good morning, Sunday morning". She might accidentally nuke someone if she were in charge. Remove Biden too.
1314283312446418945 2020-10-09 03:15:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PostFomo The hell are you talking about?

1314255990775255041 2020-10-09 01:27:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump you're the president. You call the shots. Do do a rally, make it happen. If you can't get out there and fight, we may as well just go home and resign ourselves to a @KamalaHarris presidency. *shudder*
1314242394494205955 2020-10-09 00:32:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> lol wut?
1314242309115052032 2020-10-09 00:32:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He declined the debate by insisting on rigging it.
1314241872974483457 2020-10-09 00:30:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL yes, hold the rally for precisely this reason. @JoeBiden won't know what to do.
1314241473974595585 2020-10-09 00:29:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @mitchellreports @BenjySarlin HAHA @realDonaldTrump should have been on steroids for the rallies BEFORE he got Coronavirus.
1314241016845787137 2020-10-09 00:27:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Sorry this is what we'll get when @KamalaHarris is president.
1314240839049187328 2020-10-09 00:26:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I elected @realDonaldTrump to stop @SpeakerPelosi's cash grab for establishment elites.

1314230759985754113 2020-10-08 23:46:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EdRollins @RyanAFournier @ericbeachgop The @realDonaldTrump and @JoeBiden campaigns should plan their own debates, or not have any at all.
1314229353992122370 2020-10-08 23:41:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Democracy" does not protect our God given rights. Be very wary of anyone talking about "our democracy". "My Constitutional rights" are more important.
1314226397569785859 2020-10-08 23:29:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Lies.

1314225428362600450 2020-10-08 23:25:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Frickin hack!
1314225239128244224 2020-10-08 23:24:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Both cameras on at all times, no moderator. Let them ask each other questions and duke it out. No time limits.
1314225027773071365 2020-10-08 23:23:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't care if @realDonaldTrump is still testing positive for COVID, get him back out on the campaign trail! Social distancing, plexiglass, whatever it takes.
1314223247936884736 2020-10-08 23:16:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I will never understand why taxes are so popular? I mean it's literally just the government taking your money away.
1314222260442533890 2020-10-08 23:12:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Lies. Shameful and gross.

1314218233428406274 2020-10-08 22:56:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Pure democracy is mob rule which leads to dictatorship. We are a Constitutional Republic where individual rights are protected.
1314210278477758464 2020-10-08 22:25:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uhh... the commission on debates changes their mind every second. Everything for the cause, comrade!
1314209027107110912 2020-10-08 22:20:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Because he recovered. And he has antibodies.
1314207756107169792 2020-10-08 22:15:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh oh. Who's the lying dog-faced pony soldier now? Yup that's right, @JoeBiden.

1314206738879377409 2020-10-08 22:11:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @MelissaTweets I can't read your mind. If you have some problem with Trump you have to say what it is.
1314206549947023363 2020-10-08 22:10:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @MelissaTweets Up to you to stop him, but I guess you have some weird problem with Trump.
1314206458947407872 2020-10-08 22:10:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets @Neoavatara I voted for @TeamMcMullin. Terrible decision, I was wrong. He has turned out to be awful and @realDonaldTrump was the right choice.
1314194877693952001 2020-10-08 21:24:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @MelissaTweets What would I blame him for? He's done everything right. He's not the issue here.
1314194361450729472 2020-10-08 21:22:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @MelissaTweets You can do nothing and get Biden or vote for Trump and get Trump. You made your choice.
1314194118504001536 2020-10-08 21:21:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @MelissaTweets It's on you. Don't try to duck responsibility for this. You know exactly what you're doing and you've chosen Biden over Trump.
1314193836034449409 2020-10-08 21:20:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOCK HER UP!
1314193516554321922 2020-10-08 21:18:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @MelissaTweets It will be because wishy washy people like you didn't vote for Trump. You get to choose, but then you have to live with the consequences of that decision.
1314191076723429378 2020-10-08 21:09:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Coming off of it is hard. He shouldn't do that until after the election.
1314190817167396865 2020-10-08 21:08:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @secupp ...or rather, a *Constitutional* Republic with democratically elected representatives
1314190433464078337 2020-10-08 21:06:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes! We are a *Republic* with democratically elected representatives.
1314190225678233602 2020-10-08 21:05:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because he recovered and the antibodies have been found in his blood you freaking idiot!
1314189363497107456 2020-10-08 21:02:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And men know that women think this, and know that they are wrong. That's why we have to mansplain it to you. 😆
1314187069820932096 2020-10-08 20:53:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT He doesn't need to test negative to do a rally. A) He's no longer contagious. B) He's not close to anyone up on stage.
1314186371741908997 2020-10-08 20:50:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "good genes"

1314185844929040384 2020-10-08 20:48:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Correct! Get back out there sir!
1314185170141040640 2020-10-08 20:45:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KatMcKinley Some sort of feminist virtue signaling gone wrong. Power tripping and being patronizing towards men is very unattractive.
1314184667856240640 2020-10-08 20:43:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Doesn't matter. If you add a burden of $4 trillion in taxes to the economy you will shrink paychecks and kill jobs anyway.
1314183676276678657 2020-10-08 20:39:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is COVID free. We need him out on the trail. Time for a #FreeTrump campaign!
1314183447666188289 2020-10-08 20:38:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good!
1314183079683133440 2020-10-08 20:37:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @HolmesJosh @BretBaier The commission IS the @JoeBiden campaign.
1314182675016622080 2020-10-08 20:35:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EricTrump Reject it.
1314182605353476096 2020-10-08 20:35:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whatever. @realDonaldTrump can hold a rally at any time and no one will care about ol @JoeBiden doddering about on a stage by himself somewhere.

1314167412825231367 2020-10-08 19:35:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What a crock of s***! He's all better! He has antibodies and is not contagious! They just want to be able to mute him. @realDonaldTrump should consider pulling out.
1314165954436304897 2020-10-08 19:29:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Booo

1314072832851181568 2020-10-08 13:19:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Harlan I can't RT that out of respect for the many good women out there, but... yeah.
1314071348629602305 2020-10-08 13:13:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1314068699758854144 2020-10-08 13:02:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is exactly why she is so irritating. She treats men like toddlers and goes off on some power trip, when in reality she is a complete idiot. It would be like giving a 5 year old complete control of all adult decisions.
1314067806070153216 2020-10-08 12:59:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Lies from the pit of hell from this demon spawn child.

1314060581473865728 2020-10-08 12:30:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What is with these loons?
1314059401502904320 2020-10-08 12:25:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I prefer bartender Ocaiso-Cortez, especially when you disrespect the Vice Presidency of the US.
1314058935968595968 2020-10-08 12:23:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If Trump restrained himself the election wouldn't be worth winning.
1314058666383937536 2020-10-08 12:22:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Just think of it as "a poll of CNN viewers" which are the most whacked out leftists out there.
1314058513803599875 2020-10-08 12:22:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is how you know @cnn polling is complete and utter lies.

1314041048193216512 2020-10-08 11:12:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I imagine @KamalaHarris is curled up in the fetal position under a desk somewhere, crying and hugging a bottle of wine.
1314040326261178368 2020-10-08 11:10:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bullcrap.

1314036443044614144 2020-10-08 10:54:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BillOReilly knows what he's talking about on polls.
1314036257811566592 2020-10-08 10:53:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @abigailmarone @LibertyAndTech Unwatchable. Switch over to @TheFirstonTV. I'm not sure if it's any good or not but it's... not that.
1314036010913796099 2020-10-08 10:52:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Here's my answer to the 8-yr old: List up, kid, life ain't all sunshine and roses. There are in fact bad people and bad things that happen in the world. We NEED to argue and fight against bad things to produce the best possible future for you.
1314034450704011264 2020-10-08 10:46:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ol Alzheimer's Joe super focused on the key issues tonight.
1314033175555964928 2020-10-08 10:41:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's been out there. Leading rallies. He doesn't attract as much attention. Boring compared to Trump.
1314032819983745025 2020-10-08 10:40:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Very true. They certainly wouldn't interrupt.

1314031447678881792 2020-10-08 10:34:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamalaHarris was a complete disaster. The moderator was terrible. @Mike_Pence overwhelmingly won.

1314029615887851521 2020-10-08 10:27:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KevinFarzad @ScottFConroy Yeah why does he have pink eye? Is that a side effect of Coronavirus?
1314029358672236545 2020-10-08 10:26:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamalaHarris doesn't know what she is talking about. Just repeating debunked liberal hoaxes.
1314028836816850944 2020-10-08 10:24:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Mike_Pence should get up and walk out. WORST MODERATOR EVER
1314028135181058050 2020-10-08 10:21:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Did @cnn send the fly?
1314027659953934337 2020-10-08 10:19:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FINALLY
1314027534263226368 2020-10-08 10:19:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> MOVE fly. They'll have a field day with this.

1314027172575707139 2020-10-08 10:17:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh no. The fly!
1314026954639716352 2020-10-08 10:16:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There it is.
1314026673764028416 2020-10-08 10:15:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Chokeholds are the NON LETHAL options. Protesters should LOVE them!

1314022976287911940 2020-10-08 10:01:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benshapiro Good, but not as good as Trump himself. A little dry.
1314022718476627968 2020-10-08 10:00:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Absolute disaster for her. And she would be president within a year.
1314022591636668424 2020-10-08 09:59:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamalaHarris: "What happened to your daughter was so terrible. Um, anyway, NEXT TOPIC."
1314021459421954048 2020-10-08 09:55:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHAHAHAHA she seriously went there! The hoax that @HillaryClinton set up! Absolute disaster for her.

1314019802927828993 2020-10-08 09:48:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamalaHarris is really bad at this.
1314019466267758592 2020-10-08 09:47:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ARmastrangelo @KamalaHarris is no great leader of the matriarchy

1314016722802876417 2020-10-08 09:36:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Remember that @KamalaHarris is running to be PRESIDENT, not vice president. Very scary!
1314016477780103174 2020-10-08 09:35:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamalaHarris SWING and a miss. She looks so bad here.
1314015647710490631 2020-10-08 09:31:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jordanparker_ If you have $10 billion of assets and $0.5 billion in debt, you are $9.5 billion in the black. You are NOT in debt.
1314015046482251776 2020-10-08 09:29:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why does she keep trying to cut @Mike_Pence off before he's even made his point?
1314014603370786816 2020-10-08 09:27:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bullcrap. @realDonaldTrump has billions in assets. Half a billion of leverage has no bearing on his decisions.
1314012155956600832 2020-10-08 09:18:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Mike_Pence is showing serious gravitas and leadership. @KamalaHarris is like a little kid whining about stuff without understanding things.
1314009352408363010 2020-10-08 09:06:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Already the WORST moderator ever. It's not even Trump up there!

1313997163156955137 2020-10-08 08:18:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He should keep referring to her as a candidate for President.

1313985463141781509 2020-10-08 07:32:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PostFomo @Rasmussen_Poll I agree - the question of what happens to your soul after you die is very important.
1313981553635135488 2020-10-08 07:16:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It was. He defeated it and found the cure. Our president is a HERO!

1313918593466236930 2020-10-08 03:06:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ewarren ...relief only comes from opening up the economy and PRODUCING goods and services, which you oppose.
1313918349009711104 2020-10-08 03:05:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Relief" from whom? Who's money are you taking?
1313917494277607424 2020-10-08 03:01:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fortunately, @realDonaldTrump supporters, you know, the actual voters, are not DC types.
1313916275857518592 2020-10-08 02:57:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Anybody else symptom free for 24 hours but still out sick from work? Get back out there @realDonaldTrump!

1313904067371053056 2020-10-08 02:08:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Yeah but it's on one TV channel, not in control of our country.
1313903768715624459 2020-10-08 02:07:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Sorry man. You're not voting for Trump. This is the crap you're gonna get for the next 4-8 years. Don't say you didn't have a choice.
1313902878617145346 2020-10-08 02:03:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @megynkelly @scrowder you have GOT to ask her about the blood comment. Must see TV and I know she wants publicity.
1313902194928816131 2020-10-08 02:01:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @seanhannity Notice how they've gone completely silent. BUSTED! They got caught and now they're hoping nobody notices before the election and Biden wins.
1313901449714307074 2020-10-08 01:58:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BobbyL_AZ @KSoltisAnderson Polls are crap. Look at where they are campaigning. That will tell you everything.
1313901285972873216 2020-10-08 01:57:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PostFomo @Rasmussen_Poll I'll meet you in reality when you get rid of the "pronouns" in your profile. God created them in his image, male and female.

1313877442185105417 2020-10-08 00:22:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BobbyL_AZ @KSoltisAnderson I mean, plus the whole Coronavirus-hitting-the-campaign and them going completely dark thing. That will be ancient history in a week or two.
1313876403151134722 2020-10-08 00:18:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Guys, remember that tonight is the 2nd PRESIDENTIAL debate. @VP is filling in for @realDonaldTrump who is out due to Coronavirus.
1313875384052613120 2020-10-08 00:14:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KSoltisAnderson National poll. I'll worry when they poll MI and PA.
1313874509221502988 2020-10-08 00:11:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews Everybody school choice, but Dems and teachers' unions have been blocking it for years. We must elect @realDonaldTrump and he must actually IMPLEMENT IT.
1313874247157243906 2020-10-08 00:10:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) Get your mitts off my face. B) Testing is crap. C) If it were possible to accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines any further, @realDonaldTrump would have already done it.
1313873921549258753 2020-10-08 00:08:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PostFomo @Rasmussen_Poll A) No. B) I don't need any. C) Who the hell are you?
1313873743303901184 2020-10-08 00:08:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Look guys, it will save you a lot of confusion and stress if you just realize that we are running against the media. Everything makes sense then.

1313867585717514240 2020-10-07 23:43:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BillOReilly found a way to make me like him again. INTO MY VEINS
1313866706494906368 2020-10-07 23:40:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They broke him.
1313848661017792512 2020-10-07 22:28:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He didn't. @SpeakerPelosi was intransigent and trying to steal money for completely unrelated things.
1313847889538568193 2020-10-07 22:25:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "good job engaging with the actual economic research on this subject buuuuuudddy" land then @dankois, whoever that is, blocked me. I actually live in the real world of daily business production. I'm not on the sidelines "researching" it.
1313846668798971911 2020-10-07 22:20:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Lies. There was never any standalone bill from Dems.
1313844380961329152 2020-10-07 22:11:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dankois @lizzieohreally Bullcrap. Employees slacking off doesn't generate returns, now or in the future. If they can't handle the job, replace them. They need to find part time work and not get paid for doing nothing.
1313843972557672453 2020-10-07 22:09:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @marklevinshow @benshapiro is a Never Trumper who is letting it happen. If the Dems win everything, it's on him.
1313843461569892353 2020-10-07 22:07:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dankois @lizzieohreally Some companies produce income, some focus on growth. Investors aren't putting their money somewhere where they aren't getting good returns with at least one of those.

1313842788786679810 2020-10-07 22:05:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Thought they were already publicly leaked.
1313842578492731392 2020-10-07 22:04:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dankois @lizzieohreally ..shareholders don't really "chill out" or not. They simply move their money to wherever they get the greatest return on investment. You would too.
1313842125851811840 2020-10-07 22:02:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dankois @lizzieohreally People have to eat. That's like saying "people should chill out on eating, living indoors, getting medical care". Many elderly people rely on investment income for retirement. No productivity no profit. No profit no dividends. You can't cheat work.
1313838638879444992 2020-10-07 21:48:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> New testament verse? I though she was Jewish.

1313837743341002752 2020-10-07 21:45:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why is the hell is no one talking about @realDonaldTrump returning to rallies? You can stand, all alone, up on a stage, VERY socially distanced from everyone else.
1313834917894205441 2020-10-07 21:33:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @lizzieohreally @dankois Bosses have their own bosses to answer to. That goes all the way up to the CEO, to the shareholders, and ultimately to the public. If you don't want to do the job, quit. There's no such thing as free money with no production.
1313834162441326592 2020-10-07 21:30:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll We get attacked by Antifa if we display any overt Trump support. So yeah, in a HUGE way.

1313829856627564544 2020-10-07 21:13:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. The absence of an action does not "harm" something. You can argue over whether stimulus is beneficial or the best use of taxpayer dollars, but government spending is not the default.
1313824213489328140 2020-10-07 20:51:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Clean as a whistle.
1313823250057756672 2020-10-07 20:47:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We all know.
1313822766680989697 2020-10-07 20:45:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump campaign needs to spend some money on ads. @JoeBiden is doing it.
1313822328648761350 2020-10-07 20:43:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Lies.
1313822036200955906 2020-10-07 20:42:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DShupie @JoeBiden Obviously, but these wishy washy Republicans in the middle keep falling for them.
1313821849676120066 2020-10-07 20:41:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 😂😂😂 Putin is the world's greatest troll.
1313820162118873088 2020-10-07 20:35:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why are you fools buying into the polls? They are obviously FAKE! Otherwise @JoeBiden wouldn't be campaigning in PA and MI.
1313817947534700544 2020-10-07 20:26:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They are not "erratic". They are common sense. #Idiots
1313816173167947777 2020-10-07 20:19:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sounds like you did it yourself.
1313815618236354560 2020-10-07 20:17:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HIPAA. All Presidents' medical records are sensitive. In fact all people's medical records are private. #Idiots
1313813620019662849 2020-10-07 20:09:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JStein_WaPo @BenjySarlin Right. There is no negotiation to be had. Pass the damn standalone bill or take responsibility for blocking it. Don't play petty political games to confiscate money for blue states.
1313812144903860231 2020-10-07 20:03:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SaintRPh Super smellers, at least.
1313810989159190528 2020-10-07 19:58:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr You know your dad is in charge of these organizations right? He can fire whoever he wants.
1313810508055801857 2020-10-07 19:56:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hilaria Clintonista strikes again. Still think she wasn't behind Epstein's death?
1313724738255155200 2020-10-07 14:16:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's been with like 10 different women and fathered kids by several of them. He's pretty much as alpha as they get, women flock to him.
1313723923092078592 2020-10-07 14:12:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JDRucker I'd like to see a red wedding. Everyone fired. Whole departments, eliminated. A COMPLETE reorganization and restructuring of the entire federal bureaucracy. Make it smaller and more efficient.
1313723067085062145 2020-10-07 14:09:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whatever else is happening in the campaign, one thing is for sure. @realDonaldTrump is inside their heads.
1313699389265907713 2020-10-07 12:35:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @yylow02 Tea Party time again. This time we can burn down government facilities I guess? New rules, apparently.
1313692737103855616 2020-10-07 12:08:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Better lock down forever and never do anything. HOW COULD YOU SCARIFICE PEOPLE TO THE FLU AND CAR CRASHES???
1313691991394471936 2020-10-07 12:05:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES! Move Wall St to Dallas!
1313687980918407170 2020-10-07 11:49:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jmartNYT @HotlineJosh McCain was crap but oh well say what you have to to win Arizona.
1313687565757820928 2020-10-07 11:48:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You wish. Polls are fake.
1313687080434794496 2020-10-07 11:46:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Did you know that there are a lot of people who have had Coronavirus and recovered?
1313684514456076288 2020-10-07 11:36:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He did no such thing. He asked for a stand alone bill to prove a point about corrupt @SpeakerPelosi and the Dems.
1313680759459401729 2020-10-07 11:21:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I mean at least @marwilliamson will be on board with ACB.
1313680301084864512 2020-10-07 11:19:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Holy crap @SenSasse is alive!
1313676538458632199 2020-10-07 11:04:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I would not oppose Oregon seceding. It can become a socialist hell hole and all the libs can move there.
1313676145825546240 2020-10-07 11:02:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MZHemingway RALLY TIME
1313675894674907137 2020-10-07 11:01:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara It's not hard. @SpeakerPelosi is trying to use the crisis to steal taxpayer money for Democrats, as usual. @realDonaldTrump is trying to help people.
1313664341581930496 2020-10-07 10:16:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ShadeandSun @CarlosTrastama1 @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump If you mean Wharton Business school, no, but any business school worth a lick of salt would teach you that.
1313663894133657604 2020-10-07 10:14:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> She's young. Of course she doesn't have any symptoms.
1313663610082734083 2020-10-07 10:13:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benshapiro @benshapiro if you really cared about stopping Dems you  would get the hell on board. Instead you're plotting how to save yourself if Trump loses.
1313662619362918401 2020-10-07 10:09:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CarlosTrastama1 @ShadeandSun @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump Hey guess what? In this day and age, I can delete you in the blink of an eye.
1313662203770351617 2020-10-07 10:07:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Blatant censorship. Facebook supports pedophilia.
1313661944319160320 2020-10-07 10:06:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CarlosTrastama1 @ShadeandSun @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump Obama's job creation in no way, shape, or form ever exceeded Trump's. Trump recovered the entire economy in a year. Obama dragged out a pathetic recovery for 8 years.
1313661676961619968 2020-10-07 10:05:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Polling is dead forever.
1313661598293266432 2020-10-07 10:05:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara They are way oversampling Dems. That's obvious from the rallies. And why the hell would people still be doing registered voters rather than likely voters at this point?
1313660812180033536 2020-10-07 10:01:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's actually on NeverTrumper cowards like @benshapiro.
1313660358687629313 2020-10-07 10:00:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @CarlosTrastama1 @ShadeandSun @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump You're not really in debt if you have more assets than liabilities. Growth! The second statement is ridiculous pedantry.
1313657684726513665 2020-10-07 09:49:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FREAKING TURN OUT PEOPLE! Unless you want another decade of complete Democrat control and a dead America.
1313655162586705920 2020-10-07 09:39:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump @MZHemingway You act, dude. You're the one running. What do you want out there? TWEET IT NOW
1313654884869312513 2020-10-07 09:38:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @emzanotti It's anti-Christian bigotry.
1313654602634584064 2020-10-07 09:37:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I feel like the writers are slacking this season. We need drama, innocence, horror, love, disgust! All we're getting is petty squabbling.
1313653223480340482 2020-10-07 09:31:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Which is...? So you're not voting at all?
1313652687402086406 2020-10-07 09:29:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL who?
1313652204289523712 2020-10-07 09:27:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara LOL I can't keep up man. Are you for Trump or against him?
1313651728684904448 2020-10-07 09:25:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ShadeandSun @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump Canada is a barnacle on the butt of the US. They leech off of us.
1313651566918930436 2020-10-07 09:25:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Belisarian @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump Some of them, no. Why they need to leave.
1313651461545439233 2020-10-07 09:24:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ShadeandSun @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump I've been paying attention to the economy, which was exponentially better.
1313651317630529541 2020-10-07 09:24:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tedcruz &gt; @mcuban. You're playing with fire, Mark. WRONG PARTY
1313650940549967872 2020-10-07 09:22:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell?
1313650597594357760 2020-10-07 09:21:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ShadeandSun @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump Uhh... yes. Those things require confiscatory taxes, the death of business, and starvation wages.
1313650220442570758 2020-10-07 09:19:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tdn451 Judges.
1313650134086025216 2020-10-07 09:19:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @realDonaldTrump Well then nobody would care, because they'd be powerless. I doubt America will give Dems full control, especially with as weak a leader as @JoeBiden. I still think the polls are absolute BS.
1313649812152160257 2020-10-07 09:18:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes. We will lead and they can choose to follow or not.
1313649606107049986 2020-10-07 09:17:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @2CynicAl65 @ScotsFyre Exactly. Lockdowns were supposed to be to prevent hospitals from overflowing. Lockdowns now? A joke!
1313649126786174978 2020-10-07 09:15:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell?
1313648791376015360 2020-10-07 09:14:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We need a full staff in the west wing. Either buck up and risk COVID, or let someone else do your job.
1313648276911067142 2020-10-07 09:12:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Senate Republicans better PRAY @realDonaldTrump wins re-election. Otherwise its just them alone, facing the mob.
1313648050523516928 2020-10-07 09:11:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why. The. Hell. Are. They. Still. Polling. Registered. Voters???
1313647678966968320 2020-10-07 09:09:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @2CynicAl65 @ScotsFyre I work at a hospital with 10 floors of patients. Only the end of one hall on the 6th floor is reserved for Coronavirus quarantine. A few rooms. I never hear about anyone hospitalized for it.
1313647267333705731 2020-10-07 09:08:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh blow it out your cornhole Creepy Joe.
1313647080162955270 2020-10-07 09:07:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @wsteaks @maggieNYT Journos next. Who gets the last laugh now?
1313645861294034950 2020-10-07 09:02:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What a joke! Polls are garbage.
1313645395235532800 2020-10-07 09:00:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT Maybe just keep @realDonaldTrump on dexamethasone for the rest of the election.
1313645181313445888 2020-10-07 08:59:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Someone's getting closer...
1313644260672049152 2020-10-07 08:56:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ACB is legitimate and she'll be on the court long after you're gone.
1313643828763557895 2020-10-07 08:54:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KMCRadio @GOP This would be the best case scenario for Republicans. You've got some states on there that are a reach though. NM, WI, MN.
1313643317364744192 2020-10-07 08:52:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden should go ahead and skip all the debates. In fact, he should just drop out and let Trump debate Harris.
1313643100271783941 2020-10-07 08:51:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Appeal to SCOTUS after ACB is seated.
1313642311163826177 2020-10-07 08:48:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump October surprise!
1313641623327211526 2020-10-07 08:45:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Twitter is stupid. Keep calm and vote @realDonaldTrump.
1313639895190188034 2020-10-07 08:38:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chuckwoolery What the hell does "bringing us together", "coming together" mean anyway? Does it mean giving up traditional religious beliefs? Abandoning conservative values? Jettisoning freedom &amp; individual liberties? Embracing communism? "Coming together" is very dangerous and I'm against it.
1313637885535453186 2020-10-07 08:30:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because @SpeakerPelosi has not been serious about these negotiations from the beginning.
1313637288895799297 2020-10-07 08:28:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He'll work for his Chinese paymasters. And @HillaryClinton. And Antifa.)
1313636761336197121 2020-10-07 08:26:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I want ZERO part of any "coming together" with Antifa and the left.
1313636298972901376 2020-10-07 08:24:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @charliekirk11 @chuckwoolery Corrupt as hell.
1313636181117202435 2020-10-07 08:24:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> About done with the Obamas and their lies. They can take their racism and shove it.
1313635665062572038 2020-10-07 08:22:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) Trump won't have Coronavirus B) What is he scared of?
1313635278372958208 2020-10-07 08:20:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL chicken!
1313623866309308418 2020-10-07 07:35:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The owner of the property I'd imagine.
1313623402628907009 2020-10-07 07:33:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KMCRadio A bit bullish, but possible I suppose. I have a scenario in which Trump wins Michigan but loses Arizona, winning 270-268.
1313622623503425536 2020-10-07 07:30:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democratic cash grabs to cover for failed leadership are... not that.
1313622080743788545 2020-10-07 07:28:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yikes! Take your guns and move to Texas y'all.
1313621850291830785 2020-10-07 07:27:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There is no "government" with a pot of gold just waiting, trying to help you but for Trump. The government is us. Taking our own money to give it back to us (sans a sizeable fee) is a gimmick.
1313621121225326593 2020-10-07 07:24:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ColumbiaBugle I mean he's part of, or plays footsie with, the hackstablishment.
1313620352833064963 2020-10-07 07:21:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Then quit with the collectivist climate change bullcrap.
1313620049840795650 2020-10-07 07:20:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I have absolutely HAD IT with all the leftist ghouls rejoicing that another Trump admin member has Coronavirus and hoping that he dies. These disgusting pukes are not my countrymen.
1313617380870885377 2020-10-07 07:09:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> *eyeroll* This guy. 47 years and he's never done a thing, and the climate is just fine.
1313616752782254080 2020-10-07 07:06:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheRightScoop @realDonaldTrump is running against actors in the media, as usual.
1313616449198579712 2020-10-07 07:05:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RedEaglePatriot @tress777 @realDonaldTrump really has to get back out there as soon as humanly possible. I don't care if it's a 15 minute speech, sitting in a chair, whatever. Campaign!
1313616067923791873 2020-10-07 07:04:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No. People need to get off their asses and get back to work.
1313615565261545474 2020-10-07 07:02:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Terrible.
1313615118631133191 2020-10-07 07:00:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Polls don't matter if one side doesn't show up to vote and the other does.
1313614601842499584 2020-10-07 06:58:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? That was the best video.

1313537982775857152 2020-10-07 01:53:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara You mean HDS? Cause Biden won't be around for long.
1313537783601004544 2020-10-07 01:53:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @PolitiBunny Steroids are given to prevent inflammation. What kind of doctor is this guy?

1313524831401451521 2020-10-07 01:01:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Worked for @realDonaldTrump. RELEASE IT TO THE PUBLIC
1313524274200805378 2020-10-07 00:59:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EpochTimes That's literally how every single virus works. After you recover, your body has anti-bodies and you are immune.
1313522490296201217 2020-10-07 00:52:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Polls are not getting worse for Trump. The media is taking advantage of his illness to push a narrative.
1313522246548443136 2020-10-07 00:51:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @prageru @thewillwitt LOL now the only not racist thing to do is to become a racist and proudly admit it? *head spinning*
1313521281678094337 2020-10-07 00:47:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you think that raising tax rates on the middle class will improve your lot in life, you are sorely mistaken. They will cease to work as hard for you and your situation will become worse.
1313520981881823235 2020-10-07 00:46:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "International oversight" is moral? What the hell is this guy smoking?
1313520349879861249 2020-10-07 00:43:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @justinamash Stop lying then.
1313520267344449538 2020-10-07 00:43:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Globalists always crouching at the door. Got to fight them back!
1313519876179451906 2020-10-07 00:41:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What if Republicans rioted in the street and burned down government buildings and agencies if Biden won? Would that be seen as bad?
1313517105594142724 2020-10-07 00:30:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ever think that maybe some moms *WANT* some time off to care for and comfort their kids in the middle of a global pandemic? Let the men risk their lives at work.
1313516752861626375 2020-10-07 00:29:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Twitter lying about what @realDonaldTrump TRUTHFULLY said, as usual.
1313516047799070721 2020-10-07 00:26:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stephen_taylor @ComfortablySmug Young girls lip syncing old dudes is funny. Not the other way around.
1313515250667397121 2020-10-07 00:23:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We desperately need a @realDonaldTrump live rally. If it's possible, schedule one for Friday. Keep him up on stage away from everyone, but let him speak. .@JasonMillerinDC
1313511763850264577 2020-10-07 00:09:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @FormerlyCBM The President was out like what, 5 days? Sounds like the flu.
1313511540100825091 2020-10-07 00:08:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shocker.
1313511371070468096 2020-10-07 00:08:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NBA ratings are way down and it's clearly hitting @mcuban in the pocketbook. He's rattled.
1313511091884957699 2020-10-07 00:07:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What the hell is the point of a stimulus if everybody is locked down? Won't stimulate anything! Pick one, Dems.
1313501847605383168 2020-10-06 23:30:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If I could sum up this election in one sentence, it would be "do not listen to the Siren song of the media"
1313501123983138816 2020-10-06 23:27:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tedcruz My future depends on Democrats losing, as it does for most of us.
1313500150443147264 2020-10-06 23:23:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews Guess it's the fault of everyone in America who caught it that they have it.
1313499964019015681 2020-10-06 23:22:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wow. Patient blaming is the very worst form of evil in this country. If you've ever been a victim of it, you know.
1313499757600485381 2020-10-06 23:22:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher Why would progressives support @JoeBiden? He's more regressive than @realDonaldTrump.
1313499296159932419 2020-10-06 23:20:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fact check: false. Defeating disease, and in fact life itself, often depends on the willingness of the patient to fight for it.
1313499013610692609 2020-10-06 23:19:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stevengberman @resurgent @TheFirstonTV Promising new channel, but begs the question... the first of what?
1313498479017234436 2020-10-06 23:16:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec LOL he should slide in like "you're really amazing! Don't you think you should be president instead of Biden?"
1313498214822277123 2020-10-06 23:15:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @cnn put it out, it's not a poll. It's propaganda.
1313497940279910409 2020-10-06 23:14:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "absurd"
1313497648268181507 2020-10-06 23:13:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I thought @realDonaldTrump was the germophobe? He's turned the media into gibbering hypochondriacs!
1313497460283768832 2020-10-06 23:12:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I have some bad news. There are viruses and bacteria all around you everywhere you go. FREAK OUT!

1313475261590122496 2020-10-06 21:44:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not misleading at all. Do you deny that the mortality rate is the same?

1313458684899536896 2020-10-06 20:38:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't WANT to "come together" with Antifa and the left. I want to SHUT THEM DOWN.

1313457837268439041 2020-10-06 20:35:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews Creepy Jim Crow @JoeBiden has to be tanking with women and minorities.
1313457427153661953 2020-10-06 20:33:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Even JPMORGAN knows the polls are faked.

1313455643194462211 2020-10-06 20:26:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Polls are fake - Dems drastically oversampled.
1313363229419204608 2020-10-06 14:19:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Cops should shoot when their lives are threatened.
1313361716504334339 2020-10-06 14:13:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm at the point where I'm sick of Dems and their dumb kiddie games. Y'all want to vote for a doddering corrupt old fool like @JoeBiden, go ahead, get it over with. I'm voting for @realDonaldTrump and history will show that I was correct.
1313342659063418882 2020-10-06 12:57:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScottJW @RealKiraDavis I guess @realDonaldTrump won't bring it up, for obvious reasons (Stormy Daniels, etc)
1313339136552689666 2020-10-06 12:43:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MollyRatty Although, pure democracy should always be under threat and in fact destroyed. Here in America, we have a representative, Republican form of government where the rights of individuals are protected by a Constitution.

1313327774082510849 2020-10-06 11:58:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BobbieD78585843 @conservmillen Yes we were. Conservatives were hated, ostracized, slandered as racists, evil, selfish, etc etc etc
1313301781775089664 2020-10-06 10:15:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @benshapiro A VERY good candidate for monoclonal antibodies. Best genes in the country to get where he's gotten.

1313295630220038151 2020-10-06 09:50:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You too can go to the Mayo clinic or wherever if you feel like it.
1313294982086877185 2020-10-06 09:48:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's what he hasn't said. Like condenming Antifa or supporting law &amp; order. Also, you know, being a perfectly loyal #2 in a socialist administration.
1313294655333838848 2020-10-06 09:47:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @scrowder LOL yeah I figured

1313263647674847232 2020-10-06 07:43:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I know a guy that had it months ago, recovered, is back at work, and still tests positive.

1313257759585038338 2020-10-06 07:20:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @conservmillen It's like we weren't even allowed to think conservative thoughts or express them in public before. The veil has been lifted!
1313257331606642688 2020-10-06 07:18:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Polls were, and are, rising. For the first time several showed him up over Biden nationally.)
1313257058553286656 2020-10-06 07:17:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SaintRPh It can be controlled. You just have to be careful to be conscious of it. Emotions are powerful forces and not always connected to the rational part of your brain.
1313256550664933376 2020-10-06 07:15:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's not "infected". He's "recovered".
1313256445471854594 2020-10-06 07:15:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GOP "Let me tell you what I'm gonna do, America. I'm going to accept it into my body, and my killer T-cells are going to DESTROY that virus. I will personally make antibodies for you with my own body."
1313256097571123205 2020-10-06 07:13:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "200,000 people died" should be rated mostly false. 200,000 people died, yes. Way more than that die every year. They were mostly very old or gravely ill patients. Coronavirus did not have a very big impact.
1313255605952544785 2020-10-06 07:11:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump PLEASE have @IvankaTrump there or someone in the audience to give you cues. Roids can do weird things to your emotions in a debate.

1313252777959849986 2020-10-06 07:00:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The absolute arrogance combined with utter ignorance. Pride goeth before a fall. Mommas, don't let your babies grown to be Steve Schmidts.

1313140438287646722 2020-10-05 23:34:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SeanTrende @Neoavatara But it still impacts profits, which impacts the success or failure of businesses nationwide.
1313138938933108736 2020-10-05 23:28:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Can..  can you just quit your never Trumping for just a sec here?
1313138574120890370 2020-10-05 23:26:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> During @realDonaldTrump's ENTIRE CORONAVIRUS ILLNESS he campaigned MORE THAN @JoeBiden every day! Vote Trump.
1313120901349736449 2020-10-05 22:16:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tobydoyhowell It's redistributionary. Forces people not to hoard cash but pump it back into the economy.
1313118883549773826 2020-10-05 22:08:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. This is progressive BS. The Christian church has lasted for two millenia. Judaism has existed since the beginning of human history.
1313116939187822593 2020-10-05 22:00:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good. We don't need Marxism in north Tulsa, we need a Trump opportunity zone!
1313116417533804545 2020-10-05 21:58:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @anish_koka You only need 10mg a day to fully replace your body's natural cortisol production.
1313103363542839296 2020-10-05 21:06:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump should take a hit  of dexamethasone before each rally. 😂
1313101081170382853 2020-10-05 20:57:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Remember you're on the equivalent of speed, dude. Use it to get a lot done.
1313100319203655680 2020-10-05 20:54:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHA yeah some truth to that
1313099994644316160 2020-10-05 20:53:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Eeeeexactly. We are fighting China at the bottom of all this.
1313098510598836228 2020-10-05 20:47:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How did these cowardly little wusses ever get such important positions in the government?
1313097482243584003 2020-10-05 20:43:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whoo boy that's a 12 on the hypocrisy scale!
1312982747980484608 2020-10-05 13:07:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hey you stole my tweet.
1312981754270154752 2020-10-05 13:03:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent you can confirm ACB.
1312981420932034562 2020-10-05 13:02:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Elke1983 Think about it. It's a puzzle.
1312951255703187457 2020-10-05 11:02:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh calm down. He wasn't "hospitalized" as if they carried him out on a stretcher. He walked in out of an abundance of caution.
1312950912869167104 2020-10-05 11:01:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) Not really other than making you super active and irritable. Like speed. B) Your mind was probably messed with because of, you know, brain surgery. C) He won't be "incapacitated". He may be low energy. But he has an unusually high amount of it to begin with.
1312950454628868097 2020-10-05 10:59:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ACB, the election, unhinged liberals, Merrick Garland (may he rest in peace)... there are lots of reasons.
1312949880332193793 2020-10-05 10:56:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's dumb. I mean unless they actually demolish them, someone will buy them in a year or so and start right back up again.
1312949473593692160 2020-10-05 10:55:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> China literally tried to assassinate our president.
1312949196832624642 2020-10-05 10:54:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL sure. It's not like he can't keep taking it.
1312949024073363456 2020-10-05 10:53:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL the media is projecting their fear that @realDonaldTrump will recovery quickly and win the election.
1312948804962988032 2020-10-05 10:52:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's possible?
1312939955598041088 2020-10-05 10:17:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @mzee26 @TwitchyTeam Not religious enough. Divorced. New York but it's too blue. Florida?

1312939504349712386 2020-10-05 10:15:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So you're saying there's a chance.
1312939082184564736 2020-10-05 10:14:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @yashar Why is she called "Dr. Biden"? She's not a doctor. Some academic BS?
1312938260344307714 2020-10-05 10:10:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He's driving them insane.)
1312938124285284353 2020-10-05 10:10:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Funny, was there maybe some other reason for it? #Idiots
1312937647233474561 2020-10-05 10:08:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Does anybody? You go to a doctor, go to a hospital. It's not complicated.
1312937455025377281 2020-10-05 10:07:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oooh free? Well in that case...
1312916294728142849 2020-10-05 08:43:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews Democrats never care about bimbo eruptions.
1312915124827676672 2020-10-05 08:38:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's coming for you, @JoeBiden. Hide in your basement forever.
1312914497728905218 2020-10-05 08:36:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nothing the left loves more than locking people down and ruining lives.
1312913576546512899 2020-10-05 08:32:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Me.
1312913495768399872 2020-10-05 08:32:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The left loves to fantasize about controlling other people and locking them down. FREEEEEDOM!
1312913175944232972 2020-10-05 08:31:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets Dirty little secret is that the polls are completely faked and Trump is a hair away from winning it.
1312899604426436608 2020-10-05 07:37:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh I can top that. Wait until he recovers *and Biden gets COVID*.
1312899235101147136 2020-10-05 07:35:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody cares, Karen.
1312897807234355200 2020-10-05 07:30:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The key question though is whether he will denounce white supremacy.
1312897370057658368 2020-10-05 07:28:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeSilverman7 @AsheSchow IDK about that one specifically but weaning off of corticosteroids in general really sucks. I've done it numerous times.
1312896755000897538 2020-10-05 07:25:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nobody is really going to bother to do that either.
1312896163465564161 2020-10-05 07:23:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher You know damn well the polls are fake. They sample way more Dems when based on the obvious enthusiasm gap, way more Republicans will turn out to vote.
1312895096044556290 2020-10-05 07:19:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And yet he's still beating Biden.
1312894975651336194 2020-10-05 07:18:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh oh spaghetti-o! If @JoeBiden has Coronavirus his already feeble health isn't going to handle it very well.
1312894501275525121 2020-10-05 07:16:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Elke1983 I know who did it, and why it happened.
1312877491208495104 2020-10-05 06:09:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHAHAHAHA YES!
1312877052912115712 2020-10-05 06:07:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets Liberal activist journos lying again as ususal.
1312876179247030277 2020-10-05 06:04:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Why is he quarantining?
1312874780488593410 2020-10-05 05:58:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> WOOOOHOOOO @realDonaldTrump beat Coronavirus in like 5 days!!!
1312868910979571713 2020-10-05 05:35:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hey Christians! Do you want pro-abortion judges? No? Then quit playing around and get behind Trump.
1312868141756821504 2020-10-05 05:32:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM

1312866816524517376 2020-10-05 05:26:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Please.
1312866721313816576 2020-10-05 05:26:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because it's a fake poll.
1312866057967874050 2020-10-05 05:23:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @_Drew_McCoy_ Yeah he'll have to stay socially distanced or be in some sort of a bubble.
1312865447042260992 2020-10-05 05:21:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YAAAAAASS!
1312856398942830592 2020-10-05 04:45:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The question is whether Biden will be able to make it.
1312855707272859649 2020-10-05 04:42:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's interesting how the real polls show up in international news... but are censored within the US.
1312855269970452480 2020-10-05 04:41:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Un. Stoppable.
1312851484229410822 2020-10-05 04:26:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> After all this is over, CHINA MUST PAY.
1312822051854483463 2020-10-05 02:29:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Here's the deal, guys. The race is at 47-46 Trump. It's anyone's game. The media wants you to think Biden is way up so undecideds will just go along with it. That's why they drastically oversample Dems in every poll they do.
1312821752792313862 2020-10-05 02:27:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He's done.)
1312819786221596674 2020-10-05 02:20:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fact check: true
1312819694022397952 2020-10-05 02:19:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Hopefully it makes him get really amped up at rallies.
1312819478279852033 2020-10-05 02:18:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jaketapper is despicable
1312818644406198273 2020-10-05 02:15:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Bencjacobs This really, really sucks. Steroids have side effects and they take a looong time to wean off of. Coming off of them really saps your energy. He either has to stay on them from now through the election, or he will not be on top of his game in the homestretch.
1312818056524189699 2020-10-05 02:13:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So racist.

1312765554739023876 2020-10-04 22:44:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1312765025073889283 2020-10-04 22:42:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We commit to no transfer of power at all, because Trump will win.
1312764900612112384 2020-10-04 22:41:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This. Polling is lying to create a narrative.
1312764742839275523 2020-10-04 22:41:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Rasmussen_Poll Even @Rasmussen_Poll is unfairly skewed towards Dems, especially given the enthusiasm gap. @realDonaldTrump is winning.
1312764312012967937 2020-10-04 22:39:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The left is free to unite with us to put our country first any time they choose.

1312757062665990146 2020-10-04 22:10:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BiasedGirl Polls don't matter. Turnout matters. This is a base election and all the enthusiasm is on Trump's side.
1312756633467002881 2020-10-04 22:09:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @khnfri @noahsmom7 No but at least we can beat up on journos when they lie to us.
1312745644793253888 2020-10-04 21:25:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Please. A poll just yesterday had Biden up only two. Any poll from @NBCNews is going to be fake.
1312744212140634112 2020-10-04 21:19:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara He's certainly never hoped Biden would get it. He's far more civil than the riotous left.
1312738342254129155 2020-10-04 20:56:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Why did Scavino block me?
1312737685149188096 2020-10-04 20:53:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If I hear one more Dem (or Republican) talk about "coming together", I swear... I don't want to "come together" with the left. I want them to leave me the hell alone!
1312631938386018305 2020-10-04 13:53:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you represented me you would reject collectivism, embrace freedom, drop out and endorse Trump. And put America before China.

1312617997547311110 2020-10-04 12:58:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze The first woman president should be a successful businesswoman. No relying on "funding" for stuff. "Give me all your crap" is not a sustainable method of governance.

1312281319087501314 2020-10-03 14:40:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Agreed. Vote immediately.
1312281180490924033 2020-10-03 14:39:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Biden is not the President of the United States. There is a respect for the office.

1312248656314224641 2020-10-03 12:30:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec These Antifa people are so narcissistic. They don't understand that power is only given by the consent of the governed. And we do not consent to be ruled by their bratty asses.

1312237524639776768 2020-10-03 11:46:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He'll probably get sick from the side effects of all these treatments, not Coronavirus lol
1312237260285374464 2020-10-03 11:45:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher Sure we can do that. Cocaine Mitch doesn't miss.

1312201049604722689 2020-10-03 09:21:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well that's it folks. I guess because Trump got Coronavirus, we now have to give the government, China, and Joe Biden control of everything.
1312194640901095424 2020-10-03 08:55:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh huh.

1312193366562500610 2020-10-03 08:50:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ChadPergram This is dumb. Tests are way too sensitive. Many people test positive, but few get sick.
1312192496055668736 2020-10-03 08:47:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Then he'll go to the floor, vote, and leave. Or wait till he recovers. Or whatever. I can promise you this though, ACB will be on that bench before the election.
1312192108405551104 2020-10-03 08:45:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> After this @realDonaldTrump is really going to want to punish China.
1312191794960986112 2020-10-03 08:44:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is going to metaphorically rise from the dead to save America.

1312158506758283264 2020-10-03 06:32:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Gang of Eight? What the hell does immigration have to do with it?
1312158275673104385 2020-10-03 06:31:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why would they?
1312155940003606528 2020-10-03 06:22:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @mlakan Why famotidine?
1312155559903150080 2020-10-03 06:20:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug Yeah but you say that every day - you just got lucky.
1312155107987865601 2020-10-03 06:18:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh come on. Space them out more then. Although if @Mike_Pence is acting president by then, would he debate @JoeBiden instead?
1312154788000227328 2020-10-03 06:17:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL @realDonaldTrump should stay in that hospital for a while.
1312154573323202560 2020-10-03 06:16:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SeanTrende @benshapiro Yeah... why doesn't he take the proven treatments?
1312154306007560193 2020-10-03 06:15:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chuckwoolery Why is everyone running this country like a billion years old?
1312154011877867520 2020-10-03 06:14:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Glad that you're conceding and supporting @realDonaldTrump.
1312153360661770242 2020-10-03 06:11:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump wins again, even as he is dying.
1312152747551064066 2020-10-03 06:09:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Where's @Mike_Pence?
1312147330859114496 2020-10-03 05:47:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @_Drew_McCoy_ I mean if Trump died...
1312146167455596547 2020-10-03 05:43:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher I'm sure the left does.
1312145781248253953 2020-10-03 05:41:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 👀
1312145236051726336 2020-10-03 05:39:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh no. Is he not taking hydroxychloroquine, zinc, Remdesivir, convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, etc?
1312144899639140353 2020-10-03 05:38:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This weekend is going to be very bad.
1312144617853186049 2020-10-03 05:37:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Getting worse. Military on high alert. I hope @Mike_Pence is ready for this.
1312111875602018304 2020-10-03 03:27:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When Democrats say "democracy" they mean "socialism", not "capitalism". They are lazy and would prefer to take other people's stuff instead of working and improving themselves.
1312101901933010946 2020-10-03 02:47:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The great thing though is that once Trump recovers he will be immune and can campaign, in person, to his heart's content. Kissing babies and such. Joe can't.
1312101217691074560 2020-10-03 02:44:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So he won't be calling the lid at 7am instead of 8am?
1312100353664401408 2020-10-03 02:41:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM
1312100074491535360 2020-10-03 02:40:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM
1312099778797334529 2020-10-03 02:38:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> At long last
1312099327104360449 2020-10-03 02:37:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell is this censorship? Let QAnon speak! Judging by @SpeakerPelosi's reaction, they're on to something and they've hit a neve.
1312098914409959425 2020-10-03 02:35:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ACB will be confirmed and you are powerless to do anything about it
1312098793966329856 2020-10-03 02:35:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealMiniAOC If there's one thing that @realDonaldTrump loves, it's to be cast as the underdog, a fighter.
1312098454873595904 2020-10-03 02:33:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec QAnon is the protest movement against elites and their Satanic pedophilia / sex trafficking rings. So of course everyone in government opposes it.
1312098104309551104 2020-10-03 02:32:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ****ing elites
1312097841326813184 2020-10-03 02:31:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec The hell? Coronavirus disqualifies you for the presidency?
1312077180621459456 2020-10-03 01:09:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @michellemalkin It is really shameful the the House would so fully back Epstein's demonic sex trafficking ring.
1312076262219886592 2020-10-03 01:05:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> About right. He's coming down with it right now.
1312076070708015104 2020-10-03 01:04:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES
1312076022779703296 2020-10-03 01:04:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh man.
1312075706164293632 2020-10-03 01:03:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Perfect.
1312075547300823040 2020-10-03 01:02:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So... with @realDonaldTrump under the weather and @JoeBiden calling lids every day... is the election canceled?
1312075094643048448 2020-10-03 01:00:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Elites gonna elite. They're ALL doing Epstein stuff.
1312075003626696716 2020-10-03 01:00:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damn Democrats protecting @BillClinton and @HillaryClinton's demonic sex trafficking ring.
1312051689244033025 2020-10-02 23:27:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Definitely. Although they are having some symptoms, so its probably right.
1312050520601890817 2020-10-02 23:23:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Is he symptomatic?
1312045879105388545 2020-10-02 23:04:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nice!
1312045542676070402 2020-10-02 23:03:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES... he was being groomed anyway. He's trained and ready to go. Sub him in!
1312045226018705408 2020-10-02 23:02:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chuckwoolery They have to have *some* reason for people to vote against him, or he'd be a slam dunk.
1312045130984108032 2020-10-02 23:01:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sad. Why not just get all the Trump kids together to continue the rallies? @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump
1312041203408474115 2020-10-02 22:46:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The debate did not help creepy @JoeBiden with women.
1312039913387368448 2020-10-02 22:41:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SquawkCNBC @ScottGottliebMD If they withhold hydroxychloroquine + zinc from the president... lawsuits.
1312039415787728898 2020-10-02 22:39:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Reversion to traditional gender roles?
1312038867231543298 2020-10-02 22:36:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is the President of the United States. Surely he has the best treatments in the world available to him? Can't they just load him up with antibodies from convalescent plasma and knock it out?
1312037784241213440 2020-10-02 22:32:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec ...and tax returns, and all the other crap.
1312037580746129408 2020-10-02 22:31:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TomFitton Is @realDonaldTrump taking hydroxychloroquine?
1312036826350223362 2020-10-02 22:28:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher And if it turns out to be no worse than the flu he'll be proven correct.
1312036426066939909 2020-10-02 22:27:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RyanAFournier Par for the course, given the number of people @HillaryClinton has killed. Foster, Stevens, Epstein...
1312036154359898112 2020-10-02 22:26:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Very true.
1312036057538539520 2020-10-02 22:25:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Don Jr?
1312035618831175688 2020-10-02 22:24:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews He's a hell of an actor then. That Minnesota rally...
1312035440451612673 2020-10-02 22:23:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL was that member @MittRomney?
1312035337758224384 2020-10-02 22:22:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @adamliaw Impossible though. Trump has already nominated ACB. Once the Senate confirms, it's a done deal.
1312035199442661376 2020-10-02 22:22:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dark days for America.
1312034973755543553 2020-10-02 22:21:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh no. China is assassinating our leadership. And Joe is in cahoots with them. Awful!
1312034706553286657 2020-10-02 22:20:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump did it again. No one is talking about his tax returns now.
1312034607299207169 2020-10-02 22:20:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He didn't actually "go into" crowds. He was standing alone at a podium with no one within 50 feet of him.)
1312034365988274178 2020-10-02 22:19:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't care if we all have to wear football helmets as long as we open up the economy.
1312017864505917440 2020-10-02 21:13:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yes, that's mild.
1312017542261637120 2020-10-02 21:12:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Mike_Pence @realDonaldTrump ...his agenda, eh? Not the man himself?
1312017167748083712 2020-10-02 21:10:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Lakecrazy @realDonaldTrump Of course they'll accuse him of hiding in his basement now.
1312016889548341248 2020-10-02 21:09:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @khnfri About him getting elected more than beating it. But he is fairly old which puts him at higher risk.
1312016266702532614 2020-10-02 21:07:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When is the vice presidential debate? Takes on added significance.
1312012049724190720 2020-10-02 20:50:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Your reminder that @JoeBiden wants to shut everything down, heavily tax the lower classes, and drive unemployment to 100%, killing us all.
1312011224478109696 2020-10-02 20:47:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ack, right now is when we need @realDonaldTrump to crow about the jobs report.
1312010988787466243 2020-10-02 20:46:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I think we're done with that.
1312007365424807938 2020-10-02 20:31:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If he has it, does the simulation crash?
1312006069703581697 2020-10-02 20:26:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well no, it means that the most connected man in the world is at risk of getting it.
1312005564206133248 2020-10-02 20:24:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Awful. They did this to him!
1312005023900012545 2020-10-02 20:22:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ghouls.
1312003960107139077 2020-10-02 20:18:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews If the working class votes for @JoeBiden, they've done it to themselves and they deserve what they get. Looking at you, Pennsylvania.
1312003357448507392 2020-10-02 20:15:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JenniferJJacobs @LauraLitvan @realDonaldTrump is never fatigued. So I guess he's symptomatic. But isn't that supposed to take weeks to develop?  He couldn't have just gotten it from Hope Hicks.
1312002916329418752 2020-10-02 20:14:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Unless he beats it and turns that to his advantage.
1312002620769406977 2020-10-02 20:12:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Mike_Pence preparing to assume the presidency should the president become incapacitated.
1312001845926256645 2020-10-02 20:09:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They're gonna make Trump lose by forcing him to quarantine. He should at least be all over TV every day from home.
1312000943630823425 2020-10-02 20:06:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This could be a dirty campaign trick. If he is asymptomatic he should continue to campaign, socially distanced.
1312000466151256064 2020-10-02 20:04:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why? Ridiculous. Trump nominated her, his role is done.
1312000252841463811 2020-10-02 20:03:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT @jmartNYT @ByMattStevens "Testing positive" does not necessarily mean he will get sick. Does he have any symptoms yet and is he taking hydroxychloroquine?
1311999712401264642 2020-10-02 20:01:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hell yeah.
1311999491541790720 2020-10-02 20:00:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews Does... does she think those are the same thing? No he is not racist, but he is DEFINITELY against anti-Americans like @IlhanMN.
1311999025122508802 2020-10-02 19:58:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaaang what if they both have it?
1311998757567954944 2020-10-02 19:57:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScotsFyre He should continue to do rallies. Just make sure no one is within 100 feet of the stage. Tests are super sensitive.
1311998306529275909 2020-10-02 19:55:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TulsiGabbard @RealSaavedra @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS There are a few Democrats left who aren't ghouls, but they are out of favor with the party.
1311997996717010944 2020-10-02 19:54:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara ACB must be confirmed IMMEDIATELY to deal with any Constitutional crises.
1311997511364739072 2020-10-02 19:52:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What if @JoeBiden keeps calling lids because *he* has Coronavirus too?
1311997111395811329 2020-10-02 19:51:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We are in the middle of a hostile take over by China. They are trying to kill our America first president.
1311996632993542144 2020-10-02 19:49:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stevengberman Heh that would actually be entertaining. "Guys I'm vomiting, brb" The full play by play of Coronavirus.
1311995954623639552 2020-10-02 19:46:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Confirmed: @JoeBiden will crush the US economy.
1311995783181414401 2020-10-02 19:45:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @lifeisscool @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden LOL having the campaign trail all to himself won't help. He can't get away with calling lids any more. People will see how bad he is.
1311915550394720257 2020-10-02 14:26:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There's an outside chance that this actually softens @realDonaldTrump's image and helps him with suburban women. We need to thing long and hard about what actually happens to our country if @JoeBiden wins.
1311912382462128129 2020-10-02 14:14:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nice! There's the off chance that someone tampered with the test too. If he feels good, @realDonaldTrump should keep doing rallies! You're like 100 ft away from everyone up on stage.
1311911610340999169 2020-10-02 14:11:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sounds downright conservative here.
1311905193940877317 2020-10-02 13:45:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So don't do another $2 trillion stimulus.
1311904580255576066 2020-10-02 13:43:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Designated survivor.
1311904183071670272 2020-10-02 13:41:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @nytimes still attacking him. Disgusting!
1311904029476376576 2020-10-02 13:41:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (They know @JoeBiden will crush the economy.)
1311903888644112384 2020-10-02 13:40:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh dang if @JoeBiden got it at the debate after all that hiding in the basement...
1311903719487832065 2020-10-02 13:39:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh come on. I mean obviously we're over the worst hump.
1311903475618414593 2020-10-02 13:38:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> See guys? It matters to the economy.
1311903330579484674 2020-10-02 13:38:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Mike_Pence buddy, this is your time. Make us proud and do right by the President. Unless you have it too.
1311903101964738565 2020-10-02 13:37:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It still is, if you look at the numbers, treatments, progress toward a vaccine, etc. Trump is just the most connected man in America.
1311902709876916225 2020-10-02 13:35:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It makes you realize what a weight @realDonaldTrump was carrying for all of us. America's cheerleader. *eagle tears dot gif*
1311902542226436097 2020-10-02 13:35:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> About sums it up.
1311902029871288320 2020-10-02 13:33:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @poniewozik What will really been crazy is when Biden and Harris test positive, despite all the basement hiding.
1311901879627124736 2020-10-02 13:32:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JenniferJJacobs Was @seanhannity exposed?
1311901747590369280 2020-10-02 13:32:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT He cut the Minnesota rally way short. Clearly stuff was going down.
1311901258329055234 2020-10-02 13:30:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TippingOddsLV @MelissaTweets Nevada, Minnesota were both in play. Now we'll see.
1311901113717850112 2020-10-02 13:29:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whoa. I just realized. If @realDonaldTrump becomes incapacitated... @Mike_Pence will be the acting President!
1311900862265032705 2020-10-02 13:28:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's too bad in times like this that we can't have a country that supports our President, especially given all that he's done for us.
1311900593720635393 2020-10-02 13:27:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If Trump dies from this he will be a martyr and an American hero.
1311900280699727872 2020-10-02 13:26:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoshNBCNews Gives him enough time to recover, but barely.
1311900032027758592 2020-10-02 13:25:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Get @DonaldJTrumpJr and @IvankaTrump tested immediately. They're going to have to carry on the rallies. Have all the kids at the same one.
1311899719824740353 2020-10-02 13:24:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What if @realDonaldTrump recovers in 2-3 weeks and then @JoeBiden gets it?
1311899337467850752 2020-10-02 13:22:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So sad. China won. A generation of American prosperity eliminated. With only a month to go in the election. Utter disaster.
1311899112858673152 2020-10-02 13:21:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara What if Trump tries to give Biden Coronavirus on purpose?
1311898622108340224 2020-10-02 13:19:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I knew you weren't feeling it at the Minnesota rally. No wonder!
1311898444966100993 2020-10-02 13:18:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SherriMichaux @JoshNBCNews I think there's no way he would voluntarily give up the rallies. This could cost him the election.
1311898140631617537 2020-10-02 13:17:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoshNBCNews What if this is a stunt to win older voters (who he was losing)?
1311897924096405507 2020-10-02 13:16:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'd double check that this isn't some sort of hoax though. Just because you "test positive" doesn't mean you'll get sick.
1311897703845113856 2020-10-02 13:16:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Freaking cowardly little dips**t @JoeBiden is going to win now.
1311897514757558272 2020-10-02 13:15:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> My pastor got it, preached the next week, then was out for two. This is a disaster. He won't be able to do rallies.
1311897369353621504 2020-10-02 13:14:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaaang he finally got it. I guess they'll say Biden was right to hide in the basement.
1311897279050256386 2020-10-02 13:14:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh no! Melania too?
1311863699305570305 2020-10-02 11:00:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Mi_5Mo @EpochTimes Now if it could just bleed over into Pennsylvania... or Michigan... or Wisconsin. We just need ONE STATE.

1311860522569080840 2020-10-02 10:48:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EpochTimes Ohio is proving to be a strangely strong wall for Trump.
1311860101532315648 2020-10-02 10:46:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheRightScoop Do they ever ask him to condemn black supremacists? Native American supremacists? Asian supremacists? Island of Fiji supremacists? (No)
1311859233789538305 2020-10-02 10:43:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump could just start calling lids, no explanation given. Make @JoeBiden talk.
1311859002960216066 2020-10-02 10:42:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup. Put out on purpose as catnip for the left. I think Trump has Coronavirus.

1311856883163168769 2020-10-02 10:33:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec It's got to have been leaked on purpose to distract.
1311856715927875584 2020-10-02 10:33:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Coronavirus. Is. Over. #Blacklivesmatter and Antifa proved that looooong ago.

1311838006035337221 2020-10-02 09:18:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @yesh222 @Neoavatara I'd be MUCH more comfortable with Trump president and the Senate lost to Dems than vice versa. It would be 50-50 in the former situation, a weak rearguard action in the latter.
1311837450424246272 2020-10-02 09:16:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How... how did that help? Did he use the force?
1311836905852542976 2020-10-02 09:14:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara A threat to who? When? Where? How? I haven't seen it.
1311836635663937536 2020-10-02 09:13:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's a base turnout election. Fire up the base!

1311834388997591041 2020-10-02 09:04:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Another good reason to vote for @realDonaldTrump like your life depended on it.
1311834193379328000 2020-10-02 09:03:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ignore the noise. Keep calm and vote @realDonaldTrump!
1311833525453312000 2020-10-02 09:00:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Did @realDonaldTrump test positive? Is that why he left Minnesota so quickly?
1311833345031114754 2020-10-02 09:00:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump keep taking your hydroxychloroquine + zinc, you'll be fine.
1311832720717369345 2020-10-02 08:57:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Biden won't be in charge. Harris will, and she'll be worse than Obama.

1311830977807818754 2020-10-02 08:50:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? You just mail ballots all over the place? COMPLETE AND TOTAL FRAUD
1311830602044321792 2020-10-02 08:49:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @catturd2 It's amazing. @joerogan regularly reaches 10 million people w/ his podcasts. The best cable hosts like @seanhannity &amp; @TuckerCarlson max out at 4 mil. @megynkelly, @benshapiro, @scrowder &amp; others are starting a trend of going directly to streaming &amp; bypassing the corporate media.
1311829678974554113 2020-10-02 08:45:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who cares? @realDonaldTrump takes hydroxychloroquine, he'll be fine.
1311829177994223618 2020-10-02 08:43:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS @realDonaldTrump, DO IT! Debates are petty and pointless. You could reach a much huger audience.
1311828884778897408 2020-10-02 08:42:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I smell a minority wave brewing... they're just not excited about Biden, and Trump has worked hard to earn their vote.
1311828674862292993 2020-10-02 08:41:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Testing positive for Coronavirus doesn't mean much these days. Most people don't actually get sick.
1311828528866955264 2020-10-02 08:41:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What is it with these people? Calling us crazy when they are clearly the biased ones.
1311828229762830336 2020-10-02 08:39:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher If he's all alone up on stage, it doesn't matter.
1311827909036969984 2020-10-02 08:38:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This would make an excellent excuse to cancel future debates. He really needs to not get sick though.
1311827687053430790 2020-10-02 08:37:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Do Democrats ever do anything other than call people racists? So sick of it.
1311827399798132737 2020-10-02 08:36:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? So you're just gonna make up numbers for what you want the mail in ballots to be BEFORE they are counted? Unacceptable.
1311802011457859585 2020-10-02 06:55:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Why do people have such a hard time understanding Proud Boys? It's all in the name!
1311801784663511045 2020-10-02 06:54:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Proud Boys are not racist. Their leader is a Cuban for crying out loud!
1311800360881795073 2020-10-02 06:49:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @heckyessica Why would @JoeBiden cite Proud Boys as an example of white supremacy? Makes no sense to me. I guess his brain is just scrambled. They are all about gender, not race.
1311800106618945537 2020-10-02 06:48:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Eeeeexactly. The Obama economy was the worst economy this country has ever seen.
1311799922681839617 2020-10-02 06:47:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Joe spouted his usual BS. @realDonaldTrump's strategy was to constantly call him out on it. You covered for @JoeBiden.
1311799591864541185 2020-10-02 06:46:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RyanGirdusky The only way establishment Republicans every gain power is due to loooong periods of Trumpian economic success, to the point where politics becomes less relevant.
1311799033103556613 2020-10-02 06:43:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Now you're accusing fellow Hispanics of being white supremacist? LOL
1311797997982883840 2020-10-02 06:39:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He will not. Cancel it and invite @JoeBiden to a moderator free debate.
1311797655954223108 2020-10-02 06:38:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Where are the white supremacists they're so worried about? What are they doing? Nothing. The whole thing is a smear by premise.
1311797165266796544 2020-10-02 06:36:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't think name calling is going to win this election...
1311797034169630724 2020-10-02 06:35:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealCandaceO @JoeBiden @JoeBiden thinks blacks are an inferior class that need to be locked up in jail. @realDonaldTrump treats them like his peers and gives them a seat at the table. Vote accordingly.

1311794955245977602 2020-10-02 06:27:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I would if I had TV. I watch stuff on @YouTube. Y'all should get into streaming, that's where the future is headed. But no paywall. Ad supported.
1311794617478717447 2020-10-02 06:26:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @scrowder Maybe @realDonaldTrump should not agree to any more debates. The moderators will just beat up on him while appearing "neutral", and people are already voting. Just turn out the base.

1311693475772076035 2020-10-01 23:44:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Chamaa @realDonaldTrump Ridiculous. A) There is no global warming. Temperatures have been declining for years. B) Humans cannot control the weather. C) The collectivist ideas behind this are alarming.

1311502857812676608 2020-10-01 11:07:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheRightScoop Needs a @RichardGrenell
1311502493424050176 2020-10-01 11:05:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher Republicans love law and order. We are never in disarray (that we tell you about, anyway).
1311497284652167172 2020-10-01 10:44:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This ****ing guy. HE WAS THE ONE WHO LEFT THEM BEHIND!!!
1311496196314333187 2020-10-01 10:40:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Don't do it. Make the lazy bums get jobs. It's good for them.
1311494782364127232 2020-10-01 10:34:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealNorthernGrl @EliStokols It was a pretty good crowd. We could all see the livestream.
1311494342922641409 2020-10-01 10:33:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm gonna say... NO BAILOUT.
1311493015156948992 2020-10-01 10:27:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RealBPhil Geez. Yoga mats and sugar. @SUBWAY does strange stuff with their bread.
1311492309599617025 2020-10-01 10:25:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL is that what you call murdering people in cold blood and burning down cities?
1311492095958487041 2020-10-01 10:24:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EliStokols Yeah IDK what happened, he was rushing through it tonight. Minnesota is a long shot I guess.
1311491362894864389 2020-10-01 10:21:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug The genius of capitalism is that to get ahead, you have to help other people get ahead. Win win for everyone.
1311490059724566528 2020-10-01 10:16:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't care how many hoaxes and fake polls the MSM puts out there, watching @realDonaldTrump's rallies I just can't see him losing.
1311484078680616961 2020-10-01 09:52:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Chris Wallace needs to get over himself.
1311479410097356801 2020-10-01 09:33:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @dbongino He's playing dumb so he doesn't go to jail for life.
1311475721064374273 2020-10-01 09:19:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHA throwing hats so awesome!
1311467656466370560 2020-10-01 08:47:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RNCResearch Guess @senatemajldr should go ahead and eliminate it now, pass everything he wants to before the election.
1311466728199774213 2020-10-01 08:43:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher @JoeBiden He was deliberately ignoring Wallace the whole time, as well he should. "Will you condemn white supremacists?" is an absurd question when there are no white supremacists doing anything but Antifa/BLM are murdering people in cold blood.
1311465948419850241 2020-10-01 08:40:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher @JoeBiden said Proud Boys. He was ignoring Chris Wallace.
1311461594296127490 2020-10-01 08:23:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Just do it.
1311461490575245312 2020-10-01 08:22:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why would turnout be depressed?
1311461186781749254 2020-10-01 08:21:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JStein_WaPo @redsteeze Quit with the mickey mouse socialist redistributionist policy. People are getting back to WORK!
1311459836970897408 2020-10-01 08:16:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He has to do that a lot, huh?
1311459303388262400 2020-10-01 08:13:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fire them. Trump is in charge, not them.
1311457135646183424 2020-10-01 08:05:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> GIT EM @realDonaldTrump
1311438285152149504 2020-10-01 06:50:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's running against all your hoaxes.
1311437356478668800 2020-10-01 06:46:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stclairashley Betas.
1311405304312143879 2020-10-01 04:39:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Sue him for the inevitable libel and defamation.
1311404979824005120 2020-10-01 04:38:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bingo.
1311404764740096002 2020-10-01 04:37:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I don't see what's wrong with that?
1311403505530417165 2020-10-01 04:32:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excuse me? Did you not notice @realDonaldTrump hammering him every chance he got? To the point people complained he was interrupting and talking way too much? Don't be establishment. Bad @benshapiro.

1311377472571748354 2020-10-01 02:48:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @michellemalkin @realDonaldTrump I think he should challenge @JoeBiden to a debate on their own terms with no outside control.
1311377155461459969 2020-10-01 02:47:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump should NOT agree to the new rules designed to shut him up.
1311376793224568833 2020-10-01 02:46:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Eliminate moderators.
1311376035204739072 2020-10-01 02:43:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LESS structure is needed. Let the candidates debate!
1311372876185042946 2020-10-01 02:30:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES!
1311372796564582403 2020-10-01 02:30:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump should either boycott the "debate" (i.e. moderator indoctrination session) or get the rules changed.
1311372608953344001 2020-10-01 02:29:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He meant to say "stand down" obviously. He didn't recall the correct word in the moment.
1311335776786042880 2020-10-01 00:03:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher Coal miners already know he's their guy. He's going for suburban moms.
1311335329425743873 2020-10-01 00:01:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @trish_regan @JDRucker @trish_regan needs to moderate the next debate.
1311335088634974210 2020-10-01 00:00:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BUSTED! @Comey KNEW THE WHOLE TIME that @BarackObama was the one who ordered the spying on the Trump campaign and he said NOTHING!
1311334224604139520 2020-09-30 23:56:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ick.
1311334047273058305 2020-09-30 23:56:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TimJGraham To ask someone to condemn white supremacy is to accuse them of being a racist. It's insulting.
1311328480961978370 2020-09-30 23:34:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @megynkelly Suburban moms think Ol Joe is creepy and gross.
1311325969010118658 2020-09-30 23:24:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And nobody heard of it until just now where you spread it.
1311325749413060610 2020-09-30 23:23:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Stop falsely accusing him of being a racist then.
1311325371439165440 2020-09-30 23:21:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump I mean he said the words lol
1311307513153941504 2020-09-30 22:10:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara That would be good except that it tacitly acknowledges the Dem premise that racist groups on the right are just as responsible for the violence and looting. They're not. There is no racist activism on the right right now.
1311306901259513856 2020-09-30 22:08:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (@realDonaldTrump is fighting big pharma to lower drug costs. This only helps him.)
1311306752508547074 2020-09-30 22:07:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @elwasson @margbrennan We should not be spending $2 trillion more. We need production and a return to business, not inflation.
1311306182527791104 2020-09-30 22:05:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I was under the impression that the Proud Boys were a (fringe) men's group. The charge of racism is absurd. Misogyny would have more of a chance of sticking, although I haven't seen it.
1311305394548072448 2020-09-30 22:02:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara ...or he said "stand back and stand by". I believe what he meant to say was "stand down".
1311305188234452993 2020-09-30 22:01:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara How so? He said I'll condemn whoever you want me to condemn. Biden said "Proud Boys". There isn't really anything that they did that deserves to be condemned, so he said ok well then stand back. He didn't know what to condemn them for.
1311302311625609216 2020-09-30 21:50:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES! Would be so much better.
1311301874298085376 2020-09-30 21:48:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Charlottesville, maybe, but that was three years ago. Antifa and BLM are the main perpetrators of violence and looting right now. Trump reacted appropriately - he said he would condemn it but he basically wasn't sure who they were wanting him to condemn.
1311300889362210816 2020-09-30 21:44:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah well, get your establishment Republican neverTrumper base on board.
1311300238125289473 2020-09-30 21:41:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Why? I haven't heard of any white supremacists doing anything, unless you're referring to Antifa. A myth.
1311294293257203713 2020-09-30 21:18:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A billion things.
1311293905263042561 2020-09-30 21:16:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @amandacarpenter No.
1311293438789332992 2020-09-30 21:14:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JimPethokoukis Even worse is, you know, Antifa and the left. You know they're killing people and burning down buildings, right? "White supremacists" are not the problem here.
1311292768719958016 2020-09-30 21:12:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Moderators should not scold the President of the United States. It disrespects the office.
1311290756032847877 2020-09-30 21:04:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There's only one choice. Liberty McCain.
1311289593329856512 2020-09-30 20:59:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FALSE. Critical race theory is NOT "racial sensitivity training". It is literally the opposite. It is training in how to be racist.
1311288911860297729 2020-09-30 20:56:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LibertyAndTech Although it's a subtle way of implying that they are responsible for the violence, which is not true.
1311190699669364736 2020-09-30 14:26:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BIDEN HAD AN EARPIECE!!!

1311180902182146049 2020-09-30 13:47:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TimRunsHisMouth @realDonaldTrump Congrats @TimRunsHisMouth on the RT.
1311180764256628738 2020-09-30 13:47:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LibertyAndTech Why are debates never held on right wing networks? Makes no sense.
1311179890809597952 2020-09-30 13:43:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden lost
1311179204050944005 2020-09-30 13:40:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @politico Who the hell cares about "dignity"? We care about putting food on the table, roofs over our heads, healthcare, education, giving our children good lives. No one cares about some rich elitist notion of "dignity".
1311178435721662464 2020-09-30 13:37:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @politico Ridiculous. That's not a debate, it's a forum with two speeches.
1311177575121801216 2020-09-30 13:34:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nailed it.
1311176631604703232 2020-09-30 13:30:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec That's where they had the black panthers intimidating voters outside the polling place last time, right?
1311176403430367232 2020-09-30 13:29:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @GiancarloSopo @JasonMillerinDC @EquipoTrump If @realDonaldTrump wins minorities I'm not sure what votes are left for Democrats. Leftist base doesn't like @JoeBiden either, especially after he betrayed them on the Green New Deal.
1311175709931560960 2020-09-30 13:27:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM!
1311175295106527232 2020-09-30 13:25:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And that's why we elected him. He will not sell out.
1311175030336872448 2020-09-30 13:24:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOOOOOOOM WE'RE GONNA WIN!!!
1311174207137513473 2020-09-30 13:21:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is actually a perfect response, except I'm not sure there is any reason to condemn the Proud Boys.
1311173467786575873 2020-09-30 13:18:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL
1311172991703756803 2020-09-30 13:16:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump won, in the sense that he achieved his long term objectives and @JoeBiden did not.
1311172644704747520 2020-09-30 13:14:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BOOM
1311172595627298818 2020-09-30 13:14:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (Hunter was dishonorably discharged.)
1311171692199325696 2020-09-30 13:11:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Because of his leftist base.
1311168490905186304 2020-09-30 12:58:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden's lies will catch up with him in the next few weeks.
1311161375637614595 2020-09-30 12:30:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nor should they. Why would you want a moderator "controlling" the president of the United States? Let them debate!
1311161172004147200 2020-09-30 12:29:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> FIRE HIM
1311161083747594241 2020-09-30 12:28:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good news, anecdotally. My mother thought that while Trump has his issues, Biden was worse - creepy and corrupt. Making inroads with women!
1311143819568656386 2020-09-30 11:20:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because the people that the left falsely labels "white supremacists", are not.
1311142930875387904 2020-09-30 11:16:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Lyin' Biden
1311142868543770624 2020-09-30 11:16:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews He also said it was flat out false that Hunter got 3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow, which is completely untrue.
1311141631274475520 2020-09-30 11:11:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The only real question here is whether supposed Republicans want to throw the race to Democrats or not.
1311140834629300226 2020-09-30 11:08:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> All I care about is what suburban women think (or women of any class).
1311140594438283264 2020-09-30 11:07:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It doesn't matter who won. What matters is the things that @realDonaldTrump got @JoeBiden on camera saying. Ad material.
1311140012616974341 2020-09-30 11:05:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec @megynkelly Hey now hold your fire, she was supporting @realDonaldTrump in the debate.
1311139545111502850 2020-09-30 11:03:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Stand back" is a very strange call to arms.
1311139370318147585 2020-09-30 11:02:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Very true. @realDonaldTrump was playing long term strategy here. It almost doesn't matter who won in the moment. It's the positions he forced @JoeBiden into.
1311138842146213889 2020-09-30 11:00:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ScotsFyre @JoeBiden @JoeBiden lied about everything and everybody let him get away with it because lol nothing matters
1311136831296229378 2020-09-30 10:52:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump should not agree to any such rules. If debates are going to be biased against him, he should not participate.
1311136615981604864 2020-09-30 10:51:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "For the entertainment" hey I mean people got what they paid for.
1311136422691250177 2020-09-30 10:50:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Let's be honest @realDonaldTrump overwhelmingly won on points and @JoeBiden was factually wrong. But it won't matter because all suburban woman care about is the feels.
1311135011928715266 2020-09-30 10:45:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TrumpStudents @joerogan If @joerogan doesn't moderate the next debate, we don't need to hold any more. He's a leftist, but he would treat the candidates more fairly than Chris Wallace.
1311134535623553029 2020-09-30 10:43:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We "started at a 12" because people are already voting.
1311134463137640448 2020-09-30 10:43:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cnn does not want "crosstalk" in a *debate*. This is not a forum. It is a debate.
1311134364294619141 2020-09-30 10:42:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cnn is a leftist activism channel
1311134212959895552 2020-09-30 10:42:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cnn is so freaking biased
1311134129128382465 2020-09-30 10:41:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dana Bash just used profanity on @cnn.
1311133997154676741 2020-09-30 10:41:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wow, @jaketapper is a full blooded leftist here. Unacceptable. He is not a journalist.
1311133700034310145 2020-09-30 10:40:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump performed perfectly. He kicked the crap out of @JoeBiden, who was mostly irrelevant. Chris Wallace did a horrible job and lost the debate.
1311132276609212417 2020-09-30 10:34:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Chris Wallace is so unfair.
1311132211920408576 2020-09-30 10:34:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden says the same thing on solicited ballots
1311130804970553344 2020-09-30 10:28:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump won, Chris Wallace lost.
1311130181474680835 2020-09-30 10:26:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden is afraid of the weather.
1311130050507542528 2020-09-30 10:25:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Did he just say "you make up a lot of horses****"?
1311129579621359616 2020-09-30 10:23:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jbarro Easy. Just let them talk.
1311127943314366464 2020-09-30 10:17:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL I am LOVING @realDonaldTrump just ignoring sanctimonious Chris Wallace outright. He knows how to play cat and mouse with the media.
1311127645778739201 2020-09-30 10:16:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> BRUTAL
1311127432255148032 2020-09-30 10:15:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Can we please have a debate, not a moderator lecture?
1311126493863477248 2020-09-30 10:11:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Antifa is bad" @realDonaldTrump CRUSHING it
1311125722728198144 2020-09-30 10:08:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This debate was a disaster for @JoeBiden. He got the crap kicked out of him, and that's putting it nicely.
1311125479450202113 2020-09-30 10:07:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Chris Wallace jumps in to save @JoeBiden YET AGAIN.
1311124894835507201 2020-09-30 10:05:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Well he did just say it... with qualifiers.

1311122476844359680 2020-09-30 09:55:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's gonna get grilled in ads.
1311122078280622086 2020-09-30 09:53:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why won't Chris Wallace let them debate? (Because he's protecting @JoeBiden.)
1311121952019492865 2020-09-30 09:53:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is just dunking all over Chris Wallace.

1311092830857814019 2020-09-30 07:57:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> By... admitting that he is incapable of debating Trump on his own? OooooK.

1310928787111108608 2020-09-29 21:05:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Going after the hair strikes me as weird. If there's one thing that @realDonaldTrump has to spend money on to burnish his image, it's the hair. Legitimate business expense.

1310799178877018113 2020-09-29 12:30:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump @CNN It's not the worst idea. If you lose you should immediately start a Don / Ivanka 2024 campaign.

1310387759673217025 2020-09-28 09:16:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No it's this but with the @nytimes deciding "failed businessman" or "tax cheat".
1310386880635170816 2020-09-28 09:12:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @_Drew_McCoy_ I hope its not because of losing his position with the Trump campaign.
1310386759285518336 2020-09-28 09:12:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh come on. Dude owns hotels, real estate, golf courses, resorts. Used to own casinos. He has assets.
1310386478288113664 2020-09-28 09:10:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Turns out the playing one on TV can be just as lucrative as  the real thing. Every job is an act.
1310386070358499329 2020-09-28 09:09:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There it is. Trumps alerted. Will be in @realDonaldTrump's next press conference.
1310385806360616962 2020-09-28 09:08:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh no. Good he's not campaign manager right now. Is it job related or is he having a mental breakdown?
1310384422265458688 2020-09-28 09:02:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And you can apply the reverse to the @nytimes.
1310380815415734274 2020-09-28 08:48:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wealthy??? He was losing money!
1310380076782039043 2020-09-28 08:45:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And? Definitely a business expense.
1310378632557322241 2020-09-28 08:39:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec Lol these people think that rich people have to fork over their stuff just because they have it. No private property. Marxism.
1310378244479344640 2020-09-28 08:38:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oooooh goody! @JamesOKeefeIII is gonna beat @nytimes for next week's news cycles, isn't he?
1310376737210077184 2020-09-28 08:32:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Should help him. The biggest knock on him has been that he's an evil rich guy who doesn't understand the struggles of the middle class.
1310374491055415297 2020-09-28 08:23:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @EricTrump Maybe someone over there at the hack rag @nytimes should get the tax returns of Hunter Biden. Much more interesting.
1310373457356558337 2020-09-28 08:19:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You cannot simultaneously claim that @realDonaldTrump is an evil richy rich who should pay more taxes and a failing businessman who lost millions. Pick one.
1310373113805275136 2020-09-28 08:17:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HE WAS LOSING MONEY!!! What, do you plan on taxing assets, not income now? I suppose you probably do - property taxes. Makes everyone poorer.
1310372741879656450 2020-09-28 08:16:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? If you lose money, you don't owe any taxes.
1310372324210814976 2020-09-28 08:14:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Tax cheat? He lost millions! And you still want to confiscate money from him for the government.
1310371707979468801 2020-09-28 08:12:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because average Americans don't get $80 million stolen from them?
1310368125414789123 2020-09-28 07:58:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JayCostTWS Exactly. Dude probably owns 5 houses like that and rents them out making a small fortune.
1310367635910078465 2020-09-28 07:56:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KamVTV Exactly. I care about *my* taxes.
1310367146086666241 2020-09-28 07:54:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS

1310347200749350912 2020-09-28 06:34:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheBabylonBee Not far from the truth. An earpiece in his mask?
1310346495653228545 2020-09-28 06:32:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jeschroeder14 @NumbersMuncher Because they're making 10 times what he was making... in fact he was losing money.
1310345647380455425 2020-09-28 06:28:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You do know that Trump is not his own attorney, correct?
1310345141723561984 2020-09-28 06:26:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Are we going with @realDonaldTrump is a billionaire and should pay more taxes or that he's a poor guy and a bad businessman? Can't be both.
1310344196616794114 2020-09-28 06:22:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @alexsalvinews @OANN Nobody is "playing" him. They aren't doing mock debates. They're suggesting stuff that might come up int he debate.
1310343672312070144 2020-09-28 06:20:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good riddance.
1310343480514883586 2020-09-28 06:20:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @NumbersMuncher Why would the middle class want the federal government to confiscate that money?
1310334880904081414 2020-09-28 05:45:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What is the left's insane fascination with wanting to punish successful people by taking all their well-deserved money and forking it over to undeserving federal government?
1310334685608849410 2020-09-28 05:45:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HERO. We should all strive for this.
1310333818004439041 2020-09-28 05:41:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump lost a lot of money. Of course he should pay less tax in that year.
1310333367079129090 2020-09-28 05:39:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's insane. Might as well write a check to donate to the federal government if you love it so much.
1310332875347238912 2020-09-28 05:37:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Enemy of the people.
1310331574781652994 2020-09-28 05:32:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is supposed to be a bad thing?
1310331502652162048 2020-09-28 05:32:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Probably lost a lot of money in the campaign.
1310331271780933632 2020-09-28 05:31:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara @NumbersMuncher @MikeDury So not a lie.
1310330838400348165 2020-09-28 05:29:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Hero.
1310330755072045056 2020-09-28 05:29:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You mad? People are not required to pay taxes to the government when they don't make any money.
1310330586196836358 2020-09-28 05:28:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL it worked, suckers.
1310330353010257925 2020-09-28 05:27:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Come on, man, crap or get off the pot.
1310330248785993731 2020-09-28 05:27:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is supposed to be a scandal?
1310329928370487296 2020-09-28 05:26:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's because he didn't take a salary you idiots.

1310298632474763270 2020-09-28 03:21:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @KHerriage @realDonaldTrump should give him a pat on the shoulder then snatch it away.

1310089979192897536 2020-09-27 13:32:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There is no such thing as a "personal relationship with Jesus Christ". Look in the Bible, it's not there. It's a marketing tool for Christianity that pastors use, but it creates a lot of mental cases who talk to voices in their head.

1309546409146953729 2020-09-26 01:32:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Play in the street, get hit by cars. We've known this ever since Five Iron Frenzy.
1309545642767855617 2020-09-26 01:29:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... sorry girl, you can't just marry into royalty and take power here. Our system works a little differently...
1309502189006729216 2020-09-25 22:37:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL these hacks. He promised to pick a woman and his base loves it! But @maggieNYT IS the glass ceiling.
1309501748814413827 2020-09-25 22:35:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @physicsgeek He always was a bit of an entitled schmuck, even if his columns were fun to read.
1309501015721480199 2020-09-25 22:32:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> That's because the @fbi is a partían hack department that is focused on subverting the president instead of doing their job.
1309500330477072384 2020-09-25 22:29:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh OK, then I guess election fraud doesn't matter. Not like this could have happened other places we don't know about.

1309495190999257089 2020-09-25 22:09:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Where is @BarackObama? Why isn't he out campaigning for @JoeBiden lol? (Answer: even Demomcrats aren't going to hitch their wagon to that dead horse.)
1309486433363730433 2020-09-25 21:34:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Is there any investigation into the elite pedophile ring that Epstein and @BillClinton ran?
1309485411392159747 2020-09-25 21:30:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @mschlapp @foxnewspoll oversamples Democrats. #FakeNews suppression poll.
1309483406636584960 2020-09-25 21:22:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yup. If you're down 5 points in a @foxnewspoll, you're tied at worst.
1309482816435093505 2020-09-25 21:20:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL this rag. Of course he would leave office if he were fairly defeated. Democrats do not have the power to stop him from winning a fair election, because his policies are good for America and theirs aren't.
1309482316947914753 2020-09-25 21:18:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why the scare quotes?
1309480193799737347 2020-09-25 21:09:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> As usual, Democrats accusing Republicans of the very things they are doing. @HillaryClinton STILL refuses to accept the election results and peaceful transition of power.
1309479807051333634 2020-09-25 21:08:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because "climate change" is not a real thing. The real problem is that China was not included.
1309479186847936517 2020-09-25 21:05:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's 8:05am. Has @JoeBiden called a lid yet?
1309477784494977024 2020-09-25 21:00:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The climate years into the future.
1309351922567086081 2020-09-25 12:39:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "I'm not planning on losing" is a better one.
1309350878265171968 2020-09-25 12:35:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets That's exactly why @realDonaldTrump said the virus would disappear. Eventually it will become apparent that there is no real threat from Coronavirus and it will just drop out of the news cycle as people lose interest.
1309348265347944448 2020-09-25 12:25:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excuse me! There will be no transition of power, peaceful or otherwise. @realDonaldTrump will win!
1309343887065067521 2020-09-25 12:08:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The question is not whether he will accept that, but whether the election will be free and fair.
1309343302089670658 2020-09-25 12:05:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. There will not be any transfer of power. Trump will win.
1309343139807846402 2020-09-25 12:05:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MattWolking @RealSaavedra People should be asking if @JoeBiden will peacefully accept the results of the election, but it's a moot point since he can barely get out of bed.
1309341214756540416 2020-09-25 11:57:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHAHAHA you think Hunter Biden could draw a crowd like that? This is the president's *son*. How the hell is he not going to win in a landslide?
1309310563009335296 2020-09-25 09:55:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "false" Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump ballots were left in a ditch by PA officials.
1309310232770772992 2020-09-25 09:54:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Trump would only "refuse to leave office" if the result is unclear. Because he may have won. #Idiots
1309308344352600065 2020-09-25 09:46:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> No thanks.
1309308111858130944 2020-09-25 09:45:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous. I have a more realistic map I've been keeping track with, and if he wins MI or PA, he wins the election. I have NV undecided, AZ red, FL red, OH red, NC red, PA &amp; MI undecided.
1309307050716008448 2020-09-25 09:41:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 100% think that. Because Trump supporters think it will be Trump.
1309306698901975042 2020-09-25 09:40:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara The point of a lifetime appointment is that political considerations are not supposed to impact judges once they are on the bench.
1309306105810612225 2020-09-25 09:37:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LegInsurrection Just like last time, owning the media and lying to people about things does not a winning electoral campaign make.

1309282666097913857 2020-09-25 08:04:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If @realDonaldTrump is up in Michigan OR Pennsylvania, it's over.

1309159890586345477 2020-09-24 23:56:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> THIS. Never believe the #FakeNews media one month before an election.
1309153618495496195 2020-09-24 23:32:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Republic of Florida", "Commie Coast" 😂😂😂
1309153154957824003 2020-09-24 23:30:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. Not due to Coronavirus. Due to the Democrat scheme to cheat and add extra votes after the election. Never happened before in the history of our country. If you want your vote to count, get it in on time.
1309152148157075458 2020-09-24 23:26:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @marcorubio ...and it will be President @realDonaldTrump.

1309151127896809473 2020-09-24 23:22:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec There is only ONE non-peaceful transfer of power, and it is all coming from Dems and the left. The gall to accuse @realDonaldTrump of the same!
1309150550697672705 2020-09-24 23:19:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Shut your freaking mouth. You STILL refuse to accept his legitimate election in 2016. You created a fake Russian Collusion hoax to attempt to subvert the government of the United States, when Hunter Biden was the one colluding all along.
1309138382791028736 2020-09-24 22:31:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Well that's it folks. I'm calling a lid for the day.
1309136551100772354 2020-09-24 22:24:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Somehow @realDonaldTrump manages to prepare for the debate without calling any lids.
1309135394466926594 2020-09-24 22:19:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How exactly is it illegitimate?
1309134165464539137 2020-09-24 22:14:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> re: @JoeBiden
1309133959918424073 2020-09-24 22:13:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec He'd be gone within a month, and that's with an insane amount of leeway extended. Like if he was the best employee the company had (when there).
1309133433709486082 2020-09-24 22:11:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Weird, because 80% of the black community would disagree.

1309132736452534282 2020-09-24 22:09:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Will @staceyabrams and @HillaryClinton peacefully concede power? (No. Riots in the streets and dead cops.)
1309131897889488897 2020-09-24 22:05:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> EXACTLY

1309131336582680577 2020-09-24 22:03:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Ridiculous. You want him to concede right now?
1309130753704423425 2020-09-24 22:01:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden is so damn entitled. No, you cannot be elected president without even making an effort to campaign.
1309130392033783813 2020-09-24 21:59:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Steal the election??? Why do you assume it belongs to you? (Because Dems are planning to cheat.)
1309128595047153664 2020-09-24 21:52:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What. The. Hell. Is. Going. On??? This man cannot lead the nation.
1309128176765931523 2020-09-24 21:50:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump never asserted that a transfer of power would not be peaceful. What he asserted is that he is going to win the election, so there will be no need for a transfer of power. Will Dems accept THAT? (No, they never do.)
1309071373990535170 2020-09-24 18:05:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> But he fights.

1309001448810782726 2020-09-24 13:27:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He's not going to go at all. He's going to be president for four more years. Deal with it.
1308990383351836674 2020-09-24 12:43:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oops.

But yeah I mean call around to the best hospitals and see what they can do. Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, MD Anderson Cancer Center, etc. Take action. There are some great new immunotherapies out there that are working.
1308988123121176580 2020-09-24 12:34:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeeeeeeeaaaarrrgh this guy!  Connecting completely unrelated things so he can control the population.
1308986497522073600 2020-09-24 12:27:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This might shock you, but he doesn't plan on transitioning power at all after he wins the election.
1308985778513608705 2020-09-24 12:25:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @maggieNYT Gives her time to prepare for all the lies you're planning on attacking her with. Prayer and meditation before the battle.
1308984965930065920 2020-09-24 12:21:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why would he commit to losing? You all think that's a given. It's insulting.
1308983949767700482 2020-09-24 12:17:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Maybe you should focus on the real problem, which is that your guy has cow farts for a brain. It is unlikely that he would win a fair election.
1308983442747674624 2020-09-24 12:15:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wrong. He should have said "we don't anticipate losing a fair election".
1308983191248809985 2020-09-24 12:14:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Mostly peaceful shots. The press has become a laughingstock.
1308967820290674690 2020-09-24 11:13:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Apparently we are not tough enough on crime in this country. Turns out "criminal justice reform" has a downside.
1308967233046142984 2020-09-24 11:11:22 +0800 <jpwilloughby> For a group that seems to want a lot of attention, #BlackLivesMatter sure attacks a lot of reporters. Dumb.

1308952353605849088 2020-09-24 10:12:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jasonrantz @JimDeMint "Mostly peaceful" means "very violent" in media speak. The Tea Party protests, for example, were COMPLETELY peaceful.

1308948514328776707 2020-09-24 09:56:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden's answer: No, the wife of the Russian mayor giving my son $3 million was completely appropriate. C'mon, man!
1308945752039841797 2020-09-24 09:46:00 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Remember hanging chads? Russia hoax? @staceyabrams? Democrats NEVER accept the legitimacy of an election.
1308945295703711747 2020-09-24 09:44:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He understands perfectly that it is about the legitimacy of the election.

1308944530427842566 2020-09-24 09:41:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump never disagreed with that, given a legitimate election.

1307782542775418880 2020-09-21 04:43:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Such an idiotic poll question. Half of those being polled assume Trump will be that winner. So it does not matter if he fills it before or after the election.
1307781662730850306 2020-09-21 04:40:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Because your network, and other left leaning MSM networks, are complete partisan hacks. Did you not get the memo?

1307754475805958145 2020-09-21 02:52:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher The Senate had the power to block it and did. If @BarackObama didn't like it, he should have nominated someone more to their liking.

1307684376935895043 2020-09-20 22:13:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not exactly. He said he hoped the husbands were alright with it, as they have been away from home for 90 rallies. It's what couples who love and care about each other do. It's not like they had to get formal permission.

1307566943998676992 2020-09-20 14:27:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's like they think that their chants, mantras, and temper tantrums actually mean anything. Screaming into the void.
1307565448104378375 2020-09-20 14:21:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Dems don't set the rules. They don't have any leverage here. We'll nominate and confirm a justice, as per the Constitution, before the election. Trump will win re-election with the GOP majority intact. This is just liberal fantasy.

1307552360340893696 2020-09-20 13:29:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> False. The President chooses justices and the Senate advises and confirms. SCOTUS itself has no role in appointing justices, especially from the grave.
1307551594238685185 2020-09-20 13:26:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara The fact that Democrats don't believe this deserves a serious answer 45 days before an election... they're just not serious. People can't seriously vote for this guy, can they?

1307532143258742785 2020-09-20 12:08:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah well, get out of your basement and try! But you didn't write this, because you are dying.
1307511676195999744 2020-09-20 10:47:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @brad_polumbo I'd never do it. Abandoning his wife to be with a woman young enough to be his daughter... that'll do it.

1307367323267928068 2020-09-20 01:13:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @emzanotti Because @JoeBiden is not a real leader and has ceded the field of battle to @realDonaldTrump. Put simply, @JoeBiden is a pussy.

1307365520455405571 2020-09-20 01:06:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump @GOP An added plus that by acting and leading @realDonaldTrump continues to make @JoeBiden irrelevant.

1307364406183985154 2020-09-20 01:02:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dems were always going to pack the court anyway. Why doesn't the @GOP pack the court now and beat them to it? Or better yet pass a Constitutional Amendment limiting the total number of SCOTUS justices.

1307190083678863360 2020-09-19 13:29:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @davecatanese So yeah, steal. Running a health insurance business is not in the Constitution. Things like providing for the common defense are.
1307189312811864064 2020-09-19 13:26:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Provide" is an interesting frame... you mean, like steal money from a ton of people?

1307109296480681993 2020-09-19 08:08:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Heminator @RealSaavedra Not even that. Republican senate and Dem president.
1307108507230130176 2020-09-19 08:05:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What a jerk move. I doubt she actually said this, or cared at all about it as she lay dying.
1307108041695821824 2020-09-19 08:03:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There is no "McConnell rule". There is whatever raw politics allows you to do. Republicans control the Senate and Presidency. New justice by January.

1307061615053987843 2020-09-19 04:59:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fact check: true. @realDonaldTrump sees more angles and has better judgement. Why he's president and not them.
1307059432933781505 2020-09-19 04:50:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Bullcrap. Politicians spend your Social Security taxes on their pet projects. Pay for Social Security from the general fund.

1307058010611765249 2020-09-19 04:44:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) We got a LOT richer.  B) $120k / yr is not poor

1307055502833135616 2020-09-19 04:34:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden just said that we must reward wealth over work.

1307053637072551937 2020-09-19 04:27:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Blaming @realDonaldTrump for Coronavirus will not work.
1307053487944069122 2020-09-19 04:26:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm sorry @JoeBiden, I was told by the experts that masks do not work.
1307053196867710976 2020-09-19 04:25:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Democrats *really* love the Coronavirus pandemic and do not want it to end!
1307051219186257924 2020-09-19 04:17:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why the hell are people voting before we've even had the first debate?

1307041591182454787 2020-09-19 03:39:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I guess bettors think there's a 4% chance neither is declared the winner and it continues to be contested.
1307041388295589890 2020-09-19 03:38:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uhhh... @PredictIt has a 104% chance of either a Biden or Trump victory, 96% chance that one of them loses. So if I plop down $9600 (proportionally) on a loss for either, I'm guaranteed $1000 back, a 4% return in 1.5 months. 32% return annually.
1307037635987337225 2020-09-19 03:23:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who's this new doctor?

1307024154982481920 2020-09-19 02:30:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The experts said facemasks weren't effective.
1307023873255378945 2020-09-19 02:29:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> PA and NV. Flip them and @realDonaldTrump wins. An outside chance in WI/MI/MN as well.
1307023541813026816 2020-09-19 02:27:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Right. The first woman president should be elected, with all the appropriate pomp and circumstance, not just take over because someone died.

1306082891214909447 2020-09-16 12:10:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Actually they would.
1306082459663183873 2020-09-16 12:08:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Climate change is a leftist conspiracy theory.
1306081464942039040 2020-09-16 12:04:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh crap. If @benshapiro is leaving, there is truly no hope for California. It's gone.
1306011805953724416 2020-09-16 07:27:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dead company
1306010538519023619 2020-09-16 07:22:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> There it is.
1306005046828642305 2020-09-16 07:00:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why?
1306003080824205315 2020-09-16 06:52:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AstorAaron Those are never reported along with the topline results.
1305976888700088324 2020-09-16 05:08:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @elonmusk @boringcompany The big problem, I would imagine, being oxygen?
1305976808509239296 2020-09-16 05:08:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @elonmusk @boringcompany It's like an invisible HOV lane.

1305975731915288578 2020-09-16 05:04:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good. Glad they're clueless about how politics works. Hope it stays that way!
1305973407440351233 2020-09-16 04:54:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AstorAaron I don't really buy into the latter - pollsters are anonymous so why would people lie? But there's no conflict between the two, both could contribute to Dem support being over-represented.
1305948869130432512 2020-09-16 03:17:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Might as well cede California to China.
1305948664070893576 2020-09-16 03:16:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC @MSNBC is pro violence.
1305948522831896580 2020-09-16 03:16:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Daaaaaaang of course! Now it all makes sense. Who else would fund communist riots in the US but communist China?
1305948027081969665 2020-09-16 03:14:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets @realDonaldTrump is also meticulous about his public image. Never so much as a hair out of place. But yeah no obvious ailments.
1305946585264721920 2020-09-16 03:08:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I'm so sorry this happened to you.

1305946056115576832 2020-09-16 03:06:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BrentBozell Watch the media come out against peace in the Middle East. Seriously they are that TDS'd.
1305945744428367872 2020-09-16 03:05:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Is this somehow better than @GoodRx?

1305945275199094784 2020-09-16 03:03:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Guys, do you want to be California with its homelessness, riots, and fires? That's what you'll get in the @KamalaHarris administration.
1305944892212948995 2020-09-16 03:01:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Always an appropriate reaction when it comes to @voxdotcom.
1305944657415766016 2020-09-16 03:00:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They're not even making any bones about it. It's the @KamalaHarris campaign.
1305923059694686209 2020-09-16 01:34:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Science without business is all theory and no execution. Pointless.
1305922702952235008 2020-09-16 01:33:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Excellent!
1305921864326414337 2020-09-16 01:30:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AstorAaron Why the fake suppression polls are put out.
1305920036327034881 2020-09-16 01:22:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ReaganWorld I love how he just casually solves a problem that has dogged the world for millenia two months before the election. "I mean, you *could* elect the other guy, but..."

1305526820108935169 2020-09-14 23:20:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @ComfortablySmug @realDonaldTrump is the president that has given everybody what they've always said they wanted... and somehow he's still hated for it?

1305380956115787777 2020-09-14 13:40:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This shooting was fully justified and, in fact, required. Clear cut self defense against an attempted murder.
1305377681756901376 2020-09-14 13:27:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JackPosobiec ...or rather, they want idiot young people with no experience instantly given all power over others, instead of having to work their way up to it like older folks did.
1305377356169830400 2020-09-14 13:26:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It means they want to kill older people.

1304860434802053120 2020-09-13 03:12:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @RampageRantz @JDRucker @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I wouldn't send by ballot in early by mail. Too much chance for it to be intercepted and altered. Just vote once on election day.
1304859914876092419 2020-09-13 03:10:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Guys. Pedophilia rings withing Hollywood are not a theory. They are an established fact. Ask people like @RonanFarrow. Think Tim Allen, Harvey Weinstein, etc.
1304858613413023745 2020-09-13 03:05:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL "QAnon conspiracy and harassment campaign"? These pedos are nuts!
1304858187124834304 2020-09-13 03:03:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why do all libs have psychiatrists and "therapists"? Proof that liberalism is a mental disease I guess.
1304841080836415488 2020-09-13 01:55:31 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It is hard. Q was right about the pedos.
1304838937014349824 2020-09-13 01:46:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @stclairashley I'm cancelling Netflix because of Away.

1304816536255954956 2020-09-13 00:17:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The progressive undertones are unbearable. "There's a woman captain, but does she feel good and will the men support her?" "All the nations must unite to make it to Mars" "Disease can be conquered by the power of love and unity" Unpalatable.
1304815857512648704 2020-09-13 00:15:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Look a that 60 minutes special someone just tweeted about. They shrank a brain tumor by modifying the polio virus with a snippet from a cold virus to attack the cancer cells only.
1304810887572848642 2020-09-12 23:55:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Mmmph. The entire economy vs. sweatpants and puppies would be a tough choice. I'd have to say sweatpants and puppies would probably win.

1304802433860808705 2020-09-12 23:21:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @butforthe I think if a 19 year old marries a 17 year old, that's probably not rape.
1304802059187892225 2020-09-12 23:20:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @butforthe I think America coddles teenagers in adolescence. Instead of dragging on schooling for years, letting them live in their parents' basements, staying on their parents health insurance, etc, we should help them grow up and become responsible adults.

1304798991373217795 2020-09-12 23:08:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So I gotta say something here. I haven't seen Cuties, so I don't know how bad it is. Child porn and pedophilia is gross and wrong. Also, some people seem to think that teenagers are "children". When you hit 13 and go through puberty, you become an adult. Bar mitzvah, etc.

1304433810923192322 2020-09-11 22:57:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @LPDonovan We don't need any more government welfare to mask the crisis. Coronavirus is over and the economy is recovering organically. Go back to work everyone.

1303929062352658432 2020-09-10 13:31:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> We need patriotic education in schools.
1303928334536110080 2020-09-10 13:28:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Manage your damn forests, governor. Blaming your failures on an imaginary bogeyman will not absolve you of responsibility. No wonder @kimguilfoyle left you for a real man.
1303927473768476673 2020-09-10 13:25:10 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Obviously (i.e. not you)
1303901778103218176 2020-09-10 11:43:03 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I didn't support Trump originally because I thought he'd put his own business interests ahead of the country. He didn't. He did the exact opposite, and I will always be proud of switching to support him (so long as the good policies continue).
1303870050156400641 2020-09-10 09:36:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> And everything would be locked down forever and we'd all be dead.

1303822672447578112 2020-09-10 06:28:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Funny how that only happens in a critical swing state. Kids are "testing positive" that have no symptoms. Ridiculous!

1303788893746139136 2020-09-10 04:14:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I fail to see why these deaths are blamed on Trump? If you want to blame someone, @NYGovCuomo has FAR more responsibility for them than Trump. @realDonaldTrump has done everything in his power to prevent deaths. He's not God, he can't stop all deaths and make everyone immortal.
1303788289955180547 2020-09-10 04:12:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL yeah Trump is up 10 there.

1303604076844912640 2020-09-09 16:00:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> He says he's a progressive. Supported @BernieSanders. Talks out of both sides of his mouth to suck up to guests.
1303591529798344704 2020-09-09 15:10:14 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yup.
1303584334218170370 2020-09-09 14:41:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Damn cultural appropriation. Ridiculous.
1303584085542146048 2020-09-09 14:40:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> "Words words words", says local man who believes that the noises coming out of his mouth are noteworthy. So bold. So brave. So beautiful.

1303566771400605696 2020-09-09 13:31:52 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SteveDeaceShow School choice and patriotic education. Do those two things and America's problems are solved for decades.
1303566519096532993 2020-09-09 13:30:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Actually it's because there was no outbreak caused.
1303566069827764229 2020-09-09 13:29:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets Ditto in Oklahoma. Nobody "testing positive" is actually getting sick.
1303565861354196992 2020-09-09 13:28:15 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The only policy misstep he has ever made is banning offshore drilling. And maybe loopholes for H1-B holders taking jobs from Americans.
1303545216855674880 2020-09-09 12:06:13 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @MelissaTweets It'll definitely worsen it - Vitamin D is an anti-inflammatory steroid.
1303542412569006082 2020-09-09 11:55:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @bariweiss To qualify for me to go see a movie and spend money on it, it must portray old white men in a positive light.
1303528518303846400 2020-09-09 10:59:51 +0800 <jpwilloughby> When Al. Freaking. Sharpton. opposes #BlackLivesMatter, you know there's something seriously wrong with the movement.
1303526483844050946 2020-09-09 10:51:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> How does @realDonaldTrump not think he is going to get blowback for banning offshore drilling in places like Pennsylvania?
1303525965419679747 2020-09-09 10:49:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @AmyKremer @realDonaldTrump A little cultish, but ok.

1303525134762999809 2020-09-09 10:46:25 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher The latter happens to be true.
1303479169947492353 2020-09-09 07:43:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> (He just banned offshore drilling.)

1303326311646191617 2020-09-08 21:36:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Oh wait those fundraising pleas were serious? I thought they were flush with cash.
1303325648828674048 2020-09-08 21:33:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheBobPowers @TomCottonAR Typical lib. Doesn't give a crap about the elderly who are prone to heatstrokes.
1303313092860932099 2020-09-08 20:43:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL because he was never grifting in the first place. You people.
1303311697780899841 2020-09-08 20:38:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TheBobPowers @TomCottonAR A) They aren't.  B) Even if they were, wouldn't happen for millions of years. I have a thousand other things to worry that my progeny will die from before that. For example, lack of air conditioning.
1303311142899548163 2020-09-08 20:36:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Mersadeon @JPQIITOO @tedcruz I guess I'm "having the last laugh" now from my air-conditioned home in fossil fuel rich Oklahoma? I feel sorry for you guys and the mental prison in which you live.
1303185502322003969 2020-09-08 12:16:50 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cryptodouchebag @TomCottonAR False. Your idiotic hatred of capitalism is the problem.
1303185327553732610 2020-09-08 12:16:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cryptodouchebag @TomCottonAR That's because you're an ignorant California screwball. Goodbye.
1303181050735140864 2020-09-08 11:59:09 +0800 <jpwilloughby> NEVER.
1303180960763187202 2020-09-08 11:58:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cryptodouchebag @TomCottonAR They won't stay there long without electricity.
1303180897034723329 2020-09-08 11:58:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cryptodouchebag @TomCottonAR *eyeroll* You're hopeless. Corporations are simply groups of people running things. The profit motive is the only thing that incentives people to compete and produce the best product (clearly not happening in CA). You people in California are so backwards.
1303179474003951617 2020-09-08 11:52:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What the hell? Why is the @gop funding the lying fake news media?

1303175296976400393 2020-09-08 11:36:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @TomCottonAR Actually, it would not. You know nothing about fossil fuel or business. Move to Oklahoma, we'll show you how it's done. Or really anywhere outside California.
1303175003358351360 2020-09-08 11:35:07 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cryptodouchebag @TomCottonAR Exactly. Damn environmental regulations make the economics impossible.
1303165312553095168 2020-09-08 10:56:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @TomCottonAR What you do is you build LOTS of power plants and run them most of the time at 80% of capacity or whatever. When there is high demand you ramp up to 90, 95% capacity. You build in a margin.
1303162817072291840 2020-09-08 10:46:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr please tell your dad to go ahead and pardon @Snowden.
1303162518811160578 2020-09-08 10:45:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @TomCottonAR Yes radical environmentalists hate fossil fuel power plants and do everything they can to stop. I already answered the second question. That's now how power companies work, you don't understand anything about business management or capacity planning at all.
1303159699563589633 2020-09-08 10:34:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @TomCottonAR Stopping fossil fuel energy you liberal Californian idiot.
1303158341473046530 2020-09-08 10:28:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nah we'll hit 5% before the end of the year. Unless @JoeBiden wins.

1303156423673679872 2020-09-08 10:21:17 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Good point. Should have been a bigger story.
1303156001479299079 2020-09-08 10:19:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @TomCottonAR Again, ridiculous. This is a false choice. You don't know how capitalism or business management works. The problem is California's embrace of restricting businesses and fossil fuels. Deregulate and I guarantee the problem goes away.
1303154824679231490 2020-09-08 10:14:56 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Not unless you believe the fake suppression polls. @realDonaldTrump is at 52% approval.
1303154248260222976 2020-09-08 10:12:38 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL I have yet to be retweeted by @realDonaldTrump but I can imagine it's quite the experience.

1303152488028176384 2020-09-08 10:05:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cryptodouchebag @TomCottonAR Then they should build more power plants. Unless the government won't let them???
1303150744963616768 2020-09-08 09:58:43 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Nope. Nope nope nope. End all mail-in voting. Everybody votes at the same time on Election Day and the results are tallied that night. Like we've always done it.

1303147919718191111 2020-09-08 09:47:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @cryptodouchebag @TomCottonAR Literally every other state and every other business is capable of meeting "high demand". It's called business management and it could easily be done except for California's ridiculous environmental restrictions.
1303147661231611904 2020-09-08 09:46:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @PaMaCrypto @TomCottonAR You are completely making up a straw man argument. You don't know how energy works at all.
1303147537629618176 2020-09-08 09:45:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @TomCottonAR False. I've heard this BS argument from libs for years, and it is ridiculous. Every other state is capable of managing their energy production to satisfy demand.
1303147376509677571 2020-09-08 09:45:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @chumpsupporter1 @TomCottonAR Ridiculous. Wind and solar are the MOST unreliable sources; they only work when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. You can ALWAYS burn coal. Build more power plants and use them.

1303085181625077761 2020-09-08 05:38:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @tedcruz You can always build more power generation sites that run on good old fossil fuels. California, however, refuses to do this. They would rather people die. Why I will never live there.
1303069023689674753 2020-09-08 04:33:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I have it figured out. @elonmusk is the world's first conscious robot. The machines are taking over.

The key will be the same as it was in 2016: midwestern swing states like Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and now Minnesota. @JoeBiden is owned by China and shipped their jobs overseas.

1303018606935056392 2020-09-08 01:13:39 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Obviously. But the left doesn't care about that. They care about the feels, and making everyone equally as poor as them since they wasted their lives and didn't develop any useful skills.
1302975666216935424 2020-09-07 22:23:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A piece of advice for the kiddos - bite the bullet and do what you have to to get out ASAP. I don't care if you have to live in a half burned down shack in the bad part of town. Teaching yourself self-reliance is indispensable.
1302975309336244224 2020-09-07 22:21:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Yeah, but we still haven't seen much inflation yet.

1302777423205892098 2020-09-07 09:15:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DonaldJTrumpJr The problem here is that no one actually believes @JoeBiden is on the left. Making the argument that he will work with them a little bit just doesn't pack a punch.

1302031974887030785 2020-09-05 07:53:08 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @DavidAFrench What could possibly possess someone to want to vote for @JoeBiden, or think that that would benefit them? Other than a few former disgruntled GOP bigwigs seeking revenge for the loss of their power.

1301939520355602438 2020-09-05 01:45:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Dang @RichardGrenell on his second public briefing of the day.
1301938769189392387 2020-09-05 01:42:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JasonMillerinDC "Please sir may I have another?"
1301938551261716481 2020-09-05 01:41:54 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze Same question, @realDonaldTrump. Why aren't you angrier? You know who is angrier? @kimguilfoyle
1301938342179803137 2020-09-05 01:41:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @redsteeze The moment he gets on shaky ground...
1301937948426985472 2020-09-05 01:39:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Of course @JoeBiden loves normalization between countries, he's a globalist.
1301935698069590017 2020-09-05 01:30:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> So much of the job of being a president is acting. Why it's called a "role".
1301935446734274563 2020-09-05 01:29:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Thought we were gonna get a "c'mon man" there.
1301934975579836419 2020-09-05 01:27:41 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Man, the obsequious way these reporters treat @JoeBiden is quite a contrast with how they grill @realDonaldTrump.
1301934800551522306 2020-09-05 01:26:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fact check: @JoeBiden has NOT been out campaigning and covering territory.
1301934420333678593 2020-09-05 01:25:29 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Man he gets rattled easily.
1301934296039653378 2020-09-05 01:24:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh no. China tripped him up.

1301933994523660289 2020-09-05 01:23:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Fact check: public health experts said that wearing masks did NOT save lives. But he says he listens to scientists lol
1301933093159399425 2020-09-05 01:20:12 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Qanon? Are these people serious? Who picked these questions?
1301932665050992640 2020-09-05 01:18:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh please @JoeBiden nobody buys your fake tears.
1301932558792392704 2020-09-05 01:18:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A softball. Shocker!
1301932367427391489 2020-09-05 01:17:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh no. @JoeBiden is taking questions.
1301931916229324800 2020-09-05 01:15:32 +0800 <jpwilloughby> HAHA the @realDonaldTrump response to this crap speech was FAST!
1301931405400776709 2020-09-05 01:13:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> More victimhood. One thing's for sure, we'll never recover as a nation with that attitude.
1301930715173597184 2020-09-05 01:10:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wait does he want the economy open or not?
1301929787146018821 2020-09-05 01:07:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> This is awful. @JoeBiden should not speak in public.
1301929487370776576 2020-09-05 01:05:53 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What the hell, @JoeBiden? We ARE having a great recovery and @realDonaldTrump IS leading well. It's DEM states that are keeping everything shut down. He's digging his own grave - numbers are only going to get better.
1301929038873866243 2020-09-05 01:04:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden sounds like he thinks it's the 1970s.
1301928717762125824 2020-09-05 01:02:49 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Now @JoeBiden is trying to criticize @realDonaldTrump on the economy after today's AMAZING numbers, especially compared with his record with Obama? Wow.

1301927751885168641 2020-09-05 00:58:59 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Somebody told @JoeBiden this would get him the military vote. Pathetic.
1301927551670124546 2020-09-05 00:58:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Oh gosh this is awful. Grandpa fell for a hoax.
1301927349273976834 2020-09-05 00:57:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> First word from @JoeBiden - "sorry". @realDonaldTrump would never start that way.
1301912854224875520 2020-09-04 23:59:47 +0800 <jpwilloughby> LOL their are no "permanent jobs". Economies and businesses change with market demand. Deal with it and get another job.
1301910786055565315 2020-09-04 23:51:34 +0800 <jpwilloughby> They are NOT a trash pollster. They are the gold standard. They got it right last time when everyone else got it wrong.
1301910258022076418 2020-09-04 23:49:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You absolute buffoon. You celebrated @BarackObama for taking 8 years to bring jobs back and you want @realDonaldTrump to do it in a day? IT DROPPED 2% IN A MONTH!!! This is like 100x as fast as Obama did it.
1301909409086558208 2020-09-04 23:46:06 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @BreitbartNews Given that the "hood" contains people like this guy, becoming a police officer to "get back" at him was a wise career choice.
1301907883408453632 2020-09-04 23:40:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Neoavatara Rasmussen was the only accurate pollster last time around.

1301906963501068295 2020-09-04 23:36:23 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @JoeBiden? He ain't no patriot. Sold us out to China. Only @realDonaldTrump supports the US and our military.
1301906158135971841 2020-09-04 23:33:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @IngrahamAngle We need to see unemployment rate by state.

1301880715475288064 2020-09-04 21:52:05 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jasonhsv @ComfortablySmug The ironic thing is that to produce all this economic growth he's doing... nothing. Just keeping the government from interfering.

1301873591911411714 2020-09-04 21:23:46 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Federal law enforcement agent confirmed that a left-wing Antifa murderer was fatally shot in an attempted arrest when he pulled a gun on them. #FIFY

1301852951909195778 2020-09-04 20:01:45 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @politico I mean it's not that hard. @JoeBiden regularly trips himself up.
1301852083969196037 2020-09-04 19:58:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @SaraCarterDC Not just shooting him. Killing him.
1301851170294706176 2020-09-04 19:54:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I've never heard of a president assassinated because he raised taxes, but ok.
1301850667104034816 2020-09-04 19:52:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Uh... pretty much true. If somebody isn't willing to pay money for something, it isn't valuable to them.

1301849112799850496 2020-09-04 19:46:30 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Wow. @VICENews is STILL perpetuating the lie that patriot prayer was going to kill a black man. This murderer got what was coming to him.
1301848398379782145 2020-09-04 19:43:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Capitalism is the solution. Leftist racialism is the disease.
1301847816130756608 2020-09-04 19:41:21 +0800 <jpwilloughby> 😂 @realDonaldTrump is so good at trolling the left into making his point for him
1301761961500258306 2020-09-04 14:00:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Who the hell kills a guy in cold blood and then immediately goes on national media to give an interview about it? Insane. And why didn't @VICENews immediately turn him in to the police?
1301757486685466624 2020-09-04 13:42:24 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Do they not clear the airspace around the president? What if that had been a plane hijacked by Antifa terrorists to fly into the middle of the rally and kill people? Could have been shot down.
1301756883208994816 2020-09-04 13:40:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Apparently it's ok to murder someone if they say something you take offense to. Good to know, @JoeBiden.
1301755942388858880 2020-09-04 13:36:16 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The hell? Dude got what he deserved.
1301755807239999489 2020-09-04 13:35:44 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I voted for @tedcruz in the primary, @EvanMcMullin in the general. I've been a die hard @realDonaldTrump supporter every since due to his policies and the left's reaction. I will crawl over broken glass to vote for him for the first time this year.
1301754855204282368 2020-09-04 13:31:57 +0800 <jpwilloughby> YES!

1301739850563903489 2020-09-04 12:32:20 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Humble_Analysis @MelissaTweets I work at a hospital and honestly I'm not sure if anyone still has it.
1301739629968842752 2020-09-04 12:31:27 +0800 <jpwilloughby> You guys wouldn't seriously want @JoeBiden to be president of the United States would you? I know you hate Trump and all, but geez!
1301739344705630209 2020-09-04 12:30:19 +0800 <jpwilloughby> It's so out of control that @SpeakerPelosi feels free to go about her business without a mask.
1301739255178330113 2020-09-04 12:29:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> A) It came from CHINA which @JoeBiden loves. B) Trump has gotten it under control C) Biden wouldn't have done any better. He certainly wouldn't even have enacted a travel ban.
1301735566560681985 2020-09-04 12:15:18 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Screw Arizona, we don't need them. Let them join the Dems.

1301727231945912320 2020-09-04 11:42:11 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump Well you did call him a loser. You said you liked people that weren't captured.
1301726604704575488 2020-09-04 11:39:42 +0800 <jpwilloughby> The world would make sense again. It's not me watching @cnn though, it's the lunatic left.
1301725572742213632 2020-09-04 11:35:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @jgarzik The previous administration shut down all sales and instead every ad was Marxist crap about the "community" and the government taking care of you. Which they didn't. Americans like their interests being catered to.
1301725176111992832 2020-09-04 11:34:01 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whatever McCain was, in actual fact, a loser. I don't give a crap if we lose Arizona, it's a bunch of rich establishment hacks anyway. More than made up for by winning PA, OH, MI, WI, FL, etc etc etc.
1301723865278808067 2020-09-04 11:28:48 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Whatever, if rich people pull their cash out of circulation and let it rot in a mattress (or low interest back account), it will simply increase the value of a dollar for everyone else. Your precious snowflake desires don't drive the economy.
1301666264612560896 2020-09-04 07:39:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @realDonaldTrump is... not a Christian leader.
1301665180724670466 2020-09-04 07:35:37 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @Lauren_V_Egan @maggieNYT It's a peaceful protest you idiot.

1301521070093107201 2020-09-03 22:02:58 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why fight it? Teachers are doing what we have long wanted, shutting public schools down. Go to private, charter, online, homeschool.

1301300770340470785 2020-09-03 07:27:35 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @billscher Yeah whatever. First of all that average includes bogus left wing media polls, should be closer to 3%. And the debates will swing another 10% when it becomes clear how truly incompetent @JoeBiden is.
1301299979680702464 2020-09-03 07:24:26 +0800 <jpwilloughby> What the hell? What does skin color have to do with it? If one person of a certain color commits a crime that means the entire race are criminals?
1301299754333331457 2020-09-03 07:23:33 +0800 <jpwilloughby> @TomFitton She's blaming the salon for not covering for her? For not helping her lie and subject the population to rules she herself will not follow?
1301299381216391171 2020-09-03 07:22:04 +0800 <jpwilloughby> I mean it's kind of a meaningless milestone. There's not a whole lot of difference between 99% debt to GDP and 101% GDP.

1301295489271369729 2020-09-03 07:06:36 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Heal? Does he mean he will tell his leftist base to stop burning things down in person?

"Educators" are useless and need to go get real jobs providing benefit to society. Students should learn online/homeschool/private/charter or get jobs.

1300663593365536771 2020-09-01 13:15:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> ...the communist plan is to rile up blacks and use them to tear down the existing system. Then they can come in and build their own communist system.
1300662788063457280 2020-09-01 13:12:28 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Why do they want to defund the police? Certainly blacks don't support that, but black lives aren't what matters here. The police would stop their rioting and looting. There is a plan here for a communist revolution, and cops are standing in the way of that.
1300636667267743745 2020-09-01 11:28:40 +0800 <jpwilloughby> If you watch this, you'll understand where the election is being fought and won by @realDonaldTrump.  https://t.co/K6No2ncf38

1300613828858781697 2020-09-01 09:57:55 +0800 <jpwilloughby> Where has she been for the last 90 days? Mars?
1300613604727820289 2020-09-01 09:57:02 +0800 <jpwilloughby> These are radical communists. Doubt they care much for @JoeBiden. They'd probably rather have Trump as a foil to start their revolution.
