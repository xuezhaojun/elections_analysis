1337624149338910720 2020-12-12 13:03:43 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @JohnMiddlekauff Could make sense if they hire Saleh and bring one of the Mike‚Äôs, jimmy knows how they work could be a way better Hoyer for Detroit
1337623730692898816 2020-12-12 13:02:03 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @JohnMiddlekauff What if they do Jimmy and a 3rd or 4th? Since Saleh will get a HC job that will give us a 3rd. Maybe throw in a 2022 2nd? To sweeten the pot?

One, it is true and has been proven, and if is not true why hasn‚Äôt anyone in the Biden campaign said that it is made up? Two, they can‚Äôt verify it‚Äôs false? Didn‚Äôt stop them reporting the Russia hoax or the steel dossier.

1309914347502579714 2020-09-27 01:54:52 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @GatorCritic @nfldraftscout But Reed is a better athlete safe to say? Came to college as QB and turned into a 3rd round pick and a all pro TE. Had like 600 yards in 8 games as a rookie. Don‚Äôt get wrong I LOVE me some Pitts he is a monster
1309911846254641152 2020-09-27 01:44:55 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @nfldraftscout He reminds me of Jordan Reed, so Kyle will be the only logical landing spot

1309261098776842241 2020-09-25 06:39:05 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @terrellowens How is that racial divide and injustice you say caused by Trump? Lowest unemployment for Black, Hispanic, Asian Americans, School choice. Not to mention the funding he has done with HBCU‚Äôs. Past administration did not do any of this. Or is that what the media told you?
1309213947157868545 2020-09-25 03:31:43 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @MikeSilver I think we all know this will not happen, people don‚Äôt like terrorist such as BLM and Antifa. Number one thing for every person is to feel safe, and the left does not make people feel safe. Just the truth. Pulse Joe doesn‚Äôt even know the pledge of allegiance. Come on man ü§£

It‚Äôs sad that she died and her BF put her in that situation. On another note have you been practicing your touch throws in Cuba with your boy Castro? I know you respect his work
1308904047106285572 2020-09-24 07:00:17 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @JoyTaylorTalks Didn‚Äôt the cop go to jail?

Some people are better at talking shit than others, not everyone is Ali or McGregor. Both of them said many heinous statements as well. I don‚Äôt agree with your view but respect your feelings.

Just saw this interview and the one after he won the fight? But don‚Äôt the majority of the fighters say heinous things on the mic? Pretty standard to drum up interest in the fight and smart too.

Now, he is speaking about injustice in the Black Community. Makes him look like a hypocrite. But I could be wrong

Those people are rioting, breaking into and looting business, burning down those businesses, and killing people. Harassing and assaulting innocent people.

1307433340341874688 2020-09-20 05:36:13 +0800 <edwards_stevi> @RexChapman What about all the racist Antifa and BLM Rioters? Why don‚Äôt you EVER say anything about them? You know they are killing your narrative right? All of that chaos on the streets will make people vote for Trump and he will win, so please don‚Äôt be surprised when it happens.
