So, stay tune, share this out or donate any amount you wish to this fundraising (see comment for link). No amount is ever too small!  #spideysanta #SantaDash2020 #MyCheveningJourney #FirstChristmasInUK  https://t.co/xCMRdwSHLi

There're many versions out there &amp; no restaurant could replicate the taste I grew up with. Tonight, I came close &amp; it's a dream come true!  https://t.co/OmZTSzwpaR

The hours are equally long, but it gets dark by 4.30pm. Woke up at 7am today to experience a "longer" day. Felt rejuvenated to connect with the nature once again.  https://t.co/l1viEZYhFj

1327662593008398339 2020-11-15 01:20:03 +0800 <syyeam> Just posted a photo @ Great Pulteney Street  https://t.co/1kIpqYceN1
1327660926263324676 2020-11-15 01:13:26 +0800 <syyeam> A unique feature of UK. You can tell an age of a post box through its cyphers =) This particular one is represent the era of Queen Victoria from 1837-1901!  #CheveningTreasure #TeamBlue #TeamBlueWork #MyCheveningJourney  https://t.co/5cGmhlWVpe

1316465949734850562 2020-10-15 03:48:35 +0800 <syyeam> This reminds me of how inspiring speeches can be. Unfortunately, I've witness many speeches which were just read off a script. I used to live in a world where people write their own speeches...used to. The next time you're giving a speech, don't forget the soul.  https://t.co/rZCzQIFZ1x
1315606111228231680 2020-10-12 18:51:54 +0800 <syyeam> Interesting discussion on Day 1 of REFSA regional conference. Surprised by the rather pessimistic view of digitisation. I guess it's due to the inequitable gains, with some portion of the society being left behind. So, again it's about social mobility.  https://t.co/le1k2JXnJH
1310330727876132864 2020-09-28 05:29:24 +0800 <syyeam> For me, an effective leader sees beyond the results. He or she values the journey with the team. If you think this sounds like you, a fully funded #Chevening Scholarship could change your life. #BeALeader  https://t.co/ycNwgTpqnl  https://t.co/vY5S0do4ET
