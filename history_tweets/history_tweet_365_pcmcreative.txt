I wonder if other platforms Twitch, Facebook etc have auto #CC without a subs requisite.
1309479942342795267 2020-09-25 21:08:41 +0800 <pcmcreative> So... @YouTube only enables real-time, live #ClosedCaptions, while live-streaming, on accounts with 1000+ subs. For this project #CC is needed from account creation so the facility is there now, not after 1000 subs. Is this right? Any way to get the setting activated by request?
