1304196562000719872 2020-09-11 07:14:25 +0800 <FiferColin> Watching I am not a Rapist was gut wretching. That poor girl who lost her brother &amp; her mother within a year has been left devastated. There is no way this should be allowed. One girl was clearly busted lying yet nothing was done about it. Ridiculous.
1304063794587594753 2020-09-10 22:26:51 +0800 <FiferColin> @MiddleAgedMGTOW Females hate each other. Its part of their competitive nature against each other. There is no 'sisterhood' - its all fake. The weak will follow the strong for protection but they all still despise each other.
