1341978907252166659 2020-12-24 13:27:58 +0800 <imperium_v> Australia Xmas eve:   bottle shop/liquor store lineup all through store like winding snake, battle ground car park, barely any stock left, only cask wine and light beer left, people fighting over bags of ice.   Supermarket open, fully stocked, comparatively few people inside.

1341891508979429377 2020-12-24 07:40:41 +0800 <imperium_v> in spite of irrefutable evidence cold water immersion is gay because cold water feels unpleasant and unpleasant is homosexual and homosexual is not warmness which is generally pleasant.

1341342030027354112 2020-12-22 19:17:15 +0800 <imperium_v> This is Wuhan, ground zero, old town. Popped up on my ipotato memories. I cannot disclose the reasons I ended up here.  This is the product of the apparently superior Han mind for those not acquainted with it intimately.  https://t.co/Ph42VhLabA
1341334864415531008 2020-12-22 18:48:47 +0800 <imperium_v> My best spiritual teachers and mentors were ruthless with me and my pissy little simian flights of fancy.  I piss all over a lot of rw stuff because I respect my mutuals &amp; I wish to impart, even in a small way, the most valuable lessons that were and are imparted to me.
1341333334480175112 2020-12-22 18:42:42 +0800 <imperium_v> All the great traditions subscribe long periods of self destruction. The military does.  The rw obsession with self-improvement fails, because your self is the "problem".  That nagger doesn't need reinforcement, for almost all of us it needs to be dragged behind a shed and shot.
1341332093897326598 2020-12-22 18:37:46 +0800 <imperium_v> exactly. twitter injects this vile human lethargy with super verbiological doses of steroids. just monkeys blabbering and talking and blabbering and talking. In a self induced digital-daze. I don't suggest political action necessarily, this also in life. all talk no action.
1341330532416643072 2020-12-22 18:31:34 +0800 <imperium_v> Words and self-concepts are just that. A vocabulary can be interesting... if you talk about a philosopher arrogantly you may feel superior temporarily, or maybe even get laid - whatever you do, don't fall into the trap of mistaking it for real work or action with consequence.
1341329143422570496 2020-12-22 18:26:03 +0800 <imperium_v> One of the elements of fight club I enjoy is the framing of self-improvement as masturbation &amp; self-destruction being where it's at. This is an important distinction when you think about it. And a useful one, for those who really want to work. This work is fringe, for sure.  https://t.co/FXoupNgsVe
1341327854953349126 2020-12-22 18:20:55 +0800 <imperium_v> Fight Club is a great book. Movie is reasonable, a good comedy. The book gets a lot of flack in these circles, I don't know why. Not intermuhlekshual enuf? Not sure. I think people never like being told they're not inherently special just for looking a certain way or breathing
1341323636527886336 2020-12-22 18:04:10 +0800 <imperium_v> @RareMocanu1 My take, no offence intended:  There‚Äôs too much self improvement in these circles. It‚Äôs Larpy because it‚Äôs just words &amp; thinking and it‚Äôs seeking popularity and reinforcement online - it‚Äôs not real I contend controlled self-demolition is far more important. There is a difference.
1341309881442168838 2020-12-22 17:09:30 +0800 <imperium_v> @MUNRO2K I like this context, didn‚Äôt realise they were willing. Many paint it as mere brutality. Seems more like pure warrior behaviour that we see in Japan for example.

1339819307941838848 2020-12-18 14:26:30 +0800 <imperium_v> @CityBureaucrat I know people who were just grateful to get back, sit in traffic for hours and  ‚Äúget away from the wife and kids‚Äù. Just living misery on autopilot
1339818049667354624 2020-12-18 14:21:30 +0800 <imperium_v> @FilmsJoshua I‚Äôd listen even though I‚Äôve been declared a leftist and enemy of the people recently haha
1339816567953973248 2020-12-18 14:15:37 +0800 <imperium_v> Reminds me of a few people on the TL recently actually
1339810885368303617 2020-12-18 13:53:02 +0800 <imperium_v> @John__Wolff There isn‚Äôt a point just didn‚Äôt understand the beginnings of the British empire until recently.   And what‚Äôs your point you sound like a fucking dickhead
1339773049541808128 2020-12-18 11:22:41 +0800 <imperium_v> @rice_aroma Yes, few know of the origins of joint stock corporations and the inheritance modern corps owe to the EIC, particularly the American-style Imperialism and military support of their expansions. It all started with the EIC.
1339769281131683842 2020-12-18 11:07:42 +0800 <imperium_v> I've always said the nature of people is that of an incompetent detective. They never take anything at face value, preferring to search for secret motives or sinister connections - however almost always way off the money.
1339764813635829761 2020-12-18 10:49:57 +0800 <imperium_v> @fritzpure i was relating facts using lingo that lots of people use these days. i couldn't care less how you choose to take it. don't you have something better to do than have this pointless argument.
1339763705601425410 2020-12-18 10:45:33 +0800 <imperium_v> @fritzpure yeah i couldn't care less about the morality of it. I'm making the statement that the east india company went in there, took it over, and that was the basis for british supremacy. whatever else you read into it is on you. you're the only smarmy argumentative one here. as usual.
1339762639275085824 2020-12-18 10:41:19 +0800 <imperium_v> @fritzpure there's no value judgement in there saying it's bad, it's a statement of historical fact.  you just don't like me so you try to find ways to take what i say out of context.
1339761776578084865 2020-12-18 10:37:53 +0800 <imperium_v> @fritzpure what's this got to do with being a leftist
1339759951892238339 2020-12-18 10:30:38 +0800 <imperium_v> for sure the anglo was a pirate that's absolutely for certain.
1339759681498087424 2020-12-18 10:29:34 +0800 <imperium_v> Recent redpill for me was clear realisation that British wealth came from rayping India/Mughals &amp; British Empire really just mostly grifted off the initial piratical actions of the British East India Corp, and their voracious power appetites &amp; nation threatening private military.
1339704248091611136 2020-12-18 06:49:17 +0800 <imperium_v> @aevolist Mang I miss that blog

1339147962325159936 2020-12-16 17:58:49 +0800 <imperium_v> @nedkelly__ Personally I think the true true clear pill was best exemplified by the Buddha in some of the Pali texts. I did an eSoTeRiC thread on it a while back when I interviewed John Powers. Disclaimer I have a tendency to push things to the logical end point.

1339051642872713218 2020-12-16 11:36:04 +0800 <imperium_v> Since I started training mma / kickboxing seriously been getting very bored with gym. Then I remembered I should probably stop being gay

1338289164203114496 2020-12-14 09:06:15 +0800 <imperium_v> @first_australia ngl I have zero eastern blood however I was reading about it the other day an im liking the fact it's more mystical and way less legalistic than its western cousin. I probably would also if I was such inclined.
1338287827159638018 2020-12-14 09:00:56 +0800 <imperium_v> I think if we've established anything at all over the last couple of months it's that you can't trust anything that anyone says, and that almost no one knows anything at all.

Reminded of bodhidharma who recommended green tea for meditation, obviously with mild caffeine.  Need to do show with you to discuss your experience

Steer clear of weak sauce subjects like moralfagging on actions taken by Ted (all other interviews obsess on this), instead go straight for the jugular of technological society. Practical and spiritual solutions. Maybe. Enjoy.

1337927679199256578 2020-12-13 09:09:50 +0800 <imperium_v> @chungathustra he agreed interestingly also with this, also commented high Middle Ages was probably more sophisticated anyway than we are. was my belief also basically.
1337925854404386817 2020-12-13 09:02:35 +0800 <imperium_v> I'll say it again, from an ultimate perspective the world is just, by its nature it is an instrument of justice.

1335564286442147845 2020-12-06 20:38:34 +0800 <imperium_v> @Waywardcloud2 I'm irresponsibly all in. Just be careful, and don't become a true believer. for the transfer element it's probably a great idea.
1335561594739204099 2020-12-06 20:27:52 +0800 <imperium_v> there's really nothing good about cryptocurrency. it's monetary psychic platonism and quite frankly, it will be and was designed as a tool of domination, not freedom. the only good element is using it to try to buy your freedom, while that opportunity still exists.
1335560329317609474 2020-12-06 20:22:50 +0800 <imperium_v> @aesthetici4n actually was going to mention Anna Karenina. you may have a point.
1335559319958421504 2020-12-06 20:18:50 +0800 <imperium_v> So it's up to you. There's nothing that says they can't win. You know full well how they are doing it to you; they manipulate your women, your parents, your community. They place barriers in front of you, of all kinds. So what will you DO about it?
1335558488622125060 2020-12-06 20:15:31 +0800 <imperium_v> There is no secret here. They want to facilitate consumption and reproduction in an efficient, sustainable, stable manner. They want to cement their power as unassailable. To do this, they must disempower potentially powerful young men, who will always pose the greatest threat.
1335504011160522752 2020-12-06 16:39:03 +0800 <imperium_v> @aevolist @elaphos_ Would also tbh fussy man is a lonely man

1335411274499248128 2020-12-06 10:30:33 +0800 <imperium_v> @DhammaFarmer Tempting and yet my experience of life definitely sways towards no good deed having gone severely  unpunished

1334333434865491969 2020-12-03 11:07:36 +0800 <imperium_v> It makes sense Laotzu refers in fact to the Buddha. 1. The Chinese lack spiritual imagination &amp; have always imported ideas.  2. The Chinese lack general imagination. 3. The Chinese are unoriginal.  4. The Chinese rehash worse versions of others ideas.  5. The Chinese are boring.

Resting heart rate 10 or more from your resting rate average - rest increase.

1324675966132649984 2020-11-06 19:32:16 +0800 <imperium_v> @real_thomas777 solid.
1324674066221993985 2020-11-06 19:24:43 +0800 <imperium_v> @real_thomas777 Tbh didn‚Äôt think Gremlins were real till I saw Chicongo mayor
1324672846983958535 2020-11-06 19:19:52 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ you're telling me. it's fucking outrageous.
1324671046851522562 2020-11-06 19:12:43 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ Let's face facts - from the right point of view, a spiritual and eternal one, this buffoonery can't really be seen as much more than the clown show that it is.
1324669899520700425 2020-11-06 19:08:09 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ im more like this tbh, can't talk for Ayrabs or Latinos  https://t.co/wppYbzLVt2
1324665626762203136 2020-11-06 18:51:11 +0800 <imperium_v> @Lemondeselon1 Revenge of the nerds becomes reality
1324663949090983938 2020-11-06 18:44:31 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ Yeah true, I didn‚Äôt intend to come across as serious more taking the piss.  For sure wouldn‚Äôt have dropped cash if I didn‚Äôt have it spare. I just like the ride on occasion
1324663160318566401 2020-11-06 18:41:23 +0800 <imperium_v> @Lemondeselon1 I‚Äôm finding it interesting in a way they‚Äôve really thrown everything at this one. Even I‚Äôm kinda surprised. Actually can‚Äôt even guess but pulling the plug at a critical moment  makes sense
1324661730727747584 2020-11-06 18:35:42 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ Yeah? We‚Äôll see  I don‚Äôt mind either way you win some you lose some   Tbh more concerned about various prominent pedophiles taking it easy for the next 4 years.   Also concerned about how profoundly retarded large segment of population is.
1324653896342659072 2020-11-06 18:04:34 +0800 <imperium_v> Thanks Americans. Thanks for nothing.  https://t.co/E41fuYeMab

1324648270564528132 2020-11-06 17:42:13 +0800 <imperium_v> Well I guess the Wignats got their way. So what‚Äôs next fellas? Please let me know your concrete plans. Cheers
1324543328172433409 2020-11-06 10:45:12 +0800 <imperium_v> Observing the order of emotions last couple of days seems to have followed the boom and bust market cycle cheat sheet to a T.  https://t.co/wsRPwC9an7
1324369710796845058 2020-11-05 23:15:19 +0800 <imperium_v> The will of Silicon Valley must be mercilessly crushed.
1324241190267482112 2020-11-05 14:44:37 +0800 <imperium_v> There is no telling on the grand plan. Some things that seem to be poor outcomes are often required for better. Outcomes that appear excellent often lead to great ruin.
1324232097846816769 2020-11-05 14:08:29 +0800 <imperium_v> @rice_aroma They‚Äôre like rabbits. Mad respect to the Amish.
1324231263142596608 2020-11-05 14:05:10 +0800 <imperium_v> If natural selection is true, and I suspect it is; progressives will die out soon. The Amish will inherit the earth and a new golden Amish age will ensure in the US. All shall bow before them and pay homage to the golden horse-and-buggy
1324230305411026944 2020-11-05 14:01:22 +0800 <imperium_v> Don‚Äôt fall for their tricks, don‚Äôt play into their pre-constructed narratives. They want you to. You are entirely the owner of your own frame of mind and will.  You‚Äôre men. You‚Äôre not children. Be clever.
1324229552994877440 2020-11-05 13:58:23 +0800 <imperium_v> Stay classy American frogs. Stoic and masculine, committed for the long game. Use your wits, guile.  Not shrill and emotionally unstable like the enemy. Differentiate yourself by your superiority of character and spirit. You‚Äôre a solid oak tree withstanding their raging tempest.
1323984032707739654 2020-11-04 21:42:46 +0800 <imperium_v> @Lemondeselon1 Here‚Äôs hoping.
1323981102755831809 2020-11-04 21:31:07 +0800 <imperium_v> @Lemondeselon1 Shortsighted. Will be pretty funny when Kamala cuts off their internut revenues. Adults would vote for the lesser of 2 evils.  Plays into my theory about childish character traits. I Wonder if they‚Äôve ever held a job that required negotiation.
1323979915474075649 2020-11-04 21:26:24 +0800 <imperium_v> @v_suburbensis Yes for sure. I don‚Äôt disagree fundamentally either. Just reckon everyone needs to take a look around them and realise there are certain realities in life right now. I agree with BAP. You want this world? you get rich &amp; dirty.   As an oldish person I can see this is the only way.
1323977968163549184 2020-11-04 21:18:40 +0800 <imperium_v> @derga_s I saw quite a bit on the TL for sure. No one in particular I shall name as meanness isn‚Äôt the goal.
1323977384840687623 2020-11-04 21:16:21 +0800 <imperium_v> @Lemondeselon1 Yeah I mean it‚Äôs true; vote wise it doesn‚Äôt matter as there‚Äôs like 3 wignats nationwide however it reveals a lot about personal character. Again most are young and I get it. Simplicity is appealing. No one like conceding. Me least of all.
1323976889761890306 2020-11-04 21:14:23 +0800 <imperium_v> The world is a difficult playground. You won‚Äôt win by getting salty and blurting out puritanical ideology. Revealing your cards. No one cares as you have no power at all.   As a dissident if that‚Äôs what you are, study stealth, guile, learn to negotiate. Make concessions as needed
1323976039920365571 2020-11-04 21:11:00 +0800 <imperium_v> I don‚Äôt fault them hugely, in my youth I was extreme in my views and didn‚Äôt realise how difficult it is to negotiate with others to get some of what you want. It‚Äôs just the way the world is. No use throwing your toys out of the cot and demanding something unrealistic.
1323975357968445441 2020-11-04 21:08:18 +0800 <imperium_v> My new view is, don‚Äôt think Wignats as such will ever impact anything. They roll over too easily, they have the childish notion that if they don‚Äôt get everything now exactly how they want they‚Äôll refuse to participate. Think many are just woke leftists that happen to be racist.
1323969773298876416 2020-11-04 20:46:06 +0800 <imperium_v> Anyway fellas - don‚Äôt despair. Ultimately, important work for yourselves and your communities will go on. Meaningful bonds forged &amp; lives fulfilled. All is truly ephemeral, impermanent. As aberrations of eternal principle, the enemy live in suffering and delusion. Remember:  https://t.co/M7RKFRyjO9
1323967527467196416 2020-11-04 20:37:11 +0800 <imperium_v> Either way one thing is for sure. Everyone will be at each other‚Äôs throats and rich pricks will get way richer as they have been. Peoples liberty, right or left, will now be eroded and an increasingly alarming pace.
1323966837483163648 2020-11-04 20:34:26 +0800 <imperium_v> I think as a nefarious billionaire, you‚Äôd be perceiving society, plebs etc like having a few ant colonies in fish tanks in your garage.
1323965791419576321 2020-11-04 20:30:17 +0800 <imperium_v> How delightfully devilish of them.
1323965670682361857 2020-11-04 20:29:48 +0800 <imperium_v> An almost perfect 50/50 split. It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs a mechanism within the organism that creates this condition. And they know it and how to use it; to create advantageous division.
1323964907058913280 2020-11-04 20:26:46 +0800 <imperium_v> Now I think about it this is perfect for certain groups.  A delegitimised election; either way, chaos for weeks, civil unrest.   And perfect context and excuse for greater martial control, lockdowns and implementation of further controls.   Perhaps this was the plan from day 1.
1323962254509797378 2020-11-04 20:16:14 +0800 <imperium_v> ‚ÄúBrainwashing‚Äù the masses pre-supposes the masses possess brains.   A more accurate metaphor; simmering mussels in a white wine and saffron broth.   Sapid and delectable results for the cook.
1323938903238217729 2020-11-04 18:43:26 +0800 <imperium_v> Lol it‚Äôs amazing seeing the sentiment flip constantly on this.   Mostly by scared and tired people who have no fucking idea what they‚Äôre talking about and are jittering around like menopausal women.
1323935945117192192 2020-11-04 18:31:41 +0800 <imperium_v> Whoever wins, the work continues.
1323927932977377280 2020-11-04 17:59:51 +0800 <imperium_v> I think we‚Äôre seeing the effects of sleep deprivation and fried brain circuitry right now.   Go to sleep motherfuckers you‚Äôre not thinking straight. Relax. It‚Äôs. It going anywhere.   there won‚Äôt be that one tweet.
1323927639145394182 2020-11-04 17:58:41 +0800 <imperium_v> Never get hypnotised by a fancy title. Trust me.   Many of the walking fancy titles I know were once the same kids licking the bus window on the way to the local special school.
1323921280161124352 2020-11-04 17:33:25 +0800 <imperium_v> At the end of day for all the titles and ‚Äúsecret ID‚Äôs‚Äù the glow nagger DERP state and so called elites are just people, right?  They cry they laugh they shit their pants they consume newborns, just like all of us.   Yet everyone acts as if they‚Äôre invincible reptilian overlords

It is a statement that assumes engagement with life already, and refers to strategy or plan for someone who is stuck or over active, and is not sure on a situation, how to act; also note ‚Äúoften‚Äù.  It does not mean sit around a pop pills and feel sad.

Modern politics, despite what some say, doesn‚Äôt concern itself with quality of type or transcendence.  Modern disagreements on how to facilitate this ease, on emphasis, are largely insignificant.

1320020082282516480 2020-10-24 23:11:27 +0800 <imperium_v> @chungathustra modernity requires constant pruning.
1320017314364813317 2020-10-24 23:00:27 +0800 <imperium_v> Also think - a great man must, as a requirement to bring about wrathful cataclysm stand outside of history, he must exit its inertia - to do so is necessary to understand it's width and breadth, and the ultimate futility of its narrative. Thus the great man breaks the world anew.
1320015158240931840 2020-10-24 22:51:53 +0800 <imperium_v> @chungathustra @aevolist Agree, historicity can be degenerating force &amp; really see ref to Nietzsche as critique of progressivism, trad school usually rails against also. History as vice of overly literate cultures, relgio-history/myth as a force of pre-literate cultures, or "beasts" as per Nietzsche.
1320012485487816704 2020-10-24 22:41:15 +0800 <imperium_v> @aevolist Agreed with much also, yet...I can't seperate idea of "cycles" &amp; his emergence of "elites bringing disorder or subversion". It seems really the same thing. Even if one stands "outside" and realises what is wrong, it appears to remain mostly inevitable, historically.

1317410821752852480 2020-10-17 18:23:10 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ for sure because the anglosphere has always been about economics. It's the same here. the political and economic are really the same. It's really about promoting NESTING, CONGESTING AND DIGESTING AND DEBTING - if you're a parasite living off mankind, you need more of them.
1317409908099145728 2020-10-17 18:19:33 +0800 <imperium_v> Being in a business myself - I can see boomer to millennial demographics are an issue. they're thinking is like, damn they're not borrowing or breeding. What do we do?  It's a simple explanation. no global conspiracy. Just selfish greedy human behaviour.
1317409464530563073 2020-10-17 18:17:47 +0800 <imperium_v> Maybe I'm bias but the older I get the harder it is for me to believe there is a cohesive, super-intelligent elite who are consciously driving this. Lowly, wicked, selfish reasons such as boomers retirements make much more sense to me...tho as I said I'm sure there are elements.
1317408890623963138 2020-10-17 18:15:30 +0800 <imperium_v> I'm guilty of this also, people tend to ascribe sinister Millenia long blood feud type reasons for...groups... encouraging mass migration.   perhaps..  Now I think - people aren't breeding and the only way they can keep the balance sheet shitshow going is by bringing people in.

1316712065680109568 2020-10-15 20:06:34 +0800 <imperium_v> @psychedral yeah I agree, i think ultimately that's what they need to do. The system's ridiculous.
1316711507460120576 2020-10-15 20:04:21 +0800 <imperium_v> yeeeeeh ha @v_suburbensis remember?
1316710396200325122 2020-10-15 19:59:56 +0800 <imperium_v> @psychedral Yes precisely - which is why the Fed is probably mistaken and their strategy isn't working. People's private debt is too high so they're not borrowing , same with businesses. They're paying down. That's why it's deflationary. They're kicking can down road.
1316709338212229133 2020-10-15 19:55:44 +0800 <imperium_v> @TheCryptoDog time
1316707149196607489 2020-10-15 19:47:02 +0800 <imperium_v> @psychedral here's a thread that might help demystify how it works. For sure it's corrupt, and they don't care about people. Probably other conspiratorial explanations like destroying SME's so Amazog can flourish - I'm open to.
1316704786629107712 2020-10-15 19:37:38 +0800 <imperium_v> @psychedral If you pay businesses direct, they will pay down debt - deflationary.  If Fed buys a toxic bond of a bank, replace it with reserves for bank lend against -lend to business and expand credit, this will spike inflation. This is what they seek, since banks create money through debt.
1316703946493181952 2020-10-15 19:34:18 +0800 <imperium_v> @psychedral Hyper inflation maybe...stagflation. However this is not happening right now, no inflation. For the Fed deflation, right now, is the devil. Deflation signals credit contraction, Inflation - credit expansion which supports asset prices and business - again in their minds.
1316702400497950721 2020-10-15 19:28:10 +0800 <imperium_v> @psychedral i don't agree with them, I'm just explaining their thinking. They're stuck in a 50 year long debt trap, they're doing anything they can to spike inflation. They're obsessed with it.
1316702079583309824 2020-10-15 19:26:53 +0800 <imperium_v> @psychedral They're worried about asset prices and deflation mostly.  It seems illogical but it's not - boomers in the US make 71 million people. All wealth tied up in equities and housing. If deflation occurs it will completely destroy the entire US economy and boomers retirement.

The People have used prior COVID payments to pay down debt - this is creating deflation. What they‚Äôre trying to avoid.   The ponzi requires credit expansion.

1315108991601532928 2020-10-11 09:56:31 +0800 <imperium_v> My own view is the main driver of the mass humanity is the will to control.   I see this as slightly different from pursuit of power.   Think of a cat that isn‚Äôt hungry playing with a mouse.

1314786352781692928 2020-10-10 12:34:28 +0800 <imperium_v> @grstmill Yeah people are sick.   I can accept that.   The part that annoys me is how they survive...get by ok...and even thrive in this world. God and I have regular arguments on the necessity of this. He assures me it is.
1314783793337647104 2020-10-10 12:24:18 +0800 <imperium_v> @grstmill Yeah they‚Äôre complete rubbish. Anyone that says otherwise is a moron.   Big cities, assume you‚Äôre in one as am I, are a desert. Just the ego on them for being completely average. Stunning.
1314781638312640512 2020-10-10 12:15:44 +0800 <imperium_v> @grstmill Yeah I agree.  Personally I prefer the T777 ice palace. It‚Äôs where I live. Still...  I see it as simple - do they enhance you or do they diminish you. Most are diminishing. Cut out the ones that diminish you. Abstract puritanical ‚Äúshould be‚Äôs‚Äù are a waste of time.
1314778881476366337 2020-10-10 12:04:47 +0800 <imperium_v> @grstmill Nowhere is immune from the rot.   I for one have no fucks to give anymore, and most are beyond saving.

1314175465226006529 2020-10-08 20:07:01 +0800 <imperium_v> A debt based monetary system has never worked. Ever.
1314175276650127361 2020-10-08 20:06:16 +0800 <imperium_v> central banks cannot print money. The fed does not print money. ok?
1314174654093815808 2020-10-08 20:03:48 +0800 <imperium_v> government is stimulus gutting production. Government borrowing money takes money out of the total pool, so individuals have less. This by definition is deflationary. As government size increases, opportunity for individual decreases. this not libertardian this due 2 money supply
1314173887702130690 2020-10-08 20:00:45 +0800 <imperium_v> central banking is literally a con game. There is literally nothing other than pure psychology, and thus ignorance of what central banks can do, driving everything. Everything.

1313680885951074304 2020-10-07 11:21:44 +0800 <imperium_v> @grstmill It‚Äôs amazing also even seasoned investors have no idea about federal reserve operations and how money is created and circulated.
1313680613023518720 2020-10-07 11:20:39 +0800 <imperium_v> What makes this dangerous is that a debt based monetary system is effectively a giant Ponzi scheme. It requires greater levels of credit creation to sustain itself and monetary circulation.   This is why they‚Äôll try UBI. This will be the death knell for freedom from gov.
1313679853074358272 2020-10-07 11:17:38 +0800 <imperium_v> The fed and banks know this.   Investors do not.   People are already laden with debt. They don‚Äôt want to borrow more, banks have too many bad loans, they don‚Äôt want to lend more.  So you tell me how effective this will be.
1313679339716669441 2020-10-07 11:15:36 +0800 <imperium_v> Data shows banks are not lending.  The fact markets rise on ‚Äúmoney printing‚Äù or ‚Äústimulus‚Äù news is the imagination of investors, pure psychology.   The fed is actually mostly impotent under the current legislation, unless the public borrow and the banks lend. They‚Äôre not.
1313678503506636801 2020-10-07 11:12:16 +0800 <imperium_v> ‚ÄúPrinting money‚Äù isn‚Äôt really what seems. All the fed does is provide ‚Äúreserves‚Äù for banks on an internal balance sheet. The ‚Äúmoney‚Äù never ‚Äúleaves‚Äù the fed actually.   QE effectively does nothing unless the bank with the jacked up reserve account creates loans and lends.

I feel sorry for mongol horses carrying me.
1312057474556411905 2020-10-02 23:50:53 +0800 <imperium_v> @Godsfool3 done. just copied this down.   also he was saying there's black guy that reckons the buddha was black?   I said I'd host this debate, since it sounds completely retarded and heaps of fun.

1311642956873392129 2020-10-01 20:23:44 +0800 <imperium_v> @real_thomas777 I agree. I have not considered psychopathology in this sense, will think. Think average garden variety neurotics almost exclusively mother.

1310803088672870401 2020-09-29 12:46:24 +0800 <imperium_v> @dartingfar Even creating them when they never existed historically. It is indeed a sneaky trick.
1310801430605778945 2020-09-29 12:39:49 +0800 <imperium_v> the consistent assumption in modern therapy is that indeed there is even a stable self that something was done to. I prefer the Buddhist conception, that the self is inherently illusory anyway.
1310800400476299264 2020-09-29 12:35:43 +0800 <imperium_v> The entire Western Academy now encourages the opposite; a concerted focus on &amp; collecting of "bad experiences" and "injustices" and  strongly focusing on them, reliving them, creating them - absurdly, even if one was not even present for the alleged traumas enacted.
1310799524613373952 2020-09-29 12:32:14 +0800 <imperium_v> This is something religion has known for the ages, deenergizing patterns and dissociatively contextualizing experience is (from a materialist perspective) an excellent evolutionary adaption for managing environmental stress.
1310798535428718594 2020-09-29 12:28:18 +0800 <imperium_v> I think Freud was correct when he asserted that 'neuroses is primarily reminiscence'. This comports with modern evidence showing the futility of the therapy aiming to release trauma by reactivating it.  Better to briefly examine, disassociate, distinguish now &amp; rebuild.
1310791951373840390 2020-09-29 12:02:09 +0800 <imperium_v> Marx was wrong when he said "for man, the root of man is man himself." Our roots are ecological &amp; cosmological. These roots stretch far beyond man himself, beyond time and form.  It is here reverence for life can be found.
1310789228658212866 2020-09-29 11:51:20 +0800 <imperium_v> All models are completely inadequate.

1310527797111128066 2020-09-28 18:32:29 +0800 <imperium_v> For anyone investigating possible "escape hatches" should the war be totally lost...if you know what I mean.    https://t.co/tEQ19fEBB5
1310480437656002560 2020-09-28 15:24:18 +0800 <imperium_v> after this weekends drunken performance I understand again the chimpout; in my own small, yet non-destructive and jolly way.  Surely these recent pent up energies, on both sides of the blind Simian coin, demand proportionate release in the future.  how can elites stop this.
1310479411783688192 2020-09-28 15:20:13 +0800 <imperium_v> People may assert that concepts and word use count for nothing; some say everything.   Nevertheless, if you're dysfunctional they change nothing.   You require tools to unwind yourself. Thought &amp; conceptualization &amp; consideration are adjunct, not panacea.
1310478518707343360 2020-09-28 15:16:41 +0800 <imperium_v> In my view one of the greatest shortcomings of Western "thought" "philosophy" "religion", whatever, I've railed against this at length; is the negligible treatment of proper posturing...bearing...habitual poise...APLOMB  It is this that you can learn from parts of the East.
1310477375784722434 2020-09-28 15:12:08 +0800 <imperium_v> Master Okada says; The eyes need to be STRONG; but the head should not carry the strength of the body. Rather the abdomen, "Hara", is the psycho-physiological center of strength in the perfected individual.
1310476801504718848 2020-09-28 15:09:51 +0800 <imperium_v> This is why I recommend sitting for frogs, without gay "Astral" or other imagination and visualization techniques.    Most of us need to learn how to sit right, and to perfect Hara; benefit enough is derived from this striving.  I have blogs on this.
1310476073721765888 2020-09-28 15:06:58 +0800 <imperium_v> Peoples self-defeating character, obstinance, weakness of all kinds, flat out delusion can probably be traced to poor postural &amp; physiological discipline. When the base is strong, the extremities are easily controlled. This is why Japanese emphasize posture in Zazen or Seiza.
1310473726660456450 2020-09-28 14:57:38 +0800 <imperium_v> Zen masters assert people who go into the sunshine with half open eyes are weak. There may be truth to this, but let us consider the facts here; The Japanese aren't known widely for their extended Palpebral fissure measurements...     nevertheless there is truth here.
1310472499478446080 2020-09-28 14:52:45 +0800 <imperium_v> According top Durkheim people breath 18 or more times a minute. One who is trained in Hara should be able to reduce this to 10.  effects on hormonal cascade long term are obvious.

1307579013112578048 2020-09-20 15:15:05 +0800 <imperium_v> @AnonLeoDiCaprio Yeah agreed as gym and mmacel it worries me not. That being said there‚Äôs a pre shake, during shake, and post shake, so it‚Äôs a little exy.
1307575576429903872 2020-09-20 15:01:25 +0800 <imperium_v> @AnonLeoDiCaprio Money wise per serving hard to say., I would say couple of bucks per shake. I didn‚Äôt worry about t maths and dropped 500 Smackers on it and got roughly couple of kg‚Äôs of each ingredient.
1307574304922431488 2020-09-20 14:56:22 +0800 <imperium_v> The pumps and extra strength I‚Äôve been getting out of this are insane. Never has a supplement stack worked so effectively. I‚Äôm blowing up. I am supplement skeptical but 5 stars. Only draw back is that it costs 100‚Äôs.

However I feel sorry for those who have served the community, soldiers etc, who see the security services enabling the destruction of those symbols they served under.

1305357331916439552 2020-09-14 12:06:54 +0800 <imperium_v> I'll clarify -  the dichotomy between "inner" and "outer", is false.  What people really mean to say, lacking clarity, is "imagination" and "reality".  Meditation is like any other discipline. It breaks "fantasizing".  Meditation is an act of pure will.

1305325551960301569 2020-09-14 10:00:38 +0800 <imperium_v> what is it with nibbas thinking "meditation" is "imagination" or "inward looking". I don't even know where to begin to mercilessly rip this uninformed notion to pieces.

1303545258513375232 2020-09-09 12:06:22 +0800 <imperium_v> BAP is right. I spent years percolating philosophy and practicing different traditions. This is the reason I can present what I do in my way.  You may emulate it for grift, but you will never be it.   Knowledge is worthless unless is becomes organic. In the blood. In the sinew.

1302140097752563712 2020-09-05 15:02:46 +0800 <imperium_v> @evilon2legs thanks...yeah timely reminder.
1302138188299862017 2020-09-05 14:55:11 +0800 <imperium_v> @evilon2legs true...there I go again ascribing higher meanings to plebs haha
1302138064282611712 2020-09-05 14:54:41 +0800 <imperium_v> maybe the difference is total freedom in the landscape, marked by definite spiritual boundaries, he lived within totality.  Sedentary is marked by stifled space and lack of freedom, marked by material malaise, a kind of self-imposed materialistic burden.
1302136548796768256 2020-09-05 14:48:40 +0800 <imperium_v> probably why the RW grabs onto IE studies so much...somewhere in the deep distant past, deep in the tribal consciousness of Europeans lies that feeling of vigorous nomadic freedom and well spring of meaning...as civilisation becomes a heavier and heavier burden, solidifies.
1302135469531000832 2020-09-05 14:44:23 +0800 <imperium_v> As Guenon says in ROQ marked by an accelerating solidification of the world "Cain finally and really slays Abel" meaning the sedentary finally slay the nomadic.

1301815883258454016 2020-09-04 17:34:27 +0800 <imperium_v> If you want to be something quantifiably better 1. Make sure you like being yourself and you‚Äôre not trying to be better to cope with self-hatred 2. Establish plan 3. Execute plan   thinking ‚Äúthe right things with the right group‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make you better
1301767616898322439 2020-09-04 14:22:40 +0800 <imperium_v> @grstmill Finished 2 now. Great books

1301158585473269760 2020-09-02 22:02:35 +0800 <imperium_v> rather watch Tom Bombadil character histories than listen to gay as fuck "political rants".

1301122694470017027 2020-09-02 19:39:58 +0800 <imperium_v> @alexandrijn from a physiological and psychological perspective it means you get less "fireworks" during the process and is thus safer for a Westerner. it removes the psychotic episodes.  you make a good reasonable point though, it's not something I'd thought about. Some gurus do it this way.
1301106356909305856 2020-09-02 18:35:03 +0800 <imperium_v> @NgoloTesla hope so
1301104865884516354 2020-09-02 18:29:08 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ by the way having this guy on soon. he goes into islam and how many of the early Islamic scholars were educated in central asian buddhistic colleges. explains the similarity with buddhism in terms of understanding absolute.   well worth a read:  https://t.co/MsIJrFvTnC
1301102934415929344 2020-09-02 18:21:27 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ that's interesting got no idea about any of that, listening now.
1301100784851927041 2020-09-02 18:12:55 +0800 <imperium_v> @elaphos_ Harry loves this guy, thanks for the link.
1301090915356876802 2020-09-02 17:33:41 +0800 <imperium_v> Importantly, Reich did not undergo his own therapy.   Reich had paranoid delusions at the end of his life.   Freud also refused to analyse Reich.   Remain skeptical of Reich's crazy claims for this reason.   Reichs therapy stands aside from Reich since it is not totally of Reich.
1301089430598422528 2020-09-02 17:27:47 +0800 <imperium_v> Viewing Reich in his right context is important. I consider it very valuable. You need to understand the point of origin and where he wanted to get, or you will make mistakes with emphasis in practice. If you read and understand, I have saved you engaging with his errors.
1301088506303803393 2020-09-02 17:24:07 +0800 <imperium_v> If this makes people salty: so be it. I've worked his method for over a decade and continue to on a daily basis.   That's more work, yes work, than most have done. more experience with these methods than most have.   Want to stick with delusions like he did? Go right ahead.
1301088083220201472 2020-09-02 17:22:26 +0800 <imperium_v> This idea that Wilhelm Reich found something new in orgone is nonsense.   There are elements of his therapy that include some new elements and procedures, but overall the techniques are ancient and have been around forever.
1301087468763004928 2020-09-02 17:20:00 +0800 <imperium_v> Received first spagyrics today from guest PA. look forward to trying and working in with new overall spiritual and physical supremacy routine.

1301063923270000641 2020-09-02 15:46:26 +0800 <imperium_v> I talk of Wilhelm Reich, his attempt to subvert powerful ancient forces into biological Marxoid-Nibbana. Have promised this one for a while. So I'd like to clarify a few things.  Last one for a while, working on specialised guided meditations rn.      https://t.co/zSMTgQO4dR

1300759840193536001 2020-09-01 19:38:07 +0800 <imperium_v> in terms of doing good I reckon history shows clearly you probably only want to do a little bit of good.   you live in the dark ages and you'll get well and truly fisted by the filthy masses if you do too much.
1300758950195859458 2020-09-01 19:34:35 +0800 <imperium_v> oh look at that 500 followers thanks all I sincerely hope you all get something tangible out of the materials essays podcathst that was always the intention.   as some big projects start gaining critical mass, the actualisation of the vision I want to bring only just beginning.
1300756677923201024 2020-09-01 19:25:33 +0800 <imperium_v> I got an artikal coming out tomorrow "On The Misdeeds of Wilhelm Reich" (proofreading rn) and no it's probably not what you're thinking.   Not the whole lame "uh its muh joos" thing everyone always craps on about.   no no that's right it runs much deeper than that my friends.  https://t.co/XPqxZUgRke
