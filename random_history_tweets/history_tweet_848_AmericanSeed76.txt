1343375292312727553 2020-12-28 09:56:43 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> 1) baseball players wear helmets. 2) themes have a complete face-lift in FO and now are the most powerful team in the U.S.   Not really comparable  at this point. Good try though.

1339452393235333121 2020-12-17 14:08:31 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Also if you add Ichiro's Japanese league numbers to his MLB stats is idiotic. That is a league that is on par with  AAA ball. So many struggling MLB players go down there to revitalize or end their careers. It is in comparable.
1339450814683881473 2020-12-17 14:02:14 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Glad the Negro League is getting the recognition it deserves but this will change the history books and make things weird. It is already screwed up bc of steroids, this will make things more complicated
1339439082909409281 2020-12-17 13:15:37 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @ZaidJilani @TaylorTwellman this was taken in July around the time you were calling for the cancelation of Independence Day  "who wants to celebrate this county?" üôÑ
1339438327246798848 2020-12-17 13:12:37 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> What about the people who were demonizing and attacking their political rival for four years while black balling and trying to for culture change based on outrage calling for compliance and truce bc their guy won(questionable). That is hypocrisy at it's height.
1339435646306365441 2020-12-17 13:01:58 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You are a liar. No conservative believes this bc it is stupid and evil. You really want NY and California to dictate to the nation? You are an assclown.

1339358302514376706 2020-12-17 07:54:38 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Leave kids alone. They don't care about your sick delusions. Entertain them and make them laugh. Stop with this propaganda. The person who allowed this is sick shame on you.

1338944670676750337 2020-12-16 04:31:00 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> True, he only freed ever African American. He clearly could careless about black people. Fuck you San Francisco.
1338913430011572231 2020-12-16 02:26:52 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Christophobes at it again with the erroneous and evil tax the churches hashtag. The losers want to enough the government on the church bc they do not want religious freedom for all they are evil. Btw why aren't there bs hashtags about taxing Temples or Mosque? Straight up evil.
1338912382886834179 2020-12-16 02:22:42 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Nope, don't force anyone to do something they don't want. There is no reason for a delay. European soccer and  NFL,  went on as normal. MLB has no excuse.

1336781400524132353 2020-12-10 05:14:56 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The amount of drugs you have to be onto want to live in LA must be high.
1336779122014625793 2020-12-10 05:05:53 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> In ten years angry rioters will see it call him an "evil colonizer", spray paint it, and tear it down.   Seriously he does deserve it. Man gave it all for SKC.
1336775706882306052 2020-12-10 04:52:19 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> I think he has a good point but there is a risk to signing Tanaka. The UCL still has a tear he could be one pitch away from a long IL stint.

1335471416381202433 2020-12-06 14:29:32 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @Disney @disneyplus can you make a movie that doesn't have an agenda behind it. Seems like you are trying way too hard to dismantle everything Disney was built upon. You have no shame. Walt would be embarrassed by you @RobertIger.

1334375204479524864 2020-12-03 13:53:34 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> What do you think of Christmas Vacation?
1334347966086340609 2020-12-03 12:05:20 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> That is the sign of a lunatic.
1334341477099507712 2020-12-03 11:39:33 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> What about "Christmas Vacation"?
1334320174258921472 2020-12-03 10:14:54 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @AEW @Sting @UnsatiatedBlood Sting has a multi-year contract with AEW.
1333878512026054658 2020-12-02 04:59:54 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> So Ellen Page wants to pretend she is a dude. Waiting for the liberal to tell her she is a privileged white man or does being mentally ill make you immune to such criticism?

1333772460261584897 2020-12-01 21:58:29 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Idk when it will start seems like it will be delayed bc the league always finds a way to make things harder than needed.
1333772456482529282 2020-12-01 21:58:28 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Yes, they already played during this why should the NHL not play now? Also the NBA has a plan in place they did not consider letting they year go to waste why should the NHL? Every important league on earth has gone on or is going on. No need for the NHL to back out.
1333768072776265733 2020-12-01 21:41:03 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Rangers win all day even in the comments Rangers win but man. Asslander fans show up to Twitter more than they do to their home games. Joke team even worse fan base.
1333765542130446339 2020-12-01 21:31:00 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Rangers has a classic uniform easily the best in the league. That joke organization has the ugliest uniform in league. Their NY looks like an m.

1333504907127779328 2020-12-01 04:15:19 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If wanting to win is scary or "eye raising" to you or anyone for that matter you are bound to be a loser.
1333273823660138496 2020-11-30 12:57:05 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> So shame the sickly? Real cool of you.

1332821856588587009 2020-11-29 07:01:07 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is a fact.
1332820707928059905 2020-11-29 06:56:34 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> She is just made she can't get her hands on a PS5. You and your parents suck @GretaThunberg.
1332819625294311424 2020-11-29 06:52:15 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Don't listen to a European or 12 year olds for any reason. They don't know much. Especially this one she is a brain washed gollum look alike.
1332818161301942275 2020-11-29 06:46:26 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @NHL and @NHLPA  get to work.  We want hockey sooner rather than later.

1331696081084833792 2020-11-26 04:27:42 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> It can, taxation is theft. Callahan signed for less than he asked the Rangers bc of taxes. NY sucks bc of taxes that is why people are fleeing it.

1325171358922276867 2020-11-08 04:20:47 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is the funniest thing you have done since you split your pants.
1325162955009384450 2020-11-08 03:47:23 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> He won't and if you look into how Harris got to where she is you would be mortified.
1325162547050328064 2020-11-08 03:45:46 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you voted for Biden than you do not believe all woman.
1325162407744860160 2020-11-08 03:45:12 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @KyleKashuv @JacobTrouba
1325156845095321602 2020-11-08 03:23:06 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Dude said poor ckids are as smart as white kids, called African Americans "super predators", is a segregationist, and was friends with the klan. So yeah character matters. üôÑ
1325156351027286018 2020-11-08 03:21:08 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @NYRangers are you going to censor Trouba like you did Tony?

1324857009817235456 2020-11-07 07:31:40 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You are what you called Trump. Facist. Stupid ass sandy always running here over used mouth.

1324812967448334337 2020-11-07 04:36:39 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @BrianWright86 Wonder if he keeps Rojas? He may just want a complete fresh start.

1324204384788557824 2020-11-05 12:18:22 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @GarysheffieldJr What has Brazil done to you?
1324148238203670535 2020-11-05 08:35:16 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If the Rangers are telling him he can't speak his mind but we can here athletes in different sports berating us with the opposing view the Rangers should be ashamed. Btw it is still cancel culture.
1324143980574027778 2020-11-05 08:18:21 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Funny thing is the people trashing DeAngelo will still cheer him when he scores. Bunch of hypocrites.
1324143764429000704 2020-11-05 08:17:29 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Celebrating cancel culture. Cool.
1324143104719495174 2020-11-05 08:14:52 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> So Tony should not voice his opinion bc other might disagree?

1323737977953112065 2020-11-04 05:25:02 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Just go there. It sucks as do you so you will fit in just fine.
1323150850852880385 2020-11-02 14:32:00 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you think Lincoln was a white supremacists you should not be allowed to vote.
1323150340687073280 2020-11-02 14:29:58 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Literally impossible but idiots will believe it.
1323147711152095232 2020-11-02 14:19:31 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is what happenes when dumbasses vote. Lincoln freed the slave but he is a supremacist. The education system has failed.
1323144923621826561 2020-11-02 14:08:27 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> What do you call the people burning down cities? Rather be a chump that an assclown like you and antifa.
1322788989896695810 2020-11-01 14:34:06 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is beyond safety limits but Biden supporters bring down cities keep you quiet? Joke. üôÑ
1322788706164609024 2020-11-01 14:32:58 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you feel threatened by Trump supports driving ne t to Biden's bus but cool with Biden supporters buring down cities you are a lost cause.
1322718709337755650 2020-11-01 09:54:49 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Oh shut up. If you think that is facism you're truly stupid. You're opinion does not matter, stick to you irrelevant nation.

1322714685674803200 2020-11-01 09:38:50 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> What is wrong with it? Do you ever stop crying?
1322402044507029506 2020-10-31 12:56:31 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The 38% that voted for the popular vote are morons.
1322401458508234752 2020-10-31 12:54:11 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Nope, leave the Indians alone.
1322247115444281345 2020-10-31 02:40:53 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You finally didn't screw something up. It's a miracle.
1321715664139227136 2020-10-29 15:29:05 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This makes you pro-Thanksgiving.
1321690505613332480 2020-10-29 13:49:07 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Funny that they are outraged by this but fine with violent riots. The media sucks.
1321667035370299399 2020-10-29 12:15:51 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Cowards. Stop giving in to the mob.

1321315779074236419 2020-10-28 13:00:05 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Leave Justin Turner alone. The guy just had biggest accomplishment of his life. There is no guarantee that he wins another and you want him to stay by himself for a sickness that has a 99.997 survival rate. Give me a break.
1321312248435036162 2020-10-28 12:46:03 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Congrats Justin. Get well soon. God Bless.

1320217333378502658 2020-10-25 12:15:15 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Btw communists are the most dumbest people and canadians are the lamest.
1320217073180704768 2020-10-25 12:14:13 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> When everything is voting suppression nothing is.

1319542088980115457 2020-10-23 15:32:04 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Espn is garbage. That loser mayor already said he will not block it. What does any of this have to do with the Mets gaining a financially stable owner? Most kids don't know or care who owns the team. Also were does Mets ownership fit  in with WNBA footwear? This is just so dumb.
1319416576609865728 2020-10-23 07:13:20 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The answer is no. Be mature and understand people are free to think for themselves.

1318333181456777219 2020-10-20 07:28:18 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @UnsatiatedBlood Ik but you are right. The government does not deserves any of our salaries let alone 62%. Hate the losers who love taxes or want this.
1318332758352158720 2020-10-20 07:26:37 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @UnsatiatedBlood you are asking the right question. Anyone defending taxes or are mad people want to keep their money are statist bitches.
1318332238577258496 2020-10-20 07:24:33 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Only idiots think that way. Taxation is theft.
1318260395841359873 2020-10-20 02:39:05 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> *gelatinous ho's
1318257417851949057 2020-10-20 02:27:15 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If all Christians are white supremacist than large section of the Latin and African American community has some explaining to do.
1318257416060940291 2020-10-20 02:27:14 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You must not know a single Christian if you believe this lie. Btw the White Supemacist claim is equally stupid. Christians don't care about race it is not even important to the faith.
1318257414127427584 2020-10-20 02:27:14 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> All of the people calling Chris Pratt a white supremacist or a homophobe bc he is Christian you are the bigot you claim he is. Christophobes believe anyone who worships Christians hates guys that is untrue and hateful. Every Christian has gay friends and many gays are Christian.
1318251861800091655 2020-10-20 02:05:10 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Agreed. Great catch but it is hard to watch knowing the end result.
1318004995476815872 2020-10-19 09:44:12 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Btw you'd ignore Biden rallies too... if anyone showed up.
1318004993245446144 2020-10-19 09:44:12 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you are claim people are going to get coronavirus and die  by going to Trump rallies, while being silent during a summer of riots and protest and the woman's march literally yesterday day you are stupid.
1318003615773216768 2020-10-19 09:38:43 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The left when you don't wear a mask: "You're killing grandma!  The left when your grandma supports Trump:
1317968793138769928 2020-10-19 07:20:21 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is a fact.
1317942868506517504 2020-10-19 05:37:20 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Theft is not cool or patriotic.
1317909731340652545 2020-10-19 03:25:40 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you are voting for higher taxes fuck you.
1317663765316370433 2020-10-18 11:08:17 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> How about not killing people who do?
1317652763095015424 2020-10-18 10:24:34 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Let's just stop property tax period.
1317642309270491136 2020-10-18 09:43:01 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Sushi is not food. Don't tell me other wise.
1317641635510030339 2020-10-18 09:40:21 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Thing about Trump haters they are more concerned with what he said and not what he done. That is the problem.
1317582770269523968 2020-10-18 05:46:26 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Congrats and God Bless.
1317568733678915585 2020-10-18 04:50:40 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Hill House &gt; Bly Manor not even close.
1317568626686414848 2020-10-18 04:50:14 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Womens March is just angry, ugly, unstable woman for baby murder march.
1317554342992502791 2020-10-18 03:53:29 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Take it as a compliment. Dude can't speak intelligently unless he is reading a script.
1317515211885207552 2020-10-18 01:17:59 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @Timcast @DaveBautista we should trust this man? Lol.  Idiot.
1317513175261192195 2020-10-18 01:09:53 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> No one cares what you need. It is called freedom. If I want to use an AR-15 to defend myself or my community I have every right to do so. Joe Biden and anyone who wants to restrict that can go fuck themseleves. Funny how you support restrictions but call Trump fascist. Hypocite.

1316221992782229505 2020-10-14 11:39:11 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is 100% accurate.
1316151195027808257 2020-10-14 06:57:52 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Btw we don't live in a democracy, we live in a Democratic Republic. Democracies tend suck.
1316150922133864448 2020-10-14 06:56:47 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If your argument is that "we live in modern times" you don't really have an argument.
1316096316875866112 2020-10-14 03:19:48 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is badass.
1315801648120377345 2020-10-13 07:48:53 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JackPosobiec There must be cake behind the camera.
1315795656078954498 2020-10-13 07:25:05 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you like che guevara, you have no right to bash Columbus.
1315793389342859264 2020-10-13 07:16:04 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is the only time you'd mention fruit you gelatinous mound.
1315793070718357505 2020-10-13 07:14:48 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @NHLBlackhawks these were not your fans don't cave to these cowards.
1315792313776590853 2020-10-13 07:11:48 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Columbus is awesome and colonialism is awesome. I hope all those crying about this enjoy living in a first world nation and the greatest country on earth.
1315747146822561792 2020-10-13 04:12:19 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Today you are an honorary Italian-American.
1315712770369826818 2020-10-13 01:55:43 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you offended by someone celebrating their heritage you are prejudice.
1315704848520798211 2020-10-13 01:24:15 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Italians have every right to be proud of their heritage. If you are offended that we celebrate on Columbus day, well screw you.
1315695096059363329 2020-10-13 00:45:29 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @ReggieCannon15 kneeled during the anthem in support of pedophile. He was wrong. Simple as that.
1315693219984953345 2020-10-13 00:38:02 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> NY and Cali have been going through hell for years that is why there are mass exodus going on from those states.
1315674111272775681 2020-10-12 23:22:06 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Happy Columbus Day!
1315550368215035905 2020-10-12 15:10:24 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Remember the Americas were violent mud holes before settlers got here and made both N &amp; S America beautiful and livable for centuries. You all are privileged to live here especially those who live in the USA, the greatest nation on earth.
1315548869900591106 2020-10-12 15:04:26 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> All these activists want to bash Columbus but ignore all the violence and injustice natives did to each other and others. Get over yourselves.
1315546316165001222 2020-10-12 14:54:18 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @tedwheeler resign from office and let someone who cares about their city take over. You should be ashamed of yourself.

1315368543471443969 2020-10-12 03:07:53 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you think Cleopatra was black or that everyone from the continent of Africa is black, idk what to tell you other than you are an idiot.
1315119808153870337 2020-10-11 10:39:30 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Fuck antifa and if you support them fuck you too.

1314985865324658699 2020-10-11 01:47:16 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Some one needs to kick her parents ass or call cps.
1314969429818646528 2020-10-11 00:41:57 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> No one cares what this European child has to say. Europeans are idiots that is why everyone of those nations are becoming unrecognizable and childeren don't understand politics. If you vote based on this you are hopeless.
1314809045744791555 2020-10-10 14:04:39 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @yeahrightgirlhg I have been saying this for years.

1314703973618716673 2020-10-10 07:07:07 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> And what about what Pelosi, Biden, Omar, AOC, Coumo, Newsome, Whitmer, and Harris gang's have to this nation from May to now? Give me a break.
1314696653581021185 2020-10-10 06:38:02 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @KeithOlbermann is a psycho. He has a history of mental illness and should not be taken seriously. Dude wants to prosecute people for support Trump this is what fascism looks like. Btw you call Trump a terrorist that what do you call blm and antifa? Assclown.
1314694074532802560 2020-10-10 06:27:47 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> When Biden supports claim Trump is not well it is laughable. Have you even paid attention to Joe?
1314642461432713217 2020-10-10 03:02:42 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This never would have happened under mayor @RudyGiuliani.

1314368676141953032 2020-10-09 08:54:46 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you think the President or Kyle Rittenhouse is a terrorist is  but think antifa and blm are not you are brain dead.
1314359224806367232 2020-10-09 08:17:13 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Coming from someone who supports @IlhanMN who has allegations of vote harvesting and buying votes in her last two elections. Alyssa is smart. Jk.
1314358629181648896 2020-10-09 08:14:51 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Just your daily reminder @Kaepernick7 is the dumbest man on earth. Everyone who follows him is equally stupid. Fuck off hypocrite.
1314319109132345345 2020-10-09 05:37:49 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Bc Rob Manfred.
1314318722396553216 2020-10-09 05:36:16 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Btw 3 of these things are not issues. The only thing that needs work is the economy and it is china's fault.  Blm and antifa did not help when they burn down businesses causing people to lose jobs needlessly btw.
1314318091787087873 2020-10-09 05:33:46 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You make jeans , focus on jeans.
1314279607353462786 2020-10-09 03:00:51 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you say this it is clear you never read the constitution. Murder never has been and never will be a right.

1313981126659182599 2020-10-08 07:14:47 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Everytime you tweet or even put out a song you prove no one should trust you. Every decision you make is bad. That's why you are utterly used up in more ways than one by the age of 30. You have a history of supporting predators in the Clintons, Kennedys, Ellen, &amp; now Biden. Cool.
1313923171838554112 2020-10-08 03:24:30 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> These peo people are mentally disturbed stop valuing their opinions. Don't act like they are special, they play pretend and are utter freaks.
1313755255558025217 2020-10-07 16:17:15 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> That would be a no.

1313539384520646664 2020-10-07 01:59:28 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @MichelleObama tell that to the countless businesses that were burned down in Kenosha, Minnesota, &amp; Portland. Tell that to the people murdered and beaten across the nation especially to David Dorn &amp; Secoria Turner's family. You are a disgrace.

1313344725290815489 2020-10-06 13:05:57 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Nope, the whole point about Batman is he will not cross that line. His discipline is the closest thing he has to a power.   Btw Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix already killed the joker.

1311753115947991041 2020-10-02 03:41:28 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> J.T. Realmuto, the guy has been consistently good through out his career. Bauer has had a career year paying him bc of one great year seems like a risk. Buaer never pitched this way before and now this season was too short. Idk if he could during a full season.
1311520126857076738 2020-10-01 12:15:39 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The longer we go without basketball the better.
1311450994753105921 2020-10-01 07:40:57 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This worst thing you can call anyone. Gary just brought the heat.

1311409697736491008 2020-10-01 04:56:51 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> To think someone out there wanted him to own the Mets. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
1311409283918172162 2020-10-01 04:55:12 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> With this dude's track record idk if he should ever call anyone a d-bag.

1311204419095191552 2020-09-30 15:21:09 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Even if you disagree you can still be civil to one and other.
1311202769831944193 2020-09-30 15:14:35 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday @NYFootyGuy I wil say this to you James. Even though we disagree, I am glad we had a civil discussion. No name calling or insults just a few guy with differing opinions just having a talk. Always been a fan and still am. We all want the best for our nation regardless of opinions.
1311201855842791424 2020-09-30 15:10:58 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday @NYFootyGuy Sure thing James. We have both agreed to disagree multiple times now. Think it is best we go our separate ways. Let's agree on this Trump talks like a toddler and it is expected. Alright. I am not a trump guy nor a biden guy.

1311198813034606592 2020-09-30 14:58:52 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @NYFootyGuy @JamesRoday What he said.
1311198441985454080 2020-09-30 14:57:24 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You should see my last condo. Literally showed this guy did not want to hear. It. Posted this dude said "why does this matter?"  https://t.co/Ic7vrPDAFC

1311197378339373056 2020-09-30 14:53:10 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> When you prove someone wrong but they want to keep talking walk away.
1311197257681821696 2020-09-30 14:52:41 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday Agreed to disagree. Best of luck to you.
1311196313447542784 2020-09-30 14:48:56 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday Fact check disagrees.  https://t.co/Ic7vrPDAFC
1311194735416152066 2020-09-30 14:42:40 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday @NYFootyGuy One Wallace asked it. He immediately said "Sure, I ould like to do that." Does not seem as if he endorsed it.
1311194389608312832 2020-09-30 14:41:17 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday Trump is not perfect hell I am not even a supporter but acting like he never once denounced it and wanting to replace him with a dementia patient seems like a bad idea.
1311194075220119553 2020-09-30 14:40:02 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday Way to keep it cordial.  The man literally says he denounced white supremacist but yeah fake news. Give me a break.
1311193676673093632 2020-09-30 14:38:27 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday Cool but what do you call an org that burns down the nation. Idk want a president who supporters endanger lives and business of innocent people. None of trumps supporters do that.
1311193215622696960 2020-09-30 14:36:38 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday Ik he said that. Will you acknowledge in the video I sent he clear denounce white supremacy? The fact that we act like he didn't is a problem. Btw the proud boy are lead by a biracial man. So...

1311190875939241984 2020-09-30 14:27:20 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @JamesRoday He literally said he would be willing to do it. Wallace never followed up. He just yelled.

1311188271951736833 2020-09-30 14:16:59 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you complain about the proud boys existing but ignore the violence of antifa and blm. Idon't know what to tell you.
1311187940924678144 2020-09-30 14:15:40 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Antifa who is supported by the former VP of the United States is burning down the nation. Let's vow to change the future and not support violence. Who cares about parties as long as there isn't fire and bloodshed.
1311187368536403968 2020-09-30 14:13:23 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You are not American your opinion on this topic is worthless.
1311164540906885123 2020-09-30 12:42:41 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Even ABC showed he did not refuse. Everybody stop lying.
1311153306400706561 2020-09-30 11:58:02 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Thank you. How did everyone miss this?
1311152531918249984 2020-09-30 11:54:58 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Why was the moderator trying g to debate?
1311152272492163072 2020-09-30 11:53:56 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Weaker is vastly incorrect that happened under Obama &amp; Biden  Sicker that came from China&amp; has a 99% survival rate.  Poorer no Trumps economy grew 4% consistently b4 China virus. Btw it grew below a 2% under Obama &amp; biden.   Divided &amp; violnce all by the leftist.

1311146249802874883 2020-09-30 11:30:00 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is the most accurate recap. Everyone must step up their games to get on this level.
1311143858886053888 2020-09-30 11:20:30 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> It is philly it is expected.
1311143753340551169 2020-09-30 11:20:05 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> All of you would not be able to vote or make fun of Trump if he were a dictator. I honestly don't think people know what that word means.
1311142936411803650 2020-09-30 11:16:50 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Yet, joe said he does not support that. Cool story.
1311141960061792257 2020-09-30 11:12:57 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Psa: no one cares who you are voting for and no one enjoys you telling others to vote. Shut up.
1311140596065669121 2020-09-30 11:07:32 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Seems that twitter is just going to be flooded with the lies for the rest of the night.
1311140055004704773 2020-09-30 11:05:23 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This made people want to vote more or for either?
1311139743074332672 2020-09-30 11:04:09 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> If you support BLM or Antifa you are just as bad as those who like the proud boys.
1311139134736666624 2020-09-30 11:01:44 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Coming from a black supremacist. You never deny blm of antifa. Btw he clearly said sure when asked if he would.
1311138090942164994 2020-09-30 10:57:35 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> I keep see people saying Trump refused to condem white supremacy but the first thing that came out of his mouth when asked if he would was "Sure" then he went on about antifa. Idk if people are deaf only hearing what they want.
1311094350546382848 2020-09-30 08:03:46 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Tbf this group is not too far. The future is bright with this young group. Best of luck to Hank.

1310782926980775936 2020-09-29 11:26:17 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @RealMickFoley wants more of this. Dude really lost more than his teeth.
1310782328613015552 2020-09-29 11:23:54 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is what happens when you get too many head shots.
1310782053659676673 2020-09-29 11:22:49 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Sounds like a pretty bad idea. Idk why anyone would want Texas to be like NY or cali those places suck.that is why everyone is ditching.

1310344061929369601 2020-09-28 06:22:24 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Fuck you and your concentration camps. You are evil and the world knows it. Tell pooh to suck it.

1310286821562167296 2020-09-28 02:34:56 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> When media and the elite support your stupid cause you are not the resistance. It is amazing how leftists don't know that. Then again they don't know much.
1310285277567619072 2020-09-28 02:28:48 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The party that defends Antifa and BLM two groups who have been burning down the nation for months on end &amp; the party that loves baby murder really know all about courage, kindness, empathy, strenghth, kindness &amp; respect.   This is Dwayne's worst acting &amp; he was in scorpion king.
1310281552753053696 2020-09-28 02:14:00 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The way you run your state should make you sick. Loser.

1309570769240944641 2020-09-26 03:09:36 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Ranger fans should be happy about the future instead they want to whine bc the inevitable is happening.
1309567812596305923 2020-09-26 02:57:51 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> BTW I don't want Igor to be Herik 2.0. I want him to win.
1309566997177528321 2020-09-26 02:54:37 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This man is stupid. Good bye.
1309566782773121024 2020-09-26 02:53:46 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Nah. Igor legit sucks. üôÑ
1309560060247506946 2020-09-26 02:27:03 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> You think that is bad all I said was the NYR have a bright future and I  got this.
1309557924411461633 2020-09-26 02:18:34 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Me: Henrik was great but it is time to move on. Don't be upset Igor's has potential to be just as good. Future is bright.  Hockey "fans":  https://t.co/8YpUQeghCD
1309554206458732550 2020-09-26 02:03:47 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Hell some claim the Rangers wouldn't have been out of the 1st round most years if not for him. Lol. Not like they were a top 3 team in the East every from 2012-15. It is laughable. The Rangers should have won at least two cups but choked multiple times. Give me a break.
1309554204973899777 2020-09-26 02:03:47 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Seeing hockey fans claim Lundqvist never had a "legit" defense (see 2012-15) is a joke and just straight up proves these fans are absent minded and have no clue what they are talking about.
1309552782366724099 2020-09-26 01:58:08 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Igor was a huge part of the rangers turn around this year. He  stole games for this team. Multiple times having 50 save wins in games where they were out played. Btw how quick did Hank get the nickname the king? Give me a break.
1309550955235598336 2020-09-26 01:50:52 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The people who find having faith in the future as disrespectful are utter idiots. Henrik was great but has declined and is no way the goalie the Rangers should use as a starter going forward. Igor is great and has a bright future. No need to cry.
1309550192660750336 2020-09-26 01:47:50 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> I did not say he would. I said he could. No doubt Hank is great but Igor has a ceiling just as high. Ranger fans have every right to be confident in the future.

1309284931584098308 2020-09-25 08:13:47 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @IgorShesterKING I would be fore that. Love to see him around in some capacity. Especially if the team can get him a cup that way.
1309261980235173900 2020-09-25 06:42:35 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> How about not supporting an organization that claims white people are "subhuman", want to collapse the U.S. economy, and destroy the nuclear family? Stop supporting this evil organization.

Don't cry for the past when the future is very bright. #NYR
1309255237438500866 2020-09-25 06:15:48 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> As a Rangers fan I love Henrik Lundqvist but people need to stop crying about his inevitable departure. The guy was great but in no way shape or form should the team have him as their starter or even tepaking up a spot when he has clearly declined over the years.
1308846369604620289 2020-09-24 03:11:06 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @KingJames is a pos. Simple as that dude is racist and supports evil consistently.

1307926958911754241 2020-09-21 14:17:41 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Colby Covington pushing his beliefs bad but almost every sports league pushing the opposite view acceptable. Cool double standards.
1307899153314439168 2020-09-21 12:27:12 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This coming b from the guy who claimed he was happy his mom aborted his sibling. @MarkRuffalo is all about compassion. Joke.
1307537125945094145 2020-09-20 12:28:38 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> When Eminem tries to be political it is hilarious. Dude can barely speak English and rapped about shooting kids in "rap god." Joke.
1307177075615375360 2020-09-19 12:37:55 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This just proves the point canadians should not be taken seriously. Best way to be intelligent, don't be canadian.   Your county accomplished absolutely nothing but we should start over? Assclown.

1304956997973037056 2020-09-13 09:36:07 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> With this being said. Let me be clear Aj Styles is and always has been a better wrestler than cm punk.
1304471905857146886 2020-09-12 01:28:32 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Remember those who were lost 19 years ago today, remember the families and the heros. Remember that feeling of unity and love. Stand united. God Bless America.  https://t.co/I4IaZRDYUd
1304246737490636800 2020-09-11 10:33:48 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @GarysheffieldJr Do the opposite of what you have been doing.
1304230647171624960 2020-09-11 09:29:52 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Good for the fans.
1303927595285839874 2020-09-10 13:25:39 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Amazing, that climate change only burns California. You don't take care of your state and need a boogeyman.
1303750545635717131 2020-09-10 01:42:07 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is how stupid @Trevornoah is. Dude your gender is determined by what is in your pants. Idiot.   Does anyone remember the many antisemitic tweets this loser put out.
1303190041624293377 2020-09-08 12:34:52 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Best meme on twitter this year.
1302837641973567488 2020-09-07 13:14:34 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> No.
1302698824608120832 2020-09-07 04:02:57 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @LifeNewsHQ @StudentsforLife @matt_dumba
1302697635715977216 2020-09-07 03:58:13 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The least deserving person is @matt_dumba he is a race baiter who literally does nothing for his community. NHL will gift him the King Clancy to appease woke losers.

1302490434300776448 2020-09-06 14:14:53 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> @UnsatiatedBlood @WRESTLEZONEcom Ik. I thought he was tko'd or worse. He didn't move for a good minute. Should have just stopped the match really hope matt is ok.
1301804095708291075 2020-09-04 16:47:37 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Listen to this, you won't regret it.   @ZubyMusic song is awesome.
1301277285060882432 2020-09-03 05:54:15 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This is actually bad news. Show has not been good in decades.
1300898403019354114 2020-09-02 04:48:43 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> How can anyone not be a fan of @thunderrosa22?
1300703912857608192 2020-09-01 15:55:53 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> This dude thinks Walsh's beliefs indoctrinate people and cause others to get hurt. Lol who is burning down the cities again?
1300701601129267201 2020-09-01 15:46:42 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Ow, that really hurt my feeling. How will I recover?
1300673904978034688 2020-09-01 13:56:38 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Just like the pedophile you protested for.
1300673771771252737 2020-09-01 13:56:07 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> The last part made me laugh.
1300672291097935878 2020-09-01 13:50:14 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> Also Biden speaks in sentence fragments you really think he is the man for the job?
1300672288656891904 2020-09-01 13:50:13 +0800 <AmericanSeed76> As if that is the reality of what is going on. This did happen under Obama and Biden multiple times. Also no one in the media has blamed Biden. When will Governor be held accountable especially those who rejected the National Gaurd.
