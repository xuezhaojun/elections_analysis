1336775151174692867 2020-12-10 04:50:06 +0800 <SusannaMarie> Why are our parks still closed @DursleyTC ? We're out of lockdown and parks and safe spaces for babies, toddlers and children to play are so important. #openourparks

1323926018265174016 2020-11-04 17:52:14 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @GlosRoads Think it might be 'Complete Utilities' if that helps
1323924549507948546 2020-11-04 17:46:24 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @GlosRoads Might be worth checking out, as looks like they are currently setting up along St Johns Road.
1323670007495143431 2020-11-04 00:54:57 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @GlosRoads So presumably the sign is in the incorrect location then?
1323570693041172480 2020-11-03 18:20:18 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @GlosRoads can you tell me about the slimbridge St John's road closure 4th-24th Nov? It's on a sign but I can't find it on your map  https://t.co/kqWipex0E5 thanks

1319007667839520768 2020-10-22 04:08:28 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @jiteenahmed @NTDCtweets Is this suitable for psychology technicians or is it aimed at engineering/science technicians?

1315747867127099399 2020-10-13 04:15:11 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @CaraOcobock If you're not too overwhelmed I'd love a copy for my niece, happy to make a donation to a charity of your choice to say thank you
1313929915792842753 2020-10-08 03:51:18 +0800 <SusannaMarie> Work that I can do while William is sleeping... Laminating signs for the labs @BathPsychology #workingfromhome #workingmum  https://t.co/0OzG5npNO1

1310186099642454017 2020-09-27 19:54:42 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @Ruggstickles Absolutely the best plan, we also discovered icing bags are great for grouting üôà
1309909179331641345 2020-09-27 01:34:19 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @makesmilk So true we didn't really progress until home from nicu at 19 days old, and after that we used shields until just before he turned one, he's 20 months now and going strong! So thankful for family support and @GBSNgroups
1309205264600649729 2020-09-25 02:57:13 +0800 <SusannaMarie> This is so sad, NICU is hard at the best of times without having your access limited üòî

1305528979122720769 2020-09-14 23:28:58 +0800 <SusannaMarie> @soozaphone Can't help with COVID but look into hypnobirthing for reducing birth anxiety. @theposbirthco are a good place to start.
