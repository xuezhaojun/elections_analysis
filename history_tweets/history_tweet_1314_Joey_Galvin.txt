1343502081219579904 2020-12-28 18:20:31 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @sweetoblivion26 Looks like the algorithm has correctly identfied a god-shaped hole in your heart.

1343159081465470976 2020-12-27 19:37:34 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @naoisefalafel A sense of shared occasion, perhaps, even if it his somewhat abstract.
1342391588752908288 2020-12-25 16:47:49 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @BiddyEarly I watched it and I kept thinking it was kind of shit and even though it was I watched the whole thing and I still cried at the end because I'm a dope. I blame COVID.

1337157272338915330 2020-12-11 06:08:31 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> Add to that the problem of journos routinely giving the work their employers pay them to do away for free on Twitter... it's not good for the industry, in my opinion. We could do a better job of managing these things.
1337156652655669250 2020-12-11 06:06:03 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> I don't understand why journalists engage. I think it weakens the position. We've all been guilty of it but for some it's routine.  Surprised there aren't more stringent social media policies. Tweeting is publishing. If it wouldn't get past your ed, why put it on here for free?

A mere 26 of them have won the prize in that time, with NO straight white male winners since 2017 - THREE (3) WHOLE YEARS AGO. #cancelculture

1330512008958136320 2020-11-22 22:02:37 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @marklittlenews Unfortunately, if something can be done, it will be done, by someone, no matter the consequences. And then hopefully, but not always, we figure out a way to legislate and regulate.
1329906354652401667 2020-11-21 05:55:58 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> I never watch documentaries on Prime, and I rarely watch anything political (unless you consider The Americans political). Seemed an interesting recommendation.

1328689046563020801 2020-11-17 21:18:49 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> The takeout policy is being operated sensibly in most areas and is a lifeline to businesses. They'll all suffer because of one video on one street in one city. Why not sanction the businesses on that one street? Or police that street?
1327504362738954240 2020-11-14 14:51:18 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> This ping-pong anonymous source stuff - x said y, but y said x - is really damaging. Nobody knows what's true, and yet it's published to millions. So much of political journalism is based on this, and it damages trust without offering any insight.
1325889025564151808 2020-11-10 03:52:32 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @btdecker Meinspace is the modern word for Lebensraum, surely.
1325877469514227716 2020-11-10 03:06:37 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> This vaccine is largely the result of the German government's massive state support for the research and, to a lesser extent, their longstanding liberal immigration policies. Hope that's acknowledged, as it seems important in the context of the time we live in.

1324003608006922242 2020-11-04 23:00:33 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @donie 49,231 tweets have been sent containing that phrase, but, admittedly, I don't know exactly how many relate to the election. Using the possible associated keywords election, Biden, Trump, and vote - at least 12,402 are directly related to the election.
1324002234045222915 2020-11-04 22:55:06 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> If you're writing a tweet at the moment that contains the phrase "it looks like" - please don't send it. Since yesterday, 49,231 such tweets have been sent, and very few of them have added anything to our collective knowledge of what may happen. #Election2020

1322946734809587713 2020-11-02 01:00:55 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @quiatimet I think you'll be surprised how bad it is - compared to the quality of shows around in last 10 years. The way Sorkin writes dialogue is totally disconnected from how people speak, which was ok in TV 20 years ago but seems awful now.

1318456238313787393 2020-10-20 15:37:17 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @anneapplebaum It's also accurate to say that he said explicitly that it's something he, personally, would never do. The rush-to-denial was as a result of an initial misquoting/misreporting of the comments.
1318453876689952769 2020-10-20 15:27:54 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @anneapplebaum OK, forget fairness. We should try to be accurate.
1318451155677138945 2020-10-20 15:17:05 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @anneapplebaum To be fair, it's clear he was saying that these types of calls were something he'd never do. Whether that's true or not, who knows. See:  https://t.co/ROh7Xy2QEt

1310876964010549248 2020-09-29 17:39:57 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @cencos Hello, Joe Galvin here, I'm a journalist with Storyful news agency. Did Cencos shoot the videos from the protest yesterday it posted to Twitter?
1310515575446216704 2020-09-28 17:43:56 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @midhir @CJayFla @michaeldarcy Sorry, to be clear, ministerial role was responsible for financial services and insurance, not solely investment funds.
1310512975896293381 2020-09-28 17:33:36 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> Less than 100 days after leaving his role as a junior minister with responsibilty for investment funds, @michaeldarcy leaves the #Seanad to become the chief executive for the  main lobbying body for investment funds. Is this appropriate? Do we need better rules in place?
1310474369412542464 2020-09-28 15:00:11 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> Twitter is presenting me with some interesting promoted tweets as I look into conflict between #Armenia and #Azeribaijan.  https://t.co/QIBiCXvL6O
1309574438216753154 2020-09-26 03:24:11 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @drewharwell @donie People focus on the outlets most in line with their views. But when you read the paper or the show finished, it wasn't then texting you to demand: "Now look at this and tell your friends!" Individual agency has been diminshed. Users don't get time or space. There's no room left.
1309570499798855681 2020-09-26 03:08:32 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @drewharwell @donie The prob is the product is highly addictive by design. An addict doesn't behave rationally, you just seek the next hit. The cycle becomes hard to break; refresh, share, get the hit, repeat. You become a superconsumer and superspreader very quickly. That's all on FB, not on users.

1307305331228315655 2020-09-19 21:07:34 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> I've said it before and I'll say it again - the social media platforms don't have control over their own platforms. The reasons why can be argued, but that reality can't, and it is frightening.
1307302849798443009 2020-09-19 20:57:42 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @DavidClinchNews @padrg @StoryfulAlan @LauraByrneStory Simpler and more socially proximate times
1307298254347014144 2020-09-19 20:39:26 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @DavidClinchNews If it's any consolation, not much happening in Dublin these days...
1307286898742878209 2020-09-19 19:54:19 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @coodana My pleasure, any time
1307236551903064065 2020-09-19 16:34:15 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> Glad to contribute to this excellent piece by @coodana about the worrying growth of the #FarRight, both here in #Ireland and abroad.
1307058484337410048 2020-09-19 04:46:41 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @buileshuibhne Crazy result. It's probably the weakest Schalke team in a good long while, but they're not a team that loses 8-0. Well, they are now, obviously.

1306634043061161985 2020-09-18 00:40:06 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @NikiBlasina Similar survey in Ireland was done recently.  Great: 0% Good: 0% Era, grand: 100% Bad: 0% Terrible: 0%  So, y'know, everything is grand, really. *sobs*

1306194367221202945 2020-09-16 19:32:59 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @samueloakford The fact a quarter of US adults think it's a myth is even more shocking to me. Wow.

1301191728167350272 2020-09-03 00:14:17 +0800 <Joey_Galvin> @BiddyEarly Love the idea. Plenty of challenges at the moment but tech and remote working show you can work with anyone, any time, anywhere. Great to approach that creatively. Looking forward to results.
