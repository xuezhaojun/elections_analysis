1331817415269777408 2020-11-26 12:29:50 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews Uh yeah because there was no evidence to convict them for such.
1331816228051185669 2020-11-26 12:25:07 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews Last I checked, the system does not allow it. Where it has been confirmed to occur there have been legal consequences for the officers involved. I'll keep waiting for your evidence of systemic racism.
1331814862310289408 2020-11-26 12:19:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @MaraVelousMV @CBCNews Not indicative of systemic racism. Try again.

1331209995409559554 2020-11-24 20:16:10 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive So end that then. What you are proposing is two wrongs make a right. All I am defending here is civilization. There's a reason why the Soviet Union collapsed.

1331207263227424768 2020-11-24 20:05:18 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive They're not underfunded. You get poverty reduction with employment opportunities, not handing people free shit. I don't agree with militarization of the police and I think we should end the drug war. This would eliminate half of their budget on it's own. No need to defund.
1331204763438952448 2020-11-24 19:55:22 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive Bullshit. We've been doing that already without defunding the police. I don't understand what exactly you hope to achieve by reducing their funding.
1331204325583032320 2020-11-24 19:53:38 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @calder12 @morninglive "Defunding the police" on it's own, without addressing things like drug policy is a really stupid idea.

1311219750840807425 2020-09-30 16:22:04 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @NickAdamsinUSA To the left, and apparently also all of the media and academic institutions, everyone is a white supremacist.
1311219503372685312 2020-09-30 16:21:05 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @NickAdamsinUSA The problem here is obviously the discrepancy in the definitions. If we're talking about legitimate white supremacists, then yeah.. There's barely any with respect to the population size.

1311193445885710336 2020-09-30 14:37:32 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I didn't know black people weren't allowed to leave. Interesting.
1311193143564533766 2020-09-30 14:36:20 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol yeah and I don't see how that makes white people racist.
1311192222549839873 2020-09-30 14:32:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Who is running those schools?
1311192072330846208 2020-09-30 14:32:05 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Ok.. I don't see it having to do with you being white. Are black people in Detroit not allowed to succeed? Which laws are keeping them down?
1311191750585782272 2020-09-30 14:30:48 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Then so can the blacks in the inner city.
1311191585770668033 2020-09-30 14:30:09 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Nope. If anything the reverse is true. See: diversity quotas in college admission and in hiring
1311190828635877376 2020-09-30 14:27:08 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Agree*
1311190773296226304 2020-09-30 14:26:55 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol we're kinda going around in circles at this point. I guess we'll sgree to disagree.
1311190570052792321 2020-09-30 14:26:07 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC How do we fix that? Do white coal miners in West Virginia have privilege?
1311189898519552000 2020-09-30 14:23:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC So if I were to say that black Americans are privileged, you would agree?
1311189456859389956 2020-09-30 14:21:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Again the fact remains that several ethnic groups make more money than whites in America. How do whites have an advantage?
1311188950015447041 2020-09-30 14:19:41 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC They have to work harder than... who? What would you consider an even point?
1311187123710709762 2020-09-30 14:12:25 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Ok so immigrants are privileged?
1311186893808242688 2020-09-30 14:11:30 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Well you just accused the Proud Boys of being white supremacists, so...
1311186717802672128 2020-09-30 14:10:48 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I have no idea. Why do you think white people are so privileged despite making less money on average than Filipino Americans?
1311186215849340928 2020-09-30 14:08:49 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Yet they are far outperformed academically and make less money annually than several Asian ethnic groups and obviously Jews. Again, I'm not seeing this power disparity with whites and blacks.
1311185781982220288 2020-09-30 14:07:05 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Because you live in a woke area and presumedly agree with them politically. Just look at how the media twisted the Covington story last year.
1311184860187369473 2020-09-30 14:03:25 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I don't really think that's the case. I would argue that calling everyone racist and antagonizing whites is what is causing the division.
1311183500888899590 2020-09-30 13:58:01 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Yeah.. guns.. I think if you were to just look at white communities, the US is actually safer than Canada.
1311182663152267271 2020-09-30 13:54:42 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Maybe I'll check it out.
1311182543572664320 2020-09-30 13:54:13 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol you really want to talk about shootings? More people get shot in one weekend across the US than right wingers have shot since Trump got in office.
1311181999223328768 2020-09-30 13:52:03 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Is it really? How many buildings have been burnt down by right wing extremists lately?
1311181727721828352 2020-09-30 13:50:59 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC He's not a standard politician, and he pisses off crazy leftists.
1311181447269691393 2020-09-30 13:49:52 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Yeah so are the Proud Boys
1311179576698171392 2020-09-30 13:42:26 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm not consuming right wing media. Did Joe Biden condemn antifa?
1311179444950904832 2020-09-30 13:41:54 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Ok, fine. I just don't like when the term white supremacist is improperly tossed around.
1311178899989069824 2020-09-30 13:39:44 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm not seeing it.
1311178813846548482 2020-09-30 13:39:24 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC No but if it was it wouldn't make him any less black.
1311178648456658946 2020-09-30 13:38:44 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC So are antifa and much of BLM. How come no focus on that condemnation by the media?
1311178432936583169 2020-09-30 13:37:53 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Is he a white supremacist too?
1311178338300497920 2020-09-30 13:37:31 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Nope. I know one guy who is though. He's black.
1311178216778936322 2020-09-30 13:37:02 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC We didn't have left wing lunatics burning down the city though. They mostly just did their protesting vs. imaginary injustices.
1311177822279434243 2020-09-30 13:35:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Lol the Proud Boys aren't a white supremacist group, so... What?
1311177668285599746 2020-09-30 13:34:51 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Sure sound like it too. I'm just thankful you guys left most of the destruction and arson to the US cities.
1311177189434499072 2020-09-30 13:32:57 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm just curious about your concern. What if it was an order?
1311176899666890752 2020-09-30 13:31:48 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC I'm confused. Perhaps you have had one too many tonight.

1311176058473979904 2020-09-30 13:28:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @gsnodd78 @ABC Maybe it was, what's it to you?

1307942395758157825 2020-09-21 15:19:02 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Hessian_Mohd I'm referring to it's member nations and the people in them, who have improved the human condition via a significant amount of scientific discoveries and advancements in the last few hundred years. I think we agree on the structure of the EU itself.
1307935091197345792 2020-09-21 14:50:00 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Hessian_Mohd I think members of the EU have made more than enough contributions to improving the human condition. Not really sure what you're referring to here exactly.
1307911824952655873 2020-09-21 13:17:33 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Hessian_Mohd But the international power and influence that they project is more to do with the petrodollar than anything.

1304267780976451584 2020-09-11 11:57:25 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @nytimes Damn NYT really putting out the hate speech this evening
1304263933507907584 2020-09-11 11:42:08 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @nytimes Lol yeah even when the police are 100% black and someone dies in custody, it's whitey's fault.
1304263575263948801 2020-09-11 11:40:43 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @nytimes You know that's funny. I noticed the exact same thing about blacks in the NBA.

1304230286306299906 2020-09-11 09:28:26 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Jewelanland @CBCNews CBC isn't even mainstream media in the sense which you normally hear it. It is literally the government.
1304229980600250369 2020-09-11 09:27:13 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @CBCNews Shut up. I can't believe anybody takes the CBC seriously.

1304199610332835841 2020-09-11 07:26:32 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @CanadianPM You mean to suppress dissent.
1304197202248634373 2020-09-11 07:16:58 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Breaking911 Sounds like more systemic racism to me.

1304073258342391808 2020-09-10 23:04:27 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @TheSpec @_barrygray_ The City wastes a bunch of money to increase traffic congestion.

1304064422000852992 2020-09-10 22:29:21 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @CanadianPM Utter garbage. Canada is now the racist country the left wanted.

1303702640384266241 2020-09-09 22:31:45 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @KyleKulinski Well that would actually make the most sense... Though I think we all know Obama is not gonna have his revoked anytime soon.
1303702183108653056 2020-09-09 22:29:56 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @Public_Citizen Sure. Just y'know.. wait until there's a real pandemic to point this out.

1303119736729931776 2020-09-08 07:55:30 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @RoKhanna Because he's a politician who knows how to rile up his base of supporters.

1303078897181958151 2020-09-08 05:13:13 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @TheSpec Yeah well... It's Canada. Harder to have a sensible right wing platform in a country dominated by left wing extremists.
1303047063026962437 2020-09-08 03:06:43 +0800 <roberthegreat91> @AminahSheikh Yeah but... No right on red
