1343958895778279424 2020-12-30 00:35:44 +0800 <CaptTony11> Lack of staff.
1343955120808202241 2020-12-30 00:20:44 +0800 <CaptTony11> Let us hope this is the lever to get him out of Office.
1343877565744865280 2020-12-29 19:12:34 +0800 <CaptTony11> Oh Boris, what is happening to you. Humans can not change the climate.
1343872026189197312 2020-12-29 18:50:33 +0800 <CaptTony11> Blimey eu have opened their eyes
1343578354298081287 2020-12-28 23:23:36 +0800 <CaptTony11> @NKrankie Ricky Folton was always great
1343495080032792582 2020-12-28 17:52:42 +0800 <CaptTony11> So if the eu choose to block UK imports, the UK then stops eu goods entering UK. Who wins, no one. Something that will never happen. Business will ensure that
1343487921253396480 2020-12-28 17:24:15 +0800 <CaptTony11> A few corrections are needed
1343224622754516992 2020-12-27 23:58:00 +0800 <CaptTony11> All the waters around the UK are British waters.  Remember the British Royal Navy. The SNP can not offer the eu fishing grounds anymore than it can offer eu the mineral, oil and gas deposits. Nutters
1343223552447815680 2020-12-27 23:53:45 +0800 <CaptTony11> Pathetic
1343144997349109761 2020-12-27 18:41:36 +0800 <CaptTony11> Something never seen in MSM
1343144862720417793 2020-12-27 18:41:04 +0800 <CaptTony11> I do not get the reference to John Lennon, a hippy band member.
1343136259502465024 2020-12-27 18:06:53 +0800 <CaptTony11> Nigel Farage needs to be honoured
1343133562837544960 2020-12-27 17:56:10 +0800 <CaptTony11> The super trawlers were banned buy Australia hears ago, why did the eu allow them.
1343131373670957056 2020-12-27 17:47:28 +0800 <CaptTony11> Of course they do
1342776529231761409 2020-12-26 18:17:26 +0800 <CaptTony11> Sounds very good
1342769649461690371 2020-12-26 17:50:06 +0800 <CaptTony11> This ‚Äòtea leaf reader‚Äô should not be near HMG
1342209643934855180 2020-12-25 04:44:50 +0800 <CaptTony11> This must be a parody account
1342119747014549506 2020-12-24 22:47:37 +0800 <CaptTony11> They are paid by Sky. Sky says kneel, they kneel. Sadly another delay in getting fans back in numbers, then it will stop.
1341832090195812355 2020-12-24 03:44:34 +0800 <CaptTony11> @DevonshireDanUK The Moth and The Mountain by Ed Caesar 1934 WW1 vet, flies a Gypsy Moth to land at the foot of Everest and climb Everest solo. No one had topped Everest yet. A great read for a winters afternoon
1341830647216791552 2020-12-24 03:38:50 +0800 <CaptTony11> I do believe it was Blair who removed the Treason Law
1341778064276152320 2020-12-24 00:09:54 +0800 <CaptTony11> @CllrBSilvester So we can expect a lot of lorrys to remain in Kent as so many drivers will be false positive, taxi üôÅ
1341777213243478018 2020-12-24 00:06:31 +0800 <CaptTony11> We stopped this is hospitals, it is mad to have mixed sex spaces for vulnerable people.
1341771727672664064 2020-12-23 23:44:43 +0800 <CaptTony11> @JuanckersGhost @Keir_Starmer @EdwardJDavey @BorisJohnson Or maybe Micron who has created the problem should send over wine and cheese
1341770812681035776 2020-12-23 23:41:05 +0800 <CaptTony11> They like us so much they do not want us to go üôÑ
1341770420459106304 2020-12-23 23:39:31 +0800 <CaptTony11> @HopkinsBRFC Doc Strange, all daft CGI
1341726504821157888 2020-12-23 20:45:01 +0800 <CaptTony11> No no no
1341677382764294146 2020-12-23 17:29:49 +0800 <CaptTony11> Wholesale, not retail.
1341676998993862657 2020-12-23 17:28:18 +0800 <CaptTony11> Actually I have sent twice as many, difficult times for friends
1341675087104192513 2020-12-23 17:20:42 +0800 <CaptTony11> They can only stop the empty lorries going back to France. Our inward produce has not stopped.
1341674542876508161 2020-12-23 17:18:32 +0800 <CaptTony11> They do hide it exceptionally well, but they must like us so much and want us to stay üôÑ
1341673993225560065 2020-12-23 17:16:21 +0800 <CaptTony11> It is only shut one way, any lorry, passenger, illegal migrant is free to enter the UK, they have never, ever been stopped.
1341672169936457730 2020-12-23 17:09:07 +0800 <CaptTony11> Carry out more IQ testing, find more idiots.
1341525210495905800 2020-12-23 07:25:09 +0800 <CaptTony11> These are the frog coastal cutters that escort the illegal immigrants into British waters, then call the UK boarder ferry service.
1341438723330875396 2020-12-23 01:41:29 +0800 <CaptTony11> Odd i hear Sky news bulletins in TR
1341438497291444225 2020-12-23 01:40:35 +0800 <CaptTony11> Aye empty lorries heading back to europe
1341436668864294913 2020-12-23 01:33:19 +0800 <CaptTony11> 4 1/2 years later the eu still have not accepted we are off
1341435221154144258 2020-12-23 01:27:34 +0800 <CaptTony11> The 1st will be too late. Tis written in our law
1341429680726011904 2020-12-23 01:05:33 +0800 <CaptTony11> Probably brought in by the rubber boat illegals
1341429101396189192 2020-12-23 01:03:14 +0800 <CaptTony11> 1st January 2021 will be a great day for Britain, no more eu
1341324301484617730 2020-12-22 18:06:48 +0800 <CaptTony11> Yes I was thinking that
1340971135874306049 2020-12-21 18:43:27 +0800 <CaptTony11> 10 days WTO
1340969676256522241 2020-12-21 18:37:39 +0800 <CaptTony11> @No_Bikers Irish flags too ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1340969368977608705 2020-12-21 18:36:26 +0800 <CaptTony11> I expect there is WHO protocol to follow when a Country declares that a  ‚Äòdeadly‚Äô disease is spreading uncontrollably. Consequences of using scary words to make the population stay at home.
1340708843538558978 2020-12-21 01:21:12 +0800 <CaptTony11> But as you say it is winter and this was anticipated
1340659519563698177 2020-12-20 22:05:12 +0800 <CaptTony11> Just speak your mind, do not hold back. Love it.
1340658999881023488 2020-12-20 22:03:08 +0800 <CaptTony11> @NJ_Timothy Unlike the Scottish MP on the train who knew she had the CHINESE VIRUS
1340657378967076865 2020-12-20 21:56:42 +0800 <CaptTony11> Are the telly people muting the supporters boos ?
1340655583674953728 2020-12-20 21:49:33 +0800 <CaptTony11> This in the middle of a pandemic.  Let the animals out of the zoos and put the illegals in behind bars. Our children would be safer
1340654366404071425 2020-12-20 21:44:43 +0800 <CaptTony11> I hear that the vast majority walk out
1340653786281500676 2020-12-20 21:42:25 +0800 <CaptTony11> Lack of staff. Many NHS on a sickie
1340652677819232257 2020-12-20 21:38:01 +0800 <CaptTony11> It is not just fishing
1340597953019437058 2020-12-20 18:00:33 +0800 <CaptTony11> Disgraceful.
1340594655394738176 2020-12-20 17:47:27 +0800 <CaptTony11> This
1340592946953990144 2020-12-20 17:40:40 +0800 <CaptTony11> Bloody Chinese
1340367556822110214 2020-12-20 02:45:03 +0800 <CaptTony11> The Lergy. Disgraceful the way msm and some twitters slag off Boris, he is not having a go at you for fun. On the continent, there are curfews, controlled movement &amp; lock downs. At the same time we have the great unwashed from africa and arabs paddling here with their diseases.
1340286071339413507 2020-12-19 21:21:15 +0800 <CaptTony11> A lovely place to be
1340284538078027776 2020-12-19 21:15:09 +0800 <CaptTony11> Generally when I go out for drinks with my (retired) mates, we will visit a few pubs.  HMG meals deal is to anchor us in one place for the night, thus lowering contacts. Understandable. HMG should explain their rational and bring us onside.  Not just bark orders.
1340282605183377411 2020-12-19 21:07:28 +0800 <CaptTony11> Yet a few years back we saw wards being closed. Crisis in management more like. Incomprehensible.
1340282199686438913 2020-12-19 21:05:52 +0800 <CaptTony11> How can HMG allow just nonsense to be presented in Britain. The insulting part is these spin people actually believe that the Brits will be taken in by this, we are not that daft.  And we pay these liars wages.
1340279834090598400 2020-12-19 20:56:28 +0800 <CaptTony11> No.
1340232020073607170 2020-12-19 17:46:28 +0800 <CaptTony11> Says who
1340231639461453824 2020-12-19 17:44:57 +0800 <CaptTony11> WTO better
1340231449283354625 2020-12-19 17:44:12 +0800 <CaptTony11> I believe there are so many NHS staff off on the sick, we do not have enough staff for the hospitals, let alone the Nightingals
1340229290898681857 2020-12-19 17:35:37 +0800 <CaptTony11> Well done our police
1340225946331312128 2020-12-19 17:22:20 +0800 <CaptTony11> Ha ha, we are out and soon we will be gone. Ta ra üëã üçæ
1340224255297007616 2020-12-19 17:15:37 +0800 <CaptTony11> Peak delusion
1339619284729913345 2020-12-18 01:11:41 +0800 <CaptTony11> I am liking Hungary more each day
1339513169585315840 2020-12-17 18:10:01 +0800 <CaptTony11> @MrFezziwig5 I am sure that the boos will be muted on telly.  The msm will only be able to do this for a limited time.

1339281263467827203 2020-12-17 02:48:30 +0800 <CaptTony11> Tories have not cancelled Christmas, but Labour and the MSM are pushing for it.
1339279310927040512 2020-12-17 02:40:44 +0800 <CaptTony11> Creepy
1338791894659309571 2020-12-15 18:23:55 +0800 <CaptTony11> Well his paymasters are not here in the UK

1338420896999088129 2020-12-14 17:49:43 +0800 <CaptTony11> I used to enjoy Country File, now it is unwatchable with its wokeness nonsense
1338420423013392385 2020-12-14 17:47:50 +0800 <CaptTony11> @MichelBarnier Aye, your team has only had 4 1/2 years to sort it out. Excuses.
1338271089357713410 2020-12-14 07:54:26 +0800 <CaptTony11> Nope the eu chaps will be the ones to say ‚Äú no we can not agree‚Äù. They will be the ones to pull back.

1338082122410708995 2020-12-13 19:23:33 +0800 <CaptTony11> This is quite difficult.  Stuff maybe designed in the UK. But generally manufactured in China. Sad state.

1338071723388919809 2020-12-13 18:42:13 +0800 <CaptTony11> The SNP do not have any waters. The United Kingdom waters patrolled by the Royal Navy.
1338069334325927936 2020-12-13 18:32:44 +0800 <CaptTony11> I would really like to believe this
1338068324182274048 2020-12-13 18:28:43 +0800 <CaptTony11> And the Dutch with their electric pulse fishing, killing everything.

1337493078706429958 2020-12-12 04:22:54 +0800 <CaptTony11> First remove the tarrif the eu add to beef entering the eu. The UK can choose to have lower import duties on Argentine beef = cheeper.
1337461662597738498 2020-12-12 02:18:03 +0800 <CaptTony11> Disgusting in our Christian Country

1331647823725686788 2020-11-26 01:15:56 +0800 <CaptTony11> Agree this was a disgrace. And the bbcnewsnight piece about it was absolutely disgraceful as well. Comparing it with a drunk driver being stopped and his passenger gobbing off. I will not mention their colour.
1331587162693918722 2020-11-25 21:14:53 +0800 <CaptTony11> I had a wee look in last night, unbearable how @bbcnewsnight twist and misrepresent (lie) the truth. It will be another bbc free, bbc tax free Christmas. Netflix, Disney, Sky are rubbing their hands.
1331585270035177472 2020-11-25 21:07:22 +0800 <CaptTony11> @DrW0mbat But trans women are not women, fact.
1331377728981970946 2020-11-25 07:22:41 +0800 <CaptTony11> I can not believe my ears.  The @newsnight activists, are depicting the police lifting an old lady today. As a black persecution.  Comparing it to when a drunk black man was stopped and arrested, the black woman passenger resisted arrest. @bbc you are a disgrace. Complete lies.
1331324340818874376 2020-11-25 03:50:32 +0800 <CaptTony11> And these adult savages will be sent into our schools with our kids.unforgivable

1330974271884156938 2020-11-24 04:39:29 +0800 <CaptTony11> We all saw how Boris was bounced into lockdown2 by leaks and targeted briefings.

1329891244865097728 2020-11-21 04:55:55 +0800 <CaptTony11> What a bloody plant pot this lad is, attempting to gain clicks at every turn with his race baiting.

1329717523663777795 2020-11-20 17:25:37 +0800 <CaptTony11> I stand corrected, their kettles and some of the toasters are manufactured here.
1329713348708012034 2020-11-20 17:09:01 +0800 <CaptTony11> The SNP in Scotland and Khan in London, both are blinded by there prejudice to the English.
1329712125300924416 2020-11-20 17:04:10 +0800 <CaptTony11> Lets make our own toasters, all are manufactured in China.
1329711658072240128 2020-11-20 17:02:18 +0800 <CaptTony11> Nutty woke MSM slagging off @pritipatel whose opinion does not fit their agenda.
1329710342272917504 2020-11-20 16:57:05 +0800 <CaptTony11> Khan is intentionally trashing London, who are his masters
1329706396816969730 2020-11-20 16:41:24 +0800 <CaptTony11> That would great. Today we can not even buy a kettle that is manufactured in Britain.

1329564750989156352 2020-11-20 07:18:33 +0800 <CaptTony11> Did not watch the last and will not watch the next. Truly odious
1329553088882077696 2020-11-20 06:32:12 +0800 <CaptTony11> The msm dislike for Priti is tangible.  However most of the public see thro their BS
1329448766626279427 2020-11-19 23:37:40 +0800 <CaptTony11> @BorisJohnson China is the manufacturing centre, we will be buying the kit from them. China also controls the mines in Africa where the cobolt is mined by children.

1327900230658953216 2020-11-15 17:04:20 +0800 <CaptTony11> These scientist are there to put the facts to HMG.  It is HMG who decide what/if any action to take.  There is a judgment to take. The egg heads have done their job by presenting the facts.

1304474820323749889 2020-09-12 01:40:07 +0800 <CaptTony11> Alesha is half white, has she forgotten like others
1304026936914706432 2020-09-10 20:00:24 +0800 <CaptTony11> @DevonshireDanUK You have my vote
1304026814751420416 2020-09-10 19:59:54 +0800 <CaptTony11> @chapman020 Aye but we can not quickly enact laws to stop the black invasion WTAF
1304026614712406016 2020-09-10 19:59:07 +0800 <CaptTony11> @Ara_MaHubbard Excuse me but how do blm fools ban a word, nuts.

1303958255870320640 2020-09-10 15:27:29 +0800 <CaptTony11> I do not watch the news or bbc. Unbearable
1303357996190388226 2020-09-08 23:42:16 +0800 <CaptTony11> Sit down woman
1303065578685575169 2020-09-08 04:20:18 +0800 <CaptTony11> Correction, illegal alien
1302953408081661953 2020-09-07 20:54:34 +0800 <CaptTony11> @Mich1971C If he is one of Pritis boat men, we will never ever be told. This will be suppressed with other illegal immigrant invasion info.
1302630559164719104 2020-09-06 23:31:41 +0800 <CaptTony11> If is by one of Pritis illegals, one thing is sure, there will be a cover up. I expect mental health, this stops investigation as used constantly in Germany.
1302627947631775744 2020-09-06 23:21:19 +0800 <CaptTony11> Same people.
1302625911435558912 2020-09-06 23:13:13 +0800 <CaptTony11> @itssophiemorris Did BGT smash a Nike store window and rob the place, or stop a passing car and beat the driver sensless, or burn out a mom and pop store. Thought not
1302596949993050118 2020-09-06 21:18:08 +0800 <CaptTony11> @RealProfTwatter A party that is proud of the Country and its citizens. A party that will protect its citizens and lands. We need a new party obviously
1302596317315764224 2020-09-06 21:15:37 +0800 <CaptTony11> @MarcherLord1 Did they smash Nike windows and rob the place. Or  Stop cars and beat up the driver. Or Smash and set fire to mom and pop stores  I guess not
1302595765559332865 2020-09-06 21:13:26 +0800 <CaptTony11> @tinkernurse A very bad look for the police. He was picked out by the police. Thought crime, only it was not.
1302594898743496704 2020-09-06 21:09:59 +0800 <CaptTony11> @Barclaycard is your system down today ?

1302528037985095680 2020-09-06 16:44:18 +0800 <CaptTony11> @nigella_i5e @IainShore2 @BorisJohnson @metpoliceuk @Iromg Good grief @VeteranLittle   Was clearly targeted by the police as he chatted to a lady.   Political take down, much like Tommy Robinson. Politicians do not like to be challenged by the truth.
1302312345180528640 2020-09-06 02:27:13 +0800 <CaptTony11> No Boris bought them, kahnt sold them.
1302160960308813826 2020-09-05 16:25:40 +0800 <CaptTony11> @Article1066 The gardian is wrong. The figure is more like 95%
1302160540253532160 2020-09-05 16:24:00 +0800 <CaptTony11> @SJJB55 Not correct.  Quarantine depends on the Country of residence, not where you enter the UK.
1301789397160005632 2020-09-04 15:49:13 +0800 <CaptTony11> This idiot is breaking the law
1301243242202230784 2020-09-03 03:38:59 +0800 <CaptTony11> And today the border ferry service imported a record number of illegal aliens. Nothing to be proud of.

1301228536473309187 2020-09-03 02:40:33 +0800 <CaptTony11> Somewhat similar to making a mask out of a t shirt. Or buy the correct mask.
1301221462477606912 2020-09-03 02:12:26 +0800 <CaptTony11> Too little, too late. The last spasms
