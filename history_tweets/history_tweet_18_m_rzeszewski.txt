1342917568894554113 2020-12-27 03:37:53 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> I get myself a calm christmas evening with an old friend  https://t.co/Ll6vtsnbsR
1334798366711099393 2020-12-04 17:55:04 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Our GIS and Digital Geography lab got some new toys 😁 #OculusQuest2 @WGSEiGP  https://t.co/VUWhOftsP4
1331215700514496513 2020-11-24 20:38:50 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @profrichharris That's just brilliant. It would be a great movie adaptation.
1331202062172958722 2020-11-24 19:44:38 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @chrisbrunsdon Quite true! And the way hexes fit together on a map is quite sexy anyway😀
1331194791707750401 2020-11-24 19:15:45 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Good book. And the lack of sex open possibilities for fan fiction...😁
1326603435748233222 2020-11-12 03:11:20 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> If you are interested in #XR and want to help us with our research please take this short survey! Much appreciated!
1325563502455623680 2020-11-09 06:19:01 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @william_merrin @leightonevans I would not dare to venture this deep into the unreplied... You are a brave man sir!
1325559217240092672 2020-11-09 06:01:59 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @leightonevans @william_merrin If you also have an idea of how to get rid of the constant stream of emails from university administration then I need your help as well  😃
1324248089406984192 2020-11-05 15:12:02 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> This is beautiful work!
1320331076678656002 2020-10-25 19:47:13 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @nzerik @leightonevans He will 😁
1320330960097976322 2020-10-25 19:46:46 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @leightonevans Also experimenting with this but seems a little bit slow and buggy in browser and I would not want to limit access
1320329446566645760 2020-10-25 19:40:45 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @leightonevans Good idea! Let me know how it goes. I desperately need some influx of cretivity in my online teaching since staring at blank screen of MS Teams is starting to take its toll...
1320327851548303363 2020-10-25 19:34:24 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @leightonevans This is environment from Virtual Desktop. Suprisingly nice but I've ditched the idea of using this for the whole presentation due to the possibility of my head movements  making someone sick :)
1320300777882136577 2020-10-25 17:46:50 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Miałem przyjemność nagrać wykład o #VR #AR #XR na w ramach Dni Kandydata #UAM. Można go zobaczyć tutaj:  https://t.co/yfor3iRb6v
1320299420605386752 2020-10-25 17:41:26 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> That's really good opprtunity
1320299204082831360 2020-10-25 17:40:34 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> No words can describe this I suppose 😀
1317101668568281090 2020-10-16 21:54:43 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> I've found a great poster for our recent project @leightonevans ! I'm ordering one for my #VR lab :)
1317038287996014592 2020-10-16 17:42:51 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Spend some time this morning playing suprisingly funny  #WebXR game called ROAR.  It's  only 13k in Javascript without any overhead...amazing work by @stas Play it yourself at  https://t.co/s4l5r0xm06 @pieskucom  #VR  Idea: Fire = microphone  :)  https://t.co/T2q85qkQzE
1311597455046303744 2020-10-01 17:22:56 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Poznań main train station is once more a mess due to a software error. I can rely on them to provide me with tangible examples of how software make space...Thanks!😁
1311397847233892352 2020-10-01 04:09:46 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @wilsonism @RobKitchin @Maynoothgeog I may add that the Kindle version being more expensive than paperback is a nice touch 😃
1311396272105041921 2020-10-01 04:03:30 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @mattzook I'm currently trying VRChat.  Promising for small groups (master students). Seeing me as a jumping banana is a great ice-breaker. No idea how to do something similar in a normal size lecture (100+ students).  Number of people is a main barrier for me.
1310875884589641728 2020-09-29 17:35:40 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> My daughter read me yesterday a Donald Duck story about #AR. Suprisingly good and insightfull.  I'll be citing this in the future. The way Uncle Scrooge is making money from new tech is very close to what we are seeing😁  https://t.co/MU6Y6A2D4m
1309049864739860481 2020-09-24 16:39:43 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> There is a rise of interest in #DigitalGeography here. Twice in this week I've been asked to consult on the excellent digital spatiality texts by @agaleszczynski   This is good.
1306887857152368641 2020-09-18 17:28:40 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> And the obligatory selfie in the new equipment😁 the Digital Geography Lab at the @WGSEiGP is slowly taking shape! #AugmentedReality #hololens @UAM_Poznan  https://t.co/O4e7eZdMMK
1306886277971795969 2020-09-18 17:22:24 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Ahhh there is a nothing like the smell of fresh #HoloLens in the morning  https://t.co/88YkoCbHvi
1306872804395098114 2020-09-18 16:28:51 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @leightonevans The same here - but I'm currently thinking about just recording live performance (aka 'lecture') in VR - to bring some new visual tools and maybe interest student in VR/AR. So they would not need access other than would is already needed here (MS Teams at AMU)
1306869621480452097 2020-09-18 16:16:12 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Hey Twitter, have you tried recording/streaming lectures using #VR ? If yes, what are you using? #hybridlearning Looking for something new. @leightonevans ?
1306869082873098241 2020-09-18 16:14:04 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @samkinsley I've had my registration transferred from 2021 so at this moment I'm going. But I'm always too optimistic to say the least... I'm really waiting whether there will be some interesting CFPs. If not...virtual AAG is not very appealing to me
1306239824958033923 2020-09-16 22:33:37 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @leightonevans Autocorrection... time...not change...
1306229554382622723 2020-09-16 21:52:48 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @leightonevans And the important part - do I have a change to buy them before end of the year 😁
1303259336089710592 2020-09-08 17:10:13 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Poszukujemy osoby na stanowiska adiunkta w @WGSEiGP Wymagania - znajomość #GIS (dydaktyka) i stopień doktora. #GISjob #GISjobs  Poza tym możliwość współpracy w młodym dynamicznym zespole😀 I ze mną 😆 Deadline 25.09.

1301804446398263296 2020-09-04 16:49:01 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Great to see this progressing so well!
1301773325421744130 2020-09-04 14:45:21 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Jeśli jesteś studentem @UAM_Poznan  w #Poznań i jesteś zainteresowany dołączeniem do naszego projektu naukowego związanego z #COVID19  i wirtualną rzeczywistością #VR #VRChat na @WGSEiGP  daj znać! Szczegóły:  https://t.co/okY9ALIVPH
1301771628469202946 2020-09-04 14:38:36 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Received a grant from @UAM with @leightonevans  We will be studying #COVID19  and safe social space of #VR in the next 6 months . Looking for a student from UAM that wants to help us and participate. Details (in Polish):  https://t.co/okY9ALIVPH  https://t.co/zShZoNadXZ
1300698045407924224 2020-09-01 15:32:34 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> Back to the office. I have a litteral cobweb on my workstation. Looks nice in the early moring sun.  It is a little bit surreal though...
1300697401527881730 2020-09-01 15:30:00 +0800 <m_rzeszewski> @mean_neen The same here. I'm so bad and emotional at this that my wife ordered me to dissapear early morning... 😢
