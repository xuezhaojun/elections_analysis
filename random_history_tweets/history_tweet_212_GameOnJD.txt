1343999869002911752 2020-12-30 03:18:33 +0800 <GameOnJD> There’s a lot you don’t know.  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   🤡🤡🤡
1343998641904775169 2020-12-30 03:13:41 +0800 <GameOnJD> Bruh,  You’ve been the biggest 🤡🤡🤡 on this site for years.  Sit down, Corky.
1343996427173822465 2020-12-30 03:04:53 +0800 <GameOnJD> Exactly.  🤡🤡🤡
1343996330839076865 2020-12-30 03:04:30 +0800 <GameOnJD> Nice.  Thanks for clarifying you’ve always been a Socialist fraud.
1343995802016997377 2020-12-30 03:02:24 +0800 <GameOnJD> But you are a Socialist.
1343994210152837124 2020-12-30 02:56:04 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ah.  So you were a proponent of Socialism all along.  Thanks for clarifying.
1343993398525571072 2020-12-30 02:52:51 +0800 <GameOnJD> They don’t have to steal it.  The @GOP is giving it away.
1343993195156353026 2020-12-30 02:52:02 +0800 <GameOnJD> @DTReeves2 @GOP Yup.
1343993120250339328 2020-12-30 02:51:44 +0800 <GameOnJD> Psssssssst...  #NeverTrump 🤡🤡🤡,  I’m not a full on Trumper.  Your vote on 11/3/20 helped usher in a Biden presidency.  At least own your idiocy you fraud.
1343992470401675269 2020-12-30 02:49:09 +0800 <GameOnJD> @SJonNantucket Oh really?  Have you seen Trafalgar’s new poll in GA 12/23 - 12/27?  That corresponds to the GOP defending that abomination of a budget bill while fighting additional stimulus for Americans.  They shifted the polls 6 points against Loeffler who is now down 5 and 3 against Purdue.
1343991322290610182 2020-12-30 02:44:36 +0800 <GameOnJD> Here’s the thing.  Trump’s not on the ballot 1/5/21.  All the GOP Establishment types SWEAR he’s the problem.  If your brand of Republicanism is SO popular, these Senate seats should be a cake walk.  Maybe your tribe isn’t as big as you thought it was.
1343990714498211845 2020-12-30 02:42:11 +0800 <GameOnJD> Nah.  The @GOP McConnell wing will be.  It’s on them. Not Trump.
1343989462267789312 2020-12-30 02:37:12 +0800 <GameOnJD> This is about politics, not a wonky discussion of economics.  The GOP spent zero energy selling the explanation of what you are saying (which is correct) and now have also misplayed the politics of it.
1343988403935842306 2020-12-30 02:33:00 +0800 <GameOnJD> sTeAl tHe eLeCtIoN  You sure are steeped in the language of the Left and are a prime example of why the GOP is dead.  You morons thought you could tax cut you’re way to a majority and instead became The Whigs.  Enjoy typing out all those Romney glow ups for the next 4 yrs.
1343987505452998657 2020-12-30 02:29:26 +0800 <GameOnJD> This is just to salve your TDS delusions.  You’re Steve Schmidt without the reach.  This is about politics. McConnell and the @GOP have backed every ridiculous spending measures that have come along for decades. But stimulus money for Americans is a bridge too far.  Own it.
1343985726556401667 2020-12-30 02:22:21 +0800 <GameOnJD> He’s also going to be responsible for losing the Senate.
1343984845156970499 2020-12-30 02:18:51 +0800 <GameOnJD> Trafalgar (the most accurate 2016 &amp; 2020 pollsters) just polled a shift towards Dems in the Senate runoffs in GA, that directly correspond to the @GOP defending payments to foreign countries while denying more relief to US citizens.  @GOP &amp; McConnell own these pending losses.
1343961469453524993 2020-12-30 00:45:58 +0800 <GameOnJD> Stay in your house.  You are obviously a mentally ill person with deep issues.
1343427581161385984 2020-12-28 13:24:29 +0800 <GameOnJD> Nice.  Time to play by the Left’s rules.  And they are not gonna like it.  Fuck ‘Em.  🤷🏻‍♂️

1343416607129874432 2020-12-28 12:40:53 +0800 <GameOnJD> @aurora_g96 My relentless use of the words “Schmekel” &amp; “Hoo-Ha”.
1343415197533396993 2020-12-28 12:35:17 +0800 <GameOnJD> @DTReeves2 Thank you, Sir!
1343412913193811968 2020-12-28 12:26:12 +0800 <GameOnJD> @JimCoopr I don’t even want to think about it.  Country is still worth fighting for, though.
1343412742661795844 2020-12-28 12:25:31 +0800 <GameOnJD> @sjmprice02 So true.
1343412567490883586 2020-12-28 12:24:50 +0800 <GameOnJD> @sjmprice02 And I you, Mah Brotha.
1343411283048198144 2020-12-28 12:19:43 +0800 <GameOnJD> Thanks, Homie :)
1343409976916770816 2020-12-28 12:14:32 +0800 <GameOnJD> Can you make a good faith argument that Trump sold out on the substance and ended up as Swampy as the rest of them by signing this abomination? Yes.  Are the politics of it the smartest and best play, if ultimately keeping the Senate is your primary objective?  IMHO, Yes. 9/9
1343409976241483777 2020-12-28 12:14:32 +0800 <GameOnJD> Again, this about the politics of it.  Trump exposes massive wasteful spending and advocates for more direct relief to taxpayers and less for foreign countries.  He positions himself as the People’s Champion.  Is the net effect a crushing loss to the base policy-wise? Yes. 8/9
1343409975608160256 2020-12-28 12:14:32 +0800 <GameOnJD> The Media would club them relentlessly until January 5th with it. They needed the signing politically.  Personally, I’d be Ok with a government shutdown, Mexican standoff with Congress and possibly sacrificing a shot at keeping the Senate.  Soft R’s and Indies would not. 7/9
1343409974966439937 2020-12-28 12:14:32 +0800 <GameOnJD> Why?  Because the politics of letting UI and all the other COVID relief benefits expire on 12/28 with a government shutdown is unsustainable and a death knell for the two GOP GA candidates. They don’t just need the base to win. They also need soft R’s and Indies. 6/9
1343409974320517120 2020-12-28 12:14:31 +0800 <GameOnJD> Personally, I’ve been pretty consistent on my thinking that this GOP should be burned down and rebuilt.  But if as Trump has said, that holding the Senate is a must, then ultimately he was always going to have to sign this Bill. 5/9
1343409973657821187 2020-12-28 12:14:31 +0800 <GameOnJD> Back to the Bill signing and politics.  If you believe that holding the Senate is of paramount importance, then publicly coming out against the Bill, exposing how corrupt both R’s &amp; D’s are &amp; then letting that percolate out there is smart politics. 4/9
1343409973007683589 2020-12-28 12:14:31 +0800 <GameOnJD> Like it or not, Trump is a lame duck President at the moment.   Unless something earth shattering happens, Biden will be inaugurated on January 20th.  Do I think there was massive fraud in this election? Yes.  Do I think anything is going to be done about it? No. 3/9
1343409972353314816 2020-12-28 12:14:31 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ok. How do you advance policy?  Politics.  Now, I’m not excusing the signing of or contents of this Bill.   It’s hot garbage and a glaring symbol of how corrupt our government is and how they do not fear us in the least. 2/9
1343409970977665025 2020-12-28 12:14:31 +0800 <GameOnJD> THREAD:  Lotta Hot Takes tonight on the Bill signing.  It’s been very binary:  1. TRUMP GOT ROLLED!  2. IT’S 57-D CHESS!  Unless / until there’s a revolution, politics is the only pathway for anything.  What about policy?!!! you say. 1/9
1343400421642088450 2020-12-28 11:36:34 +0800 <GameOnJD> @Kristi_Weaver4 Lol
1343396027857055746 2020-12-28 11:19:06 +0800 <GameOnJD> I wish you would have lost.

1337566948352208897 2020-12-12 09:16:25 +0800 <GameOnJD> It doesn’t mean that TX was out of line in bringing the case.
1337564397175267328 2020-12-12 09:06:17 +0800 <GameOnJD> Just because you don’t like or agree with it, does not make it a false premise per se.  If a state feels their citizens are harmed or disenfranchised by another state’s actions, they have every right to seek a remedy.  Which was the premise of the TX case.
1337563588794445833 2020-12-12 09:03:04 +0800 <GameOnJD> Not at all.  The above it all posturing and then retreating to “interpretation” is what is, in my view, the height of intellectual dishonesty.
1337563278629871617 2020-12-12 09:01:51 +0800 <GameOnJD> If the states believes that another state’s actions disenfranchises their own citizens they have a duty to make that case.  Not just allow it to happen.
1337562684812890113 2020-12-12 08:59:29 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ahhhhhhhhh...  So now you’re not so much a textualist as you need context to make your argument with outside source material.  Which is fine.  Just stop with the holier than thou purity posing.
1337562262958125058 2020-12-12 08:57:48 +0800 <GameOnJD> Kinda like the Democrats in January of 2017 when they were STILL attempting to get Electors not to be certified for Trump right up until VP Biden, as president of the Senate, banged his gavel to close out the joint session.  You absolute 🤡🤡🤡
1337561651080552450 2020-12-12 08:55:22 +0800 <GameOnJD> aKsHuAlLy  The “literal text” of the Amendment is:  “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.”
1337559130425462784 2020-12-12 08:45:21 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ah.  So only your interpretation of the text matters. Got it.  So I’ll assume you disagree with Heller since citizens were seen to have the right to bear arms without them being part of a well regulated militia.
1337558600479350785 2020-12-12 08:43:15 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ahem.  By this logic all SCOTUS cases outcomes are predetermined before they’re ever adjudicated.  That would render the court permanently irrelevant.  BTW - BEFORE taking the Obamacare case Roberts was predisposed to end the program and changed vote after it was heard.
1337557731356631041 2020-12-12 08:39:48 +0800 <GameOnJD> A few weeks ago you were making a big to do about people judging you for voting third party and not Republican because you despise Trump.  Yet here you are getting pissy with a state that legally brought a case it believed had merit because you despise Trump.
1337557073446440961 2020-12-12 08:37:11 +0800 <GameOnJD> Really?  By using Constitutional mechanisms to bring their case?  That’s some logic.
1337556574345302018 2020-12-12 08:35:12 +0800 <GameOnJD> This is a Goddamn travesty and shame.

1336729186254409731 2020-12-10 01:47:27 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ah.  So the new “reporting” is to take the word of other journalists instead of actually doing some digging on your own.  Also nice to know that the Media has a statute of limitations as to when a sitting US Congressman was caught up in a spy scandal.  https://t.co/PAWW7CtNdd
1336727790008340486 2020-12-10 01:41:54 +0800 <GameOnJD> Nice.  While you’re waiting on that, any interest in some reporting that Eric Swallwell is basically a Chinese spy?

1335402314639794181 2020-12-06 09:54:57 +0800 <GameOnJD> @MyAlteredEgo Here, Corky, you might learn something.   Take your time.   Look up all the words you need to.

1335396495219167235 2020-12-06 09:31:49 +0800 <GameOnJD> @2222vj I think R voters are becoming radicalized and militant. If so, we have a chance.

1335396133397532672 2020-12-06 09:30:23 +0800 <GameOnJD> @2222vj Same.
1335396055735791617 2020-12-06 09:30:04 +0800 <GameOnJD> @2222vj Keep in mind though, after 11/3 R’s now hold 31 of 50 state legislatures. Article II Section 2 of the COTUS vests almost all power for state elections there.  If we make these legislatures fear R voters, they MIGHT actually do their jobs between now and then &amp; end some fraud.
1335395199162454021 2020-12-06 09:26:40 +0800 <GameOnJD> @2222vj He’s the MASTER at that.
1335395063011094528 2020-12-06 09:26:08 +0800 <GameOnJD> @scout_nj I could see that. Lol   I will say though, he interviewed Stacey and I years ago CPAC when we were at an event and he was EXTREMELY fair.  We were talking about a minor mistake in the article the next day, he overheard us in the bar and offered a correction on the spot.

1335392259806814208 2020-12-06 09:14:59 +0800 <GameOnJD> Doing so would be VERY SMART politics.
1335391749003423744 2020-12-06 09:12:57 +0800 <GameOnJD> @2222vj Complicated, but smart.  If GOP loses these seats they will POUND the narrative that it’s all Trump’s fault. They want him neutered &amp; gone more than Dems.  Why?  2024.  GOP holds the Senate then Trump is the most powerful R in the universe &amp; owns the nomination if he wants it.

1335383995668856835 2020-12-06 08:42:09 +0800 <GameOnJD> The question is what are you gonna do if President Trump doesn’t succeed in his election challenges?  If the answer is to give up and stop fighting, you’ve never been in a fight before.  No one wins EVERY fight.  You always win though, when you CONTINUE to fight.
1335381828937641984 2020-12-06 08:33:32 +0800 <GameOnJD> But they’re Communists.

1335374182364958724 2020-12-06 08:03:09 +0800 <GameOnJD> @Kristi_Weaver4 Thank you!!! :)  I haven’t seen it, checking it out now!!!
1335370763751321600 2020-12-06 07:49:34 +0800 <GameOnJD> they’d be wise to wake up to this reality instead of just bleating at all us Rubes to get in line and SAVE THE SENATE!!!  This isn’t Machiavelli. It’s politics 101.  Use your power and change their indifference to what we want.  Here endeth the lesson. 8/8
1335370325576609792 2020-12-06 07:47:50 +0800 <GameOnJD> a signature audit. Now the audit will most likely be bullshit and nothing will change but R voters ire CHANGED a RINOs behavior to give voters what they wanted.  That’s power. That’s your power.  If the GOP wants to win these seats and keep the Senate, which they can, 7/x
1335369855743238145 2020-12-06 07:45:58 +0800 <GameOnJD> Even if the fight is somewhat of Kabuki theatre, it sends a message to both R voters and the Left. The message is that we’re in this for the fight of our lives, just like they are.  This happened this week with Kemp in GA demanding 6/x
1335369433804656641 2020-12-06 07:44:17 +0800 <GameOnJD> responsive to their voters and advance the agenda that their voters support.  R pols, for the most part, do not.  What do R voters want right now?  Fighters. R pols who will bare knuckle brawl with the radical Left. 5/x
1335369079507521536 2020-12-06 07:42:53 +0800 <GameOnJD> burn it all down and kill the hostage AND the hostage taker, then build it back with people who will respond to what voters want, then these politicians will fear you.  If they fear you, they won’t fuck with you.  Dem pols understand this and are 4/x
1335368505550647303 2020-12-06 07:40:36 +0800 <GameOnJD> If R voters use their leverage BEFORE they vote, to make these RINOS understand that if they’re not brought to heel and address R voters concerns over that of the Swamp &amp; the WAPO editorial page, that R voters are perfectly willing to 3/x
1335367793240367104 2020-12-06 07:37:46 +0800 <GameOnJD> R voters only have leverage to accomplish this BEFORE they cast their votes. Not AFTER.  Blindly giving your votes to these swamp creatures does NOTHING to advance the cause of Conservatism.  They’re just going to serve their OWN interests once they’re in office if you do. 2/x
1335367040652222466 2020-12-06 07:34:47 +0800 <GameOnJD> Now that amateur hour is over, allow me to explain politics to the GOP Establishment types:  Keeping “control of the Senate” is only important if the R Senators are responsive to the wants and needs of the voters they need to stay in office. 1/x
1335366175061061633 2020-12-06 07:31:20 +0800 <GameOnJD> Imagine being this obtuse.  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   🤡🤡🤡

1335363714896293893 2020-12-06 07:21:34 +0800 <GameOnJD> You have deep seeded emotional issues.  If you think for half a second that I can be manipulated into giving someone the satisfaction of responding to anything because they demand it, you must be pretty new to my TL.  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   🤡🤡🤡
1335363071695577090 2020-12-06 07:19:00 +0800 <GameOnJD> The best part is that you don’t even realize that your GOP brand of “persuasion” is exactly why Loeffler and Perdue will most likely lose.
1335362543091658755 2020-12-06 07:16:54 +0800 <GameOnJD> Nah.  It’s using you as a cat toy to amuse myself on Twitter.  Simple as that.
1335361954735677446 2020-12-06 07:14:34 +0800 <GameOnJD> “Having the nerve”  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   You have quite the high opinion of yourself, don’t ya, Corky?  How bout this:  Not giving you the satisfaction of bending to your fetish of needing to control people, amuses me greatly.
1335361118794117128 2020-12-06 07:11:15 +0800 <GameOnJD> I answered.  If you’re not bright enough to understand the nuance of the answer 🤷🏻‍♂️
1335360505695907841 2020-12-06 07:08:49 +0800 <GameOnJD> I’d prefer a GOP that didn’t act like a controlled opposition and wasn’t shepherded by an absolute corruptocrat RINO like McConnell.  Since that isn’t possible either way, I don’t see much of difference.  You’re an Establishment guy, I get it.  I’m not.   Burn it down.
1335358738962780167 2020-12-06 07:01:47 +0800 <GameOnJD> Respectful?!!!!  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   You’ve used “moron” and countless other purgatives to describe anyone who you feel can’t comprehend the brilliance of your arguments.  So, yeah. Corky.
1335358202876211200 2020-12-06 06:59:39 +0800 <GameOnJD> Not at all.  I respond to any and all Tweets by QT.  You gonna now demand that I Tweet AND vote how you tell me?  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   #GTFOH   🤡🤡🤡
1335357212592582659 2020-12-06 06:55:43 +0800 <GameOnJD> The only one living in a fantasy world of their own exaggerated sense of self importance is you, Corky.
1335356927824580608 2020-12-06 06:54:35 +0800 <GameOnJD> Corky...  No one in this conversation is disputing that Biden will be inaugurated.  R’s want to keep the Senate to PREVENT a Biden agenda.   Perdue in the video says he wants to help IMPLEMENT the Biden agenda.  That’s some inspiring rhetoric to GOTV for the GOP.
1335355610246901765 2020-12-06 06:49:21 +0800 <GameOnJD> If these two are such great candidates you have nothing to worry about, Corky.  Still waiting for your take on Perdue’s WAPO interview where he salivates at the prospect of impending Biden’s agenda.  That’s a HUGE selling point for R voters!
1335353958215331846 2020-12-06 06:42:47 +0800 <GameOnJD> You’ve been bleating in my mentions for days about demanding GA voters vote for these two.  These two couldn’t get over 50% in a POTUS turnout election. You seem to believe that Trump not being on the ticket will be a plus for them.  Good luck with that.
1335352647424086017 2020-12-06 06:37:35 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ur manic demands of fealty &amp; obedience in voting versus thinking politicians have to earn every one of their votes is where we differ.  I notice u didn’t respond about the WAPO interview where Perdue sells the GOP keeping the Senate as the best way Biden can implement his agenda.
1335351065957576704 2020-12-06 06:31:18 +0800 <GameOnJD> Then you have nothing to worry about.  Evidently, in your opinion, Perdue &amp; Loeffler are the most dynamic politicians since Cardinal Richelieu and more inspiring than Ronald Reagan.  You got this in the bag, so stop throwing a fit and demanding everyone vote for your preferences
1335350153411252226 2020-12-06 06:27:40 +0800 <GameOnJD> Independent thinking.  Group think got us Romney, McCain, Sasse, Speaker Ryan, Obamacare, Sanctuary Cities, Justice Roberts, etc, etc, etc.
1335349750091182080 2020-12-06 06:26:04 +0800 <GameOnJD> Here’s an explanation.  Votes are OWED to no one.  It’s on the candidates to EARN them.  Perdue on video with WAPO yesterday saying the reason the GOP needs to keep the Senate is so McConnell can work with Biden to pass the Dem agenda is not really inspiring to most R voters.
1335349020605247488 2020-12-06 06:23:10 +0800 <GameOnJD> I’ve never said that, Professor.  I’m simply responding to your spittle flecked hot takes.
1335348187951980547 2020-12-06 06:19:52 +0800 <GameOnJD> Then by your logic Trump should stay out of it and not campaign for his supporters to vote for them.  I agree.  Good talk, Corky.  🤡🤡🤡
1335347909789945861 2020-12-06 06:18:45 +0800 <GameOnJD> LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   You have no idea about my politics.  But do go on.  You know nothing 🤡🤡🤡.
1335347272712916994 2020-12-06 06:16:14 +0800 <GameOnJD> Yet not enough to break 50%.  Thanks for making my point for me.  You absolute 🤡🤡🤡.
1335346481159659520 2020-12-06 06:13:05 +0800 <GameOnJD> EL OH EL  Loeffler &amp; Perdue couldn’t get THEMSELVES over 50% in GEORGIA, but if they lose the runoff it’s TRUMP’s fault.  Piss. Off.

1335015160919027712 2020-12-05 08:16:32 +0800 <GameOnJD> @MollyRatty I agree.
1335013580249440259 2020-12-05 08:10:15 +0800 <GameOnJD> @MollyRatty Here’s my issue with them in that regard:  They crave Eunuch power. A seat of influence inside the court but never the throne. They’re happy with moral victories of their power pursuit.  You have to respect the Dems pursuit &amp; of &amp; willingness to use unabashed raw political power.
1335012807008464897 2020-12-05 08:07:11 +0800 <GameOnJD> @MollyRatty You articulate my thoughts a lot better than I do. Lol   Yes. Exactly 1000% that.
1335011603494924288 2020-12-05 08:02:24 +0800 <GameOnJD> @MollyRatty Seriously.  It’s not only easy, it’s the key to succeeding in advancing your voters agenda through the political process.  The problem, IMHO, is that many / most elected R’s personal agendas diverge from that of their constituents.  And that’s why they’re becoming the Whigs.
1335010657083731970 2020-12-05 07:58:38 +0800 <GameOnJD> @MollyRatty It made me think of Libertarian presidential candidates.  People vote for them because the candidates earn their votes by advocating to advance policies that their voters care about.   They don’t despise their voters.  They respect &amp; court them.  Imagine if the GOP did the same.

Ur GOPe brand of persuasion is why the party is such a mess &amp; not taken seriously.  Ya see, most R voters aren’t blind lemmings anymore beholden to a party’s designation.

1334719987613917185 2020-12-04 12:43:37 +0800 <GameOnJD> Personally, and I think it was the smart and highest % play, I believe the strategy was to prevent certification in enough states to drag Biden under 270 &amp; throw the election to the House. (It’s happened before)  I think that ship has sailed, tho.
1334718924122939397 2020-12-04 12:39:24 +0800 <GameOnJD> You know I keep it real with all of you.  If SCOTUS takes any of these election cases, IMHO, they will not enjoin any certifications or overturn any results.  They will most likely rule that state election laws were changed unconstitutionally &amp; seek remedy for the NEXT election.
1334712863001374722 2020-12-04 12:15:18 +0800 <GameOnJD> Ah.  If spending is your thing, you should check the R Senate’s record on that.  Endless wars? LOL  Enabling the Russia Hoax? Check.  Censorship concerns? They couldn’t even issue a subpoena.  Tax policy? They sunsetted the cuts.  Wat exactly are ur issues?

What is the US Const. mandated date that electors have to be sent to Congress?  What is the US Const. mandated date the election needs to be certified?

I’m exposing your cognitive dissonance of stanning for someone who said her election was “stolen” but then also saying she didn’t because she didn’t mention “theft / fraud” while glossing over the irregularities in a first ever mass mail in vote for a POTUS election.
1326641411094175744 2020-11-12 05:42:14 +0800 <GameOnJD> People are actually saying this:  Hillary said the election was “stolen”, but she never mentioned “theft / fraud”, so she doesn’t really think it was stolen.   This country is so fucked.

1324447783298977792 2020-11-06 04:25:33 +0800 <GameOnJD> There are two constituencies left to vote in this election:  .223 &amp; 5.56  Vote accordingly and make your voices heard.
1324256117455753216 2020-11-05 15:43:56 +0800 <GameOnJD> “Ahem”, my balls.  You racist T-what.
1324251397479636993 2020-11-05 15:25:11 +0800 <GameOnJD> The @GOP is making a huge mistake thinking that Trump expanded the Party for them.  Trump supporters (I’m one of them) support Trump.  Most of us DESPISE the @GOP.  Get in this fight NOW @GOP to win or die on this hill with him or watch as your abandoned for good if you don’t.
1324250204388921347 2020-11-05 15:20:26 +0800 <GameOnJD> They don’t listen to you Eunuchs when there in person.  Why the fuck do you think they’ll listen to your Tweets?
1324249290613641217 2020-11-05 15:16:48 +0800 <GameOnJD> AG Barr did NOTHING about:  Spygate   COVID related civil rights suppression / suspensions   Civil unrest   Destruction of federal property   Antifa violence   Suppression of political speech   Etc.  What makes you think he’ll start doing his job now?
1324207676423839745 2020-11-05 12:31:27 +0800 <GameOnJD> Because they want Trump gone more than the Democrats do.
1324203894617083905 2020-11-05 12:16:25 +0800 <GameOnJD> LOL @LarrySchweikart   Savage. 🔥🔥🔥  https://t.co/FlW2xs0WSr
1324190471225266176 2020-11-05 11:23:05 +0800 <GameOnJD> The protestations &amp; the lawsuits are all kabuki theater.  Do you honestly think R’s who can’t subpoena tech CEO’s or investigate the people who spied on &amp; tried to destroy their own party’s President, are capable of beating the side who has militants burning down cities?  LOL No.
1324189133418483714 2020-11-05 11:17:46 +0800 <GameOnJD> No.  They’ve chosen to accept the rigged rules of the game and have deluded themselves into thinking they can beat them.  They can’t.
1324188604294455303 2020-11-05 11:15:40 +0800 <GameOnJD> This is the last election I’ll ever vote in.  Game is rigged.  Playing by their rules makes me the sucker.   Let it all burn.
1324188214618443778 2020-11-05 11:14:07 +0800 <GameOnJD> You have to understand how the Left thinks.  Colorado is Blue forever, it will never be Red again.  Due to D vote #’s in urban centers, R’s will never win the popular vote.  On the off chance the state ever votes for an R POTUS, this ensures that candidate never gets the votes.
1324154192982888451 2020-11-05 08:58:55 +0800 <GameOnJD> Nice.  What’s the plan when the R party is officially banned?
1324129380533215233 2020-11-05 07:20:20 +0800 <GameOnJD> They can’t.  It has to go through a lower court first.

You cannot argue all of a sudden the vote counting then stopped.  You cannot argue Biden then came out &amp; declared victory.  Now STFU &amp; fight or get out of the way.

1312228766551289861 2020-10-03 11:11:32 +0800 <GameOnJD> @AGHamilton29  The shorter version of my rambling incoherence here is that basically, even the best medical experts just don’t know relatively much about COVID as compared to other viruses.  I think more medical professionals should concede that.  Just my take.
1312227940118204416 2020-10-03 11:08:15 +0800 <GameOnJD> Agreed.  It’s a very plausible / probable theory.  I just snapped at you over the “seems obvious” wording.  Which could be interpreted as plausible / probable.  It was more a rage Tweet after 24 hrs of being sick of Twitter hot takes.  I’m just grouchy today, I suppose.
1312221955840520192 2020-10-03 10:44:28 +0800 <GameOnJD> I’d say it’s an interesting theory.  To say “it seems rather obvious” seems to me to be nothing more than a layman’s speculation.   But, hey, that’s just me.  You do you and play fake Twitter epidemiologist.
