Perverse logic.

1334653528653123585 2020-12-04 08:19:32 +0800 <jamie247> damn right. tick tock ;)
1334638765592236032 2020-12-04 07:20:52 +0800 <jamie247> @dcroweth @zardozclub you are doing it wrong ;)
1334638620595154948 2020-12-04 07:20:18 +0800 <jamie247> haha oh yes the Bulgarian Crypto Mafia is taking over @OVioHQ   Fortunately with virtual working we dont have to cover the refreshments ;)
1334638049062514690 2020-12-04 07:18:01 +0800 <jamie247> Because there are a limited amount of investors with a limited amount of capital and an oversupply only a few artists get backed.   And there is a natural herd component to that.   Collectors only want to collect what others collect because otherwise there is no liquidity.
1334636405633523714 2020-12-04 07:11:30 +0800 <jamie247> @zardozclub honestly I don't see it. I'm sure it does, perhaps more past tense. But day to day I see collectors in it for the love or the buzz.
1334635980876357633 2020-12-04 07:09:48 +0800 <jamie247> @nadyaivanova @TheTakenUser I'm not sure I can remember it myself lol  Lets just say those peoples can drink!
1334635526947794945 2020-12-04 07:08:00 +0800 <jamie247> @okinmakesart if you are collecting at scale right now it simply can not be for a return.   There is something much deeply connected to the medium and the artists themselves.  Its a VERY expensive and personal hobby.. at least for me!
1334634816713723904 2020-12-04 07:05:11 +0800 <jamie247> @zardozclub honestly running a discord with over 100+ of the major collectors.. it is definitely more the later.   As an investor liquidity is the only thing that matters. And for collections of real size that simply does not exist yet.  You can make way more easy money just trading crypto
1334633964812857344 2020-12-04 07:01:48 +0800 <jamie247> @TheTakenUser @BNPParibas @iamjohnegan @nadyaivanova @latelier @CryptoKitties @decentraland interesting.   Long time since we were drinking in Bulgaria ;)
1334633573492600838 2020-12-04 07:00:14 +0800 <jamie247> @okinmakesart market forces have to just play out, and they will, but NFT collectors today are early adopters paying the salaries of artists they hope become bluechip one day  Just like in venture most wont some will. Most VCs lose money a small few 100x  You have to do it for the love of it
1334629297634430976 2020-12-04 06:43:15 +0800 <jamie247> True collectors are desperate to bring more collectors into the market not keep them out (for liquidity) because we are bidding amongst ourselves at the moment largely for ego and locking up cash that could be out in the #crypto wild wanting 15% in a day 😅
1334628300434460672 2020-12-04 06:39:17 +0800 <jamie247> @arnav_vohra Nice perspective. And this is what I hope it becomes.   But honestly I don’t see that diversity of thought yet.   I see maximum 3 philosophical models with a heavy bias to a SV Libertarian Consensus.
1334627355067777029 2020-12-04 06:35:32 +0800 <jamie247> There is a massive oversupply of work coming into the market and a small handful of people stupid enough to keep paying an increasing premium because we can’t stop ourselves
1334626406332919808 2020-12-04 06:31:46 +0800 <jamie247> What most artists think of #NFTArt Collectors:  A cabal manipulating markets &amp; getting ridiculously rich 🤑   Reality:  A passionate OCD riddled bunch who have over extended themselves on a very expensive hobby

1334609533780504577 2020-12-04 05:24:43 +0800 <jamie247> @lucclop @fabianospeziari IMHO that’s a hoarder not a collector.   Rarity in and of itself is based upon you having something someone else doesn’t which is just an expression of greed.   A collector needs to connect to a meta theme, narrative or aesthetic that unifies their collection &amp; elevates them
1334606805809442818 2020-12-04 05:13:52 +0800 <jamie247> @PepitoP37689195 I do also have some physical versions. But that’s not my point.   If you are ONLY buying to flip you aren’t a collector you are a trader.   It might as well be oil, wheat or Bitcoin ie Fungible.   Nothing wrong with that.   But it ain’t an NFT collector ;)
1334604874663735299 2020-12-04 05:06:12 +0800 <jamie247> If you wouldn’t be happy to put a piece of #NFT art on your wall &amp; look at it everyday at breakfast in perpetuity you aren’t a collector you’re a speculator  Nothing wrong with the later but let’s not confuse it with the former  There isn’t nothing in 💯xARt I don’t LOVE

1330927286921662472 2020-11-24 01:32:47 +0800 <jamie247> The reason I have founders on the show is to inspire other founders to enter #web3 to grow the brain trust, momentum &amp; increase adoption  To me sex, gender or race is not important.   However if we want to grow crypto we need to reach, inspire, onboard &amp; welcome women as a start
1330926126311596039 2020-11-24 01:28:10 +0800 <jamie247> I struggle to get female founders onto the show  If there is a male cofounder they usually defer for media because they learnt the PR isn’t worth the bullshit that comes with it  The net outcome is fewer women in #crypto   This isn’t a criticism of individual women but crypto
1330924977466568705 2020-11-24 01:23:36 +0800 <jamie247> I think it speaks to both the idea of what being a founder in #web3 should be generally be about (at a certain place in the stack) .. shipping code.   But also the perspective of being a solo female founder in #crypto’s extreme of #defi

1322466569788805120 2020-10-31 17:12:55 +0800 <jamie247> NFTs are going to rapidly morph from a collectible you stash passively in your wallet to shared experiences as social currency.   This will increasingly require multi media collaborations / studios big and small
1322466124995432449 2020-10-31 17:11:09 +0800 <jamie247> #NFT ticketed #VR experiences will be a BIG thing  Rather than own the art you own access to the experience through limited NFTs, which can be leased, transferable or sold.   Not only an investment but a social currency (like lending folk your seat or box at a sports stadium)
1322458734325571586 2020-10-31 16:41:47 +0800 <jamie247> @thebrichman @officialmcafee 😂

1322204536329613314 2020-10-30 23:51:41 +0800 <jamie247> Very bullish on the Open Data Economy in 2021:   Data custody, rights, marketplaces &amp; financialisation are coming &amp; fast  @swashapp and their IDO (Initial Data Offering) on @oceanprotocol as well projects like @tapmydata and  @SecretNetwork   Very exciting!
1322168662439186438 2020-10-30 21:29:08 +0800 <jamie247> Congrats 🥳
1322134820613480448 2020-10-30 19:14:39 +0800 <jamie247> @polluterofminds good take
1322132640296828928 2020-10-30 19:06:00 +0800 <jamie247> If you were / are a early stage #DeFi Founder who would your dream mentors be?   Please @ them below 👇🏼
1322119032703750144 2020-10-30 18:11:55 +0800 <jamie247> If you are an early stage #Web3 Founder working on #DeFi , #NFTs &amp; The Open Data Economy / #Privtech   Apply to our accelerator   Deadline passes EOP today 🚨    https://t.co/TjMpnM8Bgv
1322119031558725632 2020-10-30 18:11:55 +0800 <jamie247> 6. They know the difference between swimming upstream vs downstream 🏊‍♂️   Very hard if you are a 1st time founder...  But great founders sense when they need to move on to something new AND carry their investors with them
1322119030413680640 2020-10-30 18:11:55 +0800 <jamie247> 5. They have insane hustle   They don’t mind getting their hands dirty and value proximity to their customer.   Ideally they are their customer!
1322119029247647744 2020-10-30 18:11:55 +0800 <jamie247> 4. They have good timing 🕰   Here there is a lot of luck involved ☘️   But great founders seem to intuitively be able to time the market...  (At least in retrospect) 😆
1322119027985100800 2020-10-30 18:11:54 +0800 <jamie247> 3. They prize execution over ideas💡   A good analogy is they don’t get too attached to ideas (as if they are their only child) 👶   They spray &amp; pray until something sticks
1322119026831728640 2020-10-30 18:11:54 +0800 <jamie247> 2. They are quick to acknowledge their weaknesses 🎯   AND quick to hire people that address them
1322119025422454785 2020-10-30 18:11:54 +0800 <jamie247> 1. They don’t sweat the little stuff 😅  They know the value of their time &amp; perfect is the enemy good ⏰
1322119024256450562 2020-10-30 18:11:53 +0800 <jamie247> Somebody just asked what makes a great founder  So over the last 7+ years of investing in #crypto Ive spoken to an avg. 1k EARLY STAGE founders a year = 7k in total   We’ve a portfolio of 30 &amp; via FOW3 Podcast I’ve now interviewed close to 30 LATER STAGE   Some observations 👇🏼

1321829516742959104 2020-10-29 23:01:29 +0800 <jamie247> @ScaleWeb3 @Twitch @SomniumSpace @OVioHQ I’ve not seen anything about Open Metaverse rooted in Web 3 principle and infrastructure...   Prove me wrong ;)  Links👇🏼
1321818662811164672 2020-10-29 22:18:22 +0800 <jamie247> The economics are I would never sell a work for less than 10 x the price I bought it so typically buy sub 3 ETH max 15 ETH   And I have to believe it’s possible the artist has an outside chance of 100x over a longer period   Hence 💯xARt ;)
1321818661179588611 2020-10-29 22:18:21 +0800 <jamie247> Talking about at what part of the #NFT Art market I play.   Best description borrowing from my day job in venture capital is:  I’m a ‘pre-seed collector’.   Ideally I like within the first 5 sales and even better discovering NFT virgins 🍒 and commissioning their first 3 NFTs

1321469105661267968 2020-10-28 23:09:21 +0800 <jamie247> I think new #NFT artists need better guidance from platforms on the sale process.   You can’t just put up work without a list price or time based auction.   There needs to be a mechanism otherwise gets very arbitrary as is bad for community building

1320431806894776322 2020-10-26 02:27:29 +0800 <jamie247> @future_tunking @opensea @niftygateway nice. actually was just trying to remember the several ways you can pull your NFTs into a sortable stream to share by URL.
1320416880251883521 2020-10-26 01:28:11 +0800 <jamie247> @CubesCrypto Please open DMs..

1320267598249025538 2020-10-25 15:34:59 +0800 <jamie247> @safetyth1rd Absolutely. It’s also just one part of the story.   Effectively subsidised user acquisition (which is great for bootstrapping a network) but you still need to close the loop with a form of retention.  Enter #NFTs..   https://t.co/ApCOK7gjTX
1320265810733076481 2020-10-25 15:27:53 +0800 <jamie247> Good to see @Chicocrypro picking up on the potential of DIDs.. 😉    https://t.co/Oub11WbbOa  Actually #DIDs are also the thing that make #DeFi 2.0 mainstream 🙌🏼    https://t.co/wA4Hvjvpmc thx @ryandonz for link

1320120656021901317 2020-10-25 05:51:05 +0800 <jamie247> @dandoll @kanyewest you'll have to wait for the launch of the artist.. ;) ⏰
1320112048664158210 2020-10-25 05:16:53 +0800 <jamie247> its a matter of time someone like @kanyewest realises the power of #NFTs to transform Creative Industries for a Cambrian Explosion of experimentation in decentralised &amp; 'creator centric' business models for the #metaverse
1320109969270857729 2020-10-25 05:08:37 +0800 <jamie247> Wait until @kanyewest realises he already has a;  digitally unique portrait of himself, made by a computer algorithm, that lives on a blockchain hanging in a virtual world &amp; a physical copy has been printed out by a robot 🤯    https://t.co/YBQbHgfNNi &amp; its his for $127k   💯xARt
1320054516339904513 2020-10-25 01:28:16 +0800 <jamie247> @blockchainbros @OVioHQ @Polkadot @gavofyork @kusamanetwork Nice spot. @dComms_ you’re fired.
1320052243903766528 2020-10-25 01:19:14 +0800 <jamie247> Hmmm... (text message)   An item has been posted to you from DAPPER LABS INC. in Canada. We'll let you know when it's in the UK  @dapperlabs 🤔
1320044737102028800 2020-10-25 00:49:25 +0800 <jamie247> A great pic of Olympus Mons on Mars, the largest volcano in the solar system: almost 3 times higher than the Everest 🤯  https://t.co/ATxrf4nJvJ
1320023826906943492 2020-10-24 23:26:19 +0800 <jamie247> (c) UX / Prime brokerage  'Deep' multi protocol #defi bring increased complexity and risk which need to be aggregated into better UXs to abstract complexity
1320023340992598016 2020-10-24 23:24:23 +0800 <jamie247> (b) CeFi to DeFi Bridges  Traditional finance has amassed decades of complex legacy IT systems that are often antiquated and difficult for newer external technologies to directly integrate with. Requiring new bridges to be built between CeFi and DeFi.
1320023183156797441 2020-10-24 23:23:46 +0800 <jamie247> (4) Accessibility Usability  (a) Administration: Accounting &amp; Taxes  Accounting APIs that remove administrative burden of filing end of year tax returns of increasingly complex multi-protocol products that will put off many or limit their trading activity and frequency.
1320022745468620802 2020-10-24 23:22:02 +0800 <jamie247> (d) Access Tokens  Access to digital vaults with collateral inside rather than a digital representation of collateral or a right (potentially a security)  NFTs could be access to underlying collateral and be burnt / consumed when used (rental or a trust arrangement)
1320022383852388352 2020-10-24 23:20:35 +0800 <jamie247> (c) Multi-asset swaps  How do we swap STOs, CBDCs and crypto and vice versa?   If NFTs can each carry wallet KYC &amp; AML permissioning all assets can still co-exist in the same decentralised environment and be freely exchanged with one another in pairs or mixed into baskets
1320020752721170440 2020-10-24 23:14:06 +0800 <jamie247> (b) Income bearing NFTs  The problem with #DeFi 1.0 yield, was the yield was not linked to actual income, rather a form of subsidised user acquisition and therefore unsustainable.   we need income bearing instruments wrapped as NFTs (e.g. invoice factoring or SME wrapped debt)
1320020751391535104 2020-10-24 23:14:06 +0800 <jamie247> (3) Collateralisation  (a) #NFT Commodities / Derivatives  Most institutions will only come into DeFi if there are assets they know, understand and can price such as real world commodities, derivatives or things like real estate via STOs and NFT synthetics
1320019371171958785 2020-10-24 23:08:37 +0800 <jamie247> (e) Analytics &amp; Fundamental Analysis  AI Analytics &amp; Monitoring for CeFi to manage structural financial and compliance risks and activity around major dApps and associated assets inc. investment and usage behaviours and on-chain activity patterns around DeFi services
1320019369934585858 2020-10-24 23:08:37 +0800 <jamie247> (d) Native Credit Scoring   Attestation about assets via verifiable credentials linked to DIDs as NFTs a native onchain credit profile for credit scoring (augmented by staking &amp; oracles for risk adjusted credit profiles)
1320018029116379137 2020-10-24 23:03:17 +0800 <jamie247> (c) Trustful Oracles  For institutions to trust DeFi, automation via smart contracts, they need increased surety in oracles and their truthfulness to achieve compliant levels of reporting and security and resilience to manipulation.
1320018027795144704 2020-10-24 23:03:17 +0800 <jamie247> (b) Administration / Custody  DIDs for permissioning of ‘organisation wallets’, containing digital portable credentials to confirm an orgs identity and verify the authority of employees / reps to act on behalf of the organisation
1320015850599026690 2020-10-24 22:54:38 +0800 <jamie247> (2) Risk Management  Insurance / Reinsurance as #NFTs  DeFi needs a native form of insurance contract and mutualisation to minimise financial exposure to risk where it can’t be removed technically e.g. @NexusMutual  Insurance policies as NFT collateral for Reinsurance markets
1320014861934514178 2020-10-24 22:50:42 +0800 <jamie247> (1) Compliance  'Decentralized KYC &amp; AML' via reusable DIDs and verifiable credentials delivered through an open verifiable claims market which removes regulated counterparty requirements from the #DeFi Protocols
1320013908632096769 2020-10-24 22:46:55 +0800 <jamie247> Lowering the barrier to institutional participation:  (1) Compliance  (2) Risk Management  (3) Collateralisation  (4) Accessibility &amp; Usability  (5) Market Efficiencies  ..
1320013907373817858 2020-10-24 22:46:54 +0800 <jamie247> The question is: how can DeFi onboard new institutional users to benefit from its innovations, without becoming too centralised in the process?   Lets look at how we can..
1320012584402247680 2020-10-24 22:41:39 +0800 <jamie247> .. AI Lego for Money Lego (Open and accessible off-chain lego)  Complex off-chain logic + on-chain smart contract logic to proactively respond to external events (via oracles).
1320012042414264321 2020-10-24 22:39:30 +0800 <jamie247> (4) Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs)  Intelligent agent acting on owners behalf with limited to no interference whose goal is to generate economic value   Allowing more complexity at smart contract logic and execution layer of DeFi   + AI Lego for Money Lego
1320010997202079744 2020-10-24 22:35:21 +0800 <jamie247> (3) Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) &amp; Verifiable Credentials  DIDs = identifies any subject decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.  VCs = exchange info with verified provenance and unchanged integrity
1320009597411856387 2020-10-24 22:29:47 +0800 <jamie247> (2) Confidentiality solutions:   private data, transactions &amp; compute  (a) Privacy primitives become common (e.g. ZKPs, EY Nightfall, bulletproofs, zkRollups)  (b) Privacy L2 scaling solutions (e.g. Aztec)  (b) Transaction Mixing  (c) General purpose confidential compute
1320008564547686402 2020-10-24 22:25:41 +0800 <jamie247> (1) #NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens)  in an Institutional #DeFi context;   digital representations of / or access / ownership rights to something unique, entirely digital or a twin to physical assets   (eg. property like a car or real estate)

1318299981753843713 2020-10-20 05:16:23 +0800 <jamie247> Feel like I’m talking too much #NFT   Might need to counterbalance the bias with a few more #web3 rabbit holes 🐇 🕳   Going to try and do a bit more #DeFi and #NewDataEconomy NDE chat 💭
1318299261994401794 2020-10-20 05:13:31 +0800 <jamie247> @CryptoJack2 Yes I think traditional contemporary artists coming into the space is perhaps (2) and everything moves down.   I think it will be great PR for the space, break a few records but no where near as exciting as what Metaverse ‘natives’ will create with mixed reality etc
1318297584176451589 2020-10-20 05:06:51 +0800 <jamie247> @CryptoJack2 That does not mean 1) can’t and won’t make a shit tonne of money. They really will. But less over time or at least not as much as the proceeding phases
1318297343909822470 2020-10-20 05:05:54 +0800 <jamie247> @CryptoJack2 a) is what drives virality through existing social channels (beyond limited pool of crypto wealth)  b) is what adds premium and scarcity. There fewer the people who can actually make it or the more cross discipline collaboration required the better
1318296717528342528 2020-10-20 05:03:24 +0800 <jamie247> @CryptoJack2 Personally I would say the difference between 1 &amp; 2+   a) themes &amp; a visual aesthetic that have mass appeal   b) technical proficiency to produce   ie the required mastery of technologies like motion graphics, gaming engines, machine learning algos + use of multi media
1318294940871516161 2020-10-20 04:56:21 +0800 <jamie247> @itsparrott I mean given a lot of the artists I am buying are building with gaming engines it feels an obvious next step
1318293607531544577 2020-10-20 04:51:03 +0800 <jamie247> The reason this is less exciting to me is it’s just a dumb asset / transaction / form collateral in my portfolio it isn’t something I can experience.   An immersive #VR #NFT is that AND something I can jump into (ideally in a social context) the later really bringing a premium
1318292730032902145 2020-10-20 04:47:34 +0800 <jamie247> @DChapmanCrypto Like AR?
1318292619689078785 2020-10-20 04:47:07 +0800 <jamie247> @j1mmyeth @A_Giant_Swan @niftygateway @VoxelArchitects Yeh they aren’t clearly delineated  So 1, 2 &amp; 3 could be experienced / consumed as objects in virtual worlds like Crypto Voxels today  However 4 &amp; 5 feel like they need the open Metaverse and environments where I can have ‘full’ immersive VR experiences of NFTs with headsets etc
1318290186195898368 2020-10-20 04:37:27 +0800 <jamie247> @DChapmanCrypto I don’t think it’s either or.   But I do think digital, purely digital, will ultimately be more valuable.   You might argue as data it already is. It’s just not ‘trickle down’ yet.
1318288890373996545 2020-10-20 04:32:18 +0800 <jamie247> @DChapmanCrypto the #metaverse will be open..
1318288199974871042 2020-10-20 04:29:34 +0800 <jamie247> @DChapmanCrypto also think valuing physical tangible things over digital is a boomer thing. I say that as someone that still uses facebook ;)  there is a generation already alive whose wealth will forever be more digital than not

1318260795533295617 2020-10-20 02:40:40 +0800 <jamie247> @Ferris_Bullish I am but an undereducated fool bounded by language, or at least my knowledge of it.   But I think most will get the gist of they want to.
1318259825915142144 2020-10-20 02:36:49 +0800 <jamie247> @Ferris_Bullish To extend in the context posted:   something so universally acknowledged as beautiful or technically proficient it crosses over and ‘goes viral’ in social channels like this..
1318259271948173320 2020-10-20 02:34:37 +0800 <jamie247> @DChapmanCrypto I will be honest I actually think that will become increasingly discounted to purely digital 🤷‍♂️
1318258851620311040 2020-10-20 02:32:56 +0800 <jamie247> @Ferris_Bullish indeed subjective when used in this context. Closet thing I could find:  ‘Aesthetic means the pleasant, positive or artful appearance of a person or a thing. An example of the word is aesthetic is to say that a particular car is beautiful’.

1317856081771663360 2020-10-18 23:52:29 +0800 <jamie247> @dandoll Well Oculus themselves add a 13+ health warning ⚠️   Only specific thing I saw was impact to eye development.
1317850399869632517 2020-10-18 23:29:54 +0800 <jamie247> What age is it appropriate to let a child use an #Oculus?   Hear various concerns about 👁 👁 development etc
1317797185237454850 2020-10-18 19:58:27 +0800 <jamie247> @ASychov Yes exactly.   Would love to understand the underlying unit economics of an equivalent dimension of land in each virtual world today for a comparable experience.
1317784729593253888 2020-10-18 19:08:57 +0800 <jamie247> @gabusch But do you think virtual real estate value is about adjacency or content?   Because this would imply the later which dilutes the former in my head.   People to go the content
1317784340462534660 2020-10-18 19:07:24 +0800 <jamie247> @matthewniemerg Yeh for sure.   I guess the point is if you have great content people come to you and you can be anywhere.  Doesn’t that break the real estate model?  Then what’s next?
1317783501354291200 2020-10-18 19:04:04 +0800 <jamie247> @gabusch you mean the value of the land only holds based on the economic activity it enables on top right?
1317782382230032384 2020-10-18 18:59:37 +0800 <jamie247> @matthewniemerg Therefore I want to optimise for the cheapest space with the highest throughout of experience
1317782238474477569 2020-10-18 18:59:03 +0800 <jamie247> @matthewniemerg As these virtual environments become increasingly social and experiential I don’t care about the size of the space but the throughout of what I can do in it with people
1317781856973168641 2020-10-18 18:57:32 +0800 <jamie247> @matthewniemerg this simple replication of the physical world to the virtual is natural and obvious and works to bootstrap the Metaverse but I don’t think it holds long term.  Firstly I’m likely not wandering around virtual worlds I’m porting so conventional physical proximity is less relevant
1317780038536826882 2020-10-18 18:50:19 +0800 <jamie247> @Mooie_89 @AaveAave Yeh in particular bootstrapping content via borrowing against virtual land will happen.   But ultimately it’s artificial scarcity.  Long term Web3 will remove that tax and systems will naturally align to the actual system resources required for the experience itself.
1317772378928222208 2020-10-18 18:19:52 +0800 <jamie247> The point of the #Metaverse is it’s almost limitless potential  It’s not about the dimensions of space it’s about what you want to do in it surely..?
1317772039042760704 2020-10-18 18:18:31 +0800 <jamie247> I’m not convinced the biz model of artificial scarcity of real estate in virtual worlds will hold over the next 3 years  #Web3’s economic games will push for virtual scarcity to be much more closely aligned to the actual limitations of its IT infrastructure..   #VR

1316499133860122625 2020-10-15 06:00:27 +0800 <jamie247> Interesting to see people realise too late that the most precious things to them are;  Time + Respect &amp; Relevancy  Each holds the ultimate premium because no amount of wealth can retrospectively recover them  &amp; sometimes the pure pursuit of wealth is a direct trade off

1316416616612143116 2020-10-15 00:32:33 +0800 <jamie247> This is about bleeding edge as you can get in #crypto   A parody on #DeFi food protocols that turned over night into a serious project at the intersection of #DeFi + #NFTs

1315940640044265472 2020-10-13 17:01:12 +0800 <jamie247> #DeFi is full of risk. Insurance &amp; Reinsurance will be the next big trend in the space.   Fantastic chat with @HughKarp about why only #crypto can insure and price risk in crypto   And how mutuals have historically been the model for new communities and industries to manage risk

1315721038555119618 2020-10-13 02:28:35 +0800 <jamie247> Honestly the problem is too many folk in #crypto think they don’t need to play the game, get together &amp; lobby.   When proposing a user centric, hyper efficient, financial system with inbuilt provenance there is no reason we should be losing to incumbents

1315563668290052097 2020-10-12 16:03:15 +0800 <jamie247> @dutchtide @DoveyWan Oh this is not crypto.   It’s digital currency controlled by a state.   There are going to be many flavours with various degrees of inbuilt dystopia   The question is how they interplay with crypto proper which is ‘stateless’

I’ve had these types of conversations for the last 7+ years in crypto and so far I’ve been profitable every one of those years...  ‘’You don’t know what you don’t know’’ ;)  https://t.co/UQdwp1RpMC

1313031269282918400 2020-10-05 16:20:24 +0800 <jamie247> @dandoll Digital art is one very narrow usecase.   The more obvious and least constrained by ETH protocol fit.    If you can’t see past that you don’t understand the scope of ‘non fungible’ ;)
1313030791446888448 2020-10-05 16:18:30 +0800 <jamie247> @dandoll Bubbles are inherent to crypto my friend.   And this one will be 3 x ICO mania easily.   No more laundering than the existing banking system and your favourite Big 4 accounting firm... that is an old and lazy narrative
1313029619247910912 2020-10-05 16:13:50 +0800 <jamie247> @dandoll But and it’s an important but NFTs are inherently memetic and viral (that’s their super power)   They really give crypto for the 1st time the ability to cross over into mainstream   And unlock established Web 2 social communities and industries like gaming etc
1313029324895907840 2020-10-05 16:12:40 +0800 <jamie247> @dandoll - spectrum of usecase - maturity of infrastructure  - growth trajectory of platforms

1313027771594092544 2020-10-05 16:06:30 +0800 <jamie247> @dandoll Well to me NFTs are a subset on DeFi  You could consider them the consumerification of crypto   DeFi as much as NFTs are a product of an industry looking for yield during a crypto winter. This is crypto’s DNA  NFTs today have emerged ‘overnight’ from several years of innovation

1311955345930158080 2020-10-02 17:05:04 +0800 <jamie247> acknowledging the role of randomness / luck in your journey:  -is good for your mental health because you see failure as part of success some things fail despite hard work   -helps you develop compassion &amp; empathy which is less isolating  -makes a better world to enjoy success in

1311951326079782913 2020-10-02 16:49:05 +0800 <jamie247> Success should be celebrated but it should also be understood because the ‘hard work narrative’ endemic in highly individuated meritocratic  societies like the US and UK leads to the highest levels of income and wealth inequality.

1311625407649779718 2020-10-01 19:14:00 +0800 <jamie247> I think more #NFT artists when they reach a threshold of success will tokenise to fractionalise access.   There are already several I can’t afford / justify but love their work   What’s the threshold per work?
1311623342143811589 2020-10-01 19:05:48 +0800 <jamie247> @DCLBlogger I’m betting @robnessofficial and his genesis #TrashArt 🗑 🖼   Such an important part of the #NFT narrative   More likely if he minted a token like @WhaleShark_Pro to fractionalise it’s ownership
1311621677906907137 2020-10-01 18:59:11 +0800 <jamie247> @StaniKulechov LLP wrapper solves for this but messy an eLLP out of a jurisdiction like Bermuda, Lichtenstein or Estonia would fox this

1311604164649267200 2020-10-01 17:49:35 +0800 <jamie247> @kaiynne would love to have you on the show ..
1311592040082403328 2020-10-01 17:01:25 +0800 <jamie247> Which #Web3 Founder should I have on the show next?  #crypto #defi #NFTs anything is game!  @ them below   https://t.co/vh4ZwZUE3R
1311587706984697857 2020-10-01 16:44:12 +0800 <jamie247> New tokens must undergo a baptism of fire in #Crypto   Founders &amp; communities need to make tough calls several times over on path to being accepted as legit projects    But with every trial they survive &amp; bounce back a premium gets placed on their resilience  $DIA $FET $OCEAN
1311578249479229442 2020-10-01 16:06:37 +0800 <jamie247> I work with 30 startup founders every year.   I am a serial founder myself.   No one appreciates the grit and hard work it takes to make a successful startup.   It’s truly inspiration.   But let’s put that in the context of surviving a day in a war zone as a child.
1311574492913766401 2020-10-01 15:51:41 +0800 <jamie247> Btw none of those things mean success isn’t possible it just makes it harder.   And if you were unlucky enough to have several of those in your first hand (like the majority of the planets population btw) then it’s going to be that bit harder with the finite time you get
1311573886652362752 2020-10-01 15:49:17 +0800 <jamie247> @alessiodevecchi 😂
1311573714648039424 2020-10-01 15:48:36 +0800 <jamie247> I guess that’s going to be attacked as ‘virtue signalling’.   But it’s how I live my life everyday.   I walk around thinking I’m the luckiest fucker on the planet 🌍
1311573316067524608 2020-10-01 15:47:01 +0800 <jamie247> Be grateful for all the ‘out of the box’ luck you’ve got and reward it with hard work and helping those that didn’t get a break  rather than self congratulating yourself on all the qualities and characteristics you inherited socially or by biological luck of the draw 🍀
1311572491152822272 2020-10-01 15:43:44 +0800 <jamie247> Some straight ‘out the box luck’ most people overlook 📦   - Not born in 3rd world ✅  - Not born in a war zone ✅  - Not die before you were 5 ✅  - Not born with physical disability ✅  - Not born with mental disability ✅  - Not born in dysfunctional family ✅   I could go on
1311571417452994562 2020-10-01 15:39:28 +0800 <jamie247> Such a false narrative.   Successful people reward their luck with appreciation, hard work and humility.   The idea unsuccessful people are lazy, undetermined &amp; undisciplined is the excuse some ‘successful’ people use to be assholes.
1311569844165316608 2020-10-01 15:33:13 +0800 <jamie247> Congrats

1311031034788614145 2020-09-30 03:52:11 +0800 <jamie247> The global offshore tax system (pioneered by the Swiss, perfected the British) has been the scourge of society since the start of the 20th century   but it might now be humanities (via #crypto + #metaverse) only hope of breaking free from a broken economic system
1311029698596679681 2020-09-30 03:46:52 +0800 <jamie247> #DeFi generally requires ‘over collateralization’ but when decentralized reputation can be quantified and meaningfully collaterized this changes
1311017565209194496 2020-09-30 02:58:39 +0800 <jamie247> This could be the biggest cross #crypto community project ever mobilised.   If every protocol and their respective communities up to dapps could effectively insure against risk factors it would be a game changer but it would need some serious collateralisation
1311015625939210241 2020-09-30 02:50:57 +0800 <jamie247> If you are working on any of this get in touch I want to invest  ps we should work with @BermudaPremier @DenisPitcher to make this happen in the global reinsurance capital of the world who  get #crypto biggly 🇧🇲 🌍
1311014791746551809 2020-09-30 02:47:38 +0800 <jamie247> Managing ‘risk’ in #DeFi is critical to its success / adoption..  So Insurance Layers for the stack are a big opportunity..  a Reinsurance Protocol / Market* would be a top 10 player   *keep in mind Insurance Agreements can be #NFT as collateral for DeFi markets  #crypto #web3

1310964733235867648 2020-09-29 23:28:43 +0800 <jamie247> @thatleechi17 @SecretNetwork It’s not about good or bad.   This is a reality for parts of the space.
1310958700065161219 2020-09-29 23:04:45 +0800 <jamie247> Bullish on @SecretNetwork
1310933654634405894 2020-09-29 21:25:13 +0800 <jamie247> The consequence is we, &amp; now regulators, are going to have to accept a degree of malpractice (they are tasked with protecting) to get this thing up &amp; running  perversely amplified by a logic which pushes more founders to go anonymous / rush out code to max decentralisation
1310932564031483904 2020-09-29 21:20:53 +0800 <jamie247> One of main roles of a regulator is to deliver value to consumers via competition  It’s clear at this point they have largely failed us &amp; now create perverse logics to contain things like #crypto  What I love about DeFi is it accepted this and just stopped asking permission
1310931292922556419 2020-09-29 21:15:50 +0800 <jamie247> Most regulators are knowingly or unknowingly in capture.   As such most markets are entirely uninnovative and therefore uncompetitive and monopolistic  You, me the end consumer are the ones that pay the price
1310930706818793480 2020-09-29 21:13:31 +0800 <jamie247> One thing Ive seen over the last 7 yrs in Web 3 is the centralised world (as it is today) does not want decentralisation.   It’s far too disruptive even though it could be transformative.   Why? The people making the decisions &amp; their budgets are the inefficiency.
1310892531727638531 2020-09-29 18:41:49 +0800 <jamie247> I love how Pete is working this  Right on brand with the maxies 🎯   And like 🐝s to 🍯 with the rest   My man
1310884774186283008 2020-09-29 18:10:59 +0800 <jamie247> This is BIG news for #NFTs and #DeFi generally..  #ETH2 Test goes live for 3 days this week. Depending on how that goes we could get a mainnet launch date   https://t.co/y0zXhcL1Wr
1310872985151180801 2020-09-29 17:24:09 +0800 <jamie247> every time I speak with a new founder in the #NFT space my mind gets stretched that bit further.   A BIG take away from this one was seeing a #Nifty a context driven digital experience / consumable   &amp; their virtual spaces as onboarding new generations into financial literacy
1310871634434195456 2020-09-29 17:18:47 +0800 <jamie247> #NFTs are increasingly going to be multimedia social experiences built and owned as collaborations between artists
1310595995424653313 2020-09-28 23:03:29 +0800 <jamie247> This is the perfect analogy for 2020
1310346950391271424 2020-09-28 06:33:52 +0800 <jamie247> So happy to have 3 in the collection. @alessiodevecchi is a super talent and a lovely bloke.   Imagine like so many others in my collection this is a hobby for him right now...  Blue chip digital artist in the making 🙌🏼 #NFT #Nifty

1310340187235418112 2020-09-28 06:07:00 +0800 <jamie247> My #Nifty Digital Fine Art collection is coming together at 14 pieces (5 more in commission) across 6 artists  Sadly had to break records on two artists but went back and scooped up their cheaper works immediately.   Now for the virtual gallery build and launch in 3+ months 🖼
1310249934105575424 2020-09-28 00:08:22 +0800 <jamie247> @alaeven I doubt it. But certainly truer. And fuller.
1310247167479734273 2020-09-27 23:57:22 +0800 <jamie247> I’m trying to come up with a term for this process 🤔
1310242975637811201 2020-09-27 23:40:43 +0800 <jamie247> As value gets broken down and ingested into #crypto the flow can be bettered optimised real time.   It’s going to be beautiful. And incredibly timely.
1310242482752548864 2020-09-27 23:38:45 +0800 <jamie247> We measure today’s economy in incredibly primitive ways which show a fraction of the story.   This is why the world is breaking.   Because we are unwittingly making hidden trade offs.   This might sound bombastic but #NFTs will gradually reveal all value, hidden costs &amp; flow
1310240086819319808 2020-09-27 23:29:14 +0800 <jamie247> I strongly agree with this Stani.   Im just thinking about personal tokens aggregate into meta social currencies... 🤷‍♂️   Stake personal tokens to collateralise a community etc
1310239062947659778 2020-09-27 23:25:10 +0800 <jamie247> #crypto is unpredictable. You could launch in a bull or bear market  We’ve been accelerating #Web3 startups since 2013 whatever   In the last Crypto Winter we backed 21 startups despite the chill making us one of the most active investors 🌍   We are your evergreen partner🌲

1309395697121267713 2020-09-25 15:33:56 +0800 <jamie247> I interview @borgetsebastien of @TheSandboxGame $SAND on Founders of Web 3 in a couple of hours what should I ask him?   @BGameAlliance #gaming #NFTs #Nifties 👇🏼
1309382534657175552 2020-09-25 14:41:38 +0800 <jamie247> Another great point by @rohamg to the question what is a ‘Non Fungible’?   It’s easier to say what isn’t..   Only a few things in the world are ‘fungible’ such as money 💰   Pretty much everything else if your LIFE is non fungible   Apply to NFTs and 🤯

1309379492343930881 2020-09-25 14:29:32 +0800 <jamie247> I think @rohamg &amp; @SergeyNazarov did a great job of expanding the context of #NFTs and making the connection to #DeFi  Few people understand Debt and things like Debt / Insurance contracts can be NFTs too ;)   @rexs_io #insuretech

1308853938721042435 2020-09-24 03:41:10 +0800 <jamie247> @SuperRareJohn Maybe ban manual auctions until then because it adds unnecessary friction between a collector and an artist
1308853627637952512 2020-09-24 03:39:56 +0800 <jamie247> I’m 40, a dad  I’ve served 7yrs pro in #crypto   I’ve 30 partners &amp; staff  We’ve a portfolio of 30 startups adding 30 pa  In the past I’ve delegated dog fooding but it removes you from the frontline   So I now do it as much as possible  But boy it sometimes feels inefficient
1308849303633485825 2020-09-24 03:22:45 +0800 <jamie247> Ok I now just made my big bid an hour too early and revealed my hand because the artist referenced the wrong finish time in Twitter DMs because he got the time zones mixed up ...  @SuperRareJohn you desperately need a countdown ticker or do away with manual artist auctions ⏰

1308831104292524034 2020-09-24 02:10:26 +0800 <jamie247> Time based auctions for #NFT Art right now with all the limitations of #ETH is a great way to lose community both as an artist &amp; a platform   I don't mind being outbid but I do hate being the highest bid, paying the max gas fee but not winning because the transaction fails ⏰

1306285677764636676 2020-09-17 01:35:49 +0800 <jamie247> Now LIVE 🚨   Another crazy #DeFi panel

1306205609163882498 2020-09-16 20:17:40 +0800 <jamie247> If you want to understand the global regulatory landscape for #crypto you need to join this LIVE discussion now  🇺🇸 🇪🇺 🌍

1306199026392592384 2020-09-16 19:51:30 +0800 <jamie247> The later point re DeFI is because:  a) brings a new form of collateral to lending markets   b) could close the loop on promiscuous yield hunting through programmable loyalty

1306190319411777536 2020-09-16 19:16:54 +0800 <jamie247> #DeFi + #NFT Thesis 90% complete..  One big teaser outtake:  NFT Platforms will be to #crypto what CEXs were to the ICO Hype Cycle and Bull Run  But I will argue; reaching an even bigger % of the global population &amp; adding rocket fuel to DeFi 🚀   It’s going to be wild 😜

1304822534265864193 2020-09-13 00:41:49 +0800 <jamie247> I read recently something like 95% of #crypto is passive at the moment...  Think about that 🤯   #DeFi hasn’t even got close to started   Throw in an explosion in new forms of collateral via #NFTs
1304816887189176322 2020-09-13 00:19:22 +0800 <jamie247> As soon as #NFT Digital Art 🖼 becomes a more acceptable form of collateral for borrowing &amp; lending in #DeFi the asset class is going to explode 💥   With the pace of both spaces this could easily happen in the next 6 months 🔮
1304801490574479368 2020-09-12 23:18:12 +0800 <jamie247> I need to create a series of tweets with images via my macbook. Best tool?   @Twitter Twitter for more than one multi media tweet on a mac is awful UX.     FYI using Brave browser
1304753624115970048 2020-09-12 20:07:59 +0800 <jamie247> I guess it’s just live generative art with oracle data inputs rather than just making the one off output an NFT.   One is a dead loop the other ‘alive’

1302977061901008896 2020-09-07 22:28:34 +0800 <jamie247> Also true for Digital Services &amp; Assets such as what @oceanprotocol are working on in their data curation markets   And I could imagine the same being true for curation of #NFTs / Digtial Goods on platforms like @SuperRare_co
1302976475428159489 2020-09-07 22:26:14 +0800 <jamie247> In the same way Yield Farming provisions the supply of capital to bootstrap a network for #DeFi   Bonding curves staked against merchants / products will provision the supply of products and services in #dCommerce such @BosonProtocol

1301907161312763904 2020-09-04 23:37:10 +0800 <jamie247> You can find many many flaws with #DeFi but...   the current financial system is (by design or accident) anti-competition  It doesn’t innovate nor deliver either yield or efficiency for retail   DeFi may be a messy permissionless clusterfuck but it IS..

1301543950822641665 2020-09-03 23:33:54 +0800 <jamie247> insight from @SuperRareJohn ..  currently most #NFTs are produced by individual artists   they are becoming more experiential inc. audio, motion graphics, direction through gaming engines  increasingly they will be created by studios  This is coming sooner then you think

Still very little media interest yet compared to 2017 so the retail side hasn’t even got started   Likely both are more cautious after last crash / correction but they will come..
