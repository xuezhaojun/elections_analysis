1331899984661372928 2020-11-26 17:57:56 +0800 <Jojones2762> @LordAshcroft Dear Lord Ashcroft  I think it’s safe to say that this is a very popular move for the general public.   The rich lefties don’t approve, but most of us do.   We are only cutting our cloth, don’t spend what we don’t have.   Regards.....
1331899236796018690 2020-11-26 17:54:58 +0800 <Jojones2762> @beevans56 @LordAshcroft Exactly right!  Many have stood in HOC yesterday bemoaning the cut to FA. More concerned with how we look to the world because we are reneging on our commitment to 0.7% of our GDP!!! Circumstances dictate otherwise imo and our Economy has tanked so we do well on 0.5% still!

Landlords 2 have lost  jobs, unable to make mtge payments = eviction. Council given Covid support to help tenants on top of existing HB, so shd make rent payments.

1325493695416852481 2020-11-09 01:41:38 +0800 <Jojones2762> @jemmytwitcher @theresa_may he isn’t President elect even!   Votes are still being counted, the media announced him winning, well it’s not fact until every vote is accounted for.   Then they can call him as having won!

1324009655954231297 2020-11-04 23:24:35 +0800 <Jojones2762> @thetrthprevails I think so. After all the corruption and the laptop, riots etc, I can’t understand how Americans could vote for Biden. Looking at turnout for T rallies as opposed to handful turning up for B - the results make no sense.
1324005121332809729 2020-11-04 23:06:34 +0800 <Jojones2762> @thetrthprevails No I can’t, I’ve just been on Parler and voters are up in arms about votes for Biden suddenly being found which overtake Trump lead. Photo of man taking a ballot cart away, Trump ballots found under earth. Arizona Trump vtrs given sharpies which inval votes, 🤷‍♀️

1323700208874754053 2020-11-04 02:54:57 +0800 <Jojones2762> @resurgentsheep It says ‘will allow U.K. to claim it’s taken back control, but leave fishing quotas till a later date’!      This is not Brexit! Does @BorisJohnson @DavidGHFrost think that we will have forgotten about fish at a later date?    ‘Allows the U.K.’ 🤷‍♀️ 🤬

If XR and BLM protests had been banned, perhaps we wouldn’t be facing more restrictions.   This is not govt fault it’s those individuals’ fault
1323546725324304384 2020-11-03 16:45:04 +0800 <Jojones2762> Good, in these times protests from whomever should be banned

1323544140840345602 2020-11-03 16:34:48 +0800 <Jojones2762> Good - it’s fair for them to be asked to make same sacrifices the rest of us are.  20% wage cut to MPs will be equivalent of many ordinary folks annual wage!

Interesting you speak up for May , yet don’t give same empathy for the present govt who r doing their best. There isn’t a set of inherited guidelines on how to deal with a global crisis.

The fear of being called racist prevents punishing crimes; the cost is someone’s life. Time this diversity lark was binned and crime punished whoever perpetrates it. Diversity causes division imo

1301496496785969152 2020-09-03 20:25:20 +0800 <Jojones2762> @CllrBSilvester @pritipatel Yes I saw that abt Dublin treaty. I believe things will be done. Patience needed to 31st.

1301177608479166467 2020-09-02 23:18:11 +0800 <Jojones2762> @BorisJohnson  Rashford ought to pay full tax and donate himself before asking for tax payers to support his campaigns!

1300874301885812736 2020-09-02 03:12:57 +0800 <Jojones2762> @hunterathelen1 My sentiments exactly, but why should we pay. It’s the parents responsibility, if they make bad choices why is it taxpayers responsibility to pay.

1300832543202316289 2020-09-02 00:27:01 +0800 <Jojones2762> @ig732 @SteveLaws19 I’d settle for £10k fines to help the public purse for the mess they always create

1300824260311687168 2020-09-01 23:54:06 +0800 <Jojones2762> @loveslucozade @Pork_Nocker 👍 thank you, I’m female btw.
1300824080137039877 2020-09-01 23:53:23 +0800 <Jojones2762> @Pork_Nocker No I am not, I am a taxpayer, pay for my own kids, don’t want taxing more to pay for people who make poor choices!
1300823790981730309 2020-09-01 23:52:14 +0800 <Jojones2762> @555jammy Exactly, it’s poor parental choices.

1300786572334370821 2020-09-01 21:24:20 +0800 <Jojones2762> Does anyone know if Marcus Rashford donates any of his money to his FEED the children campaign?   Interested to know because he’s written to Boris again requesting more support?  Why shd taxpayer fund everything?
