1343679439452983303 2020-12-29 06:05:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @MarkOfEngland1 Scottish comedian. He marked the people diving out of the twin towers as though they were Olympic divers. Scoring them out of 10.
1343645930013290501 2020-12-29 03:52:08 +0800 <NKrankie> Frankie Boyle doesn't think comedy is too 'woke', denies cancel culture exists whilst agreeing that we shouldn't joke about muhammad, and saying that blackface 'just shouldn't happen'. He also says Ricky is lazy and trans jokes are bad.    https://t.co/CunmOnaONY

1343625181739315200 2020-12-29 02:29:41 +0800 <NKrankie> Pakistan - every year 1,000 Christian girls are married off to old men and forcibly converted to Islam. They then are birthing machines for muslims. Islam isn't growing because people are thinking it's a fun religion, it's being imposed on people.    https://t.co/zWXNwcg02A

If I were you, I'd go after whoever it was, teachers or parents, who raised you with such a narrative and to be a victim. You do not have trauma from other people's lives. It's impossible.

1343580346567303168 2020-12-28 23:31:31 +0800 <NKrankie> Alec Baldwin's wife has had to admit that she's white and from Massachusetts after having pretended to not fully speak English because she's Spanish.

1343576128632582145 2020-12-28 23:14:46 +0800 <NKrankie> Apologies, I was thinking of Deacon Blue, not prefab sprout. That lead singer of Deacon Blue is another Nat-zi indy promoter. He's since turned a bit of a political commentator.
1343575900177256451 2020-12-28 23:13:51 +0800 <NKrankie> My apologies, it's Deacon Blue that I was thinking of. Not Prefab Sprout.

1343524560335998976 2020-12-28 19:49:51 +0800 <NKrankie> The Scottish LGBT are really mourning the passing of this prolific paedophile. What could the connection be, I wonder.

1343341222543372291 2020-12-28 07:41:20 +0800 <NKrankie> BLM and the left have created a social climate where forgiveness is not an option. There's no mercy, compassion, 2nd chances, outreach or healing. It's all about getting you fired, cancelled, outcast, and made unemployable. It cannot be tolerated.

He'll now know where to look for her. Doesn't solve the problem. And while it's not nice to be beaten, this is prioritising one victim group over another.

1342893174918942721 2020-12-27 02:00:57 +0800 <NKrankie> They deport the wrong ones. This young gay guy seems to have genuine cause for asylum. Meanwhile, we keep the rapists and terrorists.    https://t.co/UhhI8VUO4g  https://t.co/5Mff9rTJE4
1342892603537285126 2020-12-27 01:58:41 +0800 <NKrankie> The hatred is mainstream. It's not 'just a few'. Muslim football player bombarded with hare from fellow UK Muslims because he celebrated Christmas and wished Christians a merry Christmas. Something needs to be done about this now.   https://t.co/pwWXJRkZQL  https://t.co/27CEkZPriD

1342831053506011142 2020-12-26 21:54:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @Duggery4 If I were vegan, I'd pass out at that news and have you reported to twitter.

1342822858859421696 2020-12-26 21:21:32 +0800 <NKrankie> Did you light a candle and shed tears for the victims of the Manchester arena bombing, and then in the same breath curse Trump and call him a racist for putting a temporary ban on flights entering the US from terrorist hotspots? If so, you might be a hypocrite.
1342793817683013633 2020-12-26 19:26:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @NicolaSturgeon You aren't saving lives. You're making elderly people's last days as horrifying as possible. There's no quality of life for people. Lockdowns don't work, nedette.

1342787293573230592 2020-12-26 19:00:13 +0800 <NKrankie> @SpaghettiBadger @PBobbeh @ctrp44 @LozzaFox @BBC I think what it means is they should also examine blacks role in the slave trade instead of constantly blaming it all on whites. Blacks sold their own people. Also, that guy has 26 followers. You're arguing with a bot.
1342786468050305030 2020-12-26 18:56:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @mat_rosey @LozzaFox @BBC Yes, but has anyone been charged with promoting it still? I'm seeing recent youtube videos of parents calling teachers, and the teachers on the phone telling the parent their child has white privilege. Maybe Laurence's party should enforce it.
1342786202987073536 2020-12-26 18:55:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @LozzaFox It hasn't been banned, and there's no one enforcing the banning of it. Has anyone been charged for promoting race theory in school? She says they're 'breaking the law' but those are empty words unless it's enforced.
1342778148807700485 2020-12-26 18:23:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @Philobedd0 Thanks. It's just being older as well. I'm not ancient, but for some people these are the last days of their lives. It's terrible. There's no quality.
1342776954357952513 2020-12-26 18:19:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @RobertAuthor People tend to believe everything they read in a meme.

1342771863794176000 2020-12-26 17:58:54 +0800 <NKrankie> Just looked at everything I'm not allowed to do for the next 3 weeks. It's utterly depressing. Can only leave house for food and essential items. Coupled with the dark nights, this is not psychologically good for people. There has to be support. It's a bleak midwinter indeed.
1342768195007090688 2020-12-26 17:44:19 +0800 <NKrankie> If we can't deport radical people, whether they be Islamists or something else, where should we put them? It's folly to allow them to walk around the streets as a danger to others, and it costs millions of pounds to constantly surveil them.   https://t.co/j9kgZz8gGq

1342752166147223552 2020-12-26 16:40:38 +0800 <NKrankie> South Africa - where blacks are killing white farmers, and there are political calls to 'kill the boer (white man)', I don't think it's a good look for South African cricketers to be kneeling and raising fists for BLM.

1342416122906353665 2020-12-25 18:25:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @BulletBlueSky @ZenkerFriedrich In your mind there is. And only in your mind. The rest of the UK understood it as comedy, whether good or bad. Let's see if the Queen is offended enough to take legal action. They didn't parody you, so I don't see that you have a say.

But comedy/satire/parody is fine. It is freedom of expression when faked. You'd have to prove malicious intent to cause distress. Courts wouldn't hear you

1341868259872821254 2020-12-24 06:08:18 +0800 <NKrankie> When will we rise up and demand that the NHS start treating all of us for things that are not covid related? We're taking this lying down. People are dying of cancer and other illnesses. When will we demand that they treat us? Forget the mask protests, we need treatment protests

1341701705931644930 2020-12-23 19:06:28 +0800 <NKrankie> Why is racism the biggest crime against humanity? We don't blink an eye at human trafficking, rape gangs, drug gangs, modern day slavery, forced prostitution, and more, yet 'racism' seems to be the biggest crime. Can't simply dislike 'cultural habits' these days or its hate crime

1341698833106038784 2020-12-23 18:55:04 +0800 <NKrankie> They are reaching back decades to find something to be offended by. White man played an Asian villain in Flash Gordon. Stereotypes are fun. Drunken Scottish people, etc. Can't laugh any more.   https://t.co/DiEYT9RrvR

1341688874255478785 2020-12-23 18:15:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @40_John_Doe Well the police were after him and he fled the country. He posted a girl's name, location and face with rape allegations which would then pervert any upcoming trial. He is a liability. Drugs create mood swings. I don't like it.

1341679569846362113 2020-12-23 17:38:31 +0800 <NKrankie> @40_John_Doe I'd say he's done more damage than good. Regardless of what motivated him to do it.
1341678525376565248 2020-12-23 17:34:22 +0800 <NKrankie> @mark1854now There were witnesses. I personally don't care what adults get up to, but cocaine does cause mood swings. And would that explain the way Danny endangered that young girl's life by posting her details and storming into a council office with no right to be there?

You're doing that because you can't handle reality of abortion. Life starts at conception and goes through many stages. There is more respect given to decaying corpses than there is for a new life forming in the womb

1340332350392180737 2020-12-20 00:25:09 +0800 <NKrankie> @Sulian102 @E78James I don't doubt that it's real, but I do doubt that it's as dangerous as they're letting on. It's unfortunate if a person's family member gets sick, but when something has a 99.7% survival rate, I'm not supporting a country and economy getting shut down.

This pakistani muslim man who has destroyed countless young white girls' lives is released 8 years into a 26 year sentence. That's not even half time served. Is that time off for good behaviour?    https://t.co/kELLYsf3Om

Race is very very important to a majority of people. The fact that it's not important to you is neither here nor there in the grander scheme of things.
1339899052071260161 2020-12-18 19:43:22 +0800 <NKrankie> This law was also passed in the UK, but we've had one prosecution so far. @WMPolice had the audacity to tweet out that it's not in the mutilated child's best interests to arrest and jail the offending parents.
1339898795329503235 2020-12-18 19:42:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @Suffragentleman Soap and water does the trick. They link to an african study that shows that men who aren't washing themselves and who have anal/vaginal sex with variety of partners with no condoms are at risk of STD, so they're chopping them instead of slapping them and telling them to wash.

The world doesn't spin around your desires, did your mother never tell you that? You don't get to tell me or anyone else that my preferences are ridiculous. The white 'race' matters to me.

So what? It's one aspect of my own, and others, identity that's important to us. Why is 'white' wrong in your eyes? My brain is freezing up here trying to deal with your prejudiced logic.
1339877207058112512 2020-12-18 18:16:34 +0800 <NKrankie> @SpergFestive @SteveRightNLeft Skin tone is very important to people who move here. All groups of people are building their own communities because they want to preserve their race/culture/religion/identities/language/etc. Skin tone is one more element of what needs preserving for all people.
1339876298139836417 2020-12-18 18:12:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @SteveRightNLeft Are you saying that skin tone and race play no part in a person's sense of individual or group identity? Science and psychology prove you very wrong, but I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on race and how 'no one' cares about it. @SpergFestive

For blacks, race was 60% important. Reason given was that in a land where white, or any race is a majority, time doesn't need to be spent on thinking about race. Whites are not the supremacists. Does that help you?

He captured and enslaved 1000s of Scots but we weren't taught this as a need for reparations or in a way that made us feel like victims.

1339521423841353728 2020-12-17 18:42:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @Stewarty2013 If you're in Glasgow I would urge you to go visit. I haven't been in that area in a long time. The last time I was there was to see a show at the Tramway. It's utterly devoid of white people. Two schools right there, handful of white children in amongst the rest.

Very aggressive in her approach. Meanwhile people are rubbing shoulders in line for escalator and rubbing shoulders in the shop. NOTHING MAKES SENSE

1339093349064650752 2020-12-16 14:21:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @SarahOwen_ What do you mean when you say white people aren't indigenous but white people are responsible for slavery? What group are you attacking because following your logic there are no English people to attack or blame. Everyone is guilty.
1339089868924870660 2020-12-16 14:07:58 +0800 <NKrankie> We took 50K huguenots in. A white Christian people.  Today we're taking in millions of people with beliefs, gods, social customs, and legal systems diff to our own. Its the amount of people today and the differences between us thats the problem.
1339089384637952000 2020-12-16 14:06:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @SarahOwen_ 50K huguenots came to uk. A number that we could take in. They were white Christians. We are currently taking in millions of people. A number far too large and from people too different to ourselves that THAT is the problem. The difference and the amount.
1339087512657072130 2020-12-16 13:58:36 +0800 <NKrankie> The psychological attack continues. They are trying to make white people feel stateless. The end game is to say everybody settled the UK and therefore it belongs to everyone. They wouldn't do this with the very very new country of Pakistan.

1338131278932152322 2020-12-13 22:38:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @kate_niven Took me a few seconds but I got it üòçüòç
1338128482782633984 2020-12-13 22:27:46 +0800 <NKrankie> Brighton private girl's school to change its syllabus.

Try getting a job with that education.   https://t.co/N3YkgHKUdH
1338127752608747520 2020-12-13 22:24:52 +0800 <NKrankie> I hope Ben remains standing and that he doesn't bow to the torrent of abuse he's receiving for being the only cricketer on the pitch not kneeling for BLM.    https://t.co/MxOBAOOAZl

1338026808307019778 2020-12-13 15:43:45 +0800 <NKrankie> Climate action necessitates population control, but no one's addressing it. Birth rates are spiralling out of control in some countries, which in turn elevates pollution, which in turn kills ecosystems, pollutes oceans, and places higher demands for fossil fuels.

1337998431621668864 2020-12-13 13:50:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer You got anything original to say from your own mind? Today you're shopping in Primark and it's normalised. In 200 years from now we might look at the atrocities of modern day slave labour and weep over our part in it. Perspective.

1337840440389808130 2020-12-13 03:23:11 +0800 <NKrankie> @Tiggersda And there was recently in 2015 a mass grave of young Scottish boys and men who were kidnapped by Cromwell found in Durham. Starved, diseased, and dumped.

1337835957270302722 2020-12-13 03:05:22 +0800 <NKrankie> Did U know that there is a 'Little Scotland' in Barbados where Cromwell sent Scots 2 B slaves, and where Scots had lower status than black slaves? And that in Dunbar in East Lothian, where a battle was fought, a lot of streets are still named after Cromwell? Will we rename them?

1337814333649268737 2020-12-13 01:39:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @Kazansky66 Nothing. Wasn't salt and pepper. The two could be moved off the woman's lap but that was it.

1337505829981999108 2020-12-12 05:13:34 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Addiction isn't always destructive. Some addictions are 'noble'. Gym, fastidiously healthy eating, addicted to doing good deeds. Worship.  Gossip is addiction. Work too. We all have our addictions.
1337505284504358917 2020-12-12 05:11:24 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious So the doctor remains the dealer and we would go to him to get our prescriptions. I am well aware of the industry and atmospheres that arise around these 'safe vans' which is why I oppose them. Addicts should be able to go to hospitals or controlled environs to inject.
1337502905469906945 2020-12-12 05:01:56 +0800 <NKrankie> Surely Scottish people must be saturated with her narcissism by this point, are we not? There's only so much I can suffer. And him behind her too. Most times they get photographed, you'd think they were on a catwalk.
1337502465051283458 2020-12-12 05:00:11 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious But you stated that if drugs were all legal then everything would be much better. I'd really love to know your vision as to who sells the legal drugs and who monitors our intake. Or is it unlimited and just as many as we can afford? You said it, I'd love you to explain further.

1337494105660813312 2020-12-12 04:26:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @BeeNubian @SirGeoffPalmer Are you living in the UK? There's this thing called 'equality under the law' that applies to every race. Might not suit your victim narrative to believe that, however. Also, there are a lot of whites out there who are impoverished and against whom people are prejudiced.
1337491179999518721 2020-12-12 04:15:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer You still on your racism horse? You're like a one trick pony. Give it up, try and find peace in your heart.
1337489409369845768 2020-12-12 04:08:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Heroin addicts already have methadone. They choose not to use it because it doesn't give them that immediate hit that they get from an injection. They have a way out. Lot of them choose not to take advantage of it. There's only so much you can do for people.
1337488954526928898 2020-12-12 04:06:30 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious You stated, produce it, tax it, and supply it. I'm very curious as to your vision. Where can we buy these legal drugs and is there a limit to our purchases. Genuinely very curious. Prescription drugs is moving the goal posts. Different argument. Addicts have methadone already.
1337488103074897922 2020-12-12 04:03:07 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious So now you're arguing against making drugs legal, because you correctly recognise their addictive nature. If a doctor can't control someone's addictions via scripts, how will the person control their addiction?
1337487774400868352 2020-12-12 04:01:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious U want drugs to be made legal. Tax it and supply it you say. I'd assume you mean on the high street, or else UR in support of big pharma controlling the drug trade + docs R dealers. Perhaps U can B clearer as to the drug outlets and where can we purchase them and in what amounts
1337486938102755330 2020-12-12 03:58:30 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Legal from a high street shop? Legal to buy in any quantity one chooses and to the extent one can afford the purchase?
1337484948995969028 2020-12-12 03:50:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Sorry, I need enlightened. Legalise heroin you say, produce it, tax it, make it safe. How does that work? Who can function on heroin? Who can afford it if they can't function? Heroin addicts need greater doses of it in order to feel it. Heroin is addictive, hardly recreational.
1337482387538780161 2020-12-12 03:40:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Okay, that's yet another statement you've made that lets me know that you know nothing about drug addicts and living among them. Let's just leave it there.
1337481251670941701 2020-12-12 03:35:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious It never is safe though. Making drugs legal, do you think that doesn't create addicts?
1337480062799589377 2020-12-12 03:31:10 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Your house is broken into, your TV is stolen and any jewellery. You've no insurance on your items. You're a single woman. You have no money and you can't get out. You're telling me you'd still support addicts who steal and do anything to get drug money? Tsk tsk.
1337478759113494528 2020-12-12 03:25:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Look at how easy we all drink and smoke, and look at the damage that does. If drugs are legal, look how much worse and stupid we'd be as humans. We wouldn't function, and then we couldn't finance our usage. Life gets destroyed but in a different manner.
1337478463054295041 2020-12-12 03:24:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious I respect you have an opinion on this, but it's quite a simplistic and naive one. Well intentioned though. Try being on the breadline in an area rife with these people and you can't get out of it and your life is blighted by them. You wouldn't hold the same opinion.

1337476829561688066 2020-12-12 03:18:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious How does your mother's career make you an expert? Have you lived in areas of high addiction and criminality and had your daily life made a living hell because of the addicts? Have you been afraid walking up your dark close at night?
1337475557165051905 2020-12-12 03:13:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious But you've never lived in these areas, Caroline. In your west coast home that you post pictures of, you own horses, and have land. You are at your 2nd home in Italy. You're not living in amongst deprivation. Perhaps simply listen and reflect.
1337474976950202369 2020-12-12 03:10:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Again, your appeal to emotion. I don't get the impression you have any hands on experience of this topic. I don't for one second think you have lived in Calton, or Possil, or Parkhead, or any of these areas that are destroyed by drugs and addiction.
1337474418545659905 2020-12-12 03:08:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Have you had much experience with drug addicts/dealers, Caroline, or is your opinion one that's coming from a place of good intentions? Have you lived a life in a community being destroyed by alcohol and drugs?
1337474096779698179 2020-12-12 03:07:28 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious The point is I have moral standards that I live by and which I would expect from any community I live in (without being a prude). I don't want prostitutes or drug addicts/dealers in my area. And you can only help people so much, the rest is on their shoulders.
1337473789823766528 2020-12-12 03:06:15 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious I'm hearing you loud and clear and I'm disagreeing with you just as loudly. Injecting heroin is not harm reduction. At best he's facilitating a suicide or overdose.
1337473450567491584 2020-12-12 03:04:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious I do, I followed this story a few months ago. He was charged with obstructing police who wanted to search the addicts in his van. He wouldn't let them. Contents of van listed also.    https://t.co/QHIsbjOewA
1337472648788520960 2020-12-12 03:01:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious That then is removing autonomy from people. Who are we to say adults life choices are wrong for them? Drugs don't work. I'd rather pump money into facilities where addicts can shower, get clean, fresh clothing. There's a lack of those facilities. Drug usage shouldnt be supported
1337472006565060608 2020-12-12 02:59:10 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious Again, you're ignoring the onstreet businesses that will spring up around his van. Touts, dealers, prostitution, and the zombies who will be out of their minds, and who will often pass out a few feet from the van. Heroin makes them pass out.
1337471393064230913 2020-12-12 02:56:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious But how does the consumption van prevent deaths? It's not medically equipped with anything but sterile needles. It is at best a chance to overdose in a van instead of an alley.
1337471205604020231 2020-12-12 02:55:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious 2 - prostitution has been decriminalised. It's the kerb crawlers who get fined, not the ladies. Your plea goes against human nature. Power struggles will always exist. Get people hooked on legal drugs, they can't function, can't work, where does money come from for drugs? Crime
1337470767378915331 2020-12-12 02:54:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious 1 - If your next door neighbour is violent and makes the community's life a living hell, is that okay because he's someone's son and we can't move him along? You're making an appeal to emotion now.
1337470180096679938 2020-12-12 02:51:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @simon4124 @Brum_XR You're talking to a parody account.
1337469169990774786 2020-12-12 02:47:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious We see addicts waiting in the chemist to get their methadone given to them in a private room because they can't be trusted not to sell it. Shooting up in a chemist under supervision or assisted is about as far as I'd go in agreeing with it. Not in the community in a van though.
1337468571321049088 2020-12-12 02:45:31 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious I have sympathy to a degree with addicts. If hundreds are dying of overdose as you say, then what difference does it make if they die in peter's van or on the street? His van doesn't stop the overdose. I'm against brothels. I'm against shoot-up spaces to same degree.
1337468111071698953 2020-12-12 02:43:41 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious If there were an issue with addicts in my area, I'd ensure the police and council move them along, not bring a shoot up van in to make their drug abuse easier. They wouldn't get to feel comfortable or at home.
1337466171411603458 2020-12-12 02:35:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious I would argue that saving lives isn't assisting people to shoot up, it would be with outreach and support, helping people gain skills and self esteem, housing, a life free of addiction. Not keeping them on the hamster wheel. We have very different views on this. üëçüëç
1337465707143942144 2020-12-12 02:34:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious I wouldn't want him anywhere near my door. With drugs comes criminality and violence, robberies and prostitution. It's one thing to be handing out free and clean equipment  but they shoot up and then they linger in the area. So you've got zombies to deal with in the aftermath
1337463054632710149 2020-12-12 02:23:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious And can we pilot run this scheme outside your house or on your block? My other concern would be strength and purity of the drug. Is the man kitted out with medical equipment to revive people in the event of seizure or overdose? It's a complex discussion.
1337461897285787650 2020-12-12 02:18:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @Casumptious I think we'll disagree on this one. These spots will be magnets. Anyone who doesn't have drugs will know they can hang around there to scrounge some off someone going in. You'll have dealing as well in no time.

Mad Dog Maddox springs to mind, but now AG Barr is guilty of helping to supress all news of Hunter Biden's wrongdoings until after the election was over. Why would he do that?   https://t.co/L1nXI4LrnS

1337109066942910464 2020-12-11 02:56:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @realjohnhendry It'd be interesting to see if the 'bold new take' on Cinderella is a change in the story, or if it's simply that the Prince is black. It'd also be interesting to see a white Lion King production.

1336813095314976769 2020-12-10 07:20:53 +0800 <NKrankie> I don't know anything about schizophrenia, but this woman seems very calculated. CCTV footage shows her buying the knife and then walking to the park where she killed Emily Jones. Very premeditated.    https://t.co/uu1H79VvN3

1336405272701628418 2020-12-09 04:20:20 +0800 <NKrankie> Females can't tackle men. This should be a wake up call to the police to remove women from front line work. Be as upset as you like, but its a biological inconvenience that needs to be acknowledged as respect for the law breaks down, and as the police engage in political policing
1336404599830421509 2020-12-09 04:17:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @leicspolice Perhaps petite, slight females shouldn't be on the streets trying to apprehend males. Biological inconvenience.
1336403693210636291 2020-12-09 04:14:04 +0800 <NKrankie> @AmigoNews20 Sounds like a footballer.
1336393434479947779 2020-12-09 03:33:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @StroudApex That's a brilliant name.
1336392273735651328 2020-12-09 03:28:41 +0800 <NKrankie> @alanm8412 He's adorable. I love that gif. üòç
1336392084996157443 2020-12-09 03:27:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @JohnRob69887811 I enjoy watching her squish her mouth around as she tries to stop her dentures falling out.  https://t.co/L7oredOTfA

1336391206134292485 2020-12-09 03:24:27 +0800 <NKrankie> If you're not getting vaccinated, what name would you prefer to be known by?
1336389614739795982 2020-12-09 03:18:07 +0800 <NKrankie> @ClimateWarrior7 What will they call us? Orwell mentions Proles in 1984. We should name ourselves before they do. That way we get to pick the name.  Undead. Unvaxxed.
1336387392320704513 2020-12-09 03:09:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @Highlandfreethi @NicolaSturgeon Great point. Our fishing villages are dead. @Casumptious is very knowledgeable about why snp are failing our villages and fishermen
1336387130856251393 2020-12-09 03:08:15 +0800 <NKrankie> @jorockcod She's great. Enjoyed watching her ever since Muriels wedding.
1336385611234734080 2020-12-09 03:02:13 +0800 <NKrankie> @realjohnhendry They're now saying he 'blinked' during the talks
1336385453608538122 2020-12-09 03:01:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @lordofshropshie I despise tom hanks. But thank you.
1336385336277086214 2020-12-09 03:01:07 +0800 <NKrankie> @leighkeystone I should adopt the same attitude because I'd like to watch that movie.
1336385223702011907 2020-12-09 03:00:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @jorockcod Yes I have Netflix but I've never heard of unbelievable. I shall look it up. Thanks for the recommendation
1336380608055009289 2020-12-09 02:42:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @leighkeystone I wanted to watch 1917 but benedict cumberbatch is in it. He's an insufferable leftie. Cant watch him.
1336373464815579140 2020-12-09 02:13:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @ripx4nutmeg Regrettably, he's a POC. They tend to have their grievances taken more seriously than white people get theirs taken. Sorry state of affairs we're in. I'll be keeping an eye on it.
1336373063299063810 2020-12-09 02:12:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @jorockcod Enjoy. I'm hooked on it. üòç
1336372062047309828 2020-12-09 02:08:22 +0800 <NKrankie> I'm watching Unforgettable on Amazon Prime if anyone is looking for a great police drama. Female detective who never forgets a thing.
1336371267541360641 2020-12-09 02:05:13 +0800 <NKrankie> @GallIain Their contempt and disregard for truth and the law and for us is incredible.
1336367094267588609 2020-12-09 01:48:38 +0800 <NKrankie> China is engaging in 'gene editing' with its military in a bid to make super soldiers. It's already 2 million strong. Largest army and navy in the world, and growing. This won't end well for humanity. We need Trump. Only person standing up to them.    https://t.co/60zw7f5z9y
1336361171998412802 2020-12-09 01:25:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @GallIain Hey @EternalEnglish I also really like Iain's voice. He's north east I think.
1336360994101223428 2020-12-09 01:24:24 +0800 <NKrankie> @GallIain Thanks. I love your accent. Hope you win our competition. No prizes mind.
1336359186637205505 2020-12-09 01:17:13 +0800 <NKrankie> @BristolComSense @EternalEnglish Rab is a bit more coarse, mair glesgay than hur.
1336358654837133317 2020-12-09 01:15:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @OBAHIANO4 In the picture. Can't you see? Have you any eyes? Some cultures have different practices from others. It's not 'British' for a man to think he can lock a woman in marriage.
1336358131102871554 2020-12-09 01:13:01 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish How long did you live in Edinburgh? I always enjoy a visit through there.
1336358013272268801 2020-12-09 01:12:33 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish Hey @GallIain can you tag us in your video where you're chastising camilla for annoying the highland coos? We're listening to Scottish accents.
1336355259065757699 2020-12-09 01:01:36 +0800 <NKrankie> @ClimateWarrior7 Exciting, there's some life left in me yet. Do I get to pick? Are people allowed to reject me?
1336354981411164160 2020-12-09 01:00:30 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish And the way he says period and distance. The lilt at the top of the word.
1336354780826963970 2020-12-09 00:59:42 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish Open the link and play the video. Listen to this man speaking. He has a nice voice. I love the way he says 'opun, we're no opun'.  Soft and lovely. I think he's outside Edinburgh.  https://t.co/imQybB23Z8
1336353044817207297 2020-12-09 00:52:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish That's a lazy language she's speaking as well. Ah'm gonnae hae weans. Probably votes SNP an aw, ye ken?
1336352813140619265 2020-12-09 00:51:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish The Dunfermline accent is lovely. East coast of Scotland is better than west coast for sure.
1336352629019041799 2020-12-09 00:51:09 +0800 <NKrankie> @E78James So did I at first. I was rubbing my hands with delight at his oncoming meltdown.

1336351429775290369 2020-12-09 00:46:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish It's west coast Glasgow. I hear it on a daily basis. I sound like that. Hard to be nostalgic for something you don't miss. She's very pretty, but there's far lovelier Scottish burrs out there. West coast is steeped in Irish-isms, which I don't like.
1336337197058850821 2020-12-08 23:49:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish As a Scot, I cringe when I hear this.
1336336722552995849 2020-12-08 23:47:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @ripx4nutmeg any interest? Now we can't get a divorce from them.

1336329542781169664 2020-12-08 23:19:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @ginacarano You're amazing. I recently saw you in a movie. It was quite violent, but the violence aside you really are a beauty. Takes me back to the days of real Hollywood glamour. Best wishes.
1336325645610012678 2020-12-08 23:03:56 +0800 <NKrankie> The war on white men continues. Chicago teachers' union is saying that it's racist, sexist, and misogynistic to keep schools open. Are there no white boys in their schools? Are they the only ones immune to catching covid?  https://t.co/2f1K5wjSjS
1336323468866985985 2020-12-08 22:55:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Yes, those impartial fact checkers at the BBC. That's another sign of your guilt.
1336322621445558274 2020-12-08 22:51:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer That absolute state of this. @DougRambo4 I'm going with dementia. How bout you?
1336322393560604672 2020-12-08 22:51:00 +0800 <NKrankie> @DougRambo4 He's been on at me non stop since 10 am this morning. It's now almost 3. He is unhinged.

1336318725050433543 2020-12-08 22:36:26 +0800 <NKrankie> @FenrirWolf26 @DeclanMcmurphy Yes, Daniel is so funny. I've enjoyed a lot of his songs.
1336318465955676162 2020-12-08 22:35:24 +0800 <NKrankie> @DougRambo4 Are you following his sentence structure or logic? I'm lost. No wonder he couldn't put his question to me in a legible manner.

1336317215646179331 2020-12-08 22:30:26 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Are you saying that not liking a black person or commenting on a black person equate to prejudice? How backwards.
1336311701898207239 2020-12-08 22:08:31 +0800 <NKrankie> @DougRambo4 Honestly, they need to start recognising that black privilege exists to a higher degree than white privilege does in the UK
1336311489846718465 2020-12-08 22:07:41 +0800 <NKrankie> @JohnRob69887811 He is a big fan of immigration. I think his step mother is Spanish and he speaks fluent Spanish, so he's all about 'the more the merrier'.

1336309253905199105 2020-12-08 21:58:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer You're exposing yourself as an idiot who doesn't have a life. Now away and do some good deeds and cease and desist with your race hustling.
1336308581071773697 2020-12-08 21:56:07 +0800 <NKrankie> He is a pakistani migrant. Police in Germany hunting him for raping a woman while holding her in place with a chain around her neck.    https://t.co/YU1fMwPgVT

1336306608763179009 2020-12-08 21:48:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @restalrig @SirGeoffPalmer Especially when he charged Sir Keith Joseph of racism. You'll notice he waited until the man was dead and couldn't drag him through the courts. He has never provided the proof or a witness to this day.
1336305718899699718 2020-12-08 21:44:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Of course discrimination follows a person for life, that's why Keith Joseph is coming back to haunt you.  https://t.co/zo9Wa680O9

1336298850395557888 2020-12-08 21:17:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @E78James Thank you. Its either madness or dementia.
1336298301617008641 2020-12-08 21:15:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Thought you are out doing good deeds? Now provide your proof that the intellectual giant Keith Joseph was racist against you?   https://t.co/W9uAmoKM3l

1336276097755963392 2020-12-08 19:47:03 +0800 <NKrankie> This is what being proud to be British means? All the other countless crimes they allow against British people and communities and suddenly hes proud to be British because big pharma have rolled out a dodgy vaccine.
1336273187567439872 2020-12-08 19:35:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @LeeWinterburn1 People like @SirGeoffPalmer are getting paid good money to keep racism alive.
1336270885045538817 2020-12-08 19:26:20 +0800 <NKrankie> Here we go. This should be interesting to see if he'll lie under oath. He's already stated that he never discussed anything with wee nippy.    https://t.co/Wdm5IvHAvg

1336267177780015105 2020-12-08 19:11:36 +0800 <NKrankie> @annewitha_e @SirGeoffPalmer And some people like to attack others with their false grievances like Geoff with his 2:2 is doing.
1336266689747488769 2020-12-08 19:09:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer So you can't put a simple question to me? Mr. 2;2.  You can't simplify your superior intellect into one simple twitter question?
1336266479340228609 2020-12-08 19:08:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @Barbi_bb @ChairmanBoab @SirGeoffPalmer Holocaust and transatlantic trade are the two that certain groups are monopolizing as their own now.
1336265766002421760 2020-12-08 19:05:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @FenrirWolf26 And he's a professor. He's quote tweeting at me like a loon with a machine gun. It's quite worrying.
1336265551728037890 2020-12-08 19:05:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @ChairmanBoab @Barbi_bb @SirGeoffPalmer I will when he puts the question to me. So far it's simply been an instruction of people to read. 2:2 at uni though.
1336265166468558848 2020-12-08 19:03:36 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer That's not a question, it's an instruction to go read a bunch of authors. 2:2

1336264058044116993 2020-12-08 18:59:12 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Is there a hidden question in here, Mr. 2:2?   If there is, I can't find it. Now, again, if you have the intellect and courage to put the question to me in a simple manner, I'm waiting.  https://t.co/N4V2Clas4l
1336263173398257666 2020-12-08 18:55:41 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Pretend I'm hard of hearing Mr. 2:2 and repeat the question without requiring me to also read a list of authors. I'll wait.
1336262917180846080 2020-12-08 18:54:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer You got a 2:2 at uni. I'll leave it there.
1336262375826219010 2020-12-08 18:52:31 +0800 <NKrankie> @Barbi_bb He only got a 2:2?  So he's running on brown privilege than? @SirGeoffPalmer
1336262218875342849 2020-12-08 18:51:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer You didn't ask me a question. You told me to read several authors in a manner that may or may not have concealed a question. If you have anything straightforward to ask me, then kindly do.
1336261918273761280 2020-12-08 18:50:42 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer @restalrig You have revealed your character to the world this morning. You are deranged and I've archived all of your deranged replies for future use. You are unhinged, sir. Go get medical help.
1336261557064445954 2020-12-08 18:49:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @restalrig @SirGeoffPalmer Now address the selective outrage part of it. And direct me to any of his 'passions' that talk about how black people rounded up, enslaved, entrapped, and sold off other black people into slavery. I'll patiently wait for something that doesn't seek to only blame the white man
1336259750019862528 2020-12-08 18:42:05 +0800 <NKrankie> @restalrig @SirGeoffPalmer Passion for what? His selective outrage? The fact that he's reaping rewards in a land that he is attacking? What exactly is his passion?
1336258481947611138 2020-12-08 18:37:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer You are in an elevated position in a white land. You enjoy your status in a white land  if white man is so bad why don't you pick a black land to live in? You are reaping the rewards of 'colonialism and empire'.
1336257975657377792 2020-12-08 18:35:02 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer You are tweeting like a demented loon and talking to yourself. The consequences of our history is that everyone is now living in a land with equal access of opportunity. YOU however are calling for special treatment above everyone else. You're not going to get it.
1336256659337916416 2020-12-08 18:29:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @standardnews @mgt_coull26 Here she is strangling a woman.  https://t.co/GnlW5bMaPr
1336256437111164928 2020-12-08 18:28:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @HaydenHewitt It's a sexual fetish, is it not? Doesn't sound like much more. And I would direct you to Buck also at this point.
1336255275431583745 2020-12-08 18:24:18 +0800 <NKrankie> I'll ask ACLU about their agenda, not their pronouns.

1336254881989005314 2020-12-08 18:22:44 +0800 <NKrankie> When Catwoman said, 'I am woman. Hear me roar'. This isn't the kind of screeching she was on about. I wonder if this girl has recovered from whatever it was that was upsetting her that day.  https://t.co/Eyug93rbm2
1336254270472134662 2020-12-08 18:20:19 +0800 <NKrankie> These 'it's our duty' to get vaccinated faces will turn into compo faces in 6 months time. I guarantee it. That smile will be wiped right off their faces when they start growing another set of lips, a new chin and a third eye.  https://t.co/bd3Nzs9vyr
1336253228254711812 2020-12-08 18:16:10 +0800 <NKrankie> Do you ever feel that when someone is so overwrought and emotional about a thing, it's kind of like misplaced anger? As though they need to identify the hurt and properly direct the rage? @SirGeoffPalmer was never a slave, and yet he's hand wringing and obsessed about it.

1336250912390717441 2020-12-08 18:06:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Drag yourself into the present moment. You are selectively outraged over a choice time period in history. You are stuck in a moment.
1336247367637626880 2020-12-08 17:52:53 +0800 <NKrankie> 4 days ago. Paisley care home throws a farewell party for a staff member and no one is wearing masks or PPE, and no distancing.

1336243718907711489 2020-12-08 17:38:23 +0800 <NKrankie> Non-fatal strangulation of women is the most common form of assault by partners and others. Here is @KayBurley publicly strangling a woman in what the media would have us believe is a crime committed only by men.    https://t.co/TRCj1CKq6T  https://t.co/Qj1Wf84jIc
1336237378860670976 2020-12-08 17:13:11 +0800 <NKrankie> Try to make yourself sound more Scottishy and it's all all-right then. It's joost a wee jag. How patronising and insulting. This is a council leader. LOL.
1336237050220130306 2020-12-08 17:11:53 +0800 <NKrankie> Renaming streets ands statues is soon to become boo'd to the same extent that fans are booing footballers who take a knee prior to a match. It's dull and we're sick to death of it. Read the room. Read the public mood. @SirGeoffPalmer @adamrmcvey We don't want or need it.
1336236475197878272 2020-12-08 17:09:36 +0800 <NKrankie> @stevenarchibal2 Yes, she always is neutral. On stage at an awards show with jane fonda and lily tomlin, they started attacking Trump and she wouldn't join them. She just looked surprised and stunned at the outburst unfolding.

1336093656214855682 2020-12-08 07:42:05 +0800 <NKrankie> @NicoliarSturge1 Like a rapist in a Wendy house.

1336090533027049473 2020-12-08 07:29:41 +0800 <NKrankie> Another disappointment. I think dolly is too nice for her own good. Cant believe she's only 74. I felt sure she was 84.    https://t.co/d7hIYa7a53

1336085978121965574 2020-12-08 07:11:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @FenrirWolf26 Thats whats concerning. Hos blind reluctance to pause snx refldct and perhaps learn something, or gauge the public mood. This man is tasked with examining edin street names and statues. God help us all.
1336085606942826496 2020-12-08 07:10:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn Now now. We can't control our features. Theres an old shoe out there for every old sock.
1336085304177020936 2020-12-08 07:08:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @FenrirWolf26 Hes a professor. His tweets are infantile. He's talking to himself and quote tweeting bots to make himself look good. I'm worried.

1336059804121444353 2020-12-08 05:27:34 +0800 <NKrankie> @BBCSport Its still political. How about they just kick the silly ball around?
1336049464776257537 2020-12-08 04:46:29 +0800 <NKrankie> I want to see the arrests, fast. Another worker caught scanning ballots multiple times.    https://t.co/kbVe5xGWaS

1336044606551633921 2020-12-08 04:27:11 +0800 <NKrankie> The term 'Essex girl' has now been removed from dictionaries because it is deemed to be offensive.

1336017928723046406 2020-12-08 02:41:10 +0800 <NKrankie> @PFA Players' kneeling is a sad indictment on the lack of understanding that sports is escapism for a lot of people. They don't want to think of politics or world problems.

1335994856070635520 2020-12-08 01:09:29 +0800 <NKrankie> Pakistan - the headline tells you all you need to know. Tens of thousands gather to mourn an imam who terrorised minorities. He also called for the destruction of Europe.   https://t.co/O7ReqLVH8A
1335994367711059968 2020-12-08 01:07:33 +0800 <NKrankie> Canada - pakistani immigrant imam rapes a woman, and the entire community shuns her for getting an imam jailed. They think she is 'not a good woman'. She is being victim shamed, and he went to extreme lengths to lie to immigration.   https://t.co/FRtuyUkQc5

1335986627269812225 2020-12-08 00:36:48 +0800 <NKrankie> And here we go again through the never ending revolving doors of racism. Police Scotland is apparently now saturated in it.

1335886069980663809 2020-12-07 17:57:13 +0800 <NKrankie> A positive article on how whites abolished slavery. Slavs were among the very first slaves and whom 'slaves' is coined. How Arabs used more slaves and for far longer a period than the white man. Why is Islam getting a free pass to slavery?    https://t.co/mbQ0khrRiX

There's much he can do in real time to address current day slavery. He's a moral coward, however, and he won't.
1335855390005858305 2020-12-07 15:55:18 +0800 <NKrankie> Genius. Definitely one of my favourites. Rome is all the better for having this man's sculptures in it.

1335850567558684672 2020-12-07 15:36:08 +0800 <NKrankie> And even if it did mean booing black people then that also is perfectly fine and not a huggable offence. Freedom of expression.
1335850031446978560 2020-12-07 15:34:01 +0800 <NKrankie> @Sian_J67 @NoXYinXXprisons @HRWales1 @Karen21001230 @westmidspolfed Or is it that women rarely do jail time? A woman was found not guilty of raping a 14 y/o boy couple of days ago in spite of there being a witness to her actions.
1335849371892637698 2020-12-07 15:31:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @NoXYinXXprisons @Sian_J67 @HRWales1 @Karen21001230 @westmidspolfed And the female privilege card which sees women do little or no jail time even when they commit the same crime as a man. Turning trans opens up a world of privilege.
1335848624090132480 2020-12-07 15:28:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @MissCry09105761 A lot of people in crisis are using drugs and alcohol. Abused kids and rape victims turn to substances in order to cope. I get the broad point you're making but it's unfortunately not so simple of an issue.
1335846347233259521 2020-12-07 15:19:22 +0800 <NKrankie> Very positive. Massive overhaul 2 the human rights act.

1335735845899431938 2020-12-07 08:00:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer Is it your age? This will be the 3rd time I'm denouncing all forms of slavery from every race of people. Its not my fault that you think white man's involvement in slavery is the biggest sin.
1335735507607818250 2020-12-07 07:58:56 +0800 <NKrankie> This bothers me. When someone who has never been a slave on a plantation claims to know the magnitude of how bad it felt. They're using people's suffering as a means of political point scoring today. Absolutely shameful.
1335735108104544258 2020-12-07 07:57:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer Why are you liking and retweeting your own reply? I've been clear from the start that I oppose slavery. I also oppose selective outrage, which is what I'm seeing right now with all the white bashing. I also don't like it when you claim to know how plantation slavery felt. U CANT
1335730121173557250 2020-12-07 07:37:32 +0800 <NKrankie> I've asked him to but he's not denouncing muhammad's role in the slave trade. He's stuck on the white man.

1335728902690500611 2020-12-07 07:32:41 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer Muhammad was a prolific slave trader. Can you publicly denounce muhammad and islam's role in the slave trade?
1335728315957731335 2020-12-07 07:30:21 +0800 <NKrankie> He's still going after the buyer and not the seller. It's the seller who needs to be addressed. And that seller is Africa.
1335728129525096448 2020-12-07 07:29:37 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer And I think blacks have a special responsibility to aggressively and thoroughly denounce the fact that their ancestors rounded them up like animals and sold them off at a pittance. Can you denounce that? Can you address that? You keep deflecting.
1335727713441751047 2020-12-07 07:27:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @DavidPoulden You're killing me with that intro. I love it. Talking away to yourself like a crazy person üòçüòçüòç
1335727434457608192 2020-12-07 07:26:51 +0800 <NKrankie> See, they do not care who enslaved them if the person wasn't white. It's an anti white racist bias.
1335727317583323136 2020-12-07 07:26:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer At no point have I said slavery is okay. I don't think the enslavement of any group of people is okay, but you seem to only want black slavery by white man to be denounced, which I find quite sinister. I denounce all slavery by all peoples. Hope you do too.
1335726896345182214 2020-12-07 07:24:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer Also, given Islam's massive role in slave trade, and they still selling black men at market in Libya today, will Geoff be examining every mosque in Edin to make sure they're not named after a slaver trader, or being funded from a country who participates in slavery?
1335726417401835520 2020-12-07 07:22:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer Have you written on blacks role in slavery? They started it after all, rounding up their own and selling them. Do you place culpability firmly on ancestry? I'd love to read anything you've written on it if it's online.
1335726184362094599 2020-12-07 07:21:53 +0800 <NKrankie> Muhammad founded large+lucrative slave trade. Black men R being sold still in Libya today. R we investigating mosques opening in Scotland 2 C if they're named after slave owners or funded from countries who still practice slavery of blacks?  Do we care about that?
1335723680928763904 2020-12-07 07:11:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer Are you going after Arab slave traders? Muhammad started a huge and very lucrative market in black slavery.
1335723412535304192 2020-12-07 07:10:52 +0800 <NKrankie> They are only going after white slave traders. No mention of the massive scale on which arabs enslaved blacks and sold them at market, a practice which still happens today.
1335723193684942849 2020-12-07 07:10:00 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer Of course, but going after white slave traders is like going after the person who buys drugs + not the dealer. Also, blacks sold to anyone. Are you going after Arabs who enslaved blacks and who are still selling them at market today? Or is it just white slave traders you oppose?
1335719050744393734 2020-12-07 06:53:32 +0800 <NKrankie> @dondee_don @SirGeoffPalmer I want to know more about an entire continent hunting down, capturing, enslaving and selling off their own people. I want to know more about this evil. Have black people confronted their own pasts and made peace with it? Their own ancestors?
1335714489409400835 2020-12-07 06:35:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Do you think black people have confronted their own histories, or are they deflecting by blaming the white man? Do you feel that addressing their histories at the hands of their own people, blacks might be able to begin to heal and stop blaming others?
1335714279362879488 2020-12-07 06:34:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @SirGeoffPalmer Do you have any writings you can link me to where you discuss the black man's part in the African slave trade? I'd like to know more about the phenomenon of Africa capturing and enslaving their own people for a pittance to the highest bidder.

1334471917336719360 2020-12-03 20:17:53 +0800 <NKrankie> I have to say, I don't think Mr. Trump is going to pull this one out. I think we're going to have 4 years of Harris as your first BAME female president (who didn't get there through merit or talent, it must be noted).

1334470659758583811 2020-12-03 20:12:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @alkhaled3030 @1Fubar I'd argue the case with the 15-18 year old girl that they met too early, but there doesn't seem to have been rape involved if she willingly continued the relationship. Some 15 y/o's are too grown up for their own good these days. I know 15y/o can't legally consent. I know.
1334470187920347136 2020-12-03 20:11:00 +0800 <NKrankie> Trump won't pass a defence policy bill unless Section 230 is included in it in order to be repealed.

1334068117786529794 2020-12-02 17:33:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @FoxyVillain1981 Yes, and even with Africans coming in, they bring their tribal and group grievances with them. Eastern Europeans in some countries are not a fan of others from their neighbouring lands.

1334066834216194048 2020-12-02 17:28:13 +0800 <NKrankie> There is tension between groups of people, and it's gangs of men on both sides, media is neglecting to factor in rivalries or hatred from Romanians, etc. towards muslims, and vice versa. They still focus on 'far right white'. It ignores the problems we face through multicult

A pig's head was dumped outside a pharmacy in Birmingham, but because it's within walking distance of a mosque, the police are on the hunt for 'hate crime'.    https://t.co/RXFWnYPljv
1334063841500663808 2020-12-02 17:16:20 +0800 <NKrankie> Muslims are demanding halal covid vaccines. I think vaccines contain traces of gelatine or pig product. If muslims don't get covic vaccine, do they still get their 'freedom pass'?    https://t.co/kt5vC4lx2d
1334063400201150464 2020-12-02 17:14:34 +0800 <NKrankie> Imam in Paris needed 6 armed guards with him at all times because he publicly denounced terrorism, and he advocated for religious tolerance from Muslims.

1334063082637811712 2020-12-02 17:13:19 +0800 <NKrankie> Islamic folly. Nottingham mosque shares a picture of these two men who have just gotten married. Muslims on twitter explode in a rage thinking the men married each other. Mosque can't post the pictures of the brides coz it's forbidden in Islam.     https://t.co/DMCCsucRtJ

1333706036239339527 2020-12-01 17:34:32 +0800 <NKrankie> @Douglas4Moray If you support these payments, you're part of the problem. And if you think the NHS denying us all treatment if we don't have covid, then you're also part of the problem.
1333705594625282049 2020-12-01 17:32:47 +0800 <NKrankie> @QuatloosX if you're still around?  Wee challenge for you?
1333705476639514624 2020-12-01 17:32:19 +0800 <NKrankie> Who can stick wee nippy's head onto an Oprah gif where she's handing out free money to everyone?  https://t.co/gXTKvWyYpm
1333705239904587776 2020-12-01 17:31:22 +0800 <NKrankie> Sturgeon has endeared herself to a Communist/Marxist media by appearing on TV every day for the past 9 months in her daily briefings (pretending to care and pretending to be competent while our elderly have been dropping like flies), and now like Oprah giving away free money

1333659706578116608 2020-12-01 14:30:26 +0800 <NKrankie> Putting -phobic and -ist onto the end of words has been the laziest counter argument ever.  Here's hoping debate gets a little bit more intellectual in the new year. I hope the left can be bothered to raise the bar a notch.

1333540382886539270 2020-12-01 06:36:17 +0800 <NKrankie> These empty buzz words. Kindness. Compassion. Equality. Independence doesn't deliver these things. Independence won't stop the rampant hatred of the English that the SNP harbour. SNP are incapable of being kind today.

1333532405408301058 2020-12-01 06:04:35 +0800 <NKrankie> By cheating in the US elections the left stole from Americans what should have been an overwhelmingly positive + affirming + historic moment in time. Even if Trump gets a second term, the left have robbed it of its joy and legality. One more thing I'll never forgive the left for

1333491898141569027 2020-12-01 03:23:38 +0800 <NKrankie> Another appeal to emotion. Nothing more than manipulation under the guise of doing good. She is an evil woman

1333474856076275718 2020-12-01 02:15:55 +0800 <NKrankie> Food shop staff and bus/train drivers and long distance lorry drivers and bin men all deserve 'front line' money from NHS not just nurses. Shop staff risked their lives so we could all eat.
1333474567508160512 2020-12-01 02:14:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @douzpwa @anne_mummag Food shop staff deserve it also then.

1333466409582678019 2020-12-01 01:42:21 +0800 <NKrankie> No one is moving to diverse and enriched areas. We are fleeing from them if finances allow. Some people are still trapped in them, but there is no pattern I can see of white people moving into areas where they know they will be the minority.

1333465168668479491 2020-12-01 01:37:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish It must be hard for parents to accept at 15 that your child is now suddenly the opposite sex.

1333457112513597440 2020-12-01 01:05:24 +0800 <NKrankie> @juanito_f90 As stated, I will blame anyone and everyone who knows what's going on and is staying silent. Their job is to treat the general public.

It's the exact same thing with nurses. They know they're not overwhelmed, they know there's tons of beds lying empty, they know people are dying from cancer unattended.
1333456127242219523 2020-12-01 01:01:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @Vroomfondelll Scotland is a land of lazy voters and political illiterates. It's the west coast who vote for her, and that's the Glasgow area, which is the most densely populated. She is an absolute nedette.

1333452440323100674 2020-12-01 00:46:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @juanito_f90 Perhaps you can ask her why cancer deaths have sky rocketed through NHS neglect, and why non covid people struggle to get seen. Operations postponed, transplants postponed, screenings postponed.
1333447277382430720 2020-12-01 00:26:19 +0800 <NKrankie> Trans ministers now bullying conservative christians. The bible does say that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. There's no leeway, and it's not hatred to quote it. Religion shouldn't give these people one inch of room.

1333285515240607744 2020-11-30 13:43:32 +0800 <NKrankie> Instead of tackling climate change, we should be addressing birth rates. Some countries/ demographics having way too many offspring. A pause for a generation or two might see the planet replenish itself. Look how good lockdown has been to rivers and nature.

1333151195670736898 2020-11-30 04:49:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @genderisharmful Gender is their perception of their sex. They know their biology cannot change, so they say that their gender identity is fluid. Gender is not sex. Gender is a state of mind. Took me a while but I think that's the gist of it.

1331568798453915653 2020-11-25 20:01:55 +0800 <NKrankie> Men are going to have to wade into this trans debate at some point. Women are getting nowhere. And it is men we're dealing with after all, not biological women. So it seems to me there's a place for men's voices in this debate.
1331568456823689216 2020-11-25 20:00:34 +0800 <NKrankie> @AmAmbient Well we're all very glad that the tee shirt didn't fit you, so to speak.
1331555971362152448 2020-11-25 19:10:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @stewtgriffiths You're assuming Scots want rid of her. Scots are politically illiterate and a nation of lazy voters. The fact that her and SNP are in power should tell you all you need to know about Scottish people. To be fair, it's mainly the west coast IRA brigade.
1331549338410029056 2020-11-25 18:44:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @stewtgriffiths I despise her.

1331548020815646722 2020-11-25 18:39:21 +0800 <NKrankie> Who was that Labour MP, some minister of health or something who said there's no evidence that suicide is on the rise? Scotland's suicide rate hit an 8 year high. 833 in a year. Men were 75% of all suicides.    https://t.co/ydLO9QD0iE

1331372758434000896 2020-11-25 07:02:55 +0800 <NKrankie> I think the left are trying to deconstruct language to the point where nothing means anything any more. And if you don't have a cohesive and logical point to make or to stand by, then you basically don't have a defence against their attacks. It's redundant, but that's what it is
1331372025475174403 2020-11-25 07:00:01 +0800 <NKrankie> I personally find immorality to be a turn off. What's attractive to me in people is their morals.
1331371865873453062 2020-11-25 06:59:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @Albion_Rover I think a lack of a moral compass is a deeply damaging thing to the younger generation today. With no moral code, there's no sense of self worth.

The world is on your side. Defending your masculinity doesn't mean slating others, just putting forth good reasons as to why we need manly men.

1331368706736263168 2020-11-25 06:46:49 +0800 <NKrankie> I find this trend of 'non binary' to be tiresome. Wearing a pink top and some eye liner isn't ground-breaking. Robert Smith of the Cure did it far better, many years ago.

1331200308891037696 2020-11-24 19:37:40 +0800 <NKrankie> Scotland are set to give free sanitary products to everyone who wants them. Have you ever experienced period poverty and shame in relation to it? They average the cost of products as costing people ¬£11 per month, and this is outrageous apparently.

Every excuse possible has been given to us as to why they are dying in greater numbers and are allegedly more susceptible to contracting covid.

1330444433167441922 2020-11-22 17:34:05 +0800 <NKrankie> Remember, their religion matters more to them than your life does. This is a flagrant example of their attitude. Rabbi holds a secret wedding for 7,000 people in NYC. They couldn't have postponed it? Invites sent by word of mouth only.    https://t.co/anf47HjXk1

1330285078707138561 2020-11-22 07:00:52 +0800 <NKrankie> Silly argument. Infertile women, or older women who can no longer get pregnant means that being a woman isn't about being able to give birth therefore men can be women.  It is a lazy and dishonest argument to make. And 'people' who menstruate are women pretending to be men.

I'll decide how I behave, and as an adult I'm a bit sick of the 'nice brigade' telling me how to behave. You conduct yourself as you see fit, and allow others the same courtesy.

Couldn't have been that hard if they had the capabilities to send him to some kind of football camp. And he just 'feels' everything. Doesn't think, just feels.
1328623155435499520 2020-11-17 16:56:59 +0800 <NKrankie> Marcus claims to have been 17 before he ever read a book, now he has a book club for kids.

1328126195209297920 2020-11-16 08:02:14 +0800 <NKrankie> Biden has put a trans person on his transition team. He's wasting no time in ticking all the boxes.
1328125990527246337 2020-11-16 08:01:26 +0800 <NKrankie> You can't ban hate. You can make it a crime to act out in hatred with violence for example. But you can't stop people hating or disliking things. People hate for different reasons. Trauma victims can hate what hurt them for example.
1328125339701305346 2020-11-16 07:58:51 +0800 <NKrankie> Just like BLM Muslims are wanting a seat at Biden table in return for their vote.    https://t.co/K6vs9hMpO4

1328012516786647042 2020-11-16 00:30:31 +0800 <NKrankie> Can Biden do anything right? Almost $4 million on staff salaries, and ZERO spent on cancer research. And this company was set up in memory of his son Beau.   https://t.co/ZaWYH8lZCN

1327941153073795073 2020-11-15 19:46:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn She looks pretty enough, but you can always tell that they're not biological. It's the voice, or the way they move, even for a second, there's always something that gives it away. But she does look 'passable'.
1327940717373698048 2020-11-15 19:45:13 +0800 <NKrankie> RIP, but besides wearing masks, what are heavily overweight people doing to prevent catching covid?

1327732128403034119 2020-11-15 05:56:22 +0800 <NKrankie> They always go after lone individuals and stragglers. If you attend rallies make sure you leave with a crowd.

1327294442185879558 2020-11-14 00:57:09 +0800 <NKrankie> By all accounts everyone says what a lovely young man he was. What a sad end to a life. I've never heard of anyone sleeping it off in a bin before.    https://t.co/X1OjaiOTAU
1327294243795308551 2020-11-14 00:56:22 +0800 <NKrankie> @Harold68911 @BritishGas That's British Gas operating under Scottish name.
1327292752682430468 2020-11-14 00:50:26 +0800 <NKrankie> Sadiq khan @SadiqKhan @metpoliceuk . Demands that officers justify themselves whenever they search any BAME people. That's racism right there, favouring one group of people over another.    https://t.co/YIs2IAgpJU  https://t.co/M4NB2bNeW9

1327232635899408384 2020-11-13 20:51:33 +0800 <NKrankie> Calling for female or BAME candidates presupposes that all females and all BAME are of the one mindset.

The orgs are driving it, and of course no one is saying 'every BAME feel this way'. You should have moved beyond that level of listening a long time ago

1326535095012913162 2020-11-11 22:39:47 +0800 <NKrankie> The police are clowns. Millions was wasted spending money on infiltrating protest groups such as the 'clown army'. I say we call the UK police 'the clown army' from now on.   https://t.co/yV8LVWbhMi

1326522197905649664 2020-11-11 21:48:32 +0800 <NKrankie> BLACK SILENCE IS VIOLENCE. If you're black or BAME and you're not scoffing at or speaking out against the false notion that 'white privilege' is holding you back, you're complicit in this very destructive and fake ideological narrative. It possibly suits your own agenda
1326520874195955712 2020-11-11 21:43:16 +0800 <NKrankie> Do not give @barnardos one penny. They're now talking about white privilege while neglecting to note that it is this false narrative that has lead to white boys being neglected and dropping out of the system.

1326176007783583749 2020-11-10 22:52:54 +0800 <NKrankie> Apparently Trump's support from white men decreased. Due in part to government obsession with pandering to BAME. If elected, he needs to put white males at the front of his policies. They are the ones being left behind.

What they should have done, if he was breaking the law, was to put their arms through his and escort him off. They never treated BLM rioters like this, they stood and took the beatings and abuse.

1325397237233577984 2020-11-08 19:18:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @Barbi_bb Sorry to hear that. My point was simply that mothers and fathers assist with the healthy upbringing of children. Not to say there aren't a lot of deadbeat dads leaving their kids.
1325396173201477632 2020-11-08 19:14:07 +0800 <NKrankie> Fathers are important in a child's life in order to assist with risk taking and problem solving, as studies show. Father absence isn't good for children. Too many mothers use children as pawns in a divorce, and the family courts lie heavily in favour of the woman.
1325390132573319168 2020-11-08 18:50:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @Mickey58630673 I've never been.
1325390039304564737 2020-11-08 18:49:44 +0800 <NKrankie> This left wing political blogger/commentator wants Trump supporters to be removed from polite society.

The men and women who bled and died in order to assure safe futures for their children and grandchildren, and a land to call their own. She's all for globalism and open borders.
1325387729383923712 2020-11-08 18:40:33 +0800 <NKrankie> @Mickey58630673 Are they encouraging discussion? They are censoring the president, they're heavily politically biased, and people are suspended for saying 'women cannot have penises'. It's hardly impartial or fair.
1325387515373760512 2020-11-08 18:39:42 +0800 <NKrankie> @CarcaryTricia More than likely. Time to think about Parler maybe.
1325387403465515008 2020-11-08 18:39:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish Yes, I only noticed because it was overnight, literally.
1325386062231986177 2020-11-08 18:33:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish Is that normal? I always try to like or reply to each one, and it was sometimes taking up huge chunks of my time. I just wonder if the lack of likes means that the tweets aren't getting seen.
1325385871097536512 2020-11-08 18:33:10 +0800 <NKrankie> Isn't it funny that Trump is no longer a 'racist' because the rappers are now supporting him because they don't want Biden's huge tax plan.  They don't want to lose more than half their wealth, so they're back to loving Trump again, just like they did before he was President.
1325385478720413696 2020-11-08 18:31:37 +0800 <NKrankie> Parler is the third most downloaded app on the play store. It's ahead of FB and twitter by miles. I think twitter will be a left wing echo chamber, and Parler with be a right wing one. There won't be a public forum where diverse ideas and opinions are exchanged.

1324372426818490370 2020-11-05 23:26:06 +0800 <NKrankie> This monster went on a rampage, drove his car into a child, stabbed a mother with her kids, and sliced the neck of a young boy. He's being jailed for attempted murder. He can go and 'enrich' the prison population. Glad he's off the streets.    https://t.co/Q3NIx1Q0n9  https://t.co/iCe4ifkNux
1324344907822178304 2020-11-05 21:36:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish It's so far gone, there's no coming back. The people are lazy voters, and politically illiterate. Except for the certain demographics you'd expect to come out in huge numbers.
1324344107490312192 2020-11-05 21:33:35 +0800 <NKrankie> This is Scotland Parliamentarian speak. 'Dingied' is ned scheme speak for 'ignored'. Straight out of Chewin' the Fat. So embarrassing.  https://t.co/qSaA1pwyrK
1324343204351758336 2020-11-05 21:29:59 +0800 <NKrankie> Another SNP nedette. She says the chancellor 'dingied' Scotland. This is ned scheme speak which means ignored.  Chewin' the Fat indeed.    https://t.co/knAw1lIL0a
1324343061976109059 2020-11-05 21:29:25 +0800 <NKrankie> I'm sick of seeing wee nippy's face. It dominates the news stories up here every single day.    https://t.co/bImgS00Jyo
1324342095402930177 2020-11-05 21:25:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @EverywhereInOne They're not called bollocks, they're called round objects sometimes found dangling from PEOPLE, not men.
1324340753146011650 2020-11-05 21:20:15 +0800 <NKrankie> Scotland the BRAND. Nat-zis have taken to social media to attack Mackies ice cream because it has a union jack on it rather than OOR SALTIRE YE KEN? It's like living among illiterate barbarians up here. If you visit, make your stay a short one.    https://t.co/vkrpZFikSX
1324340220209319937 2020-11-05 21:18:08 +0800 <NKrankie> How long are we being locked down for? I thought it was a month, now the furlough goes on until March? Where is all this money coming from? You can expect sky high taxes if things ever get back to normal. And the cost of food will be through the roof   https://t.co/zSn50DuMTW
1324321570987352071 2020-11-05 20:04:01 +0800 <NKrankie> @KilclooneyJohn You mean 'its', not 'it's'.
1324318118097887234 2020-11-05 19:50:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @KingBobIIV @IamTobiOredein He's a cartoon.
1324294517898575872 2020-11-05 18:16:31 +0800 <NKrankie> There is no 'gender gap' in heart disease. I've read on this, and it turns out men develop it anywhere up to 15 years before women do. Let's not make this into a #MeToo moment when it's simple biology at play. BLM will add it to their list of gripes   https://t.co/YrXTMqnaUp
1324229650307026944 2020-11-05 13:58:46 +0800 <NKrankie> Same as uk. Antifa do what they want but if patriotic people come out to peacefully protest then they're met with armed cops and heavy force
1324229035044589572 2020-11-05 13:56:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @MrAndyNgo Music to my ears.
1324228275179155457 2020-11-05 13:53:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @Truthjon991Cook I give up
1324228213590102016 2020-11-05 13:53:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @Iain_L Any better than what? Can you even explain in detail what you mean or are you just flapping your lips to create a breeze?
1324225286339239936 2020-11-05 13:41:25 +0800 <NKrankie> . @afneil is supposed to be informed. I understand that he puts his interviewees on the spot, but telling Farage there is no evidence of voter fraud in USA is fake news. Project veritable has uncovered it from the bottom to the top. Wont be watching andrews new media outlet
1324223121357000704 2020-11-05 13:32:49 +0800 <NKrankie> After months of allowing these clowns to riot, finally the national guard gets called in. How easily they are soon brought under control. I hate this planet right now

1324217833996341250 2020-11-05 13:11:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @Davemccann19 You got my point, yes?
1324217489560117248 2020-11-05 13:10:26 +0800 <NKrankie> Leeds - imams say mosques are essential services and should be kept open. They'll be wanting us to clap for them next.    https://t.co/J6nFrJnf5P
1324216318380429312 2020-11-05 13:05:47 +0800 <NKrankie> First time I've seen one of them admit to anything. Claims he didn't know it was the Cenotaph. If you don't know what you're protesting, stay at home.    https://t.co/gdE6Km9i1S

1324115940750069766 2020-11-05 06:26:55 +0800 <NKrankie> Truly shocking.
1324103887767408640 2020-11-05 05:39:02 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish I wonder why because they've imported all these lovely African and Middle Eastern men to take care of us all in our old age
1324102160246779912 2020-11-05 05:32:10 +0800 <NKrankie> 6 more care home residents dead in Falkirk. It does seem like there has been a cull on the elderly.    https://t.co/UkHFLnoiB2
1324098532626829314 2020-11-05 05:17:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @MaleHumanPerso1 @Djrtrading Oh I've seen her.  https://t.co/LCqmsJ6yiK
1324093231085375491 2020-11-05 04:56:41 +0800 <NKrankie> Why are the majority of nurses overweight?
1324086709102018562 2020-11-05 04:30:46 +0800 <NKrankie> This is way more BS than I can handle. I doubt even the left believe this.
1324084656162168832 2020-11-05 04:22:36 +0800 <NKrankie> Does anyone believe for one second that Joe Biden broke Obama's record for most people coming out to vote for him in the popular vote? He spent his campaign trail talking to wheelie bins, carboard boxes, and empty chairs. OUT OF CONTROL.    https://t.co/R1tMTgRTeg  https://t.co/GNpNIzF7Id
1324082378428526594 2020-11-05 04:13:33 +0800 <NKrankie> @Pigman @realDonaldTrump Yes, and some of his tweets have caution markers on them.
1324082214481645569 2020-11-05 04:12:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @ClimateWarrior7 Rip whatever one of your transphobic eyes out that didn't spot that stunning and brave woman on the left.
1324081880203960324 2020-11-05 04:11:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @BomberConnor Not at all, thanks for your advice and input.
1324081337419124738 2020-11-05 04:09:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @BomberConnor Yeah, it's not my tweet. I'm trying to like Trump's tweet but twitter isn't letting people like it.
1324080199932194818 2020-11-05 04:04:54 +0800 <NKrankie> I can't like President Trump's tweet. Twitter is out of control.  https://t.co/qc3JVcYiTA
1324079250807422976 2020-11-05 04:01:08 +0800 <NKrankie> Muslims want, muslims get. Every time. Borat ads removed from buses in France because he's wearing a ring that says allah. Some companies refused to remove it, but the buses that go through the no go zones removed theirs.    https://t.co/DAgX2pNGBM
1324078165279547392 2020-11-05 03:56:49 +0800 <NKrankie> I give up. I no longer care. The left get away with every and all crimes, and nothing ever happens to them. I do not care now. I will sleep deep tonight.    https://t.co/qgrySiWkQf  https://t.co/DP1RBoaJ4O
1324038868174360582 2020-11-05 01:20:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @foxesgalore Haha, that would be me atop all of that lovely rhubarb. üòçüòçüòç

1324034542710247425 2020-11-05 01:03:29 +0800 <NKrankie> 4 proud boys stabbed and slashed during clashes on election night, which is turning into election month.   https://t.co/JOYzYxQCJF

1324011715357478915 2020-11-04 23:32:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @JDee1235 Lol, yes ever so slightly ü§©ü§©ü§©

1324010602549882881 2020-11-04 23:28:21 +0800 <NKrankie> In other news, I'm using rhubarb to soothe my shattered nerves. Rhubarb candles, rhubarb bubble bath, rhubarb body creme, and a surprisingly nice rhubarb cider i noticed in the shop. Pret a manger also do a nice rhubarb fizzy drink. Come on Mr. Trump.  https://t.co/Qpqze5AzzO
1324009086560751618 2020-11-04 23:22:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @jessphillips @ali_harper Shut up fool
1323983365335375880 2020-11-04 21:40:07 +0800 <NKrankie> They have someone in the back room filling out voting forms like crazy. No ID or postmark required. And they can keep doing this for 3 more days. Outrageous.
1323977335662616576 2020-11-04 21:16:09 +0800 <NKrankie> @piersmorgan Shut up you moronic fool.
1323976922150412293 2020-11-04 21:14:31 +0800 <NKrankie> @hedgehog_farm I wouldn't mess with her. She terrifies me, but I support her.
1323976072162148353 2020-11-04 21:11:08 +0800 <NKrankie> Fantastic. Brooklyn and Coney Island have voted Trump.
1323975881732345857 2020-11-04 21:10:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @RealTina40 Can you please go and sort this election mess out? I feel sure they'll listen to you. We're all very sad over here in the UK that we're witnessing such blatant election fraud. If they don't like the way we're voting, they'll make sure they get what they want.
1323966588098433024 2020-11-04 20:33:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @Reuters Great, she has a chin tattoo, what more qualification than that do you need?

1323938857507823616 2020-11-04 18:43:15 +0800 <NKrankie> Which is it? Can't have it both ways. Mosque leaders and Muslim MP in Bradford on the one hand say covid is targeting BAME, but now their mosques are closed they're saying infection rate is minimal. If we open mosques, people die, they whine about racism   https://t.co/q27pAgeR8G
1323934832829829121 2020-11-04 18:27:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @aaronjcarpenter Have they started counting again? I'm in UK and can't get a lot of the coverage
1323930578136133632 2020-11-04 18:10:21 +0800 <NKrankie> I'm exhausted from having been up most of the night following the election. Hopefully they finish counting when they reopen in 5 hours time. I hate the left.
1323928763273519104 2020-11-04 18:03:09 +0800 <NKrankie> @FenrirWolf26 Slap some lipstick on the one on the right, sit in in a chair in Congress, no one could tell the difference.
1323926508558295040 2020-11-04 17:54:11 +0800 <NKrankie> At 25 this young man becomes the youngest ever member of Congress. It was donkey face AOC who held that honour previously aged 29.
1323925733543202816 2020-11-04 17:51:06 +0800 <NKrankie> States in America were getting robotic phone calls and texts telling them to stay home and not vote until today to avoid long lines (when polling stations are closed). Election interference.   https://t.co/lisbYXPO05
1323922361800892416 2020-11-04 17:37:42 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 It's the only cure for that woman. I liked that they were locked into the bath and couldn't free themselves.
1323921703009964032 2020-11-04 17:35:05 +0800 <NKrankie> The numbers show that Trump has won. 1% of votes left to be counted in states where he's ahead by 6 figures and it's mathematically impossible for him to lose. Also, Biden needs to CONCEDE this right now because the numbers don't lie.   https://t.co/68DSZ3T4Ky
1323921372054278144 2020-11-04 17:33:47 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 She needs put in a time machine and transported back to Victorian days where hot baths, restraints, isolation in a dark room, and perhaps some 'electrical stimulation' worked wonders with ladies like her.
1323918442534182912 2020-11-04 17:22:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @NicolaSturgeon Voter fraud/interference isn't democracy. Just so you know.
1323915194070945792 2020-11-04 17:09:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @sarahwollaston Name me a time when they stopped counting votes before.
1323877412636155905 2020-11-04 14:39:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @aaronjcarpenter Are you scared or is there something you're going to tell us?

1323876215833448450 2020-11-04 14:34:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @RitaPanahi @AvonandsomerRob I think Kyle's performance in Kenosha has helped trump there

1323874432708956160 2020-11-04 14:27:15 +0800 <NKrankie> Look at this man's header picture. It's clear he has an unhealthy fetish for black people. Either that or he's one more white Liberal with a white saviour complex who views all non whites as being inferior and in need of his help. Disturbing

1323870576239411200 2020-11-04 14:11:56 +0800 <NKrankie> We all need to go elsewhere. Trump needs to start a social media platform. I would move there in a heartbeat. Twitter despises us, and using it feels like lowering myself into the gutter every single time, tweet by dirty tweet.
1323870087833673728 2020-11-04 14:09:59 +0800 <NKrankie> Is it too early to start drinking at 6am? My nerves are shattered. Just tell me Trump won already.

1323867276001660930 2020-11-04 13:58:49 +0800 <NKrankie> I'm tired of violence and bullying from this mob. Police need to restore order to our streets and our lives. They bully us online and in real life. It's a psychological tactic. I wish they would shut up and be quiet.

1323644193613488139 2020-11-03 23:12:22 +0800 <NKrankie> If Biden wins, he will step aside almost immediately to allow Kamala to be President. She will be the first female BAME president but she won't have gotten there, as usual, through merit. They can never do it through merit or talent.

1323579905100185600 2020-11-03 18:56:54 +0800 <NKrankie> Critical race theory simply says that 'human history can be boiled down to nothing more than white people are bad'.  Get it out of our schools and government.    https://t.co/O8zida4Tj0

1323572824238395393 2020-11-03 18:28:46 +0800 <NKrankie> The media and pollsters are telling us Biden is crushing Trump in support, voters, enthusiasm and numbers. Let's see what will be tomorrow when the results are in. I've not been this nervous in a very long time.

Its simply a left wing psychological tactic to erode our beliefs and implant doubt and uncertainty in our minds. Or make us angry which would lead to irrational words and behaviour to later use against us. He wants under our skin.

1323536230349492224 2020-11-03 16:03:22 +0800 <NKrankie> @Dredneck That was exactly the point
1323536087596306434 2020-11-03 16:02:48 +0800 <NKrankie> Feminists would have you believe that women are perpetual victims. If we're in jail then it's because of men. We can't even get to be criminals in our own right without it being the fault of men. I deplore modern feminism.
1323535545671233536 2020-11-03 16:00:38 +0800 <NKrankie> @Sian_J67 @ripx4nutmeg Do you have proof that because of men women are ending up in jail? I object to this language because it makes victims of us once more. As though we can't even be criminals without a man playing a role in it.
1323535161603010563 2020-11-03 15:59:07 +0800 <NKrankie> @MartinaSassy You can't debate this type. They short circuit at the first hint of logic. They remind me of a dalek. Exterminate, exterminate, exterminate. But they say racist, racist, racist.

1323404731818147840 2020-11-03 07:20:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @halifax173 I think they meant that the war was no longer on the battlefield and there was no clear target in sight, and they're having to contend with 'lone wolves' in suicide vests or carrying knives who are scattered all over the place.

1323251946627751936 2020-11-02 21:13:43 +0800 <NKrankie> The right: we must be free to criticize and mock muhammad via cartoons, speech, etc.   Also the right: You can't say a bad word against Tommy Robinson.   Free speech ends when Tommy gets mentioned. It suddenly becomes 'spiteful' or hate speech.

1323249242320838657 2020-11-02 21:02:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @CoastalSe Thank you very much. I think the man had his time and his day, he opened all our eyes to rape gangs, and so we're all thankful for that, and we all applaud him. But these days, he seems like not much more than an agitator.
1323244536739602435 2020-11-02 20:44:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @carney2 @razzywoman Because he would have caused a riot. He went there specifically because that Christian lady got punched last week.

1323243652181872640 2020-11-02 20:40:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @Marisol04326417 He went there knowing full well what he was walking into, and what he was inviting to happen. He's a grifter. He'll now call out police brutality and need more donations to do so.

1322625377106333698 2020-11-01 03:43:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @rumblinboy Glad to hear it. Now go tell it to all the people who have died from cancer and heart disease because of cancelled appts and treatments pushed back and told to stay at home. Or do you deny thats going on?

1322621813243990016 2020-11-01 03:29:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @getbentweirdos @maz_marianne @tomhfh She has blocked me and run away. Truth is too close to home for her. The deaths because of lockdown and cancelled appts and delayed chemo treatments far outweigh the deaths from covid. As an NHS worker I want her to address this issue.
1322621247981838341 2020-11-01 03:27:33 +0800 <NKrankie> @JoustingJim @maz_marianne @tomhfh That account just blocked me. Is shes nhs as she says then surely she would know better than me that deaths because of lockdown greatly outweigh covid deaths. But everyone is clapping for these fools

Have nhs postponed life saving surgeries from tumours to brain surgeries, as well as chemo? Have screenings been pushed back? Be careful how you answer. I have the data to prove you wrong.

1322169294642360321 2020-10-30 21:31:39 +0800 <NKrankie> She set up a charity called Freedom To Stay, and she fought to bring migrants by the boatload into the UK. She received a ¬£10k lottery grant. She was using the illegas to work cannabis farms.   https://t.co/kGghcIsMJz

1322113955943325696 2020-10-30 17:51:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @SeanAKehoe Educate yourself. I'm blocking you for being an absolute moron.  https://t.co/i6wirnyigG
1322113706352889856 2020-10-30 17:50:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @SeanAKehoe You do know that it's all made up, yes? And there's no proof for it? Genesis is bastardized from Babylonian texts. But you run with the Jacob angle. Or tell me how Moses parted the red sea. LOL
1322112714311790592 2020-10-30 17:46:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @SeanAKehoe How many races are there on planet Earth?  Jacob still isn't a race.
1322112546338410496 2020-10-30 17:46:09 +0800 <NKrankie> The more beheadings and honour killings and executions of gays of gays we see, the louder the left shout ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE in spite of islam showing us very clearly that its not a religion of peace. What will it take for these people 2 finally engage with the evidence?
1322111586262200320 2020-10-30 17:42:20 +0800 <NKrankie> Damage control. Hero muslim carries off stab victim+confronts 'terrorist' (who is also muslim). Remember van jihad? 1 muslim got killed with 70 people+ the focus was on the muslim victim. Not the rest of us. 'This isn't islam' headline begs us to believe   https://t.co/BMywzlt7Er  https://t.co/lpH4sT0TKV
1322110280722223105 2020-10-30 17:37:09 +0800 <NKrankie> @SeanAKehoe Further, because you're annoying me with your nonsense. Jacob would have fathered a TRIBE not a race.
1322110123645505536 2020-10-30 17:36:31 +0800 <NKrankie> It's like bouncing a ball off a wall, it keeps coming back to you. This Albanian drug dealer has been deported multiple times. He keeps coming back. 3 years in jail now. Then back on the streets to walk among us.    https://t.co/W6ClHyuhvp
1322109795239890949 2020-10-30 17:35:13 +0800 <NKrankie> @SeanAKehoe Further, Jacob is not a race. One man fathers kids, they go on to breed. It's like saying the descendants of Henry 8th are a race. Ashkenazis have different genetic code form other Jews. You are the confused one.
1322109181021835264 2020-10-30 17:32:47 +0800 <NKrankie> @SeanAKehoe I'm a white Christian convert to Judaism. Am I now of the Jewish race? Your Jewish logic assumes an untouched bloodline that has never married or bred outside of itself. Jews, like Muslims, are NOT A RACE.
1322108723788173312 2020-10-30 17:30:58 +0800 <NKrankie> Nippy just removed this boy from shielding list. Gov supposed 2 consult parents/GP 1st. Says boy isn't likely to have long term damage from covid. He high risk because of current condition. First she came for the elderly, now she's coming for sick kids   https://t.co/2cXHaxAr0r
1322104972755042304 2020-10-30 17:16:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @juliesmith472 It's the fact that certain groups are using race as a weapon to get their own way. Every group of people is a race now
1322104601978523649 2020-10-30 17:14:35 +0800 <NKrankie> Are we too humane? It's sickening to see this terrorist receive medical treatment. He just beheaded someone     https://t.co/zHxoDag0aG
1322103874996572160 2020-10-30 17:11:41 +0800 <NKrankie> Where or to whom have these men been bailed to? They hijacked a boat and threatened to kill the crew. They should be deported to Nigeria, not bailed. Does 'detained under border force power' really mean living in 4 star hotel?    https://t.co/Dgre6yCof3

1321955469859147777 2020-10-30 07:21:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @Effiedeans Pakistan. Turkey. Anywhere in tge ME
1321955072859918336 2020-10-30 07:20:24 +0800 <NKrankie> @NazShahBfd Your prophet even controls and bullies your language. Imaging insisting that you have to say 'peace be upon him' every time you say his name.
1321954582638022657 2020-10-30 07:18:27 +0800 <NKrankie> When did Jews become a race? Did I miss the news bulletin?
1321954026020311040 2020-10-30 07:16:15 +0800 <NKrankie> @macdaddydanger Even his comebacks are dripping in soy. What gets me is that this type of man revels in being an ass with no shame whatsoever in relation to his cucked status.
1321952583225954305 2020-10-30 07:10:31 +0800 <NKrankie> Leeds has an alley that is so notorious for sexual assaults that 8,000 locals are calling for it to be shut down. How did we get to this place in time? It's a dangerous lawless world.    https://t.co/1xZviKiUzx
1321951308618862592 2020-10-30 07:05:27 +0800 <NKrankie> 4 months for a repeat sex offender who was found in bed with 2 naked children who were high on drugs.    https://t.co/PQTVhoaT33
1321950519842267136 2020-10-30 07:02:19 +0800 <NKrankie> You can buy wrapping paper but you can't buy gifts to wrap up. Common sense and logic are things of the past.  https://t.co/KHQwapK5pe
1321949829300473856 2020-10-30 06:59:34 +0800 <NKrankie> @myhollycat Thanks. Its definitely a contributing factor i think.
1321949636576317440 2020-10-30 06:58:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @Albion_Rover Thanks. I'm still not clear if Laurence subscribes to the mentally ill lone wolf narrative, or if he recognises Islam's role in radicalizing these killers.
1321949049919049729 2020-10-30 06:56:28 +0800 <NKrankie> I hope they find whoever is responsible for this. Definite pattern of churches, services, and worshippers being attacked these days. Hackers put porn into an online zoom service.    https://t.co/tH7yWSn4PZ
1321946894365609991 2020-10-30 06:47:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @LozzaFox What is it indicative of then?
1321943815842922501 2020-10-30 06:35:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @PaulRob11781693 Lol that's so funny ü§£ üòÜ üòÇ
1321895234750566401 2020-10-30 03:22:38 +0800 <NKrankie> Because Labour are filled with anti-Semites, 'Islamophobia' is now trending on twitter. Lefties are deflecting from their own problems by saying Conservatives must be investigated for Islamophobia. Openly criticising barbarism isn't racist.
1321889384854159360 2020-10-30 02:59:23 +0800 <NKrankie> More stowaways coming in by boat. They had 'help' getting into the loading bay, apparently. She's pregnant, in hospital, already and an immediate burden on society. She hasn't come to work and pay her way. Free healthcare, free house, child benefits too.  https://t.co/X9QSbyPnx2
1321886709357989888 2020-10-30 02:48:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @Brett___Kelly Not so much roving these days as walking at a slow pace. Thanks for your kind message
1321886413319741440 2020-10-30 02:47:35 +0800 <NKrankie> Merkel welcomed them, now she's throwing them out. Flights full of migrants being sent back to Africa, Asia, Middle East. Many are now on the run, heading to Calais to come to UK. The party is over and the mood is that they hate Germany   https://t.co/ChDl8OCpmH
1321883575290155009 2020-10-30 02:36:18 +0800 <NKrankie> This headline. It took black looters less than one minute to clean out a black owned boutique. They're really fine-tuning their shoplifting skills.    https://t.co/PeunG6Lq4c
1321883034606542848 2020-10-30 02:34:09 +0800 <NKrankie> I would like this letter to be compared to Gary's handwriting. The man is so tedious, I wouldn't put it past him to have written it himself.    https://t.co/0twZy7fE4W
1321871460848336897 2020-10-30 01:48:10 +0800 <NKrankie> Of course the demand for all the free food from restaurants is high. What child wouldn't want something professionally prepared over whatever their mum slaps between two slices of bread. It's not an indication of poverty, just a desire for free food.   https://t.co/ET3IGkVdRe
1321870269254979590 2020-10-30 01:43:26 +0800 <NKrankie> Black brothers who were stop searched by met police after fist bumping each other are now suing the police. If they win, this will set a precedent. They're saying they got stopped because they're black. Looting and suing for free stuff will be the norm   https://t.co/2ZS7FXBG1p
1321869136365002752 2020-10-30 01:38:55 +0800 <NKrankie> Labour want the Bristol Bus Boycott to be taught in every school. A bus company wouldn't hire BAME in the 60s and people refused to ride with them until they changed their policies. Exact same with people not hiring Catholics or Irish.     https://t.co/ISHtoZcuux
1321868488475086848 2020-10-30 01:36:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @Soulboy731 That's terrifying. Drugs are a blight on society.
1321867799220883458 2020-10-30 01:33:37 +0800 <NKrankie> Soldiers will now be posted outside French churches to protect Christians. I think it's going to kick off again. If they can't behead people in churches, look out for more car and truck jihads. The price we're paying to be inclusive.    https://t.co/TzRpcRE4sm
1321867085564289024 2020-10-30 01:30:46 +0800 <NKrankie> Police remove posters of muhammad in Brussels, and they are searching for the culprits. They say that freedom of expression isn't the problem, it's illegal to post things on public buildings, and that's what the charge will be.   https://t.co/6hjTAsfgM4
1321866415327105024 2020-10-30 01:28:07 +0800 <NKrankie> They control the drug trade in Glasgow too. Bradford East is apparently so bad for drugs and drug dealers that parents and teachers are speaking out about kids being groomed to be dealers. Teachers rush to get home before it's dark outside.    https://t.co/2d0T0dFDLX

1321786888211017729 2020-10-29 20:12:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @evans1951 They're pushing it to see what they can get away with.

1321776363284684807 2020-10-29 19:30:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @fatpedlar They also say that our criticism of islam simply creates more extremists. That's an admission of guilt right there.
1321767677770215424 2020-10-29 18:55:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @GentingArenaHos @MuslimCouncil Thanks for that. They don't seem to like the truth being told. Also, I think I read that one of their founders was tried for war crimes. A terrorist on the run kind of thing.
1321767333728321536 2020-10-29 18:54:24 +0800 <NKrankie> You just know that he was desperate 2 use Muslims instead of Jews but he couldn't be seen to give his real intentions away. Also are there listening devices being put in our homes? Who could prove that a conversation between friends is punishable? Are they grassing on each other?
1321766860719874048 2020-10-29 18:52:31 +0800 <NKrankie> The problem here is that the focus is always on white people as being the only ones who are critical of other races. I'd like to see them address the BAME community just once.
1321766644339888129 2020-10-29 18:51:39 +0800 <NKrankie> @LozzaFox Are you in support of his policing of our speech?
1321761584490909698 2020-10-29 18:31:33 +0800 <NKrankie> So annoying. I've no idea who would want to talk to this man.

1321759819834052610 2020-10-29 18:24:32 +0800 <NKrankie> Power mad she is. Plans to stop people from travelling between councils. It's unenforceable. There would need to be checkpoints on every road at every entrance to every village and town in Scotland.    https://t.co/ypk5e63RiP
1321759295688552448 2020-10-29 18:22:27 +0800 <NKrankie> Now we can sit back and wait for all of the muslim voices to come out and tell us how they now feel scared of a critical backlash. Of how islamophobia will be on the rise.

1321755203482378240 2020-10-29 18:06:12 +0800 <NKrankie> Jesus healed the sick, Muhammad beheaded his critics. This is a signature move amongst his more feral devotees.  The only 'religion' I'm aware of that allows for killing.    https://t.co/o88P4jnYFe
1321666817228787714 2020-10-29 12:14:59 +0800 <NKrankie> Black man tells white man that his black skin is superior  üòÇ üòÜ ü§£ and that he'll turn his wife Jamaican after 14 seconds in bed with her. The usual penis nonsense you'd expect from these men.    https://t.co/RgeszzTuGW

1321665454230917121 2020-10-29 12:09:34 +0800 <NKrankie> Why does he emphasise BAME? Does he not care about the white businesses that will be hit by a congestion charge? More pandering to the non white crowd.
1321664278567493632 2020-10-29 12:04:54 +0800 <NKrankie> A good submerging in baths filled with ice will sort these hysterics right out. Victorian style. Then I recommend seclusion in darkened rooms for a minimum of 7 days and nights

1321655015551963137 2020-10-29 11:28:05 +0800 <NKrankie> They want free stuff. History will not be kind to the black community. They are reinforcing stereotypes. They are using people's deaths as an excuse to steal. We see you, black community.

Are there no impoverished whites in Africa? Do you see how Africa gets to be black and the UK doesn't get to be white?   https://t.co/XvQ4h2EgnW

1321442037443547137 2020-10-28 21:21:47 +0800 <NKrankie> Jennifer Aniston tells black people they can't vote for Kanye West. Do you not see the racism in this statement?    https://t.co/hQXiCYbLEy

Women are bullying men into being weak so that they can have emotional control over them, coz they can't physically control them

It seems to me like you're speaking hate, and contributing to the stigma of being 50% soy.

'Beta' by its definition would be someone weak. That type of man is less likely to be an aggressor. All men have the capacity for abuse, as do all women. You have NO point to make.
1321409140586106886 2020-10-28 19:11:04 +0800 <NKrankie> @AgentP22 Is John Somers a 'homely sexual' as that reverend account would say?
1321408781645799425 2020-10-28 19:09:38 +0800 <NKrankie> @MenAtWork_MC @HaydenHewitt @mandystadt Beta males are a threat to no one, and no one thinks they're the ones guilty of abuse. The only person who doesn't understand the point you're trying to make is you. In other news, men don't report abuse by their wives, so all of the wicked women mostly go unreported.
1321407690468478977 2020-10-28 19:05:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @HaydenHewitt @MenAtWork_MC @mandystadt You have hysterical, emotional women vs normal women who get on with it all. There's levels of descriptors to define everyone, and it generally goes in a hierarchy from good to bad. Some people just make stuff up because they don't have enough issues in their lives.

1321403881675464706 2020-10-28 18:50:10 +0800 <NKrankie> @Oneco55John @HumzaYousaf It's a bit late in the day. He wants to take a look at modern day policing and why cops are allowed to crack the skulls of white men who dare stand up for anything, while muslims and BLM get to riot and destroy things at leisure.
1321400743534956545 2020-10-28 18:37:42 +0800 <NKrankie> 40 years later. Why does he think this is relevant? Is he trying to dig up some dead people and prosecute them for modern day hate crimes? Absolute fool, just like wee nippy.
1321400116482289665 2020-10-28 18:35:12 +0800 <NKrankie> @MissCry09105761 I'm on board with the overall message, but some take it too far and think they're special just because they menstruate, as though it's some huge universal painful pact that all women are subjected to. I don't imagine it's special to be male or female. They should get over it.
1321399357409763329 2020-10-28 18:32:11 +0800 <NKrankie> They've been stealing things for two nights now. The black criminal who was killed must really have meant a lot to them. Nothing says Rest In Peace quite like looting stores does.   https://t.co/uc0tskLePx
1321398519501066242 2020-10-28 18:28:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @MissCry09105761 It was their demands for respect purely for being women that I objected to. And for taking sole credit for birthing children. They can't impregnate themselves yet.
1321397605109293058 2020-10-28 18:25:14 +0800 <NKrankie> Hold the bus, they've just insulted the Jews. Maybe this will necessitate action from someone.
1321397029092818944 2020-10-28 18:22:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @MissCry09105761 As am I, but did you see the post of theirs that I was originally replying to?
1321396590783959042 2020-10-28 18:21:12 +0800 <NKrankie> @thetimesscot When will @HumzaYousaf resign? The entire country is laughing at him.
1321395712156962817 2020-10-28 18:17:42 +0800 <NKrankie> @MissCry09105761 God only knows. I happen to love men, and I've no patience for these modern day feminists. Guarantee you they stand naked in the mirror and teach their vaginas how to speak.
1321394862860701697 2020-10-28 18:14:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @juliesmith472 Very sorry to hear that. And thank you for sharing.
1321345353107546112 2020-10-28 14:57:36 +0800 <NKrankie> I can't even imagine behaving like this, and I can't even imagine recording myself doing this, and I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE POSTING IT ONLINE. Disturbed.

1321343604120526848 2020-10-28 14:50:39 +0800 <NKrankie> Morons. Women could not have built the West. Get over it. There are differences between the sexes. If women were in charge, we'd all be sex slaves. Just stop with the misandry and start appreciating men. It's not hard.
1321343297768640513 2020-10-28 14:49:26 +0800 <NKrankie> @cawsbar Yes, I proved that you think you're something special because you have a womb. You're not. Get over yourselves. And no I don't think all fathers are sperm donors. You asked for an example of the dehumanisation of men. I gave you it. Morons.

1321341145528545282 2020-10-28 14:40:53 +0800 <NKrankie> Sorted. This black man has now officially gained redemption for that black career criminal's death. He is now the proud owner of a new stolen washing machine. Justice has been served.
1321339916656218112 2020-10-28 14:36:00 +0800 <NKrankie> Doreen Lawrence is an idiot. She is due sympathy because of her son's tragic death, but beyond that she's an absolute clown. She's spearheading another enquiry into racism in relation to covid. She had to apologise to firemen because of her false racism claims. @DLawrenceOBE
1321338518673723393 2020-10-28 14:30:26 +0800 <NKrankie> Every single 'mother' was impregnated by a man. Let's not dehumanise men. Let's respect the dignity of fatherhood. I'm female, and I'm sick to death of these griping women who think having a womb is some kind of divinely sanctioned right to respect.
1321335253412306944 2020-10-28 14:17:28 +0800 <NKrankie> @1Fubar George has blocked me. Ask him why he's afraid of an old lady, thanks.
1321334897630498816 2020-10-28 14:16:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @MissStaceyUK Silence, bigot. They are robbing the store in memory of the dead criminal. I pity you if you don't understand the devout logic in this.
1321334694869422080 2020-10-28 14:15:15 +0800 <NKrankie> Black people know how to give a dead criminal a send off. Nothing says 'rest in peace' better than robbing stores does.
1321333286313099264 2020-10-28 14:09:39 +0800 <NKrankie> That black man's death has officially been commemorated because now black people have robbed a store. Nothing says 'rest in peace' like stealing things does.
1321327894879178756 2020-10-28 13:48:13 +0800 <NKrankie> What is 'hate talk'? And who is monitoring our speech? Is 'hate' defined as being something that someone else doesn't like at random? I can dislike anything and anyone that I please, including wee man @HumzaYousaf and wee nippy @NicolaSturgeon
1321327067837964288 2020-10-28 13:44:56 +0800 <NKrankie> Women can be every bit the predator that men can. Women also do less jail time, which is an insult to their victims. I demand equality now. Equality in the workplace, equality in the justice system.    https://t.co/z0Y0GxyDVY
1321325215482322944 2020-10-28 13:37:35 +0800 <NKrankie> Proud woman of colour arrested for doing her part in protesting the shooting of a black man who charged police with a knife. She was robbing a store. Nothing says 'I object' more than robbing a store does. Nothing says 'we will remember you' than stealing does.
1321321978033098752 2020-10-28 13:24:43 +0800 <NKrankie> At this point, he's just spitting into the wind and hoping it sticks somewhere.

1321249192732405762 2020-10-28 08:35:29 +0800 <NKrankie> This black man was a serial abuser of women, yet the black community rioted on his behalf. The black community are the only community who idolise their criminals.

1321234577139093510 2020-10-28 07:37:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @macdaddydanger Isn't this bizarre? It's a generational thing. These people wear their hysteria in public on their sleeves as though this is okay. It's not. Succeeding generations cannot behave like this. Something has to come along to end this.
1321234082844545025 2020-10-28 07:35:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @Duggery4 @jessrocks72 You had a steak bake and a steak pie. Alone at your desk. Let's get you a woman.

Here's their best, Biden, telling us we need to stop George Bush from having another 4 years in office (he means Trump).

1320227366778658818 2020-10-25 12:55:07 +0800 <NKrankie> They are actually asking if covid has killed off the flu. 98% reduction in flu cases across the globe. This is one smart virus. Is there anything it can't do?    https://t.co/l8LQqa85Jg

1320111149422137345 2020-10-25 05:13:19 +0800 <NKrankie> Tories sell us out on migration. Promised us that skilled workers could only come to a job that paid 35K. It's now been lowered to 25K. Unskilled workers on 20K can stay after 6 years. This doesn't lower migration or put people off coming here.   https://t.co/oYtvWR5A4d

Or they're so stupid that they truly believe they won't be eradicated and that whites will be an extreme minority. Perhaps they just don't care.

1319947452414349312 2020-10-24 18:22:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @W3l5hL393nd Thanks, the thought of getting on a stuffed bus and having to wear a mask and then stand in the cold for a while to get in every shop isn't enticing. I doubt the shops will be empty also. I'll go a walk instead. Need to get out the house and off twitter.
1319946957637431297 2020-10-24 18:20:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @NathanQ88 What did you think of the debate?
1319946489716723712 2020-10-24 18:19:01 +0800 <NKrankie> @QuatloosX @ArthurBraby They secretly see white as being superior, and that's why it's racist to be proud to be white.
1319945567569575941 2020-10-24 18:15:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @benjaminbutter @MarkDrakeford Books are essential during lockdown. We need something to do. And reading is good.
1319943617939726336 2020-10-24 18:07:36 +0800 <NKrankie> You want reparations? Fine, but I want to impose a tax on you if you come here and want to partake of life in a land that my ancestors broke their backs to help create. They did that for their progeny, no one else. As did all our ancestors.

1319940634195668992 2020-10-24 17:55:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @W3l5hL393nd It's one thing to want to help people out, it's quite another when you're exacerbating the problem. Sounds noble, but white bread and cheese is the cheapest of the cheap. Parents will take advantage of that. Sounds like a treat but it's not.
1319939502790615040 2020-10-24 17:51:15 +0800 <NKrankie> Pubs offering free lunches to 'any and all kids' are giving junk food with no nutrition. This one is cheese toasties and crisps. That's fatty cheese, white bread, and fried crisps. . Also don't have to prove parents can't afford it. Parents buy more fags   https://t.co/ghgmaMGMxa

1319935044031578113 2020-10-24 17:33:32 +0800 <NKrankie> @CaroleAnnRice The opposite of play is rest. The opposite of depression would be joy, elation, happiness.
1319934306815442947 2020-10-24 17:30:36 +0800 <NKrankie> BBC - Tim Davie new drive says one fifth of all programs must be diverse. I would say more than half of their programs at the minute are diverse. We need shows that are less diverse to satisfy white Brits' need for entertainment.    https://t.co/At2dLnABG7
1319932588853788673 2020-10-24 17:23:47 +0800 <NKrankie> I believe that  pale people with natural corn blonde hair will be tomorrow's circus freaks. They'll be so rare that they'll live their lives in cages or be kept as pets. I'd say this could occur in a very short 50 years. They are minority now.

1319928423989522432 2020-10-24 17:07:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @mrjohnhendry I thought it was only when they were trying to infiltrate crime gangs? As with cctv, I don't mind them watching whatever I do. I assume if I'm not breaking the law then it's all dandy and my movements are of no interest to them.
1319927926243184640 2020-10-24 17:05:15 +0800 <NKrankie> But don't dare criticise their prophet or depict him in cartoons. Anything else is allowed, from robbery to rap, drug dealing and assault.   https://t.co/Xn0XedbPv1

1319918751811313664 2020-10-24 16:28:47 +0800 <NKrankie> @iamtomskinner Start off reading collections of fairy tales. Brothers Grimm or Hans Christian Anderson are good. The stories are often just a page long, but they've got all the elements you'll need to develop your own reading skills. Lot of adults enjoy them, they're not just for kids.
1319917461907668992 2020-10-24 16:23:40 +0800 <NKrankie> I have no problem with white people putting stickers up stating that they love their nation. It's groups like @SUTRScotland who are ignoring the fact that BLM are sowing racial division all across the West. This is simply an expected response.    https://t.co/58iWTH8amK

1319780351330406402 2020-10-24 07:18:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 I used to find myself in the same situation with a certain group of mutual friends. The coffees and the drinks were insufferable. They couldn't lay off the politics. It was all the chat they had. I finally extracted myself and I have nothing further to do with them.
1319779274254127104 2020-10-24 07:14:33 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 Do you need them in your life?

1319774281455292421 2020-10-24 06:54:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @DhirajP46578906 According to the article it's verging on 5 million, and Scotland has 5.5 million people in it. Is there something you're desperately trying to ask but can't quite manage yet?

1319766238747385858 2020-10-24 06:22:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @CoastalSe You're absolutely right. The one instance where an individual could benefit from psychiatric intervention, and they'll toss him in jail because he's white.

Any allegiance to 'wrongthink' will not be tolerated and you can go elsewhere. Not that you want to go to this dump, it's just that the mindset is spreading.
1319405029703516161 2020-10-23 06:27:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @Davieglasgow Without a doubt. Typical Glasgow ned. His website says his gym is inclusive and non-judgemental. Have we reached the stage where we have to start showing out party political cards before entering premises?
1319404204193157120 2020-10-23 06:24:10 +0800 <NKrankie> @Davieglasgow @HelloitsLux You know the area? Absolute dump. And the location of the one on the south side is equally as tragic.

1319402500580102144 2020-10-23 06:17:24 +0800 <NKrankie> If you were stupid enough to buy a membership at this gym and you vote Conservative, do ask for a full refund. They might not do memberships, though. They're stuck in a unit on an industrial estate. They look more like they 'charge by the hour'.
1319402138687209482 2020-10-23 06:15:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @AGFitness_gla Are you rescinding all memberships of people who voted Conservative and giving them a refund?
1319401255324835840 2020-10-23 06:12:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @AGFitness_gla Your gym is in an industrial estate. You're clearly not making any money. You couldn't go bankrupt if you tried.

1319398221479903234 2020-10-23 06:00:23 +0800 <NKrankie> This gym which is stuck in an industrial estate verging on Possilpark actually has a nutritionist. Why don't they teach parents how to make nutritious and cheap meals for their kids? Personal training comes with personal responsibility. Teach them to lay off the fags too.
1319397238335066118 2020-10-23 05:56:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @AGFitness_gla @SimonClarkeMP Not every child is entitled to free school meals. You'd know that if you weren't a ned. The government is not your mummy or daddy. Budget and take care of your kids. Stop drinking/smoking/drugging and paying for stupid gym memberships.
1319396168368009217 2020-10-23 05:52:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @AGFitness_gla Your gym is a dump. You're stuck in an industrial estate. Also, why do you feel tory voters are responsible for what MPs newly passed in Commons? Dont you think a lot of voters disagree with that issue? You are a typical glasgow illiterate ned.
1319395715777466370 2020-10-23 05:50:26 +0800 <NKrankie> If you're unlucky enough to live around the Garscube Road area, do not even consider joining this small minded, bigoted man's gym. Exercising is about feeling good and expanding the mind. A bigot like this could never help you unleash your true potential.

1319241329159929857 2020-10-22 19:36:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn @reddit I only came on twitter because of lockdown. I'll be off it when things get back to normal. Thankfully I'm not an internet child. I didn't grow up with this so it's not normalised for me.
1319237978309468167 2020-10-22 19:23:38 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn Internet has heralded the absolute worst of humanity. If you're on it accept the consequences. If you can't handle it, get off it. No one is being forced to join twitter. It's a shame it's so toxic, though. She's setting herself up as a target. Hopefully she doesn't read comments
1319236819175772167 2020-10-22 19:19:02 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn She isn't being laughed 'with', though. I feel she's being laughed 'at'. It's gluttony, pure and simple. It's self abuse. Doesn't seem to be 'thyroid' related. Deeply disturbed individual who is able to hide it all with an upbeat attitude and smile.
1319234988861214721 2020-10-22 19:11:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn I've seen her before eating an entire pot of curry I think. She's an adult. It's her body. There's a myriad of things that can be driving this type of behaviour. Who am I to judge? There are consequences for everything that we do in life. I hope she can accept her health ones

1319223216423030789 2020-10-22 18:24:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @notmynational The other thing I am noticing, from my own experience which doesn't count for much, is that cleaners and carers are mostly young men trying to make money. Older women like myself still clean, but young women aren't cleaning offices or stairwells. Something to keep an eye on

1319221035770826753 2020-10-22 18:16:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @notmynational As do men. Porters, janitors, the group who have been cleaning my stairwell for the past 5 years are all men. Traditionally, cleaning was a woman's job, but the men are in there in high numbers now. Not so with women and bins.

Labour female MP came out to say it was leaving women behind. But women are free to apply for those jobs too. Equality, after all.

Headline could have read 'slum restaurant owner gets mad when people correctly review his bad food and poor service'. And then threatens to slap them
1319189482109849600 2020-10-22 16:10:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @HackneyedAbbort @TripAdvisor I saw one of the 5 star reviews wrote what looks like a full page love letter. I mean, come on. A few pithy sentences suffices, not meandering pages that go indepth about opulence and succulence.
1319188686995660800 2020-10-22 16:07:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 Could be one of the rides, line up, wait your turn, and experience the thrill, anxiety and anticipation of finding out if you're walking around with a potentially life threatening disease. All the fun of the fair.

Why would they deny so many 'excited' parents the chance to voice their 'excitement' and back up the library's claims that the event will be so 'exciting'?

Homelessness is a gender issue that impacts men. Women get the house, the family, all of it. Marriages can work if two people value the institution, commit to it, and compromise.

1316961573089480704 2020-10-16 12:38:01 +0800 <NKrankie> We treat livestock better than this, and I'm no fan of criminals. Locked up for 24 hours a day, at 8 day stretches if displaying symptoms.

1316958527743811585 2020-10-16 12:25:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn @Mikehomeseller Maybe it has just peaked, and the genre exhausted. Disco and Soul seem to have disappeared also. It has to progress into something better I imagine in order to stay alive. Country music is the only thing that's progressed, IMO.
1316954632124497921 2020-10-16 12:10:26 +0800 <NKrankie> @SueTayl14911306 I think we all are.
1316954554307588096 2020-10-16 12:10:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn @Mikehomeseller I'm not a fan. I only know that one song because my niece used to play it on a loop when it first came out.
1316954424405884928 2020-10-16 12:09:37 +0800 <NKrankie> Vile. The interviewer likened Trump to someone's crazy uncle. Remember, the left don't like to stereotype people, unless they're the ones doing it. Crazy uncle indeed.    https://t.co/MN2VOo46Xz
1316952883422691328 2020-10-16 12:03:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @GMaolruanaidh I wonder if this has anything to do with Trump's town hall Q+A session. Biden is doing one at the same time. Normally twitter would be flooded with the results. For instance, I'm sure more people tuned in to see Trump than Biden. Maybe they don't want us knowing.
1316952091617878017 2020-10-16 12:00:21 +0800 <NKrankie> Twitter is still not right. I've got about 2 notifications where normally I'd have 100.

1316881204830941190 2020-10-16 07:18:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @Raine4567 Can see you now. Clearly they're deleting everything because they are being hauled up in front of Congress over the Biden censorship.
1316880247061610498 2020-10-16 07:14:52 +0800 <NKrankie> Shall we take the countryside to black people? Heaven forbid they go out and make the effort to explore it like the rest of us do.   https://t.co/Rs2Fy448GG

1316849164714758146 2020-10-16 05:11:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @elfpumper It's all too common. I wish they would just leave the kids along to be cared for by someone else. I have a massive spare bedroom. I could foster care kids until they find permanent forever homes.
1316848334829744129 2020-10-16 05:08:03 +0800 <NKrankie> And he is CORRECT
1316847449072435203 2020-10-16 05:04:32 +0800 <NKrankie> Who remembers 'penny for the guy'? Young kids don't do it any more. We'd make our own Guy Fawkes effigy and sit on the corner with a cap or a cup, and people would give us money for fireworks. Well, the boys did it. They seemed better at making them.  https://t.co/y0MeMKU9TE

1316833899813769217 2020-10-16 04:10:41 +0800 <NKrankie> @mrjohnhendry It's this second lockdown that has put a blue mood over all of my life. I was optimistic, but now this nonsense from wee nippy.  It's becoming too much. I'm not suicidal, and thanks for your comment, I'm just incredibly blue. As I'm sure we all are. Hope you're doing okay
1316832404250800140 2020-10-16 04:04:45 +0800 <NKrankie> There are better ways to make a point. Lock him up. I hate this wanton destruction. No better than BLM. That wasted and destroyed food could have gone to food banks. NO SYMPATHY    https://t.co/JM6IGy64fT

1316257655472742400 2020-10-14 14:00:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @LuisaPorritt @LibDems You're white, so you've no chance. Deal with it. You've got slight points for being female, but beyond that, I'd think about a career in bartending. Life Truths.
1316256598520729600 2020-10-14 13:56:42 +0800 <NKrankie> @mrjohnhendry You're a young thing, why you up this early? My old age sucks, and sleep is a thing of the past.
1316254238192918528 2020-10-14 13:47:19 +0800 <NKrankie> The face of feminism. Out on the front lines. Not whinging that she can't be a CEO with no qualifications. RIP young lady.
1316253179588345858 2020-10-14 13:43:07 +0800 <NKrankie> @LitMolly Don't like it? You're a racist.
1316252074833780736 2020-10-14 13:38:44 +0800 <NKrankie> I wonder how he knew there was a cctv blind spot. It's been rectified now, 3 years after the bombing.     https://t.co/O50tXdOhTb

1316241361335709696 2020-10-14 12:56:09 +0800 <NKrankie> Wow. I love patriotism. It's celebratory in nature. Leftism is destructive. Largest Trump flag ever now goes on tour.    https://t.co/NYGaSAeqgS
1316240876990083073 2020-10-14 12:54:14 +0800 <NKrankie> All races were polled, and blacks scored the highest for the question 'how important is race to you'. They were around 60%. Whites were lower than 5%.    https://t.co/M7B3bXVn0p
1316240271982592000 2020-10-14 12:51:50 +0800 <NKrankie> Soul destroying. Young man gets called a 'chav' by company he interviewed for. How articulate do you need to be in order to be a delivery driver. I hope someone sets up a gofundme for him. He's desperate for work.    https://t.co/DlM5UK8tnm
1316238734506033152 2020-10-14 12:45:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @Zubrmeister She's saying circumcision is an alternative to using soap and water. Seriously. She sent me the 'evidence.
1316176002033291264 2020-10-14 08:36:26 +0800 <NKrankie> I'm a nobody, and I'm on a campaign to get all of these 'somebodies' to unblock me. Everyone from  @eddireader  to @esther_k  of @TPointUK  You do not get my support when your minions are blocking us for asking INTELLIGENT questions. @charliekirk11  https://t.co/u7b4pLfA8U
1316174982393851904 2020-10-14 08:32:23 +0800 <NKrankie> She blocked me after saying circumcision as preferable for African men. The 'evidence' she gave showed that men who do not wash their penises, and who have vaginal and anal sex without condoms are more likely to get STDs. Can people tweet her thanks?  https://t.co/9k6hac3M8p
1316171144140132354 2020-10-14 08:17:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @TOMMORBRITISH1 @eddireader She's a 'public figure' in Scotland at least. You'd think she'd have the ovaries to stand her ground and debate.
1316170960408662016 2020-10-14 08:16:24 +0800 <NKrankie> @Matthew96153150 Thanks for that. It's not to trivialize their experience, but when my parents died I don't expect you to feel the same grief I did. So it's absolutely unforgivable for MPs to wear their grief on their sleeves.
1316169593321410560 2020-10-14 08:10:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @Matthew96153150 It's becoming too common. They're bringing their personal experiences and emotions into parliament and wanting us all to feel the same about it. I don't want that.
1316169402790879233 2020-10-14 08:10:13 +0800 <NKrankie> Can anyone please tag @eddireader and ask her why she has blocked me? Is she scared? I'm curious. Does she not want to engage with reality? Why is she a coward?  https://t.co/LpsW9iEeSB
1316168915559555072 2020-10-14 08:08:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @AgentP22 That eddi blocked me. Ask her to unblock me thanks.
1316167424882991110 2020-10-14 08:02:21 +0800 <NKrankie> I love that Trump is playing gay anthems such as YMCA and Macho Man at his rallies.  I wonder what the message is.
1316166852809236480 2020-10-14 08:00:05 +0800 <NKrankie> I have a vagina, and yet somehow I feel more masculine than this man.

1316164728448864257 2020-10-14 07:51:39 +0800 <NKrankie> Stevie Wonder's new songs want us to atone for 5 years, and he rejects the notion that 'all lives matter'.

1316158860873347072 2020-10-14 07:28:20 +0800 <NKrankie> I find this woman to be unutterably dull, and of no consequence. She's now calling all of us social media users 'drug addicts'. Take Harry away from her and she's back on the streets, selling hand jobs.    https://t.co/DMLbKcH10r
1316158159048904704 2020-10-14 07:25:32 +0800 <NKrankie> @BoningMugger Bigot fat-phobe.
1316157372130304006 2020-10-14 07:22:25 +0800 <NKrankie> Heavy sedation, restraints, and a padded cell for this one. After a month of no direct light, I'll re-evaluate her and see if she can enter a phase two of my Victorian remedy for female malady treatments.
1316155483565305856 2020-10-14 07:14:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @seven7ins They're eating too much. I see people saying that 16 stone is their weight and they can't get below it. I could get them below it if I stuck them in a work camp every day and limited their calories. There are no fat hunger strikers.
1316154577713070080 2020-10-14 07:11:18 +0800 <NKrankie> LOL, every single boy I've ever had, and every single one in my family.
1316152248494424065 2020-10-14 07:02:03 +0800 <NKrankie> Because no one wants to look like you. That's why your body is 'not important'. Stop dressing obesity up as a positive movement.  https://t.co/yxu6BOLopU

1316092613196492802 2020-10-14 03:05:05 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 @VP Yes, and getting slated for it. Another adorable quality

1316083130084851717 2020-10-14 02:27:24 +0800 <NKrankie> Can you imagine what the figures were if white people, especially males, were allowed to report hatred against them because of their skin colour. As it stands, white isn't a protected characteristic. These folk are just jumping on the racist bandwagon   https://t.co/Kca8S4JM2W
1316081575575064579 2020-10-14 02:21:13 +0800 <NKrankie> @suemitch2017 They simply expose themselves with their attacks.

1316035507676209153 2020-10-13 23:18:10 +0800 <NKrankie> @OsamaSBhutta Good.
1316035344471646208 2020-10-13 23:17:31 +0800 <NKrankie> She doesn't look good.

1316026618687545344 2020-10-13 22:42:51 +0800 <NKrankie> @hedgehog_farm Thank goodness all the males in my family tended towards combat sports and manly pursuits. Bullying was never an issue for them, but just like your father's values were instilled, none of them have been bullies either.
1315985733207949312 2020-10-13 20:00:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @Stewarty2013 It's perhaps the most opportunistic tale I've ever seen, and what is worse is that not one of the media outlets have covered it have asked for witness interviews. Police have not intervened or been contacted to say it's BS
1315985531914813440 2020-10-13 19:59:35 +0800 <NKrankie> Along the lines of 'I'm only doing this for your own good' said the abusive spouse to his partner. Or 'take it' during sex play that is too rough. She is not the 'mammy' of me. Little dog that she is.    https://t.co/xFLLK4fHqa

1315975840337924096 2020-10-13 19:21:04 +0800 <NKrankie> @AltChristianMan Unearthed and brought to life
1315975679461281794 2020-10-13 19:20:26 +0800 <NKrankie> If Biden is so hugely popular and is leading in the polls, why is no one coming to his speaking events? Trump's rallies are like rock concerts. Can we really believe America is voting for Biden?
1315974763106500608 2020-10-13 19:16:47 +0800 <NKrankie> She has never provided any evidence of being driven from her home due to racists.

1315965382583349248 2020-10-13 18:39:31 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish Are they going to demand pensioners aren't included in WWE events? Where does it end. As we get older, doors close, the body slows down, and we're not as 'hot'. Who cares? It's life.

1315963286169563136 2020-10-13 18:31:11 +0800 <NKrankie> @Aardbloke I read that pushing air into the lungs was stressing and damaging them. So these machines don't do that?

1315651593702903808 2020-10-12 21:52:38 +0800 <NKrankie> I don't find this advert to be 'crass' at all. Another forced apology. We are living in unprecedented times, and if the theatres are closed, why shouldn't dancers consider IT or other jobs? Dancers have very short careers anyhow.    https://t.co/HFCAn0hG44
1315648163240435712 2020-10-12 21:39:00 +0800 <NKrankie> I remember this murder. It's heartbreaking. The son is hoping this gets shared far and wide so that any kind of evidence might come to light that will catch the killer.    https://t.co/SyS6gtlfIE

1315635977533173762 2020-10-12 20:50:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @AdamH86_Abdn @Rose_Of_Dawn Thanks. Still wrapping my head around all the terminology. I think the women can look very convincing when they take testosterone, but I can't say the same for the men.

1315432172904472576 2020-10-12 07:20:44 +0800 <NKrankie> @Madonna Why are you anorexic? Do you dislike yourself so much that you need people to see you as thin?

1315342687730573317 2020-10-12 01:25:09 +0800 <NKrankie> @AnotherBdw Just because you're elderly. Does the cold and the flu present itself in exactly the same manner in every single person and to the same degree? If not then why do you think covid has a uniform performance among everyone?

1315308470128836609 2020-10-11 23:09:11 +0800 <NKrankie> My white privilege consisted of me and my siblings going down the bing and the rail tracks trying to pick up any stray pieces of coal that had fallen off the wagons so that we might get an extra hour of heat.
1315307244448350208 2020-10-11 23:04:18 +0800 <NKrankie> My white privilege consisted of having to go to bed with four of my siblings with coats thrown over the bed because we only had one bedsheet. A coal fire in the living room, and no central heating.

1315300850244427779 2020-10-11 22:38:54 +0800 <NKrankie> I've had corona and I've had the flu. The flu was the worst by a mile. I felt sure I was going to die with flu. With corona, it was simply a case of non stop coughing. It felt like my lungs were made of ice and they would shatter the harder I coughed. NOTHING compared to flu.
1315300491954458624 2020-10-11 22:37:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @Hghoda My lungs felt like they were made of ice, and if I coughed too hard they would smash. The coughing was constant and it was the worst. But I've had the flu and the flu was worse. I thought I was going to die with the flue.
1315296549627363328 2020-10-11 22:21:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @Hghoda It was no worse than an extreme coughing fit.

1314937838098698241 2020-10-10 22:36:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish they're never going to come into prominence. They need to give it up. They're about ten years too late.

All of our parties adopt the notion that we're helpless against the onslaught of invaders. They're all just doing it to varying degrees. I want someone to speak for whites. Not tommy though

I don't listen to darren for deeper insights into life and politics in the same way as I don't listen to boy bands for advice on love. Hope that clarifies things.
1314915544861212672 2020-10-10 21:07:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @MarilynAshy @NikkiStix55 @darrengrimes_ Thanks. He's too young. I don't listen to pop music because I can't relate to 20 something's gripes. I see so many flaws with Darren, and it's my hopes that he disappear, mature, self reflect and then come out as a grown thinker. Nothing more than that
1314914590753464325 2020-10-10 21:04:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @CARogersNo1 @NikkiStix55 @darrengrimes_ He has it. I'm not denying him his. But public speech is open to criticism. I'm criticising him. He is free to criticise me.

1314912455374626819 2020-10-10 20:55:33 +0800 <NKrankie> without grievances they don't get funded. They know that men should not compete against women in any sport, let alone violent contact sports. But they'll make it an issue in order to seem like they're fighting bigotry and therefore remain funded. Sorted it for you.

BLEATS constantly about being working class, ex hairdresser, ex M&amp;S worker, couldn't interview Starkey properly, scandal around donations. Nothing has gone right for him since start.

1314904129085603842 2020-10-10 20:22:28 +0800 <NKrankie> @NikkiStix55 @darrengrimes_ He's insufferable. I would like him to come back out as an adult.
1314902928692580352 2020-10-10 20:17:42 +0800 <NKrankie> Where is the entrance? I can't even tell.
1314902576622710784 2020-10-10 20:16:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @Sheanderthal He's not original. And he keeps banging on about being working class and a hairdresser. Very tedious
1314901089687306240 2020-10-10 20:10:24 +0800 <NKrankie> @darrengrimes_ Can you just disappear and come back out in 20 years? Watching you grow up in journalism and politics is every bit as painful as watching Britney mature in public.
1314898838403125248 2020-10-10 20:01:27 +0800 <NKrankie> Did you know that the psychologist who coined the phrase 'gender identity' was also in support of paedophilia? He says paedophilia is simply a sort of parental attraction to youths that has an erotic element to it. So paedos love our children   https://t.co/1Zsv81nnMU

1314887162853294080 2020-10-10 19:15:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @Planademic2020 @seven7ins I would argue that injecting cocaine is worse. It must be like crystal meth. They would surely get an incredible instant high, and then a very incredible deep crash only minutes later. Making them very erratic. At least heroin would keep them sedated.
1314885227462918147 2020-10-10 19:07:22 +0800 <NKrankie> @seven7ins Are these tents helping the problem or encouraging a problem. It comes down to that.
1314883172782530560 2020-10-10 18:59:12 +0800 <NKrankie> @seven7ins Janis Joplin used to inject cocaine mixed with heroin. It's called a speedball I think
1314882821048217602 2020-10-10 18:57:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @stonewalluk I stand in solidarity with other women who would be concussed or worse by introducing men into women's rugby.
1314880979228676096 2020-10-10 18:50:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @seven7ins I know. I saw that. I'd say injecting cocaine seems like a party, whereas injecting heroin could be argued to stave off withdrawals.

1314864777878003713 2020-10-10 17:46:06 +0800 <NKrankie> It would be great if the media could be equally as rabid in letting us know how many people are infected because of BLM or anti statue protests.    https://t.co/fEWUftEy0p

1314712170148626434 2020-10-10 07:39:42 +0800 <NKrankie> As protest go, this is kind of lame. Dumping ice in front of Holyrood will just melt in minutes. Other protestors have used red dye and paint, or period blood. I feel these workers' pain, but ice melts in minutes.

1314708741305044997 2020-10-10 07:26:04 +0800 <NKrankie> Apologies are empty words. If he is truly sorry, he'll resign. Show us how sorry you are @SNPdavid Show us. Resign.

1314153950711603201 2020-10-08 18:41:32 +0800 <NKrankie> It's not 'systemic racism'. It takes more light to light dark objects.

They can't even form a sentence at the bar they are that drunk. In theory it all sounds good that the bar staff aren't selling drunks, but it's not the reality.
1313967394482782210 2020-10-08 06:20:13 +0800 <NKrankie> @thebigbadger @mrjohnhendry @NicolaSturgeon There are drunk bodies everywhere in city centre. Union Street. Savoy centre. The social. Buchanan Street. George Square. Queen Street. And not too many people carrying cans either because there is always a heavy police presence and drinking on Street is illegal.
1313929021311377409 2020-10-08 03:47:44 +0800 <NKrankie> @Ronnie62597744 How is that even possible? That can't be real. Did he land on a spike?
1313928556221693954 2020-10-08 03:45:54 +0800 <NKrankie> Scrolling through tv series on Netflix. So many of them have a white actor with a black partner (detective). White woman with black boyfriend. Tons of blacks in the workplace. If it's a majority white cast, then their boss is black. Blacks are now officially over-represented
1313928059150577669 2020-10-08 03:43:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @mrjohnhendry @NicolaSturgeon Also, doesn't this just lead to more house parties and more folk drinking in Kelvingrove park and Glasgow Green? She's just shifted the inebriates from one location to another.
1313927815126036481 2020-10-08 03:42:57 +0800 <NKrankie> It's true. She did say that. And he's been dead for years. Got shot in a drive by.

1313926792391131138 2020-10-08 03:38:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @mrjohnhendry @NicolaSturgeon Yes, but it means we can't have a glass of red with lunch. Men can't have a pint after work. I know it's Scotland but some of us are capable of having just the one (bottle of Scotch).
1313926287984128000 2020-10-08 03:36:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @Myst5575 @NicolaSturgeon Yes, I know it's Scotland but some of us are able to have a glass of red and walk away. Some men like one after work pint. It makes no sense to me.

1313923931166957568 2020-10-08 03:27:31 +0800 <NKrankie> Why can pubs and cafes be open but they can't sell alcohol? I would have thought alcohol killed, or sterilised germs or viruses. Why in the name of God can every other beverage except for alcohol be sold? Can someone explain to me @NicolaSturgeon

1313826050556792832 2020-10-07 20:58:34 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish Hes done job creation. Trade deals. Military. Wall. Drug prices.A lot of good things that no one can dispute. I think perhaps your disappointment is in relation to smashing the system? I think he has definitely put cracks in the wall. But its ancient and complex and corrupt
1313824906707075075 2020-10-07 20:54:02 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish Yes I know. I think I'm slightly more hopeful about him than you are. In those circles I'm not sure they're friends like you and I are. Its more like social acquaintances

1313790278545928194 2020-10-07 18:36:26 +0800 <NKrankie> Look at how stunning this lady is. I love that she's standing to the side. It looks like a fashion shoot delivering a public message. Keeps things interesting. Looks like a 50s film audition along the lines of ones I've seen from Marilyn.
1313788135512387586 2020-10-07 18:27:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @DeanScott24 I noticed. It's a sure sign that they know exactly how the public are feeling.
1313787859778838535 2020-10-07 18:26:49 +0800 <NKrankie> @Mpumi_Moments @Westie66167541 Just for clarification, the white man is the devil and the black man can do no wrong? Is that correct? P.s. are you still burning albinos for their mojo? Burning women for witchcraft? Men still raping virgins to cure their HIV?
1313786201808220161 2020-10-07 18:20:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @lostcreatives1 Yes, there was a tennis club where I grew up but my family couldn't afford the fees for me to play there. So I'm sure there are as many white people can't afford access to certain higher levels of things as there are blacks.
1313785597463584769 2020-10-07 18:17:50 +0800 <NKrankie> Yes, because Diane Abbott getting elected is a date for the history books.

1313781022211874821 2020-10-07 17:59:39 +0800 <NKrankie> English Heritage is jumping on the black bandwagon too. Introducing 'overlooked' black figures into their sites from next year.

1313068352483586049 2020-10-05 18:47:45 +0800 <NKrankie> My tuppence for the day. In the gay community, it's commonplace for the 'men' to refer to us women as being 'fish'. This suggests that our nether regions smell like high tide. I find it one more disgusting impulse and attitude coming out of the untouchable and saintly LGBT
1313067502042312706 2020-10-05 18:44:22 +0800 <NKrankie> @jjswin Yet gay men would LOVE a straight man drawing all over them. Tell your community to stop calling us 'fish' and we'll start talking about mutual respect. Your hatred for women is repulsive.

1313066014188474369 2020-10-05 18:38:28 +0800 <NKrankie> @jjswin @bigwal5353 @1Fubar Are you crying about homophobia whilst using slurs against people with mental health problems? 'Nut' is completely unacceptable language to use. Apologise or I'm reporting you. Delete your tweet.
1313065805421084674 2020-10-05 18:37:38 +0800 <NKrankie> @jjswin @bigwal5353 @1Fubar No, it's a culmination of seeing rainbow cars, cops in high heels, nail varnish, walking leather pups, posing with chaps, and more that is pushing me to the edge. It's not this one clip, which I admit is very tame. I personally have had enough.  WE GET IT
1313065406484152322 2020-10-05 18:36:03 +0800 <NKrankie> How would LGBT react if heterosexual police officer, fire workers, ambulance crew, etc. came over to them in a parade and got in their faces just to remind them that straight people exist. Cue screams of homophobia and oppression.
1313065152695209985 2020-10-05 18:35:02 +0800 <NKrankie> @jjswin @bigwal5353 @1Fubar You keep going back to the 'circus clown'. Note the heterosexual man whose face he tries to draw on. He's repulsed to have the cops overt sexuality near him. If that had been a normal clown, he probably wouldn't have objected.
1313064914710335488 2020-10-05 18:34:05 +0800 <NKrankie> @jjswin @bigwal5353 @1Fubar What cave do you live in that we don't know gays exist? Heterosexual people often have more 'deviant' sex than gays do. My issue is that all you have to offer is 'sex acts'. There's nothing else that makes you stand apart from other human beings. It's dull and boring.

And don't try to throw 'homophobia' at me because I have an opinion on men and how they walk. Get over yourself and your 'cause'.
1313064223598145536 2020-10-05 18:31:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @jjswin @bigwal5353 @1Fubar That's all you had to say from the start. Public figures should remain neutral at all times. I don't want to feel that man would be more sympathetic in his policing towards gays than he would be to myself if I had any criticism or objection. That's the issue. Impartiality

What does wearing heels and makeup got to do with being gay? Ass chaps, boas, dildoes stuck on foreheads at Pride? It sends out a message that to be gay is to be those things.

1312314018489565184 2020-10-03 16:50:18 +0800 <NKrankie> Diversity quotas are silly. We're all adults and can choose our own career paths. We know we don't live in a racist society, and we know we can apply for any jobs we like   https://t.co/pAbE5gFpbH
1312312137134505984 2020-10-03 16:42:49 +0800 <NKrankie> Blacks will get 'greater recognition' for their products if they come up with something that is innovative and which fills a gap in the market and that people want. You don't get to create mediocrity and demand recognition for doing so. #Grifters    https://t.co/Rk9gOcM1Wz
1312303699683954688 2020-10-03 16:09:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @Shergs888 @Iknewheronce Maybe install a climbing/jungle gym for any passengers who suddenly get the urge to climb things.
1312302996051689472 2020-10-03 16:06:30 +0800 <NKrankie> I'm still uncertain as to the laws of viruses. Do we walk around healthy with cold or flu viruses in us? Does simply having the virus mean it's a death sentence, or that our lungs will be scarred and kidneys damaged? Is it a big deal?   https://t.co/FcJTU4dEav
1312302141512519681 2020-10-03 16:03:06 +0800 <NKrankie> Lancashire. Two women found dead in a partially burned house. If it was partially burned, you'd expect there to be an accessible exit for at least one of them. My mind goes to a double honour killing, but we'll see what the police report finds.   https://t.co/ot9Gev6kTd
1312298273986809858 2020-10-03 15:47:44 +0800 <NKrankie> @sainsburys @LadystephJ Do you have a direct email address for your complaints dept. Not just a generic one, but an email address that will go straight to the head of PR or marketing? You will not get away with allowing operatives on twitter to imply we're all racists and you don't need anyone's money
1312297581008097280 2020-10-03 15:44:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @sainsburys @LadystephJ Are you standing by your decision yesterday to post an inflammatory tweet that suggested the majority of us are racists and that we can take our business elsewhere if we don't like the abuse you hurl out to us on social media?
1312294689622700032 2020-10-03 15:33:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @mrjohnhendry Isn't he an agitator? I've read that he would turn up at protests and throw himself into someone's fist in order to scream homophobe.
1312293818499203072 2020-10-03 15:30:02 +0800 <NKrankie> They're trolling us. And they most definitely will not answer the queries I've put to them. Let's do our best to boycott Sainsburys. Remember, no matter where they are on the high street, there's usually a M&amp;S or Tesco express two doors away. Get your extra steps in for the day
1312293220630638592 2020-10-03 15:27:39 +0800 <NKrankie> @sainsburys Why do you think that alienating the public by insinuating the majority of them are racists is good business practice? And why do you feel anyone, including black people, should be forced to celebrate black history month? It's very racist of you to think that. They're not sheep
1312155359319003136 2020-10-03 06:19:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @LozzaFox By 'sacred' do you mean in a divine, created by God sense, and in a general way. Or are you saying that Hitler's life was sacred?
1312150059383885824 2020-10-03 05:58:47 +0800 <NKrankie> That big bruise on his forehead is common with muslim men who pray continually. It's a carpet burn. He attacked guards, and was carrying isis material. Says it was coincidence, he was reading it to improve his French.    https://t.co/2ax8K43chT
1312148803017822209 2020-10-03 05:53:47 +0800 <NKrankie> Things appear to be getting heated down Buckingham Palace way. Kate's uncle tells Harry and Meghan to 'shut the duck up' after their racism claims.    https://t.co/z3HwS0rBgD

1312143582703218689 2020-10-03 05:33:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @juliesmith472 It must be a kink or a fetish for them. There's dating apps they could use if they want to hook up for sex. Even I know that.
1312143242528317440 2020-10-03 05:31:42 +0800 <NKrankie> @TaggartRearden That's exquisite. I would love that combo in my room. I'm saving that picture for inspiration. I also like the colour of the flooring there too. The lighter wood is all right with the pink and the ivory curtains. I had thought I would need to go walnut.
1312120790720999424 2020-10-03 04:02:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @HaineSharan I wouldnt watch anything like that. I boycott everything to do with them
1312115031383830528 2020-10-03 03:39:36 +0800 <NKrankie> Machines are racially biased now. If a programme is grabbing a face, it'll be to do with how well lit it is. Chinese or Japanese faces would be grabbed as easily as white ones would. Dark faces blend into shadows.   https://t.co/HjBGS6FOEn
1312112069714407424 2020-10-03 03:27:49 +0800 <NKrankie> We're HOMOPHOBIC if we don't want to witness gay men having sex in bushes in a public park. Likewise, we're ISLAMOPHOBIC if we don't want to witness honour killings, child marriages, grooming gangs, etc. They name call us in a bid to silence us against perversions.
1312107051330334720 2020-10-03 03:07:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @Stewarty2013 @BubbaDunnam Don't you worry about that. Starmer has it covered.    https://t.co/r4KYj67Egy
1312099449523458049 2020-10-03 02:37:41 +0800 <NKrankie> @RajagraUK I saw that. Agreed.
1312098162493067270 2020-10-03 02:32:34 +0800 <NKrankie> @RajagraUK And you know that tweet was directed at whites. They weren't directing it at any other race.
1312096836874833920 2020-10-03 02:27:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @designsbywillow I thought the same, but it's on their twitter so it must be.
1312096752447762432 2020-10-03 02:26:58 +0800 <NKrankie> @Stewarty2013 Let's see if the comments on that tweet force them to come out with the usual hollow apology.
1312095622732877825 2020-10-03 02:22:28 +0800 <NKrankie> @Stewarty2013 To be fair, they're celebrating Black History Month. They just don't like that we're mocking them coz there's not too much to be celebrating. And what is worth celebrating could be done in one night, not a whole month.
1312095242191953920 2020-10-03 02:20:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @NathanQ88 I hope you're not in Sainsbury's. We're boycotting them now.
1312093285306052609 2020-10-03 02:13:11 +0800 <NKrankie> @Stewarty2013 Better believe it. No idea how they think this is good PR, basically telling us we're all racist and we can go stuff ourselves. That tweet can only be directed at white people. They won't have Chinese in mind when they wrote it.
1312089831275720710 2020-10-03 01:59:27 +0800 <NKrankie> Black History Month, innit? Reggae 'after party' during lockdown with over 200 mourners passing da dutchy on dey left hand side. Who has an after party at a funeral? Some snacks in the Parochial hall, perhaps, but a full on Bob Marley?    https://t.co/wj7J83bNH7
1312088741402546176 2020-10-03 01:55:08 +0800 <NKrankie> He's been to jihadist training camp in Pakistan, and is living right here in the UK, breaching his bail conditions.  Another one for MI5 to let slip through the net at some future point.    https://t.co/YqJBhWCB3k
1312087447103209473 2020-10-03 01:49:59 +0800 <NKrankie> He was mouthing off like the silly 16 year old that he was. Notice this 'far right nazi terrorist' wannabe doesn't have mental health problems like the far left and islamist terrorists do.     https://t.co/ZWD4D4NTjO
1312083636259303426 2020-10-03 01:34:50 +0800 <NKrankie> Wonder who authored this tweet. Note the aggression. Were Sainsbury's this aggressive during gay Pride month? Black crime rates. Aggression.
1312083440997720064 2020-10-03 01:34:04 +0800 <NKrankie> @sainsburys Did you put out as aggressive a tweet during Pride month? Why the aggression? You're looking like a stereotype. Black crime rates and all that. You can never be civil.
1312082638971252736 2020-10-03 01:30:53 +0800 <NKrankie> 2.5K cancer patients being neglected in Manchester. Isn't there more chance of dying from cancer than covid?    https://t.co/NHcUPlVUPI
1312079096726401026 2020-10-03 01:16:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @sainsburys I think you should fire your social media operative. This is an inflammatory tweet that overlooks all the victims of diversity. Underage white girls who have been groomed and raped, wives/daughters who are honour killed. There's the diversity you're celebrating. Morons.
1312078814994993154 2020-10-03 01:15:41 +0800 <NKrankie> Serving grooming gang members, cultural 'diverse' rapists, and drug dealers. If you don't like it, go elsewhere because @sainsburys do not want your custom.
1312078258071101440 2020-10-03 01:13:28 +0800 <NKrankie> They're giving us no hint as to what men raped this boy in temporary B+B accommodation. Only says they were known for grooming and raping.    https://t.co/m1mJ58xdZf
1312077391582420993 2020-10-03 01:10:02 +0800 <NKrankie> And parts of pakistan are the same. Afghan immigrant tells police it's normal for men to rape children in his country. You can't talk about this though, or you're a RACIST   https://t.co/YjHJGFiLbk
1312077121225981954 2020-10-03 01:08:57 +0800 <NKrankie> Four migrants in Sweden have allegiances to isis. But they're all helpless victims, let them in. They're unaccompanied children.    https://t.co/W56G9XwZ9H
1312076865423712256 2020-10-03 01:07:56 +0800 <NKrankie> Compo face, if that's her in the picture. She not only got a ham sandwich during lockdown, she got bacon flavoured crisps too. Seasoning doesn't have pig parts in it, does it? Double the compo  https://t.co/AsgzVtqoOG
1312076491753164801 2020-10-03 01:06:27 +0800 <NKrankie> Islamist in Spain taking advantage of this migration situation. They're calling this a 'diaspora', which of course has biblical connotations in relation to the Jews. This is not a forced displacement of people. This is young men chancing it   https://t.co/gruX3tzlKz
1312073757385687041 2020-10-03 00:55:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @TaggartRearden Thank you for these. I like the Vanilla Bath üòç Thanks for your input. That's very generous of you.

I think sage walls safest. Thanks for your advice and input. Really appreciated.
1311944478073200640 2020-10-02 16:21:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @ShedHender It's chipboard that's down, I'm going to have to cover it somehow.

1311808947897106433 2020-10-02 07:23:20 +0800 <NKrankie> What came before these left wing hysterics? I'm trying to think back to the 80s or 90s or to any time where I recall a wave of people emoting so outrageously in public. I can't think. Possibly some hippies?

1311753213864009734 2020-10-02 03:41:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @MarkOfEngland1 Thank you very much for that.
1311752978374766594 2020-10-02 03:40:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @halifax173 That sounds heavenly
1311752727811293186 2020-10-02 03:39:56 +0800 <NKrankie> Now we're celebrating black chefs. Your guess is as good as mine. Something to do with black history month.   https://t.co/pBmc8pEUeo

1311742877505069057 2020-10-02 03:00:47 +0800 <NKrankie> Good. Never apologise, never denounce anyone either. Media don't care about Proud Boys, and when they ask Trump to 'denounce' them, what they really want is for Trump to dance like a trained seal. They don't care about racism.   https://t.co/2oVTg882Jo

1311737111750508545 2020-10-02 02:37:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @kathy_kathys2 Ah, that's wall tiles?  I would like that as flooring. It's lovley
1311736909341884417 2020-10-02 02:37:04 +0800 <NKrankie> @kathy_kathys2 Is that the pattern or are you choosing one tile to be the pattern on the whole floor?  I love it the way it looks just now. I would lay that on my floor.

1311719156396576768 2020-10-02 01:26:32 +0800 <NKrankie> @Highlandfreethi And Atomic Blond with chalize theron.  You could see there was no force behind her kicks or punches and yet you've got grown men hurling themselves off balconies as though she had the strength of mike tyson. Too unbelievable.
1311718602865868800 2020-10-02 01:24:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @Kazansky66 Thanks, I'm going to the shops at the weekend to check it out. I think this will be the one I'll go with.

1311717099115552772 2020-10-02 01:18:21 +0800 <NKrankie> @Highlandfreethi I switch off immediately. Or if I feel the cast is ticking colour boxes and that their appearance makes no sense to the plot. I switch off too.
1311716903715508227 2020-10-02 01:17:35 +0800 <NKrankie> @Kazansky66 Sounds like I could even be able to do that myself. And do I put beading around it?
1311716793589866500 2020-10-02 01:17:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @TimInEngland Thanks for that information
1311716752720629763 2020-10-02 01:16:59 +0800 <NKrankie> @TimInEngland I'll need to get a man in to lay it all for me, whatever I choose. I can't do these things.
1311715258264883200 2020-10-02 01:11:02 +0800 <NKrankie> @Kazansky66 Is it a stanley knife?
1311715108758880257 2020-10-02 01:10:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @commonsenseuk74 Thanks, it's plywood under the carpet in there just now.
1311714898993389569 2020-10-02 01:09:37 +0800 <NKrankie> @Kazansky66 Thank you. I really like the look of it.
1311714392883552260 2020-10-02 01:07:36 +0800 <NKrankie> @Highlandfreethi When he started sacrificing his safety for the 'refugees' I thought to myself it was getting a bit more 'woke' than I would have liked. But it worked out in the end.
1311714204685131778 2020-10-02 01:06:51 +0800 <NKrankie> @TimInEngland No, I've just had it for so many years. I thought there must be new inventions for flooring out there by now.
1311713216196685825 2020-10-02 01:02:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @GitGrumpygit @clivesinclair It's not ideal. That's for sure.
1311712950693113857 2020-10-02 01:01:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @clivesinclair @GitGrumpygit Thank you. It's making me gag. I need it done ASAP
1311710829503483904 2020-10-02 00:53:26 +0800 <NKrankie> @mik61scot It's disgusting. It's getting ripped up and replace ASAP.  It's making me boak.
1311710701992448001 2020-10-02 00:52:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @jolenebuntinguk See I would have made sure my foot fit all the way down his throat. And then I'd push it in and pull it out, give him that nice stroking motion he loves so much. In and out, baby. All night long.
1311709873797828609 2020-10-02 00:49:38 +0800 <NKrankie> @Kazansky66 That looks beautiful. So you lay it just like you lay laminate?
1311709664241909765 2020-10-02 00:48:48 +0800 <NKrankie> @Flora34921110 Sounds lush. I love it. I like white too. You can see if anything's dirty.

1311708737674059783 2020-10-02 00:45:08 +0800 <NKrankie> @GitGrumpygit Quite ugly then, and not much I can do but cover it up.
1311708648780029954 2020-10-02 00:44:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @Kazansky66 Never heard of it.

1311688124175724544 2020-10-01 23:23:13 +0800 <NKrankie> Stop whinging. All you're doing in whinging. The UK is not a racist country. I can't think of any country in the world where racism is a popular and legitimate pastime.
1311686541253713920 2020-10-01 23:16:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @ShushMartin Very apt.

1311684513815236610 2020-10-01 23:08:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @ShushMartin If you're feeling philanthropic, send it my way.
1311684417249832960 2020-10-01 23:08:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @caromitchell1 Sounds expensive.

1311680800874733569 2020-10-01 22:54:07 +0800 <NKrankie> @luconilu I want to do it right, so I'm not afraid of the cost, but ideally I'd like to not take out an overdraft for it either. Isn't porcelain expensive?
1311680616988016641 2020-10-01 22:53:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @twickertweet4 I miss my old carpet. My feet would disappear into it.

1311680075520249856 2020-10-01 22:51:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @ThisIsTheWorl18 Yes, I was seeing that it's a green option

1311679884918493184 2020-10-01 22:50:29 +0800 <NKrankie> @leighkeystone Thanks, yes laminate seems to be most popular option. Vinyl looks appealing. I'm going to go in the store and have a feel at it and see what it looks like.
1311679681528303616 2020-10-01 22:49:40 +0800 <NKrankie> @LadystephJ Is that vinyl?
1311679622933815301 2020-10-01 22:49:26 +0800 <NKrankie> @roodio I'm scared of beasties. I like it sealed up nice and tight so that not even a spider can get through the cracks.

1311677699832844288 2020-10-01 22:41:48 +0800 <NKrankie> I'm decorating my bedroom. What options are out there other than carpet or laminate for the flooring? Sick of both of them.

1311643537050611713 2020-10-01 20:26:03 +0800 <NKrankie> Why is Harry going into kids' shops and only noticing 'white dolls'? There is no 'structural racism' here.

1311631344875823112 2020-10-01 19:37:36 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish @BrainGrug It's like Primark clothing. Bad designs, bad cuts. I mean someone had to design it. Some materials have to be used. Why not do it right?
1311628498763689985 2020-10-01 19:26:17 +0800 <NKrankie> @EternalEnglish @BrainGrug Dear God. I've seen artists' impression of how this will look when finished. It's seems to be ultra modern, but at least expensive looking. No doubt better than the old St. James.

Everyone else, regardless of skin tone, has a voice which they can use. Your skin colour does not make you vulnerable. Unless you're white these days.

Lot of glass buildings have been thrown up, and last time I was there I noticed a lot of construction around holyrood. More new builds probably

1311621235139371008 2020-10-01 18:57:25 +0800 <NKrankie> Scottish parliament building is ugly. It's not at all sympathetic to the architecture that surrounds it. Nor is it unique enough to be a stand-alone piece. It looks like cheap B+Q self assembly.
1311618884588449793 2020-10-01 18:48:05 +0800 <NKrankie> We haven't changed much as a people. It's like the Scarlet Letter all over again. Branded with an A for being an adulterer. Parliament's portraits will come with a plaque detailing the person's links to slavery if they have any. Name and shame   https://t.co/ropOjRoLWA
1311617299431018498 2020-10-01 18:41:47 +0800 <NKrankie> @TangoBravo02 Probably his brother. He got a bigger fine did he not for protesting lockdown?
1311617193298341888 2020-10-01 18:41:22 +0800 <NKrankie> CA passes law against 'hair based discrimination'. It's not just black people who can't go to work with funky hairstyles. None of us can if we work in corporate environments. Punk was never allowed in the office. Plus, black hair is hard to manage.     https://t.co/VdMKj4nOFb
1311616233125670912 2020-10-01 18:37:33 +0800 <NKrankie> Calling @NazShahBfd a 'grooming gangs apologist' would not be a lie. She retweeted a tweet which said 'raped girls should shut up for the sake of diversity'. If that's not being sympathetic to rapists, I don't know what is.

1311609371760222208 2020-10-01 18:10:17 +0800 <NKrankie> They should also ask them to deposit their testicles in a box for safekeeping upon joining.

1311608496455127040 2020-10-01 18:06:48 +0800 <NKrankie> Who votes for anyone who has this kind of message?

1311483283163635712 2020-10-01 09:49:15 +0800 <NKrankie> When people talk about 'white supremacy', they're simply saying white people should not have a voice or a say in anything. This war on white people is really vile.

1311468613346430976 2020-10-01 08:50:57 +0800 <NKrankie> @QuatloosX Yes, he is a man and he loves women, so he's straight.  But in today's world that makes him a lesbian.
1311467445253742598 2020-10-01 08:46:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @QuatloosX He doesn't realise that sexual ORIENTATION is completely different from sexual PREFERENCE. That's where his homophobia comes into play. If you don't sleep with him, you're a bigot. ORIENTATION goes out the window at that point and there's no room for PREFERENCE
1311462542435287043 2020-10-01 08:26:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @Highlandfreethi I binge watched it all. I hope they do another series.
1311459800476192774 2020-10-01 08:15:56 +0800 <NKrankie> @jaycee1001 He's homophobic. From watching Magdalen Berns I'm understanding that trans people are homophobic. They don't allow people to have same sex preferences, these men have to say that people are bigots for not wanting to sleep with them.
1311457779534761984 2020-10-01 08:07:55 +0800 <NKrankie> This man has accepted the fact that he's a lesbian. Honestly, I just can't even...   https://t.co/jezPZrwNNN

1311440940515635203 2020-10-01 07:01:00 +0800 <NKrankie> It's relentless. Labour call for schools to teach more about black British history. No calls for any other race's history in the UK, however. No other group of people have done so little and been lifted so high.    https://t.co/CaXeIAHk4o

1311434858535817216 2020-10-01 06:36:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @seven7ins I guarantee you he cries after he orgasms with his partner.

1311428828078710786 2020-10-01 06:12:52 +0800 <NKrankie> @Joe_Stead You would not complain about her and try to get her sacked and publicly shame her if she weren't white.
1311428583139803136 2020-10-01 06:11:54 +0800 <NKrankie> @Joe_Stead @Tesco Was she white? Would you complain about her if she were BAME? I think not.
1311424408918151169 2020-10-01 05:55:18 +0800 <NKrankie> Privilege? Hundreds of Muslims turned out for a funeral. Not one arrest was made, not one fixed penalty notice given. Special treatment towards groups of people leads to resentment from others. Hence, 'islamophobia'.    https://t.co/yl6cQm1ehQ

1311420607989510149 2020-10-01 05:40:12 +0800 <NKrankie> It won't kill you. Just eat it. Compromises must be made at some point in all of our lives. I'm so sick of people whinging.    https://t.co/ARL3jUahli
1311418938153144321 2020-10-01 05:33:34 +0800 <NKrankie> Well said. How can you judge same sex couples?

Do you make exceptions for her on the score card, and would this be fair to men?   https://t.co/jFvT8DSFL5

1311410588652797954 2020-10-01 05:00:23 +0800 <NKrankie> @AlanC_69 I lived in Tollcross for 15 years, but do feel free to enlighten me. I'm currently in Shettleston. I never said no Rangers fans live there, I simply said it's dangerous to be proudly Protestant. You getting it yet?
1311409672142938114 2020-10-01 04:56:45 +0800 <NKrankie> @AlanC_69 It is essentially what I asked in my tweet. And if you live in Glasgow you know damn well what I'm talking about. There are areas and bars that you simply cannot go in and down by yourself in full colours at risk of physical attack. Stop being so bloody stupid.

1311408562443374597 2020-10-01 04:52:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @AlanC_69 Would you walk into Bar 67 on the Gallowgate by yourself on a Saturday night in full Rangers gear and think everyone wants to be your mate? Do you think you would survive it?

1311407652535140352 2020-10-01 04:48:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @scottisunionist So your wife was known to the area. Got it.
1311407528287367168 2020-10-01 04:48:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @AlanC_69 neither one would go out in full colours in a part of the city or any pub where their faces weren't known or if they weren't with a group of mates from the area. Try to deny that isn't asking for trouble. You would not survive a Saturday night.
1311405791237361666 2020-10-01 04:41:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @AlanC_69 Give me the stats and data. You've made a claim, now the onus is on you to back it up.
1311405613717614592 2020-10-01 04:40:37 +0800 <NKrankie> @scottisunionist Was that because you were born there and your face was recognisable?
1311405429239484416 2020-10-01 04:39:53 +0800 <NKrankie> @AlanC_69 They don't though. So no need to lie.

I'm talking during the course of a normal day or night. NO ONE would go to Parkhead with Rangers kit on and expect to party as normal. Absolutely NO ONE.
1311404377198989313 2020-10-01 04:35:42 +0800 <NKrankie> Glaswegians. Would you proudly walk around Parkhead on any given day with your Rangers kit on and feel safee? And Celtic people, would you comfortably walk around Ibrox of a day with your green hoopie stripes on?

Your WHO 'evidence' for circumcision simply states that if you have unsafe sex, don't wash yourself, and have multiple partners you'll catch an STD.
1310330603703857152 2020-09-28 05:28:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @estherk_k No esther. You need to stop talking about African mens sex drive. Too many of them are guilty of sex crimes here in the UK upon landing. We know damn well how horny they are. Its all they rap about too.

1310326674932760577 2020-09-28 05:13:18 +0800 <NKrankie> @estherk_k Cancer angle is debunked. A too tight foreskin can be surgically removed in adulthood at owner's discretion. Everything in that list you sent can be prevented with frequent bathing and not being a man whore in Africa. Its lazy. Its like taking PrEP pills

1310190703889219584 2020-09-27 20:13:00 +0800 <NKrankie> NHS dentists aren't allowed to use air or water jets. Cant give fillings or cleanings. BUT the exact same dentists can do all of those things legally if you go private. Does corona ignore the rich? That's a smart virus @NicolaSturgeon

1310174463464480773 2020-09-27 19:08:28 +0800 <NKrankie> Translation. White parents have adopted black children and given them better lives. But this black man is outraged. Would he rather they remained in the deepest jungles by themselves? The most abject poverty?

1310161667230248962 2020-09-27 18:17:37 +0800 <NKrankie> Is it just me? Anyone can buy one of these disability lanyard and con someone into thinking they're vulnerable. Surely there should be some sort of safeguarding going on before someone gets one.

I flicked through a couple of his youtube videos and he doesn't look like he's putting on quality productions. He is unkempt, dresses like a tramp, and it's mainly sports people he has on? Not very original thinker either.

1310153269558284288 2020-09-27 17:44:15 +0800 <NKrankie> Your sperm, your choice. Sperm donor sues after clinic 'created' 9 kids for gays against his wishes.

1309053032353726464 2020-09-24 16:52:18 +0800 <NKrankie> No, every black woman with an opinion isn't portrayed as being 'angry'. It's generally the ripping off of wigs, and leaping the counter at the local waffle or chicken house that gives us the impression they're angry and violent.    https://t.co/2LIqo4HNqo

1308912106591449096 2020-09-24 07:32:19 +0800 <NKrankie> Black people are once more rioting over a black criminal. I want black people to put forward a role model that I can get behind, because right now all they're offering me is crime and discontent.
1308906566964449280 2020-09-24 07:10:18 +0800 <NKrankie> Breonna Taylor's family were awarded 12 million dollars, and the woman was a drug courier and money launderer. If you're black, just scream loud enough, no matter how criminal you are. The West is coming to despise this.

1308791093295812608 2020-09-23 23:31:27 +0800 <NKrankie> Blacks refuse to own it. They are fully aware of their ancestors' role in the slave trade, and rather than engage with that dark history they simply put the focus on the white man who purchased slaves. It's like going after the addict and not the drug dealer.

1308709532709859328 2020-09-23 18:07:21 +0800 <NKrankie> Females are greeting the illegals at the gates of barracks and leaving notes with hearts on them to welcome them. These are men who have been socialised in countries where women have no rights. More hot baths, laudanum, restraints and smelling salts for these lassies.  https://t.co/bxGNU1snl6

She comes from a culture where the father dictates what the daughter will do. Peeing in the shower cannot be so scandalous to her. She's faking it.

So with adults, warm water relaxes our bladders and we pee. I wash my shower religiously whether I pee in it or not. My bodily fluids are not toxic. Don't try to shame me.
1308534811825516544 2020-09-23 06:33:05 +0800 <NKrankie> @MiraGhoshal @JasonFletcher74 I think intimacy is what people are craving but they get sidetracked by quick fix sex. intimacy is priceless.

1308471927380598789 2020-09-23 02:23:12 +0800 <NKrankie> @IggMusic Well, that's encouraging to hear. I had wondered if the genre had simply exhausted itself. But, as you say, society is illiterate and people don't want to hurt their brains by thinking too much, so the appeal goes to the lowest common denominator.

1308468923638190080 2020-09-23 02:11:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @IggMusic Haven't standards dropped and people have just gotten lazy? Elvis was sexual. Joplin was sexual. Glam rock was sexual, Marc Bolen 2 but all of it intelligent. Madonna was down in the mud for my taste, but rap doesn't even try. It's just penises, drugs and moist vaginas. It's lazy

1308463541121437703 2020-09-23 01:49:52 +0800 <NKrankie> Covid is nowhere close to being one of 'humanity's biggest challenges'. Wee nippy is trying to make it sound like it is, and as though she is presiding over something akin to being the end of the world. It's not even as bad as a cold.

1308461324578496515 2020-09-23 01:41:04 +0800 <NKrankie> @IggMusic I read a book on music and morality. Europeans gave opera, classical, etc. Morality was great. Black gives rap. And that therefore impacts upon the morality of the community. Cardi will inspire 'moist' young women, and then they'll wonder why their lives are crap.
1308460989856309248 2020-09-23 01:39:44 +0800 <NKrankie> All of you covid believers are responsible for this. You all played your part. Mask wearing sheep.

1305912345915392001 2020-09-16 00:52:20 +0800 <NKrankie> @SamJRushworth @unicawn It's a distinguishing feature, much like hair or eye colour is. Now since you're a mental health advocate, how bout you explain to twitter how killing an unborn child and battering a mother to be is a 'mental health issue'. What would your diagnosis be?
1305911876489031683 2020-09-16 00:50:28 +0800 <NKrankie> @DanRich1979 Doesn't say. Has white sounding name though

1305890597799178248 2020-09-15 23:25:55 +0800 <NKrankie> Pakistani community are the worst for this. If one person is in trouble, they entire community comes out to defend them, even when they're in the wrong. This woman isn't behaving very modestly though. Have to say.
1305890043853180928 2020-09-15 23:23:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @graeme_boro Not many details. Happened in a hotel, so I assumed a hotel for immigrants.
1305888585342648320 2020-09-15 23:17:55 +0800 <NKrankie> Both babies are mixed race. One is newer and has had less sun exposure, so it's lighter. Black men don't conceive white babies. They're mixed race and that's fine. Diversity star is saying he has one white baby and one black one. Terrible father.    https://t.co/cmlo5NdtSG
1305887601090531329 2020-09-15 23:14:00 +0800 <NKrankie> Black man in Glasgow batters his girlfriend so bad she loses the baby. Had to jump out a window, broke feet and couldn't walk for 6 weeks. Sat on her belly, punched her. Judge says 'mental health' issues.    https://t.co/sD4A3apLux
1305885778950656000 2020-09-15 23:06:46 +0800 <NKrankie> @LozzaFox Didn't you just 'snitch' on your friend as a 'racist' because she blocked you?
1305841261237219328 2020-09-15 20:09:52 +0800 <NKrankie> She's not letting up. It should concern all residents of Scotland that wee nippy has jumped all over this 'crisis' like a dog on a soft toy.
1305839053527568384 2020-09-15 20:01:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @MrSugden2 Whites can't experience racism according to the left.
1305837931978948609 2020-09-15 19:56:38 +0800 <NKrankie> The only time racism in the UK will end is when whites are in a minority, and when we're all doing the menial jobs that no one else wants. And when BAME people hold every position of power and influence. And even then they'll attack us for other things.
1305835488000053249 2020-09-15 19:46:56 +0800 <NKrankie> What does 'tweet more carefully' mean? We all know his stance by this point.    https://t.co/gLF6fHblvF

1305812061054799872 2020-09-15 18:13:50 +0800 <NKrankie> @myhollycat That's because masks don't work. You should read the article.
1305808459770859520 2020-09-15 17:59:32 +0800 <NKrankie> @myhollycat It doesn't bother me. It's not sexual, and his oral hygiene is excellent. And I'm not afraid of viruses.
1305808154895224832 2020-09-15 17:58:19 +0800 <NKrankie> @stewtgriffiths Climates would scream that we're using too much electricity on it.

1305805874707992576 2020-09-15 17:49:15 +0800 <NKrankie> They gave out one hell of a rash, but I'm surprised that Greta and co. aren't calling for a return to cotton, washable nappies. These disposable ones could fill entire countries with waste. Should we save the planet and bring back a towel with safety pins for our kids bottoms?
1305805238075617281 2020-09-15 17:46:44 +0800 <NKrankie> @myhollycat As were nappies. Curious fact, my dentist has never used a mask while being within inches of my mouth.

1305798103333773313 2020-09-15 17:18:23 +0800 <NKrankie> Masks do not work. They have never been recommended for seasonal flu. If a surgeon had a virus, he would not operate because masks don't work. They simply stop water droplets falling from surgeon's mouth/nose.    https://t.co/WTKSfZgWqQ

1305792819903291393 2020-09-15 16:57:23 +0800 <NKrankie> That looks like it hurt. He landed right on his vagina.
1305787923283968000 2020-09-15 16:37:55 +0800 <NKrankie> Priti says she'll call the police on her neighbours for gatherings of more than six. Meanwhile, she turns a blind eye to the gatherings of 'more than six' on dinghies coming across the channel.    https://t.co/3BvyrN4wv2
1305787489446133760 2020-09-15 16:36:12 +0800 <NKrankie> White girls in the UK never thought they would need to get used to racism either, but here we find ourselves. This girl doesn't need to be on social media. She can take her compo, grievance face and delete her channel. TikTok isnt necessary for survival.    https://t.co/D0s7NS0LOn
1305785280352391168 2020-09-15 16:27:25 +0800 <NKrankie> @Dsmythe29825546 They also wiped the black actor out of the star wars poster, while keeping the white actors in it. Spot the difference?  https://t.co/tqJrwzVOq0
1305784827057246210 2020-09-15 16:25:37 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 And you could blame this on 'climate' because clearly it's weather patterns and sea levels over the year. It's just so lazy to scream 'climate change emergency disaster' at everything that goes wrong. It's like 'racist' .
1305784282661691393 2020-09-15 16:23:27 +0800 <NKrankie> Are they coming here from Uganda? Because right now in Uganda, child sacrifice is quite popular, and the gov and now only 'considering' the death penalty for people who participate in it.    https://t.co/tzV5fZki0J
1305782670266380288 2020-09-15 16:17:03 +0800 <NKrankie> @AngelaMcKavana1 But is it climate change? Or is it a natural consequence of many years of rain? Could the people who built the lines there have anticipated it a little better, or checked it annually and propped it up?
1305782426136981504 2020-09-15 16:16:05 +0800 <NKrankie> Malmo Sweden. This guy looks 'white' with quite a DEEP TAN. I would hate to assume anything about his status or race. He could have burst her ear drum   https://t.co/kfbTPwXLvh
1305781718964674560 2020-09-15 16:13:16 +0800 <NKrankie> @chrisdavies I admire them for it. Keep Chinese men as the emblem of masculinity over there. Over here we've got all sorts of fey and soy boys in skirts with the women taking care of them.
1305781549850341376 2020-09-15 16:12:36 +0800 <NKrankie> Climate change is the reason why two portions of steep embankment in the Highlands crumbled. Nothing to do with heavy rain fall year after year simply eroding the landscape. Every day it's something new they want us to live in fear of.    https://t.co/3wUE3xM17U
1305780383900893185 2020-09-15 16:07:58 +0800 <NKrankie> China don't like black people in their ads. They re-shot the Jo Malone ad using a Chinese man to replace the black guy. Chinese people won't be suffering from any kind of ethnic, racial, or cultural confusion.     https://t.co/2LI7zrqusA
1305778310262251520 2020-09-15 15:59:44 +0800 <NKrankie> @DaveMac75662851 Yes, I loved that.
1305622138834083840 2020-09-15 05:39:09 +0800 <NKrankie> Is she trolling trans people now? Her new book is about a man who dresses up as a woman to kill women. The message is hardly a flattering one to 'trans women'. This is JK's trial by social media shaming. Let's see if she survives   https://t.co/27EvuIGgFg
1305606153745899520 2020-09-15 04:35:38 +0800 <NKrankie> @daveS1872 I didn't mind iZombie, which was cute. And Walking Dead had a storyline to it until about season 6 or so when it seemed like the majority of the cast and leaders and survivors were mainly black. Lost all interest in it then. Couldn't relate.
1305604706274770944 2020-09-15 04:29:53 +0800 <NKrankie> This is men behaving like this. They think they're being virtuous but they are simply making our vaginas dry up. Grassing up your neighbours is not a manly trait.
1305604292074713092 2020-09-15 04:28:14 +0800 <NKrankie> @daveS1872 Let The Right One In was fantastic. Hollywood remake was mediocre. And I don't like zombies. Too one dimensional. All they do is eat brains and shuffle. Most boring characters ever.

1305602379170172933 2020-09-15 04:20:38 +0800 <NKrankie> @CoastalSe It wasn't a police officer who killed Cannon, it was his black neighbour was it not?
1305589636941647872 2020-09-15 03:30:00 +0800 <NKrankie> Just started watching Humans on Netflix. Really good so far.  And GLOW was fantastic. Welfare Queen was my favourite character.
1305587873270427650 2020-09-15 03:23:00 +0800 <NKrankie> They're rioting for this man just now and he stabbed four people last year. Blacks are officially idolising the criminals in their communities. Next generation of kids growing up aspiring to be murderers.    https://t.co/0M9p5NfBru

1305258744620740609 2020-09-14 05:35:09 +0800 <NKrankie> @elfpumper Well, I probably don't see girls like that. I'm half blind and everyone looks good. So don't listen to a word I say.
1305258500004642824 2020-09-14 05:34:11 +0800 <NKrankie> @mrjohnhendry John, I only had 4 options. Clearly you are option number 5 right behind Mr. Newman the Sundance Kid himself.
1305258178813267980 2020-09-14 05:32:55 +0800 <NKrankie> @elfpumper She looks like every other girl I see on the street. No idea who she is. Pretty enough though, but not special in any way.

1305248436745363456 2020-09-14 04:54:12 +0800 <NKrankie> @sanshee01 That's dreadful to hear. There's a woman and her adult son who get ridiculed near me. I try to extend kindnesses and hellos when I see them. But beyond that, there's not much more I can do other than feel bad for them and wish them well.

1305246651725107202 2020-09-14 04:47:06 +0800 <NKrankie> @sanshee01 She wants to make racial abuse more 'horrific' than any other abuse, and by doing that she simply cheapens all of our abuses.
1305244959356989440 2020-09-14 04:40:23 +0800 <NKrankie> My family had our windows put in by a Protestant neighbour. As a Catholic growing up, I too suffered abuse.

1305233719742156800 2020-09-14 03:55:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @MissFlowerPixie Yes he is. He told me in a reply that he considers Ian's life to be sacred. Now go take it up with Laurenca @LozzaFox
1305232178578628611 2020-09-14 03:49:36 +0800 <NKrankie> He's as guilty as sin but he maintains that he's innocent. His 'attack' was a replication of a rap video he made where a black man had a noose thrown over his head and was beaten. He could at least have come up with something original    https://t.co/bUcLtirauH
1305231283237392394 2020-09-14 03:46:02 +0800 <NKrankie> @seven7ins I'm sure I've seen him around Glasgow. He's part of the Argyle street druggie crew. He's in a wheelchair with two mates who push him around. He gets top benefits and therefore he's got lots of 'mates'. No idea how he qualified for benefits with no English.
1305229672028999680 2020-09-14 03:39:38 +0800 <NKrankie> Polish, living in Glasgow + disabled, spoke BARELY ANY ENGLISH, and was on the highest levels of ESA and PIP. That's a helluva lot of money for a non-Scot to be getting. Now they crowdfunding to get body home. There's a lot wrong with our benefits system   https://t.co/biMNLbePnm

1305105891415535617 2020-09-13 19:27:46 +0800 <NKrankie> As with Edinburgh, JK Rowling's poster has been removed. JK is being heralded as a champion of women. She's also a champion of refugees, and we see the rape and destruction of women under these men. It's a difficult side to choose from.

From her home-life extreme of religiosity, to her attempt to be popular by being in an inappropriate and sexualised dance group. She comes out the other end being a self accepting happy child.
1305087691785199616 2020-09-13 18:15:27 +0800 <NKrankie> @charlesadler It's not 'phobic fiction' to say that women can never be men, and men can never be women. Wake up.

1305080141996085248 2020-09-13 17:45:27 +0800 <NKrankie> FBI statistics show that more police are killed in ambush by black criminals than black men are killed by police accidentally.    https://t.co/AGzp9FfSKj
1305079759291011077 2020-09-13 17:43:56 +0800 <NKrankie> Quite interesting. Swimming pools and gyms are proposing loose floppy attire that is not figure hugging in a bid to disguise people's sex. So 'mary' can wear 'her' swimsuit whilst keeping 'her' testicles hidden.   https://t.co/vPvNyFqp5x

1304725909480574977 2020-09-12 18:17:52 +0800 <NKrankie> The sexualisation of the dance scene in CUTIES is at the same extreme as the hyper religiosity the girl endures in her home life. The ending of the movie finds the girl in a middle ground of the beginnings of a normal happy life. Extremes of anything are bad. Sex/religion

1304723335234772992 2020-09-12 18:07:38 +0800 <NKrankie> Watched Cuties. Subtitles, terribly slow pace. Young girl from religious family tries finding herself outside of family life. Journey into overly sexualized dance group takes her out the other side into being a normal child with healthy pursuits. Dance routine is WAY too sexual

1304718826995625985 2020-09-12 17:49:43 +0800 <NKrankie> @PhilanthropyGal Should 'art' be age appropriate? Cuties twerking seems to be all over easily accessed social media. When Regan from exorcist did that masturbation scene, she didn't know what she was doing. She thought she was stabbing a pillow between her legs. Those girls know they're twerking

Why this word would be thought to be in conjunction with black people is racist to me. If I say 'monkeys' why would anyone think of a black person? I don't.

It appears one of them didn't want anyone to be fighting, but it's dangerous in certain areas for white individuals to be alone with 'certain' gangs.

1300773785696645120 2020-09-01 20:33:32 +0800 <NKrankie> @lsrlinda For a small % of the population there is quite a disturbing amount of these kind of videos. I think that is what people are responding to
