1339725282752802817 2020-12-18 08:12:52 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @EllenPompeo I hope so.  When I was dying, my kids and grandkids ran through my mind all day and night.  I have no idea if I was awake or in a dreamlike state.  I knew I wasn't ready to let them go.

1339614911408779265 2020-12-18 00:54:18 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EricKleefeld @Grateful_Jerry If I remember correctly, Trump told people to vote twice and If I am hearing correctly, Rand Paul does not believe that people that do not usually vote should not vote because it might change the outcome of the election?  Seriously?

1339416966050836480 2020-12-17 11:47:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ananavarro I agree Ana.  Trump made fun of a handicapped reporter, told white supremacists to stand down and stand by and he made nicknames for anyone that didn't kiss his ass while the republicans defended him.  Your statement holds no water since you were complicit!
1339414402039209984 2020-12-17 11:37:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff I have a friend that used to sing "Back Up I Might Sit On you"  instead of "I Got My Mind Set On you".😂😅🤣

1339266450935193601 2020-12-17 01:49:38 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo As a fanwoman, starting with the first show, I have not watched one single Grey's episode that I didn't cry or laugh hysterically.  Grey's has often produced a plethora of emotions all in one episode.  I will go on, but struggle when Grey's ends.

1337505811875172353 2020-12-12 05:13:29 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @4a_of I believe that Republicans in Congress and Trump use religion as a means to get votes and do not believe in God at all, but believe their voters do.

Trump is responsible for the deaths of nearly 300,000 American citizens and more to come, not to mention the myriad of other crimes he has committed.  If Time chooses Trump, I will never pick up their magazine again.

1335986891368386562 2020-12-08 00:37:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @annaorphan1 It makes you wonder.  I use it for cooking, but still I don't buy it often.

1335986048397139969 2020-12-08 00:34:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @CanadianShell Don't do it.  Remember the smell on your clothes and what it does to your lungs.  Get up and jog or clean or something to take your mind off of it.  I fought this fight.  It's not easy, but it's worth it.

1334871472993603586 2020-12-04 22:45:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo The beach is beautiful.

1334010365617836033 2020-12-02 13:43:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @_manilabbey This was epic.  Ellen is always amazing, but this was perfect!
1334006772709912576 2020-12-02 13:29:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JessicaGirardo @abreva I get them also and only when I am getting sick. Not fun.  I hope you feel better soon.

1333854337332883457 2020-12-02 03:23:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> This from a Republican who hides behind a tweet and no name.  Where did the hatred come from?
1333853228254056453 2020-12-02 03:19:26 +0800 <SUSANJA6> How can Lindsey Graham look at himself in the mirror?  How do you stand behind a man you know committed crimes and could be convicted?  You should be ashamed of the man you have become.

1332733273353703425 2020-11-29 01:09:08 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Daveliverpool3 I agree.  They do need much more training and every police officer should have a body camera.  If they shut them off, they should be reprimanded.  If it happens again, they should be fired.  They are hired to be peacemakers, not judge and jury.
1332541508180914176 2020-11-28 12:27:07 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Inclusivity is so important for everyone in today's society.  It is how we learn about acceptance and so many different disabilities. It also lets the people with disabilities see that they are important.  Thank you to the companies involved.

1332392327399297039 2020-11-28 02:34:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @donwinslow This police officer should be fired.  This man has a right to film in public and if nothing wrong is going on, why do the police care?

1332390065310494720 2020-11-28 02:25:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @roper_93 Did he get them?  I believe Trump cheated and tried to suppress the democratic vote.  This is why he can't believe he didn't win.
1332389634601594881 2020-11-28 02:23:38 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @vicky_dollysmom So many of us are feeling the same things.  I slept 2 hours last night.  I have always spent the holidays with my children and grandchildren.  My heart ached for them yesterday, but soon we will be vaccinated and can see each other again.
1332388930482737154 2020-11-28 02:20:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @forwardarc @realDonaldTrump What Trump has done to this country, by not telling the citizens of it's threat, is tantamount to murder.  #LockHimUp
1332388444342022144 2020-11-28 02:18:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KwikWarren They voted for him a second time and are still complicit in Trump's crimes.  They are all idiots.
1332388127038709760 2020-11-28 02:17:38 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler Not to mention our Supreme Court is supposed to be there for all Americans, so they should not be able to judge anything having to do with religion.
1332387812272959488 2020-11-28 02:16:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @FrankSowa1 This should not even be an option.  Trump, in this country, has no right to deal with or blackmail the president elect.  If Trump has done nothing wrong, what does he have to worry about?

1332385076756307973 2020-11-28 02:05:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @forwardarc I agree with you.  We need a complete separation of church and state.  I do not understand why people believe it is needed in school and government.  Didn't we come here to escape religious persecution?

I have not seen my grown children and grandchildren since February and won't see them for Christmas.  I don't want them to get sick and I don't want to add to an already overwhelmed health care system.

1331767908406538241 2020-11-26 09:13:07 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @donwinslow @Yahoo He bailed a murderer out because he was not guilty of what he was accused of.  I watched the videos.  I have watched interviews.  This young man had no reason to be in Kenosha carry a gun into a crowd of protesters.
1331758963310940163 2020-11-26 08:37:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @AmyAThatcher No forgiveness forthcoming!

1331757548710604801 2020-11-26 08:31:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> She needs sent home.  She came into this country on a lie!  She is clearly not a genius!

1331713900803461122 2020-11-26 05:38:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @AndBrazen I love Christmas and watching all of my grandchildren play together. This year I will be missing that so it doesn't seem like Christmas at all.

1331453803976159233 2020-11-25 12:24:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @CREWcrew @MrJonCryer Wouldn't it be nice if we could just throw out enough ballots for Trump to win?  What an idiot.  What are you hiding Lindsey or have you become this greedy?
1331452295465361410 2020-11-25 12:18:59 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @gallee50 Me too!
1331452161201496065 2020-11-25 12:18:27 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @GreysABC Such an epic couple.  I can't wait to see what is coming next.  I know Derek loves Meredith enough to know that it is not her time to die.  He will be waiting for her when it is.
1331450804939714562 2020-11-25 12:13:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @AOC19691 One can hope!

1331408084330278912 2020-11-25 09:23:18 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @CRlSTlNAYANG Christina was definitely her own person.  She was out for herself, but didn't care if others were also.  She was a force.
1331361976853925889 2020-11-25 06:20:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Exactly!

1330991357930958850 2020-11-24 05:47:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Jade55375071 Thank you.

1330989754599567362 2020-11-24 05:41:00 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @mmpadellan Excellent choice.

1330163821638524930 2020-11-21 22:59:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @CherryDank Your puppies are quite active this morning!  😁
1330161722171285506 2020-11-21 22:50:42 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I watched 20/20 last night.  I was so saddened by the world today and things that are going on.  This morning, I have had to block 3 Trump trolls.  I think my day has no where to go but up!😁
1330160469634584579 2020-11-21 22:45:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @hanc7iwentto @Ticked2020 @denisew16755374 @DonaldJTrumpJr Sorry, I should have been more clear.  Jobs were on the rise when Obama left office.  Man I am sick of smart asses this morning!
1330150229706936320 2020-11-21 22:05:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Sorry everyone.  I was being DM'd by this idiot and I was tired of it. I took a deep breath and blocked him.
1330149197446852612 2020-11-21 22:00:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam The video also clearly states no evidence could be found that the man he shot was a pedophile.
1330148897814175744 2020-11-21 21:59:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam You are a total idiot.  This video shows exactly what I said.  He fancied himself a vigilante and he was going to save Kenosha.  He was clearly the aggressor for walking around with a gun strapped to his chest waiting to fire.  He had no business being in Kenosha.
1330146642532720644 2020-11-21 21:50:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam Oh, and I bet you hide behind a gun to protect yourself too.
1330146335815847937 2020-11-21 21:49:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam Is 'wrong' the best you have?  Show me evidence.  Show me your video.  I have watched them.
1330145876656988164 2020-11-21 21:47:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam Quit hiding behind your fake name and tell me where you got your information.  Were you there?  Were your part of it?
1330144962088996865 2020-11-21 21:44:06 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam Actually, you need to stop spreading misinformation and read.  Stop defending a cold blooded killer.
1330144759558639617 2020-11-21 21:43:18 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam He was not shot at first.  Where are you getting your information or are you making it up as you go.
1330144446432894978 2020-11-21 21:42:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam He was not old enough to possess or carry the gun.  Having a permit is a mute point.
1330144162780508171 2020-11-21 21:40:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam Police requested firefighters come to the station for a medical check of Rittenhouse, who had small scratches on his arm but no bruising or cuts.  He was not defending himself.
1330143419608469506 2020-11-21 21:37:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam The assault-style rifle used in the shooting was purchased by an 18-year-old friend of Rittenhouse, and police found it in the trunk of the friend's car later that morning. Neither Rittenhouse nor his mother had a permit for a gun in Illinois.
1330142989436547073 2020-11-21 21:36:16 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam 'I shot two white kids': New records detail Kyle Rittenhouse's surrender to hometown cops, path of AR-15 rifle used in Kenosha. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
1330142660523331585 2020-11-21 21:34:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam This time you are wrong. Rittenhouse told officers he had been hired to protect a business in Kenosha and had to protect himself. The owner of the business, Car Source, has told the Journal Sentinel that he did not hire anyone to act as armed security.
1330140085271072769 2020-11-21 21:24:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam I stand corrected.  It was an assault style rifle. This 17 year old had a friend purchase a gun that he was going to use to kill someone.  He had no reason or right being in Kenosha that night.  Besides, you make your statements hiding behind a fake name.
1330136190067085321 2020-11-21 21:09:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Shadowwolf240 @jeverage713 @ksandnfam No, he just walked into a protest with an AR15 strapped to his chest and shot 2 people dead and many others were left with injuries as they tried to stop him.  He went there with a purpose.  It was not only murder.  It was premeditated.
1330134889937723395 2020-11-21 21:04:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @hanc7iwentto @Ticked2020 @denisew16755374 @DonaldJTrumpJr Lowest unemployment?  It was on the rise when Obama left office.  Now it's in the toilet for lack of leadership during a global pandemic.  Greatest economy?  Is that why families have both parents out working and still not making enough money to make ends meet?
1329994364471349248 2020-11-21 11:45:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @cher I agree!
1329993924350455808 2020-11-21 11:43:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @rssanch86 I am sick to my stomach at all of the injustice and hatred going on in our country today and for so many years.😢
1329993670309933062 2020-11-21 11:42:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @GreysMedical It's good to see something positive in all of the negative around us.  Thank you for knowing when!

You can tell they truly care for each other.  I'm not sure why, but I love that they are talking again.  Friends are too important to lose.
1329666668461748224 2020-11-20 14:03:32 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @pickdempeo I loved this scene... I laughed so hard and then I cried.  Two of the greatest actors on television!

He needs to be held responsible for what he has done.  His cronies need to be held responsible for letting it happen.  I am so glad we are rid of him!

1328393781159325703 2020-11-17 01:45:32 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden I think it’s time to invoke the 25th Amendment!

1328390966508711937 2020-11-17 01:34:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @LuciaRendn4 Seriously?  You think using fowl language and parading around carrying a gun makes you masculine?  Wow, you have a lot to learn!

1328163184600080387 2020-11-16 10:29:13 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @mmpadellan Why do they need to be pardoned?  Don't you have to be convicted of something?
1328162925861875712 2020-11-16 10:28:12 +0800 <SUSANJA6> These idiots aren't violent?
1328162609531645955 2020-11-16 10:26:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @reedgalen @CountryOverPar5 @ABC Agreed!  It is clear to me that these people choose not to educate themselves with anything other than the rhetoric Trump and his minions are spewing.  Did you put them on the air so that we can see how ignorant they are?
1328158854425825288 2020-11-16 10:12:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @blampayomi @greyspostit To marry the person she truly loves.
1328115914152292353 2020-11-16 07:21:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @CloydWilliams @mikepompeo I agree.  Mike Pompeo cares about no one but himself.  I wonder how long it took him to look up this scripture before his post.  This man would be struck down with a lightening bolt if he walked into a church.
1328115437175975942 2020-11-16 07:19:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @bettyisdrunk @GOP Hilary is an amazing woman and would have made an amazing president.  I hope that she can do something about these people.

1328055959294500869 2020-11-16 03:23:09 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @AllisonRisseeuw Thank you for what you do.  You are so very important in the fight against COVID.  My wish is that everyone would read this and acknowledge what you are doing as heroic and realize no one should have to risk their life to save someone when it could be avoided.  Wear your mask!
1328052758201692163 2020-11-16 03:10:26 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @lilyzamu @greyspostit Selfishly, I would like to see all the loose ends tied up before it ends, like Private Practice.  If they can do that and end it this year it would be fine.  Meredith being the main character, showing so much growth, deserves a happy ending.

1327713487053852673 2020-11-15 04:42:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Sadly, I won't be putting one up.  My husband hates Christmas, my Mom doesn't care about a tree and I don't get to see my kids and grandkids due to COVID.  It's getting more difficult every day to celebrate. Ba Humbug!
1327712611874574338 2020-11-15 04:38:49 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall I agree!
1327698322786832385 2020-11-15 03:42:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit No way.  I've been watching for 17 years.  I don't want it to end.  A happily ever after doesn't end with someone dying.

1326881987639074818 2020-11-12 21:38:12 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @jeverage713 I think, right at this time, we don't have a choice but to mandate masks.  I always wear mine, but most, where I live, do not.  Positive cases are at there highest.  I live in a town with under 200 people and there are cases on both sides of me.

1326515352625422336 2020-11-11 21:21:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I can't fathom a reason that anyone would vote for McConnell or Graham.  These men have derailed our democracy a tyrannical way for the past 4 years.  I would like to think that the citizens of those 2 states could see that.

1326357980976132096 2020-11-11 10:55:59 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Biden was very presidential today.  Something we have not seen in a very long time.  I do hope Trump can summons up a tiny bit of decency and concede.

1326286859199258626 2020-11-11 06:13:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> There is a reason the GOP fears conceding the election.  What are they hiding?

1322940300747284480 2020-11-02 00:35:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @merdemill @roper_93 You are correct!
1322940206203502595 2020-11-02 00:34:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @roper_93 I am beside myself with the thought of no one being prosecuted in either of these incidences!
1322938961476653056 2020-11-02 00:30:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> You are 100% correct!  Trump has changed our country it's people in ways I would never have thought could happen.  He is a racist and if you support him you are a racist too!  Please get out and vote to win our country back!
1322929453845143558 2020-11-01 23:52:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Fauci was correct!
1322927659454734337 2020-11-01 23:45:07 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Rosie I agree with this 100%.  I have lost respect for so many people I thought were my friends.  I have seen a side of them that I can't live with.  I can't be complicit!
1322927057060483085 2020-11-01 23:42:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BRUTAL5665 So sorry for your loss.

1322925940922613760 2020-11-01 23:38:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TheRealKMcKidd I was horrified by what happened yesterday in Texas, but more horrified by the fact that nothing has been done about it.  No one has been charged.  I hope others are as outraged as I am!  #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare
1322924619913957376 2020-11-01 23:33:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> What happened yesterday in Texas has no place in these United States.  It was an act of domestic terrorism.      If you agree, you are complicit.  Trump laughed about it at his rally!  His followers also laughed.  Trump and his followers are dangerous!
1322923103287214082 2020-11-01 23:27:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @bettyisdrunk I blocked Trump.  I am tired of the hate.  I am tired of the lies.  I am tired of the corruption.  You can't be anti-racist and back a clear racist!

1322919216048209921 2020-11-01 23:11:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TheRealKMcKidd @realDonaldTrump Being anti-racist, if you don't say no to racism you are a racist.
1322918217971621888 2020-11-01 23:07:36 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Trump laughed at what happened at his rally.  He continued on to blame the bus driver saying the cars were just going down the road.  Trump is dangerous and complicit in this!  He, along with the drivers of the cars, are all guilty of a terrorist act!
1322779982754623491 2020-11-01 13:58:18 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KeithOlbermann @TarynKe12167652 @realDonaldTrump What I saw on this video was criminal.  Armed with license plate numbers, the police should be arresting the drivers of these vehicles.  What if anything are they doing?
1322778887064084480 2020-11-01 13:53:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Joyceproudyaya He lies about the incident and his minions cheer him on.  What is going to happen if he gets back in, or better yet what will happen if he loses?  #TrumpsTerrorists #VoteBlueToEndTheNightmare #LockHimUp

1322750448038760450 2020-11-01 12:00:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @MiaDM18 @realDonaldTrump You are correct!  Trump has divided our country like no president before him.  Biden is correct when he says we are in a fight for our country's soul!  #VOTE

1322705836603547648 2020-11-01 09:03:40 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Watching from the outside it appears that Trump has something on Lindsey.  Since Trump took office Lindsey has become unrecognizable.  I once thought he had a soul, but it appears he sold it to the devil!

Biden is an active Catholic and goes to church.  2nd amendment rights, Biden believes in owning guns, but wants to limit magazines.  Freedom of choice in the election yes, but apparently you don't believe in women having rights over their own body

1322219595160297473 2020-10-31 00:51:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Trump has resorted to two word tweets today.  According to children's books he has progressed to the age of 2.
1322218971488276481 2020-10-31 00:49:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler How in the hell has Trump gotten away with using the theory that if we didn't do so much testing we would have far fewer cases of COVID?

1322047494314991616 2020-10-30 13:27:39 +0800 <SUSANJA6> That's not Melania....what the hell.  I am sure Trump is paying Melania a whole lot of money to stay with him until he is voted out.  There seems to be no love loss there.

1321568349994819587 2020-10-29 05:43:42 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @fred_guttenberg Your books sounds like a must read in today's climate.  I voted for Biden!

1320568852611272707 2020-10-26 11:32:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @bettyisdrunk What boggles my mind is that someone actually believes that Trump represents family, religion and hard work!
1320568533156286464 2020-10-26 11:30:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyAnnReid I have read quite a few comments about how horrible  Trump was treated in this interview and how 60 minutes treated Joe Biden with kid gloves.  The questions asked of Trump were about facts.  He is a child!
1320567876500312065 2020-10-26 11:28:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @sunny @NorahODonnell What the heck was that question. I do not blame Kamala Harris for laughing.

1320533202424004611 2020-10-26 09:10:24 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TMZ This police officer should be fired.  They are not paid to push any candidate on the citizens.

1319644156730499072 2020-10-23 22:17:39 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @juneAmbrose Because, Trump is a racist.  He has aligned himself with other racists.  He wouldn't want to alienate them.
1319643364850061318 2020-10-23 22:14:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @juneAmbrose Trump is a racist.  His cronies are racists.  His followers are racists.  He needs to go!  There is no place in our country for  anyone that sees less than all men are created equal!

1318014898996117505 2020-10-19 10:23:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @bonkrzz1018 Congratulation and Happy Birthday!

1317897052467191811 2020-10-19 02:35:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @RealEricDane It's funny how much Trump mirrors Hitler.  I wonder, if Hitler were around, would he have been friend with Epstein?
1317896719112282112 2020-10-19 02:33:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EdgePointLegend Congratulations!
1317896608122589187 2020-10-19 02:33:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump This tactic is old and tired.  Move on!
1317896236599562242 2020-10-19 02:32:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @american2084 Straight Blue! 👍
1317669949284941824 2020-10-18 11:32:51 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @GovWhitmer @sunny Instead of running for what you are going to do, you tell lies about all of the things your opponent will do.  Why can't you just state your platform?
1317669362061463554 2020-10-18 11:30:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NDLB2020 @joncoopertweets I often wonder how much they pay Melania to stay with Trump until his reign of terror is over!
1317668789811580929 2020-10-18 11:28:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler He laughs and they laugh.  They don't take it seriously unless it's someone in their own family.
1317668269839536129 2020-10-18 11:26:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @AdyBarkan @joncoopertweets Lindsey use to be bipartisan.  Not any more!
1317667688286724096 2020-10-18 11:23:52 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @effiedog We are behind you Amy!
1317667474918309890 2020-10-18 11:23:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @GiacomoKG Agreed!  I lived in the pre-COVID era!  Ahhh, I remember it well!
1317615966839328770 2020-10-18 07:58:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @sethanikeem @joncoopertweets This should not be allowed!

1317614895773470720 2020-10-18 07:54:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @GreenfieldIowa I so hope you do!
1317614746309447681 2020-10-18 07:53:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Back_dafucup We took ours to our circuit clerk's office.
1317614506617507840 2020-10-18 07:52:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @SpockResists Exactly!
1317593232377843712 2020-10-18 06:28:00 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @gtconway3d Trump!  Again with the lies!  Will you ever stand on your own platform?
1317592686581276672 2020-10-18 06:25:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @UncleSnotty I have heard so much about these burgers I would like to try one!
1317550162206773248 2020-10-18 03:36:52 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump The thing I dislike most about you is that when you talk and call people names you remind me of every school yard bully I have ever met.
1317549117258780674 2020-10-18 03:32:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @kirstiealley Wow!
1317548503845998592 2020-10-18 03:30:16 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @stadiumtalkcom I like both Boston and the Cubs!
1317547928265818118 2020-10-18 03:27:59 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @lanerodrigs1979 Good times!   33's and 45's.... I had so many of them.
1317547596441931778 2020-10-18 03:26:40 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I have the same problem.  With the exception of one neighbor, I am the only democrat in the area.  I am amazed at the people I know that like Trump and defend him.  I can't wait for things to get back to (relatively) normal!
1317547154735595521 2020-10-18 03:24:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Rosie And this is the man that so many people back... I do not understand!
1317546578228424705 2020-10-18 03:22:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @DoYouEvenLif @Rosie I agree.  The timeline makes no sense!
1317546456027455490 2020-10-18 03:22:08 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump I can't wait until I don't ever have to listen to you again!

1317500588884692996 2020-10-18 00:19:53 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Do you ever tell the truth?
1317492150066647040 2020-10-17 23:46:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shelli_resists We can only hope this is true, but I feel bad for Canada!

1317490558353461251 2020-10-17 23:40:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump Hopefully he will be reading it in the news from far, far away!

1317483409661480960 2020-10-17 23:11:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I get it every year and have no problem with it.  I also do not get sick when others around me have the flu.

1317208738835714051 2020-10-17 05:00:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @donwinslow @TheRealKMcKidd Exactly.  I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  As he did with Hillary, he will come up with something.
1317208015909670913 2020-10-17 04:57:18 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @EllenPompeo Vote then have a 30 second dance party like @EllenPompeo !
1317207699122229248 2020-10-17 04:56:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Don't ever back down!  Trump has attacked everyone that has opposed him in the last few years and before.  He gets what he deserves!

1316198768904146947 2020-10-14 10:06:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @SenKamalaHarris This has to be stopped.  We need the Affordable Care Act!  Trump did an incredible amount of damage when he wouldn't open up enrollment when so many people lost their jobs and their insurance due to COVID.  We must stop him from destroying the Affordable Care Act!
1316197517562990598 2020-10-14 10:01:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @UncleSnotty @wecallonall I felt like I was living in another country because these things don't happen here.  This is what Trump has done to our country and it's people.

1316165368319275008 2020-10-14 07:54:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Why have this at all?  She is not allowed to answer any question.  The thing it does show is she is exactly like the Republicans in power.

1314622087257042944 2020-10-10 01:41:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @fred_guttenberg I have not taken my eye off the ball, but I am still wondering if Trump had COVID at all.
1314621038018396164 2020-10-10 01:37:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> He really said this and he is in charge?  I know we have almost hit rock bottom!  Vote him out!
1314602037015965696 2020-10-10 00:22:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TMZ If he hadn't committed this crime he would have, most likely, been part of the murder plot in Michigan.  He deserves life in prison.
1314601581933981702 2020-10-10 00:20:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @joncoopertweets Please remember this when you vote!

1314601010694889472 2020-10-10 00:17:59 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Amy_Siskind @NancySinatra One can only hope!  Get out and vote blue!

1314586544334921730 2020-10-09 23:20:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @KLGLASS2 Well said! 😢
1314572962981441536 2020-10-09 22:26:32 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @SenSchumer @wecallonall Trump would not allow open enrollment in the market place after millions lost their insurance.  My son was denied insurance due to a pre-existing condition.  One panic attack after a friend killed himself does not make a pre-existing condition.  Save our health care!
1314571424003239938 2020-10-09 22:20:25 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Jet1Jack We saw it in his eyes during the debate.
1314571092321861639 2020-10-09 22:19:06 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @chelseahandler It would have been a sad day if he had!
1314414344239751176 2020-10-09 11:56:14 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Jersey_Craig @joncoopertweets Walk with your head up.  Speak your mind.  Make sure you are heard.  Kamala Harris is the best choice for VP.  Intelligence and confidence do not elude her.  She is a confident and powerful woman.  Trump and Pence are afraid of her.
1314413215506468865 2020-10-09 11:51:45 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @THR This is just sad.
1314412708863803393 2020-10-09 11:49:45 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @kylegriffin1 @joncoopertweets Trump is now and has always been a racist.  He appeared to have given orders for his followers to 'liberate Michigan'.  Sounds like a rally cry to me!
1314411209194713088 2020-10-09 11:43:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JamesCarville @janemarielynch It's is easy.  All democrats go out and vote.  We need to get this lunatic out of office!
1314410753382846464 2020-10-09 11:41:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @joncoopertweets I hope she succeeds.  Trump is acting more crazy than usual and should not be leading this country!
1314409700092502016 2020-10-09 11:37:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump None of these things are true.
1314409515798986752 2020-10-09 11:37:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @joncoopertweets @kanyewest Yes, at first I laughed at the idea.  Now it's just sad.

1314356377792454660 2020-10-09 08:05:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @fred_guttenberg He has COVID!
1314297168803569673 2020-10-09 04:10:38 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Why is it Trump can host a virtual rally, but won't agree to a virtual debate?
1314295988132212738 2020-10-09 04:05:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shondaland You do wonderful things for so many.  Thank you!
1314261383165489152 2020-10-09 01:48:26 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Merderstans1 Knowing that there will be ups and downs.  Knowing you won't always like each other.  Knowing that no matter what, no one runs.  These are all things that make a good relationship.
1314259916220174337 2020-10-09 01:42:36 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Variety I can't wait for the new season.  This year Ellen Pompeo will win her Emmy!
1314258904038154240 2020-10-09 01:38:35 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @PatrickDempsey I loved it.  I can't wait for next week.
1314055622648713216 2020-10-08 12:10:49 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Congratulations!
1314048896608464896 2020-10-08 11:44:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @MMFlint Do you think he pops his hair off at night and snaps it back on in the morning?
1314047705086341121 2020-10-08 11:39:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BerniceKing @KellyMcCreary Fight to be heard!

1314040329029513221 2020-10-08 11:10:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Keep saying it and maybe someone will believe you!

1314031497586905088 2020-10-08 10:34:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo If Trump is elected again, women will lose those rights yet no one where I live wears a mask.  We all have to get out and vote blue for the sake of our country.
1314030930697351168 2020-10-08 10:32:42 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo He has been rotting for a long time.  He is a narcissist, a sexist, a racist and he is against the lgbtq community.  He has his head up the giant peaches butt!

1314023171511726080 2020-10-08 10:01:52 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Good for Susan.  Make Pence follow the rules!
1314022877528838144 2020-10-08 10:00:42 +0800 <SUSANJA6> This is so true.  He is bent on getting rid of and destroying anything connected to Obama.

1314022208700809217 2020-10-08 09:58:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @iJesseWilliams @KamalaHarris She is so much more intelligent than Pence and actually answers the questions asked.
1314019269810814978 2020-10-08 09:46:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ABC @TheView The fact checker determined this was a lie!
1314018466232520704 2020-10-08 09:43:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> You are so right.  He is as sick as Trump.  He lies with a straight face.
1314016655324917760 2020-10-08 09:35:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyAnnReid From the start of covid, one of the first symptoms can be pink eye!
1314016418405535745 2020-10-08 09:35:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Why don't they tell him to shut up?
1314015400087224321 2020-10-08 09:30:59 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shondarhimes He has not given one straight answer yet.  He skirts around everything.  He also has shifty eyes!
1314015222689079296 2020-10-08 09:30:16 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I think you made the best choice.  Kamala Harris is a smart, strong woman!

1314012346109644801 2020-10-08 09:18:51 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @kerrywashington A great, powerful, strong woman!
1314012236395024385 2020-10-08 09:18:24 +0800 <SUSANJA6> 17 minutes into the debate and Pence is already avoiding answering questions!
1313979213272231936 2020-10-08 07:07:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JillFilipovic Trump's hands look blue!

1313555125819133952 2020-10-07 03:02:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @sazzygram3 @wecallonall And the republican's strike down stem cell therapy over and over!  Hypocrite!
1313554914212274178 2020-10-07 03:01:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @MrsRabbitResist @wecallonall I try it every day.  No results!
1313494831247831041 2020-10-06 23:02:25 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @DanRather @wecallonall So painfully true!
1313494487826599942 2020-10-06 23:01:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @zachjcarter @wecallonall Lets hope this ends with Trump's presidency!

1313491857440223232 2020-10-06 22:50:36 +0800 <SUSANJA6> You are an amazing young woman.  Keep doing what you do.  You are an inspiration!  Happy Birthday!
1313304280540098561 2020-10-06 10:25:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @soledadobrien @EllenPompeo One of the most disgraceful thing I have seen so far.  Over 200,000 people have died and they are making fun of it.
1313293627997720577 2020-10-06 09:42:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TheRealKMcKidd I agree.  Having a compromised immune system puts me in the high risk category.  Where I live no one wears a mask.  I have been home since last February!
1313279418161344519 2020-10-06 08:46:27 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden I wish more people did.  I have a compromised immune system and people where I live do not wear them.
1313279168675635201 2020-10-06 08:45:28 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Hilarious! 👇
1313278636808691713 2020-10-06 08:43:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden You are correct!  I hope Trump listens to his doctors because he did not look good tonight!
1313278383502041088 2020-10-06 08:42:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @mattgaetz That's because you are as big and asshole as Trump is!
1313277808509104128 2020-10-06 08:40:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @robreiner You are right.  A man without a thought for anyone but himself!
1313277549745758208 2020-10-06 08:39:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @matthewjdowd I am at least a 10.  He took his mask off.  What the hell was he thinking.  Also, his comments about the virus itself were dangerous and careless.  What is wrong with him?
1313266824449011717 2020-10-06 07:56:24 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @fred_guttenberg Try living in Missouri and see what the people near me think it is!  It's scary!

1313264801779507200 2020-10-06 07:48:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TheRealKMcKidd @realDonaldTrump They caked his makeup on and he looks like he is breathing a bit hard.
1313199860225650692 2020-10-06 03:30:19 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JerasIkehorn @GiovSalv Should we be surprised?
1313199584970190849 2020-10-06 03:29:13 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JamesKosur Liar!
1313199242668920832 2020-10-06 03:27:52 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Once again, after what might have been a case of COVID, Trump tells the people not to be afraid of it.  Don't let it run your life.  What the hell?
1313198861561757696 2020-10-06 03:26:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @msdebbieallen @GreysABC Meredith has become independent and is a great mother.  I would like to see her find a great love again.  Also, I would like to see Catherine and Richard back together again.

1313154338559266823 2020-10-06 00:29:26 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump If pre-existing conditions are protected, why did my son get turned down for insurance after he lost his job due to COVID?  You refused to open up the market place.
1313153923075772418 2020-10-06 00:27:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff I'm not sure which photo op was worse.  The tear gassing of peaceful protesters or this!
1313153429842386944 2020-10-06 00:25:49 +0800 <SUSANJA6> There is nothing this man won't do to feed his ego.  I am so sorry about your father.  This didn't have to happen!

1313151031602294788 2020-10-06 00:16:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @janemarielynch Trump is also obese.  I wonder how he has made it, but then again, did he really have it?
1313150751888355329 2020-10-06 00:15:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I wonder every day how anyone can follow this man.
1313150357158146050 2020-10-06 00:13:36 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @CalifMamaBear Yes, I have next to no immune system and no one wears a mask where I live.

1313149431307526146 2020-10-06 00:09:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NancySinatra Trump driving by the crowds outside the hospital was unbelievable.  Also, it makes me wonder if he had COVID-19 at all!
1313148811917889536 2020-10-06 00:07:28 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff I would love to be in Los Feliz right now watching GA being filmed! @EllenPompeo
1312878679878496266 2020-10-05 06:14:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar Do we even know if he is really sick?  I am not so sure anymore.
1312869415432658946 2020-10-05 05:37:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @msdebbieallen @TVOne You are a great roll model for women and young girls. Keep doing what you do.  You are great!

1312762631611125761 2020-10-04 22:32:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NancySinatra And Trump is getting the best care in the U.S., but has very mild symptoms!

1312599204985012224 2020-10-04 11:43:32 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @megpillow @wecallonall We have been Trump's victims since 2016.  There is no sympathy to be had.

1312530346164936704 2020-10-04 07:09:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump What about the 214,000 that have already died from COVID?
1312519043589447681 2020-10-04 06:25:00 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NancySinatra Looking forward to it!
1312485759111229440 2020-10-04 04:12:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JRubinBlogger They arrested people who knowingly exposed partners to aids.  Isn't this the same thing?
1312397556970909699 2020-10-03 22:22:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ClydeHaberman @wecallonall How is it that so many people forget the horrible things Trump did even before he was elected?
1312397049489432579 2020-10-03 22:20:14 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @ConManDon3 I agree.  I am tired of hearing 'the radical left'!
1312389047004917763 2020-10-03 21:48:26 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Wiseronenow @wecallonall Correct me if I am wrong, but when AIDS began, if someone was infected and knowingly slept with someone, they could be charged with a crime.  What is the difference here?
1312243048739409921 2020-10-03 12:08:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Don't let up now.  Keep spreading your message. Trump is as dangerous as the virus he ignored that killed over 200,000 Americans.
1312242519795798017 2020-10-03 12:06:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I'm sitting here at home watching highlights from our area's high school football team.  Crowds of kids and adults, players and officials and not a single mask to be seen.  How will this ever end?
1312241034789900288 2020-10-03 12:00:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> So do I!
1312240690278080512 2020-10-03 11:58:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Remember this?  I really don't care, do you?  https://t.co/3p21ma6Tc5
1312222262477623297 2020-10-03 10:45:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> KellyAnne Conway tested positive for COVID.  Who will be next?

1312200927621775361 2020-10-03 09:20:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @_ReaalAmerican_ @realDonaldTrump Is he really sick or will he come back in two weeks and say it was no worse than any other flu?
1312200655084298241 2020-10-03 09:19:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @donwinslow @wecallonall We won't know how it went unless he dies.  Fox will never tell the truth.

1312199984691867648 2020-10-03 09:17:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @pdazzleliscious @Rosie One of my biggest fears!
1312199770518163459 2020-10-03 09:16:19 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @femconfessional I am safe.  I think I am sane, but I feel a little more jovial than I think I should today considering!
1312199266358575105 2020-10-03 09:14:19 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @EllenPompeo Still beautiful after 16 years!
1312193458887520257 2020-10-03 08:51:14 +0800 <SUSANJA6> It doesn't matter to Trump how far he has to go to push his agenda.  Even if it kills someone.
1312192364916531200 2020-10-03 08:46:53 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @LSTrip44 @wecallonall I amazed that people expected more out of him.
1312191657970868226 2020-10-03 08:44:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @kbeninato I don't often wish a virus on anyone, but there is a part of me that........

1312177953946492931 2020-10-03 07:49:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @7im @KristaVernoff And this was ok with his minions!
1312177657375670272 2020-10-03 07:48:27 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @johnnymac2220 @wecallonall I am not hearing anything from the Republican side.  Makes you wonder!
1312147551072575488 2020-10-03 05:48:49 +0800 <SUSANJA6> No sympathy here.  Everything Trump has done in the last few years has been to feed his ego and line his pockets!
1312146327560622080 2020-10-03 05:43:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @marketman52 Correct!  Contracting what he called a fake disease that 200,000+ people have died from seems like Karma.  I don't want to see him die, but hearing him admit he made a mistake would be good!
1312144258753728512 2020-10-03 05:35:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ScenarioLENS @wecallonall Did he know then?  Was he trying to infect the enemy?  Will we ever truly know?
1312143748801851393 2020-10-03 05:33:42 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Ky_Gill28 @wecallonall That has to smart!  His! ego is probably quite bruised by now.
1312143302230077440 2020-10-03 05:31:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar Agreed.  Why the trip to the hospital if his symptoms are mild?

1311873623934808066 2020-10-02 11:40:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Trump, nor his mouthpiece, will still not denounce white supremacy!

1311474709809238017 2020-10-01 09:15:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @J_Mei21 @wecallonall I think last night should have helped undecideds decide!
1311474227489525760 2020-10-01 09:13:16 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @mama_c2 @wecallonall Love them!
1311473388435759105 2020-10-01 09:09:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BerniceKing @wecallonall Once again, today, he refused to denounce white supremacy!  When he asked the Proud Boys to stand by he almost seemed to be their leader!
1311291509359153158 2020-09-30 21:07:13 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @violadavis Yes, please vote!
1311163910360309760 2020-09-30 12:40:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @michaelgmiller @wecallonall Does he know how to tell the truth?
1311155729961754627 2020-09-30 12:07:40 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @mostra4u @GiovSalv @BregmanPs @oliverdarcy He is getting them ready for his loss!
1311155425321025540 2020-09-30 12:06:28 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @matthewjdowd @wecallonall @ABC He is an embarrassment.  He could not denounce whit supremacy!
1311155150103425025 2020-09-30 12:05:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @SpiroAgnewGhost I hope so.  I could not believe what I heard!
1311154590604308480 2020-09-30 12:03:09 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @DefNotDorothy Biden did great!  He kept his cool for the most part.  I may not have been able to.  Positive vibes!
1311143872802762753 2020-09-30 11:20:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NancySinatra I couldn’t believe what I heard!
1311132150809481216 2020-09-30 10:33:59 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @THR So sad.  Helen Reddy was an amazing singer!
1311131860018266113 2020-09-30 10:32:49 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump You refused to condemn white supremacy!
1311130887413784581 2020-09-30 10:28:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @sunny He is a dangerous racist!
1311130705984921607 2020-09-30 10:28:14 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @RVAwonk @GiovSalv He is a racist through and through!
1311130575575678976 2020-09-30 10:27:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Wolfiesmom You’re too kind.
1311130474656534529 2020-09-30 10:27:19 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TimAlberta @gtconway3d I agree.
1311129945150816257 2020-09-30 10:25:13 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @MaryLTrump @gtconway3d That’s what he’s best at!
1311129109792251904 2020-09-30 10:21:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Wrong.  Trump would not shut up long enough to let him speak!
1311128482357932033 2020-09-30 10:19:24 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff It is terrifying!  I am saddened to think this is the world we are leaving our children.
1311127904441503745 2020-09-30 10:17:06 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ACLU @kerrywashington Black Lives Matter!
1311127768961294337 2020-09-30 10:16:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JohnBrennan @GiovSalv Don’t forget his narcissistic tendencies and his inability to call off white supremacy!
1311124558259408898 2020-09-30 10:03:48 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Go Joe!
1311124269468966913 2020-09-30 10:02:40 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @AOC Exactly!
1311123914173579264 2020-09-30 10:01:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff I agree!
1311122587087441924 2020-09-30 09:55:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar I’m stupid according to Trump!
1311122467239407617 2020-09-30 09:55:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff I thought about, but Trump would say Biden forfeited!
1311120213400858624 2020-09-30 09:46:32 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KamalaHarris @GiovSalv Of course he has no plan.  It is stapled to the tax return he is going to show us!
1311119209066266625 2020-09-30 09:42:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Chris Wallace, why is Trump still talking?  Shut him up!
1311118911639875584 2020-09-30 09:41:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @johncusack @GiovSalv @Acyn I’ve been saying that since the debate began!
1311118084221140992 2020-09-30 09:38:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @HKrassenstein @GiovSalv I agree!
1311117995775864832 2020-09-30 09:37:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler I agree.  At one point Wallace was debating Biden!
1311117848513859584 2020-09-30 09:37:09 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden He has to be stopped!
1311117381582893057 2020-09-30 09:35:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @janemarielynch Brutal isn’t strong enough a word!
1311117264788353024 2020-09-30 09:34:49 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TheDailyEdge @GiovSalv This debate is the biggest joke of the year.  Chris Wallace is clearly allowing Trump to talk far too long and debating with Biden!  Biden is keeping his cool.  He is beating Trump all over the place.
1311098233217855488 2020-09-30 08:19:12 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @matthewjdowd @GiovSalv So true.  There is a lot to be said for having morals.
1311096114523893761 2020-09-30 08:10:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @maeandannsma @AOC It’s fine to question spending, but make sure you ask both sides.
1310762591824891906 2020-09-29 10:05:29 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JewadAnsar @charliekirk11 He could give his salary 10 times over and it wouldn't equal the amount the tax payers have spent on his golf outings, secret service for his kids and all the KFC he eats at the White House!
1310753581914566657 2020-09-29 09:29:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BerniceKing People like Kyle Rittenhouse has no idea what being Christian means.
1310752764885192706 2020-09-29 09:26:26 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Jannie_lovesUSA @Wolfiesmom Sarcasm or do you really believe that?
1310752567354425344 2020-09-29 09:25:39 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler I can always count on you to make me laugh!
1310720094943797249 2020-09-29 07:16:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Bye, bye Donnie!

1310713734176944141 2020-09-29 06:51:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler Hilarious!
1310673141765726209 2020-09-29 04:10:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> How is it that the FOP is endorsing one the the biggest criminals in the U.S.?
1310652913182806018 2020-09-29 02:49:39 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Now say it's fake news!
1310644316197527554 2020-09-29 02:15:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo We all need to hear about it!  It can't be shown enough!
1310610167353008128 2020-09-28 23:59:48 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden @GiovSalv I agree!
1310609977657131013 2020-09-28 23:59:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> So do I understand this correctly?  I am retired and pay over $10,000 in taxes a year and it shouldn't bother me that a self-proclaimed millionaire pays $750?

1310585635946795009 2020-09-28 22:22:19 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Obama care is so important.  We need to stop Trump before it's too late.  The lives of our most vulnerable are at stake!

1310396512829136897 2020-09-28 09:50:49 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @kashanacauley @KristaVernoff Exactly!
1310393924746440708 2020-09-28 09:40:32 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @RBReich @wecallonall Once again I am stunned at the things this man has been able to do.
1310393559284154370 2020-09-28 09:39:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Exactly!

1310391025848979468 2020-09-28 09:29:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall Say it again Joe!
1310390820764356609 2020-09-28 09:28:12 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I agree.  How can anyone support a racist, sexist, narcissist?
1310390138703433728 2020-09-28 09:25:29 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @jankybrain We can only hope that 'Teflon Don' will finally be gone!

1310386561331138560 2020-09-28 09:11:16 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @xellenpompeox One of the scenes that hooked me 17 years ago!
1310384506164125696 2020-09-28 09:03:06 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @NEWMERICA92 I would pay to see him be arrested and drug off kicking and screaming!
1310384028550418435 2020-09-28 09:01:12 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @madistvobsessed Dr. McDreamy, that's what I call Patrick's character. He's gorgeous, he's got a great body and he's got damn fine hair.
1310254815159742464 2020-09-28 00:27:45 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I am extremely bothered by the fact that any of this has to go on in our country.  I agree with a psychological evaluation for Trump as he has shown many signs of having a problem, but drug tests?
1310242001200312321 2020-09-27 23:36:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @trumpforprison7 @wecallonall @DonaldJTrumpJr You can't go much lower than stealing from a charity!
1310239282649587712 2020-09-27 23:26:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @tonyjulia11 @wecallonall When Biden wins, Barr will go too!  Vote Blue!
1310235847229399041 2020-09-27 23:12:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> The Republican party stoops to a new low every day.
1310234929746391040 2020-09-27 23:08:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> As long as I live, I will never understand someone denying a virus that has taken over 200,000 peoples lives and risked so many others.
1310233831623061505 2020-09-27 23:04:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Well said!
1310233234228346880 2020-09-27 23:02:00 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I am happy to see a Republican standing up against Trump!
1310232868900175874 2020-09-27 23:00:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> People often accuse others of what they themselves are guilty of!
1310232554193256450 2020-09-27 22:59:18 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyAnnReid @ElieNYC I agree!

1310231032814333952 2020-09-27 22:53:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NancySinatra We need to keep it up!
1310051907516407808 2020-09-27 11:01:28 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden @BetteMidler I agree!
1310051450148487168 2020-09-27 10:59:39 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I strongly object to anyone being appointed by Trump!  There is not enough time to properly vet anyone before the election.
1310029868843905027 2020-09-27 09:33:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @PatrickDempsey This is such an amazing even for a worthy cause.  I applaud you!
1310001184493760513 2020-09-27 07:39:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @GovHowardDean @wecallonall If Trump is protecting pre-existing conditions, why was my son turned down for insurance because he had a panic attack after his friend committed suicide and 9/11?  That was 20 years ago. One panic attack.  COVID already took his job.  He didn't need this too!
1309963979100389378 2020-09-27 05:12:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Wolfiesmom No one attacked Catholicism.  Democrats did not attack religion.  They just believe in a separation of church and state and do not believe that Christianity is the only true religion.  Stop lying and twisting the truth to suit your purpose.
1309854606424453123 2020-09-26 21:57:28 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Let this sink in!
1309854195546234880 2020-09-26 21:55:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @rolandscahill @wecallonall Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if there was a small army of little Trumps walking around with orange skin and blonde vanity flaps!
1309853509135802368 2020-09-26 21:53:07 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @HondoResists @wecallonall I never thought I was good at walking backwards, but here we go again!
1309852710112563203 2020-09-26 21:49:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Bill_Maxwell_ @Rosie Something is wrong with him.

1309689261025886208 2020-09-26 11:00:27 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @AnIllicitWriter @wecallonall Their crimes are blatant!  They don't even try to hide them anymore!

1309687053542658049 2020-09-26 10:51:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @bplace01 Sounds like a good Friday Night!
1309686934462107648 2020-09-26 10:51:12 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Sounds like a good Friday night!
1309653318185164800 2020-09-26 08:37:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I don't know about anyone else, but I am so tired of all that is going on.  I haven't seen my grandchildren since March and I am missing my children so much.  We all need to vote and get Trump out in November or we will never go back to a better way of life!
1309652852294516738 2020-09-26 08:35:46 +0800 <SUSANJA6> What happened to you?  How did Trump get to you?  Where did you go?  You have to see what is happening and that you have been complicit.  Be who you were before it's too late!
1309624302539550725 2020-09-26 06:42:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KamalaHarris We all have to vote! Our life does depend on it!
1309622109170171910 2020-09-26 06:33:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @jstmeinmo I am 58 and retired.  I was head of IT at a cell phone company and worked, for years, with many young people.  They all believed that unions were not needed anymore.  In their words, "Unions are not needed in today's society."
1309609414861746176 2020-09-26 05:43:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Without a doubt, Putin!
1309608407045943296 2020-09-26 05:39:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @jstmeinmo I grew up in  a union family.  I know what the unions have done for the working man and support them.  It amazes me that any union man could vote for Trump.
1309607966522462215 2020-09-26 05:37:25 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall @TeahCartel I make it from scratch also.  I am not a fan of the mixes.  Besides, cooking is my muse!
1309548602491052032 2020-09-26 01:41:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realmonaghan @EllenPompeo RBG will always be a leader in women's rights and a wonderful role model for all women.  I was saddened by her passing.  We lost a hero.
1309548273598951424 2020-09-26 01:40:13 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @rgay @EllenPompeo This outcome was so angering and upsetting.  What is wrong with our country that an innocent woman is shot and killed in her own home and no one will be held responsible?
1309547919436066819 2020-09-26 01:38:48 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @lebeausrogue @realDonaldTrump This a total and complete lie.  What is wrong with this man?

1309162397286969348 2020-09-25 00:06:53 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @rgay So true and so sad.
1309162104847564800 2020-09-25 00:05:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ItancanWin Prayers for your father.
1309161945551994882 2020-09-25 00:05:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @HillaryClinton I agree!  It is sad and a bit scary!
1309161431120646148 2020-09-25 00:03:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Rosie People should be outraged!
1309160920371920897 2020-09-25 00:01:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @sunny Trump is building insecurity in his followers.  He is undermining our countries election process.
1309160094475718674 2020-09-24 23:57:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @wecallonall Lol, my Twitter, my opinion.  If they leave they weren’t my friend anyway!
1309159652584763395 2020-09-24 23:55:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff It breaks my heart and makes me so angry to hear that no one was charged for murdering Breonna Taylor.  I wanted to burn down the world!
1308434966271922178 2020-09-22 23:56:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @AmyMcGrathKY Mitch McConnell needs to go.  He believes he is all powerful and can't see anyone across the aisle.  Vote for Amy McGrath!
1308434313424375808 2020-09-22 23:53:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @PatrickDempsey @allinthefilm I will be watching.  Things have to change and it starts with each one of us.  Thank you for all you do!

1308252318010404865 2020-09-22 11:50:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @gtconway3d Lindsey is a hypocritical little weasel!
1308251804690415616 2020-09-22 11:48:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler Agreed!

1307860486332076032 2020-09-21 09:53:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Rosie An amazing actor in an even more amazing show!  Congratulations!
1307848156726669312 2020-09-21 09:04:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @PatrickDempsey and @ProtonRacing congratulations on your great race!
1307847018979655685 2020-09-21 09:00:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I am boycotting the Emmy's until @EllenPompeo  is nominated.  She is the greatest, a natural, in the best show on tv.  Recognize! Give a girl her due!
1307679351207583744 2020-09-20 21:53:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump The people did not elect you.  The electoral college did.
1307678518323671042 2020-09-20 21:50:28 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NancySinatra @JoeBiden We can only hope!
1307678191851626502 2020-09-20 21:49:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Our country has gotten worse since you took office.  Why wait until the election to decide to correct this?
1307677990210416640 2020-09-20 21:48:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump I thought you already made it great!
1307677784316219400 2020-09-20 21:47:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @RealEricDane You haven't been on.  I wondered.
1307121438726512640 2020-09-19 08:56:50 +0800 <SUSANJA6> RIP Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Sadly we lost an amazingly strong woman and an intricate part of our Supreme Court.
1307120235963650048 2020-09-19 08:52:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> She was the G.O.A.T.  RBG showed women how to be strong and stand for what they believe in.  May she rest in peace.
1307092477254533122 2020-09-19 07:01:45 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shondarhimes @staceyabrams A great woman and a fighter!
1307092369960038403 2020-09-19 07:01:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @D_SAVRE @shondaland Love this show and its actors.  Can't wait!
1307018732506689537 2020-09-19 02:08:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Adoption is one of the most selfless and loving things a person can do for a child.  It is so easy to love them like your own.  I have two adopted children, twins, and I couldn't love them more and it changed their lives.
1307017876717666304 2020-09-19 02:05:19 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit I just know he is a good man.
1307017133050789888 2020-09-19 02:02:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Right now I don't feel like anything is ok.😢
1307016902103969792 2020-09-19 02:01:27 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @violadavis Beautiful!!
1307016160165212162 2020-09-19 01:58:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Nuh Uh, you're crying!
1307015841859469312 2020-09-19 01:57:14 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shondaland I am waiting impatiently!
1307015694794592256 2020-09-19 01:56:39 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff I'm counting the minutes until great tv again!
1305330111600787457 2020-09-14 10:18:45 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler LOL
1305300029377216513 2020-09-14 08:19:12 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @NancySinatra He loves people that are just like him!
1305158712915570689 2020-09-13 22:57:40 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump What a lie!
1305158389689970692 2020-09-13 22:56:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Can you ever make a statement without putting someone down?
1305158257888165888 2020-09-13 22:55:52 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Rosie I feel the same way.  What kind of world is going to be left for our children and grandchildren?
1304963576810082306 2020-09-13 10:02:16 +0800 <SUSANJA6> When will this end!
1304963067135090689 2020-09-13 10:00:14 +0800 <SUSANJA6> This makes me sick👇
1304962476577038340 2020-09-13 09:57:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler I'll see it when I get mine.  Trump makes me sick!
1304601247807418368 2020-09-12 10:02:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @cher Trump doesn't have a conscience.  He and his family are.  tested daily.  That is as far as his caring goes.
1304600662827831297 2020-09-12 10:00:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @pippcsoo I seriously wonder if I'll ever get to go to a theater again.  My immune system is compromised and if COVID is looming I will not get to go.  I love movies!
1304596355139198976 2020-09-12 09:43:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Weinsteinlaw Donald Trump is nuts!
1304591130462433280 2020-09-12 09:22:18 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Amy_Siskind The lack of morals within the Republican party is amazing.  The fact that they stand behind Trump says it all!
1304571719584305152 2020-09-12 08:05:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ejeancarroll @Rosie @realDonaldTrump Keep fighting.  Women are behind you.  You deserve justice.
1304529165945692161 2020-09-12 05:16:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TraceeEllisRoss @netflix @MsJillMJones @therealgolden47 @RealPersiaWhite I'm ready.  Great women and actors!
1304528964921167872 2020-09-12 05:15:16 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler So true!
1304511099241336832 2020-09-12 04:04:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @maddow @JoyAnnReid Yet another reason to vote blue!
1304510790825775104 2020-09-12 04:03:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TMZ Shut up and sit down Rudy.  No one hates the police.  The people just want equal justice.
1304510458083160064 2020-09-12 04:01:44 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shondarhimes @staceyabrams @byshondaland Great women.  We can't let this happen again.
1304510114934804481 2020-09-12 04:00:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @EllenPompeo @PatrickDempsey I love her laugh.
1304510000543354880 2020-09-12 03:59:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> " If you can think of a reason; any reason at all why the universe is so screwed up and random and mean; now would be an amazingly good time to tell me because I really need some answers."  Meredith Grey - @EllenPompeo   This quote popped into my head today. #NeverForget
1304491996740874241 2020-09-12 02:48:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> This story hit close to home for me.  My daughter is a sheriff's deputy in NC.  I worry every day about her safety.  It saddens me to see a life lost for any reason.  But, it is particularly sad when it is a first responder.
1304477564661043200 2020-09-12 01:51:02 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TMZ How does an adult do something so unbelievably selfish?  How do you choose to infect people with a virus that can kill anyone and has?  Grow up!
1304476792187768833 2020-09-12 01:47:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TraceeEllisRoss @etnow All very beautiful women!
1304476479632408576 2020-09-12 01:46:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff Finally!  I pray that Breonna receives the justice she deserves.  I pray for her family to get the justice they deserve.  #JusticeforBreanna #SayHerName
1304475765589848064 2020-09-12 01:43:53 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @fred_guttenberg @JoeBiden A class act!
1304475587118092288 2020-09-12 01:43:10 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TheView This broke my heart.  I people really this hateful?  How will we ever recover from our years with Trump?
1304425691547602944 2020-09-11 22:24:54 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar He jumps up and down anytime someone doesn't agree with him.  Does he really not know that being presidential would consist of telling the truth to the people and being able to keep them calm and teaching them how to stop the spread?
1304425190315700225 2020-09-11 22:22:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Yes, send them all back so our numbers can go up on deaths from COVID-19!  (note sarcasm)
1304424980231467009 2020-09-11 22:22:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @rachaelray The first responders are heroes.  I also thank you for all you do!
1304260503477288965 2020-09-11 11:28:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @itsJeffTiedrich @Rosie I agree!
1304245291655127041 2020-09-11 10:28:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump We are living in your America and it is not safe right now.  Why are you waiting until you are re-elected to do these things?
1304244627327782913 2020-09-11 10:25:25 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Amy_Siskind @Rosie These idiots and Trump's lies are why I have been quarantined at home since March.  My immune system is compromised so I can't even run errands because where I live, almost all Republican, no one wears a mask.
1304243552545730560 2020-09-11 10:21:09 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump I am sick of hearing how democrats are so far left that they will destroy the United States.  Why is it that you can't stand on your own merit?  You lied to us.  We deserved the truth!
1304230806596890624 2020-09-11 09:30:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden Exactly!
1304207378624032768 2020-09-11 07:57:24 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristenClarkeJD @BetteMidler The new Republican party!
1304198135762153472 2020-09-11 07:20:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Thank you for being you!  I have been isolated since March and wish I could go out, but when Trump minimizes the virus his followers do not think they should wear masks for something that is "no worse than the flu'.
1304197353503518720 2020-09-11 07:17:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff Seeing the devastation brought me to tears today.  I pray all are safe and hope to see links to help not only the people, but the firefighters.
1304138522140520451 2020-09-11 03:23:48 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TMZ I have recently found out about so many things I was not taught in school.  Teach it all.  The good, bad and ugly and allow our children to learn the truth so that they will work towards equal justice.
1304137901421330433 2020-09-11 03:21:20 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @gtconway3d @realDonaldTrump If Woodward has evidence of Trump admitting this, Trump should be in jail.
1304137662241136641 2020-09-11 03:20:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Mediaite @MeghanMcCain More dangerous words from a Republican.  The media reports the news.  They can't spin it so that no one gets their feelings hurt.
1304137155753717761 2020-09-11 03:18:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I am now in my 50's and always knew our country would go through changes, but I never believed I would be living in a country so full of hatred and ugliness towards one another.  😢
1304135785432702979 2020-09-11 03:12:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump Are you going to discuss the cyber attacks on both campaigns today?
1304121403436929025 2020-09-11 02:15:46 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @camilluddington Can't wait to see what this season has in store!
1304116026964160512 2020-09-11 01:54:24 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyAnnReid Vote like your life depends on it!
1304115596058124288 2020-09-11 01:52:42 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @violadavis @Inclusionists We, your viewers and fans are behind you!
1304101679407783936 2020-09-11 00:57:24 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @robreiner @NancySinatra I am so tired of hearing excuses for the things Trump has done.  Can this many people actually lack integrity.  Can they all lack empathy for the people they represent.  You should all be ashamed.
1304063704686825474 2020-09-10 22:26:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit I make no apologies for how I chose to repair what you broke!
1304049339019464704 2020-09-10 21:29:25 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar It was a lie of omission!
1304048872948404225 2020-09-10 21:27:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar Your calm, no panic plan made it 'ok' for your followers to say the virus was a hoax.  You made it 'ok' for your followers not to wear masks and gather in large groups.  You even encouraged your followers.  We all deserved to hear the truth.
1304047478073946113 2020-09-10 21:22:01 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump How do you praise a tyrant?
1303896035664617473 2020-09-10 11:20:14 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @MSNBC @NancySinatra @chrislhayes Because of Trump's choice to lie about the dangers of COVID-19,  I have not been able to see my children or grandchildren since last March.  People refused to quarantine or wear masks.  If Trump had told the truth from the start things might be different!
1303892776426172416 2020-09-10 11:07:17 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Amy_Siskind @NancySinatra This should not have been Trump's choice.  We deserved the truth!
1303892035825315841 2020-09-10 11:04:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @PattyArquette @NancySinatra We, the people of the United States, were entitled to the truth!
1303886319064461313 2020-09-10 10:41:38 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler Exactly.
1303883566078599168 2020-09-10 10:30:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> I agree with your choice.  It's a no brainer!
1303879853993725953 2020-09-10 10:15:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump @LizMacDonaldFOX @KristinBTate People are sick and tired of being lied to.
1303876842798030848 2020-09-10 10:03:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Ellen Pompeo, do you have a Facebook page?  @EllenPompeo
1303874488002633728 2020-09-10 09:54:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @bestofmredith The most natural actress of all times.
1303874310285778944 2020-09-10 09:53:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ABC @TheView Did you ever, for one minute, think that if you had stressed how dangerous this virus was more would have taken it seriously and stayed home, wore masks and not gathered in large crowds?
1303873349299384321 2020-09-10 09:50:05 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TMZ We all do not kill people.  Some of us are actually mature and responsible at 17.
1303872991776866306 2020-09-10 09:48:40 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @mommamia1217 @fred_guttenberg Tom Cotton you are pro-birth, not pro-life.  The second babies are born you wash your hands of them.  You no longer care if they are taken care of.  Find something else to preach about and get out of our vaginas!
1303871092717690882 2020-09-10 09:41:07 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff I agree!  Trump needs to go!
1303848036116893696 2020-09-10 08:09:30 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @rachaelray @RachaelRayShow @FoodNetwork @fnkitchen I loved your shows at home, but it will be great to see you back in the studio.  Have a great season.  I'll be watching!
1303836813686124544 2020-09-10 07:24:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar Resign!
1303831850230714370 2020-09-10 07:05:11 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @chipfranklin I have heard this and it's frightening!  What has happened to our country?
1303831265481756672 2020-09-10 07:02:52 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden Please keep this at the forefront.  Don't let it die because Trump wants it to.  He is dangerous and does not belong in the White House!
1303830639129563139 2020-09-10 07:00:23 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit I agree with you.  If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all!
1303807425561145349 2020-09-10 05:28:08 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @enews Ellen Pompeo is the G.O.A.T.!
1303807166307065858 2020-09-10 05:27:06 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TMZ He's adorable!
1303805905897750528 2020-09-10 05:22:06 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar Agreed.  Resign now!
1303801986912071682 2020-09-10 05:06:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @KristaVernoff Every person in the United States should feel rage.  He lied.  So many have died because he lied.  How is this man still in office?
1303801572770668547 2020-09-10 05:04:53 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @robertwolf32 @Scaramucci @fred_guttenberg How is it that any self-respecting person can defend Trump?
1303800499439886336 2020-09-10 05:00:37 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoyVBehar Jim Jordan is not even worth recognizing.  He is a loud mouth jerk.
1303799578823663616 2020-09-10 04:56:57 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @EllenPompeo How could anyone not love Ellen Pompeo?
1303548609410093056 2020-09-09 12:19:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Good things come to those who wait!
1303127724991553536 2020-09-08 08:27:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Grey's begins taping tomorrow!  Exhale, the new season is coming.....@EllenPompeo
1303125073801424897 2020-09-08 08:16:43 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump @CNN Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you supposed to be the President for everyone in the United States?  If so, why are you constantly using demeaning words to describe all democrats?
1302980425145610240 2020-09-07 22:41:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump @OANN Will there ever come a day when you stand on your own performance and stop putting down others?
1302775030116478984 2020-09-07 09:05:46 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @JoeBiden Yes please!
1302756477782945796 2020-09-07 07:52:03 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Why does anyone need an AR-15?
1302756051020853249 2020-09-07 07:50:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Nayara77777 @GreysABC @EllenPompeo @PatrickDempsey I am pretty old and I have not seen it in anything I have ever watched.  These two were amazing.
1302301894480670725 2020-09-06 01:45:41 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @realDonaldTrump According to you, everyone makes everything up.  How did we ever get along without you?  Note sarcasm!
1302301256745189376 2020-09-06 01:43:09 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @Rosie Your son is a hero!
1302043513631186955 2020-09-05 08:38:59 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Will Owen stay with Teddy?  Will Amelia stay with Link?  What will they name their baby? Will Meredith stay with DeLuca?  So many questions?  When will the season start?  When will we get our answers?  @EllenPompeo and @GiacomoKG
1301983492360732672 2020-09-05 04:40:28 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Thank you Grey's Anatomy for using their voice to show it's viewers the importance of being vigilant in protecting themselves and others against this pandemic.
1301620681231261699 2020-09-04 04:38:48 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @violadavis This is one amazing woman.  She speaks words that we should all live by.  She is missed!
1301619025324146688 2020-09-04 04:32:13 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shondarhimes @byshondaland Sometimes it's the only thing that will get you through!
1301563972752150530 2020-09-04 00:53:27 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @shondarhimes I knew I liked this guy!
1301540596260241410 2020-09-03 23:20:34 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @greyspostit @EllenPompeo @EllenPompeo is fucking awesome!
1301521641957195776 2020-09-03 22:05:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Beautiful!
1301309884571377664 2020-09-03 08:03:48 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @BetteMidler I can't quit laughing!
1301276552383139841 2020-09-03 05:51:21 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @TVLine Yes!
1301192215163625472 2020-09-03 00:16:13 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Congratulations Ed Markey.  We need the Green New Deal!
1301190183606300672 2020-09-03 00:08:09 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @ReesusP @EllenPompeo And I'm behind you!
1301189841443414017 2020-09-03 00:06:47 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Yet another reason why @EllenPompeo and @AOC are used in my household as examples to my daughter and granddaughters for what kind of women they want to become!
1301189156047998981 2020-09-03 00:04:04 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Discussion flash cards are great ways to study.  A long time ago, my study group used these and we were very successful in terms of grades and understanding the material.
1301187871999578113 2020-09-02 23:58:58 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Congratulations Ed Markey!
1301187609054474242 2020-09-02 23:57:55 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo I'm ready to vote!  We need change.  We need answers to solve the pandemic.  We need our country back!
1301186751126368264 2020-09-02 23:54:31 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo Goals I have set for my daughter and granddaughters. Grow up to be strong women like @EllenPompeo and @AOC !  I was not strong and know the importance of having confidence and being the best you can be!
1301159256746422272 2020-09-02 22:05:15 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @fred_guttenberg @DeAnna4Congress What is wrong with people?
1300781641804251136 2020-09-01 21:04:45 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Am I imagining things or did Trump defend the Kenosha shooter and Trump supporters shooting paintballs at protestors?
1300775898359230464 2020-09-01 20:41:56 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @mcdreamypatrick I liked Patrick Dempsey, but since his departure @EllenPompeo has proven to be the one character that has held this show together.  Her character has grown emotionally and matured.  Without her there can be no Grey's Anatomy!
1300775253044539392 2020-09-01 20:39:22 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @EllenPompeo @EllenPompeo I sometimes have all of these moods in one day!
1300599504362758150 2020-09-01 09:01:00 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @MONTGCMERYFILMS I love this scene!
1300597631450853376 2020-09-01 08:53:33 +0800 <SUSANJA6> @rachaelray @RachaelRayShow Finally!  Stay safe and I'm sure you will have a great season!
1300597155439300609 2020-09-01 08:51:40 +0800 <SUSANJA6> Sitting here watching Grey's the second time around.  I watched season 12 this last week and @EllenPompeo if you didn't win an Emmy for season 12 there is something wrong with this world!  The best acting I have ever seen!
