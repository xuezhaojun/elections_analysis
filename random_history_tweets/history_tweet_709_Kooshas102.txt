1314043656538644481 2020-10-08 11:23:16 +0800 <Kooshas102> Kamala was terrible. Everyone knows it.
1314042228696809478 2020-10-08 11:17:35 +0800 <Kooshas102> Pence did very well
1313598717983895559 2020-10-07 05:55:14 +0800 <Kooshas102> The Pelosi Bill contained poison pills like ending voter ID laws, legalizing ballot harvesting around the country, and taxpayer funded stimulus payments for illegal immigrants.  Why are you defending the Pelosi Bill? @RyanGirdusky @DarrenJBeattie
1313584774003527680 2020-10-07 04:59:50 +0800 <Kooshas102> @TRElections @galt1776 @RyanGirdusky So, you wanted Trump to sign onto stimulus checks to illegal aliens?
1313584230950199297 2020-10-07 04:57:40 +0800 <Kooshas102> @ThumpForTrump @RyanGirdusky Exactly.  Stimulus checks to illegal aliens is wrong. Trump did the right thing.
1313577996289224707 2020-10-07 04:32:54 +0800 <Kooshas102> I've been following the Stimulus Bill for a while now. Pelosi's bill contained language for direct payments to illegal aliens. I don't understand why populists or conservatives would support that. Trump made the right decision.
1313574171138568194 2020-10-07 04:17:42 +0800 <Kooshas102> @JackPosobiec @SpeakerPelosi The Bill contained direct funds to illegal aliens. I don't understand why @RyanGirdusky and @DarrenJBeattie would support Pelosi's bill...
1313568812848029701 2020-10-07 03:56:24 +0800 <Kooshas102> @USKOTM @DiMartinoBooth I think she's absolutely right.
1313566125360394250 2020-10-07 03:45:43 +0800 <Kooshas102> I have to avoid reading what some of the populist leaders on the Right have to say about the Stimulus bill. Direct funds to illegal aliens isn't populist. It's not even conservative. Trump made the right decision to stop all talks.
1313563121689206784 2020-10-07 03:33:47 +0800 <Kooshas102> @Nrthamericn1 @DiMartinoBooth @business Yes, I plan to vote for him. Thank you.
1313561619247575040 2020-10-07 03:27:49 +0800 <Kooshas102> @RyanGirdusky @realDonaldTrump Nancy Pelosi's bill contained direct payments to illegal aliens.
1313559880570150913 2020-10-07 03:20:54 +0800 <Kooshas102> @RyanGirdusky I disagree. The bill was TERRIBLE. Conservatives don't want Trump to sign an awful bill.
1313559635333459969 2020-10-07 03:19:56 +0800 <Kooshas102> @DarrenJBeattie I disagree. The bill was TERRIBLE. Conservatives don't want Trump to sign an awful bill.
1313320227288092673 2020-10-06 11:28:37 +0800 <Kooshas102> @ABartonMacro Here's the thing though... if it were true, wouldn't he be campaigning in states like Kansas? His campaign strategy doesn't match the polls.
1313291508297150464 2020-10-06 09:34:30 +0800 <Kooshas102> The alt-left press in this country are going crazy. It's a great sight to see.

1312971826855804928 2020-10-05 12:24:12 +0800 <Kooshas102> @ColumbiaBugle @realDonaldTrump Yes but do it like the second video where he's sitting down. That one was really good and had a lot of impact on people. He has to be honest, don't brag so much, but define the differences between the two. @TrumpWarRoom @DonaldJTrumpJr
1312930963706515458 2020-10-05 09:41:49 +0800 <Kooshas102> @farnazfassihi @LiveSquawk Sounds like fake news.
1312909433928855554 2020-10-05 08:16:16 +0800 <Kooshas102> The left is just incredibly stupid. From 57 genders to hysterical takes on everything in the world.
1312892900712341505 2020-10-05 07:10:34 +0800 <Kooshas102> The fake news media is awful in our country. Vote against them in November.

1312884140958769159 2020-10-05 06:35:46 +0800 <Kooshas102> Twitter's block button is excellent.  I also like how you can change what's trending in each country. I avoid reading anything U.S. related trend-wise because of how left-wing/controlled it is.
1312879829478445070 2020-10-05 06:18:38 +0800 <Kooshas102> These left wing journalists occupying our country are awful people.

1312577770548072448 2020-10-04 10:18:21 +0800 <Kooshas102> @kausmickey Probably... but much better than where the Democrats were at the time.
1312577533041348609 2020-10-04 10:17:25 +0800 <Kooshas102> @kausmickey I don‚Äôt think he really messed up on COVID. It really was mysterious how it all happened. They didn‚Äôt know enough about it. I do remember the Dems calling him xenophobic for shutting down flights coming out of China. It turns out he did good here. Could he have done it earlier?
1312550298259521536 2020-10-04 08:29:11 +0800 <Kooshas102> You know what I love about this platform at times? I don't track what's trending in the United States. I have it set to Japan, Haha. I don't even want to read the narratives being crafted by the Losers at Twitter/DNC.

Trump's persuasive and has made me less libertarian and more nationalist. Trade, less-immigration, and ending wars is the winning message.
