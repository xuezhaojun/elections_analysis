You haven‚Äôt read the details of the Japan U.K. deal.   It is tailored to the U.K. with provisions the Eu couldn‚Äôt get due to the lowest common denominator of the 27.

1342880767031074816 2020-12-27 01:11:39 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 Its a simple concept. It‚Äôs way less than now and it‚Äôs  not 20m  You demand 60 m all stay in perpetual lock down - and we incurs a debt our kids are going to pay for  You‚Äôre ignoring the 40 m. You cannot provide any solutions or grasp risk.   You‚Äôre the stupid and selfish one. Bye
1342875951496122369 2020-12-27 00:52:30 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 Lots. And way more than now.   You seem incapable of understanding that it seems.   Why ignore the benefits it brings to the other 40 m?   It reduces non covid related deaths. Protects the economy. Is cheaper.   You offer no solutions. Pointless discussion
1342873615226662912 2020-12-27 00:43:13 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 What‚Äôs your solution?
1342873075830960129 2020-12-27 00:41:05 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 Less than now.
1342869988114386947 2020-12-27 00:28:49 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 It‚Äôs way less than it would be now.   What‚Äôs your point?
1342869806245097474 2020-12-27 00:28:05 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 What your point?   I don‚Äôt need to know an exact number - other than it‚Äôs significantly lower than now  It‚Äôs definitely not even close to the 20 m no you‚Äôre guessing  And it protects the lives of at risk non covid deaths while at risk households get the vaccine first
1342863435927855104 2020-12-27 00:02:46 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 It won‚Äôt be 1 in 3 households. More like 1 in 10. Not even close to 20m.   We‚Äôre all in this together until the money runs out. And more and people die from non covid treatable illnesses. Let them die is your solution?   Tier by category is way cheaper than mass lockdown.
1342860479891386368 2020-12-26 23:51:02 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 It won‚Äôt be 1 in 3 households. More like 1 in 10.   We‚Äôre all in this together until the money runs out. And more and people die from non covid treatable illnesses.   Ok. So your solution is if there is a new variant - mass lock down again for 6 months.
1342857598702387200 2020-12-26 23:39:35 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 I never said it was as about the pub. You did.   Answer the question - what‚Äôs the alternative?
1342852939736559620 2020-12-26 23:21:04 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 I did.   In a mixed household - where there is an elderly relative vulnerable person, they all follow the format.   It doesn‚Äôt matter how many - it‚Äôs way less than locking all down.   So - what‚Äôs your alternative?   Mass lockdown every time there  is a new variant?
1342851076974931973 2020-12-26 23:13:40 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 I get the point. I gave you a solution.  It applies to all households- people have to make that call.   What do you suggest?
1342848868451540993 2020-12-26 23:04:53 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 So 60 million should stay locked down because of one 26 year old?   The 26 year old is already locked up.   The house creates a bubble and the 26 year old fits in to the at risk tier.   Nothing is perfect - the question is mass lock down or an alternative.   Any suggestions?
1342846928418205696 2020-12-26 22:57:11 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 And if a household is in an ‚Äúat risk‚Äù group - then they all follow the rules of those at most risk.  The concept of bubbles is well established now.
1342846477496967168 2020-12-26 22:55:23 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 What the alternative- we all stay locked down?   Suicide rates go up.   Businesses fold   Patients needing care don‚Äôt get it and those deaths exceed covid?   There is no ‚Äúno risk‚Äù strategy.
1342845362520928256 2020-12-26 22:50:57 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 No. They/we are already locked away.  I‚Äôm suggesting a way might be to create a structure that allows business to resume - Say  9 to 11 am vulnerable group shopping   Priority and dedicated supermarket deliver slots   Self isolate before seeing at risk   Or we all stay locked up
1342835869141651457 2020-12-26 22:13:14 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 When we are not in lock down, there is risk. So we already accept that and we take the risk as it is.   It would be no different for those who decide they are high risk
1342831767875682313 2020-12-26 21:56:56 +0800 <boomer_ish> @CarolineMack18 @JuliaHB1 Oops - sorry Caroline - I reposted on Julia‚Äôs comment.   It would be less than now so as opposed to all, maybe 20% of the population?   Suicide rates are rocketing, people are losing businesses - a one size fits all approach has its limits?  The government know that hence tiers
1342830492794703872 2020-12-26 21:51:52 +0800 <boomer_ish> @JuliaHB1 Exactly. There must be a way to create tiers by risk group as opposed to geography;   Designated shopping hours   Dedicated shopping delivery slots   Self isolate before you see your elderly  At the moment it‚Äôs all in the same boat. People can then decide what group they are in?
1342827984449925122 2020-12-26 21:41:54 +0800 <boomer_ish> @paulmasonnews Brexit is cross party issue. The 80 seat majority shows that.   All three parties campaigned leave in 2015/16.  They stuck to their manifesto - which is more than Labour or the Lib Dem‚Äôs did.   They get my vote. Labour are out for the next GE or two.
1342826528116240384 2020-12-26 21:36:07 +0800 <boomer_ish> One thing I admire about Germany is that it is a pragmatic nation.  Boris was right it seems that in the end, the potential damage to the German economy would sway the deal.   Barnier and France‚Äôs approach would have reinforced division. The outcome is I hope, good for the future

Proroguing parliament was to counter the remain establishment and treasonous behaviour.  Controversial yes.  But it‚Äôs getting boring playing the man and not the ball.

1335991642050981889 2020-12-08 00:56:43 +0800 <boomer_ish> @eamonxofarrell @johnredwood You will be dropped like a hot potato when the EU can‚Äôt use you after 1 Jan.   Look out for tax harmonisation and corporate tax rates, more centralisation and being a contributor rather than a receiver.
1335915556785057793 2020-12-07 19:54:23 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Danecek3000 The premise of the article is correct.   Keep wiggling.
1335915314257780739 2020-12-07 19:53:25 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Asparagus88 @johnredwood You assume it‚Äôs lowering taxes. Or standards.  I never said that.  I‚Äôve answered the question twice.  Can‚Äôt help it if you don‚Äôt understand it.

1335912912263766023 2020-12-07 19:43:53 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Danecek3000 You‚Äôve agreed JLR moved U.K. jobs due to state aid.   The broad assertion that companies are enticed to move from the U.K. on state aid or funding/grants in the article is correct.   I won‚Äôt defend each line as I didn‚Äôt write it....but in summary, that is the undisputed issue
1335909695576485889 2020-12-07 19:31:06 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Danecek3000 It didn‚Äôt seem so for JLR and Ford did it? Fact is the policies through grants or sponsored state subsidy is at the expense of another EU member  The U.K. can fund its own rules on protecting its industry. Funny though the EU are trying to bind the U.K. to more onerous LPF rules
1335908394289520641 2020-12-07 19:25:55 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Danecek3000 Ps - the jobs were relocated from the U.K. to Slovakia due to state aid enabled by the EU  I‚Äôll bet that if the U.K. funded a plant, it would be breaching the rules.
1335905609363968001 2020-12-07 19:14:51 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Danecek3000 So because it‚Äôs regeneration - or if you make a rule state subsidy is ok - it‚Äôs ok at the expense of another.   That‚Äôs the point. The EU rules it‚Äôs ok.  In the same breath, they are trying to impose LPF conditions on the UK more onerous that ones member states have today ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1335883608935067654 2020-12-07 17:47:26 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Danecek3000 How about the EU grants to Ford and JLR to relocate engine and manufacting to EE?   The over riding point is the EU are making decisions - and funding regional development at the expense of other areas.   It views itself as a national state - and acts as a national state.
1335881170198945793 2020-12-07 17:37:45 +0800 <boomer_ish> @MAS1304 @johnredwood New markets. New sources of supply. More flexible trade. Ability to decide tax and vat.   Trade with EU is not a binary - i.e on and off. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúcut off‚Äù.   Trade continues. Some areas it falls. Others it grows.   The EU is a protectionist block that is past its sell by date

1335666416092139522 2020-12-07 03:24:23 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Asparagus88 @johnredwood NATO didn‚Äôt create 30000 new laws, directives and the like in the last 30 years.  Or mandate ever closer union politically or fiscally.   The U.K. as the 5th largest economy and one of 5 permanent security council seats isn‚Äôt exactly offering peanuts.   CETA + is what Tusk said.
1335630785437708294 2020-12-07 01:02:48 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Asparagus88 @johnredwood Trade is trade.   U.K. wants CETA. Both sides want to protect existing sales. The U.K. has a ¬£90 b trade deficit   Galileo is because we paid for a lot of it and provided know how. We‚Äôve bought an alternative   Security is in both interests. We don‚Äôt cede sovereignty to NATO..
1335628348404473861 2020-12-07 00:53:07 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Asparagus88 @johnredwood Undermine? How is Canada undermining the EU with CETA?   Funny how article 8 and be a good neighbour goes out the window.   The EU talk about fairness. Be fair.   That‚Äôs all the U.K. asks.
1335619481008300033 2020-12-07 00:17:53 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Asparagus88 @johnredwood Sure. And so the opposite is true.   Doesn‚Äôt stop the EU trying.
1335614693847789573 2020-12-06 23:58:52 +0800 <boomer_ish> @markchopharris @nickgutteridge No to non regression.  Who says EU farming practices are the best for example.
1335614049434935297 2020-12-06 23:56:18 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Asparagus88 @johnredwood Who says it‚Äôs about taxes?   What about free ports, or alternate cheaper sources of supply with tariffs to protect our industries- not the EU‚Äôs (read CAP)   Or being able to sell to 84% of the worlds GDP on our terms.  Deficit isn‚Äôt 300 b anyway.
1335603645493211137 2020-12-06 23:14:58 +0800 <boomer_ish> @BergkampsBrain @johnredwood Not really. NY is no 1 in financial services globally  London is no 2 and even after Brexit despite the doomsayers, is closing on No 1.   There isn‚Äôt one EU country in the top 10.   NY, HK and SG all manage quite fine  The EU don‚Äôt want us to. They are stranded. With out control
1335563419475390464 2020-12-06 20:35:07 +0800 <boomer_ish> @BergkampsBrain @johnredwood The UK are not saying it‚Äôs a free for all. To the contrary.   Independent arbitrator. That‚Äôs the UK‚Äôs position - which is the WTO for trade.   We cannot mandate the EU to align to our laws and write them into EU statutes. - why should we align to the EU‚Äôs beyond standard FTA
1335552532333072384 2020-12-06 19:51:51 +0800 <boomer_ish> @BergkampsBrain @johnredwood Like any other deal. But not the courts of one party in the deal.   That‚Äôs poacher turned gamekeeper.   That‚Äôs why the WTO regulate trade.
1335541350159282177 2020-12-06 19:07:25 +0800 <boomer_ish> @FlimsRadar @johnredwood An FTA like CETA protects the integrity of the SM.   You haven‚Äôt answered my question.  Show me an FTA that has dynamic alignment and ECJ oversight. And retains access to a nations resources.   The EU‚Äôs position has changed. They want the U.K. in the ECJ framework. Unprecedented
1335539615118274561 2020-12-06 19:00:32 +0800 <boomer_ish> @FlimsRadar @johnredwood They have that in the NI protocol.  And with an FTA the whole IMB argument goes away.   But the EU are refusing to agree an FTA. And by saying the U.K. would not be on the 3rd country list, threatened a blockade on intra-GB trade.   Not agreeing the FTA is the issue
1335537954526289921 2020-12-06 18:53:56 +0800 <boomer_ish> @FlimsRadar @johnredwood We agree. No problem with CETA or Japan LPF terms   But the EU want more - they want us de facto part of their legal framework under the guise of LPF.   Show me one trade deal that has that

1335533333195919360 2020-12-06 18:35:34 +0800 <boomer_ish> @FlimsRadar @johnredwood And if was an issue, why did Tusk offer CETA plus in 2018.   Only to withdraw it after the WA was signed - with the fundamental understanding that it was the way forward?
1335532866395103233 2020-12-06 18:33:43 +0800 <boomer_ish> @FlimsRadar @johnredwood The location benefits the EU as much as the U.K. so no.

Trade happened before EEA and the EU.   The EU have refused to negotiate unless the they control the U.K. through LPF.   Why the extortion on LPF, ECJ and fish?
1335529669945413633 2020-12-06 18:21:00 +0800 <boomer_ish> @norfolksheep @nornirishfella @johnredwood It‚Äôs way better in terms of trade, digital economy and financial services and manufacturing parts tariffs.   Japan is a brand and quality conscious market. Great for U.K.  PLC   U.K. would be happy with those terms. But the EU refuse to treat the U.K. the same as CETA and Japan.
1335529021782810624 2020-12-06 18:18:26 +0800 <boomer_ish> @FlimsRadar @johnredwood CETA LPF terms are standard. It‚Äôs what the U.K. asked for  Dynamic alignment to laws not made and under ECJ oversight effectively writes U.K. legislation. Unprecedented.   Oh and then there is the principal of sovereign integrity and fish.
1335527745707765760 2020-12-06 18:13:22 +0800 <boomer_ish> @FlimsRadar @johnredwood Product standards and CE marks are not the same as LPF and de facto control over non trade legislation

And made it harder.   55 trade deals signed/rolled over. Japan deal suites is better than the EU one.   Trade with the US is growing whereas trade with the EU is falling..
1335515810257915907 2020-12-06 17:25:56 +0800 <boomer_ish> @BergkampsBrain @johnredwood An FTA is what the U.K. wants. No ECJ control or dynamic LPF alignment and our fish.   Or it‚Äôs no deal. No deal is better than a bad deal.   Simple really.

1335514201436147717 2020-12-06 17:19:32 +0800 <boomer_ish> @johnredwood I think they do. And the fact that we can chart our own path and be more competitive scares them.   They chose not to in order to retain control and nobble us.
1335512153319747584 2020-12-06 17:11:24 +0800 <boomer_ish> @acgrayling It's utterly shameful that four &amp; a half years on, through 2 general elections &amp; 3 prime ministers, that remainers have undermined the government and referendum result in an attempt to block leaving.   And so doing, weakened the UK‚Äôs position while supporting the EU.   Fixed it.

So at one point they were potentially excluded from the count. As invalid -  and a later point included.

How about this one? Dead people apparently.   My point remains that the context of the question and the agenda behind it came be ignored.

Knowing that will make it invalid.   So the vote is legitimate- but invalid.   Should the vote be included? The question was a trap - you can‚Äôt ignore the context in which it was asked.

My point remains Labour have no position.  But to find fault - after the fact  On your latest attempt, CETA is oven ready. Tusk committed 2018. The EU reneged.    Whose fault is that?

Would that be the one they negotiated with the EU - and then took back to the people to vote on?    So that again, they weren‚Äôt actually accountable? Or if they did a worse job, it was remain?   That deal?

1312322092306702336 2020-10-03 17:22:23 +0800 <boomer_ish> @andrewskea @BBCkatyaadler The U.K. is 15 % of exports, US 16%.    The EU was 33% of global trade in 73. ow 14%.  The U.K. is a major market. The EU can either allow others to trade on FTA‚Äôs or not.   So you accept that the EU can be hostile and extort fish. And that‚Äôs ok with you.   Nothing more to say
1312320567970869250 2020-10-03 17:16:19 +0800 <boomer_ish> @andrewskea @BBCkatyaadler I don‚Äôt care about the EU. Extortionists.   The big picture for the U.K. is sovereign integrity.   The EU need to respect the fact the NI is part of the U.K.    They don‚Äôt.  Cue IMB.
1312320053665247243 2020-10-03 17:14:17 +0800 <boomer_ish> @andrewskea @BBCkatyaadler It‚Äôs all about tariffs. No one says no border. It‚Äôs what type of boarder.   There won‚Äôt be customs or tariffs on goods not bound for IRE. Cue IMB   I‚Äôm not moaning. You are along with the EU now that they have been snookered by the IMB.
1312319024731127809 2020-10-03 17:10:11 +0800 <boomer_ish> @andrewskea @BBCkatyaadler People would look at the big picture and that the NI problem would be solved.   It would be if the EU would negotiate in good faith.   Trade is trade. They want access to our markets and the EU trade surplus is circa ¬£ 80 billion.   Sovereignty of U.K. waters is not on offer
1312315678645538816 2020-10-03 16:56:54 +0800 <boomer_ish> @andrewskea @BBCkatyaadler The point is an FTA would mean a border in the Irish Sea is virtual. No tariffs or checks needed.   It‚Äôs what was intended by the WA and PD.   So in effect NI remains in both. Customs declarations are made in advance. Not at a border.   Customs union is 4 freedoms. Not an option
1312314712223354880 2020-10-03 16:53:03 +0800 <boomer_ish> @andrewskea @BBCkatyaadler So article 8 that refers to being good neighbours only applies to the 28. And not the EU itself.   Cameron tried to reform from within and in the end failed.   The EU are attempting to carve out NI and extort fish.   No matter what you voted, that should gall any U.K. national.

The Eu demands on dynamic alignment and continued writing of laws as yet unknown under ‚ÄúLPF‚Äù into U.K. statutes under ECJ governance is not.
1312305366617780226 2020-10-03 16:15:55 +0800 <boomer_ish> @bdhoffman_ @BremainInSpain Tusk committed to CETA plus.    Not hard is it.

1312285302124412931 2020-10-03 14:56:11 +0800 <boomer_ish> @andrewskea @BBCkatyaadler The purpose of the EU is a superstate.  If the Eu follow through on their intentions of a CETA type FTA, the IMB isn‚Äôt needed.   They won‚Äôt agree that until they knobble the U.K. with ECJ oversight and dynamic LPF terms that are written into our statutes.
1312284369315340288 2020-10-03 14:52:29 +0800 <boomer_ish> @WayneHughes4 @BBCkatyaadler He sighed the WA based on the parallel PD document and the EU commitment to sn FTA like CETA  If the Eu follow through on their intentions, the IMB ismt needed.    But they are holding the U.K. to ransom to force LPF terms and extort fish.   Surely you can see that.

1312116937569136642 2020-10-03 03:47:10 +0800 <boomer_ish> @edmundmlawrence @johnredwood They apply different FTA and LPF rules to Japan and Canada.   Duplicitous to say they want level playing field.  Hardly level.  The EU has been nothing short of hostile in their respect for U.K. sovereignty

How‚Äôs that threat to move Euro clearing going? Now kicked out beyond 2022   Or all the 45000 estimated FS jobs based on more advantageous access fir Japan than the EU?
1311796945338413061 2020-10-02 06:35:38 +0800 <boomer_ish> @JSJTB @BBCkatyaadler And populism is also a term to diminish the result of the majority. Because the minority don‚Äôt agree with it.   So call it populist. Because then you can argue it‚Äôs not a valid result.   Sounds a bit like being un-democratic.
1311796361931698178 2020-10-02 06:33:19 +0800 <boomer_ish> @JSJTB @BBCkatyaadler Un democratic. A group of people in the minority don‚Äôt accept the majority and undermine the democratic result.   Pretty simple really.

Its a misleading stat comparing % of exports. Exports to the U.K. is on par with US  The Eu have buckled on FS. Frankfurt is behind Edinburg!!  It will be a series of mini deals.

1311789762727088131 2020-10-02 06:07:05 +0800 <boomer_ish> @JSJTB @BBCkatyaadler So terms like  ‚Äúbrexshitter‚Äù, uneducated or racist are acceptable?

LPF terms between Japan and the U.K. go further - as the deal is tailored to the U.K.  But they are still FTA type terms.   The point is EU demands on LPF include dynamic alignment on laws not made. And well beyond even what the U.K./Japan deal is

The irony that the EU want level playing field but more onerous ones beyond ‚Äúlevel‚Äù agreements with Canada and Japan suggests subjugation.

The EU have changed their position on 3rd party listing. One point to me.   The EU are insisting on access to U.K. sovereign waters as a fundamental right.  Also refusing to discuss CETA which TUSK committed too. So hostile.   Two points to me.

And it is relevant as you are either in the EU in which case your position on ‚Äúwe‚Äù makes sense   Or you are a treasonous remoaner who wishes the country they live in harm.   One I accept, the other is a coward.

The terms relate to a better deal. Cheaper goods to drive U.K. manufacturing, digital financial services.   Both sigh up to the terms. It protects us against Japan dumping. What‚Äôs the problem?

Another naysayer who believes a grandstanding remainer that made statements that are incorrect.   The U.K. is sovereign. And the WA says so. Case closed.   In any event, why should the EU break laws and negotiate in bad faith and assume the U.K. will roll over.

And a step to another 14% of global output in TPTPP which the the EU as a competitor can‚Äôt join.   Australia &amp; other commonwealth incl Canada imminant.   And the EU if they want to protect 80 bn trade surplus

Boris has a WA deal concocted by a remainer. But knows he has the legal right to override the WA.   We can assume U.K. law is sovereign, the same way the EU and Germany assume theirs is.

NATO  is responsible for peace.  Not the EU. We are a permanent member of the UN security council.   EU is now only 14% of global trade. Why do you lot insist on being part of a socialist superstate?

We pay tax and that‚Äôs what we get.   We chose to buy a car. If we can. We don‚Äôt get a tax refund.  My point is the state provides a good education. If you want a better one, where facilities cost more, then you pay

And then renegading on commitments that were the base of the U.K. signing the WA. Got it. You can‚Äôt be trusted either. Duplicitous or what

1306270800257875968 2020-09-17 00:36:42 +0800 <boomer_ish> @gary_d_carter @Peston @BorisJohnson Yes. But the tariffs charged go to HMRC. And can be used  to subsidise the customers costs mitigating the impact. Buying patterns will change and ultimately we will buy less from the EU. It‚Äôs not a zero  sum game.

1306268798077595649 2020-09-17 00:28:45 +0800 <boomer_ish> @Peston @BorisJohnson UK exporters face ¬£5.2 billion in EU tariffs. EU exporters face ¬£12.9 billion in U.K. tariffs.   Upshot is ¬£7.7 billion that can go into subsidies for U.K. consumers to offset increased consumer costs  One more reason why the EU want control via level playing field.

But the WA had the provisions to allow the U.K. to protect itself by making parliament sovereign over the WA. Marketing or not, the U.K. is allowed to protect it‚Äôs sovereign integrity.

The U.K. is seeking to protect its interests and NI. It still needs to follow a process to become law, and there are checks and balances.

But Khan is unilaterally reallocating 109 m to vanity initiatives. You seem to to think that the only thing is ‚Äúthrow money at it‚Äù. And not what policies apply

Stop and search is viewed as racist. Roads are a mess. He put congestion charging up. Not the Tories. One thing he is not is a scapegoat. He is spending money on the labour and minority vote to keep him in.

1305073998515101696 2020-09-13 17:21:03 +0800 <boomer_ish> @lucening @NeilGarratt @SuttonTories So because there isn‚Äôt a money tree, and unlimited money it‚Äôs all the Tories fault. It‚Äôs the application that matters. Khan is planning on cutting police services by ¬£ 109 m - but spends money on virtue signaling diversity ministers, PR etc
1305069819725836288 2020-09-13 17:04:26 +0800 <boomer_ish> @lucening @NeilGarratt @SuttonTories So what? Its a labour mayor. With a budget.
1305068850187325442 2020-09-13 17:00:35 +0800 <boomer_ish> @lucening @NeilGarratt @SuttonTories The UK was left with the highest public debt in history by labour. There is no money tree. The right question is how has public services money been managed in London. And what is Khan doing in policing. PR budget increase 85%.  Allows mass violent protests. Lame excuse

My point remains the EU  imposing new laws stops. As to the WA, it was negotiated in good faith, next to the PD. It‚Äôs true the terms were agreed. But EU are not negotiating trade in good faith, so HMG needs to protect UK

And the EU exports to the 5 th largest will drop. Tariffs for the U.K. will drop. The US export market is growing. And will do so even more. Keep your barriers. Protect inefficient CAP.
