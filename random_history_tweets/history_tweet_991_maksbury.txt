Maybe Tucker has become a bit too self-righteous thinking Sidney (or any lawyer) owes him a damn thing.

1325233867196919808 2020-11-08 08:29:10 +0800 <maksbury> @LarrySchweikart From what I've been reading from those smarter in these matters than myself, the typical election cycle would see apprx. 3% of these ballots.  In these states in question, the rate is over 18%.  That's not random.

1325175593227284483 2020-11-08 04:37:36 +0800 <maksbury> @RealEricCarmen @FoxNews Exactly right.  The only way Biden wins, the ONLY way, is if we the people actually accept that reality.

1324976411938054149 2020-11-07 15:26:08 +0800 <maksbury> @MZHemingway Almost. Not to be nitpicky, but fits more with fascists and communists.

1322770195501428736 2020-11-01 13:19:25 +0800 <maksbury> @PollWatch2020 In summation:  The number one issue with voters, by far, is the economy (and every poll shows Trump leading on this issue).  According to Gallup, 56% believe they're better off now than 4 yrs ago.  Trump is at nearly 50% job approval.  No way he loses without massive cheating.

1319873616817901569 2020-10-24 13:29:26 +0800 <maksbury> @YALiberty Really NYPD? This is your best? After all the BS your mayor has put you through, you're still going to act as his "jack-booted thugs"?  We #BackTheBlue , but not this sh*t. Shame on the lot of you.  @NYPDShea  @NYPDSpecialops  @NYPDDetectives  @NYPDChiefofDept  @NYPDCommAffairs
1319871523403026432 2020-10-24 13:21:07 +0800 <maksbury> @SHEPMJS No, but I'd bet it can ensure a campaign's inglorious defeat.  Ask Hillary how those never-ending ads she ran incessantly the last couple weeks in 2016 worked out for her.
1319746446413991941 2020-10-24 05:04:07 +0800 <maksbury> @Matthew_4_Trump @lorinda1434 It would never end were it left up to them. Already people are getting sick from regular influenza and pneumonia at an increased rate due to constant wearing of masks. But since these illnesses present much the same as the Chinavirus, guess what the diagnosis is? Never ending.

1318424813342511105 2020-10-20 13:32:25 +0800 <maksbury> @MaxBoot In China, you would have long ago been "disappeared" as your value as a "useful idiot" would have run out by now.  Be thankful you live in the land of Trump, where we instead just point and laugh at idgits like yourself.

1316201505146449922 2020-10-14 10:17:47 +0800 <maksbury> @dbongino Tends to happen often to arrogant people, especially the haughty ones like Kamala.
1315524082771820544 2020-10-12 13:25:57 +0800 <maksbury> @BrandonStraka Nope. Man up and do it live and in-person.   If you can't get on the stage and argue your position with knowledge and clarity under pressure, then you have no business occupying the most powerful position in the world.

1315178337078304768 2020-10-11 14:32:05 +0800 <maksbury> @jeneps More nonsensical evasion from Joe.   Let us know when he or  Kamala actually answer a question on policy other than a rehash of "you have to pass it to see what's in it."

Biden and the Democrat party are headed to a monumental defeat, don't fall for the gaslighting.  Simple question. Are the actions of the Democrats and their media indicative of a party that believes it's going to win, or one that is in desperation mode?

1311154272093040642 2020-09-30 12:01:53 +0800 <maksbury> @BillOReilly @Michelle_____24 Chris Wallace decided to step in early and block and tackle for Biden against Trump.  Big mistake Mr. Wallace and especially @FoxNews .
1311151648136454145 2020-09-30 11:51:27 +0800 <maksbury> @megynkelly Well, we tend to understand when you're having to battle against the referee as well.   Wallace was horrible, and obviously blocking for Biden.

1310472563760533504 2020-09-28 14:53:01 +0800 <maksbury> @johncardillo @KurtSchlichter The whole scenario is likely another hoax. No one has actually seen these tax returns and, if they do exist, what is actually on them.  All we have is their word. The *word* of the New York Times.  I put more trust in my neighbor's sneaky cat.
1310466419096727553 2020-09-28 14:28:36 +0800 <maksbury> @realchrisrufo Hire *professionals* to watch your back. These people don't go away, they lash out, and 2020 has proven they have no limits on their behavior.
1310464188486217728 2020-09-28 14:19:44 +0800 <maksbury> @maggieNYT You mean that our VSG president LAWFULLY reduced his federal tax burden to a smitten?   Sure we understand that. We want to hire him to do our taxes once he's done with being POTUS in another 4 years.  You people are so in a bubble it's ridiculous.

1309013660317241344 2020-09-24 14:15:51 +0800 <maksbury> @SHEPMJS Said to @LarrySchweikart the other day that Roy Moore has a better chance to win that seat via write-ins than Doug Jones has of retaining it. Doesn't matter what Jones does or does not do.

1307231273774088192 2020-09-19 16:13:17 +0800 <maksbury> @LarrySchweikart I live in Alabama.   Roy Moore has a better chance to win the seat via write-ins than Doug Jones has of keeping it.
1307209593257365505 2020-09-19 14:47:08 +0800 <maksbury> @BeauWillimon Just have to laugh at y'all and your *illusions of grandeur*.  You have no power to shut anything down but your own critical thinking, at which you seem to have succeeded.
1306862203086295041 2020-09-18 15:46:44 +0800 <maksbury> @Barnes_Law These positions require confirmation by a RINO/Deep State controlled Senate. Generally speaking, nominations that would be preferred by the people have next to zero chance to be approved by the McConnell senate.  Suspect things will be quite different in term # 2.
1306512028761284608 2020-09-17 16:35:16 +0800 <maksbury> @brithume @tullyframe He also told a congressional committee in March that healthy people should NOT wear masks.  6 months later, *safer than a vaccine*.  Why people even pay the CDC any mind at all is what baffles me.
1306511456725278720 2020-09-17 16:32:59 +0800 <maksbury> @brithume @tullyframe Well, you bought that masks work in the first place to prevent the spread/contraction of the virus despite literally decades of scientific data proving they do NOT prevent the spread of viruses.  So yeah, he probably expects you'll buy this latest horsesh*t as well.

Do any of you even know what the truth is, or what you actually believe any longer? Does it really even matter to you?  These are all rhetorical questions BTW. We already know the answer.  #scammers
1305404195248447489 2020-09-14 15:13:08 +0800 <maksbury> @marklevinshow It's Bloomberg, not exactly the most politically savvy individual out there.  How many tens (hundreds?) of millions did he waste in 2016, with his laughably shot presidential bid and then support of Hillary?  Florida is already lost for Biden anyway. More wasted $$.
1305402419107565568 2020-09-14 15:06:04 +0800 <maksbury> @Rockprincess818 Agree with the point, but hell is actually on their side.   What Trump will unleash will send the demons back where they belong.
1305031898276802560 2020-09-13 14:33:45 +0800 <maksbury> @kathrynw5 The simple (and correct) answer is, because he cannot.  You people have hitched your wagon to a busted locomotive. Sad!
1305016767140573184 2020-09-13 13:33:37 +0800 <maksbury> @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris You're exactly right Sleepy Joe, we do. Good thing we have @realDonaldTrump and @Mike_Pence at the helm.  BTW, it's laughable that you think people could even envision you *working*, let alone every minute of every day.  Your campaign, much like your entire career, is a scam.
1304685311021244416 2020-09-12 15:36:32 +0800 <maksbury> @MelissaRyan So if we don't approve of your friends/heroes diddling little boys and girls, that makes us *conspiracy theorists* ?  Yeah, go with that. We'll see what happens.

1303586746114994176 2020-09-09 14:51:14 +0800 <maksbury> @CNN Positive tests are NOT cases. And with many tests, the *positives* are often false or picking up antibodies from a previous infection.  How many of these children were actually sick or even symptomatic? Since you don't report that (fake news), I'm guessing the # is next to zero.

1302871018587987968 2020-09-07 15:27:11 +0800 <maksbury> @MayorOfLA Your friends in Beijing unable to send you more solar panels? Maybe you can get the Germans to send you more windmills?  The bad karma you people have accumulated I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
1302499013862871040 2020-09-06 14:48:58 +0800 <maksbury> @brithume Circular reporting is BS, not "playing it straight", Britt.   10+ people that were there are ON THE RECORD as saying it didn't happen, including Bolton.  Congrats to Fox News for joining the infamous "anonymous sources" parade with the rest of the fake news.  Good riddance.
1302490048265367552 2020-09-06 14:13:21 +0800 <maksbury> @DFBHarvard @timinhoustontex @FoxNews If this debacle isn't enough to convince Trump supporters that Fox News is NOT your friend, don't know what will.  For the love of all that is good, please turn off Fox News. (I understand tuning in for Tucker). Fox Business still has good folks.
1302486997488095233 2020-09-06 14:01:13 +0800 <maksbury> @catturd2 It would be better (and have a much larger impact) if the millions of Trump voters that watch Fox News actually quit watching Fox News.   Plunging Fox's ratings into a CNN-like nosedive will send a message they can't help but hear.
1302474240579571712 2020-09-06 13:10:32 +0800 <maksbury> @Mediaite That's a ridiculous statement on it's face.   If they're anonymous then of course they're *unimpeachable* because no one knows who the hell they are (or if they even exist).  Name the source and let the people determine if they are in fact, unimpeachable.
1302471418995789824 2020-09-06 12:59:19 +0800 <maksbury> @dbongino Does that include the talking heads at Fox News? Sure needs to.
1302152779805241344 2020-09-05 15:53:10 +0800 <maksbury> @SharylAttkisson @Barnes_Law Had his enemies picked battles where their charges had any substance, they might have had a bigger impact.   FIFY.
1302149003166060545 2020-09-05 15:38:09 +0800 <maksbury> @TheLastAnimeFan @mtracey Let's see:  1. Joe Hiden' can't even get through a teleprompter appearance without getting lost.  2. Nancy got set-up.  3. Trump appoints ambassador to Afghanistan whose top priority is getting our troops back home.  4. Job #'s released Friday are phenomenal.
1302148069044047873 2020-09-05 15:34:27 +0800 <maksbury> @mtracey @Barnes_Law "Desperate times call for desperate measures." - Democrats
1302142510878384128 2020-09-05 15:12:21 +0800 <maksbury> @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump And now @FoxNews has firmly established itself as part of that same MSM.   F'em.
1302141027931881473 2020-09-05 15:06:28 +0800 <maksbury> @LarrySchweikart It doesn't help if you're a Democrat that your leaders keep stepping on their own ordnance, thereby requiring the use of such tactics too early in the game.
1302128080056614914 2020-09-05 14:15:01 +0800 <maksbury> @JenGriffinFNC @JeffreyGoldberg Buh-bye @FoxNews, hope you enjoyed your time at the top.   You guys can fight it out with CNN and MSNBC for most hated tv news network.  *Anonymous FORMER officials* aka, disgruntled swamp creatures that were fired from their jobs.  Even John Bolton said it wasn't true FFS.
1302126762848145408 2020-09-05 14:09:47 +0800 <maksbury> @nypost Yeah, real difficult to say Hydroxychloroquine.   *Scientists*.
1302118546961563650 2020-09-05 13:37:08 +0800 <maksbury> @ABC Because there is no pandemic.   But I guess it's not really fair to expect fake news organizations to acknowledge reality.
1302115869317902336 2020-09-05 13:26:30 +0800 <maksbury> @MayorOfLA Only thing being spread around here is fascist bullsh*t by left-wing politicians like yourself. There is no pandemic, only the fear of one.  Karma is going to come down on y'all hard, looking forward to watching it.
1301795276764721152 2020-09-04 16:12:34 +0800 <maksbury> @mtaibbi @Barnes_Law Or, Trump has caused them in their insanity to reveal their true nature/agenda.  They didn't get played, they got exposed.
1301397408849506304 2020-09-03 13:51:35 +0800 <maksbury> @kanyewest @tracybeanz We keep trying to have it, Democrats keep burning it down.
1301369439028424704 2020-09-03 12:00:27 +0800 <maksbury> @RealMattCouch Yes, from Bama.
1300664439868358656 2020-09-01 13:19:02 +0800 <maksbury> @GregAbbott_TX @Trump5America You hope to provide updates in the next few weeks?  You're losing a ton of good will governor. This is NOT a pandemic, but the harm elected officials are doing by refusing to act boldly is a tragedy.
1300653010033442816 2020-09-01 12:33:37 +0800 <maksbury> @JoeBiden It's like you people are trying to lose.  If so, bang-up job so far, keep it up. üëçüá∫üá∏
1300650730899075072 2020-09-01 12:24:33 +0800 <maksbury> @JoeBiden He's been saying it from the beginning Sleepy Joe.   You should ask your handlers to let you out more.
1300649135230550018 2020-09-01 12:18:13 +0800 <maksbury> @PastorDScott Didn't exist?  That woman got more exposure than Oprah, Taylor Swift, or the Royal Family, combined.  Somebody should ask her how the country's first black president happened in such a systemically racist society (for two terms no less).
