It wasn't enough, so he voluntarily was vented.  Two days ago.  He did have heart and kidney issues,  apparently, but was not overweight.  Or old.  Only 55.

1343983214679887872 2020-12-30 02:12:23 +0800 <JardineKari> @JanieHsieh Considering one relative's friend survived with HCQ in March and my bro-in-law died without it yesterday, in Utah, I'd say @GovHerbert banning it had a negative impact on recoveries.
