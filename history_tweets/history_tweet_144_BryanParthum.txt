1342501828236365824 2020-12-26 00:05:52 +0800 <BryanParthum> We don’t celebrate many holidays, but we do celebrate being with friends and family however and whenever possible. Hope you all have a great rest of 2020, and a great start to 2021.  https://t.co/YpugDMRiaX
1341605274797391874 2020-12-23 12:43:17 +0800 <BryanParthum> @odysseusbostick Moving the staircase to the other side of the house, so blank canvas.  More importantly, where did your secret stairs lead!? I hope I find some.  https://t.co/GjtBFgtOyc
1341599692027785216 2020-12-23 12:21:06 +0800 <BryanParthum> In the interest of sharing non-econ things, we’re now homeowners of a home that is in disrepair. My favorite (and most affordable) kind.   In returning to my carpentry roots when the littles are asleep, I decided against CAD this time, will share drawings/pics as they come.  https://t.co/aWOFAIrjM7
1341597631060041728 2020-12-23 12:12:55 +0800 <BryanParthum> @willwheels @ArielOrtizBobea @grant_mcdermott Recent collab with someone who I later found out “translated all my DT to dplyr”... not going to lie, that one stung a little.   In the wake of that news, I’ve been coming around to dplyr when not too inconvenient
1339216041688375296 2020-12-16 22:29:20 +0800 <BryanParthum> The documentation and examples are outstanding. Pref-space, WTP-space, g/smnl, classical/bayesian, and even multi-threading built in!  This could be a great starter package for someone just getting into the field, experienced modelers the same.
1339213137032212480 2020-12-16 22:17:47 +0800 <BryanParthum> Neat new-to-me R package for choice models (Apollo:  https://t.co/gUhoJo9aAp)  RE: naming "The obvious choice would have been Cassandra, with her gift of prophecy and the curse that nobody listened to her (a bit like choice modellers trying to sell their ideas to policy makers)."

1337922913748606976 2020-12-13 08:50:54 +0800 <BryanParthum> @odysseusbostick Wait, I was promised that everything was better by the time they turn 6...
1337474310055878658 2020-12-12 03:08:19 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cagrainger (and why... clearly you need to assign some points somehow :-)
1337474105768095749 2020-12-12 03:07:30 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cagrainger If (when?) given the opportunity, what is a top proposal that you would make to address climate change? (can be a top-down policy or bottom-up behavioral change, or both)
1337441650583490560 2020-12-12 00:58:32 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cjwich @overleaf If it’s who I’m thinking of (also one of my awesome and more senior co-authors) I tried and couldn’t run away fast enough.
1337440579148460034 2020-12-12 00:54:17 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cjwich Have you checked out @overleaf?   ::runs away:::
1337070193076527108 2020-12-11 00:22:30 +0800 <BryanParthum> @nj_sanders @cjwich @JenniferRaynor_ In comparing PRISM with Shlenker’s data, the biggest discrepancy appears to be in daily precip. PRISM has many zeros as one would expect, but Shlenker’s precip is always greater than zero. Any thoughts on why?
1336866466155679746 2020-12-10 10:52:57 +0800 <BryanParthum> @ProfALanger Here at #enviroecontwitter we don’t just provide half-baked jokes, we also read minds!   On a slightly more serious (and less fun) note, I’m processing these sources and comparing them now-ish, let me know if I can send you something specific.
1336841937932914688 2020-12-10 09:15:29 +0800 <BryanParthum> @judebayham WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DAY, JUDE  Thanks, will see if I can get you a cite, too.
1336838642921312256 2020-12-10 09:02:24 +0800 <BryanParthum> My most productive hours of the day are between 5:30am and when my youngest rides his scoot bike full speed down a flight of stairs, and then again after they go to bed.
1336826878452248578 2020-12-10 08:15:39 +0800 <BryanParthum> @JenniferRaynor_ This actually would be helpful! I’ll send you a message, thanks!   Related, total precip from these makes sense right? As opposed to mean daily... seems like potential for flooding would be best represented by total.
1336825798968434689 2020-12-10 08:11:22 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cjwich @nj_sanders @JenniferRaynor_ If you’re a fan, did Casey let you down?
1336783064035454976 2020-12-10 05:21:33 +0800 <BryanParthum> @nj_sanders @cjwich @JenniferRaynor_ Awesome, thanks! Also citing you as personal communication
1336770609683034112 2020-12-10 04:32:04 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cjwich @JenniferRaynor_ @nj_sanders Screenshotting this and placing in the appendix.  That's my read (although, I could reach out and ask Wolfram). The raw data are simply matched with grid cells that *can* map to cropland acres. But that's optional (again, I think)
1336766205210800129 2020-12-10 04:14:33 +0800 <BryanParthum> @JenniferRaynor_ @nj_sanders @cjwich hm, this is an important question. The raw data provided on their site is not, I believe, yet weighted. The provided Stata code calculating deg. days does, however, weight by crop area. So for those of us wanting county averages, we can collapse the raw by FIPS... right?
1336730582588547075 2020-12-10 01:53:00 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DrNateme16 This is great. I hadn't had the opportunity to work with this yet, I'll check it out. Thanks! (and thanks @smkraus_)
1336682877321351168 2020-12-09 22:43:26 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cjwich @nj_sanders Okay great, so Wolfram has these pre-processed by county. Upside is they include tmin, tmax, and precip, all in one file each year. Downside seems to be a one year lag (no 2020). This is excellent, thanks!
1336679412947947522 2020-12-09 22:29:41 +0800 <BryanParthum> @nj_sanders @cjwich Follow up question: did I miss this becoming the standard? Looks like Wolfram fixes stations through time. Is reviewer 2 now going to criticize us for using PRISM?
1336678458651504640 2020-12-09 22:25:53 +0800 <BryanParthum> @nj_sanders Oh, no, I was just pulling straight from PRISM's API and processing myself. It's already running, but at 1.3 seconds per county per month, its takes a while (28 days). I'll check this out and see what Wolfram offers... thanks! (thanks, @cjwich, too)
1336671429069254657 2020-12-09 21:57:57 +0800 <BryanParthum> Data request: Anyone have daily PRISM weather data aggregated (sum, mean) at the county-level from 2003-present for all US counties?    Processing now, but it's about 3 weeks out from finishing. Looking for both temp and precip. Thanks!
1336670283999174657 2020-12-09 21:53:24 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cjwich Does this mean you need some research ideas? I have one that I think would be great for us, we just need about 15 RA's. (kinda joking, but still let me know when you have 15 available)
1336469017121402882 2020-12-09 08:33:38 +0800 <BryanParthum> @normalEconomist Right, I think they’ll still typically ask at proofs. Follow up with what happens here, thanks!  (I use viridis, but still keep two versions of each plot: BW, and color)
1336466869478449153 2020-12-09 08:25:06 +0800 <BryanParthum> @normalEconomist You’ll still have to submit grayscale, no?
1336457922130436096 2020-12-09 07:49:33 +0800 <BryanParthum> As a Bryan, I think @economeager's #amipmemes needs a Bad Luck Brian.  https://t.co/hPzVIlxqFG

1334545617339752448 2020-12-04 01:10:44 +0800 <BryanParthum> @economeager @Andrew___Baker lol. Thanks
1334544207650938883 2020-12-04 01:05:08 +0800 <BryanParthum> @joshshepperd only time I’ve seen one was skiing Cameron Pass. It crept by with a disapproving gaze, such a neat animal (and not a fan of backcountry skiers)

1333921244358582273 2020-12-02 07:49:42 +0800 <BryanParthum> @odysseusbostick “arguably” managing, until all your friends are back to doing fun things and you say “weeeellll...”  plus, did you factor in the cost of not being invited to all the fun things?

1333891778886373383 2020-12-02 05:52:37 +0800 <BryanParthum> @odysseusbostick right, but you’re not on the margin of not having a phone to having a phone...
1333515898318172168 2020-12-01 04:59:00 +0800 <BryanParthum> @RichardTol Is that the same as a benefit cross analysis?

1332524505714073601 2020-11-28 11:19:33 +0800 <BryanParthum> @pablohutch to be fair, productivity isn’t increasing in dark side
1332486750695010307 2020-11-28 08:49:32 +0800 <BryanParthum> @odysseusbostick No worries, it’s never a deal breaker/maker (or shouldn’t be), just free disposal. Full confidence you’ll do great, just prepare for your interviews with the “why”
1332485292608155649 2020-11-28 08:43:44 +0800 <BryanParthum> @odysseusbostick maybe R1 apps don’t need explanation, but for unique (and awesome) positions like fed or LA schools, it helps to know we weren’t just a data input into your job app script
1332483817165238274 2020-11-28 08:37:53 +0800 <BryanParthum> @odysseusbostick Generic is fine (many are). letters are just super helpful for communicating important info beyond credentials. It’s like getting the first five minutes of an interview before the interview. Take the op. to plant a seed of confidence that you’re excited to work with us!
1332458105154703367 2020-11-28 06:55:42 +0800 <BryanParthum> Glad to see this paper in print! Making choices is hard. It’s important to consider the complexity of your experiment design. Are you asking too much of your respondents?

1332433776861978627 2020-11-28 05:19:02 +0800 <BryanParthum> Great day reading cover letters (and the rest). Thank you to all the JMC’s who took the time to let us know why you’re interested in working for the EPA and why you would be a good fit. It helps and means a lot.

1328298278585298944 2020-11-16 19:26:02 +0800 <BryanParthum> @AlfredoPaloyo Same is true here in the US. For us, there is a lot more flexibility and political capital at the state level to get things passed.

(link below) seems that VSCode might be a better investment going forward (for those of us just getting started). Is that a fair assessment?   https://t.co/HeW9tFg4ED  https://t.co/4LK4KLJaP3
1319447965807923200 2020-10-23 09:18:03 +0800 <BryanParthum> @emmettboudgie Thanks!!
1319445442036436992 2020-10-23 09:08:02 +0800 <BryanParthum> @AmyEcon The world has enough “conventionally successful” folks... yours has been exponential
1319421133771472900 2020-10-23 07:31:26 +0800 <BryanParthum> @normalEconomist @pablohutch (because I have no idea)
1319420882880782336 2020-10-23 07:30:26 +0800 <BryanParthum> @normalEconomist @pablohutch Will report back with you both soon :-)
1319396815054266370 2020-10-23 05:54:48 +0800 <BryanParthum> @ChrisRackauckas Ha, thanks Chris! This is exactly what I needed at this stage.
1319393081649778694 2020-10-23 05:39:58 +0800 <BryanParthum> @vectornomist Great, thanks!! Will test drive tonight.
1319392903031103489 2020-10-23 05:39:15 +0800 <BryanParthum> @normalEconomist Well, I’ve been meaning to explore it for a while (some high-dim models etc.), but never justified it for most applications.   Now starting to build capacity to work with Mimi (SC-CO2) and don’t have much of a choice at this point 😄
1319390195003887620 2020-10-23 05:28:30 +0800 <BryanParthum> @normalEconomist REALLY!? Why did I not realize this...   Any shortcomings/incompatibilities you’ve found?
1319385188116422656 2020-10-23 05:08:36 +0800 <BryanParthum> Stepping in to Julia space... was hoping to use Spyder for reasons, but integration isn’t scheduled until the next release.  Anyone have favorite #JuliaLang IDE’s?
1319304286090727426 2020-10-22 23:47:07 +0800 <BryanParthum> @XiangBee Thanks, Xiang. Some are, some are less-so. One of the perks to location quasi-choice. Lots of hurt in CA/CO, hope things slow down soon.
1319292386481041409 2020-10-22 22:59:50 +0800 <BryanParthum> Update: 6,000 acres per hour are being burned here (just one of the catastrophic fires in CO rn). Went from 20k acres to 120k overnight (East Troublesome Fire)
1319179389276463105 2020-10-22 15:30:50 +0800 <BryanParthum> @danksterman Cy and Jess’ place, just around the corner from Amber and Mike’s (Tabernash, the Troublesome fire). Cameron is still creeping towards our place in Red Feather, too.
1319098393227124737 2020-10-22 10:08:59 +0800 <BryanParthum> I miss home everyday. Even more when I can’t be there to help friends and family. Winter can’t come soon enough this year.  https://t.co/UBFqn7eOqx

1319011739996966913 2020-10-22 04:24:39 +0800 <BryanParthum> @JaminSpeer Careful, you might get them as a reviewer. Be kind.
1319008049655328768 2020-10-22 04:09:59 +0800 <BryanParthum> Additionally, frequency plots (how many times each attribute level was chosen) are very informative and also rarely included. Please share the raw responses!
1319008047537229831 2020-10-22 04:09:59 +0800 <BryanParthum> CV/CE/survey folks: in a forthcoming paper, I included an appendix with the open-ended responses from respondents. I find these super interesting/insightful (and sometimes funny). However, I’ve only seen this a handful of times in other papers.   Why the holdout?
1318730697809534976 2020-10-21 09:47:53 +0800 <BryanParthum> @cjwich it is not.
1318724368357273606 2020-10-21 09:22:44 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DrNateme16 Ha, exactly! It’s a great look into *why* authors make various decisions when there is clearly no *right* one. Would be great for 2nd/3rd years to read more forwards like this
1318716772091035660 2020-10-21 08:52:33 +0800 <BryanParthum> Outstanding discussion on the current state of carbon pricing (models, approaches, and political tensions). If you missed it, check out @rff’s site for a replay and many more resources.
1318710871451947008 2020-10-21 08:29:06 +0800 <BryanParthum> Today's lesson: in a sea of abstracts, be the forward.
1318710870634041344 2020-10-21 08:29:06 +0800 <BryanParthum> "The first major decision that we made was to put most of the money from the contract into data collection in order to be sure to get the right data, knowing that this meant that WE WOULD LARGELY BE WORKING FOR FREE ON THE DATA ANALYSIS."  Value of time: Evidence from Fish Econ
1318710869644201994 2020-10-21 08:29:06 +0800 <BryanParthum> In lieu of an abstract, Carson, Hanemann, and Wegge (2009) provide a 5 page forward that is an emotional journey through the minds of three ardent researchers, leaving the reader with no choice but to read the rest of the paper.    https://t.co/jG4GH88OFU
1318623780881784833 2020-10-21 02:43:02 +0800 <BryanParthum> Cameron and James (1987): “...the product might be a close subs for one the consumer currently purchases regularly (e.g., transportation, beer, long dist phone calls, or weekly news).”   This year I have only purchased one of these things, very regularly.
1317934244749058049 2020-10-19 05:03:04 +0800 <BryanParthum> Reminder that 2020 is mental health awareness year. Check in with your friends!

1316355886563160065 2020-10-14 20:31:14 +0800 <BryanParthum> @clarkrushing I mean, it’s SO’s job to troubleshoot error messages, your job was to get them to a point where they trigger error messages... a job well done it sounds like
1314681203241484288 2020-10-10 05:36:39 +0800 <BryanParthum> @jonathaneyer @FishEcon Stucco? That’s why nobody is answering your calls.
1314680859388149764 2020-10-10 05:35:17 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DavidUbilava As soon as the idea comes to mind... go!
1313620966199767040 2020-10-07 07:23:38 +0800 <BryanParthum> @FishEcon (although I think right now we’re victims of the anti-science age)
1313619612345364480 2020-10-07 07:18:16 +0800 <BryanParthum> @FishEcon We are victims of the science age, oh yeah!
1313220023805259776 2020-10-06 04:50:26 +0800 <BryanParthum> @normalEconomist Effect of this ‘newfound’ skepticism on reporting practices: &gt; 0  (p=0.051)
1313084940171522049 2020-10-05 19:53:40 +0800 <BryanParthum> @causalinf FWIW, here at the EPA, we do in fact care about and research human health and the environment*  *Does not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the EPA
1312050158478204934 2020-10-02 23:21:49 +0800 <BryanParthum> @willwheels Jokes on you, I clicked on the wrong link, it’s one of your papers.
1312043277860900864 2020-10-02 22:54:28 +0800 <BryanParthum> And just when you think things couldn’t get any worse: “The functional form of the compensating variation equation is available from the authors on request.” #2020, amirite?
1312020157175394305 2020-10-02 21:22:36 +0800 <BryanParthum> @jcjohnsonmo Is this an acoustic coupler?  https://t.co/ghS0hAafU3
1312017039855431681 2020-10-02 21:10:13 +0800 <BryanParthum> Because reminding ourselves how far research/computation capacity has come, an excerpt from a 1990 fisheries paper: “The model, available with user manual and for use on an IBM or compatible personal computer...”
1311658918477791233 2020-10-01 21:27:10 +0800 <BryanParthum> @ErikAnsink @johnwhitehead81 @JaereAere Second this. “Guidance” is a great way to frame it (as titled). Authors might have perfectly reasonable reasons to deviate (budget, context, innovation, etc.). Reviewers should keep that in mind (authors too)
1311373847388663811 2020-10-01 02:34:24 +0800 <BryanParthum> Outstanding presentation today and seminar execution. If you’re wondering how you should organize your seminar everything (website, enrollment, participation and presentation), takes notes from #OARES
1311289504154693634 2020-09-30 20:59:15 +0800 <BryanParthum> @willwheels FWIW I almost unmuted to pick a side, but then I remembered I had coffee to sip.
1311286260183556096 2020-09-30 20:46:21 +0800 <BryanParthum> @gumburclies (FYI: don’t read the news today)
1311286075491524609 2020-09-30 20:45:37 +0800 <BryanParthum> @FishEcon lol. Exposure to a breadth of good music is very important. Maybe she’ll invent her own genre someday. Looking forward to it.
1311284209772908546 2020-09-30 20:38:12 +0800 <BryanParthum> Cruising down the beltway in the ‘87 Vanagon blasting Stevie Nicks’ Silver Springs and the 3yo insists we turn it up. Sometimes parenting just feels right.
1311145175083819008 2020-09-30 11:25:44 +0800 <BryanParthum> Finally watched Hamilton tonight. Wow. Outstanding. Did you all watch something different? Feeling real charged and optimistic... why’s everyone so gloom?
1310962179189940226 2020-09-29 23:18:34 +0800 <BryanParthum> @vini_singh44 @sethneller Similar thought where you create another group/facet of insignificant areas and force them to be white (or even use the % transparency to make them lighter).
1309506034004787201 2020-09-25 22:52:22 +0800 <BryanParthum> I had kids *just* so I could order off the kids menu. Was it worth it? Have you had that $3 mac’n’cheese?
1309259708700798977 2020-09-25 06:33:34 +0800 <BryanParthum> @pallavi_shukla1 no MySpace?
1309185969648787456 2020-09-25 01:40:33 +0800 <BryanParthum> @jonathaneyer Kerry told me he had his wife rip the gate off for him
1309099043130400777 2020-09-24 19:55:08 +0800 <BryanParthum> Explained how dual monitors work to my 3yo and they said it made sense. Should be a good day.   (I’m still not really sure how they work)
1308983726098001920 2020-09-24 12:16:54 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DavidUbilava @dlortega @JaysonLusk @VincenzCaputo The writeup is still a work in progress, but I promised you smth this week!😁🤙   https://t.co/zVkzaf52BO
1308982080710356993 2020-09-24 12:10:22 +0800 <BryanParthum> One of my fav courses to teach was Intermediate Micro. It is a pivotal class for many students where they decide 👍 or 👎 to econ. Someday I'll have a writeup of all of the games I used, but here is a useful (and fun) one. Feel free to make edits/revisions and distribute.

1307788055521251330 2020-09-21 05:05:44 +0800 <BryanParthum> @lynnelewis20031 @BatesCollege So we can have a house party? On my way!!
1307088057271812096 2020-09-19 06:44:12 +0800 <BryanParthum> @JamesBland_Econ And also temporally Pareto optimal (no less than 60% of my diet is things my kids didn’t eat, usually stale, cold, or both) eat that chip while it’s still good!
1307087273209606153 2020-09-19 06:41:05 +0800 <BryanParthum> @SteveDundas Wonderful! Glad to hear it. Our home canyon has been ablaze (Poudre in CO) and the snow came last week with a similar response from all of us.
1307084306049888256 2020-09-19 06:29:17 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DrMarcHafstead well, there was a point where I thought “man, Marc is really going for it this week” and then I thought “nice”
1307083479625216000 2020-09-19 06:26:00 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DrMarcHafstead I mean, it was kinda great
1307025351537840128 2020-09-19 02:35:01 +0800 <BryanParthum> Realizing quote was not on the flyer (from ResEcon listserve). Contact  https://t.co/UO1SRTRvY4 for info on env-econ specific PhD paths “..students will conduct research at the intersection of electricity technology, energy economics and policy, climate science, and social equity.
1307016286942171141 2020-09-19 01:59:00 +0800 <BryanParthum> This is a proactive approach to addressing both issues of diversity in our field and important research, nice work @resec_umass.   “We are hoping to recruit clusters of BIPOC students to help reduce the isolation these students can feel at majority-White institutions like UMass.”  https://t.co/zQ4bmOPNDl

1306689050884145152 2020-09-18 04:18:41 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DavidUbilava @dlortega @JaysonLusk @VincenzCaputo Sure thing... meant to write a JEE paper on it, but alas. Mostly put together, will make public and post here when I do (soon!)
1306623809458405381 2020-09-17 23:59:26 +0800 <BryanParthum> @ArielOrtizBobea @EconAnne That was also a nice escape, although, now I’d almost prefer reading excerpts from MWG over the news 🤣
1306615648798244866 2020-09-17 23:27:01 +0800 <BryanParthum> @EconAnne Read papers about topics that you find interesting, and be okay with not understanding methods/metrics of the papers (read once and move on). Helped me step back from proofs to see the bigger picture (and, to me, the fun part of research)
1306607951248056320 2020-09-17 22:56:25 +0800 <BryanParthum> @DavidUbilava @dlortega @JaysonLusk @VincenzCaputo Second this approach. I created a choice experiment “game” for my inter. micro students and administered through Qualtrics. You can then analyze their choices in a standard RUM framework and show them their WTP distributions for attributes. Can email you parts if interested!
1306411710199279616 2020-09-17 09:56:38 +0800 <BryanParthum> Listen, I have the results, they’re, uh, just at home. I’ll send them to the copy editor. Can I put this on my CV as forthcoming?
1306383425465716737 2020-09-17 08:04:14 +0800 <BryanParthum> @willwheels @Val_Mueller_ASU @cjwich Mr. Dr. Mueller

1306254731954839553 2020-09-16 23:32:51 +0800 <BryanParthum> @clarkrushing nothing wrong with raising a bayesian, Clark, you could learn something
1304164456205877248 2020-09-11 05:06:51 +0800 <BryanParthum> @jonathaneyer And transaction costs are infinite.

1303338771996454915 2020-09-08 22:25:52 +0800 <BryanParthum> The “you used 38% less energy than other energy-efficient homes in your neighborhood” notice is telling (our home is about as not-energy-efficient as it gets)
1303338769735655424 2020-09-08 22:25:52 +0800 <BryanParthum> Looks like it was another thrilling weekend on EconTwitter. Everybody talking about irrational car expenses but no mention of keeping your home at 68°F year-round.
1301577449914982403 2020-09-04 01:47:00 +0800 <BryanParthum> @pallavi_shukla1 do you want us to tell your family what you do all day, too, or nah

1301227599528689664 2020-09-03 02:36:50 +0800 <BryanParthum> @HaoluanWang Awesome, thanks!! This is leading down an interesting path, somewhat tangential to my original ask, but maybe more in line with what I (unknowingly) was looking for. Plus, back to early work on this with Manski 2004.    https://t.co/dRY2LlrLVE
1301199506076246017 2020-09-03 00:45:12 +0800 <BryanParthum> @FishEcon @johnwhitehead81 This is a problem because the discussion was helpful in characterizing what I was looking for AND provided links... now the beer tab is no less than several with no upper bound.
1301197781403602950 2020-09-03 00:38:20 +0800 <BryanParthum> @johnwhitehead81 This is really good... thank you. And yes, following the prolific pubs in her google scholar has been fruitful.
1301196646634729473 2020-09-03 00:33:50 +0800 <BryanParthum> @MaksymPolyakov Thanks!! Wondering if these get some at what I'm looking for (or think I'm looking for)... still trying to figure out if I'm interested in misinformation or uncertainty, these are great additions.
1301141942387068928 2020-09-02 20:56:27 +0800 <BryanParthum> @johnwhitehead81 X is insignificant anyway
1300947416263331841 2020-09-02 08:03:29 +0800 <BryanParthum> @willwheels All I hear these days is “it’s in a box in the office” and I just picture a room full of “you’re fired” boxes that you all forgot to grab on your way out the door.  https://t.co/tg5G8E0ljP
1300918373128249346 2020-09-02 06:08:04 +0800 <BryanParthum> @johnwhitehead81 Although I could imagine SP work that explicitly asks this question: “How much are you WTP to improve environmental quality even if there’s weak evidence linking it to mortality.” Almost nonuse, but not quite.
1300917100962340864 2020-09-02 06:03:01 +0800 <BryanParthum> @johnwhitehead81 Thank you!
1300916935589326848 2020-09-02 06:02:21 +0800 <BryanParthum> @johnwhitehead81 Makes sense, I’m not sure if there is a CV that would be considered less than causal (which is one reason I ask) and that request (1) might only relate to some reduced form hedonic/TCM type setting
1300895726101200897 2020-09-02 04:38:05 +0800 <BryanParthum> @FishEcon @johnwhitehead81 Only passively through asking all of Twitter, does that work?
1300888996667625473 2020-09-02 04:11:20 +0800 <BryanParthum> @Jess_Hoel @causalinf just went through quite a bit of this... any insight Scott?
1300866783600140289 2020-09-02 02:43:04 +0800 <BryanParthum> @CZimm_economist Right, thanks, expanding from an ongoing search. Didn’t start with econ twitter 😁
1300865238263361538 2020-09-02 02:36:56 +0800 <BryanParthum> Looking for papers that address:   1) ambiguity in WTP estimates from correlational (less than causal) studies; and/or   2) individual adjustment (discounting?) of WTP in the presence of outcome uncertainty.  Ideally in the context of nonmarket goods, SP/RP. Thanks, #EconTwitter!
