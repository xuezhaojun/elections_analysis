1341464825365291008 2020-12-23 03:25:12 +0800 <stephen_point> Senators claiming victory while people lose their homes! 600 bucks doesn‚Äôt even cover the lowest of rent Payments! I‚Äôm disgusted
1341147508689444864 2020-12-22 06:24:18 +0800 <stephen_point> If taxes are the price we pay to live in a civilized society then we are getting  absolutely ripped off!

1340801567029522433 2020-12-21 07:29:39 +0800 <stephen_point> Exactly I‚Äôve had to explain this to many people lately that say it‚Äôs proven fact... it‚Äôs not you‚Äôre just to lazy to look into it and realize they aren‚Äôt using sufficient data
1340357718444425216 2020-12-20 02:05:57 +0800 <stephen_point> @Alyssa_Milano There are no laws against you starting a relief fund and getting people to donate!

1340039128793182219 2020-12-19 04:59:59 +0800 <stephen_point> Straight from the horses mouth the goal is to redistribute wealth! This means taking from one person in order to give to others! It is not just!
1340037581187280898 2020-12-19 04:53:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @PioneerPress Of course they are! I would be upset too if I got paid regardless and all of a sudden had to start working again
1340022397919891456 2020-12-19 03:53:30 +0800 <stephen_point> So people are said to not care about grandma when trying to open business yet the CDC claims we shouldn‚Äôt care about grandma and no one is saying a word
1340022007249793024 2020-12-19 03:51:57 +0800 <stephen_point> It can‚Äôt be said enough... burn a business face no jail time... open a business and feel the full weight of the MN government... explain to me how this is fair someone please explain it @GovTimWalz @keithellison
1340020708542320643 2020-12-19 03:46:47 +0800 <stephen_point> Let‚Äôs start making people with herpes carry around a similar barcode...HIV too! Actually better yet let‚Äôs remove everyone‚Äôs sex organs to prevent the spread of these diseases from spreading... see how crazy that sounds!
1340017010801971201 2020-12-19 03:32:06 +0800 <stephen_point> This needs to be brought back
1340014665833664512 2020-12-19 03:22:47 +0800 <stephen_point> @AOC Tax revenue when up 133 billion from 2018 to 2019 so not sure on how your math shows a 2 trillion gap? But then unemployment is only down because people are working 2 jobs
1340007350078345217 2020-12-19 02:53:43 +0800 <stephen_point> @_RyanWinkler They are being sacrificed! It is not voluntary! They are given the choice between losing their business by staying closed or losing their business by trying to open! It‚Äôs essentially a prisoners dilemma
1339978828337139712 2020-12-19 01:00:22 +0800 <stephen_point> @BirkMatt Stu your a dentist not a doctor

1339806532544856065 2020-12-18 13:35:44 +0800 <stephen_point> Ask for evidence of claims that restaurants are causing all spreads and people not following guidelines are killing everyone and you get blocked... widely known information should be easy enough to present  https://t.co/OZs6JhBy0Y
1339803865785352192 2020-12-18 13:25:08 +0800 <stephen_point> @GoatMunch @janashortal Please provide your evidence and science on both of those false claims you are making

1339768943074889728 2020-12-18 11:06:22 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz 216 million for small business and 200 million to start building ‚Äúaffordable housing‚Äù maybe just open up businesses and we wouldn‚Äôt have this problem
1339750415227752450 2020-12-18 09:52:45 +0800 <stephen_point> @GoatMunch There is no such thing as the right to not get sick! Please show me the science that proves restaurants are the only ones spreading and please take into account how these were the only ones required to do contract tracing
1339749962276466689 2020-12-18 09:50:57 +0800 <stephen_point> @GoatMunch @janashortal There‚Äôs a difference in wanting to be a customer and owning a business and having your business ripped from you because the governor needs a scapegoat
1339674168523018241 2020-12-18 04:49:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @MNCovfefe @GovTimWalz He pulled the trigger too
1339669706391736320 2020-12-18 04:32:02 +0800 <stephen_point> Using a fictional character to fight a fictional crisis... couldn‚Äôt be more ironic
1339669405412646912 2020-12-18 04:30:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @janashortal @janashortal it‚Äôs comical you can‚Äôt see these people are doing this as a form of protest to stupid laws out in place! Also can you check if staying outside for an extended period of time increases your risk of cold or pneumonia ?
1339668640505860096 2020-12-18 04:27:48 +0800 <stephen_point> Look at the ever dishonest @_RyanWinkler  celebrating a business owner being taken to court over trying to open her business... here is the difference Ryan the health workers have a choice to go to work or not... the governor is not giving business owners that choice
1339667430071652352 2020-12-18 04:22:59 +0800 <stephen_point> It‚Äôs not a sacrifice when it‚Äôs forced! You are sacrificing them they are not sacrificing themselves voluntarily! This is what dictators do! Shut down businesses and then expect to be celebrated for giving them the crumbs or their own tax dollars
1339666588753006592 2020-12-18 04:19:39 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz How can they blame racism yet share no statistics on the people who are committing the crimes against these women ?
1339666322548932608 2020-12-18 04:18:35 +0800 <stephen_point> @LtGovFlanagan I‚Äôm sorry but for a report that says racisms is the root cause of this problem they don‚Äôt at all report on who is committing these crimes against these women. You would think that‚Äôs a viable stat. A more adequate stat would be Native men more likely to kill and abuse women
1339659641408475136 2020-12-18 03:52:02 +0800 <stephen_point> @Sorry4YourKids @FOX9 Mike still waiting on your response ? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs not one that has been impacted by covid regulations ?
1339658794494640128 2020-12-18 03:48:40 +0800 <stephen_point> Do people not see a problem with business being burned to the ground and Ellison doing nothing but if you open your business he will bring a lawsuit against you

1339574007373303809 2020-12-17 22:11:46 +0800 <stephen_point> That goes for you too politicians  https://t.co/SSi7pHMS8K
1339451186320007171 2020-12-17 14:03:43 +0800 <stephen_point> @esmemurphy @GovTimWalz Okay then how bout you only report from outside by a fire pit from now on the entire show! See how good that is for your health

1339425643511959553 2020-12-17 12:22:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @CruzTheSequel @rljourno That‚Äôs funny to you?! People losing their jobs and their life‚Äôs savings because the governor wants to use the hospitality industry as his scapegoat for his terrible LTC policies
1339425135191715840 2020-12-17 12:20:12 +0800 <stephen_point> Governors office kills 30+ jobs to flex his political muscles while not presenting justifiable data**
1339424237501599744 2020-12-17 12:16:38 +0800 <stephen_point> Imagine being this scared of a different opinion
1339418794238754817 2020-12-17 11:55:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @KathleenDoyAn @ErinMayeQuade That logic is pretty backwards! If you disagree with him your part of the group that believes eating at a restaurant kills grandma... it‚Äôs not okay for people to support their local restaurants but if you want to spite @BirkMatt then it‚Äôs justified
1339418183912996867 2020-12-17 11:52:34 +0800 <stephen_point> @alysemayequade @ErinMayeQuade Please enlighten me on how this is solely restaurants fault and can‚Äôt be traced to Walmart or Target or careless LTC policies. Also please take into account restaurants are the only ones required by the state to do contract tracing the big box stores aren‚Äôt
1339409159175897090 2020-12-17 11:16:43 +0800 <stephen_point> @ErinMayeQuade Oh thank goodness 1 Friday that‚Äôs 40 degrees for a couple hours is for sure going to save all of the restaurants! You can‚Äôt be that ignorant?
1339407975337713666 2020-12-17 11:12:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @rljourno Losing your life savings, your employees jobs, and your livelihood isn‚Äôt worth trying to prevent people from getting sick when everyone else is going to the mall of America, Walmart and Target
1339374828818636801 2020-12-17 09:00:18 +0800 <stephen_point> The kind dictator is allowing you to eat outside in the middle of the winter... because it‚Äôs not like cold weather hurts your immune system or anything

The point of title 9 is to give girls a chance at scholarships in sports... now we are letting a biological man take away scholarships...I will call you whatever pronoun you want out of respect but biology matters in athletics
1337512423587151872 2020-12-12 05:39:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @TheoKeith Why make a decision now and allow people to criticize him when he can make it right before the holiday so people don‚Äôt have a chance to change their plans

1337506401472696328 2020-12-12 05:15:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @SWitHBeAtZ @DanielJetsSkis @stoolpresidente There is no doubt our education system has failed us! But not for this reason ! I apologize for questioning government and asking for data for their decisions! I will go back in my place and never question them again! They can have all my freedoms
1337505673039503362 2020-12-12 05:12:56 +0800 <stephen_point> @DanielJetsSkis @SWitHBeAtZ @stoolpresidente It‚Äôs also the point that if you have pre existing conditions you are the one that should choose to quarantine and not make everyone else shut down! I‚Äôm not shaming people that want to quarantine that is there choice! I just want the others to have a choice too
1337505356247932934 2020-12-12 05:11:41 +0800 <stephen_point> @DanielJetsSkis @SWitHBeAtZ @stoolpresidente Not if you died from heart attack and happened to have COVID or in a motorcycle crash and had covid

1337502379747336192 2020-12-12 04:59:51 +0800 <stephen_point> @SWitHBeAtZ @DanielJetsSkis @stoolpresidente Weird I ask for data and you bow out of the conversation! SCIENCE! Heads up economics is a science too and when our economy collapses and it impacts your corporate job let me know how it‚Äôs going
1337501955137007616 2020-12-12 04:58:10 +0800 <stephen_point> Told you Tim Walz was going to go after ice fishing! Just wait until Ice houses are banned! ‚ÄúConfined area ‚Äú excuse
1337501578119397378 2020-12-12 04:56:40 +0800 <stephen_point> @SWitHBeAtZ @DanielJetsSkis @stoolpresidente Car accident! Which was not the case for the guy killed on his motorcycle and covid listed as the cause
1337501385596620802 2020-12-12 04:55:54 +0800 <stephen_point> @SWitHBeAtZ @DanielJetsSkis @stoolpresidente Please present the data on this would be thrilled to see it! Especially since most states don‚Äôt even have this data
1337501164472913920 2020-12-12 04:55:01 +0800 <stephen_point> @DanielJetsSkis @SWitHBeAtZ @stoolpresidente COVID alone ? Or covid with all those other pre existing conditions ? If someone dies of a heart attack and tests positive for covid what‚Äôs listed on the death certificate?
1337500737882845184 2020-12-12 04:53:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @DanielJetsSkis @SWitHBeAtZ @stoolpresidente Restaurants are also the only ones required to do contact tracing... any thought in that skewing that data? Do we know that someone who test positive for covid on Saturday got it running errands at Walmart or if they got it at a restaurant?
1337499167451611136 2020-12-12 04:47:05 +0800 <stephen_point> @DanielJetsSkis @SWitHBeAtZ @stoolpresidente If you are that alarmed by covid why aren‚Äôt you getting upset that Walmart is open that people are still allowed to fly ? Why only pick on the small businesses that can‚Äôt fight back ?
1337498148147630080 2020-12-12 04:43:02 +0800 <stephen_point> @JaniceFinnerin Yes complaining about our lack of voter ID laws in some states

1337490012334518279 2020-12-12 04:10:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @tammshort @stoolpresidente So attack the small businesses that have gone to every length to make their business covid safe... it can‚Äôt get you at Walmart or target, can‚Äôt get you on a plane, can‚Äôt get you at a protest!

1337486241088983042 2020-12-12 03:55:43 +0800 <stephen_point> Day in and day out the hypocrisy continues to grow!
1337485970841604096 2020-12-12 03:54:39 +0800 <stephen_point> Yes please
1337485328534237185 2020-12-12 03:52:06 +0800 <stephen_point> Good for them!
1337484567620378624 2020-12-12 03:49:04 +0800 <stephen_point> @dbongino Worse than that they move away from these states and cities and bring their terrible voting with them! Don‚Äôt they realize the reason it went to shit was that they keep voting for Dems
1337484252863086594 2020-12-12 03:47:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @JaniceFinnerin Not clear on your point of saying you can shop elsewhere?! I wasn‚Äôt attacking Costco I was making a point about having a valid photo ID should be required to vote
1337483956661284864 2020-12-12 03:46:39 +0800 <stephen_point> @KSTP Get lost with this bull shit! Keep spreading the fear!
1337483364408852481 2020-12-12 03:44:17 +0800 <stephen_point> Does this mean he has to return his Emmy ?
1337482962514763777 2020-12-12 03:42:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @SWitHBeAtZ @stoolpresidente If you can pay for it you should absolutely get that benefit! That‚Äôs like saying if you get in a car accident you shouldn‚Äôt get health care you know the risk of driving!
1337482659870621698 2020-12-12 03:41:29 +0800 <stephen_point> @Ruland33 @stoolpresidente Your an idiot! Pelosi refused to do anything before the election! It‚Äôs both sides fault and one side is the one enforcing lockdowns
1337482389971296256 2020-12-12 03:40:25 +0800 <stephen_point> @juanchouribe @stoolpresidente Show me in the constitution where it says a right to health care
1337482240083644416 2020-12-12 03:39:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @saffronrabbit @stoolpresidente You can have care without shutting down businesses
1337481974492004354 2020-12-12 03:38:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @JasonZagami @stoolpresidente @LGAairport One has a lot more lobbying power with the government and they don‚Äôt give a shit about the small businesses
1337481811002212353 2020-12-12 03:38:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @tanner22x @stoolpresidente Small business are considered corporations legally speaking so you sound like an idiot when you say that
1337481662536372224 2020-12-12 03:37:32 +0800 <stephen_point> @IC_Champ @stoolpresidente WRONG! We don‚Äôt need the government to destroy businesses off of faulty data. If you are scared lock yourself down in your house and you won‚Äôt get covid
1337481355639156736 2020-12-12 03:36:19 +0800 <stephen_point> @matthew_furman_ @stoolpresidente Right because that‚Äôs an equivalent to eating at a restaurant ?!? But let me ask you this is the only reason you aren‚Äôt injecting heroin into your veins because it‚Äôs illegal or is it because you‚Äôve seen the data on how harmful it is and you made your own choice ?
1337480989157650432 2020-12-12 03:34:51 +0800 <stephen_point> @berndt95 @stoolpresidente Hundreds of billions eh? Small business are considered corporations too buddy so your stats may be confused! I agree the federal government hasn‚Äôt supported them but one side has refused to do anything until after the election playing politics
1337480507890651138 2020-12-12 03:32:56 +0800 <stephen_point> @canchip2 @stoolpresidente @realDonaldTrump Not his ‚Äúboy‚Äù! Dave is trying to help small businesses being crushed go cry about the president somewhere else
1337480297336619009 2020-12-12 03:32:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @MauiMeow00 @stoolpresidente Half the nation? Really where is your data on that ? Would love to see prove half the nation isn‚Äôt wearing masks! It‚Äôs basically required everywhere now you can‚Äôt be that simple minded to think that‚Äôs the sole reason
1337479908138729472 2020-12-12 03:30:33 +0800 <stephen_point> @tammshort @stoolpresidente He‚Äôs talking about the restaurant owners! They are suffering more than your husband so please have some empathy it‚Äôs not one vs the other it‚Äôs us vs the government shit downs
1337479606983557120 2020-12-12 03:29:22 +0800 <stephen_point> @stoolpresidente It‚Äôs happening in MN too!   https://t.co/GeX98UjZIY
1337472280989822978 2020-12-12 03:00:15 +0800 <stephen_point> Happy Friday! With more shut downs looming I would love hour support by buying a shirt or anyone of our 26 products with this design   https://t.co/h72ycFz6zM
1337471558000865280 2020-12-12 02:57:23 +0800 <stephen_point> @JaniceFinnerin You also have the choice to get a government issued ID if you want to vote!
1337471287476699138 2020-12-12 02:56:18 +0800 <stephen_point> @stoolpresidente Doing what I can to help small business shut down in MN! Would love a RT @stoolpresidente    https://t.co/GeX98UjZIY
1337435603231641601 2020-12-12 00:34:30 +0800 <stephen_point> @Quiggling First off that‚Äôs the point it was a fictional comedy! Second, are they required to take these hormonal drugs in order to play with women? Or can they say they are women and compete against women ?
1337433937635803136 2020-12-12 00:27:53 +0800 <stephen_point> @bradleygallo you really put green hornet in your bio ?
1337433516976455680 2020-12-12 00:26:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @Quiggling @lightndns48 Yes had nothing to do with the testosterone he was taking
1337369039857799168 2020-12-11 20:10:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @istisbitchcryin @enderstqr Because one crime was committed in 2018 and the other was 1999! It‚Äôs not hard to comprehend that it takes a long time to go through appeals. Timing is your answer not race
1337367917369806848 2020-12-11 20:05:33 +0800 <stephen_point> Remember when we made movies about guys dressing like girls to dominate sports...soon we will have documentaries instead of fictional comedies #tulsi  https://t.co/ucXIGnQvW7
1337366984908890112 2020-12-11 20:01:50 +0800 <stephen_point> Why is this even an argument! I thought the democrats were the party of science yet they refuse to believe your biological gender impacts your physical ability
1337279072364232707 2020-12-11 14:12:30 +0800 <stephen_point> @DuhPrune @AmericanDrones @realDonaldTrump Lol signatures need to be verified to recall a politician but not to elect a president sad day
1337278743648223233 2020-12-11 14:11:12 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN @AOC @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley Lol that is what‚Äôs happening and when you did it the last 4 years the media backed you
1337258205521477633 2020-12-11 12:49:35 +0800 <stephen_point> @MNCovfefe @PioneerPress True! Have you ever tried to eat at a restaurant with a butt plug in... not enjoyable haha
1337257849865469954 2020-12-11 12:48:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @SKihne What is the best way to do this ?
1337256172169019393 2020-12-11 12:41:31 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN Lol Facebook and google aren‚Äôt going to like that last one!
1337255874268524550 2020-12-11 12:40:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @SaritaJacques @IlhanMN So why not just cut the income tax for everyone then people can pay these their student loans and have money to invest in businesses ? Canceling student loans just increases taxes for those businesses
1337252776217198593 2020-12-11 12:28:01 +0800 <stephen_point> If you are shouting about abolishing the death penalty and support pro-choice you are saying you value convicted criminals over innocent children and I will never understand that thought process
1337252052133548033 2020-12-11 12:25:08 +0800 <stephen_point> Restaurant owners need to follow suit! ... no pun intended
1337251301269237760 2020-12-11 12:22:09 +0800 <stephen_point> Something interesting I noticed today... costco requires a government  issued photo ID to get a membership card... this means there are more stringent policies to get a Costco membership than to vote in some states ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  https://t.co/JHubUq5ylZ
1337250090092646401 2020-12-11 12:17:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @pixie__park @JSharkbite @ACLU Because an innocent child is much different than a convicted murder
1336830090605293568 2020-12-10 08:28:25 +0800 <stephen_point> Weird! Now they are reporting on it
1336823974886473733 2020-12-10 08:04:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @EducationMN And the government had helped them boost their profits by shutting down the little guys
1336779344522268672 2020-12-10 05:06:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher They are all over the covid cases though
1336717839353278464 2020-12-10 01:02:22 +0800 <stephen_point> @JoeBiden All these places already have masks so what is this accomplishing
1336533988882534406 2020-12-09 12:51:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN Good thing  trump didn‚Äôt start any new wars
1336452199673524224 2020-12-09 07:26:49 +0800 <stephen_point> Don‚Äôt worry @MayorFrey ‚Äòs dancing is going to save us all! Ignore him shutting down tax paying business owners  and allowing police precincts to be burned to the ground his political pandering will for sure be the answer to saving Minneapolis
1336447915523497991 2020-12-09 07:09:47 +0800 <stephen_point> But they can‚Äôt afford to because of all the taxes imposed! We need people to understand this! And understand the Amazon‚Äôs of the world can afford this but your local market cannot! So stop taxing small businesses to death if you hate the 1%
1336447914273624064 2020-12-09 07:09:47 +0800 <stephen_point> The taxes the employer and employee has to pay. It cost an employee 43,750 to pay a salary of 35,000 and the employee only gets about 28,000 after taxes! That‚Äôs about 15,000 (gap) caused by taxes! I know a lot of employers that would love to hire more employees or even pay more
1336447911832526849 2020-12-09 07:09:46 +0800 <stephen_point> For all the people that love minimum wage increases and increase taxes on corporations please read this and understand it! There is a gap between  what the employee believes is a fair wage and what the employer believes the employee is worth paying! That ‚Äúgap‚Äù is due to  https://t.co/zL8YPjaWUP
1336445501781250050 2020-12-09 07:00:12 +0800 <stephen_point> @trishanderton @HypeHouseGOP @mojo_girl @laylrs @NBCNewYork You‚Äôre an idiot when you say the only fair move is to tax the rich! It doesn‚Äôt work that way it never ever will! As explained with payroll and sales tax it will always just increase the cost! Removing taxes will lower cost to consumers and also allow for competition
1336444869275947009 2020-12-09 06:57:41 +0800 <stephen_point> @AOC Hey @AOC quick question... who does the government collect sales tax from ?  Answer: The business owners. Who pays the tax at point of sale: the consumers!   No matter who you tax it will alway increase the cost of goods sold it‚Äôs not hard to figure out

1336110080899436544 2020-12-08 08:47:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @MarielleMohs @WCCO They won‚Äôt be able to! All the restaurants have been shut down and most places are work from home! @GovTimWalz  and @MayorFrey haven‚Äôt done anything to help them and they have been shut down since March
1336088022459310087 2020-12-08 07:19:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @Ilhan Any comment on your husbands company receiving PPP loans while getting paid millions by your campaign ?

1336081747474145281 2020-12-08 06:54:46 +0800 <stephen_point> Your job when dressing up as Santa is to say you will try to get them the gift and smile for pictures not to push your political opinion!
1336077625710690304 2020-12-08 06:38:23 +0800 <stephen_point> @rljourno @MNReformer Great article now do one on @keithellison and his personal life and history of beating his girlfriend
1336074716252045312 2020-12-08 06:26:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @realmnsportsfan The design is available on shirts, sweatshirts, phone cases etc. plenty of great options for stocking stuffers
1336074476287524864 2020-12-08 06:25:52 +0800 <stephen_point> @Shooters_Wife Available on 26 different items! Make for great stocking stuffers!
1336052994975150082 2020-12-08 05:00:31 +0800 <stephen_point> How long until AOC and Ilhan Omar are chanting Free Christmas lights for all! Would probably already be happening if the didn‚Äôt hate Christians
1336052531575705601 2020-12-08 04:58:40 +0800 <stephen_point> Not sure why this keeps needing to be said but the government CAN NOT  give you anything that they haven‚Äôt TAKEN from someone else!    There is no such thing as Free there is only redistribution of wealth!
1336052180772560897 2020-12-08 04:57:17 +0800 <stephen_point> Maybe she should stop funneling money to her husbands company and allowing them to rip off tax payers with PPP and then she could use it to help the people in need instead of always making the tax payers do it!
1336051322815094784 2020-12-08 04:53:52 +0800 <stephen_point> They are a disgrace and clearly don‚Äôt care about the community they are supposed to be serving! Go look at the crime rates increasing!  Less police is not the answer!
1336051035475902464 2020-12-08 04:52:44 +0800 <stephen_point> @thauserkstp I‚Äôll spare you the suspense they will be shut down for longer
1336050900998082561 2020-12-08 04:52:12 +0800 <stephen_point> This is disgusting! @mnhealth trying to make light of the skyway being shut down when these small businesses especially restaurants have been closed since March and @MayorFrey and @GovTimWalz  haven‚Äôt addressed it! Not even for a phony photo op!  https://t.co/PaQU0f2DK1
1336047058273271808 2020-12-08 04:36:55 +0800 <stephen_point> @beg_ulug I‚Äôm pissed off he‚Äôs calling people upset about their business being forced to shut down babies! And pointing out how big of a hypocrite he is. Not upset that he‚Äôs ‚Äúspreading the virus‚Äù we‚Äôre on the same side bud
1336037604383367168 2020-12-08 03:59:21 +0800 <stephen_point> He is literally making these jokes in front of a live audience sitting next to someone without a mask on! What an ignorant prick
1336036558659407872 2020-12-08 03:55:12 +0800 <stephen_point> Coincidence that flu is at an all time low the same time covid is at an all time high?
1336035947373162496 2020-12-08 03:52:46 +0800 <stephen_point> ‚ÄúNo one has died of influenza‚Äù maybe just maybe that‚Äôs because we‚Äôre classifying any death from sickness as a covid death
1336033697955344384 2020-12-08 03:43:50 +0800 <stephen_point> Imagine getting paid to dress up as a mythical person and thinking that gives you the authority to tell kids what they can have for Christmas! I hope this kids parents buy him a full artillery of nerf guns
1336022409313353729 2020-12-08 02:58:59 +0800 <stephen_point> Yet if you try to open your business and contribute to society you could face jail time or heavy fines! Please stop with the hypocrisy
1336005493165150210 2020-12-08 01:51:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher  you nervous?
1335998784958910465 2020-12-08 01:25:06 +0800 <stephen_point> For every asshole that says that people are to scared to go to restaurants and that‚Äôs why they are suffering please read this and realize it‚Äôs the governors lockdowns that are killing them
1335997320458948608 2020-12-08 01:19:17 +0800 <stephen_point> @MattWalshBlog Also super surprised she doesn‚Äôt have a wedding ring on
1335996747533799425 2020-12-08 01:17:00 +0800 <stephen_point> This is the generation that we battling when it comes to votes!  ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt let it inflate‚Äù ‚ÄúJust pay everyone $20/hr‚Äù ‚ÄúJust make healthcare free‚Äù ‚ÄúJust make college free‚Äù   Economics is a science this is the equivalent to saying let‚Äôs just turn gravity off then we could all fly
1335995710366334978 2020-12-08 01:12:53 +0800 <stephen_point> @andrew_schinds Honestly worth calling it a sick day and going back home
1335977230845894657 2020-12-07 23:59:27 +0800 <stephen_point> I know homeschooled kids have a stereotype of not being social but honestly I think I would take that risk with my kids
1335367553267294208 2020-12-06 07:36:49 +0800 <stephen_point> 100% tough to watch I feel for her
1335275401355018240 2020-12-06 01:30:38 +0800 <stephen_point> @AOC Now sit down and think about why the cost of college has exploded! Go look at what‚Äôs changed and what government has done and you will realize government created the problem and now they are depending on tax payers to bail them out
1335274926677262339 2020-12-06 01:28:45 +0800 <stephen_point> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden And 47 till you become 47th
1335117344327180288 2020-12-05 15:02:34 +0800 <stephen_point> @RyanVernosh Look at you using all the politically correct terms! How about this... don‚Äôt shove college down kids throat as the road to salvation and their only option outside of school! Teach them that a 40,000K loan accruing interest at 7%  is a financial death sentence!
1335114413427212288 2020-12-05 14:50:56 +0800 <stephen_point> @BirkMatt Of course this guy is in education and a packer fan!  Ignorant to the core believing Matt Birks Twitter is killing people! Dumbass probably thinks he‚Äôs an owner or the packers too lol
1335110168854425602 2020-12-05 14:34:04 +0800 <stephen_point> I agree with them! The reason colleges say they charge so much is for ‚Äúlife experience‚Äù teaching life skills and collaborating with others! You legit could get a better education from YouTube than online classes
1335109384112799744 2020-12-05 14:30:56 +0800 <stephen_point> @ericowensdc @thauserkstp The same reason surgeons wear latex gloves they are dealing with open wounds, bodily fluids up close and personal so unless people start randomly bleeding on people due to covid your point is fucking idiotic
1335108827432173568 2020-12-05 14:28:44 +0800 <stephen_point> I don‚Äôt believe in this many coincidences!
1335108603389218817 2020-12-05 14:27:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @stoolpresidente Just like this scumbag!   https://t.co/h72ycFz6zM
1335108419309555713 2020-12-05 14:27:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @stoolpresidente That guy is a ducking clown! Just like the governor of MN    https://t.co/h72ycFz6zM
1335107584257232898 2020-12-05 14:23:47 +0800 <stephen_point> @stoolpresidente @YoungPageviews Being in sales I‚Äôve seen this situation so many times. Rep has a good month or a good year and they get comfortable and turn on autopilot but they don‚Äôt realize when you do well your quota goes up! Dumb move by YP to not post on BF especially when they can track it
1335029650532134913 2020-12-05 09:14:06 +0800 <stephen_point> Science and data!
1334931774686732288 2020-12-05 02:45:11 +0800 <stephen_point> Wait the left is making decisions based off emotions and not logic! SHOCKED
1334930395951853568 2020-12-05 02:39:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @BirkMatt Lol that they think it‚Äôs a punishment to not give you the covid vaccine! You mean I don‚Äôt have to get injected with something that we aren‚Äôt sure of long term effects damn I‚Äôm really missing out
1334922285598195712 2020-12-05 02:07:29 +0800 <stephen_point> If a biden Mask mandate is his idea of ‚Äúcrushing the virus‚Äù he‚Äôs an idiot! Most states mandate masks and the ones that don‚Äôt technically have one they leave it to the counties which most have mandates anyway! This solves nothing except giving more power to the federal government
1334919964126429185 2020-12-05 01:58:15 +0800 <stephen_point> @PioneerPress How is this supposed to make an impact ?
1334886866588332032 2020-12-04 23:46:44 +0800 <stephen_point> 1K followers in 7 months on Twitter! Thank you for all the follows and to everyone that has purchased a Tim Walz clown shirt or mask!   There are 26 other items you can buy the design on! Find them at my Redbubble store here    https://t.co/GeX98UjZIY
1334718621856067587 2020-12-04 12:38:11 +0800 <stephen_point> This option takes out the middle man that is the government! Instead of taking from certain Americans and giving to others you just take less money from everyone and allow individuals to choose how they spend the money they earn!
1334718620916563968 2020-12-04 12:38:11 +0800 <stephen_point> That is a difference of $3,900  This way people with student loans have more income to pay their loans and spend elsewhere. People that don‚Äôt have student loans don‚Äôt feel like they are being taxed more to pay for other peoples loans and they keep  more of their own money
1334718619939348481 2020-12-04 12:38:11 +0800 <stephen_point> Thread on student loans!   The average monthly student loan payment is around $337. About 4K per year.  The average salary for someone with a college degree is about $65,000. Right now they pay 22% in federal income tax $14,300/year   If we reduce that to 16% they pay 10,400
1334712137290186752 2020-12-04 12:12:25 +0800 <stephen_point> @AOC I get it you worked a tough job but so have plenty of Americans that didn‚Äôt sell out to get rich in politics and tell other people how to spend their money
1334708665501171712 2020-12-04 11:58:38 +0800 <stephen_point> Yup
1334707990251720705 2020-12-04 11:55:57 +0800 <stephen_point> Gavin the Grinch strikes again
1334707163663515648 2020-12-04 11:52:40 +0800 <stephen_point> @BrandonStraka @CNN @MSNBC @PolitiFact @snopes These ballots were sent in from covid positive patients and needed to be counted in isolation to prevent the spread of a disease
1334706442972979200 2020-12-04 11:49:48 +0800 <stephen_point> @BernieSanders Name a time he used his power to restrict the rights or the American people
1334705952608514049 2020-12-04 11:47:51 +0800 <stephen_point> @JoeBiden Good call get rid of the progressive income tax and stop punishing people for working harder and making more money
1334705638849404931 2020-12-04 11:46:36 +0800 <stephen_point> Hahahahaha they gave him a Truth and Justice award! That is comical!
1334639816147779585 2020-12-04 07:25:03 +0800 <stephen_point> @FoxNews Most states already have mandates and it‚Äôs not helping why does the federal government getting involved make it better? The only thing I see happening is now threatening it being a federal crime to not wear one which is alarming
1334637263632834561 2020-12-04 07:14:54 +0800 <stephen_point> As possible and are able to write a lot more off. Small businesses do not have this capability and it will crush them! If you want employees to be paid more then stop crushing small business with taxes
1334588800693981184 2020-12-04 04:02:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @ewarren Why don‚Äôt we just abolish the income tax then ?
1334356786992664576 2020-12-03 12:40:23 +0800 <stephen_point> What is bail set at for opening a restaurant ?
1334356726817017856 2020-12-03 12:40:09 +0800 <stephen_point> @SKihne What is bail set at or opening a restaurant ?
1334356551532859392 2020-12-03 12:39:27 +0800 <stephen_point> Hahaha they are very out of touch if they think those 3 will help convince people it‚Äôs not a a government conspiracy... I‚Äôm not saying it is but you honestly couldn‚Äôt pick 3 worse people
1334354617396707330 2020-12-03 12:31:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @thewillwitt Release all the conspiracies and secrets
1334354497456406531 2020-12-03 12:31:17 +0800 <stephen_point> @thewillwitt Abolish the income tax
1334323734300114945 2020-12-03 10:29:03 +0800 <stephen_point> @KamalaHarris Then stop taxing the hell out of the people trying to pay the working people
1334323470717526019 2020-12-03 10:28:00 +0800 <stephen_point> Don‚Äôt get your hopes up! @GovTimWalz will for sure say sitting in an ice house with anyone outside your home spreads covid and he will ban it! Which will be terrible for northern MN
1334320731212062720 2020-12-03 10:17:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @Katheri00900440 @BLovaney @AdamInHTownTX @IlhanMN The property owners have employees and other bills to pay it‚Äôs not all profit! This is just idiotic!
1334237133205225473 2020-12-03 04:44:56 +0800 <stephen_point> I am so sick of them talking about destroying small business as a opportunity to rebuild a new ‚ÄúAmerican economy‚Äù it will not be good
1334200352191627270 2020-12-03 02:18:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @renonemontanez @dhmontgomery I saw a report from @thauserkstp that it was 44 and 2 in group homes
1334188234042011648 2020-12-03 01:30:37 +0800 <stephen_point> @dhmontgomery How many from LTC facilities
1334015608883535872 2020-12-02 14:04:40 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz You don‚Äôt care! If you did you would meet with business owners not just use the ones that agree with you politically for photo ops
1333988974637957120 2020-12-02 12:18:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN Please elaborate on the progress and safety we have seen in Minneapolis this year
1333988651567435777 2020-12-02 12:17:33 +0800 <stephen_point> @Travis_Burton @Jaz_Patriot An unregulated government shutdown ? Wild times we live in! I hate this argument so much because of how stupid you have to be to make it! This is not a ‚Äúmarket force‚Äù this is literally the government saying if you operate we will throw you in jail. BIIIIG DIFFERENCE
1333986491064741888 2020-12-02 12:08:58 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN How bout you stop worrying about Texas and start worrying about how bad your fucking up Minneapolis and MN
1333932973377241089 2020-12-02 08:36:18 +0800 <stephen_point> @sr_seymore @TMG08688403 @GovTimWalz You can bet he will try
1333926876134313985 2020-12-02 08:12:05 +0800 <stephen_point> Who wants to bet @GovTimWalz bans ice fishing this year?!
1333926116952735744 2020-12-02 08:09:04 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN None of what she said is true! And we would have a lot more letters like this if we did what she wanted. We can either have billionaires or everyone can have a bed?!?! What?! Insanity! Glad you get your info from a ‚Äúrave mom‚Äù
1333914369806176256 2020-12-02 07:22:23 +0800 <stephen_point> @usatodayDC Get bent
1333879413264420864 2020-12-02 05:03:29 +0800 <stephen_point> I met with a business owner that got rid of his 401K because the IRS fined him 15K for a late 5500 filing! I meet with business owners everyday that can‚Äôt hire employees because the cost of taxes, tax filings, insurances, etc. The government is the one stifling our small business
1333879412262019072 2020-12-02 05:03:28 +0800 <stephen_point> Businesses to survive, invest and expand which allows them to pay more employees.  I work directly in the industry I meet business owners everyday. I meet people that stopped offering health benefits because the cost is so high it swallowed salaries of other employees.
1333879411238608896 2020-12-02 05:03:28 +0800 <stephen_point> The government sticking their greedy hands in the pot is the difference between employees being fairly compensated and employers being able to produce a profit! And for all the idiots a profit is the net  of revenues-expenses and taxes! Profit is not evil it is necessary for
1333879410240364545 2020-12-02 05:03:28 +0800 <stephen_point> This will free up capital! No owner of a business with 10 employees is a greedy millionaire on his yacht and if they act like it they will be out of business ASAP. These are hard working people that would pay their employees more if they could afford to!
1333879409246306304 2020-12-02 05:03:28 +0800 <stephen_point> Trust me if a business can afford to offer health insurance they would, if they can afford to offer sick leave they would! The thing holding them back is all of the taxes and regulations they spend their time and energy on! Remove payroll taxes and remove all the regulations!
1333879407501426688 2020-12-02 05:03:27 +0800 <stephen_point> This is just so backwards! Mark my words they are going to crush small business and the Amazon‚Äôs of the world will prosper!  The government is promising things to workers that it does not have to provide. The businesses all provide the wages, the health care, the sick leave!
1333873054418563072 2020-12-02 04:38:12 +0800 <stephen_point> @janashortal ‚Äúwhen anyone outside of a the default norm gets a seat at the table it‚Äôs noted.‚Äù Anyone* being the key word you used. I know they weren‚Äôt the first but it‚Äôs outside the default norm of the last 40+.I would assume it wasn‚Äôt celebrated because of the party affiliation.
1333839116920786944 2020-12-02 02:23:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @gillianinbrief @uptown_al_ @cherubmessenger @Public_Citizen Offering a civil conversation to allow you to articulate your point. I would assume a poet and novelist would be able to use words instead of memes
1333835636684439553 2020-12-02 02:09:31 +0800 <stephen_point> Anyone on the left want to explain to me how their party is still the party of the 99% when their policies have attributed to the 1% getting richer while small businesses die along with the jobs they provided
1333834839544320001 2020-12-02 02:06:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @janashortal When the goal of the left was to not see gender when qualifying a candidate, now it seems that it is the first qualification on the list. It seems to be an over correction leading to division based off gender instead of inclusiveness with gender being a non factor.
1333833728997486593 2020-12-02 02:01:57 +0800 <stephen_point> @janashortal It has been noted and celebrated over and over. I didn‚Äôt see you noting or celebrating Sarah Sanders or Kayleigh McEnany. I‚Äôm not arguing they they aren‚Äôt qualified because they are women I am arguing their gender should not be a factor in their appointment. I remember a time...
1333819651831173120 2020-12-02 01:06:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz We may see data trends of businesses closing don‚Äôt lose the humanity in those numbers each of those represent an entire family that lost their life savings
1333817561482285056 2020-12-02 00:57:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @AwakenedOutlaw @JuliePennoyer The will be blocked and muted from Twitter ASAP
1333817169759465474 2020-12-02 00:56:09 +0800 <stephen_point> @StarTribune But Tim Walz excuse for not helping businesses was that states can‚Äôt run at a deficit
1333816515712352258 2020-12-02 00:53:33 +0800 <stephen_point> @cherubmessenger @sarimolhem @Public_Citizen Would you agree with this  https://t.co/mCif1fzMr1
1333816405683146752 2020-12-02 00:53:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @cherubmessenger @sarimolhem @Public_Citizen Because said thank you! When he said we need people to understand the difference so I‚Äôm giving you the chance to enlighten me
1333815745252184065 2020-12-02 00:50:29 +0800 <stephen_point> @janashortal Yet no one is boasting about this being the most competent team the only thing being celebrated is their gender. The administration before had many women so to act like Joe Biden unlocked the door is inaccurate.
1333814419382435841 2020-12-02 00:45:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @gillianinbrief @uptown_al_ @cherubmessenger @Public_Citizen Enlighten me
1333813878501699585 2020-12-02 00:43:04 +0800 <stephen_point> @gillianinbrief @uptown_al_ @cherubmessenger @Public_Citizen No I get it everything is the GOPs fault nothing to do with Nancy not agreeing to do anything unless she is allowed to put other useless funding in the bills
1333677489676185604 2020-12-01 15:41:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @Sorry4YourKids Homicides up, suicides up, and 70% of covid deaths coming from LTC facilities. Our gov had the policy of putting covid + patients back in these facilities so please elaborate on how he‚Äôs doing a good job ?
1333671653579001856 2020-12-01 15:17:55 +0800 <stephen_point> @sarimolhem @cherubmessenger @Public_Citizen Lay it out for me plain and simple what do you see as the difference between socialism and communism. Trying to have a discussion you said we need people to know the difference what is it ?
1333671264267866114 2020-12-01 15:16:22 +0800 <stephen_point> @hasanthehun Is he wrong ? Having men and women make you diverse... having all women make you different not diverse
1333671079059939328 2020-12-01 15:15:38 +0800 <stephen_point> @JasonSCampbell Is he wrong? You can‚Äôt be the most diverse when you‚Äôre all one gender? It literally doesn‚Äôt make sense
1333668402540396544 2020-12-01 15:05:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @mn__patriot_ @TheoKeith If was on the market for 15 months too
1333667229544550400 2020-12-01 15:00:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @janashortal That‚Äôs the point though Jana, they did it wrong by picking men based off gender alone... doing the same thing with the opposite gender doesn‚Äôt solve the problem of equality it continues the fallacy that gender matters. Competence matters not identity politics
1333665049810898944 2020-12-01 14:51:40 +0800 <stephen_point> She‚Äôs right but it‚Äôs not the greedy corporations it‚Äôs the greedy politicians like her they become millionaire in office and refuse to make progress in order to make the other side look bad! You‚Äôre a part of the problem you idiot!
1333663937854799872 2020-12-01 14:47:15 +0800 <stephen_point> @cherubmessenger @sarimolhem @Public_Citizen Enlighten me what do you see as the difference
1333663764135043072 2020-12-01 14:46:34 +0800 <stephen_point> @uptown_al_ @cherubmessenger @Public_Citizen Yea those brainless people operating businesses supporting peoples lives are terrible humans if only they were wanna be songwriter and podcasters
1333663392515510272 2020-12-01 14:45:05 +0800 <stephen_point> @uptown_al_ @cherubmessenger @Public_Citizen GOPers killed the free market because the government shut down the businesses ?!?!
1333663033302806529 2020-12-01 14:43:40 +0800 <stephen_point> @cherubmessenger @61Suisse @Public_Citizen Let‚Äôs talk about it
1333656581586579456 2020-12-01 14:18:01 +0800 <stephen_point> @TheoKeith No clue if there is any correlation and obviously not planned but seems like it could be an opportunistic play for them to do this and blame Covid
1333656287570055168 2020-12-01 14:16:51 +0800 <stephen_point> @TheoKeith They were also going to have to spend a lot more money but now used federal tax dollars and spent about 1/4th the price. Federal money that was supposed to be used for businesses and front line workers
1333655933474406402 2020-12-01 14:15:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @TheoKeith Did a quick google search and noticed that Hennipen county morgue has been undersized and understaffed and had plans to move into 60,000 sq foot space in 2021.  So maybe it‚Äôs not that covid is the reason for this maybe it‚Äôs that their officials failed to solve this problem
1333612047720857605 2020-12-01 11:21:04 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN The fact that you think it‚Äôs that simple shows how simple minded and fucking stupid you are
1333608481538990080 2020-12-01 11:06:53 +0800 <stephen_point> @ErinMayeQuade What part do we love... her doxing someone for complaining about sexual harassment in 2018 or the fact that her only success in her political career is latching onto the clintons ?
1333606323171123200 2020-12-01 10:58:19 +0800 <stephen_point> 5.5 million in something that is not being used and will most likely not be used remember that when Walz says we don‚Äôt have money to pay for the businesses he‚Äôs killing
1333535048373477376 2020-12-01 06:15:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @cenkuygur @JoeBiden @GOP This is idiotic! Make people give more money in taxes or we won‚Äôt cut social programs?! The tax cuts didn‚Äôt cost anyone more money they cut peoples taxes ya big dumb idiot
1333518827062140928 2020-12-01 05:10:38 +0800 <stephen_point> @cenkuygur @RandPaul So you don‚Äôt attack the data he presented you just attack him personally... why not be educated and make a point against his data
1333518333338025986 2020-12-01 05:08:40 +0800 <stephen_point> @SKihne That is comical
1333489750703915009 2020-12-01 03:15:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher We put that team away last week in prime time as well! And made it easier for you to win your game with Foles getting hurt. That‚Äôs okay stay high on your team for beating up bad teams we have seen what happens in January when Rogers faces a good team it usually ends in a blowout
1333488651112628224 2020-12-01 03:10:44 +0800 <stephen_point> I‚Äôm happy for Sarah, good for her chasing after a dream of hers! Giving her this award will cause more criticism for her and is doing her a disservice for when she actually earns awards because people will claim it‚Äôs just because she is a girl
1333487985631739904 2020-12-01 03:08:05 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher I agree! The ones I talk to feel helpless and legal action against the government seems like an uphill losing battle...what can/should they do to fight back ?
1333487653061238784 2020-12-01 03:06:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher 3 plays cost us 17 points. Defense played well and Offense made up for their and special teams mistakes. What was the line on the Jacksonville game? How bout the GB vs MN game in GB. A win is a win the score doesn‚Äôt matter when it comes to playoff seeding

Even republicans couldn‚Äôt stand her!
1333486123755081728 2020-12-01 03:00:41 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher I agree I hate this mindset and hate the people saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt support businesses in Minneapolis they voted for this‚Äù when the truth is they most likely didn‚Äôt they are just out numbered... we need to stand together as people not fight each other when the government is the problem
1333485416205275138 2020-12-01 02:57:52 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher You barely beat Jacksonville and you lost to a 1-5 team...and I know you know but that fan is our pro bowl wide receiver...3 bad plays made it a close game and we still battled back through adversity to win...couple 1 point losses are the difference for us this season.
1333478822700863488 2020-12-01 02:31:40 +0800 <stephen_point> She is right that it‚Äôs a broken system... guess who broke the system... the government
1333478628609437700 2020-12-01 02:30:54 +0800 <stephen_point> @jaketapper What the hell is she talking about without reproach? Is she saying the media allowed trump to go unchecked? Is she bat shit crazy?! Nice attempt to look unbiased though Jake
1333443854054244352 2020-12-01 00:12:43 +0800 <stephen_point> This is a classic mix up of my socialism and government spending is better than your socialism and government spending, how bout we don‚Äôt do either and we stop accruing trillions in national debt... I wish we had a president that didn‚Äôt start any wars... oh wait we did !
1333426897456283649 2020-11-30 23:05:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @StarTribune Having a team that is all one gender is the opposite of diverse
1332686332901142528 2020-11-28 22:02:36 +0800 <stephen_point> The ignorance is overwhelming
1331973770425274370 2020-11-26 22:51:08 +0800 <stephen_point> @isthisanightma2 @ErinMayeQuade Was Trump called a liar spreading misinformation telling people we will have vaccines by the end of the year ?
1331739134793191424 2020-11-26 07:18:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @LouisCram @KenSimonSays @ErinMayeQuade Right so biden is comforting the nation by telling us a vaccine will begin by the end of the year but when trump did it he was spreading harmful misinformation. Stop trying to play semantics and realize there is a huge bias
1331723284765835265 2020-11-26 06:15:47 +0800 <stephen_point> @LetUsPlayMN  https://t.co/h72ycFz6zM   Get a mask to shirt for the upcoming protests

1331708814710558721 2020-11-26 05:18:18 +0800 <stephen_point> @KenSimonSays @ErinMayeQuade So was trump lying when he said we would have a vaccine by the end of the year ?
1331703648259252224 2020-11-26 04:57:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @KenSimonSays @ErinMayeQuade Sorry Erin is touting it as his success! Saying he‚Äôs comforting the nation but when trump said it he was spreading misinformation and lies
1331695952592134149 2020-11-26 04:27:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @ErinMayeQuade Ahhh Erin when trump said their would be vaccines by the end of the year he was called a liar spreading harmful misinformation? Trump is still in control why is Biden touting it as his success ?
1331683836762021888 2020-11-26 03:39:02 +0800 <stephen_point> Lectures us on how we need to treat people without degrees better... only offers internships to college students...practice what you preach!  https://t.co/H23xyPWYZU
1331683557232635904 2020-11-26 03:37:56 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN Why do you only offer internships to college students ?  https://t.co/tZrS7lFo4L
1331682078430171137 2020-11-26 03:32:03 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN The we you are referring to is the US government! They are the ones subsidizing and inflating cost of college and they are the ones handing out predatory loans! Until they stop doing this don‚Äôt make the US tax payer pay for their mistakes
1331672207471218689 2020-11-26 02:52:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN Do you have any sources to prove that data? Also just because they are popular doesn‚Äôt mean they are the right thing to do!

1331361030312628226 2020-11-25 06:16:19 +0800 <stephen_point> Good for him!
1331360703240802304 2020-11-25 06:15:01 +0800 <stephen_point> Because of Covid we have allowed our govt  to:  Limit our freedom of speech   Close down businesses   Lock us in our homes  Denied us proper weddings and funerals   Dictate how our children receive their education  Change our voting system   It‚Äôs sad how much power they have
1331357081266397184 2020-11-25 06:00:38 +0800 <stephen_point> @Alyssa_Milano You haven‚Äôt been relevant since you were the best looking ugly person in the cast of Charmed no one cares about your olive branch
1331356607574282240 2020-11-25 05:58:45 +0800 <stephen_point> This is a big reason people are calling this a rigged election! Big Tech and MSM colluded to help Biden, ask yourself why would the 1% want the guy that claims to be tough on billionaire to win? Could it be because they don‚Äôt give a fuck about the little guy and know Joe agrees
1331355712254046209 2020-11-25 05:55:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @nickstreiff Nick, honest question if a family member dies from something other than Covid between now and the end of lockdown. Would you regret not seeing them over thanksgiving? No sarcasm intended honestly want to know your thoughts
1331354229257199620 2020-11-25 05:49:18 +0800 <stephen_point> @wolfblitzer @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Nothing to do with the Vaccine news right Wolf? Let‚Äôs check back 1/20/21 and see where we are at ?
1331353759289630734 2020-11-25 05:47:26 +0800 <stephen_point> Honest question: I play around on Robinhood and thanks to trump have seen great gains... if Biden actually becomes president when do I sell them off and buy back into them ?
1331353179628449794 2020-11-25 05:45:08 +0800 <stephen_point> I‚Äôve said it before the media being against the White House was annoying but created some sort of balance of power... with the media backing Joe 100% is alarming and will allow him to go unchecked
1331325082845597697 2020-11-25 03:53:29 +0800 <stephen_point> Everyone should be upset about this!

1331309605046034433 2020-11-25 02:51:59 +0800 <stephen_point> @thauserkstp This means they have 3 months of not paying it they still owe it and they aren‚Äôt allowed to generate the revenue this just increased their debt
1331303795578392576 2020-11-25 02:28:53 +0800 <stephen_point> I hate that he picks the few small business that support him instead of going to a business that doesn‚Äôt agree with him to hear them out! That would be truly one Minnesota, but I guess they are wrong every damn time according to him
1331301219680231425 2020-11-25 02:18:39 +0800 <stephen_point> It should never be considered dangerous to question the government! In fact it‚Äôs necessary to question the government! At some we lost the will to question them and we are paying for it now
1331285713648721926 2020-11-25 01:17:02 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz Stay afloat? Thank you so much for sinking the ship and offering a tiny life raft to save the entire crew!

1331284639210557442 2020-11-25 01:12:46 +0800 <stephen_point> Looks like Jake is making the argument that the free market does a better job at controlling climate change than the government does! That‚Äôs the point of removing regulations good things happen! Yet they all praise Biden for his plan to get the govt  involved and mess things up
1331284053383802882 2020-11-25 01:10:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @jaketapper Right, so you see what happens when you don‚Äôt burden the market with regulations?! The free market works Jake! So you should understand the government getting out of the business of climate change is the best thing for us! How can we not comprehend this ?

1331078578335739904 2020-11-24 11:33:57 +0800 <stephen_point> It‚Äôs just the government taking over your business   It‚Äôs just the government controlling the means of production  It‚Äôs just a breadline  Shut up peasants I don‚Äôt have to explain anything to you
1331073078516826113 2020-11-24 11:12:06 +0800 <stephen_point> Amazing the control people will give up to the government for a virus with a 99% survival rate

When it comes down to it we see that they are actually selfish Assholes that only care about themselves
1330992928085270528 2020-11-24 05:53:37 +0800 <stephen_point> @thauserkstp Yea I‚Äôm sure sales tax relief will really help them when they aren‚Äôt allowed to make sales anyway! No understanding of what it takes to operate a business yet he‚Äôs allowed to ruin their life

1329267933969743872 2020-11-19 11:39:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz You keep saying ‚ÄúI know this is hard‚Äù but you‚Äôre not doing anything you‚Äôre just playing the blame game with republicans because according to you they are ‚Äú wrong every damn time‚Äù  you clearly hate Minnesotans who don‚Äôt agree with you or question your authority
1329241414102786049 2020-11-19 09:53:43 +0800 <stephen_point> @CatRichert I thought they were 18 year old cooks now they are in charge of healthcare ?

1329240836157042689 2020-11-19 09:51:26 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz distain for his own citizens is so blatant and obvious! Blaming them guilting them and all he can do when asked about aid for business is blame the federal government mainly trump! You should have a financial plan before you cripple the business you ignorant fuck
1329240414147080194 2020-11-19 09:49:45 +0800 <stephen_point> @CatRichert Remember when trump said this and he was putting people in danger
1329223453090537473 2020-11-19 08:42:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @netcit2 Small business owners not dem***
1329223201151361024 2020-11-19 08:41:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @netcit2 Ignorant post because the dem business owners are probably voting republican they are just outnumbered by the non working and adults employed by large corporations

1329202308991762432 2020-11-19 07:18:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @StarTribune This should be the headline not the last paragraph! Very misleading and fear mongering!  https://t.co/8S2ExIPW5G
1329201612519215105 2020-11-19 07:15:34 +0800 <stephen_point> Blaming farts is worse than smoking crack, banging hookers and laundering money!
1329201043641573377 2020-11-19 07:13:18 +0800 <stephen_point> How do people not fucking understand this

1329195078775054336 2020-11-19 06:49:36 +0800 <stephen_point> Shit down their businesses and then expect to be thanked for giving them pennies to survive on

1329159428528959488 2020-11-19 04:27:57 +0800 <stephen_point> @FollowThePuck @GovTimWalz And have your parents and friends buy this shirt! Trying to get enough profit to donate a portion small business in MN impacted by lock downs    https://t.co/DAY0AuvLRe
1329123657151508480 2020-11-19 02:05:48 +0800 <stephen_point> I know a big reason I didn‚Äôt drink or go to parties in high school was because if I got caught I would have to miss 25% of my hockey season... curious what incentive kids have now to stay on the right path
1329115978731450368 2020-11-19 01:35:17 +0800 <stephen_point> @realDailyWire The same reason colleges have proctors for test that walk around room to ensure no cheating it‚Äôs easy to cheat in a room of 200 people with no one watching closely
1329115176042258438 2020-11-19 01:32:06 +0800 <stephen_point> But 10 people celebrating thanksgiving and you‚Äôre killing you‚Äôre family

1328480134886658048 2020-11-17 07:28:40 +0800 <stephen_point> @JoeBiden Forcing unions doesn‚Äôt really sounds like a choice
1328478109285322753 2020-11-17 07:20:37 +0800 <stephen_point> @StarTribune I absolutely take her word for it üôÑ
1328477600906244098 2020-11-17 07:18:36 +0800 <stephen_point> @Walter17761 I hope when you say we you mean private companies not the government!
1328469043766935553 2020-11-17 06:44:36 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher Idk lost to us at home, squeaked by against the Jags at home... that home field advantage isn‚Äôt looking like an advantage anymore
1328468768456986624 2020-11-17 06:43:30 +0800 <stephen_point> THE GOVERNMENT CANT TAX AND SPEND ITS WAY TO PROSPERITY! It doesn‚Äôt fucking work please please please pick up an economics text book read it and share it with a friend
1328468206122532864 2020-11-17 06:41:16 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher Fair on the rivalry I just meant competition for this year
1328467399335571456 2020-11-17 06:38:04 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher Lol at you thinking the bears are your biggest competition in the North
1328450544629911554 2020-11-17 05:31:05 +0800 <stephen_point> Someone sent them over! I usually enjoy being right but In this case I hate that I am right  https://t.co/QjjGp8eOr0
1328449396464181248 2020-11-17 05:26:32 +0800 <stephen_point> Can someone go back and pull up my tweet from this spring about @GovTimWalz planning to cancel the State Hockey tourney. Unfortunately I called it
1328448948864917504 2020-11-17 05:24:45 +0800 <stephen_point> @Carp2291 Pretty sad when you prove someone wrong in a discussion and they run and hide in their echo chamber opposed to thinking for themselves and changing their mind
1328442565889146881 2020-11-17 04:59:23 +0800 <stephen_point> Anything the government gives you for ‚Äúfree‚Äù they can take away much easier
1328437045090422785 2020-11-17 04:37:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN They made the choices! There dreams are delayed because of choices they made! Yes it‚Äôs the governments fault for inflating cost and handing out predatory loans but making other tax payers pay for it is not the answer either
1328436587189858304 2020-11-17 04:35:38 +0800 <stephen_point> As someone who made bad decisions and racked up student loan debt this sounds great on the surface! But when you dive into it and look at why we have such a massive student debt problem and realize it‚Äôs from the govt getting involved you realize quickly this is not the answer
1328363368072155138 2020-11-16 23:44:41 +0800 <stephen_point> @MrMachinist71 Heavy doses of sarcasm in my tweet
1328350721092116481 2020-11-16 22:54:26 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill So let me get this straight... it‚Äôs selfish to not want the government to take your hard earned money and use it to put off someone else‚Äôs debt but it‚Äôs not selfish to expect your debt to be paid by someone else ?!?
1328172604411105282 2020-11-16 11:06:39 +0800 <stephen_point> @mcuban @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi Government is the ebony of progress* fixed it for ya
1328168244566396934 2020-11-16 10:49:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @NYCCittaMia Lol I was being extremely sarcastic
1328164689243643904 2020-11-16 10:35:12 +0800 <stephen_point> I feel so bad for bill and Hillary what could have they possibly done to deserve to be treated this way
1328160009486626817 2020-11-16 10:16:36 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN @HillaryClinton Just think of all the fake ones used trying to get her elected
1328159838770061313 2020-11-16 10:15:56 +0800 <stephen_point> @AMinus____ I hate when they refer to the pandemic as an opportunity
1328158040474808320 2020-11-16 10:08:47 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill And not one window was smashed or store looted
1327286766190018560 2020-11-14 00:26:39 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher @MayorFrey I wish he gave this much attention to the business owners and concerned citizens in his community
1327278135449010177 2020-11-13 23:52:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @ChrisReuvers But the mob is his base of voters! He doesn‚Äôt want the ‚Äúchant go home Jacob‚Äù starting up again
1327258183052640258 2020-11-13 22:33:04 +0800 <stephen_point> @lakeshow73 @JaceFrederick He didn‚Äôt say that he said we haven‚Äôt got much help from the gov which is an accurate statement. It would be an accurate statement for many small business owners in MN. Walz only cares about his voting base that‚Äôs why he say ‚Äúrepublicans are wrong every damn time‚Äù
1327037462791655424 2020-11-13 07:56:00 +0800 <stephen_point> Curious how that‚Äôs going to work when no one goes down town anymore?
1327025999897264128 2020-11-13 07:10:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @jeffgro25439189 Thank you!
1327024340387332096 2020-11-13 07:03:52 +0800 <stephen_point> Why? If you‚Äôre not feeling symptoms why go out and get tested ? So they can increases the cases and justify it to lock down again ?!
1327023448690814977 2020-11-13 07:00:19 +0800 <stephen_point> Fighting to get to 1K followers! Any help would be much appreciated!
1327023162114990081 2020-11-13 06:59:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher Hopefully we can make a run and get a chance at a grudge match in the playoffs! Friendly wager if we do? üëãüèº?
1327022408209874944 2020-11-13 06:56:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher Guess we can‚Äôt give him too much credit for beating up on the packers since they have such a terrible run Defense
1327021973126275077 2020-11-13 06:54:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher You‚Äôre talking about Dalvin right ?
1327021512381976578 2020-11-13 06:52:38 +0800 <stephen_point> Ban driving this is unsafe! We should limit the amount of cars on the road! Only slow one vehicle per household! Less cars=less deaths! Don‚Äôt you care about other people safety
1326720398583504897 2020-11-12 10:56:06 +0800 <stephen_point> This is what you voted for! Enough with all the ‚Äúwe care about small businesses‚Äù bull shit
1326648697015341059 2020-11-12 06:11:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @JeffreyToobin @NewYorker Might want to change your Twitter bio once you‚Äôre done jerking off
1326647168497709056 2020-11-12 06:05:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @DLoesch Someone please explain that fucking logic to me ?
1326645128283344896 2020-11-12 05:57:01 +0800 <stephen_point> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden How can he be honest if he won‚Äôt be honest about his son and refuses to talk to reporters when any negative information comes to light about him ?
1326620523049099266 2020-11-12 04:19:14 +0800 <stephen_point> @amyklobuchar So what do you say to our own @AGEllison who interferes with the democratic process ?
1326619821782388737 2020-11-12 04:16:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @PioneerPress Apparently being a dictator of MN is not enough for him
1326613667928928256 2020-11-12 03:52:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @TheoKeith Any research on the effectiveness of the curfew ?
1326586961528696832 2020-11-12 02:05:53 +0800 <stephen_point> Couldn‚Äôt be more true
1326578134884315136 2020-11-12 01:30:48 +0800 <stephen_point> Did Tim Walz thank all the cooks in the national guard for their service today ?
1326381076508446722 2020-11-11 12:27:46 +0800 <stephen_point> Good for Karin but I wish the other republicans in MN would grow a spine and stick up to this ignorant lumberjack wannabe
1326377299588116482 2020-11-11 12:12:45 +0800 <stephen_point> @washingtonpost It says right in the article that he didn‚Äôt recant his statement though? Are people really this blind ?
1326375974796058624 2020-11-11 12:07:29 +0800 <stephen_point> @JoeBiden No wonder foreign leaders like you! You shell out all the money and resources and we get nothing in return! It‚Äôs not about being liked by everyone!
1326368096412598272 2020-11-11 11:36:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @JoeBiden Yea it‚Äôs called get the fuck out of the way and let people choose what is best for their family! The government can‚Äôt do anything more efficiently than the market
1326286601165529089 2020-11-11 06:12:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @thauserkstp So why have the restriction ? Sorry but it‚Äôs hard to trust a guy that said he wouldn‚Äôt fine businesses and turned around and fined one for $7000 for having the wrong mask
1326280715785306114 2020-11-11 05:48:58 +0800 <stephen_point> @LtGovFlanagan Read that and it didn‚Äôt make sense at first! Glad you corrected it but it still doesn‚Äôt make any sense because we don‚Äôt need your permission for a private gathering so please sit down and go organize some more statues being torn down
1326280081551945728 2020-11-11 05:46:27 +0800 <stephen_point> Honest question how do they plan on enforcing the social gathering limit of 10 people?! Will the police be knocking on doors of houses with too many cars in the driveway ?! How has no reporter asked this question ?
1326279278250455042 2020-11-11 05:43:15 +0800 <stephen_point> @davidhogg111 Turning away from the Democratic Party I see ?

1326177486661582853 2020-11-10 22:58:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @jaketapper It‚Äôs the same thing you said earlier Jake
1326176624232951808 2020-11-10 22:55:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @keithellison Oh you mean the same guy that used the IRS to target the Republican Party is refusing to investigate voter fraud... color me shocked
1326176014221758464 2020-11-10 22:52:55 +0800 <stephen_point> @keithellison Kinda like the Russia thing eh Keith!? Again go beat up your girlfriend it sounds like you have a lot. Anger built up
1326027168384647168 2020-11-10 13:01:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @keithellison @Tokesq We don‚Äôt answer to you dipshit! Go beat your girlfriend again coward
1326024985886949377 2020-11-10 12:52:47 +0800 <stephen_point> If you follow Alyssa Milano and allow her to influence your political opinion you‚Äôre an idiot I‚Äôm sorry but you are
1326015181973979136 2020-11-10 12:13:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @JesseFFerguson @Tokesq You spelled China wrong
1326014700723732480 2020-11-10 12:11:55 +0800 <stephen_point> Can‚Äôt wait until biden has to send in national guard and he isn‚Äôt called a dictator
1326014279976321024 2020-11-10 12:10:15 +0800 <stephen_point> @Austin_Boots1 Sad but true
1326014206697635841 2020-11-10 12:09:57 +0800 <stephen_point> @WCCO I forgot Covid only comes out after 10pm! What an arrogant prick
1326010376283041793 2020-11-10 11:54:44 +0800 <stephen_point> Curious about Joes plan to stop Covid! I saw it was a national mask mandate. Majority of the states already have a mask mandate so the only thing he can do to make it ‚Äúbetter‚Äù is start enforcing it with fines and other punishment! But yea Trump is the dictator
1326009287995346947 2020-11-10 11:50:24 +0800 <stephen_point> We have seen a lot of this!

1326007809377406978 2020-11-10 11:44:32 +0800 <stephen_point> @kylegriffin1 @MickMulvaney They are recounting Wisconsin and Georgia so it‚Äôs really not moot
1326007550047744003 2020-11-10 11:43:30 +0800 <stephen_point> @RepMaryFranson He doesn‚Äôt care! And he doesn‚Äôt understand how businesses operate he is a close minded school teacher with a very narrow view of reality
1326005092756041728 2020-11-10 11:33:44 +0800 <stephen_point> This is coming from the same people that say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have respect for anyone who voted for trump‚Äù so let me get this straight... they are allowed to look past actual policies that hurt POC  for their candidate but republicans aren‚Äôt allowed to look past claims against trump ?
1326005091673858049 2020-11-10 11:33:44 +0800 <stephen_point> I countered and mentioned Joe speaking at Robert Byrd‚Äôs funeral along with the 94 crime bill and other quotes he said in congress. Their responses were all the same... I agree he doesn‚Äôt have the best past but it‚Äôs a two party system and he is all we have right now.
1326005089408966661 2020-11-10 11:33:43 +0800 <stephen_point> Spoke with a few different Biden supporters that told me how racist Trump is and how bad he is for POC. So I asked for evidence of his racists policies confused they sent me a list of racist things he has been accused of saying including ‚Äúrefusing to disavow white supremacy‚Äù
1326002643433525248 2020-11-10 11:24:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @WalterHudson Come get me mother fucker
1326002511371665408 2020-11-10 11:23:29 +0800 <stephen_point> @RyanAFournier Democrats back up plan!
1326001673530077184 2020-11-10 11:20:09 +0800 <stephen_point> Sad the length they will go to in order to lie to the public. @jack where you at on this one ?
1326001462271303681 2020-11-10 11:19:19 +0800 <stephen_point> The Democratic Party and the media are acting like a football team that just got away with a bad call by the refs...rushing to the line so they can‚Äôt review the play! Even worse they are acting like the challenge flag wasn‚Äôt thrown
1325942205446451202 2020-11-10 07:23:51 +0800 <stephen_point> @IlhanMN I mean it is 2020 we do give participation trophies to everyone
1325942044422909952 2020-11-10 07:23:12 +0800 <stephen_point> @marissaaevans Shut up he‚Äôs trusting science how dare you question him
1325925988627177473 2020-11-10 06:19:24 +0800 <stephen_point> These are the same people that claim they won‚Äôt vote for trump because he was falsely accused of mocking a disabled reporter!
1325925123380047872 2020-11-10 06:15:58 +0800 <stephen_point> Sad really
1325924225480237056 2020-11-10 06:12:24 +0800 <stephen_point> @mnhealth Nope gonna celebrate the same way I do every damn year with my family and loved ones because a life where you avoid family due to a virus with a 99% survival rate is not worth living
1325887770057863168 2020-11-10 03:47:32 +0800 <stephen_point> @cenkuygur We‚Äôre we supposed to take the lies by Hillary and Schiff if Russia meddling seriously ? Because people did and that seemed to be more detrimental than a person simply praying
1325876061540814851 2020-11-10 03:01:01 +0800 <stephen_point> Amazing we are celebrating a vaccine that is 90% effective for a virus that has a 99% survival rate...
1325875282549436418 2020-11-10 02:57:55 +0800 <stephen_point> If the Hunter Biden emails were false like so many claimed why is he not right by his dads side claiming victory and denying the claims ?
1325874421974790146 2020-11-10 02:54:30 +0800 <stephen_point> This is honestly comical! If an employer doesn‚Äôt hire you based off your political beliefs that‚Äôs actually illegal! And do you think employers were jumping to hire the rioters of 2016 when trump won ? The logic is idiotic and hypocritical
1325873409541038080 2020-11-10 02:50:29 +0800 <stephen_point> This is so true! If the Obamas were so unifying then we wouldn‚Äôt have seen a Trump candidate in 2016 and wouldn‚Äôt have seen a Trump win in 2016 Trump was not the cause of divisiveness he was the effect
1325873046805073920 2020-11-10 02:49:02 +0800 <stephen_point> A few things that stick out to me...  If the disparities strictly are due to early voting/ vote by mail going to Biden. Then why did we not see the same disparities when it comes to in person voting. If that narrative were true we should‚Äôve seen much higher votes for trump early
1325873044997353474 2020-11-10 02:49:02 +0800 <stephen_point> Doing the math on this  Here are the percentages of votes Biden received after the stop of counting  MI 60% of the last 41% WI 61% of the last 18% PA 64% of the last 36% GA 70% of the last 17% NC hasn‚Äôt moved.   Not claiming fraud just the percentages
1325872324168478722 2020-11-10 02:46:10 +0800 <stephen_point> @CarlHigbie @SavMinnesota Doing the math on this  Here are the percentages of votes Biden received after the stoppage of counting on election night   MI 60% of the last 41% WI 61% of the last 18% PA 64% of the last 36% GA 70% of the last 17% NC hasn‚Äôt moved.   Not claiming fraud just the percentages
1325865145889779712 2020-11-10 02:17:38 +0800 <stephen_point> To clarify: ‚Äúfocus on the science‚Äù is a campaign slogan NOT a plan!  Operation Warp Speed and private public partnerships ARE plans! Plans that are working! But then again apparently rhetoric is more important than actual action
1325862881158594560 2020-11-10 02:08:38 +0800 <stephen_point> Is Joe allowed to answer questions regarding the packing of the court yet?
1325859880977133570 2020-11-10 01:56:43 +0800 <stephen_point> Here it comes! Now with more testing cases will rise and used as the reason for the next stay at home order. Sad day honestly
1325848211748052992 2020-11-10 01:10:21 +0800 <stephen_point> Please No!
1325848137685110784 2020-11-10 01:10:03 +0800 <stephen_point> 2- in spite of the terrible policies and taxes that are working against them. They don‚Äôt riot they put their head down and work knowing the president can‚Äôt slow them down! They just wanted a president that got out of the way instead of controlling their life and business
1325848135558524928 2020-11-10 01:10:03 +0800 <stephen_point> 1 Don‚Äôt be surprised when your calls for unity are not met by the people you referred to as racists, deplorable and terrible people that were able to ‚Äúlook past‚Äù rhetoric and voted based off policy. But also don‚Äôt be surprised when they continue to work for their American dream
1325847215173111808 2020-11-10 01:06:23 +0800 <stephen_point> If it‚Äôs not a political statement then why did he use it in all his political ads and attacks on trump
1325845674173190148 2020-11-10 01:00:16 +0800 <stephen_point> Honestly the media always lying and attacking  Trump was annoying but it created a balance of power for information  (kind of) What scares me is a media that is willing to lie in order to support a president leaving them unchecked. It allows for a lot more corruption
1325844903222411264 2020-11-10 00:57:12 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill Doctors aren‚Äôt allowed to catch viruses ?
1325823461432807425 2020-11-09 23:32:00 +0800 <stephen_point> This is by no means a prediction but all these calls for unity by the left are going to look incredibly hypocritical if anything changes with these election law suits
1325823030405132288 2020-11-09 23:30:17 +0800 <stephen_point> @mcuban What are they misled about ? What are they wrong about ? Enlighten us
1325818159597678592 2020-11-09 23:10:56 +0800 <stephen_point> @georgehahn You‚Äôre an idiot cause she didn‚Äôt cry about it she said don‚Äôt expect them to come running to unite! And you stated lies ran by the MSM for reasons you don‚Äôt like trump look into all of them, Obama made the cages, he didn‚Äôt mock a disabled reporter. Go watch the actual clip
1325813004789665792 2020-11-09 22:50:27 +0800 <stephen_point> Go ahead and read it. It‚Äôs nothing but fluff no legitimate plan and or stats on how he‚Äôs going to do things. ‚ÄúTrust the science‚Äù is not a plan trust the science and do what? ‚ÄúCreate Jobs‚Äù is not a plan how do you plan on doing that?     https://t.co/P1W3Uf4a4d
1325810555332956161 2020-11-09 22:40:43 +0800 <stephen_point> ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have a covid plan‚Äù no your just to lazy to read up on it and only wait until the MSM shoes you it. They conveniently waited until after the election to talk about it
1325606526287949824 2020-11-09 09:09:59 +0800 <stephen_point> Good for Megyn
1325590750227095559 2020-11-09 08:07:17 +0800 <stephen_point> More truth
1325589086808150016 2020-11-09 08:00:41 +0800 <stephen_point> The truth!
1325588916896849920 2020-11-09 08:00:00 +0800 <stephen_point> Outrageous
1325511566792355840 2020-11-09 02:52:38 +0800 <stephen_point> At least CA didn‚Äôt go completely crazy! This law would have been terrible
1325331298735464450 2020-11-08 14:56:19 +0800 <stephen_point> Yup
1325328696945770497 2020-11-08 14:45:59 +0800 <stephen_point> @hasanthehun Did you also comment on the celebrations going on in DC? No? Cause it doesn‚Äôt align with your narrative? Gotcha
1325327859649404929 2020-11-08 14:42:39 +0800 <stephen_point> @ryanwhitney6 Call it out Whit!
1325197999354474497 2020-11-08 06:06:38 +0800 <stephen_point> We went from you can‚Äôt vote in person, to even if you have Covid you can vote in person, to you can celebrate in large crowds. Thank god covid is over remember this when they threaten to lock us up again
1325197090536914946 2020-11-08 06:03:02 +0800 <stephen_point> The blatant hypocrisy around Covid is going to continue
1325182992055087105 2020-11-08 05:07:00 +0800 <stephen_point> Anyone else find it funny that even after they claim Biden has won Hunter is no where to be found
1324944238224699392 2020-11-07 13:18:17 +0800 <stephen_point> This is insanity!What‚Äôs your list for?
1324745058558488576 2020-11-07 00:06:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill Liberal cities that have been ruined by liberal policies voting for more liberal policies is honestly depressing to me
1324744724050186243 2020-11-07 00:05:29 +0800 <stephen_point> And I am so fucking ashamed of it! The lack of knowledge around economics is appalling, the willingness to give up freedoms is appalling. The willingness to believe everything your professor or news anchor says is appalling. Honestly it‚Äôs depressing for the future.
1324740604962566144 2020-11-06 23:49:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @davidhogg111 Yea people that live on their parents cell phone plan, insurance plan, have their parents pay their student loans absolutely shocked they are voting for more free stuff
1324739951917895680 2020-11-06 23:46:31 +0800 <stephen_point> @JoeySenkyr @dhmontgomery I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs suspicious I understand how that works! I am saying they are the worst county for crime, poverty, and all the like ran by just terrible policies yet they continue to vote for bad policies and try to force them on the rest of the state
1324735146742837249 2020-11-06 23:27:26 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill @staceyabrams She is the size of the hulk so that‚Äôs relevant
1324722320452145153 2020-11-06 22:36:28 +0800 <stephen_point> @dhmontgomery Isn‚Äôt it weird that our worst county that no one else wants to be like is the one that gets to decide how MN ends up politically. People are so stupid
1324551115094945792 2020-11-06 11:16:09 +0800 <stephen_point> @mnsrc @paulgazelka Do something with it cowards
1324473878626721792 2020-11-06 06:09:14 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill @Remixgodsuede Imagine mocking Ilhan Omar supporters praying for her victory. Would be banned and canceled immediately
1324448472343326720 2020-11-06 04:28:17 +0800 <stephen_point> It‚Äôs amazing to me how the left can‚Äôt tell the difference between between a peaceful protest and a riot! It‚Äôs so frustrating when they try to make these ignorant posts
1324445524313825280 2020-11-06 04:16:34 +0800 <stephen_point> That‚Äôs the end of this rant! I should get off these apps but that is what they want to give up and ignore it so we can just let it happen not sure if I want to do that yet
1324445523210743808 2020-11-06 04:16:34 +0800 <stephen_point> You are the most conformist generation in the United States in my lifetime! You are not the hippies of the 60s fighting the norms. You are buying everything the big gov big tech and big media are spoon feeding you it‚Äôs outrageous that you can call yourself the resistance
1324445522057285632 2020-11-06 04:16:34 +0800 <stephen_point> They do not have this right! And to those on the left that claim to be the resistance you have all big tech on your side you have all news media on your side you have the teacher on your side you have the celebrities on your side. What the hell are you resisting
1324445521008709633 2020-11-06 04:16:33 +0800 <stephen_point> Sending me links but can get monitor my private conversations and mark them false. That‚Äôs alarming to me! It should be alarming to others! I can talk to whoever I want about whatever I want and they can fuck off as long as I‚Äôm not plotting violence against anyone
1324445519976964096 2020-11-06 04:16:33 +0800 <stephen_point> If these claims are in fact true. What makes you the deciding factor in what is true or not true in something that has not been tried or decided. And lastly these were private message screen shots I didn‚Äôt post it to my page! Instagram can‚Äôt stop fake Instagram accounts from
1324445518932553729 2020-11-06 04:16:33 +0800 <stephen_point> Mean that there was voter suppression involved. Okay fair enough but it also doesn‚Äôt mean there wasn‚Äôt and you‚Äôve provided no proof that there wasn‚Äôt voter fraud therefore I‚Äôm not sure how you can just blatantly call it false when we‚Äôre about to go onto legal battles to see
1324445516969570304 2020-11-06 04:16:32 +0800 <stephen_point> 1 Alright this is some BS Instagram is flagging that a shared a post with misleading information it was the graph from the wisconsin votes. So I look at the politifact article and I see that the graph is in fact accurate it is just misleading because this does not  necessarily
1324432097528852480 2020-11-06 03:23:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @cenkuygur Maybe you should look in the mirror and reflect on why that didn‚Äôt happen instead of pointing it at others and claiming racism! He gained votes with women and minorities and lost votes with white males...doesn‚Äôt seem something a racist would do
1324370611959853056 2020-11-05 23:18:54 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill Ahhh that‚Äôs his job dummy
1324369148164538368 2020-11-05 23:13:05 +0800 <stephen_point> @mnhealth No one fucking cares about Covid anymore you made that clear when you said Covid positive people should still go vote.
1324368951476776960 2020-11-05 23:12:18 +0800 <stephen_point> So a few hindered people showing up to actually protest ( just chanting) had liberals clutching their pearls. Yet burning down buildings and looting stores was considered mostly peaceful...can‚Äôt make this shit up
1324366764361175041 2020-11-05 23:03:36 +0800 <stephen_point> That should tell you enough. By the way I own the domain for  https://t.co/yizMLXHtNW and wanted to sell it but you were a joke and couldn‚Äôt get nominated thanks a lot
1324366431664840704 2020-11-05 23:02:17 +0800 <stephen_point> Up from 2016 is what I meant but you get the point
1324365595018604544 2020-11-05 22:58:58 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz Just shut the fuck up already you overweight waffle eating dweeb! Sad to see MN so tied into identity politics that idiots like you and Mayor Frey are elected officials
1324365257167364096 2020-11-05 22:57:37 +0800 <stephen_point> According to CNN exit polls about 18% of black voters voted for Trump that‚Äôs up 5% from Hillary. Joe Biden would like to let them know they are now officially not considered black anymore
1324364557305802752 2020-11-05 22:54:50 +0800 <stephen_point> Disgusting
1324362231727837186 2020-11-05 22:45:36 +0800 <stephen_point> @RepMaryFranson Weird it‚Äôs called a protest but there is nothing on fire and no one is looting... I thought that was a requirement for protests these days
1324361648858038274 2020-11-05 22:43:17 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill It‚Äôs weird I saw protest in PHX but there were no fires or looting so we‚Äôre they actually protest ?
1324258740552429570 2020-11-05 15:54:21 +0800 <stephen_point> @charliekirk11 88 percent of people that voted in Maricopa county voted through mail in ballots...that is a wild stat. Hard to believe only 165,000 people in Maricopa county voted in person on Election Day  https://t.co/mhkNmmxrjB
1324255246105808897 2020-11-05 15:40:28 +0800 <stephen_point> @gelanteTV @PaxMillion @Wizard_Predicts @Timcast @Cernovich How can you check on your in person ballot in Maricopa so far I only see the option for AZ. Would appreciate a link to send out
1324254331999186944 2020-11-05 15:36:50 +0800 <stephen_point> Tried it myself and it worked but the thing I want to know is the definition of the dates anyone who voted in MI. If it‚Äôs true it‚Äôs suspect but could also just mean they mailed out a ballot for a dead person because she was an every year absentee voter. Curious to know the truth

1324253168759263238 2020-11-05 15:32:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @fleccas I tried this too and it worked. Can anyone in Michigan confirm the dates on these are referring to the state receiving the ballot  or the individual receiving ballot ? Because if it is the first option then this is alarming  https://t.co/LcZ1Ek6m9m

1323683765172887553 2020-11-04 01:49:37 +0800 <stephen_point> Major cities being boarded up should tell us everything we need to know about how they think the election is going to go! But you still have to vote!

1323682573248131072 2020-11-04 01:44:52 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill Ahhh he‚Äôs mocking Mike Bloomberg for choking in a debate and makes absolutely zero reference to Eric Garner! Just because he said the words I can‚Äôt breathe doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs mocking someone who‚Äôs choked! Just proof of rewriting the narrative to what you want to believe
1323668877931261953 2020-11-04 00:50:27 +0800 <stephen_point> Karin has been one of the best at calling out Tim Walz for his terrible policies when it comes to LTC facilities and Covid!

1323401246384902144 2020-11-03 07:06:59 +0800 <stephen_point> This is laughable that they are trying to say it is white supremacist who are threatening violence....sure I believe some of those idiots would try to cause harm but it‚Äôs obvious that the large riots that this year were not white supremacist
1323375846296481792 2020-11-03 05:26:03 +0800 <stephen_point> Unfortunately we can not vote @GovTimWalz out of office on Tuesday but you can buy a shirt to help the local businesses that he has been crushing with his arbitrary restrictions and fines. I also have masks!    https://t.co/DAY0AuvLRe

1321170633380843520 2020-10-28 03:23:19 +0800 <stephen_point> It‚Äôs obvious that the democrats want bad things to happen so they can use to get your vote! It‚Äôs honestly disgusting and you should take that into account when voting

I‚Äôm sorry that the facts they share are in support of conservative ideals. It should tell you something when they are proven to be factual and that means they lean conservative  https://t.co/Yk0C4DJAst

Govt needs to reduce spending and taxes in order to leave income in the hands of individuals who earned it and who can spend it much more efficiently‚Äù
1321155863902470144 2020-10-28 02:24:38 +0800 <stephen_point> @trueb06 @GovTimWalz @LittleSenator Your first claim of NASA creating jobs is a prime example of this. We have seen SpaceX a private company move faster and spend less than NASA.
1321155510658166784 2020-10-28 02:23:14 +0800 <stephen_point> @trueb06 @GovTimWalz @LittleSenator Clearly you did not read the article. While government spending may increase jobs for one particular company or industry it reduces private investment and jobs in other areas. Private companies also are much more efficient with their spending costing citizens less money
1321129183733374976 2020-10-28 00:38:37 +0800 <stephen_point> This is why people call it a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù the virus is not a ‚Äúhoax‚Äù but the media instilling fear and not reporting the good news is the hoax! Ask yourself why they want you in fear and why we can‚Äôt be optimistic about the mortality rate declining

He panders to the left and none of what he says or does is genuine. He has deserted small businesses and left MLPS in shambles.

1319200218018050055 2020-10-22 16:53:36 +0800 <stephen_point> @maddow Typo? A typo is when you spell Minnesota Minesota not when you call it North Dakota!

1319185632611033088 2020-10-22 15:55:38 +0800 <stephen_point> @HKrassenstein They did this in support of Biden ya know
1319177609473712128 2020-10-22 15:23:45 +0800 <stephen_point> @hasanthehun It‚Äôs called supply and demand when Demand is high the supplier can charge more and the beauty of it is you have a choice to go find a cheaper gym! But I wouldn‚Äôt expect a socialist to understand
1319147340658192384 2020-10-22 13:23:29 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher @real_letspartee @MrKEK10101 Other things are a bigger factor but it‚Äôs 100% a factor. Bank is top 3 loudest stadiums. Teams have to game plan for silent counts and we saw Rogers was able to use his hard count and communicate easily it‚Äôs called home field ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù for a reason
1319144465928540160 2020-10-22 13:12:03 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher @real_letspartee @MrKEK10101 Not all on Kirk but I have more love for Zim. Zim has had to deal with a lot of adversity since becoming a head coach and did a great job with the cards he was dealt. Injuries and rookies with no preseason plus no fans at home are to blame for this season. Blame Walz lol
1319140937700798464 2020-10-22 12:58:02 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher @real_letspartee @MrKEK10101 Talk smack about Kirk all you want but leave Zim out of it! Football guy through and through loves the game and he deserves a ring as a head coach
1319140231572910081 2020-10-22 12:55:14 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher @real_letspartee @MrKEK10101 It‚Äôs not our year and I‚Äôve become content with that. Too many injuries and too many rookies on defense. We will be back to reclaim the north don‚Äôt worry Zimmer2021

1319127980552024064 2020-10-22 12:06:33 +0800 <stephen_point> @teresa3607 @CNN It was used to negatively impact Trump  but I guess you wouldn‚Äôt know that when you only read the headline like the mindless supporter you are
1319127719632719873 2020-10-22 12:05:31 +0800 <stephen_point> @mdot270inCA @CNN Well it was against him so not sure why he would do that! Oh you only read the headline and assumed it was pro trump weird that‚Äôs exactly what @CNN wants their brain dead supporters to do
1319127338680938505 2020-10-22 12:04:00 +0800 <stephen_point> @J0hn174 @CNN They did it to try to make Trump supporters look bad

1319127135382978560 2020-10-22 12:03:11 +0800 <stephen_point> Don‚Äôt forget to point out that they did this to negatively impact Trump!
1319126819711283201 2020-10-22 12:01:56 +0800 <stephen_point> But the hunter Biden emails need to be verified first ?!?

1319062748597088256 2020-10-22 07:47:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @ConnieHumphreyB @GovTimWalz Tell me this is a fake account please? Why does the government telling you what to do make you safer? You always have the option to wear a mask. And also cases have gone up since mask mandates were implemented
1319062242692792321 2020-10-22 07:45:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @quillan68 @GovTimWalz Go check their deaths compared to ours! How about his LTC policies ?
1319060032625938434 2020-10-22 07:36:33 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz We aren‚Äôt sick of Covid we are sick of your arbitrary laws that are crushing small business!
1319057989068681217 2020-10-22 07:28:26 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz I can‚Äôt stand this guy trying to say he is creating jobs when he is actively suppressing small businesses and burying them in fines
1319056075266506753 2020-10-22 07:20:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @LtGovFlanagan What the F does the flu shot have to do with this ?

1319053171063308289 2020-10-22 07:09:17 +0800 <stephen_point> @dhmontgomery How is this not a bigger part of the story! Walz policies causing our LTC residents to pass away and then they turn and use the death numbers to shut down the rest of the state!
1319052070154981376 2020-10-22 07:04:54 +0800 <stephen_point> @MayorFrey @MplsWard12 Do you care at all about any of the businesses being shut down in the skyway! Multiple business are going to have to go bankrupt and terminate their lease! All because of lock downs! Do you care about helping them or just grandstanding for your base ?
1319010626593640448 2020-10-22 04:20:14 +0800 <stephen_point> @NPR Do we know if they were with their family when they were detained ?
1319007423026266112 2020-10-22 04:07:30 +0800 <stephen_point> @kare11 Ludicrous
1319002601334034432 2020-10-22 03:48:20 +0800 <stephen_point> @nickroberts317 So this is automatically believed to be real but verification from the DOJ and FBI around hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop are still in question?
1318993622604263424 2020-10-22 03:12:40 +0800 <stephen_point> You wonder why he wants people to forget about his past ?
1318922697795989504 2020-10-21 22:30:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @sparafucile0 @CurtisHouck What proof or evidence do you have of that? Because Adam Schiff said it sounds like Russian propaganda ? There is no evidence for it being Russia disinformation yet I am the gullible one ?
1318921781864931328 2020-10-21 22:27:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @sparafucile0 @CurtisHouck Please elaborate on what trump should have done to save 200,000 people? Please elaborate on how it‚Äôs possible as president to stop a virus from killing anyone ? No other country has done that so why does trump all of a sudden have that power
1318796864762699776 2020-10-21 14:10:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @KMBoling @sparafucile0 @CurtisHouck This would be relevant if I quoted tucker Carlson and he was the only one reporting on the emails

1318789689986351104 2020-10-21 13:42:18 +0800 <stephen_point> @sparafucile0 @CurtisHouck Please tell me you didn‚Äôt just call me gullible look at your name on Twitter for Christ sake!!! There are multiple news sources confirming this now just because your beloved CNN and MSNBC didn‚Äôt report it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not true
1318774714664247297 2020-10-21 12:42:48 +0800 <stephen_point> @TheoKeith @AGEllison This is called voter suppression. Kieth Ellison is a power hungry hypocrite and it‚Äôs sad that he is the AG
1318773181839077382 2020-10-21 12:36:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @sparafucile0 @CurtisHouck Confirmed by DOJ and FBI now so do you still feel that way?
1318771634778505216 2020-10-21 12:30:33 +0800 <stephen_point> This is actual voter suppression!
1318767262375972864 2020-10-21 12:13:11 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz By service do you mean thank your for cooking ?
1318764226056540161 2020-10-21 12:01:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz The roads are dangerous maybe we should shut them down for 2 weeks to slow the spread... actually let‚Äôs just shut them down for the whole winter then we won‚Äôt have any deaths in the road
1318697851656962049 2020-10-21 07:37:22 +0800 <stephen_point> @Garyatty @SeanLangille @JakeBGibson Are you talking about the Steele dossier
1318685457736069121 2020-10-21 06:48:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @maddow Don‚Äôt focus on the deaths going down though that would be detrimental to your narrative
1318653930327322624 2020-10-21 04:42:51 +0800 <stephen_point> @KamalaHarris Asking for people to wish you a happy birthday is pretty sad and depressing
1318653375634812928 2020-10-21 04:40:38 +0800 <stephen_point> Sad that even our football season can be impacted by dictator! He‚Äôs not going to let it happen that would generate too much optimism and he would have to relinquish his emergency powers
1318639577599418369 2020-10-21 03:45:49 +0800 <stephen_point> Bet you don‚Äôt see this on CNN
1318605930116706304 2020-10-21 01:32:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @stevesimeonidis @CityofMiami Was he voting or working ?

1318605363306901504 2020-10-21 01:29:51 +0800 <stephen_point> @brianstelter And if this happened to a Fox News analyst we would see vice, buzzfeed, TYT and all the others come out with a story about how jerking off is a part of the white male patriarchy and trumps rhetoric emboldened him to do this. It is sexual harassment but Dems won‚Äôt go after him
1318604740796633089 2020-10-21 01:27:23 +0800 <stephen_point> @brianstelter Man it‚Äôs comical how they try to protect their own. Asked for time off for personal issues... he was jerking off in a conference call. If any other working American did that they would be fired immediately and probably charged with sexual harassment!
1318429912550699009 2020-10-20 13:52:41 +0800 <stephen_point> @TheoKeith @GovTimWalz He‚Äôs not asking a he‚Äôs telling there is a big difference
1318293141682712577 2020-10-20 04:49:12 +0800 <stephen_point> @jeremyherb Schiff is purposely misleading the people by making it sound like the intelligence community has verified that these emails are a part of Russian disinformation
1318278863776931840 2020-10-20 03:52:28 +0800 <stephen_point> @RepAdamSchiff @AmeliaC92619635 Sad to see how easy it is for democrats to ignore anything negative and cling talking points of people like Adam Schiff. Other than Schiff saying it where is the proof this is a Russia disinformation campaign
1318277534669131776 2020-10-20 03:47:11 +0800 <stephen_point> Watching the video and Schiff says ‚Äúwe know this information came from the kremlin‚Äù not once is he asked how he knows that or how he can prove it! CNN takes it as fact when it‚Äôs absolute fiction! If he knew this they would be fighting back much harder but instead they are hiding
1318275026542424064 2020-10-20 03:37:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @ddale8 @HotlineJosh Can you define baseless for us?
1318271540752871425 2020-10-20 03:23:22 +0800 <stephen_point> @Acosta Wow reading these replies just shows how one sided everyone is! When there is a whistle blower trying to impeach trump it‚Äôs hard hitting evidence but when emails are released and confirmed by intelligence community and someone in the email chain it‚Äôs Russia disinformation... WTF
1317947998991609857 2020-10-19 05:57:43 +0800 <stephen_point> @johnkriesel Zimmer has faced the most adversity any Vikings coach has faced he brought us winning records and trips to the playoffs. We shouldn‚Äôt have expected to be elite this especially once the injuries started. A year of coaching from Zim and our key pieces returning on to 2021
1317944647000363008 2020-10-19 05:44:24 +0800 <stephen_point> @cenkuygur Labeling a group of people based off their political opinion is exactly how we get to where we are in this country. Both sides do it but when people say trump fans the flames of division and act like the media and groups like TYT don‚Äôt do the same it‚Äôs nauseating
1317594664002678784 2020-10-18 06:33:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @VonDecarlo @icecube @kanyewest Instead of listening to someone who is clearly had a passion to solve the problems and isn‚Äôt playing politics they are attacking him for literally working with the president of the United States to solve the problem! It proves they don‚Äôt want change they just want Trump to lose
1317593811212660736 2020-10-18 06:30:18 +0800 <stephen_point> Weeeeeeeiiiiiiiird! So shocked
1317591922160984064 2020-10-18 06:22:48 +0800 <stephen_point> @MayorFrey  and @GovTimWalz  are you doing anything to help with this or are you too busy taking cheesy photo ops because you‚Äôre more worried about getting re-elected than how bad you‚Äôre hurting your citizens and business owners!
1317578484441522176 2020-10-18 05:29:24 +0800 <stephen_point> @WCCO If it‚Äôs trump and Biden then why do you just have a photo of trump on the link to the article ?!

It may be easy for someone who only cares about art, gardens and travel to ‚Äúget with the program‚Äù you haven‚Äôt had your families business shut down because of a virus with a low death rate or had to miss funerals, graduations, and weddings because of it!
1317273013184651264 2020-10-17 09:15:34 +0800 <stephen_point> @mktsutherland @GovTimWalz Does your simple science show why cases have gone up since the mask mandate? Does it also show you the survival rate from Covid? How about the suicide rate from the government shutting down the economy! Don‚Äôt let the govt threatening to shut down the economy dictate your life
1317258378939346944 2020-10-17 08:17:25 +0800 <stephen_point> @JoeBiden Please show me the quote from Trump that fanned the flames of this

1316509582852677632 2020-10-15 06:41:58 +0800 <stephen_point> Begging people not to watch a town hall from our president is sad and pathetic! If you believed your candidate was good you would say listen to both and see for yourself who is better

1316508895188140032 2020-10-15 06:39:14 +0800 <stephen_point> I‚Äôll admit I went after @icecube hard for some of his lies he posted on Twitter but I respect him for trying to work with both sides and I respect him for being honest about which side he has seen action out of! And if you‚Äôre mad he‚Äôs working with Trump then you don‚Äôt want change

I do not think I‚Äôm better than her but I will gladly call out her hypocrisy any day!

1316495973938393088 2020-10-15 05:47:54 +0800 <stephen_point> This is how bad the political left has made it! I‚Äôm literally thinking I‚Äôd rather live in Wisconsin than MN! Something I never would have thought I would say in all my years

1316489145615699968 2020-10-15 05:20:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @RzstProgramming So now we‚Äôre upset that Trump is working with the most vocal voices and leaders to get something done? Do we really want change or do you just want trump to look bad ?
1316488296105566209 2020-10-15 05:17:23 +0800 <stephen_point> @MinnesotaDFL Thank you for laying it out clearly, the trump campaign and MN Republicans want you to make the choices you see fit, the DFL would like to dictate how you live your life
1316487644902166530 2020-10-15 05:14:48 +0800 <stephen_point> @LoveyBlue727 @1catking @icecube Hahaha she addresses all the issues that you said the CWBA doesn‚Äôt address and then you say I don‚Äôt care I‚Äôm talking about CWBA. What a cowardly move
1316258754501828608 2020-10-14 14:05:16 +0800 <stephen_point> Watching the Dems try go after ACB is comical and shows how desperate they are
1316258459134771206 2020-10-14 14:04:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @RandBall Let me get this straight... a football coach has a desire to for his players and fans to live their life and then he catches a virus with a low death rate and because of politicians and liability the team is forced to shut down and that makes the coach the bad guy ?

1316227949251629057 2020-10-14 12:02:52 +0800 <stephen_point> @RepsForBiden a group called Reps for Biden yet a good majority of your followers are known democrats and were before Trump
1316227070305792001 2020-10-14 11:59:22 +0800 <stephen_point> Is above us! It is not right! I don‚Äôt care if you hate trump! Take the blinders off and realize people like Nancy Pelosi are not on your side!
1316227069332709376 2020-10-14 11:59:22 +0800 <stephen_point> Hurting but she could care less about  their suffering because she knows nothing about suffering! She‚Äôs a cold old rich woman that cares about her political power! She showed what she thought of the people when she went to get a haircut at a closed salon! She believes she
1316227068334546945 2020-10-14 11:59:22 +0800 <stephen_point> I was angry and annoyed with trump on the 6th when he said to stop the negotiations I thought it was the wrong decision to put politics over the people but he has come to his senses and offered a deal! A 1.8 TRILLION dollar deal. Nancy claims to represent the people that are
1316227067185430528 2020-10-14 11:59:21 +0800 <stephen_point> Shut downs and the refusal to let Americans make their own choices about what is safe! So now they created a problem and she refuses to try to solve it because she doesn‚Äôt want trumps name on a check that goes out to Americans that are hurting. It‚Äôs disgusting, and yes
1316227066065346561 2020-10-14 11:59:21 +0800 <stephen_point> Businesses shut down they will keep schools closed all so they can bash trump. It is so blatantly obvious that every move they make is in the best interest of themselves and not the American people! And Nancy is the worst of all of them! People are hurting, because of Democratic
1316227065000030208 2020-10-14 11:59:21 +0800 <stephen_point> Of things like this! They hate trump and I mean absolutely hate him to the point where they believe the end justifies the means! They don‚Äôt care how many Americans they hurt how many people they make suffer as long as trump loses! They will drag out coronavirus they will keep
1316227062064058369 2020-10-14 11:59:20 +0800 <stephen_point> Honestly I was never a huge trump fan. I‚Äôm a registered libertarian and he did appeal to me because he was anti establishment and I can‚Äôt stand big government. I would t say I‚Äôve grown to like trump but rather grown to despise the Democratic Party more and more every day because

1316222833425489920 2020-10-14 11:42:32 +0800 <stephen_point> @indianaboognish @SpeakerPelosi Goos start accepting it now! You and your friends can go crazy and riot after the election once again destroying our country even more

1316071861172666369 2020-10-14 01:42:37 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill Please elaborate on how long lines are only suppressing black voters?! And also please explain how pushing fear of voting in person by the democrats has not suppressed anyone‚Äôs vote and or created these longer lines because of Covid regulations on capacity
1315730109333028864 2020-10-13 03:04:37 +0800 <stephen_point> @ErinMayeQuade It‚Äôs literally the definition of checks and balances! Republicans held the senate they did what they thought was best! They still hold the senate therefore they are doing their job! Court packing would be an egregious overstep by adding more judges just to get your way
1315682816693170176 2020-10-12 23:56:42 +0800 <stephen_point> @amyklobuchar Well he was fairly elected president soooo when he picks the judge it is our pick

1313883308682440704 2020-10-08 00:46:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @GovTimWalz any chance you will be doing a round table with business owners in Minnesota! The one‚Äôs directly impacted and having to shut down their business ? Or are you only willing to do it with people that will boast about your ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù
1313876461380497410 2020-10-08 00:18:53 +0800 <stephen_point> Literally trying to control people between bites or food! Give it a rest!

Tim Walz is anti business and is destroying our small business community! And then goes to memorial services with 200+ and does stuff like this! It‚Äôs sad and we need people like you to call him out! Thank you @TonyJurgensMN
1313318454833807360 2020-10-06 11:21:34 +0800 <stephen_point> All of those things he listed can only ‚Äúhappen‚Äù with more government control! And I say ‚Äúhappen‚Äù because government can‚Äôt even solve them they just make it worse! I hope enough people realize this!

1313315306438189056 2020-10-06 11:09:03 +0800 <stephen_point> @jaketapper Try giving up your business and your livelihood because some government official said so! Don‚Äôt act like your pathetic mask wearing is some sort of sacrifice for the moral good

1311919035991224321 2020-10-02 14:40:47 +0800 <stephen_point> @hasanthehun Trump didn‚Äôt die from covid he tested positive. If he doesn‚Äôt have any systems or even just mild symptoms this will come out to be a win for him
1311904842500067329 2020-10-02 13:44:23 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill And when he has mild symptoms and is asymptotic it will prove him right
1311902370041798656 2020-10-02 13:34:33 +0800 <stephen_point> @realDonaldTrump getting Covid doesn‚Äôt prove him wrong, but Trump living through Covid or being asymptomatic proves him right
1311036440491425792 2020-09-30 04:13:39 +0800 <stephen_point> @ErinMayeQuade So now students can choose what locker room they want to use? What happened to being worried about rape culture?

1309241226072395777 2020-09-25 05:20:07 +0800 <stephen_point> @cenkuygur The tangibles are higher taxes, worse healthcare, less jobs, less freedom why would they talk about the tangible when its easy to promise things you can‚Äôt hold them accountable to
1308445153804406785 2020-09-23 00:36:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @KFCBarstool @Realronmexico99 You‚Äôre
1308445065283600385 2020-09-23 00:36:27 +0800 <stephen_point> @KFCBarstool @Realronmexico99 Also just a note, you were literally on stool scenes talking about how it‚Äôs the end of barstool as we know it because @stoolpresidente interviewed the president because it was becoming political and you wanted ‚Äúno part of that‚Äù so please explain why you‚Äôre making political clips?
1308444552789983234 2020-09-23 00:34:25 +0800 <stephen_point> @KFCBarstool @Realronmexico99 Your right Kevin defunding the police is a bad idea I‚Äôm glad we can agree! Maybe you should aim your political videos at your local leaders. You know the Mayor that like you sits in his ivory tower and tries to ignore the problems in your city
1308398419971629056 2020-09-22 21:31:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @KFCBarstool Only a pretentious asshole like you could stick up for the morality of a mob running around looting and destroying minority communities while you sit in your safe neighborhood and cheat on your pregnant wife
1308394170491469824 2020-09-22 21:14:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @KFCBarstool You couldn‚Äôt have looked more like a privileged asshole in that video mocking that your safe during all of this! What about all the business broken into and robbed? Try to have some empathy for them instead of mocking how safe your life is!

If he wants to post personal things on Twitter that‚Äôs his prerogative and if people want to express their displeasure for him they can do that too
1304487189942738944 2020-09-12 02:29:16 +0800 <stephen_point> I‚Äôm not one to boycott sports because of the kneeling for the anthem I don‚Äôt agree with it but don‚Äôt let it take away from the sport  but can some explain how it‚Äôs so ‚Äúbrave‚Äù when the NFL, all their sponsors, all of the media and majority of the public is backing them ?
1303423637169397760 2020-09-09 04:03:06 +0800 <stephen_point> @jemelehill Yes so courageous to make a player in a video game and it‚Äôs very similar to a team that has to manage cap space and a 53 man roster, offering a position to someone that hasn‚Äôt played in 4 years and is only willing to take a starting position üôÑ
1302694025590308865 2020-09-07 03:43:53 +0800 <stephen_point> Twitter followers do not equal supporters but it‚Äôs kind of funny to see people begging to get @JoeBiden to 10M while trump is at 87.5M
1302041597614252032 2020-09-05 08:31:22 +0800 <stephen_point> This is trash just like the models MN was basing all their measures off of
1302032906475376640 2020-09-05 07:56:50 +0800 <stephen_point> We have now been through Memorial Day and 4th of July with @GovTimWalz preaching fear of everyone dying of you go out and live your life! Yet we haven‚Äôt seen a spike in deaths! Go live your life this Labor Day while fat boy eats waffles
1302030007372398592 2020-09-05 07:45:18 +0800 <stephen_point> My take on the impact of the Atlantic story: Trump supporters: anonymous sources clearly lies to hurt trump   Biden supporters: trump hates the military how could you support him   Independent: the media will lie about anything I won‚Äôt base my vote on this story or the media.
1302027741668110336 2020-09-05 07:36:18 +0800 <stephen_point> The government is trying to act like the hero by not allowing owners to evict renters that can‚Äôt pay but the IRS is still making business owners pay their taxes and charging interest even if your business has been shut down the to Covid!
1302018157868011520 2020-09-05 06:58:13 +0800 <stephen_point> @stillgray Pretty disgusting!
1302007209837166594 2020-09-05 06:14:43 +0800 <stephen_point> People calling the people having the wedding ‚Äúselfish‚Äù want everyone else to give up their freedoms to appease their own fear! Which one sounds more selfish to you ?
1302006508746682371 2020-09-05 06:11:56 +0800 <stephen_point> If bars are areas that spread the virus and Covid is as deadly as people want you to believe then isn‚Äôt @GovTimWalz sending these health officials on a suicide mission ?
1302006090591330309 2020-09-05 06:10:16 +0800 <stephen_point> This is disgusting! ‚ÄúCompliance check‚Äù obey or have your life destroyed because a virus that has a incredibly low death rate might harm you!
1302005484703154176 2020-09-05 06:07:52 +0800 <stephen_point> @vjzrqa @msepic @MPRnews @mnhealth You‚Äôre a selfish asshole for letting your fear dictate other people‚Äôs lives stay inside put on 4 masks and hide if you‚Äôre that scared! 56 cases no deaths! Cases increase and deaths decrease meaning this virus is not as deadly as they want you to think it is
1301998379686391811 2020-09-05 05:39:38 +0800 <stephen_point> @CNN FEAR FEAR FEAR that‚Äôs all they can promote right now and it‚Äôs disgusting! What about the models that said millions would die ? Does anyone trust or believe ignorant articles like that
1301954121256169472 2020-09-05 02:43:46 +0800 <stephen_point> @hasanthehun So you‚Äôre saying the shut downs don‚Äôt work ?

1301271151721590784 2020-09-03 05:29:53 +0800 <stephen_point> @RevTChristopher So sad to see! More jobs lost, more tax revenue lost for the city of Minneapolis
1301269291694653441 2020-09-03 05:22:30 +0800 <stephen_point> F this world! People attacking @KirkCousins8 for wearing a mask out of respect but not living in fear while completely ignoring @SpeakerPelosi actions of not wearing a mask! How can you call yourself honest ?
1301268289897869314 2020-09-03 05:18:31 +0800 <stephen_point> @SouhanStrib how many people have you blocked today! If you stand behind your opinion don‚Äôt be a coward and block everyone with a difference of opinion! Enjoy your echo chamber
1301266280473702400 2020-09-03 05:10:32 +0800 <stephen_point> You don‚Äôt say!!! Business owners need to get together and sue the city of Minneapolis! Their taxes pay for protection
1301265914948583424 2020-09-03 05:09:05 +0800 <stephen_point> @SenSchumer GOOOOOD! It‚Äôs an awful pyramid scheme that does not work! Stop taking it out of our paychecks and educate people on a Roth IRA tell me which one yields you more returns at retirement!
1301265540409778176 2020-09-03 05:07:35 +0800 <stephen_point> Politicians work for us! They serve the people! It is not the other way around! We need to stop glorifying these idiots and start taking the power of the people back!
1301265333903216640 2020-09-03 05:06:46 +0800 <stephen_point> Coward! This is your party! No empathy for business owners no empathy for weddings being canceled, funerals going unattended just a bitter old drunk that only cares about her political power
1301264861431693312 2020-09-03 05:04:53 +0800 <stephen_point> Wow instead of @SpeakerPelosi taking responsibility for acting above the law she trashes the small business owner and says she is owed an apology! This should tell you all you need to know about democrats mindset when it comes to Americans! Bow down or get out of my way
1301261381191176192 2020-09-03 04:51:04 +0800 <stephen_point> More tax revenue lost for Minneapolis!  Maybe @MayorFrey is playing 4D chess... no need to defund the police if you don‚Äôt have any funds!
1301193999764484099 2020-09-03 00:23:19 +0800 <stephen_point> @stillgray @GovTimWalz and @MayorFrey
1301185612385452033 2020-09-02 23:49:59 +0800 <stephen_point> @citypages You‚Äôre the worst! Ignorant reporting to fit your narrative!
1301185146389843968 2020-09-02 23:48:08 +0800 <stephen_point> @SKihne So much for checks and balances
1300951171515912192 2020-09-02 08:18:24 +0800 <stephen_point> @cmarinucci That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre worried about! Smh
1300918184409669633 2020-09-02 06:07:19 +0800 <stephen_point> @ChrisCuomo That‚Äôs weird Chris never saw you say anything about burning of businesses until you realized it hurts your polling! Now you try to cast a stone as if the trump supporters drove there to harm citizens when they were trying to peacefully drive down the road and having rocks thrown
1300889488634200064 2020-09-02 04:13:18 +0800 <stephen_point> @_RyanWinkler Maybe that‚Äôs because more lives have been impacted and destroyed by the riots! And the arbitrary laws around COVID are hurting lives and small businesses too! How do you not see the difference in not wanting to let someone riot and loot vs not letting someone open their business
1300810927218909190 2020-09-01 23:01:07 +0800 <stephen_point> I‚Äôm offended by both comments! @MayorFrey is clearly the worst!
1300624626679033856 2020-09-01 10:40:50 +0800 <stephen_point> @SharikaSoal84 @HillaryClinton does
1300623869145825281 2020-09-01 10:37:49 +0800 <stephen_point> @robreiner Get your eyes checked
