1343955631385010177 2020-12-30 00:22:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> The 1% largely controlling politics have zero understanding, or concern, for anything about the lives of the rest of people. They don’t care and they don’t have to care. We’ve gotta fix this situation.

1343945949169774593 2020-12-29 23:44:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> If Americans value education WE CAN FULLY FUND EDUCATION from Pre-K, through graduate. Problem we currently have is Republicans rely ON PEOPLE BEING QUITE STUPID
1343945264915165190 2020-12-29 23:41:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> No. It’s not. Scarcity, austerity is a mind set promulgated by conservatives, once they’ve raked everything off for themselves. It is not real. WE CAN AFFORD TO EDUCATE OUR POPULACE if we politically decide it’s what we value!
1343944547303366658 2020-12-29 23:38:44 +0800 <bluedillygal> Agree. But we are rich. Aren’t we? Support/fund all students at every level. This should be a priority. We are rich. The richest nation? WHAT IS IT FOR? Support education. P.S. MUST uncouple public education funding from property taxes. Biggest debacle of decisions EVER.

1343941762646097921 2020-12-29 23:27:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> Help all students! Pre-K through graduate. Educated people have critical thinking skills. Just sayin

1343936155541237762 2020-12-29 23:05:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> ALL OF IT. We are rich. Tax the rich like Eisenhower!!!! Infrastructure. What we need!

1343934011186491393 2020-12-29 22:56:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> Regular people spend every dollar they get. They can’t keep up with what is owed. Needed. Money injected into our economy and distributed across all members = automatic economic boost. Regular people need stuff, buy stuff. Super rich just hoard money. This is frankly, DISGUSTING
1343933116524732416 2020-12-29 22:53:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> @volunteermom113 @tomwatson Any amount of student debt forgiven will boost the economy accordingly. Regular normal people who have the increased ability to participate and spend boosts our economy. For better or worse, currently, our American economy is a consumer economy, tied to spending. That’s how it is
1343932180532240390 2020-12-29 22:49:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> Any money to regular folks IS ECONOMIC STIMULUS. Duh. Regular people spend money. Into the ECONOMY. Super rich just hoard money. This IS NOT COMPLICATED.

1342152870796423168 2020-12-25 00:59:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MikeJMika Of course I don’t wear my mask inside my own car. I line them up on the dashboard and let the sun do its blistering thing. Florida. Cars become ovens pretty fast.

1340431242077085696 2020-12-20 06:58:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> No disrespect meant, President Biden, in fact it is with deepest respect I call you “Wart,” and I think of you as the boy who pulled the sword from the stone. I’m not kidding. I am also crying. Thank you. Thank you. Wart.
1340428040699043840 2020-12-20 06:45:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> Why? Why does he do this? He’s not dumb. Is it some political ploy? It just seems so stupid. He can’t see what we all see? Trumpism is a white nationalist cult. We need to think of de-culting, not coddling.

1338918926663770113 2020-12-16 02:48:42 +0800 <bluedillygal> The word “decimate” sounds really bad but technically means to reduce by ten percent. Usually what people mean is “devastate,” which is to destroy widely, or wholly.  https://t.co/RFh3uud8xG

1338838525408649224 2020-12-15 21:29:13 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is at least two things consistently. He is self-obsessed, and he’s a racist. Those two flaws alone should have meant he would never be president.

1338777162472681472 2020-12-15 17:25:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Politics_PR @JJManring Excellent summary of our dilemma. However, the very last line is premature. Let’s give Biden some running room. He’s no greenhorn; he has an extremely delicate task to both seek justice and sew the splitting seams. I trust him.
1338653640354095104 2020-12-15 09:14:33 +0800 <bluedillygal> Biden is the one for this moment. We are blessed and I am so proud right now.

1338489875876749312 2020-12-14 22:23:49 +0800 <bluedillygal> @JHVI1 @buitengebieden_ Speaking of musical cops- landed our boat in Nassau, 1979, in time to catch the end of a Governor’s reception on a terrace. Guests and dignitaries were all leaving. A large troupe of uniformed police played them away on brass instruments. We got to finish the leftover rum punch.
1338488332314169348 2020-12-14 22:17:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> @JHVI1 @buitengebieden_ Abandoned piano surprisingly in tune. But man, the guy can play tho

1338453162798292993 2020-12-14 19:57:55 +0800 <bluedillygal> LB, when you mention The Silent One I always think of Elizabeth von Arnim, her fabulous, droll books and her nickname for her husband The Man of Wrath  https://t.co/DvStZS36YW she is truly a treasure, if you haven’t met her, you’re in for a treat.

1338310606613581825 2020-12-14 10:31:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> Because (shhhhhh) she’s a racist?
1338310341630054402 2020-12-14 10:30:24 +0800 <bluedillygal> You could have drafted a random checker at the Circle K and gotten a more competent President than Donald John Trump.
1338308669784662016 2020-12-14 10:23:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> The way our country is presenting right now- we’d of lost WWII. Think about it. These whiners, losers, anarchists currently in the headlines- proud boogers, whatever the hell they call themselves- they’d of lost World War Two. Thank god they weren’t even born. Thank god.

1338276907641663490 2020-12-14 08:17:33 +0800 <bluedillygal> Never shoulda let those  Confederates go free. Big mistake. Ripple effect.

1338275758209454081 2020-12-14 08:12:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> We can’t go THERE. That gives them legitimacy, what they SAY (blather/rant) they want, which as lame-ass armchair soldiers, as most of them are, is ridiculous annyhoo. We cannot descend into the nihilistic chaos these provocateurs “want”
1338274142173487104 2020-12-14 08:06:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Why? The virus is a Democratic hoax, as Dear Leader has opined many times. Why would Whitehouse staffers, or anyone allied with Dear Leader wish to be “vaccinated” for a hoax? I’M SO CONFUSED
1338273147078979588 2020-12-14 08:02:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> Just a thought... but you know, Ken, that’s asking too much. WHICH IS THE PROBLEM. We face.

It’s my fave. I do recall Melanie being quoted saying “F*%# Chreesmas” and I think that’s the ONLY person I’ve ever heard say that. These people are 100% deranged

1337473561401942020 2020-12-12 03:05:20 +0800 <bluedillygal> @rubyinparadise This book, I got a used paperback for cheap. It’s also free to download on Google Books. It’s freaking fascinating. She was tenacious.
1337465469209554949 2020-12-12 02:33:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> @rubyinparadise Here is a book that might interest: Woman, Church and State by Matilda Joslyn Gage, 1893. Matilda was originally one of The Triumvirate, a nickname people had for her, Stanton and Anthony. She was basically erased from suffrage history because she called out the church’s sexism

1337140093660893190 2020-12-11 05:00:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> Especially not a batshit crazy guy bent on revenge
1337139546786586633 2020-12-11 04:58:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> ‘Defund the police’ is a cry from the people. We must be savvy tho- it was used to inflame fear, by Republicans. WE MUST OUT SMART THEIR MESSAGING. Our first target is corrupt police unions. Number 1 problem. Let’s message THAT. Think! Corrupt Unions. We can work with that frame
1337137763594940417 2020-12-11 04:51:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> I am so heartbroken surveying this mess. What even is this? I can’t tell where the white supremacy bleeds into the Russian influence bleeds into the corporate lobbyists bleeds into the power hungry megalomaniacs. It is ALL TERRIFYING AND HORRIFYING. The GOP’s morphed into Mothra.
1337125041524383744 2020-12-11 04:00:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> Dr Scarf yes! She gets to head up the whole thing, accept the inflowing kudos, all the awards. Yes! I vote Dr Scarrf to be Kelso.

1336729791890923523 2020-12-10 01:49:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> @BaddCompani Doug Jones. He tenaciously prosecuted the Birmingham Bombers. No Trump related stuff would he need to recuse from.

1336353311570661378 2020-12-09 00:53:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> I really think whatever the Russians hacked from RNC SmartTech is damning. What? WHAT is so damning they would kow-tow to Trump as they have. It is horrifying to contemplate.

Hillary warned us, but many did not heed her prescience. After FOUR YEARS OF THIS MADMAN many people were SHOCKED into voting. Who can’t figure this out? This election was a referendum REJECTING TRUMP. Easy.

1336292857188147202 2020-12-08 20:53:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> @LincolnsBible For some reason our littlest sister’s bed got to be the dump spot for clean laundry. I think we hid it there when we were supposed to have folded it. Some mornings she would just emerge, with wild hair, from under the pile.
1336291794582122496 2020-12-08 20:49:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> Me too! Laundry is the best chore. My daughter calls me the laundry fairy. When I visit I go into crank mode. Just start whipping through all the things like a general.

1335693278344253449 2020-12-07 05:11:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is like that weird ghost corn hull, from watching a perfectly benign movie- with popcorn tho- days later you’re like wtf laid siege TO MY MOUTH.

1335691959759933440 2020-12-07 05:05:53 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is like what you hope you can find another family member, with a stronger stomach, to hose off the bottom of your shoe.
1335691442463838209 2020-12-07 05:03:50 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is like what’s on that long, skinny, flexi bristle-brush when you pull it up from the drain hole, just sayin.
1335689245290336258 2020-12-07 04:55:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> Sorry about Rudy. Omg-he caught it? After all the severe hygiene protocols he, and everyone he associated with followed? 🤪 Yeah, right.

1335685124093054977 2020-12-07 04:38:44 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m so sorry. Dark days turn me inward to create art. If you don’t feel that- I one hundred percent say - you use this current dark (bulb) time of storing energy- yes, yes it is- to plan a move to a more friendly place for your spirit. Figure out that place, and make a plan ❤️❤️
1335673409791950848 2020-12-07 03:52:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m so sorry. I can’t even bear that grief. THAT SUCKS

1335660086761566209 2020-12-07 02:59:14 +0800 <bluedillygal> It’s the porous nature of our power structure, aka democracy, that makes our nation vulnerable, yet invulnerable. Democracy is our enshrined value. Above all. We must, as Americans, take all measures to ensure that sanctity. We MUST ensure election security as a TOP PRIORITY 100%

Watching The Office for the ninetybazillionth time. Or Scrubs. All 9 seasons. And recently rewatched Monk- all seasons. Twice. I can only handle the familiar and loved, right now.

1335312593532149760 2020-12-06 03:58:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> Isn’t there some kind of legal way to put Erik Prince in jail for some one of his crimes.

1335310831748321282 2020-12-06 03:51:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. This. Doug Jones successfully prosecuted two of the Birmingham Bombers. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔

A USA shaped cake, covered in fondant- with blue patches where critical, and omg! People live. Can we balance where people live? IS THIS A PERTINENT QUESTION? Hmmm? Where actual people live
1334600770583465984 2020-12-04 04:49:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> @glennkirschner2 Who knows why Pence would do anything. Other than weirdly adoring looks a Trump in public photos- who is the guy and what does he stand for. Oh and what happened to that really cute Nick Ayers fellow? He was totes adorbs.
1334586723536412674 2020-12-04 03:54:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> Are you fucking kidding me. Surely this is a joke
1334586478060597249 2020-12-04 03:53:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> ❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
1334586302273114114 2020-12-04 03:52:24 +0800 <bluedillygal> See Mary L Trump’s book. You will be able to frame our national problem much better.
1334585848399007744 2020-12-04 03:50:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> Oh my god I am so sorry.
1334585453715001345 2020-12-04 03:49:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> We are keeping our democracy. That is number one priority. Number one.
1334583565586231296 2020-12-04 03:41:32 +0800 <bluedillygal> What. All I’ve ever been here for is to amplify truth, help get it out. Maybe a little love, some love for our animal brethren, some humor. And can we share some joy? Who has some, I want that.
1334582354082488322 2020-12-04 03:36:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> @ThomasKatty44 What?
1334582203850911744 2020-12-04 03:36:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is a money launderer for the mob. Long time. Some of y’all should have looked that up. Cause all kinda problems if President if the US. THIS IS A BIG FUCKING DEAL. Y’all. Big deal.

1334556144430440451 2020-12-04 01:52:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MattBoxer94 Joe Biden is literally like the boy who pulled the sword from the stone. We are blessed.

1334554188945174530 2020-12-04 01:44:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> Plus the Dominionist actors near Trump. Yes, it’s confusing 😳
1334553973504741380 2020-12-04 01:43:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> We need to put a lot of money and love toward Puerto Rico y’all.
1334553614086508546 2020-12-04 01:42:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> Vice President Elect Harris was the one 2020 candidate who won my heart. I loved many of them, deep bench talent! But Kamala? I was slain. To see so much smart-tough wrapped in so much joy-love. I just fell in love! Now I cannot be PROUDER OF OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT ❤️❤️👏👏❤️❤️
1334552678932869126 2020-12-04 01:38:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Zeddary Lincoln utterly fascinates. He looks like no one I’ve ever seen. His face seems etched with all of human history. Suffering, humor, joy, sadness. His photographic image is mesmerizing. I wish we could have him with us now. So much has changed. Who would he be?

1333859596876779520 2020-12-02 03:44:44 +0800 <bluedillygal> Ooops. Barr goes under the bus. “What a scumbag he didn’t love me hard enough”
1333859060207259653 2020-12-02 03:42:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
1333854514424770560 2020-12-02 03:24:32 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MolBioSciSF Yes. Horrifically sobering. Nothing like horror to get one sober.
1333853348458602497 2020-12-02 03:19:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> After all this time, the simplest among them couldn’t see that Trump is all about “me me me- eff you- it’s me.” How can anybody not get that? Makes me tremble for the American electorate. Seriously. Who gets played like that? This is a Nigerian Prince level con. R We That Dumb 😱
1333850884049133569 2020-12-02 03:10:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> This batshittery Trump stuff has been inflicted on the United States of America. Trump is certifiable. Republicans around him are terrified of the ignorant angry base they’ve made. THIS IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT.
1333844642442469382 2020-12-02 02:45:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Heard of this. Could not be diagnosed.
1333843650124673026 2020-12-02 02:41:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m always  reminded the red rose group were the anti-woman suffrage. Wut? Woman suffrage wore the yellow rose. 😭😭😭 is this a total accident?
1333839596573089793 2020-12-02 02:25:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> How do we rid ourselves of this scourge? Sincerely askin
1333839057042944001 2020-12-02 02:23:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MolBioSciSF @SassyKadiK Sage. Moxa. De bugging. Omg. It is filthy with disease, with foreign bugs, maybe depths of depravity we have not even imagined
1333833309076529155 2020-12-02 02:00:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> Just someone not a pol-don’t pick Rahm  FOR ANYTHING just sayin. Lifelong Dem just sayin DO NOT DO THIS THING
1333831948419158016 2020-12-02 01:54:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> SUCH A GROSS MONEY GRUBBING PIG. So observable.  Why? Why? How are so many people so easily duped? It really makes me kind of panicked that a huge portion of Americans are  NOT EDUCATED AT ALL 😳😳😳😳WTHF?
1333830299239800833 2020-12-02 01:48:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m really tired of this criminal slipping. Doesn’t anything ever have teeth for Justice
1333829597603958785 2020-12-02 01:45:32 +0800 <bluedillygal> “Business Insider Miller” is born,  and thriving. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO CELEBRATE THIS AS AMERICANS? Can I puke on them enough? Like tons of garbage, puke, medical waste- is there anything gross enough for these Nazis? Seriously?

1333826547258634245 2020-12-02 01:33:24 +0800 <bluedillygal> People who pretend to believe in Biblical shit- BUT 100% PICK AND CHOOSE- you are enabling a bizarre cult thing. #GetAClue who you dream has your best interests at heart. Doesn’t. GOP doesn’t give a rat’s ass about you. Only about them. It’s true.
1333824273048285184 2020-12-02 01:24:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> I call on TikTok bretheren around the world to exorcise this demon.

1333822410550898690 2020-12-02 01:16:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. It’s the thing. Omg. Yes. Women rise the fuck up. Women rise the fuck up. C’mon WOMEN. YOU CAN DOMINATE. Do you want a sexual abuser to be anything? This guy should be beneath contempt. Beyond any political redemption   https://t.co/xIe5fUoMhr

1333809973634215942 2020-12-02 00:27:33 +0800 <bluedillygal> @CMargaronis Worst. Patient. Ever.
1333809700966690821 2020-12-02 00:26:28 +0800 <bluedillygal> @CMargaronis My husband was so bad. Staff caught him sneaking out. They stole his clothes.
1333809369012727808 2020-12-02 00:25:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> @mhdksafa Take heart. We are much closer to being rid of the Trump Crime Family than we were just weeks ago. Let Biden’s victory give you hope we will not slide into North Korean style dictatorship.  Not this time! Stay! Help us right the ship. Every voice counts ❤️
1333808272026066945 2020-12-02 00:20:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> Could it be? Americans have been inured by mass death. Difference? One mass military gun (should be ILLEGAL) execution event, happens in one place. 😭now it’s from every direction, if media even carries it 😭
1333807098325557248 2020-12-02 00:16:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> @CMargaronis Just hover like a totally annoying policeperson. Make him do exactly what they tell him to do. Only. No more, no less. I believe they know their stuff #LearnedTheHardWay ❤️
1333806506039500800 2020-12-02 00:13:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> @CMargaronis Just talking from experience. Could not resist the tournament. I think it really fucked him up.
1333800099080675330 2020-12-01 23:48:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> @HeheWaitWhut @missb62 And my eldest, Business Insider Miller...
1333799649245708289 2020-12-01 23:46:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> And it fills her ears. That’s what I think.
1333799304977215489 2020-12-01 23:45:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> @IditarodJeff Yeah. Pretty mind blowing. Long story. Contracted by a disgruntled geologist to survey miles of placer claims, and make Anaconda buy his rights for their airstrips. I think he was nuts. It was amazing.
1333798267163840515 2020-12-01 23:41:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> I love you soooo much Keith. I really miss Thurber. Will you have time to read to us again?
1333797915328876549 2020-12-01 23:39:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> @CMargaronis I hope it goes so well! Do not let him play volleyball a few days after surgery. Tie him down.

1333797027470217217 2020-12-01 23:36:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> @ninaburleigh Pardon me but I suspect this person took her cues from Melania. I suspect Melania wants to be very rich, and left alone. Melania does not seem to grasp, nor wish to grasp, anything about what First Lady means to America. That photo of her eating jewels like Cheerios is who she is
1333795020990603271 2020-12-01 23:28:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> She is gross. There is an economic term for what she is.
1333794768845819907 2020-12-01 23:27:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> @RealKHiveQueenB What they don’t value is democracy. That horrifies me. We Dems must lead, and thread the needle. Sew our ridiculously diverse country together in a way that uplifts, protects, and inspires. They only view through a narrow glass which disregards most of our people. They could help
1333793357068341255 2020-12-01 23:21:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> @LeftofLeftEye Two weeks won’t help unless she changes that behavior tho.
1333741973887442944 2020-12-01 19:57:20 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MikeGrunwald @djrothkopf If Biden is thinking Rahm- I’m like, ok. He’s got a plan for that. Biden is perhaps the most knowledgeable and experienced President in American history. Which dear god yes we need right now. God/Thor/Gaia bless Biden.

1333572130739539972 2020-12-01 08:42:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> Didn’t we feel so cozy, and blessed, with Keith reading to us? I was honored to be part of the audience.

1333563299510759425 2020-12-01 08:07:21 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m sorry. That’s my worst nightmare. I’m doing everything possible to not let it happen. But it still may happen! All the blessings and strength to you. EAT RAW GARLIC. Always my advice for disease. Flush with lots of water. 6 times a day, chomp a clove or two. Take with water😊

1333560687264751616 2020-12-01 07:56:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> @pozvibes4u Under duress EAT RAW GARLIC. I’ve had it kill strep. Eat a couple cloves, chomped down with lots of water, like six times a day if you’re fighting something bad. Also- raw fresh ginger root.Boil chopped,  into tea. If respiratory illness,capture steam of boiling ginger with towel
1333559623132078080 2020-12-01 07:52:45 +0800 <bluedillygal> Duh
1333558094882877440 2020-12-01 07:46:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> @SusanBordo @emarvelous Dressing what even is that? Stuffing!  And long ago, we learned it needed to be baked separately, in a giant pan of stuffingness, for safety. Duh.
1333553722153164814 2020-12-01 07:29:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😳😳😳💔
1333553218215964672 2020-12-01 07:27:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> So gross. Like they think we’ll just send satin bows and puffy clouds? These are gross disgusting genocidal persons WHO HATE PEOPLE FOR NO REASON.
1333549686070898689 2020-12-01 07:13:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> My Queen. Hillary is our champion. She’s in our corner

1333546190642835456 2020-12-01 06:59:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> She is a goddam bitch from hell
1333546039169736704 2020-12-01 06:58:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> Andrea Mitchell has some agenda which is obscure to me. She ripped Hillary, every chance. That I thought was girl jealous. Knocking Biden? FOR NO FUCKING REASON? Who pays you, B? Who? Serious question. You aren’t on the level
1333545043370631174 2020-12-01 06:54:49 +0800 <bluedillygal> According to John McCain, Rand Paul works for Putin. McCain was no dummy. Why would he say that?
1333544587412037632 2020-12-01 06:53:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> Andrea Mitchell needs to toddlealong to Madame Tussaud’s. She is an anachronistic couch doily. Bye!
1333543980894728192 2020-12-01 06:50:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> A cat
1333543815383314437 2020-12-01 06:49:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Hard to hate anyone more than Rand Paul. It’s hard.
1333543545198800905 2020-12-01 06:48:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> 100% Dr. Cox. Who’s an ass, with a heart of gold. Opposite of this guy.
1333542981752774658 2020-12-01 06:46:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> Why would anybody make a Christmas pathway of black urns. Who would make that? Not me. I’d never make that thing.
1333542578076196864 2020-12-01 06:45:01 +0800 <bluedillygal> So not the Shining. Not alien abductions. A very restrained well mannered funeral home. Nice.
1333541926637867009 2020-12-01 06:42:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> Seriously. My first thought. Funeral Home. 😊maybe what she’s thinking.
1333538461077426178 2020-12-01 06:28:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Emily Murphy is the Kim Davis of Anita Bryants
1333537626851332097 2020-12-01 06:25:20 +0800 <bluedillygal> He got dropped on his head poor baby. Flynn is a renegade baby. How do we address this? Have we ever seen a traitor baby?
1333537030547140612 2020-12-01 06:22:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> Omg right? North Korea level crap for Trumpie. He’s so whiny! Gottahave him some obsequious praise, or his digestion goes totally off.
1333536186242043908 2020-12-01 06:19:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> @fooduz Very cool
1333528763200647168 2020-12-01 05:50:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> He’s dangerous filled with evil. Dogs just naturally hate him. Dogs are very smart.
1333527752717328387 2020-12-01 05:46:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> Is McConnell sick?
1333527716214280192 2020-12-01 05:45:57 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MikeGrunwald @djrothkopf If Biden is thinking Rahm- I’m like, ok. He’s got a plan for that. Biden is perhaps the most knowledgeable and experienced President in American history. Which dear god yes we need right now. God/Thor/Gaia bless Biden.
1333526380382986243 2020-12-01 05:40:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MPictures2019 @MattBoxer94 ASTRONAUT. He is a fucking astronaut. Military clearances, and every which way the guy could be scrutinized. Omg
1333525833382834184 2020-12-01 05:38:29 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Invite me.
1333525721323606018 2020-12-01 05:38:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> No. Do tell. I’ll pile on. He’s gross! Creepy weird guy. WHICH I KNEW - before I saw his house for sale- which included a wall of guns as dining fucking room decor. He is twisted, rich, totally off. What a fucking weirdo.
1333524602199400448 2020-12-01 05:33:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> So that guy’s blocked. I’m guessing he’s just a pontificating ass.
1333518939767386113 2020-12-01 05:11:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> Amen
1333518856346857474 2020-12-01 05:10:45 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Plus he told us no one would ever mention Covid again, after Election Day 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

1333518114726797313 2020-12-01 05:07:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> @ImSoConfused225 Yes. 😭😭😭
1333517876045762560 2020-12-01 05:06:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> @IditarodJeff Alaska is breathtaking. Went in the bush, by air past Fairbanks, doing survey work. One night we realized we’d pitched our tent on a migration path. Laid there all night long while single-file caribou literally brushed the sides. Omg.
1333516161632378886 2020-12-01 05:00:03 +0800 <bluedillygal> Elvis Costello too. 😭😭😭

1333502752266317826 2020-12-01 04:06:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> @thedailybeast @alainademop It’s not The Shining, handmaid trees, nor alien abduction themed Chreesmas. Seems kinda normal. But I’m sorry, what is up with the funeral pathway of black urns. Wishful thinking?

1333086941999411206 2020-11-30 00:34:29 +0800 <bluedillygal> @tonicrochet Adlai Stevenson was THE MAN
1333086764060315649 2020-11-30 00:33:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> @tonicrochet I have my Dad’s “All the Way With Adlai” button. It’s a winky-blinky- PRIZED possession. ❤️
1333084604107010053 2020-11-30 00:25:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😳. Change him? Argh
1333084407327055878 2020-11-30 00:24:24 +0800 <bluedillygal> Eisenhower was the last benign Republican.
1333084177974120453 2020-11-30 00:23:30 +0800 <bluedillygal> Cultural phrase. Very Rock bottom. Resonance. I’m a part of my culture. I don’t personally believe there is a “god” - but for shorthand emphasis- you can’t do stronger. I am not threatened by believers, unless they come at me with politics. Then, gloves are off.
1333078681066098690 2020-11-30 00:01:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Ok. But don’t you wake up at some point, repudiate the con, expose it? Isn’t that normal? If you realize the Prince of Nigeria conned you- don’t you then put him on blast? To get justice?
1333077797619773441 2020-11-29 23:58:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> Question I’ve had for a while. They have sneakily slid around, behind the frame, to oppose everything America stands for. Why? How? Why and how did this happen? Is it money? Dark money? Is that the reason why? Flabbergasted at traitors to USA claiming to be GOP. 😳
1333076705053970433 2020-11-29 23:53:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> What is new here?
1333076580172783617 2020-11-29 23:53:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> Eeeeew
1333076571356323843 2020-11-29 23:53:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> Wouldn’t that just fit! He successfully prosecuted two of the Birmingham bombers. God I love this man.  https://t.co/5F3eEpgqfx
1333076046623727617 2020-11-29 23:51:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> Because WE WERE ON GUARD, after 2016. Duh!
1333075575309799430 2020-11-29 23:49:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> Oh. Thank. God. And I’m not religious. But I thank god. This bullshit. This shitshow of ridiculous “legal” claims- orchestrated by a clown-coup of “lawyers” WILL GO DOWN IN FLAMES
1333063815181766658 2020-11-29 23:02:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> GTHOH, Cornyn, you hypocrite
1333051323055484929 2020-11-29 22:12:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> It makes no sense. Wrong lens to parse this
1333051079630741505 2020-11-29 22:11:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Isn’t it? Handmaids gonna Handmaid tho
1333050878027329539 2020-11-29 22:11:10 +0800 <bluedillygal> They are a super weird, pathetic duo. Just really gross. Embarrassing

1333050082732728320 2020-11-29 22:08:01 +0800 <bluedillygal> Try “Patriot” it’s cool and quirky. Oh- wait, it’s on Amazon Prime, I think. I loved it.

1332829675412971522 2020-11-29 07:32:12 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Sigmundine2 @eminently_me5 I had an account since 2006. Couldn’t figure out what it was for. Then Eric Garner was murdered, and I was drawn to protest. On here, and in person. I Can’t Breathe 😭💔🇺🇸 never looked back. Ya Me Canse. 47 Traitors. Je suis Charlie. I realized this community was to rally &amp; learn
1332826897835823105 2020-11-29 07:21:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> @janemarielynch @RexChapman Remember the Smothers Brothers? More life lessons in the guise of comedy. It was a desert in the 60s. A televised oasis of intelligence was a bfd.
1332825941542887429 2020-11-29 07:17:21 +0800 <bluedillygal> @fantagor Can’t you vision it either way?
1332814427918364672 2020-11-29 06:31:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> We all should not buy Melania’s book. You know she’s going to play the victim. She won’t tell anything of importance. Just bunk for some dollars.
1332813470560104450 2020-11-29 06:27:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> @LisaTalmadge Yup. Truth, y’all.
1332813079239925762 2020-11-29 06:26:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> Maybe masses of people need to cut cable. I did three years ago. I don’t miss it one bit. Netflix and such is fine. When I see someone’s tv on cable I am repulsed by the commercials! I’d forgotten that was a thing. So gross. Not one minute will I endure that crap you pay to watch
1332802209394946053 2020-11-29 05:43:03 +0800 <bluedillygal> @QuancyClayborne God they just chew our ankles whenever we get some traction. I wish they’d go be Republicans already. That’s who they’re helping. Just go. Be a Republican, leave us in peace.
1332800835412242432 2020-11-29 05:37:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> He’s pathological. Cannot help it. Trump is a very sick man. De-humanized. He is ill.
1332800273874563072 2020-11-29 05:35:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> @juliaioffe @NatashaBertrand Brilliant pick! Go Team Biden ❤️
1332793602917928964 2020-11-29 05:08:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> Killing his people. Not a leader. He’s a criminal.

1332789131295019013 2020-11-29 04:51:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> Amen 🙏🙏🙏and Amen.
1332786871181717511 2020-11-29 04:42:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> I really liked having Obama as my President. I felt cared for, watched over, protected. He took his job very seriously. He cared about America. ///////////meanwhile, the ridiculous shit show of an embarrassing Trumpian circus cannot end a moment too soon.
1332785613993553921 2020-11-29 04:37:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> So Trump is planning to further spread the virus to his pathetic supporters.
1332785153912033282 2020-11-29 04:35:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> @thomaskaine5 Cruz is either dumb, or he just acts dumb. Can’t tell. Makes no difference.
1332781580318859269 2020-11-29 04:21:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is a small vindictive man, 100% bent on revenge. Do not “misunderestimate” his ability to do insidious damage. Like a small rabid rat, he may bite, and by this act, infect many. WE MUST ALL BE WATCHFUL 😳😳😳
1332779719285223429 2020-11-29 04:13:41 +0800 <bluedillygal> Except they won’t say the building is burning. Plus 666 babies are unaccounted for. It’s a clusterfuck.
1332779014747004933 2020-11-29 04:10:53 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Watch him become increasingly agitated
1332773502814998537 2020-11-29 03:48:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> IKR. Like if you made a weird doll.
1332746329060151298 2020-11-29 02:01:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump really thought DeJoy was his ace in the hole. He is melting down because it didn’t work. Now he is just flailing.
1332745651176792066 2020-11-29 01:58:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes
1332744892544655369 2020-11-29 01:55:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. This.
1332743598866100225 2020-11-29 01:50:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> Jesus was a poor guy, brown, probably a socialist, maybe a communist- I dunno. He certainly was not intending to be a mascot for fat-ass discriminatory and wealthy congregations to continually bless themselves, and deny help to the poor and marginalized.
1332742348472803333 2020-11-29 01:45:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> We are supposed to suck down religious extremists, but cough up reasonable religious people who actually follow Jesus
1332741198394613767 2020-11-29 01:40:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. True.
1332741039019483138 2020-11-29 01:39:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> God she’s weird. He’s very weird. Twilight Zone material. Not kidding.
1332740556632559617 2020-11-29 01:38:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> I hope Doug Jones is AG. He is a bulldog for Justice. I ❤️ him. He ❤️s us.
1332740136057118725 2020-11-29 01:36:24 +0800 <bluedillygal> Please yes!
1332739727120867328 2020-11-29 01:34:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> Do we ever get rid of him #RapistInChief my PTS wants to know. Are we done? Is he done?
1332713992347848706 2020-11-28 23:52:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> What the hell even is this weirdness. So bizarre. Why?
1332713558463885312 2020-11-28 23:50:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> Make a portapoddy and stick the seal on it.
1332713250321002496 2020-11-28 23:49:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> It would be a dog catches car scenario
1332713014311735298 2020-11-28 23:48:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> I think Doug Jones would be a stellar AG. He successfully prosecuted two of the Birmingham Church bombers. He never gave up. #HePersisted I love Doug Jones
1332711834382708737 2020-11-28 23:43:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Agree. Disgusting.

1332708886386790400 2020-11-28 23:32:13 +0800 <bluedillygal> Supreme Court better hear: if you throw out our democratic election for Joe Biden you are invoking civil war. He won. Fair and square, despite Trump’s severe efforts to cheat. Better tread lightly.
1332708022993494016 2020-11-28 23:28:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> Michael Moore has been a complete piece of shit for a while so. Who possibly cares what he opines? Just sayin

1332680609689456647 2020-11-28 21:39:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> @buitengebieden_ Eat your French fries fast, kids
1332499961423024131 2020-11-28 09:42:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Zeddary His buddy sucks too. 2020 keeps on taking
1332432114785120256 2020-11-28 05:12:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> Is he the only Governor? Thought he had some buddies, like Abbott doing the same thing?
1332432103481466880 2020-11-28 05:12:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> God he was awesome on screen
1332432070094811138 2020-11-28 05:12:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Sigmundine2 @criticalthotcop Well. I call them 1 and 2 because they coexisted. Many many cats before these. This was the latest dynamic. My cat, Widdy, was a bastard, everyone says, and Cutin, most admit was a bitch. Then Widdy died. Cutin is now super nice and a Princess. Vladimir Cutin is her full name.  https://t.co/1W3dpph35e
1332422458935271424 2020-11-28 04:34:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Sigmundine2 @criticalthotcop It varies so much. Cat number one and two hated each other. Cat 1, my cat, died. Now cat two is the sweetest, dearest thing. My daughter is fostering kittens. Her rather particular, perhaps finicky male cat is now Mr. Dad to the Fosters. He loves them. You just never know
1332419253140598785 2020-11-28 04:21:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> When you look at state government and you see a 100% Trump sycophant - then what do you see now? Hmmmm #DeathSantis hmmmm? Did you maybe pin your hopes on a criminal? A guy not well regarded, historically + YOU? Both of you are gross. Disgusting.
1332416164069257219 2020-11-28 04:09:03 +0800 <bluedillygal> @JaniceClaire14 I know. He is up Trump’s wherever. For all the good it’ll do him. Plus death to the people he’s supposed to look out for. I don’t get it.
1332411298601164801 2020-11-28 03:49:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> Gross. They don’t care who dies
1332409644665499655 2020-11-28 03:43:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> DeSantis is a weak Trump-wannabe. Trouble for him, he is killing his citizens and covering up the stats. He’s a criminal. Ranking right up there with the worst of the worst. #DeathSantis is really quite bad, as governors can be ranked.
1332408459288076289 2020-11-28 03:38:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> We all, most of us, know Michael Flynn is a traitor to the USA. Now that Trump has pardoned him- isn’t his legal jeopardy worse?
1332407855606079491 2020-11-28 03:36:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> So can Michael Flynn now not plead the 5th, refuse to testify, because he has admitted guilt? Is that the takeaway from his “pardon” ?
1332407140582035456 2020-11-28 03:33:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. 😭😭😭😭😭😭

1332405969012355073 2020-11-28 03:28:32 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump’s base is people who believe in white supremacy. Pass it on. That’s the deal. That’s the whole gross thing. That’s it. That’s the schlong. The whole kielbasa. The end. The story. That’s it. What he’s got. It is too rated X to even mention.
1332404576746692610 2020-11-28 03:23:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> Omg. Both equally gross. He is utterly disgusting and there under false pretenses #ITrustAnitaHill. Thomas is a gross liar and ConeyBarrett is some weird religious zealot. Good job, Trump. You fucktard.
1332403492271566850 2020-11-28 03:18:42 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭MAYBE
1332403351238086658 2020-11-28 03:18:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> I was brought to the south as a child. It was a RUDE awakening. I didn’t know of sundown towns. Yet I lived in one. And yet - we have the Allman Brothers, REM, Sister Hazel. Dicky Betts. Something good’ll come of all this. Just sayin. Hang on. Maybe Georgia turning blue is a sign
1332399308088471555 2020-11-28 03:02:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😭😭😭 omg why are will still pulled by the handle by this pervert rat bastard
1332398858387791873 2020-11-28 03:00:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> You rock for nerds. Omg. I LOVE YOU and I have no idea what is this! But you are GOOD. You have a great heart and are amazing. I played Tetris twice. Pong once. The end. More power to you adorable human!
1332397788332756998 2020-11-28 02:56:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> Do not underestimate the power of white. Whatever the fuck that is. It’s ridiculous. All “races” whathefuck THAT term even means. Humans have ALWAYS interbreeded- because we couldn’t breed with dogs who are VASTLY SUPERIOR.
1332396629975031809 2020-11-28 02:51:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> I had a dream Trump burned down the White House. Like literally. Flames and shit.
1332396199362650112 2020-11-28 02:49:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> I totally get my podcast people are taking a day or two off. 😭😭😭😭😭😭
1332395586046341124 2020-11-28 02:47:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> I was totally frothing. We exchanged words about who died, and who were patriots, drunkenly. And I was 100% ON FIRE about America, and WHAT IS AMERICA which is diversity. I was ready to take him out. But he was big. My friends probably wisely intervened 😂
1332394275435405313 2020-11-28 02:42:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> I don’t remember how it started- but I vividly remember being dragged off the barstool by my peeps when a Confederate flag wearing guy and I went to it. I was seething. They literally dragged me away.
1332393365724336128 2020-11-28 02:38:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> @SharonLockwood8 Robert Mitchum played a psychopath really well. He is awesome.
1332388158709915653 2020-11-28 02:17:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Get this. IT IS NOT CLASS, IT IS RACE. Lower socioeconomic white groups do not want to be rescued, unless and until they are rescued solely for being white, by white persons.
1332387257664352256 2020-11-28 02:14:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> Exactly.
1332385902774136832 2020-11-28 02:08:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> Thunder Road, 1958, stars also his son James.
1332382171269619729 2020-11-28 01:53:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> And so beautifully good. I love this precious film from our social archive. It. Is. Excellent.
1332372143745736709 2020-11-28 01:14:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> Great story!
1332341569849094144 2020-11-27 23:12:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> Have we seen the Resolute lately?
1332340449550487556 2020-11-27 23:08:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> Argh! So weird
1332340298639413255 2020-11-27 23:07:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> Omg. It’s a great film. Shelley Winters, Robert Mitchum (totally menacing) and Lillian Gish! It is one of my favorites.
1332338540307505152 2020-11-27 23:00:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> Me too
1332325042873626624 2020-11-27 22:06:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> I used to visit my friend in Ladbroke Grove. She had a very deep bathtub and copious hot water. That was my favorite thing.
1332324358145142784 2020-11-27 22:04:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> London was very cold and damp. Fish and chips were hot, and life.
1332324127382917120 2020-11-27 22:03:20 +0800 <bluedillygal> Delicious. So simple and hot.
1332323573248258058 2020-11-27 22:01:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. I always wondered how much of the ink came off on my food!
1332323350950121472 2020-11-27 22:00:14 +0800 <bluedillygal> @lauriedtmann @bfbuschi Well fish and chips was my other go to in London
1332320633154318341 2020-11-27 21:49:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> @lauriedtmann @bfbuschi Ploughman’s lunch brings back memories of London. That was always my thing, and a pint. Or two.
1332318504641572867 2020-11-27 21:40:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> Why don’t the super rich want to share? If I woke up and found myself super rich, my one burning desire would be to figure out how to share. They are so bloated and gross with wealth.
1332314703444537349 2020-11-27 21:25:53 +0800 <bluedillygal> Seriously has anybody explained the tiny table? It’s bizarre. Why?
1332312018477527040 2020-11-27 21:15:13 +0800 <bluedillygal> @mmpadellan Did he sell the Resolute on eBay already?
1332034408002572292 2020-11-27 02:52:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> @JeSuisAvecElle We had a Holiday Meal takeout from a local vegan restaurant, plus some French bread rolls and a salad from our garden. Excellent! Very delicious and I recommend!

1331707646840365056 2020-11-26 05:13:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes.
1331707141460267008 2020-11-26 05:11:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> It is disgusting
1331705926596882433 2020-11-26 05:06:49 +0800 <bluedillygal> Do we get a joyous announcement that Biden is absolutely President? Am I confused? This back and forth dribble of this that and the other thing Trump’s trying to pull. Do we get a declaration?
1331703079369134084 2020-11-26 04:55:30 +0800 <bluedillygal> He just wants to wreck anything, hurt anyone, on his way out. What a horrible little man.
1331690737210191875 2020-11-26 04:06:28 +0800 <bluedillygal> Exactly. Biden knows.
1331687507109539846 2020-11-26 03:53:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes
1331661494216511498 2020-11-26 02:10:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😭💔🇺🇸
1331661219523141634 2020-11-26 02:09:10 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m just so revolted by Trump, and anything to do with who he is, or how he does anything. What he thinks or who he supports. And his spawn, including in-laws. I hope soon we turn the page on this gross, disgusting chapter of the American story. We deserve better.
1331658668304179203 2020-11-26 01:59:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> Him and his Hermès-bragging wife are utterly disgusting.

1331618554018492421 2020-11-25 23:19:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> It feels so weird, doesn’t it? To not be going anywhere, to not have family coming from somewhere. It’s sad and bittersweet yet feels solid, to just stay put, and hope it helps a doctor or a nurse to carry on.

1331586426983632896 2020-11-25 21:11:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> Since the President Elect is a Democrat. Makes no sense. But does Marco ever? Who even is he, and what does he stand for? Especially hard to know, as the GOP doesn’t even have a party platform. Whatever Trump wants, was their 2020 platform. That’s nuts.

1331286490664591362 2020-11-25 01:20:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> Wut. Seriously?
1331286119368028165 2020-11-25 01:18:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> We need George Lakoff, linguist, or someone talented like him, to message for Democrats. We are saddled with labels, negative, which have been successfully stuck to us by Repubs. We need to get ahold of the linguistics game and MAKE OUR OWN LABELS. Imperative. Urgent. Necessary.
1331275639849160708 2020-11-25 00:37:01 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😭😭😭😭😭
1331275446546272257 2020-11-25 00:36:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> Amen. Omg. Amen. Curled up on the floor. Amen. Like surviving the Titanic, amen. Still burping up seawater, amen. Amen.
1331274632188538883 2020-11-25 00:33:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. But message this. Reclaim the rhetoric from crave gross republicans.
1331271571529474050 2020-11-25 00:20:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> Animals are just amazing. They love us so much and we often don’t deserve it at all.

1331269677750890496 2020-11-25 00:13:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> @BrunoAmato_1 Haven’t had a land line in 15+ years. Like, why? Especially when they raised our monthly charge from $12 to $45 for no appearant  reason. Just forget that.
1331268472324706309 2020-11-25 00:08:32 +0800 <bluedillygal> @peacelovinMimi @travisakers Wut? Totally confused
1331268148415303680 2020-11-25 00:07:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> @shannoncate13 @PauleyTeeks Not necessarily

1331267674949771266 2020-11-25 00:05:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> @shossy2 @MeidasTouch Make Marco go away. Forever. Please. He’s very weird. Dunno what is his point of view. He hated Trump, then sucked up to Trump. Who is this guy? I 100% do not trust him, about anything ever. Curious. What DOES TRUMP HAVE ON HIM? Why would he flip to his knees. Disgusting.
1331266275235024902 2020-11-24 23:59:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> @joncoopertweets Since 2016, bro
1331266136298692619 2020-11-24 23:59:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes.
1331265680000344067 2020-11-24 23:57:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> This is a really good one! Ivanka’s former BFF dishes  https://t.co/X3WsHz3dN9
1331252864837103621 2020-11-24 23:06:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> Never. Never should’ve been. That was our first mistake. And regarding this, it’s like stepping down in to the basement, realizing too late, in the dark there is no stairs.
1331252323860029440 2020-11-24 23:04:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> OMeffingG. How does one fight crazy? They are batshit nutters. Rational arguments do not gain purchase. Slippery like a mud bank, no traction. As I recall, you dig your toes in and sort of claw. Politics has come to this. All must dig in toes, and just claw and scramble.
1331251211127939073 2020-11-24 22:59:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Oh yes my yes
1331251136897183744 2020-11-24 22:59:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> America! 👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 celebrate our vivid, beautiful, most wonderful and amazing diversity. #DiversityIsAmerica
1331250486062837763 2020-11-24 22:57:03 +0800 <bluedillygal> @kilonova_gold @EarlOfEnough I bought it for my mom, for her birthday. ❤️
1331250300674519043 2020-11-24 22:56:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> @auntoona Yes. Exactly. But that’s what the label it. We need to claim the rhetoric and make powerful labels, for ourselves, that describe our vision. We need to take that bone away and make better language.
1331249340673908745 2020-11-24 22:52:30 +0800 <bluedillygal> Have they really done Trump a service, curating the news, protecting his feelings, tip-toeing around sensitive subjects (they don’t really care) but now it’s crashing down like a ton of bricks. Reality. He’s completely unprepared to cope. Coddling people is not the best way to do
1331248063005011969 2020-11-24 22:47:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> @TheTrueAmerica5 @vw_ginna She seems slightly deranged and quite intense. Reminds me of Sarah Palin.
1331246956081975303 2020-11-24 22:43:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> Chef Jose Andres joins Hillary! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  https://t.co/XtzlgxNfZx
1331243180155658246 2020-11-24 22:28:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> @melreynoldsU Tbh, we do need to keep all eyes on his actions for two more months. He’s blocked on my Twitter tho, since 2016.
1331242832376557569 2020-11-24 22:26:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Almost like he’s the virus, we’re the host
1331242559763570692 2020-11-24 22:25:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> @TeaPainUSA @bmargirl So let’s get rid of voting machines. Hand marked paper ballots. Automatic voter registration, with Driver’s license, or 18th birthday.  Universal Vote by Mail. How about we do that?
1331241670080344070 2020-11-24 22:22:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> Not this time! Now we know what they plan for us; it ain’t pretty.
1331241303015895046 2020-11-24 22:20:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> Sad and true. Calcified. Lack ideas. Devalued the concept of competence. What do they offer? All I can see is low taxes for the super rich, and racism. RIP GOP.
1331240438599184384 2020-11-24 22:17:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> @BeschlossDC Maybe “Orchids of Asia Day Spa”space will be available ?
1331082071062827015 2020-11-24 11:47:50 +0800 <bluedillygal> Me too. So grateful ❤️
1331070810539380738 2020-11-24 11:03:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> Are we done? Is the election over? I think so, are we there yet?
1331064476142014464 2020-11-24 10:37:55 +0800 <bluedillygal> Totally 😐
1331064107873792001 2020-11-24 10:36:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> I want that
1331063660240891906 2020-11-24 10:34:41 +0800 <bluedillygal> Is tonight really the night we have a President? I almost can’t feel anymore. Is it real this time?

1331059400610623491 2020-11-24 10:17:45 +0800 <bluedillygal> @TheeWolfthing I thought we were really super mad about cups? Did I get that wrong? I was in a terrible, frothing, apoplectic snit over Christmas cups, but now I can’t remember. Silly me...
1331058424440885251 2020-11-24 10:13:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Scattered211 Cranberry sauce from scratch is so festive and easy. Boil cranberries, add sugar. That’s it! Delicious and fresh. Great on turkey sandwiches. Ice cream. Make a cobbler. Yummy
1331057809023258624 2020-11-24 10:11:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Scattered211 You can bake a frozen turkey breast- freezer to oven, no thaw, if you eat meat. Then you’ll have sandwiches for a week. Bake a potato and a sweet potato. Save half for another meal. Gravy from turkey juice or instant packet. A veg- steamed green beans. Rolls, frozen, bake a few.
1331056328861773824 2020-11-24 10:05:33 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MiaFarrow I blocked him in 2016. That’s just my way. If it’s trash, I don’t engage. I block and seek better contacts who add to my life.
1331049440300441601 2020-11-24 09:38:10 +0800 <bluedillygal> Are we there yet?
1331048512625254401 2020-11-24 09:34:29 +0800 <bluedillygal> Ferraro wasn’t the Democratic nominee for President who won the popular vote so
1331048048684830723 2020-11-24 09:32:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> I. Think so. She said, tentatively.
1331047259530784770 2020-11-24 09:29:30 +0800 <bluedillygal> Nominated. Not elected.

1331046668846968833 2020-11-24 09:27:10 +0800 <bluedillygal> @bolden46 @Spatula8 Yes. I see. Sarah Palin was totally unqualified and besides batshit crazy
1331033238605688832 2020-11-24 08:33:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> I just want to say I LOVE YOU HILLARY. You broke that glass ceiling for Kamala. YOU DID THAT. Respect. Love. Blessings. We don’t /didn’t deserve you, but you persisted; here we are. Four horrible years going backward, under duress- and now - Kamala is Vice President. You did this
1331031857509634049 2020-11-24 08:28:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> Perfection

1331029143375450112 2020-11-24 08:17:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> Please no. Can’t we stop with the pivot crap
1331028478418935808 2020-11-24 08:14:53 +0800 <bluedillygal> And you would know, my dear. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love
1331026523655196680 2020-11-24 08:07:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> I grew up knowing it was character, not wealth, power, or any trappings. Everybody was equal by their deeds.
1331025732940795905 2020-11-24 08:03:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Yamiche @RexChapman What? Oh my god what

1331024059421831171 2020-11-24 07:57:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> I saved this photo from quite some time ago because I thought it was so interesting. Trump, in the foreground , is the prominent image, but a blur, a blob. The Blob. Jarvanka appear to regard him, yet focus inward. I  title this image “Consciousness of Guilt”  https://t.co/w1RkDPwpKO
1331022096223383553 2020-11-24 07:49:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> We’re in chess now- not checkers, eat the pieces.

1331021208217858048 2020-11-24 07:45:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> The Trump’s whole thing is how can the people serve them, who can serve them. They think they are damn royalty. Everyone else is just a pawn, to be played. It’s sick. UnAmerican and perverted.
1331020115513647107 2020-11-24 07:41:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Maybe she meant to say Release the Karen?
1331019916749762568 2020-11-24 07:40:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> Retract the Kraken!

1330938569255510023 2020-11-24 02:17:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Sigmundine2 My daughter is only 24. She’s very VERY opinionated. I love her for that. Aaaand I’m tearing my hair trying to talk to her. Right now, she thinks communism is something America will embrace. I’m like no. Shoot me and throw me in a hole. No. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
1330936594828673025 2020-11-24 02:09:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Sigmundine2 I’m all in! All in.
1330936238552047617 2020-11-24 02:08:21 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Sigmundine2 My lefty daughter is sounding just like Trumpers about now, in her extremism. I’m trying not to argue too much, hoping it will pass. I remember(with great embarrassment and shame ) arguing with my grandmother about tofu, and why she shouldn’t serve meat. I am humiliated by myself
1330935461917962242 2020-11-24 02:05:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> Ok. Me too

1330578613343838210 2020-11-23 02:27:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Yes they do. Ethical people intrinsically recognize right from wrong. They are not coerced by fear, demons, or bogeymen. They, in their very gut, know that cruelty is evil. And that every living creature craves love. This is reality.
1330572110628933633 2020-11-23 02:01:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes 😳

To not be rude, because you could hurt someone. Isn’t this the point? Empathy, embodied. Didn’t everyone learn this way?

1330307374020767746 2020-11-22 08:29:28 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is beyond furious he can’t just stamp his foot and have somebody whisk away the problem. He’s never dealt with this before.
1330291425301422081 2020-11-22 07:26:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> AGREE. It’s some kind of pheromone-type thing they have with Trump. It’s weird and freaky- can you imagine them substituting him for Pence?

Nobody embodies election fraud on a national scale more than Louis DeJoy. Louis DeJoy should serve time in a federal prison. He has attacked our democracy.

1329482431502700544 2020-11-20 01:51:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> Ron Steslow and The Lincoln Project are fascinating. I love them, but I still haven’t figured them out, exactly. But omg, they have manned up against Trump and all his toxic waste. Who are they? I dunno. Totally worth a listen 🧐  https://t.co/ZuooDm1T6U

Her, I just pick up gently and set her down firmly, while saying “No. Bad” in a very disappointed voice. One cat used to do it more.

1328794422377590785 2020-11-18 04:17:32 +0800 <bluedillygal> We won’t have evidence until someone who knows steps up. I think the unaddressed problem of US military being told to ignore abuse of afghan boys + Lindsey’s extraordinary record of visiting Afghanistan deserves scrutiny.

1328757868359802887 2020-11-18 01:52:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> #WeDontDeserveDogs we just don’t. Dogs are way better than us. Maybe they can’t build a bridge, ok. But by every moral judgment, trust, love, loyalty- Dogs score way higher than humans. Dogs&gt;humans

1328756574698033155 2020-11-18 01:47:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> I think Lindsey Graham was procured boys in Afghanistan who were subsequently disappeared. That’s what I think. Please prove me wrong.

1328751551012335616 2020-11-18 01:27:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> The Lindsey Graham stuff is linked to Afghanistan. This is the thread. Pull it, you journalists.
1328750153906483200 2020-11-18 01:21:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m going to say this: I think Lindsey Graham’s “problem” potentially compromises US command in Afghanistan. That is what I think it is about. I would love to be proven wrong 😭😭😭😭😭💔
1328748479884238848 2020-11-18 01:14:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> Who will release the info on Graham. Why are they holding back? Theories, anyone? I assume multiple actors have the dope.

1328741561375526912 2020-11-18 00:47:29 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump has made this worse. Every lever he pulled has made this worse. Trump has encouraged and enflamed a plague upon the American people. He is a rat. Trump is a plague bearing rat. Trump approves plague on America. Who is Putin’s puppet? Trump.

1328706691798589442 2020-11-17 22:28:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. I totally miss Al Franken. That whole thing was a Roger Stone op.
1328706267582492673 2020-11-17 22:27:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> When I think we could/should have had Hillary Fucking Leslie Knope in charge of the virus. I want to rend my clothes. I howl. Curl down and fucking howl.

You, ChefJose, are love and strength and purpose. I have wondered often how differently things would have been these awful four years, if you had somehow been our accidental President. Peace and love, Godspeed.

1328437566400585731 2020-11-17 04:39:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> Emily Murphy. Kim Davis. Same. Didn’t turn out that well for Kim...
1328437285927448577 2020-11-17 04:38:24 +0800 <bluedillygal> Emily Murphy.
1328436791469281281 2020-11-17 04:36:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. 😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔
1328435542963449858 2020-11-17 04:31:29 +0800 <bluedillygal> WILL KILL PEOPLE. Your family, who will be killed. It’s your family who will die.
1328435137663660032 2020-11-17 04:29:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> Loeffler is an unapologetic rich person she believes she should take advantage of classified information to make a profit for: WHO? For HERSELF, that’s who. Not like she was poor before SHE WANTED MORE. And more is NEVER ENOUGH she’s insatiable 😳😳😳
1328433996137631746 2020-11-17 04:25:20 +0800 <bluedillygal> @sadmonsters Amen! It’s been fucking weird.

1328433183902343169 2020-11-17 04:22:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> #KimDavisEmilyMurphy equally disgusting, equally legally liable.
1328432325064056832 2020-11-17 04:18:42 +0800 <bluedillygal> But she’s not a 10. Goin nowhere. Can’t believe he’s keepin Melania-long-in-the-tooth past now. Honestly. How does a playboy have a 50 year old wife. Is that a thing? Wasn’t Tony Curtis like a hundred married to a twenty-something? Gotta up your game trumpy.

1328128253748502528 2020-11-16 08:10:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> It is journalistic malpractice to amplify this insanity. If a bunch of people say they can fly are they just going to report that without question? Then kids start jumping out windows, all good? Why don’t they find the sane people, interview them?
1328124438924111872 2020-11-16 07:55:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> Virtually hugging you!  https://t.co/XQd6hm34SD

1328102465074573316 2020-11-16 06:27:57 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump promised Covid would be gone by Nov 4. Because the word “Covid” was just a Dem hoax being spoken to depress his vote. Is that true, America? Was he telling the truth, America?
1328101634078076929 2020-11-16 06:24:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Kim Davis Emily Murphy. Government employees not doing their job. Bye Emily, you’re the new Kim. It didn’t end well for her either.
1328099015364382722 2020-11-16 06:14:14 +0800 <bluedillygal> Florida is entrenched corruption. Not sure how, if, when it will be dislodged. It’s ALWAYS been pirates. And scammers. Always.
1328092950656659457 2020-11-16 05:50:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Yes I did reference that. I was on Twitter that night watching in horror. Reading texts from people who were there. I will never forget his awful attitude. What a bad terrible human.
1328046349720412162 2020-11-16 02:44:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. 😳

1328023255664504835 2020-11-16 01:13:12 +0800 <bluedillygal> Princess Ivanka and Prince Jared’s children had to withdraw from school because rules. Rules they flout, rules about safety designed to prevent communicable death. They dgaf. About rules, for little people. About anyone else, at all #ArrogantJavanka
1328022134304731136 2020-11-16 01:08:44 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Gerhard_kreuz Didn’t work out so good for Kim Davis, a similarly obstructionist government employee who refused to do her job. Emily Murphy’s obstructionist behavior has dire consequences for a nation besieged by plague. She is a horrible criminal person with no conscience and “0” common sense
1328021197787979776 2020-11-16 01:05:01 +0800 <bluedillygal> It’s crazy! The only response is 😂/😭 which is a weird state of mind to occupy, but here we are.
1328020399087620096 2020-11-16 01:01:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> But no. Q-tip is odious. A toady. He still completely sucks up, and it’s mystifying. Why? Is it love? Is it fear? Is there any other explanation? Unfathomable.

1328001620622323713 2020-11-15 23:47:14 +0800 <bluedillygal> IKR. Michelle wore a sleeveless dress and the freak out was hysterical.
1328001302161481742 2020-11-15 23:45:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> @JanisCJMSCJ @MaxFaulk1 Heard this is faked. Never mind tho- absolutely rings true annyhoo. Which in itself, is terrifying.
1328000092666736640 2020-11-15 23:41:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Sigmundine2 @chrislongview So you pass on the lap-dance by Kimberly
1327999760654082049 2020-11-15 23:39:50 +0800 <bluedillygal> Please support our good Dem Georgia candidates for Senate #DeThroneMitch it’s crucial. The self described “Grim Reaper” is literally that. Mitch = death for Americans.
1327998958828986368 2020-11-15 23:36:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes🎯. Correct. Since Reagan. Drown it in the bathtub, our government, he smiled. My heart was truly broken in 1980. I saw it then for what it was.
1327998114108727297 2020-11-15 23:33:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> 🤣/😭. It’s a roller coaster ride of death.
1327997834906529794 2020-11-15 23:32:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> We need much more PSA type videos. What is safest, less, least safe. Especially MOST SAFE! This is Victory Garden level stuff. What the average person can do to stay safe, stay healthy in the midst of a plague. Talented media types, actors, celebrities! Make pieces showing “safe”
1327990613132931072 2020-11-15 23:03:29 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes! Sequel. So lovely, now do “outside’ safely.”
1327976295007997953 2020-11-15 22:06:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> @saletan @DanPatrick He tweeted, then deleted, approval of the Pulse nightclub massacre. Yeah, that guy.
1327783571415851010 2020-11-15 09:20:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> He had some tweet after Pulse about reaping the whirlwind- didn’t he? He deleted, but I’m sure it was a screenshot

1327732196380200963 2020-11-15 05:56:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> Exactly. What humor takes to the edge? We’re already at that edge, in reality. Horrific. Monsters. Greedy little monsters.
1327731685006381056 2020-11-15 05:54:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> But essentially true. I fell for it also. Completely on brand and unsurprising. That’s what we are dealing with. Sometimes they really do say the quiet parts out loud. Sometimes it’s a joke. But it is true, how they are. Horrifying 😳

1327728992884027400 2020-11-15 05:43:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> Q-tip blathers on about Trump’s “second term.” So he’s utterly stupid, prostrated loyal, or scared to contradict Dear Leader. None of these make for a particularly good look.

Soak for 4-5 days. Rust will sluff off with a brush and hose. I’m amazed. Rescued a bunch of old hand tools. Wow!

1327003056278548480 2020-11-13 05:39:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> Heartbreaking😭💔💔💔
1327002754418610177 2020-11-13 05:38:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MissFuhrerious True. But she has political symbolism at this point. Like if she packed her jewels and filed tomorrow- that’d be yuge.
1327001994129764363 2020-11-13 05:35:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> As a person who does not believe in god, but is a deep lover of Jesus, who thinks of his moral guidance in many situations- in my opinion most who claim Jesus would fall short in his estimation. I’m just wondering does this ever give them pause.
1327001022712176641 2020-11-13 05:31:12 +0800 <bluedillygal> @PalermoGerard Not sure. Shakespeare was transcendent. And a genius. But for humor, I think I’d compare him to George Carlin. I will really think on this- is ANYONE this smart or funny? ❤️
1327000218571853824 2020-11-13 05:28:01 +0800 <bluedillygal> Probably true. So gross and who will tell us. And for how much money? I figure everybody in there will either try to sell a book, or explain the gap in their resume b/c childbirth, or rehab, or to Ananda in the Himalayas
1326998856995844099 2020-11-13 05:22:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> The Bible is an amazing document. As is all of Shakespeare, and other cultural stuff.
1326998377251418118 2020-11-13 05:20:42 +0800 <bluedillygal> Supposed Christians do not seem to understand Jesus. I am a not-god believer who has studied the Bible extensively, and owns a Strong’s Concordance, so I can check Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek. It’s awesome. Who these people say they are, Jesus wld not acknowledge. Just saying
1326994259669553155 2020-11-13 05:04:20 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MissFuhrerious Surely she hates him too, from what I’ve heard. She just needs to cement her finances. Of course, yes. She is apparently also a terrible person.
1326993791337816065 2020-11-13 05:02:28 +0800 <bluedillygal> Who are even you. I am very not hip. I’ve been on Twitter a long fucking time. Maybe I’ll fix it. I didn’t know it wasn’t cool when I made my account, Mr. Oilfield YOU R BLOCKED
1326992587450949632 2020-11-13 04:57:41 +0800 <bluedillygal> Wow.  Wonder what metaphorical weirdness will Melania imprint on the nation now? (Oh. Maybe she’s happy almost rid of the grumpy gross old man. Could be a BURST OF JOY?) we’ve had murder trees and scary winter movie. She is very mean, but can she also feel joy at being rid of DJT  https://t.co/B8YmXoYxEN
1326991129301094404 2020-11-13 04:51:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> Anybody else feel like the rapist was caught, but he got loose, and he’s still at large? Psychologically it feels like this now. Am I the only one?

1325814230042497025 2020-11-09 22:55:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> Or Reality TV- whatever the fuck is that morass. A visitor had Toddlers and Tiaras on their laptop. It was like watching a snake swallow a bunny. I watched it for 20 minutes and that is the sum total of my Reality TV experience. I felt like vomiting. WTHF is wrong with people?
1325808639949623297 2020-11-09 22:33:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> Pig. Trump is selfish gross pig. Never been anything but. Apologies to pigs. Pigs are smart and awesome. Sorry. It’s a human cultural metaphor. Not even sure why. Sorry to pigs 👏💔😭
1325807794348564486 2020-11-09 22:29:45 +0800 <bluedillygal> OH MY LAWD YES YES YES YES. From every belfry and hilltop, she summed it up. Yes 100% this Yaas!
1325806225913688070 2020-11-09 22:23:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> Agree. Everyone deserves joy.! Without joy we are husks of humans. The more we FEEL joy, the more we spread joy. The opposite is also true. And THAT is human society in a nutshell. A society which nurtures joy for the MOST people to experience? THAT is a successful society. ❤️😘

1325787327151697920 2020-11-09 21:08:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> Maggie Haberman has been a “kneeling” (gross-Eeeeew) shill for this disgusting and incompetent rapist/racist. Wow! With Trump you get BOTH racist and rapist. HOW GOOD DOES THAT FEEL my skin is peeling off so incredibly gross
1325786141661028353 2020-11-09 21:03:42 +0800 <bluedillygal> I don’t trust electronic election thingies. No way no how. #HandMarkedPaperBallots nation wide.

1325784938172518400 2020-11-09 20:58:55 +0800 <bluedillygal> Blocked Haberman long ago. Disturbing shill. Family works PR for Kushner. She has been a disgusting kiss ass. Not reporter. She is grotesque.
1325770145789321221 2020-11-09 20:00:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump just wants to hawk his Outrage Elixir so he can get more money. Snake oil.

1325767536873517056 2020-11-09 19:49:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> I wish everyone would read Mary L Trump’s book. Thank you, shero.

1325766009463169024 2020-11-09 19:43:42 +0800 <bluedillygal> Just like the a la carte Bible. Some things are Law. Other things, nah, forget.

1325764831291518982 2020-11-09 19:39:01 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MikeFromUSA1 @Perpetual_Now @GlennKesslerWP The loss of Lincoln in that crucial time, and his replacement by Johnson is one of the tragedies of history. So very sad.

1325564793164607489 2020-11-09 06:24:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> Turncoat douchebag he was- he’s still alive? #LiebermanWho
1325564234936115200 2020-11-09 06:21:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> And for fucking what? To gift some 1%ers. Some already-billionaires. Who would do that? Why would anybody ever do that? DISGUSTING. He is beneath, under, below, subterranean level under, contempt.
1325563418431135745 2020-11-09 06:18:41 +0800 <bluedillygal> A robust health care system, nationwide, which treats mental health as equal to a heart attack or a prostate exam. The same. An equal part of health. Then, plus education, unshackled, we will begin to see daylight. It is an illness, manifesting as hostility and aggression.
1325562278452875272 2020-11-09 06:14:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> Those else who know what’s the deal with Lindsey are also criminally liable for covering it up. That’s why crickets. There are people who know.
1325557891567394817 2020-11-09 05:56:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> Oh my I’m crying
1325557358009995264 2020-11-09 05:54:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> Shamed our country and denigrated our soldiers. Spit on our allies and pumped up dictators

1325512742145564672 2020-11-09 02:57:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> Oh yeah 👏👏👏😭❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸
1325509759760543744 2020-11-09 02:45:28 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Yes one does. What I , a layman, has surmised makes me feel very ill.
1325508458590908416 2020-11-09 02:40:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> Exactly 😭😭😭😭😭
1325508151576305664 2020-11-09 02:39:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> “F#*% Chreesmas” I believe she said?
1325507910827388929 2020-11-09 02:38:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> I know. If ever we see it. God! It’s heartbreaking
1325507714559188999 2020-11-09 02:37:20 +0800 <bluedillygal> Sickening. Very bad.
1325507582086295555 2020-11-09 02:36:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> Looked up whoever the fuck she is and blocked her ass.
1325506912666996739 2020-11-09 02:34:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😭😭😭❤️ Brother. Makes me so sad.
1325506737407930369 2020-11-09 02:33:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> Makes me literally sick in my stomach. My skin feels like it’s crawling off me when I think about it.
1325506071524503552 2020-11-09 02:30:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> So it’s literally a smorgasbord there. Connect the dots.
1325505852044955651 2020-11-09 02:29:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> @PalermoGerard No. Not at all explicitly. Connect the dots. Who could be procured for an important person in that environment? Somebody who just “popped in” + 30 times. Somebody who said Trump was a kook, then suddenly said he’s the bee’s knees. I feel ill.
1325504991835136003 2020-11-09 02:26:31 +0800 <bluedillygal> Furthermore- I think why it hasn’t leaked is that some very prominent people have knowingly covered it up. That is the logjam. It is bad. 😭😭😭 sickening.
1325502439022358531 2020-11-09 02:16:22 +0800 <bluedillygal>  https://t.co/fYCVoIIUAl this never leaves my mind. Lindsey went to Afghanistan more than 34 times. I think it’s the key. I hope to god somebody comes forward. 😭😭😭
1325501658961424385 2020-11-09 02:13:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> I think it is very very bad. Rumors only. So far. 😭
1325500289911300097 2020-11-09 02:07:50 +0800 <bluedillygal> Nobody’s leaked what it is about Lindsey. I think because it is that terrifying. So bad, it’s bad.
1325499271769157633 2020-11-09 02:03:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> Mnunchin is quite corrupt, just sayin. Drink
1325498804523634690 2020-11-09 02:01:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Sick, probably
1325497983962640388 2020-11-09 01:58:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> Not at all! Young are the most vulnerable to propaganda. We, as a society, and members of a society, more and more, and more must model the values of love-tolerance-inclusion. And more, more strongly those who hate must be stripped of public platforms:Shun racists. It must wither
1325496880596389888 2020-11-09 01:54:17 +0800 <bluedillygal> No. They must be shunned! I don’t say “play nice” FUCK THAT. But structurally, societally, we must step forward with a plan to re-direct hate, re-educate hate, diffuse, dilute, abandon- and yes, SHUN purveyors of hate, where necessary. If not, humans as a species die. Period 😭💔
1325495945505742850 2020-11-09 01:50:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> Because it is being refreshed with no factual interventions. People are altruists by nature. We can’t help but catch that baby falling from the window. IT IS GUT. Grounded. Real. That saving person, it’s all of us. We must reconnect that humanity.
1325495202895843329 2020-11-09 01:47:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> #Education #Civics We take the Texas whateverthefuck stranglehold off textbooks in this country. If #History is taught, people will not grow up racist. Even rats have altruism.
1325494506284867585 2020-11-09 01:44:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😭😭😭😭😭😭👏❤️🇺🇸 SO MANY TEARS. Water that damn Rose Garden again. We deserve a fucking garden.
1325493986308595714 2020-11-09 01:42:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> Thing is. Brute force does not work. I remember in Little Women, or wherever- Rose in Bloom, maybe: you draw more flies with honey than vinegar. True! Find ways to praise. Anything. Praise people up to where they need to be. #Positivity only way forward ❤️
1325492968820764673 2020-11-09 01:38:44 +0800 <bluedillygal> But maybe. Maybe we can be seductive too? I’m sorry. Whatever our messaging has been since they put abortion and immigration between their slavering jowls- has not worked! Democrats = For the People, Republicans = elite donors with a personal agendaHOW DOES EVERYONE NOT KNOW THIS
1325491972530966533 2020-11-09 01:34:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> Bwahahahaha I’m so tired

1325490194510974976 2020-11-09 01:27:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes, pinned Tweet-sage. And when, if ever, do we know? When do people know what FVEY know? Ever? Ever? Ever? The American People are a woman in a fainting couch pre-19th Ammendment. WHAT THE HELL Spill! Spill what you clocked on McConnell and Graham. At least do us that solid 🙏
1325488533432315904 2020-11-09 01:21:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yup 😳
1325488314179317765 2020-11-09 01:20:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> @theradicalsage Thank you. I bow to you, arbiter. However. I am one who has lauded the death of the adverb. My mother wishes to wrestle me, spits when my name is mentioned. (Not really, 🤣🤣🤣But sorta!) having beenon Twitter since140 char, my rhetorical style changed. Adverbs became pantywaists
1325484872098603010 2020-11-09 01:06:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> Republican felons sold the voting software adopted largely, did I get that wrong?
1325484659745181697 2020-11-09 01:05:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> Imma throw up now
1325484540031328259 2020-11-09 01:05:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> Believe me I never open it. Haven’t posted in probly 6 years. It’s a tiny thread I keep to maybe contact somebody from the 70s at Antioch College, whom I don’t know is alive or dead. It’s like the Mormon project to baptize the dead, amirite? SO WIERD
1325483534686040065 2020-11-09 01:01:15 +0800 <bluedillygal> Why do these stories lie like bleached bones in an unmapped desert. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL. We must excavate until we find out who/when/why/how this American electronic election fuckery started. AND END IT. If that means writing on a slate with a stylus- ELECTRONIC THEFT ENDS
1325479995792363521 2020-11-09 00:47:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> So she can get busy with her “F*#% Chreesmas” holiday display  https://t.co/387IkJYQi9
1325479421395013632 2020-11-09 00:44:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> Seriously. Rove, I believe, hacked Ohio for Bush in 2004. Waterboard me, I won’t change my story.
1325478290698670083 2020-11-09 00:40:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> Sadly, true. Facebook, where many hang, is creepy. I’m repulsed. I still have an account, so I can open things family/friends post, but I look, and then GTFO- very weird vibe: sister posted a time-lapse vid of a man and his kids putting up a kit cabin. Such hateful comments! Why?
1325470497899900930 2020-11-09 00:09:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m sure others do as well. At some point we will learn what.
1325469877780492296 2020-11-09 00:06:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> 😳😳😳

Just a settled peace. Mausoleums, in their grandeur, resemble civic buildings- it really seems a city, yet so calm. So un-fraught. It is a peaceful respite to visit such places

1325159103396720640 2020-11-08 03:32:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> Rubio is totally compromised. Now he kow-tows to Trump. We must know what the Trump people are hanging over him. ( I don’t think it is anything very good. In fact, I think it’s bad. Possibly very bad for Marco) why else would he act as he has- pumping up Trump? No sane person wld
1325157549050630149 2020-11-08 03:25:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> Rubio is severely compromised by SOMETHING. It behooves us to discover the exact details of why and what and who. No way anyone one supposedly “religious “ sucks up to Trump for no reason. #RubioWhatsTrumpGotOnU

1323048662159732738 2020-11-02 07:45:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> @CandiceAiston Where are their masks
1323002392992980999 2020-11-02 04:42:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> Black Americans, many, descendants of people once enslaved do not spend their days wishing to turn the tables and enslave white people. They want to be respected with dignity, allowed the full rights of American citizens. They wish to be protected and served by law enforcement.
1322995360017600514 2020-11-02 04:14:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> Even people long oppressed do not contain the nasty hatred they embody. Think on that. Why are these people consumed with hate? It is horrific.
1322994737352118273 2020-11-02 04:11:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> This is not acceptable. These people are highway criminals. Can you imagine? Could have caused a pileup, killing motorists. OMeffingG
1322994142822174720 2020-11-02 04:09:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> Or take it to the Election Supervisor’s office. Mine had a slot in the office marked “Ballots”  - the masked worker behind her plexiglass waved me to it. Very quick. Very clean.  https://t.co/7BQVteSdlR

1322952573708587013 2020-11-02 01:24:07 +0800 <bluedillygal> @HalSparks So bizarre. Q is high on its own supply, obviously.
1322951955589828609 2020-11-02 01:21:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> @EarlOfEnough Just imagine they are Islamic. Apply that frame. These people are terrorists. Does not have to be foreign, or another religion which you are not, to qualify. Anyone who uses violence to promote their politics = terrorist. Even if it’s your youth pastor. Think!
1322950578184572932 2020-11-02 01:16:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> If you can grow tulips I think you can grow German bearded iris? My grandmother and aunt were obsessed with them. Omg. As a kid I met a fairy! Each 3ft tall stalk had a person on top who smelled incredible. Had a huge face with weirdly luminescent trembling colors in the daytime

1322929851922288640 2020-11-01 23:53:50 +0800 <bluedillygal> Shun them. In every way. Racists cannot be tolerated in any venue.

1321570542076502019 2020-10-29 05:52:25 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is Roy Cohn’s little acolyte. Even though (duh. Cohn died of AIDS) Trumpie turned on him at the end- it’s where he learnt his deplorable chops.

1321534035139694597 2020-10-29 03:27:21 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m so sick of feeling there is very bad information about Trump, and his various enablers that somebody is holding out on us.
1321533517122179079 2020-10-29 03:25:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> Why do I feel like somebody- more than one somebody-  has the dirt on Lindsey and it’s really bad. What is the purpose to hold this out?
1321530753688195076 2020-10-29 03:14:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> Why? Why did he abruptly kowtow to Trump

1321508816354238472 2020-10-29 01:47:08 +0800 <bluedillygal> Trump is the culmination of white grievance. This is his platform, this is what the entire Republican Party ceded to as THEIR “platform” Which they did not even declare anything, 2020. “0” is their platform. Racism IS the Republican platform. #Disgust #DustAndAshes
1321507297051480065 2020-10-29 01:41:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> “the saturated world”  by beverly gordon is such an interesting take on 19th century American women. I love this book and can totally relate. It is pithy to think how the abused sex has made a parallel universe which totally excludes, and goes under the radar of their overlords.

1321457606288986112 2020-10-28 22:23:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes. Cutting down trees and slashing brush. Trying to repair from Hurricane Michael, going on two years. It is fitting and cathartic somehow. Every slash and heap, every claw and fall downhill into the brambles is emblematic of what we face. Every climb back up.
1321456337172242433 2020-10-28 22:18:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> Another demagogue will likely rise to take his shoes. Cause that’s where we are, evidently.

1320880908593991681 2020-10-27 08:12:04 +0800 <bluedillygal> I know. Don’t mean to be so glib. I’m fired up. Anywhere I could punish a practitioner of anything for blabbing Trump nonsense I would, and have. But. I had a mechanic for twenty years who was ace 100% on the level and so good. I overlooked his politics and delighted in his skill
1320879712684703751 2020-10-27 08:07:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> @PalermoGerard Yes. It’s a mood! 🤣So many inspirations! I can’t stop. Sorry if I’ve over saturated the word. You know- those days
1320877615973126144 2020-10-27 07:58:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> New Doctor. I would not pay for that demented crap. Seriously
1320877311416246272 2020-10-27 07:57:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> I think about it often🤣🤣🤣
1320877048827707397 2020-10-27 07:56:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> @tsjwaffle @ViViVoo13 @ThePlumLineGS I think underneath his brittle shell he’s insecure. But his daily coping mechanism is to believe his own lies. Both things are true. If he didn’t pump up his own lies, he could not function. The root is abject terror. He’s a mess. Mary Trump’s book is very good.
1320875915677749249 2020-10-27 07:52:13 +0800 <bluedillygal> @JamesKosur @FreshPhunky He lies when he opens his mouth
1320875750174658560 2020-10-27 07:51:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> Rethuglicans have made Donnie the Rug and Rat Boy Slim their role models. Let that sink in.

1320859668852494346 2020-10-27 06:47:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> Who does Amy Conan Barbarian remind you of? Is it perhaps Crazy Eyes Bachmann? Same weird glazed over expression. These people are amped up on some weird cult shit. I find religious zealots abhorrent- no matter the stripe. ISIS/AmericanEvangelicals - not a dime’s worth of diff.😳
1320858173096501249 2020-10-27 06:41:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> Originalism is 100% bizarre and manipulable. Amy Conan Barbarian would NEVER BE ELIGIBLE TO even cast her VOTE in 17whateverthefuck

1320835775974514689 2020-10-27 05:12:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> Embarrassing, fremdschamen, you know. Cringeworthy , she is 😂
1320835411275558914 2020-10-27 05:11:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> So revanchist?
1320835044949270530 2020-10-27 05:09:49 +0800 <bluedillygal> Thomas is gutter trash. He was a “conservative “ token to stick it to the Libs. He is disgusting and beneath contempt. A LIAR #IBelieveAnitaHill Thomas is a fucking liar.
1320834403359227909 2020-10-27 05:07:16 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MMineiro_CNS @nielslesniewski @PamelaBrownCNN Oh. That’s fitting.

1320832952339730434 2020-10-27 05:01:30 +0800 <bluedillygal> I think what gives me heartburn is how could this horrible man even stand a chance- with even 10%! of the vote. HOW. How could any enfranchised American vote for a traitor, propped up by money from god knows who, to whom he now owes god knows what amounts. Who has LET PEOPLE DIE?

I literally think of them both now by their mob names. 🤣🤣🤣 I’ll credit you, always if you claim it. It’s not mine. But THAT’S THE NAMES. Forever, for all time 🙏Namaste
1320815684641804293 2020-10-27 03:52:53 +0800 <bluedillygal> Thomas is a (fucking scuse me) liar. Always has been is now. He’s a lie built on a lie. I despise that guy
1320815362036948993 2020-10-27 03:51:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> Never worked for a freakin thing ever in any sphere of life. Physical material mental emotional. All pretended for him, spun for him, doctored for him, greased for him. It’s like the Menendez brothers presidency. Affluenza strikes again.

1320808313534242816 2020-10-27 03:23:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> @atrupar Wow! I can’t believe trumpie even acknowledges this! Yes. BHO admittedly looks like a GQ model. And really- that is the severe root of Trump’s jealousy. So sad. Obama is much, much more than a pretty face: he’s competent, caring, kind. Of course none of THAT even registers w/DJT
1320807179247624197 2020-10-27 03:19:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> I wish Dad was still alive. I could swear he supported Goldwater at one point, then decided Barry was crazy. Was BG anti-rightwingchurch? That would’ve drawn Dad in. Then BG turned out to be also racist? That would’ve made my dad livid. Was GW the Ron Paul of his day?

1320439228677955586 2020-10-26 02:56:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> I think the Lincoln Project is looking forward? Maybe build something new from the ashes. I’m really not sure what that means. 😳. .. But right now ... they are vehemently anti-Trump, as am I. He simply must be vanquished, we all move forward from there.
1320438393625550849 2020-10-26 02:53:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> True. I do not think it’s necessarily bad to have an opposing party. I will always be a proud Dem as long as we are the party of civil rights, human rights and anti-bigotry. The haha Republican Party now is the Cult of Trump - burn it down.
1320436576812498945 2020-10-26 02:46:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> @auntbec15 I know. I am a trusting person. That’s probably a serious flaw 💔😭
1320436122644815872 2020-10-26 02:44:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> True. I don’t follow him on Twitter and am wary. He seems very shady. Lincoln Project podcast has not featured him to my knowledge, nor mentioned his name. Everyone I’ve heard speak’s surprisingly rational, anti-Trump and passionate about democracy as a life path. Conway’s creepy

1320399707106136065 2020-10-26 00:19:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Bye Lindsey.
1320399448829198336 2020-10-26 00:18:55 +0800 <bluedillygal> No fucking way. These guys are 100% incompetent and FAILING America.

1320394768724185089 2020-10-26 00:00:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> If the Lincoln Project is the new Republican Party then kudos, they will be a worthy adversary. And from what I have seen bigot-free. This coming from a yellow dog Dem.

1320392703427870723 2020-10-25 23:52:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’ve heard some carping about the Lincoln Project- they are just a Trojan Horse. I’ve literally been brought to tears listening to them on the podcast. I don’t know their “ultimate” plan. Right now they are laser focused on hatred of bigotry, and of Trump.
1320391690587377664 2020-10-25 23:48:05 +0800 <bluedillygal> Isn’t he in an elevator?
1320391218250076160 2020-10-25 23:46:12 +0800 <bluedillygal> What the holy fuck even is this. WHO authorized this seizure of protective equipment for American voters? WHO? WHO? Who does this? Why would ANYBODY do this ever? DO THEY WANT PEOPLE TO DIE? Do they? Do they?
1320390324070514689 2020-10-25 23:42:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> And the dental records do not match. Will never. Just look!
1320378811188432898 2020-10-25 22:56:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> He’s that jacked up on himself. This is horrifying
1320378691474640897 2020-10-25 22:56:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> Wannabe dictator. Wake the fuck up. This guy’s ego knows no bounds. He really thinks HE can wipe out our proud history of sovereignty by the people- basically the whole of our USA- and turn it into some shady Trump branded fiefdom.

1320373721434099714 2020-10-25 22:36:41 +0800 <bluedillygal> @RexChapman Green needle is enunciated much more clearly. Brain storm is a mush, the last part of the word falls off. I hear both. Does green or red matter? Which does the eye seek first. I speed read so- plus, we read left to right, so what does this measure? But, cool, love shit like this

1320203762749886464 2020-10-25 11:21:19 +0800 <bluedillygal> @Olivia_Emisar This pic. Everything’s off. Chin smile bone structure. This one’s a slap in the face, frankly. My question- how many do they have? How many Melania actors are there?
1320203074078650369 2020-10-25 11:18:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> Ya know Lincoln Project folks are top-drawer smart. Been around the block a few times  (lookin at you Rick) won’t be bullied. If they need lawyers - they’ve got ‘em some darn lawyers! Rest your little head.
1320201917876834306 2020-10-25 11:14:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> Duh. And more!

1320194463654989824 2020-10-25 10:44:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> Did he attack Erdogan or Duterte tho? Just askin

1320192265730613249 2020-10-25 10:35:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> Whatever is the thing with Lindsey. Be prepared to find out. It WILL come out. Be prepared, I believe, to be shocked beyond your capacity for shock. This is what we face. 😳
1320191332405661696 2020-10-25 10:31:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Do you? Really? I’m going to go vomit if I’ve really hit on it. I’m actually shaking 😭

1320189020933132288 2020-10-25 10:22:45 +0800 <bluedillygal> Broken heart. Lindsey Graham or any official would not demand the abuse be stopped. 😭😭😭
1320188477028372480 2020-10-25 10:20:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m so pissed when I remember Republican FREAK OUT that Michelle had on a SLEEVELESS DRESS. Melania does porn- they be like OK it’s all good.
1320187573088751616 2020-10-25 10:16:59 +0800 <bluedillygal> Seriously - Lindsey Graham’s kompromat is not that he’s gay. THAT IS NOTHING. Seriously, nothing. This is bizarre, and I believe involves his repeated visits to Afghanistan. There they trade boys like nothing, “0” nothing. I seriously think the stuff about Graham is about THIS😳

In his plus-30 trips to Afghanistan did he get involved with disposable Afghan boys? IS THIS THE THING that made him kneel to Trump? Prove me wrong. PLEASE😱
1320184604519768065 2020-10-25 10:05:12 +0800 <bluedillygal> Lindsey went to Afghanistan like more than 30 times. I’m thinkin the crime is there where “nobody’s” watchin. Except maybe those gathering kompromat.

1319965793304662021 2020-10-24 19:35:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MattBoxer94 Americans have been complacent and disengaged politically. Trump is a rude awakening. For some this will be a life-long change, accepting their civic duty. Some may go back to sleep. Time will tell the percentage of each group.
1319962938799783938 2020-10-24 19:24:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> 👏👏👏 excellent point  https://t.co/r42ddCIR8c
1319962539472683009 2020-10-24 19:22:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> So Graham has noticed that money in politics is “an endless spiral” - a lot of people think so too Lindsey! (This is a long-running problem; it’s not the same problem as what you face currently, which is that people are tired of you)

1319755024692555776 2020-10-24 05:38:12 +0800 <bluedillygal> Anybody notice Trump was a lot cockier, even physically threatening, onstage with Hillary? In his mind he thought he had a built-in advantage because she was a woman. He is up against another man now, and it makes him a lot less cocksure. (Plus he’s freaking out about losing)
1319753178141888513 2020-10-24 05:30:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> I thought the same thing!

1319031878314299398 2020-10-22 05:44:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> Anybody else feel insulted if you find yourself in a store and the cashier is not wearing a mask? Auto Zone, I really needed oil. I didn’t make a scene - but I won’t be back. It’s blatantly rude and disrespectful.

1318519982159003650 2020-10-20 19:50:35 +0800 <bluedillygal> Such a bullshit placating answer we’ve gotten - the diplomats in Cuba with brain damage are “hysterical,” just imagining things. THIS IS AN ATTACK. This is an emergency. WTHF 😱

1318516477616623617 2020-10-20 19:36:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> How can ANYONE not see the obvious. Republicans, as currently constituted, represent ONLY THEIR CORPORATE DONERS. They literally CANNOT (dare not) care about YOU, or anyone, who doesn’t pump money into their election/re-election campaign.
1318515403107217408 2020-10-20 19:32:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> Taking advantage of young girls by old creepy men is a world wide problem. WTHF human society. Why is this tolerated, in one shred, ANYWHERE #GirlsDeserveBetter we are not your trash playthings 😭😭😭💔💔💔

Nobody cares.” From that day on I signed my name just like a Dr. 😳- now somebody wants to “check” it? WTF

We had a (masked!) repair man come, and we all put on masks too, while he was here, out of respect for him. It’s just civilized behavior, could mean life or death.

1317957138040410115 2020-10-19 06:34:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> At least half our our economy must be shut down - how is the stock market doing “well” I don’t understand
1317956470126878720 2020-10-19 06:31:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> Not one person I know has eaten in a restaurant since March. How is the stock market possibly doing “well”
1317952033354358791 2020-10-19 06:13:45 +0800 <bluedillygal> All I see is that clip of him and Epstein. Same dance same guy
1317951810670370816 2020-10-19 06:12:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> THIS PODCAST IS SO GOOD. I love it very much. Just waiting for the next one to drop! Reminds me of Maddow’s Bag Man. Informative, fascinating, entertaining in a weird way.

But when I do, such as now, reading this- tears well up.  I’m crying right now because of what we lost and because this nightmare that’s lasted four years

1317601043853824000 2020-10-18 06:59:03 +0800 <bluedillygal> @FruitKace My daughter is super busy and stressed so she hasn’t really thought of anything yet- but something seems doable. Little kids’ world is so effed right now. It’d be great if the grownups could figure out a way.
1317600476490235904 2020-10-18 06:56:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> @FruitKace I’ve been wondering about that. What is up with Halloween? It is outdoors. If people wear masks and don’t clump together- it seems ok, right? I’d think a spooky porch with little treat bags, spaced apart and arrayed for easy reach? It actually seems like one of the safer funs

1317535303553482752 2020-10-18 02:37:49 +0800 <bluedillygal> Wut? Is Navalny crazy ? ?  ?Why would Navalny imagine,  for even one minute, that Donald is in a position to piss off Putin. Everybody knows that no way in hell is Donald allowed to confront his master. Is this a mistranslation?

1317531521662812160 2020-10-18 02:22:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> This virus is not going away. A year? Two years until we whup it? It’s not something to take lightly
1317531077838360580 2020-10-18 02:21:02 +0800 <bluedillygal> We could be fighting this virus for the next two years.

1317524083844640769 2020-10-18 01:53:14 +0800 <bluedillygal> Leslie Wexner - hapless (innocent) billionaire who (accidentally) gave Jeffrey Epstein the most valuable domestic residence in Manhattan. Les was somehow bamboozled by Jeffrey. He’s a rube from Ohio- poor guy. Is this the real story #WhoIsWexner who, really is Leslie Wexner ? ?
1317522626940706816 2020-10-18 01:47:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> Gaetz , aka Rick Gates, b/c Trump definitely doesn’t have criminal charges with co-conspirators on his mind- - - what’s left of it

1317520541872496646 2020-10-18 01:39:10 +0800 <bluedillygal> @BillKristol The Republican Party. RIP. Y’all let this happen on your watch. Are you thinking what is the new name for a party. Trump has completely ruined whatever that was.

1317505115985764353 2020-10-18 00:37:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> He. Has. No. Job. Trump has some PR thing, completely unrelated to what? President- oh fuck. (Do I have to pretend to do that?) (Hey: can’t you just give me money - cause you know, I’m “President” -after all)
1317504115845496832 2020-10-18 00:33:53 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yes.
1317503884701634561 2020-10-18 00:32:58 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yeah. I’m still heartbroken! Still. Heart-fucking-broken. Fucking sobbing, our country is reduced to this steaming mess, under Jackass Trump. It didn’t have to be this way. 💔😭😭😭😭😭😭💔

1317492264642502657 2020-10-17 23:46:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> Frankly, I have always felt stabbed harder and more rusty-jagged bladedly from the left. People like Chris Hayes, he had no excuse that he was Bubba-stupid. What the hell exactly is his excuse? Hillary had a plan for every contingency. She was everything we need. What the hell?
1317491014307893251 2020-10-17 23:41:50 +0800 <bluedillygal> Bless you , Joe Biden, and Dr. Jill, and your loving family. You are about us each, and our whole country. We love you and thank you.

1317486226539204608 2020-10-17 23:22:48 +0800 <bluedillygal> Chris Hayes can crawl all the way to hell. What a fucking douche bro is he?

1317467813154557952 2020-10-17 22:09:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> We have no way of actually knowing the number of American deaths that are DIRECTLY attributable to the President. This. Is. Horrifying.
1317465942075625473 2020-10-17 22:02:12 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’ve always said he will flee.
1317465081878351872 2020-10-17 21:58:47 +0800 <bluedillygal> @InTheNoosphere Punishment fits the crime amirite
1317464813187063810 2020-10-17 21:57:43 +0800 <bluedillygal> So WHO is exactly Leslie Wexner? This is a consequential question.  Who the fuck IS THIS GUY.
1317464243483136002 2020-10-17 21:55:27 +0800 <bluedillygal> How about how Fukushima water spreads- or no
1317463951932874752 2020-10-17 21:54:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> Oh yeah. Mike Pence is in charge. Just like in Indiana.
1317463034475008000 2020-10-17 21:50:39 +0800 <bluedillygal> “No extradition” search. Just sayin
1317462207823839233 2020-10-17 21:47:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> @xXVashTSXx @mmpadellan Well he could flee to SA. They also treat women like shit. He’d fit right in! Probly put his face on a building
1317461513150582787 2020-10-17 21:44:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> @SachaOnPolicy @ericgarland @JenniferHorn @LincolnsBible @DCDaveSingleton @PreetBharara Thank god. None of my family is down this hole
1317461277762093058 2020-10-17 21:43:40 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yup. Sorry
1317457006672883712 2020-10-17 21:26:42 +0800 <bluedillygal> Look back. I’ve always said “flees”
1317456767253684225 2020-10-17 21:25:45 +0800 <bluedillygal> Sackcloth. Ashes. Rending of garments. Tearing of hair. Keening. (Hair is expensive/ keening embarrassing, so)
1317456114997481472 2020-10-17 21:23:09 +0800 <bluedillygal> “l’etat c’est moi” literally him. He truly believes he is Louis XIV.  Delusional
1317454977703530497 2020-10-17 21:18:38 +0800 <bluedillygal> Because he can. Never, ever, ever, empower a racist self-absorbed narcissist demagogue would-be dictator again. K? CAN WE PLEASE MOVE PAST THIS EMBARRASSING situation? Please? - didn’t we used to have a USA we were working on? A beloved project, before Trump. More perfect union?
1317453478680268800 2020-10-17 21:12:41 +0800 <bluedillygal> Duh
1317449284015607808 2020-10-17 20:56:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> Yup.
1317449127337353216 2020-10-17 20:55:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> Please do.
1317448819831963648 2020-10-17 20:54:10 +0800 <bluedillygal> But Nestor tho?
1317446922328805376 2020-10-17 20:46:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> But at this moment-No. He has been ridiculously and corruptly elevated to the world’s highest position. Though 3rd rate, in actuality, Trump has garnered the role of mafia Don.
1317446058360905729 2020-10-17 20:43:11 +0800 <bluedillygal> Biden specifically addressed generational wealth for black citizens. This is huge. Biden is a mensch. Truly. Joe Biden is a human being with a giant’s heart.
1317445346742751232 2020-10-17 20:40:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> @antartica81 Except THEY WERE DEAR. Donald John Trump could never ever be that. Think about it. It’s impossible.

1317441956910346240 2020-10-17 20:26:54 +0800 <bluedillygal> Donald John Trump punched his son in the face for not wearing a suit. Donald John Trump cares for no one but himself. Except maybe Ivanka. Don’t go there. Trump is crude and gross and, ICYMI, stupid.

1317432761737687040 2020-10-17 19:50:21 +0800 <bluedillygal> 100% agree. It is goo of some sort, mostly high fructose corn syrup, and dyes that probably are not healthful. STICK TO CHOCOLATE.

My heart is fucking broken. The maimed. The stupid. The dumb. The dropped on its head, Not Raised Right- What? WTHF has happened to my country 💔😭
1315312794972164096 2020-10-11 23:26:22 +0800 <bluedillygal> Ethnicity is not race. Religious affiliation is not race. Nothing is race, race is not a thing. “Race” is an exclusionary doctrine based on sight evidence, particularly in the (bizarre) United States- where your with has been judged via lighter/darker SKIN! Absurd. This is absurd
1315311947768889345 2020-10-11 23:23:00 +0800 <bluedillygal> It’s like this: somebody told “whites” that they could be, yes, poor and dumb (and we will MAKE SURE YOU STAY THAT WAY) but, just being “white” you’re better-than “black” (or anything less-than-“white”) A racial construct, yet “bred in the bone”:narrative fiction to placate serfs
1315310749267513347 2020-10-11 23:18:14 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’m mad with my country right now. But more, I’m sad. I’m really sad, and frankly embarrassed that America has produced such dumbasses. I think it goes back to Reconstruction, at least. That’s when this particular race-superiority propaganda strategy went full-political.

1313511226442420233 2020-10-07 00:07:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> His face, while he is clearly wheezing, on that balcony, was a mixture of anger, humiliation, and resolve. He is SO ANGRY he is sick,  and it’s so humiliating to be sick. Resolve is all the glue he has holding his shitshow of a hollow life and (ha!) stolen *Presidency* together.

Not diagnose his pathology, even though as a Dr. of psychology she’s qualified. She simply lays down a narrative of how that family worked. Donald John Trump is a pampered hothouse flower. No one said “No”

1313274118368833536 2020-10-06 08:25:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> He grabbed us, and some people said ok, let him do it, he’s a star. I think he’s getting his comeuppance now in a bizarre and spectacular way. Pride goeth before a fall.

IT IS SO GOOD

Maybe we will really clean our house. 😳💔

We have all seen how the whistleblower system is broken. I’m just sorry that horrible Glen Greenwald was involved. Taints the whole situation. I think she felt desperate to help the country.

I refer you to ❤️Mary Trump’s book  https://t.co/LcPoeFvPme it’s great. Surprisingly calm and soothing- because she is smart, and did not join the mob-crime family
1312510370125238272 2020-10-04 05:50:32 +0800 <bluedillygal> #WhiteTrashIsTheScourge it’s the worst. Beyond disgust. Beneath contempt. It is the worst of this, or any society. Believe me.
1312509423269494785 2020-10-04 05:46:46 +0800 <bluedillygal> I know. Right? It just dawned on me. I wonder if she meant the same to other girls?

1311330194171588609 2020-09-30 23:40:56 +0800 <bluedillygal> Anybody raised with a modicum of morals knows that RACISM IS BAD. It’s bad. It’s immoral, amoral, equated with Satan worship, dictator worship, bad - the lowest of the low. So some Americans didn’t learn this? I’m confused. Anti-racist = American (in theory) it’s our Declaration
1311328087943114755 2020-09-30 23:32:34 +0800 <bluedillygal> How were so many Americans not taught from the cradle that racism is low, immoral, and BAD. I certainly was. And logic supports, and science, and reality- racism is immoral. It is perhaps the earliest thing I remember learning. That &amp; arithmetic. Serious. Earliest moral teaching.
1311319685980393474 2020-09-30 22:59:10 +0800 <bluedillygal> Lindsey is TERRIFIED of something. It is abject, visceral, real.

1311301871139786754 2020-09-30 21:48:23 +0800 <bluedillygal> My friend tried to leave her abusive husband. He told her she’d never know if her brake lines had been cut. That she’d  never be safe anywhere she went.
1311301224818446336 2020-09-30 21:45:49 +0800 <bluedillygal> They should have been ejected. Plus- it’s emblematic of their entire world view: protect me, I don’t give a crap about any of you. Not one shred of crap.
1311300373701853184 2020-09-30 21:42:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> Nikki Haley and Tulsi Gabbard are interchangeable. Molls. They are ridin’ shotgun with the mob. Why? For gods sake why

1311283961088356358 2020-09-30 20:37:13 +0800 <bluedillygal> Great visual! He’d be spitting and snarling, clawing at the plexiglass 🤣

I currently don’t have the attention span to read like I used to. Too jumpy and freaked the fuck out I’m guessing. Podcasts- The Daily Beans and The New Abnormal are musts. Now “Proof”😳

In the framing, in the cultural context, in the stripping down and analyzing the FIREHOSE of news/facts/bullshit we see each day. This is public service (bow.kudos) by Seth #PSA

1310925700879220736 2020-09-29 20:53:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> I’ve been sitting with Mary Trump’s book. A Doctorate in psychology, yet she didn’t diagnose him. She simply describes the family that shaped him. His self is so giantly inflated in his own mind, he really is delusional. It’s all about him. All.

1308811975267438598 2020-09-24 00:54:26 +0800 <bluedillygal> @atrupar @ReaderAdrift Rand Paul switched his Ayn Rand worship to Putin worship somewhere along the way. Interesting to know when, and why. What a super dingleberry douchebag traitor is Rand Fucking Paul.

1308809753653633026 2020-09-24 00:45:36 +0800 <bluedillygal> It’s really too bad Americans are so undereducated. There are many fellow citizens who cannot vet sources, or do not care to try. Intellectual prowess has been stymied- stoppered, plugged-the-fuck-up. Many Americans are dumb as rocks 😳
1308808902520320001 2020-09-24 00:42:13 +0800 <bluedillygal> @ReallyAmerican1 @TeaPainUSA Bain Capital is a huge problem. Romney’s wealth comes from ditching American workers (takers, eaters, dross) scrapping their companies and selling the parts. Romney is a worker-rape capitalist. I don’t care IF HE DOESN’T HAVE KFC GRAVY ON HIS TIE. Romney is a callous user of us.

1308087806904893441 2020-09-22 00:56:50 +0800 <bluedillygal> @djrothkopf Exactly. Nailed it. A cynically used issue to animate a certain segment of their base.

1307611425729372160 2020-09-20 17:23:52 +0800 <bluedillygal> When Scott Walker briefly pulled ahead in Republican Primary, there was a breathy, cooing piece about him on NPR. It seared my brain- I was sitting at a red light beside McDonald’s thinking “WHAT is crap on my radio?” and by Inaug. Day 2017, I was done.
1307600287352467456 2020-09-20 16:39:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> @NPR is like a hostage, and I no longer trust them. I was a 24/7/365 fan for 20 years. When did the degradation really become evident? 2013: cancelling “Talk of the Nation,” 2014: cancelling “Tell Me More,” disbanding their Climate and Energy team. DJT inaug. coverage was AWFUL☹️

1307074936801046529 2020-09-19 05:52:03 +0800 <bluedillygal> So the hacked RNC emails were dismissed as “just old stuff” ... how old? Like maybe about Rove stealing Ohio’s votes, turning them to Bush in 2004? That old?
1307074014892953601 2020-09-19 05:48:24 +0800 <bluedillygal> I keep thinking about that Russia hacked trove of RNC emails.

1303683228574855169 2020-09-09 21:14:37 +0800 <bluedillygal> She is an embarrassment to human kind. Just cringe. Fremdschamen is what I feel.

1303660511511355398 2020-09-09 19:44:21 +0800 <bluedillygal> @fawfulfan @Phil_from_FL It’s smallish though. I’m always relieved if my flight goes through there, rather than ATL which is an insane shit show. 45 min minimum needed to catch your flight

1303657427372564480 2020-09-09 19:32:06 +0800 <bluedillygal> @MattBoxer94 Can we agree that ATL is the craziest and worst?

1301233759652544513 2020-09-03 03:01:18 +0800 <bluedillygal> Seriously. Too funny to him. He slaying us with our own obtuse arrogance
1301232888487251968 2020-09-03 02:57:51 +0800 <bluedillygal> Putin is a sadist, and trump is his best cruel, evil joke. He’s laughing. The rest of the world is (cringing) and laughing. The United States of America is NOT laughing - this joke’s on us.
