1339801220152758274 2020-12-18 13:14:37 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @parlertakes "And the worms ate into his brain."
1339793407187795968 2020-12-18 12:43:35 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @SydneyMarie_13K Ikr? Feels like it's been forever.
1339793108377153536 2020-12-18 12:42:23 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @CBSNews Remember the hard-hitting, in depth investigative reporting on Trump's fundraising in 2016 for an inauguration yet to actually happen?  Yeah, neither do I.
1339791479334682624 2020-12-18 12:35:55 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @SydneyMarie_13K Grateful to my fellow citizens getting out to vote a real President and VP into office, in a time of plague no less.
1339787291246686208 2020-12-18 12:19:16 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @ZoeTillman @Popehat Yes! Release the Kraken Kraken!
1339776497779957763 2020-12-18 11:36:23 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @waltshaub @Popehat Fuck these #fuckers
1339774935280041988 2020-12-18 11:30:11 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Tll631 Pretty sure it's the latter. Trump has always hated us. He hates us just a little bit more now.
1339774526134087680 2020-12-18 11:28:33 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Bedlam_Squatter yup
1339774279941025794 2020-12-18 11:27:34 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @DearBubbie @GeorgePapa19 I'm just a blind squirrel that occasionally trips over an acorn.
1339773902332030976 2020-12-18 11:26:04 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @LBSamuelsson Of course you do. In fact, you matter so much that you'll likely never fully grasp just how much you matter.
1339769710741753857 2020-12-18 11:09:25 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @DearBubbie @GeorgePapa19 No more than yourself. But thank you, that's very kind.
1339767360044056577 2020-12-18 11:00:04 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @GeorgePapa19 That's so weird. I wonder why the FBI would wanna tap the phone calls of a treasonous criminal...
1339766920736849920 2020-12-18 10:58:20 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @MADnysse Yeah, it's kinda "like" that.
1339765973172285441 2020-12-18 10:54:34 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> So @pfizer vaccines not getting out as expected? Remember kids, don't write off to bumbling incompetence that which can be perfectly well explained by the unreservedly depraved malice of our current "administration". They're not as st00pid as they'd like you to believe. #maddow
1339759017523081220 2020-12-18 10:26:55 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Opening the twitmachine, I see Tennesseans trending &amp; think to myself, "Ah, wonderful. The world must've learned of @GovBillLee's wildly successful plan to kill every man, woman, &amp; child in the state".  Way to go, guys! Southern Baptist "Fuck Thy Neighbor" Jesus would b so proud!
1339581870430928897 2020-12-17 22:43:00 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @politvidchannel Nikki Haley also said that Trump was installed by God Himself. So, you know, fuck Nikki Haley.
1339577794980933632 2020-12-17 22:26:49 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @BagdMilkSoWhat This is how I start my day. Truly, it works wonders.
1339567547289624576 2020-12-17 21:46:05 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @stucam7771 Listen, if you're just gonna bring sensible ideas to the table, then I'm afraid you don't really have any future in American politics.
1339562375125602305 2020-12-17 21:25:32 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Ginger_Ass I've known a few humans whose thumbs shoulda been disposable.
1339561962963918848 2020-12-17 21:23:54 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @OmarComing3 Right back atcha.
1339543803456270337 2020-12-17 20:11:44 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JackSam56498119 @therealchelcy Yes, perfectly said. "As far as I knew the war had always and would always exist". Between my dad's love of old war movies &amp; the nightly news, it seemed at the time to be just brute fact, something beyond even questioning. Learn to tie shoes&gt;learn to read&gt;maybe a date&gt;then war
1339519911794716674 2020-12-17 18:36:48 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @RTranter5 @therealchelcy Words are never sufficient for such things, but I'm sorry for the loss of your bother. These are the only lasting achievements of war, sorrow and inadequate words.
1339512658329022464 2020-12-17 18:07:59 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @SenBlumenthal @SteadyasweDodo Well this reads with an revealing familiarity.
1339511329862922240 2020-12-17 18:02:42 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @StephenAtHome I'm tellin ya now, they ain't gonna have it.
1339504752355381249 2020-12-17 17:36:34 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @therealchelcy Then, when they're older &amp; more mature, they can learn that you (w/all good intentions) sort of lied; that war is indeed pretty much our default. ;-) But spare 'em the scars in their early years. 2/2
1339504244269998080 2020-12-17 17:34:33 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @therealchelcy I think it's important for parents of young children who see such harshness on the news to explain that war isn't the default position of humans; that it's not part of life to grow up to go to war. Children can internalize such dreadful thoughts &amp; never give u a clue. 1/2
1339502369206317056 2020-12-17 17:27:06 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @therealchelcy @JWANOTEDSKEPTIC I think the Challenger had all the elements of a Greek tragedy (heroic 1st teacher in space, chosen literally against the odds), Little Jessica all the elements of a "great American salvation" story, helpless &amp; innocent, surviving, also, against all odds.
1339493057973153793 2020-12-17 16:50:06 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JasonMillerinDC Where's Manafort?
1339489841843740673 2020-12-17 16:37:19 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @SenRonJohnson @SenSchumer This reads suspiciously like this disjointed rantings of a Russian asset under duress.  Is there anything you'd like to get off your chest, сенатор?
1339486851359514625 2020-12-17 16:25:26 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @MistressMalevo2 Toss up between Denny's and IHOP. At 2am, barely coherent, it's hard to judge. Just... bad.
1339486143105167360 2020-12-17 16:22:37 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @therealchelcy @JWANOTEDSKEPTIC I believe her name was "Jessica". I remember because it was the name of my own (then newly born) daughter.
1339485181737091072 2020-12-17 16:18:48 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @therealchelcy The never ending Viet Nam War. Every evening Walter Cronkite on the news w/the war dead. It filled me w/dread; I thought it was just a part of life, you grow up &amp; go to war. No one could explain to me why I would have to go off &amp; kill strangers who, in turn, were tryna kill me.

1339188734726692864 2020-12-16 20:40:49 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @ksorbs Nah, pretty sure that's not right at all. The vaccine is being administered by qualified medical professionals, not squealing, foot-stomping cry babies.  Plz be careful in the future to not scare ppl away from getting vaccinated.  Also stop being awful.

1336548726081540098 2020-12-09 13:50:22 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @tracybeanz @theangiestanton It doesn't take a law degree to see how incorrect that is.  It says pretty plainly that anyone 𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐝 (meeting the eligibility requirements) to vote during the general election can vote in the runoff. It does 𝐧𝐨𝐭 say they must've been registered during the general.

The real question is do we want to normalize this? SecDef should be a civilian job, and this is no small matter. Otherwise, Gen Austin looks to be a good choice. I myself am conflicted on the choice, tbh.

1335855478274985984 2020-12-07 15:55:39 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Msmariablack Me either. I think literal crack is probably less harmful today.
1335854973368881157 2020-12-07 15:53:39 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Msmariablack Yes, exactly. Fox has produced "conspiracy media crack heads" and Fox's crack ain't strong enough anymore.

1335853478292447232 2020-12-07 15:47:42 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Msmariablack Newsmax (+OAN) are the hottest new propaganda outlets for the far right. FAR more insane &amp; dishonest than Fox ever approached. In fact, the loons are abandoning Fox for them both (calling Fox "sellouts" to the "leftists". No, not kidding). EpochTimes is a fast up &amp; comer, also.

1335749880363487240 2020-12-07 08:56:03 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Cameron13107534 That's the (Repub) point. To use as many werdz as humanly possible to say absolutely nothing substantive. Just call your opponent "poopy head" as often as you can.

1335748698123493377 2020-12-07 08:51:21 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Cameron13107534 Because Reps understand the power of repetitious sloganeering, something Dems (as a general rule) really suck at. We need to up our messaging game.

Sorry not sorry, if you can't be bothered to mask up for the sake of my loved ones, then fuck you. Do your own begging.  Personal responsibility, remember bitchez?
1335737829406760960 2020-12-07 08:08:09 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @RealMattCouch No, I most certainly will not. If you miscreants can't put a fuckin mask on for the safety of me &amp; my babies, then don't you dare ask me to waste my energy &amp; time praying for God's mercy upon you.  Galatians 6:7 "God is not mocked: for what a man sows, so shall he reap."

1328576908976660484 2020-11-17 13:53:13 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Jimbippy Bippy, once you're reduced to retweeting your own last soggy, limp-meme, you've pretty much exhausted your entertainment value. Thank you, Twitter, for the mute button.
1328566393911062529 2020-11-17 13:11:26 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Jimbippy Weird that you think a straightforward presentation of fact "sounds big mad". Facts don't require "faith", they don't even depend on your recognition. They simply are. Nor do they care about your feelings.  Scweem and scweem all you want, Biden is your next President.
1328562648867352576 2020-11-17 12:56:33 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Jimbippy Actually, I have the results (tabulated by both Repubs &amp; Dems, in both blue states &amp; red) of the 2020 election.  Elections are decided by voters, not recently packed SCOTUS or demonstrably corrupt AG.  Don't need "luck", got the U.S. Constitution.

1328540578544578561 2020-11-17 11:28:51 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Jimbippy My mistake, you are correct. This leaves #PresidentRejectTrump only (roughly) 13,000 votes behind Biden in Georgia. 😂

My tweet, tho, was an honest mistake, not intentional disinfo (proving once again that I shouldn't tweet until fully awake ;-) I'll delete the tweet momentarily, hopefully giving you time to receive *this*, my sincere appreciation.

He also doesn't have the "authority" to obstruct an investigation into himself. But he did. I could go on &amp; on. Laws are as good as those upholding them.  Who's upholding them? Barr?

As for the military, many suspect that's precisely why he's fired Defense Secretary Esper. Remember he quelled a peaceful protest @ lincoln Square w/National Guard w/out dissent

1324505315400966146 2020-11-06 08:14:09 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @FrankFigliuzzi1 @FBI The fact that Steve Bannon's not in custody tells you all you need to know about the state of our "guardrails" right now.  #TrumpCrimeSyndicate #GOPComplicitTraitors #CountEveryVote
1324502493393571846 2020-11-06 08:02:57 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Once again the guy who told his supporters not to vote by mail is bewildered by the fact that he's losing the mail-in ballot count.

1324430697931694081 2020-11-06 03:17:39 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> That these chaos agents have firmly embedded themselves in our national government is a development that no one should take lightly.

Obviously, all he got wrong was your natural penchant for fuckin brazen lying.
1323352489161334784 2020-11-03 03:53:14 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @marklevinshow Typical @GOP dissembling bullshit, @marklevinshow. #FRAUD.

1323185811601432577 2020-11-02 16:50:55 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @john_quinby @SWAtlasHoover There's only two possibilities to explain Scott Atlas : 1) He's either unfathomably stupid, or 2) He's a liar  I lean toward choice #2, but could be both; they're not mutually exclusive. Either way he's certainly not someone to be trusted w/matters of life and death.

1322929437931950082 2020-11-01 23:52:11 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Okay Tweeps, so if Trump, w/court and GOP support, plainly and clearly steals this election... what do you plan to do? Do you have a plan?

1322464861507432449 2020-10-31 17:06:07 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @jesse_sumpter I love watching morons translate for Jesus.  Btw, where does Jesus stand on allowing slaves to vote? "Let slaves regard their masters as worthy of all honor..." 1 Timothy 6:1
1322444164324347905 2020-10-31 15:43:53 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @GOP @Mike_Pence You misspelled "charlatan". "... no greater 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐧..."  You're welcome.

1322423083693690881 2020-10-31 14:20:07 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @cptnrawrpnts They never let poor Spider Chicken join in any chicken games. Poor Spider Chicken. So lonely, so misunderstood.

1322340075565436928 2020-10-31 08:50:16 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @volunteermom113 @4cdperspective He's telling an inconvenient truth. Read the article, not the headline. The Democratic party is a natural ally of, say, Iowa farmers. In recent years that's not been adequately messaged.  Bernie is on our side, let's stop acting otherwise.

1321296969545953281 2020-10-28 11:45:20 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @cptnrawrpnts I'm sorry, but if you can't outsmart a fuckin shopping cart, maybe you should try to find something simpler to do. Not sure if sitting in the corner and drooling is considered a paid position anywhere, tho.
1321293812086591489 2020-10-28 11:32:47 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JBLegal1541 @benFranklin2018 I imagine calls for reconciliation constantly. That and a reluctance to set precedent by investigating a former President (even though it's actually already been set now).
1321292341672554496 2020-10-28 11:26:57 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @cptnrawrpnts God, how I hate when that happens.  Being dead ain't all it's cracked up to be, kids!
1321142333220495363 2020-10-28 01:30:52 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @TeamTrump Good God, this is an actual ad from the 𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 Trump Scampaign.  This sophomoric sh1t is brought to you by... The President of the United States.  PLEASE get these puerile ratfuckers outta here. #VoteThemOut &amp; replace with #BidenHarris2020.
1321131608209055744 2020-10-28 00:48:15 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @SenSchumer @realCannyTM Has he addressed the Russians offering bounties to the Taliban for dead American troops, yet?

1321121292427403265 2020-10-28 00:07:16 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @SenToddYoung We'll certainly keep that in mind.
1321120747419508739 2020-10-28 00:05:06 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JohnBechard Yep, we could go on for pages. An endorsement from the Taliban pretty much sums it all up, tho.
1321119104074481664 2020-10-27 23:58:34 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JohnBechard "Give" him nothing. We didn't get outta any war, ramped-up drone strikes in Somalia &amp; Yemen, sold weaponry to the Kingdom of Saud to continue their repressive &amp; oppressive actions in the region, abandoned our allies to Syrian, Turk &amp; Russian forces... on and on.  NO SOUP FOR HIM.
1321110701159653377 2020-10-27 23:25:10 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> No. Y'all stop it. He's going to deny the results and contest the election. He'll take it to the courts he's so thoroughly packed.  And if ppl don't prepare for this, then he'll likely get away w/it, as well.
1321108673658236938 2020-10-27 23:17:07 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @KLoeffler Toads have higher functioning thought processes than you.

1317680950558543873 2020-10-18 12:16:34 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @NeilLowenthal1 I wanted to say something nice about her, you know, for balance. But I'm drawing a blank. I think I might've laughed a couple of time at her character on Cheers, I can't honestly remember, tho.
1317680038083428352 2020-10-18 12:12:57 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JoeExecutive1 I always thought Shelly Long was funnier anyway.

1312025642385506304 2020-10-02 21:44:24 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @candies2639 This is actually done to signal nuclear nations not to get any "wise ideas" while the CiC is down. Srsly.
1312024660977033216 2020-10-02 21:40:30 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @AynRandPaulRyan Did you make this yourself as a gag? If not, it's pretty suspicious looking (I srsly doubt it's real). $421 Million is Trump's debt just reported by the NYTimes.  https://t.co/9F4Ax8Vtbl
1312017742690693120 2020-10-02 21:13:00 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Okay, so in hindsight this is already reading kinda weird, like the scheming of an eight year old.  #TrumpHasCovid, so what happened to the #MelaniaTapes?  https://t.co/WzMolLhrlI
1312011499662192641 2020-10-02 20:48:12 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @cptnrawrpnts So heartwarming. The children really are our future.
1312010985218203648 2020-10-02 20:46:09 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Um, the obvious answer is, "No, Biden shouldn't 'suspend his campaign'".  The MOAR obvious answer is, "Fuck Trump". #TrumpHasCovid #IDontCareDoU  https://t.co/a7XuCRkt9J
1312008638379315201 2020-10-02 20:36:49 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @painting_tlc You've stumbled upon bot.  It's bots all the way down!  My GOD! It's full of BOTS!  https://t.co/Kfls7Ki07n

1312004299329855489 2020-10-02 20:19:35 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JayRouseDC Funny, that.
1311990516280680449 2020-10-02 19:24:49 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @tehsilentcircus @sarahkendzior Better make it a double.
1311981844863352833 2020-10-02 18:50:21 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @ChedwickSir You forgot to scweem "Fake News!!11", Goober.
1311980434549604354 2020-10-02 18:44:45 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @DeAnna4Congress Shoulda gone with "OBAMA DUNNIT!!!!111".  Now you're just gonna have to be happy w/the ratio coming your way.
1311977704728809472 2020-10-02 18:33:54 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @ChedwickSir Of course I do. Anyone w/more than two firing neurons to rub together know their political bent. They proudly announce it w/signs at their protests and #HASHTAGS (#UNMASK) right here. I mean, srsly? Trump himself started the fuckin nonsense.  Try that silly shit w/someone else.
1311955532022939648 2020-10-02 17:05:48 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Not seeing how that would interfere w/his day-long, semicoherent rage tweeting while screaming at Fox News.
1311952036062203904 2020-10-02 16:51:54 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Nope. Her aim is true. #TrumpHasCovid
1311948707064156161 2020-10-02 16:38:41 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @yuzer_name @salex5760 @robholts @codermb1138 @ColumbiaBugle It's possible he simply had 'bating men on his mind. You know, honest mistake.
1311947279025221632 2020-10-02 16:33:00 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @PattyArquette I don't think that's been a problem for him.
1311945714528813057 2020-10-02 16:26:47 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Sooo... I'm guessing now that #TrumpHasCovid, he'll be unable to participate in further debates?  Hmmm. Such a shame. I mean, he was so roundly praised for his last performance. Well, at least no one's talking about those pesky #MelaniaTapes anymore. 🤨
1311944471941206016 2020-10-02 16:21:51 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @princessBabs3 @itsJeffTiedrich Nope, you are not alone.
1311943307451273217 2020-10-02 16:17:13 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> I  absolutely denounce white supremacy in all its guises.  It's a scourge for the world.  See it.  Call it out.  Stop it.   PASS IT ON.
1311940728055107584 2020-10-02 16:06:58 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Msmariablack Yep, I'm expecting a "miracle recovery" to showcase his stamina, strength and overall awesomeness.  Maybe even announced w/a "miracle cure"?  Sux he (w/Putin) have destroyed all public trust. I'd've never thought this way even about Dubya.
1311938588855218176 2020-10-02 15:58:28 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Not sure why "President Pelosi" is trending. I promise you that if Trump &amp; Pence both contracted covid, the Repubs would have one of them Presidenting from the morgue if need be. #TrumpHasCovid #GOPComplicitTraitors
1311934642753351681 2020-10-02 15:42:48 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @ViviVacca @smartgirls4gop @pastorlocke @realDonaldTrump Well that didn't age well.
1311933816320204800 2020-10-02 15:39:31 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Whoa, whoa, WHOA! What's this "TOGETHER!" bullshit?  I hope for you precisely what you've hoped (daily, publicly, and excitedly) for 60% of this country for the last four yrs.
1311930678053928961 2020-10-02 15:27:02 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Karens_Red_Pony Definitely something about the timing seems suspicious. Late night, Oct FIRST, right after release of #MelaniaTapes we hear #TrumpHasCovid?  Remember in '16 when the largest dump of DNC (Podesta) Emails came: 28 MINUTES after AccessHollywood tape was released.
1311929783014563840 2020-10-02 15:23:29 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Msmariablack I can't help but think along these lines; somehow, for some reason, fake. Not convinced of that, but damn suspicious of it.
1311927337047461888 2020-10-02 15:13:46 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @GeorgenewsOrg @POTUS Yeah, I think the story ended w/all of Job's family dead. #TrumpHasCovid  https://t.co/FUg8zTcCho
1311921046640091137 2020-10-02 14:48:46 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @RandyRRQuaid Why all the prayer? No one hardly gets it and, besides, it's "totally harmless", you know, like a cold. Anyway, I think it disappeared like a miracle back in April.  https://t.co/pvzdDBz0U2
1311918317796577280 2020-10-02 14:37:55 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> So weird to see MAGA Twitter "Praying So Hard" 'cuz the Trumps got covid when yesterday they were screaming at store clerks about fuckin masks. #TrumpHasCovid
1311899340747796480 2020-10-02 13:22:31 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS It is what it is.
1311897454133022721 2020-10-02 13:15:01 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> #TrumpHasCovid Can you even 𝐛𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐧 to imagine the conspiracy theories if the mutherfucker ends up dying of the rona? MAGA will have an out-n-out QAnonMeltdown.
1311896345377230848 2020-10-02 13:10:37 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> #TrumpHasCovid? I smell bullshit.
1311885477759324162 2020-10-02 12:27:26 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @FBIdaughter1 Yup, seems fairly straightforward, dunnit.
1311884402339786753 2020-10-02 12:23:09 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @realDonaldTrump This is your worst own-the-libs tweet yet.

1311127227208216577 2020-09-30 10:14:25 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Trump: "Who would you like me to condemn? Proud Boys? Stand back and stand by".  Okay, we'll just add the word "condemn" to the already far too long list of words trump doesn't understand.
1311126378633363458 2020-09-30 10:11:02 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump "NO! The truth ISN'T THE TRUTH!!"  ~Also Rudy Colludy
1311123293244739585 2020-09-30 09:58:47 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @charliekirk11 Sorry Charlie, his sloganeering hasn't helped a fuckin thing.
1311122933939662848 2020-09-30 09:57:21 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Talia_Christine I was thinking tranquilizer gun, but we can start w/that.
1311119407003791360 2020-09-30 09:43:20 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Is Wallace PURPOSELY letting Trump roll all over him?! 'Cuz it sure as fvck seems so.
1311118253230620674 2020-09-30 09:38:45 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Biden needs to ask Trump why the fuck has he got his rally attendees signing a 'no-fault' agreement if they're so goddamn safe.
1311117206789513217 2020-09-30 09:34:36 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> I clearly fucked up by not getting good and drunk FIRST!
1311113723684237312 2020-09-30 09:20:45 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> JFC, Wallace! I can't listen to this shit much more. Be a goddamn moderator and shut Trump's fat fuckin ass UP.
1311001638732259332 2020-09-30 01:55:22 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Megame13425947 @WashYourHands55 @McKaylaRoseJ This is because Trump's only "ideology" is "Me. Me First, Me Last, Always Me. Me, Me, Me".  Tho he despises virtually all Americans, he has an especially profound contempt for his own supporters.
1310877593147764736 2020-09-29 17:42:27 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @NewKindOfPol If you don't have a $10 MILLION net worth you're tryna hoard, then no, you don't agree w/her.
1310876939176079360 2020-09-29 17:39:51 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JennaEllisEsq "... into the fucking ground".  There. You're welcome.
1310876399914414080 2020-09-29 17:37:43 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @JohnCornyn And yet you didn't dispute a single fuckin' charge.
1310872701062524928 2020-09-29 17:23:01 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @2Heidishattuck7 @uflo5 😳  https://t.co/OJsOb51VFe
1310860289420734464 2020-09-29 16:33:42 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> It's 2020. 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 tomorrow is going to be insane.
1310850734599090176 2020-09-29 15:55:44 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @EricTrump Rlly?  Shame, I hear the Trump's have all had very positive results w/drug tests.
1310780283566936064 2020-09-29 11:15:47 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @painting_tlc @paledave Ho-lee-shit. I was just doing my usual "say-something-st00pid-and-run" routine. But you laughed so hard it scared me. Just googled "cone porn". 😳 I had no idea...  So, so very sorry to everyone concerned.😂
1310777669206892544 2020-09-29 11:05:24 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Kokomothegreat And yet it still works.
1310774678466842624 2020-09-29 10:53:31 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @cpoliticditto When I was a kid in middle school we didn't have no fancy "backpacks". We had 2 rocks and a stick... AND WE LIKED IT!!
1310772234080972808 2020-09-29 10:43:48 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @painting_tlc Are you maybe thinking of cone porn?  If not, @paledave's right.
1310741555226062848 2020-09-29 08:41:53 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @starsat_night Bingo!
1310739233699581952 2020-09-29 08:32:40 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @realDonaldTrump Feel free to go ahead and drop one yourself to be "bigger man".  😂😂😂 I almost didn't get that shit typed out!
1310734600164044833 2020-09-29 08:14:15 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> I love watching Dumb and Dumber MAGAs lose their shit over Hollywood as they defend the washed-up Hollywood reality tv creation they voted into the Presidency.
1310729207379525635 2020-09-29 07:52:49 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> Oh, shit! Poppy Harlow done snapped Morgenstern's neck. #BrokeAssPresident #TrumpCrimeFamily #GOPComplicitTraitors #BidenHarris2020
1310713010995027970 2020-09-29 06:48:28 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @DrEvil63 @boricuaranqueao @pttrn_ntgrty Shoulda complied.
1310710746737790983 2020-09-29 06:39:28 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @nixw20 Only if Trump agrees to sit through my condo presentation afterwards.
1310700361255133188 2020-09-29 05:58:12 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @ParZevil Well, drinking MOAR, of course.
1310700085890744320 2020-09-29 05:57:06 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @DrPresage Weird. He must think then that Bill Clinton was elected to be his wife's husband.
1310689541125275649 2020-09-29 05:15:12 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @BradleyCongress Where can we find this "guilty verdict", you slobbering ogre?
1310688910905937921 2020-09-29 05:12:42 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @infinite_scream Thanks, I.S.  (Nope, we can scream in here.)
1310687269012021253 2020-09-29 05:06:10 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @hierophantess .@infinite_scream, help me out...
1310687009258770434 2020-09-29 05:05:09 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Kokomothegreat My goodness. Dude shoulda complied!
1310685971386638336 2020-09-29 05:01:01 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Msmariablack @chipfranklin But, Lordy, don't get 'em started on some working immigrant family receiving a meager, trifling amount of food stamps.
1310685833436033030 2020-09-29 05:00:28 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Msmariablack @chipfranklin Yep Anyone but Trump pulls that kinda shit and they're "part of the swamp" or "one of the elite" or "cheats scamming America". But #DonTheCon evades paying taxes and it shows "how smart he is" and what a "great businessman he is".  🙄
1310682826032009222 2020-09-29 04:48:31 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @VoteMarsha Why won’t #DonTheCon release his health care plan?
1310682502386900995 2020-09-29 04:47:14 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @VoteMarsha Why won’t John Barron release his tax returns?
1310678406695092230 2020-09-29 04:30:58 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @EricTrump Probably about the same time he last charged the Secret Service and members of the Senate to stay at his hotels and play golf on his courses.
1310536040151740416 2020-09-28 19:05:15 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @KellyScaletta Babies.
1310534423352401920 2020-09-28 18:58:49 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @charliekirk11 Sorry, Charlie... the courts have ruled on the 1st Amendment rights of journalists and confidentiality of sources repeatedly. And not in your favor.  Womp Fucking Womp.
1310532223410614272 2020-09-28 18:50:05 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @jaws769 My sincere condolences for your loss.
1310487497336643584 2020-09-28 15:52:21 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @_DFlynn @EricTrump @nytimes I see. So you don't actually have any fact-based response to the Judge's order and legal reasoning, just a ... "bet"... as to his personal political leaning (and not even an evidential argument for that irrelevant assumption)  Maybe u should take your "appeal" to Eric's attorneys
1310432592156594176 2020-09-28 12:14:11 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> His phone might've been repossessed.

1310415192858165249 2020-09-28 11:05:02 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Kokomothegreat Damn! I almost fell off.

1310393066893848577 2020-09-28 09:37:07 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @EricTrump @nytimes lol Subpoenaed witness says wut?   https://t.co/EvtN9JUWYD
1310377110670839809 2020-09-28 08:33:43 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @charliekirk11 Your only interest is spreading propaganda.  The only reason to even suggest that Trump is a "billionaire" is because it benefits you personally. Otherwise, you'd have sent this tweet yrs ago in regards to Mitch McConnell.
1310372520768557058 2020-09-28 08:15:29 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @DonaldJTrumpJr 😂😂😂 Good call, Con Jr. "Quick! Point at the black guy!"  https://t.co/S3WrObgiMO
1310345667609591809 2020-09-28 06:28:46 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> So, to put this in perspective, Trump paid MOAR in 2016 for a sympathy fuck from a pornstar than he paid in taxes after lying to the IRS.  #TrumpTaxReturns  https://t.co/uygfn2y8m8
1310338351929667586 2020-09-28 05:59:42 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @Shaken0Stirred Sounds like the little fella earned his right to live.  Let 'im go, he ain't gonna bother you. Worst he'll do is help keep your place bug-free. And that's not a bad thing.

1310058475528097792 2020-09-27 11:27:34 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @EricTrump And yet it was carried on CNN. Therefore it is not true.  You are indeed a paradoxical malformity of nature.
1310054250471452672 2020-09-27 11:10:47 +0800 <TheHatefulDead> @tedcruz Weird, that what your wife said about marrying you.
