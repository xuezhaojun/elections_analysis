Just as you aren't allowed do anything you want with a legal firearm or a car. If we take away incentive we slow progress. Not materially, realistically

1341174648801792000 2020-12-22 08:12:08 +0800 <BackShadys> @Rolloson14 I believe this is a misunderstanding, and a hazy vision of where the line should be. Labour, ingenuity, entrepreneurial attitudes, creativity etc, these drive humanity forward. These qualities are best facilitated and fostered, imo, in a capitalist environment. My view is summed

You can't call yourself liberal, even a neo one, if you believe people should be deprived of public services if they don't subscribe to your views.

Cork have a team coming through that'll topple them unless dublin matches them with pedigree coming through.

Participation awards, the constant targeting of success or genuine competition and merit etc, it's all leading to producing people even less capable of have the will and resilience to fight back.

1337217427965358081 2020-12-11 10:07:33 +0800 <BackShadys> @PavelDaRussian1 Yeah it's outrageous to be sure.

They don't give a shit about anyone. They're just worried someday they might actually need the care of these nurses.

Their buying power affords them more negotiating power with returns etc because the manufacturer ir distributor doesn't want to lose them as a client.

So legislating against these problems is very complex, and my worry is that the issues won't be considered fully before acting impulsively. I don't claim to have the answers, but I want to have the conversation.
1336119672102653954 2020-12-08 09:25:28 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn 3. For the average citizen to open a shop and compete for a livelihood is all but destroyed due to multinationals. Now we have to decide which of the hundred options suit. Ban multinationals? What if there aren't enough Irish looking to run supermarkets? We get Super Valu taking
1336119278723018757 2020-12-08 09:23:54 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn 2. So already small shops are being squeezed out of existence by Tescos, Lidl etc etc. This is another conversation of creative destruction.  Pro: products are cheaper for consumers, shopping is more convenient with diff products under one roof  Cons: the equality of opportunity
1336118896882049026 2020-12-08 09:22:23 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn Well it does if it's a kind of lifetime redundancy, alleviating the problem from the current generation. And being sure the following generations understand from school what is and isn't available to them. But let me waffle for a sec, cause this is already a problem,1
1336117264303726595 2020-12-08 09:15:54 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn Look at it from a problem solving perspective. We can make it law that companies automating the workforce pay redundancy etc. They'll move into sales etc. We fly into space man, we used to cuddle round fires. I'm confident we'll figure it out if we apply ourselves genuinely.
1336116480346361858 2020-12-08 09:12:47 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn I mean its not about "wrong with it" in truth. It's as simple as the fact it's an occupation currently in the automation firing line. It's why we're having the conversation. I didn't pick it, just unlike trucking I dont think it necessitates human employment in the future.
1336114807406260225 2020-12-08 09:06:08 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn Nothing's wrong with it. There's nothing wrong with walking into town either. It'd be good for me technically. But let's be honest. What's wrong with it? Whats wrong is you can't work a till and buy a home in Dublin. And the unfortunate truth is unskilled labour has less value
1336113349684305922 2020-12-08 09:00:21 +0800 <BackShadys> Eh, closet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1336112815296417792 2020-12-08 08:58:13 +0800 <BackShadys> Eventually, teleportation will exist, and be safe. If not for biological matter, at least for inanimate objects.  It will obliterate the delivery industry. Land, air, and water.  But what do we do, just leave it in the closest? We'll adapt. We barely had fire once.
1336110963565715456 2020-12-08 08:50:52 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn You're right, people will be caught in the middle of the transition. But what's the solution, humans work tills forever? It's that or at some point the transition has to occur. Like postmen and emails it likely won't be as bad as we fear, a transition period I mean.
1336110511805657090 2020-12-08 08:49:04 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn Well the fiends are, I'm not lol. I'd rather human drivers over self driving machines any day. And I believe a human should be met by another human in customer service, not a dysfunctional stupid AI. I'm more specifically referring to Gearoids example and small shops. But,

1336106235138105346 2020-12-08 08:32:04 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn Future generations will be simply incapable of the tasks. They'll be made accessible. Most couldn't invent a computer, but we can teach a high amount to work on them, and virtually all of us can use them. The same principle will apply to future tech etc imo. 2/2
1336105714582958081 2020-12-08 08:30:00 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn I disagree. If we're talking about current people, then yes, a 40yo driver or cashier is unlikely to upskill. That's the problem, it has to happen sometime so there's always a generation caught in the middle. But I don't think conceptually we need to keep jobs because, 1/2
1336102754532651011 2020-12-08 08:18:14 +0800 <BackShadys> Fuck, and I meant to say that with tools they save individuals labour. These kind of advancements can shave labour hours for the collective, and propel society into a more advanced state, with a better educated populace etc.
1336102171281141761 2020-12-08 08:15:55 +0800 <BackShadys> In short all I'm saying is don't be so quick to write off progress as evil, just because it benefits somebody who's already rich. Creative Destruction is a very real thing, and something that needs to be involved in conversations like this.
1336102169502752768 2020-12-08 08:15:55 +0800 <BackShadys> will require a more and more skilled workforce as we progress. Arguably these lower paying jobs are best automated. Their requiring to be staffed will require a living minimum wage. This will continually inflate prices, driving up the cost of minimum wage, perpetuating the cycle.
1336102167833432064 2020-12-08 08:15:55 +0800 <BackShadys> Are we aiming for a future where in 200 years humans still work at tills? Certain industries will always be necessary,some should be arguably be naturally shed to free up the future workforce for emerging industries,of which there are many. Every year we're developing things that
1336102165996318721 2020-12-08 08:15:54 +0800 <BackShadys> See the thing about this is, and I'm not directly advocating for it, but hear me out.  We like calculators and electric saws etc, they save time and labour. The likes of self service tills can br viewed cynically as the company trying to cut costs. And it is. But here's the point
1336099034075959300 2020-12-08 08:03:27 +0800 <BackShadys> @gearoidmurphy_ The thing about this is it's a conversation to be viewed relative to creative destruction.I honestly think someday small shops will be replaced by giant vending machines in the walls.Not saying that's progress, but it's worth talking about. It's essentially upskilling generations
1336096880594391040 2020-12-08 07:54:54 +0800 <BackShadys> Absolutely shitting themselves.  And LCheile are more proof that they're all shaking in their boots, and all they can see so far is the tip of the iceberg. Strap in leftys, bumpy decade ahead for you.

1335769130096599042 2020-12-07 10:12:32 +0800 <BackShadys> @NeeveBennett Your claims are based on unequal outcomes and subjective claims of discrimination.

The Irish are tired of having their waters over exploited by other nations. The whole deal isn't really working out to our liking. We're gonna renegotiate, or just walk away from the table. We're fine with either option.

Wanting to do something that you yourself keep tearing apart because you say it's not good enough, and it never will be, but you keep trying, like a loon.

But immigration should never be at the expense of the native population, in terms of opportunity or resources etc.
1331389337385263105 2020-11-25 08:08:48 +0800 <BackShadys> @bazyjonesy @TraceyOMahony81 True the states are messy that way. And I fully agree on self defense. And as you say the fact they can just write travel and lockdown laws shows a serious lack of specificity in exactly what their mandate and reach should be. It's definitely Social Contract upgrade time.

1331387921853767680 2020-11-25 08:03:11 +0800 <BackShadys> @bazyjonesy @TraceyOMahony81 I'm definitely on board with the sentiment that our legal system needs work. But with discretion I mean the fact a guard is not legally obliged to report and file every minor crime. It's within their rights to let us off with a warning. In the states they'd be prosecuted for it
1331385450720792582 2020-11-25 07:53:22 +0800 <BackShadys> @bazyjonesy @TraceyOMahony81 I'd be inclined to largely disagree. But I get the feeling we have very different situations in mind. I'd rather not see an American style system where there's no option but the letter of the law. It'd wanna be a muxh better thought out set of laws than we have now.

1331298870240956423 2020-11-25 02:09:19 +0800 <BackShadys> then you're too dangerous to have in a position of responsibility.  Neither those who fine or those willing to use discretion and turn a blind eye should be forgotten, just for different reasons.
1331298868550639619 2020-11-25 02:09:19 +0800 <BackShadys> If/when the fines start there should be a list started of every badge number that issued a fine.  If we find they still have their discretion, then they are complicit. Whether through indoctrination, fear etc is irrelevant.  If you're willing to blindly enforce arbitrary tyranny,
1331296445337645057 2020-11-25 01:59:41 +0800 <BackShadys> @TraceyOMahony81 Tracey is it possible to know if the Garda√≠ still have their powers of discretion available relative to these fines, or like in America would they be legally obliged to fine any individual they come across breaking the "rules"?
1331296008979030021 2020-11-25 01:57:57 +0800 <BackShadys> I'll say it again. At some point "I was just following orders" runs outta mileage. And words like complicit become hard to ignore.

1330684243765317633 2020-11-23 09:27:01 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase @NuclearTakes Is your logic that whites colonised Africa(the Irish didn't, but thanks for the racist collective guilt attack) so it's ok Africans don't want whites there?  By your logic I can not want English people here? Maybe even seize loyalists property in the north like South Africa?
1330683771323027456 2020-11-23 09:25:08 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase @NuclearTakes So you've no answer for that either, you'd rather skirt around yet another inconsistency in the lefts worldview, which you clearly carry.  I'd think as a scientist the very fact you can't answer these questions would make you start to doubt the validity of the beliefs. Maybe not
1330683155200806912 2020-11-23 09:22:41 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase @NuclearTakes That's not an answer in the slightest. Deflect if you like, it proves nothing.

1330681740713668612 2020-11-23 09:17:04 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase @NuclearTakes What's that got to do with anything?  Premise: Diversity is enriching and valuable.  Question: why doesn't Africa want any of it?  If a lack of representation for POC in white countries is indicative of racism, what is Africa's lack of white representation indicative of?
1330680516656459777 2020-11-23 09:12:12 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase @NuclearTakes Please reread it slowly. It's not but a request for consistency in the logic.  Why should Ireland push for diversity but Africa doesn't? Don't they too want to be enriched? I thought diversity was beneficial etc, why aren't they pushing for employment quotas for minorities?
1330679638876680193 2020-11-23 09:08:43 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase @NuclearTakes No, I'm applying literally the same logic to both continents. How could campaigns for diversity be good in white countries but bad in Africa?
1330677997850996741 2020-11-23 09:02:12 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase That's just how you see it.  Do you think if I ran massive campaigns to bring more diversity to Africa, and pushed for racial employment quotas to ensure whites are represented in high offices, that would be a welcome and tolerated idea?
1330677616647544833 2020-11-23 09:00:41 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase @MichaelNBarron That's only if supplies run short. At least we're having a real conversation now. I accept Ireland and the states aren't in the same boat. But here the measures are wildly out of proportion, and having devastating effects longterm.
1330677124945108993 2020-11-23 08:58:44 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase Also that's not me complaining about people living here.

1330676708735905792 2020-11-23 08:57:04 +0800 <BackShadys> @spacermase You don't think it's racist against white people to say life would be better with more POC around? You don't think that implies that we are lacking something only they can provide? Would you reverse that logic? I prefer individualism.

You say, basically, sex is physical, gender is non-physical. So, in physical competition, should people not compete based on their sex rather than their gender, given the competition is based in the physical realm,not mental
1327027936864690177 2020-11-13 07:18:09 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal All you're doing objectively is saying "no you're wrong, you don't understand". Surely there's a better argument to back all this up than that?

1327013029146464257 2020-11-13 06:18:55 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal They aren't opinions, they're scientific physiological classifications. Gender is sophistry designed for this exact aim, along with others. They can be a feminine male, a ladyboy, trans, whatever. But they were born male, they don't compete with women, it's proven unfair.
1327011458216046593 2020-11-13 06:12:40 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal So let me follow through with your logic here. Mary was disqualified for still having a penis(strange accessory for a woman), but if Mary had gotten rid of the penis prior to the competition then you believe Mary should hold the records, that about right?

1327009466303340545 2020-11-13 06:04:46 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal Yeah, the criteria was, be a female.
1327006953739051014 2020-11-13 05:54:47 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal Well I guess cause you tweeted it then it must be true.

You can babble on about gender and sex not being the same thing, it's a paper thin laughable argument.

1326988287123337231 2020-11-13 04:40:36 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal Sure I don't. People who were born as males want to be females.

1326987814433644546 2020-11-13 04:38:43 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal I never said women and men don't injure each other, I just said we shouldn't allow men to injure women.

1326984341751275522 2020-11-13 04:24:55 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal That seems to waffle on, can you highlight where it proves it's a common injury? I've watched professional fighting for years and years, I have few to no memories of fighters suffering that injury. Unfortunately the stats would probably consider amateur stats, less regulated,
1326982460966637573 2020-11-13 04:17:27 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal You're still wrong though. That injury is not common, and plenty of fights end with nothing more than some bad bruising when opponents are matched properly. To downplay the fact a man smashed up a woman in a cage fight is pretty fuckin weird, like what's the goal here?
1326978810500222977 2020-11-13 04:02:57 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal If the goal was simply bodily harm then the most lethal strikes wouldn't all be banned.
1326978682083303434 2020-11-13 04:02:26 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal Not really no. A tap will suffice via the threat of bodily harm. Like an armbar where you can submit or have your arm broken. The goal is simply to win. Most athletes who respect the sport want to compete, not really cause damage. Otherwise there'd be alot more people hurt.
1326977811052187648 2020-11-13 03:58:58 +0800 <BackShadys> @_Lucy_Snowe_ @freesafelegal Most common? How likely is it to occur? I love when non-sports playing people tell me about the rarity or lack of with regards to sporting injuries.  It's not common, and when it occurs it's because there was bad matchmaking that shouldn't have happened.

1324397257567969280 2020-11-06 01:04:46 +0800 <BackShadys> The figures speak for themselves.  Being homeless has a far higher mortality rate than being in Direct Provision tryna scam the Irish state for even better free meals and free accommodation  There is no debate. This is systemically anti-Irish. Again the opposite, of CRT this time
1324385680781463552 2020-11-06 00:18:46 +0800 <BackShadys> @bazyjonesy @EdwardRocket1 @lugh____ @Mike_Hennessy87 @hazechu 100%, they all keep saying we're a rich country. So are our government just that horrific then that we're rich but refusing to house the homeless or pay off our massive debts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If they'd only sit down and just think about it for 10 minutes.
1324384049759137792 2020-11-06 00:12:17 +0800 <BackShadys> @EdwardRocket1 @lugh____ @Mike_Hennessy87 @bazyjonesy @hazechu Simple question.  Do you think the homeless could be helped sooner if we weren't overcrowding the country relative to housing supply, and we stopped giving away almost a billion in present money to other nations?  Or is it racist to suggest we pay our own bills before charity?
1324383311536574464 2020-11-06 00:09:21 +0800 <BackShadys> @hazechu Hazel can you please tell me what's racist about Direct Provision? I keep asking and not a single person on your side has an answer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Nobody's answered this article either, yet you push for hate crime legislation, where is this article wrong please?   https://t.co/F6TFa2kE4J
1324064142320435206 2020-11-05 03:01:06 +0800 <BackShadys> @thejournal_ie In any room of decent people he'd face criticism from every single one, this just shows how sick the majority of the D√°il is.  You can leak info to pals, you can rub shoulders with pedophile apologists, you can step over the Irish homeless for DP. Exactly how does one get fired?
1323702252138340352 2020-11-04 03:03:04 +0800 <BackShadys> @TimesOfDeceit @LiamK1916 And the "even keel" would still require the fact that we(the west) are more productive to supplement everyone else, it'd still be racial global communism. I'm not sure I see them ever wiping debts clean though. If they did it's cause they no longer need the money, it's bribe time
1323689876571721729 2020-11-04 02:13:54 +0800 <BackShadys> @LiamK1916 Yeah maybe it wasn't meant to be literal and it just slipped out relative to the banks, his thinking being if you own a home you've facilitated and profited a bank. I agree with him otherwise, but I defo believe we should own homes though, as I'm sure most of us do.

1323686273421352961 2020-11-04 01:59:35 +0800 <BackShadys> @LiamK1916 The banks are our enemy, and the mortgage is gauged to create lifelong labour slaves, but him saying "nobody should own a home" leads to only two conclusions. A renting population, or universal social housing, which will become dystopian.
1323666663267618817 2020-11-04 00:41:39 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn Tbh I've kinda decided that myself until the new year. I've some shit I wanna get done and there's absolutely no unity or cohesion, so I'm better off putting time into my situation for right now, there are no fruits from putting time into this lately.

But then there's the riddle, are Micks protests NP or not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èlol, seems to be some flip flopping on that answer.  I just know who the minions on here speak for, so I'm just holding them to their own standards

1323292097890443266 2020-11-02 23:53:16 +0800 <BackShadys> @IrishTimes I'm sure this has nothing to do with lowering emissions so we can bring a million Africans and thousands of people from Hong Kong.  It's so nice when the Irish have to change their lives to facilitate people currently in other countries. White privilege is grand so it is.
1323287501293850625 2020-11-02 23:35:00 +0800 <BackShadys> It's funny so many members say they aren't Keith Woods fans, yet they spout the exact same nonsense... weird little mystery.  I can tell ya this for certain. If I had a party, I'd have disowned certain people right off the bat. Not pretend I don't agree while in truth I do ü§î

Why are some people so fanatically licking the balls of a Marxist whose only skill that makes him stand out from the crowd is scrolling back through twitter accounts for bad words. Never heard a drop of ideology but "muh class war". Lol ok...
1323119937330814977 2020-11-02 12:29:10 +0800 <BackShadys> @boredlacanian @KamalaHarris If what you say is true, why the need at all for the term Equity? Equality has normally meant of opportunity, so why the new term?  Because they want peddle equal outcomes under the guise of Original Position, but know that being open about it will invite major pushback

1323003986224570371 2020-11-02 04:48:25 +0800 <BackShadys> She wants equality of outcome, without telling you she wants equality of outcome.

I'm asking while disputing logic, would you also dispute science and say that I can be any gender I like? Or do you not feel a need to ground any beliefs at all in objectivity?

The reason western languages are similar is because they are mostly derived in the long run from the PIE language. With others like Latin in between the timeline.

What about Leo's comment on public services being "very white, and that actually needs to change".  Insert Jewish instead of white, then watch the internet break...  But it's cool to shit on white Irish people apparently. This equality stuff is great craic

Ireland is in massive debt and has plenty of it's own people who need help.  Maybe, just maybe, other countries could look after their own people? Are they so bad it's our job?

Now it's obvious that it should always be our brightest minds running the country. Not just to avoid deception etc, but to fix organic flaws too

They all play parish politics because their parish are the only ones capable of voting them in, so you get almost like an area code identity politics that overlooks the big picture.

When they refused over and over to close airports etc I starting thinking they aren't acting like people worried about a pandemic, not even a little bit.

Idk, to an extent only time will tell. I'd say you're right that the threat of internment or 'social exile' with "you could be asymptomatic" will work on most,rough road ahead

1319152010390798336 2020-10-22 13:42:02 +0800 <BackShadys> Kimberl√© Crenshaw. James Connolly. Karl Marx. Thomas Sowell.  I'm sorry, but I don't care what your name is. I only care about ideas, and the effect they will have on peoples lives.  The more prominent a bad idea becomes the more I have to answer. It's just balance.
1319150875907133441 2020-10-22 13:37:32 +0800 <BackShadys> AKA Thomas Sowell is wrong. Imagine that, imagine there being someone who's right on some things but wrong on others.  Wild theory I know.
1319149595251924992 2020-10-22 13:32:26 +0800 <BackShadys> in an ever expanding monetary system. That's arguably why minimum wage needs to exist and needs to continue increasing too. Because if not then the relative value of todays decent wage will still see you starve in 20 years time.  Things are too interconnected to say it's simple.
1319149593242816513 2020-10-22 13:32:26 +0800 <BackShadys> effect on speeding up the inflation of prices is another conversation too. Most people know prices tick up, especially when minimum wage goes up and greedy companies think there's extra money to be made. But really it's all happening anyway as they try to maintain relative value
1319149591481245696 2020-10-22 13:32:25 +0800 <BackShadys> it can't become the norm. In my eyes it's fine if here and there someone gets work that's off the books and maybe not great pay or whatever. But it's another to allow that to become a problem.  Sidenote: whether minimum wage is currently gauged correctly is another convo. And its
1319149589618958337 2020-10-22 13:32:25 +0800 <BackShadys> society, off the books jobs will always happen. That's where they need to stay. We can't set legal financial policy based on your nephew doing a few hours here and there, and you maybe rightly saying it should be fine to "underpay" him relative to minimum wage. But,
1319149587698012162 2020-10-22 13:32:24 +0800 <BackShadys> there being a rising demand, hence rising profits, ie capital to employ people.  This shit is sophistry aimed at replacing you with cheap foreign labour. I see no other conclusion.  If you wanna give your young nephew some work do the shit cash. Unless "they" get their cashless
1319149582794805252 2020-10-22 13:32:23 +0800 <BackShadys> have to ask why you need staff. If you can't afford them then you clearly aren't doing much business, which in turn should mean you don't need many staff. Demand for labour is pretty proportional to the demand for the given product. A need for employees cannot arise without
1319149581209358336 2020-10-22 13:32:23 +0800 <BackShadys> myself? Why not just be a sole trader, make my 5k units and be self-sufficient. Why bother expanding and hiring staff if it's not worth my while? That's the kinda system that creates unemployment.  Another point is that if you say you need more staff but can't afford them, I'd
1319149579045081089 2020-10-22 13:32:22 +0800 <BackShadys> unsustainable business. The entire point of having staff is to meet a demand larger than you can personally. The whole point of a wage is to create profit, otherwise what is the incentive? Why build a company up to sell a million units if I only profit from the 5 thousand I make
1319149577333841920 2020-10-22 13:32:22 +0800 <BackShadys> how can you argue it's stopping you taking on more staff, if you can't afford the increase how could you afford another full wage packet?  If you're paying more for staff than you're making then I'd have to break the bad news to you that you've somehow found a structurally
1319149575219851264 2020-10-22 13:32:22 +0800 <BackShadys> Minimum wage is a positive, any 'negative' is sophistry aimed at grinding wages down into oblivion.  If you as a business can't afford a minor increase then what are you living off? Where is your profit to begin with? If you can't afford the minor increases of minimum wage then
1319149573424713728 2020-10-22 13:32:21 +0800 <BackShadys> *sigh*  Minimum wage is not the devil, it's the best protection you have against an industry price signalling wages like they do with prices. It's also your best protection against cheap foreign labour.  Are people losing their fucking minds or something?  Unpack time,

But borderline never without.  Are you naive enough to believe the elites "don't want" socialism because "hurrdurr they'd lose their money silly"

1318544472968515587 2020-10-20 21:27:54 +0800 <BackShadys> and our graveyards are rich with giants, men and women whose very souls are the personification of defiance. We have not the right to have become so timid, When for our sake alone our fallen saw no limits. Like us, they knew, that they may never know peace,
1318544471190065158 2020-10-20 21:27:53 +0800 <BackShadys> Where have our brothers and sisters gone? Those who knew the difference, and would stand against wrongs. The fools, the fools, we still have our fenian dead, And the memories of all the blood for years and years my people have bled. We have worked and fought for every inch,
1318544469625634819 2020-10-20 21:27:53 +0800 <BackShadys> You're a racist is what they said. While they laughed in our face and spat on our dead. Their minds are dull, their will is weak, but mine cannot fade until Irelands complete. Centuries of courage now rest firmly on our shoulders,a once raging flame has receded down to smoulders
1318537565746626560 2020-10-20 21:00:27 +0800 <BackShadys> Sometimes it feels like watching the world in slow motion.  Anyone who knows about the idea I had should be shaking their head in disgust right now. Bubble brains tryna wrestle with things bigger than them left us chasing our tail.  Coulda been different.   https://t.co/G3r0kxHbXS

1316126614871252993 2020-10-14 05:20:12 +0800 <BackShadys> If you can't justify your ideas to adults, you're just a lefty intellectual predator targeting children to indoctrinate.  Not on my watch, mate.
1316124367416446979 2020-10-14 05:11:16 +0800 <BackShadys> @zerowield He's Joe Biden's husband, and I'm fine with a president with multiple personalities ü§£
1316123969314074631 2020-10-14 05:09:41 +0800 <BackShadys> Fun idea.  *thinks about planting a rainbow flag at a mosque just to film them tearing it down and prove their tolerance*  Then ask why Catholic schools aren't afforded the same right.  I did mean it when I said no more free ideas for plagiarists. But it's just a brainfart.
1316122648158654468 2020-10-14 05:04:26 +0800 <BackShadys> Which way Irishman?  People who can't defend even their own beliefs.  Or.  People who make the left run from them every single day.  Difficult, to be sure.
1316122126232047617 2020-10-14 05:02:21 +0800 <BackShadys> Only when Islamic schools are forced to do the same.  Sounds fair to me.
1316119441642487809 2020-10-14 04:51:41 +0800 <BackShadys> @paulmurphy_TD Does deficit literally mean nothing to you apes?
1316118845732671489 2020-10-14 04:49:19 +0800 <BackShadys> @LeoVaradkar No it's not, you think there's too many white people in employment.  The government is here for invaders, and on their side. Hear about the Mongolian family faking every document possible? Leo is more concerned for them than for you whitey, wake up.
1316118158374244355 2020-10-14 04:46:35 +0800 <BackShadys> @HMcEntee @DeptJusticeIRL Useful idiots being conned in burying Ireland in debt because you think "eeeee low interest rates on freshly created currency, we're so lucky"  Ever ask why you have to pay interest to people who print money outta thin air? Hell of a business model, how does one get involved?
1316116552278827008 2020-10-14 04:40:12 +0800 <BackShadys> I'm really good at taking a break. Like really good ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÜ
1316115837225500672 2020-10-14 04:37:22 +0800 <BackShadys> The brutality of free housing, free food, pocket money, and gullible white people sending laptops, arranging lifts etc etc.  Tell me, would they get even one of these things back home? No, no they wouldn't.  Bit large to complain about the best deal you've ever had, no?
1316114414832095232 2020-10-14 04:31:43 +0800 <BackShadys> @drlucymichael so you're not gonna school me on equality then? And you can't justify your racist blm slogan on your page?  K, best crawl under a rock Lucy, I'll be here for decades.
1316105888743251969 2020-10-14 03:57:50 +0800 <BackShadys> @MiricaEoo Did he become legal by duping you into marriage or, ya know, the legit way?
1316105097999527938 2020-10-14 03:54:42 +0800 <BackShadys> @MiricaEoo @DMJames5michael So you wouldn't leave with him? Sounds like true love alright...  Why would going to his country be so horrifying, is it a shithole compared to Ireland?
1316104384388923397 2020-10-14 03:51:51 +0800 <BackShadys> @vonderleyen @melindagates Why are black women the only group that needs empowering? Seems kinda sexist and racist if you ask me.  Shouldn't your concern be Europeans? I would have thought so. Go run for office in Africa if you like, you don't seem to like working for Europeans benefit.
1316103180615405568 2020-10-14 03:47:04 +0800 <BackShadys> What's this "we" stuff?  I wonder how we could change the meaning of blackness into something with integrity. Or would that not be my place to discuss ü§î
1316101930381447170 2020-10-14 03:42:06 +0800 <BackShadys> @TBuczkowska Support like what, give us an example?
1316100349732761609 2020-10-14 03:35:49 +0800 <BackShadys> @IrishTimes So what you're saying is we have even more people here now with zero respect for our laws and systems. Rather than do as asked their attitude is fuck you, I'm Irish now?  False Czech passports, other peoples PPS number... are we for real? Send these assholes home. @HMcEntee
1316093454229872640 2020-10-14 03:08:25 +0800 <BackShadys> @Costellop How many of your peers are landlords Patrick? Are you one?
1316093328862085122 2020-10-14 03:07:56 +0800 <BackShadys> @Costellop Putting an end to homelessness requires putting a cap on the ever growing demand facilitated by mass migration.  Are you familiar with supply and demand? See how it works is if you insist on artificially raising the population faster than houses are built, homelessness never ends
1316086428661624834 2020-10-14 02:40:30 +0800 <BackShadys> @nevertoolat8 @erikajayne_ @LindaOkaythen @AbolishDirect @DeptJusticeIRL @rodericogorman Help everyone who's not white of course. In their judgemental eyes whites had their chance, if you're homeless it's on you. But when entire fuckin countries can't get their act together they don't pass the same judgement. We should just source free laptops as quick as possible ü§î
1316076728268345349 2020-10-14 02:01:58 +0800 <BackShadys> @nevertoolat8 @erikajayne_ @LindaOkaythen @AbolishDirect @DeptJusticeIRL @rodericogorman It gets frustrating alright when people who assert their correctness can't articulate or explain why they're correct. It's kinda sad really. They aren't promoting their own beliefs, just indoctrination they've been fed, it's why they'll never have answers.
1316074532990529540 2020-10-14 01:53:14 +0800 <BackShadys> @nevertoolat8 @erikajayne_ @LindaOkaythen @AbolishDirect @DeptJusticeIRL @rodericogorman Yeah there's not a drop of adult logic involved. They just revert to ad hominems and call everyone racist, despite the fact it's clearly them who haven't thought about any of this for more than 5 seconds. We're all due to be canonized later for putting up with this crap üòÜ
1316070900492632065 2020-10-14 01:38:48 +0800 <BackShadys> @erikajayne_ @nevertoolat8 @LindaOkaythen @AbolishDirect @DeptJusticeIRL @rodericogorman You own your home, does that mean you can't welcome guests? Who does Ireland belong to if not the Irish?

1316055717741318145 2020-10-14 00:38:28 +0800 <BackShadys> @SiobhanRice4 Touch√©, I'm sure the aim will be to make the force "more diverse". I can't wait to exercise my right to conduct the conversation in Irish if that's the case.
1316055062494482433 2020-10-14 00:35:52 +0800 <BackShadys> @FineGael How did you manage that while facing a deficit? Seems irresponsible.  Did you ask anyone if they'd like to spend over 5 times more fighting the flu than on general expenditure?  Can we be sure that 8.5billion will stay in Ireland, or are we giving more covid international aid?
1316053100701061121 2020-10-14 00:28:04 +0800 <BackShadys> @dfatirl @Irish_Aid A billion Chinese, Indians, and Africans are laughing in your face while they burn waste or dump it into the sea.  While you useful idiots will continue to drive Irish people broke for something they can't impact whatsoever.  Or will 6m good people cancel out 3billion bad? ü§î
1316050597062344706 2020-10-14 00:18:08 +0800 <BackShadys> And not a cent gone into deporting criminals, leeches, and scam artists.
1316050204773285888 2020-10-14 00:16:34 +0800 <BackShadys> Green economics is when you think you can increase spending despite staring down the barrel of massive deficits.  It's grand sure, just take on more debt while calling ourselves a wealthy country.  #GreenLogic
1316049411970039808 2020-10-14 00:13:25 +0800 <BackShadys> @AAPolicyForum @sandylocks @Kaepernick7 @levelmag Black freedom from who?  Don't you think people are tired of you constantly acting like you're on some crusade when you literally never articulate what you're fighting against?  I've asked Kimberl√©, but she seems quiet as a mouse on the subject. Can you articulate it please?
1316048181369724931 2020-10-14 00:08:32 +0800 <BackShadys> It's gas people think JB has a crystal ball. Let me unpack some simple shit.  When you watch abortion and euthanasia come into practice in several countries before yours, that's an observation, it's information, not a prediction.  Sorry, I know that was your big "we're right"
1316039577379975176 2020-10-13 23:34:20 +0800 <BackShadys> @PeterMoloney14 Aren't the burkean the lads who don't want people protesting? Not sure I'd call that rignt so far. A visit to Cork for the special 98 number says otherwise. But fuck it, just lie to gain votes, that's nothing like what we have already.
1316037318994726912 2020-10-13 23:25:22 +0800 <BackShadys> @DeptHousingIRL @greenparty_ie And all it took for the same people who've always been in power to finally do something was to tell them more Africans are coming.  Dont get your hopes up whitey, these houses are for the poor fragile ones.

1316029364123979777 2020-10-13 22:53:45 +0800 <BackShadys> @drlucymichael Just stay home then. There really aren't many countries at war. Why not advocate for free housing etc etc back home, why burden the Irish with it?
1316028915102765056 2020-10-13 22:51:58 +0800 <BackShadys> Why don't I rattle off "conspiracys", and you debunk them all and make a fool out of me here on twitter, sound fun?  Lets start with, why do you have blm in your bio? Why do you feel the need to do that?

1316025122411569155 2020-10-13 22:36:54 +0800 <BackShadys> @drlucymichael @Turloughmighty Well I see Soros paid yours.  So you're the equality expert helping subvert Irish society by begging in behalf of racists?  Why don't you tell me what equality means to you, expert...
1315797840992636928 2020-10-13 07:33:46 +0800 <BackShadys> @caraaafitz @tea_barrys What's racist about telling a guy born in Nigeria that he's Nigerian, and not Irish?  Pointing out facts is an act of racism now?  Someone needs to take your phone away I reckon. Slandering people online with no basis in reality is pretty childlike behaviour.
1315792547889938434 2020-10-13 07:12:44 +0800 <BackShadys> @DFallamhain I'm honestly dying for her to educate me on equality, dying! üòÜ  I'm sure I'll be on the blocklist with you by tomorrow. Something tells me we're not missing out on much though.
1315791912943616002 2020-10-13 07:10:12 +0800 <BackShadys> @Independent_ie So we can pay for all that new cycling infrastructure. So we can "lower emissions", so we can ship in a million Africans.  Just more paying for our own replacement.  Wonder is that Apple money still on the table... ü§î

1315780872445087751 2020-10-13 06:26:20 +0800 <BackShadys> @drlucymichael Lucy, you're an equality expert? I'd love to chat to you about racist employment quotas to achieve the wrong kind of equality. Why don't you tell my why equality of opportunity is not enough, and experts like you want equal outcomes. Why so obsessed with race?
1315778760743038977 2020-10-13 06:17:57 +0800 <BackShadys> I suppose that's why we don't see any black people begging on the streets.  Not just because the Irish housed them, but because they're too busy working their begging game online. Where simple bitches jump on board thinking they aren't being played like a fiddle.
1315778142179598338 2020-10-13 06:15:29 +0800 <BackShadys> Don't ever let the words "Ireland is racist" or "Ireland doesn't do enough " slip through your lips again.  We look after ungrateful racists better than we look after our own.  What a fuckin star you are Lucy.
1315777095767928833 2020-10-13 06:11:20 +0800 <BackShadys> And yet the homeless are on the streets how long?  All due respect, go fuck yourself. Racist piece of shit.

1315776044423622656 2020-10-13 06:07:09 +0800 <BackShadys> @drlucymichael I could really use a new car and my insurance paid for, so I can get to work and keep affording to live.  Can you help out?
1315770571528056847 2020-10-13 05:45:24 +0800 <BackShadys> @williamhboney1 @ClarNiUigin Why are the homeless on the streets on such a rich country? It's ok, go block n run. Maybe one day you'll stop saying dumb shit you were trained like a dog to say. Buhbye sweety.  https://t.co/uJkjhOyKQa
1315769649443856385 2020-10-13 05:41:44 +0800 <BackShadys> @williamhboney1 @ClarNiUigin Second time for slow coaches, wealthy countries don't face a deficit, have to make budget cuts, and owe hundreds of billions that needs to be paid back. Why are we hanging around, if we're so rich why not pay off the debt?  It's a game to manipulate weaklings like you into debtüòò
1315768915608338437 2020-10-13 05:38:49 +0800 <BackShadys> @williamhboney1 @ClarNiUigin No, being in debt doesn't make you wealthy, fact.  Do wealthy people need to take loans and face deficits?  You're comparing production and output on a scale with other nations. I hope your little graph pays for this recession, bubblebrain.
1315765959458795520 2020-10-13 05:27:05 +0800 <BackShadys> @williamhboney1 @ClarNiUigin Why are we facing a deficit then? You understand the state doesn't own or control all wealth in the country?  Tell me how a country in massive debt and facing a deficit is wealthy, by relativity? With that logic I'm wealthy compared to the homeless. Doesnt make me less broke tho

1315760800456413189 2020-10-13 05:06:35 +0800 <BackShadys> Weird how some things absolutely positively have to be condemned, but some things are known as "support". Weird little puzzle, I'll figure it out with enough time I bet.
1315367344752021512 2020-10-12 03:03:07 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk Yeah, huge hole I'm in, mr planter descendant.
1315357651358932992 2020-10-12 02:24:36 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk Nor you.
1315347926395375616 2020-10-12 01:45:58 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk There will be a border poll, and Ireland Will be united. And we won't be changing anything for you. The north will rejoin the rest of this nation, we will not create a new one, a perfectly good one existed for a long time.
1315339344635408385 2020-10-12 01:11:52 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk If you're gonna rant on avoid presumptions. I said if you don't like it here you can leave, I never said I'd send you home. I just want change my culture for what remains of invading planters. Would you?
1315339019656589312 2020-10-12 01:10:34 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio You're too focused on the modern interpretation of outcome. Equality of opportunity is the reason half the west exists.
1315338810214023169 2020-10-12 01:09:44 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio Lol it's not warm and friendly. If you want your best humsn resources to fail due to financial barriers then I'm not sure how much intellectual prowess that country will develop. I'm not tryna sing kumbaya, I'm tryna ensure society doesnt lose out because it's badly configured.
1315338162466680832 2020-10-12 01:07:10 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio How is it materialistic? It's about allowing the human resources of the nation to be developed to their optimum levels.  And how is merit somehow contradictory to loyalty? These aren't fields in the same conversation really.  Opportunity isn't pathos, if that's the implication.
1315333595943317505 2020-10-12 00:49:01 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk No it's nothing to do with differences. It's about you thinking part of my country belongs to another country. Why is this hard to understand?  Do you think muslims in England should dictate culture and law there?
1315333211770290180 2020-10-12 00:47:30 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk Sure yeah
1315332237987065858 2020-10-12 00:43:37 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio I agree, to me thats interventionism and the state should provide it. The adults choose to live there, children don't. And looking back they might curse growing up with internet etc.  It's why I do believe in study grants etc aswell for high performing but low class students.
1315331635630534657 2020-10-12 00:41:14 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio It doesn't become dysgenic when the system centres on meritocracy.  The point is we're not equal, but we should be in terms of rights and before the law.  And nature won't permit true equality of opportunity, but society should do so as far as is reasonable. Access to tools etc
1315329751591026690 2020-10-12 00:33:45 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio That's not true at all. So ground level example.  You say its ok for wifi companies to ignore rural areas that wont be profitable? I say that creates and inequality of opportunity for online learning and business etc. It's nothing to do with promoting families or not.
1315329216343429122 2020-10-12 00:31:37 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio Create a society where lower class people can still create a business without family wealth if they have the drive and an idea. That's equality of opportunity.
1315329042057515008 2020-10-12 00:30:55 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio You seem fixated on the incorrect presumption that equal opportunity seeks to avoid unequal outcomes, it doesn't.  Level the playing field is too vague to take anything from. And yes wealth with create inequality of opportunity. Thats why we have grants and investors, to try
1315328291709030402 2020-10-12 00:27:57 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio The only way for a natural inequality to be reached is through equal opportunity for children. Would you rather see a genius fail because his original position was worse?  I agree humans aren't equal, that doesn't mean they don't deserve equal opportunity, so we can find out.
1315326670757388289 2020-10-12 00:21:30 +0800 <BackShadys> @NEETLeoDiCaprio What does equality mean to you? I have the feeling you're getting your opinion from the wrong side of the argument. Equality boils down to opportunity versus outcome. Outcome is unnatural and will neved occur. But I can't find logical reasons to dispute opportunity.
1315316000884092928 2020-10-11 23:39:06 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk Do you understand that's why you're here? You're a part of a line of people who were happy to take the opportunity to settle on others land by force, knowing it's aim was to make the native Irish a minority. Now you wanna dictate to us? Really?
1315314666441187328 2020-10-11 23:33:48 +0800 <BackShadys> @whywouldthatbe @john_mcguirk Well given that my line has been here for thousands of years, and yours was artificially planted by force by an enemy trying to breed us out, I reckon me and my people hold priority. What do you reckon?
1315304067808350208 2020-10-11 22:51:41 +0800 <BackShadys> "Unionist" is like an early opposite to "anti-mask". It was a word designed to make them look like the peaceful civilized group. Why would you be against unity? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  What they really meant was, people really eager to hold onto former colonies.
1315303320450457600 2020-10-11 22:48:43 +0800 <BackShadys> @john_mcguirk They are of course welcome to go live in the UK if they don't like it here. I personally won't feel the need to bend over backwards. I'll be fair, but fair means accepting the fact they're here initially uninvited and by force. They don't dictate the rules.
1315302828471209988 2020-10-11 22:46:46 +0800 <BackShadys> @john_mcguirk How we sound to unionists? I'm terrible sorry John, I didn't know being invaded and being the invader were comparable these days. Interesting logic, I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1315300814571831298 2020-10-11 22:38:45 +0800 <BackShadys> @DinnyKelly91 A bit like saying "there's no point quibbling over policy" , then thinking everyone should join you and compromise their policy, even when you don't really have a policy at all beyond feel good statements.
1315293875141931011 2020-10-11 22:11:11 +0800 <BackShadys> Maybe if you want something done right you have to sweep aside the wannabes who can't articulate their "beliefs"(other peoples ideas they cling to uncompromisingly).
1315292845964701699 2020-10-11 22:07:06 +0800 <BackShadys> I can't make my mind up about Europe, so when I come back fully I'll likely either join IFP, or set up my own party.  If people can't see what's bad for Ireland maybe I need to keep highlighting it.  KW is a philosophy professor, that's his position in life. Not a thinker, fact.

In fact through the shouting it's very hard to pay attention considering it's just a regurgitation of where I was at about 5 months ago.  These are actors, playing for votes.

1315292840172417029 2020-10-11 22:07:04 +0800 <BackShadys> *sigh* ffs, I'll point out the obvious again.  Do you think a good way to start an anti-lockdown protest is by mentioning replacement/white genocide? Don't bring 5G signs, just white genocide... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§§  Then Justin gets up pretending he was on board the whole time, LOL.
1314994883405414401 2020-10-11 02:23:06 +0800 <BackShadys> *yawn* no thanks, I don't follow KW fans and thats the 3rd new account you've promoted that has him on the recent retweets. But people are idiots and won't notice... ü§£ü§£
1314846480394579968 2020-10-10 16:33:24 +0800 <BackShadys> And if you can't even tell us how your system works then why the fuck do you reckon we should be listening to you? Sit down mr excessive self love.
1314846140752330753 2020-10-10 16:32:03 +0800 <BackShadys> Final point for a while. Avoid people who talk empty shite like "but blah blah state and business cooperation for the benefit of all". They're useless lefties if all they have is sound good theory.  Give ground level examples or you're either clueless or a sophist.
1314842882260508672 2020-10-10 16:19:06 +0800 <BackShadys> Ps. If philosophy and ideology was never really your strong point let's not act like you've suddenly developed an aptitude out of necessity. If you compare communists and liberals, well, that should speak for itself.
1314842122034573312 2020-10-10 16:16:05 +0800 <BackShadys> Free idea time is over now anyway. I'll drop in here now and then but for the most part I've got things to do that I wonder why I'm letting be slowed down to rant into a void where half are incapable of listening.

Until I find someone who can it's clearly a myth ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. You all seem happy enough to bash Irish people with the accusation but not one of you can show me an example of anything systemic.  Please, help me out here?
1314622247051681793 2020-10-10 01:42:22 +0800 <BackShadys> This about the people of Ireland. If they aren't even awake how are they gonna vote for you?  We need to raise awareness levels, we can kill each other over policy and let the people decide who they want later. For now it's about saving Irish livelihoods. Everything's changed.
1314622245025841152 2020-10-10 01:42:22 +0800 <BackShadys> As far as I'm concerned now a protest is worth three weeks giving the left hell on Twitter. I will support any and every anti-establishment protest I'm available for.  Only when people see a group already formed will they follow. We need to provide that. 1/2  https://t.co/HzjDQzOwxd
1314619176699428865 2020-10-10 01:30:10 +0800 <BackShadys> There's far too much tit for tat bullshit going on lads. At some point we all need to be bigger men for Ireland's sake. Or this will just roll on and on and on, until we're done.
1314616253064118275 2020-10-10 01:18:33 +0800 <BackShadys> @hermannkelly Hermann this is almost exactly why I went at the NP, for essentially telling people not to support protests. I made my views on them clear, but if anyone wants this bullshit to end then consistent protests etc are one of the few routes to applying pressure.

We always have the right to protest, even if weaklings like you want to slur the only aware people in the country.  Go suck on Denis O Briens langer, he's due another fluffing before he tries to fuck Irish people again.
1314611458039336964 2020-10-10 00:59:30 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 100%. Creepy enough that now I don't want any of them having anything to do with anyones children. It's shocking how often our politicians think their opinions are valid, when all it takes it you saying that to demonstrate his views are subjective, in a twisted way no less.

1314592445657747459 2020-10-09 23:43:57 +0800 <BackShadys> @the__dullahan Fuck no. Aside from the fact its not quite time yet I think, we need strong leaders before that happens. Sinn F√©in these days would bend over backwards on the flag, constitution, being "inclusive" to their traditions etc. Not to mention being silent on the debt the UK racked upü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Imagine one of us was a billionaire. Bit more dangerous all of a sudden.  So in summary, Socialists are generally either misled, or lazy, entitled,
1314588784063909889 2020-10-09 23:29:24 +0800 <BackShadys> But the solution to that is not to fuck over the hard working section of society that provides employment for those who want the simple route. You will butcher innovation if you withdraw basic incentive. This is why the elites want it. Like they want participation awards. It wil
1314588782444904453 2020-10-09 23:29:24 +0800 <BackShadys> in the fuck do these entitled shits think they're owed anything? I'm surprised Europeans thought of this idea at all if I'm honest. It suits a different continent far more.  To be clear I'm not disputing that alot of companies are dogs, and pay as little as they can get away with
1314588780972703745 2020-10-09 23:29:23 +0800 <BackShadys> without the shopkeepers expansion there is someone jobless, or forced into taking on far more jobs and skillsets than they'd ever intended. The software graduate doesn't underline any risk or deficit. Didn't reimburse the shopkeeper for previous investments or time spent. So how,
1314588779496247298 2020-10-09 23:29:23 +0800 <BackShadys> they won't have an income or anywhere to apply their chosen skillset without employers. Without employers Every person would have to take the initiative and make themselves sustainable. The shopkeeper could just not hire anyone, keep going as he was, and still make a living. But,
1314588774089846784 2020-10-09 23:29:22 +0800 <BackShadys> The simple fact is a Socialist believes despite the fact you're doing them the favour of handing them employment, they believe they're entitled to be co-owners now. Their reasoning is they say you can't reach your profit ceiling without the help of others, and they're right. But,
1314588772496015360 2020-10-09 23:29:21 +0800 <BackShadys> the shop owner is not entitled to pay them a wage. Despite all his previous work in growing the business and customers, a Socialist believes the shop keeper should now split profits with the hired staff member.  Any system of "needs" is a fantasy that will recreate class systems
1314588770562441217 2020-10-09 23:29:21 +0800 <BackShadys> skillset at. If you have to take the job at the corner store they won't pay you a software developers wages, because you aren't developing software.  So our software graduate takes a summer job at the corner shop.A socialist will tell you employment is exploitation. In their eyes
1314588768888815616 2020-10-09 23:29:21 +0800 <BackShadys> This isn't most peoples cup of tea. They studied and acquired a skill, that's the work they want to do. If they wanted to run a business they'd have studied business. Now without a software company you'll find your degree isn't worth anything without a location to apply your
1314588767186030593 2020-10-09 23:29:20 +0800 <BackShadys> job because of all the previous work and investment you've done. They can only recieve a job by someone doing all this, or them taking the initiative themselves. Your software degree or whatever isn't worth a penny to you unless someone gives you a job, or you create a company.
1314588765134958595 2020-10-09 23:29:20 +0800 <BackShadys> You find distributors. You set yourself up as a legal entity etc. Maybe you advertise a bit. And not least at all, you took the initiative.  Now let's say it's all going well for 6months. So well you now need to take on a staff member. You can only afford to give this person a
1314588763478253569 2020-10-09 23:29:19 +0800 <BackShadys> So let's tell a story for the Socialists. If any of you have a counter argument proving this logic wrong, feel free to step in and tell me where I'm wrong.  So let's imagine you decide to open a corner shop. You seek out a location. You pay the lease. You have work done inside.
1314581244966064129 2020-10-09 22:59:27 +0800 <BackShadys> No no! Don't be silly, of course we don't want the Apple money. And we're still throwing money at NGOs and other countries like this world was a strip club. But just pay up whitey, think of all poor people calling you racist ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1314580010607542277 2020-10-09 22:54:32 +0800 <BackShadys> @Yelp So Netflix the pedophile facilitators are first on the list? Or is racism the only crime and are white people the only ones ever guilty of it?  Are you going to mention all the Irish media that are slandering the whole Irish population as racist? That's kinda racist, no?
1314579660219580418 2020-10-09 22:53:09 +0800 <BackShadys> And I'm sure you'll call out racism from all directions. Or will you just target white people?  Like say, celebs who say only buy from black businesses. Or Netflix?  Whatever a yelp is, boycott these low energy genocide facilitaters.

Is it maybe because outsiders will be more comfortable convincing the elderly they're a burden?  We've seen how outsiders treat them. It inspires a rage that could cover a continent.
1314100442738167808 2020-10-08 15:08:55 +0800 <BackShadys> Right, pretty sure my thoughts are clear at this point. I've had a feeling I didn't like for months, that's been justified in my eyes, and vented. This already tumbled on longer than I wanted, so moving on.

It's very cute, if only I cared enough for it to bother me.  You speak of obligations. Should the homeless or Africans come first in Ireland? Or is the obligation thing just when it suits?

Irish people were oppressed for quite a while, did you miss that in history class?  Children can be influenced to be anything. Ever seen muslim children hilding knives calling for the death of westerners. You saying they're born that way?
1313848197803053057 2020-10-07 22:26:35 +0800 <BackShadys> There's no point singing to each other constantly.

People who had no problem with it initially at this point would be sick of it being rammed down their throat. So it's going as planned. Then they call us homophobic for not wanting gay zebra crossings.
1313603141275967488 2020-10-07 06:12:49 +0800 <BackShadys> @irishexaminer Exactly how many rainbows do people need to be surrounded by before we can consider someone no longer "marginalised"? You're proposing this, so one would imagine you have an idea. One in each town?  What about muslim calls to prayer, to show the local authority backs inclusivity?
1313586677122768902 2020-10-07 05:07:23 +0800 <BackShadys> Anyway I generally don't give a shit, people are entitled to their opinions.

Do you have any intention of tightening immigration, or stopping throwing out Irish citizenship like confetti? Or do you expect Irish taxpayers to house foreigners? I'll wait.

Public reps etc shouldn't be allowed to block unless there's real harassment or threatening behaviour. This is a joke at this point.

1311905827389870080 2020-10-02 13:48:17 +0800 <BackShadys> Hope he's still happy with himself. Him and whoever else was in on it.  You set us back potentially years. Solid stuff bro, real man of the people.
1311904413997584384 2020-10-02 13:42:40 +0800 <BackShadys> Fuck winning though, right? Once we aren't using the term liberal it's ok to be replaced.
1311903763037388802 2020-10-02 13:40:05 +0800 <BackShadys> Glad she's getting some mileage out of it.  And they're reacting to it. Imagine it was being done in a coordinated and controlled way ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  It's cool though, it's all going swimmingly without it...
1311902646299758592 2020-10-02 13:35:39 +0800 <BackShadys> If equality of outcome was organic then we wouldn't need to work so fucking hard to achieve it.  Oh right, the waycism. Every single employer, including the state, is waycist. Sounds reasonable. That's not next level conspiracy theory paranoia at all ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Your employer is not there to hold your hand through valid or invalid beliefs.  Merit is the only thing that should warrant employment.

Joelle acknowledges all beliefs aren't equal, but who gets to decide the validity of beliefs? We decide them for ourselves. That means you as an employee don't get to tell your  boss
1311894134152667142 2020-10-02 13:01:50 +0800 <BackShadys> primarily through diversity of demographics. Because apparently there's proof that the two do not coincide. Proving again that Joelle's real concern is identity based equity.  Also, it's not a company's responsibility to fly your social justice flag. It's a job, you're being paid
1311894132554637324 2020-10-02 13:01:49 +0800 <BackShadys> It seems like with equal opportunity, if we focus on diversity of thought apparently there's a wealth of research that shows it will backfire, not least of all for those from "marginalised backrounds".  If you ask me that kinda proves that you don't obtain diversity of thought
1311893254603001858 2020-10-02 12:58:20 +0800 <BackShadys> diversity, and equality of outcome.  Second smaller thread to follow.
1311893253038505985 2020-10-02 12:58:19 +0800 <BackShadys> or a black man will better represent demographic diversity, without having any guarantee whatsoever of achieving diversity of ideas.  It's very disingenuous to shape this as diversity of thought or diversity of backround when the truth is the chief concern is identity based
1311893251385942019 2020-10-02 12:58:19 +0800 <BackShadys> diversity, all of a sudden we can't move forward without it?  No. It seems certain groups can't move forward without it. But diversity in white countries benefits everyone But straight white men. As they find themselves overlooked because maybe a woman, or transexual,or bisexual,
1311893249838243843 2020-10-02 12:58:19 +0800 <BackShadys> thought. It's also wildly presumptuous to say that people from different backrounds can't possibly have had the same experiences, or share a similar outlook or ideas.  Being honest, it's just a bunch of statements that don't add up at all.  Humanity came all this way without
1311893248097562629 2020-10-02 12:58:18 +0800 <BackShadys> This can go on and on, but the truth is it's just an attempt to rationalize equity and employment quotas.  I'd bet Joelle would be happy enough to see positive discrimination used to achieve this "diversity of demographics", wrongly believing it would guarantee diversity of
1311893246562504704 2020-10-02 12:58:18 +0800 <BackShadys> but it won't be because he was gay. It won't even be because of his experiences. It will be because of who he is as an individual. Many people share experiences, we don't all come out the other end the same. Some grow wiser, some more disillusioned. Some get broken, some stronger
1311893244956082176 2020-10-02 12:58:18 +0800 <BackShadys> thinker and replace him or her with a member of their demographic group. See if you can replicate the results.  To assume a gay man has had different experiences which will allow him to perform in a different way to me is just wishful thinking. That man may be able to do it,
1311893243303518208 2020-10-02 12:58:17 +0800 <BackShadys> actually attributed to diversity. Swap out your current diverse team for another one, see if you still get groundbreaking ideas. Any success diversity tries to claim is in reality attributed to individuals. If I'm wrong then fire your best "diverse"
1311893241718099973 2020-10-02 12:58:17 +0800 <BackShadys> wants identity based diversity and equity. Not really different ideas, just different looking people, in the hopes they have different ideas.  Honestly there's not a shred of logic supporting this. There is nothing to prove that companies doing well due to diversity is
1311893240132624384 2020-10-02 12:58:16 +0800 <BackShadys> to process information differently, or to have "different experiences".  This isn't about diversity of thought, just diversity. She states so herself. Apparently a colourblind approach won't suffice because it might miss demographic diversity. Highlighting that really she just
1311893238270300160 2020-10-02 12:58:16 +0800 <BackShadys> well Asians have different ideas, that's why we brought you in, to capitalize on your difference. Now dance! Give us original perspectives now!  Imagine this guy just wants to work, and not have his difference pointed out constantly as if it innately granted him the ability
1311893236554883072 2020-10-02 12:58:16 +0800 <BackShadys> equality of outcome.  I discussed this two years ago. This approach will "other" people moreso than anything else. Via the pressure asserted on individuals to live up to their demographic difference and deliver on new ideas.  Imagine being Asian, and being hired because
1311893234554155009 2020-10-02 12:58:15 +0800 <BackShadys> more differing ideas than any other two people at the company. Welcome to individualism.  Why was it two white men who invented AC and DC? Why not AC in Europe and then some Asian or African doing DC? Because the premise is false to begin with. It's just more sophistry to justify
1311893233039966209 2020-10-02 12:58:15 +0800 <BackShadys> that because you've got some Brazilians on your team you'll get some new ideas that companies without Brazilians can't achieve, is attributing far too much importance to their group identity over their individual attributes.  Two white men from the same neighbourhood can have
1311893231026745344 2020-10-02 12:58:14 +0800 <BackShadys> wouldn't have come from one group of people, European men.  To assume a broke person thinks differently to a wealthy person is a pretty narrow minded class approach to intellect. To assume other races think differently innately could be deemed somewhat racist really. To assume
1311893229273583617 2020-10-02 12:58:14 +0800 <BackShadys> Unfortunately this is just a warm and fuzzy presumption, and no surprise it's coming from a DEI advocate.  It's a presumptuous outlook assuming that diversity of thought is primarily found in varying backrounds. If that were true all the major philosophies &amp; economic models 1/16

1311440580908593158 2020-10-01 06:59:34 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn Yeah I had heard of that one alright, figured it's prob pretty clean if her names attached to it. Apparently abortions come in with the idea of the feminine power to create and destroy life, really dark shit.
1311423295359717376 2020-10-01 05:50:53 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn That's actually what set me looking. Rumour mill says she's written witchcraft books under a pen name. I wanted to try find something to get rid of her in case she was re-elected. No joy though in the end, and thank fuck she's out of Ireland now.
1311413695382253568 2020-10-01 05:12:44 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn This reminds me of when I heard that certain witch covens can't be joined unless you've had an abortion. As you say they believe so much we don't know about. God knows wtf witches think they're doing with ritual abortion magic or some shit.

And trust me, I despise pedophilia, I'm just wary of setting precedents that years later someone can say, well we execute pedos, why not rapists? And then where does it end.

1311402088946176000 2020-10-01 04:26:37 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn I agree, but when we start talking about "heinous" crimes, one definition of which is hateful, it starts to feel way too ambiguous, and comparable to hate crimes.  Pretty sure the articles been edited too. I remember first time I read it thinking jesus,   https://t.co/uix7rsEsDG

1311399991861280771 2020-10-01 04:18:17 +0800 <BackShadys> @dreddiknight Because you don't understand that subjective feelings and reactions have never been considered empirical?  Ingrained messaging like what? White people in tv in white countries? Seems you're the one obsessed with race.

1311399278108184576 2020-10-01 04:15:27 +0800 <BackShadys> @dreddiknight A system is inanimate, it doesn't display bias unless expressed specifically through policy.  Now, if you're saying there are racist judges etc that's a different conversation. But what you're claiming has no evidence in the modern world.  Again,you presume equal criminal records
1311398502510080000 2020-10-01 04:12:22 +0800 <BackShadys> @rocheburn I almost agree. We're men, our first instinct to shit like that is "kill that fucker", but most people calm down and realise that the death penalty is a huge decision. Not put out an article claiming you won't stop at pedos ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Everyone is someones family member end of the day.
1311397553171312640 2020-10-01 04:08:35 +0800 <BackShadys> @dreddiknight Anything from today?  Redlining is economic, not racial. Do you want to set up a business and invest in violent, crime ridden areas? I wouldn't.
1311397333662392320 2020-10-01 04:07:43 +0800 <BackShadys> @dreddiknight Also that was based on segregation. Anything relevant to todays society?
1311396993936306177 2020-10-01 04:06:22 +0800 <BackShadys> @dreddiknight Are you saying I'm responsible for peoples level of self confidence? That white majority countries shouldn't have white models and actors etc? Sounds like a problem for black people if I'm honest.  "Of all colours" no, most people laugh at the doll test. Again, how is this proof?
1311394842661072897 2020-10-01 03:57:49 +0800 <BackShadys> @dreddiknight And I've no problem with black people as long as they aren't tryna imply I'm inherently racist and so is my country.  If I kept lying about you, you'd prob get pissed off too I'd say.
1311394521511493633 2020-10-01 03:56:33 +0800 <BackShadys> @dreddiknight Why don't yoi point out the racist laws or policy then? Just do it.  Sentencing is decided on previous criminal record etc. Comparing figures like it's that simple is intellectually disingenuous.  The laws don't mention race. Hence "systemic racism" is a laughable concept.

1311370694119301120 2020-10-01 02:21:52 +0800 <BackShadys> Based on the fact they've really accomplished nothing but giving us a bad name, and refuse to condemn their fanatical godshites who certainly do not represent us. I would advise everyone to be careful of this group.

1311363404020559872 2020-10-01 01:52:54 +0800 <BackShadys> It's absolutely comical to me that critical race theorists spent decades cooking up this bullshit, and all that was needed was a simple sentence or two to make them turn silent.  Weak sauce.

It works backwards from unequal outcomes asserting that it must be proof of systemic problems, despite there being none that are observable in a racially nuetral legal system. It's a vehicle for equality of outcome

I'm getting close to demanding he proves his IQ too or stfu mentioning it. I'm suspicious it's just another area he'd have his ass handed to himü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

1308394117836214275 2020-09-22 21:14:01 +0800 <BackShadys> @AnonLeoDiCaprio I just wonder sometimes why I ever gave him a break, it didn't work out as intended ü§£. Thought he might come outta the edgy tween stage but apparently he's just marching forward with ideas he can't defend. That's common practice for the highly intelligent like him thoughü§îüòÜ
1308391078421295111 2020-09-22 21:01:56 +0800 <BackShadys> @Turloughmighty Just the usual still babbling outta him about democracy etc cause his fucking special IQ can't sperg out about anything else it seems. I'm just tired of a coward who's only defence is, I'll just stay silent and hope he goes away. He needs to shut up with ideas he cant defend.
1308390506897047552 2020-09-22 20:59:40 +0800 <BackShadys> @AnonLeoDiCaprio You mean Spencer etc or? I'm just tired of him talking out his arsehole, he's a genuine child brain fuck. Democracy this, capitalism that, etc. He should really just shut the fuck up or learn to put on his big boy pants and defend his arguments. He's a shill far as I'm concerned.
1308388687617708032 2020-09-22 20:52:26 +0800 <BackShadys> It's very weird to me, the people who wanna be silent now about spergball Keith Woods. He's an arrogant little defenceless fucking moron.

1306702530504781834 2020-09-18 05:12:15 +0800 <BackShadys> Funny that everyone's targeted.  No we gotta distance from Gemma cause optics.  No we gotta distance from Niall cause contacts.  No Yellow Vests are suspect, gotta distance ourselves.  Basically, just come to ours and let us lead you. Small print, we're suspect as fuck.
1306697463768797185 2020-09-18 04:52:07 +0800 <BackShadys> @hkhanirl @rtenews Like the homeless Hassan? Or should we step over their bodies on the street and help people from other countries that aren't helping themselves? Why is it Ireland should do more but not the nations people have to run from because they're so bad. How's that our responsibility?

I could go on and on.  Why is it you reckon yours matter more?

1306303897833820167 2020-09-17 02:48:13 +0800 <BackShadys> @Helen_Something @IzzyKamikaze Well if you mean do most of us believe in national Socialism, eugenics, oppression of opposition etc, or are we british, the answer is no on both counts.
1306302083130421250 2020-09-17 02:41:01 +0800 <BackShadys> @Helen_Something @IzzyKamikaze You probably pull it off though üòÅ  Would you post pictures of bullets to people you disagree with? Would you constantly incite violence against people? Would you follow people's every protest to agitate and demonize them?
1306301437224333312 2020-09-17 02:38:27 +0800 <BackShadys> @IzzyKamikaze So that's a no?
1306296249994350596 2020-09-17 02:17:50 +0800 <BackShadys> @IzzyKamikaze I agree, but I'm pretty sure nobody hit you because of how you look. Being honest I don't think anyone hit you at all, you were pushed and used the opportunity to hit the deck and burst the fake blood pack you took from your pocket.  Did anyone else get hurt? Anyone?

1306292714577842177 2020-09-17 02:03:47 +0800 <BackShadys> @ghostflaneur So posting pics of bullets before a protest is just fine? That's her crew, not mine. They never stop inciting violence against anyone they deem "the fash". Despite "the fash" being the only ones supporting free speech. Riddle me that ü§î
1306290549108998145 2020-09-17 01:55:11 +0800 <BackShadys> @IzzyKamikaze You turned up looking like an SS officer wandering towards the crowd. It's an unusual sight. I wouldn't want you near me, and I'd tell you as much. You look unhinged and could have a machete under your coat for all I know, especially given your constant motto of bashing "fash"
1306289122156466181 2020-09-17 01:49:31 +0800 <BackShadys> @IzzyKamikaze I'm not supposed to presume though, right? Maybe you like Xer or something.

1306287102292787201 2020-09-17 01:41:29 +0800 <BackShadys> @IzzyKamikaze If you keep advancing towards peaceful crowds after threatening them online and they finally defend themselves and their right to protest, maybe you can find a way to make them look bad ü§î maybe a joke shop has something that could help with that ü§î

Is it possible you're openly connected to people who threaten violence regularly to anyone you deem "the fash". Do you think pictures of bullets being posted before a protest inspire peace? Grow up.
1306284350825263107 2020-09-17 01:30:33 +0800 <BackShadys> @tweetymonkey @riainetwork You've misspelled "because I do nothing but post tweets designed to incite racial tension, when really I should just be glad I'm here or piss off back home"  You say you care about racism.

Being an incompetent mess should not be inflicted on other people while you demand further infrastructure and make yourself out to be the victim.
1306272759408926722 2020-09-17 00:44:29 +0800 <BackShadys> Thing about lightning is it basically never strikes twice. I believe we were handed the perfect weapon, and people couldn't see that. Serendipity doesn't come knocking often though. I spoke before about how we won't have endless opportunities. We ignored one of our best ones.
1306268741714546692 2020-09-17 00:28:31 +0800 <BackShadys> When the truth is I've seen no answers from anyone that warrant being so sure of themselves. We're all on here spitting the same rhetoric, but some of us think we should follow the other. I'll follow someone who can fix all this. Nobody's shown me that though.

But it seems there's no point talking about this issue. I've mentioned before that we have great resources that aren't being maximized, but we've got too much ego going on.
1306268737855803393 2020-09-17 00:28:31 +0800 <BackShadys> some people will of course think it's all coincidence that strategies have changed, I don't do coincidence.

And actually yes, your ability to help extends no further than your economic capacity to do so. Is there an economist in the world who thinks you can keep spending more than you take?
1305894935472803841 2020-09-15 23:43:09 +0800 <BackShadys> @thomasbrunkard @WhitmoreJen Who said stop all spending? Just foreign aid, NGO rackets to the cost of over 5billion a year, benefit surfers and tighten migration. Or did you think a housing crisis would be solved while continually adding demand?
1305891862272782336 2020-09-15 23:30:56 +0800 <BackShadys> @pmurnion @WhitmoreJen Have you heard of any of the homeless dying lately? Why is it we owe resources to people not born here before people born here, it confuses me?
1305890868075823105 2020-09-15 23:26:59 +0800 <BackShadys> @thomasbrunkard @WhitmoreJen I don't think the Irish who saw signs saying "no Irish" felt sheltered. Did they get welfare or pay their own way?  Since when is being massively in debt wealthy?   Any NGOs who constantly agitate normal people rather than point out the problem, perpetually failing countries.
1305889455035817990 2020-09-15 23:21:22 +0800 <BackShadys> @thomasbrunkard @WhitmoreJen Why are you ashamed of the problems in other countries, did you cause them?  Do you think your willingness should sentence millions of people to pay for other peoples problems, at your discretion? Seems entitled.  Should all these NGOs maybe call for their country to sort itself?
1305886638447484934 2020-09-15 23:10:11 +0800 <BackShadys> @thomasbrunkard @WhitmoreJen So with a budget deficit and the country still not back up and running, tell me how we can solve everyones problems at once? Just bury the Irish taxpayer in even more debt? Nice of you.
1305879107025211393 2020-09-15 22:40:15 +0800 <BackShadys> @WhitmoreJen We're a bit busy taking our homelessness, budget deficit, and arbitrary tyranny seriously. Other countries will just have to deal with their problems while we deal with ours.  That actually sounds really fair doesnt it? Almost like equality. Or who's helping our homeless,Nigeria?
1305876449900068867 2020-09-15 22:29:42 +0800 <BackShadys> @NewstalkFM @PatKennyNT Same with migrants with aids etc? We should all wear masks but we don't health screen migrants from countries with high aids numbers etc?  Are we really just pretending to protect the population? For the sake of further arbitrary tyranny over music volume and food prices.

1305200425520574466 2020-09-14 01:43:25 +0800 <BackShadys> Do you honestly think the edgy pseudo intellectuals can restrain their ego from overstepping if they ever actually have power? We already know the libertarian types prob don't have the balls to pull the trigger at all, but let's not fall at the feet of unproven people yet,
1305200424006361089 2020-09-14 01:43:25 +0800 <BackShadys> on by now is that any future policies need to be crafted at a far higher level than ever before. We're fully immersed in sophistry and deception enough right now to know that we have to be very careful what precedents we set, because we don't know who's coming after us.  Now ask,
1305200422316134400 2020-09-14 01:43:24 +0800 <BackShadys> a final policy. I just wanted to highlight that people can believe in the same concepts, and potentially achieve the same results, but achieved through very different means, and with very different wider implications or potential for misuse.  I think one thing we can all agree
1305200420722298880 2020-09-14 01:43:24 +0800 <BackShadys> consolidation of market shares or number of owners in each industry or sector, to determine their potential ability for price signalling, while maybe being measured relative to inflation in general and relative to the minimum wage.  Anyway, I didn't start this thread saying I had
1305200418776125445 2020-09-14 01:43:23 +0800 <BackShadys> they could easily fall outside these parameters without ever ripping off the public, and their product still being great value for money, but having a huge profit to cost ratio due to innovative production.  So really it's probably more about monitoring and regulating the
1305200417157058566 2020-09-14 01:43:23 +0800 <BackShadys> market sector exceeds these parameters the state can now intervene. But not only is that starting to sound a little like communism again, it also wouldn't allow for circumstantial situations. There might be a business using automation and producing their product so cheap that
1305200415328415744 2020-09-14 01:43:23 +0800 <BackShadys> it should then withdraw, if that market sector returns to what we might deem fair, and is no longer exploitative of the population.  And there probably isn't a one size fits all here. It might be easy enough to say we could set cost to profit ratios, and say that if/when a
1305200413763829763 2020-09-14 01:43:22 +0800 <BackShadys> but that seems like the rhetorical path to both intervene, and leave everybody's rights intact, while also not having handed the state new and dangerous powers.  The only question to me becomes when is it permissible for the state to intervene in a market sector, and when or if
1305200412094615558 2020-09-14 01:43:22 +0800 <BackShadys> allows for profit, but not greed. And the insurance companies would have a simple choice. Return to a reasonable price, in order to compete with the state, or go out of business when the population inevitably flocks to the cheaper option.  Maybe it's just me,
1305200410504949760 2020-09-14 01:43:21 +0800 <BackShadys> My answer would be to have the state play the role that is currently lacking, which is genuine free market competition. I wouldn't touch the insurance companies, but I'd set up a state owned one and cut the legs from under them with competition. I'd set a fair price that still
1305200408978219009 2020-09-14 01:43:21 +0800 <BackShadys> the 2nd being that the state has the right to seize property at it's discretion.  Both sound like communism to me if we were to allow those measures to become part of the states mandate. Even situations that clearly should be dealt with require foresight on potential implications
1305200406130241539 2020-09-14 01:43:20 +0800 <BackShadys> Option 2 is to seize the insurance companies, or force their closure and replace them with a state company.  To cut to the chase I don't like either of these options. Both set precedents we shouldn't want. 1 being that the state has the right to set the price for a company,
1305200404351811587 2020-09-14 01:43:20 +0800 <BackShadys> The first two options are bad options imo, and an incorrect application which set precedents we would be best off avoiding.  Option 1 is for the state to legally cap premium prices, in a way that will still assess and account for risk, so still allowing varying risk categories.
1305200402313474049 2020-09-14 01:43:20 +0800 <BackShadys> insurance companies cornering a market where they were handed a legally necessary business model which they then began using to turn the screws on the population. This is a prime example of a situation that warrants intervention from the state on behalf of the citizen.  So,
1305200400623112192 2020-09-14 01:43:19 +0800 <BackShadys> it's pretty clear to anyone who looked into this issue over the last decade or so that there's massive price signalling going on. Premiums continued to rise while the cost of claims fell. Car insurance being a product you are legally obliged to have in order to drive, this led to
1305200398949588992 2020-09-14 01:43:19 +0800 <BackShadys> that you'll ever find myself and Keith Woods overlapping ideologically on is Interventionism. So let's look at a present day example and the different interpretations or actions that could be taken in the name of interventionism.  So take car insurance,

1303768178061914113 2020-09-10 02:52:11 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 He's a fuckin wet nappy that fella ü§£ imagine having limited speaking times and that's your message, with everything that's going on.
1303766990230818817 2020-09-10 02:47:27 +0800 <BackShadys> @tazgallin @nealerichmond They're all hiding the fact that they're just script readers who can't actually defend or justify most of the things they push for. That's what they're hiding imo. Same with the likes of Ebun, she'll be kept on a pedestal because any questioning at all will ruin her completely.
1303764269733994503 2020-09-10 02:36:39 +0800 <BackShadys> @tazgallin @nealerichmond I'm not sure how I'm not üòÜ seems most of them got me. I'm left with people I'd never previously heard of, but sure we work with what we have ü§™
1303763459767762951 2020-09-10 02:33:26 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 @nealerichmond The gas thing is they're this bad With advisers. Imagine what a shitshow this could be without a handful of nameless faceless advisers. Or apparently they're all rotten at the job too. Money well spent we can all agree ü§îüòÜ
1303762023289958401 2020-09-10 02:27:43 +0800 <BackShadys> @sheilacoyle2 They aren't sharing skills, they're being taught skills to try to make them somewhat employable. Did you miss the guy saying at first he was terrible at woodwork but now he's good at it? He was taught.  I'd much rather see them taught at home, their countries need the skills etc.
1303758930330386433 2020-09-10 02:15:26 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 @nealerichmond Seems like honesty is in as short a supply as intellect too. But again he's one of the more real people. With most these politicians you really get the impression you're not dealing with someone who has any concern for being genuine, just PC etc.
1303757998687490050 2020-09-10 02:11:44 +0800 <BackShadys> Yeah... guess I better hide inside in fear so.
1303752881162551296 2020-09-10 01:51:24 +0800 <BackShadys> @nealerichmond Neale I'm guessing given that you're advocating for "hate crime" and "hate speech" laws that you've thought this through to the extent that you can articulate why this article is incorrect, and why we should push forward with divisive identity politics?   https://t.co/F6TFa2kE4J
1303751086952665089 2020-09-10 01:44:16 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 @nealerichmond Yeah it's genuinely stunning at times how we've managed to gather everyone who shouldn't be near government, into our government. There's really not one of them worth taking serious intellectually. Which is surreal.
1303749595068092416 2020-09-10 01:38:20 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 @nealerichmond That's a really good question ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1303748750104461317 2020-09-10 01:34:59 +0800 <BackShadys> One of the millions of people in Ireland hoping to go to college, get a job, or own a home?  Paul says fuck you, we're opening our gates to the world while we stay living under genuinely remedial regulations.  Paul's just a virtue poser really.
1303747668259360769 2020-09-10 01:30:41 +0800 <BackShadys> @nealerichmond describes how Ebun Josephs labelling and inciting of hatred in public against people she's never met is something Irish people with no avenue for rebuttal should not have to deal with.  Or are these laws just for punishing white people?
1303710906933817345 2020-09-09 23:04:36 +0800 <BackShadys> @JamesCABrady True, but something being "legal" doesn't mean we have to submit to it. Things that should never have happened will be turned around, one way or the other. The same way we could say we're legally obliged to pay a household charge, but it's not right,&amp; one of many that'll be fixed
1303424956659888128 2020-09-09 04:08:20 +0800 <BackShadys> way to force them to react. Either by making their jobs more uncomfortable, or by putting ourselves in positions where we can no longer be ignored.  Consistency with protests will create pressure and awareness by itself, but we should be searching for the next level, just in case
1303424954684379137 2020-09-09 04:08:20 +0800 <BackShadys> with signs saying something like "Irelands NGO funding strategy".  Basically I'm saying there's no reason why our activism can't evolve. Others have rightly pointed out that contacting offices and local councillors etc en masse is a good pressure tactic too. But we need to find a
1303424952721342466 2020-09-09 04:08:19 +0800 <BackShadys> maybe disrupting saturday retail or travel will make them sit up and take notice.  Maybe a crowd protesting at golfgate or their other upcoming events would be ideal.  Maybe we need creative demonstrations. Print up a bunch of fake money and make it rain outside the D√°il,
1303424950708117510 2020-09-09 04:08:19 +0800 <BackShadys> If they refuse to budge at all there are ways we can disrupt everything in this country. It's a case of starting soft, legal, and productively disruptive. Not the kind of disruption that only worsens a reputation. Stopping average people making it to work won't help, but,
1303424948925599745 2020-09-09 04:08:18 +0800 <BackShadys> If the last protest happened on Grafton/Henry St it would have shut it down on a Saturday. Maybe that's perfect. Maybe until this hits somebody's pockets or there's 60k people in the streets nothing will happen.  We need to find ways to exert pressure, a necessary evil.
1303424947390382092 2020-09-09 04:08:18 +0800 <BackShadys> What if this kind of protesting is like shooting British soldiers up north? And they won't care until we hit the financial centre.  Maybe it's time we found far more disruptive locations for our protests. Bring to bear the weight of others concerns. For example,
1303364922978570240 2020-09-09 00:09:47 +0800 <BackShadys> @JamesCABrady We do. If everyone in Ireland died 2moro, nobody else actually has a claim to it, nations might kill each other over it, so it's collectively ours. The state has no ownership or right to do things like this, they're just managers. Ireland belongs to her people who've inhabited it
1303361774046113798 2020-09-08 23:57:16 +0800 <BackShadys> Would you be willing to ensure that our country will not be carved up and sold to the highest bidder, by any means necessary?
1303361771193937920 2020-09-08 23:57:16 +0800 <BackShadys> If they sell off a piece of our country for some "autonomous city" would you be willing to protest at the site and halt construction?  Second poll below.
1303351949002240000 2020-09-08 23:18:14 +0800 <BackShadys> Welcome to Ireland, yeah üòò
1302999344120057866 2020-09-07 23:57:06 +0800 <BackShadys> How diverse...
1302992311664685056 2020-09-07 23:29:10 +0800 <BackShadys> All they want is attention amd power. People who want change don't ostracize others who want change.  Unless your change isn't the same change sane people want, in which case you should keep your shit pretty quiet and at a distance ü§î
1302992309882097664 2020-09-07 23:29:09 +0800 <BackShadys> If you're all about "we need more women, so lets try push more into the spotlight". You guessed it, you're a lefty on the right.  If you only agree, like, or retweet your little crew, yep, you're probably a lefty on the right.  We got alot of people pretending they care,
1302988671667363840 2020-09-07 23:14:42 +0800 <BackShadys> If your only answer is to take away rights to secure the economy, you're basically a leftist on the right.  If GDP is more important than freedom, you're basically a leftist on the right.  If this is the only path you can see, you're a bit of a fucking eejit aren't you ü§£
1302295630006677504 2020-09-06 01:20:48 +0800 <BackShadys> @JamilSmith Systemic racism? Do you have anything to go on other than an inequality of outcomes and policies from the past?  Do you think equality of outcome achieved through a Marxist identity politics system of needs to achieve this outcome is a natural state for humanity?
1302288123028799488 2020-09-06 00:50:58 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 Ah of course, the protective screen separating people. I don't know how I missed that. That kind of advice has to be straight outta the Sinn F√©in handbook.
1302286090292924416 2020-09-06 00:42:53 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 And for heavens sake wear a mask! The term safe sex is evolving, we gotta get everyone up to speed üòÑ
1302284342912315394 2020-09-06 00:35:57 +0800 <BackShadys> @JRD0000 ü§£ exactly, no need to waste time teaching people about finances etc. How did we ever get this far without degenerates trying to encourage this shit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  I wonder if it's a good idea to force young gay boys to try sex with girls too, just so they understand and don't judge ü§î
1302281641856040962 2020-09-06 00:25:13 +0800 <BackShadys> Between the lockdown, gender transitions for kids, and the aggressive Sex-Ed(grooming) syllabus being pushed everywhere we should have all the ammunition we need.  If people aren't against this below then they clearly have no moral compass.
1302280052755886081 2020-09-06 00:18:54 +0800 <BackShadys> Feels like we're only a few months away from the left posting pics of people followed by, "This person looked at me in a horrible way today. I could feel them judging and despising me, I just know it was racism, I shouldn't have to live like this!"
1302277430489624576 2020-09-06 00:08:29 +0800 <BackShadys> By crimes of course I mean hurty words, because that's what we've become apparently. Little weaklings who have their lives ruined by passing comments made by strangers.  Where are all the fucking adults?
1302276685002350593 2020-09-06 00:05:31 +0800 <BackShadys> Little boy cries for attention and hate speech laws on social media. Despite the fact every adult knows you either call them, or drop in. You don't tweet to report crimes unless you're an establishment shill tryna generate consent for taking away my free speech.  Good luck kiddo.
1302275887593926656 2020-09-06 00:02:21 +0800 <BackShadys> @dmajor7ths @GardaTraffic Lol, you both sound softer than puppy shit.  You're actually tryna rat to the garda over words? Does your wife know she married a little boy?
1301918642926387200 2020-09-05 00:22:47 +0800 <BackShadys> One very interesting observation is to notice that of the three content creators associated with one of the parties, not one of them have been vocally anti lockdown.  Are thet just slow or?
1301565718559948801 2020-09-04 01:00:23 +0800 <BackShadys> Think that's me done preaching for the day  https://t.co/Wl1P8wMPgh
1301565243252969474 2020-09-04 00:58:30 +0800 <BackShadys> If reasonable people can't arrive at logical conclusions together then we're well and truly fucked. And if you're an ideologue then you're already a CD in a world of digital music, outdated. And in the decades of preparation and playing mental chess they've already beaten you.
1301565241629835265 2020-09-04 00:58:30 +0800 <BackShadys> A little coordination, and a little bit of discussion where egos are left at the door, will evolve our effectiveness in trying to fight back. I doubt all the Republicans throughout the years told each other "I'm grand! I have my own strategies I'm using, you do your thing".
1301565240119787520 2020-09-04 00:58:29 +0800 <BackShadys> Unfortunately some of us are trying to fight WW3 using WW1 tactics, and it's a whole lot of rowing for very little movement.  We will adapt, or we'll lose. It's our generations that do it or it doesn't get done.
1301565238483935232 2020-09-04 00:58:29 +0800 <BackShadys> If people are going to put in work it should at least be aimed in a direction that has serious potential. The ripple effects of the population finding out that nobody in the D√°il would resist state sponsored grooming will damage confidence for a lifetime.
1301565236722446338 2020-09-04 00:58:29 +0800 <BackShadys> Anyone who tries to back peddle is just doubling down on how guilty and disingenuous they look.  Our enemy is playing the long game. We aren't going to win by playing a bunch of short games, and aiming for instant gratification that could prove to be borderline futile.  I think,
1301565235296337920 2020-09-04 00:58:28 +0800 <BackShadys> Targeting a program can create a domino effect. If the program is destroyed in the eyes of the public then guilt by association will kick in. Anyone who supported or pushed that program now have their motives and intention in question too.
1301544203550416896 2020-09-03 23:34:54 +0800 <BackShadys> @WSMIreland You're liars, stop trying to suppress peoples right to peacefully protest. If you keep trying to intimidate people out of their human rights don't be surprised when a few decide to go psycho and show you what deep water you're in.  Stay away from our peaceful gatherings, freaks
1301542295356014594 2020-09-03 23:27:19 +0800 <BackShadys> would be far more productive and create pushback in a direction that might actually achieve something longterm, and spare children some abuse, rather than watch it get pushed through by the next person we've no dirt on.  Might aswell be talking to the wall with some people.
1301542293430775809 2020-09-03 23:27:18 +0800 <BackShadys> Targeting puppets will achieve virtually nothing. They want you to do that. They put puppets out there to take the fall so programs stay intact, while you think you've achieved something.  Targeting sex-ed would be far more productive and far more logical. Raising awareness of it
1301542291228766213 2020-09-03 23:27:18 +0800 <BackShadys> Collapse the government, for what? So they can let months go by on another caretaker government, telling us an election might cause a spike and put people at risk? Only to likely end up with a very similar government anyway.  I said it before, and I'll say it again,
1301542289798504449 2020-09-03 23:27:18 +0800 <BackShadys> I wonder if Roderic gets the boot will people then realize it accomplished nothing but depriving one posh boy of his salary.  Sex-Ed and Gender transitions will just be pushed forward by someone else, we're trying to hit them exactly where they want to be hit.  What's the goal?
1301188927940964352 2020-09-03 00:03:09 +0800 <BackShadys> Creating self-regulation in society. I'm so glad we're moving passed that pesky notion of individual autonomy, and into a great system built around collectivism that's so much better, and not open to manipulation at all... ü§î   https://t.co/dOOMAo8cNb
