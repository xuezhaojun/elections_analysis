1344060022406451200 2020-12-30 07:17:35 +0800 <mjboroski> Society stays in the dark until people realize that risk is just a part of life and learn to do their own research and do it well.
1344055730689683456 2020-12-30 07:00:32 +0800 <mjboroski> When you have what you need to live comfortably, novelty becomes the most valuable thing to most individuals.
1344030031312531457 2020-12-30 05:18:24 +0800 <mjboroski> @JasonBermas @LibertyHowl We've always been an automation nation, we find new ways to apply ourselves. Machines don't kill jobs, they evolve them bc the market is based on adding value for others.
1344024486048395271 2020-12-30 04:56:22 +0800 <mjboroski> A lot of self-proclaimed democratic socialists are actually democratic capitalists who just get really inspired by buzzwords.
1343974303835021315 2020-12-30 01:36:58 +0800 <mjboroski> @counselorcurtis I agree, but your words are more nuanced than mine were.
1343974082346409985 2020-12-30 01:36:05 +0800 <mjboroski> @tom_hynes Thanks to the Fed's continuous devaluation and blatant overuse of emergency measures, the amplitude of the market swings can only get larger. Self-sufficiency and local barter becomes the wise hedge. Small scale fabrication and food overproduction are always valuable.
1343971075252744193 2020-12-30 01:24:08 +0800 <mjboroski> @counselorcurtis But what if the governor excludes some businesses and allows others? Covid is twisting the market to favor the lowest possible overhead, not the best value product.
1343969627131490306 2020-12-30 01:18:23 +0800 <mjboroski> How do you balance a market shakeout with maintaining the value of small businesses? "Only the strong survive" can absolutely go too far, but how far is that?
1343677030764843010 2020-12-29 05:55:43 +0800 <mjboroski> @danmurray23 It was always unlikely. A court case or 2 goes the other way and things would have changed quickly.
1343674380811907074 2020-12-29 05:45:11 +0800 <mjboroski> Instead of mandating individuals to do things bc of Covid, they could've just declared a temporary "right to distance one's self" and businesses would've accommodated us just the same without giving up being open. Could've been a big opportunity to bolster the delivery economy.

1343406150088327168 2020-12-28 11:59:20 +0800 <mjboroski> How long until Biden can't be president, after inauguration day?
1343319004845367298 2020-12-28 06:13:03 +0800 <mjboroski> Whatever he's trying to do, Trump isn't going to pull it off. Biden is your president come 01/20/21, like it or not. Not going to comment on implications.

1343260568795439104 2020-12-28 02:20:50 +0800 <mjboroski> @DavidLiberty311 My state doesn't even have public ballot initiatives, so that's a big one for me locally, but I was going for stuff that is more universal.
1343260262250512384 2020-12-28 02:19:37 +0800 <mjboroski> @DavidLiberty311 My whole thought process has been "What would be a good platform for a Libertarian to actually be competitive?"
1343259950072651776 2020-12-28 02:18:23 +0800 <mjboroski> @DavidLiberty311 Let me be clear that I believe less government is almost always greater for efficiency and freedom, but we're in such a state of disarray that we need transition measures because some people can't handle such sudden change.
1343259434487869441 2020-12-28 02:16:20 +0800 <mjboroski> @DavidLiberty311 Part would have to go to public programs to handle the transition to freedom. Addiction and recovery stuff for drugs and gambling. The rest goes to wherever you want it. I lean towards maintaining infrastructure and roads, but that's a different debate entirely.
1343252229638254593 2020-12-28 01:47:42 +0800 <mjboroski> Decriminalize personal use of drugs, legalize gambling, fireworks, psychoactive research, self-driving car research, sex work, alternative education models that save money, off-road vehicles, expand 2A.
1343252228816203780 2020-12-28 01:47:42 +0800 <mjboroski> My moderate libertarian stance is that we should use sin taxes to replace as many state taxes as possible. Maximum freedom, greatly increased tourism, and lower taxes are important first steps to opening people's eyes. Regulate, legalize, and tax.
1342904651067387904 2020-12-27 02:46:33 +0800 <mjboroski> @JbcTrader Absolutely correct. New England winters aren't kind to plant production, though.

1341977173612224512 2020-12-24 13:21:05 +0800 <mjboroski> How long before New York taxes get so high that an unrecoverable exodus occurs? I'd really love for UBI to work, I just don't believe it can.
1340003237483700225 2020-12-19 02:37:22 +0800 <mjboroski> You can't force people to do things for any reason and expect them to comply.
1340003050656837633 2020-12-19 02:36:37 +0800 <mjboroski> At the heart of the pronoun battle is a simple premise. One side says "I can be whatever I want" as and the other side says "You'll never find happiness unless you're comfortable with who you are naturally." Affeminate males and masculine females exist, and that's fine.

1339668802682941461 2020-12-18 04:28:27 +0800 <mjboroski> @BenjaminAD7 My last 2 posts before it happened are Covid related so I'm assuming that's what tipped the algo.
1339668630510964737 2020-12-18 04:27:46 +0800 <mjboroski> Saying what should be policy is very different than looking at the reality of the world and assessing what can actually be applied, remembering that most people have to agree with your idea in a democratic society.
1339667819923787777 2020-12-18 04:24:32 +0800 <mjboroski> I think I'm in a weird shadowban state. It shows I'm not following anyone.

1338699736619110402 2020-12-15 12:17:43 +0800 <mjboroski> If the opposite were true, they would pay money to have the players vaccinated early and quietly or make it into a public service message. The owners would gladly do this to protect their human assets.
1338699148846096385 2020-12-15 12:15:23 +0800 <mjboroski> Read this article as: "These are million-dollar-or-more valued athletes, we're not risking our business model on an ill-tested vaccine until preliminary testing on the public is complete".  https://t.co/hSqRZX9b2t

1337610250048909312 2020-12-12 12:08:29 +0800 <mjboroski> Hot take:          There's no chip in the vaccine and it's mostly safe.   Side note:           For a few unlucky people, it will cause major autoimmune problems.

1336886827064680449 2020-12-10 12:13:52 +0800 <mjboroski> @theRealRangel @SharpHomeUSA It seems so. They left me high and dry. I was gonna offer money.
1336872202239680514 2020-12-10 11:15:45 +0800 <mjboroski> 4. Let spawning program phase out, adjust donation rate every 4 years on an up/down, supermajority to change, ballot measure vote. Maintain minimum government structure.
1336872201396637701 2020-12-10 11:15:45 +0800 <mjboroski> 3. Create a modest national sales tax where citizens get to allocate their sales tax dollars to the charities of their choice. Think Fairtax, but donations in lieu of taxation. The strong charities thrive as people vote with their dollars on how they can make society better.
1336872200574529542 2020-12-10 11:15:45 +0800 <mjboroski> 2. Take a small portion of our substantial savings and invest it in a spawning program for non-profit charities which are publicly-supported. Put in new supports, then remove the old. For funding...
1336872199744069634 2020-12-10 11:15:44 +0800 <mjboroski> 1. Cut both spending and taxes heavily. The drop-off in relief for the needy would need to be addressed. The income tax disappears with many others, as well as a good share of state departments and agencies. No foreign aid except matching contributions for disaster relief.
1336834310599553027 2020-12-10 08:45:11 +0800 <mjboroski> @ABC Failure is part of the process. That's why there's 3 of these ships lined up in CC. Now 2.

1335614229571899392 2020-12-06 23:57:01 +0800 <mjboroski> It would be far more efficient to give legal personhood to be the environment  by allowing lawsuits on behalf of future generations than to regulate every business activity for environmental compliance.
1335275475481063430 2020-12-06 01:30:56 +0800 <mjboroski> Every government dollar spent is you paying for a service you never asked for. Ask yourself: Would this service exist either as a business or nonprofit organization if there were no state? If you answered no, that spending should not exist. If you answered yes, privatize it.
1334897815072419845 2020-12-05 00:30:14 +0800 <mjboroski> @StayOffTheRoad1 Part of the birth decline is the effect of capitalism and success. That part is fine, but the physiologic changes are concerning.

I can't see one and a Children of Men scenario seems more likely than ever with our increasingly complex chemical exposure as humans.

1331095573273960449 2020-11-24 12:41:29 +0800 <mjboroski> @ImTheRealKayden People think of tires as just a rubber thing you use for traction, but it goes a lot deeper than that. Tires that aren't cut all the way down to 2/32" effectively lose 1/4 of their life. The silica ratio (and more cuts) affects how they handle in the rain but lower gas mileage.

This drives us to improve on tech, which in turn, takes more of our time. At some point, this time given to tech will exhaust and distort people mentally on a large scale.

1329976637518209025 2020-11-21 10:35:14 +0800 <mjboroski> @FastLain918 How big is your house, though? Market value?

1328416409379074048 2020-11-17 03:15:27 +0800 <mjboroski> @Therickiestric1 For barebones basics, I might start with youtube law videos. Minimal effort to gain knowledge of landmark cases and how they apply.
1328361630472810497 2020-11-16 23:37:47 +0800 <mjboroski> @Therickiestric1 Im thinking I might start with a 100 core cases conlaw book. Nothing's difficult to learn when you find it interesting, in my experience.
1328361253660733440 2020-11-16 23:36:17 +0800 <mjboroski> @EJLiberty1 You may very well be right, but I'm looking to learn about constitutional law to better understand it.
1328233745841856512 2020-11-16 15:09:37 +0800 <mjboroski> @EJLiberty1 Yes, but what about the beginning part and all the other amendments that aren't numbered "2"?
1328232646791602177 2020-11-16 15:05:15 +0800 <mjboroski> What are the most invaluable constitutional law resources you know of? I intend to gorge myself on constitutional law knowledge for the remainder of the year. Knowledge is power, right?
1328224095213916161 2020-11-16 14:31:16 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich "or to the people"
1328221225907347456 2020-11-16 14:19:52 +0800 <mjboroski> @TerryBovine Originalism would disagree. Need more truly originalist judges.
1328217303129919489 2020-11-16 14:04:16 +0800 <mjboroski> What sort of mental gymnastics did they use to justify legally growing the federal government so much?  https://t.co/z83FlqT1lZ
1328211535127306240 2020-11-16 13:41:21 +0800 <mjboroski> Hard to watch. I've never supported ending qualified immunity more. If your work mistake involves rolling up onto someone's property, killing their pet, and then realizing you had the wrong address, career over, no questions.
1328210447443652609 2020-11-16 13:37:02 +0800 <mjboroski> I think I found my cause to fight for.   https://t.co/dZYqxwmbcW

1327283288617181187 2020-11-14 00:12:50 +0800 <mjboroski> @TrumpsTears As would I. This whole thing will change the way we work forever, thank God.
1327275211201409030 2020-11-13 23:40:44 +0800 <mjboroski> Given the choice of no vax &amp; WFH vs vax &amp; commute, I choose the former. We should have a moderate fear of Covid as a potent disease, but not enough to consume our rationality.
1326748578350555136 2020-11-12 12:48:05 +0800 <mjboroski> Today I learned...

1325988163475673088 2020-11-10 10:26:28 +0800 <mjboroski> @BruceFo43322941 I just want to know the truth, though I doubt most of it ever comes out
1325984699924303879 2020-11-10 10:12:42 +0800 <mjboroski> @JeremyLundmark I tweeted it in this voice, as well.
1325983782437081088 2020-11-10 10:09:03 +0800 <mjboroski> Trump and Biden both cheated. I guarantee it.
1325983662651957248 2020-11-10 10:08:35 +0800 <mjboroski> When all 50 states agree on something, then and only then does it make sense to federalize that issue for the sake of efficiency of agency. The only exceptions to this rule are matters that MUST be dealt with at the national level.
1325568174889299969 2020-11-09 06:37:35 +0800 <mjboroski> @theRealRangel Universal corporate tax elimination and raising the requirements for govt healthcare? Sure.
1325496408737198080 2020-11-09 01:52:25 +0800 <mjboroski> Which would have the greatest positive effect on America?
1324891044757037056 2020-11-07 09:46:55 +0800 <mjboroski> @StevenLHess Of course I want more parties. Is it possible in this country though?
1324890287932661765 2020-11-07 09:43:54 +0800 <mjboroski> @BillTheFajita Choose your own reality, the real life game.
1324882953529384960 2020-11-07 09:14:45 +0800 <mjboroski> This happens because Occam's Razor is applied differently by different people. This is brought on by uncertainty of answers. Our brains are wired to try and find answers even when they aren't there.
1324881959600889856 2020-11-07 09:10:48 +0800 <mjboroski> From 1789-1857, there were 5 different duopolies of Congress. This is because the parties morphed into something else or one dropped and the other split. Since 1857, when the Democrats and Republicans were first in control of Congress, it has not changed.
1324880575447101440 2020-11-07 09:05:18 +0800 <mjboroski> Libertarians and Republicans is a better duopoly.
1324490818791624708 2020-11-06 07:16:33 +0800 <mjboroski> @Run_DJA They were going to make illegal for anyone to postdate a ballot after election.
1324479362171871232 2020-11-06 06:31:02 +0800 <mjboroski> I've been resisting the call to call this outright election fraud, but things aren't looking good. I wonder what else was on this bill, though.
1324406039199043591 2020-11-06 01:39:40 +0800 <mjboroski> Believe what you want and I'm fine with that, but from my perspective this looks certifiable.
1324364438112210944 2020-11-05 22:54:22 +0800 <mjboroski> @DAOKeefe Expanded 2A might already be underway as well with ACB on the Supreme Court. Trump is bringing troops home somewhat, but the money being funneled into the military is beyond obscene.
1324360076627529728 2020-11-05 22:37:02 +0800 <mjboroski> @BrentonBob I almost put prison reform on here but figured drug decriminalization and more money from no income tax would do a decent job of getting that started. Military cuts are more possible with better international cooperation/collaboration on occasional military matters.

1324234245632626688 2020-11-05 14:17:01 +0800 <mjboroski> That feeling when you zone out too much and accidentally open a promoted tweet.
1324223224926949377 2020-11-05 13:33:14 +0800 <mjboroski> @BillTheFajita LSD, Psilocybin, Mescaline, MDA, MDMA, Ketamine, DMT, Ibogaine all have proven therapeutic value in the right medical circumstances. Some of those treat opiate addiction.
1324215832428355584 2020-11-05 13:03:51 +0800 <mjboroski> @BillTheFajita Now that NJ is out of the way, NY and DE will follow and then CT, RI, NH. Oregon legislation will be highly effective and will quickly spread to WA and CA. Proof of concept will have it popping up in places like VT/MA/MI/CO.

1324200801212993537 2020-11-05 12:04:08 +0800 <mjboroski> @DannyG_49 Vouchers by town would work against property taxes instead of income tax.

1324194182655844352 2020-11-05 11:37:50 +0800 <mjboroski> @poopityswoop I find many people don't realize how pure capitalism boosts everything. They see the direct route of giving things to the needy as the right way when, in reality, that's about the worst thing you could do to help them (aside from basic things like soup kitchens and shelters).
1324191045333245953 2020-11-05 11:25:22 +0800 <mjboroski> @poopityswoop I enjoy finding the root thing that we can't agree on because of differences in opinion, in order to see where their logic lies. Often, it's just "alright, that's our difference", but once in a while, I actually learn something from this process.
1324188507133325313 2020-11-05 11:15:16 +0800 <mjboroski> @TokyoxLACult Feel free to spread it far and wide ü§ô

This is the type of response that influences my strategic views for the party moving forward. Group brainstorming for the sake of centralizing ideas.
1324187480594227202 2020-11-05 11:11:12 +0800 <mjboroski> @Gh4nder Picked up one of these guys too:  https://t.co/XGd7ZjTNOx

1324186056586133505 2020-11-05 11:05:32 +0800 <mjboroski> What are your top 5 realistically attainable libertarian policies that could be implemented by 2030, given the current political climate?   I've got mine: 1. Income tax elimination/FairTax 2. Drug decriminalization 3. Expanded 2A 4. School vouchers 5. Drastic overseas troop redux
1324165828342960129 2020-11-05 09:45:09 +0800 <mjboroski> @BaldPrivilege Self-sufficiency leaves you with only property taxes. That's how I plan on eliminating myself from their equation as soon as I've worked my 30 years to boost my early SS collection.

As a matter of principle, whenever threatened, I tell the other person: "Do it." and when they put their faults on me, I say "You need to deal with that problem."
1324010276669239298 2020-11-04 23:27:03 +0800 <mjboroski> @starshine8685 @string_literal @m_g_hoffmann I'm just saying it's a grayscale. Everyone defines their own level that crosses from bad behavior into outright abuse.

1324004269364826113 2020-11-04 23:03:11 +0800 <mjboroski> @starshine8685 @string_literal @m_g_hoffmann I don't support domestic abuse (who does?), but there's a sharp difference between yelling and hitting. Both are wrong, but verbal abuse is more of a grayscale, while physical abuse is more of a line in the sand. People get angry at each other. Things get said both ways.

1323809491872325632 2020-11-04 10:09:12 +0800 <mjboroski> @CanceledTee I was wondering the same thing.
1323808565832855553 2020-11-04 10:05:31 +0800 <mjboroski> What I see is Trump let Turkey &amp; Russia loose bc other world countries (especially the Eurozone) we have military presence in outright refused his push for them to fund their own defense before we pulled out troops. Playing other countries against each other. Clever, honestly.
1323802808617996289 2020-11-04 09:42:39 +0800 <mjboroski> The rate of war will be very high globally. This will galvanize into a regime change where society takes a leap much like the US and France did in close proximity in the 1700's with the Enlightenment. A million ways we can improve, but we're stuck in limbo until the cards fall.
1323801707692916738 2020-11-04 09:38:16 +0800 <mjboroski> Next time the financial system tanks will be bad. Another 2008 would be much worse bc the banking system is running out of tools to save us. As global markets fall further into ruins, US's policy of bribing countries for peace would become prohibitively expensive for taxpayers.
1323800660790444034 2020-11-04 09:34:07 +0800 <mjboroski> I'd be really interested to see what new forms of charity, financial products, and insurance would be invented if we truly liberated the market. How would our choice of food and other products change when subsidies go away and reprice the market accurately?

1323773877441470466 2020-11-04 07:47:41 +0800 <mjboroski> @Ginrummy420 @DennisMcKenna4 I did not decide to live here. No entity should be entitled to steal unless a crime has been committed.
1323773532493500421 2020-11-04 07:46:19 +0800 <mjboroski> What if instead of social programs we had Personal Ruin Insurance? You pay a fixed amount every month based on your level of risk and if you end up broke, they provide room and board and assistance finding another job for you/your family.
1323772668378783744 2020-11-04 07:42:53 +0800 <mjboroski> @Ginrummy420 @DennisMcKenna4 I never signed any social contract and I certainly don't believe that I'm entitled to other people's money when the going gets tough. How about an actual insurance policy that's opt-in and costs real dollars every month to those who want it?
1323771405775884288 2020-11-04 07:37:52 +0800 <mjboroski> @Ginrummy420 @DennisMcKenna4 Social programs create generational dependence and exacerbate wealth disparity.

1323430471292866561 2020-11-03 09:03:07 +0800 <mjboroski> @Bowden4Senate In general, I'd put forth that any verbal coercion toward the unjust becomes criminal. The idea of not causing harm to health gets tricky with mental health. NAP includes only physical person, perhaps?

By comparing against the rest of the world, it can be concluded that the intended axis is the latter because no rational person roots for every other nation above their own.

1322969062931111936 2020-11-02 02:29:38 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci @SaverParty I have severe doubts, but I wish you the best of luck. Running for office is no easy feat, in my experience.
1322966194131996675 2020-11-02 02:18:14 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci That's much more reasonable. I wholeheartedly disagree in principle with any property ownership restrictions, but I'd be interested to see it tested out in a city far, far away from me out of sheer curiosity. I still think the diverted investment $ would just go to another city.
1322961793036259328 2020-11-02 02:00:45 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci So you're not advocating against renting, but rather placing maximum ownership limits on rent-collectors?
1322959956337926144 2020-11-02 01:53:27 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci What does this mean?  "become buyable units minus 5 investments-to rent per person"
1322958739327143939 2020-11-02 01:48:37 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci This ignores the fact that the materials alone to build the place would total WAYYYY over $5k.
1322958204012273664 2020-11-02 01:46:29 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Where do you get this number? If it was that cheap, that would mean nobody wants to live there. Think Detroit, 2009.
1322957411104264200 2020-11-02 01:43:20 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Well another side-effect of pushing things underground is that now you've robbed the renters of any rights they may have had before your ban. Anytime someone wants to ban a part of the market, it goes poorly.
1322956253585461255 2020-11-02 01:38:44 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci From there, under-the-table sublets would be easy enough to arrange for 2 interested parties.
1322956052967657473 2020-11-02 01:37:57 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci What's to stop someone from putting one property in each family members' name and contractually binding that property back to themselves from the family member?
1322955771936755713 2020-11-02 01:36:50 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Until people act on rent-seekers by moving away and penalizing them financially it will be encouraged behavior. Making it illegal will only create a black market for it.
1322954978076643338 2020-11-02 01:33:40 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci The problem is over-regulation. As a younger, single man living in the city, I would have been perfectly content with a 150sqft apartment, but codes made that impossible. Building my own home at that same modest size? Also prohibited. Restriction of markets.
1322953874697867267 2020-11-02 01:29:17 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci So renting in any form shouldn't be allowed? That's pretty out there. If I want to rent something to my neighbor and they feel that it is worth the money, who is anybody to tell us we can't do that?
1322953459130421248 2020-11-02 01:27:38 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci You can't regulate out human financial creativity. What would decrease rent costs is smaller dwellings. Get less, give less.
1322952958166896640 2020-11-02 01:25:39 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Who is the third party? A rent contract is between renter and owner. Renting tools from Home Depot is no different. People see the opportunity to rent as valuable despite the increased cost. If they didn't want that, they would buy instead.
1322952213464076288 2020-11-02 01:22:41 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Conversely, you and I sign a contract. You mow my lawn for $50. Mowed. Paid. Done. Come to find out that the local average is actually $38. On what basis do I collect the additional $12 that you robbed me of (under your definition)?
1322951432845299712 2020-11-02 01:19:35 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Last I checked, we can freely travel across state lines.
1322951201869221888 2020-11-02 01:18:40 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci So let's say you and I sign a contract. I mow your lawn for $50. Mowed. Paid. Done. Come to find out that the local average is actually $62. On what basis do I collect the additional $12 that you robbed me of (under your definition)?
1322949765135540226 2020-11-02 01:12:57 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci I think taxes should be as close to nothing as possible. I never signed a contract to pay taxes in exchange for a good or service.
1322949459936976896 2020-11-02 01:11:45 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Contractual agreements are, by nature, not theft. In fact, they are the exact opposite.
1322949193531535360 2020-11-02 01:10:41 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Good luck with that. Remember that nobody is making anybody rent. For whatever personal reasons they have, people CHOOSE to continue to live in places with high rent. Taking away property rights will only remove investment money from that place.
1322948133882601473 2020-11-02 01:06:28 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Alright, then. How do you propose taking property away from people?
1322946569012977665 2020-11-02 01:00:15 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Making an analogy between business partners and renting is a false equivalency. Business-consumer is what it is. If you don't like the prices there, you shop elsewhere.
1322946094226153475 2020-11-02 00:58:22 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Telling someone what they are and aren't allowed to buy and own is a slippery slope that doesn't end well. Do you own more socks than you absolutely need? That could be considered hoarding from others as well, since you are making the price of socks go up ever-so-slightly.
1322942838326333440 2020-11-02 00:45:26 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci There's always somewhere in America with very low demand selling homes for $1. The problem isn't the investors buying houses. It's that a lot of people want the same thing, so prices rise on a limited good.  https://t.co/z0Vm1RsPbF
1322942103756791808 2020-11-02 00:42:31 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci So buy some land and build a cheap place. People leaving the cities will reduce prices there and make my property value go up, as it currently is. If you're seeking 100% efficiency, good luck. Capitalism is the best method of efficiency, but not perfect.
1322941251109462018 2020-11-02 00:39:07 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci One should run their own finances as though it were a business. Does it make sense to live in a city if you can't afford it?
1322940837152624646 2020-11-02 00:37:29 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Good business demands weighing out the costs vs the return and planning a way to succeed given the state of the business environment going into the venture.
1322940285538754562 2020-11-02 00:35:17 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Don't forget to factor in reward for risks taken. Nobody would undergo risk if it weren't for the potential payoff. If it weren't for rent-seekers, anyone who couldn't afford to buy outright would have nowhere to live. If property values plummet, they take a hit too.
1322933956862423041 2020-11-02 00:10:08 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Also, RC is inherently not free market, hence the adverse price effect.
1322933666205622277 2020-11-02 00:08:59 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci They can only go as high as the people will pay. Inner cities are more demanded, so the value goes up. Rent-control increases demand for apts that remain bc rent-controlled ones are effectively off the market. This makes the price go up for anyone without RC. Leave city, get $.

1322929457070485513 2020-11-01 23:52:16 +0800 <mjboroski> @Nickcarducci Better off with a small house than a condo, any day of the week. Freedom from contractual control.

1322749449106575360 2020-11-01 11:56:58 +0800 <mjboroski> Stoics made it a practice to contemplate death. They had the phrase "Memento Mori", meaning "Remember Death" to help remind ourselves of our mortality in order to stay humble. Masks are making people contemplate death, causing some to breakdown, but others to mentally flourish.

1320894673175695361 2020-10-27 09:06:45 +0800 <mjboroski> What do you think, @nshaviv ?
1320894268723089409 2020-10-27 09:05:09 +0800 <mjboroski> @curryja Does this seem plausible to you?
1320882967607214080 2020-10-27 08:20:14 +0800 <mjboroski> (6/6) This all happens because hotter air and higher pressure cause a faster spin of the atmosphere, increasing the speed of the circular polar air current, which in turn increases the speed of the polar ocean gyre, thus setting off the chain of events. @Electroversenet
1320882966319517696 2020-10-27 08:20:14 +0800 <mjboroski> (5/6) This effect will be measurable by an increasingly outward ocean current from the polar gyre. We are heading for a sudden ice age. This is how the Earth modulates itself. If the air gets too hot, the ocean releases cold by utilizing a more stable ocean temp. Basis of life?
1320882965480640515 2020-10-27 08:20:14 +0800 <mjboroski> (4/6) ..this is released into the atmosphere as heat energy, taking global air temperatures up with it. Now that the gyre is weakening, this will continue until the equatorial warmth has all gone into the air enough to cause the climate to suddenly begin cooling.
1320882964536975360 2020-10-27 08:20:14 +0800 <mjboroski> (3/6) This forces the oceanic currents to move further away from the pole. By doing this, they conserve more heat by travelling less distance, making measurements of such much currents display as warmer. Because warm water evaporates faster and more readily than cold water..
1320882963203170304 2020-10-27 08:20:13 +0800 <mjboroski> (2/6) This has served an insulation of the cold, low energy water from the hotter, high temperature water that flows from equatorial regions in a giant belt around our oceans. Because cold water is more dense, it exerts a higher force on the hot water than the hot water returns.
1320882962313973761 2020-10-27 08:20:13 +0800 <mjboroski> (1/6) A thread on global warming. Imagine this: The northern polar region has been storing cold water from an increasingly fast polar oceanic gyre existing for many sustained years. This gyre is now weakening, releasing cold water out into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

1319335946677006336 2020-10-23 01:52:56 +0800 <mjboroski> (11/11) I live in CT and my state will be voting Biden. I will be voting Jorgensen in hopes of pressuring all party platforms ever so slightly towards more libertarian views. I won't tell you how/whether to vote. I'll tell you to keep your eyes WIDE open to the world around you.
1319335945783660544 2020-10-23 01:52:56 +0800 <mjboroski> (10/11) Reports of Russia and Iran getting voter reg info leads me to believe they have one shared interest: American discord. An electoral college tie would hurt us most and does so by introducing uncertainty in America. Widespread dissent would skyrocket, escalating US tension.
1319335944802213888 2020-10-23 01:52:55 +0800 <mjboroski> (9/11) Trump has bucked generations of American will being imposed where it doesn't belong, allowing conflicts to settle. By ceding this power to Russia and bringing troops home (not enough yet), he is galvanizing American military strength for what matters: the Chinese threat.
1319335943816491011 2020-10-23 01:52:55 +0800 <mjboroski> (8/11) The Trump-Putin connection is a power-sharing connection. Trump has allowed Russia to take Syria in exchange for America not being as involved and allowing one side to win in order to end it. As long as ISIS is gone, so is any threat to the US and US interest is Syria.
1319335942650531841 2020-10-23 01:52:55 +0800 <mjboroski> (7/11) There is no Trump kompromat from Russia, China, or otherwise. That would have been released already with how he has exerted economic pressure on these countries. It would make sense that these countries are also funding dissension in the form of BLM (ie pallets of bricks).
1319335941304160257 2020-10-23 01:52:55 +0800 <mjboroski> (6/11) Look at China's Belt and Road initiative map and tell me where the money goes. It's Soviet collapse countries, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Russia. The water routes show where China intends to build ports for profit and influence. There is also a large investment in the US.
1319335940414951426 2020-10-23 01:52:54 +0800 <mjboroski> (5/11) Reading between the lines of what Trump says and does, this all seems plausible. "The Chinese virus". Full support of Saudi regime and even a peace deal in the region which is possible by eliminating the Iranian bad actors' influence in the region. Support for Israel.
1319335939085393920 2020-10-23 01:52:54 +0800 <mjboroski> (4/11) Pivot to Iran. Who does Iran want in power? Obama and Biden gave them hush money and traded American troops' lives for Bin Laden. Trump has been notoriously tough on both China and Iran, going so far as to strengthen their rivals.
1319335937319591938 2020-10-23 01:52:54 +0800 <mjboroski> (3/11) Think back to the video of China's Covid problem: people dropping in the streets spontaneously, etc. Have you seen anything like that since? Propaganda to support the economic attack on the West. This a power grab, plain and simple. China wants us to comply and suffer.
1319335936493260805 2020-10-23 01:52:53 +0800 <mjboroski> (2/11) China sent the Hunter Biden hard drive, and there are 2 more of them already sent. The first has Ukraine deal, drug use, and pedophilia(allegedly). The second has another shady deal in Kazakhstan. The third has evidence of weaponized Covid.
1319335935499186179 2020-10-23 01:52:53 +0800 <mjboroski> (1/11) I can't confirm this, and it sounds like tinfoil hat stuff (maybe it is), but it does make a ton of sense: China sent weaponized Covid, and through blackmail pressured democratic party to push for lockdowns. Democrats are in China's pocket, so China backs Dems in election.
1319318340867923968 2020-10-23 00:42:58 +0800 <mjboroski> This assumes that Trump wins the 3 swing states he's closest in (PA, NC, FL) and Maine splits districts with Biden winning the popular vote.
1319317807427952641 2020-10-23 00:40:51 +0800 <mjboroski> There's a very real possibility of an electoral college tie. House of Reps then votes on the new president. That would be catastrophic for American discourse.  https://t.co/d4XA7o71wE

The world doesn't care that you're trying to become an artist. You are responsible to support yourself and succeed first. Welcome to existence in the real world.

I'm betting you won't do that because you likely just want to benefit from other people working hard. If we took every American billionaire's money, it'd only fund our government for 8 months.

1316923670783266816 2020-10-16 10:07:25 +0800 <mjboroski> Pro Tip: If you want a book, esp. an older one, search google for the book &amp; author, then put "filetype:pdf" at the end of your search. This works for epub too. Then download the file, go to Google Play Books, "My Books". Click "Upload files" and drag file. Free personal library!

1316921199411253248 2020-10-16 09:57:35 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich In my eyes the challenge is not the endpoint, but rather the means. Start with a Fairtax-type system, distributable to user-selected charities. Set donation levels to be supermajority populous votes, up or down 3%. If things go to shit people reallocate their donations.
1316919944517472256 2020-10-16 09:52:36 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Would you settle for merit of cause in the meantime, voted by economic participation?

1316909196240179206 2020-10-16 09:09:54 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Good metrics, but who would determine the weight by which these are compared? I see where you're going and it seems a reasonable idea, but I fail to see how to set initial framework without widespread consensus. By what mechanism would people allow themselves to agree to this?
1316906293345587200 2020-10-16 08:58:21 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Assuming that's true, by what metric is the monarch determined?
1316896693657296896 2020-10-16 08:20:13 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich This is the void that democracy tries to fill. Merit is circumstantial.

1316847148009488384 2020-10-16 05:03:20 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Lots of merit there. Explain the monarchy bit, though.
1316843119359467520 2020-10-16 04:47:20 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich If anything, I suppose an overpriced company due to monopoly would give up business to local companies pretty quickly. I do agree that MOST monopolies are govt caused, though.
1316841214746996736 2020-10-16 04:39:45 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich What mechanism prevents  the most successful company from burying or buying out other companies?
1316836711406731269 2020-10-16 04:21:52 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich At first, but capitalism tends toward monopoly. Then what? Any firm that shows competition gets bought out and absorbed.
1316819265861943304 2020-10-16 03:12:32 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Wouldn't bribery corrupt many of those working in said fields? (More than now)
1316799365659471874 2020-10-16 01:53:28 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Curious how this would be handled.
1316797752874094598 2020-10-16 01:47:03 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Does not willingness to commit violence as a group for the purpose of imposing will have a negative impact on an anarchic society but create incentive for the group in question?

1315852585916682241 2020-10-13 11:11:18 +0800 <mjboroski> That which a person is most illogically offended by is usually their own greatest weakness, self-loathing being masked with outward hatred. On the flip side, that which one finds funniest is often what genuinely causes them the most pain from an uncontrollable external source.

1315837700889600001 2020-10-13 10:12:09 +0800 <mjboroski> @Rachelleyelly It's almost like the government mandates are useless since people would police each other using businesses as the mediator, their public perception and profit share on the line.

1315831815446376449 2020-10-13 09:48:46 +0800 <mjboroski> @youngmatthewd Community should decide how to keep things moving locally. How does lower intellect affect a desire for freedom, though? There are people who want to be ruled in every class of intellect.

1315691459627094018 2020-10-13 00:31:02 +0800 <mjboroski> Before you plant, you need to till the dirt. Trump is the tiller, stirring up everything. I don't agree with many things he's done, but he sets the path for seeds to be planted. I suspect that the country senses this unconsciously. I hope we are planting liberty and not control.

1315491780905885696 2020-10-12 11:17:35 +0800 <mjboroski> @CrowdFundedGov @TyJoeGrant There's the leap I don't get. I'm saying we have 1 in now, which proves it is possible. It is not possible everywhere now, but in more liberty-minded places, it would certainly be possible to get more in. That many out of of the entirety in the short term.
1315478011207188483 2020-10-12 10:22:52 +0800 <mjboroski> @CrowdFundedGov @TyJoeGrant Yes, out of how many offices. As in 3 out of 5. "Out of" implies the total number of offices.
1315476523500154883 2020-10-12 10:16:58 +0800 <mjboroski> @CrowdFundedGov @TyJoeGrant Yes, those are places I think a Libertarian candidate would do well.
1315474858189500421 2020-10-12 10:10:21 +0800 <mjboroski> @CrowdFundedGov @TyJoeGrant No, where did I say that?

1315474004380135425 2020-10-12 10:06:57 +0800 <mjboroski> @TyJoeGrant @CrowdFundedGov That's how things start.
1315473706186166272 2020-10-12 10:05:46 +0800 <mjboroski> @TyJoeGrant @CrowdFundedGov Get enough votes to sway some and the Repubs start to move out of authoritarianism to maintain their voter base.
1315473274575388672 2020-10-12 10:04:03 +0800 <mjboroski> @CrowdFundedGov @TyJoeGrant 1. There's others that could win. I'd venture to say a Libertarian candidate would do well in WY, NH, MT, AK for example.
1315472418773913600 2020-10-12 10:00:39 +0800 <mjboroski> @CrowdFundedGov @TyJoeGrant Def starts local, but federal isn't rigged everywhere yet. Proof: Amash.
1315471851800403968 2020-10-12 09:58:24 +0800 <mjboroski> @TyJoeGrant @CrowdFundedGov Get enough in Congress to sway votes instead of focusing on a majority. Thats how it starts, anyhow.

1312796917450055686 2020-10-05 00:49:10 +0800 <mjboroski> We have always bent the truth of a President's health in order to garner a more positive public perception of both the man and the strength of the country. If they are covering up Trump's condition being poorer, this is nothing new.  https://t.co/3GC05I6rCb

1312161909173485568 2020-10-03 06:45:52 +0800 <mjboroski> @majots__ This is something that really depends on the individual and what stage of their life they are at. Get the freakiness out of your system early, then you can settle down without regret.

1312132100632444928 2020-10-03 04:47:25 +0800 <mjboroski> Of note: Many on the right are guilty of this double-logic, as well.
1312131927025963008 2020-10-03 04:46:44 +0800 <mjboroski> If the Trumps get experimental Covid treatment, the left will say "That's elitist, we can't get that." If the Trumps don't get experimental treatment, the left will say "It can't be trusted, he's pushing the treatment early to help his election chances." Do you see the problem?
1312119395733258240 2020-10-03 03:56:56 +0800 <mjboroski> @flyfishnevada States were supposed to be just that, but federal overreach has prevented a lot.
1312119254800502784 2020-10-03 03:56:22 +0800 <mjboroski> @flyfishnevada What I think we need most is a testing ground for new ideas and methods or we are doomed to stay slaves to a deficient system forever.
1312106637289648128 2020-10-03 03:06:14 +0800 <mjboroski> What do you believe the state does better than we can do in the absence of a state. For me me, its relative neutrality of officers, courts, and military when compared to a stateless society. Not perfect now, but better by comparison, in my opinion.
1312088664479019009 2020-10-03 01:54:49 +0800 <mjboroski> @youngmatthewd @Dennis_E_Taylor Can you give me a quick synopsis? I'm guessing the books contain a fictional an-cap example with a good amount of explanation.
1312028380892626944 2020-10-02 21:55:16 +0800 <mjboroski> @youngmatthewd Not against hierarchy in any situation where it makes more sense than decentralization. Capitalism forms natural heirarchy but gives individuals the ability to change their own. (Good) Not familiar with the Bobiverse.
1312026884083978240 2020-10-02 21:49:20 +0800 <mjboroski> @BuenMozu Gradualism is the way.
1311872280281206785 2020-10-02 11:34:59 +0800 <mjboroski> I'd love to understand why you think I'm  wrong, though.
1311872133103005696 2020-10-02 11:34:24 +0800 <mjboroski> At this point in history, anarchism is either utopian or dystopian thinking. 99.9% of people couldn't handle the switch and wouldn't let it happen out of pure fear. The only way it comes to be is catastrophic collapse. Even then, many would rush to rebuild systems of order.

1311698881688805376 2020-10-02 00:05:58 +0800 <mjboroski> @philthatremains The only way this holds up in court is if they print money or raise taxes to pay it. In that case, everybody pays it. Socialism, plain and simple. Slow drains don't collapse the economy, they deflate it slightly, to everyone's detriment.
1311694412590841858 2020-10-01 23:48:12 +0800 <mjboroski> @pangyre Close enough. Procrastinators unite tomorrow!
1311694011418148864 2020-10-01 23:46:37 +0800 <mjboroski> Sober October begins today.
1311162156503703553 2020-09-30 12:33:12 +0800 <mjboroski> What you saw tonight is great, let me explain. This demonstrated that America has outgrown the short-form debate. We're long overdue to publicly have real discussions about the issues at hand. Our only glimpse into "reality" is in 2 minute format, and the news has long been dead.
1311160755744583681 2020-09-30 12:27:39 +0800 <mjboroski> I know I'm in a bit of an echo chamber, and I'm voting for Jorgensen, but... If I have to deal with one of these 2, I gotta say I prefer with the guy who frees up the economy.
1311159568941166600 2020-09-30 12:22:56 +0800 <mjboroski> @VulpineMachine Well if you watch it as though you're watching entertainment, best debate ever. If you're watching it find hope for the country, best to skip it.
1311158976499847169 2020-09-30 12:20:34 +0800 <mjboroski> @VulpineMachine Do you like watching the WWE?
1311137710640435202 2020-09-30 10:56:04 +0800 <mjboroski> Dude, @JamieVernon. Please put in a word with @joerogan that it might benefit America to show that @Jorgensen4POTUS has a perspective worth considering. Preferably before election day. Respect.
1311122427896791042 2020-09-30 09:55:20 +0800 <mjboroski> It's the economy, stupid.

1311116068270870529 2020-09-30 09:30:04 +0800 <mjboroski> I'm SOOOO for a Joe Rogan "moderated" debate.
1311115616686923777 2020-09-30 09:28:17 +0800 <mjboroski> I cannot stop laughing at these 2 together.
1311115258363285504 2020-09-30 09:26:51 +0800 <mjboroski> This debate is pure entertainment.
1310916786913783811 2020-09-29 20:18:12 +0800 <mjboroski> Whenever you demand money, material, or service, ask yourself 2 questions:  Is this worth causing the slavery of another to myself?   Would I become slave to another on the same basis?  Nothing comes from the void except the intangible, which we possess inside ourselves already.
1310914776667742208 2020-09-29 20:10:13 +0800 <mjboroski> @Locke_Wiggins Nice job putting it simply. Entitlement runs rampant and is the primary cause for the downfalls we face.

This was almost 20 years ago and, like many of college age, I was quite liberal at the time. The class was also encouraged to debate one another, based on logic. PoliSci class fyi
1310443812439941121 2020-09-28 12:58:46 +0800 <mjboroski> @PMObrenovich Interesting take, but I suspect it will. However, I anticipate a grueling slow crawl to get there. Like every other great change, the lead-up is forever, but once that switch finally does flip, dominoes fall incredibly fast. My greatest hope is to see it in my lifetime.

1310265612686548992 2020-09-28 01:10:40 +0800 <mjboroski> @AmishBTC Getting away from the point. The word was hijacked and, for general purposes, can't be used because it is widely correlated with a socialist ideology.
1310264300003635207 2020-09-28 01:05:27 +0800 <mjboroski> @AmishBTC Anything can be positive or negative depending on its use, but "progressive libertarian" seems like an oxymoron, when I believe it is the best way to describe someone who wants to get there with small, steady changes in that direction. Hence I use "incremental" instead.
1310262730633469954 2020-09-28 00:59:13 +0800 <mjboroski> @Lobby_Loiterer The effects of the internet being invented and widely adopted.

1310261297850855425 2020-09-28 00:53:31 +0800 <mjboroski> How did such a narrow philosophy get to claim the word progressive from everyone else?
1309867700676632576 2020-09-26 22:49:30 +0800 <mjboroski> @time_curiosity Personally, I feel that our forces should be defending our borders, not the world's. I also believe that gun ownership and self-driving car technology have the potential to greatly reduce the need for police, although not eliminate it.
1309860667290251265 2020-09-26 22:21:33 +0800 <mjboroski> @time_curiosity It's all about what you believe based on logic and reason. I'd love to defund everything and have no government whatsoever, but not without proper alternative solutions in place first. We have goals but we're not insane. Well, not all of us.

1308893570988937221 2020-09-24 06:18:40 +0800 <mjboroski> @RubyRoseTHC @VerumLiberty I guess its a matter of perspective. The specificity of *what* changes matters. That said, your point is well received.
1308892480675418114 2020-09-24 06:14:20 +0800 <mjboroski> @RubyRoseTHC @VerumLiberty Isn't that a change for the worse?
1308891818864644102 2020-09-24 06:11:42 +0800 <mjboroski> Politics used to be taboo, but now is highly professed, similar to how Christianity was evangelized. Like the printing press, the internet is changing things rapidly, agnostic to a cause. Social media has become a center of e-propaganda. From uncertainty, progress will ensue.

1307680634614185987 2020-09-20 21:58:53 +0800 <mjboroski> A free economy is first and foremost. The rest follows naturally in due time. For this reason, I prefer a conservative Supreme Court when given the option of the duopoly. A liberty-minded judge would be ideal, though.

This will save the planet by forcing sustainable practice via the legal system's impositions on the free market. This is not needless regulation but, rather, a way to ensure survival.

If everyone has guns without central authority on justice related issues, only a matter of time before tribal bands form and try to grab power.
1303139141471920128 2020-09-08 09:12:37 +0800 <mjboroski> @ButCancelled Curious how we would maintain neutrality in justice without government. Wouldn't we revert back to an earlier part of history where the largest, strongest group ransacked and pillaged the rest?

1302349698716573702 2020-09-06 04:55:39 +0800 <mjboroski> WW2 was a call to arms for America where people made real sacrifice to defend American interests. This has not happened since because after WW2, the military industrial complex has influenced the government to stay on the offensive. All our current problems reek of an Ivory City.

1302069327072550912 2020-09-05 10:21:33 +0800 <mjboroski> @ObiWannK With the USD being the world's reserve currency, we get a mulligan at the cost of that status. After that, we need to turn it around or hyperinflation will take root. If the "mulligan" takes place, it causes global inflation and countries more invested in the USD suffer more.

1302066668269699072 2020-09-05 10:10:59 +0800 <mjboroski> @SSSammiSue Allow me to rephrase: Which of the following 2 candidates will more people switch their vote from to vote for Kanye? Of course we have freedom to choose, but I'll gladly comply with the semantic hullabaloo. Kanye is on the ballot in roughly ten states. Not nothing.

1302034223050743811 2020-09-05 08:02:04 +0800 <mjboroski> @LandonBeach27 That's not true. The 2 party system doesn't allow you to comment.

1301924922927853569 2020-09-05 00:47:44 +0800 <mjboroski> @JCaesar007 Same. Not totally anarchist, primarily capitalist feels like a good place to be.

1301919545125474304 2020-09-05 00:26:22 +0800 <mjboroski> @Lobby_Loiterer @petartaylor I ask because I think that left views have great merit on the local level, where people in a voluntarily formed community share and hold each other accountable, but that for communities to trade with one another we need a framework of capitalist principles to stay on the rails.
1301915898656235521 2020-09-05 00:11:53 +0800 <mjboroski> @petartaylor @Lobby_Loiterer Do you find your left-libertarian views to be more conducive to small scale communes or large-scale socialism?

1301714993050775554 2020-09-04 10:53:33 +0800 <mjboroski> @ToddHagopian I'm good with it but I don't support forcing it on people.

1301592673678241792 2020-09-04 02:47:30 +0800 <mjboroski> The whole putting a üëè between üëè words üëè thing makes you look needy for attention.
1301365317772488704 2020-09-03 11:44:04 +0800 <mjboroski> Why is the FEDERAL government funding cities at all? Why do STATE governments fund cities? How about this?: If your municipality can't stand on its own 2 legs, then change the way your municipality is run.
1301336110208090112 2020-09-03 09:48:00 +0800 <mjboroski> @TimeTrench The mental state of a good chunk of society would prevent a reasonable transition in anything that could be perceived as short order. Entitlement runs rampant and so do anger issues exacerbated by a lifetime of economic prosperity.
1301333716288110592 2020-09-03 09:38:30 +0800 <mjboroski> @ShadaZeal The trick is finding someone who's the same kind of crazy. Then you can both learn to stop overthinking and be chill. Then you can learn to fight all the time and not even get upset. Them you can become a debt slave like the rest of us.
1301270075018817536 2020-09-03 05:25:36 +0800 <mjboroski> @normonics Why are military and border control considered separate endeavors? Unless we are at war, the military should be there ONLY to defend our borders.

1301165760400756736 2020-09-02 22:31:06 +0800 <mjboroski> Even if they were to let Jo debate, do you think the short-answer format would allow enough time to educate and inform Americans of Libertarian principles without getting caught up in political shutdown babble between candidates? If so, enough to be effective?
1301164174047928325 2020-09-02 22:24:48 +0800 <mjboroski> Replace the Dems with Greens and the Repubs with Libertarians. Still stays a 2 party system. Does the political climate revert back to its current state?
1301163470449242112 2020-09-02 22:22:00 +0800 <mjboroski> @w_ryan_kirby @jerrydantonio Coupled with the have-nothing state of the people and a blatant corporate abuse of workers pre-unionization, people were compelled to believe that it was possible to legislate away their woes. We did get the 40 hour work week from this era, so it's not all bad.
1300987619745161217 2020-09-02 10:43:14 +0800 <mjboroski> @JCaesar007 Right, but the current system has proven cyclical so any new system that holds an alternative with promise is preferable at this point.
1300971317114667008 2020-09-02 09:38:27 +0800 <mjboroski> @JCaesar007 Too many are of the "all or nothing, instant gratification" mindset. These things take either 1) Time or 2) Bloodshed. I prefer the former by a longshot. Let the world find its own way.
1300962068271689728 2020-09-02 09:01:42 +0800 <mjboroski> @alissagrowsfood How difficult/tedious is the goat maintenance? I'd imagine they don't need their oil and air filter changed too often.
1300959462719660032 2020-09-02 08:51:21 +0800 <mjboroski> @CheckYourBiases @JCaesar007 I've thought it out to be modeled on natural systems where it becomes more efficient over time and is phased out based on the will of the population paying into programs vs the quality of society around them. Wisdom of the herd.
1300956148670005249 2020-09-02 08:38:11 +0800 <mjboroski> @CheckYourBiases @JCaesar007 Essentially its an idea that serves as training wheels for getting the big govt chains off. Nonprofits can serve most of the functions govt does and more efficiently. By tying it to directly to purchases, it becomes a direct voting mechanism to allocate funds. Over time, phaseout
1300954900944297989 2020-09-02 08:33:13 +0800 <mjboroski> I've been craving the libertarian dialogue. #NoLibertarianUnder1K is a smashing success. This will build from here.
1300954146477137921 2020-09-02 08:30:13 +0800 <mjboroski> @CheckYourBiases @JCaesar007 Social contract will always exist at some level. Minimal social contract is ideal though.
1300953924422246400 2020-09-02 08:29:20 +0800 <mjboroski> @CheckYourBiases @JCaesar007 Agreed. I think it evolves into separation of powers from government and eventually a winnowing down to bare essentials as decided by the population. Check the link on my description. I detailed it out pretty well if you're interested.
1300952457560887296 2020-09-02 08:23:31 +0800 <mjboroski> @CheckYourBiases @JCaesar007 Fairfax is good. My problem is that it just changes how the centralized collection is taken. Distribute the money and create a free market of nonprofits.
1300950989005041665 2020-09-02 08:17:40 +0800 <mjboroski> @jenniferhotspur What's your rate?
1300924351416537088 2020-09-02 06:31:50 +0800 <mjboroski> @JCaesar007 My thought is that it would work as a transitional compromise to appease statists while the world finds the best solutions through evolutionary iterations of non govt entities to prevent system shock-incited chaos. People are fickle when it comes to major changes.
1300921467480297474 2020-09-02 06:20:22 +0800 <mjboroski> @philllosoraptor I'm in CT as well and made this same decision a couple days ago. I want an EDC as well as a hunting gun. Going to go with a Glock pistol and a Remington 870 shotty for versatility in hunting.

1300912459113521153 2020-09-02 05:44:34 +0800 <mjboroski> Would a mandatory donation to a charity of your choice in lieu of taxation ONLY on purchases through registered businesses still count as theft or would it qualify as a sanctioned economy participation fee?
1300903469268729858 2020-09-02 05:08:51 +0800 <mjboroski> @TheGreatRoh Remove the restriction on minimum housing size and the poor can afford a roof over their head.
1300902230040686592 2020-09-02 05:03:55 +0800 <mjboroski> @LarkinWilder I support women getting the same fair shake that men get. Some would say that makes me a feminist, depending on the definition. That said, I believe traditional roles tend to work better for good reason.

1300622531502788608 2020-09-01 10:32:30 +0800 <mjboroski> @jessinicoleb Sadly, I think the country has gotten so used to boiling water that we also need to turn the temp down slowly so they can realize how good it can be without being consumed by fear.
