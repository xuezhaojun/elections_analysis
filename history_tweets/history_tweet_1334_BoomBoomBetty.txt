1338875674476613632 2020-12-15 23:56:50 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> SCRAPED THE TOP AND ANGLE CUT. This is my cry for help.  https://t.co/m8pFAEyApI

1337433970430992385 2020-12-12 00:28:01 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @VexedPatriarch What is wrong with these people?!
1337433606143164417 2020-12-12 00:26:34 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @6catsCatholic @mommajessiec I almost took a picture to illustrate but I knew there would be people who understood at a deep anxious level
1337433382045696001 2020-12-12 00:25:41 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @WinterRose0312 @DadBits We need a safe haven from these people
1337399430140600322 2020-12-11 22:10:46 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> I opened the butter dish and discovered someone likes to cut the butter stick at an angle rather than straight across. So if this is my last tweet it’s because I live with a psychopath.

1332054816089116675 2020-11-27 04:13:11 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @sofarrsogud I’m thankful you’re doing self reply tweets now 🎉🦃🦃  (You said I could do this!)

1331963162883715072 2020-11-26 22:08:59 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> This year more than any other year I'm thankful for the 21st amendment to the Constitution that ended the prohibition of alcohol

1309469698254426113 2020-09-25 20:27:59 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @sofarrsogud @CrockettForReal you up for the task, bud?
1309468647446982657 2020-09-25 20:23:48 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> Type “the reason I should delete my account is” and let autocomplete finish it until you finally hit the deactivate button for real

1309236297618329600 2020-09-25 05:00:32 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> My favorite people I follow on twitter are the ones who died years ago.
1308785830832603139 2020-09-23 23:10:32 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @MomTo2Swimmers @AngryRaccoon2 I noticed that too. Maybe it’s schools back in session having to sanitize everything so often? This is me trying to rationalize,  not overreact and buy a case 😅
1307111513510031360 2020-09-19 08:17:24 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> The true supreme  https://t.co/i61zPVom6O

1306604821185736706 2020-09-17 22:43:59 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @StoneAgeRadio13 And so is the toilet paper roll when it’s empty if your family isn’t full of psychopaths 😅
1306583612817637376 2020-09-17 21:19:43 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @CrockettForReal Heyyyy boy it gives me a sense of self worth to not be a floozy on the Internet ;)
1306575730210414592 2020-09-17 20:48:23 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> At least we’re past the part of the pandemic where we only had “basement bathroom toilet paper” and can now have “upstairs toilet paper” again.
1306213168679710722 2020-09-16 20:47:42 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> I’m pretty quick to forgive the way someone treats me, but I’ll burn down everything around me for the way they treated someone else
1305534645531021317 2020-09-14 23:51:29 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> Pretty rude that you’re old and that we’re the same age but ok

1304090051874377730 2020-09-11 00:11:11 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @TheNYAMProject This is the kind of savage parenting I admire
1304033051094274048 2020-09-10 20:24:41 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> Parenting books didn’t tell us what to do if you have a 16 year old kid who shows absolutely no interest in learning to drive a car. Do we breathe a sigh or relief for our insurance rates or get him tested for drugs??
1302944632125288448 2020-09-07 20:19:42 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @sofarrsogud First the Bears QB and now this. You feeling pretty confident about your garage not burning down today, aren’t you? 🤨
1302596051577249794 2020-09-06 21:14:34 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @callmeEvian As if I needed another reason to avoid them 🎺

1301880897474568196 2020-09-04 21:52:48 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> Inside most of us over 40, there’s still an inner child, traumatized by the excitement of movie day at school and then the teacher played “Where the Red Fern Grows”
1301166589719519232 2020-09-02 22:34:24 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> After 6 months of working from home, my family recognizes that if my headphones are on then I’m in a meeting and not to disturb me.    I wonder how long it will take them the figure out now I’m just wearing my headphones as a decoy.
1300869288656543749 2020-09-02 02:53:02 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @CarpeDeann @ess_bee33 Haha my bad I was confused and didn’t want to seem that snobby 😅
1300865703747223556 2020-09-02 02:38:47 +0800 <BoomBoomBetty> @CarpeDeann @ess_bee33 But you’re not following me...? Or were you? 🤷‍♀️
