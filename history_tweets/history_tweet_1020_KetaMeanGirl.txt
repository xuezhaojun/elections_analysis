1344069204597682180 2020-12-30 07:54:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Irusk8 Despite my sperging, I agree that if it‚Äôs racial first, then I‚Äôll approve of it.   The problem is that most Christians are definitively not racialist, even if they say they are.
1344062297027837952 2020-12-30 07:26:37 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Yes, I understand the nuanced differences between these
1344062164542349315 2020-12-30 07:26:06 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Pagang19 @ofKorinth Glad to see you agree with me
1344043628843380737 2020-12-30 06:12:26 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @OfficialMossad Lmfao.   Anyone who says that is just doing deradicalization. Period.
1344036265860194306 2020-12-30 05:43:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth I define spiritual completely differently from you. I see the spirit as ‚Äúgens‚Äù or ‚Äúrace.‚Äù  You ‚Äî 20 tweets in ‚Äî- still can‚Äôt define what you mean.
1344021467646799880 2020-12-30 04:44:23 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth What does ‚Äúspirituality‚Äù mean? Ignorance of the world? Living a Christian monk‚Äôs existence and waiting to die for Jewsus?
1343997691248992260 2020-12-30 03:09:54 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Of what?
1343996777331101698 2020-12-30 03:06:16 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth ‚ÄúSpiritual zenith.‚Äù What does that mean?
1343996588755214338 2020-12-30 03:05:31 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth I think the Black Sea deluge happened. It makes sense that it would be considered a ‚Äúworld flood.‚Äù
1343992344606027776 2020-12-30 02:48:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth There was the Black Sea deluge which likely sparked indoEuropean migrations. That may have been the most original oral story.   However since then it‚Äôs been bastardized into middle eastern ‚Äúlife texts‚Äù by hostile enemies.
1343992070713860096 2020-12-30 02:47:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth I know this is the fallback, which is why I already agreed to let sleeping dogs lie.   You want to read alchemist texts and tell me about ‚Äúspecial potion #17‚Äù which gives me superpowers. But not actually... just metaphysically... meaning not at all.  Agree to disagree.
1343991206964031489 2020-12-30 02:44:08 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth No. Does that change the fact that my earliest ancestors were PIE invaders? Also no.
1343990928290275330 2020-12-30 02:43:02 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth This is the pilpul I‚Äôm talking about. Both stories have floods with a spark a dying and rising motif.  ‚ÄúB-but one had heroes!!!‚Äù  Do you honestly believe humans were so unoriginal that vastly different cultures came up with the same bullshit independently?
1343990466342215687 2020-12-30 02:41:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth What does ‚Äúfully Aryan‚Äù mean Arthur?   PIE theory derived from Boxhorn‚Äôs ‚ÄúScythian theory.‚Äù Later it was replaced with ‚ÄúAryan.‚Äù   I‚Äôm only using the word the way past historians and archaeologists used it.   If you have your own special definition, that‚Äôs for you personally.
1343989681751547904 2020-12-30 02:38:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 @MarkBrahmin is the reason I look up every single world I come across now lol.
1343987839835512832 2020-12-30 02:30:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth Please proceed to list those ‚ÄúAryan myths‚Äù that are oh-so-similar.
1343983332640612354 2020-12-30 02:12:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth Canaanite religions preceded all these other religions. It‚Äôs really not hard. You‚Äôre not following the religion of your true Aryan ancestors. Read Gunther.   The nuanced difference between the Ragnarok flood &amp; Noah‚Äôs flood and L√≠f√ærasir and L√≠f and Adam and Eve is nonsense pilpul
1343979456738820096 2020-12-30 01:57:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth ‚ÄúRead Hesiod.‚Äù ‚ÄúRead Ovid.‚Äù  Thanks for the list of ancient author but what do either of them have to do with the fact that your shitty religion has been altered beyond recognition. Which you admit, yet you still hold water for it.   ‚ÄúGuys.. Odin didn‚Äôt drink semen, I swear‚Äù   ü§£
1343977244277010432 2020-12-30 01:48:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NorthernInvader Mulatta women in space let‚Äôs goooooo
1343845167032360961 2020-12-29 17:03:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Pagang19 @ofKorinth You do realize most Canaanites were Semites, right?
1343839775111995393 2020-12-29 16:42:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth @horoathos If it was "sat in the winds of a blizzard," it wouldn't have been derived from Jewish folklore, so yeah, maybe.
1343820444756017152 2020-12-29 15:25:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth @AlchemicalGold I have no idea what you're saying at this point, Arthur.   But I'm just going to assume you know what I meant by that tweet and we'll call it a day.   I can't behind the magic/mysticism thing. If you think that makes me a reddit atheist, so be it. It doesn't offend me.
1343819602971779072 2020-12-29 15:22:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth @AlchemicalGold So, for example, the vegvisir symbol coming to Iceland from a book pulling from Christian mysticism (read: Judaism) is just an irrelevancy to you?  https://t.co/r1rF9WW07k
1343817959823781888 2020-12-29 15:15:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth @Handsome88Devil @AlchemicalGold None of you can define "magic" or "mysticism" in any concrete way, so it's impossible to get anywhere on this.  The more time you spend worshipping pilpul hullabaloo Jewish esotericists write for you, the less time you spend worshipping your actual ancestors.
1343815720115830784 2020-12-29 15:06:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @AlchemicalGold @ofKorinth @Handsome88Devil Not gonna fight you on that.
1343815141805223936 2020-12-29 15:04:31 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth @AlchemicalGold You and I probably agree on the same definition of spiriit tuality.  For whatever reason, you're cloaking it behind "book of speels" magic stuff that wasn't even core or canon to the original indo-European religion.
1343814193737293827 2020-12-29 15:00:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth @AlchemicalGold I never said that being interested in Old Gods makes anyone a kook. Apollo/Jupiter/Mars are all old Gods.  It's you guys who keep falling back on magical mysticism. It's the same card in the Keith Woods playbook.  10 videos trying to understand "spirituality."  Still no answers.
1343812173466902530 2020-12-29 14:52:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth @AlchemicalGold @Handsome88Devil You people always sound one footstep away from a washed-up celebrity picking up an Aleister Crowley book for the first time.
1343802977665110016 2020-12-29 14:16:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @totally_not_spy @ofKorinth  https://t.co/0lGUMlsg2O
1343793355646447616 2020-12-29 13:37:57 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @AlchemicalGold @ofKorinth Well, using that same logic though, I'm not sure Apollo would be pleased with Odinism.
1343793173907312640 2020-12-29 13:37:13 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @horoathos @ofKorinth Obviously not.   But it is relevant that after the fall of Rome, we were in a spiritual, scientific, and cultural "dark age" that was only revived after the aesthetics of Greece and Rome were revived and reconstructed in art, architecture, and science (the Renaissance).
1343791875338227712 2020-12-29 13:32:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @horoathos @ofKorinth The White race was not restricted to Greece and Rome but Greece and Rome is the "heart" of what we consider today the European White race.  Whatever Whites exists prior or during the Greco and Roman eras are now lost to miscegenation in places like Iran, the Caucasus, and India.
1343791297346338816 2020-12-29 13:29:46 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @AlchemicalGold @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Just noticed your source for this information on Odin is an 18th century Jewish alchemist, Abraham Eleazar.  Refresh my memory again why you people get so offended when we tell you your pagan religion is Semitized?
1343790850720092160 2020-12-29 13:27:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @AlchemicalGold @ofKorinth It produces results in real life that we can see or measure, lol.
1343787862161022976 2020-12-29 13:16:07 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @AlchemicalGold @ofKorinth Then what is the purpose of alchemy? It sounds to me like what preceded chemistry before chemistry was a practice.   If it‚Äôs not, what practical thing has alchemy ever produced?
1343784402908803072 2020-12-29 13:02:22 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @AlchemicalGold @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Alchemy doesn't work. If it does, please make yourself gold and get rich.
1343784150445207552 2020-12-29 13:01:22 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @horoathos @ofKorinth Greco-Roman civilization is the foundation of all European civilization. You don't need to be "Greek" or "Italian" to recognize that, don't be absurd.
1343746515697864711 2020-12-29 10:31:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth There's nothing but materialism when it comes to the value of a religion. You can't talk concretely about aspects that aren't concrete.  There's no reason to think paganism is any more "magical or mystical" than a religion someone invents in their garage. You have no proof.
1343745985860788225 2020-12-29 10:29:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth @horoathos The "hanging himself on a tree" part
1343745222770094082 2020-12-29 10:26:41 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Lemniscatte @BigToneDaBoss lol. I weirdly remember both of these dishes. I must be hungry.  Ceviche is raw fish doe.
1343744137212944385 2020-12-29 10:22:22 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Lemniscatte @BigToneDaBoss What about seafood? Ceviche?
1343742168234668032 2020-12-29 10:14:33 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Lemniscatte @BigToneDaBoss That looks delicious too. Whats the problem with both?
1343740751478403073 2020-12-29 10:08:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Lemniscatte @BigToneDaBoss I like the dishes you post on here but this is a bad take. Raw beef is delicious too -- steak tartare yum ü§§
1343719652652888064 2020-12-29 08:45:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @ofKorinth My race is my religion.  I believe in worshipping my ancestors and the idealized perfect figure that embodies them is my God. As of now, Apollo is a good figure for that, though the name may change over time as we construct and re-construct our myths.
1343719110954414080 2020-12-29 08:42:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @ofKorinth Christianity and Paganism is not goofy and idiosyncratic lol?   You're just stuck in the idea that b/c some of your dumb Semitized ancestors bought hook, line, and sinker into a religion, you have to too.
1343713300190781440 2020-12-29 08:19:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @ofKorinth Not an atheist. An atheist is a Christian lol.
1343710979713073152 2020-12-29 08:10:37 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @horoathos @ofKorinth "Perennial themes"  Sure. Why are so many of these themes lame, weak, and demoralizing then? Just no reason?
1343708738222436352 2020-12-29 08:01:42 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Again. You're sort of justifying the premise. Which I know, deep down, you understand.
1343708541878677504 2020-12-29 08:00:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Even if you don't want to subscribe to that, you admitted we need reconstruction. That's going to change the whole basis of paganism.
1343708019125846017 2020-12-29 07:58:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Why would we have myths where our Gods get cucked, have h*m*sexual affairs and such? Why would these exist?
1343707817593724931 2020-12-29 07:58:03 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth @Handsome88Devil Odinists.
1343706468487487488 2020-12-29 07:52:41 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth So you think all the ghey and cuckoldry myths are chill and part of canon?  Why would anyone want that in their religion?
1343705658307325952 2020-12-29 07:49:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Um, many are. And we admit to that. Which is why we're seeking to reconstruct and re-invent them.
1343704857652449280 2020-12-29 07:46:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth Do you not see the entire point then?  If the original pagan lore is lost, destroyed, altered -- then why are you all go so looney when we say it is now Semitized.   You're practically admitting to it.
1343704168691888135 2020-12-29 07:43:33 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Handsome88Devil @ofKorinth I've already said a million times I'm willing to hear that but none of you can tell me what the original story of Odin is then.  "Well, it was oral tradition."  Okay, then you don't know it. So now what? Where do we go from here?
1343694296051019778 2020-12-29 07:04:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ofKorinth Now explain why his story is nearly identical to that of Jewsus.

1343687671256915969 2020-12-29 06:37:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @BassForte1 There's nothing wrong with colonialism. In fact, every non-White is a spiritual gimp and constantly demands to be dominated and ruled-over by Whites despite their pretenses.

1343671229383901191 2020-12-29 05:32:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Can't wait to be lectured to about how our "petty anti-Semitism" is problematic b/c China is philo-Semitic and Republican-deployed anti-Semitic anime-avatar accounts might successfully gaslight us into shilling for war with China...  ...or some similar such de-radicalization.  https://t.co/2H3oc7ex4s

1343401121805717505 2020-12-28 11:39:21 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chompinatorics @Apollo_Returns You just told me all the REAL Norse pagan myths were oral tradition.  Therefore, you have no fucking clue what they were.   The word "religious" has the base "legere" in it, which means to "read."   The only relevant part of your religion is one that's written and known.
1343359473952370688 2020-12-28 08:53:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chompinatorics @Apollo_Returns If it‚Äôs oral, you have absolutely no idea what the original myths were unless they were literally told you and you didn‚Äôt write them down for millenia until the modern day. lmfao.

1342913363408527361 2020-12-27 03:21:10 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Lemniscatte Confusing. Where are the Algerians and Africans that were also part of the French ethnos, per Macron?

So you're cool with Somalians in your neighborhood as long as they convert, right?  If not, why are you blaspheming the word of God?  https://t.co/n98VIudQjw

Why are world historians kowtowing to them?   Also, orgs like the ADL spend millions to "remind of the Holocaust" all the fucking time.
1342261889632497664 2020-12-25 08:12:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @TedwardWang Total nonsense. Janissaries were usually White Europeans.  They just had the hots for them themselves.

1342130737231835136 2020-12-24 23:31:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> In case anyone doubts my argument that ‚ÄúInceldom‚Äù has been fashioned by the media complex as a means of cracking down on white, socially or politically-activated men, look at the way Wikipedia and the SPLC defines it below.

How many men in such a workplace have reported sexual harassment or getting propositioned vs how many women?   Who gets the microaggressions more?

1341834813976657920 2020-12-24 03:55:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay If she's in professional competition with men in her industr and bringing home the "bread," she's assuming the social role of a man.  How she juggles that with a relationship differs from person to person, with some women handling it a lot better than others.

1341774112658579456 2020-12-23 23:54:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @usualsnooping It‚Äôs considered one of the best indie movies of the year.   Target audience? Exactly. No one.   Jewish intellectuals in Manhattan‚Äôs Lincoln Center.
1341773897092407296 2020-12-23 23:53:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> tl;dr ‚Äî Inceldom is a ghey-op. The incel gag was an ironic online joke that the media has since weaponized and made serious. Men and women are both suffering from this Piss Earth society‚Äôs perspective on sexual dynamics and its relationship to gender roles/labor
1341773896316375041 2020-12-23 23:53:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> This will erode casual sex culture which, in turn, erodes even the notion of an ‚Äúincel‚Äù as a thing.
1341773895532126208 2020-12-23 23:53:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Women who choose to forgo relationships and remain on this ‚Äúdole‚Äù will eventually (by natural virtue of their catty peers) become socially ostracized and shamed. This is the best encouragement they can have to not become mentally-ill spinsters.
1341773894726737921 2020-12-23 23:53:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Women can be single for a period of time and still be socially/financially supported as they look for a mate and develop their personalities and interests. With this, they don‚Äôt have to sell their souls (and bodies) for corporate crumbs or jump into potentially bad relationships.
1341773893892096001 2020-12-23 23:53:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> The solution is to reject the ‚Äúwomen have to LARP as men‚Äù paradigm. They don‚Äôt. They should not be expected to. It breeds resentment and strange sexual dynamics. One solution can be found in the ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù part of national socialism.
1341773892990369792 2020-12-23 23:53:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Brad Pitt gets humiliated on a plane by his ex-wife &amp; mystery meat son. Clooney is divorced from some sub-par shitskin. Elon Musk simped hard for fucking Amber Heard, and the richest man in the world is dating what looks like a Brazilian MtoF. What‚Äôs wrong? Just not alpha enough?
1341773892168212480 2020-12-23 23:53:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> The sexual marketplace in 2020 is run by women. Women decide who they will date, marry, and procreate with. Not men. And no, ‚Äúalpha men‚Äù don‚Äôt change this truth. Some of the most alpha personalities we can think of are divorced or single in their 40s/50s.
1341773891308376065 2020-12-23 23:53:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> How can a man love and support a woman who bends over (metaphorically or not) for her J3wish boss? How is there even time to have mutually fulfilling life experiences and get to know a partners if you‚Äôre both busy making money for the shareholders? It‚Äôs absurd.
1341773890507341826 2020-12-23 23:53:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> This is unimaginably difficult b/c it ignores the social dynamics of men and women completely. Men demand respect while women demand love and support. How can a ‚Äúboss bitch‚Äù woman respect a man who makes less money and/or is her subordinate?
1341773889639129090 2020-12-23 23:53:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> What this ‚Äúincel‚Äù thing achieves is it hides that the massive burden on the shoulders of women. Women are told that they have to self-actualize in two ways: forge careers strong enough to compete with strong men &amp; maintain healthy romantic relationships with those same strong men
1341773888821186561 2020-12-23 23:53:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Additionally the ‚Äúalpha dog‚Äù dog dominance theory has been debunked. It is now a specious metaphor. Our nerdy-looking grandpas did not use game to marry our grandmas. Rather, they lived in a healthier society where social roles were well-defined and ppl helped ppl couple up.
1341773888028438528 2020-12-23 23:53:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Getting asked out on the street (cat-calling) or in the workplace (harassment) is a modern faux pas. And for good reason. Such attention confuses professionalism and courtship. Rejecting co-workers and peers makes all further social interaction resented. So where is this ‚Äúthere?‚Äù
1341773887218970625 2020-12-23 23:53:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> The Caducean sells impressionable men on GAME with cliches like ‚Äújust get out there‚Äù despite the fact that there is no ‚Äúthere‚Äù to get out into. Bars are no longer places to meet healthy people. Social clubs do not exist (at least not for gentiles). Did @benshapiro use game? ü§£
1341773886422061057 2020-12-23 23:53:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Instead of actually addressing why relationships are failing and why the difficulties of the sexual marketplace seem insurmountable for some, the media tells you it‚Äôs b/c you men are not ‚Äúalpha enough.‚Äù Lack of community and social solidarity? Nah. Not alpha enough. Small peepee.
1341773885553876993 2020-12-23 23:53:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Sexual humiliation is part of ZOG‚Äôs playbook. We already know they do this via Epstein. It‚Äôs also clear when they have certain politicians under their thumb (ladybugs, foam parties, bear cyclops). It‚Äôs meant to deeply shame someone. The ‚Äúincel‚Äù thing is no different.
1341773884308168704 2020-12-23 23:53:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Remember, Hitler‚Äôs actions were the product of his ‚Äúhaving 1 ball and a micropenis.‚Äù Similarly, the J-media uses people‚Äôs relationship problems to label them as ‚Äúweirdos‚Äù who can‚Äôt snag a walking-talking fleshlight. ‚ÄúHaha virgin loser doesnt sexually exploit broken women. Loser!‚Äù
1341773883507003392 2020-12-23 23:53:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> If you‚Äôre in the DR and you unironically use the term ‚Äúincel,‚Äù you‚Äôve fallen for a media-promoted ghey-op designed specifically to make young men (especially white men) seem like ticking time bombs; their political and social concerns to be filed away as psychosomatic.

1341715661890863104 2020-12-23 20:01:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @benshapiro's mother was a Hollywood executive for TV and his cousin a leading child actor in the 90s,  but rest assured, inherited wealth and social connections is just a canard.

1340524244225015809 2020-12-20 13:07:40 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @BlurmpfG There's incentive to be like this. It helps girls who don't hold strong opinions on things.

1340335155517349888 2020-12-20 00:36:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @BlurmpfG It‚Äôs a reaction to valley girl vapidity and gullibility, but while the dopeyness may go, the vapidity remains.

Some WN point out that Uyghurs are whiTER than Han Chinese b/c they might have Tocharian DNA.

1337563529344241666 2020-12-12 09:02:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Yes. The ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚ÄùJews‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù are manipulated by the billionaire goyim, driven by petty spite Hearst has b/c Sinclair wrote bad press about him once.  That‚Äôs the only motivation folx!!!  Louis = bad, misguided Jew  Mank = good Jew  Hearst = evil  At least the two serpents are out front
1337563528425664512 2020-12-12 09:02:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> The film also has an amazing Caducean storyline. The gist....   SPOILERS   ... is that Mank is a true ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù working-class advocate who opposed Hearst conspiring to ruin the election of good-hearted goy socialist Upton Sinclair by using Louis B Mayer to produce propaganda.
1337563527578415105 2020-12-12 09:02:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> The Finchers are shabbos goyim and it‚Äôs clear in this film they worship Jews (or at least pay taxes to them). The film shows all the ‚Äúbrilliant writers‚Äù of 1940s Hollywood and they‚Äôre all exoteric Jews ‚Äî Hecht, Perelman, Kaufman ‚Äî who use words like ‚Äúhick‚Äù and make poop-sex jokes
1337563524856381441 2020-12-12 09:02:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> The film is written by David Fincher‚Äôs father Jack Fincher (weirdly enough) as his ‚Äúdream screenplay.‚Äù ü§î  Oldman is charming but the narrative painfully cliche. It gives no true insight into what inspired Citizen Kane‚Äôs story other than it being a petty ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to Hearst.  https://t.co/QEmWNy8cLj
1337563517965103104 2020-12-12 09:02:48 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Just finished Mank (2020).   This was clearly Gary Oldman‚Äôs penance for having criticized Jews.  He plays Herman Mankiewicz, an alcoholic but ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù Jewish writer.   The film solely exists to promote Mankiewicz as the true genius behind Citizen Kane and Orson Welles as grug.  https://t.co/fA8OxBbKiS

Both Fields and Rittenhouse are non-Whites, both seem dopey, and yet both are innocent. The last part is the only important part in this discussion.

Fields was LARPing too, to a lesser extent.   "He shouldn't have been there b/c it was inviting violence" is the same type of argument screeching liberals used to justify the suffering of Charlottesville folk.

If the Solutreans did manage to cross the Atlantic, then they were of Old European stock, and not Aryan/IE anyway.  This might explain why there really was no civilization building in the Americas ever.

I want to keep Christmas but strip it of Christ, Christianity, and all non-IE pagan elements.   Change the literal form but retain its "spiritual" (gens) feel.

Totally equivalent!

The people who run cover for Jews are the ones who say their power is only derived from their religion, which is what that tweet is criticizing.
1335358120751558656 2020-12-06 06:59:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty No. You're taking my very normal critique of this fantasy 1Struggle thing and extrapolating to say I'm a neocon b/c of some internet clique meme you've ingested.  1Struggle hasn't actually thought about reality. Racial conflicts are normal and inherent. Jews just stoke the fires.

If you don't want to live together with non-Whites, you need to have Whites in power. You're asking for White nationalist leadership.   1Struggle will permit that how?

Good luck getting all the minority groups that hate Whites with a passion to 1Struggle against Jews, only to learn you expect gentile Whites to either a) rule over them afterward or b) deport them.  I'll wear the dunce cap once that happens and I'll be proven wrong.
1335354201367433216 2020-12-06 06:43:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @PeakyOswald @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty Then you seem to have no problem with multicultural societies. In that case, America is fine. A Muslim Paris is fine too. Kind of ideal tbh. What are you even complaining about?
1335353716262629376 2020-12-06 06:41:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @PeakyOswald @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty So Blacks will deport themselves from America to live in a little Black ethnostate somewhere?  Hilarious delusion.
1335353409336045568 2020-12-06 06:40:37 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty Poland minus International Jewish Influence is just a little powerless white ethnostate.  You people are struggling to overthrow Jews. Great. Let's say it happens. Then you have no answer as to what happens to all the multicultural societies on the planet.
1335353028224794625 2020-12-06 06:39:06 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty You people haven't thought through what happens after this fantasy of black-brown-yellow alliance overthrows Jews. Then what? All the minorities accept their white overlords?   It's fine. But since you haven't, it's not a serious political agenda.
1335352213565100032 2020-12-06 06:35:52 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty So... after Jews are gone, everyone will be like "based" Poland?  White Nationalism --&gt; 1Struggle ---&gt; Petty White Nationalism ?
1335351774471843840 2020-12-06 06:34:07 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty The answer to "who rules" is "people" so okay, we can't go further.
1335351467092312065 2020-12-06 06:32:54 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ohgodmuhbrains @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty So 1Struggle minorities will 1Struggle hard to get rid of Jews and then lay back and relax as Whites rule over them?  Gotcha.  I mean it's not like minorities already had absolutely ZERO support for pro-White activism.
1335350607792631808 2020-12-06 06:29:29 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty Still not answering the question of who rules after Jews are removed.  There's no such thing as a leadership vacuum. Someone will take that position. If you want it to be "Whites," then say it.
1335350320503767040 2020-12-06 06:28:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ohgodmuhbrains @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty Why is this a difficult question for you people? Who RULES after evicting Jews?  If your answer is "Whites," then you're telling non-Whites to go fuck themselves.  If your answer is "both," then you are secret deracinated egalitarians.
1335349625285300225 2020-12-06 06:25:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ApollonianValor @LeviCoult 1Struggle has zero merits. You're living in delusion.
1335349110916845569 2020-12-06 06:23:32 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ohgodmuhbrains @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty Yeah. I mean... it's not Whites have ever had problems with non-Whites in the past.
1335348662956744704 2020-12-06 06:21:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty Um.... Yes. Who rules once Jews are overthrown?  You just 1Struggled to get rid of Jews in leadership positions. Are minorities now going to accept White leadership? ü§£ü§£ü§£  Did you guys actually think this through?
1335347210406350848 2020-12-06 06:15:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty So 1Struggle just wants to align with people who hate one another and see eachother as "not based?"   Once Jews are overthrown, what happens then?  I'm not over-simplifying. I'm clarifying.
1335345654898458625 2020-12-06 06:09:48 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult @TheOldSalty But there are based members of every other ethnicity/race to 1Struggle with... just not Jews.

1335344694973222915 2020-12-06 06:05:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult Why can't 1Struggle accept "based Jews" who are against Zionist infilitration?   I don't see why that's a contradictory idea if WN is just a gateway to a 'bigger tent' struggle.
1335344201576267778 2020-12-06 06:04:01 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult So at what point does 1Struggle accept Jews?
1335343478490841088 2020-12-06 06:01:09 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @SauceyFlossy The "message" is just the propaganda ideal. Literature is the style of transferring the propaganda. Literary devices (metaphors, personifications, allegories, syntax, etc) is what makes literature literature.

1335342346456551425 2020-12-06 05:56:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult I would rather say it's the "escape hatch."

1335341876434456576 2020-12-06 05:54:47 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @SauceyFlossy "the point of teaching literature at all is in the message, not the medium."  No it's not lol.

1335331914639572992 2020-12-06 05:15:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult refuse to ever do that. I've done a high dose of melatonin once and even that fucked me up.

1335325257113116673 2020-12-06 04:48:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @SauceyFlossy Yes it does. We‚Äôre talking about literature.

"I'm AckShually InGuSh"   Gets tiresome. Circassians should have just Serbed them into their own YugoCaucasia.
1335131469350543360 2020-12-05 15:58:42 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner @DavidColeStein Well, he DID deny Babi Yar. I don't know if he walked that back.
1335130510016671744 2020-12-05 15:54:53 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @SauceyFlossy Popol Vuh is only literature because it was WRITTEN DOWN. The etymology of the word "literature" implies "book." Oral stories don't count as literature.   As for the Ramayana. Yeah sure, but, again, it was WRITTEN as LITERATURE in Sanskrit.  Otherwise it would be anthropology.
1335129615610757120 2020-12-05 15:51:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner @DavidColeStein Didn't know that about Hunt. Oof.

The problem is a lot of Caucasians find themselves opposed to Europe as an entity. They voluntarily don‚Äôt seem themselves as white... with maybe the exception of Georgians

1334969920451268609 2020-12-05 05:16:46 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> This nibba tries to flex on ‚Äúclassic white literature‚Äù by listing 4 ethnic works ‚Äî one written by Sanskrit-speaking Aryans (Ramayana), another by a literal white Spaniard (Popoo Vuh), and the third a Japanese scribbling so indecipherable not even the Japanese can understand it.  https://t.co/CkW4qERLqx

1334938845868032001 2020-12-05 03:13:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @hermetik_gavcho Kind of an unusual flex. Complaining about Apollonians acting ‚Äúreasonable and logical‚Äù while braggadociously exclaiming you believe in something illogical and unreasonable.

1334934440238170112 2020-12-05 02:55:47 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @HenrikvTeuton @ArthurPrydain Islam is a religion designed for the ‚Äúgruggiest‚Äù members of the White race, or the most average members of non-White races.
1334934405043798016 2020-12-05 02:55:38 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArthurPrydain They‚Äôre Hurrians historically. Not from the Indo-European diaspora, which I consider a *fundamental* genetic marker that distinguishes white from non-White.  They are admixed in the same way Latinos are admixed. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs merely their religion.
1334932213893275648 2020-12-05 02:46:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @hermetik_gavcho Define mysticism. What does that even mean? Can you people ever not be mealymouthed?
1334928532670009347 2020-12-05 02:32:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Just look for the Elvira types that are passably White. Got yourself a Caucasian.   Caucasians aren‚Äôt Aryan but they are like Aryan cousins. Most are pretty admixed with Aryans though. It‚Äôs why Boston Bomber was a panty dropper (for some weirdos).

1334579387534962688 2020-12-04 03:24:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> I'm a late-20s Millenial and have been learning about "Black inventions" religiously since the literal 90s.  WTF are these people talking about?

1334575899136561152 2020-12-04 03:11:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @3pRevolt ahhh... true true.   Police were being racist a lot and pulling him over and giving him stupid jail sentence for stuff like weed.  I hate how racist America is. Can't wait to leave this place and go to more liberal and open countries like Canada or Sweden.
1334575299049078784 2020-12-04 03:08:41 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @3pRevolt Can anyone explain why he grew up to be a criminal?   I thought having a poor education and no aspirations led to criminality. Doesnt education and culturally sensitive teaching solve all racial disparities?? ????

1334336871195807745 2020-12-03 11:21:15 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult I feel bad for teasing her sometimes.
1334322092255272962 2020-12-03 10:22:31 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @LeviCoult Hey now. Both are acceptable.

1334274010180276227 2020-12-03 07:11:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay Yes. It indoctrinates them, but there are clear lines some people cross and some don‚Äôt.

1334268724082139136 2020-12-03 06:50:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson @FinnyWay @hateisbad1 The reason they called it 1950s/1960s counter culture is because it‚Äôs a move away from the ‚Äúnorms.‚Äù All you have to do is look at statistical data for ‚Äúaverage number of partners‚Äù to see the giant change.   And no, they weren‚Äôt all hiding their orgy numbers.

1334263983012921344 2020-12-03 06:31:37 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay @hateisbad1 Does our movement support porn watching?  From what I've seen, we are decidedly ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY in every way.  On the other hand, here we have someone pulling the "gangbang is not a big deal" card.
1334257244972584961 2020-12-03 06:04:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @MarkBrahmin @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 Thanks for clearing that up Mark. It was a small bit of confusion early on just b/c I always associated "red" with "Jewish" but it's more "vulnerable to judaifying."
1334247063341580288 2020-12-03 05:24:23 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @MarkBrahmin @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 Is the name "Adam" a Jewish signifier right? I think one of the JEM articles written by someone else was using it as an Aryan signifier. The "red" color symbolism would indicate admixture?

I also don't think degenerate men regularly seeking the services of prostitutes should be treated any better.  https://t.co/hYNes6qCYr

1334213562458247168 2020-12-03 03:11:16 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @hateisbad1 How many of our grandmothers participated in a gangbang, @hateisbad1 ?   Did yours?   Or was she too oppressed by the patriarchy for that?
1334022200911753217 2020-12-02 14:30:52 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @frater_aspire Jews consider converts a "lesser class." I would just pretend my ancestors were Jews in such a case.  If one is dark-haired enough, it's passable.

Coincidentally, almost all those sonderkommando ]ews happened to be from Greece.  I guess that particular brand of ]ew is really good at closing doors.

The fact that no one could even articulate Dugin's positions (and still can't) says all you need to know about him. He's as empty as a neoliberal shill like Levy.

I couldn't give a shit about some Australian internet nerd.   He's built nothing. Done nothing. Yet he's King Fwen to some perpetually-online internet clique.  Even clowns like Asha Logos have done more than fucking Tyrone.

"It comes from a place of resentment, therefore it is invalid" is some post-modern neo-speak "love everyone" nonsense that even some alt-right e-Celebs were vomiting for a while.

That was from the podcast shortly after he was doxxed and it was revealed his wife was a mischling.  The comments are in reference to his wife.   "If we're talking purist, then I have to go" = my wife is Jewish.

They do the same thing with the Islamic caliphates, Ancient India, and other past primitive societies.
1330332437738471425 2020-11-22 10:09:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Obrgrupnfrolfer @almightygenie Same here. Rittenhouse could be black as night and I'd still be a "shill" for him.  Him being White, of course, or mischling-b3aner w/e, just makes my support more vocal.   No, I'm not a Republican or conservative. This is unrelated.

Christianity preaches egalitarianism, sacrifice, and worships death. Do you disagree? If so, show me where in Christian doctrine it preaches the opposite.

1330285724457979906 2020-11-22 07:03:26 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Commienaahzie @bespokecommie Because Christianitiy is, at its very core, a worldview for weak losers. It not only says this outright, it embodies it in every single aspect of its coda.

1330205656343834628 2020-11-22 01:45:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @J_Ladarc His opinion was its best to just NOT get the virus period.  For something like a pandemic, he'd probably support a vaccine lol.
1330205624538460161 2020-11-22 01:45:09 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @J_Ladarc He was a bit of an eccentric, but supposedly the way they "deactivate" the virus in a vaccine is not always adequate enough, and giving young children vaccines early is forcing a "lesser" form of the virus on them, the outcome of which we don't know for some young people.
1330202819295662080 2020-11-22 01:34:00 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @J_Ladarc I'm pretty anti-vaxx. Indoctrinated from birth by physican grandfather who refused to have any of his kids or grandkids vaxxed lol.

1330187412060983297 2020-11-22 00:32:47 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay I understand. You think feminism precedes politics and so it shepherds women to the left b/c of this misunderstanding.   I guess, in the end, the left/right thing feels so dead to me that I can't help but care if it does that.
1330186989367406592 2020-11-22 00:31:06 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Pr0pagandaWorks The "Pwease pwease pwease don't sue me" virus.
1330185425357590534 2020-11-22 00:24:53 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay And even if it is a "right wing" idea, I don't see how that has any bearing on the fact that today it is universally seen as "left wing." Popular consensus might be wrong, sure, and so what?   This honestly just feels like a "label."

1329586478326792192 2020-11-20 08:44:53 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser @MarkBrahmin This pants-on-head meme that China and Iran just act like little shits to "loL TroLl ZoG-AmERiCa" is the dumbest cope I've ever heard.  Yes, they hate our Jewish run government. But they hate you too, idiot Whitey.
1329586057365491712 2020-11-20 08:43:13 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser @MarkBrahmin So if we had a government that withdrew all troops from the Middle East and broke all diplomatic ties with Israel, all of a sudden the Ayatollah would shut up and support a White supremacist gov, even if our blacks  were screaming about being oppressed? All forgiven?  Sure thing.

How many Chinese-run international organizations are there that come and help struggling Whites addicted to drugs?  None. All these people are X-supremacists. They have no interest in working with you White cattle.
1329583909953171457 2020-11-20 08:34:41 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser @MarkBrahmin Iran has a Persian-Supremacist-run government. We do not have a White-Supremacist-run government.  We would not assasinate Soleimani. They STILL tweet about innocent Whites killing blacks in the street like dogs.  This "We KEeL DeM" nonsense is tiresome. Get better material.
1329583012887941121 2020-11-20 08:31:07 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser @MarkBrahmin lol. Why shouldn't China and Iran support Whites' right to disassociate from minorities? Why not? You're making it seem like this is cRaZy yet there's no reason for it to be.  All I see is China and Iran making public statements stoking violence against Whites.
1329581537436700675 2020-11-20 08:25:15 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser @MarkBrahmin Mealy-mouthed bullshit. There is "common struggle." Minorities benefit from this system.   Find my a non-White group with political or social power that supports the White man's right to freely associate away from minorities.   You can't. It doesn't exist.
1329581006924378113 2020-11-20 08:23:09 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> If "race idolatry" or "obsessing over race" bothers you, you can just move to a "trad" town in Bumfuck and vote Libertarian.  You know who obsesses over race 10x more than a White Imperialist?   Every non-White in the world. They hate you and love themselves. Learn from them.
1329577838186426370 2020-11-20 08:10:33 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser @MarkBrahmin Go find me a single non-White activism group that supports White's "freedom of association." Then get back to me.

1329315841234456577 2020-11-19 14:49:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ioxexqen_marzi I'm not. Be a Phoenician. It's just not very Euro of you.
1329314393901789189 2020-11-19 14:43:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ioxexqen_marzi Yeah. I don‚Äôt consider Persians white either, but at least they‚Äôre not desert dwellers like your precious Shasu camel jockeys.
1329314035314016256 2020-11-19 14:42:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ioxexqen_marzi That‚Äôs debatable. Only 1 study ever suggests that and it‚Äôs Eran Elhaik‚Äôs, and even his study implies the earliest Jews were already Semites living in Anatolia.  https://t.co/7CnusjFOY1  It‚Äôs best not to venture down this road with that level of overconfidence.
1329313210931974146 2020-11-19 14:39:01 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ioxexqen_marzi Persians weren‚Äôt Semites. Ancient Persians were Indo-Aryan derived. If you want to associate yourself with Semites that‚Äôs fine.
1329301817696481286 2020-11-19 13:53:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ioxexqen_marzi Their genetic studies put half their DNA from the Middle or Near East. Whether it‚Äôs from maternal or paternal ancestry is strangely debatable because Jewish studies are highly controversial.   Sephardic Jews are definitely linked to the Canaan or North Africa. What is your point?
1329301035534336004 2020-11-19 13:50:38 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ioxexqen_marzi Phoenicians are genetically linked to the Canaan. Their Gods were Semitic gods, linked closely with Hebraic equivalents. Over centuries, European admixture happened to create Punic city-states.   This doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they are Semitic derived.

1328330790665478144 2020-11-16 21:35:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> This is wrong, per @DavidColeStein, b/c 900,000 Jews were gassed at Treblinka and their ashes are still there. That‚Äôs why Aktion Reinhardt couldn‚Äôt have anything to do with rearmament, but with genocide. Even if it was about that, it was just a cover for genocide anyway.
1328330789746999296 2020-11-16 21:35:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Here is scum denier German Rudolf explaining how most recovered documents consider it a plunder scheme.  https://t.co/srcBYgQw3E
1328330788971024385 2020-11-16 21:35:13 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> This has to be the case b/c scum deniers think Aktion Reinhardt is not named after Heydrich at all, but rather after the finance minister, Fritz Reinhardt.  But this would mean that Aktion Reinhardt was an economic revitalization policy and nothing to do with genocide. Impossible
1328330786731216897 2020-11-16 21:35:13 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Here is an explanation about the misspelling from the official Sobibor website. This makes perfect sense now. Reinhard was anxious to appear Aryan so he started spelling‚Ä¶ his‚Ä¶ given name (??)‚Ä¶ differently‚Ä¶ b/c of a misprint‚Ä¶ but then tried to change it back‚Ä¶  but couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶  https://t.co/oshyVAP16q
1328330783304544257 2020-11-16 21:35:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> See, Reinhard Heydrich was born and baptized ‚ÄúReinhard‚Äù and -dt often signifies a surname. But the plan was nonetheless named after him b/c he really hated Jews and the Nazis wanted to honor his Jew hatred. Plus, Nazis decided to use his given name, not surname, because why not?  https://t.co/z6fBUyiVAA
1328330779886141440 2020-11-16 21:35:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Orthodox Holocaust historians claim the secret genocide operation, Aktion Reinhardt, is named in honor of Reinhard Heydrich. However, many documents misspell the operation as Reinhard(t), including private letters &amp; diary entries. But Nazis were notoriously dumb &amp; bad spellers!  https://t.co/t33dvXm6wU

1326677331545448448 2020-11-12 08:04:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson This is true and I can see that potentially being the case.
1326674316176596996 2020-11-12 07:53:00 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson Yes. If it is an op then it‚Äôs through some legal bind they have him in.

1326669586264059905 2020-11-12 07:34:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson Yeah. I get it. I don't believe he's genuine in this particular case.   But it's not impossible is all I'm saying, given how it started.

1326668641413132289 2020-11-12 07:30:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson Look. The PB as it stands now is not what it was when it first started brewing. There was no official leadership.  This Based Stick Man thing is probably nonsense and not true at all. But It wasn't always explicitly civnat. There were all kinds of chapters that were unsupervised.
1326667709526941697 2020-11-12 07:26:44 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson Gavin had to do a "clean up" and then it got a lot civicnatty and Filipino.   Not saying Based Stick Man is based. He's probably not. But this isn't as shocking as you might think.
1326667271385669632 2020-11-12 07:25:00 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson It wasn't that explicit when it first started. I, unfortunately, knew people who were Gavin fans when Gavin first started the PBs and it was extremely unsupervised and full of altright-leaning types. Mike Enoch can attest to this too, as the PB NYC chapter was friendly with TRS.
1326665553470136320 2020-11-12 07:18:10 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @brandonadamson This isn‚Äôt necessarily true. There were a lot of PB people that were altright friendly.

1325313041781592065 2020-11-08 13:43:46 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> In reality, it seems to present numerous non-Germanic groups as "Aryans," including Finns, Croatians, Spaniards, Italians, Bulgarians, Pomeranians (Poles), Greeks, Hungarians... and warns against the "ruin" of these peoples by the Bolsheviks.

One of the leading etymologies for the name "Odin" is the Semitic "Adon" (lord). Also proven to be Adon=Adonis.  Adon/Ba'al(Ba'al-zer) = Odin/Baldur  You don't have to believe it. But some thinkers do.

But even if we were to completely DISMISS Dumezial, Odin as a "non-European" later-development God is a rather common thesis.

I'm pretty sure @Apollo_Returns means "magic" as in -- primitive or archaic descriptions of terrestrial world phenomena as being caused or influenced by extra-dimensional beings/forces -- AKA, levitating rabbis.
1321846730808152065 2020-10-30 00:09:54 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay @Apollo_Returns Again, I might agree with you if I knew how you're defining "magic."   I don't see how a philosopher's naming conventions and the traditional definition of 'magic' -- defined as: "belief in worldly events or actions instigated by supernatural forces or beings" -- are related.
1321845764964798464 2020-10-30 00:06:03 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @476_1453 I agree.
1321845201363611648 2020-10-30 00:03:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay Okay, but that's just the name a philosopher gave to a pre-consciousness stage in his theory of consciousness. What does that have to do with the @Apollo_Returns 's tweet?
1321843151443615745 2020-10-29 23:55:40 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @476_1453 For being true?
1321841209506062344 2020-10-29 23:47:57 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FinnyWay What does this mean? What is your definition of "magic" ?

1321783190382501888 2020-10-29 19:57:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @BloorisJohn Quite the opposite. I agree with what you tweeted.
1321782580782395392 2020-10-29 19:54:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @BloorisJohn Once again. No idea what you're talking about.  You post about "Apollonian hate" yet tweet out their positions and world outlook. That's why I'm asking what your position is.
1321781768874127361 2020-10-29 19:51:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @BloorisJohn I'm asking you a position. Do you admit to not having one?
1321780973793468416 2020-10-29 19:48:36 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @BloorisJohn Can't really follow you. You seem to agree with Apollonians on most of this stuff yet seem confused otherwise.

It's a healthy way of being pro-Black though it's based on fabrications mostly.   A "white hotep/snowtep" is a slur used against ppl who aren't clueless about the history of Europe and the Near East lol.
1320172357017714688 2020-10-25 09:16:32 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @PalaceTheron Depends on the kind. A white one or a black one?

Just minus the anti-Semitism, racism, and mysogyny, that was all embellished to make fun of non-Jews by Cohen.  https://t.co/hPDtzCBMhe

It was the first time in history theaters were showing screenings 24-hours-a-day.

It would seem all we've been doing is asserting this.   You're getting fed misinformation or guilt by tangential association.

1318074427376979969 2020-10-19 14:20:06 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 THIS PISSES ME OFF SO FUCKING MUCH AHAHAHA  I'm not Romanian but I can imagine its as annoying as some fucking dumb Anglo saying they hate the Romanian immigrants when they're totally clueless they're dealing with Roma gypsies.
1318073701242261505 2020-10-19 14:17:13 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 It's from years of being asked if my Slavic ancestors were Jews.

1318072884925849600 2020-10-19 14:13:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 That's a rabbithole I went down many times.  I made a long thread on identifying Jews in Russia b/c Anna Khachiyan was pissing me off lol   https://t.co/uhk6Jip8El  Yet still Grigori Sokolnikov would escape my test -- b/c its crypsis x10000
1318071752505741312 2020-10-19 14:09:29 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 Harry Houdini another -- though he took an Italian surname.
1318071162266472449 2020-10-19 14:07:08 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 ü§£Yup.  On a similar note, the worst crypsis I've come seen is Hungarian Jews. Jews born "Grossman" change their kids names into something as Hungarian as like "Laszlo Nagy" (practically John Smith) -- and you never know.  Zsa Zsa Gabor is a good exampel off the top of my head.
1318069931150241792 2020-10-19 14:02:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 Actually, I thought all the Austrian school were Jews. It turns out none were. Just German surnames.   https://t.co/JHUzNB0xKZ
1318069611997274113 2020-10-19 14:00:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 I hate it.  I thought Oskar Morgenstern was a Jew when I was reading about libertardism.   I'm just conditioned to see certain names and assume Jew.
1318066866875592704 2020-10-19 13:50:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Emelianenko1889 Absolutely flabbergasted. üòê

It's similar to Christians who are retroactively justifying depictions of Jesus as blonde/blue-eyed and saying "Oh, if he existed, he maybe DID look like that since the Levant wasn't Arabic yet."   It's just coping ad infinitum.
1318013541517987840 2020-10-19 10:18:10 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns The Romans identified many through Roman Interpretation.   But, as for derived Gods...  https://t.co/ynz7GVdFz1
1318012859264028673 2020-10-19 10:15:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns So you admit the relationship between Baldur and "Ba'al - zer" -- Ba'al is a Phoencian God.   Then what about Adon/Odin/Adonis?   Why would Christian shoehorn this in? Isn't it rather possible there was cultural transmission and adaptation?
1318012179866480641 2020-10-19 10:12:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns Exactly.  The same can be said of many, many, many cultures. Which is why we can identify certain Gods as being derivations or "culturally influenced" from non-European sources.
1318011718400839680 2020-10-19 10:10:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns @elfvillage2 You're preaching to the choir that Hellenic Egypt had a lot of Euros. But that doesnt change anything.
1318011424791097345 2020-10-19 10:09:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns @elfvillage2 It's possible I'm not, in which case. We can forget it.  I think the fundamental problem here is you think having "Semitic-derived Gods" somehow discredits Euros (I don't) or, rather, that Euro Gods lose all their "Semitic" fundamentals, once they are incoporated (I also don't).
1318011057974120448 2020-10-19 10:08:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns Yes.

Many of these European Gods have non-European predecessors. The myths that carry over are not inherently PIE

1318007511673262081 2020-10-19 09:54:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist Once again. No one is literally saying these people are Semitic.  You need to read what our argument is, otherwise this gets circular.
1318005959701139456 2020-10-19 09:48:02 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist Getting tedious.  The primitive myths were altered by cultural transmission. This is the thesis of Apolloism and it's been substantiated by you numerous times here.  No, the Germans were not free of cultural influence when their own runic script wasn't even their own creation.
1318003701211045888 2020-10-19 09:39:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns @elfvillage2 Well, is he European or not?  You're making it seem so easy to identify "European" Gods. What is Serapis?
1318003004990054400 2020-10-19 09:36:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist You're claiming the history of Thor as he's constructed now goes back a zillion years with no outside influence yet Tacitus refers to him as Hercules, not Thor --- which again, you keep just substantiating my point over and over.
1318002490785214465 2020-10-19 09:34:15 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns @elfvillage2 What is Serapis, for example? European too?
1317999523281604610 2020-10-19 09:22:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns @elfvillage2 They are mythically/esoterically Semitic or Semitized, not LITERALLY Semitic. I'm not doing the "SpWiTuAl BeInG" crap talk.  I don't see how this is even debatable. Most comparatibve religion scholars will admit where the root origins of many of these Gods originate.
1317999149954994176 2020-10-19 09:20:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist You mean Tacitus referring to Thor as "Hercules"?  Are you not proving my entire point?
1317997739079131136 2020-10-19 09:15:22 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @Apollo_Returns @elfvillage2 I don't always agree with the usage of the term "Jewish." I'd rather say "Semitic" -- as what we know as "Jewish" is merely the modern cloak of an ancient cult... and as Mark says, it will change again.
1317993873784729600 2020-10-19 09:00:01 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @elfvillage2 Thracians are very related to Cimmerians, who lived ADJACENT TO SEMITES, despite being Indo-Europeans.  The fact is many of you are in utter denial of the power of cultural transmission.
1317993584520392705 2020-10-19 08:58:52 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist @elfvillage2 I don't understand this 1000+ mile away meme...  You do know that Thor, in Nordic lore, was from Thrace, right?   See how close "Thrace" is to the supposedly very isolated Sweden. Homer even mentions a "Œ∏Œø·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ" (Thourus) God that Thracians worshipped.
1317985791742681089 2020-10-19 08:27:54 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist That said -- this does not "disregard" PIE or indo-European religious traditions -- rather it makes a point that cultural transmission is happening and the people that counter-signal that are coping.
1317984912901697536 2020-10-19 08:24:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist Okay?  Though we may be being provocative by saying 'Odin is Jewish,' the fact that Odin is not part of the ancient proto-Germanic tradition, and that the pantheon is VERY LIKELY hugely influenced by Levantine cults is not disputable... except by illiterate ironybols.
1317981333570813957 2020-10-19 08:10:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @elfvillage2 @NESecessionist I don't want to go hard on you guys since Pagans are at least right in their instincts -- my sights are on people who are illiterate ironists  I'll just say that comparative religious schlars of great renown agree with Mark, while internet e-celebs don't. We'll leave it at that.

However, the argument here isn't a value judgment of Semitic myths (which I find to generally be distasteful -- read some Old Testament parables), but rather, that mass cultural transmission and inclusion occured... which it did.
1317767626131607552 2020-10-18 18:00:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Emelianenko1889 @ArthrPrydain @ShadesHimmler @KviserRo4rk The first Germanic tribes to convert to Christianity converted in 300 AD.  It literally took less than 300 years after Christ's birth for these supposedly extremely isolated peoples to adopt a desert religion.  But other forms of cultural transmission is absurd, right?
1317766718630940672 2020-10-18 17:57:23 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @KALIGALLIA Answer why Arabic/Turkic societies didn't bride-gather Africans and Semites.

There were Indo-European adjacent groups (Hurhro-Urartian) and Semitic adjcant groups (Hamitic), but these were subordinate/subject to the other two groups.

1315536571634913280 2020-10-12 14:15:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> If bride gathering European women is such an insane idea, why did Turkic &amp; Arabic societies systematize it?  e.g., Over 75% of Ottoman sultan consorts were European or Caucasian women.  How many were Arabic/Levantine/Azeri/North African?   0  Even normies are surprised by this.  https://t.co/fcEfMVFOTo

1314690729113911296 2020-10-10 06:14:30 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Finished "Scenes from a Marriage," where Johann (John) leaves his wife Maryanne (Miriam) for the younger Paula (Paul).  A Christian Paul the Apostle steering an esoterically Jewish man away from his esoterically Jewish wife is obviously relevant to the Christian gentile Bergman.  https://t.co/kfQWuUHsK8

1314655323190259712 2020-10-10 03:53:48 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo I think there‚Äôs some work to be done. We should all read Mark‚Äôs book when it comes out. I‚Äôm willing to totally challenge something that seems off. You should too obviously.   So far, it seems to be hitting the nail though.   Then it‚Äôs time to make AIM (Aryan inner moralization).
1314653180240650240 2020-10-10 03:45:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo Making moralizing, subversive (in the best sense of the word) art that flips ]ewish myths on their head and indoctrinates pro-Euro/pro-White-dominance propaganda?  I sense you agree with that, but rather disagree with some of our past mythic interpretation of what is Semitic.
1314651478087229440 2020-10-10 03:38:32 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Baldoggo @ArtoriusBrit I don't want to speak completely for Mark but...  My understanding is that some myths/figures/Gods have too many demoralizing elements attached to them and we need to, at least, be aware of this. We should worship an ideal for us, not one that has all kinds of baggage attached.
1314645837872394240 2020-10-10 03:16:07 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo The origins of some archetypes are still up for debate. I agree.   We should look at the fact that TODAY though, more than half of our culture is dominated/controlled/filtered through a Jewish prism. Thereby, it is vital to understand how Jews (&amp; their toadies) use symbols.
1314645605646364672 2020-10-10 03:15:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit Lol
1314643440815144960 2020-10-10 03:06:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo That's mostly it yeah lol
1314641434104848385 2020-10-10 02:58:37 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo I don't think he IS letting that happen lol. The opposite.  That's the point of AIM. Making stories with an inner-moralizing focus IS to be secretive, """deceptive,""" and power-staking.
1314641163261931520 2020-10-10 02:57:32 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo Nope. I wouldn't call you Jewish at all for saying that.  Manipulation, secrecy, commerce, and deception is just simply the strategy of achieving dominance. It's necessary.  This is why the accounts that go "haha you're making Judaism for Aryans" are utterly closed-minded.
1314638672407347200 2020-10-10 02:47:38 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo In my mind, it just stems back to the Aryan founder, Semitic closer ideology... which can be evidenced as far back as Samarran founders of Sumeria and Akkadian CLOSERS of Sumeria.
1314638500742877184 2020-10-10 02:46:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo I agree with most of what Mark posits but I don't always take him completely literally in regards to HOW the myths transfer.  All we can see is that they do.   e.g., The Elamites, for example, were not Semites by blood but have incorporated all kinds of Semitic myths.
1314638061033021440 2020-10-10 02:45:13 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo Christianity is just a weirdo desert religion started by Jews. It would be nothing beyond 3rd-grade bookish morality (or de-morality) stories if Aryans didnt imbibe it and take it to the next level with the Renaissance and so on.
1314634100922150913 2020-10-10 02:29:29 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo I'm not sure if it so literally makes Mercury a Jew, but rather, the symbolic elements that make up the Mercury god have Semitic-cultural origins.   It's a bit more nuanced than "he's a Jew." He emanates a Semitic symbology, whereas the solar gods do not.
1314633409558310913 2020-10-10 02:26:44 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ArtoriusBrit @Baldoggo What about Roman interpretation?
1314623092241489921 2020-10-10 01:45:44 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Baldoggo Have you considered the possibility that Jesus is another mystery god just like the others?   If not, why not? You‚Äôre noticing similarities already and you probably haven‚Äôt read the corpus of evidence yet.

There were Semitic cultures and their myths in the Middle East since the Akkadians, way before Judaism.  Nord is strawman but...  Bulgaria back then, for example, was occupied by the Thracians, described as a "fair race of redheads."
1314314335519350784 2020-10-09 05:18:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Aureum_Kolovrat "Who cares if no one has any idea what they're talking about, people can just FEEL they know what they're talking about."  Oh, okay.
1314308534394220544 2020-10-09 04:55:47 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Aureum_Kolovrat Okay, well, IE has a very clear and traceable definition today, as well as a determined urheimat, and that is what we are using.
1314305860785467393 2020-10-09 04:45:10 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Aureum_Kolovrat I'm not sure how you're using Caucasoid but the standard classification includes Semitic &amp; Hamitic groups, who no historian or HBD anthropologist would ever classify as Indo-European.  Persians are a mix of IE steppe people and the indigenous, already culturally Semitic, Elamites  https://t.co/deZz5UciGb
1314304479802474496 2020-10-09 04:39:41 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Something feels weirdly inauthentic about this whole encounter... from both sides.
1314297496911245312 2020-10-09 04:11:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Aureum_Kolovrat Blondeness is just a feature unique to original stock, but I don't see it as Aryan = blond.   Okay, but Sir Lytton just wrote literature. Aryan is the word we're using for P/IE.
1314288777955741696 2020-10-09 03:37:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Aureum_Kolovrat I wouldn't consider any Christian systems truly functioning anymore.  The Pope isn't even Catholic.
1314288448149221376 2020-10-09 03:35:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Aureum_Kolovrat I can assure you none of us are haplosperging about the days Sicily was """"blonde""""   I consider Sicily part of the European family and so does just about everyone I know. No one really cares that they might have 10% Berber blood.

It may be a temporary fix to make our lives more comfortable, but the future for our grandkids will be hell. In modernity, you will never be able to escape urbanism.   Even ‚Äúsupply runs‚Äù to the city will expose you.
1314202616772009985 2020-10-08 21:54:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @lucycali88 "Into the Wild" is a movie about Christopher McCandless. His wanderlust for nature just has him starving to death.  A lot of Christians fetishize "moving to the country" and exiting themselves from any greater fight for their heritage, culture, people, and cities.

Except both you and Tham know that doesn‚Äôt happen so stop it.

This is pointing out that Tham counter-signals us from a Christian standpoint quite often. He‚Äôs not neutral, never was. But I don‚Äôt really expect him to be as we fundamentally oppose his belief system.

Though you‚Äôre totally pretending you are now, which is annoying.  I can show numerous instances of you chiming in on the opposing side.   Which is fine, you‚Äôre a Christian. But stop acting like you‚Äôre above one.

It sounds like this non-NS society would have freedom of religion, which makes me question how such fundamentally distinct worldviews could co-exist.
1313965991521525760 2020-10-08 06:14:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Thamster2 @Irusk8 @Fra_Diavolo_ @RLTW14 @etain_vaac You can answer this one question then. Does this ‚Äúreligious focus‚Äù include the Christian Bible as the word of God?
1313964689458565120 2020-10-08 06:09:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Irusk8 @Thamster2 @Fra_Diavolo_ @RLTW14 @etain_vaac It would.
1313957887576690688 2020-10-08 05:42:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Fra_Diavolo_ @Thamster2 @Irusk8 @RLTW14 @etain_vaac That may be because I have no interest in his work, never said I did, and find that this always comes up during his counter-signaling threads on Apolloism... as if I‚Äôm supposed to give credence to every Christian‚Äôs pilpul on their own scripture by default.
1313955643607248896 2020-10-08 05:33:32 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Thamster2 @Fra_Diavolo_ @Irusk8 @RLTW14 @etain_vaac Yes I laughed at an avowed Christian  rendering racialism something that is only important ‚Äúas a tool‚Äù to get illiberal.   People don‚Äôt need to watch your intro videos to get why that‚Äôs amusing or why that may tickle confirmation bias sensors.
1313953230070587392 2020-10-08 05:23:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Thamster2 @Fra_Diavolo_ @Irusk8 @RLTW14 @etain_vaac Yes I haven‚Äôt read as many books on philosophy as a philosophy PhD, Tham. Really got me there.   I do know that it only takes massive amounts of pilpul to incorporate a Christian worldview into everything else you‚Äôre saying.
1313949867320860673 2020-10-08 05:10:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Thamster2 @Fra_Diavolo_ @Irusk8 @RLTW14 @etain_vaac Not all your belief systems really align that clearly, Tham.
1313949101680017408 2020-10-08 05:07:32 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Thamster2 @Fra_Diavolo_ @Irusk8 @RLTW14 @etain_vaac I‚Äôm just going by what is one of the few extant illiberal societies (at least by comparison to the west today). If racialism is only relevant to get us illiberal, a multiracial North Korea should still be preferable.

I‚Äôll just bet my savings that if you start politicking fundamentally race-blind, this will be dead in the water with all the other cope-attempts.   Trump was elected literally because he was racist.   (Inb4 look how that turned out)

Do you have to believe in miracles, for example, in the material world?  What about angels/demons affecting the material world?  It feels that this 'belief' is not something you should expect of all religions to validate them.

I never projected that onto you  It's not my fault you're tied up in this hodge-podge belief system. But, yet again, we don't come out and counter-signal unless you ask for it (which you did). I still see you as White and in this together with us.

I think the point is that you stepped into this arena unprepared to actually challenge the material honestly... and also that there are much bigger fish to fry but this seems very important to you.

The Levant was already thoroughly Semiticized by the time of Jesus. Yes, there were tribes with IE ancestors, and some regions, such as Philistia, were IE, but the likelihood that Jesus (assuming he's real) looked "White" is pretty insane.
1313668288639983616 2020-10-07 10:31:41 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @w_thought @RayMartin1994 Do you believe Jesus was White with blonde hair and blue eyes or anything similar to that?

1313646162939846656 2020-10-07 09:03:46 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @skjordett That pretty much summarizes the opposite side.
1313645726652456967 2020-10-07 09:02:02 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @MarkBrahmin You invoke a lot of hate Mark.   Genie said he‚Äôs ‚Äúsentimental‚Äù for Christian stuff. I think that kind of says it all. It‚Äôs the equivalent of telling a child that Santa isn‚Äôt real prematurely. It‚Äôs really tough on them. Lot of lashing out.

I think it‚Äôs fair that everyone who counter-signals JEM should come out and say whether they are Christian or not.   No hate on them. It‚Äôs just important to know.
1313640762089697281 2020-10-07 08:42:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @w_thought @almightygenie So do you worship a Jew or do you not? It‚Äôs kind of cut and dry.

1313486662115233798 2020-10-06 22:29:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> How many Christians can explain what this statement by Jesus means and why they, personally, don't have to abide by it? @MarkBrahmin  https://t.co/yEn7H2v5qY

1313484444750221313 2020-10-06 22:21:09 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @4everJuche @almightygenie @Fra_Diavolo_ Even if it is just an "ancestor," @almightygenie would still be wrong since the Bible claims absurd nonsense like that the Hittites were descended from Hamites (Ethiopians) and that Semites included the Lydians (indo-Europeans).  It's all pseudo-racialism, hence purely symbolic.
1313481378617581569 2020-10-06 22:08:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @4everJuche @almightygenie @Fra_Diavolo_ Noah's three sons are the FATHERS of three separate races -- Shem (Semites), Ham (North Africans/Blacks), and Japheth (Europeans).   Are you seriously trying to defend Biblical racialism?

1313459299222392832 2020-10-06 20:41:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Fra_Diavolo_ If you want to take Biblical racialism literally, then you'd have to assume one man gave birth to three sons of three separate races. I'm not going down such a rabbithole of absurdity.
1313444722967416833 2020-10-06 19:43:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Fra_Diavolo_ You do know that Aryan is just the word most people use to mean ostensibly IE.  Are you saying no people of IE descent lived in what is now Israel?  I'm not sure you want to venture down this road.
1313443716766461952 2020-10-06 19:39:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Fra_Diavolo_ You're the same person who thought the 12 Tribes of Israel were literal. I'm not sure you're seeking anything but infantile confirmation bias.
1313443119556255745 2020-10-06 19:36:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Fra_Diavolo_ Read the book when it comes out.

1313297726176518144 2020-10-06 09:59:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Some DR accounts are very passionate about destroying the credibility of a dawning racial/religious cult that, if successful, would only benefit them (as Whites) in the long run.  The hostility toward a Pascalian Wager here is rather sketchy. Do we need to see some 23andmes?

Taoism teaches that "sin" can result in illness, literally. I don't think you believe that if you kick a dog, you're going to get cancer.   There's aspects of these religions you don't whole-heartedly believe. I don't feel the need to criticize you for it

I'm sure there's much in Taoism you don't believe, but you can see it as an expression of something that's aligning with your personal search for truth.

Just like Hinduism degenerated into what is superficially polytheism, the same can be said of Western traditions.  This is why I asked you that question, re: the following    https://t.co/cqVZw0jrD1

This is plainly written in anything we've ever said on the subject.

Plus, I'm going by your personal take on this.   But sure, do the whole "self-own" bit after admitting you haven't read Mark.

Wow, you really got me there.  But I can ask you if you genuinely think all the Kings and Pharoahs of antiquity who said they were the sons of deities believed they were?

In fact, there's more to support the grift angle.
1312917371783241728 2020-10-05 08:47:48 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @DonTheWho @KeithWoodsYT @Pr0pagandaWorks @AmericanKrogan Well, it is mostly stories, rituals, and the systems that expand from that.  "Touchy-feely spiritualism" isn't a concrete "part" of the system.
1312916539905982464 2020-10-05 08:44:30 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @DonTheWho @KeithWoodsYT @Pr0pagandaWorks @AmericanKrogan I'm comparing story with story.   Do religions not use story?
1312915300623368194 2020-10-05 08:39:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @DonTheWho @KeithWoodsYT @Pr0pagandaWorks @AmericanKrogan @almightygenie "Our modern people create elaborate films that cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take a multitude of years to compelte only to promote some kind of propagandist political point that serves their ends??!?! RIDICULOUS!!!"
1312913626584342528 2020-10-05 08:32:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @KeithWoodsYT @Pr0pagandaWorks @AmericanKrogan @almightygenie It's silly to not think that religion was a tool used to expand power. It doesn't exclusively serve that end today obviously, but the origins of many religions can undoubtedly be traced to something approaching that, hence why the sovereign was often a "relative" of God.
1312910661500854272 2020-10-05 08:21:09 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Apollo_Returns I don't agree that that's what it is but, again, how is this a criticism?

1312909602158116864 2020-10-05 08:16:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @HaroldHillel @AustraliaFair_ Kind of a badass description. Thanks lol.
1312909367528751104 2020-10-05 08:16:00 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @ReadTheBibles @TranscendedNate @Pr0pagandaWorks @KeithWoodsYT @AmericanKrogan @almightygenie Your handle pretty much says it all.
1312908630379773952 2020-10-05 08:13:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @KeithWoodsYT @Pr0pagandaWorks @almightygenie Early versions of some of those religions had inextricably tied racial moralizations attached to them. Regarding Islam, this is detailed pretty well in "The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise."   This idea that they were all just honest "truth seeking" mechanisms is totally naive.
1312907482298159104 2020-10-05 08:08:31 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Yessirman2 @KeithWoodsYT @Pr0pagandaWorks @almightygenie There's nothing wrong with a Jewish-like religion for Whites (and obviously I dont mean Christianity when I say that).
1312903891416039425 2020-10-05 07:54:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @TranscendedNate @Pr0pagandaWorks @KeithWoodsYT @AmericanKrogan @almightygenie Lol that‚Äôs such a weasely argument
1312897135323410432 2020-10-05 07:27:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Pr0pagandaWorks I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs derailing about asking you whether you believe that Jesus is salvation and thereby in the word of God.  It‚Äôs rather relevant considering your criticism of Apolloism IS its supposed  inability to convince people of magic and copying from an ‚Äúevil‚Äù religion.
1312895715484463104 2020-10-05 07:21:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Thamster2 @dionysus_14 @Pr0pagandaWorks @almightygenie @MarkBrahmin I‚Äôve just had interactions with more than one account arguing we cannot hold the presupposition that ‚Äúmiracles can‚Äôt happen.‚Äù   I know you likely won‚Äôt do that, but my point is it‚Äôs absolutely relevant whether or not an interlocutor is a Christian believer...
1312894682943299584 2020-10-05 07:17:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Pr0pagandaWorks @almightygenie Good luck getting @almightygenie to fully explain his belief system.   Pro-tip: he‚Äôs probably just an atheist
1312893856912863233 2020-10-05 07:14:22 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @dionysus_14 @Pr0pagandaWorks @almightygenie @MarkBrahmin @Thamster2 Except @Thamster2 outwardly identifies as a Christian rotf... so it seems he‚Äôs right.
1312893532915396608 2020-10-05 07:13:05 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Pr0pagandaWorks Perhaps because this line or argumentation will end up looking pretty silly once you reveal you don‚Äôt actually believe in any grand transcendence yourself and are just a secular Christian lol.
1312759434272145410 2020-10-04 22:20:13 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @4everJuche @almightygenie If you're genuinely asking:   https://t.co/TRhHaPxBJi
1312758989566832641 2020-10-04 22:18:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @CombatMarinetti @frater_aspire @MarkBrahmin Tell this to the morons who call Judaism "evil" but b/c it's not Christianity, rather than because it's the religion of a dysgenic peoples.
1312758601723736066 2020-10-04 22:16:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @4everJuche @almightygenie Christianity is demoralizing to Aryans and moralizing to Semites, who come out as the victors in their own parables, or who have Aryans "do their bidding."  This is the fundamental thesis of JEM.  You're generally smarter than these morons you're palling around with currently.
1312755494306549763 2020-10-04 22:04:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @4everJuche @almightygenie You guys simply don't get what we mean when we say a character "esoterically" represents something.   e.g.m Three mythic brothers can be born of Hebrew parents, it doesn't mean they all exist as Semitic symbols in a parable.  Most of this seem to indicate nobody has read Mark.
1312725046775799809 2020-10-04 20:03:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @NESecessionist He knows that. This is tactical nihilism.   He doesn't believe in his Abrahamic Gods but won't admit it b/c it ruins the validity of any criticism he has of us.
1312718661417795584 2020-10-04 19:38:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @AustraliaFair_ I thought you said you've heard enough to understand what Apolloism is?
1312717308691771393 2020-10-04 19:32:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @AustraliaFair_ Then provide 1 criticism. It seems people have told you enough.
1312716526433099776 2020-10-04 19:29:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser ugh
1312716059279937536 2020-10-04 19:27:52 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser comes across as a "we can all get along" joke
1312710983278686208 2020-10-04 19:07:42 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @EvroKaiser They fear peddlers?
1312708939000082432 2020-10-04 18:59:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @AustraliaFair_ I take it you have thoroughly read through  https://t.co/71bzJLQ3br and have a cogent criticism of its findings to qualify it as "ridiculous."  Mind sharing?
1312705799806873601 2020-10-04 18:47:06 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie By saying we don't REALLY worship Apollo, the criticism obviously follows that we are cynical atheists.   Why are deconstructing? Just answer the above question so we can play on equal footing.
1312703281823531008 2020-10-04 18:37:05 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie Why are you constantly evading this question?  If you're going to criticize others for being atheistic and "cynical" in their religion, I think it is worthy to prove you're not atheistic and cynical in yours. Otherwise you are no different from us BY YOUR OWN STANDARDS.
1312702901916106753 2020-10-04 18:35:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie Okay, so one of your problems with Apollonians is a modern dictionary definition issue?  Give me a break.
1312702370174791680 2020-10-04 18:33:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @eraser101yt @Sowilo101 @almightygenie @MarkBrahmin Actually, I never jump into Christian threads and call them anti-White posers. I havent seen a single Apollonian account do that. I'm willing to support them on that front.  It is Christians jumping on Apollonians. The first tweet I quoted from @almightygenie is proof of that.
1312701636872073218 2020-10-04 18:30:33 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie This can all be cleared up rather easily.  Do you believe Jesus is salvation?  If yes, why are you not following scripture? If not, you're not a Christian and don't believe in the Christian God.
1312699464105172992 2020-10-04 18:21:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @eraser101yt @Sowilo101 @almightygenie @MarkBrahmin This presumes religion is unimportant to race or politics.   pro-tip: It's not.
1312697348976328705 2020-10-04 18:13:31 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Sowilo101 Your definition of atheism isn't the definition used by the Romans.  https://t.co/dQyPqygiXB
1312692095795097600 2020-10-04 17:52:38 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Sowilo101 I don't consider your definition of the word "atheist/secular" in the same way you don't consider mine.   The difference is... I don't expect you to accept mine. You expect me to accept yours.
1312691385527541760 2020-10-04 17:49:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Sowilo101 @almightygenie Someone was telling me that George Floyd is a God today, and I can see that... in a cynical way.  When I said... wait a second, where's the spiritualism and miracles? They said "It'll happen in 300 years" ü§£
1312690271973380096 2020-10-04 17:45:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Sowilo101 I've said this before to another guy. I'm arguing with you on a level playing field. We can't argue on a playing field where you claim we're wrong b/c Christian miracles/magic is real.   If this is what you're claiming, we can stop right now, b/c this won't go anywhere.
1312689490406764544 2020-10-04 17:42:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie That is an irrelevant statement in regards to your argument that we are misinterpreting archetypes and myths lol.
1312689148273156096 2020-10-04 17:40:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Sowilo101 @almightygenie He won't explicitly say he's Christian, which is a total cop out.  If you believe in Jesus as savior, you're Christian.
1312688958308904960 2020-10-04 17:40:10 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Sowilo101 I repeated myself and yet you're still not addressing it.  I don't really care what your personal opinion on reform Judaism is. From a secularist, non-Christian perspective, there's nothing evil about it.
1312688653961891840 2020-10-04 17:38:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie So? The myths remain the same. The moralization/demoralization inherent remains the same.
1312688195948081153 2020-10-04 17:37:09 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie Brothers are explicitly brothers in the OT but they are ascribed different symbolic signifiers.   Various Gods have parents that are of different signifiers. You're reading this from a literalist Christian perspective again... which is why it is so difficult to debate it with you
1312687868746199040 2020-10-04 17:35:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Sowilo101 If you're a Christian and you consider Christianity to be a "revolt" against a "bad" Semitic religion... and you ascribe Apollism some similar function... I don't see why you shouldn't support it.
1312687574419341312 2020-10-04 17:34:40 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie I think you might be reading this parable differently than we are.  If this is a legit criticism, I'll pass it on.  The others don't seem legitimate to me.
1312686278152916992 2020-10-04 17:29:31 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Sowilo101 I hate to be a "read more" account but, honestly, you're misinterpreting a lot.   https://t.co/wkEYP5WW3V
1312685864342843392 2020-10-04 17:27:53 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @Sowilo101 So then you should be fine with Apolloism, b/c aren't you ostensibly a Christian?  It takes mere belief in Jesus as savior to be a Christian these days.
1312685381704273921 2020-10-04 17:25:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie 'If there were parallel Semitic gods nearby, they went by other names.'  Yeah, and?
1312684798012317696 2020-10-04 17:23:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @MarkBrahmin Then what is 'evil' about Judaism? How is it uniquely evil compared to other religions?
1312684560627294208 2020-10-04 17:22:42 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie First you said we all misread everything, now you're saying it's not "worthwhile to study" in the way we do...   Oh oaky.  Interpretatio Romana actually supports our version of events.
1312683145284612097 2020-10-04 17:17:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie @MarkBrahmin Disagree on what? Do you think Jews supernatural demons then?  This is sort of the implication by calling Judaism, whether ancient or modern, "evil?"  We're not arguing on the same plane, nor with the same fundamentals. You're taking a holistically Christianist perspective.
1312680498917863424 2020-10-04 17:06:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie There is nothing "evil" about reform Judaism. You're looking at this from some strange Christian anti-Semitism perspective.   Do you think Jews are supernatural demons?  Also, as @MarkBrahmin pointed out, this is the position of the man you worship.  https://t.co/2gzfMFplcq
1312676943658008577 2020-10-04 16:52:26 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie Mercury and Saturn being derived from the deities of Semitic cultures/peoples isn't even that hotly debated even in mainstream circles.    You'll have to give me a source for your position on Samson; I don't know from what angle you're coming at it.
1312676161646780419 2020-10-04 16:49:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie Though that first part is bullshit, I would have to question why that would even be a criticism if it were true. Are "similar models" somehow worse than the unironic worship of a "spiritual-plane" Abrahamic God that thinks you are cattle for not being of a "chosenite?"
1312668459713454080 2020-10-04 16:18:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie You believe in the ancestral pagan gods yet you also don‚Äôt seem to do anything to worship them then. It‚Äôs a bit confusing.   This is where the glass house analogy comes in.
1312665780375351296 2020-10-04 16:08:04 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie We‚Äôre so sorry @almightygenie for not picking up on the kindness and honest criticism you so deftly offered in this tweet.  You, of course, make regular ritualistic sacrifices to the astral plane Zeus to show your devotion to his spiritual existence.  https://t.co/dQoUVaKlnE

1312277498705580033 2020-10-03 14:25:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chairmanlawton So you‚Äôre coming at this question from a Christian worldview where miracles can happen....  I‚Äôm coming at it from the so-called ‚Äúmaterialist‚Äù secular view.   I tried to put us on an equal playing field with Marxism.   This is an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.
1312263316392169472 2020-10-03 13:28:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> Christianity sure is consistent.
1312233369351012352 2020-10-03 11:29:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chairmanlawton Lmfao. This is such fucking tactical nihilist bullshit. Okay let‚Äôs switch to a Marxist worldview to explain the historicity of Jesus
1312224253073260544 2020-10-03 10:53:36 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chairmanlawton "Historicity" presupposes the world as not having magic (which is the same as miracles, stfu). I am debating you on the HISTORICITY OF JESUS, not on the SPIRITUAL/NON-MATERIALIST/BLAH-BLAH existence of Jesus.  I have no grounds to debate you on the latter.
1312223894145622016 2020-10-03 10:52:10 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> The only legitimate way this wouldn't be token is if we watched a stoning in her back-story.   https://t.co/bvetmTPn0M
1312223037777801216 2020-10-03 10:48:46 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chairmanlawton Rejection of miracles is the only way to speak empirically on something. Miracles literally mean "I can't prove how this happened but it did" lol.  Give me a break.
1312222053387264000 2020-10-03 10:44:52 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> You can always just say: "Well, that incongrueity is an example of a miracle."

1312221393585463296 2020-10-03 10:42:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> See, with these two comments, we can't go anywhere. You're now using "faith."  If you want to debate the historicity of Jesus, that means you have to debate me on the plane of presupposing miracles can't happen. Otherwise, this stuff gets unfalsifiable.  https://t.co/9LnMwSZdTy

This isn't uncommon, but if Jesus was of equivalent importance in the historical record, you would expect to find SOMETHING substantial beyond the Bible.

We can't self-reference the Bible with the Bible.

1312216422504833024 2020-10-03 10:22:29 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie I don't see tradCaths as genuine either. But those people couldnt defend their 'religious views' -- they just spew irony.

None of that exists for Jesus. Like none AT ALL.

For me, I treat them both the same -- too legendary to qualify with any declarative statements about their unmythologized existences.

There's no way to tell.  Is Odysseus real? Is Priam real -- okay then Helen, daughter of ZEUS is real? We can choose anything now...
1312205412582649857 2020-10-03 09:38:44 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chairmanlawton @ChefRedwall @ApollonianMan @Thamster2 @NorthernInvader @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 @BPDCastellanos @TheCptBlackPill @ClassicalTheis @KeithWoodsYT There are many historical accounts of Alexander the Great and few are bathed in religious mysticism (though some are). We even have primary sources.  You can't say anything even equivalent for Jesus of Nazareth. Aside from off-handed remarks by non-Christians, there's nothing.

It is inference, but there is etymology and linguistics which have actually contextualized a lot of this more solidly.

Real in the psychological emanation of the sense? Okay, yeah, yeah... I get it.  But you can't mix archaeology in the """material""" world with astral projections.

Does that confirm the existence of Helen, and by virtue Odysseus, and by virtue Zeus?
1312199988030525443 2020-10-03 09:17:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chairmanlawton @ChefRedwall @ApollonianMan @Thamster2 @NorthernInvader @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 @BPDCastellanos @TheCptBlackPill @ClassicalTheis @KeithWoodsYT We know the full lineage of Alexander the Great -- his mother, his father, his grandparents. We found tombs of his relatives and have archaeological evidence of his conquests.  People can't even begin to guess as to the supposed historical Jesus of Nazareth's actual parentage.
1312196065022504965 2020-10-03 09:01:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie If having a "spiritual" experience is all it takes for a God to legitimately exist "on the astral plane" then I imagine every strange cult that's ever existed is legitimized in your mind.  Do you think the people of Jonestown DIDN'T have religious experiences?
1312195343384113153 2020-10-03 08:58:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @chairmanlawton @ChefRedwall @ApollonianMan @Thamster2 @NorthernInvader @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 @BPDCastellanos @TheCptBlackPill @ClassicalTheis @KeithWoodsYT Are you really trying to convince people there's more evidence of Jesus than there is of Alexander the Great lmfao?
1312194142982729729 2020-10-03 08:53:57 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie So what I said in my main tweet is right then lol.
1312193517247053824 2020-10-03 08:51:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @almightygenie You don't actually worship Zeus.
1312192858632286208 2020-10-03 08:48:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> ... and all the Talmudic references to Jesus are totally debated (some historians claim Jesus of Nazareth is not mentioned in the Talmud at all). No real consensus.  Is this all really indisputable corroboration that justifies confidently saying "no historian doubts it"  ??
1312192857780809729 2020-10-03 08:48:51 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> ... and Josephus writes that Christ literally rose from the dead (at least according to his sources). Shall we take this as evidence of Christ's abilities?  Tacitus, born 2 decades after Jesus' supposed death,  merely references a Christus as "the person the Christians worship"..
1312186496133206017 2020-10-03 08:23:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> "There is vague Biblical archaeology (such as place name or King corroboration) so that means Jesus existed. They discovered Troy too, so that means Zeus existed. Hence I believe in all Gods... but only spiritually!!!" - @almightygenie

1311985595455995904 2020-10-02 19:05:16 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @JordyboyJ @Thamster2 Do you believe in a literal physical God or do you just have vague 'faith' ?
1311981707747188740 2020-10-02 18:49:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Thamster2 @BoundforApollo @MarkBrahmin So, to be clear, what you're saying is not that the coincidences are coincidences but that scholars are falsifying similarities where there are none.  I'm willing to believe that.  I'm not willing to believe (and no one should) that the similarities are present but incidental.

Even  https://t.co/pMl8cWemnA says there is absolutely no archaeological evidence, and calls into question even Biblical events that should have had SOMETHING left behind like the exodus.
1311962242296934400 2020-10-02 17:32:28 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Faust23508445 True. Just sap a little Aryan DNA then make HAPA kids and have them go "full Asian" culturally.
1311958353875095554 2020-10-02 17:17:01 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Faust23508445 That would honestly be a subversive ending. No I think he just stays married to his Asian wife but lives off our systems.

If I‚Äôm wrong and there is archaeological evidence‚Äî what is it?

1311839513535107074 2020-10-02 09:24:47 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @MarkBrahmin @Apollo_Returns There seem to be two lines of "Snowtep" attack.  One is what you just mentioned, which is just... odd.

1309200676677808130 2020-09-25 02:38:59 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @IncanCommunist @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns @Indian_Bronson @RichardBSpencer You're coming across real level-headed here.
1309200383831465984 2020-09-25 02:37:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @pazzobazzo It's a misconception to assume anyone identifies as "American" or that 'white' and 'American' are synonymous and/or interchangeable.
1309198910661881857 2020-09-25 02:31:58 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @IncanCommunist @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns @Indian_Bronson @RichardBSpencer Explain what "bad faith."  We just hate brown people so much we can't contain ourselves?  You wanna back that up or is it gonna be more irony?
1309196775224270848 2020-09-25 02:23:29 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @IncanCommunist @Apollo_Returns @Indian_Bronson @arnelsmom @RichardBSpencer I will donate to your patreon/gofundme/whatever-you-have if you show me a single instance of an Apollonian jumping into some other online ethnic solidarity space and lecturing them on how they're "doing it wrong."  It seems that activity is only a practice reserved for you all.
1309194993173540864 2020-09-25 02:16:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @J_Ladarc He's the definition of a megalomaniac.

1309181900494262272 2020-09-25 01:24:23 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @pazzobazzo This is nonsense. We‚Äôre all European mutts, even ethnostatist Europeans like Estonians are still European mutts. White is a supra-category that everybody recognizes.  An old Chris Rock bit is about a migrant coming to America and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Romanian!‚Äù and he screams ‚Äúyou white!‚Äù
1309005255150051329 2020-09-24 13:42:27 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Indian_Bronson @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns The difference is that I doubt you would lecture Mormons that their efforts to secure power in Utah are wrongheaded b/c they shouldn't focus so hard on the kingdom of glory.   The truth is that you only reserve that tone for WNs.
1309000404672315393 2020-09-24 13:23:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @arnelsmom @Indian_Bronson @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer @Apollo_Returns It‚Äôs not a difficult question to answer. We can support every historical claim we make.   ‚ÄúUnnecessary antagonism‚Äù is the ‚Äúwhite hotep‚Äù meme you peddled for a while there.
1308995566437834753 2020-09-24 13:03:57 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Indian_Bronson @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns &gt;‚ÄùLiterally true because I said so‚Äù  Yes, I sense total objective neutrality in your tone.   Here‚Äôs a simple question that will cut through the pedantic bullshit you‚Äôre hiding behind.   Do you think we are peddling falsehoods? Yes or No.   If no, there should be no issue.
1308992057202139136 2020-09-24 12:50:00 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Indian_Bronson @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns How about honestly explaining why you are jumping in the fray?   Not a single Apollonian has said teaching whites about their ancient history is the one and only pathway to political domination.   This is an immature strawman.
1308988606527217667 2020-09-24 12:36:18 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Indian_Bronson @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns You jumped in this thread to give a rejoinder to the question I asked Cornpop after he strawmanned Apolloism. I‚Äôm not going to pretend this was to provide the very keen insight that ‚Äúnot all blacks are bad‚Äù or ‚Äúyou need more the religion.‚Äù  What‚Äôs the real issue?
1308983872286339074 2020-09-24 12:17:29 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Indian_Bronson @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns The fact that you‚Äôre asking that actually suggests you‚Äôve never interacted with a black person beyond the graduate studies department at a local university.  Real salt of the earth black people are the biggest conspiracy guzzlers of humankind.
1308982149022978051 2020-09-24 12:10:38 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer The implication of your tweet, as well as the general tenor of this thread and other tweets in it, is that Apollonians are larping-away accomplishments from brown/Non-White civilizations.   If you want to step into this arena and challenge what we write on the subject, feel free.
1308981318957568005 2020-09-24 12:07:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Indian_Bronson @IncanCommunist @RichardBSpencer @arnelsmom @Apollo_Returns Rotf. If you‚Äôre trying to convince me that blacks are alienated by being told they‚Äôre better than Whites, I don‚Äôt fucking believe you.   Black celebrities are always two steps away from Kangdom.

Shouldnt the NoI be talking about Medical?
1308893234349867008 2020-09-24 06:17:19 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FanJrr Seems like a good gig for y‚Äôall to be honest
1308892810972725248 2020-09-24 06:15:38 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Aureum_Kolovrat This is interesting. There‚Äôs elements of Dievs that reads Apollonian but how him being a ‚Äúsky father‚Äù but also ‚Äúearth‚Äù seems contrary to the PIE Porto-mythology which always posits earth as distinct and feminine.
1308867715730485248 2020-09-24 04:35:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> You come up with that all by yourself?   Maybe if you spinelessly defend Jews enough, they‚Äôll finally give you that mainstream book deal so you can publish widely about prolapsing assholes or w/e.  Go back to writing about your early homosexual experiences, loser.

1308630705300103169 2020-09-23 12:54:07 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 The Islamic Golden Age is also sort of proof against Christianity being any indicator of Aryan success.   Nearly all the major figures came from Al-Andalus or from the region of  Khwarezm, which is known as the ‚Äúcradle of Aryan culture.‚Äù

Im a hawwt blonde Hispanic. Marry mestizas to make castizas, White man.‚Äù  IIRC ‚Äî Her brothers were total muds.
1307748219112230913 2020-09-21 02:27:26 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Irusk8 Part of it stems from people not laying the cards out on the table right away.   I can‚Äôt begin to describe what a lot of these now repugnant ironybro accounts actually believe.

1307497277821394946 2020-09-20 09:50:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @TiAIjatLKoML4B5 Hunter's Christianity precedes his WNism. He's admitted this in so many words. I'm not going to criticize him for it, but it does seem like the civNat Christians always wander their way into Apollonian territory and tweet truisms about "white" being a social construct... etc...

Get your Hebrew-to-English translator back up.  Considering that report has absolutely no place for it as an addendum.
1306729782919348224 2020-09-18 07:00:32 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FascetioustT I don't think so.

1306670465344180225 2020-09-18 03:04:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Except you people have no full documents. The "soviet forgeries" are always tiny excerpts from larger missing documents.  The reason a Himmler order was never faked is b/c it could be pulled into shreds. Can't risk that. Pulling out tiny excerpts from "missing documents" is cake.
1306669660176150528 2020-09-18 03:01:38 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner All we have on what Irving believes is from secondary sources. I'll wait to see what his position is from his own mouth.   Even so, I don't really care. I don't follow personalities. You claim not to either; otherwise your position wouldnt be so convoluted.
1306669296748097536 2020-09-18 03:00:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner They're not even remotely connected. The addendum is 1 page -- you are telling me FG went to the camp and made a 1 page report on JUST the gassing procedure (which he already knows about) but nothing else?  You're a clown. Choose what hill to die on properly.
1306667697153875969 2020-09-18 02:53:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner You have yet to explain how the FG report even fits in with the other report. You said its an addendum. Put the two together. How does it fit?  Maybe if Hebrew is your first language, such a codicil makes sense. After all, you people didn't even use vowels for a while.
1306667077302796288 2020-09-18 02:51:22 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Cole doesn't believe gassings took place in Auschwitz.

1306644465524723712 2020-09-18 01:21:31 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner At this point, we can safely say gas chambers likely didn‚Äôt exist, so if I were you, I‚Äôd move on to Einsatzgruppen and retain a tiny bit of credibility. At least there you have ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùdocuments.‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù

1306618076578738181 2020-09-17 23:36:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Fra_Diavolo_ @Thamster2 Every year a documentary wins or is nominated for Best Documentary at the Oscars that is a massive propaganda-push for American interventionalism in the Middle East...
1306616293563408385 2020-09-17 23:29:34 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Estimates vary.   All we know is this is something even your historians agree likely happened.
1306615466429800451 2020-09-17 23:26:17 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @mtracey Shut up.
1306615288536788993 2020-09-17 23:25:35 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner It's mainstream narrative that your alleged gas chamber in Auschwitz was reconfigured into a bomb shelter. Your own historians say that.  So "gas-tight door" -- your seeming only evidence -- is gone.
1306614938677383168 2020-09-17 23:24:11 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @Fra_Diavolo_ @Thamster2 He's just non-White and has no ability to get over that.

1306614193307578368 2020-09-17 23:21:14 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner The evidence of gas chambers anywhere is scanty. I recommend you hoaxers start doing "Holocaust of bullets."   You're going to have much more traction with that one as you have a few Soviet forgeries to fall back on (like the Taubner verdict).   Just a friendly recommendation.
1306613478363262976 2020-09-17 23:18:23 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @FascetioustT That account is just painfully dumb.

For all your  "missing Jews," I can provide counter-evidence that Jewish numbers remained virtually the same.   I don't have to prove something DIDN'T HAPPEN.   You have to prove something DID.

They pop on under various accounts to shill the pants-on-head blog Holocaust Controversies.   The IDF guidebook is as follows:  "Never give denialists an inch. Even if it makes you look demented."

1305406519962337280 2020-09-14 15:22:22 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Whoa cool. Two whole reports!  So where's the full version of the SECOND Franke-Griksch  report that mentions all the gassings?
1305403155123851264 2020-09-14 15:09:00 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner So where's that full report that allegedly was split off even though there's no indication of that?
1305402876445908992 2020-09-14 15:07:53 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner I don't give a shit about that.  You're constantly evading.  Do you have a place where this excerpt fits? Where's the full document?  So you admit there are two documents -- and you're saying they're not related?  https://t.co/pn2sANhP5h

1305397548887150592 2020-09-14 14:46:43 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner So you're saying there were two separate Franke-Griksch Reports made in 1943 and sent to his superiors?  Explain.  You're struggling here.

1305369638495113219 2020-09-14 12:55:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Also, where is the German original for your excerpt?

1305344727055650816 2020-09-14 11:16:49 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Nope. The document was found in British archives and has no indication of a missing codicil, nor does the tone or writing style match with the tone and style of the alleged document you have.   Are you saying it was purposely written differently b/c it was so super duper secret?
1305225596071325696 2020-09-14 03:23:26 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @3pRevolt @StriebRoman Exactly. "Holocaust of Bullets" is the new Holocaust.

1304663269194383361 2020-09-12 14:08:57 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Arad doesn't list Majdanek as a death camp.  So can we get  @whatcorner  to admit that Majdanek probably wasn't a death camp.  It seems serious historians are in doubt, and the death numbers have dropped to below 50,000, starting at almost a million during the Nuremberg trials.
1304662472503119878 2020-09-12 14:05:47 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner But the revisionist explanation for why its named that you outright reject, right?  Just trying to keep you consistent.
1304661822100840448 2020-09-12 14:03:12 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner After all. He‚Äôs a serious scholar so you should take him seriously.
1304661670879309824 2020-09-12 14:02:36 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Does Arad consider Majdanek a death camp? It seems he flips back and forth on this. What do you think?
1304660686044237830 2020-09-12 13:58:41 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner "Where are the alleged Jews I claim are missing???" "Don't know. We barely have documents on numbers to begin with." "SEE! THEY WERE GASSED!!!"  This is a non-sequitor and baby stuff the IDF tell you to repeat.  Tell me why it's called Aktion Reinhardt.
1304659205740089349 2020-09-12 13:52:48 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Funny. All the mainsteam historians seem to very firmly know why it was named that but here you are pretending its unknown.
1304658712028540930 2020-09-12 13:50:50 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Who cares? There seems to be a 1 to 1 correlation with getting put into the court system and eventually "have an epiphany" rotf.
1304657921041522688 2020-09-12 13:47:42 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner All you've ever done is post hilarious copes we all laugh at.   Did you post that grandma picture that Eric Hunt pretends to claim convinced him the Holocaust was real?  Or is that even too low brow for you?  Also answer the question: Why was it named Aktion Reinhardt?
1304657220748021761 2020-09-12 13:44:55 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner What's your point?   All you're doing is admitting his magical conversion happened after serving almost 3 years in jail for a trumped-up felony. Who cares if he didn't start doing podcasts again until years later.
1304655831011438592 2020-09-12 13:39:24 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner A lot of more concerning discrepancies don't seem to phase you.
1304654976711491585 2020-09-12 13:36:00 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Isn't that the guy who magically stopped being a revisionist after Ellie Wiesel put him in jail for alleged assault?  Yes or no?
1304654362518593536 2020-09-12 13:33:33 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner So massive cover-ups are now tickling you as silly?  Hmm.
1304646505693810689 2020-09-12 13:02:20 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Why is it so unbelievable to you that any document discussing resettlement to Belarus could have been destroyed, the numbers manipulated, given orally + there was never a ‚Äúglobal‚Äù order for Belarusian resettlement ‚Äî only local ones which had different objectives, timing?
1304645326452568064 2020-09-12 12:57:39 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner &gt;nothing stopping them from writing on them   Are we just going to pretend it‚Äôs not illegal to publish Holocaust revisionism in most European countries?
1304644895295053824 2020-09-12 12:55:56 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner Start with the stuff I asked for above them. You‚Äôve already struggled gratuitously to find a single document of any kind confirming a homocidal gas chamber, how about those orders initiating the Holocaust?
1304590411487473666 2020-09-12 09:19:26 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner The is all the more pathetic given that Holocaust studies are not only legal but well-funded, while Revisionist studies are banned, illegal, and obstructed at every turn.
1304590076953862144 2020-09-12 09:18:07 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner a more relevant question might by why Holocausters haven't been able to produce documentation for a single homicidal gas chamber -- or a single offical internal order for the extermination of Jews, or account for the thousands of buried bodies at Auschwitz or the Reinhardt camps.
1304585377697525760 2020-09-12 08:59:26 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> @whatcorner You know very well what historians claim Action Reinhardt is named after and this is why you're now pretending "no one knows."  Why are you so scared to admit the mainstream narrative? Is it b/c it's so insanely idiotic?

1304354181017288705 2020-09-11 17:40:45 +0800 <KetaMeanGirl> So why was Action Reinhardt named Action Reinhardt?  Can any Holocaust believers answer this question for me. I want to see you guys scramble to justify this one.

If conspiracies regarding COVID-19 are false, then numerous White grandparents have died b/c some Chinese polity somewhere has backward unhygienic cultural practices.  Not cool.
