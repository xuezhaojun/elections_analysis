1341099772774674438 2020-12-22 03:14:36 +0800 <67donnalynn> My poor baby had chills, a sore throat, and a minor cough. And just a very slight fever. Shes been sleeping for 2 days and hasn't had any appetite.  Cut to 10 minutes ago and I get a call from Shaina's group and she was in contact with someone who tested positive.
1341099764750938112 2020-12-22 03:14:35 +0800 <67donnalynn> My daughter is 29. Shes legally blind and severely delayed(like around a 4-5 yr old). She was going to a day program, full time. This weekend she started having symptoms. I didn't send her to group today, because of the symptoms. I called and explained why she was absent.

I think the reason the senate rethuglikkkans didn't pass the H.E.R.O.E.S. Act in May was so they could drag it out til right before the election. Make it look like they actually give af about the people.

And the Mayor said the Chief will be on the job until Sept. 28th and there will be an Interim Chief.  Also, check out the news from the protest last night. Sorry, no violence. so that talking point is MOOT!

1301865743626178563 2020-09-04 20:52:35 +0800 <67donnalynn> @thomaskaine5 Sorry but I'm still having flashbacks from 2016 when Joe was putting drumpf on a pedestal. HE (Joe) helped make America the shithole it is today by promoting donald! I can't forgive him. I just CAN'T!
1301864422361702401 2020-09-04 20:47:20 +0800 <67donnalynn> @4everNeverTrump @AlexanderKaty I can't help but wonder, what was in it for him?
1301860813188333570 2020-09-04 20:32:59 +0800 <67donnalynn> @Tennesseine #JusticeForDanielPrude  He wasn't even committing a crime. He's dead because some police officers thought it was funny to see a naked man laying in the street in the snow!
1301858110064283650 2020-09-04 20:22:15 +0800 <67donnalynn> @atrupar we have a big weekend, wearing your mask when you're close together, he says, as no one in the crowd is wearing a mask. whatta a clown!

1301855819290554369 2020-09-04 20:13:09 +0800 <67donnalynn> @djrothkopf @TheAtlantic Some of it has been confirmed by @MilesTaylorUSA  He replied to one of drumpf's tweets and called him a liar re: flags at half-mast for Sen. McCain. Kelly, Mattis and anyone else needs to step up, fo realz!

1301621915619135488 2020-09-04 04:43:42 +0800 <67donnalynn> @ksecus I think they're gonna try and "buy" votes and FINALLY cut a deal, I'd estimate, around the middle of October. That's just my hunch, so they can be like, "see how much we care about you, vote for me?"

My sister makes Italian Wedding Soup in bulk and instead of Tupperware,  she uses big freezer bags. Saves space because they freeze flat, and you can save the Tupperware.
