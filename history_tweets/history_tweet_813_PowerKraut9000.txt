1344007314366349312 2020-12-30 03:48:08 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Pit bulls are the (you know what) of the dog world.  They interbreed with pure bred dogs and make them ugly
1341096127093899265 2020-12-22 03:00:07 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> An issue I‚Äôm oddly passionate about that I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not at the forefront of politics is school lunches. We serve our children literal prison food. I believe good nutrition for children is the backbone of a nation. Poor nutrition leads to behavioral problems.
1341088431028375553 2020-12-22 02:29:32 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @ApollonianGerm Ok as a plant nerd all I can think is how did you keep that croton alive??
1340746716673236992 2020-12-21 03:51:41 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @KeithWoodsYT But that‚Äôs like....80% of podcasts already
1340743672166412288 2020-12-21 03:39:35 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Europinion_ @BrexitSachsy Who does he think CAME to America and built it??? We are European. But he‚Äôd probably say black people I‚Äôm sure
1340116417002184704 2020-12-19 10:07:06 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @CJSomething I love the idea of matching pajamas, regular ski trips, and rescuing/helping animals.
1340037158774566912 2020-12-19 04:52:09 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Where are the men who have a sense of pride in being useful to their woman and kin? Midwestern men really knew their place üòÇ
1340036768054169600 2020-12-19 04:50:36 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I LIKE GENDER ROLES.
1340036687926239234 2020-12-19 04:50:17 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Growing up and when I was in a 9 year relationship back home. If I was looking at tools or wanted something the men in my life would be like, what do you need? I can do that for you.  And I get to sit back and be cute and do girl things.
1340036242843422720 2020-12-19 04:48:31 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I‚Äôm so tired of West Coast men and their mentality. I‚Äôm used to men wanting to be useful and liked building stuff for me back home. It‚Äôs how I was raised. If I just wanted companionship I‚Äôd get a dog.
1338955728669691904 2020-12-16 05:14:56 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I told someone I wanted to go be a wild woman and they thought I meant partying and sleeping around...no I meant I want to go into the mountains with an axe and furs. Maybe howl at the moon. Tf
1338717523395584000 2020-12-15 13:28:24 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @eurog3nic Don‚Äôt remind me
1338255883759828993 2020-12-14 06:54:00 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Meeting up with some friends to get take out in DTLA. They complain about it being sketchy and basically traffic anarchy. Taking everything in my power to not say ‚ÄúInvite the 3rd world, get the 3rd world.‚Äù
1338046894757441539 2020-12-13 17:03:34 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @eurog3nic Lol easier said than done. Tried that. It didn‚Äôt work out due to political differences.
1338045920840073217 2020-12-13 16:59:41 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Maybe it‚Äôs just a Midwestern thing. When and where I grew up even lower income families could afford houses with a separate room for every kid
1338045273449197569 2020-12-13 16:57:07 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> How am I supposed to have a bunch of white children with these housing prices and stagnant wages?
1338033211348152321 2020-12-13 16:09:11 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @MattWalshBlog Absolutely insulting. It‚Äôs pity.
1338031123717189635 2020-12-13 16:00:53 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @EuropeanRevolt I‚Äôd say so. Being a woman people automatically feel safe and comfortable around me. It‚Äôs normalized for men to take care of me and give me things.
1334969183910514688 2020-12-05 05:13:50 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Space travel is White culture lol
1332021686435147776 2020-11-27 02:01:32 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Are straight white people not allowed to be on the Macy‚Äôs Thanksgiving parade?? Also, Verizon shoved down our throats.
1331742657635258369 2020-11-26 07:32:46 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Crazies on 4chan get on white women for race mixing but I get it. On dating apps black men are the only ones to send me romantic messages and I get how more vulnerable women can fall for that. White men step up your game please.
1330770052690239489 2020-11-23 15:07:59 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> They were poorly written and boring.
1329195820848087041 2020-11-19 06:52:33 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Another find from my friends social media...seems more like a self own that blk people are less responsible and don‚Äôt pay back their loans.  https://t.co/Jds7UndQRD
1329194959493230594 2020-11-19 06:49:08 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> No. It‚Äôs frustrating that people are moving into our communities and not bothering to learn English.  https://t.co/CJS5OEcDzJ
1328540589239910402 2020-11-17 11:28:54 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @WomenPostingLs Whatever helps them sleep at night...
1328538361267515392 2020-11-17 11:20:03 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not very feminist of me but I want a man to handle the meat at Thanksgiving‚Äù  It is absolutely a man‚Äôs job to provide THE MEAT. Heh Or at any social gathering for that matter. A man‚Äôs place is outside grilling with the boys while the ladies are in the kitchen making sides.
1328537483089383426 2020-11-17 11:16:33 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I like trying to slowly encourage more traditional values in my friends. My friends will say stuff like ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not very feminist of me but I want a man to...‚Äù and I‚Äôm over here just like yes yes, do not feel bad, it is a man‚Äôs job to do that.
1328533942467588096 2020-11-17 11:02:29 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> White people really are a gift to the world. Helping others.
1326597112079867904 2020-11-12 02:46:13 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> This needs to stop
1325231388413452289 2020-11-08 08:19:19 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Costco was packed. I only heard two other people speaking English. They also have tons of kids.
1325231192333934592 2020-11-08 08:18:32 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Actually, after just going to Costco and being one of the only white people there. It‚Äôs over for us. We will never be able to pass meaningful immigration reform. The sea of brown will always vote for handouts and more immigrants.
1325219752533372929 2020-11-08 07:33:05 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Now is the time for smarter, less abrasive right wing candidates. I see so many that run but don‚Äôt really understand the issues.
1324908995073638400 2020-11-07 10:58:14 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @elonmusk so since Tesla got a tequila, i‚Äôd like to suggest a Space X vodka with a collectible bottle that‚Äôs the booster with movable landing legs please
1322751499894579200 2020-11-01 12:05:07 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @__Mdhzombo 3 or 7. 4-6 seem too crazy
1322063551058464770 2020-10-30 14:31:27 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I just want to get married and settle down and have bbqs. I don‚Äôt want to have to spend my time vetting people  and getting my heart broke. I‚Äôm too old for this shit.
1322043893538381824 2020-10-30 13:13:21 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @PoliticsReid Ugh even more propaganda to convince me to move to Idaho. I‚Äôm seriously considering it.
1322043596095172611 2020-10-30 13:12:10 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Got jokingly called a kkk member by a liberal because I‚Äôm against affirmative action.... so advocating against special treatment and taking away jobs from deserving white candidates based on race levels is all it took. Give me a hood I guess
1322023723709263872 2020-10-30 11:53:12 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Spooky_Lucid Biden supporters are basically just mindless zombies who turn out to vote blue no matter who anyway
1321709155044880384 2020-10-29 15:03:13 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Planning a move and deciding where to live like...  https://t.co/l9Tcn1awHe
1321706072889982976 2020-10-29 14:50:58 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I love masculinity
1321665691087351808 2020-10-29 12:10:30 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @krystakatt92 My take- middle America they can afford a home and are busy having kid number 3 meanwhile those of us that live in diverse areas can‚Äôt afford a house or family so we spend more time being angry online. I was boring politically before I left the Midwest for CA for work.
1321588864700444672 2020-10-29 07:05:13 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @USPoliticsPoll Who are these people? Are they even women? They are very tall and kinda broad shouldered.
1320887460461621248 2020-10-27 08:38:06 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @jmrphy Sign me up. I moved to the west coast but I want to import a Midwestern man from back home.
1320887155950907392 2020-10-27 08:36:53 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @mariaachongg Great...just as I‚Äôm about to move up to the area.
1320136060660166656 2020-10-25 06:52:18 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Why are these being sold in America? If you love it GO BACK. We don‚Äôt want you here.  https://t.co/COWsYSAybh
1320091150762594309 2020-10-25 03:53:51 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I hate this. Don‚Äôt call me a person who bleeds. I‚Äôm a woman and I have a uterus and I‚Äôm proud of it. You never see women with reproductive issues complaining about not feeling included...
1319442430681178113 2020-10-23 08:56:04 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> My friends are scared to put their race (white) on a job application instead selecting ‚ÄòPrefer to not answer‚Äù so they don‚Äôt get passed over for job yet they march for BLM
1318668143531753472 2020-10-21 05:39:19 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> So had our yearly check in meeting and only spent 10 minutes talking about the work we actually do and the rest was about diversity. The things I heard...we are truly living in clown world.
1318283751860830210 2020-10-20 04:11:53 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I‚Äôm tired of being stressed. I‚Äôm tired of the lack of commitment from men these days. I‚Äôm tired of having my time wasted.
1318090046684065793 2020-10-19 15:22:10 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> When people call me a fed I‚Äôm like god... I wish I had that job security and benefits package
1315542603077611528 2020-10-12 14:39:32 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> In California I am voting NO on proposition 16. Being able to discriminate based on race to fill quotas should stay banned.
1315386715968696320 2020-10-12 04:20:06 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @TheHinduDindu These types of men really do need to take it up a notch and get a couch though. How are you supposed to have company over?
1315205617787658240 2020-10-11 16:20:29 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Ok I‚Äôm done ranting about the environment. Our world is beautiful. And it‚Äôs worth fighting for.
1315203647244955650 2020-10-11 16:12:39 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @TheHinduDindu @YoungtreeB They‚Äôre not wrong. The idiocy of the current right wing will get us there.
1315201726689935360 2020-10-11 16:05:01 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I bet the people who think climate change is a hoax don‚Äôt even know about ocean acidification. The climate is changing naturally yes, but we are causing it to change too fast! And animals aren‚Äôt able to adapt and we risk ecosystem collapse.
1315200295631089664 2020-10-11 15:59:20 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> It absolutely infuriates me that the right does not care about climate change. It is the consensus of scientists everywhere that we, humans, are exacerbating climate change. Erratic weather and droughts are happening. You think immigration is bad now? Just wait.
1315199195888799744 2020-10-11 15:54:58 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> SE Asia may be the ones doing the majority of the active polluting but it‚Äôs mainly the boardrooms in the West where the decisions about manufacturing, shipping, and labor are made.
1315198385134084098 2020-10-11 15:51:44 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> America and Europe need to lead the world on climate change (like we lead the world in basically everything else) in order to force SE Asia into complying. China isn‚Äôt going to do the right thing on their own.
1315197324788817920 2020-10-11 15:47:32 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @JosephPrichard7 This is such bs because. 1- white Americans are allowed to have culturally identity. If we didn‚Äôt why would black people claim adopted black kids grew up ‚Äútoo white‚Äù. 2- black pride movements definitely DID have black supremacists
1315193399213875200 2020-10-11 15:31:56 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @OrwellNGoode Someday she may look back on this and be embarrassed of what she said while she was so mentally ill
1315193031214071809 2020-10-11 15:30:28 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @StupidWhiteAds It sounds ridiculous but it does though...methane does contribute to climate change. And white countries will be even more overrun with third worlders if we don‚Äôt try to address it!
1315192447194943488 2020-10-11 15:28:09 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @AvdullahYousef I blame the economy and simp life
1315191551488737281 2020-10-11 15:24:35 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @audreyy_kaye capitalism run amok
1315191164941737986 2020-10-11 15:23:03 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @womenofeuropa_ I wish I lived in a quaint village and someone would do this to my hair everyday
1315190896938291201 2020-10-11 15:21:59 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Late Night Hot take: America was built by Europeans, for Europeans. Much of the political tourmoil today is because we are trying to pretend that it wasn‚Äôt.
1315188874486976512 2020-10-11 15:13:57 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @IGN Sounds like he doesn‚Äôt like to have fun. Let people enjoy things. Does anyone remember and rewatch films nominated for best picture? No.
1315093054026469376 2020-10-11 08:53:11 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @TheVolklina 19.5. Got hazel eyes and dark brown hair ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
1313718815138562049 2020-10-07 13:52:27 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @realDonaldTrump Jobs at what environmental cost? So big corps can just profit off the plastic? Keep Americans safe and ban fracking. We‚Äôre better than this.
1313571968138973184 2020-10-07 04:08:56 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I‚Äôm so thankful I was loved and praised as a child. Having a good relationship with a paternal figure really makes all the difference. Only downside is my expectations in men are quite high.
1313569331557490688 2020-10-07 03:58:28 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Imagine letting this clown post an ad for you as your ‚Äúsenior creative advisor‚Äù with make up and hair like that... this he or ‚Äúshe‚Äù is not ok  https://t.co/GkpvEpkmP2
1313272327396679680 2020-10-06 08:18:16 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Daddyissues__ I‚Äôm 30 and I can‚Äôt get one to marry me. Lol I was in a relationship for 9 years and he never popped the question so I popped out of his life. Then wasted 3 years on someone else. Ugh
1313260984421679104 2020-10-06 07:33:12 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @realDonaldTrump This is not something to be proud of... America has the best natural areas and fisheries in the world BECAUSE of regulation. We need to expand the ESA and EPA! Clean water for all Americans!
1313188000524767232 2020-10-06 02:43:11 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> All liberals do is simp for black people...
1313186857039978497 2020-10-06 02:38:39 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @realDonaldTrump What about healthcare for the people who make it out of the womb? I feel like that‚Äôs pro life.
1313186268424007680 2020-10-06 02:36:18 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> All people care about these days are racial issues. Talking about the environment to my friends? Crickets. They see someone on the internet somewhere say BLM are the real racists? Non stop rage and discussion.
1313174328293249024 2020-10-06 01:48:52 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Oil companies and plastic producing companies need to be held accountable. They are destroying our future. I want a future for white children. We need some type of Green New Deal.
1313172832801583105 2020-10-06 01:42:55 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I‚Äôm pissed off that caring for the environment is a partisan issue. The fossil fuel industry is poisoning the entire planet but republicans seem to like supporting fracking and the fossil fuel industry.
1312954618310082560 2020-10-05 11:15:49 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @90DayFckery I probably would too. Tania seems like that girl that‚Äôs always got problems and makes a huge deal out of them or wants to just talk it out and I‚Äôd get exhausted.
1312148829429362688 2020-10-03 05:53:54 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that every non-binary or genderqueer person I‚Äôve ever met is severely mentally ill.
1312091780997812224 2020-10-03 02:07:12 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I just want to be a semi traditional wifey and plan southern bbq dinner parties and make table arrangements and also there are chickens running around üò≠
1312071995534708736 2020-10-03 00:48:35 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> You see men complaining about women these days‚Ñ¢Ô∏è but 95% of the men I see online dating are peak liberal soy boys. With piercings and the weakest hunched over postures. They look defenseless and sad. It‚Äôs that or some jock type that looks too full of themselves and their clothes
1311751142821359616 2020-10-02 03:33:38 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Astro_Fash Ugh yes. I am so tired of woke white people gushing over how good african food is. I am done hearing about Ethiopian food. It doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs worth the hype.
1311485957204443136 2020-10-01 09:59:53 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Or like üò§üèîüßóüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüöµüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I‚Äôd take either except the one I just listed because I‚Äôm not trying to wake up at 4am on a Saturday to bike up a mountain
1311195095480193025 2020-09-30 14:44:06 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Media__Ferret I don‚Äôt get this dig at Biden. But I‚Äôve also never liked personal attacks. I don‚Äôt care if joe needs meds or help to function. It‚Äôs not like he is single-handedly going to run the country.
1311121550410563584 2020-09-30 09:51:51 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> This debate is a shit show. They shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed in the same room.
1310993679666966528 2020-09-30 01:23:44 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @McBricko @JosephPrichard7 I‚Äôm tired of having these pop up at work. Get a real job that contributes instead of preaching.
1310829272546721794 2020-09-29 14:30:27 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I was a Bernie supporter. I don‚Äôt think people should get benefits based on the color of their skin. Health care for all. College for all. Better wages for all. A college system based on parental income is flawed. Parents aren‚Äôt forced to pay. Leaving a some kids SOL
1310827079722655749 2020-09-29 14:21:44 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @BBCWorld He absolutely should NOT be allowed around children.
1310826594114519041 2020-09-29 14:19:48 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I worry if I have a son someday he will live in a country that puts him last. Where I won‚Äôt be able to afford to college for them but POC will get free rides. Joe Biden‚Äôs platform reads as white extinction. Just bring in immigrants instead of investing in ppl already here.
1310825974095687681 2020-09-29 14:17:20 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I‚Äôm super conflicted on who to vote for. I wish Trump had more information on how he is going to help working families. His campaign website is scarce on actual plans. Meanwhile Biden‚Äôs is basically a novel. Joe has good ideas but they seem to only apply to women and POC...
1310811984292491264 2020-09-29 13:21:45 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @USPoliticsPoll I can‚Äôt. Liberal roommates will seeth and rage so hard they may kill themselves hearing Trump speak
1310811773767839745 2020-09-29 13:20:55 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I made this account not taking it seriously at first just to get away from it all and now it‚Äôs my main Twitter acct. I can actually like whatever tweets I want without worrying about people I know seeing it. Can‚Äôt have wrongthink.
1310810950715363328 2020-09-29 13:17:38 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> TDS is real. One of my friends is trying to get their dad, a gunsmith, to unfriend his Trump supporting/anti-BLM fb friends...
1310406636410789889 2020-09-28 10:31:02 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @JosephPrichard7 I‚Äôd never want to miss out on all the chaos
1310406054086242304 2020-09-28 10:28:44 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Luckily, I moved to a less melanated, higher income neighborhood that this never happens. But I can‚Äôt go to the beach here without hearing it.
1310405546332180480 2020-09-28 10:26:43 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Imagine a world where you‚Äôd never have to hear a shitty car blasting ghetto rap music so loud the bass shakes your windows and ear rapes everyone‚Äôs in a half mile radius ever again. They aren‚Äôt civilized and can‚Äôt life with us.
1310118457619349505 2020-09-27 15:25:55 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @snitchery This change is abhorrent
1309540157465350144 2020-09-26 01:07:58 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @USPoliticsPoll I would slap anyone for $5,000. In this economy? I‚Äôll take what I can get.
1309271153320407040 2020-09-25 07:19:02 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @JosephPrichard7 There was a dating experiment where people sent in their clothes and you picked someone based on scent and so many people made fun of it but I would 1000% do it. A good smelling man is a rare joy in life. So hard to find.
1308293087618240513 2020-09-22 14:32:33 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @FizzyGutz Why can‚Äôt they just draw what they want? Why do they have to include every race and skin tone?
1307814509151625217 2020-09-21 06:50:51 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @exposing_white He was so cute üò≠
1307216326046306304 2020-09-19 15:13:53 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt care who wins the election because I don‚Äôt think either of them are going to get anything I‚Äôd want done anyway. Roe Vs Wade doesn‚Äôt affect me bc I‚Äôm responsible. But I don‚Äôt like overpopulation soooo
1307213375990947840 2020-09-19 15:02:10 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I don‚Äôt like either side but I only respect people who stick to their principles. I get so fed up with the hypocrisy on both sides.
1307211229140713473 2020-09-19 14:53:38 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @USPoliticsPoll As there should be. I can‚Äôt stand the hypocrisy. The establishment republicans just need to admit they don‚Äôt have morals they only care about power and holding it.
1307210862797582337 2020-09-19 14:52:11 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I don‚Äôt get the pro-life folks....if life is so precious what about miscarriages? What about kids who go to shitty public schools?
1306842850508775424 2020-09-18 14:29:50 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @realDonaldTrump @LadyIld Ok do more then. We need to fix our reliance on foreign seafood ASAP.

1305945297365811200 2020-09-16 03:03:16 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @JosephPrichard7 Most people just refuse to see it because they try to fill themselves with only peace and tolerance. No self preservation at all.
1305768368041897984 2020-09-15 15:20:13 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @USPoliticsPoll Get rid of Mitch

1304682911082242048 2020-09-12 15:27:00 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Why do we ‚Äúurgently‚Äù need to change the face of France???

1304682654281818112 2020-09-12 15:25:59 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Decided to do some reading about cuties and ....why are they like this  https://t.co/MlAt45nip0
1304669036454637570 2020-09-12 14:31:52 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Julia_36243 Yeah I‚Äôm so light I‚Äôm basically translucent and just pink

1304592992028688384 2020-09-12 09:29:42 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Astro_Fash My mom got me the MyHeritage one for Christmas a while back. I want to get the AncestryDNA kit because that one seems to go into specific regions. This is boring and not detailed enough.  https://t.co/HY8CiE0Mrv
1304585075309178880 2020-09-12 08:58:14 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Also I didn‚Äôt realize golf was so popular? Boring and a waste of a natural area.
1304584831909552128 2020-09-12 08:57:16 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> None of these men look easy going or chill. I have never climbed a mountain and honestly I don‚Äôt plan on it. I don‚Äôt want some dude that constantly talks about how they went backpacking in third world countries. I have enough friends that do that and it‚Äôs obnoxious.
1304582087723409410 2020-09-12 08:46:22 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I made a dating profile to see what was out there and it was awful
1304507005739048961 2020-09-12 03:48:01 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @SionSPG @StMattsBetsy @BBCWorld It‚Äôs called parthenogenesis and it‚Äôs possible in lower vertebrates. Mostly common in plants and invertebrates. There is a species of lizard that is all female. No fertilization needed.

1304505849767849984 2020-09-12 03:43:25 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Going to the St. Louis zoo reptile house all the time growing up was a highlight of my childhood. Love the St. Louis zoo! Neat story.
1303911747720413184 2020-09-10 12:22:40 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> How am I supposed to have my PNW idyllic homestead if it‚Äôs ON FIRE. Will this at least make housing prices go down?
1303911123968643072 2020-09-10 12:20:12 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I want to get more in touch with my Germanic roots and heritage. In a pagan way. I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my own land and trying to grow herbs and fruits that my ancestors did.
1303909664812228608 2020-09-10 12:14:24 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @itsyaboyvp @MattWalshBlog These are the new ‚ÄúLive Laugh Love‚Äù basic bitch decor
1303909279632515075 2020-09-10 12:12:52 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @JosephPrichard7 The people deserve it but not the wildlife and nature. I was going to take a trip to Big Sur but couldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs ON FIRE. California is a beautiful place....outside of the population centers.
1303529909801816064 2020-09-09 11:05:23 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Well...I guess I won‚Äôt care about the Oscars ever again. Stop forcing diversity!  https://t.co/pUFcpfVanh
1303491277397192704 2020-09-09 08:31:52 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I‚Äôm really excited about getting into growing heirloom herbs and vegetables. I love the idea of growing seeds that were passed down and that are uncommon. I‚Äôm also looking to get some European herbs that were used as medicine by my ancestors. Grow your own! üå±‚ù§Ô∏èüåæ
1303377702062227456 2020-09-09 01:00:34 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @RazzZinger I already have a mask on because it‚Äôs courtesy at this point also I have a huge zit I‚Äôm trying to cover.
1303173875673358337 2020-09-08 11:30:38 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> The powers that be completely messed up race relations. Blaming an entire race for the perceived injustices of our ancestors is insane. How more people aren‚Äôt fighting back against the insanity just shows how well peer pressure works.
1302152814307635201 2020-09-05 15:53:18 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @USPoliticsPoll Just say ‚Äúoopie daisy‚Äù and all is fixed
1302080153959374848 2020-09-05 11:04:34 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I need a man who isn‚Äôt scared of my weird pet bugs
1302007248500162566 2020-09-05 06:14:52 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Kekkadivvy I can kind of see where the legislation is coming from, but all pedophilia should be on the sex offender registry, not just gay. He picked a weird hill to die on.
1301964564410413056 2020-09-05 03:25:16 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @KatieDaviscourt I love to see it. Get them out of the beautiful PNW. They always protest in the most liberal strongholds where they can get away with it and I‚Äôm glad they are being stopped. I want law and order!
1301684313587478528 2020-09-04 08:51:39 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Hopefully white people will be willing to do those jobs üëÄ  This is what I want. We shouldn‚Äôt be using 3RD world people as our cheap labor source. Hopefully our rural counties will accept this and give up the meth.
1301655838277251072 2020-09-04 06:58:30 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I will also never put my pronouns in my email or bio. You‚Äôd think weirdos would have thicker skin by now.
1301654718339407872 2020-09-04 06:54:03 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> I get emails daily about diversity training sessions. I hope I am never forced to attend. Tax dollars are going towards this...
1301645374738710528 2020-09-04 06:16:55 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Astro_Fash What do we do to make college better? It‚Äôs a complicated issue. People think colleges turn out liberals but that‚Äôs only bc unis tend to try to make people more worldly and tolerant. Do we teach hate instead? That won‚Äôt pass. Getting rid of some of the humanities would help tho.
1301642886866321409 2020-09-04 06:07:02 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Astro_Fash Cool then our country will not produce engineers or scientists and our country will fail without technological advances. I have a lot of friends who are teachers and college professors...they‚Äôre not teaching Marxism wtf
1301225775908007936 2020-09-03 02:29:35 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @Variety Lol good for her.
1301224313295532032 2020-09-03 02:23:46 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> Workplace leadership in this teleconference talking about making policies to ensure diversity and make changes...I don‚Äôt like listening to other white people talk about our replacement. The best candidates should get the job. Race shouldn‚Äôt be a factor.
1301195497508487169 2020-09-03 00:29:16 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @MadameEuropa So many people have ruined feminism. You can still be feminist and be feminine. I like having rights and protection from sexual harassment.

1300989873780736000 2020-09-02 10:52:11 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @OrwellNGoode I smile at everyone I make eye contract with because it‚Äôs NICE and the American way! lol
1300687513426616321 2020-09-01 14:50:43 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @BasedChino @Astro_Fash This is what I‚Äôve noticed too. Like go check on your distant aunts/uncles/cousins/friends in the inner city instead and tell them to raise their kids right. I don‚Äôt sympathize with criminals.
1300681227293216770 2020-09-01 14:25:44 +0800 <PowerKraut9000> @aralyna_seule @ErikVidfarne I‚Äôll be the gardener and grow veggies and herbs! Also I want cows.
