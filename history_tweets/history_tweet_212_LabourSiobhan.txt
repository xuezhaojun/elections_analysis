1319322194984521729 2020-10-23 00:58:17 +0800 <LabourSiobhan> @lauren1995x__ Not much good doing community work if families are in a constant cycle of debt because of low wages and high rents, and perpetually in debt...but Tories dgaf about that do they. Sam Murray needs to have a read of The Ragged Trousered Philanthropist. This shit isn't new.

Did her teacher training 2018/19...&amp; autumn half term in a local college (apparently unable to handle difficult children by accs I've heard from colleagues &amp;pupils...). She was shipped in to North Devon to replace Peter Heaton Jones.
