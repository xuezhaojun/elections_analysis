It's like when trump decides blue states are inhabited by useless, witch hunting, idiots when there are plenty of repubs living in said states. He "cuts his nose off despite his face" as they say.

He wanted to be some kind of twisted hero dangling 2K in our faces🙄

For four years he's done little else than perform publicity stunts to create hate/fear mongering, doubt, anger and chaos. He's trying to leave a much bullshite as he can for Joe/Kamala to undo but soon enough he'll find out how intolerant inmates are of him  https://t.co/8OImOXmQw8

1343370891657424901 2020-12-28 09:39:13 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @itsJeffTiedrich Trump. He's the opitome of an ignorant, childish &amp; narcissistic bully. He knows it pisses taxpayers of that he's having us foot the bill for his vacation. Pretty sure he's just going to stay in FL, as his pride will likely keep him from the  Inauguration.

1343369389245161472 2020-12-28 09:33:15 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @robreiner He is an overgrown petulant child who is a bully. He's yanking as many chains as possible in the sandbox before he's expelled for good. He'll make lots of friends of his fellow bullies in prison, I'm sure 👍
1343367854662574080 2020-12-28 09:27:09 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @RepsForBiden Because like the petulant child that he is, the bully in the sand box little donnie, had to yank everyone's chain once more before he's expelled for good.

By getting &amp; or spreading covid, you'll take up ICU beds needed for others who DO mask but are stricken by a heart attack or car crash etc. What of your family member needed that bed??🤨  https://t.co/ndM05P1HsE

I think the reason he didn't show is bc the spot light is on the vaccine not his heinous behind.

Ppl are going hungry, losing jobs &amp; homes, can't buy life saving meds etc but JO can't be bothered. How many ppl would 4.4 MILLION dollars feed ?? Very christian of ya Joel... such a greasy, greedy🍆
1339223390582923265 2020-12-16 22:58:32 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Imagine if trump had said this to his elected officials/staff etc instead of feeding his fucking ego with rallies,wh &amp; other super spreader vents. People died &amp; will die bv of his narcissistic lies. It's a cold, the flu, a dem hoax. No, its death  https://t.co/oiZozhXhZU
1339221667915182081 2020-12-16 22:51:41 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @RexChapman Yeah. Imagine if trump had said these things to his elected officials, staff, trumpers &amp; the American public hope many lived wouldn't have been lost. Instead he fed his ego with super spreader rallies &amp; wh events. That to me is tantamount to murder.
1339207840767102976 2020-12-16 21:56:45 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @thedailybeast Throwing a trumper tantrum, hes trying to show the world what they deserve for a rigged election. He'll create a much chaos as he can until he's evicted. He needs to learn that just because he has one for doesn't mean he has to be one 🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆

1338938928158679041 2020-12-16 04:08:11 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Interesting. If trump and the first poodle win this way I'm seriously doing dual citizenship in Costa Rica.

1338929531525222403 2020-12-16 03:30:51 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @Bill_Maxwell_ Torn on this one. His family has been accused of many crimes so the whole snitches get stitches thing might scare him. At the same time he last maybe a day in prison. I suppose his anxiety/fear re: trump &amp; his family will decide

1338901081355640834 2020-12-16 01:37:48 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Once a grifter always a grifter. Trump's photo should be with the definition of the word.  https://t.co/DxX4OEZ0TL
1338900551094984704 2020-12-16 01:35:41 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @robreiner True. At least now everyone knows firsthand exactly what seated repubs encouraged, were complicit in, shot down &amp; ignored. Hopefully they will not be reelected. Some need to be charged with crimes as trump will be.
1338745421628321794 2020-12-15 15:19:15 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @mmpadellan Right on. Trump wants to drain the swamp right? But he's the one with McConnell the turtle, barr as a nasty slimy wet toad &amp; repubs  the mosquitos, flies &amp; snakes ...lol

1338740660669648896 2020-12-15 15:00:20 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @GOP_U @RepPaulMitchell At least he spoke his mind and made no excuses. It's the same for people who are staunch repubs and voted for Biden/Harris they couldn't deal with trump's bs any longer. Can't blame them, as l was seriously headed for another country had trump cheated &amp; won.  https://t.co/JlfLyWLLL4

1338733922524467200 2020-12-15 14:33:34 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @RepPaulMitchell Wow. That took courage &amp; garners respect. As with any job of course there are hiccups along the road but trump &amp; all seated repubs had to be cruelly difficult to work with. Good for you !!
1338729770415247360 2020-12-15 14:17:04 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @GeorgeTakei Ripping ppl off selling prepper supplies it's always good to shoot your mouth off to generate better sales.

1338649740356034560 2020-12-15 08:59:03 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @donwinslow I couldn't be more proud. Trump has been smothering the country/world with his bs. Biden &amp; Harris are SUCH a breath of fresh air !!

1338648330998607873 2020-12-15 08:53:27 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @Bill_Maxwell_ I think every American who remembers this/ voted for Biden should send trump a delightful little Christmas card with that quote inside. It'll brighten his days to know we all care SO much... just saying...lol

I never thought I'd see so many cultural,racial &amp; political issues not just addressed but protested over and finally on the road to being fixed. Comparable to the past, what a great time to be an American, unlike trump.

1338618176574267395 2020-12-15 06:53:38 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @adriaAAPT @BMeiselas I think a good many Americans feel the same way. I've also learned a whole lot more about our government (where it fails/ where it shines)  than I'd thought I needed to, over the last 4 years. Thank God trump's officially (again) out of the running now. He needs to go to prison
1338616883742912514 2020-12-15 06:48:30 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @lbillberg @BMeiselas Done and done. California dropped the vote and now trump can be sent from the white house to the big house!!

Don't call him an attention ¤¤¤¤¤ (rhymes with door, store, more lol) bc last time I did, l got put on Twitter time out for 7 days lol.

Also mail tampering(DeJoy will flip on DT) criminal intentional negligent homicide for keeping covid from us for so long then lying(the flu, a cold, dem hoax) theft bc he's ripping off taxpayers-he charges rooms,food etc to the WH when he &amp; SS stay @ his resort.

I don't get it... it's like a kid getting life in prison for shoplifting &amp; someone who murders a gas station clerk gets 20 hrs community service. That's totally Bass-ackwards.  https://t.co/xCy1o5hZts
1335401580284276739 2020-12-06 09:52:01 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @andrewlaureti @kylegriffin1 It may be. The hatch act doesn't apply to him by from what I've read if he's working on his campaign from the oval office etc it's illegal. But hey, he had his campaign rally on the white house lawn and no one does trump. This is why he feels he's above the law, ppl let him.  https://t.co/6nCKAOjJ5z
1335400130091110400 2020-12-06 09:46:16 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Example 258,694,001 that trump didn't give a shit about politics. He wanted fame &amp; fortune(fucking over taxpayers) and he got it. Now all he wants is to soothe his ego. He has the first🐩 poodle &amp; enough pathetic ass kisser 🐕 lap dogs~ maybe they should kiss his.... ego.  https://t.co/XFiA95WERF

He's crazy. When the votes were re- counted the few vote stragglers actually turned up for Biden. How many of his base are broke for giving trump $$  https://t.co/GbOM3Ot4kD

I shudder to think what kind of accident(s) that kind of speeding could cause. 🙄
1332247866602106880 2020-11-27 17:00:18 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Wouldn't it be nice if we would all just call them like we see them minus the hype for ratings ? Every seated repub is just as guilty as trump for letting him stay in office. Who's going to swear out warrants on them?On Loeffler &amp; her husband if he's guilty of inside info fraud?  https://t.co/4FLjHfrXNF

1332161534169128960 2020-11-27 11:17:14 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Had a doctor played games with the covid existence/severity/ probable death to begin with, then downplayed it as a cold, flu, hoax and then pretend to get/recover from it, he'd be in prison already.

Had to uproot to MI to get friggin surgery

I think it's like you have to ask for the right Dr and God wants you to look on line, friend suggestions etc then he'll guide you to the right one? Perhaps asking for help makes your needs known? Just my .O2 cents worth 🙂

1328538619146100737 2020-11-17 11:21:04 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Sadly, had he put as much energy into doing good he'd have been a decent potus. Instead he used hate, greed, revenge, racism,fear &amp; his fragile little ego to rule his life &amp; thus the country.That should buy him a decent bunk in prison-his sweethearts are all waiting.Eagerly.  https://t.co/oPNJo0pE8i

Porn stars, golf trips on our dime, covid is a cold, flu, hoax, disinfectant shots,ALL will get tests, faking covid, alienating the world, not paying taxes for 10 of 15 years? It kind of put us off.

Did you really expect loved ones would vote for him?

1325263313719189507 2020-11-08 10:26:10 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Biden &amp; Harris were so happy to address the nation. He asked for unity &amp; she praised the women who went before her passing the way for a woman to run and win. Both made me very proud to be an American. It's been 4 years since I could say that 🇺🇸l hope trump watched the speeches

1324110927587921920 2020-11-05 06:07:00 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @Temocracy17 @Acosta From your lips to RBGs ear !!!
1324110405669654528 2020-11-05 06:04:56 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @TeamTrump @EricTrump Just because your daddy's been screaming like a three yo about cheating, illegal ballots etc (since before we even started voting)doesn't make it so. Y'all are so pissed that your dirty tricks(ask DeJoy) aren't working so now you want to call Democrats cheats.Grow up, get over it
1324109101547298826 2020-11-05 05:59:45 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @TeamTrump @EricTrump Idiotic. You KNOW ppl HAVE to be trained to be a poll watcher. If you're not on election staff you don't go into the polls after you vote. Your family is always doing nefarious things(kids charity anyone) thats why you think Joe's cheating.Shhh..daddy isn't gonna love ya, own it  https://t.co/oPELQEtUu8
1324106999769026562 2020-11-05 05:51:24 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @kmartDP @BidenWarRoom This meme shows how desperate repubs are. Feeling a little behind the 8 ball are we? Who wins is anyone guess but l doubt trump will go peacefully &amp; I'm sure he will waste millions in rediculous recounts &amp; court cases.🙄
1324105150273884162 2020-11-05 05:44:03 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @xsanbry @BidenWarRoom Suuuuurrrre.  you can likely sell us each a parsel of oceanfront property in Iowa too right? Anyone can make up a letter to post. The polls are closed so who cares
1324026400190377987 2020-11-05 00:31:07 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Well here's your proof that trump was able to buy DeJoy. I wonder if trump paid him off with his million $ donation. When all of this comes to the courts I hope like hell DeJoy flips on trump.
1324023437539639300 2020-11-05 00:19:21 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Yes !!!
1324022888421273608 2020-11-05 00:17:10 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Dear trump Want to go to TX and visit the covid crowd and tell them they're rounding the corner??

1324021747188932608 2020-11-05 00:12:38 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @TheRealHoarse @MeidasTouch Very well put ! It will be nice to have the Biden Harris team in the white house actually fighting for the success of this country, not lining their pockets &amp; getting Americans killed.
1324021255872356352 2020-11-05 00:10:41 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Trump, go home you're drunk.   Win, lose or draw this is NOT the United States of trump, Russia, Iran or China. It's the United States of America and democracy (not you)  rules the day. Sit down hold your tongue and wait like everyone else to accept the results.
1324020294693101570 2020-11-05 00:06:52 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @kylewendel If trump's worried about integrity he'd step down. He's lost his mind. The election hasn't even been called &amp; he's going to fucking court. Words can't express how sick l am of trump and his repub lap dogs.
1324019100000157699 2020-11-05 00:02:07 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @RepAdamSchiff Exactly. Military &amp; civilians overseas have another week to have their votes postmarked as well as counted. Patience is the word of the day unless Biden flips more for the electoral numbers 😀

Trying to cheat isn't working &amp; he needs to kennel his repub lap dogs/lawyers. He's wasting time &amp; money.

Always on the prowl for a new way to cheat &amp; "work the system" l hope trump loses sleep over this election.

1323372135172263938 2020-11-03 05:11:18 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Trump doesn't seem to understand our care that our brave, patriotic men and women in arms are the 1st line of defense to protect his orange arse. As with any Americans their votes matter !!!  https://t.co/N6VGyc0gyV
1323371243609952257 2020-11-03 05:07:46 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> I really am glad that when elected, Biden plans to get the US back on board w/ the Paris agreement.

1323029976988397568 2020-11-02 06:31:41 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> In a nutshell he's an insensitive,rude,lying, insecure,uneducated, hateful jerk. But we already knew that.

1323000275808997391 2020-11-02 04:33:40 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> I think he believes every American citizen believes his rediculously goofy diatribe.

1321579862981812225 2020-10-29 06:29:27 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @kylegriffin1 The saddest things are 1) trump doesn't care 2) people will still vote for him after he abandoned them in freezing weather for hours 3) his many were covid infected at the event AND will take it home to their families, churches, schools etc. Way to go trump.  https://t.co/7RPwMQjtAg
1321579169642434560 2020-10-29 06:26:42 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Not even a blip on the radar of apology from the user in cheif. If we knew he knew, but he already got his big ole rally &amp; left.Wonder if he cares some were  hospitalized w/hypothermia and l wonder how many were covid infected at the event. Brilliant trump, just fucking brilliant  https://t.co/52ph2OyY31

There HAS to be a way to keep trump from becoming the dictator he'd like to continue being. Voting him out is one option but God forbid he cheats &amp; wins, we MUST be prepared to stop the dangerous ideals.He CAN be  arrested even as a sitting potus.  https://t.co/tOTFa6l06l
1321575538276864001 2020-10-29 06:12:16 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Hundreds of rally goers stranded in freezing weather, elder folks and kids among those who were left by trump's idiotic ppl who didn't have busses set to take ppl back to their cars. Sure, trump loves everyone right? Not even a peep of an apology, he already got what he wanted  https://t.co/KuptxnCPJB
1321573994714324992 2020-10-29 06:06:08 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> REALITY CHECK TRUMP: ☠☠☠ 40 STATES ADDED 5000,000 NEW COVID CASES IN ONE WEEK !! THAT'S HALF A FUCKING MILLION.

1319085101809098752 2020-10-22 09:16:10 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Any US citizen who is planning to vote for trump, please watch "How the world sees America" a report by Fareed Zakaria.Besides the covid issues, there are many many things you may have forgotten about that trump did to gain popularity with Putin, to insult Nato etc. So UNAmerican  https://t.co/3d2EvhBJKp

All I could think of was Americans worrying re: rent/feeding their kids,PPE, homeless shelters bursting at the seams etc. I would bless a church or food bank NOT buy art

Once he's gone l wonder how many secret service ppl, Drs nurses, wh staff and his admin folks will say they had to sign non disclosure agreements. He'll stop at nothing to win.

It's obvious with his comments re: leaving the country, ramming his nominee through and creating more chaos for Biden/Harris and no commitment to peaceful turn over

1317623358582902785 2020-10-18 08:27:43 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Trump's very toxic, most will agree. If you are going to vote for him please watch a film  called The way I see it. It's about Pete Souza, WH photographer to Reagan then 8 yrs to Obama. It will remind you what a president looks/ acts like. Just as Joe will.🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 📫vote blue !!🗳

She not only nodded constantly, she fussed w/ things in her purse seeming to create a visual distraction. Cheap tricks by a cheap facsimile of a man. Biden kicked ass, dt just acted like one.  https://t.co/PY4oYELHrm
1316962297940672513 2020-10-16 12:40:54 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> All Americans who are able to cast a vote and have not yet done so, please read this. Read it again before you actually cast your ballot and think... if trump's ignored every word of the preamble, why would he even bother to run this country any differently than he has?  https://t.co/4rPOYt0Cit
1316962294669115394 2020-10-16 12:40:53 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> The woman behind trump during the town hall kept nodding at every point trump lied about/skirted. Can't tell me she wasn't a plant. Making trump look believable.... didn't work. He blustered &amp; went off the rails, wading into the weeds many many times. Typical.  https://t.co/9lAPxvyW46
1316962277191462912 2020-10-16 12:40:49 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> trump and undecided voters: yet another example of why trump cannot and should never again be trusted to tell the truth.  https://t.co/k9FrQ5qJYI
1316927147555102722 2020-10-16 10:21:13 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @HuffPost Watched one, recorded the other. Composting trump's bs. He's so easily frightened by/ angry at strong, smart, accomplished women. Go Savanah lol
1316926762861907969 2020-10-16 10:19:42 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @atrupar Pretty sure of i tried that, they'd toss my Ass in jail. I can only hope, pray, cheer with pom poms, that trump ends up in prison and I DON'T mean club fed!
1316924748912353280 2020-10-16 10:11:42 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @Mike_Pence Keep spreading the "love" Mikey. You DO know that man, country and God all hold you equally culpable for a great many preventable Covid DEATHS right? allowing trump to hide the virus is tantamount to mass murder. Ask mommy to look up the chapter/verse re: YOU SHALT NOT KILL ...  https://t.co/wCPw0hOk3Z
1316920680341000200 2020-10-16 09:55:32 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @RepsForBiden He is so frightened of strong, smart, opinionated women. He calls them names like a 4 th grade bully Monster,Pocahontas etc. Savanah Guthrie is all of those things and that stress + no teleprompter he's easily panicked, angred &amp; flustered.l disagree she's letting him off the hook
1316919382388375553 2020-10-16 09:50:22 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @donwinslow Savanah Guthrie is asking questions he cannot/will not answer, thus showcasing (even to trumpers) just how incapable he is under stress. Anger, being condescending, belligerent,babbling. Is THIS what we want or need in a potus? Again????🙄
1316918605938892800 2020-10-16 09:47:17 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> He was never sick. He's using his"infection"and miracle "cure" as stage props and it's a SLAP IN THE FACE to every single AMERICAN ILLNESS/ DEATH due to covid which he dropped the fucking ball on, in every aspect. He's the most disgusting 'man' in the planet. Vote Biden !🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸  https://t.co/xbUcMrGWkG

1316917392262549509 2020-10-16 09:42:28 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @JohnMTalmadgeMD Tip of the iceberg. Guthrie is putting him on the spot and you can almost hear the fat sizzling. When he's off of his scripted teleprompter, he's SOOO easily flustered and his true colors shine blazingly- disgust, anger, self pity. Just when I thought l couldn't dislike him more.  https://t.co/hsNenPNT6p
1316915851279421442 2020-10-16 09:36:20 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @NBCPolitics @SavannahGuthrie Savanah Guthrie "you're the president not someone's crazy uncle" omg can Mary trump weigh in on this ?? Lies, denial, telling Savanah "oh nah, so cute" could he be any more condescending? And the woman over trump's shoulder nodding every time he speaks- THAT'S not an accident🙄
1316896085160374272 2020-10-16 08:17:48 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> It's sad to see a trump crowd in this great country and wonder how many of these people will be alive in a month.Not to mention their families, friends, teachers, waiters etc who chose NOT to go to the death rally. Disgusting, ignorant &amp; selfish all the way around.
1316802077763477505 2020-10-16 02:04:14 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @CNN These two need to be taken outside the courthouse and tortured in the EXACT same way. Let the punishment fit the fucking crime. Why is is you have to have a license to be a Dr, dentist, lawyer,  drive a car, fish, do massage, sell houses etc but NOT to be a parent?

Now he's sending Melania to try &amp; con the female voters in GA &amp; TX
1316103968766988289 2020-10-14 03:50:12 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @atrupar Nice try. Save=fail. And trumpers ragged on Biden for a mis-speak when he did he is running, not that he ran for the senate. One word &amp; they're spewing conspiracy theory that Pelosi et all are trying to get Biden elected then prove him unfit to place Harris in the potus' seat🙄  https://t.co/EY7bW5cmmZ
1316102803077705730 2020-10-14 03:45:34 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @atrupar Just a he made his worshipers wear masks as he took heat about it, l guess now he's using them as props to prove there's nothing to be afraid of with covid. Sadly l wonder how many rally goers will be dead in a month. How many innocents will they infect who DIDN'T choose to go?  https://t.co/0MpUWztM6R

I live in VA &amp; already registered months ago but what about those who still needed to? Will they add another day to the deadline?

Shall we tally up trump's mistakes/lies/ mental illness glitches? Oranges of a story, Yo-Semites, Tim Apple etc. Biden has actually been VP twice &amp; would step aside if he thought he couldn't be potus...  https://t.co/LOGTOIWKjo

Forgetting names, getting lost on a tarmac(3 diff X) inability to speak properly(oranges of a story, Yo-Semite, United shtates) the list goes on re trump's gaffes &amp; LIES  https://t.co/Eh9PqRl2rU

1316034979118428161 2020-10-13 23:16:04 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> I guess this is what trump means when he says we've rounded the corner on Corona &amp; not to be afraid of it. 50K ppl must not have gotten the memo about not letting it dominate their lives. Trump has NO integrity whatsoever  https://t.co/QdO2OOO1AK
1316034118837301251 2020-10-13 23:12:39 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @mmpadellan All of that and he says "you'd better vote for me". Puerto Rico has no votes in the presidential election. His writers hate when he goes off script and pretends to know what he's talking about.  https://t.co/SLrcDqa8VV

1313325247677050880 2020-10-06 11:48:34 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @bestcarediva @ProjectLincoln This is why he re staged his arrival to the WH photo op ~ he was grasping for air after that walk upstairs. Not because of covid(doubt he's even sick!)but bc he's an obese walrus in a suit.
1313324632162873344 2020-10-06 11:46:07 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @JenniferJJacobs @Yamiche Sure. If he were even sick. My thinking is he pulled a campaign stunt to get ppl who've lost loved ones to covid to vote for him, also to downplay the virus he frigging let us wander about with to fall ill/die. He lied, ppl died &amp; now he wants his base back. He screwed the pooch  https://t.co/ty92RFmygF

1312510883654889473 2020-10-04 05:52:34 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @MeidasTouch Whisky Trot Foxtrot...? What will these sheep do if trump dies? I guess they'd still have the first 🐩 poodle to worship....until January 20th. Do they realize trump &amp; co have gotten exactly what they deserve? Adults making very bad choices. Wonder if they'll learn from this
1312509673501716480 2020-10-04 05:47:46 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @Bill_Maxwell_ My buddy asked much the same question. I wouldn't put it past trump's repub lap dogs, barr, Moscow Mitch &amp;the first poodle etc but the staff at Walter Reed are stellar people &amp; l highly doubt they'd play the game.
1312502693328429056 2020-10-04 05:20:01 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @Kalogrym @BetteMidler Tasteless.Trump gives ppl ample material to work with in that front. It's not like he's a pathological liar, egomaniac,shady, rude,  greedy, threatening, cowardly "potus" or anything. I hope he survives but he IS getting what he deserves for being irresponsible incl speculations  https://t.co/cjOhAPJjIb

1312495525912961025 2020-10-04 04:51:33 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump No.Trump and every person in his family, on his staff,in his WH bubble,at the rose garden ceremony, on airforce/marine one made a conscious decision NOT to mask up. It was only a matter of time. They ALL knew the risk but wanted to impress trump by following his lead. Just sad  https://t.co/hrL1aboC1g

Negligent homicide, sexual NDAs, lies, racial taunts, adultery, shady business moves, hate &amp; fear mongering, tax evasion, mail/election fraud &amp; tampering...  But Biden is the threat to Americans right?  https://t.co/C2CCTSfHLp
1312462601654136832 2020-10-04 02:40:43 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @mollysmcdonough @greenfield64 @JoeBiden Thank you, you're absoloutly right. Each candidate is reaping exactly what they've sown since the pandemic started.l don't wish trump &amp; co any ill will but they ALL made BAD decisions &amp; brought their current situations upon themselves. Live &amp; learn? Doubtful🙄
1312461498057256962 2020-10-04 02:36:20 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @mdmccleary86 @greenfield64 I absoloutly agree. Had Biden been infected/ hospitalized, trump would in no way shape or form slow, let alone stop his rallies.i know that this is uncharted territory given covid, but is there any legal protocol saying Biden can't campaign while trump is at Walter Reed?  https://t.co/is5xz51duG
1312460225270542336 2020-10-04 02:31:16 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> May I please have what he's having? What the hell... states send ballots. Americans fill them out. They're sent back to the state. They're counted. It's always worked before why not now?I never like trump's logic but at least l can usually understand it. Not so with this tweet 🤔  https://t.co/gdvD5RM1SU

He's a natural born attention whore and drama queen so taking a limo over taking a chopper? Doubtful
1312264390838804480 2020-10-03 13:33:06 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @kimemdoyle @vespertilioAJR The white house medical suite is state of the art, but for small things- xrays,stitches, fever, sore throat etc. They can triage &amp; stabilize but they can't do anything invasive like respirators, surgeries etc. they aren't a level one trauma center

1311813451346571264 2020-10-02 07:41:13 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Given this comment,I stand by my thoughts that he's done &amp; he wants out. Problem is his pride/ego won't allow him to walk off of the job. He thrives on chaos &amp; a lot of it l think is to self sabotage. Also to see how much of a mess he can leave Biden to clean up.

1311812220402237442 2020-10-02 07:36:20 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> trump cannot deny his allegiances w/ Putin any longer.

1311808571257036802 2020-10-02 07:21:50 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @donwinslow @FoxNews @SpeakerPelosi Wallace did raise his voice to ask trump about quashing civil unrest when he loses. Trump started a tirade asking for a WS group name &amp; Wallace and Biden both said proud boys. trump's answer sparked new bs w/ that group. All he has to do now is say 2 wds to end it. "Stand Down"

1310813057829011457 2020-09-29 13:26:01 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Why not? Ballots go out, people cast a vote, ballots go back, they're counted &amp; added to final votes. WHY is this SO HARD for you to UNDERSTAND?  No coincidence that you're all scurrying to fill RBG's seat - taking the vote to the Supreme Court ?

I don't trust a vaccine that's (according to trump)able to be mass produced so fast w/ very little vetting. He said "whadda you have to lose? Just take it" of hydroxychlorquine. It causes heart attacks among other things. Let the trumps take the 1st vaccine  https://t.co/9hFfXQ0dkJ

1308471693179056128 2020-09-23 02:22:16 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Graham's just as pathetic as trump. He flips from a dire opinion of the chubby cheeto to staunch support of the idiot in chief and back again. It's time to get these clowns OUT of office, the whole lot of them.  https://t.co/bLERu4vpHi
1308433605765533696 2020-09-22 23:50:55 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump He doesn't even deserve to say  RBGs name. He's a slap in the face to Americans. Blindly following trump on the road to hell, his base will cheer for anything. Just sad.  https://t.co/12proAEQ1g
1308427459361222656 2020-09-22 23:26:30 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> He lies so much that not only does trump believe his bullshit but his base does as well.  Amazing to me how supposedly rational people will stand in the middle of the fire that is trumps campaign, choking on fumes, agreeing with him that there's no risk of burning up.  SMH 🙄  https://t.co/wsJVTCE6BT
1308417253457747976 2020-09-22 22:45:57 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> trump is the worst kind of liar ~ desperate, pathetic and believes his own lies. It's amazing how his base will encourage the bs.l mean they cheered like maniacs when he drank a glass of water.🙄 Get out &amp; vote like your lives depend on voting trump out🇺🇲   https://t.co/2R1Mz13Sky
1308416047310082048 2020-09-22 22:41:09 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Graham talks a good(ish) game but can he walk the walk? Watching him for a while now, he says what he thinks people want to hear with little to no follow up. A lot like trump.   https://t.co/0FqDvLx09e
1308260014264594432 2020-09-22 12:21:08 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> When will trumpers learn? They wear masks when being taped behind trump, getting paid to look responsible yet trump tells a reporter to distance from him bc he didn't want to get infected. But "covid affects virtually no one"can't trumpers see he REALLY doesn't give a shite ??

1308227364455940100 2020-09-22 10:11:24 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> Trump deserves anything the law throws at him. Tax evasion&amp; fraud, swindling the tax payers, getting Americans covid sick/killed, sanctioning Russian bounties, sexual assault, theft. There will be no shortage of narcs to lay him out neatly under many, many legal busses....
1308226354761134081 2020-09-22 10:07:23 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @TeamTrump No masks. No distancing. No common sense. Trump, do you ever wonder of the thousand or so deaths a day - how many are from your base rally goers ?)Oh and those who chose NOT to go ~ how many did your fans infect ??

So if I protest unarmed &amp; peacefully &amp; some idiot decides they feel "threatened" (even if they're not) DeSantis would give them cartblanch to kill me with their 1/2 ton truck, no crime/no charges.

It's happened in NYC, Philly, Chicago &amp; Atlanta. When someone is run over just trying to get from A to B or peaceful protesters? This would give trump's base permission to murder. Hope no one YOU knows gets caught up!

1308135829521477632 2020-09-22 04:07:40 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> At his rally, trump told a reporter to keep his distance bc he didn't want to get sick. He didn't tell his zombie base to distance or wear masks. There are military in his crowds~ the LOSERS/SUCKERS who he calls idiots,who he wants to vote for him.

1306270710726299648 2020-09-17 00:36:21 +0800 <DwMoonwolf> @TeamTrump @realDonaldTrump Why would we vote for a homicidal, liar,putin puppet, racist, attention whore, evil,election tampering,xenophobic, drama queen, vile draft dodging COWARD who berates our military dead? He's screwed the pooch and as unhinged as he is trump belongs in a home NOT the White House 🙄  https://t.co/Qw58DuUt92

Coming straight from trump's mouth, they cannot claim 'fake news' &amp; he certainly can't spin it. He's trying-"l didn't want to panic people"            I'm sooo calling bull shite &amp; hope repubs will too.  https://t.co/nLntGSHn8l

Is that legal? And what of Biden, should he be able to get equal tv time like trump uses to campaign? Does anyone know?  https://t.co/Uz7szHSOkj

Doing so shows two things 1) trump doesn't get why ppl are pissed off we all watched as a man was murdered. BLM didn't make Floyd a martyr, he was a victim 2)lt shows his racism. Just another example of hundreds. We're all fair game  https://t.co/CdC7u1RoRp

Birth control? Tubal ligation? All prevent pregnancy. So where do you draw the line? It's OUR choice

Biden believes women NOT the gov't rule their bodies.If a woman is raped or is a victim of incest &amp; gets pg, she should carry the child? BIDEN KNOWS THIS IS THE WOMAN'S CHOICE. If you can't trust a women with a decision how can she be trusted with a baby?
