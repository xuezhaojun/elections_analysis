1322234641118625792 2020-10-31 01:51:19 +0800 <philr755> @JCNEWSOFFICIAL @JackPosobiec President Trump is working his ass off for all Americans!
1322206571661766656 2020-10-30 23:59:46 +0800 <philr755> Bush and Romney were punching bags for the mainstream media. They never fought back. Trump doesn’t take shit from anyone. You call him out, you get it back times 10.  Finally! That’s why we love Trump, he’s a fighter.  He fights for himself and he fights for Americans! Thank You!
1321971003703152640 2020-10-30 08:23:42 +0800 <philr755> @TomLeeto @DailyCaller Kudos to Cuomo as he upholds Italian men dating standards.
1321965526642544640 2020-10-30 08:01:57 +0800 <philr755> @realDonaldTrump @catturd2 Your immigration policies are the reason I was a Trump supporter on day one when you announced you were running.  We need a pause in immigration of all types for few years so American workers can catch up!
1321964004311523334 2020-10-30 07:55:54 +0800 <philr755> @KittyLists @KING5Seattle If you are going to protest, then stand up and own your shit!  You can’t have it both ways.  We need laws against wearing masks while protesting like we have in the south where the anti-masking laws were used to reign in the KKK.

1321951114875576321 2020-10-30 07:04:41 +0800 <philr755> @KFOX14 @JackPosobiec Then why did this not come out during the impeachment hearings?  Fucking FBI.
1321950668844879877 2020-10-30 07:02:54 +0800 <philr755> I want to know on Election Day, not Thanksgiving!
1321917401462616069 2020-10-30 04:50:43 +0800 <philr755> Cuomo has the typical arrogant and abrasive New York City personality, like Trump, which is what I love about him!
1321882108835602432 2020-10-30 02:30:28 +0800 <philr755> How about dropping one in the ocean near Taiwan?  That would send a good message!
1321881252362915841 2020-10-30 02:27:04 +0800 <philr755> @JackPosobiec Incredible!  Throw marshmallows at them!  Philadelphians, rise up and take back your city since your government is abdicating their responsibilities.  Make Philadelphia Safe Again!
1321860007370084352 2020-10-30 01:02:39 +0800 <philr755> @BreitbartNews Thank you President Trump.  H1B labor is a travesty used to push Americans out of their well paid Information Technology jobs and hand them over to outsourced H1B visa replacements.  Think Disney, or the TVA which President Trump stopped as they are a government entity.
1321852411439390721 2020-10-30 00:32:28 +0800 <philr755> GOAT!  Thank you Jack Nicklaus for supporting President Trump.

1321530447986393091 2020-10-29 03:13:06 +0800 <philr755> @ShaynaKing Let’s see you try.  Show me how this is done without getting injured. Obey police commands! Better yet, just be a good citizen and you won’t interact with law enforcement.
1321513813708050433 2020-10-29 02:07:00 +0800 <philr755> @GovernorTomWolf Then listen and obey police commands!  Every one of these events has that singular event as the trigger, failure to obey, forcing the police to respond.  If I were the police, I would just run away, or not respond to the domestic violence calls.  It’s a no win situation.
1321459851466297344 2020-10-28 22:32:34 +0800 <philr755> @dbongino Philadelphians, defend your stores with force since the police abdicated their sworn responsibility. It is now up to regular citizens to protect themselves against civil terrorists. Remember the Koreans during the LA riots of 1992!
1321314849306136578 2020-10-28 12:56:23 +0800 <philr755> @gatewaypundit Support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign AND domestic. Let’s restore peace to our streets by arresting our domestic enemies.

1321300697082744841 2020-10-28 12:00:09 +0800 <philr755> @JackPosobiec Then get your neighbors and get out there and protect it yourselves.  Get your guns, get on rooftops, set up barricades and protect your families.  Your government is abdicating their role!

We swore an oath to defend the country against all enemies, foreign AND domestic.

1310977568103903234 2020-09-30 00:19:43 +0800 <philr755> @LadyLigea @nytimes @morgfair I fully support the first amendment.  I don’t like government employees leaking private and personal data.  The next level to this is an IRS employee will be selling tax data on the dark web.  Plus, this is just part of election year October Surprises.  More to come!
1310976479551946757 2020-09-30 00:15:24 +0800 <philr755> @Gregbsmithnyc Typical Democratic government employee laziness and incompetence.  No pride in workmanship, no quality control, and absolutely no consequences for poor work product.  No one gets fired unless sacrificed at the altar of public opinion.  Let’s do a 10% RIF of all bureaucrats.

1310650637634416640 2020-09-29 02:40:37 +0800 <philr755> @robjh1 Don’t defund the police. If you don’t like them, don’t call them. Black people are calling the police on other black people, so stop it and our law enforcement people won’t be placed into these no win situations. To the police, don’t respond or slow walk the response.

1307394328839544834 2020-09-20 03:01:12 +0800 <philr755> @rezaaslan No problem
1307110386781638656 2020-09-19 08:12:55 +0800 <philr755> @SenSchumer President Trump do not delay!  The 2020 election year October surprise is a third Trump appointed and confirmed Supreme Court Justice!
1307107850091737088 2020-09-19 08:02:51 +0800 <philr755> @SamParkerSenate The real October surprise will be when Trump gets a third justice confirmed!
1307107010522030081 2020-09-19 07:59:30 +0800 <philr755> @ValentineShow I say fill it now while the Republicans hold a majority in the Senate.  No need to wait. Democrats did not agree to the nominations after the last election and the Republicans had to invoke the nuclear option to get Gorsuch and Kavanaugh confirmed.
1307101084775837698 2020-09-19 07:35:58 +0800 <philr755> Supreme Court Justice Ruth Badger Ginsberg just passed.  Our condolences to her family. How quickly can the Trump administration get a new justice appointed and approved by the Senate?
1307076335953641476 2020-09-19 05:57:37 +0800 <philr755> @JohnCooper4Nash You betrayed Nashville citizens for political gain.  I say businesses should open in defiance of any so called government mandate.  #cooperlied #opennashville
1306230949026451458 2020-09-16 21:58:21 +0800 <philr755> Outrageous
1306029389948350464 2020-09-16 08:37:26 +0800 <philr755> @benshapiro Awesome news!  How about a job?
1305894912118992902 2020-09-15 23:43:04 +0800 <philr755> @JackPosobiec Back the Blue, dammit!
1305869189010333698 2020-09-15 22:00:51 +0800 <philr755> Can we start having criminals post cash bail again please?
1305687382289776641 2020-09-15 09:58:25 +0800 <philr755> F***ing Incredible!
1305684506461040640 2020-09-15 09:46:59 +0800 <philr755> @BGOnTheScene Love that name!
1305679873206374401 2020-09-15 09:28:34 +0800 <philr755> All this over a justified police shooting of a man with a knife who was out of jail on a $1 million bond for stabbing four people last year.
1305558203120394240 2020-09-15 01:25:06 +0800 <philr755> Outrageous!
1305548640874835970 2020-09-15 00:47:06 +0800 <philr755> Crazy talk about disarming police from the tools they need for crowd control.  By the way, what happened to water cannons?
1305543678929272833 2020-09-15 00:27:23 +0800 <philr755> @NewsHour Advice to those in South America - DO NOT attempt to illegally emigrate to the United States.  You will be stopped and returned to Mexico.
1305340243793588224 2020-09-14 10:59:00 +0800 <philr755> Arrestees are upset that public records are published?
1304943163749150720 2020-09-13 08:41:09 +0800 <philr755> Go Ohio!
1304815454503010304 2020-09-13 00:13:41 +0800 <philr755> @DoingRight1 @alpipkin My new norm is to always conceal carry whenever and wherever I go out to shop or dine.
1304641492028399616 2020-09-12 12:42:25 +0800 <philr755> WTF?
1304498807573446659 2020-09-12 03:15:26 +0800 <philr755> I am angry over the loss of American lives in this tragedy.  Seeing movies or photos of old New York City with the twin towers always acts as a trigger.

1304253918382305280 2020-09-11 11:02:20 +0800 <philr755> Let the police do their job Ted, without interference from know nothing politicians.
1303718671488110603 2020-09-09 23:35:27 +0800 <philr755> @TheAnaBraga @Jamierodr14 @realDonaldTrump I am all for letting the cops handle it, but when they don’t show up, now what?
1303509310257934336 2020-09-09 09:43:32 +0800 <philr755> Clueless
1303506962471100418 2020-09-09 09:34:12 +0800 <philr755> @TCCrimeWatch How brazen are you when you steal from the impound lot?

1303396834241581056 2020-09-09 02:16:35 +0800 <philr755> Sarah Huckabee for Governor of Arkansas!
1303396529831641089 2020-09-09 02:15:23 +0800 <philr755> Incredible!  MIT posits that Conservative news outlets sharing the videos BLM and Antifa violence is causing the violence...
1303124571839660032 2020-09-08 08:14:43 +0800 <philr755> @no_silenced My kindergarten teacher voting at school in 1960 while we we waited in line, and telling us afterwards she voted for Kennedy.
1303115208806797312 2020-09-08 07:37:31 +0800 <philr755> @BGOnTheScene Awesome real time reporting!  I have been following your nightly near real time reporting of riots and they are spot on.  You show the news before it is on MSM, if ever.

1302321180821643267 2020-09-06 03:02:20 +0800 <philr755> @HerWildMajesty @JackPosobiec Data are racist

1300998385164484609 2020-09-02 11:26:01 +0800 <philr755> Stay strong Kyle
1300903735930089473 2020-09-02 05:09:54 +0800 <philr755> Stop this madness of outsourcing America's best IT jobs.  We have the talent, just not at H1B wages.
1300799907918499841 2020-09-01 22:17:20 +0800 <philr755> The media for Joe:  “We hear what you are saying but we don’t believe you!”  A political ad showing Biden saying he will raise taxes is deemed “mostly false” by fact checkers.
