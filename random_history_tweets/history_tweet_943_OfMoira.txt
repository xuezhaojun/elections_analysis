I rode the cable car to work + coming up with fare was a struggle. One day after I'd payed my fare the guy next to me only had a $10 bill. The driver didn't have change, so the guy rode free.

1342179151516631040 2020-12-25 02:43:40 +0800 <OfMoira> @CalfDevin Dental school. Go to a dental school. My dentist assured me that excellent practitioners run them and that the care is top notch. Sorry you're suffering. Tooth pain is the worst.

1342177387643953152 2020-12-25 02:36:40 +0800 <OfMoira> @rtyson82 It's turned me into a deeply cynical, cold hearted, razor tongued critic of people I had a lot of respect for right up until about 2000. Now, here's how I think about the democrat party:  https://t.co/jH3pF4Nbdg
1342176063632285696 2020-12-25 02:31:24 +0800 <OfMoira> @Mo_TheWriter It's a very myopic view of life in the world, and it leads to flawed decision making.

It would give us freedom and power. And we would not be such desperate, eager little employees who fit nicely into the Chamber of Commerce's comfort zone.

It was a smashing work EXCEPT that Obama's head was too big and i could not figure out how to get it in proportion. I painted it over. Obama's an uncooperative portrait subject!

Back rent owed since the spring or summer. A way-overdue water or electric bill. The cost of a guillotine.

1341094275094745088 2020-12-22 02:52:46 +0800 <OfMoira> @davidmweissman Why would anyone blame her, David? She went all out saying what a significant amount of lettuce $600 is for grubby little American families. Who could take issue with that?
1341090981001641987 2020-12-22 02:39:40 +0800 <OfMoira> @TamanishaJohn @CoriBush Right. She's cozy with Clyburn last week and she's going to take outrage to congress next month? I won't be holding my breath for it.
1341090005951770624 2020-12-22 02:35:48 +0800 <OfMoira> @CoriBush @PensiveTM I'll believe it when I see it. Congress is a wholly failed institution for the people of America. Congress makes a war of neglect on the people. No way you're going to change any of it.

They won't part with a penny to wear clean, crisp clothes, to buy themselves a decent haircut or a bottle of shampoo. Some of the lowest consciousness I've ever seen belongs to landlords.

Because of his alcoholism there was a vacuum where a father ought to have been. Sad, right? But Jungian analysis and truth seeking have brought me to peace on all of it.

1340366918226567169 2020-12-20 02:42:30 +0800 <OfMoira> @Soulhorses I was going to say that her conformation is kind of amazing. She has Arabian hind quarters, but the head of a Mustang or Qhorse. I think she's kind of beautiful.

One of the most exciting moments of my childhood was receiving the sugar cube to eat that contained the polio vaccine. The 2nd coolest moment was night swimming in a motel pool in LA after driving all day to get there.

AOC talked openly about the process early on, then Nancy took her to lunch and brought her into the club.

One must do what is right, but cultivate detachment from outrage. One must disengage so that one can maintain an inner core of truthfulness and adherence to eternal principles: compassion, service, bliss. 2/2

1337360245035655168 2020-12-11 19:35:04 +0800 <OfMoira> @nodank_ The only path forward lies with citizens making guerilla war on transnational corporate conglomerates. They are the force buying congress out from under us and setting this psychopathic, loveless policy agenda that's killing us and the biosphere.

One of our good friends had everybody in his family (+/- 25 people) over for Thanksgiving at his house in Berkeley. Many drove or flew in from far flung parts of the state. Only 1 wore a mask.

Trillions are given to these industries in a snap. Evo Morales said upon his return to Bolivia from exile this Nov, of American elections "Transnational corporations run America.

But I believe covid will be around for a while and I do not want to get it. My husband is asthmatic, so we cannot afford exposure.

General strike, mass phone, email, letter writing campaigns, actions where nobody gets arrested, but we harass and shame them and destroy their markets. I have a lot of ideas. Us &gt; them

Then organically a tipping point will come. We all need to be teachers right now, waking up our neighbors. Then we go after the corporations. We back them off, everything changes.

1336347332057518081 2020-12-09 00:30:06 +0800 <OfMoira> @Jaybefaunt Yes! We need to get citizens reminded and informed as to who their real enemies are, and they are the transnational corporations that run America. We must hit them directly and forget about politicians. A general strike is the eventual stake through the heart of their control.

1335981801588760582 2020-12-08 00:17:37 +0800 <OfMoira> @ComptonMadeMe The correct answer is D. Life in America is a ceaseless grind because the Collective Corporate Mind wants it that way. Government serves them FIRST, then serves themselves, and if there is a crumb left, and they can get around to it, the people might get the crumb.
1335977983912210432 2020-12-08 00:02:27 +0800 <OfMoira> @JeremyWard33 That's my observation. Our revolutionary target is corporate comfort, not our silly "representatives" in DC. If we can pucker their assholes we might get somewhere.

1335672096291098624 2020-12-07 03:46:58 +0800 <OfMoira> I have just watched the best production of A Christmas Carol I have ever seen. It's a dark, very frank, modernized &amp; slightly expanded retelling such as Dickens would've dared not written. A black Mary Cratchet plays a central role!

1335482976482729985 2020-12-06 15:15:28 +0800 <OfMoira> @Chacelounge Sometimes I do think about this, how horrible it must have been, and I feel deeply sick.
1335481387470602244 2020-12-06 15:09:09 +0800 <OfMoira> @marwilliamson I saw that Donald. He wasn't a nice guy, but neither was he a raving lunatic.

1335478213141643264 2020-12-06 14:56:32 +0800 <OfMoira> @TimNissen1 @MadMax1105 I compile mine in a a big can on my back porch potting bench to dry and when they pile up I smash them with the bottom of a bottle. They don't get as fine as yours though!
1335477110232608771 2020-12-06 14:52:09 +0800 <OfMoira> @mr_clark14 @tekstone What it is, mostly. The idea that people inside the agencies are up to something nefarious, and secretly run things. And, that this "deep state" is the actual enemy of the American people. Government does shitty things because corporate bosses control policy &amp; legislation.
1335400420160667650 2020-12-06 09:47:25 +0800 <OfMoira> @pauljimerson That's from today, right?

1335316031842131968 2020-12-06 04:12:05 +0800 <OfMoira> @tekstone @mr_clark14 But "deep state" is such demagoguery. Who exactly is that? People inside the constitutionally sanctioned agencies inside the Executive Branch? It sounds like some secret organization behind the government that does the work of the people. I don't buy into the concept.
1335298276317229056 2020-12-06 03:01:32 +0800 <OfMoira> @PatTheBerner But they won't listen to us because they don't work for us. Their loyalty is to corporate bosses. It's the corporate bosses the people need to scare. They drive everything. Trying to get Congress's attention is just so much swatting at flies. We have to clean up the shit.

1335294808588386304 2020-12-06 02:47:45 +0800 <OfMoira> @mr_clark14 Barack Obama and the democrat party are the deep state, then.
1335293390779371525 2020-12-06 02:42:07 +0800 <OfMoira> @pauljimerson It suggests what the rise of oceans will look like from a drone's eye view.

He captures the ocean having these inspired, sacred moments where something secret and very important is going on. It's marvelous.

1334958076969930753 2020-12-05 04:29:42 +0800 <OfMoira> @dbessner I'm a painter. When I paint portraits I meet the soul of the subject. I painted a ripping portrait of Michelle &amp; Barack on their inauguration walk, except he proved impossible. His head was HUGE. I could not pare it down or get it right so I painted over the canvas &amp; reused it.

It's hilarious.  46 minutes of voter fraud details county by county, through AZ, GA, PA, MI, WI AND MN. Full details yelled about with twitchy body language and regular cutaways to camera 2, where he shows charts. WGAF?
1334699158259650561 2020-12-04 11:20:51 +0800 <OfMoira> Watching the 46 minute rant of butthurt-ness by the man boy. It is Extreme Pro Bellyaching nonstop which actually crescendos as it goes! Two thoughts. 1. The movie Casino. Ace Rothstein thrown out of licensure by the county, goes on late night TV and tells off the county commish.
1334646828424339457 2020-12-04 07:52:55 +0800 <OfMoira> @PatTheBerner BTW, here are my top 3 faves, but I'm hard core:  1. Thai bud 2. Sensi Star 3. Acapulco Gold
1334646152373751809 2020-12-04 07:50:13 +0800 <OfMoira> @PatTheBerner Indica is what you should try. Sativa delivers the paranoia experience, and half indica/half sativa blends can do the same. Indica induces sleepiness and enhances appetite &amp; giggling.  Be very careful with edibles bc it's easy to overdose and have a very unpleasant experience.

1333761575820218372 2020-12-01 21:15:14 +0800 <OfMoira> @StevenDBT George is the poster boy for what happens to B actors when they become clients of the LA talent agency, CAA. They all sound like George &amp; Rob Reiner &amp; every talking head on msdnc and Michelle Obama, all CAA clients. It's the Politainment Industrial Complex for propaganda.

1331657621036646402 2020-11-26 01:54:52 +0800 <OfMoira> @RichL315 My 1991 Ford Festiva. I loved that little car. All it required was a tuneup every two years, oil changes and gas and it was always ready to go. And it was ZIPPY with a turning radius of zilch. In 2014 CA gave me $1000 for it. I cried when I left it at the wrecking yard.

Crosby was the largest law firm in the East Bay at the time. I was the librarian there who gave her library orientation and helped her with research.

1329532159422414848 2020-11-20 05:09:02 +0800 <OfMoira> @RexChapman Self defeating vanity.  This is hair powder used to cover stubborn gray at the temples (this hair resists tint) and to make the hair appear uniformly dense. It's cheap-o stuff, because the good ones don't run when wetted with sweat or simple water. Utterly shameful.

1327991140918853633 2020-11-15 23:05:35 +0800 <OfMoira> @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden I do not believe that for a minute. Both of you serve corporate bosses via Obama, just be honest.

I drove my family's '68 Ford pickup, my Volkswagen Beetle, a Mercury with a column shift, and finally my beloved '91 Ford Festiva which I sadly parted with in 2014 bc the state of California gave me $1,000 for it. I cried when they took the Festiva.

1327678582479413248 2020-11-15 02:23:35 +0800 <OfMoira> @Tazerface16 Because boomers were raised by the much touted "Greatest Generation" who, by the time they got around to being parents, were super traumatized by growing up in the depression and then having to fight a world war. They were not nice parents. No whining allowed. At all.

1326631830368313344 2020-11-12 05:04:10 +0800 <OfMoira> @TheMarieFonseca Corporate people are pussies and they back down when the heat gets too high, when embarrassing facts are revealed, when the share price is threatened. I see this as our path to "taking our country back" and having nice things for ourselves, our children and all sentient beings.
1326630927447990272 2020-11-12 05:00:35 +0800 <OfMoira> @TheMarieFonseca when the real problem are the big dog poops all over the back yard. The poops are the transnational corporations providing a hog trough of corrupting cash to our "representatives". We as a people need to target those corporations and put the fear into them. #Occupy did it in 2010
1326629450042155008 2020-11-12 04:54:43 +0800 <OfMoira> @TheMarieFonseca Evo's statement has given me an inspiration for future action. Re our election results, Evo said Transnational corporations run America. The people vote, but they do not rule.

"Leaders" are leaders when they overcome the barriers and vicissitudes that space-time has for all of us. Has Howie reached out or is he sitting around? I haven't heard from him.
1326622628509962240 2020-11-12 04:27:36 +0800 <OfMoira> More: as of April 2019 the Unitarian Universalist Church took a stand against @HP's bloody profiteering off of human misery.

There is no sanctuary for us in either hive. So we're political vagabonds, homeless as it were, doing good where we can in a world gone mad.

1326556382598897665 2020-11-12 00:04:22 +0800 <OfMoira> @NathanJRobinson Because transnational corporations rule America.
1326556002209001472 2020-11-12 00:02:51 +0800 <OfMoira> @SAVoltolin The first woman president will be every bit as disappointing as the first black president. Because as Evo Morales reminded the world, transnational corporations rule America. (The people vote, but they do not rule, he said)
1326554635327295488 2020-11-11 23:57:25 +0800 <OfMoira> @ghostofjohnbro Another dried up democrat party cat turd. He's just the friendlier-looking version of Perdue.

1326394228759523329 2020-11-11 13:20:02 +0800 <OfMoira> @Bill_Cimbrelo Bill, sweetheart, we've been on the Constitutional Crisis Ride for nearly 4 years now. You gotta be cool, boy, like the Jets. And anyway, Biden and his republican pals have no feather beds for the American people; everyone should soldier on in crisis mode and stay strong.

1326390550778490886 2020-11-11 13:05:25 +0800 <OfMoira> @SocialistMMA I think they're walking a tightrope in DC. They want their districts served, and for that they need the cooperation of other dems, a group real defensive about their foibles. AOC has recently spoken out about the impossible situation in DC.
1326389364683919368 2020-11-11 13:00:42 +0800 <OfMoira> @LovesTheWords We live in an age of madness. Truth is reviled and sullied by ceaseless lying. My 2 cents: stay with the plumb line of truth inside you.

1326385194832695297 2020-11-11 12:44:08 +0800 <OfMoira> @beaukpad @StrangeTimes10 They hire election law lawyers to negotiate and/or sue for the numbers. If they don't muster something like that they're just so much hot air, at best a think tank.  You know who're getting results are DSA and Our Revolution. Both active everywhere getting progressives elected.

Evo Morales of Bolivia said shortly after his return this week, "Multinational corporations run America. The people vote, but they do not rule." I can't stop thinking about that.

1326027169156403200 2020-11-10 13:01:28 +0800 <OfMoira> @joesegal $30K is starvation wage in most places in the US. And if you live somewhere affordable on that much money, you'll never find a job locally that pays you that much. American Catch-22. I remember trying to live on 30K back when I was a law librarian. Your description is 100% right.

They allowed us to be attacked at home, started massive wars then close by completely trashing the GLOBAL economy. Cheney knew exactly how to use government to create chaos and huge private profit for friends. Not to mention the preexistings.

1322232509338320901 2020-10-31 01:42:50 +0800 <OfMoira> @peterdaou Look to organizational psych. The personality of the individual at the top of the organization becomes the mood/style of the whole organization.
1322231666958454791 2020-10-31 01:39:29 +0800 <OfMoira> @a9ymous Well said.
1322229667781173248 2020-10-31 01:31:33 +0800 <OfMoira> @CGoustin @melodijoy They've internalized capitalism. When you feel guilty for taking time off, for sleeping in, for mental health days. When "free stuff" for the rich seems right but $20 to a beggar is an outrage. When work is always priority #1, that's internalization of capitalism.

I am a student/follower of @Amritanandamayi, who is the most positive, loving person on the planet, who encourages a positive, loving attitude in every situation. But American politics and politicians? I've seen too much.
1322167969661644800 2020-10-30 21:26:23 +0800 <OfMoira> @glowingcanary I know. She'll get over it.

1322151473552093185 2020-10-30 20:20:50 +0800 <OfMoira> @djhutch74 It is extremely irksome. Democrats' "democracy" is a lie.

I think it's elephant seals that spend considerable time at 7,000 feet! They go the deepest. I would love to find that one again. Also, National Geographic's Eternal Enemies, Lions vs. Hyenas!

1321976393069068290 2020-10-30 08:45:07 +0800 <OfMoira> @djhutch74 Government, namely the Executive Branch, will be reconstructed, life breathed back in, daca people will be safe. Environmental damage [mostly] halted/reversed. Maybe out of shame they'll release/reunite the central Americans in bondage at the border. I don't expect much tho.

1321494282327392256 2020-10-29 00:49:23 +0800 <OfMoira> @lowetze1 Because democrats are afraid to upset anybody. EXCEPT FOR PROGRESSIVES! They'll run progressives over with the car whenever given half a chance.

1321468419103838208 2020-10-28 23:06:37 +0800 <OfMoira> @DystopianR Of course.

She didn't even make it to the California primary her campaign was so lame, she won ZERO DELEGATES. She has signaled to Obama she'll do whatever he tells her to in his 3rd shadow term.

Why is she always giggling like she's got a pitcher of margaritas in her? Did you see her campaign? She had a whole new set of policy positions every other week. Did you seeher in the Hamptons 5 minutes after Hillary lost to trump?

1315195564942794758 2020-10-11 15:40:32 +0800 <OfMoira> You must watch this. I had absolutely no hope re climate change, and then I watched Kiss the Ground. Now I have a sliver. All that's needed is for Dow and Monsanto to find new business models (yuk yuk).

1314984498904219648 2020-10-11 01:41:50 +0800 <OfMoira> @Eldon_Katz I have had a revelation of sorts about this. Becoming emotionally charged up every single day about politics and the agonies + injustices of the world is not ok. My agita doesn't change any of it. Inner calm is the goal no matter what some fat fuck tweets.

I think he understood and never did that again. He hung around for a good month after he passed. He's gone home now though.

It's about elevating the white trash class to a powerful position by identifying with the bosses' whiteness while intimidating the dark people.

There is no sociological excuse for what those goobers were up to. They found thrilling power in playing army. They feel powerful covered in guns. They became criminals.

And they initiated England, Ireland &amp; Wales into their savagery, where all of my other ancestors came from. The savagery is all ours.

1314598329628598272 2020-10-10 00:07:20 +0800 <OfMoira> And so summary execution by state agents in the dark of night is fully justified, ha? Because of a photo nobody'd ever seen? No justice in America.

It's like being English, strict class stratification, and, practicing law is actually really tedious. AND, after riding out the Loma Prieta quake on the 24th floor of a high rise I decided to leave that world. After 18 yrs I'd had enough.

We take all of that energy and put it toward caring for the earth, ocean cleanup especially. Battle ships into plastic traulers. Bombs into tree seedlings planted.

I'm a lucky retiree who can sequester, but others are not so lucky. There too is the tragedy. The nation is wealthy enough to shelter us all, but tptb won't have it. Tragedy again.
1314055549986635776 2020-10-08 12:10:31 +0800 <OfMoira> @dailyrev Right? The romping had been going on for quite a while, running as fast as we could through the long marble halls of the place, laughing like children. An animus. An equal.   A deep little white ceramic bowl with, like, corn pops in milk, plenty of milk.  Why trump?
1313872519191957504 2020-10-08 00:03:13 +0800 <OfMoira> @angel_felixv @PaulSorrentino3 Covid has come to relieve mother earth of humans who insist on living unexamined lives. Some innocents have gotten swept away, but all  goofs like those are doomed.

1313868946425016320 2020-10-07 23:49:01 +0800 <OfMoira> @PaulSorrentino3 I'll say it again: covid is an intelligence test.
1313868532476604416 2020-10-07 23:47:23 +0800 <OfMoira> Incidentally, he was dressed in his golfing clothis, the white izod shirt and light slacks as big as a tent.
1313867856858161152 2020-10-07 23:44:42 +0800 <OfMoira> I think, "Hey wait, he's got the covid!!" and I run out of the room as fast as I can. Don't know what happened to the cereal. End of dream.
1313866728066019328 2020-10-07 23:40:13 +0800 <OfMoira> This morning's dream: In a structure full of large, high ceilinged rooms made wholly of sandy colored marble I'd been romping with a male friend, but now I'm alone enjoying a bowl of cereal. In walzes Trump. He sits opposite me and starts talking, bla bla. No mask.
1313822538321911814 2020-10-07 20:44:37 +0800 <OfMoira> @AngrierWHStaff He's all hopped up!

1312030292463427584 2020-10-02 22:02:52 +0800 <OfMoira> @lisaquinninc @rebeinstein @MSNBC I guess. She recently also became a client of ACC, the talent agency in LA controlled by DNC think-makers. Most TV talking heads are clients. Toeing the corporate line is part of the bargain.
1312025020441350147 2020-10-02 21:41:55 +0800 <OfMoira> @CapaTosta122 He's a crook, clearly.

It has stayed nice, but shifting winds will bring us smoke on and off until the fires are out, which could be a couple of months. This is the new normal for climate-changed California. I've lived here for 65 years. This burns down every summer thing is newish.

The Kochs had people organize them, they paid for busses to get them collected and delivered to demonstrations, and the major party gave zero resistance.

Sweetie, that's the "democratic process" the dems love: they only count the votes of

Nobody's vote counted--literally: they did not count the votes. They gave delegates to Biden that were Bernie's. And in the end they chucked all votes and installed Joe and Kammie.

1303053742237835264 2020-09-08 03:33:16 +0800 <OfMoira> @joesegal In my grandparents' last years there were many nights when, after having dinner at their apartment, I would cry all the way home. One night, watching my grandfather wave goodbye to me in my rear view out on that dark sidewalk I had to pull over and sob for about 5 minutes. 😥

1303002716109561858 2020-09-08 00:10:30 +0800 <OfMoira> @joesegal Gosh that's tough. My grandmother had dementia and it was the most painful thing in my life, watching her decline. I feel for you.

1302795430753742848 2020-09-07 10:26:50 +0800 <OfMoira> @MuttBus I'd probably just snip it off. I don't feel like the lower buds are as desirable as the crown. I pruned off a lot of the lower growth branches real early on. It seems to have invigorated the tops.

1302683740158660608 2020-09-07 03:03:01 +0800 <OfMoira> The good times our oil economy created are at an end. But big oil and alotta others aren't having it. Those far off target dates for compliance this and that are just so much 50-60% masked on the boardwalk and only 9,000 (ONLY 9,000!!!) on the beach on Labor Day Weekend.   Doomed
1302681880647483392 2020-09-07 02:55:37 +0800 <OfMoira> In the 1950s big oil knew what they were doing to the atmosphere, retailing all of this gooey liquid carbon for the burning. Their industry is run by scientists and engineers, men of science. They knew the absolute certainty of the outcome of what they were doing: making it hot.

A huge tin of honey was open and George flew right into it! He was going down fast when I grabbed him just before his head went in. George was ok, and you make a good point.

1301209794423001091 2020-09-03 01:26:04 +0800 <OfMoira> @ClaireBerlinski "The way blacks behave..." Do you hear yourself?

1301208870082224134 2020-09-03 01:22:24 +0800 <OfMoira> @nashville_brook They're fishing for Republican defectors. That's the whole strategy.

1301204970998358017 2020-09-03 01:06:54 +0800 <OfMoira> @JenniferBart Why is your heart akin to a single pea gravel? Why be so small and mean?
1301204424254205953 2020-09-03 01:04:44 +0800 <OfMoira> @rtyson82 Summary execution for a "bike violation". The US is a shithole country run by psychopath cops. God help us.

1301181206810095617 2020-09-02 23:32:29 +0800 <OfMoira> I cut this zucchini two days ago. It has been hanging out on the kitchen counter with a closed blossom attached to its stem. This morning the blossom opened! Nature amazes me every.  https://t.co/JqMLuQRNDg

1301169209301323778 2020-09-02 22:44:48 +0800 <OfMoira> @kaitlin_sb @chrsdcook Levi's dad is a quitter and, so it appears, a sheep dog for Obama and the other powers that be. His indignance is telling. He sounds like all the other neocons.
1301168413344112640 2020-09-02 22:41:38 +0800 <OfMoira> @kaitlin_sb @chrsdcook Wow. Damn.
