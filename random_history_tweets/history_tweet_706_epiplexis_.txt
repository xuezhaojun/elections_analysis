1339178703008444418 2020-12-16 20:00:58 +0800 <epiplexis_> The only difference between being a so-called "crank" and a 'respected commentator' is whether or not you have friends or friends of friends who know Rupert Murdoch.

1338934129841172480 2020-12-16 03:49:07 +0800 <epiplexis_> @TKispeter Various laws culminating in the 2014 Immigration Act allow a Home Secretary to remove citizenship from anyone deemed to have 'foreign' heritage.  This basically makes loads of people second class citizens - our rights can be dissolved for political reasons.  No one even cares.

1338807552553807874 2020-12-15 19:26:09 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SolHughesWriter Labour should expel the religious sect opposed to my religious sect, because I'm part of the more powerful religious sect and happen to align myself with the political interests of powerful members of the majority outgroup.
1338805430525444097 2020-12-15 19:17:43 +0800 <epiplexis_> @dsquareddigest But a "bus service" (admittedly taken here to mean more than a literal bus service) ought to be bringing people in as well as taking them out.

1338539474465288197 2020-12-15 01:40:54 +0800 <epiplexis_> Bergman's book reminded me of Trofimov's book The Siege of Mecca. The sympathies of the authors are clear, but they tell a very clear story without the usual propaganda and spin.  The fact Rise and Kill First appears to have been ignored by many "pundits" tells its own tale.

The reason you need to make sure their vote is decimated is so the fuckers not only learn a lesson, but also it's the only way to deselect all of them.

Or shared a 'platform' with a politician who said 'they should all speak English' when confronted with a racist ranting about immigrants.
1334877298743517184 2020-12-04 23:08:43 +0800 <epiplexis_> @AdamPorte @RivkahBrown I agree, think about all the people who shared a 'platform' with a politician who said:  "When I arrived in 1994, it was a predominantly white, working class area. Now go through the middle of Barking and you could be in Camden or Brixton..."   but then refused to challenge them.
1334876551868002304 2020-12-04 23:05:45 +0800 <epiplexis_> @jjsmclaughlin This is why we should make sure no one votes Labour until it is eliminated from the electoral map.

1333111121943928835 2020-11-30 02:10:34 +0800 <epiplexis_> This is precisely the reason why I remain sceptical of attempts to reform international institutions to be more democratic and equitable.  Unless the US is made a pariah by the international community, reform isn't possible.
1333110485101797376 2020-11-30 02:08:02 +0800 <epiplexis_> These aren't my rules, btw.  I'm only applying the rules set by the Labour right and their media friends over the last few years.  Let's see if these are actually rules or just tools used for factional control.
1333109115636375552 2020-11-30 02:02:35 +0800 <epiplexis_> Absolutely disgusting. @Keir_Starmer attends this event by an organisation that 'platforms' with Israeli apologists for war crimes and pro-Israeli fanatics who defend ethnic cleansing of Palestinians on the UN International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.

But, for some reason, they never argue for those infinite things to happen.

Only America can do this now, whatever, e.g., China threatens against this or that country.

He just thinks it was good, whereas the "anti-racist" crowd pretend it never occurred and if you bring up the historical archives, they'll just accuse you of racism.

1330375390058176512 2020-11-22 12:59:44 +0800 <epiplexis_> But because their own peoples' needs came before the interests of American or British imperialism, they had to be destroyed, no matter the cost.
1330375387055075328 2020-11-22 12:59:44 +0800 <epiplexis_> Sure, they were sympathetic to leftist politics, some even made alliances with communist parties in their countries. But this put them at odds with many internal forces in their own countries, e.g. Mossadegh vs the Iranian clerisy.
1330375382609121281 2020-11-22 12:59:43 +0800 <epiplexis_> The thing about a lot of these post-war leaders in the "third world" (e.g. Sukarno, Mossadegh, Arbenz) is they weren't even communists. They were 'left-leaning' nationalists or liberals who wanted for their own people what they saw "the west" had.

1330211319216267264 2020-11-22 02:07:47 +0800 <epiplexis_> This requires a genuine commitment to an industrial strategy of some kind, over two or three parliaments, that hasn't existed in Britain for decades. The Tories aren't going to do anything beyond building a couple of wind turbines and maybe some nonsense about R&amp;D. Please stop.

1330209900098686976 2020-11-22 02:02:08 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Archimbaldo On a related note, I've often wondered whether the left's failure to lay out a political 'theory' has contributed to this. Seems like the left has taken republican political theory and liberal democracy for what it is and tried to make gains within it. But does this have limits?
1330209014794379264 2020-11-22 01:58:37 +0800 <epiplexis_> @jakeedmund @Archimbaldo "liberal democracy, long dead, finally buried"  Great piece, btw. Articulated what I've been thinking for a long time.

1329082690713260032 2020-11-18 23:23:01 +0800 <epiplexis_> @lmartods @owenhatherley It's obvious that what we (or at least I) thought was the centre left died a long time ago in both Labour and the Lib Dems, and what remains is an unpopular husk that's seen as elitist and arrogant (see EU ref).

1328867488046657539 2020-11-18 09:07:52 +0800 <epiplexis_> This is the best way to destroy Labour and I'm all for it if there is any basis for this. Their new donors can provide funding for years and years of court cases defending its MPs and members who have called for things like 'whites-first' housing policies.
1328866792450744322 2020-11-18 09:05:07 +0800 <epiplexis_> Genuine question: are there grounds for taking Labour to court for ignoring the decades of Good Racism its MPs and members have churned out?  I'd certainly contribute to any crowdfunding.

1328826865700712452 2020-11-18 06:26:27 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Tom_Gann Let's make it more clear: no unity with the white nationalists, warmongers, torturers, imperialists and ethnonationalists now running the Labour Party.
1328723668290166784 2020-11-17 23:36:23 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Jcmurdoch26 I think even Reason kind of gave up the simplified, mechanistic version of his own model at some point.

1327779681219833856 2020-11-15 09:05:19 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @inthesedeserts Sometimes I wonder whether I should just advise a young Asian or Black person to lean into wealth extraction from this shoddy island, fleece the bootlicking fuckers for all they've got, and then just leave before the decade is out.
1327777746848804865 2020-11-15 08:57:38 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Archimbaldo But unless we think NAM was a secret Soviet plot, this only shows where the "third world" believed its best chance at developing their own economies lay.
1327776999088254977 2020-11-15 08:54:40 +0800 <epiplexis_> The US and UK didn't allow millions of people in the "third world" to have this view on looking after their own, and kept doing coups and wars to ensure access to their wealth.
1327776489539072000 2020-11-15 08:52:38 +0800 <epiplexis_> Judging by people who seem to accuse you of being a cultist for not wanting World War III, while curiously having views that align with John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, we will not be lucky enough to get a NAM in the forthcoming Cold War.
1327766563928289281 2020-11-15 08:13:12 +0800 <epiplexis_> The only 'correct' geopolitical position was non-alignment and it's unsurprising which 'side' in the last Cold War systematically destroyed it.
1327758677697236992 2020-11-15 07:41:51 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SafiyaOutlines @Archimbaldo I can also throw insults around - believe me, I'm quite good at those - but before I do maybe you should ask yourself why you felt the need to call Diane Abbott a "cultist" when she, e.g., voted with the Tories over Libya.
1327742238655455234 2020-11-15 06:36:32 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @Archimbaldo @Charburchar What always strikes me is how the old imperial powers - UK, France, Netherlands - immediately backed each other up in SE Asia (Malaya, Vietnam, Indonesia).
1327741941342212096 2020-11-15 06:35:21 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @Archimbaldo @Charburchar China has been occupied by Britain and the US in the last 120 years.

What I'm suggesting to the likes of your respondent is *he* has a blind spot or worse, he will end up engaging in the same justification for violence he is accusing China apologists of.
1327741129954103296 2020-11-15 06:32:08 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @Archimbaldo I'll have to double-check, but wasn't it Ernest Bevin who explicitly wanted Britain to continue extracting resources from its African colonies and even suggested a joint Anglo-French initiative to ensure Europe maintained its imperial wealth.
1327739450668015616 2020-11-15 06:25:27 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Archimbaldo Almost all of the Labour Party - including the "Corbynite" wing - venerates the post-war Labour government that was knee-deep in pro-colonial violence in Asia right after WWII.
1327739084878516225 2020-11-15 06:24:00 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Charburchar @Archimbaldo What about people who consider Alastair Campbell or Tony Blair or Nuke Bakehurst "allies".  What about people who venerate the man that led post-WWII colonial violence against liberation movements in Asia.

I'm suggesting that "diversity" as a liberal claim was eroded by MAGA if you go by the most recent election and by my (admittedly superficial) look at online MAGA.  "We have ethnically diverse supporters" can be met with "and so do we".

1327618503185149953 2020-11-14 22:24:51 +0800 <epiplexis_> If you see the phrase "Labour moderate" and replace "moderate" with "racist warmongering bastard" the original phrase will make much more sense.

Blair's rhetoric as he left was to attack Black people and Muslims. Brown ended up by repeating BNP slogans about British jobs for British workers.

1326508972086472704 2020-11-11 20:55:58 +0800 <epiplexis_> @CallumGR1874 @zoemayenglish You believe we need a Labour govt because its policies are watered down versions of bad things done by the Tories, and in exchange we may get some watered down versions of good things.  This requires you to accept some people need to be harmed or sacrificed in some way.

If you say Labour would water something down, e.g. let's say welfare support, that watering down entails something - or someone - being sacrificed.  NewLab decided asylum seekers were the easy target

We should stop appealing to their 'fairness' or 'decency', because they have none.  They correctly believe the point is to win and defeat your opponents.

In the case of the 'Muslim community', the broad politics of the 'community' don't conform to the more dominant outgroup so they're ignored. Prevent in this case is used to control those elements that challenge the outgroup on things like war.
1323369365086109696 2020-11-03 05:00:18 +0800 <epiplexis_> I'm old enough to remember when a "community leader" was someone who was to be mocked and ignored.  In fact, didn't the BBC create an entire sitcom around this idea.

1322941785988042759 2020-11-02 00:41:15 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff So, you have criteria that lets you evaluate the "lesser evil".  That's what I was asking.  What is this criteria?

1322938003841523712 2020-11-02 00:26:13 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff The Tories absolutely would go to war. They'd absolutely be racist.  The argument you are making is these can be balanced out under Labour because they introduced Sure Start centres.  i.e. there's criteria we can evaluate to help us make a choice about supporting Blair, Starmer.
1322937011842568193 2020-11-02 00:22:17 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff Let me make this simpler for you:  Tories = Racism + War - Sure Start  Labour = Racism + War + Sure Start  This is what you should be bold enough to own, just like Chomsky (funny how people don't read Chomsky's lesser evil argument to its end).

1322921873135554566 2020-11-01 23:22:07 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff Simon, was all the death and racism from New Labour a price worth paying for Sure Start centres and reducing child poverty for a few years?

1322920274828865537 2020-11-01 23:15:46 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff So, criminalising asylum seekers, migrants, Muslims and Black people, plus all the death abroad, *was* a price worth paying for New Labour reducing child poverty and opening Sure Start centres.

1322911916789026817 2020-11-01 22:42:34 +0800 <epiplexis_> @sjwrenlewis @Mc_Heckin_Duff Ok, what's the criteria, Simon.

1322741067570053121 2020-11-01 11:23:40 +0800 <epiplexis_> A scene near the end of Once Upon A Time In China sums up "international law" doesn't it? "Mr Jackson" is American in the movie.  https://t.co/O81GLH397P

1322552703352999936 2020-10-31 22:55:10 +0800 <epiplexis_> Israeli nationalists, British and American imperialists, even Christian Zionists, are honest about this reality and what they want from an Israeli state.  It's Liberal Zionists who are confused, trying to blend "human rights" with what is outright ethnic cleansing.
1322551599638712320 2020-10-31 22:50:47 +0800 <epiplexis_> My most Stalinist opinion is we should dehumanise anyone involved in the production of the Sun, the Times, the Mail and the Spectator, because that's what they've done to us already.

1318699342488887308 2020-10-21 07:43:18 +0800 <epiplexis_> @shirleymush Burnham would abstain/vote for all the Bad Things, peddle Legitimate Concerns, and occasionally catch the government making procedural errors.  Yes, he's just another Yvette Cooper.

1313006750552010752 2020-10-05 14:42:58 +0800 <epiplexis_> Hi @DrRosena, you made a big deal of pretending your abstention on the Make War Crimes Legal Bill would mean it gets meaningfully ammended later.  Do you plan to do the same here, and if so, what specific crimes do you hope are "amended in the third reading" and what should pass?
1313004108580823040 2020-10-05 14:32:28 +0800 <epiplexis_> @alexdobs91 @Johannisnotcool @ChrisCorney1 @Aiannucci @MattHancock So, no; there's no such thing as a "community leader" who represents everyone who may self-identify or be part of a particular ethnic or other group and a liberal democracy should not create a "millet system" of approved community bodies that speak for everyone in that community.
1313003643805872129 2020-10-05 14:30:37 +0800 <epiplexis_> @alexdobs91 @Johannisnotcool @ChrisCorney1 @Aiannucci @MattHancock And other communities such as British Palestinians deserve the same, but when they do so they are called antisemites.  There's also no such thing as a single community of anything. Communities have their own internal dynamics.

If you want to do that, it works for all such "communities".  The Tory manifesto had quite literal fascism in and all of Corbyn's loudest critics said nothing.

1312545917598400512 2020-10-04 08:11:47 +0800 <epiplexis_> @ojambojambosam @RobTanner83 @socialistdogma @BritainElects @RedfieldWilton I can only conclude he doesn't think racism against Black or Asian people is actually "real" racism. Hopefully, he'll be along to correct me and help me put the two pieces together - voting for racist deportation laws but also being "anti-racist".
1312545071259148288 2020-10-04 08:08:25 +0800 <epiplexis_> @RobTanner83 @socialistdogma @BritainElects @RedfieldWilton You said you're an "anti-racist", but have felt no anger, no dismay, no concern about voting for a party that helped pass a law that enabled Windrush deportations and makes Black, Asian and other minority British citizens de facto second tier citizens.
1312544049648332802 2020-10-04 08:04:21 +0800 <epiplexis_> @RobTanner83 You're saying you're proud to vote for the party that helped pass racist deportation laws, and at best was too cowardly to take a stand so kept quiet.

1312541276236132353 2020-10-04 07:53:20 +0800 <epiplexis_> In case anyone comes across this guy, he's "proud" he voted for the Lib Dems, despite them being part of the coalition that made the 2014 Immigration Act. This act made the Windrush deportations possible and lets a HomeSec remove citizenship from anyone with 'foreign' origins.

This led to the infamous Windrush deportations and allows a Home Secretary to strip citizenship from anyone deemed to have 'foreign' heritage.

Most left-wing politicians and activists see a world beyond capitalism. Obv this involves a transformation of labour/capital, but often starts with eliminating the very notion of profit from public services.

Has anyone told his friend Wesley?

America is uniquely placed to cause 'evil' far beyond its borders and has repeatedly done so. All Trump does it expose this out in the open and take it home to America.
1309383343746711558 2020-09-25 14:44:50 +0800 <epiplexis_> If Donald Trump had simply used flowery rhetoric and hired more minority child killers, he'd have been praised the same way child-murdering psychopaths Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are praised.

Only one US president has used nukes killing countless people. He was a Democrat and is considered a great leader. Other great US presidents have body counts in the millions.  Mass murder is an integral part of the country's politics.

1309380642992349189 2020-09-25 14:34:07 +0800 <epiplexis_> @borithan I never said he will stop any of those things. I said he will damage America and make it harder for it to do those things. The other side is only upset he's an incompetent warmonger.  Just recently Biden was tweeting our American propaganda against its "enemies" in the Americas.

Unfortunate, not desired, but a consequence of America enacted American foreign policy on its own people.  The real aim is Trump damaging America, politically, economically, damaging its reputation

The goal is quite specific: damage to America, internally or externally. Damage to its reputation and ability to focus on imperialism.

Millions have been killed by so-called mainstream US presidents. Bill Clinton's govt thought killing 500k Iraqi children was a price "worth" paying - don't think even Trump has said something like this.

Desire or threatened doesn't make much of a difference, especially in the context of using nuclear weapons, unless you're doing some silly psychoanalysis.

That wasn't my stupid point.  Again, Trump will not end US imperialism. He damages America, ideally significantly and the net benefit of that damage is good.

I'm glad you raised Vietnam, because it shows mass murder is an integral part of US politics and Trump's greatest 'crime' for many is to simply a. be 'bad' at imperialism and b. say the quiet part out loud all the time.
1309244321535795205 2020-09-25 05:32:25 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard @paulkrugman Because of choices made after 1990.  But that's not the point here.  America has not been humiliated into submission. It is killing itself and that's good for us.

1309172910129655809 2020-09-25 00:48:39 +0800 <epiplexis_> @misterUkelele @RationalDis @memorie_holiday My argument is Trump is worse for America. He's the lesser evil for the rest of us stuck on this planet with the deranged bloodthirsty US imperial war machine.  I hope he actively starts mass internal conflict and makes America less effective at coups, regime change and wars.

Better an incompetent bastard who makes a mess inside America than a competent warmonger who does more effective coups and regime change.  Besides, America can enjoy a little American foreign policy as a treat.

1309112784668495872 2020-09-24 20:49:44 +0800 <epiplexis_> A lot of people confuse 'skilled at a specific profession' for being incredibly clever.  He's not incredibly clever, he isn't charismatic, he snaps under pressure, he has zero wit.  In other words, he looks and sounds like company middle management.

An incompetent, cruel bastard causing a mess that results in mass internal conflict - who knows even civil war - that results in less than effective empire management is a net good.
1309024755492810753 2020-09-24 14:59:56 +0800 <epiplexis_> Apparently, Starmer needs to be lobbied to prevent his office or allies leaking stuff to far-right websites in order to attack left-wing MPs.  That's how intelligent Kieth QC is.

The same people who failed to convince their peers to defend the remnants of lib democracy now becoming political strategists.

While they're not huge Starmer fans, they struggled with the suggestion that Labour's loyal and traditional voters from its heartlands aren't white, and maybe they should teach Labour a lesson.

1307599819976966145 2020-09-20 16:37:45 +0800 <epiplexis_> @BareLeft At this point, their argument appears to be "Starmer fooled the government into doing this so lots of people would suffer and Labour could profit from the fallout".

1305459501601087494 2020-09-14 18:52:54 +0800 <epiplexis_> "but competently"
1305449435669856262 2020-09-14 18:12:54 +0800 <epiplexis_> @bat020 And funnily enough this is where a former Labour leader was really only a committed champion of liberal international institutions that support "international law".

He secretly voted Leave and used Remain sentiments to create a media profile for himself.  He definitely fooled a lot of people, so don't be upset.

Throughout this sorry saga that will take decades to mop up, he has waived it all through. It is a tragedy. Chaos with Jeremy Corbyn would have lead us out if this mess I’m sure. But Starmer? No. He’s a Brexit-enabler.  https://t.co/U82Fmr6hTN

The other side ("us, the west") just had more money to bribe/buy people, bigger guns and more bombs; and for all the rhetoric used by both sides, more ruthless and bloodthirsty if the situation required it.

Not just FDR types, but even Nixon wanted mass expansion of guaranteed incomes, but failed.)
1305011463413805056 2020-09-13 13:12:33 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Lafargue ...which is why the left has been arguing for defending/expanding gains made under liberal democracy.

1305008677292777472 2020-09-13 13:01:29 +0800 <epiplexis_> I disagree with my mutuals.  We should encourage this nonsense to help finish off the Labour Party.

If it's a question of class, then BME voters who see themselves as middle class and upwardly mobile vote Tory not Lib Dem.
1303820601874931712 2020-09-10 06:20:29 +0800 <epiplexis_> @cymrurouge Yep, but also with regard to that specific claim: why would identifiable groups of people who have historically favoured Labour and specifically favoured the leader at the time have chosen a party which has limited appeal among said groups.

1301329532536881152 2020-09-03 09:21:52 +0800 <epiplexis_> Here's elite Tory MP @AndrewBowie_MP trying to force political correctness down our throats.
1301323527518265345 2020-09-03 08:58:01 +0800 <epiplexis_> @PippaCrerar Oh look, it's one of the professional trolls known as a British Journalist.
1301323349105111040 2020-09-03 08:57:18 +0800 <epiplexis_> @UK_Centrist @PippaCrerar Why are you lying, John?
1301323286614175744 2020-09-03 08:57:03 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Nickesanderson @PippaCrerar Why are you lying, Nick?
1301323135262666752 2020-09-03 08:56:27 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Paul_Rochester @PippaCrerar Why are you spreading lies, Paul.
1301226696054657029 2020-09-03 02:33:14 +0800 <epiplexis_> @flying_rodent Just can't get over Dave, who fearlessly attacked some mums and dads that were asking big companies to use less of their ad budgets in certain newspapers, keeping quiet over this.
1301225474144768003 2020-09-03 02:28:23 +0800 <epiplexis_> If I wanted to portray myself as one of the Good Guys, I'd probably keep quiet about the number of friends I have who work/ed at far-right media platforms.  https://t.co/SeQ7stD3lC

1301222876872347655 2020-09-03 02:18:04 +0800 <epiplexis_> @ejhchess @jimwaterson Not even his brother-in-law.
1301221423546093568 2020-09-03 02:12:17 +0800 <epiplexis_> @keewa @cymrurouge And this time it's well and truly deserved.
1301219167035682816 2020-09-03 02:03:19 +0800 <epiplexis_> Lol, owned.
1301216320415989760 2020-09-03 01:52:00 +0800 <epiplexis_> @joolsd With the added caveat that like us they probably also have a significant % of the country addled with spite so pure they'd rather others just suffer more than actually end suffering for everyone.
1301215759163707393 2020-09-03 01:49:47 +0800 <epiplexis_> @joolsd One of the weirdest and bleak things I discovered when reading up on the US police was civil asset forfeiture. It's utterly corrupt by most accounts and I suspect hatred of the police even in the US is more widespread than many stereotypes anticipate.
1301214811745812486 2020-09-03 01:46:01 +0800 <epiplexis_> @gem_ste And then there's the Worboys stuff they'll outsource to certain muckraking websites.
1301214604324933632 2020-09-03 01:45:11 +0800 <epiplexis_> Took longer than two days, but here we are.
1301210210674118657 2020-09-03 01:27:44 +0800 <epiplexis_> @AbiWilks He doesn't feel the same way about our kids who are fair game to him and his political allies.
1301209846398808067 2020-09-03 01:26:17 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Philgebunts @cymrurouge There is an element of that: my main interest is that stuff like MMT shows it has always been about brute power, not "hard work" or "sensible economics", but as you note the chance for taking that power has evaporated in recent months.
1301207112425648131 2020-09-03 01:15:25 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Philgebunts @cymrurouge I'm only a layman here, but on the technicalities I think MMT is sort of post-Keynes, so you're not wrong to say it has a lot of stuff is familiar, but it reworks it in a different way ("print" rather than "borrow" in my layman's understanding).
1301206490183880704 2020-09-03 01:12:57 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Philgebunts @cymrurouge We have two broad options: use whatever we have now to get to a world beyond capitalism, or have a (violent) revolution where we completely change the way we think about a political economy.  I see heterodox economics like MMT in the former category.
1301201648132534273 2020-09-03 00:53:42 +0800 <epiplexis_> @cymrurouge @Philgebunts We've just seen two events either side of the last decade which shows that "making money and giving it to people" can work when there's the political will. It's always been a question of equity, not mathematics.
1301200866498748418 2020-09-03 00:50:36 +0800 <epiplexis_> They only need to put a photo of John Worboys next to Kieth QC and the rest will be history.
1301200402277335041 2020-09-03 00:48:45 +0800 <epiplexis_> @DurstApologist Oh yeah, this fucker. Another data point for my Soft Left To Ethnonationalist Pipeline Theory.   https://t.co/rr50qdlTr9
1301197094791806976 2020-09-03 00:35:37 +0800 <epiplexis_> Amazing move, sure to help many people across Africa decide whether or not to side with China.
1301145006263107584 2020-09-02 21:08:38 +0800 <epiplexis_> @levisatyrane Turned on Corbyn after years prattling about his anti-establishment credentials.
1301133006908919810 2020-09-02 20:20:57 +0800 <epiplexis_> CITIZEN, YOU ARE YET TO EXPERIENCE YOUR MANDATORY DAILY FEELING OF FIZZ AND EXCITEMENT AT YOUR WORKPLACE.
1301132333026770946 2020-09-02 20:18:16 +0800 <epiplexis_> @ScaryNewDad World class trolling.
1301129965652541440 2020-09-02 20:08:52 +0800 <epiplexis_> @SyedforLondon @willdizard @DimifromPowys Just today, a Tory politician has usefully helped coalesce some of this stuff into an easy answer.  ~40% of people in the country explicitly support being cruel to "undesirables"; and a lot of them are small biz landlords, homeowners, and pensioners.   https://t.co/TSD3HhII4b
1301124045056995330 2020-09-02 19:45:20 +0800 <epiplexis_> Andy is chairman of Press Holdings; a former BBC personality earning approx. £200k per year; a former editor of various Tory-supporting newspapers; and owns a home in the south of France.  His name also allegedly appears in Jeffrey Epstein's black book.

1301122485618966529 2020-09-02 19:39:08 +0800 <epiplexis_> @ElBo15270002 @JohnLowe56 @norbois_south @jack_saundrs I got a (small) cheque in the late 90s and then was 'lucky' enough to be means-tested for the original tution fees for the remainder of my time.  I left with no student debt.
1301118598577094660 2020-09-02 19:23:42 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard Imo, his main personal failing was to be too reconciliatory with his internal Labour enemies and try to convince them they had a common cause against the other side. He should have been a mean bastard, but then that's not why he won the leadership in the first place.
1301117947050688513 2020-09-02 19:21:06 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard The same (yes complicated) multifarious reasons Bernie Sanders didn't win. Institutional, historical, party factionalism, sociological, pushback from the establishment across-the-board, how our version of machine politics works, and the British specific one: Brexit.
1301115747918376960 2020-09-02 19:12:22 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard The day after the Manchester bombings (in which the perpetrators have a murky background linked to British foreign policy in Libya...), Corbyn spoke explicitly on foreign policy and terrorism... and subsequent opinion polls agreed with him.  https://t.co/1bWBkus14x
1301114839146942465 2020-09-02 19:08:45 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard What did for Corbyn was caving in on Brexit. That's on him for sure, but his instincts (get it over with, make a public stand to respect the EU referendum) were correct.
1301114163595485186 2020-09-02 19:06:04 +0800 <epiplexis_> Barmy take, but not surprising given the "source" of the facts being presented.
1301114025942683650 2020-09-02 19:05:31 +0800 <epiplexis_> @willdizard No, it's not. It's a stupid article by a clueless fool.  Name a time Hillary Clinton said she'd rather go to jail in suppot of a popular protest and riots then pay a hated tax introduced by a sitting government.
1301058834790785024 2020-09-02 15:26:13 +0800 <epiplexis_> More American oligarchs enter the Culture War in the UK.
1301016818136436738 2020-09-02 12:39:15 +0800 <epiplexis_> @GarlickWitch @Lafargue Analysts who are good at number crunching often make for bad decision-makers because they conceptualise 'risk' poorly (risk being both the likelihood and the consequences) - at least this is what I see in engineering all the time.
1300992640146702337 2020-09-02 11:03:11 +0800 <epiplexis_> @c4prihun @T_mcilhatton Why would anyone want to unite with psychopathic war criminals and racists like 90% of the PLP.
1300984136388149248 2020-09-02 10:29:23 +0800 <epiplexis_> @hewetson_colin @Zubhaque Let's make obtaining an ID free and convenient then.
1300981613044658182 2020-09-02 10:19:22 +0800 <epiplexis_> This is extremely good. A messy divided USA forever fighting internal wars is good for the world.
1300973531677814790 2020-09-02 09:47:15 +0800 <epiplexis_> Brain-dead.
1300970027537952769 2020-09-02 09:33:20 +0800 <epiplexis_> Interesting watching from the outside and seeing the 'left needs to hegemonise the liberal centre' theory being tested.
1300928095743025152 2020-09-02 06:46:42 +0800 <epiplexis_> @IWTheDarkPrince @Keir_Starmer Are you preparing for a job interview, Benny?

1300839307406716929 2020-09-02 00:53:53 +0800 <epiplexis_> @KlezmerRouge Absolutely. They scream for "debate" but don't want it.  One of the v/few things to learn from the Right is repeating your simple message every single time without debate.  I think our side wants to 'prove' everything. Fuck it. Just assert repeatedly and without compromise.
1300827751587426306 2020-09-02 00:07:58 +0800 <epiplexis_> @Mr_Considerate The half-brother of the royal owner of Man City fired a gun at a man, inserted a cattle prod in the man's anus, set fire to the man's testicles, beat the man, poured salt into the man's wounds, and then ran the man over. He then had the guy apologise for inconveniencing him.

1300807406851624960 2020-09-01 22:47:08 +0800 <epiplexis_> @gem_ste BBC millionaire comedians as Frankie Carbon definitely makes sense.

1300732026048466945 2020-09-01 17:47:36 +0800 <epiplexis_> This is no different to the US using sanctions to impose their own will.
1300725763486908416 2020-09-01 17:22:42 +0800 <epiplexis_> Matt Chorley has apparently unblocked most of the shitpost left.  This means he needs to troll for publicity as someone at Times Radio has told him the listening figures aren't reaching whatever KPI he was set in his contract.  Maybe we now should all block him en masse.
