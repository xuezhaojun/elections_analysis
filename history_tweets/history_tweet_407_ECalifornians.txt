1341167930348748802 2020-12-22 07:45:26 +0800 <ECalifornians> Wow, identity politics all the way all the day!
1339076463589433345 2020-12-16 13:14:42 +0800 <ECalifornians> Don't the city officials have anything better to do?  I heard there is a deadly pandemic that has caused several state shutdowns?  Hello!
1338032384277499906 2020-12-13 16:05:54 +0800 <ECalifornians> @elizfulop Rules rules and rules. I can see how is the USA sinking.

1338031791127465984 2020-12-13 16:03:33 +0800 <ECalifornians> @elizfulop This stiffness is not acceptable and you should sue them for sure!
1337940895547551745 2020-12-13 10:02:21 +0800 <ECalifornians> @MayorOfLA Why the hell did you ask the city departments and private businesses to spend their scarce resources in preparation for #prop16 during this pandemic?  And now did you know it was voted down by voters from the states?  Can you be more responsible for the people?  Shame on you!  https://t.co/II1KnmY45h

1337686654740385795 2020-12-12 17:12:06 +0800 <ECalifornians> WTF? Slapping an old man for returning your money?   What a jerk!!!

1337474281609936896 2020-12-12 03:08:12 +0800 <ECalifornians> @JennyChachan @stoolpresidente In California, what the politicians want is to regulate our lives, not to let us earn our own lives. They want to decide: What/How you eat Who you sleep with What ideologies your kids are taught at school When/How do you travel How you (not) gather with friends &amp; family etc....  https://t.co/LOH6QfSiCq

1336558709170958337 2020-12-09 14:30:02 +0800 <ECalifornians> On 11/4 we played a game of guessing the #prop16 voting result, and we've received 50 responses in total.  Now as the result stabilized to 57.2%, we have a winner!  Congrats @DaisyCalOC for your excellent vision predicting a 57.21%!    And the prize would be a #NoProp16 hat!  https://t.co/g32TczGSkt

1336081639621857280 2020-12-08 06:54:20 +0800 <ECalifornians> @1ruthlessmom I can hear that! lol
1336056347553529856 2020-12-08 05:13:50 +0800 <ECalifornians> @RayLiuNYC @1ruthlessmom Easy to fix, if they think they are all racists then all quit the job! Treat themselves as the how they treated conservatives.
1336004356437524480 2020-12-08 01:47:14 +0800 <ECalifornians> @RayLiuNYC @1ruthlessmom Unfortunately, they could do this only because a lot of people "believe in systemic racism and white privilege".

Andrew you need to conduct some objective interviews for journals.
1333297059533733888 2020-11-30 14:29:25 +0800 <ECalifornians> @JeffreyCor Sure
1333288890807926786 2020-11-30 13:56:57 +0800 <ECalifornians> Identity politics everywhere and we have nowhere to hide. It's time to fight back!
1333285059898396673 2020-11-30 13:41:44 +0800 <ECalifornians> @JeffreyCor It was never relevant to compare votes total against "eligible" voters, it has to be with registered voters. Please be clear about this.
1333284544812728322 2020-11-30 13:39:41 +0800 <ECalifornians> @edifiquest Prof. @GailHeriot what is the average retry time before you give up on a bad student?
1333284048827949061 2020-11-30 13:37:43 +0800 <ECalifornians> Here is the thing, out of 250 million eligible voters there are only about 145 million registered to vote. Registered voters, this is not even math yet.
1333281892527788032 2020-11-30 13:29:09 +0800 <ECalifornians> Will they learn or We the People have to teach them again and again?
1332685390017228800 2020-11-28 21:58:51 +0800 <ECalifornians> LoL, wait a few days we will all know that 2020 is the first year that the USA voters sent out more votes than the total of themselves.  First time ever, the USA surpasses itself!  The ancient saying, "Your most dangerous enemy is yourself!"  Shall we celebrate about it now?  https://t.co/bOgKcoF4fY
1332684290505596935 2020-11-28 21:54:29 +0800 <ECalifornians> My question is, why wasn't one of the candidate automatically deprived of the candidacy?

1321983735986675712 2020-10-30 09:14:18 +0800 <ECalifornians> Deep in their subconscious,  the #YesOnProp16 people know they actually should vote No on #prop16, so they just cannot get enough #NoProp16 yard signs for themselves.  "God, please forgive them, for they know not what they do!"
1321978109470547968 2020-10-30 08:51:57 +0800 <ECalifornians> The #YesOnProp16 people can never have such a #myshot from their events.

1321936345485307904 2020-10-30 06:05:59 +0800 <ECalifornians> Is this the best #YesOn16 can do? Insulting voter's IQ, again?  I can see why #prop16 is not supported by the majority of voters now. Thank you #YesOn16 for working so hard to defeat #prop16!  #WeAreInThisTogether! #NoOnProp16
