1319473961428750342 2020-10-23 11:01:21 +0800 <MichaelJFell> @Connectionary Thanks Sean.
1319467720174391298 2020-10-23 10:36:33 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden is spewing empty rhetoric. Platitudes with nothing to back them up but lie after lie.
1319465481733103618 2020-10-23 10:27:39 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden's claiming "clean energy" will create millions of new jobs. Exactly what obama claimed. It was a lie then. It's still a lie. They spend hundreds of billion$ on "green energy" businesses that filed for bankruptcy after the federal money dried up.
1319464802390036482 2020-10-23 10:24:58 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Global warming/aka climate change is a Marxist hoax. Biden is siding with Marxists to destroy affordable energy for people around the entire globe.
1319464169310244874 2020-10-23 10:22:27 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Now Biden's lying again. He was proud of the crime bill he cowrote &amp; sponsored through the U.S. Senate.  He's running away from it now in an attempt to salvage black votes.
1319462128286420992 2020-10-23 10:14:20 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden forgets that his calling black criminals "predators" is on video for everyone to see.   Biden lies.   https://t.co/setagxhrTz
1319459190897844224 2020-10-23 10:02:40 +0800 <MichaelJFell> $15 an hour minimum wage has destroyed jobs in every location where it's been mandated.  FACT.
1319458541552455681 2020-10-23 10:00:05 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Now Biden's stealing obama's lie about no red states &amp; no blue states. obama/Biden spent 8 years attacking red states.
1319457850591248395 2020-10-23 09:57:20 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden lies again. The Trump tax cuts meant I took home more money with each paycheck IN SPITE OF THE FACT that healthcare expenses went up every year because of insurance company destruction caused by "obamacare."
1319457176528785408 2020-10-23 09:54:39 +0800 <MichaelJFell> People will have affordable care by having competition between insurance companies in a free market. Government run single payer healthcare is the exact opposite.  Again Biden lies with the greatest ease.
1319456621450362880 2020-10-23 09:52:27 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden's lying again. He says NOBODY lost their private healthcare plan because of "obamacare." The company I worked for had three different companies in 6 years because prices skyrocketed. The last company was chosen because their premiums had ONLY RISEN BY 33%!
1319455961040420867 2020-10-23 09:49:50 +0800 <MichaelJFell> The unaffordable care act was a catastrophe. Prices, co-pays &amp; deductables went up. Choices shrank. 20 million people were FORCED to get coverage from "obamacare" because the coverage mandate destroyed competition across the nation. 180 million people have private.
1319454383915008000 2020-10-23 09:43:34 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden lying again. Middle class families are struggling because Biden's ally Pelosi has refused to provide relief to families struggling because of Covid closures.
1319452986066784262 2020-10-23 09:38:00 +0800 <MichaelJFell> The guy who's on video tape bragging about the quid quo pro blackmail he pulled on Ukraine is accusing President Trump of taking money from Ukraine.  Stunning amount of lying by Biden.
1319451622129438726 2020-10-23 09:32:35 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden lies with the greatest of ease.  Truly a career skill.
1319450512052420610 2020-10-23 09:28:10 +0800 <MichaelJFell> No Biden's playing the Russia card.  Never mind that Communist China owns the Biden family. Never mind that Biden sold American manufacturing out to China.
1319450089006551040 2020-10-23 09:26:30 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden's lying through his teeth again...I guess that's what happens when you spend 47 years in DC being taught how to lie by professional liars...um, I mean career politicians.
1319449108655099905 2020-10-23 09:22:36 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Joe doesn't know that America's testing more than any other country.
1319448211128569856 2020-10-23 09:19:02 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden is living in a fantasy world. We should have shut down the virus, not the country? This is the same clown who said he'd shut the country down if the scientists said it was needed.
1319446645738819589 2020-10-23 09:12:49 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden was asked to give his plan to fight Covid...he attacked .@realDonaldTrump &amp; concluded with "I'll make sure we have a plan."    Classic non-answer filled word salad.
1319445882799095810 2020-10-23 09:09:47 +0800 <MichaelJFell> 2 minutes filled with Biden lying through his teeth.
1319441093952442370 2020-10-23 08:50:45 +0800 <MichaelJFell> It'd be great for President Trump to reply to a Biden remark with: "Sure, big guy."

It's not about rights, it's about changing the definition of marriage.

1314031511092580356 2020-10-08 10:35:00 +0800 <MichaelJFell> VP Mike Pence shed light on the reality of life in America today by telling the truth. Harris attacked America by spewing lies in hopes that the "progressive" Party Pravda will have brainwashed enough voters into believing those lies.
1314030983172292608 2020-10-08 10:32:54 +0800 <MichaelJFell> The reason politicians are tearing each other apart is because "progressive" leftist liars are power mad dictators in waiting. If you want to live in a free country, reject them lock, stock &amp; barrel. They are not interested in you. They're interested in gaining tyrannical power.
1314030409416617984 2020-10-08 10:30:37 +0800 <MichaelJFell> @Angieliberty I find smug and arrogant to be very unlikable.
1314029252245950465 2020-10-08 10:26:01 +0800 <MichaelJFell> The military people who are supporting Biden are the people Obama put in place after REAL military personnel refused to pledge support to Obama instead of the U.S. Constitution.  Still more lies from a "progressive" leftist "democrat."
1314028490103062528 2020-10-08 10:23:00 +0800 <MichaelJFell> What VP Pence said about Harris's record as AG of CA is 100% spot on!  Harris is gaslighting like crazy. She's as phony as a $3 bill.
1314028022610178048 2020-10-08 10:21:08 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Now Harris is repeating the lie about "good people on both sides." An out and out lie. Plain &amp; simple. The video of President Trump's remarks clearly show Harris is lying through her teeth for political gain.
1314027449085235202 2020-10-08 10:18:51 +0800 <MichaelJFell> As a prosecutor, Harris imprisoned black folks for smoking a joint.
1314026648581410818 2020-10-08 10:15:41 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Now Harris is repeating the oft told lie about "peaceful protests." Peaceful protests don't lead to damages estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars. She's protecting Marxist insurgents.
1314026278048223234 2020-10-08 10:14:12 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Now Harris is lying again about the lie about systemic racism within America's police forces.
1314025942218661888 2020-10-08 10:12:52 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Now, instead of answering the question about stacking the SCOTUS, she played the race card.  Harris is a lying coward.
1314025699590778882 2020-10-08 10:11:54 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris is being her typical, unlikable self.
1314025375996022788 2020-10-08 10:10:37 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris is gaslighting to the max. She is filibustering to avoid answering a direct question about stacking the SCOTUS.
1314024806430507010 2020-10-08 10:08:21 +0800 <MichaelJFell> The "affordable care act" caused premiums &amp; co-pays to skyrocket while the choices of healthcare options were reduced dramatically. You didn't get to keep your doctor or your healthcare plan! Harris is lying again!
1314024413898170370 2020-10-08 10:06:48 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Killing an unborn baby, with it's own unique strand of self replicating human DNA is NOT part of the woman's body.
1314024130539335681 2020-10-08 10:05:40 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden is a "catholic" who supports late term abortion. Harris is spewing more hogwash.
1314022848743247875 2020-10-08 10:00:35 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris is now repeating the lie about President Trump &amp; the military. The U.S. military love President Trump because he's rearmed them &amp; is ensuring rapid healthcare for veterans.
1314021867074867200 2020-10-08 09:56:41 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris claims President Trump is cozying up to tyrants &amp; dictators. Meanwhile Biden's son has made millions upon millions $$ from the CCP, a Russian oligarch &amp; corrupt politicians in Ukraine because his daddy was VP of the USA.
1314020848341262343 2020-10-08 09:52:38 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris keeps repeating the lie of a manufacturing recession.
1314019363452850176 2020-10-08 09:46:44 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Now Harris is lying about losing manufacturing jobs. Biden will kiss Communist China's behind &amp; resume shipping manufacturing jobs to the CCP.
1314018861713444864 2020-10-08 09:44:44 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden's "plan" for "clean energy" will be a giant flop just like  in California, where city mayors are telling people to unplug appliances &amp; turn their thermostat to 78.  The "millions" of jobs will disappear as soon as the money Biden &amp; Harris steal thru taxes runs out.
1314017972445478912 2020-10-08 09:41:12 +0800 <MichaelJFell> @cathybena The exact same stunt Biden pulls in every debate.
1314016581119348737 2020-10-08 09:35:40 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden's going to raise taxes on everyone. Repealing the Trump tax cuts will raise taxes on middle &amp; low income households. Harris is lying through her teeth again.
1314016337044418560 2020-10-08 09:34:42 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Biden's going to raise taxes on everyone. Harris is lying through her teeth again.
1314015689120907265 2020-10-08 09:32:08 +0800 <MichaelJFell> "progressive" leftist "democrats" will tax America into a depression while claiming to be "investing" the money...while laundering the money into the pockets of their supporters...like Solyndra.
1314015187842854913 2020-10-08 09:30:08 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Susan Page keeps interrupting VP Pence &amp; keeps letting Harris run her mouth without interrupting.
1314014601353232385 2020-10-08 09:27:48 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris says Biden has been "transparent."  He refused to answer if he would pack the SCOTUS or if he would support eliminating the Senate filibuster. THAT'S "transparency??" Biden's a proven liar &amp; plagiarist.
1314013705185751041 2020-10-08 09:24:15 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris talking about values?? Values like burning cities to the ground? Values like killing unborn babies in the womb as systematically as Nazis exterminated Jews in gas chambers??
1314012140131561472 2020-10-08 09:18:02 +0800 <MichaelJFell> Harris is spewing nonsense. The people who are suffering from a collapsed economy live in blue states run by "progressive" leftist "democrats."
1314009915141349376 2020-10-08 09:09:11 +0800 <MichaelJFell> The 1st question and Harris is already lying her a$$ off.
