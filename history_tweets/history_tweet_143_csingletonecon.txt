This is how Govt and others should try to speak to the public about the science of the virus. Don't patronize, but inform and explain.

Reasoning, HA so great in rugby that refs take sympathy on away teams, which TMO overrides

1338065575826903042 2020-12-13 18:17:47 +0800 <csingletonecon> @ajurquhart1 @bernardjackman @ChampionsCup @PRO14Official @btsportrugby @top14rugby @jjreade More marginal calls? That matter? If it were comparable to what we found for football, both since lockdown and historically, I woudl expect the lack of a crowd to affect referee decision making more...

Also, unclear why the Premier League should be different from other leagues where fans are missing, which suggests it could be something else...

1337094609877544960 2020-12-11 01:59:31 +0800 <csingletonecon> @D_Blanchflower @BLS Thanks. Would be good to see what is happening with new hire wages and hours within some roughly defined "jobs" (occupation-geo) in CPS. Might take a look. Though guess somebody else will before I find the time.
1337071904268627969 2020-12-11 00:29:18 +0800 <csingletonecon> @D_Blanchflower Yep. Looking forward to playing with the 2020 and 2021 UK ASHE eventually, where you can easily track wages within jobs. AWE in UK is up too, markedly, especially when you look at "regular" pay.
1337055235072790528 2020-12-10 23:23:03 +0800 <csingletonecon> @D_Blanchflower Just composition? Within jobs, new hires or job stayers, real wages may be going down substantially...

1302698052411707393 2020-09-07 03:59:53 +0800 <csingletonecon> Hope this is smoke without fire. And I will enjoy the racing regardless, and marvel at these amazing sportsmen
1302698050738155528 2020-09-07 03:59:52 +0800 <csingletonecon> Is Le Tour a bit too fast this year? Breaking climbing records of Vino and Mayo, bastions of clean sport, is worrying. Was there any testing during lockdowns? I'm a massive road cycling fan and student of its history... so I don't like fast races:  https://t.co/aYjpM0adwJ

1301446983199186946 2020-09-03 17:08:35 +0800 <csingletonecon> Absolutely bang on. A new university year is about to start in the UK... let's please all put this debate and teach the economics of it in every Macro/Monetary course, at every level, even Econ101
1301082989233942528 2020-09-02 17:02:12 +0800 <csingletonecon> @DSchaeferEcon ... well you can miss it ... I wouldn't want to build up expectations at all. Here is the paper anyway:  https://t.co/zrVXWmNK0t
