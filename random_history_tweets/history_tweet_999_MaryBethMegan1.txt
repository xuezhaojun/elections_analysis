The last year has taught us that trump is astonishingly stupid, is abetted by a vile bunch of equally stupid republicans, and that we are seriously in need of education and critical thinking skills. Look up “socialism”.

1340124560860082179 2020-12-19 10:39:28 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Scammour
1340124244227846144 2020-12-19 10:38:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I actually can think of many. Oddly, they all seem to be Democrats.
1340123827100119041 2020-12-19 10:36:33 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> There’s something about this picture.
1340123655104294913 2020-12-19 10:35:52 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @chipfranklin Perhaps a choice should be made between public service and wealth-building when running for office.
1340123018857734144 2020-12-19 10:33:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> GOP becomes “Autocrats” instead of “Republicans”
1340122119653515264 2020-12-19 10:29:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @RepSwalwell Do you suppose he ever watches actual news, like the live reports from hospitals and health care workers? Do you think he believes what he says, or is it just for ratings? I can’t watch any of these vile nitwits, so I have to read reports from writers I trust.
1340112765869039616 2020-12-19 09:52:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @NYDailyNews “Likely”? This is obnoxious.

1339812880217235459 2020-12-18 14:00:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Watching the Bidens on Colbert, I wondered how anyone can see them and feel frightened or threatened, or anything other than calmed and reassured. This is the wild-eyed socialist monster that scares trumpers so much?

1339802245123223553 2020-12-18 13:18:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It looks like he might have sold us out to Putin on many levels.  The hacking seems at the same level of disinterest as the pandemic.
1339799281478365184 2020-12-18 13:06:55 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @MollyJongFast Even more evil because we know he knows better and just spouts this vile mush for ratings from the gullible.

1339782108584292352 2020-12-18 11:58:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> What policies?
1339781811396890630 2020-12-18 11:57:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @donwinslow 9 months seems like a bit of a magic number. Russian hacking, pandemic, Russian bounties on troops...

1339737764556890113 2020-12-18 09:02:28 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Much like the pandemic, trump is ignoring this scary hack. The destruction he’s already wrought could conceivably pale in comparison to this national security disaster that he is also fumbling. He needs to be gone yesterday

1339440361530384384 2020-12-17 13:20:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This could actually be in the same dire ballpark as the virus, and also hopelessly ignored by trump and his evil minions.

1339435698588438528 2020-12-17 13:02:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So trump screwed the pooch on the pandemic AND cyber security. What a dildo.

1339424714826104838 2020-12-17 12:18:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He offered the original agreement that he wouldn’t live there. Can this guy make deals, or what? Really drives a hard bargain.
1339424129896902656 2020-12-17 12:16:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Wow, what a bunch of nitwits. They get paid for this horse shit?

Keep quiet, ms. Coulter.
1339357915577278464 2020-12-17 07:53:05 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I hope Georgians realize that the two Senate seats  are important not just for partisan reasons, but that the McConnell gridlock benefits no one. Georgia republicans are as stymied as the democrats. Republicans need relief,too. McConnell is killing us all.
1339355931604377602 2020-12-17 07:45:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @FSUNOLES1 @JenniferThePart @ananavarro @chefjoseandres I don’t pay attention to the likes of Ann Coulter, but when I saw that she mocked one of the finest, most accomplished Americans on the planet, I have to tell her that she is a vile and stupid woman who should sit down and be quiet until she does her homework. Evil nitwit.
1339354283146358784 2020-12-17 07:38:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ananavarro @JenniferThePart @chefjoseandres Is she kidding? She really doesn’t know who Jose Andres is? Nut foreigner? Aren’t there any rules for broadcast journalism anymore? Of course, I guess Ann Coulter doesn’t count. Can’t count.
1339353054878035974 2020-12-17 07:33:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @AnnCoulter So you’re on a national news network and you don’t know who Jose Andres is? What rock have you been living under the last several years that you don’t know he’s a logistical genius who mobilizes massive relief efforts all over the world? Read some real news sometime. Sheesh.
1339352147050303488 2020-12-17 07:30:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Has the investigation into Graham’s attempt at election tampering begun yet?

1337614924093255680 2020-12-12 12:27:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I don’t think Biden wants any part of that kind of bogus self-aggrandizement. Let’s be done with that. I think it’s actually German.

1337614029376917505 2020-12-12 12:23:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’d very much like to know why editorial boards aren’t weighing in on all the criminality and sedition occurring in the trump party. If he’d gotten another 4 the press would be toast right along with the rest of us.  https://t.co/8f9VkL2lHD
1337613109037584386 2020-12-12 12:19:51 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It always seems to be a Republican. And Democrats are the scary lunatics. Weird.
1337612571831046146 2020-12-12 12:17:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @kurteichenwald @tomwatson We are so upside down and ass-backward that any aberration seems plausible. What anti-Constitution outrage will these weirdos come up with next? And could the next one work? All I want is to feel calm. Every morning I wake up with a jerk. And I don’t mean my husband.

1337610810441535488 2020-12-12 12:10:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @eliehonig As trump hands out pardons as parting gifts.
1337610485693353984 2020-12-12 12:09:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @eliehonig How many books will be written about the sheer, mindless cruelty of the trump administration?

They don’t actually get that he’ll do to them what he’s doing to us libtards? That he’s poisoning their air and water just like ours? That their kids are toast?

1337211918180823040 2020-12-11 09:45:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @TheRickWilson She should have some sort of music czarship in the Biden administration. Or maybe Ambassador to red states.

As usual, he regularly violates the 21 day residency restriction. He has to buy a house if he hasn’t already. Still-where does he vote?
1336484654912856065 2020-12-09 09:35:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Sooner or later these lawyers should be sanctioned for bringing frivolous lawsuits in service of a man actively trying to criminally subvert the free and fair American election.
1336483872884797443 2020-12-09 09:32:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @KLoeffler @Perduesenate Plain old American liberal here, donating to #WarnockandOssoff to regain American democratic values of humanity and service. You and Perdue; trump, McConnell, and the rest of the GOP are destroying us. We need to break the gridlock and move on.

They may have considered him unelectable, but they managed to make him acceptable. I shudder when I see clips of Mika, and Fallon ruffling his hair; Letterman’s affection.

Since when is that not a federal crime? He’s doing it in plain view, and even over the phone. Is that not some sort of wire fraud?
1336313274925789184 2020-12-08 22:14:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> A job he never did. The only thing he does is campaign.

1335986924171964424 2020-12-08 00:37:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @SethAbramson @dummieydebbiey I’m getting pretty bloody tired of trump and his vile minions accusing me and 80,000,000 others of fraud. We had to endure him. They must endure Biden for 4 years.
1335985785967964163 2020-12-08 00:33:27 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This should be widely disseminated and read. Thanks.
1335983859402493954 2020-12-08 00:25:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> When will trumpers get that trump’s evil deeds will kill them just as surely as they will kill us libtards, and probably more quickly, as the offenders have the most operations in the poorest (red) states? Wake up!
1335982594530435072 2020-12-08 00:20:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @clairecmc @thiafinart What I also find enraging are the aspersions being cast on poll workers. Where do these vile trumpers get off accusing thousands of poll workers of impropriety? They risked their health; indeed, their lives, to ensure the integrity of the election. What a nerve. Wake up.
1335981079946285056 2020-12-08 00:14:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I still want to know who pays for these time-wasting exercises in futility. And why no one has spoken up on behalf of the thousands, if not millions, of poll workers who risked their health to ensure a fair election. What insults to their integrity.
1335980168452710402 2020-12-08 00:11:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @erikhalvorsen18 @jdf754 I hope that Americans of all stripes realize that electing Ossoff and Warnock will not be so much partisan as a freeing-up of gridlock in Congress that may benefit all of us.
1335979396868476932 2020-12-08 00:08:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ProjectLincoln @JRP91428458 Trump was elected on the worst birthday of my life. I was terrified he’d pull his fat out of the fire once again on my birthday. The days between the 3rd and the 7th were almost unbearable- I felt nearly frozen with fear. The official call for Biden 11/7 was truly exhilarating.
1335976284736860162 2020-12-07 23:55:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is what it all comes down to. You can’t love trump and your fellow humans at the same time.

1335737003057553413 2020-12-07 08:04:52 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @monicagucci2015 I was devastated when trump won. I knew that he was scum; that he would likely do terrible damage to us and our democracy.  How do trumpers have that same sense of dread when they ponder a Biden presidency? How does such an obviously decent, committed public servant scare them?
1335734805024153601 2020-12-07 07:56:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> $2,000 a month would have enabled so many to stay home, keep their homes, support businesses, and put food on tables. A lost opportunity, like so many others. Tragic.

1335728241412288512 2020-12-07 07:30:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Georgia- no pressure, but there simply is no reason not to elect Jon Ossoff. He has your interests at heart. Perdue does not.

1334870433968123906 2020-12-04 22:41:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> While trump fiddled.
1334865121064210433 2020-12-04 22:20:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Another vile trumper killing Americans. And the futures of his own kids as well. How do these people sleep? How do they look their kids in the eye?

1334742553984372736 2020-12-04 14:13:17 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The deplorables never get tired of taking it up the rear end, do they?
1334742265198206976 2020-12-04 14:12:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> You can’t make it up. She will probably get a bump from her fabulous turn as fraud witness/ Karen. Maybe no Shakespeare, but Geico commercials, maybe, or late night for a few weeks.
1334741324990459905 2020-12-04 14:08:24 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> That’s her.
1334740995385286656 2020-12-04 14:07:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> 3 words. Ick. Ick. Ick.
1334739524291846144 2020-12-04 14:01:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> 80 is the new 12.
1334739113396854784 2020-12-04 13:59:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marceelias You are excellent.
1334738432954953728 2020-12-04 13:56:55 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @StevenBeschloss I still find it incredible that he attained that power. I’ve never gotten used to him at the White House, or on the presidential planes and helicopters; meeting world figures; addressing the press as if anything he has to say is meaningful. Impossible.
1334737029679210496 2020-12-04 13:51:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Do we need to know anything else about people whose sticking point on relief to suffering Americans is that businesses who force employees to work in unsafe conditions are safe from accountability and litigation? He is gross.
1334733042351562752 2020-12-04 13:35:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Sounds as if he’s more like $1,000,000,000+ in debt. How would anyone think this is okay in a president? He’s now raised $200,000,000 from his suckers and losers post-election that’s going right into his pocket. It ain’t going to charity, magats.

1333932679021080577 2020-12-02 08:35:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @donwinslow Does trump own an actual domicile in Florida? Mar-a-Lago is strictly considered a business by Palm Beach. Florida is good for hanging onto your home in legal proceedings, so he could have a bit of a haven if he’s ever bought a house. Never understood his voting status, either.

1333810089787072512 2020-12-02 00:28:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @robreiner Not only a loser, but a delusional, pathetic loser whose loss he can blame on all the trumpers that just did not love him enough.
1333809586416005120 2020-12-02 00:26:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> They really say this vile drivel out loud.
1333806009744318466 2020-12-02 00:11:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DrEricDing I’ll never get over the fact that the group of people whose job it was to monitor global disease and pandemics was disbanded by trump because it was an Obama initiative. That sort of task force is part of every modern nation’s toolkits. This was not aliens and spaceships.
1333803104500817930 2020-12-02 00:00:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marceelias In trump’s eternal quest of scapegoats, he’s now settled on the sycophants who just didn’t love him enough.
1333800196300447744 2020-12-01 23:48:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And they and the cat are rescues. About time!

1333579206408740866 2020-12-01 09:10:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> In Florida, people with discernible intellects are trying to control our own destinies. We wear masks, keep our distance, stay home or shop where masks are required. It’s all we can do when the Governor and his goons are trying to kill us.
1333578293703012354 2020-12-01 09:06:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @thetuckert @bengin1003 @jaketapper For all the people who say some trump supporters are nice people, I have to say, no, really, they’re really not.
1333577075551244290 2020-12-01 09:02:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’d like trump, Congresspeople, and all prospective candidates for public office to be administered this test.
1333576229258211328 2020-12-01 08:58:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We were lucky that trump is so stupid. The next one will, of necessity, be smarter. Close attention is warranted.

1333573366683480064 2020-12-01 08:47:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @kylegriffin1 @MarthaLynneOwe1 So all these states with the rigged elections need to negate all the Republicans that won?
1333572072828768257 2020-12-01 08:42:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Film at 11! Republican violates election law!
1333569861755285505 2020-12-01 08:33:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I still can’t relax- maybe when Joe is in the White House-but resigned to the possibility that trump’s flapping lips are going to be in our faces for the rest of my miserable life.
1333568446928474112 2020-12-01 08:27:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I keep wondering when the survivors’ lawsuits will begin.

1333565023919235086 2020-12-01 08:14:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It looks like the work of a stylist or hairdresser, not a barber.
1333560911777439748 2020-12-01 07:57:52 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> “Keep it up”- what Lindsey’s last boyfriend said

1333558572794458112 2020-12-01 07:48:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Can you take to your bed with a good book? Put yourself somewhere you normally don’t smoke. It can work.
1333557615301971969 2020-12-01 07:44:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It’s pretty hilarious that she thinks she understands working people. Adorable.
1333557054095716353 2020-12-01 07:42:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Knowing what we do about these candidates, how does anyone not vote for Ossoff and Warnock?
1333556547738333192 2020-12-01 07:40:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @lisaberley @joncoopertweets And a fair amount blew over. Promises kept, my ass. Thank god.
1333555975622684673 2020-12-01 07:38:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It’s really difficult to understand the loss in Florida.

1333555381256282113 2020-12-01 07:35:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @funder @JenniferThePart It seems he ought to be blaming “those disgusting people” whose hands he’s so glad not to have to shake due to Covid. Isn’t it their fault for not loving him enough?
1333554645545971712 2020-12-01 07:32:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DanPriceSeattle @JenniferThePart That much?
1333554394865004547 2020-12-01 07:31:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @B52Malmet I’m so confused. Every other day trump is mad at Fox, then they suck up, then he’s off them again. Which the bloody hell is it?
1333553740268396546 2020-12-01 07:29:22 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @sbg1 I am so tired of the obfuscation. I want trump and all the vile minions to just stop and leave us alone.

1333553057955721223 2020-12-01 07:26:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump It seems the feds take seriously their protection of confidential informants. It seems they should have kept him from becoming a presidential candidate. His criminality is well known in federal law enforcement circles. I feel betrayed every day.
1333552148785864704 2020-12-01 07:23:03 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ossoff Are there any numbers available on how many registrations there are?
1333551913036603395 2020-12-01 07:22:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I would be thrilled to get the chance to tell him in person to go fuck himself.
1333551466204827650 2020-12-01 07:20:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Every trump supporter should feel sick. The cruelty is the point.

1333545203014230018 2020-12-01 06:55:27 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> 80,000,000 stood with Biden against trump. Every legal vote has been counted, and we have stood up to the most corrupt president in the history of presidents. You and the rest of the thugs in the GOP are seditious creeps. We choose democracy.

1333216307265867776 2020-11-30 09:08:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @SenatorLoeffler Why do so many republicans feel the need to quote these meaningless Bible passages. Say what you mean.
1333215225026404353 2020-11-30 09:04:14 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ericgarland The Biden operation is class, so probably no leaks coming. Damn.

1333139327124201474 2020-11-30 04:02:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Really, lil Marco? Until your hero trump seized power, terrorists in Congress were frowned upon. Now, the likes of you and Sabatini are openly encouraging murder and mayhem while professing Christian beliefs. I’m hoping that a vast majority of Americans will wake up soon.
1333139324616003586 2020-11-30 04:02:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I would’t hold out any hope for Rubio ethics or grace. This is the Bible thumper that said “We love what they did in Texas”, referring to the terrorist trumpers trying to run the Biden bus off the road. “What they don’t know- We do this every day in Florida”.  #ExpelRubio

1331625104950894606 2020-11-25 23:45:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @KlasfeldReports @HunterJCullen Gettysburg is a very moving place. It should not be desecrated by seditious morons. I cried when I visited years ago. This abomination makes me want to cry again.
1331624409266876418 2020-11-25 23:42:54 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Maybe she’s using up trump’s stuff instead of having to pack it.
1331624132581203968 2020-11-25 23:41:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> My question exactly.
1331623372590116867 2020-11-25 23:38:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I hope they don’t desecrate the battlefield, but stay at the Wyndham parking lot or coffee room.

1331617952932765697 2020-11-25 23:17:14 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is hideous and must be addressed.
1331614767719587840 2020-11-25 23:04:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marcorubio #ExpelRubio. About Texas trumpers trying to run Biden bus off the road- “We love what they did! We do that every day in Florida!” Domestic terrorists have no place in Congress. #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio

When I woke up, I went back to bed and put my arms around my husband. We knew who trump was, but didn’t realize just how devastating his term would be. Trumpers should give Biden a chance, just like we had to.
1331359751679205378 2020-11-25 06:11:14 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @johnpavlovitz I thought they might try to get the turkeys to pardon trump.

This coming from the vile terrorist who complimented the trumpers who tried to run the Biden bus off the road in Texas. #ExpelRubio

1331269044310323201 2020-11-25 00:10:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why was lil Marco ever considered impressive? He always seems deficient, and now we find out he’s also a terrorist, cheering on trumper violence against the Biden campaign bus in Texas, and bragging that we like to do the same in Florida. Wrong again, mud head. #ExpelRubio
1331268141410902017 2020-11-25 00:07:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marcorubio Keep talking, #TerroristRubio. Tell us again about how proud you are that we in Florida also like to commit violent acts against our political adversaries, just like the trumpers in Texas. #ExpelRubio
1331267387329540108 2020-11-25 00:04:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’d like to #ExpelRubio immediately for his support of terrorism by trumpers on a Texas highway. A 2/3 majority would #ExpelRubio, but I’d settle for unseating him in ‘22. I’m going to be working on it. I refuse to tolerate terrorists in my Congress. #ExpelRubio #ExpelSabatini

1329449256520978434 2020-11-19 23:39:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @BandyXLee1 @hushnowlilbaby We need to be calling our representatives in Congress and BEGGING them to demand trump cooperate in the transition. We need to appeal to any shred of humanity they may have left, to keep him from killing thousands of us before he goes. Let Biden get started- PLEASE!

1329445327749918724 2020-11-19 23:24:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’d like to see the many thousands of poll workers speak up on their own behalf. These creeps are calling them crooks and cheats, when they are American heroes.
1329444862291288064 2020-11-19 23:22:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @thomaskaine5 Maybe we should downplay immediate indictment in the hope he thinks we forgot, and goes away easier.

1329443829326491653 2020-11-19 23:18:03 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @BillKristol @MarcVegan Our senator #ExpelRubio cheered the thugs in Texas that tried to run the Biden bus off the road, and bragged that we do that sort of thing all the time in Florida. I suggest that terrorism has no place in Congress. Does that really need to be said? #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio
1329442859481772035 2020-11-19 23:14:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> You forgot “terrorist”. My senator cheered on the thugs who tried to run the Biden bus off the road in Texas, and bragged that we do that kind of thing all the time in Florida. #ExpelRubio

1327436344059113473 2020-11-14 10:21:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @tonyschwartz I would like to see much stricter vetting of potential nominees. There was way too much criminality and debt in his past. Plus a civics goddamned test, please.

1327431930787356673 2020-11-14 10:03:29 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #CorruptKelly. Vote for Rev. Warnock, he’s superb.
1327431371879571456 2020-11-14 10:01:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @TheRealHoarse Quite a few of these probably related to all the trump rallies.
1327430597241933824 2020-11-14 09:58:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Acosta Good call. Stay safe, Dr.Fauci. Lots of dogs counting on you.
1327429680438390786 2020-11-14 09:54:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @RadioFreeTom Sorry to be mean, but it’s pretty much the reasonably intelligent or the dimwits.
1327428939040559106 2020-11-14 09:51:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @stucam7771 Lucky Scots.
1327428274830647298 2020-11-14 09:48:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> No shit, Sherlock.
1327428141372104706 2020-11-14 09:48:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I was paralyzed with fear that trump would somehow pull his fat out of the fire, so couldn’t watch any coverage. Saturday was glorious, then fear set in again at the coup attempt. Am now pretty okay,and back on Twitter,but still edgy and watching less to remain calm.

1327409333844512770 2020-11-14 08:33:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @thomaskaine5 4 years of evil has been interminable, but 4 for good will fly. We need to make appreciable progress in education, equality, justice, a healthier planet and populace. Tall order, but if we can make the world a better place even for those with whom we disagree, maybe...
1327406276532457483 2020-11-14 08:21:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And not done yet, are we?
1327406168122281984 2020-11-14 08:21:07 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Sounds like a plea for funds. From the poor schmucks who actually think he likes them.
1327405889863774213 2020-11-14 08:20:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Is there a bigger ass on the planet? I mean, besides the one sitting in the WH?

1327405223648899074 2020-11-14 08:17:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> As they say in horror movies, “It’s coming from inside the house”. Please don’t any of you nice Biden people go in there. I’m worried for them.
1327404786216546307 2020-11-14 08:15:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump Anybody ever find out what happened to the dough from trump’s debacle?
1327403924492529664 2020-11-14 08:12:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Oh, Alabama, you had the wonderful Doug Jones. What were you thinking? Do you enjoy being poorer, sicker, and less educated than most of the US?
1327401909557334019 2020-11-14 08:04:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Added to the hundreds infected at the rallies, this guy is the biggest threat to Americans’ health. He is the Plague.
1327401308329025536 2020-11-14 08:01:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> A DemocraticSenate will do more for people in the long run, but you don’t need to make a choice. If you can, give to both Dems and charities. You’ll be glad you did.

1327129044744347651 2020-11-13 13:59:55 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> No attention, no engagement, no ratings. Leave them to themselves with no interest from us.

1327115891864170497 2020-11-13 13:07:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Absolutely, and if there are local trump events, STAY AWAY. No engagement, ignore them, no oxygen. I believe they’ll peter out.  Unlike the women’s marches, marches for gun control and saving the planet, trumpers believe in nothing. Their only issue is a sort of status quo.
1327112737990782976 2020-11-13 12:55:07 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @MartynMcL @BarbaraPilskog Why didn’t Scotland investigate? He’s not THEIR president-there’s no DOJ memo there.

1327106870612549632 2020-11-13 12:31:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Can you imagine if he had 4 more years? That needs to be studied upon.
1327105890571399170 2020-11-13 12:27:55 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Trump
1327105649113767936 2020-11-13 12:26:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I would imagine he’ll be tied up with court cases. He’ll probably never see prison, but will be more interested in money-making projects to pay lawyers. Although, come to think of it, politics has made him quite a bit of coin. Business skills, not so much.
1327104508099506183 2020-11-13 12:22:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Such a signature move- and always spurious and lame. The only time this administration is transparent. We know it’s always baloney.

1327098799731453953 2020-11-13 11:59:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I wonder if he could find the US on a map of the US.
1327098537516085251 2020-11-13 11:58:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I just don’t want to lose too many great senators.

1327090707237134343 2020-11-13 11:27:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @kylegriffin1 @MSNBC Can ANYBODY explain why trump is killing his supporters, and they like it?
1327090406224515074 2020-11-13 11:26:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is extremely meaningful. And we should be ashamed.
1327088658344763392 2020-11-13 11:19:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> They never seem to get embarrassed.
1327087610376974336 2020-11-13 11:15:17 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He may be nervous about a ballot recount in SC, and scrutiny of his finances as he offers $1,000,000 reward after begging for money 2 weeks ago
1327085186673152005 2020-11-13 11:05:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @BSasyk No. Look to motive.
1327079810095591425 2020-11-13 10:44:17 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He’s killing the people who keep supporting him, and they like it. Lots of degrees in psychology will ensue to try and understand this.
1327078296497086465 2020-11-13 10:38:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @jasonintrator This guy does something at a college?
1327076504036061185 2020-11-13 10:31:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Certainly not an epidemiologist or immunologist. How does he know how immunity works?
1327075890623340544 2020-11-13 10:28:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Where’s beggar Lindsey getting all the sudden dough?

1327067956396908544 2020-11-13 09:57:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JohnCornyn Republicans seem to lose IQ points in direct correlation to their proximity to trump’s ass.
1327067335425986568 2020-11-13 09:54:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @SenRonJohnson Stop it. Just stop, you phony. You know bloody well the election is square. You should be ashamed.
1327065467203284995 2020-11-13 09:47:17 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JoeBorelliNYC Just another not-too-bright Republican, incapable of a bit of sacrifice for the greater good. Your family should be so proud. Hope you and your family stay well. Nobody should go through this illness, no matter how stupid and thoughtless.

1327027968464531456 2020-11-13 07:18:17 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why was Lindsey all over the airwaves weeping and begging for money if he has all this cash to throw around?
1327027566411194368 2020-11-13 07:16:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JohnCornyn GOP not too bright.

1327024966181777408 2020-11-13 07:06:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JohnCornyn And you make HOW MUCH as a senator? You belong behind a counter somewhere. Read a civics textbook, dimbulb.
1327024381445496832 2020-11-13 07:04:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Between the virus and the planet, I truly believe we would not have survived 4 more years. We must never let anyone like this happen again.
1327023554123141121 2020-11-13 07:00:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JohnCornyn When is the GOP going to study a civics book?
1326898795448250370 2020-11-12 22:45:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> “Legacy” just doesn’t seem like an appropriate word for the trump aftermath.
1326735219185967105 2020-11-12 11:55:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Is $130,000 some kind of magic GOP extortion number?

1326723093319061507 2020-11-12 11:06:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Not to belabor a point, but #ExpelRubio as chair of the Intelligence Committee is kind of an obvious oxymoron, isn’t it?
1326720135751675904 2020-11-12 10:55:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He gleefully promoted terrorist trumpers trying to run the Biden bus off the road in Texas. I refuse to forget this. I refuse to allow a terrorist to be my representative in Congress. #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio

1326700090216640514 2020-11-12 09:35:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Mocraig13 Without the $2 they get for every $1 they give, will they get dumber, sicker, and poorer?
1326698874908577792 2020-11-12 09:30:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @sanityandtruth @kylegriffin1 Despite all the roadblocks, he’s already President to me.
1326696475775086593 2020-11-12 09:21:03 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @mmpadellan I still don’t get why they care about the irrelevant trump.
1326693353703034880 2020-11-12 09:08:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JohnFetterman Seriously, where’s his $1,000,000?
1326692064537546754 2020-11-12 09:03:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Nice if his peeps could “succeed” with better education and healthcare.

1326683982679904258 2020-11-12 08:31:24 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Oh, Betty, you’re a daft twat!
1326683151259873281 2020-11-12 08:28:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> How does that go? You put in $1, take back $2? Doesn’t sound like succeeding to me.
1326672367914000390 2020-11-12 07:45:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> But wait, is it “fucking Christmas” or “Merry Christmas”?

1326668323694718976 2020-11-12 07:29:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @GOP @Jim_Jordan Was it three times the republicans refused the election security legislation? Almost seems like they didn’t want election security.
1326666558865862657 2020-11-12 07:22:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @LeonaLioness6 @DemNevada Doesn’t Kayleigh vote from Florida, where she doesn’t live? Don’t  Donnie and Mel vote from Florida? Did he finally buy a house instead of trying to use his club, which is strictly considered a business?
1326664440041893889 2020-11-12 07:13:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So proud here in Florida.

1326664088508915712 2020-11-12 07:12:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And somehow only worked for Biden. Somehow the downballot republicans did fine. Weird, isn’t it?
1326663490514378752 2020-11-12 07:09:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @NotHoodlum And still about the poorest, sickest, and least educated. “Succeed”? I think not.

1326568984125321222 2020-11-12 00:54:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And, as usual, inappropriately saluting instead of hand over heart. It is a disgrace that he does not know what to do after 4 years.
1326568534495932418 2020-11-12 00:52:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DWUhlfelderLaw After #ExpelRubio’s shameful support of terrorism on a Texas highway recently, he should be removed from office. No representative of the American people can be allowed to promote domestic terrorism. This was akin to attempted murder. #ExpelRubio.

1326170183434690564 2020-11-10 22:29:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He wants to kill as many of us as possible on the way out. Why don’t trumpers want Covid to go away?

1325643721212383232 2020-11-09 11:37:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Has anyone noticed that trump doesn’t actually do anything but golf and kvetch? Any U.S. business being done?
1325640425227554817 2020-11-09 11:24:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Really, you can’t help but think he got caught doing something VERY, VERY shameful.
1325640009580425217 2020-11-09 11:23:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We made a terrible mistake. We would not be in this mess. She would have been on top of the virus threat early on, and so many lives would have been saved, here and abroad, because she would have had the best people on it and global cooperation from the onset. Tragic mistake.

1325504752352890880 2020-11-09 02:25:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Did I read that Newt would probably advise him that campaign debt can be left unpaid? Gingrich left $4,000,000or so?
1325503547832741895 2020-11-09 02:20:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @StevenBeschloss @bengin1003 We’d all like to know how only trump was removed from ballots. Are all the Republican wins suspect?
1325501669858308099 2020-11-09 02:13:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Rest In Peace.
1325498037184176136 2020-11-09 01:58:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Is he on crack?
1325496792285372417 2020-11-09 01:53:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marcorubio #ExpelRubio not just for his support of domestic terrorism, but for being one of the biggest boobs in Congress. And that’s saying something. #ExpelRubio
1325491703021772806 2020-11-09 01:33:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So good.

1325477701084454913 2020-11-09 00:38:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @MeidasTouch @TRE45ON @marcorubio Scott and DeSantis need to go, too, but this guy publicly supported terrorism against fellow Americans. That cannot stand. #ExpelRubio
1325477353229836289 2020-11-09 00:36:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I refuse to have a terrorist as my representative in Congress. His gleeful support of the highway thugs last week is unacceptable. A 2/3 majority would #ExpelRubio, or he could at least be censured with a simple majority. #ExpelRubio
1325475028469682176 2020-11-09 00:27:27 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’m just fascinated at the way the election was stolen from trump but not all those downballot republicans.

1325331988392325121 2020-11-08 14:59:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is important.
1325331554416156672 2020-11-08 14:57:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Probably sounds silly, but how do you not like these guys?
1325331265277616128 2020-11-08 14:56:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So crazy thrilling- real people. Real, kind, smart people in the White House. Kindness and intelligence to solve problems. Stunning and wonderful. Is there a god after all? .
1325329048977936385 2020-11-08 14:47:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We would not be in this mess if we had Hilary.
1325328356452216833 2020-11-08 14:44:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This all needs to be remembered.
1325328109726535680 2020-11-08 14:43:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @McFaul @NicolleDWallace @JoyAnnReid @maddow I felt like a giant baby, but I was truly terrified of some horrifying outcome. Thank you for suffering through my fear. I can’t quite verbalize my immense relief. The other outcome doesn’t bear thinking of.
1325327023846383616 2020-11-08 14:39:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It was like a horror movie- I couldn’t look. I so felt for all these folks that I love to watch, but I was too sick at heart and frightened of trump pulling his fat out of the fire somehow to watch. Sorry about the ratings, glad to be back. Breathing, and eating, again!

1325325391041622016 2020-11-08 14:32:51 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Agreed- It seems like a smelly cheap motel. Clean it properly!

1325320003541929985 2020-11-08 14:11:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We need to realize what a bullet we just dodged. It’s staggeringly scary- Covid, the planet, human rights- it might have gone the other way. This needs to be addressed.
1325319208348110848 2020-11-08 14:08:17 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Thank you, sir. I believe you are responsible for our salvation. No small feat, and a stunning achievement. Thank you, sir.

1325297501725978624 2020-11-08 12:42:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Most of the people seem to work for the landscape company. I want one of those FSTL T-shirts.
1325295542210080769 2020-11-08 12:34:14 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Me too.
1325293532660314113 2020-11-08 12:26:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> No, that’s in a Winnebago at a rest stop on 95. This is the think tank.
1325291042317488130 2020-11-08 12:16:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Don’t forget the dildo store.

Perhaps you should be reminded that senators are not supposed to admire terrorists trying to harm Americans. Have you got a  Bible verse that covers gleefully supporting willful evil? #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio
1325244517105229824 2020-11-08 09:11:29 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @mmpadellan @BeTrueVoteBlue1 It’s funny how important and comforting it feels to know she’ll be our First Lady. Thrilled.
1325243635290546176 2020-11-08 09:07:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Maybe there is a god.

1325241386191491074 2020-11-08 08:59:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Alone in the world, cut off from our friends and neighbors, we’d be at the mercy of authoritarians like Putin who want to destroy our democracy and take control of our resources. It was close. We need to wake up, wise up, and realize our futures are intertwined. Let’s be friends.
1325241383775563779 2020-11-08 08:59:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I truly hope that trumpers will come to understand the nature of the bullet we just dodged. Seniors would have lost SS, Medicare, and Medicaid; the planet would be decimated, we’d be out of NATO and the WHO, and hundreds of thousands,if not more, would die of Covid.
1325236358294671363 2020-11-08 08:39:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marcorubio And suddenly, supporting domestic terrorism is acceptable for Republican senators. You evil twit.#ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio #ExpelRubio
1325235410696605697 2020-11-08 08:35:18 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why wait? After his vile remarks in support of terrorism on the Texas highway, we should #ExpelRubio. He is an evil, sanctimonious little twit. #ExpelRubio. It would take a 2/3 majority; censure a simple majority. #ExpelRubio.
1325232442769362949 2020-11-08 08:23:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Sorry I was too terrified to watch until today. You all are heroic. Feels good to be watching again.
1325230934719918081 2020-11-08 08:17:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ida_skibenes He was elected on my birthday. I was terrified he’d prevail on my birthday this year. Not many happier or more relieved than I am. Life is good. We must never let this happen again.
1325229566424715266 2020-11-08 08:12:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> These evil, wounded snakes still scare me.
1325229295548190720 2020-11-08 08:11:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> What a bonus! Yay!
1325226928022966272 2020-11-08 08:01:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump Keep talking,#TraitorTot
1325222419750137858 2020-11-08 07:43:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So I’m fascinated. Are the same fake ballots the ones the republicans won on?
1325220425031426049 2020-11-08 07:35:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I wonder if even HE is tired of this jackass.
1325220010718076930 2020-11-08 07:34:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> That dweeb on the right has nothing on you. You’re a wonder. Keep it up, Doc!
1325219590981431296 2020-11-08 07:32:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @realDonaldTrump So all the republicans on those ballots lost too?
1325218860535083008 2020-11-08 07:29:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Funny, she seemed pretty up on trump a lot of the time.
1325218414265327617 2020-11-08 07:27:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And only on the trump part of the ballots? So all those republicans didn’t win either?
1325218161386524674 2020-11-08 07:26:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @NatashaBertrand What a wonderful end to a terrifying week.

1325216179640700928 2020-11-08 07:18:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> That’s adorable.
1325216045565669378 2020-11-08 07:18:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The Four Seasons...Landscaping Company parking lot. You really, really, really can’t make this stuff up.
1325186752051437568 2020-11-08 05:21:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The most frightening parts of a second term would have been that and the further destruction of the planet, and the loss of human rights. We now have a future, and the babies have a future.

1325133652334768128 2020-11-08 01:50:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @MSNBC I’ve missed you all this week, too nervous to watch. I’m going to have you on all day. So glad to be back with you all!
1325131482998861829 2020-11-08 01:42:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Don’t worry- we’ll be bitching about The Biden administration soon enough. We ARE Americans, after all!

1323323231093346309 2020-11-03 01:56:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Really, it just doesn’t bode well for an administration to be unable to wrangle a couple thousand people.
1323322924347101184 2020-11-03 01:55:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And can’t read either one of them.
1323322726543695874 2020-11-03 01:54:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Enough to die for him, apparently.
1323321554021867527 2020-11-03 01:50:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @joncoopertweets @RobertCooper58 Does anybody else wonder if these trumpers will ever look back on the videos and feel shame and/or remorse?

1323320712556400647 2020-11-03 01:46:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Doesn’t need too much investigation. Millions of us have seen the video. And that of shutting down the Garden State Parkway, also highly illegal, I’m guessing. And ...

1323302683437092867 2020-11-03 00:35:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marcorubio You should be banned in and sanctioned by Florida, you vile hypocrite. This is what passes for Christian behavior in trumpworld. Incitement to violence and physical harm to one’s fellow humans? You disgust me. #ExpelRubio
1323301907675361286 2020-11-03 00:32:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #ExpelRubio. This vile, fake Christian is endorsing violence. A sitting member of Congress. I am DONE with these evil jerks.
1323300982009286656 2020-11-03 00:28:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Rubio needs to be expelled. Censured at the very least. This is criminal. #ExpelRubio
1323300253991391232 2020-11-03 00:25:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I know we’re all a little busy right now, but if you have a minute, call his Florida office at 813-853-1099 and leave a message. DC number is 202-224-3041. I believe he should be expelled, which would take a 2/3 majority, but maybe after election? At least censure (majority).
1323299277721010183 2020-11-03 00:21:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @mkraju @adatukas Call rubio’s office in Florida (813) 853-1099 and leave a message. Then, let’s look into censure and/ or expulsion for these criminal comments from him.
1323298206483206144 2020-11-03 00:17:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He needs to be expelled. Censured at the very least.
1323297677669474305 2020-11-03 00:15:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why wait? Censure or expulsion.
1323297522996158464 2020-11-03 00:14:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Censure or expulsion. Why wait 2 years?
1323297331844927494 2020-11-03 00:14:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Censure takes a majority. Expulsion 2/3. Maybe we can get rid of Rubio after the election.

1323295881400078338 2020-11-03 00:08:18 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Impeached or recalled

1323294502350704640 2020-11-03 00:02:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Impeach him. I refuse to have an abettor to violence be my representative.

1323282877036060676 2020-11-02 23:16:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> At least 700 souls have died for trump’s ego. And that’s just the last few weeks.

1323275151421722627 2020-11-02 22:45:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Doesn’t it seem that an administration that can’t organize a couple thousand people is a poor bet for an entire nation?
1323274712143847425 2020-11-02 22:44:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Possible ray of hope is that I read transition contingency activities are actually underway. Sign of civilized behavior.

1323273933920079873 2020-11-02 22:41:05 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @marcorubio Last I checked, followers of Christ didn’t promote violence against their fellow humans. Pro-life? I think not, you vile, shameless hypocrite. Recall or impeachment should be in your future, scumbag.
1323272993351602176 2020-11-02 22:37:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Can we impeach or recall this Bible-quoting piece of pond scum?

1323272071737212931 2020-11-02 22:33:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Of course, he’s a bit compromised, having received his own fake election.
1323271778421137409 2020-11-02 22:32:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Excellent question. Easy answer.

1323065885687533568 2020-11-02 08:54:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I actually think even Putin is tired of trump’s noise and ignorance.

1323036430227120128 2020-11-02 06:57:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> There need to be arrests. These dangerous thugs need to be stopped. Why is this tolerated and not a criminal act?

1322299666080387077 2020-10-31 06:09:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> “Virtually Nobody” is important to trump.
1322298938104467458 2020-10-31 06:06:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It appears he must just enjoy screwing with these poor schmucks.  They’re freezing, frying, and getting sick to stroke his fragile ego, and he has no converts. The same old Grateful Soon-to-be-Dead following him around because they have nothing else to do.
1322298078183960577 2020-10-31 06:03:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Excellent.
1322297540809760774 2020-10-31 06:01:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Trumpers should be advised that trump will treat them with exactly the same “respect” he paid McSally when they are no longer useful. What a great man.
1322296717052698624 2020-10-31 05:57:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And they’re “virtually nobody”. WAKE UP, TRUMPERS!

1321980729585213441 2020-10-30 09:02:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’m never going to understand how trump was allowed to run. He was a confidential informant; the feds knew he was a crook tied to  the Mob and Russian mob. Not to mention he knows nothing about the Constitution or American history, and couldn’t pass a civics test. What gives?

1321246171449446400 2020-10-28 08:23:29 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It’s always depressing when you see that the wealthiest among us have no good reason to be so. Stupidity rewarded is tough to take, especially when the dough is earned from nothing but idle celebrity.  https://t.co/LgNeoQ2QNz
1321245420325130241 2020-10-28 08:20:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He won’t need the deplorables anymore. He already called them disgusting- do they think they’ll be spared?

1321244774041559042 2020-10-28 08:17:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Is she the real one or the fake one.? Hard to tell.

1321242313667059713 2020-10-28 08:08:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is believable. He’s addicted to the cult adulation, and he can’t play an instrument.
1321241904009400320 2020-10-28 08:06:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Yes they do, which is why we need Joe Biden.
1321241581308022784 2020-10-28 08:05:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Wonder how happy those towns are to get the death rallies, and whether he pays his bills.
1321241072048230400 2020-10-28 08:03:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He doesn’t serve anyone. Unless it’s like the Twilight Zone episode when “To Serve Man” was the name of the alien cookbook.
1321239407840681986 2020-10-28 07:56:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Nor the Apprentice
1321215828805734401 2020-10-28 06:22:55 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Hard to say, although they keep playing YMCA at trump’s death rallies.
1321215335727595520 2020-10-28 06:20:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why is it always the trumpers that misbehave? We libtard snowflakes are ever so much nicer. What’s not to like?
1321214738148265985 2020-10-28 06:18:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Amy_Siskind I noticed some neighbors’ Biden yard signs gone this morning. Sad truth- 99% of bad behavior is perpetrated by trumpers. Happily, they had new ones later today. Another contribution to the cause, I’m guessing.
1321213797605036034 2020-10-28 06:14:50 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @RudyGiuliani @realDonaldTrump Probably just your new girlfriend’s first period.

1320560529530851329 2020-10-26 10:58:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> If Barrett had a sense of ethics she would have refused the process til after election. She also doesn’t seem all that bright, exposing her kids to trump and his House o’ Covid.
1320559892600639489 2020-10-26 10:56:27 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @EricTopol @kurteichenwald That’s #26 for today.
1320556300015685632 2020-10-26 10:42:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This should be shouted from the rooftops. No one stresses enough that professionals track disease and this should NEVER have gotten to this point. Playbook and personnel were in place, but trump crowd too busy being stupid and greedy.

1320551880427266048 2020-10-26 10:24:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Saw a Federalist TV ad tonight. They’re coming out in the open. Pay attention.

1319825816390422528 2020-10-24 10:19:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Trump is stroking himself and his fragile ego twice a day with these indecent spreader events. He’s leaving a murderous trail of death and disease, all in service to his weak little mind. Keep talking, ms. Ingraham. Convince yourself you have a soul.
1319781822608322560 2020-10-24 07:24:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @govkristinoem So everybody’s allowed to smoke anywhere they want? And food handlers don’t have to wash their hands? Probably no hairnets, and cats and dogs in the kitchens? Sounds like a lovely place you’ve got there. Ick. You are a moron.

1319057620393742336 2020-10-22 07:26:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @TeamPelosi It seems odd that a president impeached for blackmail, openly requesting assistance to cheat, and owing hundreds of millions, if not over a billion dollars to unknown overseas lenders, should be allowed to run for re-election.

He sold it in ‘96 for $1.2 million.

1317950582662008832 2020-10-19 06:07:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> There is a tragic dearth of reporting on trump’s relationship to other people’s money. Forbes says he’s probably over $1,000,000,000 in debt. Can you imagine the leverage some could have over him? The ones who know his lies? You couldn’t be hired to mow the WH lawn at a fraction.

1317940560695578632 2020-10-19 05:28:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Is that because the GOP is petitioning the Supreme Court to destroy the ACA, including the pre-existing conditions clause, with nothing better to offer after12 years?
1317939812444364802 2020-10-19 05:25:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> When are they going to look into the very credible reporting of trump’s rapes of children?

1317938761855078400 2020-10-19 05:21:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> There’s quite a bit of credible reporting about his rape of children. When you see his ugly behavior toward opponents, it’s easy to believe the most vile stories.
1317936409634885632 2020-10-19 05:11:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’m always concerned about how trumpers will raise their children. Do they teach them to be transactional? To lie? To whine and cheat? Hope they hire nice nannies to raise them.

1317677818512314369 2020-10-18 12:04:07 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We know trump embraces anyone who likes him. The GOP are even scarier-they were supposed to be smarter than him. They’re all nuts. Get rid of them.

1316896634316402695 2020-10-16 08:19:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Chuck Todd is political director, so he set this up FOR trump.
1316893594083643392 2020-10-16 08:07:54 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> How about ordering the U.S. Marshalls to murder a suspect?

1316889503831871491 2020-10-16 07:51:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Can’t help but wonder if nbc hopes he’ll go down in flames on their air. Great scoop.

1316762380953686016 2020-10-15 23:26:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Just Barrett will do. Although trump might get confused and lose interest, thinking you mean “Barron”.
1316761867709222912 2020-10-15 23:24:28 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Producers and directors turned him into a “successful businessman.” #BoycottNBC

1316603885558132736 2020-10-15 12:56:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @pookiee0758 Right now the media is kind of on the shit list, unfortunately. I’m the dinosaur that reads my local paper every day, and I’m losing respect.

1316599795964932099 2020-10-15 12:40:27 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Ratings are the ONLY thing trump cares about. TURN ON ABC!
1316599460441534464 2020-10-15 12:39:07 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #BoycottNBC And turn on ABC! No ratings for trump.
1316598621236797440 2020-10-15 12:35:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> They’re giving him some kinds of happy juice, aren’t they? Drugs and shots of oxygen?

1316595399025721344 2020-10-15 12:22:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The irony isn’t lost on me that I wish there was no money in campaigns, but that I’m thrilled to hear Joe has tons of it. The ultimate symbol of success.
1316593563074023424 2020-10-15 12:15:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It’s way beyond that. Their official position appears to be that herd immunity is the solution. Probably the Final Solution.

1316575409409085440 2020-10-15 11:03:33 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @CoryBooker @criteria681 Barrett pretends she doesn’t know this. Is she perjuring herself? If so, can she be charged, or will it be like all the rest of the Republicans, like Kavanaugh and Barr, who lied and got away with it. Wish the Democrats were craftier.
1316574663317880832 2020-10-15 11:00:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Doesn’t sound like much of a “judge” when the outcome is preordained.

1316573659188912128 2020-10-15 10:56:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> They didn’t account for TV shows chasing ratings, however. You played a part, as did people like Howard Stern, Letterman, Fallon, and others who presented him as an amusing buffoon, but gave him oxygen and notoriety. His celebrity is key to his success.

1316558170458918914 2020-10-15 09:55:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I think he was worried until he realized they said “Barron”, not “Barrett”. Then, no.

He has no interest whatsoever in serving the American people. Never had, never will. Give it up and vote for a sentient human being who actually cares about us.

Mitch giggling about the 215,000 dead should be all they need to know. Then again, it’s been 36 years of negligent homicide they keep voting for, so...
1316082895505756160 2020-10-14 02:26:28 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> How can anyone possibly say the meaning of the Constitution hasn’t changed over time? The only people with rights were white men. Most of life today revolves around things that didn’t exist.

1316048557976289280 2020-10-14 00:10:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This sounds great, but state polls are more reflective of reality. Still, Biden’s doing well, but we can’t relax our vigilance against the cheating. Trump is desperate and dangerous. Lots of scumbags around him.
1316047809964015616 2020-10-14 00:07:03 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This scumbag has enriched himself and his wife on the backs of Kentuckians for 36 years. They are some of the poorest, sickest, worst educated people on the planet. Now he’s laughing at their suffering. Get rid of him.

1315811119005601793 2020-10-13 08:26:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> 35 years he’s been enriching himself and his wife, while Kentuckians get poorer, sicker, and worse-educated. Kind of a shithole state. Sorry.

1315160713548230656 2020-10-11 13:22:03 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> She’s just another vile right wing trumper. Wonder where SHE came from?
1315160132330946560 2020-10-11 13:19:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The trump administration is nothing more than a terrorist organization. By any definition. Especially as they recruit in America.
1315159087382966272 2020-10-11 13:15:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Is it 3 out of 4 RNC Finance directors indicted, and DeJoy probably next? And who paid the 400 today? Better not be me.

1315155232616218625 2020-10-11 13:00:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @LincolnsBible Popular media legitimized trump, treating him like an amusing buffoon. Howard Stern, Joe and Mika, David Letterman come to mind as popularizers. They may have been naive about his chances, but they’ve never addressed their roles in his populist rise. We didn’t take him seriously.
1315153855223652354 2020-10-11 12:54:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @LincolnsBible I first became aware of trump’s Confidential Informant status through Lincoln’s Bible. The Feds seem to take the protection very seriously, not outing his cooperation regardless of his other criminality. Still can’t believe someone like this is allowed to run for President.

1315111512768499713 2020-10-11 10:06:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @MNPREVALLET7 Apparently they could only afford 400.
1315111188850765824 2020-10-11 10:05:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Yeah- Love me some smarmy, oily sycophants. Is Mother at all discomfited by the way he gazes adoringly at trump? You know what they say about protesting too much. He might be as much of a #ProudBoys fan as his favorite president.  https://t.co/98PnJUie8K

1315058914736603143 2020-10-11 06:37:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @thebr0keb0i When he actually tried to blame the Gold Star families for his infection, because they love him so much they need to be too close to him. The truth being, of course, that he is the source of multiple infections, including melanoma, Hicks, Christie, staff. Not a word of concern.

1315046361214136322 2020-10-11 05:47:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> If they’re not shouting about him being negative, he’s positive. Their refusal to talk about the last negative/positive test dates convinces me he was positive for the debate, and knew it. He and his enablers are pond scum. Apologies to pond scum.

1315045274834931719 2020-10-11 05:43:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The good news is there were 400 instead of 2000. Small favors.
1315043608760811526 2020-10-11 05:36:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Apparently about 1600 were smart enough not to go to 1600.

1315042307318730753 2020-10-11 05:31:33 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Anyone not voting for Biden is voting for trump. If you don’t totally agree with Biden, you have a pretty good shot at making changes in 4 years. If trump gets 4 more years, he will ruin the world. Make a responsible choice.

1314732055243218948 2020-10-10 08:58:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> How quickly do they get their results? I gather the rapid tests are not that accurate. I took a test on 9/11 and still have no results. Quick, easy and free, but seems kind of pointless. Good thing I didn’t actually feel sick.
1314727755242762242 2020-10-10 08:41:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Some changes need to be made.

1314361587642306560 2020-10-09 08:26:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @SethAbramson Another insane story that will largely go unread in the midst of all the other daily insanity. Doctors abide by Hippocratic oath. This is gross.

1314011721099603971 2020-10-08 09:16:22 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Don’t trumpers know that he wants to end the payroll tax, which funds most of SS? GOP wants to eliminate Medicare and Medicaid, and, of course, the ACA. Why do they want to shoot themselves, and the rest of us, in the foot? Not having it. I paid for it. Pissed off.
1314006732763471874 2020-10-08 08:56:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Ed McGinty’s  known as Winterway. The trump remover. Look him up.
1314006048588673024 2020-10-08 08:53:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Ed McGinty of the Villages in Florida. He was his own lonely outpost among the trump golf cart coots. If reporting is true tonight, he’s a big man in that town. They may have flipped.

1313971774355316737 2020-10-08 06:37:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Until they prove otherwise, I believe trump was infected at the debate. He was certainly overheated and acting like he had Covid brain fog.
1313970957699166211 2020-10-08 06:34:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’m lucky enough to live in a fairly Biden place, where trump signs are in a great minority. When he ran against Hilary, I hesitated. Too many trumpers are inclined to nasty behaviors that Democrats simply are not. Democrats are not tire slashers. There’s a difference. Sad.
1313969617652666373 2020-10-08 06:29:03 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Oh, no. Please don’t let trump be president if this makes further inroads. Please.

1313960263012540418 2020-10-08 05:51:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This reminds me that trump never really laughs, nor does anyone in his orbit. Look at clips of Joe and Jill,  Kamala and Doug, the Obamas, the Clintons, the Bushes. All laugh freely and often. Weird, isn’t it? No joy in Mudville. What a miserable crew.

1313148648918790145 2020-10-06 00:06:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @waltshaub Hope her baby and husband are okay.
1313148193417424898 2020-10-06 00:05:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> All campaign ads are, by nature, negative. Get all ads out there and make appearances. Carefully.
1313147814000627712 2020-10-06 00:03:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I think it’s a lot more than that.

1313136672012406789 2020-10-05 23:19:14 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> You might like the #ProudBoys. Trump does!  https://t.co/rS3LUXcYxa
1313132087910727684 2020-10-05 23:01:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> There are so many  outrages and daily crises that we sometimes lose long range sight. Can we even imagine a second term for the genocidal maniac in chief with no strictures? It’s a dystopic, nightmare scenario we must not let happen.

1313114371657289730 2020-10-05 21:50:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I can’t help wondering if he purposely went late to the debate and lied about being tested. He may very well have been ill. He certainly looked and acted overheated. There seems to be a distinct lack of interest in contact tracing. Timing is everything. Did he know?
1312947970271252480 2020-10-05 10:49:24 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Sounds like a #ProudBoy  https://t.co/j3x0set7UT

1312946400980852737 2020-10-05 10:43:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> From what I’m seeing about dexamethasone, he should be separated from the codes.
1312946098475020288 2020-10-05 10:41:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So sorry.

1312906319691689984 2020-10-05 08:03:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> In the words of Ted Cruz, for trump “ morality does not exist”. “We are staring into the abyss”. Remember that, Raphael? Lindsey? Marco? You are vile.

1312903822143037441 2020-10-05 07:53:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’m no doctor, but that has to be a gigantic lie, or people at Walter Reed should be losing their licenses.

1312899141031391238 2020-10-05 07:35:22 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Apparently, most of these trump fans are #ProudBoys. Isn’t that sweet?  https://t.co/kYSJLJLVus

1312883455261315072 2020-10-05 06:33:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> How about the Secret Service? Is this not an illegal act because of Covid protocols? I want an answer. Somebody?
1312883109726244865 2020-10-05 06:31:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ElizLanders @CraigRozniecki Is this not an illegal act at this time?

1312882281556725760 2020-10-05 06:28:22 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @shereenskee When exactly did he sign all those blank sheets for the photo op?
1312881973468200961 2020-10-05 06:27:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> If his giant ass is out joyriding, he is getting no break. On anything.
1312881674070429697 2020-10-05 06:25:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> How many Secret Service employees will quit over being forced to abet trump’s vile and seemingly illegal act today? Illegal is supposed to be the line not crossed. Not feeling a lot of confidence in that rule now.
1312880242248364035 2020-10-05 06:20:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Bloody time.
1312880063583588354 2020-10-05 06:19:33 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @duty2warn Do you suppose the Secret Service has a name for trump’s grotesque stunt in front of the hospital?
1312879457124974594 2020-10-05 06:17:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Swipes?! Should have been forbidden. And SS should have refused illegal order. Doesn’t bode well.
1312878459685928960 2020-10-05 06:13:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Double down, Joe- we need to rid ourselves of this vile monster, and you and Kamala are the ones to lead the charge. Nice play is over . Get out there and speak to all of us, as much as possible. And get the meanest ads back out there. He is evil.
1312877501174161408 2020-10-05 06:09:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I think this constitutes an illegal act, which should have been refused. Have they lost their bleeding minds?
1312877136252985345 2020-10-05 06:07:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DebraMessing @DrDenaGrayson So much for observing the hospital zone. Or do they not have those anymore? What a murderous, self-absorbed ass. This is unbearable. He has to go away.
1312875983435898880 2020-10-05 06:03:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Would this stunt not be an illegal order to the Secret Service? Why are they doing this?

The planet’s daily degradation, racial injustice, cruelty to immigrants...it’s endless, and so hard to know where the day’s focus should be. This is untenable. It needs to stop. Yesterday.
1312854557362458625 2020-10-05 04:38:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @realDonaldTrump I was reminded that responsible, nice people observe a quiet zone around hospitals. There are many other patients, some in immediate peril, who could be disturbed by these rude, thoughtless boobs. Big surprise they don’t know how to act.
1312853683701514242 2020-10-05 04:34:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Beautiful- I hope he stays very much in the public eye. People need to hear his decency, and his actual plans. Get out there, Joe- CAREFULLY!

1312540302662610944 2020-10-04 07:49:28 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Kind of got the feeling he was calling Hopey a slut, hugging all those uniforms, as he tried to get her and lots of American service people under that bus. Looks to me like HE’s the spreader.
1312538033934139392 2020-10-04 07:40:27 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Yeah, liberate Wisconsin!
1312537296814501888 2020-10-04 07:37:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Think about 210,000+ Americans dead due to the negligence and stupidity of trump and the GOP, destroyed immigrant families, right wing violence; lying, criminality, and corruption. Tax evasion, bounties on our military, betrayal of our allies, economic disaster...shall I go on?
1312531690305150976 2020-10-04 07:15:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Paging a double digit IQ! STAT!
1312530973364424706 2020-10-04 07:12:24 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @sharkyrae @AviFlyGirl I haven’t noticed anyone globally but the Bidens and the Obamas wishing him well. Is that possible?
1312530527304310784 2020-10-04 07:10:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JenGranholm @MBDanielson Just the thought of these guys prepping trump to debate gives me the willies. Chris, Rudy, Stephen- that’s a real Mensa meeting.
1312529681321664513 2020-10-04 07:07:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @loribelle74 @icecreamonacone @DrEricDing @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @JoeBiden @KamalaHarris I simply do not comprehend why everything can’t be done with remote video. Every news program and talk show has adapted to this. This is 2020- we do not need to be in the same room!
1312528257015668736 2020-10-04 07:01:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> As has become apparent, the quality of the testing is paramount. We’ve learned that the rapid test we think we want is not reliable, and that Republicans think if you get tested once it means you’re virus-free...forever? As opposed to until you meet up with someone contagious.
1312525666907115520 2020-10-04 06:51:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Staggering. Some of these people are innocent bystanders. Some are criminally negligent.
1312522939275780096 2020-10-04 06:40:28 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Barr refuse to quarantine; Grassley refuses to be tested. They are supposed to be our servants. Why is this allowed to continue? I think their paychecks should be stopped until they comply with law.
1312522408079708164 2020-10-04 06:38:22 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @tylerpager @4everNeverTrump This is tragic, and tells us all we need to know about both men.
1312521669974487044 2020-10-04 06:35:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @RyanLizza @Mcvictoria5Mcg Is there a (low) IQ test to be a Republican?
1312520304762077184 2020-10-04 06:30:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Apparently death threats are okay for everyone but Republicans. Go figure.
1312518811644436481 2020-10-04 06:24:04 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Amy is a stellar Senator, but here she stuns with inspiring ferocity.
1312506261057929218 2020-10-04 05:34:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why do they need to be in the same room? Or state? Video has been invented. I don’t get it.
1312503490715897856 2020-10-04 05:23:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> When did the GOP change from the party of small government and fiscal conservancy to the party of the criminally stupid?

1312499732690862080 2020-10-04 05:08:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Can anyone explain why the debates have to “be” anywhere other than the candidates homes or a studio? James Corden interviews people on a big screen. Sheesh.
1312498040763084800 2020-10-04 05:01:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Dear Canada- Please take me. I know how to spell “herd” and am a thousandaire.
1312493365989003264 2020-10-04 04:42:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Sherrillacyr12 I was thinking watching his vicious demeanor Tuesday night that I could hear him saying the things the 13 year old recounted in her rape accusation. Made me shudder.

1312450820613394433 2020-10-04 01:53:54 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @amandalitman And somehow we STILL elected him senator. Sheesh.

1312439547922321408 2020-10-04 01:09:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ProjectLincoln After the Obamas’ gracious get well message, trump campaign put out Lyin’ Obama Phony Kamala fundraising email. No reason to be  accommodating to these vile dopes.
1312438820353183746 2020-10-04 01:06:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ProjectLincoln All campaign ads are inherently negative. No reason to stop campaigning. His removal is even more important- he knowingly endangers people.
1312437014151610368 2020-10-04 00:59:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> They’re using trump’s words- not false or hateful, so, NO. Sorry when someone falls ill, but it doesnot change any of the reasons to get rid of him.
1312414208328376321 2020-10-03 23:28:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @shannonrwatts To be fair, Rick Scott’s focus as a healthcare executive was on the Medicare fraud side, not the actual healthcare. Mostly stealing, not test results.
1312413147630886914 2020-10-03 23:24:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He and trump are in the same Mensa group.
1312412881082875909 2020-10-03 23:23:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Rick Scott seems similarly confused. Says he tested positive. Apparently meant negative. Why do they all seem so criminally stupid?
1312412285202292738 2020-10-03 23:20:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @AshleyPerry2020 Especially since she had Covid- unknown how survivors shed  the virus.
1312411240539529216 2020-10-03 23:16:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @A_RebelPatriot @midwestmomts Anybody lip-read?

1312258378186489859 2020-10-03 13:09:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> When Inauguration comes around, and trump refuses to leave, they’ll probably enjoy that last little chore of escorting him out.
1312257419024707584 2020-10-03 13:05:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DearAuntCrabby And trump’s remarks about Hicks being friendly to those in uniform? Is little Hopey a slut, don? Is that how she gave you Covid? I have a feeling she/they got it from HIM. He%seems fitting a lot of people under that bus.
1312254344616726528 2020-10-03 12:53:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Honor system? The trump clan? Oxymoron. Emphasis on the moron.

1312253428928782343 2020-10-03 12:49:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @joncoopertweets @NathanLerner Honestly, it’s almost always Republicans. What has happened to these jamokes?
1312253095498387456 2020-10-03 12:48:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Most assuredly. I live in Florida, where DeSantis has just thrown open the doors. Unfortunately, a lot of restaurants will see backlash- most of us old coots will avoid 100% capacity.
1312251330090676225 2020-10-03 12:41:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DanRather He’s endangered national security, yet again, with his colossal stupidity and arrogance. How many will have to quarantine as he spewed his germs? Ick.
1312250279589556224 2020-10-03 12:37:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @chrislhayes And wasn’t that an illegal gathering?
1312249693989150720 2020-10-03 12:34:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> No great words, just terribly sorry.
1312249102508404736 2020-10-03 12:32:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @tonyschwartz And Barrett, for that matter. She should have been advised she could be a spreader.
1312248747867484160 2020-10-03 12:30:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Naturally, Biden is dropping what are considered negative ads, while trump’s campaign will continue their march to untruth. Remembering the viciousness of trump when Hilary got pneumonia.Too bad trump is ill, but it doesn’t change his cruelty and authoritarianism. He must go.
1312230380502683649 2020-10-03 11:17:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @samstein It would be ugly.

1312224353195560961 2020-10-03 10:54:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why in hell don’t they do these things with split screen remotes, the way every bloody news and talk show is conducted now? It would eliminate the crosstalk. No travel, no illness, no interrupting.  No problem.
1312214576876773376 2020-10-03 10:15:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Are these people on crack?

1312032506066149382 2020-10-02 22:11:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And Nancy!
1312032203359031297 2020-10-02 22:10:28 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Sifill_LDF I saw that Tuesday night. Trump”s entourage should have complied or been escorted out. That was inexcusable behavior. Which was excused. At the Cleveland Clinic, for Christ’s sakes.
1312029609651777538 2020-10-02 22:00:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> At least we know trump goes nowhere  near kids. There’s that.
1312027952159350784 2020-10-02 21:53:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> If only someone else had been President. This did not need to happen to this extent. Devastating.
1312021773609730048 2020-10-02 21:29:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @maydaymindy9 He brings out the skeptic in us.

1311910701561192448 2020-10-02 14:07:40 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is why we don’t trust the information, and sympathy is lacking- because he has no concern for the health of people with whom he comes in contact.

1311908408128425984 2020-10-02 13:58:33 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why does trump and Melanoma having Covid make me suspicious and nervous? Could this postpone the election or somehow work to his advantage? I don’t like it.
1311905221510131713 2020-10-02 13:45:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> More.
1311904654385704960 2020-10-02 13:43:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So far, 209,000+people and their families did not get through this together. Your husband is a deeply stupid and malevolent man who has put even more around him at risk for days. Wise up.

1311890140684529664 2020-10-02 12:45:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It affects virtually nobody. This is fine.

1311521624131284996 2020-10-01 12:21:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Now that trump is screwing with mail ballots, please try to vote in person- early- especially if your area has paper ballots marked in ink. Or take your ballot to a polling place if possible. We have to cross all tees- BE CAREFUL. Make sure your vote counts.

1311507442887471104 2020-10-01 11:25:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He could help “fund” the police by paying taxes, but he prefers to let white supremacists work for free. If he doesn’t know who white supremacists are, as he contended to Chris Cuomo a while back, then he is truly too stupid to be president, and/or someone should be fired.
1311504848559517696 2020-10-01 11:14:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> At the Cleveland Clinic, for Christ’s sake. That was an agreed-upon provision. It set the tone-the trump cohort should have complied with the rules or been escorted out, as should their leader have been. Inexcusable behavior.

1311471337442082816 2020-10-01 09:01:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @CaslerNoel @realDonaldTrump When you see his irrational, uncontrolled anger, as we did last night, you can see his behavior as described by the little girl who said he raped her. Staggering.

1311468099456114688 2020-10-01 08:48:55 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Trump’s people must surely number military among their families. Some must have experienced some connection to Covid. If his contempt for them and his lies haven’t bothered them yet, will his grotesque performance last night offend them?
1311463469628166145 2020-10-01 08:30:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> A nominee with integrity would wait until after the election.
1311462685234659328 2020-10-01 08:27:24 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @NorahODonnell @CBSNews @CBSEveningNews I knew it was over when they allowed the trump people to remove their masks. The wearing of masks was a requirement both sides agreed to. Tells you everything, doesn’t it? Incapable of mature interaction.
1311460509909159937 2020-10-01 08:18:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> How will they enforce other rules? Most of trump’s family and guests removed their masks, at THE CLEVELAND CLINIC! They were supposedly required. They were offered, and refused, replacement masks. They should have been escorted out. What is wrong with everyone?
1311453670538719233 2020-10-01 07:51:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @briantylercohen @CBSNews There needs to be a fact checker. Trump lied and lied as he trampled the rules.
1311453264261591040 2020-10-01 07:49:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Was this a problem before trump?

1311441249837121536 2020-10-01 07:02:14 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> They should also turn it off when it’s his turn. Torn between wanting Biden to tell him to take a hike, and letting trump show what a vile and petulant moron he is.

1311171013804208134 2020-09-30 13:08:24 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Not only didn’t condemn, EXHORTED the proud boys to “stand back and stand by”- now their new call to arms on social media.
1311170289645096961 2020-09-30 13:05:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It was kind of Chris Wallace’s fault. Being a moderator is a “thing”. Grade school teacher would have handled it better. Nonetheless, trump ruined yet another civilized  Democratic tradition, like the moronic bully he is.

1311095470974959616 2020-09-30 08:08:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @IngrahamAngle You seem illiterate. Also, Biden is a doddering old goat; a brilliant debater; a drugged up genius who can seamlessly repeat verbal gems fed through an earpiece; a cheater privy to the questions who has brilliantly memorized perfect answers. Which, exactly is it?
1311093542471831559 2020-09-30 08:00:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Maybe someday someone will be able to explain the dogged devotion of people for whom he has utter contempt, and in fact threatens harm. The ACA, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid- he wants all those lifelines cut to the ones who need them most and whom he professes to love.
1311089986016608258 2020-09-30 07:46:26 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is not a forum of ideologies or policies; a debate about the vagaries of one political approach over another. Trump believes in absolutely nothing. Nothing at all.

1310952155264815104 2020-09-29 22:38:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I remember being unsettled by Cawthorn’s appearance at trump’s DC hotel with Graham,Meadows and others, unmasked and talking and laughing into each other’s faces. He seemed like a real ass.

1310691965277790208 2020-09-29 05:24:50 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Apropos of almost nothing, but our news refers to the opening of strip clubs as “gentlemen’s” clubs, which, unfortunately, tells us a lot about our sexual mores.

1310689019232215041 2020-09-29 05:13:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @fred_guttenberg Near as I can tell, there should BE no campaign. The national security emergency alone precludes him being allowed to remain. We’re focusing on his contempt for America when we should be getting him away from the Oval Office. Immediately.

This is early reporting- his debt is probably far higher, and we don’t know to whom it’s owed, or what he might do or have done to ameliorate his obligations.

1310458961682771969 2020-09-28 13:58:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And this time the information is much more recent-no statute of limitations on it like the last report they did.

1310457278110330882 2020-09-28 13:52:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @SarahLongwell25 And the contested refund of $72,000,000 is more like $100,000,000 with interest. That’s just for openers. He owes something like $400,000,000 in the next few years. How could anyone think this dope should stay in office?
1310456380592140288 2020-09-28 13:48:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> What really needs to be stressed to trumpers is the debt figure. He is thoroughly compromised by owing so much money internationally. All policy is suspect. Who knows what kind of deals he’s trying to make?
1310454851126669312 2020-09-28 13:42:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He’s scum, but the debt is the scary part.

In light of Mary Trump’s lawsuit against trump, I imagine there might be some more interesting details forthcoming. It fleshes out what most of us knew- he’s a cheating scumbag.
1310444398765801474 2020-09-28 13:01:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The NYTimes article was written by Russ Buettner, Susanne Craig, and Mike McIntyre. Susanne Craig, at least, was part of the original crew that investigated his financials in ‘18, I think it was, based largely on Mary Trump’s documents.
1310437477983948800 2020-09-28 12:33:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He’s so broke he has to buy his KFC on layaway.

Never mind the everyday lack of humanity, how do millions of broke, sick Americans help the Republican agenda? Who’s going to prop up their wealth? Who will clean the pool?

Is there some logic that escapes us libtards, or is it true you just consider us subhuman, and fun to torture?

1310030480901836801 2020-09-27 09:36:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JoshuaMZeitz The assault is NOT on Catholicism, as you well know. The assault is on needless cruelty and hypocrisy.
1310029999802638337 2020-09-27 09:34:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Planned Parenthood has played a large part in the drop in abortions by promoting birth control, and provides health care to men as well. If you really want to stop abortion, devise new methods of prevention, and maybe require men get vasectomies. They can reverse it at will.
1310028658741043200 2020-09-27 09:29:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why are we hearing so little about this? This is getting old.

1310011006484176897 2020-09-27 08:18:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This nonsense needs to stop right now. Barrett’s Catholicism is so obviously not the issue as to be laughable. I’m a woman who grew up Catholic, and has the guilt to prove it. She exhibits precious little of what I would call Catholic principles. Joe Biden seems Catholic to me.

1308914475664318464 2020-09-24 07:41:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Endgame2021 35 years of enriching himself and his wife, while keeping his knee on the necks of Kentuckians, who rank at the bottom for health, wellness, and education. Wake up!

I just read a tweet that said trump’s efforts against health care are a myth. See Supreme Court.

Looks like they’re going to elect him again. The rest of us need to gain control of the Senate and neuter him

1307535403143049216 2020-09-20 12:21:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Can’t wait to see the ass-end of this vile, murderous fool. This should be an impeachable offense, if not criminal. Is it true that a judicial appointment can’t be made if there’s an impeachment going on?
1307534274049060864 2020-09-20 12:17:18 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We should keep impeaching him to keep the Senate from being able to vote on a judge.
1307533791335010304 2020-09-20 12:15:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ryanstruyk @gtconway3d Underreported. Probably many more.

1307523635037511681 2020-09-20 11:35:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @mmpadellan He’s had his heel on the neck of Kentucky for 35 years. He’s enriched himself and his wife at the expense of some of the poorest, sickest, worst educated people in the country. Wake the hell up, Kentucky.
1307522011997011969 2020-09-20 11:28:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> He almost out-trumps trump. I’ll never understand how this evil crook got elected Governor AND senator after the biggest Medicare fraud on record. Vile creep.

1307167610186981378 2020-09-19 12:00:18 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump And, of course, the virus is a hoax, but there are more than a few little ones among the 200,000 dead for which he is responsible.
1307152384435593216 2020-09-19 10:59:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I don’t care for the artwork, but the nurse/victim apparently wasn’t too offended on that day of celebration to be grabbed and kissed by an exuberant, drunken sailor. I’m just glad he wasn’t any happier- she might have been raped. I wish Buchanan had bigger battles to address.
1307152372037279745 2020-09-19 10:59:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Congressman Buchanan seems to think it should be kept in its prominent spot to honor our military, yet has nothing to say about trump’s contempt for our fallen, who he calls losers and suckers, and is further silent about Putin’s bounties on our troops.
1307146556508901376 2020-09-19 10:36:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @GarrettHaake Can you, or anyone, explain the significance to trumpers of YMCA? Do they know it’s gay?

1306786680947474435 2020-09-18 10:46:38 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Somehow, I have no doubt that he said that. Or any of the awful things he’s accused of saying about our military heroes. We’ve heard him. We know who he is. I’m sick to death of this evil man.

1306717573476737026 2020-09-18 06:12:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I think trump ought to be up front in any American history class he wants to establish. When they were passing out brains, he thought they said “trains”, and he said he didn’t want any.

He’s ready to kill up to 6,000,000, based on his newest Fox non-science advisor’s hope that getting infected once means you’re immune for life. The last person to talk to trump that has the right look and an easy way out.
1306612095610433539 2020-09-17 23:12:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump That’s funny. Seems to me the Republicans usually run the economy down, and Democrats fix it. Read a book.

Of course, trump will stop having people around him tested, and he’ll stop taking whatever it is that keeps him non-Covid. And, of course, it’s kind of a crapshoot whether it actually gives you lasting immunity, but...

1304272352776257536 2020-09-11 12:15:35 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @michpoligal I was going to say that some people have all the luck, but I expect that’s not helpful.
1304271933287141377 2020-09-11 12:13:55 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @PauletteParis1 @NotifyNYC Flyover? Are they on crack?
1304268141569224710 2020-09-11 11:58:51 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @CREWcrew #8,036 reason to investigate trump.
1304267699997073408 2020-09-11 11:57:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @abqralph @CamHiley @ddale8 Although he DID recommend ultraviolet light and Clorox injections. The scamp was ahead of his time.
1304266985904254976 2020-09-11 11:54:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’ve never seen the Kardashian thing, but for some reason its end makes me feel hopeful for better days, as if a corner were turned on shallowness and vapidity. Sounds ridiculous.
1304263205905145857 2020-09-11 11:39:14 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Manny_Funes We SO need to make trump and his ilk go away. Work needs to start. Immediately.
1304260425689817091 2020-09-11 11:28:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> When does the class action suit start?
1304256429214367744 2020-09-11 11:12:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @RadioFreeTom Maybe tomorrow, during the obligatory minute of silence, the GOP will spare a moment for the trump virus victims, who also died needlessly, and in numbers about 65 times that of 9/11. Trump is the most destructive terrorist America has ever produced. So proud.
1304251439380926464 2020-09-11 10:52:29 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I can’t stand it. Please make him go away.
1304250044888027142 2020-09-11 10:46:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So none of these people needs Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid, or the ACA?
1304246361072766976 2020-09-11 10:32:18 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And Saudi Arabia
1304245988039757828 2020-09-11 10:30:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Do none of these people need the ACA, Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid? Are they all wealthy, white collar workers?
1304244712694525952 2020-09-11 10:25:45 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @sbg1 I keep trying to understand why they don’t care about him taking Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and the ACA. If he gets re-elected, we old coots are going to have to get woke! Walkers, HO!
1304222348871172096 2020-09-11 08:56:53 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Mostly terrifying. We need to do something, don’t we? All while we spend every minute trying to rid ourselves of the vile menace in the White House. Overwhelming, but we can do it.
1304221060955545602 2020-09-11 08:51:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #TrumpTheRapist is credibly accused by dozens of women. Why is his fat ass still in our White House? Grosses me out.
1304218655740362752 2020-09-11 08:42:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #TrumpTheRapist
1304217901549977605 2020-09-11 08:39:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Somehow we have to triage all these crises. Too many balls need to be in the air, and none of them can be handled by trump. #TrumpResignNow
1304216799173582854 2020-09-11 08:34:50 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I hope tomorrow, when Congress observes the obligatory moment of silence for the 9/11 victims, the GOP will spare a teeny, tiny thought for the trump virus dead, almost 65 times the lives lost on that horrible day, and also for no reason. #TrumpResignNow
1304214855239503873 2020-09-11 08:27:07 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I wish Laurie Garrett was in charge.
1304213710081265665 2020-09-11 08:22:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> They DO know he’s planning to take away Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, don’t they?
1304213062812041222 2020-09-11 08:19:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @AdamParkhomenko @ddale8 So the trumpers DO know he wants to yank their Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, don’t they? Don’t they?
1304210476809752580 2020-09-11 08:09:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> “Resident of Antifa”? Is he on crack?

1304208647896080386 2020-09-11 08:02:27 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Doesn’t anyone EVER do any research on these songs? They’re always wildly inappropriate.
1304204099018162177 2020-09-11 07:44:22 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Funny, sometimes I wonder if the tiny ones from the grocery or fast food are even chickens...
1304203257682825216 2020-09-11 07:41:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @PeteButtigieg @JohnVetsResist1 Somehow we need to keep all these balls in the air.
1304202338186518528 2020-09-11 07:37:22 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I’m so sorry.  You are in my thoughts- don’t think I could handle it.

1304193113813024768 2020-09-11 07:00:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Weinsteinlaw There could be a presidential shelf in the prison library.

1304089262476931078 2020-09-11 00:08:03 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> The trump virus has taken about 65 times those of 9/11. His regime of domestic terrorism must be stopped. Where are the calls for his resignation? Can we afford to wait til January?
1304087975198969856 2020-09-11 00:02:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @BeschlossDC @karolcummins Trumpers and Republicans should reflect on their silence amid the loss of over 60 times those wasted lives today. I hope in those moments of silence they observe will be a tiny thought for the terrorist victims of Donald J. Trump.

1304083149077520385 2020-09-10 23:43:46 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Exactly when is the public outcry and the mass news outlet demand for resignation going to start? I need to plan my cocktail hour.

1304081744103170049 2020-09-10 23:38:11 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It’s really interesting that what could move the needle on Covid response is the closing of favorite bars. As a lifer bartender until the last few years, this makes actual sense to me. Had trump not presided, we’d have lost far fewer. Cheers, GOP

1303814535279792128 2020-09-10 05:56:23 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @EdgeofSports This is a breaking network news moment. A we suspend regular programming to bring you a special report moment. Why is this somehow not as big as a plane crash or natural disaster? 190,000 deliberately killed doesn’t merit special coverage. What have we become?

1303799365492830209 2020-09-10 04:56:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Pretending to buy the panic line, as they cheer on his fear- mongering about poor people of color over-running the suburbs. Gag me.

1303772868384362496 2020-09-10 03:10:49 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Most of us knew he had to have been briefed, but was either too stupid to understand or too evil to face it. As usual, these revelations are shocking but not surprising.#TrumpKnew
1303771590476402695 2020-09-10 03:05:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @sbg1 We need to get this guy out of there.
1303770056980074496 2020-09-10 02:59:39 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @kyledcheney Can any depravity surprise anymore? Arrest the bastard. Test that  memo.
1303769602716033028 2020-09-10 02:57:50 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ejeancarroll @kaplanrobbie @JoshuaMatz8 I’m sorry I paid my taxes.
1303769282048819205 2020-09-10 02:56:34 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Like we needed another bit of proof that this dickwad is dangerous.

1303767934133821449 2020-09-10 02:51:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @shannonrwatts @DrGJackBrown My thoughts exactly, and why should we abide by some memo that says the president is above the law?
1303764868814770179 2020-09-10 02:39:02 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Nor does anyone around him.
1303764556599230465 2020-09-10 02:37:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> January 28th. I wonder how long before that they knew. November? What do we think these national security types do all day? Sit around with their thumbs up their bums? Pick their noses? The job is to have fingers on the world’s pulse. Sheesh.
1303763728987455497 2020-09-10 02:34:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> There should be no small amount of panic at Fox News. If #TrumpKnew, they knew.
1303760532885962754 2020-09-10 02:21:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Vile nitwit. Apologies to non-vile nitwits.
1303756995208585218 2020-09-10 02:07:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Is she on crack?
1303756852426137601 2020-09-10 02:07:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @washingtonpost Arrest this murderer.
1303754700555255810 2020-09-10 01:58:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> It needs testing- immediately, if not sooner.
1303751676243972098 2020-09-10 01:46:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> She kisses her baby with that mouth?#KayleighLIED
1303750939854221313 2020-09-10 01:43:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Why is the psychopath still sitting on his fat ass in the White House? Get him and all his vile minions out of there. We absolutely MUST test the ridiculous non- indictment of a sitting president rule. Is there no crime that would remove him?
1303750136674357251 2020-09-10 01:40:29 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #TrumpKnew. As with every other vile aspect of this man,we knew, didn’t we? We knew there was no way global health experts were not briefing global leaders and their global experts. What is wrong with us? This guy is a murderer, and should be removed immediately. #TrumpKnew
1303747000085762049 2020-09-10 01:28:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @clairecmc There’s way too much of that going around. I used to have a lot of admiration for journalists, but they’re losing me. What happened to getting the scoop, and then writing about it later?
1303712075257176072 2020-09-09 23:09:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #TrumpIsARapist. Women can NOT tolerate a minute more of this evil man. Together, we can rise up and get rid of him. #TrumpIsARapist
1303711508858310658 2020-09-09 23:07:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> #TrumpIsARapist. He boasted of sexual assault on a TV microphone and we didn’t believe him? He’s admitting rape now, and we’re paying for his defense. Americans are sadly, scarily disappointing.#TrumpIsARapist and I’ve had enough of this gross pig. Apologies to pigs.
1303707234526953472 2020-09-09 22:50:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> But he’d much rather use OUR money and Justice Department to weasel out of his civil case.
1303706763401875457 2020-09-09 22:48:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We really cannot afford any more time with trump as he destroys not only our democracy, but our planet.The clock is ticking.
1303704408790839301 2020-09-09 22:38:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is why he is president. The feds take CI protection very seriously, and apparently do not out them. Ever.
1303702438445289473 2020-09-09 22:30:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is very interesting reading. How in hell did we elect this scumbag president?
1303338839491186693 2020-09-08 22:26:08 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Didn’t I read that Republican-led states account for 8 of the top 10 for highest crime rates?
1303332709662687238 2020-09-08 22:01:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @womanworried So very sorry. I hope the coming months will be kind.
1303139372385140737 2020-09-08 09:13:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Cctenpro1 @DrillSargentLou @sarahmucha It’s true-  Biden/Harris should be on TV every day with specific and accessible  explanations of their plans. Concrete, positive ideas, clearly presented. Emphasis on what trumpers lose if he’s  re-elected. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid? Trumpers have paid into all these.
1303134798710542337 2020-09-08 08:55:21 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is just embarrassing.
1303134498528407555 2020-09-08 08:54:10 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> This is what always comes to mind when the GOP stays silent about each outrage. They’ll be coming for you as well one of these days

1303131340544585729 2020-09-08 08:41:37 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @realTuckFrumper I grew up a Catholic, and have my own little quirks, like being guilty of everything that goes wrong anywhere, but this weirdo sounds like he’s waiting for the Rapture. What in hell is wrong with these people?
1303130356258934786 2020-09-08 08:37:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JoeBiden And why are so many farms going down, and so many farmers  committing suicide?
1303130053459488768 2020-09-08 08:36:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @keith3048 Anyone who can, in a place with paper ballots, should put on a mask and vote early in person. Let’s get this done on election night.
1303129595667939331 2020-09-08 08:34:41 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @underthesea62 @DrillSargentLou @realDonaldTrump Apparently they were wrong when they thought he knew a lot about economics.

1303112895719501825 2020-09-08 07:28:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> What he said. What the hell is TV News HQ?
1303112431900733442 2020-09-08 07:26:29 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Maybe the GOP doesn’t highlight their platform is that they so@proudly do not have one. The RNC proudly stayed that their only aim was to support trump. They believe in nothing.
1303111552418054144 2020-09-08 07:22:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @KatieHill4CA @vblacktsunami Nobody ever said he understood economics.

1303111057737682944 2020-09-08 07:21:01 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @briantylercohen Yeah, the President has to drive his shitbox heap with no wipers through the Paris streets. What is wrong with this nitwit?
1303110482644135937 2020-09-08 07:18:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> We need young people to vote. If you don’t, we old codgers are coming to your house for internet lessons.

1303079915814780929 2020-09-08 05:17:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ReeseW Everyone should read and reflect on these thoughts and their own.

This man is criminally stupid, and cares nothing for you. Wake up.
1303051227635347457 2020-09-08 03:23:16 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @tribelaw Thank you for quoting Lawrence Ferlinghetti. He and Thom Gunn are modern poets I could actually read.

1303017215126577153 2020-09-08 01:08:07 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @girlsreallyrule Is it possible that ALL republicans are compromised? What are the odds? Seriously, is Romney really the only one that’s sort of moral?
1303016566066380801 2020-09-08 01:05:32 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @TimOBrien I don’t want to be like a trumper. Apparently, if you see the whole clip, he is pointing out the puddle to Melanoma as she is walking to join him. Not that he isn’t a dithering nitwit, but this video is foreshortened. Damn.

1302986914979631110 2020-09-07 23:07:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @IslandGirlPRV @realDonaldTrump This was the kind of actual interview that should be routinely conducted. The Marie Brenner articles in Vanity Fair are also very illuminating. Journalism seems a lost art.
1302985159155822595 2020-09-07 23:00:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Stunning metaphor of the trump era.

1302982242801790977 2020-09-07 22:49:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Vote early, in person if you have paper ballots marked in pen.
1302981052537896961 2020-09-07 22:44:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Media needs to stop calling them “alleged” comments. They have been corroborated extensively.
1302978718097440768 2020-09-07 22:35:09 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> And the fraud rate for trump is 99.99%.
1302977660994322432 2020-09-07 22:30:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I think it’s exacerbated by the trump turmoil.
1302977274556362754 2020-09-07 22:29:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I never thought I’d be so ashamed of being an American.
1302973581299789825 2020-09-07 22:14:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @fred_guttenberg Vote in person early.

1302406910675767297 2020-09-06 08:42:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Apparently, he’s spent about 35 years representing Kentucky, and it’s still almost dead last on any metric of success as an American state. Sorry, but what are Kentuckians thinking of? How much failure and neglect is enough? Poorest state/ richest senator. Learn some math.

And I’ll never, ever forget how happy I was the day of Access Hollywood, and how sickened when it dawned that no one cared.
1302340973377327109 2020-09-06 04:20:59 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> So the White House can’t bring in adult size tables for dignitaries? Are they kidding? Who’s in charge of protocol? Looks like Thanksgiving at Mom’s house.

1302264751834238976 2020-09-05 23:18:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Donald Trump should resign today.

1302115367410634753 2020-09-05 13:24:30 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Remembering that time at his hotel ( forget the holiday)when he was mocking hand over heart to the anthem. Scum. Just scum. Apologies to scum.

1302113431856742401 2020-09-05 13:16:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @CREWcrew There are reports and pictures of trump appeals on ballots and mailings about voting by mail. Resign.

We can guess he’s used similar words to describe his followers, both the evangelicals and the garden variety cultists. We can hear the same words, can’t we?
1302073295211290624 2020-09-05 10:37:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @bennyjohnson Check out Rachel Maddow’s show tonight, who addresses this with one of the Gold Star mothers in the ad, who works with VoteVets, and were contacted after the story came out, and, in some cases, worked through the night.

1302046023758557187 2020-09-05 08:48:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @thomaswright08 @TheRickWilson So do we assume every member of the GOP except Romney has been personally threatened? Every Republican is under personal threat? Seriously- it would at least explain some of this vile dissonance.
1302044832056172544 2020-09-05 08:44:13 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DWUhlfelderLaw I’m guessing she didn’t actually write this.
1302032183746584576 2020-09-05 07:53:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @jimsciutto Trump’s adoration of Putin must be money or fear related. Isn’t the whole economy of Russia the size of Texas or something?

1301680909461139457 2020-09-04 08:38:07 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Shouldn’t trump’s surrogate SAT be part of an investigation?

1301678113181577217 2020-09-04 08:27:00 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @matthewamiller He’s pretending people should vote again to check the status of their mail ballot. News flash! Ballots are barcoded, specific to voter ID, address, and registration. You can track them online. Come on, you’re not that stupid, are you?
1301677124043132929 2020-09-04 08:23:05 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @BillKristol This is exactly why we should be very, very afraid.

We knew his supposed reverence for the military was nonsense, but when you see these words you realize just how small and evil this person is. WAKE UP!
1301652159340187651 2020-09-04 06:43:52 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @RzstProgramming @MeidasTouch He appears not to understand what “fascism” is. Funny, because I looked up the definition, and there was a picture of trump.
1301651262556049410 2020-09-04 06:40:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Please keep reiterating his staggering lies about his reverence for the military. It’s heartbreaking and needs to be seen.

1301645548689281025 2020-09-04 06:17:36 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> If this is accurate, it needs to be shouted from the rooftops. There can’t be anyone more reprehensible than this evil moron, and I’m getting pretty bloody tired of him denigrating people and things I love. He is subhuman and needs to be removed from our lives.

1301552585531293696 2020-09-04 00:08:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @GavinNewsom @thekjohnston It’s hard to triage trump and GOP evils. There are all the financial and anti- democracy crimes, and then there are the crimes against our health, the health of our planet, and the future of the entire human race. We need to wake up and keep all these balls in the air.
1301550649079980036 2020-09-04 00:00:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I think it’s past time to revisit and test the “rule” against indicting a sitting president. He is most assuredly above the law, and I do not like it.
1301549872122925058 2020-09-03 23:57:25 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> If trump were to wipe out Social Security and Medicare, we old coots will make all these kid protesters look like chumps. You will see the wrath of the aged, just moving a little slower. Think soup is scary? Try an umbrella-wielding senior citizen protecting hard-earned benefits!
1301527395493646336 2020-09-03 22:28:06 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @jaketapper The “No Indictment of a Sitting President” rule needs to go. Why shouldn’t it be tested immediately? This situation is insupportable. This vile nitwit and his evil henchmen are getting away with literal murder.

1301165217724936200 2020-09-02 22:28:57 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JRehling Kind of wondering what kind of class they think she has. Seems mostly low to me.
1301164540583870466 2020-09-02 22:26:15 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @politvidchannel Ivanka also, and Jared uses WhatsApp, and trump uses unsecured cellphones...What else is new? They’re a bunch of criminal nitwits endangering us every day. I want them gone.
1300996701390544897 2020-09-02 11:19:19 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> I sincerely hope Iowa’s many health care professionals will be voting in November. Actually, voting early

1300990656379265024 2020-09-02 10:55:18 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Please, someone tell me trump did NOT say “Rest in Peace, Jay” referring to the right-wing victim in Portland. No thoughts or prayers for Ruttledge’s three victims, 2 dead.

1300923062825746434 2020-09-02 06:26:42 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @JohnWDean Bingo. The crux of the problem.
1300921308927217667 2020-09-02 06:19:44 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @mattyglesias @Lawrence But whose side are they on?

1300919412950740992 2020-09-02 06:12:12 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @kylegriffin1 @andrewkimmel Trump fact checkers work harder than one-armed paper hangers.
1300918087198310401 2020-09-02 06:06:56 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ponsford_mike The $64,000,000 question. He doesn’t have to shoot someone on 5th Ave. He’s got the GOP Senate trying to kill his supporters, and if they don’t wake up, they’ll be eating cat food from the Dollar Store. If they’re lucky.
1300917048650891265 2020-09-02 06:02:48 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @Eiggam5955 Or mustard on a hamburger.
1300916772443480065 2020-09-02 06:01:43 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @alfranken I don’t think trump can identify the date of his birth.
1300916174264381443 2020-09-02 05:59:20 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump I keep thinking if he tries to take Social Security and Medicare, he’s going to see what angry mobs look like- old and with walkers. A sea of white (hair). Bring it on, #TraitorTrump #TrumpKillsUs #TraitorTrump

1300612584194928641 2020-09-01 09:52:58 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @DWUhlfelderLaw Of course.
1300611966751436801 2020-09-01 09:50:31 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> @ddale8 Is there video to back him up? Maybe Rand Paul has it.
1300611025306345473 2020-09-01 09:46:47 +0800 <MaryBethMegan1> Looks like Ivanka doing the same thing Thursday night at the RNC.  https://t.co/vGgRGFmOvl
