1342892889286828033 2020-12-27 01:59:49 +0800 <AliAdair22> @joncoopertweets But as Rachel Maddow pointed out, we already had a criminal that was much smarter than Trump in power: Spiro Agnew.  Of course, Agnew wasn’t very likable. Probably because he was an intellectual. Hard to get all those qualities in one person: fascist, likable, intelligent, etc.

Caputo helped spread bald-faced lies about Jon Bon Jovi’s group and had them eliminated from the bidding.  It was a dry run for the 2016 election.

He should have been impeached earlier, more often and/or continually investigated; he admitted that this hurt him.  He lives in the moment &amp; would have been distracted. He even said he deserved a third term because of it.

1341473956595953664 2020-12-23 04:01:29 +0800 <AliAdair22> I find it interesting that Trump pardoned Michael Milken in February 2020.  When Ivan Boesky was charged, he sang like a canary and Milken was one of the people that he turned state’s evidence against.

Or even in the radar of law enforc.  You cannot pardon for crimes which may be committed in the future.

1339360163346739200 2020-12-17 08:02:01 +0800 <AliAdair22> 📚 If you read this thread thoroughly, it points to a lot of evidence that Barr charged the wrong people when he was first Attorney General under George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s.  Now he’s trying to reinforce it.
1339359323126947840 2020-12-17 07:58:41 +0800 <AliAdair22> 💣 Not sure what this is about but it looks like William Barr is covering his as$ before he leaves office.  Federal prosecutors in Washington are expected to unseal charges next week against Abu Agila Mas’ud, who allegedly helped build the bomb in 1988.   https://t.co/ZD1Vpi4wWH

1339322194531377153 2020-12-17 05:31:09 +0800 <AliAdair22> @DoctorHenryCT @karmakrayonn I know. I’m just saying that it’s not always age that makes someone ineffectual.   I used Clyburn as an example. We are lucky to have someone w/ his civil rights background in Congress &amp; he also has very good political instincts.  There are many that need to go though; agree 100%

1339311867328679937 2020-12-17 04:50:07 +0800 <AliAdair22> @DoctorHenryCT Clyburn is still on top of his game though. Sometimes, wisdom and experience is better than young blood.  But sometimes, not.  What Democrats need to improve on is fighting for what’s right and communicating their view in a better way.

Remember the old days when there was only a bloody HINT of corruption or scandal that people in Congress just preemptively resigned? Those were the days...

1337810179635752960 2020-12-13 01:22:56 +0800 <AliAdair22> Have you ever checked out @ProjectLincoln’s website?  Check out the “Senior Advisors.”  We need their help. They know how to fight.   https://t.co/oNCPee5oXk
1337809549886185472 2020-12-13 01:20:26 +0800 <AliAdair22> @ProjectLincoln helped Democrats win the presidency as well as many other seats in Congress; they’re helping get @ReverendWarnock and @ossoff get elected.  Now they’re pledging to help unseat  the 126 members of the House who signed onto the Texas lawsuit.  What else do you need?

We all agree on that 1 point &amp; that’s enough.  If the infighting continues, we will lose it

If we can’t win every single race, something is very wrong with the messaging.  It’s good vs. evil. Right vs. wrong.   It’s corruption vs. truth, justice and the American way!

It’s not just Democrats that would hate this. It’s every person on the planet who cares about the rule of law.

1334129933677948929 2020-12-02 21:38:57 +0800 <AliAdair22> I know he’s nuts, but why exactly would Trump tweet that the January 5 elections in #Georgia “won’t be needed?”  Does he think he’s going to become king? WTF!  https://t.co/lxE3tqzAQ0
1333998151305400320 2020-12-02 12:55:18 +0800 <AliAdair22> I will never forgive Trump and the @GOP for willfully LYING while our loved ones DIED on their watch.  Pass it on.  #COVID19 #coronavirus
1333994410103738369 2020-12-02 12:40:26 +0800 <AliAdair22> @thomaskaine5 So if it’s a truly bipartisan group, they should overrule McConnell. He can’t keep doing this.  Then it will also be veto-proof. Overrule McConnell, then overrule Trump.  No idea why those idiots voted to keep him as leader. He has done more to destroy our country than Trump.

1333957036841766916 2020-12-02 10:11:55 +0800 <AliAdair22> RANDOM GOOD ADVICE  Don’t break the law.  This way, you don’t need a pardon or any kind and you don’t have to bribe anyone to get a pardon—which adds yet another crime.
1333923071959425026 2020-12-02 07:56:58 +0800 <AliAdair22> @maggie_twit @AhmedBaba_ Maybe Trump operates on a “sliding scale,” but I don’t think Flynn has that kind of money.

1333907708370677761 2020-12-02 06:55:55 +0800 <AliAdair22> 🦠 That makes a lot of sense.  I also think that kids and young adults who are in school should be up there in the queue.  That would ease the stress on working parents and the damage done to our education system.  Adults 40 &amp; over should be mature enough to wait a little longer.

Or he will flee to a country without an extradition agreement...

1333884495766974465 2020-12-02 05:23:40 +0800 <AliAdair22> I personally think Barr has a plan and wants to get fired.

1333861974686490626 2020-12-02 03:54:11 +0800 <AliAdair22> 🔥 McConnell is dead wrong on this.  If there is a truly bipartisan #COVID19 relief bill, it could be veto-proof.  In that case, you don’t need a lame-duck, golf-playing, self-obsessed “president” to sign it.

1328687241485574144 2020-11-17 21:11:38 +0800 <AliAdair22> @Zac_Petkanas I always thought several 2018 elections were fishy: Josh Hawley, Rick Scott, Ron DeSantis, Stacey Abrams, Ted Cruz...just to name a few.   Republicans have been heavily cheating since 2016. They’ve just gotten bolder—and this time they better get investigated &amp; overturned.
1328678674443489280 2020-11-17 20:37:36 +0800 <AliAdair22> 🙌👊 Let’s hope this becomes a trend!  It’s getting beyond ridiculous.
1328677477791772673 2020-11-17 20:32:50 +0800 <AliAdair22> @Zac_Petkanas Elections which should be investigated: Joni Ernst, Matt Gaetz, Devin Nunes, Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, Thom Tillis, John Cornyn, Steve Daines, Roger Marshall, to name a few.  And how did Mark Kelly only win by 2 points? Give me a break.

Technically, Mitch McConnell is not Majority leader yet.  I’m sure they will want to wait until after January 5th and the 2 #Georgia races are settled. And #Alaska.   But do they?!?

1323510513003909121 2020-11-03 14:21:10 +0800 <AliAdair22> @alexespind 💯 Yes, I agree. Especially if Biden has a clear-cut win which is likely to happen.  I am afraid that more people will lose their lives to right wing wackos.   Let them stand around with their ridiculous guns and think what they’re doing.

Trump is just pathetic &amp; sad &amp; will not survive without daily affirmations from his Trumpsters or paid Trumpsters. Ali Velshi will be around many years after Trump is gone!
1320421422704054272 2020-10-26 01:46:14 +0800 <AliAdair22> @JonFlan Trump thinks he’s a stand-up comedian and unfortunately the Ali Velshi routine is one that he thinks “works” for him even though it is filled with lies.  I saw it live &amp; if I’m recalling accurately, Velshi just kept going with his reporting despite getting hit by a rubber bullet.

1320229986100514816 2020-10-25 13:05:32 +0800 <AliAdair22> @glennkirschner2 So that rules out Pence pardoning him since it’s very likely he is a potential co-conspirator on some crimes.

None of them deserve any sympathy. Especially the #52Killers in the Senate.  Eventually, all 52 will be in the private sector, unemployed or in prison.

1319387737070489600 2020-10-23 05:18:44 +0800 <AliAdair22> Ghislaine Maxwell will not admit to taking nude photos, only partially nude, but very tasteful. Tasteful enough to be in a mainstream magazine or displayed on your parents’ or grandparents’ mantel.  https://t.co/RcOKkimDw9

1319365698339164162 2020-10-23 03:51:09 +0800 <AliAdair22> A great example of Ghislaine Maxwell being EXTREMELY evasive.   The plaintiff’s attorney asks: “...do you believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?”  This goes on for at least 10 pages in the same vicious circle. Answered evasively. Re-asked. Repeat.  https://t.co/PNpRxUu7fr

1319327631469367296 2020-10-23 01:19:53 +0800 <AliAdair22> Of course, Ghislaine Maxwell could be lying. But these would be stupid lies in a deposition that she would be accountable for.  I’m on p. 100 and she has lied and been extremely evasive so far. There is also a long redacted passage that is likely about sex toys. (It continues...)  https://t.co/XuRzB21Ep9

Epstein never met her father, who died November 5, 1991.  3. She started “working” for him in 1992—which probably means she was his live-in “girlfriend.”  https://t.co/XiUV7Mk8sd

1311280991705628673 2020-09-30 20:25:25 +0800 <AliAdair22> In the summer of 2016, Trump’s rallies were sort of a hoot—especially for those who hate rules &amp; books—but last night wasn’t even remotely funny.  It was just pure viciousness.  Because he wasn’t prepared to talk about policy, he cheated by talking over Biden and Wallace.  “🤡.”

When his hair wasn't done, his strands of dyed-golden hair reached below his shoulders along the right side of his head and on his back,...
1310587730217271297 2020-09-28 22:30:39 +0800 <AliAdair22> 📘 Cohen book (cont'd)  Trump was in his underwear, white Hanes briefs, and a white short-sleeve undershirt, watching cable news on television. He barely seemed to register that it was unusual for a grown man to be in a state of undress in front of an employee, but there it was.

The sexist swagger was part of life inside Trump's bubble, a juvenile redoubt that was proudly, defiantly, and most definitely Neanderthal about women.
1309183637968039936 2020-09-25 01:31:17 +0800 <AliAdair22> 📗 Cohen  ...disgust and, in all likelihood, a steep decline in his regard. In this way, I could relate to Billy Bush in the "grab them by the pussies" video in which Trump boasted about how his celebrity status afforded him the privilege of being able to sexually assault women.
1309183635774476289 2020-09-25 01:31:16 +0800 <AliAdair22> 📗 Cohen book (cont'd)  Silence was often the best response to Trump, I had learned, especially when it came to lewd remarks. There was really nothing to say, I knew, unless you wanted to confront Trump with a politically correct remark, &amp; that would only result in ridicule &amp;...

Depending on where they are in the rehearsals, maybe we can catch a few of them in the back getting dressed. They are truly the best of the best."

But for now, let’s get the ones who are up for re-election in 2020.  Six years is a long time. Let’s work hard to make sure they all lose.  #FlipTheSenate   #Vote
1307488099312771074 2020-09-20 09:13:49 +0800 <AliAdair22> Every one of the 52 Senators who voted to acquit Trump aided and abetted a criminal.   Therefore, all 52 are criminals.  They don’t keep their word.  You can’t believe what they say.  You can’t count on them to do anything but Trump’s bidding.

1304450639888551936 2020-09-12 00:04:02 +0800 <AliAdair22> 🧵 From the thread I posted above:   https://t.co/bbv1kYX2bj
1304450372539424772 2020-09-12 00:02:58 +0800 <AliAdair22> When another of Wayne's teammates came to bail him out the next morning, he paid the bail and had to reimburse the irate sheriff for the Chinese food. He remembers the amount of the bill to this day.
1304450371528556550 2020-09-12 00:02:58 +0800 <AliAdair22> Wayne was taken to jail and instead of calling his lawyer, he used his one phone call to order Chinese food for everyone in the jail.
1304450370484293632 2020-09-12 00:02:58 +0800 <AliAdair22> Somehow, a full-scale donnybrook broke out in the streets of Boston and despite Ace's efforts at being the peacemaker, the police eventually arrived and arrested Wayne for driving while intoxicated.
1304450369129508864 2020-09-12 00:02:58 +0800 <AliAdair22> Another time, after a night of debauchery, he followed his friend Wayne Cashman home in their cards. They stopped at a red light. When the light turned green, Wayne honked at the driver in front of him who wasn't moving.
1304449298298437632 2020-09-11 23:58:42 +0800 <AliAdair22> The fan hailed a cab and got away as Ace and his teammate watched helplessly. Just about everyone who reads that scene doesn't believe it really happened. But it did.
1304449297149296640 2020-09-11 23:58:42 +0800 <AliAdair22> There were several different versions of the story, but I liked Ace's version the best. The fan had just taken a swing at the Bruins' Bobby Orr (basically the franchise), who was watching from the stands that night, and they were seeking revenge.
1304448739239759875 2020-09-11 23:56:29 +0800 <AliAdair22> In 1 of the first scenes of the script (based on a real game that took place in '69), Ace &amp; 1 of his teammates, followed by many in the Bruin organization, chased a fan through the runway, under the stands &amp; out onto the street outside the Montreal Forum—in full uniform &amp; skates.
1304448737595584515 2020-09-11 23:56:29 +0800 <AliAdair22> After winning the Stanley Cup in 1972, Ace's teammate Johnny "Pie" McKenzie doused the mayor with a pitcher of beer.
1304447872067350529 2020-09-11 23:53:02 +0800 <AliAdair22> They had crazy nicknames and they went on crazy escapades like donning hospital masks and surgical garb to kidnap their teammate Phil Esposito from his hospital bed, and wheeling him through the streets of Boston to an all-important party.
1304447870825893889 2020-09-11 23:53:02 +0800 <AliAdair22> He regaled me with stories about the old Boston Bruins from the late '60s and '70s. The players were good—they won two Stanley Cups—but they were also one of the closest-knit teams in hockey history and known for playing hard off the rink.
1304447020183281665 2020-09-11 23:49:39 +0800 <AliAdair22> This is an excerpt from the @latimes "Letter to the Editor" I wrote, published on September 15, 2001. It was mainly about an interview I had with him shortly before the tragedy:  We talked about a lot of things and he introduced me to all his buddies.
1304446228135108610 2020-09-11 23:46:30 +0800 <AliAdair22> 😇 2,977 people died on 9/11, but I only wrote about one in 2001 and then again in 2018.  Garnet "Ace" Bailey, who was a professional hockey player and later a scout, tragically perished on United Airlines Flight 175 on September 11, 2001.   https://t.co/mZvqomxlAo

Russia did.  “Choosing Novichok to poison Navalny in 2020 is basically the same thing as leaving an autograph at the scene of the crime,” Leonid Volkov, Navalny’s chief of staff, wrote on Twitter, attaching an image of Putin’s signature.

1301679463592333313 2020-09-04 08:32:22 +0800 <AliAdair22> 🇷🇺 The reason why Trump hates—and unbelievably posthumously hates—John McCain so much is because he co-authored the Magnitsky Act (2012) and the Global Magnitsky Act (2016).  And the last 4 years has been about Russia getting revenge for those two bills.   https://t.co/bgSy64ZJvk

1300768113747791872 2020-09-01 20:11:00 +0800 <AliAdair22> The only thing new here is the anesthesia/Pence angle.  We already knew that Trump was rushed to Walter Reed hospital in November by Secret Service and that they obviously lied about it being the first part of his physical.
1300764506944090114 2020-09-01 19:56:40 +0800 <AliAdair22> @Krj81Jacobs We already knew all that.
