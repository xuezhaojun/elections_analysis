1343723423772659713 2020-12-29 09:00:04 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Debber66 Oh my goodness - that‚Äôs so true!  He literally looked down his nose at us.
1343722504012103680 2020-12-29 08:56:24 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @BrianEvansSays @MikayesFiona Thanks.
1343721363404685314 2020-12-29 08:51:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @BrianEvansSays @MikayesFiona I truly had no idea. I followed Tracy because of her assoc. with Gen Flynn. In fact, I was so out of the loop that I once thought Tracy was married to Gen Flynn‚Äôs son. They seemed super close. Anyway, I‚Äôm one of the suckers who donated to her GFM for her house. I feel stupid now.
1343718190203998208 2020-12-29 08:39:16 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB I have no idea - but my guess is that it is. Everything else is. üò¢
1343712480258895872 2020-12-29 08:16:34 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @mjfree @Kaepernick7 @NFL Cause he‚Äôs a horrible player.

1343711407892791302 2020-12-29 08:12:19 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @bdomenech @FDRLST That still makes me so sad.
1343708781398675461 2020-12-29 08:01:53 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RCamposDuffy @drdavidsamadi Yes, and I for one am very grateful for a voice of reason amongst so much false information.
1343369491309322240 2020-12-28 09:33:39 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @kdanderso @Cleavon_MD @SaraGonzalesTX I have zero respect for any healthcare worker who believes the bullshit that the CDC and Fauci have been spouting at us from their lying pie holes. We all know the truth - and we know we've been lied to for months now. But it's more lucrative to call every death a COVID death.
1343367591134429188 2020-12-28 09:26:06 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @NicoleArbour Very good advice - and it really does work!
1343366375386066944 2020-12-28 09:21:17 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @deneenborelli @tomborelli OH MY GOODNESS! Any leftovers? I'll send you my address! LOL!  Seriously though - care to share the recipe?
1343213200649678851 2020-12-27 23:12:37 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @KristySwansonXO @JaniceDean Awesome!
1343001425194921990 2020-12-27 09:11:06 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RepKinzinger You absolute piece of shit.  The @GOP is done. You will be very surprised when the American people begin to rise up and decide to go with a 3rd party.  We will be replacing the GOP!!!
1342959966928441345 2020-12-27 06:26:21 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @johnrich Amen!

1342860485516001285 2020-12-26 23:51:03 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Loved this article.  It brought back some fond memories.  A Brief History of the Juvenile Mysteries You Checked Out of the Library Eight at a Time  https://t.co/GgRcr8XGfu via @CrimeReads

1342851909653291008 2020-12-26 23:16:58 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @TFisherson @drdagly There are plenty - and I found most of them myself, so do your own research. It's out there - don't be lazy.
1342842174367551489 2020-12-26 22:38:17 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @VerkykHenny @drdagly @Gatordeb1955 Nope!  They don't work.
1342842002837270528 2020-12-26 22:37:36 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @2B_Painfree @drdagly @SallyDeal4 Idiot - you should never wear a mask during physical exertion. You are not allowing yourself to expel any bad air and are restricting your lungs. You will see long term affects later.
1342841279760257031 2020-12-26 22:34:44 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LevequeThots @drdagly The long term affects of wearing a mask will not be seen for a while, but there are risks.  No one realizes that you are meant to breathe out naturally for a reason.  Breathing in your own germs and bacteria is not good for you.  People are being hoodwinked!
1342840569995927553 2020-12-26 22:31:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @TFisherson @drdagly COVID is not a hoax, but believing that masks work is.  Do some real research.
1342840255918051330 2020-12-26 22:30:40 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SandSurferHI @drdagly God bless! And please tell your husband that I thank him for his service! I live free because of him and other brave people like him!  Merry Christmas!

1342618314854555650 2020-12-26 07:48:45 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @PressSec @KFILE That just breaks my heart. So sad to hear.
1342617900008546304 2020-12-26 07:47:06 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JackPosobiec Love it!
1342291589750804480 2020-12-25 10:10:28 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @drdagly Nope!  You know better, and that‚Äôs sad.
1342276361747116032 2020-12-25 09:09:57 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB @AdamCrigler OMG love your yarn swift &amp; winder. Is it a set? I have a wooden one with a small plastic winder that attaches to the table. Would love to upgrade.
1342239425028362244 2020-12-25 06:43:11 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ChristianWalk1r Could not have said it better myself. Merry Christmas brother! üéÑ
1342198646520086529 2020-12-25 04:01:08 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @WatchChad I think our eyes were always open, we just couldn‚Äôt believe what we were seeing. All of 2020 seemed so incredulous.
1342185089623601154 2020-12-25 03:07:16 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @pnjaban Yes!
1342129834252783618 2020-12-24 23:27:42 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Liz_Wheeler But her story changed. That wasn‚Äôt the original reason that she gave.  She‚Äôs a fraud like Fauci. The 2 of them put this country in a tail spin because of ridiculous and wrong advice to @realDonaldTrump.  It‚Äôs disgusting that they were not called out sooner - but our media sucks.
1342129189693104129 2020-12-24 23:25:09 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @CDCgov Fuck off!  Damn, you made me curse on Christmas Eve.

1342128113581518855 2020-12-24 23:20:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @yesnicksearcy Hmmm, her story keeps changing.
1342127649246875650 2020-12-24 23:19:01 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ksorbs Merry Christmas Eve üéÑThank you for your funny tweets, but more importantly for your no-nonsense opinions and staunch support of America! Appreciate all you do.

1341845514258624522 2020-12-24 04:37:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Does your neck hurt with all that whiplash from flip-flopping so much. I thought you were one of the good ones, but you‚Äôre just as crooked and corrupt as the rest. Our political ‚Äúleaders‚Äù are horrible and make me sick.  I would love to see every one of you lose your jobs.
1341844540710412290 2020-12-24 04:34:03 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @FDRLST @kyleezempel I don‚Äôt watch it because it‚Äôs a stupid show with no entertainment quality at all - has nothing to do with me being a Christian.

1341542709501304833 2020-12-23 08:34:41 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @PressSec @realDonaldTrump She‚Äôs a liar and a hack.  She‚Äôs done nothing useful. Good fucking riddance. I hope the fraud Fauci is next. He‚Äôs a piece of shit.

And they still won‚Äôt open up the country for those who have lost jobs and businesses.  Our government is a pitiful disgrace. I‚Äôm thoroughly disgusted with the lot of them.

1337053390803791876 2020-12-10 23:15:44 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Exactly my argument. The org I work for is saying we may never get back in the office. We will lose not only the benefits of collaboration, but you will also lose loyalty to the company. When you build personal relationships at work people tend to stick around and be more loyal.

1334136603711852551 2020-12-02 22:05:28 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @5tevieM @PatUnleashed So glad that I‚Äôm not the only one!
1334132853257498624 2020-12-02 21:50:33 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SethDillon That‚Äôs sad and disheartening
1334132535857713152 2020-12-02 21:49:18 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @HeatherChilders So glad to see you on @newsmax
1334131504599998466 2020-12-02 21:45:12 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @livingm35429859 @kirstiealley Look in the mirror lately?  You‚Äôre no prize.
1334130749512036352 2020-12-02 21:42:12 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ScottAdamsSays üò¢Sadly, I think you are correct.
1334130311542808577 2020-12-02 21:40:27 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RoscoeBDavis1 I‚Äôm convinced I had it in Dec 2019. Cough, trouble breathing, fever of 104 in the emergency room. No clear diagnosis, just told I had a bad flu. My blood work was wonky, nothing made sense to the Doc. By Feb all my numbers were back to normal with no explanation. Doc was baffled.
1333967319664652291 2020-12-02 10:52:47 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RubinReport Are you kidding me!  This looks so awesome and so easy - even I can do it.  I can‚Äôt wait to try this.
1333915534400905218 2020-12-02 07:27:01 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @sautter @amydiehl I found the book very depressing
1333913212916523011 2020-12-02 07:17:47 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SenTedCruz If his support gets @POTUS his 4 more years - that he would have won handily, if not for cheating - then I will be 100% on the Ted Cruz train if he runs in 2024. I was not in his previous run.
1333840960074240000 2020-12-02 02:30:41 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @tracybeanz I watched the PA &amp; Arizona hearings, and am similarly riveted listening to these testimonies in Michigan. How do we remedy this. It‚Äôs so compelling and yet the judges and courts just don‚Äôt seem to care. How the hell do we move on from this - it‚Äôs horrifying!
1333840082059587585 2020-12-02 02:27:11 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB @shoe0nhead @PsychicJoshua Oh I can‚Äôt wait for tonight now!
1333486511388565508 2020-12-01 03:02:13 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB It‚Äôs a wonderful hobby.  Keeps me from eating at night when I watch TV.
1333486322611343362 2020-12-01 03:01:28 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB @therealcraftsy I bought a kit &amp; book. After a couple of hours I went to bed frustrated. I just couldn‚Äôt get it. My husband felt so bad (it was his idea to help me keep my hands limber due to arthritis). He picked up the book, taught himself &amp; then taught me the next morning. I haven‚Äôt stopped!
1333483145463816192 2020-12-01 02:48:51 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Oooh - I like that!

1333459960940924928 2020-12-01 01:16:43 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @katierosemiller Beautiful baby. Beautiful family.  God bless.
1333209983362756609 2020-11-30 08:43:24 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JoeBiden After all you said about people like me - I don‚Äôt think so. My memory isn‚Äôt as short as yours.
1333202327344386050 2020-11-30 08:12:59 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @kirstiealley 1. New bed; 2. MacBook Pro; 3. Jane Austen collection from Folio Society; 4. New Refrigerator; Diamond pendant to match my engagement ring
1333196896807100419 2020-11-30 07:51:24 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ACTBrigitte Yep - me too. I ditched the entire network.
1333066033373048834 2020-11-29 23:11:24 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Love it!
1333064764352847876 2020-11-29 23:06:21 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @katjaherbers @DrKarlynB Hahaha - can‚Äôt have an intelligent conversation when you don‚Äôt have a script to read from.  I find that‚Äôs the case with most ‚Äúwoke‚Äù actors.
1333063357491015686 2020-11-29 23:00:46 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LauriceF @katjaherbers You‚Äôre a complete idiot.

1333062553115701250 2020-11-29 22:57:34 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @katjaherbers Who the fuck are you to call someone a racist. I think maybe it‚Äôs time I post that you are a racist - cause I can make things up too.
1333062067683733504 2020-11-29 22:55:38 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @CassandraRules @katjaherbers @DrKarlynB @BasedElisabeth Perfectly stated.
1333061930811060230 2020-11-29 22:55:06 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @katjaherbers @DrKarlynB @BasedElisabeth It‚Äôs a horrible show anyway.  I gave up 3 episodes in.
1332512343981498368 2020-11-28 10:31:14 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @realDailyWire Just took advantage of the offer and upgraded!
1332310398373163011 2020-11-27 21:08:46 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ChrisLoesch @DLoesch This looks delish!  It also reminded me of a song many years ago that @steveglosson recorded.  A bit silly, but it still brings me joy  https://t.co/nRCgck0tJs
1332060184345251843 2020-11-27 04:34:31 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @livesmattershow @HillaryClinton Amen and hallelujah
1332059608077246466 2020-11-27 04:32:13 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB It looks glorious!
1332028728583606273 2020-11-27 02:29:31 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Pell_NC Emergency fan?
1332028274235432962 2020-11-27 02:27:43 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @thevivafrei @DrKarlynB @SidneyPowell1 Agree!  There's nothing wrong with going for the low hanging fruit.  We're on a tight timeline.  The harder issues to prove can wait until later.
1332021142970912770 2020-11-27 01:59:22 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Hahaha.  I have 4 dogs - so we deploy the pocket door. They are constantly underfoot when I‚Äôm cooking.
1331989257423040512 2020-11-26 23:52:40 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Loved this show.  Such a great article.  It brought back such great memories of the show - I‚Äôll need to binge watch from the beginning - it‚Äôs been years.

1331974772914348032 2020-11-26 22:55:07 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Take a bow - cause I think it was you!

1331972645869457409 2020-11-26 22:46:40 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Thank you for that. I prefer not to vomit when I read your tweets. üëçüèª

1331960080426803200 2020-11-26 21:56:44 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @mschlapp He had no balls from straddling the fence for so long. He‚Äôs a disgrace.

1331816930395754496 2020-11-26 12:27:54 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB That was pretty short-lived! Not unexpected though.

1331698161753133056 2020-11-26 04:35:58 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB You are making me hungry.
1331697357826777091 2020-11-26 04:32:46 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JoshShapiroPA Awww - do you need some of this?  https://t.co/rrA48Ivzu6
1331688111135465475 2020-11-26 03:56:01 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @MikayesFiona Me too. This is crazy stuff! How corrupt.
1331687609366679554 2020-11-26 03:54:02 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JackPosobiec And don‚Äôt even talk about the workers in the Philly airport - they‚Äôre a disgrace. Not to mention Eagles fans to opposing teams.
1331672403735425024 2020-11-26 02:53:36 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @julie_kelly2 I‚Äôm almost in tears.  We deserve better!

1331577856464445448 2020-11-25 20:37:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SebGorka I live in NJ.  It‚Äôs almost impossible - can‚Äôt wait to move to  Texas. Five more years!
1331577624762720260 2020-11-25 20:36:59 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @johnrich Oh no.  I really enjoyed his music. So sorry to hear of his passing. üò¢
1331577231479631877 2020-11-25 20:35:26 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @theblaze Why did this make me laugh gleefully? I know it was wrong to laugh - but I left @FoxNews for @BlazeTV and I am much smarter for. Love all of the shows.

1331335402117062656 2020-11-25 04:34:29 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RescueJb40 @WhitlockJason It as an awesome show today on @BlazeTV

1331297783308050432 2020-11-25 02:05:00 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SharylAttkisson Just arrived in the mail! #Slanted  https://t.co/GIDssT8dvq
1331000242460823563 2020-11-24 06:22:41 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @emilyjashinsky @FDRLST I tried reading the book - way too depressing for me.  Gave up not too far in.
1330864146754265090 2020-11-23 21:21:53 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SteveDeaceShow It‚Äôs weird that an article came out last week that said HRC was advised not to concede because of questionable votes from the same swing states. Could it be that the Trump campaign is worried that his 1st win could be questioned with the proof that Sidney Powell now says she has.
1330863999144038402 2020-11-23 21:21:18 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Looking for the article now.
1330863308723859458 2020-11-23 21:18:33 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB It‚Äôs weird that an article came out last week that said HRC was advised not to concede because of questionable votes from the same swing states.

1330859923643764743 2020-11-23 21:05:06 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @moodvintage @adamhousley And yet the @HolocaustMuseum in Florida thinks it‚Äôs appropriate to add a George Floyd exhibit. It‚Äôs not only inappropriate, but it‚Äôs a spit in the face of everyone who wore those rings. Where is the respect for those who were separated, tortured and killed. I‚Äôm sick over this.
1330858005181698048 2020-11-23 20:57:29 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ChuckRossDC It sucks!  Can‚Äôt wait to move to Texas.
1330856970476261385 2020-11-23 20:53:22 +0800 <Rose_Daro> This was awesome!
1330856324805107712 2020-11-23 20:50:48 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JennaEllisEsq @SidneyPowell1 @WSJ Why did you smile and nod behind her as she spoke? I trust @SidneyPowell1 more than I trust you.
1330855851301728257 2020-11-23 20:48:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ChristianWalk1r I‚Äôm praying!
1330855513383432192 2020-11-23 20:47:35 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Not sure what I think about this.
1330854390790565888 2020-11-23 20:43:07 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB And @JennaEllisEsq stood behind @SidneyPowell1 smiling and nodding as she spoke. It‚Äôs so disheartening to hear this - I‚Äôm utterly confused.
1330852978140598273 2020-11-23 20:37:30 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @w_terrence Amen brother!
1330852361670189056 2020-11-23 20:35:03 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ACTBrigitte Let me also mention, at that presser the other day, @JennaEllisEsq stood behind @SidneyPowell1 and smiled and nodded at every statement she made. Not sure what‚Äôs going on here, but I‚Äôm trusting her. Just wish there weren‚Äôt so many people ready to throw her under the bus.
1330850776873394179 2020-11-23 20:28:45 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SebGorka Millions of people are concerned, confused and very disappointed.  What in the world do we make of this? @realDonaldTrump Where do we get the truth.
1330844179849736192 2020-11-23 20:02:33 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DeaceProducer I just started using it - wanted to follow @SteveDeaceShow

1330646782481719301 2020-11-23 06:58:09 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB @blckriflecoffee Well, I‚Äôm a bit miffed. And I put my money where my mouth is - I won‚Äôt order from them anymore.  It‚Äôs a shame I liked their coffee and their presentation.

1330596450963697666 2020-11-23 03:38:09 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @stillgray @RaheemKassam So I guess @blckriflecoffee no longer wants my business.  I‚Äôm a @BlazeTV @theblaze subscriber, and I stand by my choices.
1330578256702164994 2020-11-23 02:25:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Pell_NC I lost total respect for him when he had a podcast with the disgusting Marie Harf - ugh!

1328678091070337027 2020-11-17 20:35:17 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @larryelder When I was young I lived in a 100% white neighborhood in NJ. My school was 100% white. It was ‚ÄúTo Kill A Mockingbird‚Äù that showed me that racism existed and how ugly it is. It made a big impression on me.  I believe that I‚Äôm a better person for having read such an important book

Great book that starts off about Charles Manson but is so, so much more.  A lot of parallels to what‚Äôs going on today. I underlined so many sections that could have been written about the last 4 years.

1325922374110359552 2020-11-10 06:05:03 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @iheartmindy Not a surprise. I refused to give them my dr license info. I was also banned because I changed my email address and when I tried to update my account it thought I was an imposter. So I wanted to delete my account &amp; start over - 3 months later I‚Äôve given up.

1325531263235665921 2020-11-09 04:10:54 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LisaMarieBoothe No for me as well. I have been called racist, homophobic, xenophobic, nazi, white supremacist, deplorable and chump.

I think there are millions who feel the same way, we just have the voice or platform that you do.  I pray that you keep speaking out, because you are speaking for so many of us.  God bless you!
1325465379301429249 2020-11-08 23:49:07 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @marklevinshow Maybe re-think @FoxNews.  I can no longer watch that network and I‚Äôd hate to see your show drop n the ratings over #Foxit

1325435294418661385 2020-11-08 21:49:34 +0800 <Rose_Daro> How stupid do we look to the rest of the world. It‚Äôs embarrassing that the U.S. doesn‚Äôt have specific election laws for a federal Presidential election. I understand the arguments about individual state‚Äôs rights - but it should be different - better - for a Presidential election!

1324814531319746561 2020-11-07 04:42:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SteveDeaceShow I‚Äôm sitting in the parking with my dog, waiting for the vet tech to get her - no ‚Äúhuman‚Äù is permitted in the building. I‚Äôm shocked at all of the people sitting in their cars - by themselves - with masks on. It‚Äôs a gorgeous sunny unseasonably warm day.
1324808484219686912 2020-11-07 04:18:51 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @CawthornforNC Yep. It‚Äôs not rocket science.  Count every legal ballot &amp; double check anything suspect.

1324519258269847553 2020-11-06 09:09:34 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LisaMarieBoothe You are not wrong.  There is a simmer that‚Äôs about to become a raging boil.
1324518911275159554 2020-11-06 09:08:11 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @newsmax @ScottBaio @FoxNews @OANN I watch on Verizon Fios and Pluto TV if that helps.
1324511241344294914 2020-11-06 08:37:42 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @charliekirk11 Keep praying!
1324510813042987009 2020-11-06 08:36:00 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ScottBaio @FoxNews @newsmax @OANN I was initially watching @OANN, but I‚Äôve really been impressed with @newsmax.  Also @BlazeTV is a favorite.
1324510248430915585 2020-11-06 08:33:46 +0800 <Rose_Daro> No more @FoxNews in this household

1324478307669364738 2020-11-06 06:26:50 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Where the fuck are you. Are you standing behind him ready to kick him in the ass to save your own political careers.  You make me sick!
1324476566601084931 2020-11-06 06:19:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @charliekirk11 We need something - that‚Äôs for sure, cause this sucks big time.
1324476427429990403 2020-11-06 06:19:22 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @MikayesFiona Wink wink, they just need to hold on to about 3-4am, when more boxes of Biden votes will be ‚Äúfound‚Äù.

1324475292157726720 2020-11-06 06:14:51 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @CawthornforNC Where are the rest of the GOP members?

1324474188468527105 2020-11-06 06:10:28 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @alexsalvinews @ChanelRion I really hope they get egg on their face.
1324473891885060096 2020-11-06 06:09:18 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @MikayesFiona Yes. He‚Äôs a shrewd business man - not a dunce.  He did what spiteful, jealous, career politician John McCain couldn‚Äôt do.  He did what greasy, sleazy, two faced Mitt Romney couldn‚Äôt do. Not to mention the 15 others on the stage with him. @realDonaldTrump is a fucking genius!
1324472843715923968 2020-11-06 06:05:08 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @marklevinshow That is your most succinct tweet yet!  And so true.
1324472000807641091 2020-11-06 06:01:47 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DavidLimbaugh That is absolutely correct.  And yet I‚Äôm stumped as to why no one holds the accountable - ncluding their GOP counterparts.
1324471537739640832 2020-11-06 05:59:56 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB So heartbreaking. I was on your Zoom call earlier.  Great conversation all around. I‚Äôm new to the group, but really enjoyed hearing the various points of view and everyone‚Äôs thoughts.
1324470855540330496 2020-11-06 05:57:14 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @mschlapp @themarketswork @CPAC Where the hell are they?  It‚Äôs ridiculous.
1324469865118232578 2020-11-06 05:53:17 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JackPosobiec @LindseyGrahamSC Maybe he‚Äôs holding the hand of his good friend lyin‚Äô, hidin‚Äô Biden.  He tries to play both sides. I‚Äôm done listening to anything he has yo say.
1324468664821862400 2020-11-06 05:48:31 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @HeyTammyBruce YES!  We are not going anywhere.
1324467606913503232 2020-11-06 05:44:19 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @MikayesFiona You are the only one on Twitter that has been keeping me from chewing off my fingernails - although I did just order a shit ton of Chinese food for my nervous eating.
1324463760849981444 2020-11-06 05:29:02 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @robsmithonline Amen brother!
1324462559307640832 2020-11-06 05:24:16 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @pnjaban @realDonaldTrump Has @FoxNews retracted Arizona yet?
1324462017315569671 2020-11-06 05:22:06 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SharylAttkisson @realDonaldTrump I hope he does!
1324379637321969666 2020-11-05 23:54:45 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JackPosobiec Thank God and Amen!  @PamBondi
1324377789055803394 2020-11-05 23:47:25 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @shondarhimes Yeah, that Joe Biden sure is a liar and a cheat (and of course we all know he's the p-word, but no one wants to say that out loud).
1324377223340720131 2020-11-05 23:45:10 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LisaMarieBoothe Sorry, but you are being wasted on @foxheadlines - wouldn't be surprised if they are headed for a downfall.  They have very few logical people left.  Starting to sound more like CNN.
1324376911997509640 2020-11-05 23:43:56 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LisaMarieBoothe @johnrich Nashville is pretty awesome - and now has @realDailyWire and soon @RealCandaceO

1324375872435007491 2020-11-05 23:39:48 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @julie_kelly2 How fast they have fallen.  WTF happened over there?
1324375554754289665 2020-11-05 23:38:32 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @AlvedaCKing @realDonaldTrump @WomenForTrump20 @LevellBruce @Franklin_Graham @Jentezen Thank you!  Very much needed right now.
1324375127954522120 2020-11-05 23:36:50 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @AdamCrigler - please call!!!!
1324374697618952194 2020-11-05 23:35:08 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SchmittNYC And I heard that voters wearing MAGA hats were told to take their hats off - the voters - not the poll workers.  Since when does a poll worker tell the average American what they can't wear? It's disgusting.  Wouldn't expect anything else from Philly though.  Crooked to the core.
1324374190850531328 2020-11-05 23:33:07 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RealMiniAOC So prophetic!
1324372513179258881 2020-11-05 23:26:27 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JackPosobiec Definately!
1324372382006550529 2020-11-05 23:25:56 +0800 <Rose_Daro> OMG - so true!  My mother always said - "it's the quiet ones you have to watch".
1324367539556802561 2020-11-05 23:06:41 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @MAJTOURE @kingron_b It‚Äôs been my fear since March.
1324367107249840130 2020-11-05 23:04:58 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB It‚Äôs difficult to de-stress. I feel like my blood is boiling.
1324366832095186946 2020-11-05 23:03:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JackPosobiec @RaheemKassam I would have loved to see that! Just had some WAWA pumpkin spice coffee the other day.
1324364018497277953 2020-11-05 22:52:42 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @AntonioSabatoJr @FoxNews Never.  I‚Äôm a @BlazeTV subscriber and will soon be a @realDailyWire subscriber now that @RealCandaceO has landed there!

1324097989166641154 2020-11-05 05:15:35 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @LisaMarieBoothe It's so disheartening.  How do we ever recover?
1324097611666784256 2020-11-05 05:14:05 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RealAmVoice @RaheemKassam @TheNatPulse Just watched for the first time.  It won't be the last!
1324077184848437248 2020-11-05 03:52:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB I didn't even notice at first üòÇ

1324060187628576769 2020-11-05 02:45:23 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @AdrianNormanDC @bennyjohnson Such a simple solution - and yet Democrats fight it every step of the way.
1324026387750133762 2020-11-05 00:31:04 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @FromKalen No clue, but something certainly needs to change.  Our system is antiquated.
1324025855727775745 2020-11-05 00:28:57 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RCamposDuffy Praying so hard right now.  We‚Äôre tough, but we need help. Prayer is needed to carry our tired bodies and souls over the finish line. ‚úùÔ∏è
1324025348040916993 2020-11-05 00:26:56 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @davidharsanyi We understand.  I feel hungover and I don‚Äôt even drink!
1324025050425659392 2020-11-05 00:25:45 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @GOP I‚Äôm praying that they are the best of the absolute best - and that no one is ready to give in!
1323992585585778689 2020-11-04 22:16:45 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JennaEllisEsq Keep fighting - never give up.  Look over every vote that has been miraculously found.
1323991046389379072 2020-11-04 22:10:38 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RonColeman @DC_Draino Sending prayers your way!
1323986703326076933 2020-11-04 21:53:23 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB I need to learn to meditate. Right now I feel as tightly wound as a clock.  It‚Äôs hurting my head, neck and shoulders.  This isn‚Äôt good.
1323983611750744065 2020-11-04 21:41:06 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ShemekaMichelle YES!

1323847822131777536 2020-11-04 12:41:31 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @marklevinshow She's a jealous fool, just like her husband
1323847595882614785 2020-11-04 12:40:37 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB she has one eye that's larger than the other.  maybe she does that to compensate.

1323794592483942401 2020-11-04 09:10:00 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Had @FoxNews on but was disgusted by their coverage; switched to @OANN, but they are talking all over each other (sorry, I usually like them, but the voices of those 2 women is really grating). Now over to @newsmax - please don't let me down @SchmittNYC

1323251054851563520 2020-11-02 21:10:10 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @wolfblitzer That‚Äôs what happens when you give out participation trophies. No one has learned how to lose.  @realDonaldTrump supporters do not loot and burn.  We know where the violence comes from.
1322993218250772481 2020-11-02 04:05:37 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @GaGirlCindyDawn @dbongino I love @dbongino @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity and @IngrahamAngle - but I can no longer watch @FoxNews - the other shows are intolerable - so I had to make the move.

The format is so different from @FoxNews that it felt kind of weird at first - but their reporting is spot on.  And who doesn't love @JackPosobiec and @ChanelRion?

I predict that @FoxNews falls after this election.  People are fed up with them.  Only one worth watching is @TuckerCarlson
1322876125190737925 2020-11-01 20:20:20 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @FrankelJeremy @marklevinshow @foxnation maybe?

1322352304557858818 2020-10-31 09:38:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @AriFleischer @MZHemingway It‚Äôs a great book. One of my favorites as well.  I think I need a re-read. It‚Äôs been a while.

1322145624788258817 2020-10-30 19:57:35 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @adamhousley Darn, wish I was a wine drinker just to throw your business some support.  It makes me fall asleep.

1322141216960581635 2020-10-30 19:40:04 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @marklevinshow @MagaRo4Trump It‚Äôs despicable what‚Äôs happening in the Jewish community.  I‚Äôm shocked that this could happen in the U.S. As someone who has studied and read extensively on Germany prior to the Holocaust I‚Äôm seeing a disgusting similarity.

1318291375922778114 2020-10-20 04:42:11 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Cernovich Umm, I make a pretty good living at a job I hate.  Was much happier at a different job but didn‚Äôt make anywhere near the money.  I tell young people all the time, never sacrifice happiness for money.  It sucks the life out of you.

1313974705376956416 2020-10-08 06:49:16 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @TonyPaul45 @realDonaldTrump Awesome!
1313970181996269570 2020-10-08 06:31:18 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Travistritt LOL! That‚Äôs awesome

1313906669005475840 2020-10-08 02:18:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @SharylAttkisson Hmmm, not sure I actually believe this.
1313870493884260353 2020-10-07 23:55:10 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @BillHemmer @PARISDENNARD @FoxNews Just wait - people are getting fed up with the direction it‚Äôs moving. I think @OANN will start to bring some competition.  Won‚Äôt happen overnight, but the potential is there. @JackPosobiec is one of the best.  @newsmax is also looking pretty good.
1313687040287019008 2020-10-07 11:46:12 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @pnjaban You go on with your badass self!
1313681113102024706 2020-10-07 11:22:39 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @GenMhayden It‚Äôs all coming out. Bit by bit, in little dribs and drabs - but you need to know one thing - the American people are intelligent enough to put the puzzle pieces together.  You, Obama, Clinton, etc. forgot that.  Kind of dumb on your part.
1313673350800175104 2020-10-07 10:51:48 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @realDonaldTrump @MarkMeadows @senatemajldr @kevinomccarthy @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Yes!  Get it done.

Then he met that horrible woman that he married and they cackled like 2 witches all the way to the White House - our house. But we took it back!
1313567119171350534 2020-10-07 03:49:40 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @MZHemingway Oh no  https://t.co/Z0RwmsCxa3

We moved to @OANN, but they don't have the personality yet that I loved from @FoxNews. I'm giving them a chance.  I watch @BlazeTV.  I used to watch on their app on FireTV, but the picture quality is actually better on PlutoTV, and Pluto also has closed captioning
1313221417299836928 2020-10-06 04:55:59 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @catturd2 @pnjaban I certainly hope so.  Wish I could witness these meltdowns, but @foxnews is no longer welcome in my home.

1312772486702993408 2020-10-04 23:12:05 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @BrandonMONeal @TriaRyder @FoxNews has lost me.  I was getting away from it little by little but Chris Wallace sealed the deal.  I get my unbiased news from @OANN @BlazeTV @AmericasVoice and @JustTheNews, among some others - but Fox News is no longer on 24/7 in my house.
1312738414933020673 2020-10-04 20:56:42 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Joy_Villa @RealWalkAway I watched the entire live stream.  It really was a spectacular event.  God bless!
1312737425760890881 2020-10-04 20:52:46 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @GinaSlyer @Pell_NC I have 4 dogs - they're on it in less than 1 second - so it's pretty much a gonner once it hits the floor.
1312736639236571143 2020-10-04 20:49:38 +0800 <Rose_Daro> It really was a spectacular event.  I was able to watch the live stream, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
1312504918842855425 2020-10-04 05:28:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Hmmm, just got banned from @parler_app - can't imagine why, I'm barely on the site.

1312412856185491456 2020-10-03 23:23:03 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Very nice - you get your badass on!!!

1312409242188611584 2020-10-03 23:08:41 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @UnbiasedKatie Fuck that. I love it when a gentleman holds the door open for me.  It's just polite. In turn, I hold the door for anyone right behind me, and usually if it's a man he will reach up over me to take the door - and then continue to hold it as I walk in.  That's called civility.
1312158283004669953 2020-10-03 06:31:28 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @FLOTUS You and @POTUS are in my prayers! God bless!

1311847101953904641 2020-10-02 09:54:56 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @HinOregon He‚Äôs being pushed to say something that he has really no knowledge of.  This is sad, disgusting, and so frustrating.
1311845950105804801 2020-10-02 09:50:22 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @catturd2 @HinOregon Seriously - did he cry?

My goodness you people are stupid.

1311837144252649474 2020-10-02 09:15:22 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Blues_boyd @Marine4Children @johnrobertsFox .@OANN Just played a very long montage going back to 2016 where @POTUS disavowed KKK, David Dukes and white supremacists - numerous times.  The clip was actually pretty long and covered a long time frame.  But I guess @johnrobertsFox is just plain stupid.
1311836127049981954 2020-10-02 09:11:20 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @my3monkees @Icuducme5 Yes - me too.  I‚Äôm a @BlazeTV subscriber and switched over to @OANN as well.

1311743678692679680 2020-10-02 03:03:58 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @sav_says_ @ElijahSchaffer That‚Äôs such sad news.
1311418643956346881 2020-10-01 05:32:24 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @Pell_NC @JackPosobiec It shows family corruption - that means something.
1311342611815424002 2020-10-01 00:30:16 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @OANN It was pretty evident
1311341212998275074 2020-10-01 00:24:43 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Yep!
1311341123194023936 2020-10-01 00:24:21 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @greta @megynkelly Did the same thing - her first question to @realDonaldTrump was very adversarial.
1311278181152849921 2020-09-30 20:14:15 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JoeBiden No, but you are a colossal one!
1311132551227092992 2020-09-30 10:35:34 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RichardGrenell I‚Äôm so thoroughly disgusted with Wallace
1311131002480271360 2020-09-30 10:29:25 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @kilmeade So disappointed in Chris Wallace - but I had a feeling
1311129894869495810 2020-09-30 10:25:01 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Yep!
1311128299444281344 2020-09-30 10:18:40 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB @realDonaldTrump would win - until it got to the hair pulling - then I‚Äôm not so sure.
1311122342995726336 2020-09-30 09:55:00 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @conservmillen But he is definitely letting Biden speak more
1311122066901475331 2020-09-30 09:53:54 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @kilmeade @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs Chris Wallace. I knew he‚Äôd be a biased hack.
1311117968479223823 2020-09-30 09:37:37 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @megynkelly @AbigailShrier I actually liked it. So sue me.
1311115004645650433 2020-09-30 09:25:51 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @conservmillen I fit into both categories and I think he‚Äôs terrific
1311110336125296641 2020-09-30 09:07:18 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @conservmillen Me too

When your mask gets filled with moist air from your fetid breath, it stops air coming in or out. That leaves the sides of the mask open for the COVID to sneak in. Also, the mask is contaminated as soon as you touch it for any reason. It‚Äôs useless.

1310277376824217600 2020-09-28 01:57:25 +0800 <Rose_Daro> I just blocked the Pope because, well, I just don't like him.  I'm Catholic, but I really don't like this Pope at all.  He's the ultimate SJW.

This conversation should be required watching, listening &amp; learning in all junior and high schools.

He was doing well, but then (IMHO) he was set up or sabotaged by Chris Christie to help Trump - and he never recovered. From then on he became quite a disappointment.  As for McCain - he was such a jealous ass.

Why only the clip, you ask‚Ä¶.because I stopped watching @FoxNews quite awhile ago - like when they added the cheater @donnabrazile and the harpy Marie Harf.  It‚Äôs a shame.

1305578093030117377 2020-09-15 02:44:08 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @molmccann I remember sitting up all night biting my nails down to the nubs. I was so nervous! But when it was finally called that @realDonaldTrump had won I just burst into tears. I was thrilled and felt like I could finally breathe. The 8 years of horrible @BarackObama were finally over!
1305573264073392139 2020-09-15 02:24:57 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @ChristianWalk1r Thank you for always speaking truth.  If I said that, I‚Äôd be called a racist.
1305476104996745219 2020-09-14 19:58:52 +0800 <Rose_Daro> I saw and heard the video. How can the USTA show support for such a hateful group of thugs. I'm disgusted by what I saw during the US Open but chalked it up to pandering, or even worse, ignorance.  You support a group that vehemently hates all white people. Shameful! (4/4)
1305475699478794243 2020-09-14 19:57:15 +0800 <Rose_Daro> Not only were 2 Los Angeles police officers ambushed in their cars, but then BLM protesters stormed the hospital where the officers were transported to for emergency surgery and tried to block them from receiving treatment.  They shouted oink, oink, and hoped that they died.(3/4)
1305475440182800385 2020-09-14 19:56:14 +0800 <Rose_Daro> I'm very disappointed in the USTA's support of the violent organization, Black Lives Matter.  I have been silent on this until today.  Have you read this headline: "Y'all gonna die one by one': BLM activists storm hospital where ambushed officers taken, block exits".  (2/4)
1305475316920586241 2020-09-14 19:55:44 +0800 <Rose_Daro> For all tennis fans or any other sport, I recently contacted the USTA to voice my disgust at their support of BLM during the US Open. If anyone out there feels like I do contact the sport association or team directly.  This thread is a copy of what I sent:  (1/4)

1304389770903252994 2020-09-11 20:02:10 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @deneenborelli Still breaks my heart and brings me to tears.
1304389418963406848 2020-09-11 20:00:46 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JaniceDean You go girl! You seem to be joining the ranks of a reluctant activist - which is how I felt 3 years ago.  Sometimes you have t step out of your comfort zone.  Love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1304388489409171456 2020-09-11 19:57:04 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB Watched last night &amp; Mike‚Äôs vid as well. I‚Äôm so glad you are all safe! What a horrible experience. I‚Äôm so grateful for what you all are doing. Stay safe! Love you all. I‚Äôd love to give you a perspective from someone older who is so worried for our country, but you know, Twitter
1304386791433269248 2020-09-11 19:50:20 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @BrandonStraka I was wondering why I didn‚Äôt see it.
1304386469470130176 2020-09-11 19:49:03 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @RattlerGator I agree with you that they‚Äôve been misled, but I‚Äôll never watch @NFL again. They are grown adults who likely got a free education based on their athletic ability - but they learned absolutely nothing.

1302768506530824193 2020-09-07 08:39:50 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @drrollergator @pnjaban Why are we still allowing this crap to happen?
1302761332622721024 2020-09-07 08:11:20 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @JackPosobiec You should see the commentators at the @usopen this year. Sitting in an open air stadium, all by themselves, and they‚Äôre wearing these gigantic face diapers.  They look like complete assholes.
1302759801949167616 2020-09-07 08:05:15 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @AdamCrigler I certainly hope so.  Unfortunately NJ totally sucks.

1302351175694643213 2020-09-06 05:01:31 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @EricRWeinstein @seanmdav It‚Äôs almost like a lesson on how to take a country that‚Äôs not racist &amp; turn them racist. Which makes me wonder why so much of the violence is coming from white people. Is there a bigger plan in the works that even the black community is unaware of as they may pay the price later?
1302348928302678018 2020-09-06 04:52:35 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @cardlaw35 @realBenjiirby That‚Äôs what I keep telling friends that hate Trump so much.  I disliked Obama so bad - but I waited until the elections and cast my votes.  When that didn‚Äôt work I patiently waited the 8 years for something better. It never occurred to me to burn down the country.

1300948828183502848 2020-09-02 08:09:05 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @EmeraldRobinson Curious to see how the US Open will look now that the @usta has gone full on BLM. For the first time in 20 years I turned it off after the 1st hour &amp; missed the opening ceremony.  I have saved these 2 weeks as my work vacation for 20 yrs. but I couldn‚Äôt stomach it this year.
1300946274766729224 2020-09-02 07:58:56 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @DrKarlynB @BrandonStraka It makes the blood boil, but in the end we really are the better people for not turning into them! Stay strong, stay safe!
1300945763434979328 2020-09-02 07:56:55 +0800 <Rose_Daro> The @usta thinks that @naomiosaka is ‚Äúbrave‚Äù for speaking out about so-called racial injustice.  They‚Äôve draped their stadiums with BLM banners.  I encourage everyone to point out the truth behind that terrorist organization. Apparently they only believe that black lives matter.
1300943953827704833 2020-09-02 07:49:43 +0800 <Rose_Daro> @naomiosaka Remember: Houston man accused of sexually assaulting and killing 9-month-old daughter.  Did her life matter?  https://t.co/ShmyU06klc
