We don‚Äôt have the capacity that we did have (5,500 boats less than the 70‚Äôs) but the agreement suggests we only take back control of some of our fishing over 5.5 years, and the EU continue with the rest

1341022650232147976 2020-12-21 22:08:09 +0800 <lienomail> @mryorkshiretea Estimated average number of jobs per licence, initially, is 8, so that's 3,500+ well paid folks adding value to the economy
1341021724096270337 2020-12-21 22:04:28 +0800 <lienomail> @mryorkshiretea Not my tweet, I dare say it was written from a leftie biased perspective, just like the trade %'s you quoted which was from City AM who in turn were quoting a Munich based 'Think tank' who I'm sure had no bias whatsoever. UK trade with EU is 8.2%
1341019992364597250 2020-12-21 21:57:35 +0800 <lienomail> @mryorkshiretea The UK has to date received 704 applications for Fin Services Licenses to operate in the UK, from Ireland, Germany, Cypress and France alone. There will be others but these are the big four.

Further piece of education, Brexit is a two way street, so always look in both directions.  https://t.co/61AvwwmWnt  Enjoy your tea!  It goes well with remainer tears.

And yes, I know about the Irish lobby, but the support for that is at its lowest point for 100 yrs

Ignoring the fact that UK/Mex balance of trade favours Mex, the UK also invested ¬£8 Biln into Mex businesses last year alone. That's a big deal for Mex to let go

For 4 years you've been saying that the UK will never get a deal with other countries as good as what we had through the EU. And yet we now have agreements in place, with further opportunities to improve them in the future. Remoaners are all in reverse

But the UK is the USA's 5th largest export market at $70 billion so there's incentive enough to get a deal done.

1337305293869477888 2020-12-11 15:56:42 +0800 <lienomail> @iashy @czoyl Because they continually and conspicuously ignore crimes where the people believe the law should be enforced. Two tier, virtue signalling policing has destroyed the respect they once enjoyed.

EVER !    https://t.co/CEeIAduGEY
1335315846844059648 2020-12-06 04:11:21 +0800 <lienomail> @satex @Michael7215 Please explain what that has to do with the figures above ? In case you were unaware Germany is a member of the EU and the export totals shown for the EU include those of Germany, along with the other 27.
1335275417444474892 2020-12-06 01:30:42 +0800 <lienomail> Another valid point to add which is not included in the above figures is the value of British Tourists to the remaining 27 members of the EU. That amounted to Euro 38.7 billion in 2019.

The ECHR was originally drafted by Churchill, Mitterrand &amp; Adenauer along with other parties in 1948. It is a European Law, supported by all 47 members of the Council of Europe, and is a completely different legal system to that of the EU.

In fact here in the US there's lots of talk that Trump may start up such a Party for the 2024 run. People are talking about 'America First Party' or 'MAGA Party' and I can see the groundswell of support for that already MGBGA Party anyone ?
1334522010957983748 2020-12-03 23:36:56 +0800 <lienomail> Media sycophancy is the main reason she avoids criticism. One day they'll grow tired and switch to supporting a different lefty lost cause.

I won't be throwing any more money away unless it's to a party with a full manifesto that I can get behind.

This is a manipulation of the C19 Genome  to create DNA or RNA molecules that deliver ‚Äòinformation‚Äô to cells to produce antigens to stimulate the immune system. It‚Äôs 10 yr old tech but will be the 1st approval

This is a Genetic Vax which uses mRNA to trick cells into acting ‚Äòdifferently‚Äô. It is the future of vaccines but none have ever been approved. The original tweet was about the failure to adequately trial a new technology !
1333049677072232449 2020-11-29 22:06:24 +0800 <lienomail> @j2502ackie @TraceyLockyer Yep! Exactly what I said in my tweet üôÑ. My point was about trial results and how they can be erroneous. And it‚Äôs not about data collection, sometimes the trial can be flawed from the very beginning. Thalidomide trialed for 5 yrs but not on pregnant women, the intended recipients

How many times have you seen trials being halted because something unexpected occurred, months or even years into the study. Just saying üòä
1333008681961656320 2020-11-29 19:23:30 +0800 <lienomail> @Denise_Fleig @Sprinter0712 @TraceyLockyer Sorry if you misinterpreted my intent, it was not to criticise you at all. I was merely pointing out what I believe is an indecent rush to validate these vaccines. My jaundiced eye tells me that the first to market will make a killing. Hopefully not literally.
1333007299661750273 2020-11-29 19:18:00 +0800 <lienomail> @RobertRees_ @PrincessofWails @TraceyLockyer That was not my point Rob. It was not appropriately tested at the time for it‚Äôs intended purpose, otherwise they would have realised after 9 months. The current vaccines as per Pfizer, have only been trialed for 60 days &amp; the AZ one only tested on under 55‚Äôs. That concerns me.
1333004416589369345 2020-11-29 19:06:33 +0800 <lienomail> @Cybeeria @sarahisitme It‚Äôs the @sarahisitme account that is locked, not mine. Frankly I don‚Äôt understand why those who lock their accounts ever join in debates on here, it makes no sense to me
1333003007672377344 2020-11-29 19:00:57 +0800 <lienomail> @Denise_Fleig @TraceyLockyer I know Denise, I work in biotech, which is why I am concerned about the unbelievably short timelines for the trials.
1332999295604301824 2020-11-29 18:46:12 +0800 <lienomail> @sarahisitme @Cybeeria Do you understand how RNA works?  It changes the cell process to influence protein production. Call it what you will, but it‚Äôs still genetic manipulation
1332996896449843200 2020-11-29 18:36:40 +0800 <lienomail> @mark1854now @tweetandshort @TraceyLockyer Exactly!  I would not put my signature to any trial that concluded after just two months.
1332996069828009984 2020-11-29 18:33:23 +0800 <lienomail> @sarahisitme @Cybeeria It‚Äôs late here &amp; I‚Äôm tired, so I‚Äôve only scan read this, but I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by different. All the soon to appear vaccines are based on RNA gene manipulation, just like Thalidomide was. Yes dev has been going for 10+ years, but so far nothing has been approved for use.
1332992282514100232 2020-11-29 18:18:20 +0800 <lienomail> @Parkerbats Hahaha!  No, as a kid I was lucky to have any new clothes at all, let alone a Super Hero outfit.
1332991535739269120 2020-11-29 18:15:22 +0800 <lienomail> @Cybeeria Clearly not tested on the very patients it was intended to help, otherwise they would have realised it was a flawed drug after 9 months, let alone 5 years

Plus, old tweets were always available on the wayback machine, but sadly no more
1332984650780848130 2020-11-29 17:48:01 +0800 <lienomail> From now until the end of December, every time I see or hear folks telling me that 'Boris' is going to let us down, I'm going to think about yesterdays tweet from David Frost.  https://t.co/gsibAhoBBV

1332980358900568064 2020-11-29 17:30:57 +0800 <lienomail> @companyu @TraceyLockyer @PaulLeMay16 This is definitely not like your regular flu shot Malc. It is a huge leap forward in how vaccines have historically worked, by manipulating the genetic code. It is the future of vaccines but this will be the first approval, &amp; please note, the Pfizer trial only lasted two month.
1332976858107961344 2020-11-29 17:17:03 +0800 <lienomail> @TraceyLockyer Yep! Before my time but I have a friend who was born with severe deformities, which made me research it.

1332972996970078209 2020-11-29 17:01:42 +0800 <lienomail> @TraceyLockyer I am reminded of the drug Thalidomide which was insufficiently tested &amp; subsequently caused hugely devastating reactions in the 60's  That too worked on the principle of Gene manipulation, which resulted in a wide spectrum of birth defects.  Drug validations should not be rushed

I answered that tweet, and then you jumped in without knowing why.

Or so the story goes, but this year it was Trump who won big, so I'm guessing there was not as much manipulation in previous election counts.   https://t.co/G0S1JpI8FL via @ABC

1327868562590019586 2020-11-15 14:58:30 +0800 <lienomail> @HThe77th @ubereats_fr As far as I know Uber Eats has been a separate company to Uber ride sharing for the last 2 or 3 years, but I can‚Äôt find any evidence of accounts being published during  that time.

Well, they‚Äôve been offered asylum, security, freedom of expression and a chance to earn a living, plus other state benefits, so I‚Äôm thinking a little gratitude should be expected at the very least. Certainly not food poisoning.

I've seen the fraud first hand, so I get it that you Dems are starting to panic, and throwing as much shade as you can. If Trump flips this election the lefty meltdown will be epic.

It can be a very empty echo chamber. Even 'Celebs' get very little response to some of their posts, whereas on twitter they would be hitting 10,000's

1327185302423818240 2020-11-13 17:43:28 +0800 <lienomail> Last thought before bed. We all love Twitter but hate how the Twatter police control the narrative these days. The only effective way to return them to neutrality is to hit them where it hurts, in their profits. We should all block each and every advertiser appearing on our TL‚Äôs

If they don‚Äôt, they will soon be found out and fail. We are all awake to the manipulation now
1326770766747217920 2020-11-12 14:16:15 +0800 <lienomail> The way we consume news is about to change forever. Once the truth of this election surfaces media power will crumble to ash.

1326766266397433858 2020-11-12 13:58:22 +0800 <lienomail> More blatant twisting of the news by MSM. CBS used an image (1) cropped from a Trump rally (2) to claim that it showed huge Latino support for Biden. The actual Biden rally was in an empty hall (3).

1325650757614448645 2020-11-09 12:05:44 +0800 <lienomail> @GerhardMack1 @NateWeymouth Trumps lawyers argued that observers were not allowed to oversee the voting as per legal statute, State countered by saying they were allowed in the room. Trumps team said they were not close enough to observe the ballots. The Judge asked were they in the room, yes or no. End of!

This was not a celebration in praise of Biden at all, it is to celebrate the 1605 defeat of a catholic plot to overthrow the Government. It's a 400 year old tradition.

1324876312675233794 2020-11-07 08:48:22 +0800 <lienomail> @BiscAnenome I used the actual figures for REGISTERED VOTERS, your calculation used the number of people of voting age. Only registered voters can turn out to vote and of those 90% did.

This year it is an unprecedented 90%, giving Biden the win by just 0.016%.  Who knew that their predictive algorithms for precisely how many ballots it would take to win  could be so accurate.
1324772427327483905 2020-11-07 01:55:34 +0800 <lienomail> @sqwawk Common sense would say not, but apparently certain folk are vehemently against anyone trying to check a few votes to confirm that they are indeed genuine and verifiable. What are they afraid of ?

It‚Äôs almost as if they knew who the votes were for ü§î
1324187681115525121 2020-11-05 11:12:00 +0800 <lienomail> @HowarthWass Yeah! Trump was up 13.7% in PA earlier today, now it‚Äôs down to 3%. They‚Äôll keep counting until they‚Äôve found enough votes to seal the deal for Sleepy Joe

So many countries will now be looking to exploit this situation, &amp; a UK/US trade deal is down the toilet

Their ultimate objective was to brainwash enough weak minded people in the hope of preventing a second term. Today they succeeded &amp; are  now drunk on their success
1324136186747752449 2020-11-05 07:47:22 +0800 <lienomail> If you were wondering how fake votes can be introduced into the counting system, just check out this report to see how easy it is.

1324132815710146560 2020-11-05 07:33:59 +0800 <lienomail> @how_rhodri That was 13 hrs ago Taffy, while you were busy chasing the sheep up and down the valleys with your trousers round your ankles  And certainly long before sacks full of 'misplaced' votes started turning up with Sleepy Joe's name on them.

1324124699392122882 2020-11-05 07:01:44 +0800 <lienomail> Interesting titbit I just found whilst fact checking.  Earlier we heard that 180,000+ votes had been found in Wisconsin. The voter turnout in WI was the highest ever, a full 5% more that the previous record set in '96. 5% of the registered electorate just happens to be 184,236
1324117633705398272 2020-11-05 06:33:39 +0800 <lienomail> I have to apologise for this tweet. This morning Trump was so far ahead in MI that I honestly didn‚Äôt believe he could be caught with so few votes remaining to be counted. I did not forseee almost every single one of those outstanding votes having Biden name on them
1324020041541705729 2020-11-05 00:05:51 +0800 <lienomail> @SimonIckeUK God I love keyboard warriors who are always so clever AFTER the event. It takes a special kind of delusion to think anybody cares what you have to say. Either say it before or bst at all.
1324016286020624384 2020-11-04 23:50:56 +0800 <lienomail> @SimonIckeUK Easy to say now but 6 hrs ago Michigan was Trumps with only 10% left to count. Who knew they'd keep finding shed loads of votes from the bottom of Bidens garden.
1323981842354184192 2020-11-04 21:34:04 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 MI is now 0.5% for Trump. A nail biter, but he's come back 0.2% in the last hour.
1323980740644773888 2020-11-04 21:29:41 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 MI is now the big doubt. The Dems can see it will give Biden the victory and they will keep finding votes until he does
1323980284866551814 2020-11-04 21:27:52 +0800 <lienomail> @brickypaul Very volatile at the moment. Changing all the time
1323979067616645120 2020-11-04 21:23:02 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 Biden needs MI, NV &amp; WI to give him 270 seats. WI is moving his way, NV too close to call, 0.6% to Biden. MI Trump leads by 0.3% up from 0.2% an hour ago. Too close for comfort.
1323964108744597504 2020-11-04 20:23:36 +0800 <lienomail> @brickypaul Is that a Paddy Power teaser ?   Oddschecker, which tabulates all major betting sites has Trump as the overwhelming favourite. Odds on at 8/15 with Biden now out at 13/5. Having said all this, Michigan has just closed the gap to only 0.2% lead for Trump. Game changer maybe?
1323960058187780096 2020-11-04 20:07:30 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 That's a 0.1% narrowing of the gap, There's still a 1.2% differential. 634k votes still to count, Trump would have to lose 571k of them to close that gap. I'm still confident.
1323958200635412480 2020-11-04 20:00:07 +0800 <lienomail> @Steve1973x Exactly, in fact it could be more than a 20 seat margin. But we can't second guess what might be found at the last minute. Right now though I'm pretty confident. The eyes of the world are on them.
1323957490355212288 2020-11-04 19:57:18 +0800 <lienomail> @rtsuppliesltd I've been watching all night and not seen that 100K increase, It's been close all the way through, Biden currently leads by 7k votes with 84,000 still to be counted. I already gave WI to Biden in my calculations, worth 10 seats.
1323955103519461377 2020-11-04 19:47:49 +0800 <lienomail> @Jamieburton13 WI has been neck and neck all evening ?   Biden currently leads by 0.3%

1323951693797744640 2020-11-04 19:34:16 +0800 <lienomail> @kjlherbalife @aley_aa I've already counted that as a Biden win even though it's still close
1323951115726106624 2020-11-04 19:31:58 +0800 <lienomail> @JohnBroadhead15 I've conceded WI &amp; NV to Biden although both are too close to call at +0.3% &amp; +0.6% respectively. PA is Trumps +12.6%, GA he's +2.2%, MI +1.4%, NC +1.4%,  That's all that remains.
1323949011481600005 2020-11-04 19:23:36 +0800 <lienomail> @Steve1973x Associated Press. They are not so biased in their reporting. Search '2020 US Election results' &amp; select 'All States' Scroll down for up to the minute data.
1323948225674530816 2020-11-04 19:20:29 +0800 <lienomail> @Daverjr Biden only leads in Nevada by 0.6% &amp; Wisconsin by 0.3%, Trump leads in all the remaining States. Pennsylvania is out of sight for Biden, Trump leads there by 12.6%. That's 20 seats. MI &amp; NC are the tightest where Trump has 1.4% lead in both. 31 seat at stake in these two
1323946212727361538 2020-11-04 19:12:29 +0800 <lienomail> @Daverjr It's currently 238/213 to Biden, still some big numbers to come in
1323945774124814340 2020-11-04 19:10:44 +0800 <lienomail> @aley_aa I already counted Nevada for Biden even though he only has a 0.6% lead. The only other State he has a clear lead is Wisconsin together worth 16 seat . Trump leads in all the others. Georgia, Michigan, N.Carolina, Pennsylvania, together worth 67 seats. Could even be 280/254

1323934708925956097 2020-11-04 18:26:46 +0800 <lienomail> I think we can call this now for Trump. Unless there's something really dramatic happens with 'surprise votes' Trump had been relected by at least a 275 to 264 margin.

So many folk in the US had got well paid jobs for the first time in decades and the spiral was only heading upwards. C19 was the silver bullet &amp; not just for Dems but China too

Most Dems are all of that and more.

Many families have the same circumstances and the same incomes, but provide very different outcomes for their kids. Poverty of parenting skills is very real. Lifestyle choices cost money.

1319787437938323459 2020-10-24 07:47:00 +0800 <lienomail> @jessphillips You are confusing poor with lazy and feckless. They are not the same and they don‚Äôt have the same end results for their kids. I experienced that up to the time I was adopted and then discovered real love and affection even though we were poor.

Not adults.  Schools would be an ideal location. But parental education is the ultimate solution. Ask any teacher about kids arriving a school not having eaten at all.

There is no guarantee that it would provide even one more slice of bread on the table. And politicising it not any sort of solution, it requires a new way to address this malaise that is affecting how children are neglected
1319765338326708231 2020-10-24 06:19:11 +0800 <lienomail> @HowarthWass I agree entirely Antonia

But this living in poverty label is just an excuse for parents who cannot put their kids first. Bad parenting should not be excused or defended.

Kayleigh actually got banned, but she piled her lawyers on it and get reinstate. Jack D apologised today for twitters actions, said it was wrong. Too bloody true it was.

1317156871036456960 2020-10-17 01:34:04 +0800 <lienomail> @bear44willis Building the fishing industry back to a sustainable level will take at least 5 years, in the meantime we still need fish on our dining tables. They have to come from somewhere so not fishing at all for three years is not a workable plan. We control the EU catch while we rebuild
1317127655259590657 2020-10-16 23:37:58 +0800 <lienomail> @bear44willis Where does the shortfall on landed fish come from in that ‚Äòbuilding up‚Äô period? Buy them from the EU?  What do you think they will be charging us, unless an agreed price is part of their licence to fish our waters during a transition towards a full U.K. only fleet catch

1317120417845415936 2020-10-16 23:09:13 +0800 <lienomail> @saxon_angelo I agree on the transition of fishing waters even though I got loads of abuse on here for saying it. We don‚Äôt have a big enough fleet to fish our own waters yet. We are 5,000+ boats short of what we had in the 80‚Äôs and that probably equates to 500,000 tonnes of fish. It takes time

It will be a thread of three tweets starting with a cost analysis of total lifetime costs divided by the amount of energy produced. That's the only way to assess real value for money. See below.  https://t.co/bT2kB24DoA
1313820198177329154 2020-10-07 20:35:19 +0800 <lienomail> @CanderUK @JeremyCordite No! I'm being deliberately factual. The total generating capacity from all renewables, including wind, is 25% of demand, Nuclear gives 19%, coal provides 9% but natural gas is the largest contributor of all at 43%. The remaining 4% is derived from other sources.
1313801463664123905 2020-10-07 19:20:52 +0800 <lienomail> @mitsyarty Yet another classic Jo. You never cease to amaze me.

The process only delivers energy levels at 80% of the total electricity energy used. Steam powered reformers are even worse at only 65% efficiency
1313790039495712769 2020-10-07 18:35:29 +0800 <lienomail> @CanderUK @JeremyCordite Not sure if you deleted your previous tweet, but your reply was a repeat of my tweet. As for 'potential energy' storage at night, presumably for hydro power reservoirs, what happens when the wind doesn't blow? And how many turbines are needed for one hydroelectric generator?
1313783101751992320 2020-10-07 18:07:55 +0800 <lienomail> @copyrightismine @Wetwinter1 And the point of the original tweet was about the lack of a white history month, your point was ????
1313781194652372992 2020-10-07 18:00:20 +0800 <lienomail> @CanderUK @JeremyCordite It is my understanding that Dinorwig is a Hydroelectricity generator. The storage you mentioned is water storage not electricity. The water in the reservoirs can be release in minutes to boost electricity generation.
1313779388434075649 2020-10-07 17:53:09 +0800 <lienomail> @twitone As with all self proclaimed 'liberal elite' you cannot hide your disdain for the working class, but in your rush to signal how woke and virtuous you are, you completely missed the point of the original tweet. This is happening now, not in some Dickensian past.
1313773847787732992 2020-10-07 17:31:08 +0800 <lienomail> @JeremyCordite 2/2  Wind Turbines are by definition unreliable. No wind, no power. They are also expensive to build, cannot be recycled and environmentally damaging. 100% wind power would always need 100% back up from fossil fuel or nuclear generators to avoid black outs.
1313772544437235712 2020-10-07 17:25:57 +0800 <lienomail> @JeremyCordite Electricity can be stored in batteries, but in terms of the capacity needed for the national Grid, that is an impossibility. It can be converted into Hydrogen but the cost implications mean it would only ever be viable for powering transport. 1/2

White working class boys are the most ignored, underprivileged and disadvantage group in the country Nothing has been done by successive governments to address that situation, but instead pour resources into minorities

1305390514930417665 2020-09-14 14:18:46 +0800 <lienomail> This is horrendous, a nightmare for all police patrol officers. Both cops suffered multiple gunshot wounds and are in critical condition. No named suspect yet, but to me this looks like a 12 or 13 year old carrying out the attack, not an adult. Could be gang initiation test?

I.e. Age and Skin tone. If you are ok with that then god help you.

It‚Äôs pretty demeaning if someone has to be fired in order for you to be given their job, it sort of indicates you were not good enough to win in the first place based, on your own merits and ability.

1305075633207357442 2020-09-13 17:27:32 +0800 <lienomail> @CameronChesters Not at all, I‚Äôm triggered by the current woke practice of people using their jobs because of their skin colour. If you think that is acceptable then you my friend are a racist

In Lombardy, officially one in six of the population are immigrants, but there are also huge numbers of illegals, mostly Chinese, who are not recorded.
