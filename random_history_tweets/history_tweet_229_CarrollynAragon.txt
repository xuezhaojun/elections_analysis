1342550024295596032 2020-12-26 03:17:23 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @tedlieu Merry Christmas sir to you and yours.
1342546184850743296 2020-12-26 03:02:08 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> It's my birthday today. I turned 64. My birthday wish, everyone stay safe, treat each other with love &amp; kindness and please wear a mask so that everyone right now will be here for Christmas 2021. Thank you to everyone who has kept me sane this year. I appreciate everyone of you.

1342302139960487948 2020-12-25 10:52:23 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @laurenboebert Shame on you pretending to be an American who ran to represent Americans and then saying fuck you to the 8 million Americans who voted legally for Biden. Those Americans will not forget. You are being disingenuous and will pay next voting period.
1342300458249932800 2020-12-25 10:45:42 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Holmesdonna1 @laurenboebert Typing a lie from a liar doesn't make it true it just helps those of us with bad eyesight see your stupidity better. This has been proven a lie. The machine and the PAPER ballots had the exactly same vote count. You obviously have no idea how the machines work.
1342262683253395461 2020-12-25 08:15:36 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @JimBelushi It back! and also Merry Christmas to you and yours.

There are no leaders. No groups that roam the streets like thugs carrying gun and burning churches. No deaths or arrests. Strange.
1340043476000333824 2020-12-19 05:17:16 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @crymeariver6666 I still do.

1338631900030636033 2020-12-15 07:48:10 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @TheRealHoarse I believe that. They just didn't expect the votes to be so high in states they tried to screw over the voters with suppression tactics. They were probably hoping those states would be a few hundred vote differences not thousands. Easy to over turn 1 state not 4.

1337507824973189121 2020-12-12 05:21:29 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Realmommabear @SpockResists Apparently Bill Pascrell from New Jersey tweeted that he demands none of those who signed onto this act of sedition not be sworn in.

No one should have McConnell's power.

Only democrats get drug supplies from China and India because the ingredients needed are cheaper therefore they are bought and paid for? Do you know how insane you sound?

It's the republicans who are not part of these seditious acts need to grow a pair. Why is it always up to the democrats to clean up after the republicans constantly shit on the  constitution and country and rob the coffers.

She never took an oath not even at the fake :hearing" rudy held at that hotel. Democrats tried to get them to take the oath but republicans wouldn't allow it.
1337264953938460672 2020-12-11 13:16:24 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Apostrobitch @StevenBeschloss Were they under oath when they lied?
1337263332517052417 2020-12-11 13:09:58 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Acyn He is not just fishing for a pardon he is using a super trawler which is capable of holding 7,000 tonnes of bullshit in order to get that pardon.
1337262243377864704 2020-12-11 13:05:38 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @pablodrohan @SenSchumer Jerked up? Whatever that is. I'm not nervous I'm just astounded at the stupidity and turning a blind eye to the obvious truth. It is just mind boggling.
1337257599264149506 2020-12-11 12:47:11 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @pablodrohan @SenSchumer Yu are insane. If there was proof of that the courts would have been shown that in the 53 case brought before them. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE because it never happened. Even rudy said in court it wasn't about fraud. The supreme court told trump to fuck off.
1337256941492453376 2020-12-11 12:44:34 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @kevindandy1 @SenSchumer For the love of god just shut up.

1337250466044891137 2020-12-11 12:18:50 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @christina_bobb What evidence is that? Hunter Biden is having his taxes looked into and last time I checked he is a private citizen and no one cares about his taxes.  If there was any voter fraud trump and his lawyers wouldn't have lost 53 court cases and told to f off by the supreme court.

That is what the Democrats meant and oddly enough that means putting more money into it to have people best suited to go to domestics etc.

Kids in cages, deportation, unjustly shot and killed by cops etc. They see trump survived so they think it won't happen to them only to POC or old.
1336402015455309825 2020-12-09 04:07:24 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @HillReporter Probably because we all know that excepting a pardon is an admission of guilt. Wowie getting paid the big bucks for stating the obvious. Innocent people don't need to be pardoned.

It used to be for gas but most of us don't own a car. Come to think of it he still gives us gas cards only the gas comes in a different form.

1336102998330593281 2020-12-08 08:19:13 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SurRealityChek @joncoopertweets As for push back against McConnel at that time. If Obama couldn't get McConnel to do a bipartisan announcement about Russia what chance do you think Comey had. Do you get why Dems need the Senate/dethrone McConnel. Exactly how much power that putrid self named grim reaper has?
1336100330262544384 2020-12-08 08:08:36 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SurRealityChek @joncoopertweets His cave wasn't along party lines it is in the job description.  I hate what he did. I hate who ever leaked the info. I do however understand why Comey did what he did. The one who leaked is the one who you should focus your legitimate anger on starting with Ghouliani.
1336080273264398336 2020-12-08 06:48:54 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MindfulMajority @realTuckFrumper @business The reason Tillerson was put into trumps cabinet in the beginning to help get putins 500 billion oil deal done in Alaska. His useful idiot is doing his bidding without Tillerson unless he (Tillerson) has been working on it still in the back ground.
1336079063841001472 2020-12-08 06:44:06 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SurRealityChek @joncoopertweets Yes Ghouliani started it. Remember he was bragging on fox long before the leak that there would be an October surprise. The Ny fbi had the laptop for weeks before they told Comey about it.
1336078441007857665 2020-12-08 06:41:38 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SurRealityChek @joncoopertweets Who I don't know but due to their loyalty to trump and all of the shenanigans Nunes did I would pick him. Think who was in power at the time.   Obama wanted to do a bipartisan announcement but McConnel told Obama to keep his mouth shut.
1336077461272989697 2020-12-08 06:37:44 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SurRealityChek @joncoopertweets Because a republican leaked it to the press about the laptop. Comey only had to brief the Reps. They forced his hand to tell the public what exactly happened. That there was COPIES  of previous found emails.
1336032611337007104 2020-12-08 03:39:31 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> Is #InmateIvanka trending?
1336031436697083904 2020-12-08 03:34:51 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SurRealityChek @joncoopertweets Comey reported it to the republicans first who held the hearings about Clinton because he had to. Someone on the republican side then leaked that info forcing comey to make a public statement. I hate that he did it but he had no choice.
1336030483293982720 2020-12-08 03:31:04 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SurRealityChek @joncoopertweets I hate, what Comey did but you are wrong about why he did the announcement. He told the senate he found Clinton did nothing that was worth arresting her for but if he found anything else had to tell them right away.  Which he did. It was a republican who leaked about the laptop.

1331666127408099331 2020-11-26 02:28:40 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @PamBorgelt @realTuckFrumper Was just curious because a lot of people were asking me. I know it's a circle jerk but some don't.
1331665250484031489 2020-11-26 02:25:11 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @realTuckFrumper Curious if these "witnesses" are under oath?
1331664655614308352 2020-11-26 02:22:49 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @LaurToronto4 He can't do that anymore than trump could go after Hillary. They can not go after their political opponents. He will let the DOJ do their job and if they see fit they will go after him.
1331634252769751042 2020-11-26 00:22:01 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @LLinWood You are on a computer obviously since we are reading your tripe. Google it and TADA the names of those infected pops up. I would copy/paste the names here for you but then you wouldn't increase your IQ by a point. Stop proving trump right about his followers having low IQ.
1331631082605740035 2020-11-26 00:09:25 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MeidasTouch Why? Because they think their viewers are stupid and have short memories? Because they have the attention span of a gnat? Because they know they can manipulate them to think one way one day and completely the opposite the next? Oh Ok I get their logic.
1331629045088362498 2020-11-26 00:01:19 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @roper_93 And we still wouldn't only you brought it up again. Do you want to start another but her email rhetoric? Let sleeping dogs lie.
1331496527479459840 2020-11-25 15:14:44 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @calvinzbest1 Unless or until they themselves are hit with covid-19 upside their heads they will deny covid-19 exists although some have proven even on their death beds they will still deny it. The brain washing is deep. Some are just to far gone to help. All you can do is be there and pray.

1331452178540556295 2020-11-25 12:18:31 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @TomJChicago @mdjacksondallas People need to realize that it will take time. It will not be instantaneous. I wish it would be but...

He is the disgruntled employee. He has a Hugh grudge against Hillary and the Dems.. Powell his lawyer is the biggest mouthpiece for Q.

Every single court case except 1 has been thrown out, withdrawn or not proven because there is no evidence. You know the American people are not as stupid as you think they are.

Bawk is what a chicken literally says &amp; also means to stop, as at an obstacle, refuse to proceed or to do something specified  He balked at making the speech. (of a horse, mule, etc.) to stop short and stubbornly refuse to go on

1327776816254238720 2020-11-15 08:53:56 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @AbbyJohnson Jesus is with you not in a building. If you want to meet Jesus in person just keep it up because if you gather in groups you stand the chance of doing just that. That is probably ok with you but you don't have the right to play god over others lives by putting them on jeopardy.

1327762216339132416 2020-11-15 07:55:55 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @DemocracyInn He could pardon himself but that would only cover federal crimes not state. Also with a pardon comes the lose of his 5th amendment rights. Same for anyone else he pardons. It is an admission of guilt.    Oh and there are a boat load of state crimes.

Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, &amp; manipulation of the media.

1314694707801321472 2020-10-10 06:30:18 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @HKrassenstein If he is tested positive can he still vote for Supreme Court nominee?
1314693875890413568 2020-10-10 06:27:00 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MeidasTouch He can't admit he has it because that would nix him from going in person to vote for Supreme Court vote I would think.

I'm guessing a 8 ft. by 6 ft. deep, long lasting impression. One that even their children, families and friends might even share if you know what I mean.

1314676429385355264 2020-10-10 05:17:40 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @DrPresage Maria Antoinette is famous for "Let them eat cake" while her people were dying from starvation due to lack of bread.  Trump will be famous for "Let them breathe Covid" while his people are dying from lack of PPE and unaffordable drugs.

1313245536107991040 2020-10-06 06:31:49 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MeidasTouch How many other survivor of Covid-19 have said don't be afraid of it. How many honest people have said that.

Guests were able to speak with Trump during the photo opportunity. So there was 60 or 206?

It looks like a don't vote at all Gif. Really stupid and irresponsible even for a parody group trying to get voters to vote. They went to far.

1312800431588876288 2020-10-05 01:03:08 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Acosta Could it be trump wants them to be upbeat and saying that he will be released soon because the stock market opens on Monday?

1312797131615293441 2020-10-05 00:50:01 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @maggieNYT So it wasn't the Airmen, Marines or the cops kissing or hugging trump? Hicks is pissed off she was used as the scapegoat

They did this bullying trying to make Biden lose his train of thought and look senile. This was Christies plan of attack against Biden and thankfully it didn't work. This is unpresidential behavior.

Only the Biden side kept their masks on before during and after the debate.

Ivanka is surprising given how daddy loves his girl.    Eric &amp; Jr. I'm not surprised trump wouldn't be caught near them except for photo ops.   The turtle is to slow to catch anything IMO

If it hadn't been for a Bloomberg reporter we probably still wouldn't know. Trump didn't make that tweet about him and malaria to be transparent he made it because he was outed by the free press.

1312420695880597505 2020-10-03 23:54:12 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @politvidchannel Karma is a bitch. He promoted the idea to bully a stutterer on a global stage to make him look senile and it backfire. Bigly. Sad.  "You have nothing to talk about so just go out there and yell none stop because doing that to a stutterer causes them to lose train of thought".

Stutterers know if you keep interrupting &amp; yelling at them they lose train of thought. Your vile tactics failed &amp; Karma is a bitch. .

1312406187866947585 2020-10-03 22:56:33 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @thedailybeast HOLY SHIT. BUT HIS TEXT MESSAGES. STOP THE PRESSES. Are you shitting me. Other than the spouse who gives a fling fuck about text messages.  I don't care.
1312404887133544452 2020-10-03 22:51:23 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Roshan_Rinaldi “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” Many QAnon believers interpreted “together” as “to get her,” “her” meaning Hillary Clinton.   Is she still running for Prez?
1312401714159341568 2020-10-03 22:38:46 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> Honestly where do these people come from. This is insanity.   https://t.co/kWbyzLavPA
1312400169468477441 2020-10-03 22:32:38 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @jrgaillot @JoeBiden Yes. If it was reversed? Come on now...
1312397747165646853 2020-10-03 22:23:00 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @FordJohnathan5 @TCanseeyou Well that can't be good. He needs to be healthy so he can serve out his prison sentence.
1312395114732380161 2020-10-03 22:12:33 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MelloMillett @faithinbones @dvglasgow Hillary Clinton stumbling during a 9/11 ceremony after she had been diagnosed with pneumonia. "She's supposed to fight all these different things, and she can't make it 15 feet to her car," Trump said. Do you see Joe Biden do that? No

1312293430677045248 2020-10-03 15:28:29 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @SpockResists @cjnfamily Just like they demanded trump do when Hillary caught pneumonia on this exact day in 2016.  Oh ya no, no they didn't. trump made fun of her and told her to drop out.
1312292061408686080 2020-10-03 15:23:03 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @delsuite She is right there at the bottom of the photo with it off which as you say is worse.   She never wore it on stage after the debate either.  https://t.co/AaTb8zUr8u
1312290940850061312 2020-10-03 15:18:36 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @delsuite Key word was she took it off.  https://t.co/MEymeSeQtj
1312290672842424321 2020-10-03 15:17:32 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @delsuite They are all bottom feeding scum.
1312289833688080385 2020-10-03 15:14:12 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @delsuite She took her mask off. They all did except for the Biden side. This was just seconds before she did.
1312289311316795392 2020-10-03 15:12:07 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @stucam7771 I hope he isn't sick. I hope it is a scam. I want him to be so humiliated by crushing him in a Biden landslide victory and then drag his nasty ass off to prison. The lot of them.
1312287854001750017 2020-10-03 15:06:20 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @donwinslow @Eleven_Films Know why trump did this to Biden &amp; who's idea it was? Christe. He knows Biden stutters. By bombarding a stutterer it causes them to lose their train of thought thus making him look senile. They used They used his affliction against him like bullies on a playground. That is vile.
1312284936934617088 2020-10-03 14:54:44 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @GretchenCarlson And put VP Biden at risk.
1312284441465614340 2020-10-03 14:52:46 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @JesseLehrich And they all now have pre-existing conditions.
1312283995917279233 2020-10-03 14:51:00 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @KamalaHarris @philnurenberg We are also keeping them in out thoughts just not the same way you are.

1312278177645903877 2020-10-03 14:27:53 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Winzol Well if it wasn't for the reporter from Bloomberg we wouldn't have know. trump never said anything until they got outed.
1312277771247218688 2020-10-03 14:26:16 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @cwilhelm2014 @Winzol Only if it's fox news. This is far too urgent. I don't agree.
1312276857199325184 2020-10-03 14:22:38 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Winzol It's not the medias fault it's trumps staff that are blocking everyone from knowing.

1312275797546135552 2020-10-03 14:18:25 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @GOPLeader Kevin when god was giving out brains did you think he said trains and asked for a slow one?

1312273917017354245 2020-10-03 14:10:57 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> Crawling in the gutter and bullying because the can't win on there accomplishments or merits. Bullying a stutterer to cheat.

1312254072389431296 2020-10-03 12:52:06 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @jaketapper Did he mishandle a virus resulting in over 200.000 American lives being lost, Millions sick and unemployed?  Thousands unable to pay the rent or buy food? No? Then who gives a shit.
1312252939059171328 2020-10-03 12:47:35 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @jaketapper Don't care.
1312246736019058688 2020-10-03 12:22:56 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MarrtyW She is the scape goat. Also the Airmen, Marines and police who according to trump can't stop kissing and hugging him. I'm not being snarky. That is what he said.
1312244626837831681 2020-10-03 12:14:34 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @aboIishamerica Be very careful what you say. twitter is banning left and right anyone wishing or even suggesting ill will towards trump. Just saying.

1312239852398628865 2020-10-03 11:55:35 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MysterySolvent Same as usual. "It is what it is" Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of folks.

1312235843608748034 2020-10-03 11:39:39 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @RaeMargaret61 Talk about karma. One this exact day 4 years ago. Hillary got sick with pneumonia. Remember she stumble getting into her car. trump made fun of her. Told her to drop out of the race. Did anyone say "Oh we should suspend campaigning for 2 wks". Did the right send well wishes. No.
1312230990014681088 2020-10-03 11:20:22 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @RayHarwick @chrislhayes So only in the movies then. Dang it we were all hoping and no it wasn't sarcasm.

1312205607533903877 2020-10-03 09:39:31 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @AmyAThatcher Nope. You are not alone in fact my well full of sympathy for him and his cult ran out a long time ago.

1312202786457567233 2020-10-03 09:28:18 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @mcspocky I'm honestly torn. Biden is an Honorable man. A real class act. He is being respectful. The other half of me wants him to continue as usual.

1312189335546945536 2020-10-03 08:34:51 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> OK, OK, this for me,, right now this wins the internet.

1312186224623251456 2020-10-03 08:22:29 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MusicWriter561 I think Pence takes over and then speaker of the Senate on the Republican decides I believe but she is now in Quarantine now too so who knows. I do know that after pence comes Pelosi.
1312185236420096000 2020-10-03 08:18:34 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @DisavowTrump20 @joncoopertweets It's just eerie that this happen on the exact same day 4 years ago when Hillary stumbled because of Phneumonia.  Did fox news or anyone else say that the campaign should stop for 2 weeks while she recuperates? Nope. But they are saying it now. Damn hypocrites.
1312182914461827073 2020-10-03 08:09:20 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @TG22110 @DesignationSix "No one is buying I'm sick so lets go to plan B". "Get to the choppa"  Well he probably is sick but he created these doubts with all of his lying and head games.

1312178144648994816 2020-10-03 07:50:23 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @thereidout @MichaelSteele Well without trump shouting in Bidens ear maybe Biden can. He has all ready shown what an Honorable, class act he is and the better man for the job.
1312176689821097985 2020-10-03 07:44:36 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @joshtpm @Kokomothegreat Now he knows how over 200.000 dead felt just before they died and how millions are feeling right now. Will it matter? Probably not but it does feel a bit better knowing he's feeling something.
1312174783425990657 2020-10-03 07:37:02 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @HKrassenstein That is what happens when you have so much damn class and honor. They go to the bottom of the dung heap. Showing once again who is the better man. The better Presidential candidate.

1312161963347124225 2020-10-03 06:46:05 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @DemocracyInn Put them back up. No more high road.

1312159389856325634 2020-10-03 06:35:51 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Shoq @mdjacksondallas I guess I did just like I missed this comment just now. It's the wording you have to listen too. The great acting over shadows that plus the times we are in at the moment of viewing. I hear you loud and clear though.
1312158375375892480 2020-10-03 06:31:50 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @TheDemCoalition @funder That is Mary Trumps father I believe.

1312155831232675840 2020-10-03 06:21:43 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @stephyP_90 @Kokomothegreat As Biden said "It is what it is because he is who he is".

1312154922318618624 2020-10-03 06:18:06 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @itsJeffTiedrich See I wanna like/retweet your comment but you put me in a awkward position because I can't like or retweet as that means I raise my hand which I don't.
1312154233282555906 2020-10-03 06:15:22 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Kokomothegreat Maybe someone should play her the tapes of herself saying the virus will never get here while she's waiting.
1312153293821337601 2020-10-03 06:11:38 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MSNBC Oh well then not to be morbid but Ivanka needs to fork over one of those coffins she got from China. He's a goner for sure.  And now I just damned myself to hell.
1312152550078967809 2020-10-03 06:08:41 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @politvidchannel I'm a bit busy praying for the people who lost loved ones to this virus due to blatant negligence of this man.

1312149330166337542 2020-10-03 05:55:53 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @brad_dickson Fox news. One vowel movement away from what they do to the news.

1312148117152702464 2020-10-03 05:51:04 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @brad_dickson No, nope, no way. Did they say that 4 years ago on this exact day when Hillary had Phenomena or when  trump made fun of her? Did they? No they didn't.

If something happens to trump having to go back to having a smart person back in the WH.  Just listen again knowing that.
1312129304315129857 2020-10-03 04:36:18 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Shoq @mdjacksondallas This is parody. Listen to what he says. It's not hard to distinguish. Hope Hicks and the STD snark. Having to go back to someone who is smart snark. Come on now.

1312064454318673920 2020-10-03 00:18:37 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MAWoodlandLady You are not alone. trump goes to huge lengths to hide anything medical. Now he is losing. Tapes are coming out. Taxes are out. Debate debacle...……...Now he's transparent? All of these people are all about to lose their jobs and have brazenly lied over and over .
1312063002166738944 2020-10-03 00:12:51 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @ResisterDude Yes. trump has lied about all of his health issues. He has been sneaky. Now all of a sudden he is forth right about it? This cynical thinking is caused by trump   "Once you lie everything you say is suspect" My mom.  It could be for sympathy vote, rule the headlines, etc.

That was a written speech he had to make in order to save his political ass. He went out the next day and basically walked it back as usual. Just stop deluding yourself.

1311744428382449675 2020-10-02 03:06:57 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @undead808 @johnrobertsFox “We saw no organized effort of antifa here in Los Angeles,” said Josh Rubenstein, the spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Any report of a person said to be in a gang/group/ that the police said this guy is Antifa. You can't because it doesn't exist. There is no organization. No club house. No nothing.

It's a straw man to counter the real domestic terrorists that trump loves and needs. Stop deluding yourself. Antifa is short for Anti fascist. It is a global belief. It is what 5 countries fought together and died for

It is not a group of people it is an ideology. I am Antifa. The men and women who fought against the Nazis in the WW are Antifa. So why the hell would he denounce a group that doesn't exist.

Just stop and  just stand at 30.000 ft. above it all and think. If I believe he hasn't, his own party thinks he hasn't, Fox News thinks he hasn't, The hate groups think he hasn't then he hasn't.

Don't show me a scripted, political, hostage video of him repeating the words on paper begrudgingly. No one who sees without blinders on can say he has.  He hasn't and he should say it every time.
1311709505588137984 2020-10-02 00:48:11 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MeidasTouch When is the last time you ever, ever agreed with a WS, the KKK, the proud boys or any other hate group? Well you are  because we don't think he has given a definitive, full throated, unscripted denouncement of these hate groups and neither do they. We are all saying it. Think.
1311707656759910400 2020-10-02 00:40:50 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MZHemingway @atrupar Listen Mollie. If we don't believe he hasn't definitively denounced them and the WS don't think he has denounced them and the proud boys don't think he has denounced them does it not stand to reason he has not definitively denounced them. We all agree he hasn't. Think about that.
1311705540569960449 2020-10-02 00:32:25 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> You know trump hasn't answered that question definitively because we all agree, both sides agree, he hasn't. You think about that. We don't believe he has and neither do the white supremacists and proud boys.
1311703078010200064 2020-10-02 00:22:38 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @atrupar The American people and people around the word do not believe he has denounced them full throatedly and neither do the hate groups. Think about that. We all can't be wrong in fact it is the only thing we all agree on.

How many times does he need to say it.   As many times as it takes to get the message across and not a scripted, held hostage video of him mouthing  the words.  Still today he won't do it.

He also proposes additional funding for body-worn cameras for the police.
1311442167634644992 2020-10-01 07:05:52 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MrMisterMeiste1 @Gazer878x2 @BobQuarantine @JoeBiden Mr Biden says he will not take money away from police forces. He wants to invest in community projects and social programmes to lessen the burden on the police. There have been calls to divert money from the police to spend on other services, after the death of George Floyd.
1311441735197712385 2020-10-01 07:04:09 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @MrMisterMeiste1 @Gazer878x2 @BobQuarantine @JoeBiden NO ONE WANTS TO DEFUND THE POLICE. NO ONE. They want to instead give monies to people who can go out on calls with knowledge of how to deescalate a problem and leave the cops to catch criminals. He has never said that. He never said it las night either.

Why? Because it kills mostly Black people and minority's. The added bonus is he's killing off democratic voters. So a few of his supporters die, it is what it is. Collateral damage.

1302663430625587200 2020-09-07 01:42:18 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump Maybe because we are literally drowning in trump scandals daily. Oh and then there's the fact that there is a PANDEMIC going on.

Which one he doesn't need you can give to a homeless shelter. If he should ever lose them they are cheap to replace They also have glasses cases. Bless your kind heart.

1301388821188104193 2020-09-03 13:17:28 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @davesummersong @justabutternut Illegally. There I fixed it. 17 years old is not legal age my dear. He is a god damn murderer. He was acting a big shot, looking for trouble and he found 30 years worth.
1301245084902461440 2020-09-03 03:46:18 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @OKBJGM @JesusNarrowWay Actually whore was used to mean a women who just gives sex away. A prostitute has it as a business. Fun Fact. A slut is a women who keeps an untidy house.
1301202907329695746 2020-09-03 00:58:42 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @StopTheCriminal @kbartness So just wondering if bricks of Ramen noodles would be OK to purchase?

Maybe a troll site who was debunked months ago spreading this tripe on Face book with ties to proud Boys and other WS groups.
1300865093131878400 2020-09-02 02:36:21 +0800 <CarrollynAragon> @Beverly79943415 Great question. I don't get it myself. These same people who are afraid of persons of color are the same ones who go to tanning salons, lay on beaches slathered in tanning cremes and bronzers. .Watch a room full of little kids of all colors. Not one is scared or judgemental.
