Only CA and TX are ahead of FL in numbers of Covid cases. Obviously you care very little for the health of those you represent.

Americas millionaires and billionaires increased their worth by 27% while 332,000+ died.
1343180516795834368 2020-12-27 21:02:44 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs not what you said when you signed that huge tax cut that 83% went to the 1% and Corporations.  Did those tax cuts trickle down and provide more jobs. No ‚Äútrickle down economics‚Äù was proved wrong years ago. The rich have increased their net worth by 27% during covid19.

1340849248112422912 2020-12-21 10:39:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @donwinslow @lauferlaw You are correct, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking those who don‚Äôt need it to give it to their local food bank.
1340848293803397121 2020-12-21 10:35:19 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> If you voted for Trump and you continue to give him money I hope you realize he‚Äôs just going to pay debts with it. Trump has never fulfilled his oath of office which includes protecting you. Did he protect you from the Covid virus, or our govt from Russian hacking?
1340846246278402048 2020-12-21 10:27:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mhdksafa I hope you have a good day and remind all you know to wear a mask and distance.
1340844333940035584 2020-12-21 10:19:35 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> If you get a stimulus check you don‚Äôt need how about donating the money to your local food bank !

Higgins where were you in school when you were supposed to be learning colonial American History and our Constitution. You might have liked living in Germany or Italy in the ‚Äò30‚Äôs. They were Fascist then just like you and Trump are.
1340692559375589378 2020-12-21 00:16:29 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> To all MAGA cult members: What more does Trump have to fail at for you to wake up. He failed at a federal response to Covid, failed to respond to bounties on our soldiers and now he‚Äôs failing to respond to massive Russian hacking.What does Putin have on DJT so he gives in to him?

I‚Äôm hoping they just need to have the Trumps crimes staring them in the face so even the right wing radio &amp; TV have to admit it. I‚Äôm putting a lot of faith in the SDNY.

My best friends daughter got Covid in March and died in May. If he had told the truth in January and told people to mask and distance she would be alive. 3,293 people died yesterday. The Republicans are getting rich from this.

He knew how bad it was going to be in January. If we had been wearing masks and distancing since January how many of the 311K+ might be alive?
1339991957385392128 2020-12-19 01:52:33 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @SpaciusImpetu @mitchellreports @timkaine Fred, have you seen the food lines? How about the covid19 death count.  The Republicans care only for the rich. If you don‚Äôt see that that 92% of the stock market is owned is owned by 8% of Americans or that the rich have increased have a 27% increased net worth in this bad time.

It has been sooo hurtful to our Democratic Republic. If we‚Äôre not careful we‚Äôll loose our Democracy.  It happened to Italy and Germany in the 30‚Äôs.

1339696681483460613 2020-12-18 06:19:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @StephenKing Trump and his ignorance and incompetence has killed more Americans than any president in history. Deaths and corruption are the legacy of the Trump administration.

1336470562093355008 2020-12-09 08:39:47 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Sedition - The act of inciting revolt or violence against a lawful authority with the goal of overthrowing or destroying it = 20 years in prison. Trump + Senate Republicans + MAGAs beware of the felony.
1336455883333771265 2020-12-09 07:41:27 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @BCOOL333 They will write that our Democracy dodged a bullet when Trump lost in 2020. Trumps incompetence has caused more deaths, unemployment and food insecurity than any previous president. They will site that efforts to overturn his loss was sedition and illegal.
1336428246527848454 2020-12-09 05:51:38 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Check out the definition of sedition. Trump is guilty of sedition along with all his other crimes and his total incompetence.

1336411807033020423 2020-12-09 04:46:18 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @hughhewitt Tell that to your narcissistic friend Mr. Trump. Biden will do more in his first week as President to fight Covid than Trump ever has simply by telling the truth.
1336390366044549121 2020-12-09 03:21:06 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @GaryTomson5 Good for you. Getting Shingles is a lot worse.
1336387624395808768 2020-12-09 03:10:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @TeaPainUSA @etta_dziver He‚Äôs not just a selfish asshole he‚Äôs a narcissistic psychopath.
1336386742056857600 2020-12-09 03:06:42 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> What is wrong with Mitch McConnell and the Republicans? Americans are in serious trouble, 285,000+ DEAD and he doesn‚Äôt want to help the millions that are food insecure. The only thing republicans care about is power and $.
1336385209953030146 2020-12-09 03:00:37 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @educated_educ8r I always tell people I pass hello.
1336383876852297731 2020-12-09 02:55:19 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chipfranklin We‚Äôre retired and had planned to travel. We saved and saved so we could go look at all the beautiful art and architecture around the world. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way. If the truth had been told in January and we had started wearing masks my son‚Äôs best friend might be alive.
1336347925920747525 2020-12-09 00:32:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @TheFlyAuntie Yes. They don‚Äôt get paid much. I tip at least 15% or more depending on the job they do.
1336343397104312322 2020-12-09 00:14:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ShesAWarriorGrl I say his incompetence has caused 285,000+ DEAD Americans, 50 million Americans who are food insecure (hungry) and 17 million children are food insecure. He LOST the election for good reason.
1336167634723872769 2020-12-08 12:36:03 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ShesAWarriorGrl Take 2-3 minutes telling him his legacy of 284,000+ DEAD Americans and the depression we are in because of his incompetence. Then I‚Äôll tell him he‚Äôs the one who has made us all victims.
1336166164368666624 2020-12-08 12:30:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Maddog4Biden Try making Rachel Ray‚Äôs easy fudge. Google it - it‚Äôs easy and great. You could put dried cherries in it instead of raisins.
1336163112198795264 2020-12-08 12:18:05 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JimEverage Send him to the store every time you need something. Also you could tell him to Google US Coronavirus Cases. After he sees the national numbers have him check out your state numbers. If none of that works take him to your local hospital and ask him to talk to a nurse at end shift
1336161820063784962 2020-12-08 12:12:57 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @MikeJoPro Be Best - and she wasn‚Äôt, or her Christmas tree blood bath.
1336058707222925315 2020-12-08 05:23:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @GOP Please grow some courage and return to reality. Trump has lost and his continued antics only divide us and stress our Democracy. Trumps intention is to become a dictator and must be rebuked if you care for our democracy.
1336010532340584449 2020-12-08 02:11:47 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> All Americans are living through the most tragic time in our history. Yet our executive govt does nothing still. No national program for testing, tracing and PPE. Now there is no proposed national vaccine program. All Trump cares about is himself instead of the grim times!?
1335785246181175296 2020-12-07 11:16:35 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> PLEASE WEAR A MASK! If you wear glasses just breath through your mouth and your glasses won‚Äôt fog up.
1335779801119006720 2020-12-07 10:54:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Republicans in congress: What is your problem? Are you not able to see not only the failures of Trumps administration and now the plain psychotic actions of Trump? It‚Äôs simple, you decide what‚Äôs important. Your party or YOUR COUNTRY?
1335775332473987073 2020-12-07 10:37:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> To All Trump Supporters: Why has Trump done nothing that could be considered his job since he lost the election? He has yet to show any sympathy for the families of the 282,000+ DEAD from Covid. How can you support this lying incompetent egomaniac?
1335719460116844552 2020-12-07 06:55:10 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @AmyAThatcher He‚Äôll receive the best of care because Georgetown is the best hospital in D.C. Those who are not as fortunate in the horrible Covid outbreaks in the rest of the country have Giuliani‚Äôs boss to thank for the horrible response to this pandemic.
1335684865866534913 2020-12-07 04:37:42 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @AmyAThatcher Couldn‚Äôt happen to a more deserving person.

1335611693951557632 2020-12-06 23:46:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump YOU LOST! MAN UP! You are killing us! Surely you see that your incorrect health messaging has had disastrous effects. Even stupid people wear a mask every day. Even stupid people know you lost since Biden won 306 electoral votes and over 7M more votes than you!
1335442046887354368 2020-12-06 12:32:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump LIER! THERE WAS NO FRAUD! TRUMP LOST and he‚Äôs just using his cult to grift more $ from them. He‚Äôs holding another super spreader tonight. If he cared about the American people he would at least express sadness at their loss instead making them sicker.
1335400495184306177 2020-12-06 09:47:43 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mmpadellan The only thing that Trump is interested in is the continuation of his last White House grift. Money and his ego are the only things important to him. Our Democracy and fulfilling his oath of office do not occupy space in his little mind or heart. 281,000+ citizens dead mean zero
1335377246106898436 2020-12-06 08:15:20 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump YOU were never a good president! First you pass a tax cut that gave 83% of the money to the 1% &amp; corporations. Then you lie and do NOTHING about a pandemic that has killed 281,000+ and brought us to a depression. All you care about is your ego and $. That is why you LOST!
1335372962707419137 2020-12-06 07:58:18 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @GOPLeader So does Covid. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way. Trump and Republican lies created this mess and since it affects the 90% of us regular not rich Americans they could care less. Trumps continued lies about voter fraud only prove to destroy our democracy and system of elections.
1335362384521797632 2020-12-06 07:16:16 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @56blackcat Just saying ‚Äúthank you for working‚Äù means a lot.

1335361226906488833 2020-12-06 07:11:40 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @RepsForBiden They‚Äôre doing it for the money. It‚Äôs not a good move because it will kill their legal careers.
1335316602309517314 2020-12-06 04:14:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @fras99 Absolutely! I know someone who died at 42. Hopefully people will wear their mask and distance without having to have a hole in their heart.

1335299706164023296 2020-12-06 03:07:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @B52Malmet @nurseTTG My oldest son is a Downs adult who has been quarantined in his group home since March 12th. We have driveway visits but I really miss his hugs. The only good thing is that he has developed a love for acrylic painting. At least there‚Äôs one good thing to come out of this 2 yr mess.
1335234850614358017 2020-12-05 22:49:30 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Jim_Jordan Mr. Jordan you just don‚Äôt get it, do you? Can you not imagine the reality of the average American family. How many will be evicted on 12/31? There are 280,000+ Dead.Their children are going to school at home it they have the internet and the lab tops. Are you really as dumb as DT

1335076428187099137 2020-12-05 12:19:59 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Why are you Trump voters giving your hard earned money to DJT‚Äôs ‚ÄúDefense Fund‚Äù? It does not exist. Your money is going straight into his pocket. There was no election fraud! This is Trumps last grift. If you have $‚Äôs to donate give it to your local food banks.
1335061924594282496 2020-12-05 11:22:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @missypotts1971 I‚Äôm 2 quarters and 2 dimes. I‚Äôm so glad my father did not live long enough to see this time. He was a wonderful optimistic person and he would feel so horrible for the suffering of his fellow citizens.
1335044507583328260 2020-12-05 10:13:09 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Porter_Anderson @Acosta @AC360 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump We can only hope for GA to turn completely blue. If we want to help Americans recover we must take the power away from Mitch McConnell and the rest of the rich republicans who don‚Äôt care about the 99% of us regular Americans.

1335041714822795265 2020-12-05 10:02:03 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JakeLobin Trump is a murderer.
1335040109876482049 2020-12-05 09:55:40 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump If you attend this Trump rally please consider the message you are sending to every American and the world. We missed a bullet and have managed to save our Democracy. Rewarding the lies of election fraud has and continues to damage our Democracy and history of fair elections.
1335038299820449794 2020-12-05 09:48:29 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chipfranklin I have been for months. When you lose a 42 yr old friend in May you don‚Äôt need any more holes in your heart. Refusing to wear a mask is the height of selfishness and only done by narcissistic totally self absorbed assholes.
1334993944095158273 2020-12-05 06:52:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump ONCE AGAIN the Stock market is NOT the Economy! The high stock market does not help feed the miles of people waiting in line to get free food. Since you lost the election and before, you have never expressed one degree of remorse for the 278,000+ who have died because of YOU.
1334986458118189058 2020-12-05 06:22:29 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @wackygiraffe91 @RightWingWatch This is even crazier than the rest of Trumps cult and administration. I just can‚Äôt wait until we can never hear, see or say his name again.
1334976376122773506 2020-12-05 05:42:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Nicole Williams just said imagine the time when we won‚Äôt believe we had a president like Trump. Just imagine there will come a time - - when?
1334974948666990598 2020-12-05 05:36:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chipfranklin Testing &amp; tracing, kids out of cages, unemployment extension, mortgage and rent relief, then maybe start undoing everything DJT did.
1334962379940093962 2020-12-05 04:46:48 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @PollackcpaM What is wrong with these people? Don‚Äôt they read? I would love to get on a plane and go anywhere but the guilt would kill me.
1334961499614433287 2020-12-05 04:43:18 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chipfranklin Idiot. He could even qualify for a Trump sibling.
1334923661929836544 2020-12-05 02:12:57 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @saltywidowrn I‚Äôm glad you filed charges. He might get some help from it.
1334922888168804357 2020-12-05 02:09:52 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> We have dodged a bullet and have managed to save our Democracy from dictatorial hell. Please wear a mask and distance. If you were a Trump voter please read our Constitution and understand how precious our system of government and elections is. We need all of us together now!üå§
1334715200474374144 2020-12-04 12:24:36 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> My oldest son is Downs and has been in quarantine in his group home since March 12th. We hired a local restaurant to do Thanksgiving for the 6 houses separately. We‚Äôll do the same for Christmas. They loved Thanksgiving. My son has discovered he love‚Äôs painting. One good thing.
1334714046168391685 2020-12-04 12:20:01 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Be a patriot please! Wear a mask! Please distance and PLEASE stay home for Christmas. There are ways to do it right - We‚Äôre doing ours with my son, his wife and son on the 19th. They are very careful but my daughter in law‚Äôs family is huge so we separated the 2 by a week.
1334705100921729024 2020-12-04 11:44:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> So apparently Trump plans to pardon 20 in his administration including his children. Then he plans to pardon himself. To if he was the great president all you MAGA voters think he is why would he need a pardon. No one is above the law in our Democracy!
1334702674260930560 2020-12-04 11:34:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Kathleen24_7 Think positive thoughts and dream positive dreams. Our brains have amazing healing powers.
1334698034798731266 2020-12-04 11:16:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @KazePlays_JC My son voted for the dictator twice. I‚Äôm hoping when he sees everything that will come out about Trump he will come to his senses. Also when he sees the difference an intelligent competent administration can make he‚Äôll come around.
1334593023183884288 2020-12-04 04:19:06 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Gardenmorning13 He should get credit for lying about Covid in January plus the credit for 272,000+ deaths. If we had been told to wear masks and distance in February how many lives might have been saved. My sons 42 yr old best friend and mother of twins died in May.
1334520287715528708 2020-12-03 23:30:05 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Minimuh2017 @tribelaw Practicing to pretend to be happy in this shit storm Trump created.
1334519127130726407 2020-12-03 23:25:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @BCOOL333 Yes. I‚Äôll take it as soon as I can.
1334518739711238145 2020-12-03 23:23:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @WeavyYm @CherylVogt2 @DarkPolitics25 @SpankyChunky @Ebony61633854 @murray_nyc @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump All the Trump cult that went to his super spreader rallies May have eyvoted for him but since they went unmasked to a rally must not have been too smart. Biden held rallies according to CDC guidelines so he didn‚Äôt catch Covid. Trumps ignorance and incompetence has killed 274,000+
1334352325666811905 2020-12-03 12:22:40 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> So they want to call it ‚Äúthe Trump vaccine‚Äù? They want to name the vaccine after the guy who is the most responsible for spreading it instead of naming for the scientists who developed it. This is the height of narcissistic grandiosity.

1334336547441831939 2020-12-03 11:19:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Mitch McConnell and the rest of Trumps cult have done nothing for the American people. If Georgians want Covid relief, expanded unemployment, help for small businesses please VOTE for Ossoff and Warnock!
1334325322045673472 2020-12-03 10:35:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Today 2,731 died of Covid while Trump was ranting lies about the election that he LOST by 10 million votes. We are dying because of Trumps ignorance and incompetence while he and his cult are trying to destroy our Democracy. Every Republican who supports his lies is a traitor.
1334314061098577920 2020-12-03 09:50:37 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> All of you Trump lovers, your hero is going to pardon himself and his family. He obviously knows he‚Äôs guilty.
1334311874704400385 2020-12-03 09:41:55 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @captinkirk60 So sorry she had to suffer so long. My son‚Äôs best friend, a 42 yr old mother of twins, died in May of Covid. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way.
1334279308014137347 2020-12-03 07:32:31 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @lindyli @DesignationSix Totally amazingly ignorant. It‚Äôs this kind of logic that‚Äôs gotten our pandemic death toll at 272,000+ and our free food distribution lines that go on for miles.
1334277842612400136 2020-12-03 07:26:42 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> There has ZERO proof of voter fraud. Trump and his cult need to STOP threatening violence. Trump needs to stop the LIES that are directly harming our Democracy. His incompetence has caused our nations worst health and $ problems. It‚Äôs ENOUGH!

I‚Äôm retired and because of Trumps ignorance and incompetence we can‚Äôt go anywhere on our bucket list. Trump has so far cost us 272,000+ lives and a depression. How can anyone support him?
1334241503603027969 2020-12-03 05:02:18 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump 272,000+ DEAD because of your lies! You are beyond disgusting!

1334017695889633280 2020-12-02 14:12:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You must be so proud of yourself now. Your continuing lies about Covid have now resulted in one covid death per minute. Increasing the magnitude of this pandemic is the only thing you have succeed at in 4 years. Your death toll is now at 270,642+.Murderer

1333920169652056067 2020-12-02 07:45:26 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> To all Trump supporters please realize that all the $ you give him for his ‚Äúdefense against a rigged election‚Äù goes into his pocket. Trump owes 461M+ to his creditors. He has never fought against Covid or fought for you in any way. Don‚Äôt be a sucker in Trumps last WH grift.

1333825689309622274 2020-12-02 01:30:00 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @jaketapper The impact of the Trump cult continues to be aimed at destroying our Democracy and killing our citizens.

It doesn‚Äôt make any difference because we have to stay home anyway. Hint: Never buy a home with a pipe stem driveway unless you have sons or a snow blower.

1333790008814145538 2020-12-01 23:08:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @bblock29 I agree with you. DJT is just working his last grift from the White House. He‚Äôll string his cult members along for as long as he can. Hopefully the SDNY can keep him busy enough in court that his delusional cult members finally wake up.
1333787126941380610 2020-12-01 22:56:46 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump COWARD! Then we always knew that Mr. Bone Spurs was a sniveling coward.

Trump seemed to only appoint millionaires and ass kissers who were not qualified for their positions. Trump didn‚Äôt know the smartest people. He only knew the Richest and most loyal.
1333626865215541252 2020-12-01 12:19:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump This election was legal and as far from being rigged as it could be. YOU LOST by over 10 million votes because you have been totally incompetent. Your ignorance has caused 268,000+Americans deaths and millions of unemployed. YOU LOST. 1 American dies a minute!

Our Democracy has been saved by the 80 million people who voted for Biden because you, Trump have been a massive failure. Your hand is responsible for 267,000+ American deaths.
1333538504576524290 2020-12-01 06:28:50 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ossoff I have tweeted to Georgians that if they want a sensible Covid relief plan, if they want extended unemployment, if they want budget help for their states medical facilities, if they want safe open schools then they must vote for Ossoff and Warnock. GA Dem senators can save us!
1333536933893595145 2020-12-01 06:22:35 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @timkaine Why do republicans not want to help the American people? Surely they have seen the huge lines at food banks.

You LOST because of your ignorance and incompetence. The only people who voted for you are right wing media listeners. Americans who love Democracy voted for Biden. YOU LOST!!

1331238768091787268 2020-11-24 22:10:30 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @MustweSuffer @kaitlancollins It is so difficult for me to understand why anyone would want Trump anywhere near your govt. We are in a deathly pandemic with 257,000+ DEAD and a deep depression with thousands in food lines all because we had a total lack of leadership and monumental incompetence.
1331236361383387137 2020-11-24 22:00:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @essenviews Stupid is as stupid does.
1331092739950333952 2020-11-24 12:30:14 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Grinning_Coyote @RoArquette Hopefully a competent, sensitive, intelligent government can prove to the American people and the world who the real American is.The Trump cult may finally be understood as a phenomenon that should have been viewed as the power and $ grab of a dictator + his rich friends.
1331090116106981377 2020-11-24 12:19:48 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Trump voters - Your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren will be very pleased that we finally have a government that will be addressing climate change. They know this is the biggest challenge of our national security ever.
1331080130832310273 2020-11-24 11:40:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @LucyRiseUp I would be too if she was still alive and I‚Äôm 70. Hopefully this pandemic will help legalize it everywhere. Everything hurts when you get older.
1331079452147781632 2020-11-24 11:37:26 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @tiffitoo Yes. I wonder when they stopped doing them like they did to us? Anyone know?
1331069363542237187 2020-11-24 10:57:20 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @PaigeBMacdonald Neither was Trump.

1330997240324874247 2020-11-24 06:10:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ashe2189 As much as I really hate to quote Trump - It is what it is.
1330990706769469445 2020-11-24 05:44:47 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Trump voters: Why do you want a president who lied about Covid, who did not do any Federal response to Covid. As a result of his lack of leadership and incompetence we are looking at a depression. There is no sane reason to support Trump.
1330985121567150087 2020-11-24 05:22:36 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> GEORGIANS - Do you want Covid relief? Do you want extended unemployment payments? Do you want an orderly vaccine program? PLEASE VOTE for Ossoff and Warnock! Our democracy depends on your vote.
1330982934761844737 2020-11-24 05:13:54 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realTrumpForce @whodidthis2me Absolutely not. He is trying to break democracy.

1330972453292617743 2020-11-24 04:32:15 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @9NEWSNANCY @BobbyChrystmess Your incompetent loser president has done nothing while 257,000+ Americans have died. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way! Trump lied and continues to lie while Americans die and our health systems are overwhelmed. He plays golf while citizens are waiting in long lines for food.

Obviously no one in your life has died or been sickened by Covid. It is very unfortunate that it takes illness and deaths close to you for you to act responsibly.
1330740846468231168 2020-11-23 13:11:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> I just don‚Äôt get it. Yesterday there were 1,428 Dead from Covid and over 172,000 more Covid cases and all Trump does is play golf. If he‚Äôd just concede he could play every day. He obviously doesn‚Äôt want to do the job. He also doesn‚Äôt want to stop grifting and lying.
1330738895957471233 2020-11-23 13:04:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JoeNBC I love thinking about what a looser it makes Donald.

1330721267553591296 2020-11-23 11:54:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Trumpers can‚Äôt believe he would have all those people at rallies and not win. Outside of the possibility that they might have been paid there‚Äôs always human nature. Why do so many people watch fake wrestling or stare at an accident?
1330715901725974529 2020-11-23 11:32:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @essenviews What legacy? His library should be at the sex shop next to Four Seasons Landscaping.
1330713162858049538 2020-11-23 11:21:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @5_2blue No pardon! Trump has never had to pay the consequences for his actions. NO ONE is above the law.

1330569842106257408 2020-11-23 01:52:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Republicans who have or wish to give to the Trump Defense Fund please read about where the $ actually goes first. Trump will not concede because it would end his last grift as president. It‚Äôs always about $ and ego with him. Patriotism never enters his little mind.
1330568710831149057 2020-11-23 01:47:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @BCOOL333 Hopefully the SDNY will make it happen.

1330370652864385024 2020-11-22 12:40:55 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @EarnestRedner @thomaskaine5 Read ‚ÄúRage‚Äù and you will find he knew in late January. He needed to be a leader to save lies. He refused to wear a mask because he is a narcissist. He refused to exhibit proper anti virus behavior. Now more republicans have Covid than have admitted Biden won election. Stupid!
1330365915687481348 2020-11-22 12:22:05 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> This is today‚Äôs reality. Forty % of Americans are experiencing FOOD INSECURITY. Yesterday 199,000+ new cases of Covid and 1,952 DEATHS. No new stimulus is coming because republicans only help the rich. Trump is still having is 3yr old tantrum. SDNY is waiting to indict him.
1330362592049696770 2020-11-22 12:08:53 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @EarnestRedner @thomaskaine5 You‚Äôre forgetting the biggest truth. Trump lied when he knew the truth about the severity of Covid and continues to lie. When yesterday‚Äôs G20 meeting started to talk about the pandemic and vaccine distribution Trump was at his golf course. How can a sane person support him?
1330344033701548034 2020-11-22 10:55:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @EarnestRedner @thomaskaine5 Are those 2 things worth the lives of 257,000+ Americans and a total economic collapse because of a pandemic. It didn‚Äôt have to be like this. If he had told the truth in January and followed the science people would have worn masks. My sons best friend who died might be here.
1330292318545604611 2020-11-22 07:29:39 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @EarnestRedner @thomaskaine5 Trump wishes to be a fascist dictator. He is racist, a homophobe  who can not handle criticism or censorship of his remarks. If you are a Trump supporter please tell me one thing positive he has done for the normal working American.
1330290710118080512 2020-11-22 07:23:15 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @KazePlays_JC Hopefully SDNY will prosecute him too.
1330013764566061066 2020-11-21 13:02:46 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @thomaskaine5 I worry about it a little. Hopefully they have realized by now that Trump and Rudy are just running another gritting operation.
1330012865219203072 2020-11-21 12:59:12 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @EarnestRedner @thomaskaine5 In other words ‚ÄúTrumps wet dream‚Äù.

1329813178742661122 2020-11-20 23:45:43 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @IvankaTrump Interesting that you use the word ruthless. Your father‚Äôs ruthless incompetence has now killed 253,000+ Americans with 187,000 new cases of Covid yesterday. Please convince your father to concede so our country can begin to heal. In history it is always a Dem. that repairs messes
1329810973432147975 2020-11-20 23:36:57 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @IvankaTrump Your children live in a Democracy where the vote of the people counts. Your father‚Äôs illegal attempts to be our Fascist Dictator is dangerous and his incompetence is killing more people every day. Please save your children and ours!

1329577232730353664 2020-11-20 08:08:09 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Republicans please consider calling your senators and representatives and urge them to accept the election results. If you want Covid relief, if you want an organized vaccine program we must get the Republican Party to accept the results of the election. There was no fraud.
1329574027443232768 2020-11-20 07:55:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @EthanLK2001 I‚Äôll say it again civics education that starts at grade 1 or even kindergarten. Racism is taught but the definition of Fascism and it‚Äôs differences from Democracy can also be taught.
1329506861767389184 2020-11-20 03:28:31 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump @OANN You do realize that the more you do this the more stupid you appear and are.

1329504436549455875 2020-11-20 03:18:53 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Yesterday 1,923 people died because of your lies. You don‚Äôt want to do the work that your job requires so just get out. It is obvious you and the rest of your cult do not give a damn for the American people. You are KILLING Americans!
1329458637891317760 2020-11-20 00:16:54 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @GSAEmily Look in your dictionary for the definition of Fascism. That is what you are supporting. Our beloved Democracy seems to be in your hands. Because of you the planning necessary to coordinate the vaccine roll out will be delayed and more Americans would be
1329452685641347073 2020-11-19 23:53:14 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mattgaetz I think we can depend on the SDNY to indict and convict the Trump crime family. We have waisted enough of our time and resources on the Trumps. It‚Äôs past time we concentrate on the wellness of all Americans and the wellness of our planet.
1329443404464402442 2020-11-19 23:16:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @essenviews So why do they all bow down to this fascist dictator? He has turned our country into a sick, divided economic mess. Putin couldn‚Äôt have done better himself. Biden has soundly won by more than 5 million votes. When are Republicans going to grow a spine and actually care about us.

1329286453499748355 2020-11-19 12:52:42 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> GEORGIANS please consider voting for a senator who cares about you. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff will help get you Covid relief, unemployment relief, an organized Covid vaccine roll out, help with childcare. You need senators who will fight for you, not just pad $ portfolios.

If you had told the truth in January and told citizens to wear masks how many Americans would still be alive? These deaths and our economic collapse is your legacy. Your 5 year old pouting just adds to our disgust of you!
1329276367343587330 2020-11-19 12:12:37 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @McBelleCat @MiaFarrow The republicans in congress haven‚Äôt done their job in over 4 years. They have bowed down to a Fascist leader and turned their backs on Democracy.
1329257872413364224 2020-11-19 10:59:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chipfranklin Trump is a Fascist who has his supporters spellbound by his lies. They didn‚Äôt listen when the whistleblower said he was glad about the pandemic because he wouldn‚Äôt have to shake their hands. His election loss denial is just another grift for $ and his ego.
1329214932597043202 2020-11-19 08:08:30 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @senatemajldr It is past time for you and your party to remember we are a democracy. Congratulate Pres Elect Joe Biden and VP Elect Harris. Act like you care for Americans and urge masks and distancing. Make masks a requirement.
1329202151365758978 2020-11-19 07:17:42 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @essenviews What values? Do his supporters lie incessantly, do they cheat on their taxes, do they harass women, do they support openly armed White supremacists? If they support these values they have never read our Constitution much less read any US history. Learn the definition of Democracy
1329199924081274884 2020-11-19 07:08:51 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @bridget_joy_ If Trump had told the truth in January, ordered a mask mandate and high transmission areas had locked down how many lives would have been saved? My sons best friend might still be alive. This beautiful mother of twins died in May. Her family and friends have a hole in their üíî‚Äôs.
1329088541884780551 2020-11-18 23:46:16 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Take it like a big boy. You lost! Why? 250,000 Americans have died and 33 million are unemployed! You failed on an epic level. This is a Democracy and the people have spoken. Get out!
1328931600156004354 2020-11-18 13:22:38 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Is it true that only 6% of the cares act monies have been awarded to small businesses and there is money left for them?
1328931052627382272 2020-11-18 13:20:27 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @thomaskaine5 Let the SDNY indict him . They are waiting to get him with baited breath.

1328914445419024391 2020-11-18 12:14:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @senatemajldr Why do we have a 25th Amendment when party is obviously more important to you than Democracy. Are all republicans fascist.
1328905491251159040 2020-11-18 11:38:53 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Do is all a favor and get a dictionary. Look up the words Democracy and Fascism. The U.S. is a Democracy, the people have voted and you LOST.

Elect senators who work for you in this time of crisis! Please wear a mask!
1328751245641863179 2020-11-18 01:25:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump YOU LOST! You failed to do the primary job of the president. You failed to protect the American people. Your lies did the opposite. Your hands are directly responsible for the DEATHS of 250,000+ Americans!

She would have worn a mask if Trump had told the truth. She left 10 yr old twins, a loving husband, parents and many friends. I also tell them they are selfish!

I hope you will encourage a new emphasis on Civics education beginning in primary school. So many Americans don‚Äôt seem to understand the definition of Democracy versus the definition of Fascism.
1328402046144405506 2020-11-17 02:18:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Georgians do you want Covid19 relief &amp;, do you want an organized distribution of the vaccine, do you want $15 minimum wage, wouldn‚Äôt daycare assistance help your family? Voting for 2 Democratic Senators would do this. Republicans will continue to reward the rich at your expense.

The only thing he does do is tout his own horn and grift as much $ money from the American people. All he does is promote lies which will enrich himself.

He should concede and do everything to cooperate with the Biden Admin. He has already done much to hurt our democracy. It is time to care about the American people and our Democracy.
1328202938137923584 2020-11-16 13:07:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Georgians please think about your health and your future. If you elect 2 Democratic sensors you know you will have a chance at getting Covid relief for you and your businesses, you‚Äôll have a chance at getting childcare expenses, you will get an orderly distribution of vaccines .

1328144693939597313 2020-11-16 09:15:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @DenDonally @SydneyMarie_13K I believe that the lack of Civics education is much to blame. Civics education should begin in at least the 2nd grade. 7 yr olds can understand the concepts in the Declaration of Independence and the equality of individuals.They can also grasp that they each can achieve in the US
1328137861443555329 2020-11-16 08:48:36 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Watch 60 minutes now so you can see and hear what a real president of our democracy is like. You are doing everything that Putin would like. Your administration has been a complete failure. You continue to kill over 1,000 Americans a day. You are a total looser!
1328119427242586117 2020-11-16 07:35:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @leahvallee Ketchup, store bought, is really not very good for you. Good Marinara is simple to make in 30-40 minutes. Garlic and parsley saut√©ed, add crushed San Marzano tomatoes and simmer for 15-20 minutes. At the end add oregano that you crush with your palms plus a 2 chopped anchovies.

1326682092923654150 2020-11-12 08:23:54 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Did anyone else think it was interesting that Melania was escorted today by a soldier not the Donald. I‚Äôd be willing to bet she never touches him again.
1326678704286806017 2020-11-12 08:10:26 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump watch NBC nightly news tonight and concede! WE MUST HAVE a president who WILL FIGHT FOR OUR LIVES! GO AWAY!

They also think DT‚Äôs tax cuts actually helped them, instead of 83% going to the 1% &amp; corps.
1326669152346648576 2020-11-12 07:32:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @OrlandoKB1 Rubio might actually be doing himself IN by continuing to do the orange idiots bidding.

The fact that a large portion of our population are not aware of the definitions of Democracy and Fascism is baffling. They also are not aware of the effects of Fascism. Civics education is nonexistent

How about a massive injection of educational funds toward the development of a civics program that would begin in the 2nd grade. Children will learn what Fascism is and it‚Äôs effect.

You will be remembered as a complete failure as a president. A president who failed his oath.

There are so many of them who are probably unemployed. Just stupid!
1324165981590216704 2020-11-05 09:45:46 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Today is the day that Trump said we would stop talking about Covid. Well since we added another 100,000 cases today that‚Äôs not happening. 234,000+ Deaths from a nation with 4% of the worlds population and 19% of the worlds deaths.
1324130284716085249 2020-11-05 07:23:55 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> The US education system obviously needs to concentrate more on civics. Our citizens do not understand our Constitution and are unaware of the definition of Fascism.

1323770121677119489 2020-11-04 07:32:46 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Watching PBS and Steve Scalise with Judy Woodruff interview. Do they take Republicans to a classroom to teach them all the same lies? Scalise sounds exactly like Trump, he has no problem speaking in sentences though. They know we hate Trumps voice.
1323718775615750144 2020-11-04 04:08:44 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump So you haven‚Äôt sickened and killed enough Americans yet? Tonight you‚Äôre holding your last super spreader at the White House so your buds can get sick and watch you loose. You are cementing your legacy as not only the most incompetent pres but also the deadliest !
1323703252689522693 2020-11-04 03:07:03 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @HKrassenstein @Karmasaurus Did at 6:00am this morning.

1323587508404428808 2020-11-03 19:27:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> We did at 6:00am. There was a long line when we came out of the school. It‚Äôs great to see so many people voting.
1323586875018383361 2020-11-03 19:24:36 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> We just got home from voting. Every year my husband and I get there early so we‚Äôre first. This year coming out of the school there was a very long line. That‚Äôs never happened before. It heartening to see so many people voting!
1323507037809102848 2020-11-03 14:07:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> I‚Äôve always been embarrassed by how few Americans voted. Maybe Trump has done one thing good. He has shown us all what happens when we don‚Äôt vote. Trump has failed to such a degree that more people realize how important it means to vote.
1323497426418884609 2020-11-03 13:29:10 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> I just saw another lying Trump ad that said he‚Äôs bringing jobs back. He‚Äôll be the first president in 90 years to have a lower job count than when he started. He‚Äôs also totally failed to protect our citizens. With only 4% of worlds population we have 20% of Covid DEATHS!

If you make less than $400,000 Biden will not raise your taxes. It‚Äôs time the rich paid their fair share. It‚Äôs past time we started fighting Covid

1323093174152269825 2020-11-02 10:42:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Stanford published a study yesterday that estimated Trumps rallies have given Covid to 30,000 and killed 700. He did 5 rallies today and another 5 tomorrow. If we had testing and tracing we could find out his actual damage.

In March she got a 104 temp ect. and the doctor was unable to get a Covid test. She got better then died of a stroke. That was before we knew of blood clots.

You can only get donations from people who want something from you because they are aware of your true motivations. We all know you are an unfeeling narcissist.

1320902392095932419 2020-10-27 09:37:26 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You just can‚Äôt help yourself can you? He was talking to George Lopez you idiot. Why is every word that comes out of your mouth a self serving lie?
1320864334017449988 2020-10-27 07:06:12 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump A normal thinking feeling person would not endanger the health of one American much less thousands. Trump is an evil narcissist.
1320852142052225024 2020-10-27 06:17:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Trump himself is the biggest spreader of the Covid 19 virus than anyone in the US. I fail to understand why his cult members think he gives a damn for their health,their jobs or their families. Trump only cares about his power, his ego and his $.

If there are voters who are still unsure about voting for Biden all they need do is watch Trumps 60 minutes interview and compare it to Biden‚Äôs. Trump cares only for himself.

We have had 8.64M cases so for those who survived Covid are left with serious long term heart &amp; lung problems. Then there is the unemployment that is heading to depression

You‚Äôll probably know one by January 20.

Today we broke another record for new cases at 82,600. We‚Äôre now at 225,000 DEAD. Hospitals are having to deny trauma cases. Please vote out this killer president!

1318321634990825472 2020-10-20 06:42:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @socialistsunday Webster says a socialist system is one in which there is no private property, where all production is divided among all. I believe in the US we need to seek a combination of capitalism and socialism. I believe we need medical care for all and help for the poor + education for all
1318286516288917504 2020-10-20 04:22:52 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @BobbyRROBBERTS @Scaramucci Excellent Bobby!
1318279967902486528 2020-10-20 03:56:51 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @PaulaDunnBrown1 You win. Mine are Warner and Kaine who are both decent and honest men.
1318261959624634369 2020-10-20 02:45:17 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump Pathetic is the only word to describe the leadership of the present administration.
1318260664033476613 2020-10-20 02:40:09 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @kylegriffin1 He always attacks people who have intelligence superior to his own. That‚Äôs a very large number of people and he does love belittling people. Why his cult doesn‚Äôt see through this bully is beyond me.
1318258711064969218 2020-10-20 02:32:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mama_c2 Never. I hate reality shows.  We only have them because there was a writers strike. The money producers found a cheap way to pull in more viewers. I like British mysteries that are so well written you don‚Äôt know the guilty one until the last 5 minutes.
1318235521164902400 2020-10-20 01:00:14 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You and your cult are making a mockery of our democracy. Calling Dr. Fauci a disaster will bite you in your fat ass. You were right we have turned the corner on Covid. We turned the corner passed 220,000 DEAD.
1318233290743123968 2020-10-20 00:51:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @FURiousDEFENDER Never. If you are with a partner you love sex just gets better through the years. After 60 and even after 70 it may be less often but it is definitely much better and more intense. It‚Äôs one of the great gifts of life!
1318230925742952455 2020-10-20 00:41:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @lisastark351 We‚Äôll celebrate that we‚Äôre finally going to have a decent intelligent president who can lead us out of the debacle left behind by the idiots. There is a way out of a pandemic and depression left to us by the inaction and incompetence of the republicans.
1318040553062281217 2020-10-19 12:05:30 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Patrick41213808 @Franklin_Graham Patrick, you‚Äôve been listening to our lying president again. Biden is a decent, intelligent man who is empathetic to the pain of the regular American. You can say none of these words about the narcissistic psychopath in the WH.
1318037688763752451 2020-10-19 11:54:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Retrievals1 The gold digger who slept with Trump and has very strange eyes.
1318036580335058946 2020-10-19 11:49:43 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JayTiti_ @ResistThePres @KellyO He‚Äôs such a bull shit artist. Hopefully more people see through him now or we‚Äôre in serious trouble.
1318034595833667584 2020-10-19 11:41:50 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @dbiggs0001 Mine went to BCC, Bethesda Chevy Chase probably graduating around 1936.
1318028302351802369 2020-10-19 11:16:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @dbiggs0001 I was actually born in DC at the same hospital as my mother which is now a condo. There‚Äôs some kind of message there.
1318012992903053319 2020-10-19 10:15:59 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @dbiggs0001 Doni, I turned 70 in June and I think I know less now than I did 20 years ago. Please wear a mask and distance. My son lost his 42 yr old best friend to Covid in May. She couldn‚Äôt get a test so she‚Äôs not even counted in the dead.
1318011311737999360 2020-10-19 10:09:18 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @NBCJoshua Thank you, finally someone in the news said the stock market is not the economy. I‚Äôve been tweeting that to Trump for ages. We‚Äôre retired &amp; our investments are doing well while others are in food bank lines. We‚Äôve also lost a 42 yr old friend to Covid. All so sad.
1318000098954137600 2020-10-19 09:24:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mmpadellan He‚Äôs rich isn‚Äôt he. It‚Äôs just that simple.  Trump means he pays lower taxes. Then again he‚Äôs an actor which means he can memorize lines and play a character. It doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs smart.
1317868411406422017 2020-10-19 00:41:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @StormMela @56blackcat I wonder if my best friends daughter who died of a stroke at 42 in May after being very sick(104 temp ect)in March would still be alive if Trump had told the truth in February and asked everyone to wear a mask. She could never get a Covid test in March so isn‚Äôt counted.
1317853218932740099 2020-10-18 23:41:06 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @LisaHagan7 You must correct their lies, especially about Covid and Trumps failure which has caused 220,000 deaths.
1317849515693662214 2020-10-18 23:26:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @KarenLJ71 I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I think Trumps dog whistles has just brought out the previously silent minority of racists.
1317848814548635654 2020-10-18 23:23:36 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Every Trump ad I see is jam packed full of his stock and trade. Lying to the American people is the only thing he does well. We are rounding the corner to 220,000+ Covid DEATHS because of his inaction and incompetence!
1317845648838983681 2020-10-18 23:11:01 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @LuLuRoche @DesignationSix His red tie covers his massive stomach. What he‚Äôs done has hurt the farmers with tariffs, left holes in the hearts of millions of Americans who have lost a relative or friend from his inaction and incompetence on the Covid pandemic.
1317844053455785986 2020-10-18 23:04:41 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @FURiousDEFENDER Call the police, it‚Äôs illegal. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll bother me because I‚Äôll be wearing a T shirt with a picture of my special son dancing with his life long best friend who died of Covid in May. If he had told the truth it didn‚Äôt have to be this way!
1317680885018300416 2020-10-18 12:16:18 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Why do you tell people that  Biden will get rid of the 2nd Amendment and take your guns. It‚Äôs the 2nd Amendment of our Constitution. No president can abolish a constitutional amendment. Stop lying! It just makes you look more stupid. Which of course you are!
1317676624733741062 2020-10-18 11:59:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Wisconsin had 4,172 new cases of Covid yesterday so what does our ignorant president do, he holds another super spreader there. Yes we‚Äôre turning the corner on Covid. At 219,000 DEAD we‚Äôre turning towards 220,000. If you had a brain - it didn‚Äôt have to be this way. Incompetence+
1317611531664789505 2020-10-18 07:40:43 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chipfranklin We‚Äôre going to put 1-2 masks on, plus vinyl gloves and arrive on the 3rd at 5-5:30am to our polling place to vote straight blue.
1317534487186636801 2020-10-18 02:34:35 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump If you believe anything from the mouth of Trump please seriously consider seeing a doctor. Nothing out of Trumps mouth is true. Trump is physically incapable of speaking the truth.
1317533438635802625 2020-10-18 02:30:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Yesterday over 70,451 new Covid cases and another 1,000 deaths. IT DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY! 219,000 DEAD because of your ignorance and incompetence.
1317529284072919041 2020-10-18 02:13:54 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @LeftyVegas Money, power and more money for the rich. That‚Äôs it, they could care less what happens to the regular working American.
1317492320871370754 2020-10-17 23:47:01 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You are the obnoxious ignorant incompetent narcissist who has poisoned every great institution our country has. Even though your super spreaders are packed with your soon to be sick cult members you will be soundly defeated. You will be replaced by a decent smart law abiding man
1317337231695269888 2020-10-17 13:30:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Lier lier.  One of these days you are just going to burst into flames üî•

1317312448584732674 2020-10-17 11:52:16 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Leeza1949 @PeteSouza @MSNBC Thank you so much Mr. Souza. I really needed that. My husband was lucky enough to have you take his picture with Presidents Obama and Clinton. It remains my screen saver. Hopefully your documentary will move people to elect a decent, intelligent and empathetic president!
1317161078967668737 2020-10-17 01:50:47 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realFireblazes Haven‚Äôt you noticed that the republicans have been packing the court for over 3 years now
1317158873829167104 2020-10-17 01:42:01 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @BillOReilly You are just mad because Trump was Trump. Why do you expect more of him when you know he never delivers.
1316959905639813120 2020-10-16 12:31:24 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @DCfegan @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Yes. We must rid our country of this ignorant incompetent ego maniac. With every  lie more people die. We are edging toward 218,000+ Dead!
1316957297512427521 2020-10-16 12:21:02 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @rumpfshaker @TheRickWilson @Mediaite So you‚Äôd rather listen to the orange man who is a narcissistic incompetent      Criminal!
1316954078476488705 2020-10-16 12:08:14 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Wakanda_4_Evr @lisastark351 I watched the town hall with an intelligent decent man who calmly answering questions. I‚Äôm fairly sure I watched our future president I hope. I don‚Äôt think my nerves can take another 4 years of our present buffoon.
1316926176062021632 2020-10-16 10:17:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump The house passed the Hero‚Äôs bill in May. All you and the republicans have done is nothing but pack the courts. Yesterday 59,712 new cases and 1,009 more DEATHS from Covid and you still DO NOTHING!
1316924263870377984 2020-10-16 10:09:46 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @CruzRc88 I used to get migraines. I started meditating and they went away. Nowadays it‚Äôs hard not to get a headache from just trying to stay safe.
1316838844269039616 2020-10-16 04:30:20 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump YOU are the only MONSTER!
1316795058377633792 2020-10-16 01:36:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @PeekaBLUE80 So sorry. The time as adults that we go through losing our parents is one of the most difficult times in life. The only time comparable is when you have a sick child. Praying for your Mom. Please wear a mask.
1316748008097296385 2020-10-15 22:29:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @essenviews In 19 days we are getting rid of you. You are sending our country to hell and you feel no empathy for those your ignorance has killed or their friends and family.
1316746597708050438 2020-10-15 22:23:47 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump In one term we have already lost too much. A coming depression and 217,000+ lives because of your total ignorance and incompetence.
1316744888545837056 2020-10-15 22:17:00 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Bill_Maxwell_ After all Judge Barrett said no one is above the law.
1316584097632989191 2020-10-15 11:38:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Amy Coney Barrett seems intelligent but if she is why can‚Äôt she confirm that Climate Change is real. Hopefully she is teaching her family more sustainable ways of living. If she was honorable she would depart from this farce. We need to be helping our hurting citizens.
1316582052406403074 2020-10-15 11:29:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump We are at 217,000+ DEAD and Trump is again holding another super spreader in Iowa. Those behind Trump had masks to show the TV and every other packed in Trump cult members are trying to get Covid so they can beat it like their hero. How can people be so stupid and care so little.
1316527164150382598 2020-10-15 07:51:50 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @thereidout @MSNBC @neeratanden Is this a warning to stay away from Trumps super spreaders. Yesterday there were 54,512 new cases of Covid and now we‚Äôre over 216,000+ DEAD.
1316408614307930113 2020-10-15 00:00:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @skzuelke This time has been difficult for everyone. This will be our first Thanksgiving that our adult Downs son will not be able to join us. He has been quarantined in his group home since March 12th. They have done an amazing job at keeping their homes Covid free. Happy Birthday sweetie
1316389792398168067 2020-10-14 22:45:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @cooltxchick I‚Äôm so sorry.  My best friends 42 yr old daughter died in May. There are holes in our hearts.

1316233194929299456 2020-10-14 12:23:42 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Another super spreader?! I hear you want as many people to get Covid as possible because you believe in heard immunity? I knew you were an idiot and I know how little you care for Americans but I didn‚Äôt know you want them to get sick and die. You are beneath contempt.
1316214439134322689 2020-10-14 11:09:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Another super spreader tonight?

1316208386757791744 2020-10-14 10:45:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @RcRegalstarfire Why isn‚Äôt this obvious?
1316203413928108032 2020-10-14 10:25:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @jstmeinmo Because we must if we want to save our country from this madman.
1316202858052755457 2020-10-14 10:23:09 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Does Grassley actually think Trump will read this? He must know by now that Trump doesn‚Äôt read.
1316199753592389634 2020-10-14 10:10:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @FmeonceImcomin1 @bluvelvet1122 Trumps rallies remind us old folks of someone called Mussolini.

1316184309686992896 2020-10-14 09:09:27 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @SenatorCantwell So far Amy Coney Barrett is very intelligent. That‚Äôs not the point! The point is if she really was that much of a patriot she would tell Trump she has no business In these hearings. She would tell him the next president should fill the seat.
1316181095268917248 2020-10-14 08:56:41 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @VoteMarsha Perhaps Marsha has been living under a rock for the last 5 years.

1316113722088337408 2020-10-14 04:28:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mazakgurugmail4 My best friend of 50+ yrs lost her 42 yr old daughter to Covid in May. Her daughter was my special sons best friend. She got sick in March with a 104 temp ect. She thought she was better then died in her sleep of a stroke. Trump knew it was airborne on January 28
1316071409521766401 2020-10-14 01:40:50 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Ted Cruz loves to hear himself talk. He is so full of total bull crap!ü§Æ
1316017341637877760 2020-10-13 22:05:59 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump So you have had 4 years to come up with a health care plan still no plan. It must be lurking in the same dark space that the plan for fighting Covid lives. One statistic has us with over 220,000+ covid19 DEATHS. So many Americans with holes in their hearts! It didn‚Äôt have to be !
1315868668954316800 2020-10-13 12:15:12 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @jaywhyelle Tweeting truth. Bring forth to the attention of those who are apparently unaware what is truly happening in our country. Judge Barrett had all her children there except her Downs child. Why? My Downs son would gladly set there for me. Wear your mask and keep your distance.
1315860078315139072 2020-10-13 11:41:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JackPosobiec @albosarge It never occurs to him that what he‚Äôs doing in his super spreaders is making more Americans sick. He could care less if you get sick or die. He only cares for himself and his $.
1315854102656626689 2020-10-13 11:17:20 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @MarkRuffalo I wonder if a man was told what he could or couldn‚Äôt do with his own body how would he respond? Whether you agree or not about abortion, no government has a right to tell you what you can do with your own body.
1315852618045042688 2020-10-13 11:11:26 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JRubinBlogger He‚Äôs up to be the number one super spreader in the US.

1315846989175820295 2020-10-13 10:49:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump So how many people will get sick from your super spreader today? You are a horrible example of intelligent public health. We are all aware how little you care for American citizens. You will know what we think of you on November 4th. Get ready to be indicted!
1315845279120326657 2020-10-13 10:42:16 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump 215,000+ DEAD because you lied and did nothing! All you had to do was tell the truth that you knew on January 28th that Covid was airborne and bad. If we were told to wear a mask how many might still be alive? You are a complete FAILURE of a human being!

1315779933202001925 2020-10-13 06:22:36 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @AngelaBelcamino If you‚Äôre worried about your mail in ballot just wear your mask or 2 plus vinyl gloves and get to your polling place before it opens. After you vote you can go home and take a nap. Let‚Äôs get this crazy man out of the WH and into an orange jumpsuit.
1315772590837977091 2020-10-13 05:53:26 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump So you know you‚Äôre losing so you take your Petri dish on the road to make more people sick. You get your ego stroked by threatening people with sickness and death. All you had to do was be truthful with us, tell us to wear masks and distance after you knew the truth in February!
1315728825486057472 2020-10-13 02:59:31 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump 44,333+ new cases of Covid yesterday. Still no plan to fight it. How many millions are still furloughed or unemployed and how many small businesses have been lost? When will you understand that the Stock Market is not the economy?
1315619325789835264 2020-10-12 19:44:24 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @LindseyGrahamSC You want us to give you money after what you told black voters. Black voters can be anything they want just as long as they are conservative. Yes master I‚Äôll say what ever you want. You are such a disappointment to the memory of the honorable John McCain. #
1315610658579283968 2020-10-12 19:09:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Even before Covid you spent money like drunken sailors. You gave 83% of the tax cut to the millionaires and corporations. The Democrats always have to come in and rescue the economy. Now we have to rescue the people before we fix the economy.
1315484953048739840 2020-10-12 10:50:27 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump What reality are you living in? Not the same reality as the rest of the US. Yesterday there were 51,094+ new Covid cases and now 215,000+ deaths. You will lose because you have failed in every spectacular way. Millions of Americans who knew those who died have holes in their üíî‚Äôs
1315479318664040449 2020-10-12 10:28:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> The lies being spread about Kamala Harris are throughly disgusting. We have a president who bragged about grabbing women‚Äôs private parts. He has corrupted everything in our government. It will take years to undo all his damage. Please vote this horrible businessman out of office!

1315456413574008832 2020-10-12 08:57:03 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @thefalconette Yes you are right. We see one of our sons and his family. We have driveway visits with our special son who has been quarantined in his group home since March 12th. We have deck visits with our best friends who lost their 42 yr old daughter to Covid. We have a hole in our hearts.

1315442593455640578 2020-10-12 08:02:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump All you know how to do is lie. You stole Fauci‚Äôs words out of context. You have never had a plan to defeat Covid. My son‚Äôs best friend died at 42 in May. You could have told us to wear a mask when you knew it was airborne on January 28th. Now 214,000+ are DEAD. Still no plan.

1315011081295851520 2020-10-11 03:27:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs obvious to EVERYONE now that you only stand for Donald Trump. It‚Äôs also obvious that you have lost what little mind you have left if you think anyone is going to believe that crap. You are scared to debate Biden again aren‚Äôt you.
1314933482276237312 2020-10-10 22:19:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Wolfrum Who cares

1314707544900800523 2020-10-10 07:21:19 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JohnathonWillow @KamalaHarris John, you are apparently unaware that 83% of that tax cut $ went to the top 1% of Americans and corporations. Millionaires and corporations had made out like bandits during Covid. By Election Day 20% of Americans will have run out of money. That means starving children + adults.
1314705325027741697 2020-10-10 07:12:30 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @the_resistor @realDonaldTrump Excellent! Only the best fly for the biggest piece of crap in our country.
1314677731481849857 2020-10-10 05:22:51 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ChangeAbout1 @MSNBC @NBCNews Really! That‚Äôs very disappointing. It‚Äôs becoming harder every day to be optimistic about the character of the American citizen.
1314674618779742208 2020-10-10 05:10:29 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> üåä If you possibly can put on a mask or 2, vinyl gloves and go to the polls in person on November 3rd. Get there early but go prepared to wait. This chaos must end and we must have a plan to stop the Trump covid19 march to more deaths.
1314593491897454592 2020-10-09 23:48:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Yesterday 56,137 new cases of Covid 19 were diagnosed. Why? You lied to the American people and did nothing. You knew on January 28th that it was airborne and very bad. How many lives would have been saved if you told everyone to wear a mask. Today 213,000+ Americans are DEAD!
1314409557377024001 2020-10-09 11:37:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump yesterday Michigan had 1,230 new Covid cases while Wisconsin had 2,490. Obviously Gov. Witmer is doing a much better job than Gov Evers, the Republican gov. of Wisconsin . You need to check your figures.
1314390417622827009 2020-10-09 10:21:10 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You wish! You can‚Äôt help yourself from from lying every time you open your mouth.  It has been our unfortunate problem to have the most ignorant and incompetent president in our history at a time when we needed at least a president who would listen to experts.
1314388195363127297 2020-10-09 10:12:20 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You can‚Äôt keep your own White House healthy and you have proven that you could care less about the health of the American people. You proved in your last debate that you cannot condemn white supremacy. You egged these terrorists on. We‚Äôve got your number and you‚Äôre going down.
1314380423976357894 2020-10-09 09:41:27 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Roshan_Rinaldi Perhaps he‚Äôs just as sick as the rest of the Covid White House.

1314365710240493568 2020-10-09 08:42:59 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @DocAtCDI My mouth engages before my brain. You all are right about age. At 70 I just don‚Äôt care. If I say something wrong I say I‚Äôm sorry and if that‚Äôs not enough to hell with you.
1314363796060856326 2020-10-09 08:35:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @marcorubio No she did not say that. Harris said that Trump and his whole incompetent administration was at fault. Get your facts right or you are just another lying Republican.
1314359826537881601 2020-10-09 08:19:36 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chipfranklin November 3rd is my husband‚Äôs 68th birthday. That election result would be his best present ever!
1314206719862472706 2020-10-08 22:11:13 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @silascap @realDonaldTrump Silas you are terribly misinformed. Trump is a fascist dictator. That is why he has never confronted Putin over the bounties to kill American soldiers. If Trump continues this will be the last election. Biden is for your success and the success of every American.
1313978992563834880 2020-10-08 07:06:19 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump If Covid was a message from God it should have told you that ignorance and inability to follow CDC guidelines always gets you what you deserve.

1313683059351449600 2020-10-07 11:30:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @TheRickWilson After all Trump has the erroneous view that the stock market is the economy.He never considers the 30+ million unemployed ,or the 30-40 million that are facing eviction, the exploding number of families facing hunger or mortgage forclosures. #Nothing gets his attention but his $
1313680407167107072 2020-10-07 11:19:50 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump We expected this from Roid rage baby.

1313659600856592384 2020-10-07 09:57:10 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Had a few behavior altering drugs lately? Covid plus these drugs are putting Americans in serious danger!

1313657115052068864 2020-10-07 09:47:17 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump So because of your steroid rage you‚Äôve decided to hell with the American people.30-40 million people are at danger of being evicted. Hunger in the US is about to explode.A 2nd wave of Covid is here. 211,500+ are DEAD and your WH is a Covid hot spot! Incompetence!
1313595224783040514 2020-10-07 05:41:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump All you do is lie. The only thing you do that is worse is totally disregard the lives of other people. You are the head super spreader who couldn‚Äôt give a damn how many Americans die.
1313577758354702337 2020-10-07 04:31:57 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @sutty59 So sorry that you lost your love. My best friends healthy 42yr old daughter got it in march, 104 temp ect. She couldn‚Äôt get a Covid test. She died in May of a stroke. She had 10 yr old twins. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way. It amazes me how blind he and his cult are! Scary! VOTE!
1313575019851677701 2020-10-07 04:21:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs just the beginning of Trumps criminal proclivity. I so look forward to seeing him and his family being forced to take responsibility for their crimes.

1313544720774238209 2020-10-07 02:20:40 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews You must be jealous because Biden made sense without making fun of anyone else. They have given you the same opportunity if you think you can handle it. Biden didn‚Äôt lie. You can‚Äôt go 2 minutes without lying.
1313526644485824512 2020-10-07 01:08:50 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @AMorrell14 @Me4Mine1 @RonLinkins @Swisher3333 @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs not true. Does every Republican lie about everything? Is every Republican a Climate Change denier? Does every Republican refuse to wear a mask.
1313306172745809920 2020-10-06 10:32:46 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> They closed the Senate for 2 weeks because it wasn‚Äôt safe. Amy Coney Barrett might be a fine legal mind but I wonder what kind a person she is if goes forward with this nomination when she was put there in a super spreader event.

1313255933842202629 2020-10-06 07:13:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You just can‚Äôt help yourself can you? You get back to the WH and the first thing you do is take off your mask. You are not nor have you ever been a good example to the public. You learned nothing about Covid.
1313242719247101960 2020-10-06 06:20:37 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Trump feels like he‚Äôs 20 years younger because he‚Äôs taking steroids. It‚Äôs that simple. He is as usual full of it.
1313234240742526981 2020-10-06 05:46:56 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You lie every f__king day? The 2nd amendment is going no where. Hopefully the rich and the Fortune 500 corporations who paid no taxes last year will finally have to pay their fair share.
1313230445639856132 2020-10-06 05:31:51 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump The Stock Market IS NOT THE ECONOMY! What does it take for your little mind to understand this? Look at how many people are unemployed or laid off. Look at the families and friends of the 210,000+ who have died. Your reality is not the reality of 95+% of the American people.
1313201895624843269 2020-10-06 03:38:24 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump My best friends daughter died of Covid. She first got it in March and couldn‚Äôt even get a Covid test with a 104 temp plus all the other symptoms. She died of a stroke in May. I just hope that you‚Äôll live until November 4th so you know what we really think of you.

1312231700672516097 2020-10-03 11:23:12 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @56blackcat Ann, I envy your being in Europe. They seem to be handling Covid so much smarter. I was supposed to turn 70 in Cologne, Germany in June. We built a huge garden instead. We do miss traveling especially since we live to close to Washington DC.
1312230058925449216 2020-10-03 11:16:40 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Wakanda_4_Evr @mmpadellan @BlueDee6 I‚Äôm a vet too. I also am way to stressed and it seems to get worse every day. I can‚Äôt wait for the election to be over in favor of intelligence and sanity. I have a Downs son who has been quarantined in his group home since 3/12/20. We do driveway visits but I miss his hugs.
1312228338866552835 2020-10-03 11:09:50 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @BlueDee6 Not sure ? It‚Äôs happened to me so I just laid off Trump a little.

1312129067446018048 2020-10-03 04:35:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @brad_dickson Why? Biden is smart and followed the CDC protocols. Why should he pay the price because Trump is too narcissistic to believe the scientists.
1312063621543923715 2020-10-03 00:15:18 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @greenfield64 Trump‚Äôs infection with Covid was more a question of when rather than if. He thinks wearing a mask is weak rather than smart. Biden listens and learns from experts rather than erroneously thinking he knows everything about every topic. Perhaps now Trump might reconsider rallies.
1312059609125982208 2020-10-02 23:59:22 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @DeAnna4Congress Democrats listen to Dr Fauci and wear masks plus social distancing.
1312027280449957890 2020-10-02 21:50:54 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @maggieNYT That‚Äôs what happens when you don‚Äôt wear a mask and don‚Äôt distance because you believe Trumps turning the corner bull crap.
1311995448954097665 2020-10-02 19:44:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> I guess Covid 19 isn‚Äôt turning a corner. I wonder if we can get a stimulus package now especially since there were tens of thousands of newly laid off people as of yesterday.
1311980792990576640 2020-10-02 18:46:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Perhaps you might wear a mask now and stop making fun of those who do wear masks.

She was a healthy 42 with twins, husband,loving parents and many many friends. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way because he knew it was airborne and bad on January 28th. There could have been a Federal testing program!
1311854887366520834 2020-10-02 10:25:52 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @DC_Draino @Ilhan That‚Äôs why the white people elected her with a 78% lead.
1311853064165486592 2020-10-02 10:18:38 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> Trumps WH admin gets tested and traced but Hope Hicks still gets Covid. Anyone who thinks Trump will self quarantine and not go do super spreaders in Wisconsin is kidding themselves.  He cares nothing for anyone but himself. WEAR A MASK and distance!
1311830778150518784 2020-10-02 08:50:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @chucklindell Normal Republican voter suppression!
1311829498543906818 2020-10-02 08:44:59 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @StephenKing Hopefully Texan‚Äôs will get together and carpool to drop boxes!
1311828419882123265 2020-10-02 08:40:42 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JoeBiden We‚Äôre retired and paid over $5,000.
1311828173831757824 2020-10-02 08:39:43 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @NativeToPangaea @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump Who‚Äôs god? No benevolent God I‚Äôve ever heard of.
1311823342509457408 2020-10-02 08:20:32 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ZaidJilani @jaketapper Dogs have masters/owners/parents.  Cats have staff. Trump couldn‚Äôt be bothered to parent his own children and can‚Äôt even do his own hair. He has no empathy for people how could he possibly care for a dog ?
1311809781418668038 2020-10-02 07:26:38 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump  *Everything you said in your Minnesota super spreader rally was a lie. You obviously do not care about these people since you are willing to expose them to Covid where cases are running very high. You care about your power and your $ only.
1311773650404675586 2020-10-02 05:03:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Bornabrit1 @DesignationSix Still there is no Federal testing and tracing program.
1311773233746673667 2020-10-02 05:01:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> I just spoke to my best friend who lost her daughter to Covid in May. She said they were exhausted after the debate just like anyone would be after watching a 3 year old at play.
1311726680239677440 2020-10-02 01:56:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @gruzgliny @VoteBluePA @JoeBiden Other than closing the border to China even though 40,000 still got in, what exactly has Trump done to fight Covid? Nothing! No Federal testing and tracing program! If Trump had told everyone to wear a mask after he knew on January 28th that it was airborne and bad. Results -200K
1311714349136965637 2020-10-02 01:07:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @thebr0keb0i I agree. My husband hates that I have my headphones on every day to listen to Andrea Mitchell and Nicole Wallace. Covid has killed my best friends 42 yr old daughter. She was the best friend of my Downs son who has been quarantined since March 12th. No Sam hugs since March 12th.
1311707536907735041 2020-10-02 00:40:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> It‚Äôs official, the president, our president Trump is the single highest source of Covid misinformation in the country. Please wear your mask and gloves to go VOTE in person so we can rid ourselves of this incompetent boob.
1311702848984543233 2020-10-02 00:21:44 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @MichaelSteele You were exactly correct in your recent comments on Andrea Mitchell. We‚Äôre tired of the lies, the mealy mouth explanations, the excuses and the blaming. Everyone please vote out this criminal president.
1311504445382033408 2020-10-01 11:13:21 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump We all watched a narcissistic sociopath loose what little sanity he has left.
1311494093147705349 2020-10-01 10:32:12 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @jmeacham Truly frightening!
1311481253682647040 2020-10-01 09:41:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JoeBiden Is there any reason why we can‚Äôt compare Trump directly to Adolf Hitler now? I‚Äôve never been this afraid before even during the Cuban missile crisis or 9/11. We will not survive another 4 years with this very sick narcissistic sociopath in the White House!
1311465791741718528 2020-10-01 08:39:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump After last night you would know about embarrassing behavior.
1311425206284623873 2020-10-01 05:58:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Ratings? Really, ratings are what‚Äôs important to you? Yesterday 43,470 new cases of Covid were diagnosed and ratings are important to you. It‚Äôs your ignorance and incompetence on display every day. You take pride in your super spreaders. You take pride in making Americans sick?!
1311406079381852163 2020-10-01 04:42:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Congratulations, because of your incompetence the US is first on this world with 21% of the Covid cases and first in the world with 20% of all the DEATHS!
1311315509112115201 2020-09-30 22:42:35 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden  VP Biden was right you have done nothing to fight Covid. So you closed the border. Many still got in to spread the virus. Then when you knew on January 28th that Covid was airborne and would be bad why didn‚Äôt you tell us to wear a mask in February?
1311314060550582273 2020-09-30 22:36:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Again you lie!
1311309831651893248 2020-09-30 22:20:01 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You are urging supporters to go to the polls to watch. This amounts to voter intimidation which is illegal. You are obviously not a law and order proponent since you encourage breaking the law in others and you yourself so often break the law.
1311159499655385090 2020-09-30 12:22:39 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JoeBiden YOU obviously won. Next debate please ask Trump why he did not tell people to wear masks when he knew on January 28th that Covid was airborne and would be very bad. How many would have been saved if he had told the truth?
1311143500071735296 2020-09-30 11:19:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @AliVelshi Trump actually said ‚ÄúProud Boys stand down but stand by‚Äù. That‚Äôs a dog whistle to white supremacists. Disgusting display of ignorance and unpatriotic behavior.
1311056672480165889 2020-09-30 05:34:03 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Wow! I thought you were a law and order guy?! Voter intimidation is against the law! Once again you prove your ignorance.
1310978908397998080 2020-09-30 00:25:03 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @JoeBiden Please stress to the American public that the stock market is NOT the economy. Trump erroneously thinks that a good stock market means we have a good economy. The Dow is doing well but the lines at the food banks have never been longer.
1310967343628062722 2020-09-29 23:39:05 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @DrBiden Can‚Äôt wait to vote for Joe and end this nightmare.
1310938373616480292 2020-09-29 21:43:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @joanwilsonorg So sorry. I‚Äôve found that the times when our parents die is the most difficult to get through.The only thing worse is a sick child. Although in this time of the pandemic everything is more difficult. No hugs from my 43 yr Downs son quarantined in his group home since March 12th.
1310809507812052993 2020-09-29 13:11:54 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You are going down!  You deserve every indictment that is coming your way!
1310795220578185217 2020-09-29 12:15:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @thomaskaine5 Voting in person with mask and gloves when I arrive at the polls at 5:30am.
1310737100229062656 2020-09-29 08:24:11 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @SenateDems My best friends healthy 42 yr old daughter died of Covid May 5th. She was one of my Downs son‚Äôs best friends. If Trump had told the truth when he learned on January 28 that it was airborne &amp; bad. If we were wearing masks in February she might still be alive.
1310719427944611840 2020-09-29 07:13:58 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @SenSchumer  Please encourage your colleagues to meet with Judge Barrett. Perhaps it might take longer and who knows she might better understand your views and what‚Äôs at stake.
1310718533999960065 2020-09-29 07:10:25 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @SenateDems Please meet with Judge Barrett. The more you meet with her the longer it will take and just maybe she might understand your point of view.
1310435939345461248 2020-09-28 12:27:29 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump You are one scared idiot!
1310434827695542278 2020-09-28 12:23:04 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Prove the New York Times was fake ! Release ALL your taxes!
1310264257943146499 2020-09-28 01:05:17 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs you who needs the psychological evaluation which we all know you‚Äôll fail as you have failed the American people.
1310048550332620802 2020-09-27 10:48:08 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @donwinslow 207,000+ are dead because of Trumps ignorance and incompetence. If you vote 3rd Party you might as well vote for the incompetent murderer.
1310044519912660994 2020-09-27 10:32:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ericswalwell @SenateGOP @harrisonjaime @DrAlGrossAK @DougJonesHQ @GovernorBullock @GreenfieldIowa You are disgusting!
1310034772979257345 2020-09-27 09:53:23 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @86spin @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump 86 you are seriously uninformed. Trump knew on January 28th that Covid was airborne and going to be very bad. IfTrump had told the TRUTH and we had been told to wear masks in February how many lives would have been saved. My best friends daughter who died on May 5th might be here
1309918095318962178 2020-09-27 02:09:45 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ewarren I had thought it would be inconceivable for a US government to not care for over 95% of our citizens. It‚Äôs happening now and I think the Republicans actually only care for 1% of our citizens.The other 95% are getting ready to put on their masks and vinyl gloves and VOTE in person
1309915552610213888 2020-09-27 01:59:39 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Over 54,500+ new cases and 207,000+ DEAD yesterday. Why would we want this death and unemployment to continue. You ARE A TOTAL FAILURE!
1309911064830775298 2020-09-27 01:41:49 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mmpadellan That is my fervent wish along with getting rid of the pumpkin.
1309701490806853632 2020-09-26 11:49:03 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @LynnMerker @Redpainter1 Thank you Lynn. üòÄ
1309649349165682688 2020-09-26 08:21:51 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @DanScavino @realDonaldTrump Another super spreader on the way. Virginia already has enough Covid deaths. I fail to understand why any American thinks you give a damn about them. You obviously don‚Äôt give a damn about anyone but yourself.
1309648185317634048 2020-09-26 08:17:14 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Five weeks before the election you‚Äôre trying to buy the poor and minority vote with this so-called ‚ÄúPlatinum Plan‚Äù. You are more than evil and psychotic.
1309646081618259975 2020-09-26 08:08:52 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @mmpadellan Fascism is more than banging at the door, it‚Äôs inside the White House.
1309645478129139714 2020-09-26 08:06:28 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @ProjectLincoln Good, he is of no use to South Carolina.
1309599723255484419 2020-09-26 05:04:39 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @kylegriffin1 Simple - ignorance, indifference, incompetence, in a sociopath.
1309536672850341888 2020-09-26 00:54:07 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @wolfblitzer @washingtonpost @nytimes The headline isn‚Äôt false. I saw and heard Trump speaking the same. He‚Äôs wanting to get rid of mail in ballots while at the same time reminding Floridians to mail their ballots in. To use his favorite words - it‚Äôs the most disgraceful thing in the History of the US.
1309512857537609728 2020-09-25 23:19:29 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @realDonaldTrump Yesterday the US reached 7 million covid19 cases. The US has 4% of the worlds population yet we have 21.6% of the worlds cases and 20% of the worlds DEATHS. You still have no Federal plan. You knew on January 28th that it was airborne and would be very bad.Resign

1309304292722040835 2020-09-25 09:30:43 +0800 <LynnTimberlke> @Redpainter1 I plan to put on my mask and gloves and arrive at my polling place at 5:30am on November 3rd.
