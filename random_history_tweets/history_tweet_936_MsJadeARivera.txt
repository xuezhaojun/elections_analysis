1344056774446501895 2020-12-30 07:04:41 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I would like to say to anyone who comes for me, I’ve seen Orphan Black and I love that crazy blonde one so... 😭
1344056452495929346 2020-12-30 07:03:24 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I wish all the women who put healing in their bios and stories actually meant that shit. I also wish the women who post every week about lifting others actually did that shit.
1343797054766804993 2020-12-29 13:52:39 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Two things I’m in love with very much that I think will be the main reasons I smile for a good while. Painting again. And Minecrafting.

1343488569072091136 2020-12-28 17:26:50 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @Freyaisacat I had such a fun time ! 🥰✨🥳
1343440451551031296 2020-12-28 14:15:38 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Just watched @Freyaisacat’s stream playing #Spyro &amp; omg WHAT FUN ! y’all go give them a follow &amp; subscribe on #twitch
1343362066183237634 2020-12-28 09:04:09 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @afazchas ABSO-FUCKEN-LUTELY
1343349515600998400 2020-12-28 08:14:17 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Santa Claus waving at me from on top of a fire truck driving by outside my house when I was a child. Don’t @ me 🥺
1343348525090959361 2020-12-28 08:10:21 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> unfollow ppl you’re “iffy” about. if they wanted to they would. ppl show you exactly how they feel about you everyday with how they interact with you or don’t. stop giving energy to a one-sided friendship or relationship
1343325439696252928 2020-12-28 06:38:37 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> i love being up and doing shit in bed &amp; every time my man walks in, i pretend to instantly be asleep no matter what i’m doing.
1343325097948549122 2020-12-28 06:37:15 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @PharaohFrog OMG FINALLY DAMN JUST SAY THAT 😂😂😂😂
1343324823108378625 2020-12-28 06:36:10 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @frothedmilk RIGHT?! like if someone even compliments something i’m wearing, i tell them where i got it, or the brand or who makes it, how much it was, what size, etc. it doesn’t cost me anything to give out that info at all.
1343323824608202752 2020-12-28 06:32:12 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> it’s SO fucking easy to just tell someone if they really love something enough to ask about where the fuck you got it from. like it costs nothing to do that. so it tells me you’re just a shitty person. and i don’t need to give that any more of my energy or attention.
1343323131784605697 2020-12-28 06:29:27 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> did i unfollow a bitch bc she didn’t tell me where she got her outfit ? you bet i fucking did.
1343320679089905665 2020-12-28 06:19:42 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess I feel that. Well don’t keep those ppl too close ! that’s snake behavior no doubt about it 🧐 i think it’s so rude when ppl do that bc it’s just so obvious they’re jealous of something you have
1343124956071276546 2020-12-27 17:21:58 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess yo who tf said that ?! that’s definitely not a friend sis that’s someone who want to bring you down
1343046374108049408 2020-12-27 12:09:42 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @mimithenerd_ so i watched it once after asking ppl good anime movies to add to my watch list. i liked it but it’s been so long. so i am also interested in hearing what everyone thinks before i watch it again after so long. so glad you got to see it !! it’s a classic
1342712954538631168 2020-12-26 14:04:49 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> idk who needs to hear this but
1342677653761961986 2020-12-26 11:44:33 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> i’m still waiting on my $1,200 soooo
1342677501403869184 2020-12-26 11:43:56 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> i’m really glad my best friend doesn’t have twitter bc
1342609525170458627 2020-12-26 07:13:49 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Rihanna is my inspiration for 2021. Shes been an inspiration. But like, she’s my mood, my goals, the vibe, EVERYTHING ID LIKE TO EMULATE FOR 2021✨🙏🏽♥️🥰
1342425094665203712 2020-12-25 19:00:58 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> So like five of the gifts I was in the process of making fell apart, I’m trying to to be down on myself but... 😓😔😩
1342279202029117440 2020-12-25 09:21:14 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @salenaqureshi happy holidays beautiful ♥️
1341961498436972545 2020-12-24 12:18:48 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> So I’ve wanted to become fluent in ten languages. I’ll settle for like three in a year, but conversational level in five at least during 2021. And learn the basics for ten to get me started.
1341960692841263106 2020-12-24 12:15:36 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> “BITCH IM A MUTHA! NO DRAMA!”
1341952518293778435 2020-12-24 11:43:07 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I have 18 letters and two packages ready to go. I’m honestly so late this holiday but idc it’s the thought that counts.
1341897792319582210 2020-12-24 08:05:39 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> It is the 23rd of December, and I am halfway through my Christmas cards, have made two of the seven gifts I’m making for friends, and have bought one gift out of three I need to buy. 😭
1341876724460646404 2020-12-24 06:41:56 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> you couldn’t even find a knockoff of me that’s how fucking weird i am 😂 all my exes had to start new
1341876347971448834 2020-12-24 06:40:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> y’all get way more disrespectful during the holidays &amp; it blows my mind
1341862004777226242 2020-12-24 05:43:27 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> PSA: the attention seeking toxic ppl from high school didn’t change just bc you did. don’t make the mistake of letting yourself forget the past bc it’s been so long. don’t bother with those ppl boo. they were never for you.
1341858888623280129 2020-12-24 05:31:04 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> i hate a bitch that when you ask them where they got that piece of clothing, they say “oh i got it from amazon, i just typed in ‘this color specific item’”  thanks eliza, real great job, there’s only about a million fucking different choices, you couldn’t send a link ? 🖕🏽
1341650855607623682 2020-12-23 15:44:25 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> If I ever misgender you, please tell me. BUT STOP BEING RUDE TO PPL WHEN THEY HAVE MADE A GENUINE MISTAKE. If I don’t know your pronouns, just tell me. It’s that simple. I have never misgendered someone on purpose. Ever.
1341649896127016960 2020-12-23 15:40:36 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> It literally hurts me so much that my sisters want nothing to do with me. And this is before I cut them off bc they were enabling toxic behavior and abuse from my mom. They would never call me back or text me back, I had to beg for love, attention, and time. I’m done. 😔
1341641303860363265 2020-12-23 15:06:27 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> EVERYBODY GETTING THEIR SHIT LATE BC I’M TIREDT 😓😩
1341534972281286658 2020-12-23 08:03:56 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @Tamthehamster  https://t.co/3ziK3BT2WO
1341531755719888900 2020-12-23 07:51:09 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @Tamthehamster They do get a little cheesy at times but like, EVERY MOVIE BACK THEN WAS. The prequels were genuinely good compared to some other movies at that time tho, definitely. They deserve so much more credit.
1341356015208591361 2020-12-22 20:12:49 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @Tamthehamster same. i think it was toxic masculinity that made that statement tbh. the prequels were by george lucas. that’s his baby &amp; he did well with it. even gave mace a purple lightsaber. it deserves more credit.
1341355540073603074 2020-12-22 20:10:56 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> WINTER IS HERE ! - jon snow, game of thrones 🐺❄️
1341342861632172033 2020-12-22 19:20:33 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> this reminds me of the harry potter and the chamber of secrets game on playstation when you had to yeet the gnomes into the garden
1341341410314899457 2020-12-22 19:14:47 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> my mans never had an LAUSD coffee cake in the morning &amp; im so sad he’ll never understand that experience

1341263594365853696 2020-12-22 14:05:35 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> If Ariana is getting engaged then I am too bitch ! I’m manifesting THAT ! 💍💎😌✨🥰

1341233779206139906 2020-12-22 12:07:06 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess I’m sorry boo. Mine has been bad too lately. I think it’s Saturn &amp; Jupiter having erectile dysfunction or somethin.   I bought four micheladas tonight so I can enjoy myself and do fun stuff while drinking my favorite drink. If I could, I’d give you half 🥺🥰♥️
1341232965280538625 2020-12-22 12:03:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Yo if I ever become extremely famous, does someone want to be my personal security &amp; whenever they take photos at events you can be in them too? bc I think it’s bs when rude ass celebs push their security out the way or say “Move.”   C’mere, Jerry, let’s do silly faces first!
1341174591771783169 2020-12-22 08:11:55 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Manifesting a trip to Cali in the summer, and maybe NY. Manifesting a great summer body. Manifesting happiness. Manifesting success. Manifesting health. Manifesting a long life with my partner. Manifesting all the good things for my life. ✨🥰🙏🏽♥️
1341172365686878210 2020-12-22 08:03:04 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I will get there ! OR BETTER !
1341171789708349441 2020-12-22 08:00:47 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I think it’s bc even us straights know how problematic we are 😔 Not all of us, but yeah A LOT of straights are naturally problematic &amp; dusty.
1341170871512297484 2020-12-22 07:57:08 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> WHEW ! 😍🔥
1341170795456901125 2020-12-22 07:56:50 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I just picked up more frames ! My mom was very kind and supportive and bought me some without me knowing and I just went to go pick up the order. 🥳🥰🙏🏽
1340886782829838337 2020-12-21 13:08:16 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @salenaqureshi Omg I started watching game of thrones and then I got distracted !!! WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME TOMORROW???

1340787663968845824 2020-12-21 06:34:24 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @PharaohFrog I think commercials are weird in general. Every time I watch one it reminds me of They Live. CONSUME. CONSUME. OBEY.   I really can’t give one 100% focus without feeling like I’m being brainwashed.
1340787181481320448 2020-12-21 06:32:29 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @salenaqureshi @plantsandbooks_ YESSSSSSSSSA
1340786846499041280 2020-12-21 06:31:09 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @salenaqureshi I’m leaving my boyfriend so we can elope. Be ready outside in 5 💍
1340640871260319745 2020-12-20 20:51:06 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m not hating bc I’ve loved most of these stories, but it’d be nice to see some representation for characters who get magic powers, or dragons, or are the chosen one. 🤔
1340640154000764928 2020-12-20 20:48:15 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Does anyone else notice how it’s always a white person with blue eyes who gets the magic powers in most stories?
1340636042781732868 2020-12-20 20:31:55 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> We’re rewatching #GameOfThrones and Stannis Baratheon deserves to rot in hell. I can never watch that one scene without my hand over my mouth. 😔
1340624802936213506 2020-12-20 19:47:15 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess @aivdefant BREAKUP SONG NO CAP !
1340549046897958912 2020-12-20 14:46:13 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Season two, episode one of #TheMandalorian ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CAMEO AT THE END OF THAT ?!
1340490815811035137 2020-12-20 10:54:50 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m kind of tired of ppl being like “oh i didn’t know what it meant” when they get an offensive tattoo. nah my guy, you knew &amp; did research. you just thought no one would say anything. also saying you never learned about it in school is bs. we did learn about it.
1340365822678724610 2020-12-20 02:38:09 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Some banana flavored fucking shot that had me throwing up out the side of the car in the middle of the fucking night.

1340225543527145472 2020-12-19 17:20:44 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> also there’s ppl who didn’t grow out of gossip &amp; high school drama. i don’t talk shit i speak in facts. experiences &amp; observations is my game. then in 6 months it’s “omg so&amp;so did this...” i could have told y’all that ANYWAYS CHILE...
1340224069636157440 2020-12-19 17:14:53 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> If you were drinking café con leche at age 3 don’t worry about the vaccine 😌🇵🇷

1340084063131070471 2020-12-19 07:58:32 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I really need y’all to stop photoshopping celebrities together that aren’t together. It’s creepy and weird. Especially when they are in a relationship with someone else.
1340077751605276672 2020-12-19 07:33:28 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Y’all. As if it wasn’t enough dumb shit. My neighbors just rode by in a tram. Blasting Christmas music. No social distancing. No masks. Florida deserves to sink into the ocean. 🤦🏽‍♀️
1340075789417648128 2020-12-19 07:25:40 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @dogglikenate Same. I’ve had like nightmare after nightmare.

1339843333225664512 2020-12-18 16:01:58 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I bought a pack of cigarettes and two Jai Alais and well...   I’m having a low night but alcohol gonna have to do for now.

1339454585631600640 2020-12-17 14:17:13 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> How many times do you start to talk about something &amp; get interrupted by a man so he can tell you his story about his own experience about what you’re talking about and don’t even get to finish your original story?

1339342672683786242 2020-12-17 06:52:31 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> “They want to feed you hope, knowing they’re not going to deliver on it.” -my partner on the snakes on my life
1339147608179302401 2020-12-16 17:57:24 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @JFG_IV it lies in the photos of rihanna i’m telling u

1339146888889704448 2020-12-16 17:54:33 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> not me saving rihanna’s looks for when i get the vaccine &amp; be back out partying
1339146577580056576 2020-12-16 17:53:18 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> not me saving rihanna’s looks so i can know how to dress in 2021 when i am SUCCESSFUL
1338987875363409923 2020-12-16 07:22:41 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’ll say this right now. @iamcardib is not a fool. She is a woman who has a huge heart. Ppl may make fun of her for still supporting her mans, but I think she just forgives &amp; loves through &amp; through. Y’all need to give her more credit for her strength &amp; love.
1338960346246164482 2020-12-16 05:33:17 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m not worried about it. What’s for me is for me.
1338761987224907776 2020-12-15 16:25:05 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> IT’S NOT A SECRET IN 2020 !   i see all that shit now &amp; im glad cuz i cut those ppl RIGHT OFF
1338761788846911489 2020-12-15 16:24:18 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Lord protect this man
1338761682240335872 2020-12-15 16:23:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @riahluvs someone just hit me with an “okay ?” for like just a simple question &amp; im like THE DISRESPECT?!?!
1338706216936157184 2020-12-15 12:43:28 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I wish the women who intimidate me would put out more content. I love feeling challenged and intimidated sometimes bc it kinda motivates me when I don’t have any energy. I’m always happy to push when I see some women out there doing better than me. I’m like yo that could be me !
1338637476177596416 2020-12-15 08:10:19 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I know I’m entitled to be upset, but the way I went about communicating it wasn’t great. So after he apologized for hurting my feelings, I apologized for snapping and yelling.   Just bc I’m hurt doesn’t entitle me to act on those emotions.
1338637028758597638 2020-12-15 08:08:32 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Something I’ve learned so far about relationships from the current one I’m in. Apologize. If they made you feel hurt or disrespected, but you yelled or snapped, apologize for your bit.   My partner upset me, but I didn’t communicate effectively either. So we both apologized.
1338627938535747588 2020-12-15 07:32:25 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @ChesterRushing I’m sorry ! 😔🙏🏽
1338276857989488641 2020-12-14 08:17:21 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I took pictures of my art ! And signed and numbered and wrapped them ! 🥰 I’m going to post them on Etsy in the next 24 hours omgggggggg
1338084692608897024 2020-12-13 19:33:45 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> tbh i hadn’t started having sex till i was 20, so all these tv shows with high schoolers being played by ppl who are adults and the shows having a lot of sexual situations is kinda weird imo
1337989539546148868 2020-12-13 13:15:39 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m in this tweet and I don’t like it 😭
1337989420167868417 2020-12-13 13:15:11 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> from now on my only response to men for anything will be “did you wash you ass today? if not, don’t bother speaking.” 😭
1337989123899068416 2020-12-13 13:14:00 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @heyjaredhey was it Tiger Schulmann’s ?? 😭😭 they weren’t all that to begin with 😂
1337958652020469760 2020-12-13 11:12:55 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> big YIKES
1337958394330836993 2020-12-13 11:11:53 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> also if you’re the type of dude who only shows love to a woman when she’s single, but can’t be supportive and happy for her when she’s taken, you’re the worst type of trash dude. honest to God dogshit. i wouldn’t even step on ya. 🥱
1337958035881390083 2020-12-13 11:10:28 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> she’s not going to remember you bro. she’s not going to care bc you aren’t her type of dude. if getting a woman in bed or trying to do that is the only reason you’re supporting her then you need to re-evaluate my guy. she doesn’t care about you. 🙄
1337915264051142657 2020-12-13 08:20:30 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Ahhhh I’m so excited to make my homemade ramen tonight !! I’m finally getting some limes &amp; for the first time going to try bone broth. 😍🥰

I’ve made some friends playing, &amp; obviously some friends irl that jump on, but I feel like I’m getting closer to having a solid group. I’m gonna check that out tho bc I didn’t know they had a discord. 🥳 Also we still have to play together too !
1337667825780011010 2020-12-12 15:57:16 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @dogglikenate it really does. &amp; ppl are out here like “do u have discord ?” like i’m going to get on there &amp; let ppl know i’m female so they can be even worse to me. ugh.
1337667554500898816 2020-12-12 15:56:12 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @woahchels Starting to learn that real fast. It’s amazing how hurtful ppl can be behind a screen. Ppl out here calling ppl the r-word just for mistakes. smh

Y’all can laugh, but I’ve been big depressed for idk how long &amp; during quarantine it got worse, so I’ve really been fighting for my life at this point. Low key was a workout, &amp; I think I’m going to try &amp; learn a new one everyday or 1/week.

1336101824932220929 2020-12-08 08:14:33 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @RyanBernier10 I like this
1336087701561470977 2020-12-08 07:18:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m gonna get caught just standing in front of this stall next game I play JUST WATCH
1336059761301794817 2020-12-08 05:27:24 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Joe Biden might as well be king of the state of Georgia. He’s won that state like ten times already. Give him a crown or something. King of Georgia. SHEESH.
1335829743741100032 2020-12-07 14:13:24 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I once had a fling who did this when I mentioned how toxic a friend was being. Needless to say he was probably a psychopath.
1335749996906508294 2020-12-07 08:56:30 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> y’all. if you are not laying on your bed with the fan on to dry off you are doing it WRONG.
1335730770695118848 2020-12-07 07:40:07 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Ppl really think that everyone responds to death, loss, and grief the same. Some ppl go into shock. They can’t speak or do normal shit. Ppl saying “just call or text”, you aren’t that person. You handle things a certain way and they handle it differently. Quit being dicks.
1335729996023918595 2020-12-07 07:37:02 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @hog_mild @thatdutchperson i agree. i think it scares my partner sometimes, when i laugh about it or anything but idk how else to talk about it. the laughter takes off some of the pressure of talking about heavy stuff.
1335729616053542912 2020-12-07 07:35:31 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> i thought nobody understood this but yeah
1335714995846385666 2020-12-07 06:37:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Yo I can’t tell you how many times I went to the coliseum as a kid, should I get checked ?
1335714709555859461 2020-12-07 06:36:17 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m not going to let y’all get me down bro. I’m done. You’re blocked. That’s it. Now you know and any response from you just proves how toxic you are. I’m doing me.
1335711700318818311 2020-12-07 06:24:20 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Bro why do toxic ppl have to drag everybody into their business ? Literally not even a week after I block you both, a mutual friend has both your tags on their story ? Why can’t you just leave ppl alone bruh ? 🤡
1335424629817610241 2020-12-06 11:23:37 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> i just explained this to my partner &amp; he said “you think i have healthy squishy muscles baby?🥺” &amp; i was like yes &amp; i love it so much 🥺
1335363536315355141 2020-12-06 07:20:51 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @dogglikenate What a nasty man. Like he sounds like he has a shrimp for a penis. Shrimp dick energy.
1335161045653057540 2020-12-05 17:56:14 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> So how many ppl would watch a #vlog or #twitch account where we hear my quips about #NARUTO ? It’d be me &amp; my partner. Maybe a #podcast ?
1335127699648622592 2020-12-05 15:43:43 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m just putting this out there into the universe but   @JheneAiko in a biopic as #EarthaKitt ✨
1335110619335446528 2020-12-05 14:35:51 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> My baby &amp; I are watching #NARUTO &amp; it’s been the best thing we ever did during quarantine. I never got into it as a kid, watched a couple episodes, but didn’t catch on. So my inner weeb is so happy rn. ☺️

1333944848601255936 2020-12-02 09:23:30 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @lilbabyaim I let that go. The whole thing. Blocking is good. I just don’t see the point of keeping a connection open if you’ve swallowed your pride &amp; apologized &amp; waiting around for someone to come around. Ppl take time too, tho. You did your part.
1333937077986144262 2020-12-02 08:52:37 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> HAND SANITIZER, the best way to find out you have a cut. 😭😬

1333679360390426625 2020-12-01 15:48:32 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I listened to three albums &amp; finished the majority of the work on my art. 🥳 Just have some touch ups to do on each piece &amp; then take pics &amp; post ! Idk how much I should sell them for tho . . . 🤷🏽‍♀️

1333561978065924098 2020-12-01 08:02:06 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m thinking self care, work on my art, listen to music, &amp; get shit done. That’s what I’m gonna do for the next 6-7 hours. Mhm.
1333561760712978442 2020-12-01 08:01:14 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @salenaqureshi @MyMyAlexx This is gonna be the artist for tonight. I usually work on my art &amp; pick an artist &amp; listen to their entire discography. 🥰 Thanks for inspiring me today boo. 💗
1333528121199439872 2020-12-01 05:47:34 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Am I the only one who understood Book of Mormon was a comedy &amp; still thought it wasn’t funny and thought it was just a lot of dumb ytpipo bullshit ?
1333527388253282304 2020-12-01 05:44:39 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Doing organizing for something I’ve been working on. It feels good to take a step in the direction of your dreams. Whichever ones they are today.
1333356930996310017 2020-11-30 18:27:19 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> All I want for Christmas is FOR TRUMP TO GO TO PRISON AFTER GETTING DRAGGED OUT THE WHITE HOUSE.
1333208060953825283 2020-11-30 08:35:46 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BeCoMeCast He throws me every time. Like his acting is intoxicating. It’s not even him, the actor himself, IT WHAT HE DOES WITH THE CHARACTERS. Idk what I’m trying to even say here but like he just feels like a magical being to me.
1333207223812706306 2020-11-30 08:32:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I can’t wait &amp; hope I get to do all the things I want to do. There’s so much, but I’m trying to do it all bc that’s what I want.
1333178783520731140 2020-11-30 06:39:25 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @glossysza @pistolsnpoetry I know a woman just like this. One day she was black and italian. Now she’s “just” black.   Also, being someone who is actually mixed, this is super frustrating. I don’t even act like this, but this woman seems to be creating a stereotype of what ppl think I am or look like. 😒
1333138272478957568 2020-11-30 03:58:27 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Not me exposing my toxic &amp; abusive ex-friend on my insta story 😧
1332815927243649030 2020-11-29 06:37:34 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m really proud of myself for letting these draining ppl go without a second thought. I’m proud of myself for bringing ppl closer who have loved me well &amp; continue to do so. Especially now more than ever when I felt I hit a bunch of lows.
1332813842502520833 2020-11-29 06:29:17 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I never would have thought I’d be that much closer to a better group of ppl around me. Also that I’d be able to finally let go of ppl not worth my time or energy so easily now. I used to hold on &amp; now I’m taking care of me.
1332514014920904705 2020-11-28 10:37:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Lol why am I following you in the first place we aren’t friends, you’ve been incredibly dismissive every time I’ve spoken to you.
1332513313834618880 2020-11-28 10:35:05 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I will be getting a pug and naming it Pakkun &amp; you can’t stop me
1332509152216829954 2020-11-28 10:18:33 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @rspencergabriel This is so horrible, I’m so sorry.
1332508960629338113 2020-11-28 10:17:47 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Every time I tweet something that is about toxic ppl, you like it. Is it bc you’re in denial or you know it’s about you?
1332465339456741378 2020-11-28 07:24:27 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> The kind of blessing I want when my business goes live.
1332465180803010560 2020-11-28 07:23:49 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Being nasty or saying borderline nasty things about people is still a bad thing. People really love to act like saints out here. Avoid those types of people who claim to be 100% good. They lying about something bruh.
1331457807284137987 2020-11-25 12:40:53 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @sissyuce &amp; halfqueen are my moms &amp; they cooked me dinner virtually &amp; no one can adopt me but them   that’s my 2021 wish   bye
1331321565083029509 2020-11-25 03:39:30 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Waiting three minutes for tea to steep doesn’t seem long until you have to 💩
1331310759175925762 2020-11-25 02:56:34 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> People who hold grudges when you tell them no and when you establish boundaries. People who corner you and try to force a response out of you. All that.
1331310728888930304 2020-11-25 02:56:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I really am unfriending and unfollowing people that don’t match the energy or vibe. Like ever. It’s little by little but just people I have no business in following or supporting.
1331132337321627649 2020-11-24 15:07:35 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I did a thing ! A new thing ! Something I’ve wanted to try ! &amp; it came out SO GOOD !
1331119372736339970 2020-11-24 14:16:04 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Painting &amp; listening to music. Trying to get these ones done before Thanksgiving. 😅
1330919045038804996 2020-11-24 01:00:02 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess it’s like SO EXTRA 😂 someone give her an oscar already 😂
1330662957055873026 2020-11-23 08:02:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Please please PLEASE let go of the passive aggressive fake friends in your life. PLEASE. This has been going on since middle school. Ppl don’t change. If they were jealous then they still are now. LET THEM GO.  https://t.co/hkOhT8BbB0
1330661611401596928 2020-11-23 07:57:05 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> This is so dramatic. 😂 Like sis. A vaccine is voluntary &amp; you don’t get murdered for not getting one. You’ll probably get sick and die, but this is not it. Please delete your tiktok.
1330659146614648832 2020-11-23 07:47:17 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> You are like the worst person on the face of this earth. Undoubtedly. The fakest friend.
1330645237623033862 2020-11-23 06:52:01 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Please read.  https://t.co/NSIPijFf5f

1330637937466281985 2020-11-23 06:23:01 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> This is what we as Floridians deal with everyday. When I was on the way home yesterday, I saw a little league group at Mcdonald’s. Parents and kids, not a mask in sight.

1330635542984355841 2020-11-23 06:13:30 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @reiko_so_dizzy Thank you! I have a friend who is looking and needed more information and resources. 🥰🙏🏽
1330563033224122371 2020-11-23 01:25:22 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Me
1330483978378293250 2020-11-22 20:11:14 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I live in Florida. It’s not me. I’m not bitches.
1330483779262164992 2020-11-22 20:10:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Throw salt on me. I’ve already been salty baby.
1330483381570822144 2020-11-22 20:08:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> so the whole world is one big police state
1330483120441843716 2020-11-22 20:07:49 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> “it’s so worth it to eat with my toxic family”   My family just told me to find a new place IN A PANDEMIC DURING THE HOLIDAYS
1330482702018093056 2020-11-22 20:06:09 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess Honestly I’ve been like “ Why haven’t one we put a guillotine on the white house lawn?”
1330482268213751812 2020-11-22 20:04:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m not going to do a gofundme bc there are ppl who have worse situations &amp; I don’t want to ask for nothing when I know I can do something. I still have my health and my life and my art and my will. I’d rather earn it &amp; leave gofundme for those who can’t do anything rn.
1330481835420348418 2020-11-22 20:02:43 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Or hire me as an actor and pay me ?
1330481766314991617 2020-11-22 20:02:26 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’m being kicked out of my home. I’m starting my business and planning on using all my savings to start it so once everything is legal, can y’all either buy something or boost my art so I can find a place asap ? Plz ?
1330481240345092099 2020-11-22 20:00:21 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Yo #LosAngeles peeps ! Where can someone get free testing for #covid  in LA ?
1330480767521214465 2020-11-22 19:58:28 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @GabbaWabba11 @JoeBiden They were giving them free in a town by me where I live in FL. They should be free ! Let me see if I can find some resources in your area where you can get one free.
1330412485007056896 2020-11-22 15:27:08 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I really had so many fakes in my life man. It’s hella lonely cutting ppl off &amp; it feels wrong like maybe I’m the problem, but it helps to have friends who saw the behavior of others &amp; validate your response to it.
1330377015522971649 2020-11-22 13:06:12 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> That’s why I cut a BUNCH of ppl off.
1330376680209330181 2020-11-22 13:04:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I hate so much when ppl who gave you shit for your mental illness, have their first taste of not feeling normal or well &amp; pretend like if they can do it, everyone can.   We all have different experiences. What you can do in certain situations, I may not be able to.
1330352522553331713 2020-11-22 11:28:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> My partner &amp; I are watching Naruto the whole way through bc I never did as a kid. At this point, I realize I am most like Naruto &amp; he’s probably my favorite character to date. Rock Lee is probably second, but it’s still early.
1330315789228978177 2020-11-22 09:02:54 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @rspencergabriel I would totally do it in a heartbeat. But alas, I too, have no money for that. 😭
1330311411902394370 2020-11-22 08:45:31 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> THIS ! Also, traveling for no reason whatsoever, moving to another state, going out in public to places you shouldn’t be (clubs, restaurants) ALL WITH NO MASK IN SIGHT
1330310057263820801 2020-11-22 08:40:08 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @lizazzzl Prayers ! 🙏🏽♥️✨
1330309763750572036 2020-11-22 08:38:58 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @rspencergabriel SAMEEEEE
1329944655941799937 2020-11-21 08:28:09 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Am I going back to Walmart to buy those pants in the right size bc they make my ass look amazing? Yes. I’ve never bought a pair of pants for that reason, so I think my confidence is getting better.
1329944340089679872 2020-11-21 08:26:54 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Classic Vine will always have a place in my heart. And it’s sometimes problematic stepchild, TikTok. Who am I kidding, I love that little troublemaker genius.
1329943997020852226 2020-11-21 08:25:32 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> MISS KEISHA !!! MISS KEISHA !
1329943637782908929 2020-11-21 08:24:07 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @rspencergabriel If I told you the last time I was on a stage you’d laugh. Or cry. Either is acceptable. 😭
1329930581313019905 2020-11-21 07:32:14 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Same! But I’m available now. Since I’m currently unemployed. HIRE ME. AND HIM. HIRE ALL THE ACTORS. PLZ.
1329922110450520064 2020-11-21 06:58:34 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Your tag line should be “I like to cheat on my boyfriends, create drama, leave, then play victim, over &amp; over again.” 🥱Baby don’t you get tired of lying to yourself like that ? SHEESH
1329894504049106945 2020-11-21 05:08:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @woahchels You think I’m joking but I had just pulled it out the fridge again. 😭 I might have a problem. 😂
1329890655888437251 2020-11-21 04:53:35 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> BASICALLY 😂😍😛
1329877637829804034 2020-11-21 04:01:51 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @Iam_Keaton I’m so sorry for your friend’s loss. 😓🙏🏽♥️
1329877523774246914 2020-11-21 04:01:24 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> MOOD
1329710599228563456 2020-11-20 16:58:06 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Maybe it’s me but I wouldn’t trust anyone who lied to their partner with my skincare at all ! 🤷🏽‍♀️
1329709063773577216 2020-11-20 16:52:00 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’ve bought three jars of nacho cheese in a week &amp; I don’t know if it’s bc I’m finally feeling happy again or if I’ve just given up. 😭 But it tastes good &amp; that’s all that matters. 🥰
1329646103805964288 2020-11-20 12:41:49 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess so happy for you ! 🥰♥️😍🙏🏽
1329646011405504512 2020-11-20 12:41:27 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Watching #LatinGrammyTNT with my partner &amp; my grandparents. My grandpa keeps saying “...another Puerto Rican.” So to my partner I remark on how we’re from such a small island, “but we have ppl everywhere, like the KGB.” 😂
1329609059436294145 2020-11-20 10:14:37 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @dogglikenate Please God no. Don’t let them do this.
1329602117099810817 2020-11-20 09:47:02 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess congrats Doris !!!!! 🍾🥂🎉
1329567303663562757 2020-11-20 07:28:42 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> 😳 Not me realizing I’ve had shitty friends for most of my life. OOP
1329565701481357313 2020-11-20 07:22:20 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @RyanBernier10 Lots of coffee. Makeup. An outfit that makes me feel powerful. Good food or snacks. Listening all day to music that gets me pumped. Then after all that I fake it till I make it, but usually by then I don’t have to. ♥️
1329565246353190912 2020-11-20 07:20:31 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @lilbabyaim I’m sorry boo 🥺♥️
1329277769449168896 2020-11-19 12:18:11 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> The people who piss me off most are the people who thought they were “too cool” for drama/theatre in high school and college, but join an acting class for six weeks because they’ve “always wanted to act”. Your ass is showing, boo.

1329165628238917634 2020-11-19 04:52:35 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> These are darker, less visible, but I still like them ✨🌒  https://t.co/aBNqNw1ktU
1329142376728846336 2020-11-19 03:20:11 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I feel like everyone who had curls had tight curls and they gradually loosened out. I had looser curls when I was a child and as I matured they became tighter and kinkier. WHAT IS THAT LOL
1328913421304213505 2020-11-18 12:10:24 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @angelrivz @Rochelle_Jordan I’m so proud of you! You are making moves and I never expected any less. You are like the only person who moved to LA that I approve of. You have an Angelino spirit. ✨
1328912860718751744 2020-11-18 12:08:10 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Happy birthday to this beautiful human being ♥️✨🥰
1328912702086012930 2020-11-18 12:07:32 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @StefanieDirects I guess I should just expect every social media platform to copy each other and one day we’ll have multiple apps all capable of doing the same exact thing. 😭
1328894656923508746 2020-11-18 10:55:50 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Twitter, what did you do?
1328608540437655554 2020-11-17 15:58:55 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @ChristenP ♥️🥺
1328244757269798914 2020-11-16 15:53:22 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> You don’t know anyone’s story or how they grew up, but I know ppl who have lied about and/or hidden their heritage. I’m tired of it. Let my record stand. I never pretend to be something I’m not. Unless it’s for acting, bc that’s my profession. Even then. I’ve always been me. 🙏🏽
1328244393782996992 2020-11-16 15:51:55 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I grew up with a Filipino stepdad who is my dad for all intents and purposes. But to clarify, I have no Filipino blood. But that’s my family.
1328244141579513856 2020-11-16 15:50:55 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> That’s all I’ve ever been and that’s all I’ll ever be.
1328244062885978112 2020-11-16 15:50:36 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> It was not fun being mixed It was not fun never being accepted by any group. I was never enough ethnically for anyone. I’ve always said what I was. Every time. Ppl have guessed and asked but I’m always clear. I am Puerto Rican, Black, Native American, and Irish.
1328243525608206337 2020-11-16 15:48:28 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> It’s not your heritage and this I know bc you blast it now. Bc you’re quiet until it makes you more “exotic”. You changed your heritage or let ppl know now bc now it’s cool to be a minority or to be mixed. Y’all ain’t fooling anyone.
1328242914686889984 2020-11-16 15:46:03 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> It’s okay to make mistakes when you’re young. But we’re grown now. Let’s come correct and respect each other. I know ppl who are “woke” and older than me and still to these things for clout. Stop it. And don’t get mad when someone corrects you either.
1328242518748696576 2020-11-16 15:44:28 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> First of all my heritage is not a costume. Second it’s not Indian, it’s Native American. Thirdly, stop fetishizing ethnicities and nationalities. Or just all of those things as first bc they’re equally important.
1328242024978509824 2020-11-16 15:42:30 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I want to say this. I dressed as Pocahontas as a child. Before I learned what her story was. Being mixed and having native blood in my veins as a grown women, seeing the sexy mysterious indigenous woman trope, it boils my blood to see “sexy Indian” costumes on Halloween.
1328188708709920770 2020-11-16 12:10:39 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Yes, but also. If you push me past my limit bc you know I’m a kind person and think I won’t pull up the receipts for your behavior,  https://t.co/7jomwCOUde
1328188016129695745 2020-11-16 12:07:54 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @laurenjadepope Hi ! 🥰✨
1328187862106386432 2020-11-16 12:07:17 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @thegarygraham Michelada 🥰✨
1328187722960429056 2020-11-16 12:06:44 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @Erkmon There’s nothing wrong with that. Better to be single and happy than settle for the wrong person. That way when the right person comes, you won’t be with the wrong person and miss the partner of a lifetime. You’re a gem, treat yourself like one. ♥️✨

1327850330982322176 2020-11-15 13:46:03 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> If we aren’t married already, that’s happening, and some intimate things I shan’t speak of are happening immediately too. 😘
1327849986831347716 2020-11-15 13:44:41 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> So I have anxiety and depression, among other things, but does anyone else time themselves when they use the devil’s lettuce? I’m just curious.
1327750122709667842 2020-11-15 07:07:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> My partner is not impressed by Queen’s Gambit at all. He saw the trailer and said “Big whoop, girl knows how to play chess.” 🙄 Then looked at me and said “Look babe, they’ve made a show about you.” 😭   He gives me way more credit than I deserve. ♟
1327735443086041089 2020-11-15 06:09:32 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @BiggDaddyyDeess Well I finally watched the new Emma (2020) last night which I have been wanting to see. It was everything. 🥰 And I started watching Jane Eyre (2011). I’ve also watched Emma, the version with Gwyneth Paltrow. It’s not bad. As You Like It with Bryce Dallas Howard ! Also good! 💕😘
1327564636833583106 2020-11-14 18:50:49 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’ve come to the point when I’m watching victorian set movies and I’m on my third glass of sangria so
1327409960175677441 2020-11-14 08:36:11 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> That being said, just because I am a woman doesn’t mean I’m afraid to call out other women for their behavior. Being rude and speaking the truth are two different things. Don’t confuse them.
1327409385879056387 2020-11-14 08:33:54 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> If you have to put other women down in order to call yourself goddess, then you aren’t deserving of that title. We don’t bash other women in order to lift ourselves. You should be able to lift yourself and never mention another woman in that same breath. Unless to lift her too.
1327144784889344001 2020-11-13 15:02:28 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @lilbabyaim Me too! I’d love to be able to wear certain clothes that only tiny tiddy ppl can pull off.
1327118820935426049 2020-11-13 13:19:18 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @lilbabyaim Same. But mine would probably be a boobie lift bc I have a large chest and a tiny frame and gravity is a thing as we get older, but I probably won’t bc I’m scared 😭
1327118363445891073 2020-11-13 13:17:29 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Suicide figures are up. Could 2 followers please copy and re-post this tweet? We’re trying to demonstrate that someone is always listening.   Call 1-800-273-8255 (USA hotline)  Just two. Any two. Copy, not retweet.
1325507645390905346 2020-11-09 02:37:04 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @StefanieDirects That’s what my grandma just said too. She’s like “I wonder who the third will be.” 😔
1325500052765351937 2020-11-09 02:06:53 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> @Iam_Keaton who let you see my drafts ? 😭😂
1325498150354870280 2020-11-09 01:59:20 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> This is heartbreaking. We all knew he was working through some medical issues, but I think we all hoped he’d stay forever. Jeopardy is like our family’s thing. My grandparents &amp; I will be mourning. What a phenomenal man &amp; what a phenomenal loss. 😓💔🙏🏽 God rest his soul.  https://t.co/heYyRuxW2j
1325254744189841409 2020-11-08 09:52:07 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> This is the first time in four years I’ve sat down and listened to a presidential speech. It feels so good to have someone leading us that I trust. Thank you, God! 🙏🏽
1325252110397665285 2020-11-08 09:41:39 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Also ppl apologizing for the trauma they put you through doesn’t undo the trauma. You can forgive but you don’t owe them a friendship &amp; you aren’t a bad person for not wanting one. Don’t let ppl twist your image of yourself so they can feel better about themselves!
1325251633522102272 2020-11-08 09:39:46 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> There are people out there who are so passive aggressive it makes me choke ! Decline their friend requests, block their profile, do not respond to their messages! Trust your intuition baybee &amp; don’t give them access to you, your information, or your energy! THIS IS A PSA 🗣
1325250781948342272 2020-11-08 09:36:23 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Stop allowing people to access you!!!
1325250156317564928 2020-11-08 09:33:53 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Why would you like someone’s post after sending a friend request that they have declined. You know I don’t like you. We aren’t friends. Yet you purposely came on my page and liked a status about me having  breakdown. Now I have to change my privacy settings. 😭
1325209039165394944 2020-11-08 06:50:30 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> after having a breakdown yesterday, this is the greatest news ! this made my day 🥰😍

1322665776021676034 2020-11-01 06:24:29 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Nvm. Too late. Why is it always women who think they’re too pretty to get in trouble for wearing something offensive?   Sis, looks fade, but the two brain cells you have won’t multiply. If you had three maybe you’d put 2+2 together &amp; figure out how easy it is to NOT BE OFFENSIVE
1322664888137879554 2020-11-01 06:20:57 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Hi. If y’all could not dress as cultures or nationalities for Halloween today, that’d be great. SMH.
1322569478958362625 2020-11-01 00:01:50 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> They are congregating  on the streets here in Hillsborough County as well. I called the sheriff bc idc who you’re supporting, THIS IS OBNOXIOUS. They are creating traffic and distracting drivers. ENOUGH.

1318740019079749635 2020-10-21 10:24:56 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> This is like the only thing Mark Ruffalo has tweeted that made me cringe. I understand he (Chris Pratt) may be a good person, but I have to remain an ally for the LGBT+ community. Chris Pratt is a grown man &amp; knows what he’s doing with his life. He’s choosing to be bigoted.

I haven’t really sang much during quarantine because I usually sing when I’m happy. But that being said, I haven’t sang anything from #Wicked in so long.   I wasn’t that bad. ☺️

1306849345933844480 2020-09-18 14:55:38 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Please stop using mental illness as a trend. You don’t want this. You don’t know. I really sometimes think this is hell nd I’m paying for my sins from whatever life I had before. That’s depression for me.
1306848952457797632 2020-09-18 14:54:05 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Every day I know I’m a shell of myself and there isn’t really much I can do about it. Broke college adult with no insurance and currently no job that I can support myself with. If I didn’t live with my grandparents I’d be homeless.
1306848575108808705 2020-09-18 14:52:35 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Every day I dream of what it was like when I was happier and wasn’t this sad or down all the time. When I didn’t require insane amounts of sleep to feel normal or rested. When I ate, and had energy to go everywhere and do everything.
1306848289942368256 2020-09-18 14:51:27 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> And yet we’re all constantly told we aren’t a burden. Either stop lying to us or hold up your end of the lie. It’s not easy dealing with mental illness at all either as a person who has it or knowing someone that does. But I didn’t ask to be made this way.
1306847890938175490 2020-09-18 14:49:51 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’ve tried to keep all of my relationships making effort whenever i can but after so long of being the first to text people and them being dry in responses and letting the conversation die, yeah I just leave them alone. I know better.
1306847464792748033 2020-09-18 14:48:10 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> You all love posting about helping others with their mental illnesses, being more accepting and accommodating, about how you all think suicide isn’t the answer. But I’ll tell you right now that you’re lying. You don’t give a flying fuck about people like me.
1306846354237521920 2020-09-18 14:43:45 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I have no desire to even do the terrible vices that were once good/bad coping mechanisms. That’s where I’m at. My body/brain doesn’t even want to do the fun bad things it used to do to feel some level of happiness.
1306846003866357765 2020-09-18 14:42:22 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’ve been on a severe downward spiral since quarantine began and every day I don’t know if one day I just will give up entirely. I have no motivation to do ANYTHING. ANYTHING. It’s not the quirky depression where I drink a lot and eat hot cheetos. This is real.
1306845500788834305 2020-09-18 14:40:22 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I’ve seen ppl who I know have no business saying anything about mental illness bc literally everything out of their mouth is their idea of what having a mental illness is like &amp; it’s incorrect. This is not some trend, this is my fucking life.
1306845127193788423 2020-09-18 14:38:52 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Don’t tell me you have depression when you don’t know what it’s like to have breakdowns at 2:30am crying by yourself thinking about how easy it would be to just die &amp; the world would go on. Please don’t.

1303871626086408193 2020-09-10 09:43:15 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> I just would like to say, if I don’t like you, my man don’t like you either.   &amp; it’s not bc I asked him to.  It’s bc anybody who has ever crossed me knows that they did, &amp; he doesn’t like that shit. I am way more forgiving to ppl than my mans.   &amp; that’s on loyalty.
1303514511010394112 2020-09-09 10:04:12 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> The day we met, my now bf and I had played Skyrim together. He was excited that we had another thing in common. He showed me his house bc he had a DLC so I was like  👁👄👁 We’ve been together for over a year now 🥰✨  Skyrim brings people together. ♥️
1303508361925799936 2020-09-09 09:39:46 +0800 <MsJadeARivera> Bae &amp; I decided to do a sushi night tonight🍣 We got tako(octopus) sashimi too, which I’ve never had, but I’m terrified to try 😭 knowing me, I’ll probably like it anyway. 乾杯! Also we got some strawberry soju 🥰 since they didn’t have sake, but we’re making due just fine ☺️  https://t.co/XZs5rbDy6r
