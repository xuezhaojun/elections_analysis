You bastards have done it for the past 4 years and by committing election fraud and eliminating my voice, this government no longer has the consent of the “governed”.

1326529411320045570 2020-11-11 22:17:12 +0800 <BrianDTexan> @JudicialWatch Why would the records of what someone did as a public employee be sealed from the public?

1326522116389412869 2020-11-11 21:48:12 +0800 <BrianDTexan> @marklevinshow It would be “a shame” if Farcebooks servers were denied access to the internet for stifling free speech.

1311780149403152384 2020-10-02 05:28:53 +0800 <BrianDTexan> Should daylight saving time be made permanent? Why health experts say no  https://t.co/YZ49lvwha8  It seems to me that the power to regulate this is NOT a Constitutional power of the Federal Government and should be challenged as such once ACB is seated.  Follow the Constitution!
1309717891965620226 2020-09-26 12:54:13 +0800 <BrianDTexan> @SenatorTimScott I am very sad for Ms Taylor, but one of the problems you face with keeping certain company is that you place yourself at risk no matter how nice, kind and wonderful you are.  If you hang with people that deal drugs you might get caught in the crossfire when your man shoots cops.

1309711014355636231 2020-09-26 12:26:53 +0800 <BrianDTexan> @Benioff except.... the mask has ZERO impact.  How about they release the doctors to employ the treatments that work for their patients.  Like Hydroxychloroquine, Zpacks and Zinc... and how about if you're concerned about your health, YOU are free to wear a mask, not force other to wear 1
