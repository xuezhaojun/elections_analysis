1324123810073845763 2020-11-05 06:58:12 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @Berniewouldawon You Berners will never stop whining ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1323939390620655616 2020-11-04 18:45:22 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @Berniewouldawon Keep dreaming
1323861408988209152 2020-11-04 13:35:30 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @StreetFightr3rd @aishaismad Oh so Floridans would have elected  a self described socialist?
1323858338782740480 2020-11-04 13:23:18 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @aishaismad Oh so Bernie would have done better ? The foolishness of Bernie supporters will never cease to amaze me
1323639772640874497 2020-11-03 22:54:48 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @dhconway Thank you! I have been saying this for years that enlightenment libertarianism has merged with Christianity.
1322920053709426688 2020-11-01 23:14:54 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @HCTrudo Want to tell us who you voted for?
1322445081178263552 2020-10-31 15:47:31 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @moviesandcats What show?
1321668148580519937 2020-10-29 12:20:16 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @GingerLibSoc Well, I disagree with you that Christianity is true. In fact, Jesus never intended to start a religion called Christianity but that is for a later discussion, but hey thatâ€™s your opinion even though we disagree!
1321580279916617730 2020-10-29 06:31:07 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @magi_jay Exactly what I have been saying to all right wing nuts!
1321185673584533504 2020-10-28 04:23:05 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @ProphetWalrus The fact that people fell victim to the Messiah fallacy still stuns me today
1321144256506056705 2020-10-28 01:38:31 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @ATeetriple @sarahjeong What were you expecting her old tweets to do? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Iâ€™m genuinely surprised by how immature a lot of right wingers like you are
1320845463667363840 2020-10-27 05:51:13 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @HillaryClinton Happy Birthday!!!
1320755585822924801 2020-10-26 23:54:04 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @medwoman1 @seanhannity Exactly!!!
1320512460575617025 2020-10-26 07:47:59 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @chialphagirl Okay, now I get what you mean.
1320510488934047749 2020-10-26 07:40:09 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @chialphagirl No, I donâ€™t believe in such
1320509223185321987 2020-10-26 07:35:07 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @chialphagirl What does this tweet even mean?
1318984760530796545 2020-10-22 02:37:27 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @mmgs01 @KingBolby Again thatâ€™s your opinion in which I disagree with no institution can will never claim God.
1318984436126539779 2020-10-22 02:36:09 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @mmgs01 @KingBolby The church is the universal people of God and does not only include Roman Catholics!
1318983965211041794 2020-10-22 02:34:17 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @KingBolby @mmgs01 human understanding and we are all his creatures to God we came from and to God we shall return (based on my faith) No man nor institution can and will never claim God. I know you Catholics do that for security in your faith but thatâ€™s your opinion
1318983325776859143 2020-10-22 02:31:45 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @KingBolby @mmgs01 Yeah thatâ€™s what you will think because you are Catholic and people like you love to read history backward using your already conceived thoughts of what you have been told what the RCC is. But hey thatâ€™s your opinion. God is God and transcends
1318981355854856192 2020-10-22 02:23:55 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @KingBolby @mmgs01 Because this tweet popped up on my timeline and she made this absolute tweet that the Catholic Church is one divine institution trying to claim God or should I say put him in a box for her church
1318980371795628033 2020-10-22 02:20:00 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @KingBolby @mmgs01 Again thatâ€™s your opinion which I vehemently disagree with.
1318978362296160258 2020-10-22 02:12:01 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @mmgs01 Well there are people like me that are not Catholic and do not think of the Church as divine so just to remind you thatâ€™s your opinion.
1316428070866345984 2020-10-15 01:18:04 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @VMG1000 @BoycottUtah @Thom_Hartmann @Joyce_HansonCA Bro, thatâ€™s not an argument. You are genuinely stupid! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1316380714837909505 2020-10-14 22:09:54 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @ProphetWalrus I am with you mate
1315988494767005696 2020-10-13 20:11:21 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @motherenergy__ Nah, it also has Catholic garbage in it. You just donâ€™t wanna acknowledge it.
1313659210358497286 2020-10-07 09:55:37 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @Ezymaxy1 @cenkuygur @ryangrim As I said you are indeed a stupid person ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
1313658375834566659 2020-10-07 09:52:18 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @Ezymaxy1 @cenkuygur @ryangrim ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ you are indeed as I said a stupid person!
1313630019776917504 2020-10-07 07:59:37 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @Ezymaxy1 @cenkuygur @ryangrim This might be the most stupid tweet that Iâ€™ve ever seen from perhaps a stupid person
1313141838849736713 2020-10-05 23:39:46 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @Sharon_Kuruvila I genuinely donâ€™t understand how and why people believe in Christianity. How did that statement in your tweet make any sense?
1312471563439013889 2020-10-04 03:16:19 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @MarianneMindse1 @creature_maria Do you believe in free will or determinism
1311392138505187337 2020-10-01 03:47:04 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @raul_comm @HamillHimself You indeed are extremely stupid!
1302544173862658048 2020-09-06 17:48:25 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @DeusMiserere @RichardBSpencer This is a foolish interpretation of the Biblical passage. Do people like you behave stupid on purpose.
1302308400303353857 2020-09-06 02:11:33 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @gerhardstuebben Sorry for the assumption but I am confused why you posted that tweet as a Christian because that belief by the Sultan does not vindicate your belief of Jesus
1302307846839771136 2020-09-06 02:09:21 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @gerhardstuebben Mahdi does not mean what you think it is
1301482101733236736 2020-09-03 19:28:08 +0800 <ArmstrongEnneth> @MarvelAtBest Good luck!
