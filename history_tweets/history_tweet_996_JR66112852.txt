1341709403481923585 2020-12-23 19:37:04 +0800 <JR66112852> 🤔 I've been thinking about following Eddie Izzard's lead, and may start identifying as a man, in the New Year...  If I wear a pair of trousers &amp; a shirt, &amp; stop plucking the odd facial hair, do you think I'd pass as "he", "him", "his"?
1341706532141101061 2020-12-23 19:25:39 +0800 <JR66112852> Izzard can even start identifying as a parrot 🦜&amp; switch into "bird mode", but this cuckoo will always be a beefy bloke in💄 &amp; a 👗👠👠 to me!  Male is male! ♂️ He, His, Him!  🚹

I have the right to question this, however  - and feel the need to do so, as it was rushed out &amp; not tested long enough. My mother has had it and has been feeling unwell since.

My point is that I am particularly sensitive to suicide, so am aware that many people will be feeling suicidal due to the Lockdowns, isolation, job losses, etc. Any increase in suicide rates should be broadcast, like Covid rates are.
1340432285863190528 2020-12-20 07:02:15 +0800 <JR66112852> Having lost my beloved older brother to suicide... 😪...(years ago)...

1340371456589500418 2020-12-20 03:00:32 +0800 <JR66112852> @markfield133 It comes from being homeless, in childhood, Mark. Have never lost the value of second-hand jumble.
1340369660504666115 2020-12-20 02:53:24 +0800 <JR66112852> @YorkshireLady3 Correct! I used to have a cuff-bangle made with turquoise &amp; other semi-precious stones, using this painstaking marquetry technique. 🤗

1340365567971221504 2020-12-20 02:37:08 +0800 <JR66112852> Most of the contents of my house were sourced from charity shops, or bought second-hand. So, I was delighted to buy this latest acquisition today, from Barnardo's! 😃A semi-precious gemstone &amp; brass, handmade globe! 🔮🥰Love it!!  What do you think?...  https://t.co/zOHx6xjADW

Avocados are notoriously calorific, despite being highly nutritious (too many positives to list here), but are still a much better option than chocolate.  Avg avocado = 234 calories 100g choc= 540 calories   Worth a swap, if you like them! 😋🍐

I was about 5'6" at 14, but he was over 6' &amp; very thick-set, like a rugby player!  ...The bigger they are, the harder they fall! 😋  https://t.co/0qp1ZUoker

1338649228940292097 2020-12-15 08:57:01 +0800 <JR66112852> Fab-u-lous! Hate to brag, but reminds me of when, as a 14yr-old schoolgirl, I threw our big &amp; burly Judo Instructor, humiliating &amp; winding him in front of the class! 🤭Floored him for ALWAYS using me to demo different moves, ending in pinning me to the floor &amp; groping me!

There are some seriously unpleasant Remaniac Twits who should up-sticks &amp; jump in a dinghy (many abandoned on a Kent beach!), head for Euroland &amp; resettle there, permanently!  Sorted! 😂
1337936512659451906 2020-12-13 09:44:56 +0800 <JR66112852> @Duggery4 Good luck - and bravo for standing your ground!  David against Goliath springs to mind!  https://t.co/d7gLVwG0Lp

1337930383204245505 2020-12-13 09:20:35 +0800 <JR66112852> @eantonon Thank you for your kind words - the camera on my tablet is playing up &amp; bleaching the colour tones.  Another Twit, with a cruel heart, scored it a 2! 😅

1337883704207806470 2020-12-13 06:15:06 +0800 <JR66112852> @CoralieAnn Thanks, dear Coralie! So much went wrong today that I seriously thought someone had put a curse on me! One upset after another! Tried to be cheerful &amp; post a few photos, but my tablet's camera takes bleached-out pics &amp; an unkind Twit scored my dinner a 2! 😣
1337877308422696961 2020-12-13 05:49:41 +0800 <JR66112852> @mikeyonman I take it that you inherited these charming little treasures from your parents, as they are clearly older than you, Mick?! 😉
1337872317410578432 2020-12-13 05:29:51 +0800 <JR66112852> @ivorsawbottom Just like I used to get it in Paris, when I lived there.  I prefer  chunky chips to pommes frites, though.   I'm getting the impression that you might not be using a pseudonym...
1337870529068462083 2020-12-13 05:22:45 +0800 <JR66112852> @ivorsawbottom Precisely! The camera on my tablet is crap!  I broke my mobile today, which would have shown the true depth of colour. 😀
1337869419993845762 2020-12-13 05:18:20 +0800 <JR66112852> @rodgew1 It's the crap camera on the tablet I'm using that makes it look anaemic, as I've dropped my mobile &amp; need a repair!
1337867579755540481 2020-12-13 05:11:02 +0800 <JR66112852> @ivorsawbottom You would have to have tasted it, to score it fairly.   Are you a Vegan, Vegetarian, or just a Common or Garden Troll, Herr von Steiner? 😅  https://t.co/gyBVgp3Ut0

1337864197837889537 2020-12-13 04:57:35 +0800 <JR66112852> @ivorsawbottom Oh dear!  Is that my score out of 10, or is that 2 Stars, Ivor? 😀
1337861512225042435 2020-12-13 04:46:55 +0800 <JR66112852> Just finished - tasted sublime, despite the anaemic-looking photo! 👍😍  https://t.co/sHeuxDHQah

Personally, I find Tonic Water's bitterness a bit of a spoiler with sweet Gin Liqueurs.

1337362853356040193 2020-12-11 19:45:25 +0800 <JR66112852> @AtomicPunk57 Wow! I so admire your honesty &amp; self-discipline.  Genuinely!  Well done, you!   You're still the life of the party - plus, you're saving your liver, your reputation &amp; a pile of dosh!  No downsides! 👍
1337361612005646336 2020-12-11 19:40:29 +0800 <JR66112852> @AlisonW37619617 Whatever could you mean?! 😎😹😂😘  https://t.co/6caVYuhZQr

1337359325875068930 2020-12-11 19:31:24 +0800 <JR66112852> @AtomicPunk57 I was just like you - lifetime teetotal...then this Covid shitstorm made me grab life by the balls (a little harder!) &amp; start trying new things! No salacious details, but Gin Research is a most enjoyable part of my newly reinvigorated lifestyle! 😎🍸
1337357996289089537 2020-12-11 19:26:07 +0800 <JR66112852> @SteveDa15434515 Blimey, even wine-shunning little old me is tempted by that review of La Forge 2018!  And - no!  It's not Wine O'Clock until you're lunching - so maybe wait at least another hour! 😘🍷

I think the majority will be holding up two fingers to this Government interference in our lives, on a night that so many look forward to celebrating, with family &amp; friends...
1337154316638040071 2020-12-11 05:56:46 +0800 <JR66112852> @REGENTmanADB If only the words "lost" and "most" rhymed, Alan, you would have composed a neat verse there! 😉

Can't tar everyone with the same brush, surely?  I feel for those that might look like those who practise the R of P, but actually despise it as much as we do.

Will have to get a bar installed in my lounge for my collection! 😆

My favourite by a country mile is the Rhubarb &amp; Ginger. Always with Cream Soda, for a fab Vanilla blast! 😋👌

He really likes the WN S&amp;BP one, like you &amp; I do. I've just asked him now what his favourite Gin is, as he seems to really know his stuff, judging by photos he's posted up. 😜

(I've a lot to learn, as only started drinking alcohol about three months ago, but am making up for lost time! 😆) Sounds delicious. You must let us know your favourite Gin, some time, as you seem to be an expert in that field! 😉🍸  https://t.co/LvGTE7ix7W

1333158445915250691 2020-11-30 05:18:37 +0800 <JR66112852> Question: If these vaccines really work, why do many of those who do want it insist on everyone else having it, too?  Surely, those who get vaccinated will be protected from being infected by any "anti-vaxxers"?  🤔

No thought for those with health problems here, who NEED public conveniences (eg: Crohn's, etc)!

What I dislike intensely is what the protestors did to their own (very densely-populated) country. The civil unrest was violent &amp; very destructive to buildings &amp; infrastructure. Never good to trash your own environment!

Didn't see the seemingly endless televised reports of the violent, destructive rioting &amp; protests in HK, against China's interference?

Water every week &amp; remove wilting leaves, of course. I also give them the occasional feed. Some are already poor performers, as they keep shedding their leaves, so it can depend on luck!

Your comment matches my own observations at 2 other Test Centres, although they weren't even manned, as there were no "patients"!  The obvious question is: where are the overstretched Test Centres that are feeding the "New Daily Cases" figures to the Govt?
1329494988946886665 2020-11-20 02:41:20 +0800 <JR66112852> From the lack of response to a previous Tweet, launched twice into the Twittersphere, I have to deduce that:  😷🤒NO ONE, WHO HAS BEEN TESTED @ a COVID Test Centre, has waited in a long queue.😷🤒  Can that really be the case?...                     💮RSVP💮

1328717593885233153 2020-11-17 23:12:15 +0800 <JR66112852> @LeonaRoberts12 No - despite that, I think it's just wrong to expect women to feel safe undressing in a room where men are. Some of those he-shes are predatory. As for France, I detested walking past men using urinals, to get to a cubicle! 😖   Glad you understand what it's like, Leona!

1328704103564840960 2020-11-17 22:18:39 +0800 <JR66112852> As a bona fide female, I'm deeply uncomfortable with a man (ie: no womb or vagina at birth) masquerading as a woman, using loos &amp; changing rooms also used by real women.  Yes, I'm a bigot.  Yes, I have had to suffer unisex loos (while living in Paris), so I speak from experience!

1328681308898418691 2020-11-17 20:48:04 +0800 <JR66112852> @BigBillG3 Well said, Big Bill!  Shame we can't trundle you around a few inner-city classrooms, to teach this vital lesson.   Too many chips grafted onto too many low-achievers' little shoulders, from birth!
1328667770519769094 2020-11-17 19:54:16 +0800 <JR66112852> @AtomicPunk57 Good to see someone patriotic to their own country, yet respectful of ours.  I have a first-cousin in Robina, just further south of you by about four hours, BTW.  She's lived there for all her adult life &amp; loves it.
1328656759330844673 2020-11-17 19:10:31 +0800 <JR66112852> @StGeorge44 ...and just imagine us being in the same situation, here, Graham.  The British population being fed dishonest or heavily-filtered news by our MSM...

1328654467823185921 2020-11-17 19:01:24 +0800 <JR66112852> @MegGreen63 As my Mum says: "The onlooker sees most of the show".  (You're spot on, of course, Meg!)

1328636358261403649 2020-11-17 17:49:27 +0800 <JR66112852> This Yank is dissing us all, thanks to our putrid MSM - yet many of us are Trump supporters!  ...Interesting to see how we're viewed through (some) others' eyes, nonetheless.
1328632355268022272 2020-11-17 17:33:32 +0800 <JR66112852> @CoralieAnn The list of "untouchables" is topped off by Islamist reprobates, IMO - with the pure-evil, ubiquitous "grooming gangs" of particular note!  🤬🤬🤬🤬

1328617244998455297 2020-11-17 16:33:30 +0800 <JR66112852> @Farmo05 To compare: Did you see the video of the guy arrested &amp; forcibly held down on the ground by half-a-dozen Police - for not walking away quickly enough, after a dispersal order?!  Indefensible double standards of policing!  WTH has happened? Both should be tried before the Courts!

We all have our struggles with what's happening around us &amp; to us...some days are just harder than others. Sure it's the same for you, if not worse. It's grim!...

I would add, however, that there was no sign of queues for testing, which is exactly my own, personal observation at two hospital-based Covid Test Centres, in two different counties.  @thefatchihuahu - Copying you in, for info.

The fact Mr Prick-in-a-Hi-Vis thinks he can get someone arrested in a town marketplace ('Covid Test Centre'), for asking questions, means he probably can!  So, this could happen in our towns, too. 😡

BTW, you'll need very small amounts of ingredients - eg: two mushrooms between two slices (separated into four) of thins. I use a potato peeler to "grate" the cheese on top - less mess &amp; washing up than using a grater! I used the stir-in pots of pasta sauce.

Most nights, I only go to bed because of the number on the clock - I'm not even sleepy!

NO mention of the £millions they're saving from closing 100s of branches, though! 😤

One thing's for sure - we were blessed to have known much better times for this country &amp; this world - first-hand. We didn't have to endure any World Wars either.

Racial disharmony is being ramped up to fever pitch &amp; a great many of us are very upset at the rhetoric about 'White Privilege" &amp; "Positive Discrimination".

1310151997593661440 2020-09-27 17:39:12 +0800 <JR66112852> Genuine conundrum...

1302203964390354945 2020-09-05 19:16:33 +0800 <JR66112852> When I lived in Paris, I had to endure unisex loos in the office. Felt very uncomfortable to be touching up my 💋💄next to a man re-zipping his flies at the sink - not to mention urine on the floor! Other loos had men in open urinals I had to pass to get to cubicles! Hated it! 😖
