1341365508231340032 2020-12-22 20:50:33 +0800 <tfdavidson> @antkitchener There maybe some research in the health care assistant field?  @CumbriaUHealth
1341364590437916673 2020-12-22 20:46:54 +0800 <tfdavidson> @antkitchener I think you may need to create the research for other people to read..sounds like a valuable contribution to a under-researched area.

1335919489691623426 2020-12-07 20:10:01 +0800 <tfdavidson> @MrCrembo I would offer to call you and sign a Christmas song. But I expect my level singing ability doesn't suit solo work.

Def going to be staring at this instead of doing my PhD.. #1958 @AcademicChatter #PhDCh12 #LakeDistrict  https://t.co/GTq4wBRghl
1329733995232432133 2020-11-20 18:31:04 +0800 <tfdavidson> @hashem_sharifa @ResPara_JB Overall aim it to use a Design Based Research (DVR) method to an educational intervention. Based on create a online cultural diversity programme. I am looking to co-create this programme. So would welcome input! #CH12PHD @CtelLancaster @donpassey
1329732521651744768 2020-11-20 18:25:13 +0800 <tfdavidson> @omeara_p @ResPara_JB Have you seen the UK WRES data? It breaks down into organisations and sectors. Ambulance service performance is dramatically lower in every metric.  https://t.co/H37YN7sK6B
1329732061775736832 2020-11-20 18:23:23 +0800 <tfdavidson> @hashem_sharifa @ResPara_JB Doing a lit review atm-Current Research question- RQ 1 'How are cultural dicersity programmes used within the UK health care workforce. RQ 2 'Can these programmes be delivered effectively online'
1329731226685595649 2020-11-20 18:20:04 +0800 <tfdavidson> @omeara_p @ResPara_JB I would be very interested in seeing if the picture was the same in Australia.
1329731096305610752 2020-11-20 18:19:33 +0800 <tfdavidson> @omeara_p @ResPara_JB Hi Peter, I think we have the same data in the UK. What we don't have is any meaningful analysis of this. It is clear there is issue with underrepresentation, discrimination and a lack of application from diverse backgrounds.
1329708118306148354 2020-11-20 16:48:14 +0800 <tfdavidson> @ResPara_JB Currently researching culture diversity in the ambulance service. Only found 1 research article, and it's in Australia. More research needed to explore the well reported challenge our profession faces.
1329707591572877315 2020-11-20 16:46:09 +0800 <tfdavidson> @ResPara_JB The image is prob give a good example of the challenge of Diversity in the ambulance service. Not just professional, but racial, ethnicity and sexuality.
1329536343123308552 2020-11-20 05:25:40 +0800 <tfdavidson> @HowlettGemma I think it is very hard to know what positive masculinity looks like within the ambulance culture that often reinforces (and commends) toxic masulinity.
1329533139006451714 2020-11-20 05:12:56 +0800 <tfdavidson> Had a great conversation with @HowlettGemma today about positive masculinity.  A lot is quite rightly written about the toxic nature of masculinity with cultures and organisations. But what is the opposite behaviour we need to model and demonstrate? #InternationalMensDay
1329470642387816452 2020-11-20 01:04:36 +0800 <tfdavidson> We are very lucky to have  @loupercussion on our team! Louise brings lots of clinical and educational experience to the team. Can't wait to start work together!
1319564473624154117 2020-10-23 17:01:01 +0800 <tfdavidson> This role will be key to delivering high quality paramedic education within @SECAmbulance.
1308690802684694528 2020-09-23 16:52:56 +0800 <tfdavidson> @clare_fitchett @Swift2Kevin @254Med @DMS_MilMed @TVAirAmb It has been a pleasure to work with you. Army paramedics are in a great place, and that has alot to do with your hard work and dedication.
1301435749032767493 2020-09-03 16:23:56 +0800 <tfdavidson> @HowlettGemma Wow.
