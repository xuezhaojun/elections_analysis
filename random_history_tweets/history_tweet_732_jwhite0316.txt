1343356482352517120 2020-12-28 08:41:58 +0800 <jwhite0316> @washingtonpost No, just reopen without restrictions.
1343345745223626752 2020-12-28 07:59:18 +0800 <jwhite0316> Looks like Goff hurt himself just like Brees did last year in a game vs the Rams.
1343344853258825728 2020-12-28 07:55:45 +0800 <jwhite0316> @MetsUpdate @PrimeTimeBS15 I don’t think I’ve ever seen Drew not score in that situation. And Drew is a lot shorter but every single time, he takes the snap, jumps over the pile, and scores.
1343342759298670593 2020-12-28 07:47:26 +0800 <jwhite0316> @HoldenCantor Just take the snap and jump over the goal line. Every single time the Saints have the ball on the 1, Drew does that and scores 99% of the time. It’s so simple yet most teams don’t do it.
1343342128810905600 2020-12-28 07:44:56 +0800 <jwhite0316> @papajim50475131 I’m a Saints fan and I was screaming that at the TV. Every single time the Saints have the ball on the 1, Drew takes the snap and jumps and scores. It’s so easy. Yet he’s one of the only quarterbacks to do it.
1343341464349270019 2020-12-28 07:42:17 +0800 <jwhite0316> @Fan55Rams I’m a Saints fan and every time we have the ball on the 1, Brees takes the ball and jumps and scores. It’s mind boggling why every NFL quarterback doesn’t do that in that situation.
1343339626753351680 2020-12-28 07:34:59 +0800 <jwhite0316> Why did Goff not jump over the goal line to score like Brees does in that situation?
1343338141932015616 2020-12-28 07:29:05 +0800 <jwhite0316> @SteveDeaceShow Seems like a goon dude. Happy for him. I would much rather play and live in Jacksonville than in New Jersey or New York. Murphy and Cuomo suck and DeSantis is great. Also the weather is a lot better.

1343013312531988482 2020-12-27 09:58:20 +0800 <jwhite0316> @AdamSchefter The Saints have played multiple games without their top WRs.

1342838990429433857 2020-12-26 22:25:38 +0800 <jwhite0316> @ClippersNets @ahiti_j9 @1kzaay_2 @RealSkipBayless The Bucs beat them 38-10. And that game started 10-0 Packers so the Bucs scored 38 unanswered points.
1342838576439029762 2020-12-26 22:24:00 +0800 <jwhite0316> @RealSkipBayless They lost at home to the Saints 38-3 later in the season.

1342611524553236482 2020-12-26 07:21:46 +0800 <jwhite0316> @politico Maybe the restrictions don’t work? Maybe just let the virus run it’s course so we have herd immunity. Just an idea. BTW, young and healthy people are committing suicide and drug overdoses are up because they can’t work or go out. Great job Cali.

1342603835332812801 2020-12-26 06:51:13 +0800 <jwhite0316> That was a good defensive play by Callaway to knock that ball out.

1342108677176655873 2020-12-24 22:03:38 +0800 <jwhite0316> @SteveDeaceShow Billy Joe Tolliver or Billy Joe Hobert. The Ditka years in New Orleans were terrible.

We need 1 more win so that the worse we finish is 11-5 and if the Bucs finish 11-5 too we will win the division. Or 1 more Bucs means the best the can do is

1334643831686516736 2020-12-04 07:41:00 +0800 <jwhite0316> So I got tested for COVID earlier today and it came back positive. I lost my sense of smell and most of sense of taste yesterday. Other than that and having sinus problems that I always get this time of year, I’m fine. My mom has it as well. She has chest congestion but is

1331384622391889920 2020-11-25 07:50:04 +0800 <jwhite0316> @HulkHogan Taker has said that it was Heyman who told him to go meet with Vince. You tried to bury the guy after he “dropped” you on your head (even though your head was more than a foot off the mat) when he tombstoned you to win the title at Survivor Series 1990.
1331100301819064321 2020-11-24 13:00:17 +0800 <jwhite0316> @CarsonGambling @Outkick This is 2 of the last 3 weeks he has played horribly in prime time. His offense was held to 1 field goal 2 weeks ago against the Saints and now tonight. This isn’t not like the KC game.
1331094672018698240 2020-11-24 12:37:55 +0800 <jwhite0316> @TheCousinSal With the loss, the Bucs are now the #6 seed. The Seahawks are currently the #5 seed and would play the NFC East winner in the playoffs.

I had a small section of fence that fell on the back of my property that needs to get fixed so I can put my dog out in the back yard again but other than that we were fine.

1307194657135374336 2020-09-19 13:47:47 +0800 <jwhite0316> @GPIngersoll @heckyessica Completely agree. I’ve seen it retweeted a bunch on my timeline and I watch it over again each time.

But suicides are skyrocketing for people under 30 because of the lockdowns and losing jobs. I don’t want anyone to die but if given the choice between a virus that kills mostly

He still annoys me sometimes but he is the best foreign policy president of the last 50 years and up there with Reagan as the most conservative domestically.

1303490027360526338 2020-09-09 08:26:54 +0800 <jwhite0316> @JesseKellyDC I agree. I said after the 4th of July celebration at Mt. Rushmore, Trump needs to get back on the campaign trail. The media saying it was a dark and scary speech confirmed that. He will win if he stays out of the White House.
