1344064787223891968 2020-12-30 07:36:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’ll start off as 25 and end as 26... scary 😳
1344060859576946688 2020-12-30 07:20:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ballinskelligs2 Its difficult to close my mind as the thoughts seem to circle like a hamster stuck in one of those balls.
1344060566525108226 2020-12-30 07:19:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r I’m never ok really. I just rarely talk about how I feel. The few times I do open up I usually delete it later. But this is honest while being mild enough that people don’t overly worry, so I’ve left it up.
1344058226799742979 2020-12-30 07:10:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Its so cold that even with a hot water bottle I’m shaking
1343875383855349762 2020-12-29 19:03:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It’s hard not to believe everyone hates you, even if rationally you know they don’t, when you hate yourself.
1343624485845553154 2020-12-29 02:26:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I worked xmas eve, had xmas off and worked boxing day up to today. I had no break today because it was too busy. I‘ve only just now had something to eat and am shaking. I‘m in pain and am exhausted. I feel like I’m on the brink of crying all the time. Oh and covids still a thing.
1343456249778679808 2020-12-28 15:18:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD My mum does this. She even used to throw the cats name in on accident too 😂
1343315291670011906 2020-12-28 05:58:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So one time a guy kept yo-yoing between “I’m seeing you” and “we’re just fuck buddies”. He really played with my emotions and messed with my head. He’d want to be with me until he met another woman, then I’d just be his f-buddy again. It makes me sad/angry/confused on reflection.
1343118650375626752 2020-12-27 16:56:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @sadeokayla I don’t really have any steps. It’s literally as basic as cleanse, tone, moisturise 😂
1343113390147956736 2020-12-27 16:36:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Can people please follow the covid rules and yah know, get the vaccine when it’s available to them? A lot of us miss our friends and the antimaskers/vaxer types are not helping anyone.
1343112310232129538 2020-12-27 16:31:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I think my New Years resolution will be to try to stick to a skincare routine. I’ve managed to for 2 weeks already so maybe I can for a year xD
1342961723855294466 2020-12-27 06:33:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado He is definitely an ass hole for not sticking up for her. Theres joking and then there is literally printing someones face on an ugly sweater. Lines were crossed and he was an ass hole to let his family bully her. Though the mum and sister are even bigger ass holes.
1342526468493111296 2020-12-26 01:43:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So my tipsy ass accidentally said Android Lloyd Webber
1342472103233204225 2020-12-25 22:07:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Merry Christmas
1342397831512993792 2020-12-25 17:12:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Same. I’m having pre chaos cat cuddles xD
1342397683131166720 2020-12-25 17:12:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @me_abandon Merry christmas ☺️
1342123719859302402 2020-12-24 23:03:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Glad the test came ok!
1342123319135502336 2020-12-24 23:01:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Send some to Devon please! XD
1342123255776358403 2020-12-24 23:01:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m a slow eater but a fast drinker
1341895216677199873 2020-12-24 07:55:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD I know this feel. Accept for me its like I don’t want to cook but I want to eat the thing 😂
1341894926045474821 2020-12-24 07:54:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Me: Tries to sleep.  My brain: Underground, overground, wombling free!  https://t.co/Fc5Wwty5dC
1341894174271008770 2020-12-24 07:51:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven Thank you. I use the sanitiser frequently on tills. But if I’m pot washing my hands are continually dirty so I avoid touching my face until I get a chance to properly wash my hands
1341893874491514881 2020-12-24 07:50:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD Oh god you are giving me dyspraxic flashbacks. When my boobs grew in rapidly and therefore were still sensitive - I had a period of bumping into the exact same lamp post everyday on the way to school without fail. That sensitive boob bruising kind of feeling is not the one
1341893353156325380 2020-12-24 07:48:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven We have to wear a mask anyway. Gloves can be tricky depending on which area I’m in though. For example the till screen won’t let me click on things if I have gloves on. Also the gloves are too big for me so it can make things I’m carrying slide around
1341892776540184577 2020-12-24 07:45:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraCantHear Personally if your work is long term/permanent I’d say go with the location closer to work. Especially of you are neurodivergent, disabled or have some kind of health issue - a shorter commute can be life changingly beneficial.
1341892175622242304 2020-12-24 07:43:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD This I can empathise with. Dyspraxia is sometimes called DCD (developmental coordination disorder). The name is so misleading as it gives the impression its a childhood thing or something you grow out of. So most adults prefer to call it dyspraxia.
1341891607864471552 2020-12-24 07:41:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven I’ll survive, its more the fact that theres the whole covid thing that has me worried as I am in a customer facing/also cleaning up peoples food kind of role. I can already sense the rule breakers, the dirty napkins, the last minute xmas shoppers rushing in for coffee 😬
1341891001657470977 2020-12-24 07:38:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RayeofFunshine Omg I love folklore and old fairy tales!
1341890628435718147 2020-12-24 07:37:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven I can’t speak for everyone else, but knowing I’m working xmas eve AND boxing day during a pandemic has me pretty cranky 😭😂
1341890318342512641 2020-12-24 07:35:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919  https://t.co/7uqjK632Tu
1341889882105532417 2020-12-24 07:34:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Well I have to work in a customer facing role on xmas eve during a pandemic... in tier 2 where people seem to act no different aside from they have masks on. May the gods protect me in these scary times.
1341818885847339010 2020-12-24 02:52:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell I try to call things out. But it doesn’t do much because I don’t have a title like “PhD”, neither am I in a job role where my input on the matter would be respected. I share my perspective and make it clear when somethings not so great. But it tends to only matter to ND peeps.
1341783071989915650 2020-12-24 00:29:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> We should be going into lockdown, not this tier stuff.
1341699079403925504 2020-12-23 18:56:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @eliasyassin_ Ohh the title alone is juicy. I’ll look it up. Thanks ☺️
1341697546826248192 2020-12-23 18:49:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Le cries - I can’t even drink because I’m working the next day 😭  Even on xmas day I just won’t drink the day before I have to work because I like to be on the ball with my work.
1341697208018751488 2020-12-23 18:48:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Does anyone have any recommendations for feminist books, podcast or just general feminist content that isn’t transphobic? Same question but for feminist content that doesn’t go against the rights of sex workers. I want to do some reading but don’t want to fund any gobshite.
1341679315327590402 2020-12-23 17:37:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose I have to work xmas eve and boxing day 😭
1341673307582713856 2020-12-23 17:13:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I love my cat, but it seems she doesn’t want me to get up 😂  https://t.co/ySsXUrGMNS
1341667432491003904 2020-12-23 16:50:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @emmatsalageek Institution.
1341666598604693504 2020-12-23 16:46:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MsKackiV I want to focus more on what/how much I eat rather than weight. I have an eating disorder and its supposed to be bad to focus on weight or numbers when you are trying to recover
1341521034927894530 2020-12-23 07:08:33 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Can I wave a wand and make my stretch marks/flab disappear? I used to have a genuinely nice figure. But now even if I get fit enough to have that figure again I will likely have stretch marks and loose skin. I know looks aren’t everything but sometimes a gal wants to feel pretty
1341307261818429441 2020-12-22 16:59:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Does anyone else get reverse hangovers where you are actually really awake and have loads of energy the next day?
1341060676232634368 2020-12-22 00:39:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Two days off work now. Let the solstice celebrations commence!
1340804788410347523 2020-12-21 07:42:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 As a Brit I say full stop. It looks weird written I agree. But when spoken I use it to emphasise if something is important or that no means NO rather than “no... but”. So if I say I don’t like coconut and someone asks if I like bounty’s I’d say I don’t like coconut full stop
1340699192130453507 2020-12-21 00:42:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just watched this brilliant video by @mexieYT and honestly, here’s a link because you definitely need to watch it folks  https://t.co/0nmbm3lx90
1340437987319046144 2020-12-20 07:24:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @shiraisinspired There is too many to choose. But I categorise my playlists by mood, genre or theme. I go through phases though where I either listen to the same artist, band or song over and over.
1340436798430978048 2020-12-20 07:20:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Its worrying doing a customer facing role during covid. Most of us want to be safe but need the money so have no choice but to put ourselves at risk clearing your dirty tissues or leftover food/drink. The least you can do is follow the rules that are in place, don’t flout them.
1340419331918880777 2020-12-20 06:10:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This I can agree with.
1340385651749957633 2020-12-20 03:56:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Saraheboon “Have you lost weight” it’s not a compliment.
1340374131209072641 2020-12-20 03:11:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I really hope Jaime wins strictly! #StrictlyFinal #StrictlyComeDancing
1340360442636546051 2020-12-20 02:16:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @jonniegrieve I’m the opposite. Love LOTR less keen on Harry Potter.   Sam Gamgee is just, I want him to be my best friend 😂  I’m also quite obsessed with elves so it has that going for it too
1340360080127045633 2020-12-20 02:15:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Can you go tomorrow? Or can she maybe pack some essentials and take the coach?
1340357852393816064 2020-12-20 02:06:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m personally offended by such a statement 😂  I’m kidding obvs... but LOTR is legit the best my dudes
1340357487866818560 2020-12-20 02:05:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose When lockdown happened earlier in the year I came home when it was announced as I didn’t want to risk it so if she wants to and can I’d recommend she come home asap
1340352294970417153 2020-12-20 01:44:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> THIS 👇
1340193242827132929 2020-12-19 15:12:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LeksiW I like both. Maybe thats because I’m bi 😂
1339544592656572420 2020-12-17 20:14:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Tbh spanish and italian are the sexiest languages. But irish has the sexiest accent.   There you go.  https://t.co/5OyWCH3Ak1
1339541833928601601 2020-12-17 20:03:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Saraheboon Yes
1339513323969232899 2020-12-17 18:10:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah Eh if things get too bad I will. But I’m not taking any risks when I’m so new
1339512011525410817 2020-12-17 18:05:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah My colleagues are nice but the general lack of awareness of this stuff in society makes me reluctant to bring it up yah know?
1339509128939581441 2020-12-17 17:53:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TrystanJones39 @AyoCaesar It’s posh to me. But I know for a fact that there are people out there that don’t consider it posh. So that’s where my logic of it feeling posh comes from 😂  Side note - it’s actually my favourite place to eat. Their pizzas are peek
1339507218530652160 2020-12-17 17:46:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Pizza express 😂
1339507037781299201 2020-12-17 17:45:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah I’ve mentioned it but I don’t want to overdo it as often people haven’t heard of it and if they have they think it’s an excuse. And I also don’t want to annoy people. They hired me to help, not to slow them down yah know?
1339494855593103364 2020-12-17 16:57:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah I don’t have a lanyard and the sunflower lanyard website seems to indicate that it is for customers not staff. As for my boss, I am new and already slower than everyone else so I dob’t want to seem like I’m causing trouble by asking.
1339352738640097280 2020-12-17 07:32:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MHMegC Mine is 8kg and I love it

1339323238866890753 2020-12-17 05:35:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Same
1339317546881716227 2020-12-17 05:12:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TripleTakeover For me it’s more - are my feet sticking out? No sleep for me. Are my shoulders sticking out? No sleep for me
1339317329583333381 2020-12-17 05:11:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Agreed. Yule logs are the only acceptable winter pudding and I will be fully indulging on a vegan Yule log this upcoming solstice!
1339310745813741573 2020-12-17 04:45:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Yes

1339302453028806656 2020-12-17 04:12:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I just need a friend. Ideally one that’s as ready for a hug as I am 😔

1339270961305165824 2020-12-17 02:07:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Lol lack of services for children... just wait until you become dyspraxic adults 😂  Jokes aside I do hope that the next generation get better support than we ever did.
1339181435916341249 2020-12-16 20:11:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics I’m torn between HRVY or Jaime
1339176339975397376 2020-12-16 19:51:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @AutiLeven Don’t get me wrong, I think it is fine to tweet about your own diagnosis. My point is more that when addressing the #NeurodiverseSquad remember that we really are diverse. Address/include the whole squad, not just some. Hope that makes sense!
1339175184641781761 2020-12-16 19:46:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QLMentoring Squeels with excitement!
1339174894538534912 2020-12-16 19:45:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just sent off some cards to the USA for my lovely pagan friends @LifeWithChibi and @VixenFae88 💞
1339171275693043713 2020-12-16 19:31:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Don’t get me wrong I’m not saying DON’T tweet re ADHD/autism. What I am saying is that if you are tweeting about a wider #NeurodiverseSquad thing maybe just mention ND squad but not x diagnosis. I always separate my dyspraxia specific content from my ND content as we are diverse
1339169697309265921 2020-12-16 19:25:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I really hope I can finally go LARPing in 2021. I wanted to this year, but alas 2020 had other plans 😭
1339169312544796673 2020-12-16 19:23:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This 👇  Also #NeurodiverseSquad is exactly that - diverse. Our alphabet spans beyond the letter A.
1339168624175702016 2020-12-16 19:20:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Please tell me at lease ONE of my followers appreciates this song  https://t.co/Ohi6mc44GT
1339168194473447424 2020-12-16 19:19:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven I agree
1339166735912538113 2020-12-16 19:13:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> THIS 👇  @AutiLeven you are fabulous ☺️
1339166525476003843 2020-12-16 19:12:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven I fully apprieciate that. And to clarify, I know its not everyone who does it. And when I see people such as yourself clarify, it makes my heart sing. But the fact it happens so often when you are fighting for your diagnosis to get recognition anyway, it can bog you down
1339165449523748869 2020-12-16 19:08:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven Its mainly frustrating when people mention meurodiverse squad but then use autism and adhd tags (or mention just autism and adhd) as if the rest of us don’t exist. Having to constantly remind people that the neurodiverse squad goes beyond the letter A can be tiring. But I get you
1339163602683621378 2020-12-16 19:00:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Seeing threads you agree with that you want to RT but the threads only include autism/ADHD in their ideas of neurodiversity despite others sharing similar/the same as whats being described. I know I sound salty in these posts, but please remember how diverse #NeurodiverseSquad is
1339160401423065089 2020-12-16 18:48:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef @RachelCDailey Yes I’m lop sided all the time. The right side the leg and foot hurts. Left side its the knee and back. Its aweful
1339159044423028736 2020-12-16 18:42:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef @RachelCDailey I get the tightness and restricted movement too. Was literally limping by the end of work on Monday
1339158014738247680 2020-12-16 18:38:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JamesWafer85 I have heard mostly good things about it and it seems quite known in UK shops/cafes etc. I haven’t worn one as a customer as I don’t want the extra attention. But I have been in so much pain at work that if there was something like the sunflower scheme for staff it’d help me lots
1339154670808428545 2020-12-16 18:25:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I wish you could ware the sunflower lanyard as a staff member, because I am fine in everyday life, but when I work I cause myself physical pain just to keep up. And the pain can make me slower so I cause myself even more pain just to make sure I’m being fast enough/not annoying.
1339151308457172997 2020-12-16 18:12:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Ahh yeah double wammied then
1339147847128788992 2020-12-16 17:58:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I'm not writing because of the way the world and the second one is.
1339146051454951424 2020-12-16 17:51:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Do you think because everyone is doing vlogmas uploads are taking longer? 🤔  A couple of youtubers I watch have mentioned uploads being slower atm
1338995398250291200 2020-12-16 07:52:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Genuinely gutted there was no #Eurovision this year 😔  At least I could rewatch the Father Ted eurovision episode 😂  https://t.co/oMu4UlXbQF

1338988752392376321 2020-12-16 07:26:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer I like your thinking. And what a name! 😂
1338987965092159489 2020-12-16 07:23:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer Perhaps when they settled they kind of lost touch to the point they were just kind of their own thing and thought screw it, if those northern lot can take them we can too 😂
1338987213250588672 2020-12-16 07:20:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer I thought the Normans came from France(ish) while the Vikings came from Scandinavia. But thats me trying so hard to remember history I learned over 15 years ago 😂

1338597129128972296 2020-12-15 05:30:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So well deserved. @DysSingSongMike is an asset to the #dyspraxic community and the #NeurodiverseSquad more widely.   Did you know he created a charity single for @Equipped4L? You can listen to it on this link  https://t.co/X9ewdTWev9  While you’re at it, why not give him a follow!

1338251167755800580 2020-12-14 06:35:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just so you guys know, not every #neurodivergent person finds reading fun and easy. Generalising in this way, especially when it comes from other neurodivergent people, can add to feelings of guilt and/or shame around reading difficulties. Be mindful please #NeurodiverseSquad 🙏

1338224208904671238 2020-12-14 04:48:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So glad Jaime got saved in Strictly. I love Bill Bailey, but I think he should have been voted out this week as he sadly was the worst dancer this week. Definitely sad to see Ranveer leave, the music to her waltz legit made me tear up
1338196614914207744 2020-12-14 02:58:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD I drop things a lot
1338033321419427840 2020-12-13 16:09:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I try mostly to say woman or man rather than male or female. It humanises people beyond simply biological function. Just as an example, it feels very odd to say “I am a female” but saying “I am a woman” just feels right, yah get me?
1337885799682088969 2020-12-13 06:23:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver I love the penguin!
1337885526297374720 2020-12-13 06:22:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 So thats why I dreamt about gay pirates 😂
1337875640654188546 2020-12-13 05:43:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Does anyone know why facebook would show that there is a mod alert in a group, only to not show anything up when you click on it?
1337837874117550089 2020-12-13 03:12:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Agreed
1337837090764169219 2020-12-13 03:09:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Believe it or not I have experienced worse but as it wasn’t in the dyspraxic community I didn’t mention it in my blog
1337834870001766400 2020-12-13 03:01:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> He literally made a wordpress account called “Pond” just to leave a link to his podcast on my blog. He’s honestly getting obsessed. I marked it as spam so any future comments he makes will automatically get lost in the ether 😂
1337828475303026688 2020-12-13 02:35:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @PerplexedSeal I’ve read their replies to lots of people on the thread. They are rude, obnoxious and a tad hypocritical. Don’t think I’ll be engaging with that person anytime soon
1337822880437055490 2020-12-13 02:13:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @PerplexedSeal This makes me cringe on a few counts. Firstly I hope people don’t think I share her views because I have ‘wombman’ in my handle. Secondly as a pagan seeing people say ‘thank goddess’ or ‘oh my goddess’ makes me cringe. Thirdly I’m disabled, I’m not a person WITH a disability.
1337811983027073026 2020-12-13 01:30:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax *have
1337811890429456384 2020-12-13 01:29:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Plus on top of all that we potentially will hand brexit delaying deliveries and post. As someone with a lot of foreign family it’s a worry, but I know it is by no means the fault of the postalforce
1337782843821404161 2020-12-12 23:34:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Wow, I’m shook. Who’d have thunk it 😑
1337764769672081408 2020-12-12 22:22:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Literally this. Though with the caveat that some learning difficulties are disabilities, but they aren’t learning disabilities. Dyspraxia is a learning difficulty and a disability, but it is not a learning disability.
1337737096967098369 2020-12-12 20:32:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Why oh why can’t I get tearin’ up my heart by nsync out of my head 🙃
1337726411029835777 2020-12-12 19:50:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef Honestly 😂
1337714278170824706 2020-12-12 19:01:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef Thanks. Likewise. It’s just so frustrating that because I simply talk about women I am seen to be this radical man hater 🙃😬😂
1337690932540542977 2020-12-12 17:29:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It’s her birthday today. Well what we are calling her birthday, she’s adopted so we don’t know her real birthday. But today marks one year of having Melody in the family. She’s around 9 in human years now which happens to be my favourite number ☺️  https://t.co/r4dkStpcDx
1337551741718581254 2020-12-12 08:16:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Folding a normal blanket is hard enough when you are dyspraxic, folding a weighted blanket is some next level skills
1337547337556758530 2020-12-12 07:58:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @nicoleloisee I mean I’m not going to say it actually settles a dodgy stomach. But I imagine alcoholic ginger beer or ginger wine (sometimes called green wine) would be better than most considering that ginger is known to be good for nausea and the like.
1337544111382011905 2020-12-12 07:45:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD Wait... is executive function the reason I stay in bed scrolling on my phone even though I gotta pee? If so I didn’t know this was actually a thing 🙈😅😂

1337421117955444738 2020-12-11 23:36:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron It is indeed
1337421014872059913 2020-12-11 23:36:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicDiva That first sentence should have read: I think their problem is that I talk about women.
1337420870910873601 2020-12-11 23:35:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicDiva I think that the problem them (and others have) is that I talk about women. They seem to have it in their head that I only care about women/hate men. This is of course far from the truth, I have spoken in support of men’s issues many times and do call out women if/when needed.
1337418011792257024 2020-12-11 23:24:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r I agree that it’s silly. I wrote my own blog post to get things off my chest and then move forward, but this individual couldn’t help himself. I’ve listened to some of it and they accuse a mutual of ours if only supporting women to boost his own brand - of course that’s rubbish
1337384543293218816 2020-12-11 21:11:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I have also been approached by a dyspraxic gent as I run an LGBT+ dyspraxia group. He wants to set up an LGBT+ men’s meeting which I fully support and intend to promote once it launches.   To say I don’t support or listen to men is frankly a lie.
1337384541481263104 2020-12-11 21:11:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just so you know there is actually a regular meeting for dyspraxic men which I support fully. The only reason I haven’t promoted it is because the organiser wanted to keep it small and requested that I don’t share it widely. 1/2
1337382343766646784 2020-12-11 21:02:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Lol apparently I’m sexist because I wanted to educate myself on neurodivergent women. Who’d have thought a person that is a neurodivergent woman would want to educate herself on issues that directly impact her. What a crazy world we live in ey 🙃 (sarcasm obvs)
1337381710611279872 2020-12-11 21:00:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JamesWafer85 Thank you James 🙏
1337365734163443714 2020-12-11 19:56:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apparently another podcast has been made, this time about my blog. If folk send abuse my way you‘ll be blocked. Also there‘s another dyspraxic woman whose been getting online harassment as a direct result of my blog post. Bring issues you have to me, leave others out of it.
1337334279009935360 2020-12-11 17:51:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Agreed. Though it’s scary how many people I have spoken to who have thought the opposite. And that just makes me scared of those people tbh. Same with the gun lovers (though I get why in other countries some feel they have no choice in order to feel safe).
1337158890941804546 2020-12-11 06:14:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r I came up with a definition earlier that dyspraxia makes me bump into/drop things a lot and means I have the memory of a sieve.  https://t.co/Hszc8cvFOr
1337158120456531973 2020-12-11 06:11:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD I was a, “reading literally gives me a headache/stresses me out because I’m slower than everyone else and trying to keep up is too much pressure” kind of neurodivergent child
1336957080834613250 2020-12-10 16:53:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U How on earth do you measure “let’s make it happen” and “seizing the future”? 🙃
1336800532934127619 2020-12-10 06:30:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As someone who has just started getting into football this makes me so sad. I hope some players/countries boycott it or stage walk offs. Something, anything to show they are not ok with this. (To clarify the flags = good, the locking people up = bad)
1336799358398980098 2020-12-10 06:26:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So I find it funny when LGBT content creators who “left the left” make videos that end by asking people not to judge people for their political opinions... after spending an entire video judging people for their political opinions. Oh the hypocrisy 😂
1336789367038369792 2020-12-10 05:46:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 If America is Karen the UK is Verruca Salt 😂  https://t.co/8Db47XEB20
1336659728919826432 2020-12-09 21:11:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Yeah that tbh is harassment. Big fringe lady and her fans are the definition of abuse of power.
1336658789823614976 2020-12-09 21:07:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I can’t believe they‘re THAT obsessed they are going onto unrelated tweets to get at autistic people. Do they have nothing better to do with their time? How on earth can they justify this? Is a celebrities ego more important than actually autistic people? Baffling.

1336610494409543681 2020-12-09 17:55:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef Sometimes. It very much depends on the person. Most of my uni lecturers were amazing though!
1336438652168232961 2020-12-09 06:32:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #AccessibleAdvent 8 As a dyspraxic woman I find it very difficult to maintain energy let alone focus when I am on my period. Lightening the load when it comes to everyday tasks helps get routine without overwhealming during these times.

1336274791028940807 2020-12-08 19:41:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So many people call dyspraxia a learning disability when in face it is a learning difficulty. It is possible for a learning difficulty to also be a disability, dyspraxia for instance is. But a learning disability is something quite different.
1336254978827104258 2020-12-08 18:23:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow Us should say it
1336254845423144960 2020-12-08 18:22:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I didn’t know that this👌meant white power for a long time as I grew up using us to kind of kiss and blow out if food was really good or used it to say ok or nice etc. It’s a habit from childhood that I have to force myself not to do and get very worried if I do it accidentally
1336113536330838023 2020-12-08 09:01:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado Yes. Bit of worstersher sauce sprinkled over red-Lester thats melted on top of a shepherds pie, perfection 👌
1336110887187394561 2020-12-08 08:50:33 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @draevans Depends what I’m having the chips with. Usually ketchup or gravy
1336099005948956678 2020-12-08 08:03:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I NEED one of those cross-legged chairs. Cross-legged is one of the only comfortable seating positions for me!
1336094438398025735 2020-12-08 07:45:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow That looks so tasty!
1336055222033133569 2020-12-08 05:09:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Yeah but I haven’t watched it because I have too much nostalgia for the original
1336036914500153346 2020-12-08 03:56:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The fact that there are kids who think new charmed is the only charmed hurts my soul
1336032548015763460 2020-12-08 03:39:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutisticPb @DyspraxicWomen @EmilyyNics Thank you! You are too kind ☺️🙏💞
1336024211727523840 2020-12-08 03:06:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Anyone else thing 2020 is ending with an alien invasion because of these monoliths! 🤣  https://t.co/lCyZZm5HB8

1335980999180685315 2020-12-08 00:14:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ok but, there is just something so atmospheric about listening to opera in the bath.
1335941210091913218 2020-12-07 21:36:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 1. Dyspraxic women have started sharing their stories.   2. The community share and support each other’s content.   3. We help each other and support each other when times are tough.   #AdvocateDontComplicate   My 3 peeps 👇 @4licerose  @dyspraxicchef  @EmilyyNics
1335937135640186884 2020-12-07 21:20:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Alex_H_Robs I’m inclined to agree. I think it’s certainly better/more accurate than their traditional model in terms of being a realistic shape. But that’s about the only points it gets from me. And that’s coming from a woman who is the size this is supposed to represent
1335934050322800642 2020-12-07 21:07:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RayeofFunshine I’ll admit though I always found bratz better when I was growing up!   But yes the name “barbie extra” is unfortunate. I wonder if they are charging extra too 😂
1335902733753315329 2020-12-07 19:03:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AsToldByJoanna Mate last christmas will always be THE christmas song
1335902452420407298 2020-12-07 19:02:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RayeofFunshine Thats why I’m conflicted on it. Like its better than before, but as someone who was curvy even as a teen - she still looks closer in body to my less curvy peers
1335895107720114176 2020-12-07 18:33:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Not sure what I think of this new “curvy” barbie
1335892529414348800 2020-12-07 18:22:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef Thank you ☺️
1335889956129148928 2020-12-07 18:12:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AZelasi A little fact for people reading this thread. There‘s actually a lot of cross-over between autism &amp; dyspraxia too. Dyspraxia is part of the #NeurodiverseSquad but awareness is low so few people know or speak about it. But we do overlap and a lot of dyspraxics are also autistic ☺️
1335741253464576003 2020-12-07 08:21:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Do the thing people. Go subscribe 👇
1335736114817232899 2020-12-07 08:01:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m curious, if you follow me, are you are dyspraxic?  (ND stands for neurodivergent, NT stands for neurotypical, dx stands for diagnosis.)
1335716507821682689 2020-12-07 06:43:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This is one of the best soaps around for LGBT+ rep and they are soon going go be having a character with a cochlear implant too. It has the balance between light hearted and gritty soap - great daily escapism. Sign to keep @NeighboursTV on air during xmas!  https://t.co/iLZjdT9S3k
1335692133269970945 2020-12-07 05:06:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So, my period tracker now has a craving tracking option which tbh could be really helpful in terms of my binge eating to track what I crave at different points in my cycle. I could start planning my diet accordingly once I notice the patterns!
1335620988243992576 2020-12-07 00:23:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #AccessibleAdvent 6 Its hard to pick out your voice when there is background noise. Be patient, be slow, take me to a quieter area.
1335603058714304513 2020-12-06 23:12:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 💕
1335567005697585160 2020-12-06 20:49:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow That’s a good idea. My fingers are crossed for you!
1335566192648609794 2020-12-06 20:46:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow That sounds like a right pain in the neck. And I’m guessing messaging their twitter or facebook page won’t help?
1335559385737797633 2020-12-06 20:19:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow That’s awful. I would drop suggestions but I am sure you’d have already tried them. Is there a facebook group for members at all? Perhaps someone else had the same issue who could help 🤔
1335558666217533440 2020-12-06 20:16:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow Thats fair. I hope things go well for you with the green party!
1335558251551879168 2020-12-06 20:14:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I can understand that. And again if there is anything I can do I am ready to listen, learn and act. I am also a friend should you need or want one 💞
1335557623643508736 2020-12-06 20:12:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow Sadly I have seen this too. I do combat it when I come across it and the places I do have a degree of control in there is zero tolerance for TERFyness. But if there is more I can do I am more than open to listening, learning and acting
1335557220122157057 2020-12-06 20:10:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I agree. While I am LGBT myself I don’t really feel like, nor do I actively participate in the community (aside from a very small LGBT dyspraxia group) so I wouldn’t know where to start there. But I do actively combat TERFs/their values when I come across them in feminist spaces
1335556666151067649 2020-12-06 20:08:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I can totally empathise. I think I am opposite in that for me being politically active preserves my mental health to a degree. Because if I keep ‘fighting’ I keep hoping. Without hope I have nothing, so for me it is vital.
1335555812165562368 2020-12-06 20:04:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TripleTakeover I retweeted this because you summed things up so well. Thank you 🙏
1335555627779764225 2020-12-06 20:04:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow It makes me sad that people get told they can’t be feminist. Equally it makes me sad that because of shitty people like TERFs and misandrous feminists, there is a perception that all feminists are toxic. On my end I need to be feminist to combat the toxicity on both ends
1335552482890616832 2020-12-06 19:51:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow There are toxic sides to every idea, community, movement etc. I’d personally say their view on what it means to be feminist is reductive. Literally ANYONE can be a feminist. If a feminist excludes x group they aren’t truly for the rights of all women or even all people.
1335520971168624641 2020-12-06 17:46:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The backlash myself/other dyspraxic women received online has made me realise that just talking about women’s issues, even running a women’s group - isn’t enough anymore. Something more radical is needed. So today, I come out loud and proud to tell you that I am a feminist. 8/8
1335520969486692352 2020-12-06 17:46:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Even though my dissertation was very much feminist, still involved with the charity, advocated for dyspraxic women online and started a dyspraxia women’s group - I still was scared to call myself feminist. But this has all changed, strangely because of more harassment. 7/8
1335520967800594432 2020-12-06 17:46:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It was getting diagnosed with dyspraxia in combination with my studies at uni that made me realise that feminism is needed now more than ever, and that it needs to be intersectional. But for a long time despite this I was still to scared to actually call myself feminist. 6/8
1335520966068346886 2020-12-06 17:46:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I was scared to use the word feminism let alone talk about women’s issues. So I found women that weren’t feminists and used their arguments to justify in my head why I too was not feminist. If I hadn’t gotten diagnosed with dyspraxia I might still be in that headspace. 5/8
1335520963191066630 2020-12-06 17:46:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It got to a point where if I heard women’s issues being talked about is get angry and think to myself ‘what about men’. I persuaded myself that feminism was a bad word, all because of the trauma and stress I experienced as a result of being harassed for being a feminist. 4/8
1335520961458802688 2020-12-06 17:46:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I ended up watching videos of women talking about why they aren’t feminist and stopped talking about the charity despite still being involved. I persuaded myself that you don’t need feminism anymore and that I wasn’t a feminist despite having all the same views as before. 3/8
1335520959265198081 2020-12-06 17:46:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hostile for me simply being involved with a women’s charity. They called me and the charity sexist for not ‘helping’ men. They would tell me feminism isn’t needed and constantly would make jokes about sexually assaulting or r-ing women. It made me feel quite uncomfortable. 2/8
1335520956480106496 2020-12-06 17:46:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> You know, I used to be scared to call myself a feminist. Not because of any woman, but because of aggression I received from men. I got involved with a charity for young women and some young men I knew were far from happy about it. Out of nowhere they became hostile. 1/8
1335515248896446464 2020-12-06 17:23:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @colorfulmandala @krystalbellax I totally understand why you would be unhappy with the toxic side of feminism. However questioning a woman for simply talking about gender does nothing to combat any of that. I’m all for being critical of things when there is a valid reason - simply talking about gender isn’t one
1335512700999393280 2020-12-06 17:13:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @agvbergin Unfortunately not sure what kind I just know they are owls
1335409230791192578 2020-12-06 10:22:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Being able to hear owls singing at 2:20am makes my heart sing  https://t.co/TavQ1S7lt2
1335302564083085316 2020-12-06 03:18:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m grateful other women have felt comfortable to confide in me since posting my blog. But let’s not pretend mutual suffering is a good thing. Yes we aren’t alone, but it sucks that ANY woman experiences sexism/misogyny. The fact we aren’t alone highlights a communal problem.
1335296019114778624 2020-12-06 02:52:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Here the question I’d add as a secondary poll would be gender breakdown for what seem to be the biggest categories 👇  Pre-18 M Pre-18 W No/self diagnosis M No/self diagnosis W
1335242169158934531 2020-12-05 23:18:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #AccessibleAdvent 5 To be honest today’s one is just to literally educate yourself on disability. Consume content by disabled people, don’t just listen to people talking about us. Really engage with us, respect our language preferences and our needs.
1335220755144056835 2020-12-05 21:53:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Thank you Billy! Your continued support and our collaborating is an absolute blessing 🙏🌟 #InternationalVolunteerDay
1335181300362252289 2020-12-05 19:16:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I agree to a large degree though even the eastern religions I don’t fully resonate with. Buddhism out of the eastern religions I probably resonate the strongest with. I find ancient religion interesting but so much of them is lost to us!
1335180336821645314 2020-12-05 19:12:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado Hkeon
1335179777360195585 2020-12-05 19:10:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow There are many philosophies buzzing round my head that link with your view of everyone being ghosts. It’s hard to sum up my view in a tweet but I think there are SMALL nuggets of truth in all faiths/philosophies/spiritualities. Piecing them together is the challenge.
1335177979102703616 2020-12-05 19:03:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I know the mothman prophecies but not the 8th tower so I’ll definitely look into that!
1335177802140807168 2020-12-05 19:02:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I must admit I have avoided UFO communities for that reason. And haven’t spoken much about paganism either because there are a lot of skeptics and weirdly also Christians who follow me
1335177098546343941 2020-12-05 19:00:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I shall look these up as I  very much of a similar line of thinking to you when it comes to UFOs
1335176217520123908 2020-12-05 18:56:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I like the idea that UFOs for us are the modern day version of faery sightings. As someone who finds UFOs and aliens interesting but LOVES faerys, that idea makes me very happy ☺️ 2/2
1335175949273403392 2020-12-05 18:55:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I don’t know if it helps or not but I have some of my own ideas about UFOs that are totally non political. So UFOs our our way of explaining unexplained phenomena and in the past folklore was their way to explain these things. Like faeries and stuff. 1/2

1335161139546763264 2020-12-05 17:56:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Lotty_ONeill This is truly amazing and beautifully done! Very touching, artistic AND educational. Absolutely love it. I’m going to have to ware my hair up for the rest of time now though 😂
1335159815761489920 2020-12-05 17:51:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Mate if someone gives me a present or card early I genuinely can’t wait. I have to open it then and there 🤣
1335155513781260289 2020-12-05 17:34:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RayeofFunshine I have had heavy quilts on holiday before that have done a similar job. But heavy quilts see, to be harder to find than weighted blankets!

1335003657021116417 2020-12-05 07:30:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Time to sleep with my nice, scrumptiously cosy weighted blanket. My god you have no idea how cosy it is. No more cold, loose sticking out feet. Sleeping feeling I’m getting a hug, nice, warm and toasty. Its also not too thick. Can’t state how perfect it is.
1334969857272668161 2020-12-05 05:16:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> More like saved in my head.   Moss-Atlas (First Boy) Fern-Euphemia (First Gal) Killian-Felix (Second Boy) Thistle-Heather (Second Gal)

1334926449707511812 2020-12-05 02:24:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Omg I got a weighted blanket as a late birthday present. I’m so happy 😭💕
1334917953503043584 2020-12-05 01:50:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax That’s understandable. I just figure even if you can’t join the union if you contact them they may know services that could help you seeing as they specialise with disability
1334912516443549696 2020-12-05 01:28:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Isnt pip a non-work thing? Because disability union isn’t just for work. They represent disabled people when making benefits claims, if they have housing issues etc
1334904773183762434 2020-12-05 00:57:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax You should contact the disability union. They can help with appeals!

1334809756247220224 2020-12-04 18:40:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow Same. I also had a PE teacher give me a detention for being off school despite the fact I had been away for a funeral.
1334808507082825729 2020-12-04 18:35:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow Same. The only time I thrived was I taught myself to swim, then got lessons and was one of the best. Also I had a really good surf instructor who rather than get annoyed, he cheered you on each time
1334808072372576256 2020-12-04 18:33:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Lotty_ONeill This looks AMAZING!

1334671723363512321 2020-12-04 09:31:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So #neighbours has a trans actress that also acts a trans character who started as a guest and later became a regular. They now have a guest actor with a cochlear implant coming in, it’d be amazing if he became a regular too! Great news on #IDPWD2020! 😍  https://t.co/riPlQd1WLO
1334668102102102017 2020-12-04 09:17:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron I recommend reading about the links between hypermobility and dyspraxia as I often see it listed as a symptom
1334667451276079104 2020-12-04 09:14:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron I heard that hypermobility can be part of dyspraxia
1334662486054883330 2020-12-04 08:55:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutismBoat Its also a bit... backward to place these kind of expectation around fashion, dress, aesthetic etc upon women anyway. And to assess weather a woman is autistic or not through this lens is sketchy to say the least. And why should one mans definition of femininity define us all?
1334661532408483841 2020-12-04 08:51:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics Thank you Emily 💕
1334582589559074817 2020-12-04 03:37:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Really loving this stream. Unfortunately I am going to have to watch the rest a bit later but my gosh it’s fantastic. I strongly recommend my followers check it out!
1334575392766767110 2020-12-04 03:09:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> THIS 👇  Thank you so much to @QueerlyAutistic for this thread. Seriously I could not have put it better myself!
1334575151858511874 2020-12-04 03:08:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Thank you for this thread. You managed to put this into words much better than I did!
1334569372845826048 2020-12-04 02:45:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #AccessibleAdvent 3 happens to coincide with #IDPWD2020. I have friends who rely on the @sunflwrlanyards to do things like go to the shop. At the moment people are mistakingly thinking the lanyard is only to signify mask exemption. This is not true.

1334468534613790720 2020-12-03 20:04:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I can’t speak for the whole neurodivergent community but I for one have no issues with mental illness being included. I think when it comes to matters of the mind, someone identifying as neurodivergent makes perfect sense. But there may be angles I haven’t considered
1334467732063064066 2020-12-03 20:01:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I clarified the differences because if you look at each, many mental illnesses are stigmatised for being different from the norm. And by that logic I can see why mental illness could be seen as being neurodivergent, especially with the crossovers that you highlighted
1334466541975449600 2020-12-03 19:56:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty A group of minds might be neurodiverse but only an individual can be neurodivergent.   My first tweet plus this are how I’ve understood it.
1334466334613266436 2020-12-03 19:55:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I had always understood neurodiversity to refer to the natural diversity of human minds/brains.   To be neurodivergent would be to have a mind that deviates from socially accepted norms.   And neurominority would refer to specific groups that are neurodivergent.
1334297624883712002 2020-12-03 08:45:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Genuinely though, why isn’t #Neurodiversity an @Twitter topic to follow? 😬🤔  #NeurodiverseSquad #Neurodivergent #Neurodiverse

1334290463927525382 2020-12-03 08:16:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax @LushLtd They got rid of my favourite product about a year ago, that’s sin enough 😂  Jokes aside it is absolute gobshite that they have done this, and frankly lack of research in a company of their stature does not slide as an excuse. Oh on another note, their stores are not ND friendly.
1334289241476657153 2020-12-03 08:11:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @NeuroRebel I need the Durecell bunny and some of those wings red bull have on offer 🤣
1334288803377328131 2020-12-03 08:10:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @NeuroRebel I feel you on that one. We will find a time at some point when we have enough spoons between us ☺️
1334288590675861507 2020-12-03 08:09:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Very chuffed to say that two of my friends, who both happen to be #dyspraxic, made it into my top podcasts of 2020! Definitely check out @DyspraxicHelp4U and @NDNeuroNews/@autisticlyaaron on @spotifypodcasts!   #NeurodiverseSquad #Neurodiversity #Neurodivergent #2020Wrapped #DCD  https://t.co/ase4XpcOOW
1334286729520549888 2020-12-03 08:02:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @NeuroRebel I look forward to when you do. Happy to talk about being a dyspraxic feminist sometime if you are ever looking fir episode ideas ☺️
1334286282864910344 2020-12-03 08:00:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @NeuroRebel Is it on the neuro news podcast?

1334181898441158656 2020-12-03 01:05:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> To those of you who keep putting #dyspraxic women down I refer you to this blog post I wrote, which yes does have sources listed at the end.  https://t.co/VTSC7uqfwp #dyspraxia #DCD #Neurodivergent #Neurodiverse #Neurodiversity #NeurodiverseSquad
1334108907711705088 2020-12-02 20:15:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow Is it possible they had the same/similar thought without realising? I know if accounts are privated you can’t retweet so that could be it too
1334106848446869504 2020-12-02 20:07:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef I agree! Its crazy. Thankfully there are more rational voices like yourself, but the numptys shout louder!

1334078726842277888 2020-12-02 18:15:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef Oh I have no doubt. Because just like with autism there are ways that we mask. It’s also more socially acceptable for a woman to be ditzy or clumsy than it is a man. We often get passes of as cute when we are really struggling. We are more likely than men to get diagnosed late
1334075104196751360 2020-12-02 18:01:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Shirle1967 @ClearAutism It frustrates me. If people are only talking about specific diagnosis they should just mention those diagnosis as it can be very isolating to others for example dyspraxic people.
1334074570161188868 2020-12-02 17:58:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #AccessibleAdvent 2 Write lists, repeat, slow down. If you ask “did you catch that” we often say yes due to social pressure. Follow up later and make sure we are comfortable to ask questions. Be patient with us!
1334072903495786496 2020-12-02 17:52:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @StructuredSucc I mean to be honest, everything 😂
1334072741666951168 2020-12-02 17:51:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Sunflower_Sys It’s where you can never take the right path, you always have to divert 😂
1334070924832804864 2020-12-02 17:44:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scovelljohn Yeah she does!
1334067931840438275 2020-12-02 17:32:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> A thing I love is the feeling of my cat padding me out with her paws before finally settling
1334066587771555840 2020-12-02 17:27:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic You know your a neurodivergent pagan when you have to think for a few seconds because at first you thought they were talking about spirits 😂
1334064995227873280 2020-12-02 17:20:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Shirle1967 @ClearAutism I’m well aware of the difference between neurodiversity, neurodivergent and neurodiverse. But under the context of the original tweet I wanted to know the answer to my questions in relation to what the speaker themself meant rather than the official definitions.
1334064196376465409 2020-12-02 17:17:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 I think some people think it harms the legitimacy of their *official* diagnosis or that it somehow harms their access to support. Both of which are of course gobshite
1333897366626324483 2020-12-02 06:14:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It’s my birthday tomorrow. I always get kinda sad. My grandfather died 2 days before my 12th birthday. On my birthday I received a card in the post that he must have sent the day he died. I still have that card to this day.
1333891986487701504 2020-12-02 05:53:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDucky If you ever need a friendly ear (well eyes really as we technically are reading each other) I’m always a message away 💞
1333888579261640704 2020-12-02 05:39:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I guess you could have different zones kind of like at a festival accept it’s designed to accommodate for specific accessibility needs 🤔
1333887147447816192 2020-12-02 05:34:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ThisIsJordanKay As a Brit I saw the word buttons and thought of chocolate 😂
1333839218502721536 2020-12-02 02:23:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell Oh wow, I didn’t know about that, thats really cool. I know about a lot of world war stuff - used to love the museum on Hoy, and of course the ancient stuff. I even saw some actual digs going on before! But I didn’t know about the MSP!
1333834501097721857 2020-12-02 02:05:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell I love Skarra Brae. I find it funny watching history shows where they pronounce everything wrong 😂
1333833625775845378 2020-12-02 02:01:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell No necessarily an era but I love Orkadian history!
1333833280903385088 2020-12-02 02:00:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado I wish I found it so easy. A lot of dyspraxic women have been receiving aggression on twitter and its become a daily occurrence. When it happens so frequently it’s hard to shut it out.
1333832198290624513 2020-12-02 01:55:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I cried a lot today so now my vision is a bit blurry. But I dropped my glasses down the side of my bed which is difficult to reach. Quite the predicament.
1333831868840636416 2020-12-02 01:54:33 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic The only medicine I ever liked was the banana/vanilla flavour one for tonsillitis and calpol.
1333831380690751488 2020-12-02 01:52:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron If that is the case that is awful. I didn’t fully understand what the ruling meant
1333831114893438979 2020-12-02 01:51:33 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ClearAutism Did they use neurodisability to mean neurodiversity? And if so why were they only including autism and ADHD in their definition?
1333830309138329600 2020-12-02 01:48:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I don’t fully understand what exactly has been ruled today. Are the high court stopping trans teens from being allowed to access puberty blockers? If so this is absolutely aweful. I have tried reading about it but don’t fully understand which is why I’m asking.

1333745181884108804 2020-12-01 20:10:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD Definitely contact @NDPostgrads as they may be able to help you. Also @DyspraxicWomen have a twitter list full of neurodivergent women’s groups. There are a ton of ADHD ones you could link up with! ☺️
1333742294227443712 2020-12-01 19:58:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #AccessibleAdvent 1 - Universally provide #dyspraxia diagnostic pathways for adults on the NHS.
1333733418094518272 2020-12-01 19:23:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD I bumped my head
1333720539563745285 2020-12-01 18:32:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This but also self diagnosed dyspraxics. I know many dyspraxic women who have not been able to access support and some men too.
1333719633657028611 2020-12-01 18:28:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Don’t pressure dyspraxic/dyslexic people to do writing that is not only painful (for the wrist, arm and hand) but will also take about 7 hours to do. Speech functions help us get things across that shorter tweets do not. I usually exclusively use text but I can’t always.
1333714608167809025 2020-12-01 18:08:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @katiephipps @DyspraxicWomen I normally only do text tweets but I am both dyspraxic and dyslexic and needed a quick way to get what I had to say out to express how upsetting the harassment myself and other dyspraxic women have been getting (some of which happened this morning) is.
1333713833546960897 2020-12-01 18:05:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JamesWafer85 You say that be he was spewing stuff about men being the “weaker” sex 🙃
1333709184274194432 2020-12-01 17:47:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Man: Wonen don’t need their own group. Why does this group exist?  Me: There are many reasons. Disability can impact men and women slightly differently. Here’s a men’s group for you if you need support.   Man: I WON’T go to the men’s group.   😑

1333692407033040901 2020-12-01 16:40:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax @4licerose Men can’t handle that disabilities can impact women differently. They can’t handle that disabled women are discriminated against and ignored by a system which is supposed to help them. Like #autism, we need measures in place to better recognise and diagnose #dyspraxic women.
1333690425895493632 2020-12-01 16:32:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose I agree. Funny enough as soon as I replied to you I logged onto the women’s twitter only to find ANOTHER “why do women need their own group” “dyspraxia affects men more” comment. It’s enough to drive a woman up the wall 🙃
1333687757026291712 2020-12-01 16:21:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose It is quite crazy and sadly this kind of thing is only increasing in occurrence! Unless someone is being outright aggressive I just try providing evidence to prove why x is important or true. Sadly simply talking about women’s issues is seen as an attack on men these days!
1333565993797496834 2020-12-01 08:18:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MsKackiV Yes I’m with you on that. I think part of it is we need to see the logic and our brains don’t like wasting space on things that are illogical 😂  https://t.co/T4ZWclaqkx
1333562956366438400 2020-12-01 08:05:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I think it could be that people are maybe doing scrollathons less. Or they may have their feed set to “newest first” rather than “most relevant first”. I did notice that profiles now have bells like on youtube so that could also be it
1333556411322789891 2020-12-01 07:39:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Learning disabilities aren’t the same as learning difficulties. It’s possible to have a learning difficulty &amp; a disability without having a learning disability. #Dyspraxia is a learning difficulty &amp; is also protected under UK law as a disability - it is NOT a learning disability.

1333411498086031360 2020-11-30 22:04:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #NeurodiverseSquad friends, #dyspraxic women could really do with some support right now. See the most recent tweets/retweets on the @DyspraxicWomen account for a small degree of context. We shouldn’t have to continue getting slated and harassed for simply sharing information.
1333406745553756161 2020-11-30 21:45:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The existence of #dyspraxic women does not harm men. The existence of #dyspraxic women does not harm men. The existence of #dyspraxic women does not harm men. The existence of #dyspraxic women does not harm men. The existence of #dyspraxic women does not harm men.  PERIOD.
1333398578421772290 2020-11-30 21:12:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The fact that groups like @DyspraxicWomen and the @DH4UWomen branch of @DyspraxicHelp4U get slated for simply existing, is simply more evidence as to why these groups are needed in the first place. We must #SupportNeurodivergentWomen!  #Dyspraxia #Dyspraxic #NeurodiverseSquad

Regardless of the reason, young dyspraxic women seem to garner a lot of backlash unfairly
1333367132051140608 2020-11-30 19:07:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker @DyspraxicHelp4U @NDNeuroNews @DysSingSongMike Ahh that makes sense. Though I think I personally wouldn’t compare online abuse to real life assualt
1333339552556199942 2020-11-30 17:18:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I have no words. He is admitting to breaking the law because his right to eat lunch with a “large group” is apparently more important than people’s right to literally breathe.
1333338914065682434 2020-11-30 17:15:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @brianmoore666 He’s high key admitting to breaking the law. Apparently his right to eat lunch with “a large group” overrides other people’s right to literally breathe.
1333338028941717504 2020-11-30 17:12:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Holy moly. He does realise every winter when flu is rampant they protect the elderly. When accidents happen due to icy conditions the NHS helps. When people get hypothermia because they can’t afford heating the NHS helps. 0.1% doesn’t sound like much but these lives matter.
1333336707576557572 2020-11-30 17:06:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I usually have to pretend I did stuff just so people don’t jump into the #dyspraxic people are lazy stereotype. Even though in reality my spoons were low and just making breakfast was a triumph. I guess that’s an example of a dyspraxic woman masking 😅
1333336072147914754 2020-11-30 17:04:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ok have you ever had an issue with people speaking FOR you. Not in the Sia kind of way, more like people making promises on your behalf that you aren’t sure you can fulfil?   #NeurodiverseSquad #Neurodiversity #Neurodivergent #Neurodiverse
1333331974409302026 2020-11-30 16:48:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker @DyspraxicHelp4U @NDNeuroNews @DysSingSongMike You make a big assumption about friends. Offline I am a very isolated and lonely person and try as I might the internet is no remedy for that. I struggle with my mental health and have my own battles. I just don’t talk about them much on this platform.
1333331558225358848 2020-11-30 16:46:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker @DyspraxicHelp4U @NDNeuroNews @DysSingSongMike I’m very confused by this statement
1333331146059501569 2020-11-30 16:44:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven @GillLoomesQuinn Oh I 100% agree and it’s the same for dyspraxia as comorbidities are a thing but equally much like ADHD and autism we have the issue of under diagnosis within an already under diagnosed disability. Same with minorities more widely. So that’s an issue we can come together on
1333221747588526082 2020-11-30 09:30:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Thanks @DyspraxicHelp4U 🙏

1333194865098846214 2020-11-30 07:43:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just so you lads know, labradorite is my favourite crystal. It means a lot to me as I use it to symbolise one of the gods I have the deepest connection to. When I need a friend I hold it in my hands and talk to it as if it is the deity themself. @VixenFae93
1333194246871019521 2020-11-30 07:40:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I just want to highlight how infectious the positivity of @EmilyyNics is. She is truly a bringer of joy and an asset to the #dyspraxic community ☺️💞  https://t.co/uPzKFgy19K
1333193650407346178 2020-11-30 07:38:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics 💞
1333193548099891201 2020-11-30 07:38:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty Its alright. I feel a bit better now as neurodiverse squad peeps helped ground me and made me realise that while the pebble may be heavy, it’s are just a drop in the ocean - in other words its the quiet and kind majority like yourself that matter more than a loud mean minority ☺️
1333192878668058625 2020-11-30 07:35:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax He’s hit the nail on the head. I think they forget we are dyspraxic ourselves. We have a right to share our thoughts or experiences of and present information about dyspraxia how we see fit. The irony is when people are making good points but they are so aggressive it gets lost
1333184502252904450 2020-11-30 07:02:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U @DCDFilmmaker @NDNeuroNews @DysSingSongMike Oh yes most of the crap I have dealt with are from people older than me which is a double wammy because you don’t know if they think they can get away with it because you are young or because you are a woman 🙃
1333181015565602816 2020-11-30 06:48:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U @DCDFilmmaker @NDNeuroNews @DysSingSongMike  https://t.co/SYBSXBzs9j
1333177361655795712 2020-11-30 06:33:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @GillLoomesQuinn @AutiLeven 100% agree. I try to share content from varying aspects of neurodiversity, not just dyspraxia &amp; focus on neurodiversity as a whole. But there are some issues specific to dyspraxia that can’t begin to be addressed without awareness, which is why I don’t shut up about dyspraxia 😅
1333173864474537985 2020-11-30 06:19:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven @GillLoomesQuinn I think its amazing how far things have come with autism advocacy and I am of course more than aware that there are many areas that still need tackling. The Sia situation is evidence of that. And I hope to support my autistic friends on the way. I also agree with you re dyspraxia
1333159072359739401 2020-11-30 05:21:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @pop_OTwithDCD Exactly!
1333156912473444355 2020-11-30 05:12:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @pop_OTwithDCD I agree. And don’t get me wrong there are ways to be critical of NHS lack of funding for diagnosis that aren’t problematic. Attacking fellow members of the community, who have no power over such things, is not one of those ways 🙃
1333148466940350465 2020-11-30 04:38:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AsToldByJoanna I mean... I’m dyspraxic and JUST about manage to cut my hair. Slow and steady... and youtube tutorialey 🤣
1333147664628805632 2020-11-30 04:35:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @stuckonchaetzu This is me to a T. Then sometimes spotify reminds me of the artist and I’m back in loop mode again 😂
1333146751801438209 2020-11-30 04:32:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Go send @krystalbellax some love, and while you are at it check out her shop in her bio!
1333146404345286656 2020-11-30 04:30:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @stuckonchaetzu I do it with albums and sometimes artists too. But more often its songs for me
1333145192665407492 2020-11-30 04:25:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> *you but I guess my dyspraxic hands wanted to say it in a french accent 😅
1333145003791687686 2020-11-30 04:25:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ou know the whole neurodivergent thing of listening to the same song on a loop for ages? This... this is my loop song right now  https://t.co/PGIQKPvuse
1333144334124904457 2020-11-30 04:22:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Technically Baby Yoda is older... maybe he adopted Mando in the biggest twist known to man 🤣
1333143631771865088 2020-11-30 04:19:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic It’s great xD

1333127883246751744 2020-11-30 03:17:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I’ll there’s a song called Morrigan by a band called Omnia. And a song called Crow Maiden by Mandi See. Both great songs!
1333127412012490755 2020-11-30 03:15:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics Thanks Emily 💞
1333127270853210116 2020-11-30 03:14:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose @krystalbellax @DyspraxicWomen Absolutely!
1333126875359698947 2020-11-30 03:13:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx Totally with you on that!
1333126647957041153 2020-11-30 03:12:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I know of the Morrigan but have followed more of the Greek pantheon. But there are some songs about Morrigan that I love!
1333108301484224512 2020-11-30 01:59:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx @VixenFae93 I totally feel you on that. Everytime I come across an ND pagan (which is not that often) I get so excited because I think ND pagans just “get it” that feeling we have, but on a deeper level yah know?
1333107890387869700 2020-11-30 01:57:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I feel yah on that!
1333107790898982916 2020-11-30 01:57:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx That is how I felt as soon as I developed my connection to Hades. He truly has been my rock over the years. I’m glad you have that yourself now ☺️
1333104351699755010 2020-11-30 01:43:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx It must‘ve been tough to know about and believe this stuff but be locked away from it. I imagine too because that connection with the gods is so deep in the heart it probably felt a bit like imprisoning them too in a weird way. Though that’s just me making an empathetic guess 😂
1333103769459036161 2020-11-30 01:41:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I’m sure you’ll have many blessings to come. If you ever want to chat about neurodiversity and paganism definitely hit me up anytime 😎
1333103468328980483 2020-11-30 01:40:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx Oh boy if you want to talk spirituality and stimming you definitely need to chat to @VixenFae93 (or dragonfaerose on instagram). She’s an autistic pagan, my friend so of course I love her - also I‘ve had talks with her where we talk about similar things to what you just described
1333102775346073602 2020-11-30 01:37:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx It can be tough when parents are so shut off. My parents were quite open with spiritual exploration but there are other things they were less open with. So while its not quite the same, I can understand how damaging such attitudes can be
1333102412962406412 2020-11-30 01:35:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx You pretty much nailed why my faith was so important to me as a teen and why it still is. And while it may be hard to reflect on a time you didn’t have your faith, I am glad you have that now. And I know that with the gods you aren’t alone, you are loved ☺️
1333101974003339265 2020-11-30 01:34:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx How I talk to athiests re divination (tarot isn’t my personal form of divination) is that even if you don’t believe in the spiritual side, the introspection you get from it can really help untangle any mental knots you have. And bring a sense of confidence in yourself/decisions
1333101321948450819 2020-11-30 01:31:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I can’t say for sure how it would have been. But I know for me, without the gods I don’t know where I’d be now. They inspire me to find my strength even when the weight of life is hard to bare
1333100935552376839 2020-11-30 01:30:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I’m glad things are better for you now. My family are similar to how your dad is now. The worst I had to contend with was baby sacrifice jokes from my brothers 😂
1333100376309030922 2020-11-30 01:27:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @GillLoomesQuinn @AutiLeven I totally agree. Thanks Gill ☺️
1333100224282324992 2020-11-30 01:27:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I got lucky that my parents didn’t really care about religion so I was freely able to explore my own faith. I can’t imagine how stressful it must be not to have that. My faith was my anchor through my teenhood and still is
1333096755626381312 2020-11-30 01:13:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Looking back its obvious I was going to be pagan. I never grew out of faeries. Also I made up my own ‘creation story’ where the universe was an ocean and two whales who were a god and goddess came together and created everything out if love 😂
1333095823996030980 2020-11-30 01:09:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @NDNeuroNews @DCDFilmmaker @DyspraxicHelp4U @DysSingSongMike Thanks Aaron. You’re a good egg 🐣  https://t.co/95lMIAB286
1333094920022859777 2020-11-30 01:06:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker @DyspraxicHelp4U @NDNeuroNews @DysSingSongMike I don’t like to name and shame if I can avoid it as drawing attention to the toxic people only makes me feel worse. I try to reason with people and if that doesn’t work I block them. It still makes me sad when these things happen though.
1333091228645199875 2020-11-30 00:51:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker @DyspraxicHelp4U @NDNeuroNews @DysSingSongMike I second this... but my account is one of the accounts getting abuse 😅
1333086403715084291 2020-11-30 00:32:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @GillLoomesQuinn @AutiLeven Thanks Gill. I agree with you wholeheartedly on this. But it can be difficult sometimes when you aren’t in the best headspace yourself. I’m certainly not giving up anytime soon, but the increase in negative backlash certainly has made it tricky to say the least
1333069425117827072 2020-11-29 23:24:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax @4licerose It’s NEVER ok. The more it happens the harder it is. Though I think since groups like @DyspraxicWomen have launched in many ways it has also strengthened the community. Because we now stand together as a group and don’t tolerate the toxicity. Sometimes not being alone is the key.
1333058347730427905 2020-11-29 22:40:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Luciek11K Thank you Lucie 🙏
1333058170986655744 2020-11-29 22:40:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r Thanks Rosemary. My mum has the same phrase but she says buggers instead of bastards 😂
1333039850627411971 2020-11-29 21:27:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I have a #dyspraxic joke but I can’t remember it
1333035911970492418 2020-11-29 21:11:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Eciläeolhc
1333023411321311233 2020-11-29 20:22:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose I have been tempted to do a blog breaking my silence on the toxic side to the community... but right now I fear it would open up a bigger can of worms than I’m ready for 😬
1333021735038443525 2020-11-29 20:15:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose I do find it, interesting, that those of us who seem to experience this the most are dyspraxic women... but that is a whole other conversation entirely!
1333018811419799552 2020-11-29 20:03:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I have been getting crap over my dyspraxia stuff recently. I am far from the only one in the #dyspraxia community that deals with conflict from other #dyspraxic people. If you have an issue, make content &amp; raise awareness yourself. Stop attacking people like @krystalbellax &amp; I.
1333012496572182528 2020-11-29 19:38:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I love this picture. One fun thing I do when I go on walks is actively look for mushrooms/fungi like this. Of course I take a snap when I find them!
1333008236736356357 2020-11-29 19:21:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer @AutiLeven You summed up one of the biggest reasons I started this account in the first place. Most of the time I’m ok but sometimes the negative nellies are louder than the nice nellies 😂
1333004934929911808 2020-11-29 19:08:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer @AutiLeven No clue. But it’s as if they want the blog taken down and for people to stop talking about dyspraxia altogether. Sadly I think people like this individual put people off from talking about dyspraxia or engaging with the dyspraxic community. Which only harms the cause.
1333003376972468225 2020-11-29 19:02:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer @AutiLeven Just did. Funny thing is if they weren’t so rude or aggressive I actually agree with and have even experienced a lot of what they were saying. But there really are ways to go about things and this person was just rude and aggressive.
1333001579226685446 2020-11-29 18:55:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @miche2my I’d wager probably around a third of them give it take
1333000370465943552 2020-11-29 18:50:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHFemale Thank you. And this was me coming back. I’m just disheartened because there has been a lot of toxicity in the dyspraxic community this year. And the first time I post again after a bad bout of depression I end up on the receiving end of aggression from a fellow dyspraxic 😕
1332998388107894784 2020-11-29 18:42:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I am pretty sure some England based neurodivergent &amp; disabled SENDCo’s/SEND specialists follow me. This could be an interesting volunteer opportunity for you!
1332997325820743683 2020-11-29 18:38:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @miche2my I agree if head teachers don’t take things seriously it’s an issue. My mum tried getting me help in school but was always dismissed. My brothers, who struggled less than me, were given help without question - so I’m a living example of the gender issue in neurodiversity 😂
1332996836123176960 2020-11-29 18:36:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Thanks Alice. I do try to ignore this kind of thing but at the time I’d only just posted it and the only thing I heard was f this and f that. I get that the lack of NHS funding is an issue, but if that was the ONLY thing I talk about I wouldn’t be helping anyone and would bore
1332988885111074816 2020-11-29 18:04:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @miche2my Oh totally. I’m wanting to become a teacher though and I want to do thinks like campaign so no kid with additional needs (there are many reasons a kid may have additional needs) doesn’t miss out
1332988553182187521 2020-11-29 18:03:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer @AutiLeven I do have an email address but sadly the stuff I am getting at the moment is on twitter 😔
1332988251032973314 2020-11-29 18:02:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Thanks Alice. I hadn’t been feeling good for a while but decided to help people by sharing support available - most of which is FREE. It’s support I didn’t get because it didn’t exist and I didn’t know about at the time. I thought it might help, all I got was aggression😔
1332986995140943872 2020-11-29 17:57:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @miche2my Thank you Miche, I appreciate it ☺️
1332986879352967168 2020-11-29 17:56:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @miche2my Yes that’s amazing! Stuff I wish I had in school. I had it in uni, but I do think my grades may have been better younger. I’m glad future kids get that support though ☺️
1332986562947244032 2020-11-29 17:55:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ianyoung33 Thank you Ian for being so kind, I appreciate it 😭🙏
1332986345820708864 2020-11-29 17:54:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas If these things TRULY make you angry. Write to MP’s, start petitions or campaigns, contact the dyspraxia APPG, organisations, charities, the disability union. But don’t spew your anger at an emotionally wobbly young woman for trying to help others with support she never got.
1332985801471307776 2020-11-29 17:52:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas You’re talking about things I know all too well. I’m struggling to find mental health support myself &amp; have spent the past months wishing I was dead. Complaining at me and swearing won’t change your situation. You are misplacing anger at a depressed, unemployed young woman.
1332984345682976768 2020-11-29 17:46:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer @AutiLeven It’s not even about mental health. It’s more the fact that the first time I create proper dyspraxia content after a bad patch with depression - I get riddled with complaints. It’s like people think I am an organisation and not a human being 😔
1332983864399196162 2020-11-29 17:44:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven Oh no don’t get me wrong I totally agree. But I think there are so many people advocating for autism and not for dyspraxia, so if one dyspraxic person drops their game the impact can be quite big as there are so few of us doing it anyway. Hope that makes sense
1332870675934154757 2020-11-29 10:15:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @eliasyassin_ Thank you Elias, I needed to hear this 😭🙏💞
1332870380780974080 2020-11-29 10:13:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven I can relate. Theres been lots of toxicity in the dyspraxic community that hasn’t helped. I’ve been close to quitting too many times to count. But the issue is, if you mention autism to a GP they have heard of it. Different story with dyspraxia so I feel like I HAVE to carry on😕
1332867418323116033 2020-11-29 10:02:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven Thank you. I’m sad over this. I‘m one woman with no income - I can’t change things alone. I push for awareness &amp; have helped professionals learn what dyspraxia is, helped other ND people learn about it &amp; helped people find out they are dyspraxic. That’s must count for something😔
1332865139574534144 2020-11-29 09:53:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> In tears right now. I felt good, like I was helping people. But only got complaints over things out of my control. I am well aware of the lack of NHS funding for #dyspraxia which is why I push for awareness. Making an unemployed young woman cry won’t change the NHS funding issue.
1332863877223247873 2020-11-29 09:48:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas You do realise I only got diagnosed at uni after years of suffering and mental turmoil. I cannot magic up NHS funding. I can push for awareness in the hope that the NHS does take dyspraxia seriously. And I can share what is available for those who are diagnosed. I’m only human.
1332863040241405953 2020-11-29 09:44:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> When you put your heart &amp; soul into #DyspraxiaAwareness and write your first blog after a bad bout of depression only to get met with rudeness. I’m feeling very heartbroken and crushed. Things like this make it very hard to get motivated to write about #dyspraxia/being #dyspraxic
1332862166161100800 2020-11-29 09:41:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas Thanks for the vote of confidence mate. Here’s the blog anyway. It took me a long time and I did it to help myself and others in what has been a particularly hard year.  https://t.co/US0wqPJ9Ki
1332858951814311936 2020-11-29 09:28:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas Excuse me?
1332847848166141952 2020-11-29 08:44:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics @scovelljohn I always include free resources in my blog. I only include paid resources if it is genuinely helpful, such as the disability union. But I try to only include free resources as I think its awful that disabled people such as ourselves bare the cost for something out of our control.

1332805634862014465 2020-11-29 05:56:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> In the process of writing a blog on what options are available for #dyspraxic people (in the UK) post-diagnosis. As it was bought to my attention that I have posts on what #dyspraxia is and what to do if you think you may be dyspraxic. But I don’t yet have a post-diagnosis post.
1332803459066826752 2020-11-29 05:48:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell @chloegray6 do you know anyone who might be interested?

1332743607288287236 2020-11-29 01:50:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Oh wow, mere days before my birthday I have reached 1000 followers. Thank you so much everyone for giving this #dyspraxic woman a voice. Awareness is so poor but I feel I have made friends and allies on here that have helped me reach this milestone &amp; push for awareness. 1/4  https://t.co/PaX0SS6hKK
1332722077170872322 2020-11-29 00:24:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It is a travesty that this has happened. The sunflower lanyard is vital for many, particularly people with hidden disabilities. Do not misuse them. You are causing great harm or distress to people if you do. The fact an actual doctor wouldn’t listen to @krystalbellax is awful!
1332679226802266114 2020-11-28 21:34:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I learnt about some from EH and NT websites too. But as I’m pagan I’m a tad obsessed with ancient sites too. My dad is also obsessed with Roman history as he studied it at uni so I grew up learning about that kind of thing ☺️
1332677991504207873 2020-11-28 21:29:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I love visiting Roman sites! Well any ancient site really but Roman ones are super cool!
1332660769960456192 2020-11-28 20:21:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As soon as you hear Come On Aileen, that song ain’t leaving your brain for weeks 😂
1332634978891476993 2020-11-28 18:38:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @sadeokayla Yes I agree. I think the battle word stood out to me more than the sentence because being dyslexic snap words catch my attention more. But on reflection I can definitely see your point on that part of the article!
1332633111390265344 2020-11-28 18:31:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @sadeokayla I agree which is why I said the article was ok just the language in that one very small part was frustrating. I wanted to share the article but didn’t feel comfortable doing so without explaining why the use of language was frustrating
1332622302241034242 2020-11-28 17:48:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @sleepygrlo_o @VixenFae93 has her art store on etsy!
1332621336607330306 2020-11-28 17:44:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This article is ok, though the language around #dyspraxia is frustrating. Saying we “battle” with dyspraxia implies its a bad thing, something we need to overcome or cure. Dyspraxia brings difficulties but it has its positives. I wouldn’t be me if I wasn’t #dyspraxic.
1332394470583791627 2020-11-28 02:42:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r Agreed. I noticed she replied to a tweet that a UK based autism charity made so I’d be curious to see if they respond to her response and if so how she handles that. So far she just keeps repeating the “it wasn’t my intention” schpiel 🙃
1332367056067563520 2020-11-28 00:53:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I want to see a musical where all the songs are written by Depeche Mode specifically for it
1332342846981070849 2020-11-27 23:17:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It makes me sad that when we hear the word amazon we no longer think of rainforests. Instead we think of a not so great big businesses. I remember learning about the amazon rainforest as a kid - today’s kids will think of shopping when that comes up in class.
1332313742521085952 2020-11-27 21:22:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Any Irish #dyspraxic people out there? @krystalbellax  is looking for participants for her livestream. Reply to her tweet if you are interested!  @DyspraxicIRE @dyspraxiaIRL
1332310682214273024 2020-11-27 21:09:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @reesytime Same. I never can figure out when black friday actually is!
1332281604333572096 2020-11-27 19:14:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer @ItsEmilyKaty This looks different to the video, I can’t figure out how you did it.   40% of 20 = 8 I can get because its as easy as 4 x 2.   But I can’t figure out in my head how you got the numbers you did/why. Oh wait I just realised you divide the big numbers by 10 then times them together
1332275794870235136 2020-11-27 18:51:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I wonder if this works for all numbers or just multiples of 10 🤔
1332272949919932418 2020-11-27 18:39:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Saraheboon I think financial cost can differ vastly. But if someone is late diagnosed the chances are they had unequal opportunities in education and this in turn would lead to unequal employment/career opportunities. It’s hard to calculate the cost there, but it’d be a life changing one.
1332267823960387584 2020-11-27 18:19:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Saraheboon Do #dyspraxic, #dyslexic, #dyscalculia, #TouretteSyndrome and others count as #NeurodiverseSquad? (Rhetorical question because people keep forgetting us)   My REAL question is do you mean financial cost or emotional/mental/physical cost?
1332264592752463878 2020-11-27 18:06:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 That looks delicious
1332263817603141633 2020-11-27 18:03:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m that level of #dyspraxic where tidy is only a thing so I don’t have to worry about fire safety with the radiator. And tidy is an overstatement 😂
1332238102727958528 2020-11-27 16:21:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD I can’t practically do anything and I know it can be hard to do, but I recommend you contact PALS (NHS patient liaison and advice service). They can either help get to the bottom of it or help you make a complaint if you can’t sort what’s going on. Hope this is a helpful tip
1332082984866996224 2020-11-27 06:05:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U Don’t forget to retweet the original tweet too. They are looking for resources as they are researching dyspraxia ☺️

1331932532472995846 2020-11-26 20:07:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax @kayleighm5297 I’d been natural for ages after dying my hair for years but I’m sick of being a boaring dull drab person. I need a big change. Something to bring back some thrill in my life. Sadly this attempt both failed and wasted money.
1331929515669516290 2020-11-26 19:55:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So it slightly lightened my hair but not by a lot. My hair stayed basically the same 😂
1331904561154387968 2020-11-26 18:16:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you can’t change your life... change your hair colour? 😅  Let’s see if this pink dye looks great or turns into a young dumb moment 🙈😬😂
1331904273366589440 2020-11-26 18:14:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @marvelousmollie Thanks Rosie 💞
1331880381281423360 2020-11-26 16:40:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #NeurodiverseSquad am I the only person who finds it awkward when someone says “send our love to” I never know tow to say it to the person in question. Its easy to say “blah called” but saying “blah sends their love” the conversation structure just confused me
1331874792228741120 2020-11-26 16:17:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Thanks Alice 💞
1331764623712915456 2020-11-26 09:00:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @reesytime You had me at Tom Baker
1331753898089074688 2020-11-26 08:17:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas I won’t go to my practice. There are ones in other towns near me but I’m not in their area. But I’ll keep digging. I just cannot go back to my local one.
1331752078197338115 2020-11-26 08:10:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas I’m not registered with my local practice. Thats why I am asking people if they know online ones. I refuse to go back to my local GP who have treated me like crap over the years.
1331747711322902528 2020-11-26 07:52:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Can youtube stop dropping “Coach Redpill” in my suggestions please? Really don’t need to see the king of misodgeny while I’m trying to relax.
1331740339292545024 2020-11-26 07:23:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas I was offered it before and resisted myself. But at this point I’m desperate.
1331728837894352896 2020-11-26 06:37:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas I had talking therapy on the NHS but they capped the number of sessions you could have and I don’t want to go through it again if I know I’ll just get dropped as I’ll end up worse for it. If I can find a good doctor I think it’s time for medication.
1331728409341403137 2020-11-26 06:36:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef @MindsmatterNHS I’m actually in Devon now that I’m not at uni anymore which has a lot less support than Kent presumably because we are further away from London/more rural
1331728105505951745 2020-11-26 06:34:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef @MindsmatterNHS I didn’t know this place existed until just now so I’ll definitely be looking into it. I’ve had NHS talking therapy before but the sessions were capped so I ended up left in the lurch again which just made me even worse than before. But I’ll take a look. Thanks 🙏
1331727667801055232 2020-11-26 06:33:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer Thank you James. I appreciate it 😭💞
1331727435960885250 2020-11-26 06:32:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef I can empathise. I debated putting this tweet out tbh but I figured maybe someone else feels the same. If I can’t get help maybe at least I’m not alone in it (though a bit of help wouldn’t go amiss 😬😅)
1331727004908068864 2020-11-26 06:30:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver Thank you 🙏
1331726942601670662 2020-11-26 06:30:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef I’ve tried talking to doctors about it before but they don’t take me seriously, underplay things or do the “everyone thinks that sometimes” thing. And since coming home from uni I haven’t registered with my local GP because when I last saw him he gave me a panic attack
1331719031645229057 2020-11-26 05:58:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Does anybody know any NHS GP’s that are completely online? I really don’t want to register with my local one as they have treated me awfully in the past. But I really bloody need help. I’m not coping and if I can’t get proper help I fear I could spiral.
1331713873708199936 2020-11-26 05:38:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD I think perhaps a lot of us ND people accidentally on purpose block things out, especially if we are late diagnosed. Because our childhood years are often too emotionally traumatic to bare
1331713243602182145 2020-11-26 05:35:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @R_RSantamaria I shield from my family too because one family in particular, they try to understand but they just don’t. And it’s too difficult to open up to the rest of the family without opening up to this one person
1331711730699919370 2020-11-26 05:29:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @R_RSantamaria I had some of those thoughts younger but not all. And the thoughts didn’t go round my head on a loop like they did when I turned 14. I just can’t get them to stop and doctors don’t take me seriously. Just like you, I knew I was different but never knew why and it hit hard
1331711036181909504 2020-11-26 05:27:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDucky The personal is political.  https://t.co/GO25QTkSX7
1331709717396205570 2020-11-26 05:21:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDucky Someone got annoyed at me because my posts are “too political” and apparently I’m “no friend to the cause” the cause being dyspraxia...
1331708701615542281 2020-11-26 05:17:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If I could have a drink every time the following phrases came into my head I’d permanently be drunk (these have circled my head daily since age 14)👇  I hate myself   I ruin everything   Nobody likes me  I don’t deserve to be here  I’m ugly  I’m stupid  I deserve to die
1331684754547236867 2020-11-26 03:42:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef I didn’t think you were argumentative at all. If anything I was clarifying so people know I was agreeing with you. I wanted to make it clear why I only mentioned a specific form of abuse in this instance. Don’t worry you are all good ☺️
1331681304748888068 2020-11-26 03:28:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apparently because I’m #dyspraxic I’m not allowed to talk about or have an opinion on anything accept #dyspraxia 🙃  #NeurodiverseSquad #neurodiversity #neurodivergent #neurodiverse #DCD #DiscoveringDyspraxia #DyspraxiaAwareness
1331675337365786625 2020-11-26 03:05:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef Oh yeah abuse to anyone full stop but right now I’m specifically thinking of something I saw from one of my followers in relation to Megan Markle
1331671486000730115 2020-11-26 02:49:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JordanDowling @Angelolz87 @PaisleyThomson They blocked me so I actually can’t see what they are saying. Probably a good job I can’t see really 😂
1331665804497129473 2020-11-26 02:27:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Angelolz87 @PaisleyThomson It’s down to the individual how they choose to discuss their miscarriage. Weather or not you agree with her is beside the point. No person deserves abuse because they had or spoke about their miscarriage. They are grieving - let them be.
1331664537339236352 2020-11-26 02:22:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you are anti lockdown or think it’s ok to send abuse to a woman who had a miscarriage - you can unfollow me.
1331663349092900865 2020-11-26 02:17:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JordanDowling @Angelolz87 @PaisleyThomson They have replied to another tweet thread I’m on about lockdown (they seem to be anti lockdown while myself and the original tweeter are pro lockdown) so perhaps they somehow accidentally replied to my retweet of this Megan tweet by accident. Either way I disagree with them 🤷‍♀️
1331662714339528708 2020-11-26 02:15:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JordanDowling @Angelolz87 @PaisleyThomson I wondered the same thing Jordan seems totally random and I can’t see the link at all.
1331661703180902400 2020-11-26 02:11:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Angelolz87 @PaisleyThomson What does this have to do with Megan Markle’s miscarriage?
1331661379619708929 2020-11-26 02:09:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 @Angelolz87 What do you think are lies Angel? People are dying there is no denying that. And until we have a vaccine available, remaining in lockdown is the best way to prevent deaths. It’s not political to want people not to die.
1331659708797771777 2020-11-26 02:03:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Angelolz87 @PaisleyThomson What do you mean by this?
1331659530900557832 2020-11-26 02:02:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 It really is. This letter is an obvious publicity stunt to appeal to a very specific proportion of the population. I think if I was a parent I’d say that Santa is social distancing and asked mummy and daddy to help this year instead
1331658897132826626 2020-11-26 01:59:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 But... random kid wrote a letter... Borris had officially confirmed to this one kid that Santa is coming 🙃  In case it wasn’t clear, that was sarcasm. Lockdown needs to continue if we want our loved ones to stay alive this Christmas.
1331655069029294080 2020-11-26 01:44:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @IanYoungBEIS I saw it live too but can’t remember who acted in it sadly!
1331652662694207488 2020-11-26 01:35:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron I used to use Snapchat as a teen but I did it to fit in with other people as at the time I didn’t know I was neurodivergent and just wanted some friends
1331651377991479301 2020-11-26 01:30:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I totally forgot to add On A Clear Day You Can See Forever with Barbra Streisand

1331648067012079618 2020-11-26 01:16:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic The worst bullying I received was from other women. It was the guys which often told them to stop when they went too far. There were some guys that bullied me too but this was far less often
1331647127798345729 2020-11-26 01:13:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ok but for real does anyone even use Snapchat anymore?
1331646461612863490 2020-11-26 01:10:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I have mixed feelings on this because there are kids who may have unstable lives at home who this system would benefit. Equally though it will be easier for kids with stable home lives to be able to come in. Perhaps refocusing to do things like kindness awards may be better 🤔
1331643521917460481 2020-11-26 00:58:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDelaide I think this is what I’d call the 2020 effect  https://t.co/sOXe7pY6r8
1331596366376804353 2020-11-25 21:51:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I enjoy healthy discussion and polite clarification but call out culture really upsets me. I think if someone is genuinely being problematic that needs to be bought to light, but I’ve noticed people getting called out over simple miscommunication. This brings me great anxiety.
1331593714570055681 2020-11-25 21:40:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This person means well with their question but #NeurodiverseSquad do you see why I do what I do now? To be #neurodivergent is not exclusive to #autism. To be a successful advocate in relation to #neurodiversity, people need to be aware of that fact.
1331580068414558209 2020-11-25 20:46:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Do you have a link to the original thread so I can read the context properly?
1331579753170604034 2020-11-25 20:45:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Which is why an autistic person, dyspraxic person etc is neurodivergent.  The terms neurodiversity, neurodiverse and neurodivergent are related but not the same.  2/2
1331579409233539072 2020-11-25 20:44:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax As far as I am aware to be neurodiverse refers to a group. If you work in an office it is neurodiverse as their are a variety of minds from different experiences and backgrounds. To be neurodivergent however is a different kettle of fish. An individual is neurodivergent 1/2
1331561012080898049 2020-11-25 19:30:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AspieHuman You are honest, kind, loyal and always the first to make sure people are ok when they are sad. You also generally have much better senses of humor than neurotypical people in my opinion
1331551578189410306 2020-11-25 18:53:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I still can’t believe potatoes and tomatoes are in the same family
1331551169215418369 2020-11-25 18:51:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Sadly I kind of have to put my dyspraxia stuff down as it fills in my employment gap. But research has proven I’m less likely to get hired if I disclose. But I have to coz employment gap. But yeah 🤷‍♀️
1331529053430571011 2020-11-25 17:23:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m sick of people talking over or on behalf of people like me, who have binge eating disorder. Take us seriously and support us in recovery. Don’t call us fatphobic for trying to/wanting to recover from an eating disorder.   2/2
1331529051316555776 2020-11-25 17:23:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It annoys me when people talk about fatphobia on the internet because a lot of what people talk about isn’t actually fatphobia and enables an eating disorder which could kill me if I don’t get it under control. Fatphobia may be a thing but it’s not what people think.   1/2
1331526990030135299 2020-11-25 17:15:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ChallengingPod @DH4UWomen Curiosity killed the cat so I just had a nosey. It’s on this post  https://t.co/AI7ndD01US
1331526353624195072 2020-11-25 17:13:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ChallengingPod @DH4UWomen Again I don’t really know as I have never seen her Instagram but I know loads of dyspraxic people shared it when it happened. I don’t really keep up with reality TV unless it’s strictly or Eurovision 😂
1331525862290829313 2020-11-25 17:11:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ChallengingPod @DH4UWomen @DyspraxicHelp4U Oh totally! Yes I normally tweet for the women’s account but I think Billy tweeted on my behalf there. Genuinely annoyed I tagged the wrong account because I wanted to direct you to him as he knows more on it than me. When I type in dyspraxic help 4 u about 5 accounts come up 😂
1331524203602964480 2020-11-25 17:04:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ChallengingPod @DH4UWomen Flip I accidentally tagged the wrong DH4U account I could have sworn I tagged @DyspraxicHelp4U
1331523436682809344 2020-11-25 17:01:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ChallengingPod She mentioned it in the description of one of her Instagram posts. I don’t know which one but @DH4UWomen can point you in the right direction
1331518147145428992 2020-11-25 16:40:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LisaCockburn7 No worries at all, hope it helps ☺️
1331356560728141830 2020-11-25 05:58:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LisaCockburn7 Oh I see. Perhaps if they can send you meeting agendas at least 24 hours in advance or maybe accept follow up emails for days where you are unable to communicate/process on the spot 🤔
1331353513113378818 2020-11-25 05:46:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic This is how I felt when I “met” a bunch of dyspraxic friends
1331335671840182272 2020-11-25 04:35:33 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty Hopefully a teacher as I want to help support neurodivergent kids ☺️  I would have started training this year but it didn’t feel right with covid going on
1331333578718900226 2020-11-25 04:27:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty Genuinely I’d move out, support myself during further study, hopefully find a job and put the rest into an account for my future kids

My friend is struggling with your website &amp; your contact options are inaccessible. It’d be great if you could implement some policies to help neurodivergent people better access your online services.
1331252115524755456 2020-11-24 23:03:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LisaCockburn7 This is something I personally have difficulty with myself but in the UK there is something you can apply for called access to work who can help get you reasonable adjustments in the work place which can help alleviate things like what you are describing
1331209481682870272 2020-11-24 20:14:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @R_J_Chapman For me the label itself is freeing because it helped me understand myself and my place/relation to society in a way I never could before. Finding out that I am neurodivergent meant I could stop hiding parts of myself or playing a role I didn’t fit. It was freeing.
1331199683025317894 2020-11-24 19:35:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @agvbergin @dyspraxicchef I’d add to this thread that @DyspraxicHelp4U runs an amazing podcast too where he interviews different dyspraxic people ☺️
1331199385204617217 2020-11-24 19:34:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Thank you @agvbergin for quoting my tweet and for sharing some #dyspraxic &amp; #dyspraxia blogs in your thread. This is AMAZING! 💕  PS check out the blogs in Ann’s thread ☺️
1331187476086616067 2020-11-24 18:46:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ballinskelligs2 I totally agree Siobhan
1331163883982245888 2020-11-24 17:12:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If I am honest what @NDPractitioner described is one of the reasons I haven’t sought diagnosis. I don’t trust GP’s anyway after a bad experience so wouldn’t ask anyway. But if I did trust them, and got an assessment, as a woman I’d be told no. The process would be too much for me
1331159577019166720 2020-11-24 16:55:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl @kayleighm5297 I don’t think she’s commenting on people’s personal choice to use them. Rather, she is commenting on the fact that even in 2020 many women are made to feel embarrassed by their periods. It may have been good for a teen on her first period for instance to see periods destigmatised
1331150589070368768 2020-11-24 16:20:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Can’t wait for everyone to be complaining because our government are stupid &amp; are ending lockdown on my birthday 🙃  To clarify I think that lockdown should be extended, but it’s not - that’s going to be depressing. My birthday will be the day the government chose Xmas over lives
1331032756864872449 2020-11-24 08:31:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @pigletish There is an etsy store called vesper moth who makes amazing jewellery. I got one of her pieces for christmas last year and it is my favourite necklace of all time. Its a handmade clay raven skull on a metal chain with metal pentacles ☺️

1330989004653793280 2020-11-24 05:38:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @nickyot4kidsdcd Sometimes the reviews are fake. Though I’ve left reviews on some unexpectedly good products in the hopes it’d help others. For instance the plus size wellies I got so I can still exercise in winter/wet weather.
1330986508891860997 2020-11-24 05:28:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @nickyot4kidsdcd My worry on amazon is the cheaper ones have the exact same picture as the more expensive ones and with things I bought in the past that usually means they are copy products (break easy, don’t fit etc). I have looked on amazon but am cautious
1330984514185818117 2020-11-24 05:20:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autcareandshare Sadly I don’t have one local to me but if they have an online store I might look there ☺️
1330984029592702976 2020-11-24 05:18:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @nickyot4kidsdcd Ohh thanks for the heads up I’ll look there now I know!
1330983941780746240 2020-11-24 05:17:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 Being dyspraxic I’m not sure I’d manage to make a cat proof blanket (I have a cat that likes to scratch EVERYTHING) 😅
1330983701329612808 2020-11-24 05:16:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @nickyot4kidsdcd Out of curiosity why wouldn’t you order atm? I’m really struggling and am looking for something that will calm me down and this seems like the best option for me right now
1330983699073150977 2020-11-24 05:16:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autcareandshare Ohh I’ll take a peak as I’ve been struggling to find anything less than £40 right now! Thanks
1330982785205604359 2020-11-24 05:13:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @nickyot4kidsdcd I didn’t know you could get new stuff on eBay. I thought it was all secondhand 😅
1330981712856289282 2020-11-24 05:09:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @nickyot4kidsdcd I’m squeamish of secondhand clothes, blankets etc. Especially during covid
1330981533394604033 2020-11-24 05:08:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MemphisMidnight @Beautidivergen2 £49 is a small fortune for me as I am out of work at the moment. Also I’m my eyes anything above £30 is too expensive for any blanket 😂
1330979058335756292 2020-11-24 04:58:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 We don’t have Walmart in the UK sadly and are also in lockdown. All the ones online cost a small fortune 😬
1330976993182167041 2020-11-24 04:50:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apparently weighted blankets are expensive so I guess I won’t be getting one any time soon
1330942144065007619 2020-11-24 02:31:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I saw Tom Baker trending and got scared. Thankfully nothing bad as he is and always will be the best incarnation of the doctor.  https://t.co/oXJNWFd1TF

1330911957805887492 2020-11-24 00:31:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AllPastoral That’s totally fine ☺️
1330911398793273346 2020-11-24 00:29:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AllPastoral I have this blog which has a bit more detail for people seeking diagnosis  https://t.co/87bx24HpMm
1330911283655434242 2020-11-24 00:29:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @evie_mccoy @AllPastoral It depends on which uni you go to tbh but a lot of them do charge
1330910801251667971 2020-11-24 00:27:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AllPastoral You will need to explain why this is linked to dyspraxia and ask if the university can arrange an assessment. It does cost money but depending on your financial background they subsidise or give grants so you get a free or reduced rate 2/2
1330910487832383489 2020-11-24 00:26:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AllPastoral If they are at university it is still difficult to get diagnosed but it’s much easier to get assessed in education than not. The first port of call is contacting the universities learning or disability support department explaining what they find difficult 1/2
1330909144753319937 2020-11-24 00:20:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AllPastoral Well first of all are you in or out of university? Your options differ vastly depending on if you are or not
1330906260082974721 2020-11-24 00:09:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It may seem like I nag to the rest of the #NeurodiverseSquad. But when #dyspraxic people say awareness is important, and when we prioritise this over the ins and outs of educating people on what #dyspraxia is, there is a reason. We are struggling and need all of your help.   7/7
1330906256324878337 2020-11-24 00:09:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Knowing this, you should know there are people out there who are likely having difficulty finding or maintaining work, or who are struggling mentally and emotionally. They either don’t know they are #dyspraxic, can’t access diagnosis or can’t access support and adjustments.  6/7
1330906253149806597 2020-11-24 00:09:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Due to the lack of awareness toward #dyspraxia many get missed, this especially impacts women and minorities. IF we get diagnosed it is often in adulthood. Many go without as the NHS doesn’t cover diagnosis and to do so privately is expensive.   5/7
1330906251216236547 2020-11-24 00:09:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It also means professionals such as doctors, educators or employers take us less seriously or don’t even believe we are #dyspraxic - that’s if they have even heard of #dyspraxia. This means for many, even with a diagnosis they can’t access support or reasonable adjustments.  4/7
1330906248838045704 2020-11-24 00:09:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Mixing #dyspraxia up with other diagnosis or brushing it off as a symptom of something else is harmful. It makes it less likely for #dyspraxic people to be recognised or diagnosed and makes it harder to access the little support that is there.   3/7
1330906246824812544 2020-11-24 00:09:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #Dyspraxia and #dyslexia are not the same thing.  Dyspraxia is a diagnosis, a disability in its own right. It is not a symptom of #autism.  Some people are #dyspraxic AND #autistic. But, not all autistic people are dyspraxic and not all dyspraxic people are autistic.  2/7
1330906243028946948 2020-11-24 00:09:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’ve had people ask for more threads on #dyspraxia. I have written some blogs on it so don’t always have the spoons to repeat things I have already said. But here are some things that as a #dyspraxic person I’d like you to know 👇  1/7
1330900849154011137 2020-11-23 23:47:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @1Queen_Di Thanks Dianna!   I’ll add that you do get people who are both autistic and dyspraxic. But not all autistic people are dyspraxic and not all dyspraxic people are autistic. Hope that makes sense ☺️
1330899962201247746 2020-11-23 23:44:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I think if it wasn’t cloudy it’d look a bit lighter. But a combination of the seasonal bad weather plus it getting closer to winter the daylight is getting shorter. I don’t mind shorter days though as the light doesn’t wake me up at 4 in the morning like summer 😂
1330878780320190470 2020-11-23 22:20:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @1Queen_Di I should clarify that dyspraxia is a separate diagnosis to autism as this is something a lot of people mix up.   But yeah it’s shocking symptoms can be so obvious but they don’t get recognised!
1330823167376564226 2020-11-23 18:39:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mj_symonds Thanks for clarifying! I have a big suspicion that one reason dyspraxia is so difficult to get diagnosed on the NHS is that professionals keep reducing it to just a symptom of autism. They mention it to the ASD diagnosis receiver but don’t do their due diligence by referring on
1330822199922618368 2020-11-23 18:35:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax @TheKafkaEffect @WalkerWitch94 @QueerlyAutistic Krystal is right that many are missed for this reason, but its not the only reason. I could probably write an entire blog on why people don’t know about dyspraxia. But a big reason is that this legitimate disability keeps getting brushed off as just a symptom of ASD.
1330820849830682625 2020-11-23 18:29:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mj_symonds To clarify, were you told you were dyspraxic/dyslexic at age 14 when receiving an ASD diagnosis? I want to get the clarification as I have 2 different responses depending on context xD
1330818273273929731 2020-11-23 18:19:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RTWBarefoot Nope but was proper gutted as I was super hungry at the time 😂
1330817898881888257 2020-11-23 18:18:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Thats the issue I have. Dyspraxia is a diagnosis in its own right, yet rather than give that diagnosis or refer people to get the diagnosis, professionals keep mentioning it as an aside when diagnosing ASD. I have heard of this happening numerous times sadly.
1330817156729233409 2020-11-23 18:15:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This is why most of the dyspraxic community accept self diagnosis. There are many barriers to getting a diagnosis but until people know the word dyspraxia and what it is, we can’t begin to change that.
1330812721835761664 2020-11-23 17:57:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RTWBarefoot The burn was pretty bad and needed to be properly dressed which is why I ended up in casualty. It was only the minor injury’s unit though so nothing serious!  https://t.co/yK9C9YkcaB
1330809390778241025 2020-11-23 17:44:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RTWBarefoot Crikey that sounds painful!
1330792358879899649 2020-11-23 16:36:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Agreed though I personally prefer the term difficulty or disability as dyspraxia is both a learning difficulty and a hidden disability. Challenge implies it’s something we can overcome or that it’s something we need to get rid of. Though I agree, just clarifying my preference.
1330670085493682176 2020-11-23 08:30:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Read the thread for details. If you can donate to help @Beautidivergen2 cover medical costs for her dog please do. If you are unable to donate, retweeting may help this reach someone who can. Help our #neurodivergent friend in her time of need!
1330668890007932929 2020-11-23 08:26:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As a hellenic polytheist myself I am telling you guys, read it once, twice, three times. No religion is more valid than the other - respect our faith.
1330668016426770437 2020-11-23 08:22:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DisabledStem @DUnionUK Ok definitely take a look at your actual student union as they may have a designated disability officer, who usually is a disabled student themself. Failing this you should 100% contact @DUnionUK as this is exactly the kind of thing they could advise you on. I hope this helps!
1330667066374971397 2020-11-23 08:18:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DisabledStem Does your uni have a disability network or a disability officer in your student union who could fight your corner? Failing this, you could try getting in touch with @DUnionUK which are a union ran by and for disabled people.
1330663468035436544 2020-11-23 08:04:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> All I’m saying is I literally dropped a freshly microwaved lasagne on my bare foot and went to casualty because of it 🙈😅 #dyspraxia
1330662617996791809 2020-11-23 08:01:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Here I ask my #autistic and #dyspraxic friends to chime in and help this person figure out if they have #dyspraxia or not. There are huge cross-overs so sometimes the lines get blurred
1330659938897637384 2020-11-23 07:50:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This is brilliant. @DyspraxicHelp4U have you heard this radio 1 segment?
1330623076111966208 2020-11-23 05:23:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver Likewise! ☺️
1330622327990652929 2020-11-23 05:20:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver Thanks, I’m not too bad. Hope you’re doing good!
1330621297693503491 2020-11-23 05:16:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Congratulations @DyspraxicShaver you deserve it! If you follow me but don’t follow him, get your fingers clicking folks! 😜
1330616951362744328 2020-11-23 04:59:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you are looking for more dyspraxic people to follow @EmilyyNics is an absolute angel 💕
1330614449288392708 2020-11-23 04:49:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @leiopelma @lilririah The dyspraxic community are still trying to get folk to know we exist let alone educate other people on the ins and outs of dyspraxia. I haven’t done any threads but here is a blog post I wrote (though it’d be great if people did wider research themselves)  https://t.co/rzRG4tYDNt
1330599424893005828 2020-11-23 03:49:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I was told earlier that I should share links instead of hashtags. But for the #dyspraxic community, our hashtags are how we find eachother, events and information. Just because one tweet doesn’t have a link doesn’t mean others won’t. It all depends on the purpose of the tweet.
1330598506629894147 2020-11-23 03:46:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DocFiBrown @DyspraxicHelp4U That’s why people like @DyspraxicHelp4U and myself do what we do. We don’t just want to make people aware, we want to make them care. One day we will have an equal footing in the #NeurodiverseSquad. Until then the few of us speaking on #dyspraxia need to be loud and proud.
1330575422967476224 2020-11-23 02:14:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I’m really glad I’ve been able to help you. I know all to well how lost you can feel before finding out and how validating it can feel after!
1330573106637893633 2020-11-23 02:05:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx It really is healing. Having a reason, an understanding, knowing why. It helps others be more understanding but also helps you find strategies too - because us dyspraxics can be injury prone even with strategies 😂
1330572081604472832 2020-11-23 02:01:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I’m glad I could help. I hope the more awareness we can raise the more people can find the answers they seek. And dyspraxic kids in the future may get recognised earlier. You are welcome to drop a message anytime, response times vary though 🤣
1330571148107673601 2020-11-23 01:57:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx If you want to chat or ask questions my dm’s are always open 💕
1330570940531478530 2020-11-23 01:56:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I 100% empethise. On top of the lack of awareness by professionals women/minorities face further barriers that adds amother layer. We‘re fighting for change though. Me @DyspraxicHelp4U, @DysSingSongMike, @krystalbellax &amp; more are working on things behind the scenes so keep posted
1330570003209478147 2020-11-23 01:53:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx @ChiariChey Let the emotions pour. They are natural. There is a small community of us on twitter, but if you’d like to get to know other dyspraxics Facebook groups are the best place to start and also where the community is most active ☺️
1330569526866546688 2020-11-23 01:51:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx The dyspraxia community welcomes you. Most of the community recognise self diagnosis too as we are all to aware of the barriers that exist at the moment
1330569348419891203 2020-11-23 01:50:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @CosmoFaenyx I feel you on this. I remember when I got diagnosed at 21. You get this mix of emotions. Relief, joy, acceptance, an answer to the why. But equally there is anger, resentment, sadness at the lack of awareness and being let down by professionals who should have been able to help
1330566811205644291 2020-11-23 01:40:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DamienEvans7 My phone changes things like that all the time 😂 There is lots crossover between dyspraxia/autism so often dyspraxia gets reduced to merely a symptom of autism. Despite the fact it is a diagnosis in its own and despite it being estimated that around 10% of people are dyspraxic🙃
1330565081151795207 2020-11-23 01:33:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ChiariChey Cannot state how accurate this is. Literal professionals/experts haven’t heard of us or brush of dyspraxia as a mere symptom of other things (because of the cross over). Those that do get recognised are more likely to be male for similar reasons that autistic women get missed
1330563143005851649 2020-11-23 01:25:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> To those who have seen part 1 of my thread and followed my account, don’t forget to check these lovely people out 👇  There is also @krystalbellax who in true dyspraxic fashion I forgot to add until after 🙈😅
1330498753103622154 2020-11-22 21:09:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you notice an awareness week is happening and you don’t know what the thing the awareness week is for is about - instead of getting people with the diagnosis to be your own personal google, it doesn’t take much to simply type #dyspraxia into a search bar.
1330485331926388737 2020-11-22 20:16:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Oh I forgot there is also @krystalbellax who has a TON of great videos on her channel!   I guess this is tweet 3/2 🙈😅😂
1330485040837431298 2020-11-22 20:15:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you care about the #NeurodiverseSquad you should care about #dyspraxia. I recommend following these 👇 @DYSPRAXIAFDTN  @DyspraxicHelp4U  @DyspraxicWomen  @DysSingSongMike  @rosiemay_r @EmilyyNics @dyspraxicchef @DyspraxicShaver @DyspraxicBee @marvelousmollie @NDNeuroNews 2/2
1330485038220251136 2020-11-22 20:15:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The fact that there are people on the #NeurodiverseSquad who don’t know what #dyspraxia is, it’s frankly heartbreaking. If you don’t know what dyspraxia is, my own blog is in my bio. Google is a thing but equally it doesn’t take much to follow some #dyspraxia themed accounts. 1/2
1330483474818535431 2020-11-22 20:09:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ZZillions This post was just to let people know that it is awareness week (which they can look up if they want). I plan on sharing content throughout the week though as this is the Irish awareness week I recommend following @DyspraxicIRE &amp; @dyspraxiaIRL which are both Irish accounts ☺️
1330470807777271810 2020-11-22 19:18:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AdultingADHD @NDNeuroNews @rosiemay_r @krystalbellax @kayleighm5297 @QueerlyAutistic @QLMentoring @DysSingSongMike @EmilyyNics @ItsEmilyKaty Thank you 💕
1330457158614446080 2020-11-22 18:24:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Did you know that the character Ryan in @bbcdoctorwho was written to be #dyspraxic? There is very little representation of #dyspraxia in the media, of the representation we do have, he is the most famous.  #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek #DyspraxiaAwarenessIrl #DyspraxiaAwarenessIre #DCD  https://t.co/B2TYVNk4M2
1330452923491475456 2020-11-22 18:07:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JimmyWafer Any and every tweet counts! The main thing is to get the word out, #dyspraxia is a thing, #dyspraxic people are here! 💕
1330452168764256257 2020-11-22 18:04:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Can some dyspraxic/neurodivergent friends and allies help us out this week? (Tagging some of you lovely people to get the word out)  @NDNeuroNews @rosiemay_r @krystalbellax @kayleighm5297 @QueerlyAutistic @QLMentoring @DysSingSongMike @AdultingADHD @EmilyyNics @ItsEmilyKaty  🙏💕
1330450701944844288 2020-11-22 17:59:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hey everyone! I know that a lot of #NeurodiverseSquad peeps have followed me to learn about the #dyspraxic experience. Did you know that this week is the Irish #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek? It would be amazing if you could help us to get #dyspraxia trending this awareness week! 💕
1330325923011436551 2020-11-22 09:43:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutisticPb *resting  Someone liked my reply and I noticed my typo 🙈😅
1330323091671703558 2020-11-22 09:31:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @A_Silent_Child For shocked I use this one 😱
1330322919474520065 2020-11-22 09:31:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @A_Silent_Child I use it as if to say “I have no words”
1330322788524167170 2020-11-22 09:30:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @A_Silent_Child A mix of all the options
1330322710061330434 2020-11-22 09:30:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @A_Silent_Child I don’t use this one I only use these two tongue emojis 😜😝
1330322395207520258 2020-11-22 09:29:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @A_Silent_Child Mix of anxious and not well
1330322188692492290 2020-11-22 09:28:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @A_Silent_Child I don’t use this one because it makes me cringe
1330310652330700800 2020-11-22 08:42:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron Thanks Aaron! I have seen Kimmy Schmidt but will check out the trailers for the other suggestions ☺️
1330305277384667138 2020-11-22 08:21:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As a #dyspraxic person I can’t state the amount of times I have had to correct people and they still don’t get it. Dyspraxia is a #disability but it isn’t a #LearningDisability. It is however a #LearningDifficulty.
1330302406375206921 2020-11-22 08:09:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Loneliness is consuming me. I feel sadness all the time. I can’t stop all the reasons I hate myself from spinning in my head.
1330297024445636608 2020-11-22 07:48:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutisticPb I don’t know if I’m autistic or not as I haven’t been assessed. So at the moment only suspect. But I have been told I have testing sad face. So people always think I am sad. Which is inconvenient when random men come up to me asking me to smile.
1330294782061666306 2020-11-22 07:39:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @im_allsmiles_ Already seen this one but thank you ☺️
1330291376219623429 2020-11-22 07:25:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @StephenWicks83 Thank you 🙏
1330291325544124427 2020-11-22 07:25:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @deanleake02 I have already seen the good place, but thank you ☺️
1330290332014088196 2020-11-22 07:21:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @StephenWicks83 I know the crown but I’m specifically looking for a feel good/escapism thing as I’m not feeling too great right now. Thanks though
1330289333383868416 2020-11-22 07:17:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Anyone know any feel good tv shows or films that are available on UK streaming services? I need a pick me up.   In the past I’ve enjoyed the following if that helps give an idea of my taste 👇  Jane The Virgin Crazy Ex Girlfriend  Dynasty
1330259558514778115 2020-11-22 05:19:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic If there is anything I can do to help let me know. I hope from one #neurodivergent person to another, I hope you (and the rest of the autistic community) know you have an ally in me. I report the hateful stuff when I see it, but if there is anything else I can do let me know!
1330244486614683651 2020-11-22 04:19:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @charters65 I disagree hence my tweet 😜
1330241499536166914 2020-11-22 04:07:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @charters65 Last week is the only week they haven’t undermarked her. So many times they give her 7 or lower when she deserves at least 8!
1330239938818961411 2020-11-22 04:01:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Anyone else think they keep marking Clara too low on #Strictly2020? She’s one of the best ones! #Strictly

1330212585942245377 2020-11-22 02:12:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autcareandshare I think @DUnionUK might be able to help if you check out the website. Possibly @exceptional_Ind  could help. @DyspraxicHelp4U is quite in the know on this kind of thing too so I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if you ping him a message!
1330209158512185346 2020-11-22 01:59:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Some NT folk like feeling important/powerful/needed &amp; think by “helping” they can be so. Some NT folk “help” for praise/credit but don’t actually care about the folk they “help”. They think as we are disabled we don’t understand &amp; will be greatful for each breadcrumb they throw.
1330206518348832772 2020-11-22 01:48:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AnneliRoberts Facebook in terms of actually communicating but YouTube for entertainment
1330203635456860166 2020-11-22 01:37:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hey #dyspraxic people, let’s hop on and do this. We need to unlearn ableist language we were bought up with and stand in solidarity with other #neurodivergent and #disabled peers, friends and allies.
1330201450044076035 2020-11-22 01:28:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow I can empathise completely. I don’t mind decaf but it doesn’t quite feel the same. Having said that, decaf cola isn’t too bad
1330200654460153862 2020-11-22 01:25:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> My issue is I actually like coffee but caffeine sends my anxiety through the roof
1330199426938396677 2020-11-22 01:20:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow So that’s how Borris Johnson got elected 😂
1330194064189382662 2020-11-22 00:59:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow If you are on a budget there are ones in the countryside in the UK like Gaia House. And I believe that they have low income options too. But I get the uk countryside is still closeish in that you can hear farms, the odd car/plane/helicopter etc
1330192428666589192 2020-11-22 00:52:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow Yes I’m with you on that one. I was lucky enough to go on a young persons silent retreat at a place called Gaia House in my late teens. I learned about loving kindness practice there and found it particularly helpful!
1330190821598048257 2020-11-22 00:46:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 @Abducted_Cow Thanks Kayleigh 💕

1330189289221656578 2020-11-22 00:40:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty #Dyspraxia - the member of the famous super hero team #NeurodiverseSquad. Special ability? Falling with style.  https://t.co/bx8a5KeWiz
1330185346420781062 2020-11-22 00:24:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 Thanks Kayleigh 💕
1330185285301317638 2020-11-22 00:24:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow If I had any suggestions I’d give them. Spirituality and art (not the woo woo kind) brings me some degree of comfort but it doesn’t stop it entirely. But maybe it might help you too. It sounds dumb but in terms of art those colouring books are actually not bad
1330184009654079490 2020-11-22 00:19:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Abducted_Cow If I could make my brain not do this I would. The only thing that stops it for me is food, and obviously that’s not a healthy coping mechanism
1330182969680670728 2020-11-22 00:15:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Imagine “I hate myself” going round your head on a loop. But all the reasons you hate yourself are circling with it. And it’s 24/7. You can’t stop it. That’s my brain.
1330141889291542529 2020-11-21 21:31:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty If I did it’d be literally the same, you summed up my own thinking so perfectly. Especially about the firing of people “cuz bad vibes” bit. When I heard that I’m like... was the autistic person she supposedly hired and then replaced with Maddie “bad vibes”? 🙃
1330100144910573568 2020-11-21 18:46:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> WEST SIDE STORY MY OTHER FAVOURITE MOVIE/MUSICAL THAT I HAVE ALSO SEEN LIVE IS TRENDING. CHRISTMAS HAD COME EARLY 😭💕🎄  https://t.co/48WpIzHcj9
1330098260778823681 2020-11-21 18:38:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Moulin Rouge, one of my favourite movies/musicals of all time that I can basically mouth to every scene because I know it so well, is trending. This is amazing 😍☺️💕  https://t.co/3MM5YXMaBf
1329935866291216384 2020-11-21 07:53:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty Ok. I selected not sure because if people uploaded videos on YouTube like commentary or review videos I might watch that but not watch it directly yah know?
1329923565290971139 2020-11-21 07:04:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty He’s called grumpy for a reason. He’s clearly woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I have received nothing but love and support from the #ActuallyAutistic community. I hope I can/do provide the same in return 💕
1329921924005294081 2020-11-21 06:57:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Honestly same. I prepose you listen to this to take your mind off big fringe magoo 👉   https://t.co/499Yz3j3lt
1329919881064685569 2020-11-21 06:49:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado I give a shit. I don’t want to speak for the autistic community so have simply retweeted stuff to show my support. But if anyone needs a friend, a distraction, I am 100% here.
1329911911710863361 2020-11-21 06:18:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 Why do I feel like I can guess who said this 🤔🙃
1329910480941551616 2020-11-21 06:12:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I do this too. The ones I’ve been worst with was Jane The Virgin and Crazy Ex Girlfriend. So many gooey heart moments 😭💕
1329909915448700931 2020-11-21 06:10:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Omg I’m so glad I’m not the only one that does that!
1329908092520292352 2020-11-21 06:02:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I LOVED THIS TOO I HAD GOOEY HEART FEELINGS
1329892702796853248 2020-11-21 05:01:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty When you say disabled and autistic do you mean both? Because I’m disabled but at the time of writing this, do not have an autism diagnosis
1329888347892879361 2020-11-21 04:44:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hey #NeurodiverseSquad! This is my first ever birthday fundraiser. This charity is special to me &amp; helped me lots over the years. They are a big factor into why I went to uni &amp; how I found out I am #dyspraxic. If you could donate or RT I’d be greatful 🙏  https://t.co/kw5sstOExx
1329871499675770882 2020-11-21 03:37:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r @DyspraxicHelp4U I don’t know of anything but will retweet the original tweet just in case
1329840780173844480 2020-11-21 01:35:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> THIS 👇
1329771575151824896 2020-11-20 21:00:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Mr_Gabrielli I should say decent neurotypical people 😂  But agreed. The least she could have done was have one of those on set consultants from the community she wishes to represent. The LEAST.
1329771137300107264 2020-11-20 20:58:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ok I need to make a pun about the sucky music person: Sia, wouldn’t want to bia (See yah, wouldn’t want to be yah) 😂
1329767296588505089 2020-11-20 20:43:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Mr_Gabrielli I am dumbfounded. How can she not see the hole she’s dug? I can’t imagine a neurotypical person wanting to work with her in future if they could see her attitude right now. Unprofessional, disrespectful - she sounds like a spoiled child that can’t handle things not going her way
1329758633870176256 2020-11-20 20:08:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Am I fleeting or do I not have fleet priveledges? 😂  https://t.co/WrjKKEi2ol
1329740240983044096 2020-11-20 18:55:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat It’s also perfectly ok to stick to the road you are comfortable on if the others are too much. My car might be too wide for the road you are on, your wheels might not be able to handle mine. But we can meet at the crossroads and while we are there, we can learn from each other ☺️
1329739035225567232 2020-11-20 18:51:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat Thank you, I appreciate it. It’s all a learning curve. And I knew you meant no harm which is why I’m my first tweet I made clear you meant well. But I’m glad we had this conversation as I think in many ways we can learn more through conversation than books could ever teach us
1329738598908891138 2020-11-20 18:49:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat I’ve heard others speak of feeling at a cross-roads, I can see why with the cross-overs. But that’s not to say that the other/new paths at the cross-roads aren’t real. Maybe one path is too bumpy or another leads somewhere you don’t like. But they are real. Hope that makes sense
1329737528056885254 2020-11-20 18:45:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat I totally see your perspective, but the language in your original tweet (admittedly it was a quote but yah know) was dismissive of dyspraxia reducing it to simply a symptom. There are a lot of cross overs between dyspraxia and other diagnosis but it is very real 2/2
1329737076930195456 2020-11-20 18:43:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat I get it can be difficult when you have multiple diagnosis. And if you associate with or experience some diagnosis more than others sticking with those communities isn’t an issue at all so long as you don’t diminish/erase the other diagnosis for others. 1/2
1329735733083582464 2020-11-20 18:37:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat Thanks you 💕
1329731749744701443 2020-11-20 18:22:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat I’d add actually that a big part of the dyspraxic community make an effort to support or raise awareness of issues impacting the autistic community because we see and respect you as allies. We don’t ask for much, but at least respect that our diagnosis is very real and impacts us
1329731305039392768 2020-11-20 18:20:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat This blog explains my own diagnosis experience and in turn why a dyspraxia can be so important but there are many others with similar experiences who I assure you feel the same. I recommend reading it so you can learn for the future  https://t.co/5ryu21rNZh
1329731028919967744 2020-11-20 18:19:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheKafkaEffect @justalittlechat I get your words (not the quote) were about you. But the implication with the quote added is that dyspraxia is not a diagnosis but rather a symptom of something else. If you don’t associate with dyspraxia/want one less label easy solution is don’t mention it. 1/2
1329597823571161089 2020-11-20 09:29:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> We are part of the #NeurodiverseSquad, but we are being erased and left behind. Please respect our diagnosis, recognise us, listen to our experiences. We are struggling and need our #neurodivergent peers/allies support. Recognise #dyspraxic people, don’t erase us. 4/4
1329597821968916481 2020-11-20 09:29:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Rhetoric like this sets the #dyspraxic community back and makes it harder for us to be recognised. This in turn makes it harder for us to get diagnosed and means that we can’t access vital support or services. 3/4
1329597820043726848 2020-11-20 09:29:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Please stop reducing our disability to merely a symptom of something else. Awareness of #dyspraxia is very poor at the moment and our community are fighting to get the recognition we deserve. So many of us struggle with mental and physical health due to lack of support. 2/4
1329597817258528768 2020-11-20 09:29:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I get that this person and the article they are quoting mean well... but this is SUPER invalidating of #dyspraxic people and erases our lived experiences. Not all dyspraxics are autistic, #dyspraxia is a diagnosis in its own right. 1/4
1329581012666429441 2020-11-20 08:23:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Cleaning glasses? Never heard of cleaning glasses. What is this magic you speak of? 🤔🙈😅😂
1329576345828003841 2020-11-20 08:04:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U @DyspraxicWomen @DH4UWomen @kayleighm5297 If I’m not doing a big tweet or thread (because character limit) I shall do so! We only changed to 2 people this week so still figuring ins and outs 😂
1329575339367034881 2020-11-20 08:00:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 @DyspraxicHelp4U @DyspraxicWomen @DH4UWomen I’d call him an asset rather than an inspiration, but that’s only because I know that the use of the word inspiration can be controversial for some people. But I share your regards/compliments toward him ☺️
1329574849816104961 2020-11-20 07:58:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U @DyspraxicWomen @DH4UWomen @kayleighm5297 also tweets for @DyspraxicWomen 🤪
1329571791178780674 2020-11-20 07:46:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 You deserve it!
1329547589256155136 2020-11-20 06:10:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hey folks, for the first time I have decided to do a birthday fundraiser on facebook. I have chosen @YWTrust as my charity to donate to. It would mean a lot if you could share and/or donate to my fundraiser.  https://t.co/kw5sstOExx
1329539605096493057 2020-11-20 05:38:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> You’d think by mid November I’d realise that candles alone aren’t enough to heat my room up 😂
1329519132430176258 2020-11-20 04:17:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Once covid is over I want to try #LARPing. I wanted to do it this year, but yah know. Any tips for a first timer?
1329509239098896385 2020-11-20 03:37:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic @chloegray6 was just chatting to me about this very topic
1329507254878482439 2020-11-20 03:30:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I typed it in... got three suggestions but as one was an incomplete sentence I clicked to see what was suggested after. See pictures for my results 😂  https://t.co/IgHOWKvlV9
1329506158109978626 2020-11-20 03:25:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic It’s like you are describing my brain. And it’s worse when things build up for ages then you get a cliffhanger and are worried about the characters. And if the cliff hanger is at the end of a season... god help me 😭😂😬😅
1329505503140044808 2020-11-20 03:23:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer No idea but it’d be interesting if the game itself translated over a bit like how we have it/tag over here
1329503838580125701 2020-11-20 03:16:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer It was a game from a kids show called Dick &amp; Dom
1329502220417642500 2020-11-20 03:10:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD>  https://t.co/bovowIapz3
1329499649535848451 2020-11-20 02:59:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Did American kids play “bogies” or was that just us? 😂
1329384667162750976 2020-11-19 19:22:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose I find the same issue if I’m given a load of text. I work best with questions. I learn through questions I think because it helps me unpuzzle the thing I’m learning in my head
1329382435398823939 2020-11-19 19:14:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Mandalorian has one of the most boaring theme songs yet I can’t get it out my head  https://t.co/iyTQ1sVKMw
1329376932547489792 2020-11-19 18:52:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> To those complaining about #WorldToiletDay being on #InternationalMensDay or to the people thinking it’s a joke, this 👇is what it’s about.
1329369378194911233 2020-11-19 18:22:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> There are so many more reasons this day is important, too many to list. Let’s open up some conversations on #InternationalMensDay day. Listen to and support the men in our lives. 7/7
1329369375707701249 2020-11-19 18:22:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 6) When it comes to violence and assault of ANY kind we need to make sure male victims feel safe and confident coming forward. We need to believe men, not judge them.   6/7
1329369373753167872 2020-11-19 18:22:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 5) On that note, single dads, they are a thing. So are stay at home dads. We need to stop stigmatising or judging dads. Men taking on caring roles, supporting and loving their kids is amazing!   5/7
1329369371614056449 2020-11-19 18:22:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 4) Paternal rights is another reason this day is important. Men’s paternity leave is usually not as good as maternity leave. In divorce cases men are less likely to get custody or visiting rights too. Let’s support and encourage the dads out there.   4/7
1329369369386868738 2020-11-19 18:22:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 3) We drill into women the important of checking our breasts and doing cervical cancer tests. It’s important that we encourage men to check their parts and to get checked too. Also remember that while rare, cis men can also get breast cancer.   3/7
1329369367524610049 2020-11-19 18:22:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 2) We often hear women’s beauty standards spoken about. We encourage women to be confident in their bodies. We need to do the same for men. Let’s celebrate the uniqueness of each man, handsome in their own way.   2/7
1329369364341137408 2020-11-19 18:22:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> To those of you that think I am, and I quote, “a feminazi”, here are just some reasons I think #InternationalMensDay is important 👇  1) Suicide rates are higher in men than women. We need to support men and ensure they feel safe/confident to open up about mental health.  1/7
1329357171348418561 2020-11-19 17:33:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Exactly. And one of the reasons for lockdown aside from preventing deaths is to stop the NHS getting overwhelmed. So this has to be the most idiotic thing I’ve heard
1329356904326455296 2020-11-19 17:32:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic That’s so dumb. Are they including Xmas eve and Boxing Day and New Years in this five days? If so they are, I have no words. But it’s like they want people to die. Many families, mine included don’t even have the space to social distance in our house
1329356431083106307 2020-11-19 17:30:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic That could literally cause hundreds (realistically thousands) of deaths not to mention increase the infection rates. Especially it being winter (I heard that the summer weather doesn’t stop it but helps slow it)!
1329355797093027842 2020-11-19 17:28:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Wait so are they wanting to keep lockdown lower it for five days just for Christmas then put it back? As if our government couldn’t get more incompetent!
1329355351536381952 2020-11-19 17:26:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose I think it’s great that the support is out there for ADHD, but equally this is definitely support you should have gotten sooner. Society still has a long way to go in recognising neurodivergent women. On an aside I hope one day proper support will also be available for dyspraxia
1329052704652603395 2020-11-18 21:23:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @HappyHealthSci1 I do have fake ivy faery lights on the other side of my bed xD
1329025170443472897 2020-11-18 19:34:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer @QueerlyAutistic How do you view the original post on facebook? I have never seen this function before
1329024876326346752 2020-11-18 19:33:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Anyone else put pretty things like these leaves on their bed and imagine they are in a fantasy land with faeries and elves? Just me? Ok 😅😂  https://t.co/BVzSlLglhL
1329021468336852994 2020-11-18 19:19:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer I had thought about that too but a post (I think it was a quote tweet) by @QueerlyAutistic raised the point that introducing this as a function means you could retweet something only for the original tweeter to completely change it, possibly to something you disagree with
1329000791915589634 2020-11-18 17:57:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This list is hugely important due to the lack of recognition, representation and research of, as well as the under-diagnosis of, #neurodivergent women. This list will be a helpful tool for ND women themselves, as well as those wishing to support or research about them ☺️
1328876133568442369 2020-11-18 09:42:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Instead of #fleets could twitter maybe introduce a function where you can follow hashtags? That would be a genuinely helpful feature.
1328824471164170242 2020-11-18 06:16:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The results are in. Of the 28 people that voted the consensus is that allies are indeed part of the squad - and I agree!   #neurodiversesquad #neurodivergent #neurodiverse #neurodiversity
1328823660178771972 2020-11-18 06:13:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @jessiegender This is good to read as someone who is dyspraxic and dyslexic. Not too clunky, the colours aren’t overwhelming and the font isn’t too harsh. It’s ideal 😎
1328777767786328067 2020-11-18 03:11:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @sadhbh_dwyer I shall look him up! Thanks!
1328776324329168896 2020-11-18 03:05:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Please can you guys send me links to your favourite #ActuallyAutistic comedians so I can dispel the myth that autistic folk can’t tell jokes? Thanks. PS someone did actually ask me if autistic people can tell jokes 🙃  #autism #autistic #ASD #AskingAutistics #neurodiversesquad
1328772458938310658 2020-11-18 02:50:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Quickly checks mouthwash label in bathroom
1328771912797982733 2020-11-18 02:48:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 4 hours left to vote in my poll if you haven’t done so already!   #Neurodiverse #Neurodivergent #Neurodiversity #NeurodiverseSquad
1328744383810842625 2020-11-18 00:58:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So I started watching midnight gospel. I’m on episode 7. My #neurodivergent ass recognised that voice. You lads can bet I got excited when the woman herself confirmed my suspicions!
1328733969312047105 2020-11-18 00:17:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> My sister in law posted about Stevens Universe and now the theme song is in my head!  https://t.co/o2y8sNyqZ3
1328725036891561986 2020-11-17 23:41:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @R_J_Chapman I’d read it with either cover! 😆
1328724593738215425 2020-11-17 23:40:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I agree. Perhaps a “gramit” button where it doesn’t let you delete words but does let you change spellings or punctuation 🤔
1328724003238916097 2020-11-17 23:37:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I think your suggestion where it says clearly that it’s been edited is a good one. Because as a dyspraxic and dyslexic person - not being able to edit my obvious grammar mistakes is frustrating.
1328722839835455488 2020-11-17 23:33:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you have the funds definitely donate to @YWTrust. I can say from personal experience that this is a charity that takes real action to listen to and support young women. It’s through YWT that I ended up deciding to go to uni and in turn how I found out I am dyspraxic.
1328715910803238918 2020-11-17 23:05:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Tbh not just with dyspraxia but other meurominorities it seems to be common for diagnosis to be hidden or under-played. The conversation about late diagnosis is important but I think we need to open up the table to understand the experience of people with “hidden” diagnosis too.
1328714761106812934 2020-11-17 23:01:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I don’t talk about it much. But my special interests are 👇  Eurovision   Magic (both fantasy magic and modern day magical practices)   Folklore (especially involving faeries)  Greek mythology   Religion in general  Tiny houses  Ancient sites/history   Music &amp; musicals
1328712702743744512 2020-11-17 22:52:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Before dyspraxia I didn’t have a label. I was weird, dumb, ditzy, stupid etc. Dyspraxia made me see none of that was true. However I agree it doesn’t explain all and I have strong suspicions that I’m also autistic. But while the world is topsy turvy I’m not perusing diagnosis.
1328675635817041921 2020-11-17 20:25:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose This sounds exactly like me when I got diagnosed with dyspraxia. Utter joy at having a reason, an understanding, an answer to the why. But also tears for number of reasons. Too many to list in a tweet which is why I started my blog 😂
1328658515465007109 2020-11-17 19:17:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Thank you @Beautidivergen2 💕
1328472628550651906 2020-11-17 06:58:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m curious. Do you see allies as part of the #neurodiversesquad or do you think its exclusive to those who are/identify as #neurodivergent? 🤔
1328104038261534720 2020-11-16 06:34:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AdultingADHD Same but also my nose!
1328102881598312448 2020-11-16 06:29:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AdultingADHD I couldn’t have done it especially with all those bugs 🙈
1328102184559505408 2020-11-16 06:26:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron The woman called Bev that Ant and Dec were telling to hurry up. Don’t know how else to describe her because she’s one of the celebs I’m less familiar with
1328101456759681026 2020-11-16 06:23:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron One of the celebs on I’m a celeb

1327903317754867717 2020-11-15 17:16:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker @DyspraxicHelp4U Deadline day is midnight today!
1327575754440388608 2020-11-14 19:34:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Eating - but that’s not necessarily a good thing as I have BED and due to lack of friends growing up and lack of access to therapy in adulthood food became the one release I have. My eating issues have caused me debt, obesity, stretch marks and avoidance of social situations.
1327561071708794881 2020-11-14 18:36:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ok but does anyone remember a kids show called Kenny The Shark?

1327321515726163968 2020-11-14 02:44:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado I have never seen such a hairy elephant!
1327289793995288576 2020-11-14 00:38:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kazADHD Leggings for me. Jeans are quite fiddly and the texture can be off. Plus where the waist is can make or break comfort for me. A good pair of jeans can be amazing, but I find it very hard to find jeans that are actually comfortable
1327201791264612354 2020-11-13 18:48:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The existence of coconut
1327178173067431936 2020-11-13 17:15:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @PulseCheckTech @BifInMediasRes I agree with this depending on what the thing is. Because in the case of dyspraxia people genuinely aren’t aware, even a lot of educators and GP’s. So for the dyspraxic community in particular, awareness is hugely important.
1327175138501140481 2020-11-13 17:03:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The government
1327174852042698753 2020-11-13 17:01:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> People asking lots of questions
1327173214318047234 2020-11-13 16:55:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I can’t believe people are complaining over this giff. She was celebrating the win of one of her party members who happened to win in what was once Jo Swinsons seat. She was celebrating one woman’s gain, not another women’s loss. Leave her be and let her enjoy the football win!  https://t.co/P5oCEJLnyE
1327170729536876544 2020-11-13 16:45:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So she was on the Lib Dem coalition cabinet and loves Maggie, so doesn’t that effectively make her a Tory? 😂  Aside from my slightly snappy comment there Sturgeon was by no means celebrating her loss, she was celebrating her own parties win.
1327169702980935681 2020-11-13 16:41:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Sturgeon was in no way cheering Swinsons loss. She was cheering her own parties win against an opposing party.   If you don’t remember who Swinson is, she was on the cabinet in the Lib Dem Tory coalition so that should tell you all you need to know about her.

1326965383375581184 2020-11-13 03:09:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I completely agree with Kayleigh here. Hate will NOT be tolerated in the #dyspraxic community.
1326943905741492224 2020-11-13 01:44:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @The_GingerSheep Totally agree. For all we know things from our past could even help us progress. Look at architecture and design as an example - there are huge innovations that have come from simple yet unexpected things. But if we destroy the little of our history that’s left we’ll never know.
1326942607864377348 2020-11-13 01:39:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @The_GingerSheep That makes more sense, thanks for clarifying. I agree, it’s a world heritage site, but apparently slightly speeding up traffic for a tiny part of the UK is more important 🙃
1326941315913936897 2020-11-13 01:33:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @The_GingerSheep Stonehenge is culturally and historically significant. They still don’t care. So much of our ancient history has already been lost to an unrecoverable degree. This really is a travesty. But I doubt they will ever care.
1326939991809941505 2020-11-13 01:28:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @pvalles1972 @RaspberryMcCann @englisheduCATER @bbcthesocial The video is hugely important because it explains what dyspraxia actually is to an audience who for the most part are not dyspraxic. As such it helps people learn about and understand us. Also entertainment is no less important than teaching, drag as an art brings joy to people.
1326933937613139969 2020-11-13 01:04:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Cases are as high as ever, death# went over 50k... yet Rishi allegedly wants to do eat out to help out AGAIN. We really are living in a dystopia.
1326932062260097024 2020-11-13 00:57:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This breaks my heart. It really does. So much unexplored history is buried there. So much wildlife. It is a world heritage site and is a sacred religious space. One of the most significant and sacred pagan sites in the world. I feel such deep sorrow especially being pagan myself.
1326929046421315601 2020-11-13 00:45:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So sad to see they had to go early! Maybe they will get a second chance in next years Strictly. I hope the virus doesn’t impact them too badly!
1326812010256998400 2020-11-12 17:00:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Why am I not surprised by this 🙃
1326811686641291266 2020-11-12 16:58:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> My grandfather was Polish &amp; all the brexit stuff &amp; the ending of free movement cuts deep. The rhetoric is heartbreaking. At my old work one guy was chatting about Polish people this, Polish people that. He thought I’d agree. His face dropped when I explained my surname is Polish.
1326809465283284992 2020-11-12 16:50:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl Don’t get me wrong I’m very critical of all this stuff. But like America with their flag, it’s starting to become a mortal sin not to worship the Union Jack over here. Which is why I’m careful what I say when it comes to the institution that is Britain and the monarchy.
1326808453256503296 2020-11-12 16:46:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl They always do these things “for public servants” but it’s all propaganda. The LEAST they could do is give pay raises, but instead they would rather parade them and feed into the illusion that Britain is “great”. Remember that stupid badge they made for the NHS?
1326805609744830464 2020-11-12 16:34:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl Jubilee celebrations are never for public servants. They are literally just propaganda drives.
1326803225299857409 2020-11-12 16:25:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer There going to be some jubilee 4 day bank holiday thing for the queen. Again, not at all a royalist but I’ll take that long weekend 😂
1326801110955331586 2020-11-12 16:16:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m no royalist, and it’s not until 2022 - but I think we all need that long weekend to look forward to considering AT LEAST the first half of 2021 will be similar to this year. Won’t look forward to the nationalist propaganda celebrations though 😂
1326651121109184513 2020-11-12 06:20:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U Twitter really does need an edit but for the sanity of us dyspraxic dyslexics 😂
1326650057156915202 2020-11-12 06:16:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Now I’m onto the winner takes it all. Why is ABBA making me cry? They never made me cry before. Send help 😭😂
1326649725123252228 2020-11-12 06:15:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U I don’t normally but what you said completely changed the meaning 🙈😅

1326645074348879879 2020-11-12 05:56:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Why am I realising how emotional ABBA songs are now of all moments? Legit Knowing Me Knowing You just made my ass cry

1326641751252209664 2020-11-12 05:43:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> A #dyspraxic drag queen! This brings me so much joy and I empathise so much with what they described. Seeing someone like @RaspberryMcCann rock it as a dyspraxic person makes my heart sing!
1326638918419275776 2020-11-12 05:32:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apparently I had my message requests turned off on twitter and I had no idea! They are turned on now. Sorry folks!

1326579479108608003 2020-11-12 01:36:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 That’s such a Devon thing to do! I talk to inanimate objects all the time 🤣
1326578687588921345 2020-11-12 01:33:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Love this. It’s good to look at the plus side too. Looking at positives to a diagnosis does not diminish our difficulties in anyway. I actually love my long term memory because it means I can remember for instance how my oma (who is no longer with us) sounded when she spoke.
1326577463825195009 2020-11-12 01:28:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @UndercoverAutie This happened last year when I was at uni but I haven’t seen it happen this year
1326558970681696261 2020-11-12 00:14:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Absolutely shocking that she lost the case and even more shocking that she had her independence ripped from her in the first place. #FreeBritney
1326501893959524355 2020-11-11 20:27:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron No worries. Just wanted to clarify as I hate upsetting people. Thanks for clarifying
1326501001365508098 2020-11-11 20:24:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron But were you referring to what I said? If so I want to make it clear that I was highlighting an issue in the community. The post wasn’t intended as some kind of revenge thing. People keep reading what I say wrong at the moment so I wanted to make sure I clarify
1326491076434259969 2020-11-11 19:44:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> A weird sensory think I like is the feeling of a towel across the bottom half of my face. Especially my lips. The texture is honestly fantastic.
1326448626600710146 2020-11-11 16:56:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron I’m confused what you mean about the revenge?
1326447704432652289 2020-11-11 16:52:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ThisIsJordanKay I can write in cursive but people can’t read it and it makes my hand/wrist hurt because I’m dyspraxic. I find it hard to read cursive, especially if it’s the old timey style cursive!
1326447197374844933 2020-11-11 16:50:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Made these the other day from scratch including the dough. It was my first time ever doing a homemade dough. Not bar for a #dyspraxic I reckon! Was craving pizza express but as we are in lockdown I thought I’d try doing it myself!  https://t.co/IR9x5wxvNJ
1326301116963938305 2020-11-11 07:10:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Genuinely wish I lived in Brave New World and could just have one of those soma’s and feel ok.
1326297358196494338 2020-11-11 06:55:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rustic_clutter @Beautidivergen2 @DyspraxicWomen I’m for the confusion. I was just confused as I initially thought you were referring to me which is why I clarified. I meant no harm I was just trying to explain why I am uncomfortable being referred a certain way. But I realised you weren’t talking about me upon clarification
1326294169262940163 2020-11-11 06:42:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rustic_clutter @Beautidivergen2 @DyspraxicWomen I’m confused as I never called you a subsection, I just mentioned that certain intersections of neurodiversity have been likened to dogs in older papers which is why I’m not keen on the term. I knew you meant no harm and was just clarifying why I’m personally not keen on the term
1326289994214944770 2020-11-11 06:25:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rustic_clutter @Beautidivergen2 I get that which is why I said I didn’t think you meant anything by it, but without the clarification it came across more aimed at what I’d said. I’ve seen various subsections of neurodiversity compared to dogs in rubbish dated papers which is why I’m not keen on it
1326287017588760577 2020-11-11 06:14:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rustic_clutter @Beautidivergen2 While I love dogs I’m not keen on the phrase “dog like trust” when referring to neurodivergent people. I know you didn’t mean anything by it but I bring it up in case you end up in a similar conversation in future.
1326275840284504078 2020-11-11 05:29:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’ve heard this same line almost word for word from SOME #dyspraxic men in the community when talking about #dyspraxia and women.
1326275500835295235 2020-11-11 05:28:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @NeuroRebel I’ve heard almost the exact same line in the dyspraxic community when speaking up about dyspraxia and women.
1326274804337561600 2020-11-11 05:25:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 This very much relates to me. I can’t rationalise why people do cruel things and so trust people at face value on the assumption they won’t do those things. Spoiler alert, they always do the things.
1326272504202223617 2020-11-11 05:16:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Why is this so relevant to the #dyspraxic community? When I talk about things relating to dyspraxic women or take part in events on it all hell breaks loose. Haven’t spoken enough about lgbt topics to know if it’s the same there. Despite being bi I don’t talk about it much.
1326265037925871616 2020-11-11 04:46:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ThisIsJordanKay Yes but nobody can read it and it makes my wrist hurt because I’m dyspraxic
1326243849765871618 2020-11-11 03:22:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @StephenWicks83 I was under the impression there were other contributors to that book, but I could be mixing it up with another book. I know there was a book with a number of contributors

1326092067458740224 2020-11-10 17:19:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I saw an ad for a music artist called Bugzy Malone and all I can think is “we could have been anything that we wanted to be” 😂
1326089495444418566 2020-11-10 17:09:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef This didn’t happen this week. An explosion of rubbush stuff happened in the wider community right around awareness week all caused by angst towards dyspraxic women by two individuals. I didn’t look at the #dyspraxia tag for a month after that. It was too stressful. But thank you!
1326084110020997120 2020-11-10 16:47:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker You cheeky sod I’ll make sure you don’t get your meal deal if you do one 🤣
1326083920090238976 2020-11-10 16:46:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker you cheeky sod 😂
1326081100523986945 2020-11-10 16:35:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I so hope Tesco isn’t prancing is. Whatever you do, do not like or retweet 😂
1325984169252556800 2020-11-10 10:10:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Right, that’s me all caught up on the #dyspraxia tag. Same again tomorrow with the #dyspraxic tag 😂
1325983280370421761 2020-11-10 10:07:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> THIS is why we need the rest of the #neurodiversesquad to help us raise awareness. Not only do people confuse us for #dyslexia, not only have most people not heard of us but the oxford definition is spreading wrong (harmful) information that adults aren’t #dyspraxic.
1325978609463529473 2020-11-10 09:48:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax @dyspraxiadad would the above be of interest to you? ^
1325978212799803392 2020-11-10 09:46:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This was a really good panel. You can watch it back on the link folks!
1325976001868914689 2020-11-10 09:38:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Any recommendations?
1325975063116599296 2020-11-10 09:34:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @dyspraxicchef This is the most relatable tweet I’ve seen in a while. Bagels and I were once mortal enemies 😂
1325972039644180481 2020-11-10 09:22:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This is a great book which I cited in my undergrad dissertation - it seemed fitting as my dissertation was about neurodivergent women. This was one of the only books about dyspraxia written by a dyspraxic person and the only one written entirely by a dyspraxic woman that I found.
1325970286630629376 2020-11-10 09:15:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Any recommendations?
1325969780449357831 2020-11-10 09:13:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I missed this tweet during awareness week as I ended up taking a “social media relax” for my wellbeing. Are you dyspraxic and have something to say? Why not get it down in a book?   PS @rosiemay_r this may be of particular interest to you!
1325966392470999046 2020-11-10 08:59:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The second retweet of my finally checking the #dyspraxia tag again spree. This fabulous info graphic from @krystalbellax
1325964749541175296 2020-11-10 08:53:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> After a long and stressful month I’m checking back through the #dyspraxia tag starting with the dat I stopped. This is really handy 👇
1325943318300200961 2020-11-10 07:28:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I made a #neurodiversity spoon necklace out of clay!   #neurodiverse #neurodivergent #neurodiversesquad  https://t.co/opSe3tv3W0
1325916346283155458 2020-11-10 05:41:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> AMAZING NEWS
1325912541579649030 2020-11-10 05:25:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If by neurodiversity or neurodivergent you mean autism or ADHD can you please just say that from the start? There are other neurominorities who also deserve recognition in conversations about neurodiversity. So please just make it clear who/what you are talking about and why.
1325910000666079232 2020-11-10 05:15:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Don’t know if she is including dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, Tourette’s etc as part of neurodiversity (we are ND so should be included) but I do have quite a few autistic and ADHD followers so at least for you guys this could be a good opportunity! 👇
1325899424036511746 2020-11-10 04:33:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> My eating issues effect me so much. It’s even worse when food doesn’t turn out how I expected. Having an eating disorder &amp; sensory issues really is a curse. I feel sick because of texture but have binge cravings because I’m hungry because I couldn’t finish what I cooked.
1325828483470274562 2020-11-09 23:51:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I’d vote for you 💕
1325777844107153414 2020-11-09 20:30:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If student finance could not hound people who are out of work after graduating in the worst graduation year ever that’d be grand.
1325569894851747842 2020-11-09 06:44:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autcareandshare I’ll gladly send one to him! How can I do so? ☺️
1325565646709592065 2020-11-09 06:27:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So I didn’t look at the #dyspraxia tag yet. But I did try and make a #neurodiversity spoon necklace. Its got to dry before I can paint it!  https://t.co/MzNsUW3fu9
1325565198485348352 2020-11-09 06:25:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty Congratulations and well done! I wish you well on the next stage of your studies ☺️
1325368190755614720 2020-11-08 17:22:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic As a pagan with pagan friends in the US, I appreciate this tweet ☺️
1325365911042351104 2020-11-08 17:13:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I had a dream I adopted a dog that was taller than me that was a mix between Great Dane, grey hound and German Shepard. He was called howl and we bonded so hard and couldn’t be separated. Well I woke up, found out howl isn’t real and now I miss him 😭
1325217174668054528 2020-11-08 07:22:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Question - is twitch just for gaming? I’m thinking of live streaming to discuss neurodiversity related news but I’m not sure which platform would be best to do it 🤔
1325212034972184576 2020-11-08 07:02:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ok, but why is the Arthur theme song in my head?  https://t.co/lNIpVbDSfq
1325210482425294849 2020-11-08 06:56:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic @blueangel0909 Oh wow it was number 1 exactly 11 years before my birth!
1325209067279802369 2020-11-08 06:50:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Tbh this is also handy for dyspraxia and dyslexia
1325208180784156672 2020-11-08 06:47:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 I never use the term meltdown. I’ve always understood sensory overload to be the term to use. Is there a difference between sensory overload and challenging behaviour? I just want to make sure I’m not being harmful or incorrect in my understanding
1325205805776449536 2020-11-08 06:37:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This makes the news of Trumps loss that much sweeter
1325204645254488064 2020-11-08 06:33:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado The only trump I know is top trumps
1325199788350992389 2020-11-08 06:13:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @marvelousmollie I know that feeling. Finding community helps. On a personal level I also find prayer helps but I know that doesn’t float everyone’s boat
1325199517973581826 2020-11-08 06:12:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It just occurred to me that I can make some #neurodiversity themed things with my clay!
1325152255301988353 2020-11-08 03:04:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Honestly how is it legal to set off fireworks in the gardens of small terraced houses?! 🙃
1325151114845511687 2020-11-08 03:00:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @NDNeuroNews @DyspraxicWomen Thanks Aaron 💕
1325136724603760640 2020-11-08 02:03:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I guess its oompah loompah doopity do sod off to Trump 😂  https://t.co/Tttf6o6vIW
1325115700839657472 2020-11-08 00:39:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @alphabe51230500 That’s why I do what I do. How can people accept us if they don’t know we exist yah know?
1325115391438426117 2020-11-08 00:38:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> BIDEN WON TRUMP LOST  https://t.co/HgcLtwko0g
1325109886770946049 2020-11-08 00:16:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I actually feel guilty that I haven’t been doing enough but what happened mentally and emotionally drained me. I think I’ll start looking more at it again from tomorrow though and getting more active. You’ll see more #dyspraxic related stuff again soon. 2/2
1325109883713236997 2020-11-08 00:16:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #Dyspraxia awareness is so important to me, but some really rubbish stuff happened in the community behind the scenes recently and I haven’t looked at the tag since awareness week. I feel bad that I haven’t been doing as much, but I’ve needed some time to look after myself. 1/2
1325106198883037190 2020-11-08 00:01:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r I feel like Homer Simpson’s catch phrase “doe” sums up dyspraxic moments like this!  https://t.co/z1qLjepwq7
1325102116936015872 2020-11-07 23:45:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @beffybadbelly I think it depends on the context. Ie are you enveloped in something or are you using an envelope for your post
1325041605913538561 2020-11-07 19:45:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell I literally can’t lie. Even if I’m trying to keep a surprise like a gift a secret it’s really hard for me and I smile if I try concealing things. My body just won’t let me do it
1325031302916083714 2020-11-07 19:04:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Just looked. Its Saturday and we still don’t have the results. It must be a neurodivergent nightmare over in the US!
1324869947881906180 2020-11-07 08:23:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Please if you can donate to this go fund me set up by @kayleighm5297 for the purpose of getting free meals out to kids in Leeds during the holidays!  https://t.co/pTvPrCRgPM
1324845166436491266 2020-11-07 06:44:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Please go show my friend @autisticlyaaron some support on their new blog!
1324841046556217346 2020-11-07 06:28:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I am currently watching this video. Been subscribed to @jessiegender for a while but as soon as I saw a new upload relating to neurodiversity AND star trek, I knew my followers needed it in their life.   Go watch Jessie’s video!
1324830247578144777 2020-11-07 05:45:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> A youtuber I like just uploaded a video about the Cottingly Faeries and my faerie obsessed self is all over it! I found out about the cottingly faeries when I was about 8 but still have my faery obsession at age 24!
1324810327981260802 2020-11-07 04:26:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose He’s not gone yet. I keep looking every few minutes it feels like. How the so called “leaders of the free world” count so slow I’ll never know 🙃
1324762868198318080 2020-11-07 01:17:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The election counting is taking FOREVER!
1324753240785825798 2020-11-07 00:39:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JediNabber Guessing this is to do with the court case with the sun. All very confusing, especially this year. Don’t know how to make head or tail of it!
1324684877732679681 2020-11-06 20:07:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> For my own sanity please only say something to me if you are willing to clarify. Otherwise I spiral and overthink. It’s not fun.
1324683375278493696 2020-11-06 20:01:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell I think Brits and American’s are EQUALLY evil 😂  I joke of course, there are many nuances to both nations. What I will say though is America needs a quicker counting system. The world is waiting!
1324681736828190720 2020-11-06 19:55:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Andrew_S_Hatton Would you mind messaging me about it? No worries if not but I am genuinely curious seeing as you bought it up. I find understanding other people’s views can be very helpful
1324679887307890691 2020-11-06 19:47:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax People don’t realise just dow detrimental their attitudes or behaviours can be to recovery
1324679479302758402 2020-11-06 19:46:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Andrew_S_Hatton Why don’t you like the term binge eating disorder? What would you call it instead?
1324675728852553731 2020-11-06 19:31:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Please only use the term fatphobia if someone is actually being fatphobic. Support people in recovery and stop making them feel shame or enabling disordered eating cycles. 12/12
1324675725836849154 2020-11-06 19:31:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It needs to stop. I am not fatphobic for wanting to improve my diet, my fitness, my weight. I need to be allowed to recover without guilt or criticism. Health for me on my journey to recovery is not fatphobic. The misuse of the term has caused me internal conflict. 11/12
1324675722426880000 2020-11-06 19:31:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> And it allows me to accept that right now I am fat and that I don’t need to feel guilty for that. But the misuse of the term fatphobia by these communities has hindered rather than helped my recovery. Its enabled me to continue disordered eating patterns. 10/12
1324675719541235715 2020-11-06 19:31:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> One person fitting a mould that is different to your own health/wellbeing needs is not fatphobia. I need to be able to recover and share my recovery without fear of being labelled fatphobic. Fat acceptance and body positivity helps me embrace my stretch marks. 9/12
1324675715971899394 2020-11-06 19:31:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It’s not fatphobic. Wanting to change or improve your health is not fatphobic. Exercise and healthy eating is not fatphobic. Weight loss is not synonymous with fatphobia. Every BODY is different, and what is healthy in turn looks/feels different for each person. 8/12
1324675713241387009 2020-11-06 19:31:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> But I don’t think calling people who make health/lifestyle changes, or even calling people who lose weight fatphobic is right. People change their diet and their activity levels for numerous reasons. For someone with BED doing so could be integral to recovery. 7/12
1324675710729003008 2020-11-06 19:31:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I think celebrating everyones unique beauty is amazing. I think doing what you can to be healthy for your body is great. I think accepting and loving parts of your body you were once self conscious about is amazing. 6/12
1324675708057198593 2020-11-06 19:31:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> In my opinion this is misuse of the term fatphobia. The term seems to be popular among fat acceptance, body positivity and health at every size groups/communities. My worry is that these movements are using the term wrongly and inadvertently enabling disordered eating. 5/12
1324675705825841152 2020-11-06 19:31:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> There are people out there who were once obese, who had disordered eating patterns, that worked incredibly hard to improve their relationship with food and to get to a healthy weight and fitness for their body. Yet they get called fatphobic for this. 4/12
1324675702877245443 2020-11-06 19:31:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I guess in a way you could say that the lack of support for people with Binge Eating Disorder occurred because of fatphobia. So I do recognise fatphobia exists. But equally I think the term is sometimes misused, which can be as problematic as fatphobia itself. 3/12
1324675699752554498 2020-11-06 19:31:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> For so long people only thought you had an eating disorder if you were a smaller size. Bigger people were seen as lazy, glutenous or greedy - and often still are seen that way. People tended not to consider wider health issues impacting weight nor link fatness and ED’s. 2/12
1324675692261527553 2020-11-06 19:31:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Fatphobia is a confronting idea to me, I do recognise that some people are mistreated because of their size. But equally I am someone who is fat because of an eating disorder. Binge eating disorder is only now starting to get proper recognition and is still misunderstood. 1/12

1324659572674580480 2020-11-06 18:27:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Manchester Uni need to sort their sh*t out quite frankly. Refund the students, let them go home to study. #SaveOurStudents    https://t.co/xzwcAk95zm
1324658626091536384 2020-11-06 18:23:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Look at this! You lock your students in and leave them in frankly unsafe conditions. Refund your students. Let them go home and study there! #SaveOurStudents    https://t.co/xzwcAk95zm

1324657648734752770 2020-11-06 18:19:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Good on you Manchester Uni students! I would have done the same. Their treatment of you is inhumane. You deserve better. You deserve a refund. You should be allowed to return home and study there! #SaveOurStudents    https://t.co/xzwcAk95zm
1324657037968609282 2020-11-06 18:17:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Manchester University should be ashamed. The treatment of their students is inhumane. Refund your students the FULL price of their rent. Let them go home and study long distance. #SaveOurStudents    https://t.co/xzwcAk95zm
1324624603784859648 2020-11-06 16:08:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Its Friday... and we still don’t know who won 🙃
1324505413195337729 2020-11-06 08:14:33 +0800 <DeviantDCD> GREAT video from @TheAspieWorld. I definitely relate. As someone with a hidden disability I often feel guilt if someone is seemingly struggling more than me. Then I remember it’s called hidden disability for a reason and not all difficulties are obvious.  https://t.co/h3DRMmdCng

1324470922477244419 2020-11-06 05:57:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @4licerose Oh my gosh that sounds so scary! Back at uni people went round setting them off at 2/3am... you can imagine the frights it caused!

Fireworks should only be allowed to be done by professionals in designated areas/events. Not only for the noise, but also for safety reasons

1324458153040355329 2020-11-06 05:06:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell @autisticlyaaron @profamandakirby @DyspraxiaL @eosdyspraxia @harrietkemsley @kaiya_stone Oh wow, that sounds very interesting! I’ll gladly promote it too by sharing about it when its done!
1324457966469369858 2020-11-06 05:06:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell @autisticlyaaron @profamandakirby @DyspraxiaL @eosdyspraxia @harrietkemsley @kaiya_stone Just posted in the women’s group about it so if anyone knows anything they will email you ☺️
1324456822221230080 2020-11-06 05:01:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell @autisticlyaaron @profamandakirby @DyspraxiaL @eosdyspraxia @harrietkemsley @kaiya_stone You must update me about your book, I’ll be very eager to read it!
1324456539038646273 2020-11-06 05:00:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @LauraFMcConnell @profamandakirby @DyspraxiaL @eosdyspraxia @harrietkemsley @kaiya_stone Good idea! Do you have any contact details like an email address? I can share in the dyspraxic women’s facebook group
1324456284108824576 2020-11-06 04:59:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Anyone happen to be #dyspraxic AND a teacher?
1324456092320043009 2020-11-06 04:58:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell @autisticlyaaron @profamandakirby @DyspraxiaL @eosdyspraxia @harrietkemsley @kaiya_stone If you haven’t already @DYSPRAXIAFDTN may know of something in this area or @DyspraxiaUK and @DyspraxicMe. Its a stretch but @exceptional_Ind or @geniuswithinCIC may also have some suggestions. Also @plusvalueuk might have some suggestions.
1324455327589388292 2020-11-06 04:55:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r I can’t believe I forgot to tag you in my reply, you are normally one of the first people I think of... perks of a dyspraxic brain 🙈😅
1324453569190395904 2020-11-06 04:48:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell @profamandakirby @DyspraxiaL @eosdyspraxia @DyspraxicHelp4U @krystalbellax @autisticlyaaron @DyspraxicWomen @DysSingSongMike do you guys know of anything? Or can you retweet to help @LauraFMcConnell? 🙏
1324429507743371265 2020-11-06 03:12:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> My poor cat is not liking this fireworks
1324383929583964165 2020-11-06 00:11:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Happy Guy Fawkes night folks!  https://t.co/d6pgBVRan8
1324383291739414528 2020-11-06 00:09:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Our livestream was definitely a highlight 💪👌💕
1324291030661943307 2020-11-05 18:02:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer I get that, but at least proportional representation would shift the balance a bit. Because right now you can win an election even if your opposing party technically had more individual votes. Only worry is PR would potentially give more power to parties like the brexit party.
1324289155552206849 2020-11-05 17:55:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer Tbh I think proportional representation would be better than first past the post - which to my understanding neither us or the US have
1324284273441034241 2020-11-05 17:35:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Oh wow! I just reached 800 followers. I’m gobsmacked 😱  Thank you all so much for listening to my #dyspraxic voice. It means a lot, especially as a #DyspraxicWomen. Thank you for helping in the plight for #dyspraxia awareness! 💕  https://t.co/4Zm2rgJH0U
1324281608850018304 2020-11-05 17:25:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If this vote happened in the UK we’d know who won by now 😂  Plus side though is that it’s looking more promising than I had initially hoped. Trump might actually loose!
1324161613885329408 2020-11-05 09:28:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kiwi_raa @Shona_Mu @NancyDoylePsych @MoominTheBrave *too should say top. That was a typo on my end!
1324161385102823428 2020-11-05 09:27:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kiwi_raa @Shona_Mu @NancyDoylePsych @MoominTheBrave I don’t think everyone should do it and I agree it won’t work for everyone. But I also think its a misunderstood practice that’s often taught badly by people who have at best learnt of it themselves via a quick too up course. Its a complex discipline that’s been over simplified.
1323948445808447490 2020-11-04 19:21:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just a reminder that there is a #Dyspraxic women’s social tomorrow evening at 7:30pm!   #dyspraxia #DCD #neurodiverse #neurodivergent #neurodiversity #neurodiversesquad #WomenSupportingWomen #women #dyspraxicwomen #feminism #SupportNeurodivergentWomen   @DyspraxicWomen @DH4UWomen
1323934932918566912 2020-11-04 18:27:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Oh god, why is cancel the lockdown trending? I think our country’s education system must have gone down the drain if people think that’s a good idea.
1323930432216420354 2020-11-04 18:09:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you need a distraction from the election, this is Melody ☺️  https://t.co/fq2SYXgC48
1323924106350383106 2020-11-04 17:44:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Too true!
1323923750694363139 2020-11-04 17:43:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MsHafsaQureshi Congratulations! 🌈
1323922691611611138 2020-11-04 17:39:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r @sootmegs I love these Rosemary!
1323922494261256193 2020-11-04 17:38:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Currently Biden is in the lead, but of the states still counting Trump is in the lead in all but one. If Trump wins the states that are still counting he will win. I prey that miraculously he won’t win... but my hopes are not high.
1323918909616066560 2020-11-04 17:23:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I had hoped we’d know who won when I woke up. I guess we don’t. Preying for my friends across the pond!
1323706067986063360 2020-11-04 03:18:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell I don’t want trump to win but considering how we have ended up here in the UK, I think trump will win
1323626618011734016 2020-11-03 22:02:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado I try my best to raise awareness of neurodiversity as a whole and value allyship. My difficulty is currently I reach mostly other ND folk so I need to work harder to reach neurotypical audiences and educate them. I have something in the works but I’m not ready to publicise yet.
1323579800838131713 2020-11-03 18:56:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Sometimes I get sad because there are youtubers I liked as a teen because they helped me accept my sexuality. Hearing from women who like women was affirming. But some of the youtubers are super transphobic now and that makes me sad.
1323574178906255360 2020-11-03 18:34:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Good luck America whichever way you go...
1323573592441978881 2020-11-03 18:31:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MaxineFrances May I ask... what ADHD has to do with that? My brain can’t make the connection
1323569868881432576 2020-11-03 18:17:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @JackDunc1 Exactly Aaron!
1323567160766115840 2020-11-03 18:06:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Round of applause to this tweet. Completely agree with this. I’ve even seen footballers with poppy stickers on them this year. BBC are telling our children that war is ok, but minorities aren’t.
1323427205049966593 2020-11-03 08:50:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> When you’re #dyspraxic but want to be arty 😂  Got to wait for these bad boys to dry before I can paint them. I don’t talk about paganism much on this platform but its a huge part of my life and is the reason I met one of my best friends @chloegray6 who these happen to be for!  https://t.co/AqLBGV4RgT
1323332675155931144 2020-11-03 02:34:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AnneliRoberts For me it was keeping my feet under the blanket in bed 😂
1323309479895715840 2020-11-03 01:02:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Exactly a month until my birthday. Why are they calling this lockdown a month long? It starts on Thursday so that’s three days less than a month long 😅
1323308640611303424 2020-11-03 00:59:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic The reason people like Borris, Farrage and Trump gain power or recognition is because they gamble on people finding them entertaining. It sucks, but it seems we live in a world which cares more about entertainment than human rights.
1323227910933794822 2020-11-02 19:38:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DrRubySapphire Unfortunately I can’t help here but have retweeted in case someone I follow can help. Best wishes to your friend on their PhD journey ☺️
1323226610716286976 2020-11-02 19:33:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @jordanatheresa This was a great video! I shared in in the @DyspraxicWomen facebook group ☺️
1323058718657957890 2020-11-02 08:25:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @moonoveroasis I was similar with a content creator called Azura Dragonfaether. They aren’t conservative thankfully, but their information is just so bad - especially their information around faeries and folklore. They are definitely one to avoid.
1323057874105520141 2020-11-02 08:22:33 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 These things always happen in London 🙃
1323057495938662401 2020-11-02 08:21:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 We’ll have those dumb anti-mask protests like America pretty soon 😬
1323056309575553040 2020-11-02 08:16:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Excuse me while I vomit 🤢  Translation: Bigot party rebranding in an attempt to stay relevant.
1323054954374901760 2020-11-02 08:10:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @moonoveroasis Oh gosh I’ve seen a couple of Stargirl’s videos AGES ago but she came across a bit... floatey if that makes any sense?   I tend to veer more to people like Mandi See, Lunar Wisdom, cutewitch772 (from Pagan Perspective) and Ocean Keltoi these days to name but a few.
1323052992879316993 2020-11-02 08:03:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I think if they came across me now they might feel some guilt. But I’m out of sight and mind for them. I doubt any of them feel remorse and if they do I certainly haven’t had any apologies.
1323049456158334976 2020-11-02 07:49:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AnneliRoberts This was a random selfie I took on one of my rare make up wearing days  https://t.co/QrkjoaOACA
1323047938680041475 2020-11-02 07:43:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @moonoveroasis See now I’m curious who you’ve been watching. Because I watch some spiritual stuff too and have never come across anything conservative. I have come across a lot of misinformation and cultural appropriation (which obvs I’m not keen on) but thankfully no conservatives
1323025989060931585 2020-11-02 06:15:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD>  https://t.co/OwavT5uWCE
1322922936110665728 2020-11-01 23:26:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @suey2y I put yes. I’m 25
1322911522637684742 2020-11-01 22:41:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Its so weird because I’m really insecure about my body, but have always loved my birthmark, even as a child. I liked that nobody else had it, that it made me unique and I loved that it was shaped like a cloud!
1322879186361528320 2020-11-01 20:32:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @Spotify I’m born in 95 so anything in the 2010 - 2020 range is new in my eyes 😂
1322877346492387329 2020-11-01 20:25:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @Spotify Mate a proper throwback needs to be at least 10 years old. 6 years ago is a throwback for the next generation of kids 😂
1322865576457474048 2020-11-01 19:38:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Why is @spotify giving me songs from 2014 in my throwback playlist? 2014 isn’t a throwback...
1322667184007581697 2020-11-01 06:30:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I just found it funny they cut it off halfway through. Seemed like good comeuppance for him being late 😂
1322649606682017792 2020-11-01 05:20:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you can’t watch Repo The Genetic Opera on halloween when can you watch it? XD
1322634645373132804 2020-11-01 04:20:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Samhain blessings folks!  https://t.co/f13I0V3wq8
1322597580384120834 2020-11-01 01:53:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Love how this lockdown is supposed to end dot on my birthday. Will certainly be an interesting one this year 😅
1322201608697073665 2020-10-30 23:40:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Probably the best unintended perk of mask wearing is that men don’t go up to you saying “oi smile” or “smile love”.
1322154502171119617 2020-10-30 20:32:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I am working behind the scenes on some #dyspraxia youtube content. But in the meantime here is a playlist of already existing dyspraxia videos on youtube that I personally think are very good!  https://t.co/JBUfNPDFzV
1322140552507219968 2020-10-30 19:37:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MisterUks I can at least understand a documentary being “semi factual” but this movie honestly seems utterly stupid 😂
1322125362973839362 2020-10-30 18:37:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Maybe don’t release a film about a pandemic in the middle of a real pandemic?
1322120261290856450 2020-10-30 18:16:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Constantly trying to hide how sad/low you feel is draining.
1321929679427817472 2020-10-30 05:39:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U Look after yourself too. As I always say, you cannot fit the universe inside a single human mind. Maintain your boundaries if you need to!
1321845048036777984 2020-10-30 00:03:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Will be keenly watching tonight.
1321819129788190729 2020-10-29 22:20:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron I’m never voting labour again. Greens are where my support lies now. I won’t say any more on the matter because it won’t change what’s happened. I just have to look forward and about any party whose name begins with T or L.
1321817509679501312 2020-10-29 22:13:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scovelljohn I’ve always voted labour to get the torys out. And Corbyn gave me hope for the left. I have never been a member of a party as none are ideal but for so long labour was the best chance to get the tories our. But I just can’t vote for them anymore.
1321815882448932864 2020-10-29 22:07:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you don’t want to vote labour anymore, don’t vote Lib Dem. They are just as bad. Vote green or if you can’t bring yourself to vote green, spoil your ballot.
1321791480953012225 2020-10-29 20:30:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So there’s a study out about #neurodiversity at work. Apparently 1 in 5 employers said they wouldn’t employ a #dyspraxic person and 50% of people said they wouldn’t employ someone from one of the neurominorities. A summary of the study is linked below.    https://t.co/v6VSgNQ3RS
1321781540473446401 2020-10-29 19:50:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutisticGirls_ Interesting that dyspraxia isn’t on there. But I agree re doubling down on awareness
1321778266986991618 2020-10-29 19:37:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Do any other women find it hard to tell if it’s period depression or depression full stop? And do you ever get really depressed on your period then suddenly it’s over and your fine? But then sometimes you aren’t fine after and so you can’t tell if it’s depression or period stuff?
1321745062955569152 2020-10-29 17:25:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDucky @ItsEmilyKaty I know what the personality types thing is, but alas I did the quiz a few years ago and I’m too dyspraxic to remember which one I was 🙈😅
1321736222096695296 2020-10-29 16:50:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDucky @ItsEmilyKaty I’m probably closer to Eyore and Piglet than Tigger. But I do love Tigger!
1321600660882771968 2020-10-29 07:52:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @ItsEmilyKaty What about a full neurodiverse squad as the core characters a bit like how they had all the emotions in the Inside Out film? Now that’s a movie I’d watch ☺️  https://t.co/umpYbbMbzo
1321584797492412420 2020-10-29 06:49:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 I actually had one of the songs stuck in my head earlier today after realising I was going yo be home alone for halloween 😂
1321583379494641668 2020-10-29 06:43:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty Anna is literally me in disney form. Dory is me in fish form 😂  But if I could CHOOSE which character I think I’d go with Moana.
1321524728927014912 2020-10-29 02:50:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Rachel0ates I’m sorry to see what you are going through with this. From where I am standing you did a brilliant job. But I get its hard to have a clear picture when you have people coming at you from all angles. I really hope you are ok. Take a day or so to digest, then come back to things☺️
1321416234005635072 2020-10-28 19:39:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just found out I have an interview for an apprenticeship I applied for! So happy and excited!
1321400562382983169 2020-10-28 18:36:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Rachel0ates Rachel, I hope you are ok. You were completely fair and balanced in your review. You made no judgement on her as a character, you simply critiqued her poetry and gave valid reasons. Don’t take it down, but equally don’t let her or her cronies get to you. You are and did fab 🤗
1321194795327520770 2020-10-28 04:59:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Please do go drop @DysSingSongMike a follow. He does amazing stuff with his music and workouts. An asset to the community 💪
1321145083127861251 2020-10-28 01:41:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Don’t forget to tune into the stream hosted by @krystalbellax at 6pm!  #dyspraxia #Neurodiversity #BlackHistoryMonth
1321006961899524096 2020-10-27 16:32:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Alex_H_Robs @commaficionado I’m half Scottish so hopefully can get citizenship 😂
1320892027517677571 2020-10-27 08:56:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado Because the British public clearly has no collective brain. In many ways I do wish I wasn’t British right now
1320886605960384521 2020-10-27 08:34:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker If capital punishment is the death penalty than no, I don’t agree with it. I’m a pacifist so am most definitely against state sanctioned murder. Weather it’s war or death penalty, I’m not a fan. Would elaborate but there’s not much space on twitter. Hopefully I make sense 😅
1320703493687156738 2020-10-26 20:27:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 13 but I didn’t like half of the ones I tried
1320702590141812736 2020-10-26 20:23:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apparently its a super Canadian thing to say ey at the end of sentences, but I’m British and do this all the time 😂  Also other countries seem to think mate is an Australian thing, but again, as a Brit I assure you mate is a staple in my vocabulary 😂
1320663383805431810 2020-10-26 17:47:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I often delete tweets for this reason. I just tweet about how I’m feeling, usually its a depressed feeling, then I get embarrassed or anxious about how it will be received and delete it.
1320662203180195845 2020-10-26 17:43:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado Because they want to slowly kill the population off until only rich torys are left. Why do you think they voted down free school meals?   Also I wish this was a conspiracy but how the year is going... plus can we expect any less from tories? 😭😅😂
1320492354575454215 2020-10-26 06:28:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer Replace tampon with any sanitary product really the argument still applies. I mainly mentioned tampons partly because the original tweet I saw mentioned tampons and partly due to the character limit. I use period nickers these days as they are reusable ☺️
1320488336004403200 2020-10-26 06:12:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @grumpwitch Exactly and for those that are able to (material/shape/size etc can be an issue for some like you say) there are environmental factors too. Is it compostable or made of organic/recycled material? You could add many more layers to the discussion I’m sure
1320486928207237123 2020-10-26 06:06:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @grumpwitch How many men do you think know the risk of toxic shock syndrome and tampons? My guess is not many. Like you pointed out, there are SO many factors beyond simply the price that need to be factored in.
1320484884582989834 2020-10-26 05:58:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The ‘tampons arent as expensive as women say’ argument is around. My response is, we don’t buy them as a once off. We buy them monthly for on average 40+ years. That adds up especially if you factor hygiene and pain killers. We can’t control our cycle, we should get free supplies
1320398538132590596 2020-10-26 00:15:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Oh how I love Depeche Mode. Also, why is this song so relevant? 😂  PS this is one of my all time favourite songs!   “It's obvious you hate me, though I've done nothing wrong. I've never even met you, so what I could I have done?”   https://t.co/aYtz0CpGyB
1320395377842016257 2020-10-26 00:02:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I am so excited for this stream hosted by @krystalbellax. Her first stream was brilliant and I have no doubt this one will be equally so. If you can’t view it live, you will be able to view it later on the same link ☺️
1320332053074857985 2020-10-25 19:51:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @daviddhannoo Your response sums up my thoughts tbh 😂
1320330375177080832 2020-10-25 19:44:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Tweets about me have now been deleted. But there is an entire podcast episode out there dedicated to myself and a friend blocking said person. All quite bizarre but you can only really laugh in situations like this 😂
1320114810982420481 2020-10-25 05:27:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Beautidivergen2 Considering that women often go unrecognised for ASD/ADHD I probably do have at least some symptoms that have gone ignored. Both do overlap with dyspraxia afterall!
1320082177774804998 2020-10-25 03:18:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @RayeofFunshine Its the uncomfortable dubious tweets that are why I blocked him. Didn’t think he’d notice me sleuth away but that was my mistake 🙈😂
1320066719788969985 2020-10-25 02:16:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @wizardsimulator You can disable retweets in your settings or restrict who can do so. Hope this helps. I tried unretweeting a retweet I did of yours but I think you already deleted it. Sorry
1320022013000536064 2020-10-24 23:19:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U @TheaDysprxc Thanks for making a stand. Your action shows our voices were heard when we did the Dyspraxia In Women stream ☺️
1320015315020009473 2020-10-24 22:52:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @wizardsimulator I find community. I search. I felt like I had none for many years until being bought into the dyspraxic community ☺️
1319997056065437696 2020-10-24 21:39:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Today I’ve been called a spoiled brat who doesn’t like being challenged and a “social justice warrior feminazi”. We’re off to a good start today aren’t we folks 🙃😂
1319994628481945602 2020-10-24 21:30:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 Exactly. Apparently I don’t like being challenged and am a spoiled brat. I think the lady doth protest too much. He has only gone and proven why I blocked him 😂
1319988880133787654 2020-10-24 21:07:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apparently someone I blocked has screenshotted and tagged my profile in attempt to call me out. Breech of privacy much. They were very negative and were nasty to a friend of mine publicly. I didn’t want to see their posts anymore so I blocked them.
1319760139319115786 2020-10-24 05:58:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado I really needed this ☺️
1319747342350897153 2020-10-24 05:07:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutisticPb I care. I just have been on twitter a lot less due to my own mental health. But when I am here and your posts come up, I do care 💕
1319745041187954689 2020-10-24 04:58:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer I thought they were snakes that are just called worms. Turns out they are actually lizards that look like snakes that are called worms 😂
1319744762472239106 2020-10-24 04:57:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutisticPb @ItsEmilyKaty @BBCOne If its not on iplayer its probably on britbox, that new paid service. Worth looking into.
1319742299082002432 2020-10-24 04:47:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Today I learned that slow worms are actually legless lizards. My whole life has been a lie 😂
1319408877356666887 2020-10-23 06:42:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’ve already been blessed with the dark crystal series. Now I find out a series of willow is going to be made. I might be in heaven
1319370947514818570 2020-10-23 04:12:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Ok you CAN still retweet! You press quote tweet first and the top corner says retweet. Thanks to @TinieTinah for letting me know about this. This will save many dyslexic and dyspraxic people a world of trouble.
1319370175251177476 2020-10-23 04:08:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TinieTinah Gonna reply to you to let you know I’m glad you told me. And to test what you just told me, I will try to retweet to spread the word that it still works!
1319368804594581505 2020-10-23 04:03:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Quote tweeting because twitter has a really non neurodivergent friendly update meaning you have no choice but to quote tweet. But I want to share this because I agree. But twitter is now forcing me to write about it rather than simply share the source
1319367840986779649 2020-10-23 03:59:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apparently you HAVE to quote tweet now... bit unfair on ND folk who may struggle typing.
1319367430972624896 2020-10-23 03:58:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So I’ve seen the term allistic used a lot and in context I’ve seen it used to essentially mean neurotypical. But I wasn’t fully sure what was meant by it. Apparently it means not autistic. So it is possible to be neurodivergent and allistic, but not possible to be ND and NT.
1319334181567123456 2020-10-23 01:45:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The minister for children must be the inspiration for one of the witches in that Rhold Dhal book!
1319333714795560966 2020-10-23 01:44:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Thanks to @SarahDyspraxia for making me aware of the fact you can listen to audiobooks or read ebooks for free if you are registered with your local library. Game changer for a dyspraxic dyslexic!
1319219562252992512 2020-10-22 18:10:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty I had someone call me a bad friend because apparently I write “too posh” and that somehow makes them feel inadequate?
1319219279557001216 2020-10-22 18:09:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @lukas8909 If I actually had an income I’d do that but I have zero income right now
1319177159169200129 2020-10-22 15:21:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @chanika @autisticlyaaron @ItsEmilyKaty I do that too. I also put it in weight order so I can put the heaviest items at the bottom of the basket ☺️
1319057812283138049 2020-10-22 07:27:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> My local MP who has frequently voted against LGBT and youth rights voted against free school meals. He has literally voted to allow children to starve and let their health as well as education suffer. Yes, he is a Tory Tosser.
1319035545998282753 2020-10-22 05:59:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> How am I meant to get a job when my computer just keeps crashing or being so slow it takes several minutes for it to process one letter? Whats worse is I can’t even afford a new computer or laptop 🙃
1318973120397586433 2020-10-22 01:51:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I do!
1318972932572520448 2020-10-22 01:50:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Rossrubicon Neither 😂
1318971734943584259 2020-10-22 01:45:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @autisticlyaaron @ItsEmilyKaty I used to struggle but I wrote lists when I was at uni and would cook/freeze meals in bulk so I could reheat them throughout the week. Eventually my brain remembered where everything I needed was in the shop which made it easier. Having a list was key. I’d plan my meals weekly.
1318954812898160640 2020-10-22 00:38:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> #Dyspraxic people you should check out that have had a positive impact on me and the wider community this year. Go send them some love! 💕 @SarahDyspraxia  @rosiemay_r  @DyspraxicHelp4U  @DysSingSongMike  @kayleighm5297  @JillyBec  @EmilyyNics  @autisticlyaaron  @krystalbellax
1318929937294893058 2020-10-21 22:59:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Why are the Kit Kat Santa’s nicer than normal Kit Kat’s though? More chocolate might be my answer 😂
1318898410716528641 2020-10-21 20:54:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The fact that the google news app doesn’t show searches in date order is very frustrating!
1318871292838318080 2020-10-21 19:06:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Yah know what would be interesting and a cool way to teach kids about elections? If every few years they did an election to vote which teacher in the school was the head teacher.
1318862247419170818 2020-10-21 18:30:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> There has been a lot of turbulence behind the scenes in the dyspraxic community which has gotten me down. I haven’t looked at the dyspraxia tag since awareness week as a result. The fallout from the turbulence is ongoing but thankfully the dust is slowly starting to settle.
1318848895712153600 2020-10-21 17:37:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Replace the word quirky with ditzy and you are telling the story of dyspraxic women too!
1318827537812934657 2020-10-21 16:12:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutisticGirls_ @ADDYSASC Yup! With dyspraxia the clumsyness and forgetfulness can be brushed off. Struggling in school? She’s just a bit ditzy. Spill another drink? Oh how cute, she’s so ditzy. Our struggles get brushed off and sadly the NHS don’t provide adult diagnosis leaving many women in the lurch.
1318647041078272003 2020-10-21 04:15:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 Thank you so much!
1318644251857739776 2020-10-21 04:04:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 I keep seeing people post about this summit but when I click the hashtag I can’t find where to view it myself. Do you mind telling me which organisation has organised it so I can find and watch it myself? ☺️
1318639799423684614 2020-10-21 03:46:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I second the thoughts of @krystalbellax regarding the @DYSPRAXIAFDTN event and look forward to her event too.   I had the honour of taking part in her Dyspraxia In Women stream earlier in the month which was a great success. I have no doubt this event will be in good hands!
1318599442862428170 2020-10-21 01:06:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics Thank you 💕
1318572674696810497 2020-10-20 23:19:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @eliistender10 Everyone gets free pizza
1318565075448483841 2020-10-20 22:49:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Definitely get in touch with PALS (patient liaison and advise service). They will be able to help you and maybe get the ball rolling quicker or help chase up or make a formal complaint.
1318553089771737089 2020-10-20 22:02:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Totally agree! We need to take action when it comes to autistic girls &amp; start researching other diagnosis. Despite the underdiagnosis of dyspraxic women research isn’t there. Let’s take positive action for autistic girls and get the ball rolling with research for dyspraxic girls.
1318551915546935303 2020-10-20 21:57:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DearMrAtheist I am answering based on who I think will win as an outsider in the UK. I don’t want Trump to win, but having seen how recent votes in my own country turned out, I think that sadly he will win.
1318500649772978176 2020-10-20 18:33:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Sign the damn petition folks  https://t.co/2e4ykx7cRR
1318498197749288960 2020-10-20 18:24:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc There are plenty of famous bald men that break this stereotype. Especially in action movies or the fitness industry. I think baldness is a worry because there are industries out there which make money out of people’s insecurities. Change is happening, its just a slow process
1318250792940457989 2020-10-20 02:00:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 @thefutureisnd I agree. Not to mention the fact that using the two words interchangeably disregards the huge swathes of neurodivergent people who are not autistic. How can we expect neurotypical people to understand neurodiversity when they are only being shown one part of it? Baffling.
1318249794796748801 2020-10-20 01:56:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I can’t believe it took me 8 hours to do two applications. Thus is the life of a dyspraxic-dyslexic 🙈😅😂
1318249542320611330 2020-10-20 01:55:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This event is TOMORROW. Click the link for more information and to register!
1318217469027287040 2020-10-19 23:48:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I like that the government apprenticeship website includes learning difficulties on the application form. A lot of places don’t ask about learning difficulties so that’s promising ☺️
1317863194950619136 2020-10-19 00:20:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It’s all very well me tweeting away but I want to properly educate myself on stuff. I think I will read things and do live-streams sometimes to discuss what’s I’ve been reading.
1317829494539980805 2020-10-18 22:06:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I cannot put into words how excited I am for this event. It is really promising to see that a wider range of #dyspraxic experiences and voices are beginning to be listened to and represented. I hope this is a good sign of things to come!
1317754888475082752 2020-10-18 17:10:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Apologies if I am tweeting or responding less. I’m not on a social media break, but I am on a social media relax I guess. In the sense that while I sort a couple of things out offline, I’m just going online when I really feel like it. I hope everyone is well!
1317754297896022016 2020-10-18 17:08:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scovelljohn @QLMentoring @Jamie_Margolin I’ll take a look! Thanks ☺️
1317096654550503424 2020-10-16 21:34:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax @fitbit I know my one I needed to install an app to make it work but mine might have been a different company not sure
1317092547316092928 2020-10-16 21:18:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I much prefer text conversations for this reason
1316814266859749376 2020-10-16 02:52:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas See what I’ve seen of sororities doesn’t remind me much of school houses, but I can see parallels with the Bullingdon club now that you mention it!
1316775845399326724 2020-10-16 00:20:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Discounting the importance of audiobooks is quite frankly abelist. Audiobooks are a gift that enable disabled children and adults to learn, get educated and of course unlock their imagination.
1316773509553704960 2020-10-16 00:10:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @reesytime Oh man I needed this laugh!

1316708740054355969 2020-10-15 19:53:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Can anyone help @krystalbellax and spread the word? She did an amazing job on the Dyspraxia In Women livestream earlier this month and is now trying to conduct a panel for a #BlackHistoryMonth livestream. If you want to take part please get in touch and do RT to spread the word!
1316708003509399553 2020-10-15 19:50:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> One thing about American unis that I will never understand is sororities. I genuinely don’t get why they are a thing 😂

1316661524728078336 2020-10-15 16:45:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rustic_clutter @GloriaSteinem That is a very good quote! And thanks for the recommendations ☺️
1316553113881448452 2020-10-15 09:34:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc Never said you were but I like to clarify things when people retweet just in case people misinterpret what I say. Could be my overly cautious nature, but don’t worry, I didn’t think you were putting words in my mouth
1316548376712880129 2020-10-15 09:16:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc Just to clarify, my key point is that when talking about something thats autism specific the term neurodiversity shouldn’t be used. While related the terms aren’t interchangable. We need to make it clear when we are discussing neurodiversity as a collective vs specific diagnosis
1316533359376502789 2020-10-15 08:16:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As someone who isn’t #ActuallyAutistic but is part of the #NeurodiverseSquad, it’s sometimes frustrating when people use the words #neurodiversity and #autism interchangeably. It can make it harder to educate #neurotypical folk on what neurodiversity actually is. #dyspraxia #DCD
1316531277596635137 2020-10-15 08:08:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Reading things like this always makes my day. Go drop @QueerlyAutistic a follow if you aren’t already!
1316530646081306624 2020-10-15 08:05:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado Genuinely surprised there isn’t more non autistic people at the point I’m voting right now. But I imagine similar to dyspraxia and other forms of neurodiversity - it’s hard to get people who don’t share your diagnosis to care let alone understand.
1316483511986065410 2020-10-15 04:58:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Is it possible to be a feminist and also support men’s rights? Yes.
1316472561400770561 2020-10-15 04:14:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m not the most social person but not being able to see friends, especially those that live in different parts of the country, it’s getting to me
1316334013318131712 2020-10-14 19:04:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Very important event that you can’t afford to miss. Click the link below to register!   #dyspraxia #dyspraxic #DCD #neurodiverse #neurodivergent #neurodiversity #neurodiversesquad #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistoryMonthUK
1316105811035291648 2020-10-14 03:57:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This was the year I was going to fix my life. The universe had other ideas.
1316076730768031744 2020-10-14 02:01:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JakeHobson_ Thanks!
1316059681010470912 2020-10-14 00:54:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Tbh I am sure that because I am larger people didn’t pick up on my eating disorder. They thought instead that I was greedy or lazy. BED has only recently starting getting more awareness and yet still rather than recognise our illness, people make assumptions about our character.
1316057541655265281 2020-10-14 00:45:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JakeHobson_ Just clarifying because I’m dyslexic and dyspraxic - it’s pronounced like woman but with an x on the end?   I can understand why it’s used for sure I’m just trying to properly sus it out. I’ve seen it used but never seen the spelling addressed directly, that’s why I’m curious.
1316055886016770055 2020-10-14 00:39:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JakeHobson_ Ok I can definitely get on board with it being inclusive to trans/NB folks. Though regarding moving away from patriarch, while other women might not feel the same I personally don’t mind the word having an a/e. I’m assuming it’s still pronounced the same?
1316053137195757569 2020-10-14 00:28:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Genuine question as I have seen this about and don’t know the reason. Basically I have seen some people spelling women/woman as womxn instead - I’m just wondering why this is? I don’t think it’s a typo as I have seen it often and some groups/orgs have been using this spelling too
1316039723731824640 2020-10-13 23:34:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics I’m doing great thanks! Hope you are doing good too ☺️  Yes the weather has been a bit grim but it’s gotten sunny here into the afternoon which is good ☺️
1316037270688985091 2020-10-13 23:25:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @EmilyyNics Yes it was and really good fun too. It was nice to read back through the live chat afterwards too!
1316036734002528256 2020-10-13 23:23:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you missed the #dyspraxia in women livestream last week, you can stream it now from @krystalbellax YouTube channel!

1315945685963943936 2020-10-13 17:21:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc Can you give me an example of the kind of thing you are referring to?
1315915867243380742 2020-10-13 15:22:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc I don’t think one gender has it worse than another. We all have our trials and tribulations. But there are things in life that each gender experiences differently. There are things on either end that may benefit one over the other - we need to look at how to make it benefit both.
1315754828673490954 2020-10-13 04:42:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty You absolutely do deserve the followers you have. You are super sweet, super passionate and you help spread info on important topics. You do great stuff with your platform! ☺️
1315653046244962306 2020-10-12 21:58:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @HMourland Great job!
1315611034577776642 2020-10-12 19:11:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ChallengingPod @DyspraxicHelp4U may have some insight or advice in this area
1315608939761991680 2020-10-12 19:03:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty Looks like they have a nice garden to play in at least
1315605890934943745 2020-10-12 18:51:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc Your lived experiences alone offer valuable insight into the world of dyspraxia. My advice, don’t wait for others to come to you - put yourself out there. Yes some people won’t be interested, but some will and the more you reach that way, the more awareness you can raise ☺️
1315583993706958848 2020-10-12 17:24:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The letter writer is rude, discriminatory and also operating on backwards mindset. Said Locum Consultant Psychiatrist needs to be retrained in disability and neurodiversity. Also @mwjsimpson should get in touch with PALS (patient liaison and advice service) about this. 2/2
1315583990988972032 2020-10-12 17:24:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This kind of thing is exactly why we need the social model of disability. The social model is not there to ignore the science and medical side of our biology - rather it is there to ensure that a person’s lived experiences are given equal weight and respect. 1/2
1315562391355232256 2020-10-12 15:58:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> On top of improving my maths, I’m going to apply for teaching assistant and early years apprenticeships. This will get me experience working with kids, a small income as well as (hopefully) regular class time getting a feel for the role. Volunteering is unlikely during covid.
1315424616345726981 2020-10-12 06:50:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Am I excited for the new season of Star Trek Discovery to begin on Friday?  https://t.co/90lQtQxiIY
1315315082369277957 2020-10-11 23:35:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scovelljohn Exactly. If it wasn’t for the test I would have applied and been doing it this year
1315314360898723840 2020-10-11 23:32:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scovelljohn Well thing is to be allowed onto teacher training regardless of what you are teaching you have to go through the skills test
1315314155482689540 2020-10-11 23:31:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kayleighm5297 Thing is I literally can only really do plus, minus, divide and times. Anything else I can’t do it’s all gone from my brain. So I know I will fail
1315306454333771780 2020-10-11 23:01:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Time for operation learn maths so I can actually apply for teacher training. Apparently even if you have your GCSE you have to do a skills test. It’s been 8 years since I did maths and I only scraped a C. If I don’t practice, I won’t pass the skills test and won’t be allowed on.
1315294828427710465 2020-10-11 22:14:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ItsEmilyKaty My brother (lives in another city) had a covid test a while back and it took about 3 days to hear back
1315043279222829061 2020-10-11 05:35:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc Apparently so
1315043200134938627 2020-10-11 05:35:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Some really exciting #dyspraxia related projects happening behind the scenes. Stay posted for announcements later this year and also in the new year. Some personal stuff, some collaborations. But all promising and positive! #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek
1314519920374419456 2020-10-09 18:55:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r Too darn sweet
1314504814118735873 2020-10-09 17:55:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I highly recommend anyone with an invisible disability get in touch with @krystalbellax regarding her next livestream. I had such a lovely time in her dyspraxia in women stream. Great opportunity to use your voice and share your story!
1314490199741693952 2020-10-09 16:57:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> You know whats annoying about BED? If you open up about it its so clear its a misunderstood ED. People come out with the “oh I do x” or “oh have you tried y” with zero understanding as to how it works nor what is actually recommended for those in recovery.
1314123198531854338 2020-10-08 16:39:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I‘ll continue to do what I do, but I feel pressured to perform this week just because I’m #dyspraxic. But to me this week should be about non-dyspraxics also taking the flame. So many dyspraxic people I know are getting burn out. We need your help in our plight for awareness. 3/3
1314123196782837762 2020-10-08 16:39:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> It feels like many only care about #dyspraxia during awareness week. Even then, as a #dyspraxic person it feels like we have to shout even louder just to get our voices heard. With so many other causes having awareness events right now - dyspraxia feels like a second thought. 2/3
1314123193871892480 2020-10-08 16:39:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> For me #dyspraxia awareness is everyday. I tweet, reply to tweets, retweet, write blogs, share resources and help run groups. I am constantly finding ways I can raise awareness beyond #dyspraxic people. I gave the first part of #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek my all, but I’m tired. 1/3
1313796337750679552 2020-10-07 19:00:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Can anyone help @AccessPlymouth out? They are having difficulty accessing facebook. They provide transport and mobility solutions for elderly and disabled people. So having access to facebook important so they can reach clients/customers/service users!
1313516971464503298 2020-10-07 00:30:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> 6pm Women In Dyspraxia live event!

1313479869813194760 2020-10-06 22:02:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So excited for this! Time to get my glam on ready for tonight 💪
1313477150624886786 2020-10-06 21:52:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SallyBourliakas @DH4UWomen @krystalbellax @DyspraxicWomen Here yah go ☺️  https://t.co/QhWQeysze5
1313476932403683329 2020-10-06 21:51:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So, yes #dyspraxia is a big focus for me. But did you know I also write music? You can listen to my songs on soundcloud ☺️  https://t.co/7SsEo1s70P
1313474027101487108 2020-10-06 21:39:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Which do you prefer?
1313457370283024385 2020-10-06 20:33:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @bodyrevivemanc @icerowe I usually say I’m dyspraxic to emphasise the word as many don’t know it. Sometimes I’ll say I have dyspraxia. I tend to avoid person with language as dyspraxia and me are so intertwined that to separate it would be like separating part of myself!
1313455880642363392 2020-10-06 20:27:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @icerowe Brilliant news!
1313451624623472646 2020-10-06 20:10:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Too true! Thanks for speaking on these hard truths @krystalbellax!
1313268749638791168 2020-10-06 08:04:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So proud to be helping Billy @DyspraxicHelp4U extend his platform with a new page dedicated to dyspraxic women! Brownie points to anyone who can guess why we chose the logo colours! #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek #dyspraxia #dyspraxic #DCD #neurodiversity #Neurodivergent
1313235694031179777 2020-10-06 05:52:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JakeHobson_ Even better!  https://t.co/mDkH8PrH6G
1313234546561777664 2020-10-06 05:48:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So excited for this event hosted by @DYSPRAXIAFDTN! We so desperately need more intersectional #dyspraxia events and this event is a good step in the right direction  https://t.co/Iq58vkdcEZ #dyspraxic #DCD #neurodiversity #neurodiversesquad #BlackHistoryMonth
1313230958750060546 2020-10-06 05:33:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @JakeHobson_ Great stuff, I look forward to this. So great to finally see some intersectional dyspraxia events arising! 💪
1313230733788545026 2020-10-06 05:33:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Brilliant! Intersectionality is key!   #dyspraxia #dyspraxic #DCD #DiscoveringDyspraxia #dyspraxiaawareness #dyspraxicadults #dyspraxicwomen #DYSPR #neurodiversity #neurodiversesquad #neurodivergent #neurodiverse #intersectionality #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek #BlackHistoryMonth
1313147782958645250 2020-10-06 00:03:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Walks... great to fight depression... AND anger. Honestly when things rile me up its the healthiest way I have to calm down.
1313052045860048896 2020-10-05 17:42:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @HMourland Remember there are different forms. You have fine and gross motor. Fine is smaller delicate things like holding a cup, eyeliner, handwriting etc. Gross is bigger like walking, cycling, swimming. Balance and spacial awareness comes into it too
1313043722309971968 2020-10-05 17:09:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> On the bisexual front, Daryl off Craxy Ex Girlfriend. On the dyspraxia front, Ryan off Doctor Who.
1312904821968699393 2020-10-05 07:57:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Very prominent thread from Billy @DyspraxicHelp4U. Intersectionality is vital when it comes to #dyspraxia awareness. Dyspraxic women have gone ignored for far too long. But thanks to amazing dyspraxic women and the support of folk like Billy, the narrative is starting to shift!
1312887860702384129 2020-10-05 06:50:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Dreading the amount of dyslexia posts that will flood the #dyspraxia tag tomorrow. Our awareness weeks really should be separate. Its a travesty that this has been allowed to happen considering we still get asked “don’t you mean dyslexia” 🙃
1312873532074987520 2020-10-05 05:53:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Looks like heaven 😍
1312871585276198912 2020-10-05 05:45:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scar_sherriff @MaxineFrances @TumiSotire @DyspraxiaAPPG @DyspraxicHelp4U Thanks for your support 💗
1312836731964665857 2020-10-05 03:27:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> While I’m glad it’s #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek, mentally I’m not feeling so chipper. I will continue to tweet about #dyspraxia week long, but know it takes a lot of energy. I give 100% to #dyspraxia awareness every single day. This week I have to give it 1000% but my energy is low.
1312777400044998657 2020-10-04 23:31:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutiLeven @ADHDeeds @nickyot4kidsdcd @HMourland @emkburke @MissMcHale1 @ADHFemale @LauraFMcConnell @agvbergin @barisanhantu Thank you for saying and recognising this. It does not go unrecognised or unappreciated!
1312776164197498880 2020-10-04 23:26:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Did you know I run a group for LGBTQIA+ #dyspraxic people? You can join via the link  https://t.co/mlnxfu2sJk #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek  https://t.co/Sy1s5lgY6M
1312773434955489281 2020-10-04 23:15:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AdultingADHD @QueerlyAutistic I was lucky to be diagnosed at uni. Many are not so lucky and its one of the many reasons I do what I do!
1312773234845200386 2020-10-04 23:15:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Because of this many dyspraxic advocates or activists are self diagnosed and the majority of dyspraxia groups accept those who are self diagnosed due to how poor awareness, funding and support is. Heck even the research is poor, often outdated and white make centric. 2/2
1312772804992020481 2020-10-04 23:13:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Sadly in the UK diagnosis for adults is not funded by the NHS and finding or funding a private diagnosis is often referred to as a bit of a wild west! Many dyspraxic adults are either diagnosed at uni or self diagnosed. Those who were diagnosed young are a lucky few. 1/2

1312768351953924101 2020-10-04 22:55:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Would be great to get #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek trending. I wonder if @bbcdoctorwho can help us out with their awesome #dyspraxic character Ryan?   Dyspraxia Awareness Week runs from October 4th to October 10th ☺️
1312737030137405447 2020-10-04 20:51:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @agvbergin @AutiLeven @ADHDeeds @nickyot4kidsdcd @HMourland @emkburke @ADHFemale @LauraFMcConnell @barisanhantu Please don’t be scared to join @DyspraxicWomen as mentioned before - we recognise barriers to diagnosis and therefore welcome self diagnosed folk.
1312736540871798784 2020-10-04 20:49:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @agvbergin @AutiLeven @ADHDeeds @nickyot4kidsdcd @HMourland @emkburke @MissMcHale1 @ADHFemale @LauraFMcConnell @barisanhantu Sadly that is all too common. @DyspraxicWomen and @DyspraxicCircle welcome self diagnosed folk so you are welcome to join if you think you are dyspraxic and want to learn more ☺️
1312724631296585728 2020-10-04 20:01:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LauraFMcConnell @AutiLeven @ADHDeeds @nickyot4kidsdcd @HMourland @emkburke @MissMcHale1 @ADHFemale @agvbergin @barisanhantu You are welcome to join the @DyspraxicWomen group if you suspect you are dyspraxic. We recognise barriers to diagnosis so don’t discriminate self diagnosed folk on that basis. Diagnosed or self diagnosed are both welcome ☺️
1312721431814434816 2020-10-04 19:49:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @barisanhantu @AutiLeven @ADHDeeds @nickyot4kidsdcd @HMourland @emkburke @MissMcHale1 @ADHFemale @LauraFMcConnell @agvbergin I can appreciate that. I just wanted to thank some of the non-dyspraxics that have engaged the most as I think allyship is so important and I want to and try to do what I can to help get the message out on other things too. And in all honesty people wanting to learn means a lot!

1312705375418933249 2020-10-04 18:45:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This 👇 so true! We need to stop undermining people’s lived experiences.

1312701148902633473 2020-10-04 18:28:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Really important thread by @krystalbellax here. I try my best to make it clear what is opinion or not and always add sources of info in my blogs. But in terms of hard research on #dyspraxia it is lacking and what is there is hardly in line with the diverse part of #neurodiversity
1312685512461815808 2020-10-04 17:26:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Non #dyspraxic (as far as I am aware!) allies I‘d like to thank this #DyspraxiaAwarenessWeek for their support over the year include: @AutiLeven @ADHDeeds @nickyot4kidsdcd @HMourland @emkburke @MissMcHale1 @ADHFemale @LauraFMcConnell @agvbergin @barisanhantu  Thank you!

But yes people generally are undiagnosed because the NHS don’t fund adult diagnosis and awareness is poor generally. Heck the indicators for many are so strong, but we fall through

1312559324926038017 2020-10-04 09:05:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TheaDysprxc Between our group of women doing the livestream next week, we have had comments and replies in the various places the stream has been discussed - in fact there is one on the livestream itself. I’ve also as of today had hostile dm’s around it. Sadly its a real problem.
1312542956843413505 2020-10-04 08:00:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hear hear!
1312518549517213704 2020-10-04 06:23:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Corvid189592286 Most of the dyspraxic people I know are men. I think if it weren’t for the women’s group I run I’d only know men. In fairness the only dyspraxics I know full stop are online in everyday life I know none
1312491235525836802 2020-10-04 04:34:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Corvid189592286 It’s been in replies to some of the posts by women organising the stream. And even one on the stream itself even though it’s not happened yet
1312413058497753088 2020-10-03 23:23:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The more backlash #dyspraxic women get from dyspraxic men - the more I realise that this is WHY we, dyspraxic women, do what we do. I’m collaborating on a dyspraxic women’s livestream next week and we’ve already had too many “what about men” style comments 🙃
1312401063291564032 2020-10-03 22:36:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Exciting news from my friends and supporters @DyspraxicCircle/@ComplicatedPete and @DyspraxicHelp4U at 4pm today! Go and follow them so you don’t miss out. Great stuff ahead for awareness week too! 💪
1312398274956013571 2020-10-03 22:25:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This 👇 is a mood my dudes.   We desperately need more awareness of dyspraxia and an intersectional approach is vital if we are to resolve the under diagnosis of women and minorities.
1312379258073829377 2020-10-03 21:09:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @NDNeuroNews @ComplicatedPete @DyspraxicHelp4U @DyspraxicWomen The above is a project I look forward to seeing, but it is one I am not involved in.
1312357075364831236 2020-10-03 19:41:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Thank you so much for the support @scovelljohn you are an asset to the dyspraxic community 💪
1312317921167900673 2020-10-03 17:05:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> “I wish men could love, not kill me inside” - probably one of my favourite lyrics I’ve written.

1311975971428413440 2020-10-02 18:27:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax If I was back at uni I’d be fine on the phone but the gp practice down here have really not been great to me at all especially the doctor. But there is no other medical group in my area leaving me no choice but that practice.
1311974263155503104 2020-10-02 18:20:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Thing is you can’t register via email you either have to use an online form or a phone call and I just don’t feel comfortable doing that
1311954885823336449 2020-10-02 17:03:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Do you think aliens when we talk about how rubbish The Sun newspaper is and say “fuck The Sun” think that we actually hate our bright old star in the sky? 😂
1311953644779175936 2020-10-02 16:58:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Mulan, the cartoon one.
1311953243648471040 2020-10-02 16:56:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Yeah I know that but I don’t want to do it over the phone so can’t really register. I prefer in person as I can see they have listened, understood and done what I asked. Any chance of getting that doctor is too big a chance for me
1311813662756286471 2020-10-02 07:42:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax My gp practice assign you a specific gp. He wouldn’t believe I went to casualty because the notes hadn’t transferred and he shouted at me for “wasting nhs time” causing a panic attack. It’s really hard to trust doctors now.
1311773880596533256 2020-10-02 05:03:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Delly1927 @DyspraxicBee @DyspraxicWomen @DyspraxicHelp4U @Dyspraxialife Retweeted but can’t answer myself as I don’t drive
1311761009145786372 2020-10-02 04:12:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I haven’t registered with my local doctors since leaving uni because I want to do it in person to make sure they don’t assign me the horrible doctor. But I have a back ache thats worrying me. But I’m too scared to go partly because of him, partly because of covid.
1311682846868803584 2020-10-01 23:02:15 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Corvid189592286 Oh god don’t get me started 🙃😂
1311652554472914944 2020-10-01 21:01:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @HowNowSmileySow It makes you kind of feel like why bother when the person who is meant to represent me won’t listen yah know?
1311650427394547712 2020-10-01 20:53:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Update: I don’t get triggered easily, but what provoked this post upset me beyond belief. I’ve had to block the person because seeing that kind of thing when scrolling through the #dyspraxia is too upsetting and personal. I’d prefer to block them then get into a public debate.
1311649554928939015 2020-10-01 20:49:57 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @beatED @NDNeuroNews @CaraLisette @sainsburys I’d add that things like fasting or heavy restricting can lead to things like BED which I struggle with. Yet articles like this normalise the exact patterns that lead to binges. And as a woman particularly as a teen and going into my 20’s these articles have been/are everywhere!
1311648597159673859 2020-10-01 20:46:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Its sad when causes ask me to email my MP. I know my MP is useless and dismissive with a terrible voting record. He makes it clear in his voting record he’s not ok with LGBT+ people and has voted against youth rights too. His response to my BLM email was shite. I don’t trust him.
1311601556681351168 2020-10-01 17:39:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Exams are THE WORST thing for dyspraxics. Because it doesn’t impact intelligence, but it does impact memory. And this makes us even more stressed and have to work even harder to remember exams. More work, lower grades, living life thinking we are dumb because of some paper.
1311600067497938944 2020-10-01 17:33:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Corvid189592286 I empathise &amp; there is probably societal shizz at bay. But if parents neglect one child to look after the disabled child then blames the disabled child, thats problematic. I queried a parent on this &amp; the response can be summed as ‘folk like you make life harder for folk like me’
1311453316614938625 2020-10-01 07:50:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AutismTalkAspie @peta @PETAUK The only possible logic I can see is that they are trying to coax antivax mums into going vegan. Going vegan isn’t bad but if you do it for antivax logic and shitting on autism then that’s not cool
1311452442882605056 2020-10-01 07:46:42 +0800 <DeviantDCD> God damn it can pms not be a thing please 😂  I’m happy crying every five seconds 🤣
1311447753357172736 2020-10-01 07:28:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Fam I’m proud of you. You’ll rock it!
1311430229584498690 2020-10-01 06:18:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> In my experience if a parent implies their disabled child is at fault for their non disabled siblings issues - the parent isn’t willing to self reflect and instead deflects their own faults onto their disabled child. But if you call anyone out for this they will just take offence
1311408666260779015 2020-10-01 04:52:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Am I an introvert... that gets a buzz off socialising? 🤔🤔🤔
1311353266031202304 2020-10-01 01:12:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Time is ticking. Would be amazing if @novaramedia or @AyoCaesar could cover this. We need #JusticeForOsimeBrown  https://t.co/cBVwFiJj4Y

1311234055741075456 2020-09-30 17:18:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So glad we have a museum back in Plymouth. Was so sad when the old one closed, the building was lovely too. But very happy this new one is here, though maybe not so happy about the timing given, yah know, covid 🙈😅
1311231034168664064 2020-09-30 17:06:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah Oh my gosh thats so bad! For starters nursing is a job open to all regardless of gender. Secondly the way you walk shouldn’t have any baring on your patient care. If I remember correct you are dyspraxic right? Did you know back then? If so your mentor was very abelist!
1311230406725906434 2020-09-30 17:04:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @YWTrust I did go through the work it out coaching a few years ago but was under the impression that once you’d used up your sessions you couldn’t go through a second time. I was also on the advisory panel too (Chloe Alice) and pre-covid would occasionally still volunteer at events ☺️
1311228894796828674 2020-09-30 16:58:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDeeds I agree!
1311082189468110849 2020-09-30 07:15:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> When I started my pagan path I felt left out/like the odd ball because I felt more connected to masculine deities than I did feminine ones. Lots of pagans seem anti-male and I never vibed with that. Also... why is divinity seen as male vs female? Where’s the in between my dudes?
1311080943663407105 2020-09-30 07:10:30 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I know a few journo’s follow me. I see you. Some of you are even dyspraxic or ND. Do get in touch with Billy, he does some amazing work when it comes to dyspraxia awareness!
1311079657354268674 2020-09-30 07:05:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U I agree it’s great! We’ll have to do something together soon 💪
1311074292856238085 2020-09-30 06:44:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> An event you won’t want to miss! We are doing a panel discussion on Tuesday 6th at 6pm for awareness week. The topic? Dyspraxia In Women of course! 💪  #dyspraxia #dyspraxic #DCD #Neurodiversity #neurodiverse #NeurodiverseSquad #SupportNeurodivergentWomen #WomenSupportingWomen
1311055031035211781 2020-09-30 05:27:32 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @bodyrevivemanc Yes! I watch old cartoons like Mulan or Lion King with the Spanish dub ☺️
1311017671593463810 2020-09-30 02:59:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Very honoured and excited to be taking part in this livestream to talk about #dyspraxic women! Tuesday at 6pm, save the date!  https://t.co/QhWQeysze5 @krystalbellax @kayleighm5297 @ballinskelligs2 @SarahDyspraxia
1311001438617776128 2020-09-30 01:54:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @R_RSantamaria That’s great! Which app do you use? ☺️
1311001298687451136 2020-09-30 01:54:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @jus_de_citron05 @edpsych4kids I agree that this is a worry as we already have this happening even here in the UK where dyspraxia is used as a term!
1310983705045938177 2020-09-30 00:44:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHDeeds I’m doing better than I thought considering I’ve only been doing it 20 days! I’m determined 💪
1310981620686565377 2020-09-30 00:35:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Decided if I succeed in completing every Spanish lesson on duolingo I will do a Spanish GCSE or A-level
1310979626722897920 2020-09-30 00:27:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @gwarleycummings There is a whole community of us out there. Check out @DyspraxicWomen @DyspraxicCircle they run regular dyspraxia events ☺️
1310959528180097025 2020-09-29 23:08:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Honestly it’s really depressing and disheartening. I’m still struggling to find work and losing hope by the day. I haven’t signed on for job seekers yet because I had some left overs from my student loan but it’s running out fast and still no job. I feel useless and stuck.
1310905910265511936 2020-09-29 19:34:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ThisIsJordanKay I’m sorry to hear that. You have a dyspraxic ally nere if you ever need a friendly ear or to vent ☺️
1310905579838283777 2020-09-29 19:33:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @jus_de_citron05 @edpsych4kids The only reason I use the DCD hashtag is because I know in countries like America dyspraxia isn’t actually a recognised diagnosis! And I believe Australia have swapped to DCD over dyspraxia now too 🙃
1310902059571519488 2020-09-29 19:19:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @jus_de_citron05 Exactly!
1310899860518965248 2020-09-29 19:10:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Me &amp; @krystalbellax @kayleighm5297 @SarahDyspraxia @ballinskelligs2 are planning a panel discussion around dyspraxia and women. We realise that so far our panel is all white. As such, if you are a non-white dyspraxic woman interested in being on our panel, please get in touch!  https://t.co/soZ4TTaYwn
1310899125337063426 2020-09-29 19:08:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This is way too familiar!
1310898944545820673 2020-09-29 19:07:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver @scovelljohn @Dyspraxialife @EmilyyNics Yeah my dad works for the NHS too something to do with community mental health. First there were the cuts, then the NHS subcontracted private companies who care more about profits than service so again more cuts. Lots of business and admin staff, less actual service delivery!
1310895200005509121 2020-09-29 18:52:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver @scovelljohn @Dyspraxialife @EmilyyNics If I could afford private healthcare I probably wouldn’t have or would have recovered from, my eating disorder. And it sucks because the NHS is a good thing that the government are burning to the ground leaving vulnerable people at risk.

1310875976964943873 2020-09-29 17:36:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @GRMindMatters Just want to ket you know that in the UK #dyspraxia isn not classed as a learning disability, rather, a learning difficulty. This link explains it well but Mental Health Foundation &amp; Mencap have similar info  https://t.co/BkN6Fi4FxV
1310875181452328960 2020-09-29 17:32:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So apparently #Dyspraxia Awareness Week, #Dyslexia Awareness Week, #ADHD Month, Learning Disabilities Awareness Month, #BlackHistoryMonth and apparently a mental health thing - all occurring at the same time. Each deserves its own attention/time. We’ve all been screwed over here.
1310872155702398976 2020-09-29 17:20:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scovelljohn @Dyspraxialife @EmilyyNics They do have a separate dyspraxia and adults page... but they still don’t fund our diagnosis 🙈🙃
1310712225892651008 2020-09-29 06:45:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @emkburke So basically reading this all I’m getting is - therapists getting paid to do nothing. Therapists getting paid to leave potentially vulnerable people in the lurch. Therapists not being there for a person if/when they spiral. Absolutely awful.
1310690392594149383 2020-09-29 05:18:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Well I feel for the students right now. Just saw clips of one of the Manchester unis and it’s appalling. And the staff member they interviewed was shocking and dismissive.

1310333997663174657 2020-09-28 05:42:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Honestly #Canadian #neurodiversesquad need to follow the fabulous @rosiemay_r . She is an asset to dyspraxics worldwide!

1310176949344579584 2020-09-27 19:18:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @astronaut_Alex1 @scovelljohn Open uni didn’t offer my course and because I did a BTEC my options were limited anyway.
1310176762874269697 2020-09-27 19:17:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Brilliant question! I’ll be sure to answer. Thank you ☺️
1310172797973549056 2020-09-27 19:01:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @astronaut_Alex1 Uni was a mess for me being dyspraxic for this reason. My sleep pattern was skee wizz
1310147639317606401 2020-09-27 17:21:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hey #neurodiversesquad @twitter for some bizzare reason don’t allow the infinity emoji ♾ in your bio. But fear not, for they do let you paste this infinity symbol into your bio - ∞ - great news for those wanting to rep #neurodiversity on their profile!
1310142436191109120 2020-09-27 17:01:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver Always happy to promote fellow dyspraxics! ☺️
1310141965179199490 2020-09-27 16:59:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I‘ve done this more than once and often retweet or make my own tweets to support the wider community. The majority of people I follow aren’t dyspraxic for that reason. The rest of #neurodiversity is a loved beach, #dyspraxia is but a grain of sand insignificant to others.3/3
1310141962188619776 2020-09-27 16:59:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The other thing is I see other #neurodivergent folk and professionals use the #dyspraxia tag as a means to boost their content. We use other neurodivergent tags as a means to engage the community. I have even invited questions or dialogue.2/3
1310141958740942849 2020-09-27 16:59:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Part of the struggle re #dyspraxia that @rosiemay_r nods to is that there are people with x AND dyspraxia. Dyspraxia is seen as the and. Heck I have heard #autistic people refer to dyspraxia as part of autism or say that dyspraxia is on the spectrum which is hugely inaccurate!1/3
1310139479240441856 2020-09-27 16:49:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Great to see dyspraxic adults represented. Keep it up Krystal!
1310138599640268802 2020-09-27 16:45:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Great tip even for dyspraxic adults who may struggle with fine motor skills to practice and improve. Even adults like an exciting bath time, why do you think bath bombs are so popular? 😂  On a side note seeing mention of shaving foam &amp; dyspraxia made me think of @DyspraxicShaver
1310135158067081217 2020-09-27 16:32:17 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BackClassroom @LauraFMcConnell @DyspraxicCircle We run zoom meetings which aren’t facebook exclusive that could be an option. There‘s a regular session each Wednesday and we have women’s only sessions on the first and third Tuesday of the month. I’ve had similar struggles with work but there aren’t many flexible jobs out there
1310003525523582976 2020-09-27 07:49:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I definitely need to read this and wish it was around when I wrote my undergrad dissertation. I wrote my dissertation on neurodivergent women!
1310002926677626883 2020-09-27 07:46:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AdultingADHD Great question and it seems you have been paying attention to the dyspraxic adult community which is great! I’ll be sure to answer this question in the video!
1310002567955517440 2020-09-27 07:45:25 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @iNabber69 So he unsubscribed because you’re bi? What a tosser.  Side note - I’m bi and only realised we have a visibility day watching your video after the fact 😅😂
1309992949518929920 2020-09-27 07:07:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @emkburke This is asking folk on the spectrum but I always answer these questions. If folk ask what I’m up to and I’m not doing much, I say. If folk ask what I’m watching and its Crazy Ex Girlfriend I say. The only time people ask these is in texts - how can you join someone in a text? 😂
1309991699062587394 2020-09-27 07:02:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Magnus919 Go to your room Leia!
1309991101814669316 2020-09-27 06:59:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I caught the beginnings of it as I was completing my final year of uni during lockdown and it was hell. I had to return home early and study at home with everything online. I left a town I loved. No graduation and all future hopes/plans destroyed. Now struggling to find work.
1309990277466279936 2020-09-27 06:56:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BackClassroom @LauraFMcConnell Its something many dyspraxic’s are trying to raise awareness of. Most dyspraxic adult groups on facebook, including those under the @DyspraxicCircle umbrella, welcome self-diagnosed adults for that very reason. You are not alone and we will welcome you if you wish to join us ☺️
1309989846589599744 2020-09-27 06:54:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BackClassroom @LauraFMcConnell I‘ve heard similar from dyspraxic folk I know who were ‘unofficially diagnosed’ when their kid was. It‘s hugely unfair that difficulties are recognised yet they don’t fund diagnosis. Lord knows how much I heard the word resilient pre-diagnosis as a means to diminish my struggles.
1309988402318716928 2020-09-27 06:49:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As #Dyspraxia Awareness Week is near I’d like to answer your questions in a video. I’ll include Q’s from all #neurodiversity even #dyspraxic folk. Whatever you have wanted to #AskADyspraxic now is your chance!  #autism #ADHD #dyslexia #neurodiversesquad #neurodiverse #DCD #DYSPR  https://t.co/TgPx1englH
1309857015129354241 2020-09-26 22:07:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m one away from 666 followers. Who will make me a lucky devil? 😈😜😂
1309829190099841026 2020-09-26 20:16:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Loving that you made this feminine! We need more feminine dyspraxia representation!
1309808042595307520 2020-09-26 18:52:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @KJR90 Great to hear! ☺️
1309801280404103170 2020-09-26 18:25:34 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @KJR90 Thanks for sharing and taking steps to raise awareness! We are stronger together 💪  Just in case you didn’t know, awareness week is October 4-10 ☺️
1309786633890340864 2020-09-26 17:27:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I am dyspraxic and dyslexic and only now realised I can change the colour contrast on twitter 🙃🙈😅
1309786308496293890 2020-09-26 17:26:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Dyspraxics also have this issue especially if there is background noise. And it can take us a few seconds to process what the person said before we respond.
1309782755409047552 2020-09-26 17:11:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @NCWeek Thank you too for a productive and friendly conversation!  https://t.co/d7agqJDmSd
1309777226141962241 2020-09-26 16:49:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @NCWeek I can very much empathise with the mask part, not so much the kid part. But I do want change not only for myself and neurodivergent peers but also for my own and any other neurodivergent kids in the future. We are letting down some of our most brilliant brains and we need change.
1309775776234045441 2020-09-26 16:44:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @NCWeek To clarify the school didn’t offer me help when approached. Mum tried getting me help. I noticed I badly worded that last tweet!
1309775404882956289 2020-09-26 16:42:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @NCWeek My brothers, who had always been quicker and got better grades, were offered help. Mum noticed I struggled more than my brothers ever did but apparently I was just slow while my brothers were worthy of help. It’s a real and common problem. My bro’s ended up with A* &amp; me with C’s
1309774947972255744 2020-09-26 16:40:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @NCWeek Also in the way I socialise. I think I agree that the needs of everyone including parents and teachers needs to be focused on. This however doesn’t happen. I learned post diagnosis that mum tried getting me help in school but was constantly dismissed despite the fact - tbc
1309774529665937408 2020-09-26 16:39:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @NCWeek I only remain a member as it gives me access to updates on the very few forms of progress in the realm of dyspraxia. As for dyslexia I also have dyslexia late diagnosed but they actually helped me for that. My dyspraxia was dismissed and it cost me in confidence and - tbc
1309774086202064896 2020-09-26 16:37:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 @NCWeek That’s exactly it. And I think the issue is that there are charities who market “support groups for members” that then bar people with the diagnosis and only allow parents or carers to attend. My own money has been exploited for membership in this way and - tbc
1309771725056466944 2020-09-26 16:28:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 My personal focus would be to raise awareness of neurodiversity and it’s facets among both staff and students. I think a good step would be to sign your school up to neurodiversity celebration week created by the fabulous @NCWeek
1309771341613105153 2020-09-26 16:26:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 I think they would be helpful however the issue is have all ND kids actually been recognised? Because I know women in particular have a tendency to get diagnosed later in life after undergoing turmoil. And various minorities tend not to get recognised as much either - tbc
1309768739173412865 2020-09-26 16:16:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 I think some of the software which I actually did receive was helpful like mind mapping but they made me buy a new PC to access it! Free library printing credits would have made reading and note taking more accessible. I did get some extra time on essays and exams which helped.
1309768285748109314 2020-09-26 16:14:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 They had support sessions and mindfulness/meditation for both autism and ADHD but nothing for other ND students! Peer groups would have been especially beneficial to help socialise at uni. A learning mentor to help with organisation and planning would have been great - tbc again
1309767682435227649 2020-09-26 16:12:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 Free access to the uni gym as exercise can be harder to do or access for dyspraxics without proper guidance, dyspraxia friendly cooking sets for campus living, possibly a free lanyard depending on the students confidence, peer support sessions for all ND students - tbc again
1309767168309985285 2020-09-26 16:10:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 What I’d expect and what reality is are quite different. You are bang on the mark that they treat us the same as dyslexia in education when our needs differ! I would have wanted a scribe, some kind of coaching to navigate crowds/socialise - tbc character limit reached
1309766268472438784 2020-09-26 16:06:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @seainclusion @LauraFMcConnell I can imagine. Dyspraxia is generally unknown but I think I was double wammied being a woman as it’s a trend in neurodiversity that we are under diagnosed and get diagnosed late more often than men - it’s an issue particularly for dyspraxia as the NHS don’t fund adult diagnosis
1309765240763056128 2020-09-26 16:02:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 I have first hand experience as a dyspraxic person who just recently graduated. Some unis are brilliant and offer support services anyway if you register x thing. But for most unis in order to gain support she’ll have to apply for DSA. Re inclusive teaching happy to chat on that!
1309684477652865024 2020-09-26 10:41:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MissMcHale1 That’s fabulous! If you ever have questions, want recommendations for accounts to follow or are simply looking for resources I’m happy to help. Dyspraxia is my main focus but I am also big on advocating more broadly for neurodivergent women (in fact I am one myself!) ☺️
1309683725270159360 2020-09-26 10:38:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ADHFemale This thread from @DyspraxicWomen lists a ton of dyspraxia accounts!  But off the top of my head I’d say @ComplicatedPete @TumiSotire @DyspraxicHelp4U @EmilyyNics @Academic_owl @rosiemay_r @nickyot4kidsdcd are all good accounts who are either dyspraxic themselves or huge allies!
1309558912132288512 2020-09-26 02:22:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @agvbergin We tried with #DiscoveringDyspraxia but it sadly didn’t catch on
1309557186478182408 2020-09-26 02:15:38 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @agvbergin Oh don’t get me wrong I think we should be talking about both more because neurodiversity as a whole is generally misunderstood. We just need to make sure we bring everyone along for the ride yah know? ☺️
1309543969722961920 2020-09-26 01:23:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @agvbergin If I mention to people off/online that I‘m dyslexic they have at least heard of it. If I mention dyspraxia I either get a confused look or the “don’t you mean dyslexia” line. I do bring up dyslexia when relevant but due to how bad things are for dyspraxia it has to be my priority
1309543351201472516 2020-09-26 01:20:39 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @agvbergin I’m also dyslexic &amp; noticed that while there isn’t an active community - professionals mention it &amp; ND events usually include “the big three” ADHD, Autism &amp; Dyslexia. Dyspraxia is usually reduced to a mere hashtag if mentioned at all. There’s a reason I focus on dyspraxia more1/?
1309490095448379393 2020-09-25 21:49:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @TripleTakeover I think the issue with diagnosis is a bigger reason this is frustrating. If it is just dyspraxic people talking nothing will change. We desperately need allies to help us gain recognition and respect which hopefully would lead to change. Hopefully that makes sense
1309412601202454528 2020-09-25 16:41:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia Its because the term diverse refers to groups while the term divergent can be used to describe an individual. A class full of kids might be neurodiverse, but its the dyspracic kid, the dyslexic kid etc who is neurodivergent.
1309412089576992768 2020-09-25 16:39:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Being #dyspraxic on twitter is draining. It feels like we do lots to engage in the wider #neurodivergent community. We see the #neurodiversesquad &amp; allies engage in every facet of #neurodiversity accept #dyspraxia. At times it feels like only dyspraxic people care about dyspraxia
1309247281460322304 2020-09-25 05:44:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @commaficionado Why oh why does this tweet remind me of Father Ted? 😅  https://t.co/tgd22PHcqz
1309207985101697025 2020-09-25 03:08:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I went live discussing being left out of the #neurodiversity conversation, how #dyspraxic folk are perceived on Twitter and awareness week clashes. All unscripted but thoughts I’ve had. I figure it’s easier to get my tone if I speak.  #dyspraxia #neurodiversesquad #neurodivergent
1309199611593142272 2020-09-25 02:34:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD>  https://t.co/8NmmxGVmaE
1309185607508295680 2020-09-25 01:39:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Not a purchase per say. But I struggle with memory because of dyspraxia and have always wanted to learn a language. @duolingo has been amazing for me. I’d say it’s the most neurodiversity friendly language learning platform around.
1309120944796041219 2020-09-24 21:22:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SiduriSabitu @Academic_owl I believe the focus on hand gestures isn’t to do with dyspraxia. Politicians get trained in body language and usually learn specific quirks to help them get remembered. For Trump its this👌hand gesture. For Bojo its his hair and his hand movements. Its planned and choreographed
1309118897078128640 2020-09-24 21:14:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @SiduriSabitu @Academic_owl Thanks for clarifying. There‘s been a string of tweets mentioning disabilities and health conditions as ways to criticise Trump and Bojo without considering their words or actions. I‘m usually critical of these tweets as we have enough stereotypes without adding Bojo into the mix
1309105851576266756 2020-09-24 20:22:11 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LiteralBonny @Dyspraxialife @ADHDFoundation I never noticed the puzzle pieces before just thought it was blue writing but now you mention it I can’t unsee it!
1308938714878541824 2020-09-24 09:18:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m bisexual. Apparently yesterday was our day of visibility. Nobody gave me the memo. Am I the invisible bi? 😂  PS are you even bi if you don’t sing along to this giff? (I’m jesting ofc, but you should check out the song if you don’t know it 😛)  https://t.co/RlMEGW9tpG
1308932199484452864 2020-09-24 08:52:09 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @InterPals I just downloaded the app, edited my profile as I haven’t used it in a couple of years. I was happily chatting to three people who had sent me messages and all of a sudden it stops me sending messages saying “too many requests in a short period”. How do I resolve this?
1308895277542248451 2020-09-24 06:25:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’m sure a man must have designed the cameras at self scan check outs because all I see when I use them is my tits 🙈🙃
1308765545177714688 2020-09-23 21:49:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I have family members tell me just this. I also was open about being dyspraxic on a dating site and was told not to let it define me. Try being late diagnosed dyspraxic and constantly dismissed and then tell me that. #dyspraxia
1308764490159329280 2020-09-23 21:45:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If folk host #neurodiversity events but those events are only for #autism, #ADHD and #dyslexia - I’d ask why the dyspraxia tag is included when dyspraxia is not. Perhaps they have future dyspraxia events planned, but I see this too much on the #dyspraxia by too many groups/orgs.
1308763376676417536 2020-09-23 21:41:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I think it’s fabulous that you want to raise money for a #dyspraxia charity. Though I’d add if you want to directly impact dyspraxic people you can help by tweeting about dyspraxia and promoting dyspraxic content during awareness week ☺️
1308762909355450369 2020-09-23 21:39:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @BottomFloer @PhilippaB @DYSPRAXIAFDTN @SeeAbility I believe @DyspraxicMe is a charity for young dyspraxics!
1308762407225958405 2020-09-23 21:37:28 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @astronaut_Alex1 Thanks for sharing 💕
1308392824912609283 2020-09-22 21:08:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I did another #dyspraxia tiktok because I got people over there asking what it is  https://t.co/l79aThuXpH  #dyspraxic #neurodiversesquad #neurodiversity #neurodivergent #neurodiverse #DCD #dyspraxiaawareness #discoveringdyspraxia #dyspraxicadults #dyspraxicwomen #DYSPR
1308130643268829186 2020-09-22 03:47:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @KeepinItKieran Remember when a teacher tried suspending me for my hair?
1308030384270184449 2020-09-21 21:08:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Long shot, but if you know what these are, can you let me know? ☺️  https://t.co/139fE1zjfm
1307754998793728002 2020-09-21 02:54:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @HMourland I like to think of it more like shedding skin. The snake is still the same snake, it’s just let go of something from the past that may have been holding them down and regenerated into something new. I think the snake metaphor is much nicer than a puzzle.
1307745583780814848 2020-09-21 02:16:58 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Saraheboon If you are in the UK a few further education colleges have free distance learning courses. The quality I couldn’t comment on but they are there
1307743265337335808 2020-09-21 02:07:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Dumb question but I have seen another person post about people posting about QAnon but I’m not sure what it actually is. Is it something easy googleable or niche? Or is it a “trust me don’t look it up” situation? All I can gather is it’s bad but beyond that I know nothing
1307444991694864384 2020-09-20 06:22:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Eh, its what my mum calls the nectar in the poison. Sure it kinda sucks, but I wouldn’t be doing what I do now in relation to neurodiversity and dyspraxia if it hadn’t happened. My own experiences have motivated me to fight for a future where the next women won’t go through it
1307442446029262848 2020-09-20 06:12:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I agree in hindsight but at the time all I could think was “why am I so dumb” “why aren’t a good enough”. Even after getting my degree (3 years later than my peers) I still question my intellect because of it.
1307441993384157184 2020-09-20 06:10:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic I can’t speak for every school nor every woman (I don’t know who did or did not get diagnosed post 16). But it seems to be the case. One of my brothers for instance is dyslexic, got diagnosed in year 2 and ended up an A grade student. I struggled throughout with no diagnosis.
1307439839743291397 2020-09-20 06:02:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic My brothers got put on Gifted &amp; Talented. I didn’t. They also got offered support that I didn’t which helped them excel in school. They were talented, I was average and didn’t find out I was dyspraxic until age 21. If I were a man I’d have been supported &amp; ‘talented’.
1307426329244176390 2020-09-20 05:08:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @rosiemay_r @ComplicatedPete @Dyspraxialife @DyspraxicCircle @Spotify Yes to including the segment! TBC regarding release date but we are recording on Monday! And yes it will be on Spotify ☺️
1307425992324141058 2020-09-20 05:07:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @emkburke @sunflwrlanyards Why is it that both you and the parrot sum up how I’m handling 2020 🤣
1307424948533760002 2020-09-20 05:02:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I am very pleased to confirm that @ComplicatedPete who is the founder of @Dyspraxialife and @DyspraxicCircle will be joining me as my very first podcast guest! We’ll be talking about ‘the dyspraxic voice’ and all things awareness. Keep posted! #dyspraxia #dyspraxic #neurodiverse
1307416466367676417 2020-09-20 04:29:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @HMourland @UntoNuggan I am both and they aren’t similar in any way and impact me differently. I’ve been offered what feels like a world of support for dyslexia and nothing for dyspraxia despite it impacting everyday life more. And like you say though even the dyslexia support is few and far between.
1307288286273118208 2020-09-19 19:59:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @barisanhantu @Dyspraxialife Oh damn. Well dyspraxics can learn movements just not always accurately hence things like messy handwriting for instance. We can do it, just not very well 😂
1307286785916121089 2020-09-19 19:53:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @barisanhantu @Dyspraxialife I believe apraxia is almost entirely related to speech while dyspraxia relates to the movements the body makes as a whole hence fine and gross motor coordination being a dyspraxia thing.
1307286397670260738 2020-09-19 19:52:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As a double dys myself this is all too familiar. There is a reason I’m vocal about dyspraxia and not dyslexia. Awareness is shocking.
1307237188720046080 2020-09-19 16:36:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @barisanhantu You are from what I have noticed in a small minority of people who do try to at least be aware of dyspraxia. There is a small bubble of people on twitter who do. But a large amount on twitter and beyond do not. I’ve heard many accounts of actual GP’s correcting dyspraxic folk!
1307234920453025792 2020-09-19 16:27:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If they aren’t correcting us, they tell us how similar it is. Outside of education we get zero support, inside we get offered the same support as dyslexic students despite having different needs. And we have ND squad members getting hostile with us for correcting/informing them.
1307005962516140033 2020-09-19 01:17:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So learning it took learning another language to learn how to spell restaurant in my own 🤣
1306988195742179339 2020-09-19 00:07:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @PhilippaB @rosiemay_r @ComplicatedPete @DyspraxicHelp4U @TumiSotire @krystalbellax @EmilyyNics *community - gosh darn predictive text 🤣
1306987945707163648 2020-09-19 00:06:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @PhilippaB @rosiemay_r @ComplicatedPete @DyspraxicHelp4U @TumiSotire @krystalbellax @EmilyyNics You’re most welcome! There’s a modest but very supportive communion dyspraxics out there ☺️
1306986950277160960 2020-09-19 00:02:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> We are absolutely out here. Check out @rosiemay_r @ComplicatedPete @DyspraxicHelp4U @TumiSotire @krystalbellax @EmilyyNics to name just a few.   I recommend searching Dyspraxia and Dyspraxic and clicking on the people tab. It’s how I found a plethora of dyspraxic people!
1306985419494559748 2020-09-18 23:56:21 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I used to sing songs in the corridors back when I used to mop on closes at the cinema I worked in. It did help make it easier.
1306984958876102670 2020-09-18 23:54:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I’ve said before how I reckon there‘s a huge chunk of the #neurodiversesquad who are also #dyspraxic that pass of their traits as just a part of their current diagnosis when it’s really #dyspraxia. This is why awareness is so vital and why all ND folk should help us raise it.
1306885759501205508 2020-09-18 17:20:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah Thanks for clarifying. I ask because you are probably aware that diagnosing dyspraxia in adults is a bit of a mine field. So its always interesting to hear how different people found out!
1306885269103284227 2020-09-18 17:18:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah That seems odd they worded it like that because dyspraxia isn’t something you ‘test positive’ for. Out of curiosity did they diagnose both at the same time or did you have two separate assessments?
1306884026502975495 2020-09-18 17:13:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah I’ll have to check that documentary out. I should clarify people don’t test positive for things like dyspraxia - its not an illness or infection where we give swabs or anything. We either show traits or not and if we show traits during a diagnostic assessment we get diagnosed.
1306882354795999233 2020-09-18 17:06:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah *not just autism I should have put. So I looked at dyspraxia, ADHD, Dyslexia, Tourettes, Dyscalculia etc as well.
1306881899760095235 2020-09-18 17:05:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @missmontanah Oh yes, that was one of the main things I wrote about as my dissertation centered on the gap in diagnosis between neurodivergent men and women. Though I was looking at all of neurodiversity not just women as its a trend across the board.
1306739493014298624 2020-09-18 07:39:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Maybe I’ll do a video about it as I don’t think my dyspraxia blog is the right place to get into this kind of topic 😅 11/
1306739490367692800 2020-09-18 07:39:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So much could link into just this topic but its 00:31am and I know I simply cannot do this topic justice at this time of night. Nor could I do this topic justice on twitter. I do want to revisit this thread and the question though. Maybe do some reading. Solidify my thoughts. 10/
1306739487813361669 2020-09-18 07:39:06 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Its probably a bad idea for a dyspraxic person to tweet about this but you can easily talk about this same topic looking at the story of Persephone as a metaphor for death feeding life and returning back to where it came almost like a breath or the tides. 9/
1306739484952801283 2020-09-18 07:39:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Leading on you could see whatever your energy moves into, after life, as your reincarnation. Regarding the original question, if you see god or divinity in all that exists - this entire process is god creating man from dirt and then returning us back from whence we came. 8/
1306739482545319942 2020-09-18 07:39:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> In a way you could see the underworld as simply that. The soil, the bodies, below the ground. And the afterlife being the thing the energy that made you up flows into. You could even see your current lifetime as the afterlife of something that came before. 7/
1306739480032940032 2020-09-18 07:39:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> The energy that made up my body, my mind, it will still exist. But through death, through processes like the body biodegrading, that energy will pass on into something new feeding grass, worms or what have you. 6/
1306739477478604802 2020-09-18 07:39:04 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Of course, we don’t truly know what happens when you die but for me, weirdly what helped me accept death was accepting the idea that my mind, thoughts and consciousness as we know it will be gone. 5/
1306739474538270721 2020-09-18 07:39:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Think about it. When a person dies, assuming they are buried rather than cremated, what happens? Eventually their body rots down, the flesh gets eaten or simply degrades into the earth. 4/
1306739471166124034 2020-09-18 07:39:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Death being one of those topics. People need something to hold onto, or a way to come to terms with their inevitable demise. The idea of god making man from dirt to me links in with both ideas of reincarnation and death. 3/
1306739467735236609 2020-09-18 07:39:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I have a weird mix of beliefs when it comes to both life and death which don’t necessarily fit one box. But certainly I think a lot of mythical or religious descriptions don’t have to be taken literally. They can be a way to help understand or process more difficult topics. 2/
1306739460072144904 2020-09-18 07:38:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Because we rot back down into the earth (well that is if we aren’t cremated ofc). Obvs I know christians, who I imagine this question was for, probably would have a different answer. 1/
1306672268660084738 2020-09-18 03:12:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @KateHerrity I try to have homes for things and loose the homes 😂
1306670485107867650 2020-09-18 03:04:55 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @KateHerrity I should really do this. I have left the house braless before 🙈
1306668826235473927 2020-09-18 02:58:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Until this changes, yes labels do matter. Neurodiversity isn’t a one size fits all pair of goggles. Not only is each diagnosis different, but each individual. To ignore a label and offer no or the wrong support is to let down all neurodivergents. 3/3
1306668824666738688 2020-09-18 02:58:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> My dyspraxia impacts me far more than my dyslexia as it isn’t just related to the way I process information. Dyspraxia impacts how I carry out actions, at what speed, accuracy etc. Yet there isn’t support for this. Many can’t even access diagnosis let alone support. 2/3
1306668822838079491 2020-09-18 02:58:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> While I think accessing support is vital, unless people understand what it is they are supposed to be supporting we won’t get anywhere. I am dyspraxic and dyslexic. My dyslexia barely effects me because the support is there in a way it isn’t for dyspraxia. 1/3
1306514096691568641 2020-09-17 16:43:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia @DyspraxicCircle I think this may have been a genuine question from Pete, almost an add on to my own question. From what I can remember (it has been deleted so I am going off memory) it wasn’t fully clear which I imagine is why he asked. I know at least thats why I asked
1306513264646524928 2020-09-17 16:40:10 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia @DyspraxicCircle I‘d like to make it clear to everyone that if I ask questions or don’t have an immediately positive response that doesn’t mean I‘m deamonising or denouncing anyone. Some things are worth clarifying, other things are worth highlighting - that doesn’t mean the whole thing is bad.
1306511905243136000 2020-09-17 16:34:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia @DyspraxicCircle I want to clarify I wasn’t in anyway denouncing anyone. I was asking a genuine question as while you‘ve stated that you go to events where the information is, I don’t feel comfortable going to events advertised for parents and teachers as it makes me feel like I don’t belong.
1306511015916572672 2020-09-17 16:31:14 +0800 <DeviantDCD> You know #dyspraxia awareness is bad when other members of the #neurodiversesquad were led to believe that speaking and writing difficulties were just part of #autism.   PS don’t forget awareness week is October 4th-10th.   #dyspraxic #neurodivergent #neurodiversity #neurodiverse
1306365595320025088 2020-09-17 06:53:23 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @emkburke I used to have my real name on twitter but changed it fir similar reasons to you. I too would like to publish a book under my real name - but I figure if I was successful in publishing a book it might not matter so much if employers knew about my feisty fight for awareness xD
1306361332120330251 2020-09-17 06:36:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia @DyspraxicCircle Interesting, but I’d ask why these things are always for parents/carers/teachers? There seems to be no effort to engage with dyspraxic adults despite the experience and insight we could provide. If they were more willing to engage with us, I’ve no doubt we’d have better support.
1306359285484486656 2020-09-17 06:28:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia I totally empathise here
1306358580589801474 2020-09-17 06:25:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> You know dyspraxia awareness is bad when you get excited because someone used the #dyspraxia and #dyslexia tag to highlight the differences. So often dyspraxics are brushed off “don’t you mean dyslexia” and folks use our tag to promote dyslexia events all the time 🙃
1306357625072889857 2020-09-17 06:21:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> As a dyspraxic woman I feel this with my soul 😂
1306356472557826050 2020-09-17 06:17:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia We have people like you to look up to when speaking out though so you should 100% give yourself some credit 💗
1306354526488858624 2020-09-17 06:09:24 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia Same, but if we won’t be the devil in the details, who will?😜
1306325942130933760 2020-09-17 04:15:49 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @krystalbellax Probably in awareness week
1306325592925786112 2020-09-17 04:14:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia Glad you are ok and thank you too 💕
1306313488713895936 2020-09-17 03:26:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia As good as it can be considering how hard it is finding work. But I have a roof over my head so can’t complain. How about on your end?
1306312340808380417 2020-09-17 03:21:46 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia They are amazing, make reading much easier and my eyes don’t strain!
1306286472081833986 2020-09-17 01:38:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> You know that time I said that if you support the #neurodiversesquad you should also support #dyspraxia? This thread has some great accounts to follow. #dyspraxic #neurodiversity #neurodivergent #neurodiverse #DCD #discoveringdyspraxia #dyspraxiaawareness #dyspraxicadults
1305860745796689922 2020-09-15 21:27:18 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Tbh lads Series Of Unfortunate events was better than Harry Potter anyway. So if you want a nostalgia trip and want to avoid supporting a transphobe why not relive some classic Count Olaf action xD
1305858312018288642 2020-09-15 21:17:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Hagrid’s at it too, and it seems he also holds some hostility to a group he’s called the twitter generation. He does realise that twitter spans SEVERAL generations of people right? 😂
1305854162001956864 2020-09-15 21:01:08 +0800 <DeviantDCD> RuPaul’s Drag Race must be like American Horror Story to JK. I can’t fathom why her or her publisher thought this book was a good idea. Perhaps they thought controversy would help it sell, or they‘re banking on enough “I’m not transphobic BUT” types buying it. Bullshit regardless
1305850180021948419 2020-09-15 20:45:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @MemphisMidnight @ComplicatedPete is pretty knowledgeable on this topic. He’s a bit of a fountain of knowledge on the subject of dyspraxia diagnosis in the UK.
1305847528970219520 2020-09-15 20:34:47 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @aimzyjx @billiepiper Oh yes that is bad I can see why you are upset now!
1305653486399500293 2020-09-15 07:43:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @aimzyjx @billiepiper May I ask out of curiosity which show and how it portrayed dyspraxia?
1305610677386706947 2020-09-15 04:53:37 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This song is my mood tonight tbh  https://t.co/SXV9C7ul1p
1305581675947139072 2020-09-15 02:58:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> If you are dyspraxic and based in Ireland check out @dyspraxiaIRL and @DyspraxicIRE   Don’t forget @DyspraxicCircle will also be holding Irish zoom meets too!
1305076506373300225 2020-09-13 17:31:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So there are people who praised my recent video just because I’m young. This to me makes it feel like they think my age matters more than the message. If you are going to commend me, do so for my words, not my youth.
1305075355515072512 2020-09-13 17:26:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @scovelljohn I don’t think so at all. For starters it was only mentioned a couple of times and in the most recent series Ryan was barely in it and I can’t even remember Dyspraxia being mentioned. And in his first series all they really highlighted was bike riding 🙃
1305074826403483650 2020-09-13 17:24:20 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @QueerlyAutistic Oh I was actually agreeing with you but probably wasn’t clear enough.
1305051300510535688 2020-09-13 15:50:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Reclaiming a word is fine but there are those who try to erase it. I’ve had a straight man not believe bisexuality is real. Apparently if I’m with a man I’m straight and if I’m with a woman I’m a lesbian. That’s not how things work. I know others who have heard similar rhetoric.
1305050231050993664 2020-09-13 15:46:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So two people commented on my video “Things NOT To Say To A #Dyspraxic Person” asking what #dyspraxia is. I half thought they were trolls. But this actually proves how poor awareness of dyspraxia is. The #NeurodiverseSquad on Twitter have been making efforts but elsewhere, nope.

1304686624157163520 2020-09-12 15:41:45 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @irini_noch We face similar problems which is why I love neurodiversity celebration week. But we also have unique issues and dyspraxia for instance is often unheard of with folks saying “don’t you mean dyslexia”. So having individual awareness weeks are also important.

1304517441305878528 2020-09-12 04:29:29 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike @kiekenvet_dave Oh gosh yes that’s a big one too 🤣
1304516616588341248 2020-09-12 04:26:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike @kiekenvet_dave That is a good thing that they learned from talking to you. And perhaps dyspraxia as a word being more known could open up conversations in a similar way to how the ADHD term is more known (even if people have bad facts it at least opens conversations which is a first step)
1304515917267828736 2020-09-12 04:23:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike @kiekenvet_dave This is a good thing. But again the workplace isn’t the only reason awareness is important.
1304515667379486721 2020-09-12 04:22:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike @kiekenvet_dave I get that, but it’s important to remember that awareness isn’t just about the work place and there may well be adults who struggle finding work at all because awareness was poor and their difficulties weren’t recognised. Now it’s just a case of having the word dyspraxia known.
1304515206895239168 2020-09-12 04:20:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> This is why awareness is so important. Why is it that the same person can get support when they ‘let their doc’ label them as autistic, but if they mention dyspraxia - nothing.  Awareness is crucial. #dyspraxia
1304514666404741120 2020-09-12 04:18:27 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike @kiekenvet_dave It’s why awareness is so important. So many kids let alone adults are being missed. 2/2
1304514533525008384 2020-09-12 04:17:56 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike @kiekenvet_dave It’s hard to support the individual if they don’t know what they are supporting. My school life, mental health and even my social life would have been better if there was awareness of dyspraxia. I ended up behind on milestones and only excelled after diagnosis age 21. 1/2
1304513726394105859 2020-09-12 04:14:43 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike @kiekenvet_dave Exactly which is why having separate weeks is valuable. They are called awareness weeks for a reason. They are meant to make people who aren’t aware, ie the general public, aware.
1304512510817644546 2020-09-12 04:09:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @kiekenvet_dave @DifferentlyMike Yes and no. As I mentioned in other replies, people still repeat the line “don’t you mean dyslexia” to Dyspraxic folks. As long as this continues we don’t truly have awareness which is exactly why we need our own weeks. Neurodiversity celebration week is the time to come together
1304505957511299072 2020-09-12 03:43:51 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DifferentlyMike On one hand I think the overlap is important hence why I love neurodiversity celebration week. But, when dyspraxic people are still being told “don’t you mean dyslexia”, I think it’s important they also have their own time. The two continuing to be confused hinders awareness.
1304479087612829698 2020-09-12 01:57:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DCDFilmmaker See that is what neurodiversity celebration week is for. But until people stop correcting dyspraxic folk saying “don’t you mean dyslexia” we really do need our weeks to be separate. The two together adds to confusion and actually harms rather than helps dyspraxia awareness
1304450095858028544 2020-09-12 00:01:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Equally the three neurodiversities need their own space in order to maximise awareness of individual diagnosis. As such #dyspraxia, dyslexia and ADHD weeks/months should all occur at different times in the year to allow each cause the recognition they deserve. 2/2
1304450094108995585 2020-09-12 00:01:52 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Last year #Dyspraxia awareness week clashed with Black History Month AND dyslexia awareness week. This year it clashes with both of those AND ADHD month. I think the three neurodiversities should each move to a different month so as not to take away from the importance of BHM 1/2
1304144492178673666 2020-09-11 03:47:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Nellamommy1 I can safely assure you that dyspraxic people can go on to live very fulfilling lives with the right love and support. @DyspraxicCircle is a massive community of dyspraxics and @Dyspraxialife have a range of personal accounts from adult dyspraxics
1304131579493732354 2020-09-11 02:56:12 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ruthgibson35 I answered no. My GP is barely aware of mental health let alone anything else. He wouldn’t believe that I went to casualty until the notes came in later that day, even shouting at me and making me cry saying I was wasting NHS time. I didn’t see a GP for 2 years after that.
1304130768583753730 2020-09-11 02:52:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Don’t know who else watches neighbour all I’m gonna say is Shane 😭
1304098762516766722 2020-09-11 00:45:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> So I ordered a load of clay to make decorations with. It arrives tomorrow. I am excited. Taking my rock painting ventures to the next level 😂
1304000383036121095 2020-09-10 18:14:53 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AlexXavi77 I can’t speak for everyone but I try my best to have an intersectional approach. But I tend more so to share the root source rather than speak for or over. And I don’t like drawing attention to it because I don’t want to seem like it’s for clout. Intersectionality is key.
1303974876919853056 2020-09-10 16:33:31 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @AlexXavi77 I would add mostly male to that mix. There is a reason women are STILL underdiagnosed.
1303973435643695107 2020-09-10 16:27:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I think it’s good to focus on helping #SEND in school but I’d ask what they will do to fill gaps in diagnosis. Women and other minorities so often go unrecognised which leads to unequal opportunities later in life once school is over.
1303971987476353025 2020-09-10 16:22:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> There are so many. Mixing words or tripping on sentences. Dropping or spilling things. Tripping up or bumping into things. Finding it hard to follow conversations in large groups or if it’s too fast (why some of us use subtitles on TV). Slower reading, poor organisation.
1303970532610772992 2020-09-10 16:16:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Corvid189592286 I believe you can get plastic ones in some supermarket. While plastic isn’t great for the environment if it’s something you are going to keep and not throw out I’d say it’s worth it.
1303969780433588225 2020-09-10 16:13:16 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @LucyRankin1996 My point isn’t NOT to call people “person with” more so not to enforce it. There are folks out there who refuse to use the term dyspraxic even when the individual asks them to. That’s what I take issue with.
1303615989209337857 2020-09-09 16:47:26 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @PerplexedSeal @Academic_owl @aheeleyRIBA I think you very much understand my perspective @PerplexedSeal
1303615325418774528 2020-09-09 16:44:48 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @IanYoungBEIS Partly why I prefer to say dyspraxic. Putting it first places importance helping people to remember something that currently has very little awareness
1303605537318330369 2020-09-09 16:05:54 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl @PerplexedSeal @aheeleyRIBA I would say slang terms vs people’s preferred description of their diagnosis are different scinarios entirely. And context very much matters too. But as I mentioned before, the main thing is to respect if someone states a preference - it’s as simple as that ☺️
1303604727805022208 2020-09-09 16:02:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl @PerplexedSeal @aheeleyRIBA Thing is I don’t think we expect you to define us by our label all the time. In everyday life we are just a person. But if we are in a situation which specifically pertains to our label, in those instances asking things like “how does it feel to be dyspraxic?” would be preferred.

1303404135849570306 2020-09-09 02:45:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl Just clarifying as there is limited space in a tweet. When I say our I mean the individual. If they say call me dyspraxic call them that. If they say call me person with, call them that. Just don’t impose someone else’s preferences onto the individual. Hope that makes more sense!
1303403762892115973 2020-09-09 02:44:07 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @Academic_owl I think folk assume that when someone avoids “person with” that we are defining ourselves completely by our diagnosis. In reality it is only in certain contexts we even talk about our diagnosis. I think if folk respect our preference it’s fine. This isn’t always the case though.
1303398276436295681 2020-09-09 02:22:19 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U Ok that is more shady but I do thing the original tweeter should clarify all this in a thread. Otherwise to an outsider it looks like there isn’t a reason for the tweet
1303397997707964417 2020-09-09 02:21:13 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U I am only going by what is in the original tweet. I think it’s important to make things clear if said thing is made public.   Unfortunately cuts do happen and in that case it’s out of their hands. If they were denied because of disability though, that is bad and needs attention
1303397195996110852 2020-09-09 02:18:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Yo Twitter, I’m not a ‘person with dyspraxia’. I am dyspraxic. You don’t call religious folk ‘person with Christianity’ for example so why do this with dyspraxia? It’s a part of me, it’s not something that can be removed or cured. I am dyspraxic and proud! #dyspraxia #dyspraxic
1303396195629441025 2020-09-09 02:14:03 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U While its sucks that they were denied a bus pass, it isn’t clear if they knew the person had a disability. The email doesn’t mention disability which leads me to believe they didn’t know. Also it seems this scheme is only available to certain areas the tweeter doesn’t live in.
1303376258823270401 2020-09-09 00:54:50 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia I will have to check that song out!
1303374811612278785 2020-09-09 00:49:05 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @mydyspraxia Without context my brain assumes this tweet is about Princess Bride 🤣
1303374433701199881 2020-09-09 00:47:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> What is the most recent song you listened to?   Right now I’m listening to Gethsemane (I only wanted to say) from Jesus Christ Superstar.  https://t.co/Qwku69vIqu
1303234615541403649 2020-09-08 15:31:59 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ComplicatedPete Good luck and stay safe Pete. You’ll rock it!
1303064752256671745 2020-09-08 04:17:01 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ComplicatedPete Best of luck Pete!
1302742558368583680 2020-09-07 06:56:44 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Just so y’all know, #dyspraxia awareness week is October 4-10.  It lowkey irritates my brain though that awareness week always starts on a Sunday.  #dyspraxic #DCD #dyspraxiaawareness #discoveringdyspraxia #neurodiversesquad #neurodivergent #neurodiversity #neurodiverse
1301946023741456385 2020-09-05 02:11:35 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicShaver Totally with you on the tiredness front and I’m double wammied with it sometimes being a woman 🙈😂
1301942443856678912 2020-09-05 01:57:22 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @ComplicatedPete I haven't been fired thankfully but I know how bad just the fear of it can be with the constant monitoring we have these days. That along is bad enough but actually being sacked you’d have the emotions and financial worries. So can totally see post-sacking trauma being a thing.
1301666542317383682 2020-09-04 07:41:02 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I need to learn to stop censoring the word period. If men are grosed out by a bit of biology (biology which is connected to the creation of humans) that is their problem. I also need to stop fearing being attacked for talking about my period. I censored myself today, it stops NOW
1301561762832056320 2020-09-04 00:44:40 +0800 <DeviantDCD> I forgot a lot of big things yesterday. And I thought, dyspraxia is hitting me real hard... turns out it was a monthly dose of hormones playing tricks on me 🙃😅😂
1300907532660150272 2020-09-02 05:25:00 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @enttruth @DyspraxicHelp4U @WitterWit Personally I think outing them when its not been to trial could impact the trial. But if the trial goes belly up I think some kind of petition to the company could be a good next step. But I have a feeling you will win the trial considering the company have broken the law
1300867944331739136 2020-09-02 02:47:41 +0800 <DeviantDCD> @DyspraxicHelp4U Sorry to hear this, hope you are ok. Isn’t it illegal to fire someone for that under the equality act?
1300730518368071681 2020-09-01 17:41:36 +0800 <DeviantDCD> Well finally managing to get a contactless card which will help with public transport and job hunting. Downside... my dyspraxic ass has to memorise a new pin number 🙃
