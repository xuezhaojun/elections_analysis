1337258186747772928 2020-12-11 12:49:31 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Beancounter2525 @KamVTV @realDonaldTrump Let's do this! in every county in every state. Make everything 100% transparent. Require address, signature and voter roll verification for every vote cast in America. If the counties cannot provide the proof of every vote, the vote get thrown out. Both D and R people verifying.
1337251360467607552 2020-12-11 12:22:23 +0800 <myopinion6810> @ScottBaio You tell her she is incredibly smart and she should always question everything!! It could be a conspiracy theory or it could be real. She is an amazing young lady to question this. Great job Bailey!!

1337214064758407168 2020-12-11 09:54:11 +0800 <myopinion6810> @pghowie3 My question in all this insanity, why does she feel Joementia and Cameltoe owe her anything? What exactly did she do for them in Detroit that they are in her debt &amp; it put her life on the line? Could this have anything to so with fraud?
1337132538612101146 2020-12-11 04:30:14 +0800 <myopinion6810> @BeschlossDC Just to let you know from my observation there are no "esteemed reporters" in America today. There are only activists who are enemies of the American people.
1336852513430048769 2020-12-10 09:57:31 +0800 <myopinion6810> @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump So much so I don't think you understand how much love we have for him and all of you. What you all have endured for us is unreal. Thank you.

1336549295726743552 2020-12-09 13:52:38 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Eric_Schmitt "Leading the effort in support" is NOT joining the fight. That's like cheering for your team from the couch. We need states to actually JOIN the fight. We need people who will get off the couch and fight for us and for our country.
1336548443972571139 2020-12-09 13:49:15 +0800 <myopinion6810> @ReverendWarnock So what you're saying is you are NOT Christian?

1336410330851753984 2020-12-09 04:40:26 +0800 <myopinion6810> @amyklobuchar Unfortunately most of those votes were computer generated fraudulent votes or they were from dead people.

1335785295439020036 2020-12-07 11:16:46 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Ilhan Get a job. Pay for insurance. Study harder to get a scholarship. Hold China and India and other 3rd world countries to the same green standards as the US.  Pay your own way, the government and us taxpayers can't afford to support those who won't even work to support themselves.
1335676080901025793 2020-12-07 04:02:48 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SecPompeo Maybe we should be focused on the election fraud that is happening in this country. This election was no better than Venezuelas. And anyone not fixing the fraud here is no better than Maduro.
1335652373067272194 2020-12-07 02:28:35 +0800 <myopinion6810> @elenaparent @realDonaldTrump The "political storm" was created when the democrats and RINOs chose to cheat and try to destroy America. Also, you are one if the ones attempting to destroy our REPUBLIC.
1335645090799374337 2020-12-07 01:59:39 +0800 <myopinion6810> @alicetweet Can we please have journalist instead of activist paid off to help destroy America?
1335387086996660227 2020-12-06 08:54:26 +0800 <myopinion6810> @BrianKempGA Publicly calling for one while instructing your fellow law breakers behind closed doors not to do one...we see it all. All the fraud, all the hypocrisy, all the cheating and all your cover ups. We see it all. Stop thinking we the people are blind and stupid.

1334335969500205057 2020-12-03 11:17:40 +0800 <myopinion6810> @jlenglund3 @KamVTV Jan, if Trump doesn't win, there is no amount of voting that will stop the dems in GA from winning. If the courts set precedent to allow fraudulent elections our vote no longer matters. It's obvious we are already run by Marxist.
1334214174637920257 2020-12-03 03:13:42 +0800 <myopinion6810> @RepDougCollins Why? If fraudulent elections are certified and there is no protection from voter fraud by the courts, why bother voting? It will be stolen anyway. Why bother campaigning or volunteering or donating? Our votes DO NOT MATTER. Welcome to Venezuela.
1334165864992575488 2020-12-03 00:01:44 +0800 <myopinion6810> @MarshaBlackburn Well to be fair, China owned politicians, companies and people are cracking down on our rights and destroying our Republic also.

1333901619159678979 2020-12-02 06:31:43 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SexCounseling The only plan is the destruction of America &amp; yes he is following that plan. Without election integrity, there is no America &amp; right now America is slipping away. It's very sad for me to believe that my grandkids will never know the dream of America.
1333887422925471744 2020-12-02 05:35:18 +0800 <myopinion6810> @DC_Draino The answer is NONE. That is blatantly obvious at this point. If SCOTUS is a dirty as the rest America is gone.

1333885268491833344 2020-12-02 05:26:45 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Annakhait Trust Wray, trust the plan, trust Lindsey, trust McConnell, all of it to keep us quiet while they destroyed America. There is only God that can help us now and He is the only one we should ever trust.
1333876130491744256 2020-12-02 04:50:26 +0800 <myopinion6810> @laurenboebert If this fraudulent election happens, there is no election integrity. Why bother voting or donating time or money to any campaigns that the votes will just be stolen and the courts will allow it. We will forever know our vote will NEVER again count.
1333875489560174593 2020-12-02 04:47:53 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Qtah17 @Wontconform11 "trusting the plan" is just a way to keep us quiet with our heads in the sand. If this is the plan, it needs to change. We the people have been cheated &amp; lied to enough. The only plan I see is America being destroyed, the plan was always to destroy America.
1333871439963779073 2020-12-02 04:31:48 +0800 <myopinion6810> @GeraldoRivera @realdonaldtrum @JoeBiden If the fraudulent votes are certified there will be NO future fair elections in the US. If the courts set precedent for fraudulent elections we will forever have fraudulent elections. And in that moment we will have become Venezuela. There will NEVER be a fair election again.
1333659821187375108 2020-12-01 14:30:54 +0800 <myopinion6810> @realDonaldTrump A lot of Americans are very happy you came along, also very grateful for fighting for us and our great nation. We are looking forward to 4 more years of the greatest president EVER, President Donald J. Trump. Thank you.

The citizens mean nothing him, he will lock down the city, destroy lives and business while he enjoys his family and holidays.
1331991465988292608 2020-11-27 00:01:27 +0800 <myopinion6810> @sadein @MayorHancock @CityofDenver @KS1075 You are worried about giving repubs ammo? I thought people would be worried about spreading the virus since it is so deadly we have to lock down. Clearly this is all political. We are just the subjugated fools who have to suffer under liberal rule.
1331989439308959745 2020-11-26 23:53:24 +0800 <myopinion6810> @MayorHancock If you were sincere with your apology, you would lift all restrictions you have imposed for every resident of Denver and then resign. Clearly, you are incapable of leading because your decisions are made with your heart and are not made for the betterment of Denver.

1331791129012883456 2020-11-26 10:45:23 +0800 <myopinion6810> @CBSNews Joe Biden becomes the first presidential candidate in U.S. history to surpass 50 million fraudulent votes (I fixed it for you)
1331785700740452352 2020-11-26 10:23:49 +0800 <myopinion6810> @MayorHancock So what you're saying is that if we visit family we cannot get nor give the virus? If you really thought there was a chance your family could get it, &amp; it was as deadly as people say, a good father &amp; husband wouldn't expose their family to something so deadly we have to shut down
1331778256744321024 2020-11-26 09:54:14 +0800 <myopinion6810> @MayorHancock What about our decision made with our heart? Like business wanting to stay open because it's been in their family for years and in their "heart" they don't want to have to close the doors? Good decision from the heart.
1331733167963660288 2020-11-26 06:55:04 +0800 <myopinion6810> @willchamberlain If this election is certified, the courts will have set precedent to allow fraudulent elections in America. If that happens there is no movement, there are no future elections, there is nothing left of America. These are facts.

1330377880170270724 2020-11-22 13:09:38 +0800 <myopinion6810> @liquidlaugh No! It's that simple and Hillary didn't win the popular vote and the house didn't gain all those seats in 18. The fraud has been happening for a long time, this time though @realDonaldTrump win was so large the fraud was exposed.
1330304618174296068 2020-11-22 08:18:31 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Shellythede @MikePM87509448 @LLinWood @GOP @realDonaldTrump Shelly, it doesn't matter if they agree or not, they work for us. We the people give them money, time and votes without us they are nothing. We need to start reminding them of that and hold strong together.
1330302685057343491 2020-11-22 08:10:50 +0800 <myopinion6810> @EricMMatheny I think they cheated then too, Hillary probably didn't get the popular vote, I just think it wasn't as extensive as it was this time.
1330298692079939585 2020-11-22 07:54:58 +0800 <myopinion6810> @ScottBaio Typical liberal! they are so used to getting handouts and being lazy and led around like sheep they can't even use Twitter without help. Sad, useless, pathetic people.

Who told the poll workers to run ballots multiple times? Who researched all the dead people that voted? Who did ALL of this? We need to find out who all was behind this!
1330281458137706503 2020-11-22 06:46:29 +0800 <myopinion6810> @jeremyfaust Being that you work in the ER you might want to call down for a psych eval. And please for the sake of everyone stop practicing until you get some psych help.
1330254645659316229 2020-11-22 04:59:57 +0800 <myopinion6810> @gatewaypundit That's why they kept saying Texas was in play because they were cheating there also!! We need to audit all states.

1330029938024607745 2020-11-21 14:07:02 +0800 <myopinion6810> @kaitlancollins It doesn't matter if he answers or not, all you reporters are going to spin whatever he says and does to something negative so why bother. We all see what you do and how much you all hate America. You are the enemy of the people.

This has to really make their family members happy🤦‍♀️. Then you wonder why nobody cares about any of these awards
1329861960775548928 2020-11-21 02:59:33 +0800 <myopinion6810> @GeraldoRivera You should tell that to all the democrats who refuse to leave
1329842236419260416 2020-11-21 01:41:11 +0800 <myopinion6810> @HillaryClinton Totally agree! @BarackObama should just admit @realDonaldTrump THE greatest president in modern history. Obama helped Joementia with the fraud &amp; he should tell him to concede. &amp; talk about ego STOP writing books about yourselves THAT is egotistical &amp; all of you are guilty of it.
1329695635084247040 2020-11-20 15:58:38 +0800 <myopinion6810> @JonathanTurley As an attorney, I would think you would be smart enough to know that without seeing the evidence, which nobody has yet, you would know better than to label anything a conspiracy theory. Liberalism really does bing out the stupid in so many...it's sad.
1329693268938944512 2020-11-20 15:49:14 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Joy_Villa @DIO_tiama @IngrahamAngle @JennaEllisEsq So @IngrahamAngle attacks @JennaEllisEsq, @TuckerCarlson attacks @SidneyPowell1, what's next @seanhannity attacking @RudyGiuliani? Glad I stopped watching.
1329692626405113857 2020-11-20 15:46:41 +0800 <myopinion6810> @thehill So what you're saying is 54% DO NOT want him to concede. Take that &amp; add about 10% for your dem leaning poll so now we're up to 64%. Then we all know how pollsters lie so add another 10 that brings us to 74% now lets cover the media lies with 10 now 84%. That is closer to reality
1329690367688548352 2020-11-20 15:37:42 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Binks_MamaBear Also, who gave the order to USPS to change dates? This had to have come down a long line of people, so how many people in USPS knew?
1329689273314865152 2020-11-20 15:33:21 +0800 <myopinion6810> @PhoenixRisingU @pinkk9lover I totally agree WE are the majority. I keep saying this. There are more of us than there are of them. MSM wants us to believe that conservatives, and especially Trump supporters are the minority, that info coming from them proves we are the majority. MSM lies.
1329651794880864258 2020-11-20 13:04:26 +0800 <myopinion6810> @ClimateAudit @RaheemKassam She doesn't have to show anybody her cards except a court. I'm sure a judge would not appreciate evidence being presented to the media before the court gets to review it. Her loyalty is to her client, whether we like it or not, and to ask for any more is selfish and foolish.

What a good Christian you are I will pray for you. May you truly find God.

1329530405125550083 2020-11-20 05:02:04 +0800 <myopinion6810> @InfidelAngela Because the majority of Americans don't have liberal views. The media wants us to believe they are the majority but, we know they are liars. There are more of us than there are of them.

Anybody with a brain can see this whole election was fraudulent. Multiple levels and layers of fraud. 3. If you, as the person overseeing elections, don't see that, resign and stop embarrassing yourself and NM.

Do you understand that is this fraudulent election is certified America is gone forever. If you don't see the fraud because of your hate for Trump, you need to get over that and open your eyes and see it out of love for America.

That and Santa Fe are the areas most filled with not New Mexicans they're more people frome CA in Taos and Santa Fe than anywhere else in NM.

Republicans better start stepping up to fight for us with @realDonaldTrump or we will replace you.

Other than people telling you to hate, you probably don't even know why you hate. I thought liberals believed in science, the data is in front of you stop denying science.
1329243375531225089 2020-11-19 10:01:31 +0800 <myopinion6810> @realDonaldTrump @justin_hart Hadn't they stopped counting votes at that time? How did he get so many in the middle of the night when they weren't counting votes? Were there witnesses to these counts? This is election fraud! America with this type of fraudulent elections is Venezuela, we can't let this stand

1329203019213283328 2020-11-19 07:21:09 +0800 <myopinion6810> @ewarren Have the universities refund the money. If democrats are pushing for income equality, have teachers start teaching without pay and universities start refunding money to anybody who has received a degree from them.

We know that's all you praise because thats who you are. Stop pretending you didn't do this to America we know you and your puppets were behind this fraud
1328867927336968192 2020-11-18 09:09:37 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SpeakerPelosi Now you want to talk for the sake of the country! Before the election it was for the sake of politics. We see right through your hypocrisy and lies. If you are so worried about Americans then do a stand alone bill without any democratic interests getting millions.

I don't know if you understand the amount of gratitude we have for what you are doing. Thank you does not seem to be enough, may God bless you, the team, all your families, @realDonaldTrump &amp; America. Thank you.

We all keep saying the MSM is lying to us yet we believe there are more democrats in America?!? Stop! They are just using that to justify a lot of cheating, &amp; to have us believe there is "50%" of America that is on "the other side" WE ARE THE MAJORITY

1328819415543005184 2020-11-18 05:56:51 +0800 <myopinion6810> @RepBarbaraLee Well then we really need the Democrats to be invested and thrown in prison for 2016, 2018 and for the astronomical amount of fraud they committed in 2020. Step up and hold your party to account. That would be inspiring.
1328818423065841664 2020-11-18 05:52:54 +0800 <myopinion6810> @tbeaux29 IF they do, it won't be because of the FBI or CIA or any American institution, it'll be because another country has enough guts to stand by their laws regardless of who broke them. What's so funny is this is where Jomentia went to "clean up" the fraud. You can't make this shit up

1328799699969605632 2020-11-18 04:38:31 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SenSchumer Well then just include Americans in crisis not universities and museums and all the other democratic special interests Americans can no longer afford to support.

1328555575668482048 2020-11-17 12:28:27 +0800 <myopinion6810> @EdMarkey When you say forgiven what exactly do you mean by that? Loans are not forgiven without some collateral trade. What is the trade?

Everybody who is honest with themselves knows this was a rigged fraudulent election, when will we the American people get justice for the crimes against us?

They have deep pockets and have been making millions, so much so they pay people who don't even work there as well as many other thing they should have nothing to do with.

1328363856087838720 2020-11-16 23:46:37 +0800 <myopinion6810> @KamalaHarris So your plan is to have all the democrat governors shut down their states now so in January they can open up and claim you did something. We see your lies.
1328360511117791232 2020-11-16 23:33:20 +0800 <myopinion6810> @realDonaldTrump They do it so they can convince their sheep Joementia won, so when you are certified the winner, their sheep will create more havoc and destroy what they haven't yet, then they'll try to blame you. But, we see the truth and we support you.

So you are stupid enough to believe the Covid, your mother probably paid to bring here, because democrats can't win elections fairly, could harm your parents through outside their house? And when your mom's stops bitching about her astonishing loss, so will we.
1328149422165929985 2020-11-16 09:34:32 +0800 <myopinion6810> @DC_Draino I don't even watch them. No Fox at all, if Tucker and Hannity wanted to be heard by us they would move to a network that isn't betraying us.
1328148972750442496 2020-11-16 09:32:45 +0800 <myopinion6810> @billyrojo @ScottBaio You have all been programed &amp; brainwashed into believing crap that isn't even true or real. Do you really think Joementia &amp; Harris are so clean in all they've done? What about all the Hunter BS? And the cancer nonprofit? And bailing out terrorists? Wake up you've been fooled

You liberals are lunatics putting your feelings &amp; who screwed who ahead of America, while at the same time praising pedophiles. You have so much hate for Trump &amp; this country &amp; you don't even know why.

But, by the same token if this fraudulent election is certified I will never support another candidate of any party. Why waste time effort and energy and money for it to be stolen. If they get away with it now, they will continue forever.
1327725955171815424 2020-11-15 05:31:50 +0800 <myopinion6810> @BillOReilly I continue to say if this fraud of an election is certified we will NEVER have a fair election again. Which will mean America will be gone forever. Why vote, contribute or volunteer for any candidate when it will just be stolen in the end. This will be the end of America.

If fraud is allowed to decide the President now, then it will be allowed in every future election and our vote will never matter again and America will gone forever.

Just like they did this time. So really why bother voting or campaigning or donating to candidates when it won't matter...

We have no say or representation it all just a facade, they have fooled us into believing we have a say, we don't. We have nothing, not even a country, this is worse than Venezuela.
1326927445543411714 2020-11-13 00:38:50 +0800 <myopinion6810> @PamelaGeller 100% True why vote if it will just be stolen? And if our vote won't count why support any candidate? They will just steal the election anyway. If this is not fixed @GOP will never get any $ from the people. I think we will all be pretty much done with any elections.

The election and Covid, just another way for the government to control Americans. We can never believe anything they tell us. They lied about Covid &amp; the election is fraudulent. It's all a fraud!

1326770571829534720 2020-11-12 14:15:29 +0800 <myopinion6810> @LouDobbs @SidneyPowell1 At what point do we, as a nation, openly admit the fraud in this election is so astronomical &amp; done to favor one party so that leads to only 1 conclusion @realDonaldTrump won. As did many if not all the Rs. This cannot be allowed to continue to destroy our country.

1326716954212626433 2020-11-12 10:42:25 +0800 <myopinion6810> @InfidelAngela Oh it's not hard at all, just ask Joementia and Hunter all you need to know is how much money you want for selling out America.
1326695801066844161 2020-11-12 09:18:22 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Surgeon_General A vaccine for something with a 99.5% survival rate? Maybe higher because you all lied about the numbers so we will never know the real numbers but I know if you lie about the numbers I don't trust you with anything else.

Why drag America through all this. People are very stressed over this. There is no reason to drag this out any longer. We know there was fraud. Make arrests or stop the BS

If Joementia really got that many votes dems should be jumping at the chance to prove it.
1326359052515995649 2020-11-11 11:00:15 +0800 <myopinion6810> @FairyQ15 @pinkk9lover Oh No!!! Now what will Joementia give Hunter to celebrate the China deal???
1326357305236058112 2020-11-11 10:53:18 +0800 <myopinion6810> @RyanLizza @AlxThomp The biggest break with tradition is the astronomical amount of voter fraud perpetrated by the democrats that was so obvious because their candidate was losing so bad their computer program to switch @realDonaldTrump votes to Joementia couldn't keep up with Joementia loss.
1326354494284845056 2020-11-11 10:42:08 +0800 <myopinion6810> @JoeBiden We never left. You just didn't see us because you were in you basement selling us out with your son to multiple countries who hate us just like you do.

1326346721161404416 2020-11-11 10:11:15 +0800 <myopinion6810> @CaliTrumpLady @NAForCongress Unfortunately I think you are correct in your thinking. If this is not fixed America will cease to exist as we know it. Our 1A &amp; 2A will quickly be removed and we will become worse than Venezuela. Our votes will NEVER count again.
1326309411267125249 2020-11-11 07:42:59 +0800 <myopinion6810> @EvanAKilgore No and if this fraud is not fixed America can NEVER trust any election again.

Because the media has told us this, we have to question everything we've been told. Why did we all think Hillary would win? Because they told us. If we sit here and accept it we lose.
1326239514587615232 2020-11-11 03:05:15 +0800 <myopinion6810> @USMCMIL03 I think absolutely yes. Also, the democratic primary, remember Joementia didn't even run in the first states and Bernie was winning then all of a sudden Bernie started losing??? No way! Bernie Bros were very organized and again Joementia didn't even campaign.

What if they are wrong and have just conditioned us to believe that and the whole thing is fraud and we won in CA &amp; NY but we don't question it.

What do they have planned? Poor she was never going to get in the white house even after all the abuse she put Joementia through

We all know what happens to people coming out against democrats. @AOC has already started a list of us Patriots that she can use to do whatever other evil they have planned, so seriously he needs protection.

"Wait till you see" "wait till it's exposed" "wait for arrested" "when you see" either show us or tell us or stay quiet. America is being stolen &amp; destroyed &amp; everyone is telling us to wait.

They blatantly did that and we sat and did nothing about it. They went to China in late Oct. Or early Nov and released it on us so they could steal the presidency.
1324855392753651714 2020-11-07 07:25:14 +0800 <myopinion6810> @BorisDPython @JuliansRum Oh ok sorry my misunderstanding. Idk if I have any faith in that anymore, been waiting too long and haven't seen anything.

I don't know what you have seen or heard but even without the videos I've seen, everything else imo proves fraud.

You do understand they are not only stealing the Presidency they are stealing America. 2022 midterms??? So ya let's just look to 2022 because they'll not cheat them just watch. Or maybe 2024 maybe we return to Englands rule.

If you don't think that's fraud you really need to wake up. It's not about Trump it's about America.
1324828052904382465 2020-11-07 05:36:36 +0800 <myopinion6810> @mattgaetz If we don't stand up and fight now, forget elections, America will be gone forever. As it looks now we are turning into Venezuela, there will be no more elections @AOC is asking for people to start lists of our names to be able to use for whatever evil plan they have.

Why don't they come out &amp; tell us everything America is being stolen and I am tired of hearing. We have this, we have that, wait and see. Time to wait is over.
1324808196654047232 2020-11-07 04:17:42 +0800 <myopinion6810> @GeorgePapa19 Well if they're "caught" then why is nobody being areested and why is America still being stolen?

Do you honestly think they would just rig a few states? They why so long for Alaska? They did it everywhere. Some house &amp; senate seats have been stolen and we are allowing it by not demanding audits of all 50
1324781280588804096 2020-11-07 02:30:45 +0800 <myopinion6810> @TheMikeClayton8 I agree I think we need to start thinking of how we are going to fight to save America.
1324780855043055616 2020-11-07 02:29:03 +0800 <myopinion6810> @prayingmedic I think at this point we need to start thinking of a citizens Army to fight for America. This is starting to look like we might need another revolutionary war to keep our freedoms.

1324774419131113475 2020-11-07 02:03:29 +0800 <myopinion6810> Why is it all the democrats encourage riots when they don't get their way. But Republicans always tell us stay calm stay civil. Because there are more of us and we would destroy all of them. We need to start considering how are we going to fight back.

If we can come back from the worst in history, due to a pandemic that China caused, and have the best in history while democrats are still pushing the fear mongering bs, that is another reason to vote for Trump.

Did you research Tony Bobulinskis claims? Or the investigation into the Bidens? Or the cages Joe built or the damage to the economy Joe will cause or are you just sipping on your koolaid.

1319502038615707653 2020-10-23 12:52:55 +0800 <myopinion6810> @realDonaldTrump You were so amazing tonight!!!

1319500651769090048 2020-10-23 12:47:25 +0800 <myopinion6810> @JoeBiden We do know who you are. You are a bought &amp; paid for puppet. China Ukraine &amp; whoever else paid you off will control the US if people vote for you. You will kill oil &amp; gas &amp; we'll be paying $5+ for gas like when u were in office before. No thanks just quit &amp; stay in your basement.

1312625033819291650 2020-10-04 13:26:10 +0800 <myopinion6810> @mamazen123 @SenWarren To be clear I said "politicians" meaning ALL politicians. If I can go to work &amp; grocery store workers can go to work &amp; everyone else out there working during all this, the politicians should go to work also. They need to stop with the excuses and do their job. All of them.
1312621674320125953 2020-10-04 13:12:49 +0800 <myopinion6810> @mamazen123 @SenWarren PS I'm an RN, thanks, a lot of people have been at work, thanks for proving my point. Politicians are not better than us. If we made it to work they should as well. That's the problem they make excuses not to work and everyone allows them to get away with it.
1312619865815961600 2020-10-04 13:05:37 +0800 <myopinion6810> @mamazen123 @SenWarren Are grocery store workers present at their job? Medical workers? Truck drivers? School staff? Yes, they all are, so are many others. The senate is much safer compared to all those and many of those are exposed to a bunch of people who won't wear masks. Dems are full of excuses.
1312251374298566656 2020-10-03 12:41:22 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SenWarren If you are incapable of doing your job, which is very safe compared to others, like medical staff, grocery store workers etc, perhaps you should consider stepping down so someone more capable can actually do the job instead.

1308516270308954112 2020-09-23 05:19:24 +0800 <myopinion6810> @5stringer6 @alexnazaryan We have heard so many different stories it does sound like a hoax. At first Pelosi and others were telling everyone go out and shop and go to Chinatown, then they want to blame Trump, which is stupid. He didn't bring it here and he didn't create it China did.
1308515839881011200 2020-09-23 05:17:41 +0800 <myopinion6810> @5stringer6 @alexnazaryan Ok, he did, multiple doctors said hydroxychloriquine worked &amp; every democrat went crazy because big pharma couldn't make money off a cheap drug. And guess what it works. What have the scientists said? 1st don't wear masks then everyone needs a mask they don't even know what to do
1308515005453668352 2020-09-23 05:14:22 +0800 <myopinion6810> @5stringer6 @alexnazaryan So you basically want for America to shut down and hide over something that has a .001% death rate? Should we stop driving that's deadlier? Should we stay locked in our homes forever? I have not heard him say it is a hoax (I don't watch much news).

1308252857485803520 2020-09-22 11:52:42 +0800 <myopinion6810> @RichardDawkins We can all depend on the government for our healthcare decisions because goodness knows the government always gets everything right. Or, better yet, why not just send those who don't want the liberties afforded to them by this great country to North Korea, it's the same thing.
1308252124958961664 2020-09-22 11:49:47 +0800 <myopinion6810> @RichardDawkins So then why not give up all our personal liberties? Stop selling vehicles, alcohol, tobacco, any gmo food or any other thing that the government or doctors say will harm you or others, or that have harmed anybody in the past. Like trampolines or eggs not cooked enough...

1308241392322228224 2020-09-22 11:07:08 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SouthernGirlNLA @McBelleCat Large populations can't over power us and we can't remove their voice. This is the only way for both to be heard. If it was a democracy only cities would have a say. That's why a republic works.

But the rural area needs the cities just like the cities need us. The difference is we don't have the population but we still need to be heard. That is precisely why this system works...

When you do they usually turn out wrong because you do not look at facts only feelings. That is how the democrats control you.

1308229515873644544 2020-09-22 10:19:56 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SouthernGirlNLA @McBelleCat So please tell me who provides the water you drink? Who picks up your trash? Who maintains the roads around your home? The government does in cities. I know there are fewer people that live in rural America, you proved my point, why should we not have a voice.

1308208184524337153 2020-09-22 08:55:11 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SouthernGirlNLA @McBelleCat Liberals couldn't survive in rural America. There are no starbucks and we eat meat you can't find soy in the stores here. And if they did move to rural America they would change their way of thinking before their next ballot is cast.

Or would you just have their ideals ignored so the coasts control the country? Would you also ignore the smaller states commerce, like farming, ranching oil and the like?
1308175212769206272 2020-09-22 06:44:10 +0800 <myopinion6810> @DeanObeidallah Sounds like a great plan, but you get to stop taking ALL federal assistance and commerce. You all support yourselves.
1308136598324666370 2020-09-22 04:10:43 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SenKamalaHarris Based on the treatment given to Justice Kavanaugh, if I were in charge of the Senate I would not even hold hearings. There is no constitutional rule mandating hearings and based upon the democrats reaction, it isn't worth watching you democrats embarrass our nation. #NoHearings
1308067505223598081 2020-09-21 23:36:10 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Proven_Right @realDonaldTrump Yup!!

1307395869335982080 2020-09-20 03:07:20 +0800 <myopinion6810> @joy_gimbel @2bCarlisa @Yamiche Sounds like a great plan, less liberal nuts procreating and passing the stupid gene to their kids or raising them to be fools. Keep up the no sex thing for the next 100 years. The world will be a better place.
1307370117869649920 2020-09-20 01:25:00 +0800 <myopinion6810> @LauraLitvan And this is why we believe the press has become the enemy of the people.

1307174778675945472 2020-09-19 12:28:48 +0800 <myopinion6810> @rezaaslan The liberals have been burning stuff for quite a while now so as you queen has said in the past...what difference does it make. Liberals are so destructive at this point, the threats are really not threatening anymore, so just stop embarrassing yourself.
1307113719202185216 2020-09-19 08:26:10 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SenSchumer Our voices were heard in 2016 for exactly these reasons. If you don't like what we said maybe you should leave office because you sir did not and are not listening to the American people. @realDonaldTrump is president and has a duty to us to fill this seat ASAP.
1307112890818846723 2020-09-19 08:22:52 +0800 <myopinion6810> @tony3879 Everything you stated is happening because idiots have refused to accept defeat &amp; only want to make decisions based on their feelings. Totally weak and stupid and what you are saying about America is full of hate so this is your choice to hate. It's on you.

1307106252426801154 2020-09-19 07:56:30 +0800 <myopinion6810> @suitablegirl @justinjm1 @VArobertivna It's NOT her seat. The seat belongs to the American people. The fact that anybody would assume she has any right to claim a SCOTUS seat as belonging them is very troubling at best. If she had been a judge for all people not just liberals she &amp; the liberals would realize that.
1304259136851513344 2020-09-11 11:23:04 +0800 <myopinion6810> @mmpadellan Able to see, no more no less. If you paid to be able see a movie, and you got to the theater and before the movie started you had to watch a video of the highlights of a trump rally would you be pissed? People paid to go see football not anything else.
1304257864844947463 2020-09-11 11:18:01 +0800 <myopinion6810> @mmpadellan Yes that is what fans want. They paid to watch a game not to watch a "unity statement" or any other statement. If they wanted to see anything having to do with any movement they could stay home &amp; watch the news. When you pay to watch something that's what you should be...1/2
1302416935775162368 2020-09-06 09:22:49 +0800 <myopinion6810> @SenSchumer @SenSanders You and the rest of the democrats forgot about the peaceful transfer of power in 2016 and now you are blatantly stating you want to steal the election. We haven't even voted yet &amp; you are threatening to remove the dually elected president? Why would he leave? #Trump2020Landslide
1302308338638573568 2020-09-06 02:11:18 +0800 <myopinion6810> @chiiizzllee @LastTellurian I don't listen to thugs. Nobody does that is my point. Thugs destroying property, stealing, threatening people &amp; police do not deserve to be heard. Their voice was shut down the second their criminal activity began. Their behavior is disgusting &amp; unworthy of my time.
1302283414184230912 2020-09-06 00:32:15 +0800 <myopinion6810> @chiiizzllee @LastTellurian Nobody said "every black person" you're the one who said "we are loud and rioting" so whoever the we is that you refer to that are rioting, they are thugs. Anybody rioting looting destroying property, burning stuff, blocking roads, attacking police &amp; the general public is a thug.
1302266318318575623 2020-09-05 23:24:19 +0800 <myopinion6810> @chiiizzllee @LastTellurian Nobody is listening to you now because the message being presented is blm/antifa represents people who chose to be criminals &amp; only want to loot, set fires &amp; riot. If there is/was another message they were wanting people to hear they screwed it up because nobody listens to thugs.
1302264098273419266 2020-09-05 23:15:30 +0800 <myopinion6810> @chiiizzllee @LastTellurian If you "riot" and consider that speaking for yourself, then you need to really consider the message you are sending. The actions of blm &amp; antifa are terrorist actions. If you don't get that, then you need to open your eyes to reality.
1302246892923879425 2020-09-05 22:07:08 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Sulliview So what you're saying is the American people have a higher chance of getting killed by a protester than dying from Covid.
1302132697410621440 2020-09-05 14:33:22 +0800 <myopinion6810> @Cleavon_MD @realDonaldTrump @BreitbartNews @FoxNews If you base your vote on any media claim you are foolish. The media is playing the veterans, anyone being honest with themselves and is not suffering from TDS can see that.

1300974676592570368 2020-09-02 09:51:48 +0800 <myopinion6810> @AximNYC I am an RN, and just to keep up with your liberal hate. I don't work for anybody, because I am a republican I learned at an early age to work hard, so actually others work for me. What have you done with your life other than have and wait for your government check?

In your last 2 tweets you just proved why people believe lefty liberals are evil. You spew BS fed to you by the democrats keeping you fooled. You regurgitate lies while trying to blame others for the failures of the dems. Sad

To have multiple arrests and still continue to break laws?   Where's the humanity in that??? Is that what you teach your children?  I have no sympathy for thugs. They chose to break the law.
1300938293777846272 2020-09-02 07:27:14 +0800 <myopinion6810> @ResistSister111 @SwaggyVader @SpeakerPelosi @GOP You do realize your statement is total lies What red welfare state are you talking about Its proven more dems on welfare than reps that is how the dems control their voter base keep them dependent on gov funds so they can never advance. Look at you now begging for more gov help.

1300629466788409344 2020-09-01 11:00:04 +0800 <myopinion6810> @JoeBiden While you've been in your basement he's been saying that for months!! Wake up!
