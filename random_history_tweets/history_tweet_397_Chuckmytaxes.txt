1344045123110318080 2020-12-30 06:18:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Doesn't have to be either or... some of us would like to have both.
1344044799444312068 2020-12-30 06:17:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Biden is bad for _____. Unless you're a family member, he's bad for just about anything.
1344044575665610752 2020-12-30 06:16:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Over my dead body...
1344043201292873730 2020-12-30 06:10:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If this (fill in the blank) numb skull gets in the White House, this is all we'll see are "hey, you said this a week ago, and now you're saying something entirely different but still blaming someone else."
1344042266676109313 2020-12-30 06:07:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson @laurafut_laura @DNI_Ratcliffe Whatever happened to that report from Trump's 2018 EO?
1343932165126549505 2020-12-29 22:49:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LaurenWitzkeDE @hootie39588772 I love simple math.
1343931442175344643 2020-12-29 22:46:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He should stay exactly where he's at. Representative Jones can do a lot of good in the position he's in right now.
1343928366374785024 2020-12-29 22:34:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @drdavidsamadi I have to imagine there were doctors dancing too just to show solidarity. Yah, that was a unionized pun.
1343908488716677120 2020-12-29 21:15:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GatorgirlAZ @Can2geterdone So, we need a list of states that has received Covid$. I'm sure we'll see a pattern there.
1343907203791679495 2020-12-29 21:10:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SandyForLiberty Whaddya mean "starting?" Shouldn't that be going on already? What Einstein Legislators kept that from happening?
1343906649287880706 2020-12-29 21:08:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Seems like cheating is ok. Just like premarital sex.
1343795950129721347 2020-12-29 13:48:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ksorbs Or how about a good ole fashion SEC and IRS audit...

1343579300004560897 2020-12-28 23:27:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Isn't that how Social Security Insurance started?!? Universal income is just another way of getting more Democrats elected because every 4 years we'll here how much more they're going to give us if only we elected them. Isn't SSI always in political rhetoric?
1343404642538049537 2020-12-28 11:53:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @m_keenum @DrShayPhD He also knows when he gets back in he'll EO everything he doesn't want.
1343393049943154689 2020-12-28 11:07:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep... nope that'll never happen. None of it. It'll get signed, but our Reps aren't going to give an inch to what Trump wants.

1343391465154744321 2020-12-28 11:00:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So he's the Lee Harvey Oswald in this scenario?
1343333527358681090 2020-12-28 07:10:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RobertPLewis Almost as quickly as Hunter's laptop or Tara Reade's sexual assault accusation against Biden.

1343004590111936512 2020-12-27 09:23:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Also need $300 (at least) for Q1 2021 in unemployment. Here in Michigan everything is still at a standstill andbut will take being open for 90 days just get the momentum back.
1342932765059276800 2020-12-27 04:38:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @joshdcaplan So no drone footage of the area. Yep, this is the beginning of the American Communist Party.
1342878565315072002 2020-12-27 01:02:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kimKBaltimore @BaltCoExec My heart rate goes up 20 points when wearing a mask vs not. I even spent $30 on a "breathable" mask from Under Armour.
1342877442873167872 2020-12-27 00:58:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I've never felt bad for actors but after seeing WW84 yesterday (Christmas trading to take kids to the movies Christmas night to be together and wind down). But I wish I could get my 2 hours back. I wish I could get my $90 back. I wish WW84 was a helluva like the first one.
1342842146190188544 2020-12-26 22:38:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LadyRedWave @ArjParish ACP? American Communist Party
1342837772273512448 2020-12-26 22:20:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He's emboldened by Chinese money.
1342836516708618241 2020-12-26 22:15:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Assuming we're able to habe clean elections. I still believe McConnell won by the same fraud we're saying won the election for Biden.
1342630797325578244 2020-12-26 08:38:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BobbyPiton3 I love super smart people. That's it. That's the message!
1342622823479726080 2020-12-26 08:06:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DC_Draino It's proof that if you're a Democrat, you can literally get away with anything.
1342543062904557571 2020-12-26 02:49:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KFILE Hearts broken for your family's tragic loss. Many prayers for peace and strength. üôèüôèüí™üôè

1342513238492258304 2020-12-26 00:51:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PatriciaBride @easkelson And so it returns

1342195827289296897 2020-12-25 03:49:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> But SCOTUS will get around to hearing about it after Joe's inauguration.

1342156190307016704 2020-12-25 01:12:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Maybe they'll get Hollywood Relief Bill passed once the Socialists take over. I hear they're pretty lucrative.
1342098070037815297 2020-12-24 21:21:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BoffinNoddy Yes, we have a strict rule on our house there's no running with scissors.
1342097126432632836 2020-12-24 21:17:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @m_keenum Number one reason we're following you!!
1341990994842152960 2020-12-24 14:16:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because it doesn't matter. Just like it doesn't matter who the Democrats put in the WH. It's not like they're making things happen. Their puppet masters are in charge.
1341976803716562945 2020-12-24 13:19:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Funny, we don't hear that from Fox News.
1341919546584788993 2020-12-24 09:32:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @NicoleArbour Get some rest. You'll be right as rain in no time.
1341917899645210624 2020-12-24 09:25:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @tedcruz @easkelson Now this is a man I'd like to sit down and have a cognac and cigar with. Imagine the stories you'd hear by the time you got to the meat of the cigar!

1341767092157231104 2020-12-23 23:26:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mtowen2 @laurafut_laura Can someone get this guy a pardon, please?
1341766927023222784 2020-12-23 23:25:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I hate Fox News. Even listening to Glenn Beck, I ha e to mute the radio when they broadcast 5 minute clips at the top and bottom of each hour. They're Left and they've been left for the past 2 decades.
1341766377045155841 2020-12-23 23:23:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You mean you didn't see it when the President said two months ago when you turned down the last offer. Or the fact you didn't ask in your negotiations, what does the President want? Lie to someone else. I'm sick of it.
1341765175729385475 2020-12-23 23:18:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can we really think about replacing the soon retiring McConnell with Rand Paul? @RandPaul
1341764775131410433 2020-12-23 23:17:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's the 80/20 rule... 20% for US and 80% for them. That's how Congress appropriates everything.
1341764198003568640 2020-12-23 23:14:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GeorgePapa19 Congratulations George. On behalf of the American people, we're sorry you even had to go through this.
1341745181280915458 2020-12-23 21:59:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And according to Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell,  we should be grateful it was that much. How'd they come up with that number? Don't tell me budget constraints when arguing over the penny jar.
1341743859232075782 2020-12-23 21:53:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Democrats and Never Trumper Republicans stole the first 4 years.
1341742699133743106 2020-12-23 21:49:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> 10 months of this for $3200 (or as LG wants it $1800)? Yah, that seems fair. Get us back to work. We were doing just fine inspite of you.
1341741651652456448 2020-12-23 21:45:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We can't be bought while others don't know any better,  yet.
1341741006979559428 2020-12-23 21:42:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's "Self-Appointed- President-Elect" to you mister.

1341737729646858240 2020-12-23 21:29:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes but did they shred the fat?
1341737133426524160 2020-12-23 21:27:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So when they "negotiated" the amounts to give to foreign countries, was there a time they said we need to give more so we'll just take it out of the taxpayer's portion, they'll take whatever we give them and they'll be grateful?
1341736297514319872 2020-12-23 21:23:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> First laugh of the day, thanks Matt!!!
1341735816020828160 2020-12-23 21:22:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Too many to count, that's why.
1341601455770361858 2020-12-23 12:28:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can we back up the truck?
1341600248762945536 2020-12-23 12:23:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He should have added, "We're going to make sure of it."
1341599600608768002 2020-12-23 12:20:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert Its like giving your kid $20 as he is walking out the door so he can take of himself and he just hands it to his friend.
1341556686742536198 2020-12-23 09:30:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Veto!!!

1341313185148760065 2020-12-22 17:22:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just like Obamacare
1341312868927610880 2020-12-22 17:21:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I propose DJT read on tv ALL of the pork in this bill and who proposed that it be there. This will tell us exactly who wants America first and who wants to continue to redistribute our wealth. Hopefully that would shine a light on how the next 400 years will be with Biden. VETO!!

1341308866517233669 2020-12-22 17:05:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Who comes up with this crap?
1341234253787504641 2020-12-22 12:08:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @HawleyMO It's not worth it. There should be very few pages to this bill. As soon as you heard it was almost 5k pgs, that's an automatic "No."
1341221166174900226 2020-12-22 11:16:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RepMattGaetz Don't you have to have a rise in the cost of living in nnmmlm order to get COLA? Last time I looked inflation was next to zero bec3you nitwits put a full stop on employment growth.
1341111364320980993 2020-12-22 04:00:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Thank God, a mask that actually won't suffocate you.
1341080455639011329 2020-12-22 01:57:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Right where we left off, when the economy was the best world has ever seen...
1341080208506576898 2020-12-22 01:56:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, how much does a soul bring in nowadays? Asking for a friend.
1341076191860699137 2020-12-22 01:40:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because he's a Democrat.
1341022727524786176 2020-12-21 22:08:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wow, good talk... So, our progressives want to look like the heroes in March when they have to pass another stimulus check?
1341022208412569606 2020-12-21 22:06:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JesseKellyDC Or underwear still folded with almost nothing in the laundry bag... have 5 kids, yep it happens.
1341021853792526337 2020-12-21 22:04:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> What's the population of eligible voters in the 477 counties that Joe (I have 81m votes, and average of 170,000 votes per county) and then subtract how many votes went to "Not Biden." Do you think there'll be any discrepancies?
1340978724280414208 2020-12-21 19:13:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Or give us their pipeline of insider information so we can turn our $600 into a few million.
1340860308236201986 2020-12-21 11:23:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gatewaypundit It's not like anyone was going to watch anyway... he should hit up Greg Kelly or Chanel over at OANN.
1340847373753446401 2020-12-21 10:31:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklutchman I'd say start perp walks for the election supervisors who orchestrated this coup.

1340819187598548992 2020-12-21 08:39:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So why did Nancy take half of what was offered just two months ago? Shows you exactly what bureaucrats really think of us.
1340818359609405440 2020-12-21 08:36:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep... Trump wanted $2k... Mitch doesn't want to increase the deficit, well that's an easy fix... stop giving money to cities who send it to their lobbyists and special interest groups.
1340817468810555393 2020-12-21 08:32:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson The easiest way to become richer is to make everyone poorer around you.

1340815586323030024 2020-12-21 08:25:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> All due respect,  there are bigger concerns like keeping our country from Dictatorship because if they get their way, we won't really have to worry about singing in Church.

1340418997649551361 2020-12-20 06:09:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The 1776 Revolution was started by colonists planning at churches, taverns and restaurants. What's closed now? They're going to do worse things than this because we are now sufficiently divided.
1340417270565236738 2020-12-20 06:02:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ArmyBratt68 Where are you moving?
1340415826311168001 2020-12-20 05:56:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert @tedcruz He kinda looks like a badass
1340412267456847874 2020-12-20 05:42:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KelemenCari Let's do this!!
1340402447249002496 2020-12-20 05:03:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can we just get rid of Hedge Fund companies altogether? They're good to launder money, bankrupt good companies and manipulating stock prices for their benefit. Just ask Jim Cramer. They do not provide liquidity or Investigative data in financial statements. They're just evil.
1340400427712524290 2020-12-20 04:55:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Trump knew China would retaliate once he stopped their pillaging of our economy because of the weak policies of the past 4 Presidents.
1340399159589912578 2020-12-20 04:50:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SchwartzyXRP @TinkCarla üôèüôèüí™üëåüôè
1340399001728933888 2020-12-20 04:50:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They're only going to hear it so Roberts can pull a Comey to say, "Nothing here to see. Everything was good. Irregularities aren't enough to swing the election. No evidence of widespread fraud. Cone along little children, do as you're told."
1340398257462272001 2020-12-20 04:47:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Is there science behind any of it? Including the virus, itself?!?
1340397806910132224 2020-12-20 04:45:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He can run and have another election stolen from him, just so the evil can say, told you so?
1340397301462933504 2020-12-20 04:43:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just went to Kohl's, Costco, Bestbuy and Michael's to go Christmas shopping. Pretty close to normal amount of people in each, but we have a lockdown for sitting down in a restaurant? SBOs and the people just getting started are paying the ultimate price for this Barbarism.
1340349033760612352 2020-12-20 01:31:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> After we plundered our savings and retirement plans to make ends meet because this was supposed to be "short term." $600 won't even make a dent.
1340347747195641856 2020-12-20 01:26:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SteveScalise Those who make the rules, always win.
1340319634210365442 2020-12-19 23:34:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Check out our Queen here in MI... she extended the lockdown until Jan 15 keeping SBOs, especially Restaurants closed.
1340017836895301632 2020-12-19 03:35:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Are they trying to convince or persuade... the harder a salesman tries the more I'm running the other way.
1340017516010156034 2020-12-19 03:34:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Sassychickie I love me some Eggnog, especially with a little Nutmeg sprinkled on top!!!
1340017025402494978 2020-12-19 03:32:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ChuckCallesto Great, now what about the other 112 counties in Michigan?!?
1339951141984104449 2020-12-18 23:10:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Usatorz1 @laurafut_laura Because our largest employers are SBOs
1339950653544783872 2020-12-18 23:08:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MarisolDela8 Right after State of the Union Address... we'll call for it.
1339923846355443713 2020-12-18 21:21:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, when they stop slashing money for the police,  they'll need to raise taxes. It's like they'll simply move that money back from whatever they're spending it on now.
1339921556085063681 2020-12-18 21:12:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @catturd2 Can't we arrest him on perjury for lying to the Judicial Committee trying to become a Justice?
1339920042566311937 2020-12-18 21:06:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson Can't be that smart, he's been giving Pops half his salary for 30 years.

1339834951668281344 2020-12-18 15:28:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @taylorbilt Haven't you ever heard of an invisible fence for dogs? This is what it looks like.
1339775443759751168 2020-12-18 11:32:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @N1ckSandmann One of the witnesses is a Congressman from Texas. So, it might be a little more than "heresay."
1339775044415852546 2020-12-18 11:30:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hey, don't forget Michigan! Our tyrant is equally as insane as Cuomo and Newsome.
1339773628540473344 2020-12-18 11:24:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Good, let's get it right in the middle
1339773455370227713 2020-12-18 11:24:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @catturd2 How else can she whisper what he needs to say and get cues to him falling down?
1339773124934594560 2020-12-18 11:22:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's the funniest thing I've ever seen!
1339750394218606592 2020-12-18 09:52:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @heatherjones333 @happy1loyalusa In other words, Roberts, like all of them know there's enough evidence of fraud to throw out illegitimate votes giving the win to Trump thus causing the Democrats to call in their goon squads.
1339668013952475136 2020-12-18 04:25:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can we get an immediate Senate hearing.  They're supposed to be impartial and Constitutional Justices, Roberts has displayed none of these. Impeach Roberts.
1339667595260260373 2020-12-18 04:23:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Right_NotLeft I think we'll be shocked if anyone gets arrested.
1339666976201990144 2020-12-18 04:21:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can any justice be served on behalf of our President?!?
1339666773344460806 2020-12-18 04:20:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TrumpLadyFran Or just hate Trump
1339666616188071939 2020-12-18 04:19:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's simple. Same plan as March's plan. Get it done. Don't half this. We've been hurting going on 3 months because Nancy wanted to inflict pain. Now we've burned through our savings,  maxed our cards, and pummeled our 401ks to get through the past 90 days of not knowing.
1339663485802835968 2020-12-18 04:07:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope, not alone. Like the Tea Party but pissed off.
1339663087180386306 2020-12-18 04:05:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mattgaetz C'mon man, we can't think for ourselves. That's why we need government to tell us what to do.

Like overacting, right Jim Carrey?!?
1339662233282998275 2020-12-18 04:02:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Two facts remain true: 1. No one ever displays the data for us to come to our own conclusion that masks work (ie, seatbelts) 2. There are no minimum requirements stated for a mask or even what you can't use.
1339661431193690114 2020-12-18 03:59:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep

1339562328677888001 2020-12-17 21:25:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm thinking Marsha Blackburn will be first. @MarshaBlackburn
1339562081377525760 2020-12-17 21:24:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EricMMatheny Love the sentimental patriotism behind saying this, but we both know the first businesses that would be attacked are ones that need licenses from our states to operate and getting those back would be near impossible.

1339419001735278594 2020-12-17 11:55:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklevinshow I wonder if they read your tweets or listen to your show?
1339418585110900736 2020-12-17 11:54:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Do both
1339412728243433472 2020-12-17 11:30:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EricMMatheny Right, a few perp walks would do wonders for witnesses sitting on evidence.
1339412245680443395 2020-12-17 11:28:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So where are the true Constitutionalist Judges? Are there any? Thomas and Alito can't be the only ones,  can they? Maybe we should pack the court because Trump's picks haven't really worked out. Who's giving him these candidates?
1339411395171987457 2020-12-17 11:25:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @pepesgrandma @MJKHogs If you ever why some of our Republicans act strangely,  look no further. Someone is threatening the lives of families.
1339410362572165123 2020-12-17 11:21:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How real is this?!?
1339409878134210562 2020-12-17 11:19:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Right

1339408673899212802 2020-12-17 11:14:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DC_Draino We can also look at who doesn't admonish them like for instance, Mitch McConnell.

1339208810729238530 2020-12-16 22:00:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> What's McConnell going to be doing? Sabotaging when too much information comes out?!?
1339167828369403906 2020-12-16 19:17:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'd start with McConnell. What's to say his election wasn't given to him? His job would be to bring in the Republican Senate to clear the way. You don't see our Party acting like this is the most treasonous act ever perpetrated on our soil.
1339165907696967685 2020-12-16 19:10:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SexCounseling @gntschnzer @realDonaldTrump @OANN Maybe McConnell lost and doesn't want anyone poking around?!?
1339163937137434625 2020-12-16 19:02:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just past the first State of the Union where we will see first hand how bad he is and how the American people will demand that Harris becomes President.
1339163274919743490 2020-12-16 18:59:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> With all due respect,  yes I do. Boycott of Fox News extends to even Tucker Carlson,  sorry.

1339067875773083648 2020-12-16 12:40:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep
1339065146409439233 2020-12-16 12:29:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's why they act so smug. They know if they wait long enough, all will be forgotten.

1339050257280282624 2020-12-16 11:30:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @jason_meister @SKYRIDER4538 Seriously,  how many "insurance policies" do they have?
1339049708615036931 2020-12-16 11:28:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BeardsleeSherri @OcrazioCornPop How many people were collateral damage to get rid of Trump? Poverty, suicide and illness all lie at the hands of these domestic terrorists.
1339049199464230912 2020-12-16 11:26:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We don't want them to look at fraud. We want them to ensure states are following their own laws. They know if that happens,  Trump wins.
1339048730578837504 2020-12-16 11:24:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @thecjpearson And asset transparency... the only way these lifers can become multimillionaires is through "investing."
1339048211147853825 2020-12-16 11:22:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> She just pulled 8 more liquor licenses from local restaurants just today. They weren't playing by the rules so they must pay.
1339047069491867654 2020-12-16 11:17:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He probably didn't want to piss off his wife.
1338888796776108038 2020-12-16 00:48:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Please someone arrest Benson. This is a COUP. No other way to describe manually scrubbing the software.
1338665594888065024 2020-12-15 10:02:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RyanGirdusky The only thing that would have changed were the number of ballots they would have had to create and the number of times they put them through the machine.
1338664990992162817 2020-12-15 09:59:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TrumpCat04 @yogagenie @JRinPueblo @KarlRove @KarlRove - He says just enough talking points to get on Fox News then turns into the elitist Democrat we all know him to be.
1338662858075365376 2020-12-15 09:51:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> SHE IS THE MOST EVIL PERSON EVER.  2nd Place goes to AG Nessel. And rounding out the top 3 would be our SOS Benson.
1338662343446761472 2020-12-15 09:49:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Love how they always say Trump wants to "overturn the election."  He's not overturning anything.  He's simply asking that ONLY LEGITIMATE VOTES are counted in the tally.  Now, if you know once that happens Trump will be President, then it's still not overturning the election.
1338658305586192384 2020-12-15 09:33:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Michigan State Police were called to keep Republicans out of the Capital...  She can't ask the Sheriff Department or the military.  This is a COUP.  And should be treated as such.
1338508258353491968 2020-12-14 23:36:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gatewaypundit @mdeperno @100PercFEDUP @GenFlynn @SidneyPowell1 He'd better do it immediately during this open window.
1338507294938689539 2020-12-14 23:33:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SandyForLiberty Wasn't Ross on friends a "doctor?" Just saying...
1338506730095980546 2020-12-14 23:30:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kmoeaz I'm thinking there's a little sarcasm in that statement.
1338479689183203329 2020-12-14 21:43:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wow this is big
1338479057227419654 2020-12-14 21:40:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, the answer should be,  "go ahead, please look. Then we can get on with it." Instead they're trying to out last the calendar.
1338477615171121153 2020-12-14 21:35:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Have we seen his family,  he's acting like they're being held for ransom.
1338476794383622147 2020-12-14 21:31:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Promises Made. Promises Kept.
1338474276672983040 2020-12-14 21:21:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They know all that... they like to throw words in there like "widespread" and "not enough to change the election results." The voting roll should be clean from any illegitimate vote, period. Why is that so hard to act upon?!?
1338473541877030914 2020-12-14 21:18:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ArmyBratt68 Even "cure" is debatable. Many people don't take any medication other than what they would do for the flu, Nyquil, Robitussin etc and with a little rest they get through it just fine.
1338346451454337025 2020-12-14 12:53:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gatewaypundit @SandraSBreen @RudyGiuliani @100PercFEDUP She has little kids at home and will do anything not to be caught. I'm sure she could get immunity if she tells us the truth. That's all we are looking for.
1338345725181251586 2020-12-14 12:51:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Any time the government comes to us to let us know there's a problem,  it doesn't work out too well for us. It should be the other way around. There's no transparent data and dialogue regarding Climate or Viruses. They brought it down to us.
1338342739302346757 2020-12-14 12:39:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ConservativeBre Socialism is about protecting the haves while oppressing the have-nots.
1338340582041718784 2020-12-14 12:30:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can't stand those reasons of why we're not going to do  anything: it's not "widespread" and it won't change the outcome of the election.  If a vote is illegitimate, it must be not counted. It's not here's a stack of duplicates we're counting them anyway.
1338339386329624576 2020-12-14 12:25:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson @DNI_Ratcliffe @SecPompeo This is kind of like all those trafficked children being found and the large group of criminals arrested after they brought in Ghislaine.
1338288515076009985 2020-12-14 09:03:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @jsolomonReports Why is this a problem? We all know the data from CDC is flawed. We all know this strain of the flu called Covid should not be the catalyst for taking our freedoms. A flu shot is not mandatory,  yet it kills 70k people a year.
1338284276798926848 2020-12-14 08:46:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Exactly
1338208140714774531 2020-12-14 03:44:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson Follow the money. How many of those people listed donated $$ to the DNC.
1338206585924030465 2020-12-14 03:38:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Kellyjk0909 @_IamAnita_D @GOP @GOPChairwoman @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @senatemajldr @LindseyGrahamSC @SenRandPaul Sad that we couldn't get all of them out through the Tea Party movement.
1338206044921663488 2020-12-14 03:35:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MrMichaelBurkes Not one bit.
1338205809256394753 2020-12-14 03:35:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Comedians? Seriously,  when was the last funny thing on SNL? Alec Baldwin and his Schweddy Balls?
1338204976104022018 2020-12-14 03:31:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @canadiangirls99 The minute they don't hold the IRS over their heads. Do this or you can start paying taxes like corporations do. That would shut 70% of churches down.
1338203371946340360 2020-12-14 03:25:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes they are. If people are demoralized, they are easier to manipulate. That's the opposite of an SBO. We ha e critical thinking and perseverance as a backbone for our own successes.
1338202858462834690 2020-12-14 03:23:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Sundncefn @laurafut_laura The same reason why they jump to the conclusion that if we had any audit of the ballots we would be stealing the election. They know what they've done and they need Joe in office and Kamala to be in charge of the Senate to get away with it.
1338202033749434375 2020-12-14 03:20:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Are they moving to get away from California or to bring California with them? Let's see where they move and how all those Democrat voters can change Texas to Blue.
1338162885755871236 2020-12-14 00:44:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Kellyjk0909 @_IamAnita_D Unveiled Democrats in less than 2 minutes. We will tell the American people one thing and do exactly what we want. And yes, we lost big time, but we got away with stealing this election. Are any if our feckless Republicans watching? It's time to do something about this.
1338161851071406081 2020-12-14 00:40:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gatewaypundit @revealer316 Do you think Trump will need to call on our military?
1338160269525196801 2020-12-14 00:34:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why is it when Conservatives simply want to see the truth we are ostracized and ordered to comply? Climate Change, Benghazi, ANYTHING Clinton, Obama or Biden.
1338158840735555585 2020-12-14 00:28:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @robbystarbuck It's not general fact checking, it's agreeing and complying with THEIR facts.
1338158499868631041 2020-12-14 00:27:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Thinking out loud: Vaccines will become mandated to keep and gain employment. Who is the lost likely to obey and who is the most likely to dissent? They have 2 years to ultimately change the foundation of our country. Starts with this.
1338148010728034305 2020-12-13 23:45:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Boss: You're fired.  I was evaluated with glowing remarks. Most productive and best leader. Boss: Too many complaints.  By who? Boss: here's the list These people don't work here and I'm pretty sure a few of them are dead. Boss: You're still fired
1338141694630498306 2020-12-13 23:20:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Lrihendry I'm sure the payments will be classified as a loan therefore not income and won't be an IRS issue, not until the loan is forgiven which will probably be never. I would look to see if there's life insurance attached. Now, that's money laundering.
1338140886664929282 2020-12-13 23:17:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ArtValley818_ Key word "man". Not soy boy.
1338134007893139457 2020-12-13 22:49:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wth? 126 elected officials? It is "We the People," right?
1338133104532316160 2020-12-13 22:46:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RichardGrenell @united Comply or else. Welcome to Commiemerica. Can't wait for Biden's national mandate. His opportunity to round up some Trump supporters.
1337983084231340034 2020-12-13 12:50:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Controla_Virus According to nurse friends we have here in Michigan there has been about 75% reduction in RN and administrative staff laid off over the past 9 months and we too are saying staff is at "full capacity."
1337923919723044870 2020-12-13 08:54:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> China, Russia, Venezuela, Australia just to name a few...
1337815207964454915 2020-12-13 01:42:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Of course he knew, the whole Democratic Party, MSM and Big Tech knew.
1337814397247508482 2020-12-13 01:39:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We can't steal the election. Hell, we can't even get votes that have been counted twice to be thrown out. Don't know what the Left is talking about us trying to steal the election.
1337813577957322755 2020-12-13 01:36:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I pray that you are right. üôèüôèüí™üôè
1337813410982060040 2020-12-13 01:35:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Jennyjen010 Who knew that the court is actually 2 - 7 and not 5- 4 as previously thought? How come it's Roberts and not Thomas as Chief Justice?
1337812738404462597 2020-12-13 01:33:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They want to see Trump fail. Those who won their seats don't want to jeopardize their standing. Yep, that was a pun.
1337812272622743553 2020-12-13 01:31:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @domenicadelia22 Who's going to Q BLM and Antifa to "peacefully" protest by assaulting our Patriots?
1337811580742987777 2020-12-13 01:28:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Long game. No one does it better than the Left. Taking over with your opponents permission lasts generations.
1337811297078030338 2020-12-13 01:27:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JackPosobiec Just hope this isn't a  Comey moment where he reopened the case against HRC and then claimed nothing to see here, she's exonerated.
1337809546421694465 2020-12-13 01:20:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Love it
1337808775902851074 2020-12-13 01:17:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @paulsperry_ I guess we're not smart enough to handle the truth. Or maybe we are and he knew we'd take action against it.
1337639893636444161 2020-12-12 14:06:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @liquidlaugh He needed a CT Scan so they gave him an alibi to see medical help.
1337639437300326400 2020-12-12 14:04:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gatewaypundit @mdeperno @realDonaldTrump I thought they were keeping the results ofthe forensic tests under wraps?
1337638598976401408 2020-12-12 14:01:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KelemenCari Because we have the most power hungry Democrats in the US in our AG, SOS and Governor.
1337623706126921729 2020-12-12 13:01:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @iheartmindy @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Telling you, it started with Harry Reid. He was down 15 points and then bam, he won by a lot.
1337622770033758210 2020-12-12 12:58:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They didn't want civil war in their driveway.
1337622150900015112 2020-12-12 12:55:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gregkellyusa @easkelson It's too bad the results from the forensic research on the Dominion Voting Machines went directly to Lansing and they're kept from the public per judge's orders.
1337620651276832768 2020-12-12 12:49:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GeorgePapa19 Let's mark this down and see where we are a year from now.
1337620220949778433 2020-12-12 12:48:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How do you know it was "not enough?" Until we audit every vote to ensure it's valid, we'll never know and I'm sure as hell not going to take your word for it.
1337619641775099906 2020-12-12 12:45:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 @ArtValley818_ Effing agree!
1337467927839338496 2020-12-12 02:42:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> RT!!!
1337467152320835584 2020-12-12 02:39:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice, why didn't I think of that?
1337466851484442625 2020-12-12 02:38:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SammiG0203 I'd like to see it just to know what their amount of the population truly is... I'm expecting more of a 70/30 split.
1337411227417530368 2020-12-11 22:57:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Awesome
1337410472761552896 2020-12-11 22:54:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @my3monkees @WilkowMajority I'm thinking that's why Bill's audience has dwindled to the point his only relevance comes when he gets a spot on The Glenn Beck radio show.
1337409521199804416 2020-12-11 22:50:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ASoftstar Marriage
1337409171432632322 2020-12-11 22:49:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why wouldn't you?
1337408939193987074 2020-12-11 22:48:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 But if you did, would you risk going back in time? Or simply focus on going forward?
1337408533319589889 2020-12-11 22:46:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SammiG0203 Right you are. If they complete the steal, it won't matter.
1337408281250320385 2020-12-11 22:45:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So far, she's proving she is.
1337407901829378050 2020-12-11 22:44:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @iheartmindy I'm sure in his head that was funny as hell and he's probably telling all of his toothless friends about what he called you.
1337406665889636352 2020-12-11 22:39:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PISDI94_96 So what you're saying is I'm screwed up here in Michigan with Grinchmer?!?

1337261235960754176 2020-12-11 13:01:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He must be tried for selling secrets, treason.
1337260409691181059 2020-12-11 12:58:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Has anyone noticed that when there's this announcement it's like they announced they have the flu?
1337203825149693954 2020-12-11 09:13:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wasn't that the plan all along?!?
1337203186931740672 2020-12-11 09:10:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklevinshow Many blessings my friend
1337202888221876225 2020-12-11 09:09:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ChuckCallesto Deaf ears, Blind Eye. They all say the same thing. No evidence, the people have spoken, courts agree there's nothing.
1337202542497902593 2020-12-11 09:08:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why is everyone so amped over getting GA Rep Senators. The way Republicans act in GA, they're all Democrats. Just because they have an R doesn't mean they're going to vote that way.
1337202212330758146 2020-12-11 09:07:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BrandonStraka @UNBORNness @CCarrGOP Can't we boot them the hell out? We need to focus on down ballots in fraudulent states so we can get true Conservative Senators and Representatives back to the winning column, like John James of MI.
1337201396278554624 2020-12-11 09:03:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SammiG0203 @ArtValley818_ Nope, that's what ALL of our Democrats sound like as long as I can remember.  They all love power here in Michigan.
1337200854013792259 2020-12-11 09:01:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @m_keenum Per usual
1337200445002018817 2020-12-11 09:00:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @NickAdamsinUSA Can't we just give them to the Ukraine?
1337199446615072770 2020-12-11 08:56:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They might get back in touch with their friends over at BLM.
1337199274204000258 2020-12-11 08:55:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And we all know the answer... Biden takes over in January,  does national mask mandate and lockdowns, Covid magically disappears, Biden wins Nobel Peace Prize, heralded as our great savior.
1337044237033082880 2020-12-10 22:39:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because God is merciful.
1337044169911635981 2020-12-10 22:39:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 Because God is merciful
1337043667555639306 2020-12-10 22:37:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TimRunsHisMouth Is it possible to have both or is it that Covid simply trumps influenza? The symptoms are the same, aren't they? Doesn't flu kill 70k people a year?
1337042816460066821 2020-12-10 22:33:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's a lot of cabbage.
1337042713385037834 2020-12-10 22:33:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, any Red States left that hasn't joined?
1337042448284086277 2020-12-10 22:32:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DonaldJTrumpJr Can we just hire a bunch of planes that pull banners across the country to get people informed? Just a thought.
1337041978400399363 2020-12-10 22:30:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @InfidelAngela Too much common sense for Democrats to handle.
1337041768047669250 2020-12-10 22:29:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @drdavidsamadi They must have said months and not days and we just completely missed it.
1337041172695539720 2020-12-10 22:27:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RichardGrenell When hell freezes over... since that's where most of them came from, I'm sure they will canive their way to  some place warmer. I hear China is nice this time of year.
1337038601008410624 2020-12-10 22:16:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> All of them. Like how many are dead in a cemetery, all  of them.
1337038330844819457 2020-12-10 22:15:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DC_Draino I hope you're right but as things have been going, I'm not too optimistic.
1337037749883449353 2020-12-10 22:13:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @george_revere @laurafut_laura But we'll count them anyway because the people have spoken and there's no evidence of fraud.
1337036900377440261 2020-12-10 22:10:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ChuckCallesto Maybe they know crime will magically decrease once our saviors Biden/Harris will be President.
1337036446788620288 2020-12-10 22:08:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How many have to file FBARs? I'm sure they have foreign accounts that fly under the radar.
1337036164327497730 2020-12-10 22:07:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @domenicadelia22 She sure acted like she knows something we don't know. Like to find out.
1336706896716320769 2020-12-10 00:18:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @drdavidsamadi I'm hoping that the FDA puts a stall on these vaccines. Would like to know how dangerous they are, not like I'm ever going to take it voluntarily.
1336704009114148870 2020-12-10 00:07:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hospitals and medical staff are at full capacity here in Michigan according to Bitchmer. This is after laying off 75% of nurses and medical personnel just so they have this narrative. WTH.. SMH
1336702677661659137 2020-12-10 00:02:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @stlnurse3 @KelemenCari @vjbrooks12 China has been everyone's greatest enemy. It's that "We want to rule the world" mentality.
1336702314044862465 2020-12-10 00:00:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I hated him before I knew this now I'm completely validated.
1336702031755669505 2020-12-09 23:59:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Sad... we purposefully go to SBOs whenever we can
1336646188527980544 2020-12-09 20:17:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, but you can't vote Democrat.
1336645528155795457 2020-12-09 20:15:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We see this kind of lunacy every day here in Michigan. Yep, it's fun.
1336644804143439878 2020-12-09 20:12:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GKeile California moved to Red State Texas and NY moved to Red State Florida, get the picture? Long game.
1336644472583696386 2020-12-09 20:10:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ErrolWebber I think you just insulted all the burger joint managers...
1336643786668126214 2020-12-09 20:08:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @domenicadelia22 We all knew it. No surprise other than they must have known they were about to steel the election or they would have put through the $1.8b to get a win in their column. They didn't need it.
1336638427748503552 2020-12-09 19:46:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why do think CNN was built in the first place? It certainly wasn't to cover the news it was to form the news.
1336637231059054593 2020-12-09 19:42:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, but they're the party for the people. And after they steal the Presidency and the Senate, they'll be the only party for the people.
1336635616663101440 2020-12-09 19:35:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @chuckwoolery How is any politician even available to receive $$ from nefarious sources?
1336517211658313728 2020-12-09 11:45:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson @FoxNews @marthamaccallum She had an audience? Why?
1336421035885944836 2020-12-09 05:22:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> As things go, we may not have to imagine.
1336420360015765504 2020-12-09 05:20:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RyanAFournier They're going to mandate everything "for the good of the whole." Just wait until they say, no money, no job unless...
1336419793050759170 2020-12-09 05:18:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mona4faith You do have one of those trustworthy faces!
1336398761548013574 2020-12-09 03:54:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Thank you. I've been waiting for someone to say something.  Nuts belong in a dish, not in brownies.
1336397864084365313 2020-12-09 03:50:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep
1336397791602634757 2020-12-09 03:50:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Who's going to do the story? It's certainly not going to be MSM, and Fox News is now considered MSM. We have AONN and... NewsMax?
1336396774026702854 2020-12-09 03:46:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Exactly right
1336394348544585729 2020-12-09 03:36:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> She is absolutely the worst. Ask about what she's doing to Enbridge. It will affect everyone in the midwest.
1336393677732712449 2020-12-09 03:34:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @McKaylaRoseJ Oh ya know,  they're not one in the same?!?
1336335502606123012 2020-12-08 23:43:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Love it
1336334535605198849 2020-12-08 23:39:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Indeed
1336334337449443334 2020-12-08 23:38:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> üôèüôèüí™üôè
1336333855775543298 2020-12-08 23:36:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DeanBrowningPA But half the money goes to the DNC... so there's that.
1336333090499690496 2020-12-08 23:33:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I want to see that. Can it be televised?
1336332968185323520 2020-12-08 23:33:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Get er done!
1336332890594897928 2020-12-08 23:32:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> As long as they hear the case. Do not trust Roberts.
1336332180729958401 2020-12-08 23:29:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Messed up beyond comprehension. Was this part of the plan?!?
1336331615358779393 2020-12-08 23:27:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut Because it's all perfectly normal and perhaps even fun... wth!!!
1336331328548048897 2020-12-08 23:26:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Beautiful
1336331096808509443 2020-12-08 23:25:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GenerationQ2020 @m_keenum I hope you make him brush his teeth before a smooch after eating that concoction.
1336330831472730113 2020-12-08 23:24:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Hoosiers1986 Where's the train to take us to "re-education camp?"
1336330680125378561 2020-12-08 23:23:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> None
1336291672267878400 2020-12-08 20:48:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TrumpRulzz Start and end with hand counting with both parties present when opening the valid ballot envelope. Simple
1336289578483900422 2020-12-08 20:40:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If... Chief Justice Roberts...that's a big if.
1336168369511407617 2020-12-08 12:38:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealTina40 In a couple of months, if we don't turn this around, it won't really matter. It's not like a Republican will ever win again, anywhere.
1336033810694221828 2020-12-08 03:44:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And I betcha those numbers are way higher than the truth of the matter
1336032764743864320 2020-12-08 03:40:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How about an audit of every state of every ballot and kick out the ones that don't pass?
1335957273915650049 2020-12-07 22:40:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ain't that the truth
1335931226591465472 2020-12-07 20:56:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed. Gravely disappointed.
1335928481402777600 2020-12-07 20:45:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @llpatriot3 @waldon_mike This would be a good time for a federal testimony and eye witness account.
1335926152922345475 2020-12-07 20:36:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Rebecca16738262 @catturd2 And that's ridiculous
1335803463096279042 2020-12-07 12:28:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @easkelson And a million dollars for my lover turned husband.
1335739553651494916 2020-12-07 08:15:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Destiny3650 @pinkk9lover Let's keep this so they can get primaried when it's their turn to be "re-elected".
1335738919841837061 2020-12-07 08:12:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ArtValley818_ @my3monkees It got Covid
1335737633339809792 2020-12-07 08:07:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert Yeah, as long as they get out of the way.
1335736718432096260 2020-12-07 08:03:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hopefully they haven't been scrubbed clean already, HRC style.
1335736214373142534 2020-12-07 08:01:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ErrolWebber @BarackObama @JoeBiden If it was so systemic how did Barry become President with the highest (at the time) vote count?
1335735816119848960 2020-12-07 08:00:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> HCQ + Zinc or Regeneron?
1335733443544702978 2020-12-07 07:50:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @catturd2 Because they count everything as Covid. Michigan has one medical code for influenza, bronchitis,  pneumonia  and covid.
1335731021585801217 2020-12-07 07:41:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Uh, this is worth a few questions...
1335729530779148293 2020-12-07 07:35:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @WarTimeGirl I guess it would depend on the house...
1335608808777932803 2020-12-06 23:35:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ksorbs That's because their definition means conform and not mutual agreement
1335608352185987073 2020-12-06 23:33:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @assuredtruckser Point taken. Didn't give much credence to the clip. Go Trump!
1335571396160786433 2020-12-06 21:06:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Never forget
1335571121891110914 2020-12-06 21:05:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So glad you like Stinchfield's Investigative Journalism, now can you do something about the Democrat who's running your ticker tape?
1335569417456017408 2020-12-06 20:58:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This is way cool.
1335568287216914432 2020-12-06 20:54:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @my3monkees @GenFlynn NO!!! What till it shows up on Twitter or Parler, then you can just see the video clip without giving Fox any credit. It's like eating chocolate cake without the calories.
1335567676077461504 2020-12-06 20:52:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @HerschelWalker @BrianKempGA @GaSecofState @sendavidperdue @KLoeffler @realDonaldTrump @RudyGiulianli @JennaEllisEsq Could it simply be her doppelganger?
1335566333971472384 2020-12-06 20:46:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm sure she's getting pressure from home
1335565383806427139 2020-12-06 20:42:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @m_keenum üôèüôèüí™üôè
1335477025281368064 2020-12-06 14:51:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @jaye_monica They're probably dumb enough to think they have half the country. I'd give them 20% of our population at most.
1335475382158585856 2020-12-06 14:45:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Dovetail1221 Right there with you!
1335472469076045824 2020-12-06 14:33:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @johncardillo Looks like they ga e him another reason why he walks like an old old man.
1335467471160086528 2020-12-06 14:13:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ASoftstar Oopa!
1335427440651481088 2020-12-06 11:34:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Dovetail1221 @TrumperWavin Or at least on some chain gang
1335426844011737089 2020-12-06 11:32:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JedediahBila Why would they count ballots when the other party was not there? Why would they count them when they told everyone to go home? Why would they put ballots through multiple times? And you want to focus on the box the ballots came in? Just start your articles with "I hate Trump."
1335425487053709312 2020-12-06 11:27:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's awesome
1335327989698088961 2020-12-06 04:59:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How about getting rid of ballots that are illegitimate  Dead Underage  Felons Not citizens  Duplicates  Not on time No way of supporting that these are valid ballots  Hopefully,  these are looked at while you're conducting a "signature" audit. I don't want to assume anything.
1335326463206301703 2020-12-06 04:53:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Don't forget his little friends like George and Jack
1335326129171943425 2020-12-06 04:52:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 Scary thoughts. So they brainwash the middle class to exterminate the middle class.
1335325392908017665 2020-12-06 04:49:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @domenicadelia22 Apparently it's in Perdue's best interest not to become Senator. Wonder what changed? Money? Intimidation? Blackmail? All of the above?
1335324943387676672 2020-12-06 04:47:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @McKaylaRoseJ Not for Satan
1335324865499451397 2020-12-06 04:47:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> But not surprised.
1335248863108751364 2020-12-05 23:45:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope, not gonna happen. Done with Fox, forever.
1335248649518018564 2020-12-05 23:44:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @thebradfordfile The ever moving goal post of a word, "widespread".
1335248260638838786 2020-12-05 23:42:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SJPFISH @Jamierodr14 I guess that's normal too
1335247551726022657 2020-12-05 23:39:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @McKaylaRoseJ @JaylonTheGreat1 @kimKBaltimore @JulieRites @SpeakerPelosi Exactly right
1335247483061071872 2020-12-05 23:39:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Are they just making up awards now to glorify each other's existence? What a sham.
1335246944483102721 2020-12-05 23:37:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RyanAFournier Yes, but I heard he's a wiz in the meth lab.
1335246172701790208 2020-12-05 23:34:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed. Weren't we promised a list of government officials who used this fund? Weren't we promised that they would do away with this fund. Anything come of either?
1335245759676035081 2020-12-05 23:32:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @catturd2 I've had dogs my entire life. I can count how many times I've been in the shower or even in the bathroom with my dog.. zero. No, if my dog ever wonders toward the bathroom they are immediately sent the other way.
1335245078160404480 2020-12-05 23:30:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> DOJ and NSA could answer that right now. In fact, I betcha they already have that answer and they've buried it.
1335244373827727362 2020-12-05 23:27:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The cool thing is I would get like that once a year for the past 5 years or so and after a few days it was all gone and all I had to do was get rest and eat chicken noodle soup. So, was Covid around back then or is this just another strand of the flu?
1335243654370357250 2020-12-05 23:24:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ErrolWebber I'll get the plane ready.
1335243443409477632 2020-12-05 23:23:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @m_keenum Beautifully said, prayers for your heart. üôèüôèüí™üôè
1335242820232343558 2020-12-05 23:21:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You got that right.
1335242740855173121 2020-12-05 23:20:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can't wait to be able to call these treasonous acts for what they really are... uh, treasonous acts.
1335242397236801536 2020-12-05 23:19:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I love each and every one of you. Thank you for doing what is right.
1335242192143724547 2020-12-05 23:18:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's awesome!
1335089278737649664 2020-12-05 13:11:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why does a counting machine need to have algorithms? It's only adding.  There are no variables or lengthy equations to produce a quick answer.
1335085915530780675 2020-12-05 12:57:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Rebecca16738262 @catturd2 I have that on a tshirt!
1335085198657122305 2020-12-05 12:54:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @realTrumpForce Why did they comply?
1335084868586319872 2020-12-05 12:53:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @3sunzzz @CArmanthegirl Get naked and put on one of his dress shirts... no need to worry about dinner.
1335082749695320067 2020-12-05 12:45:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> All we need are 50k volunteers to depose. I'm sure we can get that many down there over the weekend.
1335079835660652544 2020-12-05 12:33:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gatewaypundit 20 binders of eye witness accounts... how are you a judge? Hundreds of people who chose to put it all on the table with the nothing to gain and everything to lose and he retorts, they have little value?!? We most certainly have a two tiered justice system.
1335078050334203904 2020-12-05 12:26:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson @themarketswork Truly, what the hell is this guy doing? Why bbn is the Gov and GOP letting him?
1335075883388956673 2020-12-05 12:17:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @emsmithtr90 Right, if the leftthi bbn is they are on the inside, they will soon be sadly mistaken.
1335072153608269825 2020-12-05 12:03:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @aloverofblue Dammit. Maybe I should make one.
1335032571424624640 2020-12-05 09:25:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ever notice,  you never hear how great the Biden administration is going to be. How things will be in 4 years. What exactly is going to be "better." Nope, it's all just, we got rid of Trump. Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.
1335029096431169542 2020-12-05 09:11:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @aloverofblue How about an app that makes you look like Brad Pitt?
1335028432040845318 2020-12-05 09:09:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @charliekirk11 Or, if they saw that both parties weren't represented,  why did they continue?
1335027478130208768 2020-12-05 09:05:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hell, I'd just like to see if I voted. I went there,voted in person, even received my sticker but nothing to say, yep you voted straight Republican.
1335026870631403530 2020-12-05 09:03:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This is now a Communist Country.
1335019704906362881 2020-12-05 08:34:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson Or receive a stimulus check or get your unemployment benefits.
1335017569565159425 2020-12-05 08:26:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @theangiestanton We need a perp walk stat.
1335015773870370817 2020-12-05 08:18:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BeholdIsrael @laurafut_laura And the US Post Office!

1335013294533451778 2020-12-05 08:09:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not just in Georgia
1335012775739977729 2020-12-05 08:07:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, some people are not getting that fact. Thanks for the spotlight.
1335012434734624770 2020-12-05 08:05:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GeorgePapa19 Is that a trickle of Equal Justice?
1335012258062196738 2020-12-05 08:05:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope, we love the fact you were a waitress and moved yourself up. We just can't stand you and we are dumbfounded how you got elected in the first place. If I was the incumbent you "beat" in 2016, I'd as hell look into election fraud.
1335011641327558657 2020-12-05 08:02:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Love it!!!
1334895520733679616 2020-12-05 00:21:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gatewaypundit @newsmax @GabrielSterling I stopped watching them. Thought it was a breath of fresh air but it seems if they're going to put AP articles on the front page of their website and so called Conservative hosts are talking about Biden becoming President,  then I am moving on to AONN.
1334894581817733123 2020-12-05 00:17:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Do we really have to guess?
1334894491862437888 2020-12-05 00:17:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @verum29 Sure wish I could retweet your posts!!!
1334893494415056898 2020-12-05 00:13:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Let's hope MI, WI, AZ, NV, and PA have courage as well.

1334892930457350144 2020-12-05 00:10:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @windexthewindow Sorry,  musta had my serious hat on at the time, probably just read something about the election... I'm usually better than that!
1334857356405055488 2020-12-04 21:49:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DC_Draino Cool to see some confessions and finger pointing that brings in all of the other nefarious characters in this coup attempt. Then maybe MSM cannot ignore it any longer.
1334856965458178049 2020-12-04 21:47:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @windexthewindow Wash them? Why? Egg is in the shell, shell is cracked open, then poured out. What I'm eating never touched the outside of the shell. What gives?
1334855756873670661 2020-12-04 21:43:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson If Covid is that deadly, why are they fudging the numbers?
1334854640270184448 2020-12-04 21:38:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut DOJ should grab every video from every polling place in America immediately.
1334853868925169665 2020-12-04 21:35:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> End the Covid Hoax. Equal Justice. Open up our economies. Trump as President. Republicans hold Senate and gain the House. That's all.
1334853172834263041 2020-12-04 21:32:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Now he's troubled?!? After hours and hours of eye witness testimony? Is that what we're up against? If there's no video, there's no evidence? How about confessions, would those work? How about starting with who has the most to gain and work backwards?
1334616417291956225 2020-12-04 05:52:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LisaMarieBoothe Apparently she had to pay another hefty bar bill.
1334616069806419969 2020-12-04 05:50:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @FilterlessKiki I voted in MI in person... can't provide evidence that I voted though.
1334614467670368257 2020-12-04 05:44:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wish I had a job that I could get paid handsomely for 1/4 the work.
1334614070943752195 2020-12-04 05:42:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @thecjpearson I don't think he was the lone Republican to do this.
1334612750157406209 2020-12-04 05:37:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Whatever happened to those ballots that were supposed to have been watermarked?
1334612526903013376 2020-12-04 05:36:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Does it come with a voter ID card?
1334612397294809088 2020-12-04 05:36:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DrShayPhD No vote is a vote for them. And you see how they cheat, we need everyone and then some.
1334611461570764800 2020-12-04 05:32:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can we put together an infomercial just on the witnesses that have come forward and put it on tv? I'm guessing half of America has no idea what is going on.
1334610950511616005 2020-12-04 05:30:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklutchman @kenzie45230 How about none of them are lying. There are thousands of other witnesses saying, I saw stuff but hell if I'm going to say anything. Why would I put my life, job and family in jeopardy?
1334610275832631300 2020-12-04 05:27:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If they find more than enough votes for the GOP senators,  can they call off this runoff?
1334609061929685003 2020-12-04 05:22:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SidneyPowell1 @realDonaldTrump @LLinWood @KrakenWood @GenFlynn @JosephJFlynn1 @abigailcfrye Has anyone questioned the counters and supervisors that are committing these crimes? Showing one of them in handcuffs may be a fast way of getting confessions from other perpetrators across the country.
1334608389767303169 2020-12-04 05:20:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You know what I'm sick of hearing? Yep, there's irregularities, but is it enough to over turn the election? Who cares. If there is something wrong, make it right and by time you make everything right, then see who wins. They're already presuming they'll lose.
1334545484590030850 2020-12-04 01:10:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I trust him like I trust Sessions
1334545205253509121 2020-12-04 01:09:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ok, American!
1334545077885153282 2020-12-04 01:08:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why did Democrats go all in for this election? Follow the money and follow how close Trump is to exposing everything.
1334544789820366850 2020-12-04 01:07:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We all know the answer... another question would be for how long have you been putting your thumb on the scale and why was it so important that you went all out for this election? Trump getting too close?
1334544258590797826 2020-12-04 01:05:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @__Kimberly1 And don't forget who they endorsed.
1334544035516739585 2020-12-04 01:04:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> All of this breaks my heart.  No, literally. I felt my heart sink when I hear about words like these. God put us together for His reason.  Skin color does not depict the character and soul in a child of God.
1334543207351414784 2020-12-04 01:01:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Invasion
1334517915413045249 2020-12-03 23:20:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can someone please look into the Covid data numbers. I have the feeling those numbers are so skewed that there is no truth in them.
1334345337012703232 2020-12-03 11:54:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Me too
1334345199577862144 2020-12-03 11:54:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Welcome to our hell.. you should see who's in charge... Wretched Hitler.
1334212479212269570 2020-12-03 03:06:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And blaming Trump and Republicans for the reason
1334212286504964098 2020-12-03 03:06:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> A burglar can't be charged with B&amp;E when you let them in the front door. When voting machines are hooked up to the internet and USBs can escape chain of custody, you're right, there was no hack.
1334211550870122498 2020-12-03 03:03:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @charliekirk11 @easkelson Sick and tired of this two tier justice system.
1334186387776675844 2020-12-03 01:23:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And don't forget the use of the word "widespread". This  is their crutch when spreading misinformation about election fraud.
1334185439637467136 2020-12-03 01:19:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @InfidelAngela Keeps getting recommendations from the wrong people. Next he'll pick.
1334158579226603522 2020-12-02 23:32:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not needed right now and they stopped paying.
1334158261302554624 2020-12-02 23:31:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So restaurants are open?!?
1334158072177102848 2020-12-02 23:30:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I thought it was just me! I had to set up my office specifically for that purpose.
1334157877112676352 2020-12-02 23:30:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Marisol_USA Drink your calories. Protein drinks, V8 type drinks, smoothies etc. Just a thought.
1334157467396296704 2020-12-02 23:28:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And none of that has helped us thus far in this sham of an election cycle.
1334156716452274176 2020-12-02 23:25:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I would but they're no longer accepting calls. Yep, you heard that right.
1334156443897958405 2020-12-02 23:24:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because they know it's FAKE
1334121327821807617 2020-12-02 21:04:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LLinWood @BrianKempGA @GaSecofState Would love a conference with these two confessing what they've done, why they did it and who paid them.
1334120182764204032 2020-12-02 21:00:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You mean like "Hope and Change"? Besides,  that wasn't a slogan, those were words used by your Democrat Leaders.
1334117178770157568 2020-12-02 20:48:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> 110% agreed
1334117082569568259 2020-12-02 20:47:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Tbone7219 @adrianmyreality Give me your address. I'll bring a tree stand and vodka so we can do this right.
1334111490664779776 2020-12-02 20:25:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @karencl34933349 Would love to finally see equal justice.
1333992528350236672 2020-12-02 12:32:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why would they care about getting caught? It's not like there's punishment that coincides with their crimes.
1333816569831567360 2020-12-02 00:53:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ErrolWebber If only we could afford one!
1333758178673242114 2020-12-01 21:01:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TomFitton Because they can't pick up a gun and take over a country the old fashion way. Nope, the new way is by permission.
1333757153983811584 2020-12-01 20:57:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just like old times eh Kemp?
1333757046945161218 2020-12-01 20:57:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Do I smell impeachment or incarceration for Kemp?
1333756382915465219 2020-12-01 20:54:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We can only hope. We just need an early morning raid like they performed on Roger Stone. That will shake the boots of every SOS across the country.
1333755429604782083 2020-12-01 20:50:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @80sMetalGaga @charliekirk11 To the point I question my own sanity!
1333644990304673793 2020-12-01 13:31:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, is this the "insurance policy?"
1333438441535705088 2020-11-30 23:51:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RepMattGaetz That's right, we've been successful since Reagan because he showed us how INSPITE of the leadership over the past 3 decades.
1333437351100608513 2020-11-30 23:46:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 Agreed. One of the biggest disappointments, yet not surprising.
1333410557307854848 2020-11-30 22:00:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 Still would like to believe that Roberts could be counted as the 6th... hell, they ALL should be Constitutionalists...
1333400041487273984 2020-11-30 21:18:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson So the question is,  what's in the vaccine? Is there something there that we shouldn't know about?
1333399751757336576 2020-11-30 21:17:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I wonder what the survival rates are for the flu? Oh that's right we cured that.
1333399496873619456 2020-11-30 21:16:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's funny, like believing them is even an option.
1333398497803063298 2020-11-30 21:12:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TheDamaniFelder So, except most of our GOP?
1333398120688979974 2020-11-30 21:10:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Great work on getting these numbers.
1333396787080679425 2020-11-30 21:05:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not only tech, but Big Box Stores that showed their allegiance by giving to BLM.
1333396414274170882 2020-11-30 21:04:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @m_keenum Divide and conquer
1333394253049946112 2020-11-30 20:55:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @christianllamar @january212017 @realDonaldTrump And counting...
1333392196448497664 2020-11-30 20:47:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kimKBaltimore Don't go away, this country needs you and who knows maybe this election will be found out that it too was stolen from you. GB
1333391640845836288 2020-11-30 20:45:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TrumpRulzz It's quite simply a waiting game. They believe that there's just not enough time to unravel ALL of the ways they perpetrated the biggest election fraud in the history of the world.
1333226807538176001 2020-11-30 09:50:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They're probably already working on wiping them clean the moment they got the go ahead from the fake judge.
1333218421425770498 2020-11-30 09:16:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> There isn't a Georgian GOP. Just a bunch of Democrats masquerading as RINOs.
1333215517369307136 2020-11-30 09:05:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Please RT. Never know who'll know something!
1333215067819663364 2020-11-30 09:03:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MichaelCoudrey How many scumbag leaders do we have that can be coerced so easily and quickly? Or do they threaten families to do their bidding?
1333214051011350528 2020-11-30 08:59:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Too bad, we were supposed to have 6. George, what happened? Couldn't get your nomination right, or did you?
1333202735106289665 2020-11-30 08:14:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 Destruction of Evidence?!? Where's the FBI? State legislators to subpoena so they can't legally lose 33000 emails.
1333077541180076033 2020-11-29 23:57:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @towntro @billycrash 353 to be exact, but who's counting?!?
1333076545368416258 2020-11-29 23:53:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> There are no words to explain this or the person who invited it.
1333074346370359297 2020-11-29 23:44:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DetroitLionsPro Bring in Mike Babcock and Ken Holland. It can't hurt,  right?!?
1333053578416713732 2020-11-29 22:21:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GKeile @easkelson And how many total number of counties did Biden win? The lowest amount for a winner in history with just over 400!
1332910513735540739 2020-11-29 12:53:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They wanted such a one sided victory that we wouldn't take the time to look. But again they underestimated Trump supporters where we gave him a 20% bump in votes.
1332909577973751808 2020-11-29 12:49:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Don't forget Gretchen Whitmer, our awesome soon to be impeached Governor.
1332909043686526976 2020-11-29 12:47:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealRLimbaugh @easkelson In an airplane they tell you to put the air mask on yourself first so you can take care of everyone around you.  Same basic principle of putting America first. In fact, Trump told all the leaders they should do that and it'll make the world a better place.
1332717081322721280 2020-11-29 00:04:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So when we say it's flu season,  that's all there is to it?
1332710586459828237 2020-11-28 23:38:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @domenicadelia22 Here in Michigan we count Influenza, Bronchitis, Pneumonia as Covid. How about California?
1332710196293099521 2020-11-28 23:37:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Reagan then Trump those are our Conservatives for the past 3 decades.
1332687417124511745 2020-11-28 22:06:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MeghanC57895868 @ksorbs Middle America is their nemesis.  We are what's in their way of having a society built on the Ruling class and those who are forced to worship them.
1332685779127185411 2020-11-28 22:00:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed.  No way I'm going back. I feel like a jilted lover who was cheated on after a 20 year marriage. Hey Fox, FU and the horse you rode in on.
1332684448467476483 2020-11-28 21:55:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @my3monkees Did they try and cheat in Ohio and Florida but came up short? We need an audit of every State. I betcha there's fraud in every election some were more successful than others.
1332682369334173696 2020-11-28 21:46:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @InfidelAngela @realDonaldTrump IMHO, I don't think it's half. I betcha it's closer to 20%. This is their biggest hoax.
1332681768349134848 2020-11-28 21:44:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @proxcee They had a 15% turnout for registered voters which is exactly normal. They also had 100 to 300% turnout for unregistered voters in the same Precincts counting over 130k votes for Biden and zero for Trump.
1332667412588732418 2020-11-28 20:47:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklevinshow He's daring us to do something about it.
1332666868897865728 2020-11-28 20:45:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hope Michigan Legislators take note and follow suit.
1332666722994753539 2020-11-28 20:44:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ksorbs And we LOVED Trump as our President. Promises Made, Promises Kept.
1332555111260975105 2020-11-28 13:21:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I stayed up until 2:30 in the morning before I went to bed. Man was I miffed when I got up at 6. I thought they stopped counting but I guess not.
1332378866392985600 2020-11-28 01:40:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> But they do know it was our fault because we are very bad people.
1332377861639041024 2020-11-28 01:36:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And of course the Appellate Court rejected all nnmmlm of this with a boilerplate answer that will come from every lower court across the country.
1332376777457610753 2020-11-28 01:32:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Seriously wtf!!!
1332372514111156224 2020-11-28 01:15:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @aliarouzi Why did they assassinate him? And who is "they?"
1332338962187366407 2020-11-27 23:02:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EukayBrie @FoxNews How do we know those numbers are accurate? We've all seen what they do with tabulating numbers.
1332336176896860162 2020-11-27 22:51:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DFBHarvard All the while only winning 400+ counties in the US.
1332335719784861696 2020-11-27 22:49:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And don't forget Facebook's AI "accidentally" banned Small Business Ads.
1332322696437374976 2020-11-27 21:57:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kylenabecker Let's call them up and ask.
1332223157369974785 2020-11-27 15:22:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Dovetail1221 Makes my heart go pitter pat! Would love to see it!
1332149197534093312 2020-11-27 10:28:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Since it started.
1332148805815431168 2020-11-27 10:26:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We started watching the Lions Game,  saw the starting QB Matthew Stafford kneeling during the anthem, immediately turned off the tv. Heard they played Lionesk today. Serves you right.
1332147767792328704 2020-11-27 10:22:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope, never a peep out of CDC!
1332146545416867842 2020-11-27 10:17:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KelemenCari What about the down ballot,  focusing on our Senate Race between James and Peters.
1331948679775850498 2020-11-26 21:11:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You mean 68% stayed?!? Why? Drop these traitors. There are better sources than another mouthpiece for the Left. Try AON or even NewsMax.
1331947682483597312 2020-11-26 21:07:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Or if the Democrats get away with this steal because they get away just about everything, be grateful for what once was the greatest beacon of freedom for the world.
1331946044393992193 2020-11-26 21:00:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JennaEllisEsq This shows you how the SCOTUS is divided. We can no longer put Chief Justice Roberts in the Conservative camp. When is the last time he enforced the Constitution?
1331945187103432710 2020-11-26 20:57:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Activist who has no reason to be on the bench.
1331944707350532096 2020-11-26 20:55:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Actually,  I'm thankful for the people like Jenna Ellis who are fighting for our Great President.  He's been going at this alone for 5 years, so it's awesome to see the most talented professionals take up arms for our country.
1331944040733011968 2020-11-26 20:53:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Who brought in Roberts again? That should tell you a lot. Trump is beloved because he's the first true Conservative since Reagan.
1331943311754584064 2020-11-26 20:50:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Must read this and RT.
1331941856771518466 2020-11-26 20:44:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They want to bring our country to its knees and what better way than through the lifeblood of the American dream of owning your own business.
1331767850625863681 2020-11-26 09:12:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Funny
1331764318287826945 2020-11-26 08:58:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hate how they say "Trump says racist things." Where's the video? Show me one time.
1331757626183577601 2020-11-26 08:32:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And the root cause of Common Core.
1331757434822668288 2020-11-26 08:31:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Lrihendry They did the same thing here in Michigan.  Explain that?!?
1331756806125871107 2020-11-26 08:29:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Good, because I've been triggered since I went to bed Nov 3rd and woke up to Biden winning when they were supposed to be have e stopped the counting.
1331756376121544706 2020-11-26 08:27:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ain't that the truth
1331755671159762947 2020-11-26 08:24:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PISDI94_96 That's kinda unfair don't ya think?
1331755428003389442 2020-11-26 08:23:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MdelaSoledad1 Prime Rib Twice Baked Potato Green Bean Almondine  Tiramisu   Yeah, we do things a little different at our house starting with the Prime Rib Roasts with homemade horseradish sauce!
1331717019390144514 2020-11-26 05:50:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @AmyKremer They don't anyone to know
1331683335136010245 2020-11-26 03:37:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert No artistic control
1331613376427012096 2020-11-25 22:59:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Please know, Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan Governor,  aka "Supreme Leader" vetoed a bill in October making voter fraud a felony. It remains a misdemeanor where it only costs you a fine if caught.
1331612825236672515 2020-11-25 22:56:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KelemenCari @january212017 Can we get a name so we can pay a visit to this guy?
1331612032651698178 2020-11-25 22:53:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just saw on a grocery store door that we should limit the number of shoppers in our party. Do I leave all 5 kids in the car? What's next,  alphabetized days to shop? People with the last name starting with "A" can shop on Mondays only.
1331610491186196480 2020-11-25 22:47:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> As long as we conform to the will of the elitist Democrats.
1331564807963734017 2020-11-25 19:46:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @wrneffjr @marklevinshow It sounded like he forgot who his audience was, like bbn he thought he was on a zoom meeting addressing his fellow Democrat operatives who needed a pep talk.
1331564160870719488 2020-11-25 19:43:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> "Come together" is synonymous with "Conform or else."
1331562382162862081 2020-11-25 19:36:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @catturd2 Only if their buddies at CNNand MSNBC say so.
1331561755294773248 2020-11-25 19:33:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Almost as weird as seeing an American Flag... if you have one or waving one, we know what party you're from.
1331559884417093633 2020-11-25 19:26:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And no China, Russia, Ukraine ties or Hunter Biden laptop...
1331559613343404034 2020-11-25 19:25:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> First stimulus package then open up America.
1331559391150174210 2020-11-25 19:24:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I hate the word "widespread ". Too subjective and easily used against us.
1331557160959012867 2020-11-25 19:15:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Never going to happen.
1331556951537442817 2020-11-25 19:14:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Easy. Masks do more harm than good. Stats commingle all sorts of respiratory illnesses with the heading of CV19. There are no stats given of effectiveness of masks because there are no minimums for masks. There has to be a baseline in any stat to be worthwhile.
1331556115646197761 2020-11-25 19:11:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Rock it out! Let's do this. It's time and any other cliches to get to do it!!!
1331555853313470464 2020-11-25 19:10:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Paul Ryan did his job very well. We just didn't realize he was playing for the other team. Repeal and Replace? What a set up.
1331555328077524992 2020-11-25 19:08:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I hate that guy.
1331554788148989952 2020-11-25 19:06:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And don't forget the mandate of putting Covid positive patients into nursing homes, like Whitmer of MI and Cuomo of NY.
1331553654122405889 2020-11-25 19:01:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We'll have to keep telling the other 50% that there are alternatives, such as AON that can be watched on PlutoTV (free app for your phone.)
1331553109819203588 2020-11-25 18:59:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That is the question isn't it?IMHO Most Republicans want Trump out of office just as bad. Politicians do not like outsiders. They get too much done and they don't care about playing the game. Work in any gov't job, you'd see firsthand almost immediately.
1331468252980125698 2020-11-25 13:22:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I think he would be a great replacement for Wray.
1331357907628265474 2020-11-25 06:03:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's beautiful!
1331357741693235209 2020-11-25 06:03:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Couldn't agree more.
1331357316298502148 2020-11-25 06:01:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hahahahaha!!!
1331355894219681792 2020-11-25 05:55:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That Biden name comes with a lot of perks.
1331355666024456194 2020-11-25 05:55:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Please RT to make sure everyone who needs to know  knows.
1331355271025856515 2020-11-25 05:53:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert @ChatChristi Ever the quintessential politician,  everything Joe says is a platitude.
1331354031210565633 2020-11-25 05:48:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Consequences certainly have a motivating and demotivating factor.
1331353743535853572 2020-11-25 05:47:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You're my new favorite!
1331353375196254210 2020-11-25 05:45:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @catturd2 @jabnolimit @FoxNews They don't care.  They just wanted to take out any voice juxtaposed to their Socialist propaganda. Now what to do with OAN and NewsMax?!?
1331351103565402114 2020-11-25 05:36:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KristiSiaperas Sorry, not sorry. If he couldn't handle true patriotism now, he was bbn only going to be trouble down the road. I say good riddance (but still sorry for your loss).
1331251157075980289 2020-11-24 22:59:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I would love to see this happen.  So sick of a two tier justice system.
1331250266507767808 2020-11-24 22:56:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why should he care? He has his job and if he makes nice now, he'll be able to get all kinds of goodies for his district this keeping his job. Term limits would alter this in a nanosecond.
1331032133406756865 2020-11-24 08:29:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> What?!?
1331026666227896320 2020-11-24 08:07:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @FlorioGina Gentlemen,  adore and honor your wife as Jesus exalted his bride, the Church.
1331025580020686849 2020-11-24 08:03:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Exterminating the Middle Class, that's the true mark of authoritarianism.
1331023445669376001 2020-11-24 07:54:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Where's Al Gore?
1331018540854415363 2020-11-24 07:35:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert No, he intends to abolish the 2nd Amendment by making it too expensive for us to own our guns.
1330956905804681218 2020-11-24 03:30:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, she's a piece of work.
1330955883430424576 2020-11-24 03:26:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TomFitton This way everyone can clean up their own messes.
1330870003336404995 2020-11-23 21:45:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Crystal__Monroe @thehill @TheHillOpinion He knew what he was saying
1330620328641490944 2020-11-23 05:13:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Match the signatures,  vote on time and challengers from both sides to count votes. Anything less than that the vote should be not counted. Notice I didn't mention anything about Trump or Biden? Because that's irrelevant. Integrity of the ballot.
1330578559937748995 2020-11-23 02:27:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MsAvaArmstrong Democrats don't have a monopoly on being dirty.
1330258350500687875 2020-11-22 05:14:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PaAmericangirl Covid is just another influenza.
1330257816255422470 2020-11-22 05:12:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We know damn well this isn't the first time. Check out how Harry Reid won his last election.  Down 15 points the morning of and voila, he's the winner.
1330257288863608836 2020-11-22 05:10:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RandyRRQuaid Biggest fear is that they'll get away with all of it.
1330144414078021634 2020-11-21 21:41:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Still don't understand how a tabulating system has this feature. If anything,  the opposite should be the feature, that there's no way anyone can change the count. If you're buying anything, you're buying it's features and benefits. So, the questions are Who and Why?
1330142846654046212 2020-11-21 21:35:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @charliekirk11 First things first. We need to get SCOTUS to declare Trump the winner. Have him inaugurated in January and then come down on the perpetrators.
1330142359066193930 2020-11-21 21:33:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DrShayPhD Been to a church where this happens regularly, it's kinda freaky and awesome at the same time. Yes, I believe that the Holy Spirit can fill the room to the point where there is speaking in tongues.
1330141425011449868 2020-11-21 21:30:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Hoosiers1986 @BarackObama Sorry, I can't give him that much credit. He's too much of a mouthpiece to be this diabolical. Granted, he's up to his elbows but being the mastermind, no way.
1330139133151502341 2020-11-21 21:20:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why build a product that has a feature of being able to change outcomes when in fact, a tabulating system should have a feature that makes it impossible to change the outcome? The feature itself makes the product irrelevant unless you plan on using that particular feature.
1330138062752505857 2020-11-21 21:16:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Bring it
1330137577836474368 2020-11-21 21:14:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> DO NOT BE DECEIVED. She is as partisan as it gets. She's Gretchen Whitmer's lackey. We had a great SOS and somehow Jocelyn won 2 years ago. This is a James Comey coming to exonerate HRC moment. Jocelyn will say, "All is good here. Nothing to see."
1330136387337793536 2020-11-21 21:10:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Here in Michigan,  it's all coded under Covid. In order to get a prescription you first have to go to the hospital.
1330135621139099654 2020-11-21 21:06:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PolitiBunny Now that's a dude.
1330133594422079489 2020-11-21 20:58:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GreggJarrett Hey Greg, you should give a shout over to OANN and NewsMax! Your audience will be bigger and they're won't be all that backstabbing. Signed X-Fox Loyalist turned heartbroken.
1330022991284101122 2020-11-21 13:39:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @throughthygrace @easkelson @newsmax Just look at number of votes per Precinct. 15% turnout in Detroit, 85% turnout in suburbs (Highly for Trump) and then 130k votes from unregistered voters that came in during the night.
1330022023871991810 2020-11-21 13:35:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wouldn't trust this Democrat SOS. It'd be like when Jim Comey exonerated HRC right before the 2016 Presidential election.
1330018663181774849 2020-11-21 13:22:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Prove it in court where it matters then the MSM can cover the court cases as it should be!
1329815738975182849 2020-11-20 23:55:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> She has back stabbing written all over her. Can't imagine the stories we get from her college days.
1329815451396935702 2020-11-20 23:54:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, but at least we have Al Franken coming back.
1329809509821374474 2020-11-20 23:31:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You mean less invasive than influenza?
1329808948258541571 2020-11-20 23:28:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealMattCouch Yes but our Democrat SOS won't allow it.  Our Republican Legislators better get involved.
1329807077078933506 2020-11-20 23:21:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because Democrats told them don't worry about it.  They'll make it go away just like every other crime we have gotten away with for the past two hundred years.
1329784559207141376 2020-11-20 21:51:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @proxcee Except Mark Levin
1329782898476593152 2020-11-20 21:45:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ACTBrigitte He is protecting his current and future paychecks. But, hey who could blame the guy? If someone was dangling multi-million dollar carrots in front of you,  I think it'd be amazing the things you'd be willing to do,  especially when you know you couldn't do by yourself.
1329780985316208641 2020-11-20 21:37:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GeorgePapa19 @RealMattCouch I have a suspicion that there are far fewer Democrats than they're letting on. It's their dirty little secret. We are not 50-50. If Trump has done anything,  it's expose this lie. How would we behave if we knew it was closer to 80-20 Conservatives vs Liberals?
1329780278525632518 2020-11-20 21:34:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Everything is ass backwards.  The amount of people arrested and children found just in the past few months has been incredible. But the lack of media attention is sickening.
1329779463773691907 2020-11-20 21:31:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They had something to do with 2018 that's for sure. When things were going so well America decided we need a Democrat led House?
1329779118452449281 2020-11-20 21:30:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DineshDSouza Exactly right!
1329778140634370055 2020-11-20 21:26:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If this were my party pulling this larceny, my hair would be on fire to get them exposed.
1329777852368171010 2020-11-20 21:25:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TeamTrump Just because it went "your" way this time doesn't mean it'll always work out that way. They get to choose who will be your future candidates. And those should frighten everyone.
1329776416955756544 2020-11-20 21:19:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They did not call for evidence from Adam Schiff's whistleblower.  They simply wanted to impeach Trump.
1329776100868812800 2020-11-20 21:18:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JediWiththe @easkelson Steve Crowder showed the ballot breakdown of Wayne County, MI.  15% voter turnout for Detroit Precincts and 83% turnout for suburbs and 100% turnout for unregulated voters.
1329775190671233026 2020-11-20 21:14:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Many thousands had to "hear" about our loves ones and still can't have any type of memorial service.  It's truly heartbreaking.
1329774630333272065 2020-11-20 21:12:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @theangiestanton @ArjParish @SidneyPowell1 @TuckerCarlson And a lot of good THAT evidence did...
1329774464528244739 2020-11-20 21:11:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Me no like Karl Rove, always thought he played the wolf in sheep's clothing way too well.
1329773994451537923 2020-11-20 21:10:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kimKBaltimore It amazes me how they cannot see it...
1329564334054395914 2020-11-20 07:16:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealCandaceO How many cases of Influenza and pneumonia are happening at the same time?
1329508887008047112 2020-11-20 03:36:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's rhetorical right?
1329508743344754691 2020-11-20 03:36:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JennaEllisEsq @RudyGiuliani @SidneyPowell1 Beautiful,  Smart and a badass, you just became a hero for us but more importantly,  a role model for my 13 yr old daughter.
1329493483841867787 2020-11-20 02:35:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PISDI94_96 Chuck Schumer at home
1329483866625675265 2020-11-20 01:57:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The best apostle used to be the biggest scumbag.  Maybe God will use JT much the same way in getting the good news out.
1329483382057807874 2020-11-20 01:55:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hey, is it on CNN, MSNBC or any MSM outlet? That was rhetorical.
1329463877831188480 2020-11-20 00:37:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 We're all not racist. We want everyone to succeed. That's what makes us Conservative. That's what they hate lost of all. It's about Class warfare.
1329435460595306499 2020-11-19 22:44:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The Tea Party put a spotlight on it.
1329289863645044737 2020-11-19 13:06:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 So was smoking.  Drs prescribed smoking cigarettes at one time.
1329250627071991808 2020-11-19 10:30:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JudgeJeaninefan Right after Barry Hussein tells us he's from Kenya and he is the only gay Muslim.
1329179471094685699 2020-11-19 05:47:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @indacopa @easkelson @TuckerCarlson Started out as a bore. Had a few good weeks. Went back to being a bore.
1328817289714688001 2020-11-18 05:48:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Everyone has heard of Antrim County in Michigan. Word has it the county right next door also went blue which historically has always been Red.
1328778371669614597 2020-11-18 03:13:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> üôèüôèüí™üôè
1328497369772527617 2020-11-17 08:37:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And for us to increase the Stronghold on the Senate and take over the House.
1328495202802298882 2020-11-17 08:28:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wht is she not in jail?
1328492683548127233 2020-11-17 08:18:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TomFitton @easkelson Yabbutt they're Democrats,  so they can do whatever they want.
1328420801259909121 2020-11-17 03:32:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MichaelCoudrey How do you vote No? If the Republicans were trying this BS, my hair would be on fire even more than it is. There's no way I would put up with this in our ranks.
1328420183845826560 2020-11-17 03:30:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I take these people aren't a fan of Ephesians?
1328376503562809346 2020-11-17 00:36:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Here I am thinking it was illegal to buy votes, silly me.
1328350462681227264 2020-11-16 22:53:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If you ever submitted code for computer class and there was a "glitch," you would fail. There are no glitches,  especially in a program that has only one job, to tabulate. Gimme an excel spreadsheet and we can fix this right now.
1328349133669871617 2020-11-16 22:48:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And we cannot get together for the holidays. I don't think people understand how much tourism Michigan counts on during the Holidays. We have our own Hallmark Christmas Town that gets over 1m visitors a year.
1328347644691886081 2020-11-16 22:42:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> On Friday, she and her henchman,  AG Nessel, are trying to shut down a gas pipeline from Enbridge. This will cause a shortage of propane in the U.P. for 300k and double the price of gasoline not to mention the thousands of job losses.
1327648674579689477 2020-11-15 00:24:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And when you say Hollywood you actually mean China.
1327436452901351424 2020-11-14 10:21:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SebGorka Seriously,  why do Democrats get away with breaking the law everywhere?
1327434211544936449 2020-11-14 10:12:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And "hospitalized" doesn't have the same meaning. Here in Michigan,  if you want to get actual medicine you have to go a hospital. If you don't, they'll give an inhaler. BTW, we have a PIC Code, Pneumonia, influenza and Covid. You have one of those you are another Covid case.
1327432171561365510 2020-11-14 10:04:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @HellOnHeels2020 You mean, his "daughter".
1327185089021800448 2020-11-13 17:42:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The fact you're asking tells us the answer is "No."
1326970142971088897 2020-11-13 03:28:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How do you have a title of Investigative Reporter when you come up with this Liberal BS?
1326969586571489282 2020-11-13 03:26:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, Trump Supporters are NeoNazis? Everything you say is already biased. This would be a good time to resign since impartiality isn't part of your character.
1326878073145479169 2020-11-12 21:22:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If you can't validate a ballot,  it must be thrown out. If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.
1326876992201961473 2020-11-12 21:18:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> No stimulus. No unemployment. Yah, this will be fun.
1326876121594548226 2020-11-12 21:14:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Back in the 80's I had a computer language class in HS. One of our programs had to count votes. There was no glitch. If I could do it in PASCAL 35 years ago,  you betcha, this was easy.
1326639380161847301 2020-11-12 05:34:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm equally concerned about the Senate and House races, namely John James of Michigan. I'm telling you,  there could be WH in his future.
1326636278591479809 2020-11-12 05:21:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @davidchapman141 Or it makes ballots without envelopes null and void.
1326280397337079809 2020-11-11 05:47:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's the White Liberal Elitist way.
1326205822599385092 2020-11-11 00:51:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Great news, now how about that Stimulus? While the world is spinning a lot of us who didn't sign up for this mess are hurting bigly and it's not getting better. Well, at least not under Gov Whitmer.
1326201605000228866 2020-11-11 00:34:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JudgeJeanlne @FoxNews Fox was fired a long time ago. See you at NewsMax!
1326136219571511297 2020-11-10 20:14:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wtf?!?
1326135288230514689 2020-11-10 20:11:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He actually sounds like the Democrat Party of old. At a time when there was critical thinking and NOT voting along Party lines. Nancy really has done a number on the Democrat Party.
1326133546961035266 2020-11-10 20:04:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JudgeJeaninefan @drzoegrey Hopefully we'll see you on NewsMax!
1326131514128609281 2020-11-10 19:56:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @dirtydiscooo Brett Kavanaugh on Kamala Harris
1326130810047631360 2020-11-10 19:53:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TimRunsHisMouth What audience?
1326119529181745152 2020-11-10 19:08:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Sassychickie What happens to all those countries who have already sent Joe a Congratulations, like Israel for example.?!?
1326111152221380609 2020-11-10 18:35:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EricTrump It's not crazy. It's Michigan. How do you think we are stuck with Rashid Tlaib? She used her father's address to get on the ballot. There was a lawsuit to stop the ballot from being used and tossing her off the ticket. You can guess what happened.
1326109747687387137 2020-11-10 18:29:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PaAmericangirl They only call what they see in themselves.
1326109519294902272 2020-11-10 18:28:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Cost cutting at its finest. Who's up for Universal Health Care?
1326109214943686657 2020-11-10 18:27:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How quickly do you think MSM will drop kick Biden once proving there was purposeful voter fraud and JB actually has 2m less votes? They're going to have jump ship off the Biden Titanic.
1326108126970580992 2020-11-10 18:23:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Has anyone noticed that with all the calls for recounts and audit, no one has asked, how many votes would Trump lose during this process?
1325731178154962945 2020-11-09 17:25:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DEPLORABLEREEG1 Any word on Joe's sexual assault allegation?
1325560533416808451 2020-11-09 06:07:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GoJackFlynn Soros, Pelosi and Feinstein- Who was asleep at the wheel to allow this?
1325559100663533568 2020-11-09 06:01:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @bigbettyblack45 Smart, articulate and your heart's in the right place, I say "good riddance."
1325552938333446145 2020-11-09 05:37:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope. I love everyone of these guys but there is no way in hell I'm watching FoxNews. They should have this line up at NewsMax.
1325551759255810050 2020-11-09 05:32:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not months,  4 Executive Orders. Basically his first hour in office.
1325472173595758594 2020-11-09 00:16:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> An attempted coup at least
1325469818598936581 2020-11-09 00:06:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EricMMatheny @KLUsa45 The same people who declare they read the bible but tear the pages they don't agree with.
1325467486595244038 2020-11-08 23:57:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Covid is simply just another flu strain. This "pandemic" is nothing but a farce to gain control over our lives so they can pick winners and losers and so far, we are all losing.
1325317846335971329 2020-11-08 14:02:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ChuckCallesto What's hard is we can't check our in person ballot in Michigan.
1325156758881521664 2020-11-08 03:22:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, by switching out all the players,  there'll be nothing
1325155036654166021 2020-11-08 03:15:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Amen
1325151032855420929 2020-11-08 03:00:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump I hope everyone knows that when this goes to the SCOTUS, Crying Chuck will be calling for Justice Barrett to recuse herself from giving an opinion which sets up a tie (thanks to CYA Roberts) which leads to the lower court decision(s) and we all know what that means.
1325150044136366080 2020-11-08 02:56:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MattWhitaker46 @Drispy2 100 years from now people will either ask, "Why did they let this happen?" Or "That's when we became a true Republic for the people by the people."
1325149475397009410 2020-11-08 02:53:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And when Biden "cleans house" to get rid of all those deplorable Trump holdovers,  he'll be able to stop all investigations into child trafficking, Hunter and the Clintons.
1325148835870552064 2020-11-08 02:51:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> No turning back! They win NOW they will win FOREVER.  Those Republicans keeping quiet,  you're fighting a losing battle.  2022 the same thing will happen but focused on you instead of Trump. Look how easy that would be.
1325147729115353089 2020-11-08 02:46:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TheLeoTerrell @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews @foxnation There were Reagan Democrats are there any Trump Democrats who truly are disgusted with their own party?
1325146469381320704 2020-11-08 02:41:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep
1325145795100880896 2020-11-08 02:39:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DAColdriver @Evlu6 And more minority groups have voted for Trump than at any time
1325145359329464320 2020-11-08 02:37:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed 1000%
1325135221268774913 2020-11-08 01:57:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Born7QThink 70m AND Counting!
1325135094886100992 2020-11-08 01:56:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If you don't know what this means, you had better learn and fast. Welcome China you have a friend in the WH!
1325134689124798465 2020-11-08 01:55:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @chuckwoolery They're laying over for a job their all going to lose in 2 years. If this works this time, they will always make it work. So, unless you become part of their cause, you'll be out. And that is how every Communist country is run.
1325134076114837504 2020-11-08 01:52:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kksheld Yes, go to Parler.
1325132741298462725 2020-11-08 01:47:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He's simply warming us up to great things to come, like AOC +3 and how they're going to fundamentally change the foundation of America to be more in line with Russia and China.
1325132186417156096 2020-11-08 01:45:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> What? That can't happen?
1325131830303969281 2020-11-08 01:43:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Still trying to hide the 9m "lost" votes.
1325131685776777217 2020-11-08 01:43:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SebGorka @JoeBiden @FoxNews I'll be watching FN like I watch CNN, MSNBC or any other propagandist machine for the Communist Left.
1325131124717318144 2020-11-08 01:40:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Conspiracy question that may or may not be way off base: When does the House pick their speaker? If this doesn't get resolved in time and the Speaker becomes President,  is it possible we could have AOC as President?!?
1325130446976397315 2020-11-08 01:38:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I guess I'm not getting what DC said that was so wrong?!? Isn't he saying there's no transparency and the courts will have to figure all of this out? Which is the truth.
1325129595503304706 2020-11-08 01:34:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And to delegitimize Trump's next 4 years.
1325129340997296128 2020-11-08 01:33:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Small town, knew lots of people, we got hugs and laughter (with masks on of course) but no mention of the C word.
1325128720982573062 2020-11-08 01:31:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Awesome
1325126822699405312 2020-11-08 01:23:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TimRunsHisMouth No, we start with inexpensive snacks at Five Below then we hit the liquor and beer emporium.
1324902185252085765 2020-11-07 10:31:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, it sure can. Now, you answer honestly, if things were in reverse, would you be doing the same thing, ensuring the integrity of the election?
1324901572351029253 2020-11-07 10:28:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ChuckCallesto Now we need John James to come out ahead
1324897244009652224 2020-11-07 10:11:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm thinking the justices on SCOTUS don't want court packing or court rotation any more than we do.
1324894320680448001 2020-11-07 09:59:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can we even list how many ways they've committed voter fraud? Ballot Harvesting  Voter Manipulation Throwing away ballots in bulk Mail In Ballots Ballot Box Stuffing Not allowing Republicans to observe No true ballot deadline  Computer Software  Just found ballots for Biden
1324889957002076160 2020-11-07 09:42:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MdelaSoledad90 üôèüí™üôèüí™
1324871502462902278 2020-11-07 08:29:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RepMarkGreen Yeah but how would they make sure their guy wins?
1324869432347406336 2020-11-07 08:21:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Too bad your colleagues couldn't hold giving AZ to Biden before Florida.
1324867929238876160 2020-11-07 08:15:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BrandonStraka Agreed.  They're only regret is they couldn't say "President-Elect Biden" earlier in the week.
1324867611440668673 2020-11-07 08:13:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RudyGiuliani Just as long as you investigate the software used in Michigan. Every precinct in every county should be required to manually count ballots!
1324809370417405955 2020-11-07 04:22:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklevinshow With all of their crimes about to be exposed to the world, they had to go this far to protect themselves. What a greater country we would have if the Swamp was all gone!?!
1324808560887345153 2020-11-07 04:19:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They should put together a montage of video clips from Trump Rallies, especially when the crowds would chant USA and We Love You and keep playing those in time slots on Fox, ABC, NBC, CNN and MSNBC.
1324806485227032585 2020-11-07 04:10:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SenJohnKennedy @TracyKarch2 Again, we need to clearly define what is a "Legal" vote because we all know Democrats will exploit every crack in the mortar.
1324803649558794241 2020-11-07 03:59:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, software was used in over 30 counties. It's a nationally used software.
1324802493352693762 2020-11-07 03:55:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Two birds, population control and election manipulation.
1324802039617097728 2020-11-07 03:53:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Listen to the interview on NewsMax
1324762473707298816 2020-11-07 01:16:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, easy peasy
1324762296116224006 2020-11-07 01:15:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes but did they vote?
1324761408551178241 2020-11-07 01:11:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can I ask a cynical question? If you're a postal worker with a  box of ballots,  why do you throw it the garbage? Why wouldn't you do everything to get rid of the evidence, like burn it or take them to somewhere a little more remote?
1324759791554711553 2020-11-07 01:05:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> #IStandWithTrump
1324759713117016066 2020-11-07 01:05:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Is that sarcasm, Kev?
1324759612235669507 2020-11-07 01:04:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If you've ever been to a Trump Rally,  you know there's a lot of love that goes both ways.
1324759164132990976 2020-11-07 01:02:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @chuckwoolery Here in Michigan,  there are many precincts that require picture ID, in fact, they scan your dl to ensure you can vote at that polling place. We never have any problems getting people in and counting their vote, Easy Peasy.
1324757877844774915 2020-11-07 00:57:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Thanks McConnell, now would be a good time to get ALL of the Senators together, side by side and back Trump saying those exact words. If Trump lost from legitimate votes would make this transition easier for Joe. If it's not legitimized, then it's gonna be a long 4 years.
1324757152876142593 2020-11-07 00:54:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Rhetorical question?!?
1324756858788347904 2020-11-07 00:53:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ever since Joe Biden's treatment of Clarence Thomas and Bill Clinton's arrogance of his escapades while in office.
1324756545322844162 2020-11-07 00:52:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Now is good
1324756433070624770 2020-11-07 00:52:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's a given. That was their insurance policy.  They worked with China. Why do you think Obama gave Wuhan so much $$ in the middle of his Presidency?
1324754629280804865 2020-11-07 00:44:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut @concetta8668 And they underestimate Trump and his Chumps again.
1324750941879443461 2020-11-07 00:30:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Real_G2DAZ You can probably register at polling station. Now we just need that list then find out if they voted anywhere else. You know, like how Antifa and BLM activists would go from town to town.
1324744084796440576 2020-11-07 00:02:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I think people are coming to the realization that Republicans are truly for the success of the Middle Class while the Left is only for the elitists.
1324743585770688513 2020-11-07 00:00:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Difference between us and them? If our Republican Party was pulling this crap, WE would be the ones putting a stop to it.
1324742938635591680 2020-11-06 23:58:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> way cool. Happy Birthday!
1324742739519561731 2020-11-06 23:57:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We all knew, especially Trump.
1324741641018769408 2020-11-06 23:53:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They needed to pad the numbers for Biden. Good enough explanation?!?
1324741371677335553 2020-11-06 23:52:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Kev, you're kidding right? He knows it. He knows he just has to stay vertical for another 6 months so he can protect his family's piggy bank and keep themselves out of jail.
1324651719419219968 2020-11-06 17:55:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Think he's more concerned about covering up the crimes he and his family have committed.
1324649561131016199 2020-11-06 17:47:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> No surprise  I'm sure we're now going to have a few RINOs come out and say Trump should concede for the good of the country. #IStandWithTrump
1324648615709708288 2020-11-06 17:43:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Knew this was going to happen
1324643253992435712 2020-11-06 17:22:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 Has that ever happened?!?
1324642340582182912 2020-11-06 17:18:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> #IStandWithTrump
1324641587230580737 2020-11-06 17:15:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Exactly how they like it. If the process is messy enough, you can get away with anything. Just look at any embezzlement case.
1324640022876823552 2020-11-06 17:09:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This has to be BS. We wouldn't have heard about this if voters didn't say, I used a Sharpie and my ballot has been cancelled.
1324637617275785216 2020-11-06 16:59:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I just remember how they switched their narrative 2 weeks back to "Don't mail them in, you must drop them off at a drop box." Knew they were going to use the lack of postmark to their advantage.
1324635374073819136 2020-11-06 16:50:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They do now because the lot of them are about to be exposed.
1324585609634189313 2020-11-06 13:33:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We first have to agree on the term "legal."
1324585408487968768 2020-11-06 13:32:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You'll understand the whole cabal had to go all in. Too many players on the cusp of getting this whole thing exposed. Once Biden's in, no more investigations into anything.
1324583603288842240 2020-11-06 13:25:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I used to have fox news as my home page... the ow its NewsMax.
1324583232210423808 2020-11-06 13:23:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They are bank rolled by George Soros no doubt.
1324454473339686912 2020-11-06 04:52:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hiding
1324454235572998146 2020-11-06 04:51:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mspdcali @RacySicilian In fact John James received 70k more votes than Trump.
1324452992846876673 2020-11-06 04:46:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @politicalelle @WarTimeGirl If we witnessed this happening in another country,  like Venezuela  or Cuba, we would all be saying  "Thank God we don't live there." Well, guess what?!?
1324451865858363395 2020-11-06 04:41:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They're blatant in their efforts. A mysterious 400k vote swing in the middle of the night in Michigan when nobody was supposed to be counting? Come on man.
1324451330698694656 2020-11-06 04:39:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Especially since Trump garnered more support from Black, Latino and Jewish groups than any time in history.
1324450227416387584 2020-11-06 04:35:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes
1324450119379537920 2020-11-06 04:34:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They allowed this to happen.  Everyone knew Mail In ballots would win the election for them because it's too easy to commit voter fraud but they just let it happen.
1324449646211702785 2020-11-06 04:32:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They've been showing their true colors for some time now. Hell just look at the pics they choose of Joe vs President Trump.
1324449306024312833 2020-11-06 04:31:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How are you going to prove they arrived after? Don't they throw away envelopes and now you just have a ballot? Isn't this why they're slow walking the counting? It shouldn't take days to count ballots.
1324376785493123080 2020-11-05 23:43:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Belarus negotiating a pay for play
1324376452683440128 2020-11-05 23:42:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Smart kid
1324376152627171330 2020-11-05 23:40:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @newtgingrich They want to put up President-Elect Biden on their screen so bad, they'll do anything.
1324375687722139650 2020-11-05 23:39:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert @WarTimeGirl It's not just Trump's seat but Senators and HOUSE Republicans that can be affected.
1324375421182484482 2020-11-05 23:38:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> "Would?" Or "Did" or "Will continue to"?
1324374400225976320 2020-11-05 23:33:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> SOS
1324374218029604864 2020-11-05 23:33:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Simply have Federal Minimums so States can have their own regulations but must be as tough as the Federal Statutes. Every financial industry is run this way.
1324342598069354497 2020-11-05 21:27:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ArtValley818_ Location
1324338696825569281 2020-11-05 21:12:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Antrim County used a software to calculate votes. There were only 2 votes counted for Trump.  This is a predominantly Republican County. Come to find out the software did not match the physical tape of votes. This software is used in 30+ counties in Michigan.
1324249649822208002 2020-11-05 15:18:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> When keep things a mess, it's a lot easier to do nefarious things.
1324240748208861185 2020-11-05 14:42:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LisaMarieBoothe Call Glenn Beck and move to Texas. He could use someone of your level of talent for The Blaze!
1324240376845291521 2020-11-05 14:41:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LisaMarieBoothe Is that directed toward your friends at Fox?
1324128640314023938 2020-11-05 07:17:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @HarrisLacey09 Did this happen?!?
1324128341755121666 2020-11-05 07:16:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yeh, that was the best 30 seconds... Hello NewsMax!
1324127728241659906 2020-11-05 07:13:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Here's something cool. Here in Michigan they have a PIC Code which stands for pneumonia, influenza, and Covid. If you are diagnosed with any one of these it's marked as a CV-19 case.
1324126940303949825 2020-11-05 07:10:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And Michigan!!!
1324126815775002627 2020-11-05 07:10:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> No,but if things were reversed you'd be doing the same thing, but the only difference is we would be helping.
1324124980632788999 2020-11-05 07:02:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 Who the hell is this Barr everyone keeps asking about?!?
1324124837841915910 2020-11-05 07:02:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Amen
1324123859390443521 2020-11-05 06:58:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I stopped watching them earlier this year. Too many left pushes for me.
1324123416207757314 2020-11-05 06:56:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We have to audit every single Mail In Ballot
1324122347318726658 2020-11-05 06:52:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wish I knew how here in Michigan
1324122048562683904 2020-11-05 06:51:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wouldn't that be a a peaceful transition if everyone agreed they won fair and square? But, too many things do not add up. If they've done nothing wrong then they shouldn't worry about the outcome,  it'll be the same, right?
1324121422520815617 2020-11-05 06:48:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Notice it's not "legal" vote... Come on man.
1324120636294336517 2020-11-05 06:45:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> #Sharpiegate
1324120389568602112 2020-11-05 06:44:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed
1324120156382154753 2020-11-05 06:43:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I refuse to believe that a guy who had tens of thousands of people wait for hours out in the cold rainy weather lose to a guy who couldn't fill a parking lot with his best buddy Barry.
1324085010027159554 2020-11-05 04:24:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Tucker and Levin are the only shows I can watch
1324084602215026688 2020-11-05 04:22:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We need an audit of every mail in ballot!
1324083961421844482 2020-11-05 04:19:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope, markets don't move on  hunches, they only move on data.
1324083522093666304 2020-11-05 04:18:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep and that takes a couple of weeks.
1324053280331280385 2020-11-05 02:17:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And MI by 10,000 votes  https://t.co/ABptgJf6wJ
1324052402899685376 2020-11-05 02:14:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SebGorka We made Fox a large organization over the years with our viewership. We can do the same at NewsMax.
1324052053346422785 2020-11-05 02:13:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Please RT!  We need a PSA to get the word out to all legal voters in AZ AND MI.
1324050704470810626 2020-11-05 02:07:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JanielovesDJT While wearing their red shoes
1324050446919544838 2020-11-05 02:06:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> AND Michigan!!!
1324046964112109568 2020-11-05 01:52:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Still would like WI and MI
1324041318528634881 2020-11-05 01:30:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed
1324039231740792833 2020-11-05 01:22:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And we didn't lose any Senate seats?
1324038487113424898 2020-11-05 01:19:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @realannapaulina @blueANDblack4me This is what we witness in 3rd World Countries not here in the US. Why do we count by hand? Too easy to manipulate and cheat?!?
1324033756185972736 2020-11-05 01:00:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut First Paul Ryan screws us on Repeal and Replace and now this!
1324017252925132801 2020-11-04 23:54:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's also physically impossible. How big is a pile of 130,000 ballots? That's about 260 reams of printer paper. We're expected to believe that?
1324014864638029826 2020-11-04 23:45:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wayne County only had 13% tabulated and they're now counting Mail In  ballots. James is not going to win our State. Depressing doesn't even cover it. He would have been awesome given the chance.
1324014417261010951 2020-11-04 23:43:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can anyone show what a 100,000 votes looks like? The township I vote in cast 40,000 on election day. They have a room with boxes up to the ceiling of ballots. It's like saying I found $1m under my couch cushion.
1324012951926439939 2020-11-04 23:37:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Detrow has always been shady. 2 election clerks have been thrown in jail, just since 2016.
1324012731394105345 2020-11-04 23:36:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And they counted a lot very quickly.  So quick, one has to wonder why they don't use the same process for the rest so we can get this thing done?!?
1324012445267120130 2020-11-04 23:35:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep
1324011860656574466 2020-11-04 23:33:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Sad to hear
1324010980301545474 2020-11-04 23:29:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Don't know how except we've already put two election clerks in jail from the last federal general election.
1324010647852601344 2020-11-04 23:28:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why are we so fixated on the transparency of counting the ballots.? All that will do is legitimize all of those bogus mail in ballots. Why not instead,  audit the ballots to ensure they are from US Citizens, Living, Not incarcerated and there is only one per voter?!?
1323977289026207750 2020-11-04 21:15:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They threw out integrity when they started mail in ballots and changing election laws.
1323975572788305922 2020-11-04 21:09:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We just saw this on the Netflix Series "The Queen's Gambit" where a player can call a timeout and then resume play the following day so they can strategize with their team on how they can win the match.
1323686980220293121 2020-11-04 02:02:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @stclairashley Michigan!
1323686852109414402 2020-11-04 02:01:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, John James our next Republican Senate Superstar!
1323685807601995777 2020-11-04 01:57:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Good sign
1323685579469524999 2020-11-04 01:56:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> My son who also just turned 18 voted for the first time (straight Republican I may add). He is pumped!
1323685173272203264 2020-11-04 01:55:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @bigbettyblack45 Well, there is a Hell, Michigan, so there's that! Hollyweird is like Sodom. IMHO
1323684862725890048 2020-11-04 01:53:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LLewellyan Go Trump
1323650803052236800 2020-11-03 23:38:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Amen
1323650255741747202 2020-11-03 23:36:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just glad we haven't seen Black Panthers with AR15s standing in front of polling places like we did in 2016.
1323649826320515074 2020-11-03 23:34:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Brendy438 Sure wish Trump would have said this during the last debate.
1323649701753851906 2020-11-03 23:34:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed
1323649584585990145 2020-11-03 23:33:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> What's the over under on getting results tonight?
1323649388988739593 2020-11-03 23:33:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @NicoleArbour Let us know when you get an answer!
1323648514472247300 2020-11-03 23:29:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The FBI?
1323648422239444995 2020-11-03 23:29:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If only I could look that good in a hat!
1323648046308220929 2020-11-03 23:27:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Now that ALL the Republicans are behind Trump, look at how much we'll be able to accomplish!
1323647617352556544 2020-11-03 23:25:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Oh yeah!
1323647422871048193 2020-11-03 23:25:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> One day I too will be lucky enough to bump into Terrence!
1323630121669021697 2020-11-03 22:16:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's awesome!

1323627667967643650 2020-11-03 22:06:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> She has ensured that Trump voters will stay in line no matter how long it takes.
1323584420952051712 2020-11-03 19:14:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And beautiful!
1323480629212753925 2020-11-03 12:22:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You answered your own question
1323480006304124929 2020-11-03 12:19:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice title... our NEXT President? Will Trump stay bbn in bbn office or get reelected, so many options to choose from yet you go with the left leaning title because you're smarter than the rest of us.
1323479403461070848 2020-11-03 12:17:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Go get em
1323479148543856640 2020-11-03 12:16:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Virtue Signaling so they can say look at the division Trump brought us.
1323478631927209985 2020-11-03 12:14:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Even in his commercials, he looks like he's scolding us for not picking up the laundry off the floor.
1323401219948355585 2020-11-03 07:06:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Love ya brother!!
1323400989857189888 2020-11-03 07:05:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That is boss!!!
1323400798219444225 2020-11-03 07:05:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EndlessJeopardy What is a Vijay-Jay?
1323399971178242051 2020-11-03 07:01:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, Michigan Supreme Court issued the same verdict.  It is now worse. Her appointed Health Services Director,  who has no Medical Background,  but does have Harvard and Yale degrees has effectively doubled up on her mandates.
1323367460943351810 2020-11-03 04:52:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, things have gotten worse ever since the Supreme Court struck down her Orders.
1323365780298321922 2020-11-03 04:46:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ScottAdamsSays Yep I'm just hoping a majority are not inspired to vote.
1323364129852297217 2020-11-03 04:39:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wishful thinking. Maybe he will do it tomorrow while no one's looking.
1323363883118137344 2020-11-03 04:38:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Pallets of Ballots stashed in the back.
1323362616769740802 2020-11-03 04:33:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They should make a documentary just on his rallies.
1323361059231703042 2020-11-03 04:27:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed. Very cumbersome. Like trying to get through a maze with 100ft tall barriers.
1323326437542240256 2020-11-03 02:09:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TinkCarla Oan
1323322953682067456 2020-11-03 01:55:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice Math!
1323291908198879233 2020-11-02 23:52:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This does not get enough attention.
1323291311424917505 2020-11-02 23:50:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RepMattGaetz It's all about ushering in Kamala
1323291083732848640 2020-11-02 23:49:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Let's ask Venezuela or the new and improved Australia how that's working out.
1323288736352870401 2020-11-02 23:39:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealRLimbaugh I am scared of Joe Biden becoming President because that would also mean we have lost the Senate and they've strengthened their House. All will be too late to change anything in 2022 and 2024.
1323255828514807808 2020-11-02 21:29:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> These nuns live close by our house off of a pretty busy highway. They've had huge Trump signs out by the highway for almost a year!
1323255224560193536 2020-11-02 21:26:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> üôèüôè
1323254903574319105 2020-11-02 21:25:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's a great day in Michigan.  Today marks the day we have show ID AND provide a phone number (will be verified) at every restaurant and bar. Compliments of an appointed bureaucrat by our Governor even after our Supreme Court has struck down all of her Executive Orders.
1323252757684457480 2020-11-02 21:16:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hannahudomlee @thehill Not going to get real news from the Hill...
1323041768959545360 2020-11-02 07:18:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PatriotM89 Yeah, but if she had a script in front of her she would have nailed it!
1323037404995923970 2020-11-02 07:01:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because he loves everyone in this country and everyone should have the same opportunities for success.
1323036624704385024 2020-11-02 06:58:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why can't people do just a little due diligence and critical thinking on their own? The numbers do not add up. We're being duped and manipulated to give them permission to lose our liberties.
1323036038630178819 2020-11-02 06:55:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This will happen here,  no question. Leftist Elites already have this ground game happening.
1323035225761452034 2020-11-02 06:52:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @HollyWilhelm4 @TawniBoyd Let's go Tommy Tutone
1323034117630533633 2020-11-02 06:48:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Isn't everything an "assault weapon?" Take this pencil for example, I was saw John Wick kill 3 men with just a pencil...
1322766362251505664 2020-11-01 13:04:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Even after two failed attempts
1322761505784344576 2020-11-01 12:44:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MBOKSR_MAGA @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump This should be a commercial
1322760075048591360 2020-11-01 12:39:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ok, that is funny.
1322736897647628290 2020-11-01 11:07:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yeah Mom!!
1322733520322789376 2020-11-01 10:53:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That sounds like fun
1322732263663144960 2020-11-01 10:48:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep
1322705939854696450 2020-11-01 09:04:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Cool, then you wouldn't mind answering a few questions in front of a grand jury.
1322705712863154181 2020-11-01 09:03:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I call BS. Fake news.
1322705097680474112 2020-11-01 09:00:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @McKaylaRoseJ It should be synonymous with I have the flu.
1322704721916952576 2020-11-01 08:59:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Maybe he hasn't seen the stories about the laptop from hell.
1322703341152047104 2020-11-01 08:53:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Go Milford, MI!!!
1322650447736430592 2020-11-01 05:23:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Happy Birthday Mr. Jones!!! Please RT to give a fellow patriot some love on his BDAY!
1322648181029638147 2020-11-01 05:14:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed. And many of the answers he had to give during the debates,  he wouldn't have to.
1322647893690454016 2020-11-01 05:13:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's rather biblical, gleaning off their harvest for me.
1322645783259320321 2020-11-01 05:05:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Funny!!!
1322636651059961858 2020-11-01 04:28:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not a mistake when it happens over and over again.
1322529238310858753 2020-10-31 21:21:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Virtue Signaling
1322529008374980610 2020-10-31 21:21:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Past "viruses", the doctors always say, "Nothing to do but get plenty rest and drink lots of water and it'll run its course." So Biden, how are you going to close down the virus? Unless, you know something God doesn't even know. Or is it how Covid cases are counted?
1322528214670020614 2020-10-31 21:17:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It won't be made by Ben &amp; Jerry's.
1322527983022809088 2020-10-31 21:16:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Love it!
1322527770828820489 2020-10-31 21:16:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I agreed with almost everything here... Newton, you said "even"... nope they're doing this on purpose.  I'd put in the word,  "especially."
1322526524038402048 2020-10-31 21:11:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And giving us an expanded version of health insurance that we can't afford now.
1322526277333622784 2020-10-31 21:10:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They're like an abusive older brother. They get two younger siblings to fight and leave the room. Then when the parents can't take the noise anymore,  the older brother steps and calms everything down. Now exalted as hero from the gullible parents, asks for $20 &amp; keys to the car.
1322525456248295425 2020-10-31 21:06:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That is funny sh*t, pun intended.
1322208919251505153 2020-10-31 00:09:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Employees are never more dangerous than their employers.
1322208565885587458 2020-10-31 00:07:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And now, hasn't China, Russia and Iran bought our new President?
1322208271403491328 2020-10-31 00:06:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Doesn't he have to keep up his end of of the bargain? Doesn't whoever has given him millions make sure he gets in?
1322151068587991041 2020-10-30 20:19:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wow
1322150079340400640 2020-10-30 20:15:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And if he does, there will be a bunch of Senators and House Reps right behind them.  After getting a stimulus package through, and Indicting Biden, Clinton and Omar, I think they should push for voting reform complete with Voter ID since 2022 is right around the corner.
1322148869963218946 2020-10-30 20:10:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Did Lil Wayne ever date Chelsea? She seems to be the doorknob, everyone getting their turn.
1322148549895852034 2020-10-30 20:09:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It was quiet there for awhile which is a great thing. What we found was more and more "minority" people groups were migrating to other parts of their communities by buying their first homes or buying bigger and rental homes. SBO's were through the roof the last 3 years!
1322147778450071553 2020-10-30 20:06:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, Bernie and Elizabeth have to be pissed. Maybe that's why they are getting whatever job they want under Joe.
1322147341562978305 2020-10-30 20:04:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So you are saying this is an Anti-Marxist flag then? You know, since BLM has nothing to do with empowering "black" lives and more to creating anarchy and fear in our communities.
1322146707577180163 2020-10-30 20:01:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Amen, exactly. Thank you for saying so. We want everyone to have the same opportunities to find and keep success. We don't pick winners.  Keep Equality on the left side of the equation and not on the right. Your results are only limited by your imagination and commitment. GB!
1322144981059076097 2020-10-30 19:55:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> As it should be
1322142895734951948 2020-10-30 19:46:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'd like to see their respective FBARs. It's a serious federal offense if they leave piles of money off this foreign asset report.
1322142284687806468 2020-10-30 19:44:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> On all sides... especially younger voters.
1322141936464072704 2020-10-30 19:42:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They don't care.  They know the places they need "extra" ballots. Changing rules and laws for coerced ballots, harvesting ballots and multiple ballots will make this thing in the bag. This is how they're acting.
1322140960906686464 2020-10-30 19:39:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I guess the Girl Scouts don't teach having convictions in your Principles and standing up for what is right.
1322036194574770176 2020-10-30 12:42:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And while you're at it, name one thing they've done well for any US Citizen.  I'll wait.
1322035225195614208 2020-10-30 12:38:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Doesn't matter. The FEC or the Republicans or the DOJ won't be doing anything about it.
1321974292008128513 2020-10-30 08:36:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's all he has is doom and gloom.
1321972849461088257 2020-10-30 08:31:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I wish DJT would advertise by picking apart his lies. He's still talking about things that have already been debunked. Besides Covid and hating Trump,  what is their platform?
1321972368944889857 2020-10-30 08:29:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He will give us all free healthcare, a minimum basic wage and a place to live for free. Then on our way to BK, he'll let everyone know they'll have to confiscate all property and future earnings,  ration healthcare and food while moving you to a more strategic location. USSR!!
1321971659855831042 2020-10-30 08:26:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> In custody,  turning State's evidence.  Wishful thinking.
1321971476858363905 2020-10-30 08:25:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why didn't they cover this during their primaries? Bernie and Co. have to be po'd they "lost" to Biden.
1321924949184008192 2020-10-30 05:20:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @miles_commodore When the dropping of temperatures no longer fit the narrative.
1321924706652532736 2020-10-30 05:19:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice try though. A little too good. Would have loved to see this, but Hunter would've been "suicided" by now. They'll deny this until they steal every federal, state and local election. None 9f this will come to light which should scare the hell out of all of us, especially Dems.
1321878758056513536 2020-10-30 02:17:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump But if we don't get a stimulus package,  we're all going to look like NYC.
1321783080965865473 2020-10-29 19:56:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> üòáüôèüôèüí™üôè
1321782371377651712 2020-10-29 19:54:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed. Unless all their mail is being compromised this is the only theory that fits.
1321780458494042112 2020-10-29 19:46:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Out of 800 polled...  How to come up with any meaningful stats with that little of a pool? And I'm sure 600 of them were die hard Dems.
1321779713661194246 2020-10-29 19:43:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope
1321657043632164866 2020-10-29 11:36:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This would be hilarious if it wasn't so true.
1321656031496253440 2020-10-29 11:32:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KelemenCari Hollyweird
1321655551638544384 2020-10-29 11:30:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hope she gave additional names of other volunteers so we can back track all of the voters to ensure they voted the way they wanted.
1321572892761640961 2020-10-29 06:01:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because they want to be the first, doesn't matter who or how, it simply matters that they can forever say, we had the first woman President. Just like they can say we had the first Black President.
1321515867897737218 2020-10-29 02:15:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not so sure Matt. Voter fraud with complicit media and government agencies will make it happen.
1321515247560237057 2020-10-29 02:12:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ASoftstar In other words, you can accidentally put a bun in the oven but not a cake.
1321467527709511681 2020-10-28 23:03:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Don't they own most of Hollyweird too?
1321421245691449345 2020-10-28 19:59:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Could not agree more
1321419679295037442 2020-10-28 19:52:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> ER for Q1 should be happening in a few weeks. Expect even better growth numbers and hopefully some insight as to Healight.
1321401598141235200 2020-10-28 18:41:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealJamesWoods Because if they started now then the past 5 years would be for nothing.
1321274946627244033 2020-10-28 10:17:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Shall we go through Obama's budget?
1321274735775387651 2020-10-28 10:16:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gregkellyusa @fbag_mag @TuckerCarlson @JoeBiden Now we need Joe to come in and give his statement under oath.
1321274497375326208 2020-10-28 10:16:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TuckerCarlson I guess he forgot that there is a two tiered justice system here in America.
1321274224087093249 2020-10-28 10:14:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And we love the 2.0 Leo!!!
1321274110765338635 2020-10-28 10:14:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Like every crime boss in every crime family has said, ever.
1321273908990017536 2020-10-28 10:13:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @dylan_lueck @hootie39588772 @CNN Why would they cover Russia Disinformation? They've already said their peace and that's all they're gonna say about that.
1321273630702116870 2020-10-28 10:12:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> When are the Senate hearings regarding Joe? If you can't get us a stimulus package,  at least get us some entertainment as we get evicted from our homes.
1321273285821321218 2020-10-28 10:11:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> When are the Senate hearings?!?
1321271095039873032 2020-10-28 10:02:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Did anyone pick up the fact they were part of the $100b Russian and Chinese energy company? No wonder Joe doesn't want us to be energy independent.
1321270632756191232 2020-10-28 10:00:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @skol_kel @DJT20209 It'll break my heart if nothing comes of this.
1321270444591370240 2020-10-28 09:59:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> 39000!!!
1321227402434011137 2020-10-28 07:08:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @joshdcaplan Wouldn't worry too much about it,  how many people are actually watching CNN?
1321227070534569987 2020-10-28 07:07:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 Lying low, like they have kidnapped his kids and holding them for ransom so he'll keep his big mouth shut, low.
1321226104724664322 2020-10-28 07:03:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Go get em Senator Ted!
1321224804930912257 2020-10-28 06:58:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @80sMetalGaga @PISDI94_96 I get the feeling you weren't a libtard there either.
1321224494221008897 2020-10-28 06:57:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Isn't there  a vacancy left to fill from ACB's Appellate Bench?
1321224079526035456 2020-10-28 06:55:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You mean they got things done at a normal pace instead of the government pace? Are you kidding,  if this were in the private sector she would have been hired two weeks ago.
1321193703915048961 2020-10-28 04:55:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They will come back to vote if there is an agreement made.
1321193325999869953 2020-10-28 04:53:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealJamesWoods Trump wakes up every morning with a single mission, how do I make this country better? Schumer wakes up with a goal of how do I get more power?
1321192292028502019 2020-10-28 04:49:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RichardGrenell That was awesome!
1321191398402592768 2020-10-28 04:45:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Agreed.  He had to have known. How incompetent would you be if you didn't?
1321190125628497922 2020-10-28 04:40:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Do bv you think the workers who have to put the circles in place laugh their butts off while doing it?
1321189769196507136 2020-10-28 04:39:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They're the ones, along with their co-conspirators in the media that have e made our country so divisive.
1321189371526160384 2020-10-28 04:37:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So will we
1321188900505853963 2020-10-28 04:35:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, you are you pandering puppet. You'll do exactly what the Chinese and Russians tell you to do.
1321185701808013314 2020-10-28 04:23:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They are propagandists and should be treated as such.
1321151384025243648 2020-10-28 02:06:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Good, all the Dems can stay home on the 3rd while the rest bring 5 friends to vote Trump and Republican Senate, House, state Courts
1321150853672280064 2020-10-28 02:04:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Which would you choose between Trump with Dem Senate and House or Biden with Rep Senate and House?
1321150161234571264 2020-10-28 02:01:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This is probably the Gretchen effect.  So tired of her tyranny that we'll do everything to get her out. Vote Red, especially in the House and Senate.
1321149813417791490 2020-10-28 02:00:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Where is Barr, Wray etc.? Equal justice,  that's all we're asking for.
1321149565228244993 2020-10-28 01:59:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's a public speaking trick. When you have words to say that carry no value to your audience you provide weight to your words with needless volume and emotion. If you something that is important to someone all you have to do is whisper like "I love you."
1321148799197286400 2020-10-28 01:56:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Beautiful comment.
1321148035271897089 2020-10-28 01:53:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Tell that to Paul Ryan.
1321147574066302976 2020-10-28 01:51:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KamVTV Now I may not be up on the latest slang, but does chump now mean awesome chick in a great hat?!?
1321146716092059649 2020-10-28 01:48:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This was not lost on me.
1321146394334400517 2020-10-28 01:47:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BognerSabine Oh yes, I have read through some articles about this, fascinating read!
1321107442424578048 2020-10-27 23:12:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I don't know what this says but I'm sure it's "We love Trump."
1321107053767757824 2020-10-27 23:10:41 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TrumpRulzz At least he'll have plenty of time to talk about his cookbook.
1321106652913930247 2020-10-27 23:09:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LisaMarieBoothe Can anyone tell me who the VP will be when KH takes over? Who chooses?
1321106363301462017 2020-10-27 23:07:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DineshDSouza Yep, everyone who expressed that there is no way coyotes can carry a human.
1321105185540874241 2020-10-27 23:03:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Sounds like Michigan even after our Supreme Court said you can't.
1321074710084538369 2020-10-27 21:02:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> South Carolina,  we need Graham to keep his seat on the Senate!
1321074499308191744 2020-10-27 21:01:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MarkMeadows Great news! Now bring us better news with a Stimulus Package.
1321074098513076224 2020-10-27 20:59:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That and the fact there are no laws that state a deadline before an election. If Dems don't like it, pass a law. We all know if the shoe were on the other foot, we'd be looking at 6 - 3 court the other way.
1321071905902858240 2020-10-27 20:51:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GeorgiaPine8 They ran into out of skanks to cry sexual assault.
1320948875994238977 2020-10-27 12:42:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Congratulations. Now get a Covid relief package passed immediately too many people hurting right now.  Evictions,  repos, utilities and late credit card payments are coming at the end of this week.
1320948033517953024 2020-10-27 12:38:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SantoFiardina How are polls showing that Joe is winning or Conservative pundits are saying this is a close race? DJT is busting his butt and JB has not done anything yet we're to believe that at best it's tied up?
1320945780308516864 2020-10-27 12:29:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> There is no taking away healthcare for anyone. Stop with the scare tactics. Don't you guys actually have a legitimate idea that people can get behind?
1320803652911681536 2020-10-27 03:05:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SenSanders And look CDC just stated that they counted 130,000 deaths as Covid when they shouldn't have, bringing it down to 90k.
1320802604012752903 2020-10-27 03:00:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just the SC Polls
1320802438295805954 2020-10-27 03:00:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, if I wear an American Flag mask to the polling station will they make me take it off?
1320802000708292613 2020-10-27 02:58:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice try... Large, enormous or massive does it matter what adjective they used to describe the amount of crack?
1320799589646127105 2020-10-27 02:48:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So you can legislate from the bench? How about doing it like our framers created. Put together a bill, vote on it, make it law. Pretty simple. Unless of course you're trying to implement something we're too stupid to possibly understand.
1320798863570161664 2020-10-27 02:46:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @drdavidsamadi Isn't our total death rate in the US down so far this year?
1320798707118415879 2020-10-27 02:45:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Couldn't agree more. It's important to understand that WALL Street Money Managers control the market both sides, long and short. It is even more important that you k not ow most of them are Elitist Democrats. Sinking Dow is from Earnings week &amp; No stimulus plan.
1320797550027440133 2020-10-27 02:40:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Purposefully hid the truth
1320793722972442630 2020-10-27 02:25:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm going
1320708703667048448 2020-10-26 20:47:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Doesn't everyone want a Justice who will judge without preconceived ideas?
1320706704355581952 2020-10-26 20:39:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And the unknown VP once KH gets in
1320692886359474176 2020-10-26 19:44:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, but they're gonna talk about next month. You know just in time for what they hope is a transition to a new President.
1320691035132014594 2020-10-26 19:37:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How are you going to quarantine us in our homes when your party won't get a stimulus package done and there are thousands of evictions going to be taking place here in the next couple of weeks?
1320680461593706496 2020-10-26 18:55:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's awesome!
1320676782681563136 2020-10-26 18:40:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Sassychickie They caught us
1320495725818634240 2020-10-26 06:41:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealJamesWoods He's always been a hot head.  Every time he lies and he knows that who ever is listening knows he's lying,  he starts yelling.
1320492731089768454 2020-10-26 06:29:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> But we do... 50 of them all at once and then each United State tells us who won their tallies.
1320490685578022912 2020-10-26 06:21:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And hopefully pass a stimulus package to boot or there's gonna be a lot of hurting people
1320456492726833152 2020-10-26 04:05:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because he doesn't. They got pallets of filled out ballots to make sure he wins
1320364891052609537 2020-10-25 22:01:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why is Tara Reade being swept away by the media?
1320362259525271553 2020-10-25 21:51:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Funny, but I have to imagine there are people who are doing that as we speak.
1320361912962527233 2020-10-25 21:49:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Or is it one of those things that we all carry it in our bodies and then have flare ups every now and again?
1320361482454994947 2020-10-25 21:48:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If we have learned anything from Trump it's Say what you mean, Mean what you say. JB knows what he's saying,  the panderer that he is.
1320356826962079744 2020-10-25 21:29:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Only by mistake.
1320355929083301892 2020-10-25 21:25:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes. It would not surprise me to find out he helped in constructing the plan.
1320355187500998656 2020-10-25 21:23:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's only going to get worse from here
1320354769324605440 2020-10-25 21:21:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They're going after you Joe. You and your corruption.
1320354453434892290 2020-10-25 21:20:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Really?
1320354185485877249 2020-10-25 21:19:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Thinking the same thing
1320353984385863681 2020-10-25 21:18:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I pray that you are right!
1320353776709079042 2020-10-25 21:17:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Where are our Republicans to make sure she is held to account for breaking a federal election law? Are they going to set up shop at every polling station with a local DNC rep?
1320352726098784256 2020-10-25 21:13:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Gotta imagine tweets like this would have big numbers except we now have to give a response to retweet this slowing the trends way down in order for The DNC to say, see we're winning.
1320351945199144960 2020-10-25 21:10:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Make up lie. Have 2nd "news pundit" verify. It becomes fact. This circle of deceit happens every day in DNC world.
1320351401093025792 2020-10-25 21:07:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice catch
1320350904445526017 2020-10-25 21:06:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Do they really pimp out their  kids? Why does that not surprise me?
1320350564862001154 2020-10-25 21:04:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice play
1320349927365578752 2020-10-25 21:02:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This tells you all you need to know about JB's true tax plan.
1320349266678865922 2020-10-25 20:59:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Pass?!? They'll make her relevant again.
1320348969751486466 2020-10-25 20:58:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's why he changed who was doing the collection of data.
1320348654260060161 2020-10-25 20:57:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We just need to get liberals to ask the same question.
1320348420259909633 2020-10-25 20:56:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How does JB have the poll numbers they're stating? The best campaign is running tv commercials ad nauseam?
1320347779558985728 2020-10-25 20:53:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Well worth the read
1320346771541889025 2020-10-25 20:49:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nice play
1320346704324009985 2020-10-25 20:49:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They were awesome!
1320346530310688769 2020-10-25 20:48:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Unbelievable that we have to explain this... term limits AND IQ tests should be law.
1320346133177270275 2020-10-25 20:47:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep
1320250224871354368 2020-10-25 14:25:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I feel so bbn part of the group now. I too have to comment just to retweet.
1320249606337331202 2020-10-25 14:23:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep
1320184177543827456 2020-10-25 10:03:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Patriotic86 Favorite part of the country
1319972550756208641 2020-10-24 20:02:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmeraldRobinson Can we get someone now that is highly partisan FOR the Conservatives? This get somebody in the middle doesn't quite work.
1319972081291972613 2020-10-24 20:00:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wow, can we see that on tv, right after every JB ad?
1319829097892204546 2020-10-24 10:32:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> For answers
1319828249560698885 2020-10-24 10:29:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I would laugh out loud if I ever saw this.
1319827487090757639 2020-10-24 10:26:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Where's Paul Ryan, I thought he had the plan for Repeal and Replace?
1319780001143836678 2020-10-24 07:17:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @conservativebre Why do you think they take taxes out of your paycheck? You are prepaying your tax bill at tax time.
1319779768255057920 2020-10-24 07:16:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments is a law for everyone.  You don't pay the IRS hits you with penalties and interest.
1319635297026641920 2020-10-23 21:42:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @IngrahamAngle Same look from Wallace
1319635049688584193 2020-10-23 21:41:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope... both babysitters for JB.
1319634705160032258 2020-10-23 21:40:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Beg1Girl Healight. Cedar Sinai Hospital in California. Check it out.
1319633994401652736 2020-10-23 21:37:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Amphetamines make dry mouth
1319632797758349312 2020-10-23 21:32:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JackPosobiec Yes, but he's going to replace them with government jobs at $15/hr by taxing the "rich".
1319632386154442754 2020-10-23 21:30:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Maybe if they called them drug mules or child traffickers they would have gotten it.
1319631916799303680 2020-10-23 21:29:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @WarTimeGirl Why are you listening to a little boy man? He knows absolutely nothing and what's worse,  he thinks he knows everything.
1319629921128534016 2020-10-23 21:21:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @FancyBitch_Here Yes, but you have a beautiful avi pic so a certain level of bitchiness is expected, so it's all good.
1319613939412586499 2020-10-23 20:17:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And the Chinese Company...
1319613777952841730 2020-10-23 20:16:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just think how the debate would have gone if they had an actual neutral moderator!
1319612716928126977 2020-10-23 20:12:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I could tell who won the debate just by the look on Wallace's face.
1319608344181616643 2020-10-23 19:55:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Like all DNC "facts" insurance plans were there, they just became way too expensive so we had to "choose" to do something else. My same plan went from $300/mo to $1,800 with a $6k deductible.
1319607489911050241 2020-10-23 19:51:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Congressional hearing
1319607303365136384 2020-10-23 19:51:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Biden has said ban fracking as many times as Trump has denounced White Supremacists.
1319606712073134080 2020-10-23 19:48:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> NewsMax!
1319606482170687490 2020-10-23 19:47:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We're saying your family did.  We're saying there is a gigantic slush fund earmarked for you to use. That's how it works. Again,  we're not stupid.
1319512387226140677 2020-10-23 13:34:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I guess you don't have to pass an IQ test before running for office.
1319511916436508673 2020-10-23 13:32:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yet to see any tv ads listing Joe's accomplishments. If you're in a job interview, isn't that what you lead with?
1319510800994914305 2020-10-23 13:27:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DLoesch Had to change plans. Had to change doctors. Now have to pay $1200 a month plus $5000 deductible. Yep, this is affordable.  Before it was a little over $200 with a $2000 deductible for the same coverage.
1319509517772722176 2020-10-23 13:22:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Did anyone think Joe was a little too rehearsed with his 2 minute answers? Don't know if he got the questions before hand or not, but it sure seemed he memorized some answers. So what do you think was on his writing tablet and note cards? How long was the IV of adderall in for?
1319507562224549888 2020-10-23 13:14:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LATiffani1 Or when the moderator interrupted or always letting Joe have the last word
1319381566825660416 2020-10-23 04:54:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Could this be true?!?  Hunter Biden's 'don't mention Joe' ex-partner to be Trump's debate guest  https://t.co/9PB32az1BS via @nypost
1319337574733959171 2020-10-23 01:59:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 What does this have to do with Stormy Daniels?
1319337140166209536 2020-10-23 01:57:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @charliekirk11 They chose Biden over Bernie (and the rest). This tells you how much of a trojan horse JB will be. I would still like to know who will be KH's VP when that time comes?
1319274029463736320 2020-10-22 21:46:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BrandonStraka Just a money grab for ActBlue so they can move money wherever they want.
1319273362498072581 2020-10-22 21:44:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He pressed JB for a bigger cut and got denied, probably from the Big Guy stating that if it wasn't for him nonsense. So Hunter made good on his promise to blow the whole thing up.
1319271994769219585 2020-10-22 21:38:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealJamesWoods This by no means gets Crooked Hillary off
1319271619072851968 2020-10-22 21:37:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Do they teach that at DNC Socialist School? How to look like you're talking to thousands while actually talking to a really spread out dinner table?
1319269913924669442 2020-10-22 21:30:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @QTWIQ Best looking ankles on Twitter if I do say so myself.
1319269666615971841 2020-10-22 21:29:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SweetSoaps What he's saying is you're hot... just not that hot which I interpret as there's the surface of the sun and then there are solar flares, you're just not that hot... basically you're pretty smokin!
1319257446418886657 2020-10-22 20:41:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LisaMarieBoothe The reason why I am a Republican
1319254681034674179 2020-10-22 20:30:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Love this guy!!!
1319252793715286018 2020-10-22 20:22:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> No! Why raise taxes on anyone? In fact, let's have a 2nd round of Tax Cuts like Trump wants to do. More money in our pockets works a lot better than yours.
1319252311164805120 2020-10-22 20:20:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He even has plagiarized his campaign speeches from a decade ago. Same platitudes and lies. Promises Made Promises Kept.
1319251513429155841 2020-10-22 20:17:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LisaMarieBoothe Career Politician vs Career Businessman, your choice America.
1319250512487874565 2020-10-22 20:13:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> You could tell who Obama had in his audience by the way he spoke. Trump never deviates. So, who's the racist?
1319229441483169797 2020-10-22 18:49:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Knew this was coming.  Knew this was fake. None of it made sense.
1319228271524007937 2020-10-22 18:45:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Rebecca16738262 @AbdiPopulist Too many factual vids out there to be manufacturing stuff like this.
1319227800088436744 2020-10-22 18:43:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @drdavidsamadi Those that you know of. Bet there are millions more who thought they may have had the flu and got through it on their own.
1319225212941066241 2020-10-22 18:32:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And somehow it's working
1319004875162869760 2020-10-22 03:57:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @jennybizh @SenRonJohnson @BuzzFeed @maxseddon Sure does seem implausible,  however, isn't worth a couple of questions? Such as, if the FBI has had the hard drive all this time, why haven't they come out to say, "We've already looked into this and there's nothing here to see?"
1319003700564733957 2020-10-22 03:52:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Russia hoax investigation was started in hopes evidence would be found.  Biden's evidence is fo8in hopes an investigation would be started.  And you wonder why we don't trust 3-letter Gov't Agencies.
1318968975301160960 2020-10-22 01:34:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @politicalelle Nothing but Platitudes
1318968672187240448 2020-10-22 01:33:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SilviaBellrock Hired? Hopefully you'll incorporate a better hiring process!
1318968355659841538 2020-10-22 01:32:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mikeandersonsr Nope. Hunter wanted a bigger cut. Joe said no. Hunter has the final say, especially playing 2nd fiddle in his brother's shadow for his whole life.
1318899227389579264 2020-10-21 20:57:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Parkerlawyer So if you asked your client what their Net Income is, would they respond with "I'm not a fisherman?"
1318895375252672518 2020-10-21 20:42:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The fact that Mueller and his team of attorneys did not report any of this shows that this too will get swept under the rug. They're just waiting for the election steal of a lifetime so they can go on their merry way.
1318866941168201729 2020-10-21 18:49:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @fireandshine78 And the great thing about the Blind Pig is that it's in Downtown Ann Arbor, the most Liberal City in the State, home of University of Michigan and not to mention this place has always looked like it should be condemned.
1318735541014351875 2020-10-21 10:07:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TroyAikman You just told your wife she looks fat in that dress and now you want to sorry not sorry your way out of it? Believe it or not, we are too smart to fall for that bs.
1318733214379347968 2020-10-21 09:57:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I was wondering if we were going to receive news about his "suicide."
1318703813147136000 2020-10-21 08:01:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @liquidlaugh @romanoff_eric The DNC planted Biden right next to Senator Obama for a reason.

1318632104759001088 2020-10-21 03:16:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EmmaJoNYC @nypost Doesn't mean we can't carry their torch!
1318631648280403979 2020-10-21 03:14:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Seems like this is going around. John James in Michigan can't get incumbent Gary Peters to debate either.
1318630814557634562 2020-10-21 03:10:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I think Trump should simply call JB, "Big Guy Joe" at the debate as nonchalantly as possible.
1318630207960600578 2020-10-21 03:08:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm going to follow suit.
1318629708460888065 2020-10-21 03:06:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why are Dems so afraid of Healthcare getting stricken down from the courts? If it's lawful,  ACB will vote to uphold it. If it's not lawful can't they create the law and have it pass in the Legislative Branch? Or do they need a progressive SCOTUS to legislate from the bench?
1318629042715844610 2020-10-21 03:03:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> When Harris becomes President in June, who becomes Vice President?
1318626910386216962 2020-10-21 02:55:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> And Fly bys are used as training for the pilots,  so there's that. What they don't get is that thunder from those awesome planes is the sound of Freedom.
1318625397911769088 2020-10-21 02:49:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BadAssTexan1776 I really wish they would have a series of tv ads that debunked every nomenclature the DNC has tried to pull over on the American public. Instead of coming up with great ideas to improve people's lives, they resort to lies and innuendos.
1318566215653199877 2020-10-20 22:54:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DonaldJTrumpJr Did they have an insurance policy to ensure they get their money's worth, such as fix the election?
1318565957695119360 2020-10-20 22:53:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I want to know what those foreign entities bought.  What good and/or services were they promised?
1318564349796024329 2020-10-20 22:46:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @costareports Maybe the deep state can bring in Comey to open and close the case.

1318493579422146561 2020-10-20 18:05:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @241Latina It truly gets me excited knowing that there's a crack in the DNC wall where everyone is starting to realize who the true advocates of ALL Men are Created Equal and that Conservatives have always fought for fairness in opportunity with the right to keep what you've built.
1318323195057942528 2020-10-20 06:48:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Marina_Sirtis Hell, Hallmark won't even cast her.

1318303698255306755 2020-10-20 05:31:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @McKaylaRoseJ Right now? I thought that started the moment Billy argued about the word "is".

1318136382037123074 2020-10-19 18:26:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mikeandersonsr @realDonaldTrump Would love to see this talked about on Thursday Night
1318134831587430400 2020-10-19 18:20:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How many times has JB run for President? He got thumped by HRC who stole the nomination from BS, not JB. He was a distant 3rd. It wasn't until they had their weakest field yet that they chose JB over BS (again), probably to better control his corruption.
1318007428747845632 2020-10-19 09:53:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklevinshow That's ok. Gave me a chance to watch Steve Hilton which is pretty good!
1318003685214081028 2020-10-19 09:39:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @eveforamerica You mean arrested?
1318003566339084288 2020-10-19 09:38:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @IngrahamAngle If someone does speeches, writes books and makes guest appearances and makes millions after public office that's the way it should be.  But it's when they sell information or provide policy now I have a problem.
1318002311403327492 2020-10-19 09:33:32 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @hootie39588772 Hilton is doing a great job on Trump's Economy and Larry Ludlow is adding to it with a new study from WSJ.
1317969653969420288 2020-10-19 07:23:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I must be living in a twilight zone episode because all I've ever known him to be is vicious and self aggrandizing.
1317951831289593857 2020-10-19 06:12:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Mel_Coffman Are these pics from when you were in college?

1317949655607660544 2020-10-19 06:04:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LeahR77 Antigovernment group who hated Trump and others. Gretchen knew this plan in April, but never told anyone.  Scores of people who went to the Capital every day for the 5 months never knowing that their lives were in danger. Oh BTW, she just vetoed a bill making voting 2x a felony.
1317864731022139392 2020-10-19 00:26:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @OhMagaMan1 Definitely want these guys on our team!!!
1317862200539811842 2020-10-19 00:16:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Ilhan Well it's worked pretty good for your new husband.
1317859471373324290 2020-10-19 00:05:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This is huge. The Biden Family's Corruption is directly effecting our Allies. This truly needs to be investigated immediately.
1317797475017723904 2020-10-18 19:59:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert Either fall in line and simply kneel before me or be annihilated. Where have I heard that one before?

1317665692829843460 2020-10-18 11:15:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Serious question, we all know Biden won't last 6 months and Harris becomes President.  Does Harris get to choose a VP? Could that VP be Pelosi? Imagine Harris and Pelosi in the WH and Schiff as Speaker. How bad would things get?
1317664850483548162 2020-10-18 11:12:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @HotArmyWife2 @BackTheBlue2471 When Harris takes over, who becomes VP? Pelosi?
1317596501661667328 2020-10-18 06:41:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Need to replace Gary Petrrs with John James for Senate!
1317596079077163009 2020-10-18 06:39:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Unfortunately Stretchin Gretchen can't tell you the truth but instead gives divisive conjectures that points the finger away from who was truly behind this foiled attempt at anarchy. You want truth, research ut. It's all available. Make up your own minds.
1317595186218885122 2020-10-18 06:35:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @marklutchman That's just the money that was earned/passive. I'd like to see their balance sheet and FUBAR.
1317594732617437185 2020-10-18 06:33:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> ACB gave great answers.  If she were Liberal,  I would say the same thing because all of her answers were not left or right but based on the Law given to us in the Constitution. So, does the DNC have a problem with our Laws? If so, that should scare you.

1317591949042475008 2020-10-18 06:22:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Biden bombshells left and right and this is the crap you want to cover?

1317590219017887744 2020-10-18 06:16:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @NYGovCuomo Prove it. Masks don't do anything other than virtue signal that you have control over our daily lives and we'd better not forget it. If masks did work we'd see data ad nauseam and minimum standards on how they're made and worn. We're not stupid and we're not evil.
1317587917666136064 2020-10-18 06:06:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> More people they get to vote by mail the more they get to conduct voter fraud.  Throwing out ballots, Ballot Harvesting and duplicating ballots is easy when no one's looking.

1317585980942057478 2020-10-18 05:59:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DineshDSouza There are high school  principals who oversee large districts that make that kind of money, I don't see them living that kind of lifestyle.

1317511405445222400 2020-10-18 01:02:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ari_russian @AllenRo14661186 Just imagine where we would be if most of the GOP didn't believe the Russia Hoax and actually got behind Trump at the beginning.  Imagine where we would be if we got ALL 3 branches?
1317450869110165505 2020-10-17 21:02:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Libs are the dumbest. They don't even know that Trump gives them little soundbites to show the world how leftists actually think and they're all too eager to comply thinking they're gonna be invited to the world's elite group.
1317449190570676225 2020-10-17 20:55:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> But you are obligated to spread DNC lies

The incumbent Gary Peters tows the DNC line. All of his advertisements are lies and will do everything to keep us from our own prosperity.
1317422694971953154 2020-10-17 19:10:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Michigan was hit the hardest during those years because we had Jennifer Granholm as Governor. Tired of when things are going well we elect a Democrat.
1317422053427904513 2020-10-17 19:07:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @unscriptedmike I would love nothing more than to watch all those ugly faces of Waters, Pelosi, Schiff, Omar, Cortez all lose their reelection bids.

1317418978722140165 2020-10-17 18:55:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @McKaylaRoseJ That should be the next question from DJT at their next debate.

1317253076420599808 2020-10-17 07:56:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Is this all they have are platitudes? If he had such great ideas, like how to handle the pandemic,  why didn't he say anything before now? If he could have saved lives why did he let so many die? If another 200k are supposed to die, is he just going to let them? He has nothing.

1317190997252648963 2020-10-17 03:49:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> A question from a DNC plant and this is the platform they want to galvanize their base. Just shows you how messed up and evil the Liberals really are.
1317189564944027650 2020-10-17 03:43:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Can you intern over here in Michigan?

1317185567067693056 2020-10-17 03:28:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @heyitsJudeD I believe that would be hyphenated "hand-job"
1317112064318517252 2020-10-16 22:36:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ImAwakeRU72 I don't know why I get Liberal crap on my feed
1317111670456680448 2020-10-16 22:34:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @m_keenum Because they want us to believe it's science and there is no God.
1317102761729810432 2020-10-16 21:59:03 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut Thus ending HRC's decade run.
1317102563804762113 2020-10-16 21:58:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @trumpandfamily I find it necessary to go through my followers list to follow people I may have missed.
1317063476557262848 2020-10-16 19:22:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So he does want to live in a Communist country.
1317062690091749377 2020-10-16 19:19:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Interesting that President Trump has no problem going on Leftist MSM shows, but have you ever seen Biden or Harris on Fox, OANN, or NewsMax?
1317059690124148737 2020-10-16 19:07:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The next time Trump is asked this asinine question, he should start listing dates of 20+ times he has "denounced racism" and then follow it up with is Joe Biden still a White supremacist?
1316929153782992899 2020-10-16 10:29:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @stirednotshakn Is JB still a White Supremacist?
1316928886421192704 2020-10-16 10:28:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's an upside down world right now. Enjoy the silence.
1316772598445899776 2020-10-16 00:07:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @tedcruz @LarryKutcher Very impressive during Barrett confirmation hearings,  became a bigger fan. Keep up the good fight.
1316771400364032001 2020-10-16 00:02:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Qtah17 Here comes the circus brought to you by every Democrat Senator on the Judicial Committee not up for Reelection.
1316771104355213314 2020-10-16 00:01:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Seriously?!? How many packages does Nancy need to pick from?
1316770880656150531 2020-10-16 00:00:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Dear Chucky, if the ACA is so great, then you wouldn't be so nervous.  Everyone would be clamoring to not taking it away, but the only ones I hear to keep it are the ones on the Left, you know,  the ones who opted out of Obamacare.
1316769997470019584 2020-10-15 23:56:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Brings a lot to the table.
1316769661472694273 2020-10-15 23:55:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump I'd be more appreciative if you can get another stimulus package through.
1316769431683465217 2020-10-15 23:54:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Patriotic86 @shellsncheezzz Think I'd be more shocked if they did!
1316769026413076488 2020-10-15 23:52:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @bsmitch007 Yep, and all those intimate pics are photo-shopped. CW is so predictable.
1316768569145856002 2020-10-15 23:51:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @shellsncheezzz How convenient
1316745215731019782 2020-10-15 22:18:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ChuckCallesto Done
1316743976142221314 2020-10-15 22:13:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TurveyBeth Agreed. What kind of father allows their son, who is battling addiction to not know what is going on in their lives?
1316743663087751170 2020-10-15 22:12:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EricMMatheny Or putting the cookie jar on top of your refrigerator so your 3 year old can't get to it.
1316743328457785345 2020-10-15 22:10:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut Yep, but it also goes to show you that they even can't come up with an original idea in creating a narrative.
1316742926534352897 2020-10-15 22:09:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KamVTV Must have been all that riding in the elevator together...
1316742674314145794 2020-10-15 22:08:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Holding onto the evidence
1316742566432440321 2020-10-15 22:07:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ksorbs I think he should but I don't trust the vote. The Dems have their back against the wall and they know they can get away with anything, including voter fraud.
1316718209106685952 2020-10-15 20:30:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LaurenWitzkeDE The question is how did they connect in the first place? Whose idea was it? How did they come up with those dollar amounts and what was promised in return?
1316717622629720065 2020-10-15 20:28:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @sanaayesha___ @catturd2 @nypost Amazing what a great place we'd have if we just had a little more of this over the past 4 (12) years.
1316717276498886657 2020-10-15 20:27:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm thinking we're giving Hunter way too much credit. It was probably Joe who orchestrated his son as the conduit and Hunter said, ok.
1316715262603862017 2020-10-15 20:19:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Seriously, I find it amazing how a leftist can look at something so obvious and come up with the most screwed up, "I hate Trump" conclusion. Critical thinking is an inalienable right handed down by God, use it.
1316713731099963395 2020-10-15 20:13:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Savingworld88 @EricMMatheny Nope, they timed it perfectly. Shut down everyone's economy and not produce a 2nd stimulus so most of middle America suffers to the point they vote Democrat. They didn't take into account how fast Trump gets things done or how we are not stupid and know their tricks.
1316712122395615232 2020-10-15 20:06:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @scrowder @TinkCarla Said the same thing about Kavanaugh and low and behold bring in the circus.
1316710794202095617 2020-10-15 20:01:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Or China
1316710570867986433 2020-10-15 20:00:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mamabridgee Nope, it gives us something in common.
1316709308512567296 2020-10-15 19:55:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, it had nothing to do with getting to the results and everything with casting a shadow of doubt over Trump's win, especially with the GOP. Imagine how different right now would be if our GOP was behind Trump from the beginning.
1316708641974767616 2020-10-15 19:52:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The only reason to watch the geriatric softball game on ABC is waiting for the inevitable car crash of Biden mumbling about something that has nothing to do with anything. Let's count how many times GS has to save JB from falling off the rails like a good lil stooge.
1316645304561795075 2020-10-15 15:41:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It'll be interesting to see just how tough these questions will be in this very controlled and safe environment for Joe.
1316641914859515904 2020-10-15 15:27:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MarkMeadows Do you think Hunter got that gig? Joe set that up to enrich himself.
1316641193833435142 2020-10-15 15:24:57 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How is it that you have a candidate who barely campaigns and when he does 4 people show up who has a running mate that no one likes leading in the polls with bigger leads than BHO and HRC? They're going to steal the Presidency, Senate and House seats.
1316640091801104384 2020-10-15 15:20:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Anyone notice how differently the misogynist Dems spoke to Judge Barrett while the Republicans spoke the same way they spoke to everyone else?
1316437903686406153 2020-10-15 01:57:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DonaldJTrumpJr Will ABC Townhall allow this to be questioned?
1316364263708127233 2020-10-14 21:04:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @EricMMatheny So is this a set up? I don't trust the Dems, they'll pull anything especially now with their backs against the wall.  Is some soyboy flunky student going to pull a "Blasey Ford" right before the confirmation vote?
1316362522124058624 2020-10-14 20:57:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Funny, I thought Joe didn't know anything about his son's dealings with Ukraine?!
1316165464922312710 2020-10-14 07:54:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DavidLimbaugh Why doesn't she Trump Campaign show an ad of his denouncing WS 19 times?
1316157795130118144 2020-10-14 07:24:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @PureMichGirl They've all been practicing for the past 3 weeks for their 30 minutes  of stump speeches.
1316155001127997441 2020-10-14 07:12:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LisaMarieBoothe Feel sorry for her husband though.  I thought my wife could remember stuff I did 20 years ago. This guy can't get away with anything!
1316154400847659013 2020-10-14 07:10:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @laurenboebert Her response should have been, "Why, are planning on bringing a lying stooge like you did with Justice Kavanaugh?"
1316153248999448577 2020-10-14 07:06:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @deb6246 BS
1316152956929048576 2020-10-14 07:04:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @241Latina She wanted to get ACB under oath so they can bounce some manboy out right before the confirmation vote stating he had been asked to do some stuff with her. If they got 90 colleagues to write an open letter from ND, then they sure as hell can get a lying libtard student.
1316151700701483008 2020-10-14 06:59:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @magabritt It's just for show.
1316132611501305857 2020-10-14 05:44:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life!
1316110399591374850 2020-10-14 04:15:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SecPompeo Thank you
1316109395848318977 2020-10-14 04:11:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @FrankelJeremy @rentonMagaUK That's great but it won't mean anything. Too many agency heads and union officials dictating what we can and can't do. Nothing has changed. Lockdown mandates are still in force.
1316107903703674881 2020-10-14 04:05:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Do you think the 8 justices are watching and saying  "Good Answer"?
1316099311604772869 2020-10-14 03:31:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoeBiden It wasn't the will of the people. It was the DNC Congress and their thirst for power.
1316070144582602753 2020-10-14 01:35:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He's letting them look like fools.
1316069874163212288 2020-10-14 01:34:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @NoahDeplorable @2Disabled Who else is going to handle the 500+ cases going on right now?
1316068475778072579 2020-10-14 01:29:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> A badass lady calling on a badass lady... Republicans are awesome!
1316067750473797638 2020-10-14 01:26:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @monicaonairtalk I'm sure she's mouthing the words, "You're an idiot" under her mask while Dems are trying their best at a gotcha question.
1316045999782199301 2020-10-13 23:59:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ASavageNation How can ensure we have a fair and valid election with an outcome on Nov 3rd?
1316015244213280777 2020-10-13 21:57:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @smh8872626 As I'm sure everyone does.
1315809263088996352 2020-10-13 08:19:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not, Holy Sh*t, look at all the people. Or, how come Biden can only get a dozen drive bus? Nope, you focus on the narrative. Do you really think you're making a difference?
1315808087379451904 2020-10-13 08:14:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Nightshade3117 Gotcha again!
1315807944064335874 2020-10-13 08:13:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ChuckCallesto @patriciatauthor Yes, but it's not keeping her from staying the course of closing our state and prolonging the election results.
1315807584755109888 2020-10-13 08:12:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If they're suppressed,  wouldn't that mean no one would be in line? Since the majority of the US is pretty moderate,  Republicans would want more voters. It's the Democrats who need a smaller turnout.
1315806828228481026 2020-10-13 08:09:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Annakhait @MarleenMcDanie4 I'm sure they're all in Teams meeting together going over strategy.
1315805248569696256 2020-10-13 08:03:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Jennyjen010 Agreed. Watching rally now on YouTube newsmax. Just the rally, no commentary and especially no ticket tape below scrolling with libtard talking points.
1315756077980545024 2020-10-13 04:47:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Speaking of to justice systems,  whatever happened to Biden's Sex Harassment Accuser?
1315754461298556928 2020-10-13 04:41:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @cristinalaila1 @gatewaypundit I'm thinking if there is another debate, President Trump should simply give all his time to Joe.
1315722608495800327 2020-10-13 02:34:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealJamesWoods Come on man... seriously. This is sad.
1315631531520647168 2020-10-12 20:32:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This is America. Please RT.
1315630391450120192 2020-10-12 20:28:23 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ANDREW1ALBERTT Brutus
1315587800201392133 2020-10-12 17:39:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Voting is safe by mail. So, all the videos and stories about found ballots in dumpsters, we are to ignore them? Besides, that's not what really scares us. It's the ballot harvesting and then the mail in.
1315585749706829824 2020-10-12 17:30:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MdelaSoledad90 To be honest, I believe the Dems will be ruthless in their attempt at stealing this election.
1315585362664845312 2020-10-12 17:29:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> She's the worst. MI Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that she has no authority to give emergency orders making them null and void. Next day, all heads of agencies like MI DHS issued even more restrictive "rules." We need John James to defeat our current Socialist Gary Peters.
1315472532103983104 2020-10-12 10:01:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Riddle me this. Why are Dems so afraid of Roe v Wade getting overturned? Why don't they just pass a law that makes abortion legal? Get the votes from the American People or get the House, the Senate and the President to vote yes. By Dems POV, we all want ProChoice.
1315268643815596035 2020-10-11 20:30:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GOPLeader @mimimonger Disagree.  They're not new. Democrats have always been power hungry. They've always wanted to expand governmental control. Impoverish the people,  eliminate the middle class through class warfare and they'll have it all.
1315267171447115776 2020-10-11 20:25:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Whatever happened to Joe Biden's sexual assault accuser?
1315260894285266944 2020-10-11 20:00:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Just like Venezuela and Australia
1315075722143305728 2020-10-11 07:44:19 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @360Albania @JoannaL26896865 @Tom08154584 What else would we be talking about?
1314800921080147968 2020-10-10 13:32:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I guess we're now doing "Hope and Change." It worked for the "clean" BHO, do it's gotta work for BH.
1314798627567661056 2020-10-10 13:23:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> It's simple,  checks and balances.
1314798215049490432 2020-10-10 13:21:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kirstiealley Just curious as to how fundamentally changing our Founding Principles and the American way is preserving our democracy? If you want to preserve it,  then you would want Representatives who are Constitutionalists, not people looking to expand government control.

1314704559911178240 2020-10-10 07:09:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 Well, on that note, I don't know how anyone could vote for Joe.
1314704368286011392 2020-10-10 07:08:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @isupportTrump92 @LibertyWhiskey Hersheypark. I still think about Hershey and how he started it, wow.

1314703773806350337 2020-10-10 07:06:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's funny sh*t!!
1314703629270605825 2020-10-10 07:05:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 @Tom08154584 Yep, slow and steady is always best!  Too much, too fast almost always ends up unsatisfying. All in is like playing the roulette wheel at a casino. I'm not into gambling. You can always pull out at the right moment if you are slow and steady.
1314702198681604097 2020-10-10 07:00:04 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BlessUSA45 $10?!? I think they're just cheap.
1314701219953336320 2020-10-10 06:56:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Jennyjen010 About as much as Sessions
1314635772012703745 2020-10-10 02:36:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 It was done by Anarchists. They hate Trump. They all Government. They had a list of representatives. 13 so far.
1314634542586699781 2020-10-10 02:31:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SilviaBellrock One of my better weeks even though my buddy $AYTU didn't go as planned.
1314634196678303745 2020-10-10 02:29:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ok I call BS
1314633980654821381 2020-10-10 02:29:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kingron_b Can I just say one thing,  man to man... dammmmnnn!
1314633537312690178 2020-10-10 02:27:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> But first, a Stimulus Package ASAP. Come November 3rd, people will be too busy from getting evicted and their cars repo'd to vote.
1314632286227378177 2020-10-10 02:22:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mchooyah Why are there no minimum standards for a face covering? Why are there no statistics in how effective they are? Instead, we get to see advertisements selling us that masks are great. It's all BS. It's only a "I hate Trump" signal.
1314514025770823681 2020-10-09 18:32:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GOPChairwoman Wish they'd do that here in Michigan

1314508507409010688 2020-10-09 18:10:25 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @maggmountains Not about this. They're untouchable. Hell, the GOP won't even confirm any of Trump's 50 nominations.
1314508092751654912 2020-10-09 18:08:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They tried to do that with HRC, but failed. Now our Citizens have to understand,  they're actually voting for Harris to be President.
1314380739698454529 2020-10-09 09:42:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SierraWhiskee @SpeakerPelosi Why don't they focus on a second Stimulus Package?
1314380103678394368 2020-10-09 09:40:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MdelaSoledad90 @kirstiealley Because in Sparta, only Spartan women give birth to real men...
1314379507638382593 2020-10-09 09:37:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut Nothing good.  Notice Paul Ryan isn't saying much. Repeal and Replace my a**. He set up Trump to be a stooge.
1314379003235635209 2020-10-09 09:35:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @maggmountains In a fair fight yes, but they're acting as if the votes have  already been counted.
1314378744375717889 2020-10-09 09:34:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> That's just it. They don't care who sees what any more because they've already packed the ballots in key areas. Now they'll sweep all the wrongdoings of Clinton and Obama, then create an Oligarchy by Filling Senator Seats and packing the SCOTUS.
1314377935231619073 2020-10-09 09:31:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ASoftstar I went with nuts.. just because.  Hold off as long as possible, then settle down for a long Winter's nap!
1314377465448534021 2020-10-09 09:29:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How do they hold any power? We the People need to see the two candidates. They're essentially protecting Joe to give the illusion that he could possibly win.
1314376847564648448 2020-10-09 09:27:15 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> A Constitutional Right would mean that it's in the US Constitution.  If it's in the US Constitution,  then we wouldn't know it as RvWade, a Court Case argued in front of the Supreme Court. It went to the highest court because abortion was never voted in by the People.

1314218145813598208 2020-10-08 22:56:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MeganFlanigan8 @tammyacctg What she meant was we all have to have 2 jobs to pay for their imposed wish list enslavement programs like The Green New Deal, Universal Healthcare, Guaranteed Income for Everyone etc.
1314217397251911681 2020-10-08 22:53:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @charlipence @KelemenCari @Mike_Pence I can't imagine how upset you were watching all the lies levied against your Dad. My BP was through the roof and I'm way over here in Michigan!
1314215540240547840 2020-10-08 22:46:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @GKeile Because he knows he wasn't the target.
1314215022587908100 2020-10-08 22:44:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why was every question slanted against Conservatives? The very first few words was leading libtard question. Why do we keep accepting these moderators? Can't we get just one who's a Conservative?
1314214305613701121 2020-10-08 22:41:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Wow, I'd like to hear his whole sermon!
1314051465661616128 2020-10-08 11:54:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @KellyannePolls Well, at least now their signatures won't have to match.
1314050878941401088 2020-10-08 11:51:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @dirtydiscooo But they do have that uncanny knack for bringing you into their web of deceit.
1314047798401216513 2020-10-08 11:39:43 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealJamesWoods He's also on video, pretty much every day saying something racist.
1314044588718518272 2020-10-08 11:26:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> We did. A blatant non answer is an affirmation so the only question is,  why won't you just say it?
1314043241298362369 2020-10-08 11:21:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kayleighmcenany The smirkbis a constant Southern,  'Bless Your Heart" which is never a good thing.
1314042820827766785 2020-10-08 11:19:56 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealEricCarmen Would love to see,  just once, a Conservative moderator instead of life long liberals, like Tucker, Levin etc.
1314041580827934720 2020-10-08 11:15:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @shellsncheezzz Even for a guy
1314041303257223168 2020-10-08 11:13:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Now we know why she dropped out of the race so early with only gaining 2%
1314038707738079237 2020-10-08 11:03:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealEricCarmen I watch it on Newsmax. Can't do Fox unless it's Tucker or Levin.
1314038198511820800 2020-10-08 11:01:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 That's easy.  Newsmax
1313632481778827265 2020-10-07 08:09:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 Better than expected numbers with a great future. It's a shame AH didn't treat them well. My plan was to shave off some profit from $AYTU and move into a few other "penny stocks." I tend to focus on larger cap stocks, but I wanted a little more divestiture in my portfolio.
1313590638575849474 2020-10-07 05:23:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 My patience is wearing thin on the lack of price momentum.
1313576910719537160 2020-10-07 04:28:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yes, that Plan was awesome and should have been voted on but NP couldn't let that happen. She needed too many other things to be in the plan. Maybe throough the Art of the Deal and be willing to walk away from the table, we'll get something done.
1313569298930073602 2020-10-07 03:58:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MariaSt7216 Two words: Mute Button
1313441072127897600 2020-10-06 19:28:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 Just hope it continues in the AH!
1313215675406614528 2020-10-06 04:33:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I read it has been 19 times Trump has denounced White Supremacist Groups. Why is he the only one having to answer this question?
1313153849419599872 2020-10-06 00:27:29 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'd like everyone to truly understand why it's imperative that Joe Biden said during the Debate, as naturally as can be, In Shallah.
1313151420611334144 2020-10-06 00:17:50 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 Still the most favorite stock for shorts. With so many out there, I just wish they'd leave this one alone for a day. Looking forward to tomorrow's ER!

1313073140948402176 2020-10-05 19:06:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Because he knows he's not targeted
1313056245281161219 2020-10-05 17:59:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BannedDeplorab1 Agreed. Why can't they see and hear the truth? I don't get it!
1312754801944518657 2020-10-04 22:01:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> One day, with a lot of work,  I'll be smart enough to know just what Mr. Woods is saying.
1312752451032961024 2020-10-04 21:52:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> There is no place on earth you can keep a job that long without doing anything except for Congress of the US.
1312751374061404160 2020-10-04 21:48:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @gracelover19301 Do you need a towel boy?
1312750760904609798 2020-10-04 21:45:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DeAnna4Congress Easy... Voter ID
1312749819849584640 2020-10-04 21:42:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mw0425 @McKaylaRoseJ FYI Detroit and St. Louis are 1 and 2 in the most dangerous cities per capita in the US. So we have that going for us. Democratic rule since Coleman Young declared war against the whites (8 Mile Rd Border) back in the 70's. Churches became united and Detroit is coming back.
1312594934457917440 2020-10-04 11:26:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealEricCarmen You won't hear that phrase at a Biden event either.
1312594228292263941 2020-10-04 11:23:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MajorCaGov @joerogan Anything I can do to help!
1312593698010562560 2020-10-04 11:21:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SexCounseling All of them were targets, just like there are no fires in Canada.
1312593378153033730 2020-10-04 11:20:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RealJamesWoods At least he's leading in all of the polls.
1312590459894730753 2020-10-04 11:08:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He knows that he wasn't the target.
1312505616947003392 2020-10-04 05:31:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ksorbs This is beyond. He is awesome. I always looked forward to his comments. They brought intelligence and sanity to all the crazy from the left.
1312504725317640195 2020-10-04 05:28:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SierraWhiskee Talk about what life will look like 8 years from now if their Santa Claus lost of give always are now too expensive to keep going. Such as Universal Government Run Healthcare. Only one way to keep costs down. Stop providing services. Gov't jobs only. No Pursuit of Happiness.
1312499102987378688 2020-10-04 05:05:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @senatemajldr @POTUS That's great news. Now to celebrate, this week's to do list Finalize Stimulus Package  Confirm our Justice
1312024755227242498 2020-10-02 21:40:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut Amazing how many Libtards are running to the microphone as if they know there are but only a few seats open to the ruling class once they gain control.
1312024251357171712 2020-10-02 21:38:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Jim_Jordan One of the ways to catch Covid is on hard surfaces. That's what made this virus so "dangerous." Has anyone checked the podium? Trump was negative before the debate and now after the debate, he's positive.
1312023579274477571 2020-10-02 21:36:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @overit_miss I thought it was just me. Maybe I'm scrolling wrong or imagining things.
1311989124132409345 2020-10-02 19:19:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Use $AYTU Rapid Test, the best Serology test on the market!
1311850553304059904 2020-10-02 10:08:39 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @greeks_4Trump @PookztA I think he's got a foot in both boxes. Does not take anyone special to corrupt a system.
1311849360666304513 2020-10-02 10:03:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Jennyjen010 @GmailDianne Unfortunately,  Sean can't say anything.
1311849165064994816 2020-10-02 10:03:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Of course they are. The Left will do EVERYTHING to get Trump out. Their whole party is about to be found out for the greedy criminals they are.
1311846575124164608 2020-10-02 09:52:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @fireandshine78 Love the dates and times and the quotes... are there any on Trump? Nope. They just have the playbook.
1311845912969437187 2020-10-02 09:50:13 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 @rookiedriver67 Still think their Rapid Tests are going to be the revenue stream that brings them to the brink of being a billion dollar valuation or about $8 a share.
1311654447530029057 2020-10-01 21:09:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @HeatherChilders @2Disabled Maybe he answered one of those emails and it actually turned out to be legit?!
1311653838949150720 2020-10-01 21:06:59 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @RandyRRQuaid Who took the picture? Was that a before or after shot?
1311652118638612481 2020-10-01 21:00:09 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 $AYTU and $TRVN will be a core holding for many years,  just like MSFT and AAPL were in the 2000's.
1311639216426823680 2020-10-01 20:08:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @charliekirk11 Obama didn't do that to the Muslim Brotherhood. So, there's that.
1311638661084086273 2020-10-01 20:06:40 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, we're not supposed to believe what we see, but what you tell us?
1311637158810316801 2020-10-01 20:00:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Why can't we get a true Conservative to be a moderator? Is that like asking for peace in the Middle East?
1311534211132686336 2020-10-01 13:11:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 Even all of his commercials, I don't know what his plan other buying people's votes with free money.
1311482469129113600 2020-10-01 09:46:01 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> When did Joe convert to Muslim? In shallah or God Sees come off his tongue as natural as saying God's watching.  Was he making fun of Trump's Christianity?
1311476709586350081 2020-10-01 09:23:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 Institutions both here and abroad are hoarding cash right now waiting to buy the discounted tickers.
1311351160251592716 2020-10-01 01:04:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @mona4faith @ArtValley818 Why is there no pregnant barbie? Because Ken comes in a different box.
1311335148445720576 2020-10-01 00:00:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> $AYTU We are at 50% trading volume.  SP is not reflective of the forward earnings of this constantly growing company.  When there is substantive news, there will be much greater trading volume which will only bode well for us "bag holders."  Do your own DD.
1311302761766678534 2020-09-30 21:51:55 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TheLeoTerrell @BJCollins131 @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @seanhannity @FoxNews Why was it directed only at Trump? That should be directed at BOTH candidates.
1311302026886864896 2020-09-30 21:49:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @abigailmarone @HiCaliberLilGal How about a list of Supreme Court Justices?
1311299786834837504 2020-09-30 21:40:06 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> One thing is certain, Trump is always one step ahead of everybody. He sees things before anyone else.  I think he got Biden to empty his clip of all his ammunition. Now Trump will pick these off one by one to counter punch Biden/Harris into the worst political ticket ever.
1311286260774957056 2020-09-30 20:46:21 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> When Sleepy Joe was attacking Trump's kids, a simple response would have been,  they're all here, where's Hunter?
1311285602445406208 2020-09-30 20:43:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hand signals and a baby sitter along with E. All of the Above.
1311285232977539072 2020-09-30 20:42:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @my3monkees Why should the President condemn them AND NOT both of them? Why is Trump tied to this "idea?" Trump's answer is, "of course I condemn White Supremacists, now why don't you ask Joe?"
1311284477386280962 2020-09-30 20:39:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Who here thinks Queen Jill Biden is forcing Joe to be President if only for one day so she can be called "First Lady?"
1311282612145655809 2020-09-30 20:31:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @Amz_Grce @SteveTh89821549 I'm more concerned what Joe had in front of him on the podium. Many times it looked as though he was reading. Then someone whisked his stuff away at the end.
1311281994983190529 2020-09-30 20:29:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Or seeing eye dog
1311281581106049025 2020-09-30 20:27:46 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I truly wished that Trump would have walked out on stage with a huge American Flag and plopped it right in the middle of the stage. This was a debate to run our country wasn't it?
1311280290313252871 2020-09-30 20:22:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @my3monkees Didn't Nadler say the same thing?

1311278915261001734 2020-09-30 20:17:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @sandy1schneider I'd love to see OAN take on Pence and Harris!
1311160561460301830 2020-09-30 12:26:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @LuckyWTheStr8Rt Exactly right. If they did their job just a little bit,  Trump wouldn't have to do half the things to speak to the American people.

1310976846671032327 2020-09-30 00:16:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Did we vote for a President for 3.75 years or 4? If this is to close to the end, what date should we go by, June?
1310976452939087872 2020-09-30 00:15:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Conservatives Represent Everyone while Liberals seem to only Represent those who agree with them.

1310975549469347841 2020-09-30 00:11:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @rookiedriver67 No doubt. I swear every day, just get rid of this thing. But here I am, going on 6 months, adding along the way thinking,  this has got to be near the bottom.

1310974509344841741 2020-09-30 00:07:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @ASavageNation So they're worried about how much he's paid in income taxes over the past 3 years? Didn't he separate himself from his companies? Hasn't he donated 100% of his salary since becoming President? Hasn't his Net Worth actually gone down instead of up like other Politicians?
1310781224194052097 2020-09-29 11:19:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @heckyessica @MattWalshBlog That's right!üòÉüòòüëç

1310631669104283648 2020-09-29 01:25:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @amyklobuchar So, are you saying the IRS is incompetent? His accountanting firms are illegitimate?

1310603993316499456 2020-09-28 23:35:16 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @sapiofoxy And they're saying just in last 100 years we have influenced the climate. Just based on statistics,  you cannot calculate simply for the fact it is too small of a sample size to show a slope one way or another.

1310584607759372288 2020-09-28 22:18:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> The 77000+ pages of the IRS Code has one common thread,  Don't pay any more than legally necessary to the US Treasury.

Instead of begrudging him, take a page out of how he does it and do it yourself. The IRS Code is there for EVERYONE to use to their advantage. All it takes is know how.

1310192353156780033 2020-09-27 20:19:33 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @MdelaSoledad90 It's like the DNC punishing those who make too much money with high taxes. Twitter will punish those with too many followers and too many anti-lib comments.

1306569999667138560 2020-09-17 20:25:37 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Only the beginning,  when he gets caught writing the answer on the hallway chalkboard.

1306439526282334213 2020-09-17 11:47:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @CharriseLane Nope, not even a little. In fact, shout it from the roof tops.

1306177820251619330 2020-09-16 18:27:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> He couldn't handle any townhall.
1306177582736576513 2020-09-16 18:26:17 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nicely done!
1305906922768523264 2020-09-16 00:30:47 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Beautiful.
1305906115461472256 2020-09-16 00:27:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Seriously, WTH is that?!?
1305849187519655936 2020-09-15 20:41:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TwoDollarBill Yep, saw that too.  Retweeted with a comment of Cedars and $AYTU!  Love to have fresh money come pouring in, especially institutional!
1305712286397497344 2020-09-15 11:37:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Cedars-Sinai and $AYTU!
1305684836603101185 2020-09-15 09:48:18 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I would pay big money to see that!
1305612067567788032 2020-09-15 04:59:08 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> No. God would have the population of His planet in mind when He created us.
1305611642680508416 2020-09-15 04:57:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Seriously, how does JB have 42%?!? He doesn't campaign but when he does there are 10 people at his events. It's still BS.

1305472716078804992 2020-09-14 19:45:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> "Assault Weapons"... John Wick once killed 3 men in a bar using only a pencil. I'd say that would be using an "Assault Weapon." Give a Progressive an inch, they'll take everything. Just look at every Dictatorship, ever.
1305306309626130432 2020-09-14 08:44:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I've boycotted watching the NFL, but I have an advantage. I'm from Detroit. Who the hell would want to watch that?
1305305700567003136 2020-09-14 08:41:45 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> If Biden did just one positive thing each year he's been on our bank roll, he would have 47 things to brag about and we'd all know them by now. But he doesn't so yes, they have to spend that kind of money for their propaganda.
1304964729933377536 2020-09-13 10:06:51 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @samanthamarika1 So, does anyone believe they'll receive Emmy Nominations? I do because they always think they know  more than us mental midgets.
1304865755712958467 2020-09-13 03:33:34 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This is complete BS
1304864236586270722 2020-09-13 03:27:31 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BurgessOwens And, they're allowing them to do it all over again in the name of BLM. Are we equal,  yes or no? Yes. Then let's all act like we're equal.
1304834844514562055 2020-09-13 01:30:44 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SusanStJames3 So, who gave the "code red?" We can handle the truth!
1304784359103266816 2020-09-12 22:10:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Hope you're right!
1304691776930840576 2020-09-12 16:02:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I hope everyone knows Obama depleted PPE before leaving office and never replenished nor told Trump. Set up? Why did Biden say in Oct 2019, Trump is "not prepared for a pandemic?"
1304594946306052096 2020-09-12 09:37:28 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Forcing us to resort to mail in ballots...
1304495950292037632 2020-09-12 03:04:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Not a single second of it was watched.  Not a single second will be watched. Not until they stand as one for the American Flag and support our Brothers and Sisters in Blue.
1304383590541807623 2020-09-11 19:37:36 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> This needs to go viral. Please RT.
1304248266276601859 2020-09-11 10:39:53 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm in!

1304084125066952706 2020-09-10 23:47:38 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Nope, and frankly, don't care.
1304025917254234112 2020-09-10 19:56:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @FlorioGina Was that 8 supposed to be a 9?
1304023932064993281 2020-09-10 19:48:27 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Remember laughing my butt off the last time! Thanks JW!
1304021560420954113 2020-09-10 19:39:02 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I'm just pleased that I can say that many syllables at once.
1303728749649813504 2020-09-10 00:15:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Too funny
1303728417494441985 2020-09-10 00:14:11 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @AmyKremer @realDonaldTrump That was probably worth the $1b lost in net worth to his family,  right there.
1303727590272888834 2020-09-10 00:10:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @TimRunsHisMouth Seriously,  that's like saying who's worse, Pelosi or Schiff,  Schumer or Nadler, Obama or Biden, Hillary or Bill, Bernie or Soros, etc.
1303726197403258880 2020-09-10 00:05:22 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @BannedDeplorab1 Wait a minute... you're fat?
1303688783561396225 2020-09-09 21:36:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> How many people had to write, edit, approve and distribute this? And not one of them said, "Hey wait a minute!"  https://t.co/8hapub9TB2

1303530336597544960 2020-09-09 11:07:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @kirstiealley Amazing, I've been on this planet for a long time and never have I ever heard the term "cunthead." And so perfectly placed, well done. Hope you don't mind if I steal your word, do you?!?
1303485972378779648 2020-09-09 08:10:48 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @DudeReshi @jessinicoleb Gabba, Gabba Hey, if anyone has the Ramones on their page, I'm gonna believe everything they say, right Little Ramona?
1303344188801638405 2020-09-08 22:47:24 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JoannaL26896865 Hopefully it'll go up a cent or two
1303343963945029634 2020-09-08 22:46:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yeah!!!

1303342598371905537 2020-09-08 22:41:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Now this is a story that should be front and center.
1302978858115895296 2020-09-07 22:35:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> They'll have to test for Adderall and B12. I'm sure that's what the IV puncture is for. Surprised they don't have a port so they can increase levels as needed.

1302354654110588928 2020-09-06 05:15:20 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Don't forget Life, Liberty and Levin...

1301805812160049152 2020-09-04 16:54:26 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @atensnut Is there ever going to be a debate where the host is obviously Conservative instead of the other way around?
1301698775136776192 2020-09-04 09:49:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @JannaWilkinso69 @Akasidney1 Ya know, that took me a little bit, but now that's funny!
1301682181249601538 2020-09-04 08:43:10 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @charliekirk11 Or the girl that was running NAACP or Elizabeth Warren?
1301598230812209153 2020-09-04 03:09:35 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Beatable? I don't know how Biden could even win a State.. besides NY and Cali.
1301593082585116674 2020-09-04 02:49:07 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> California Grooming gets a boost with their new law.
1301592774521823235 2020-09-04 02:47:54 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @SM4USA @DoingRight1 If they are allowed to steal all 3 branches, our country will be unrecognizable by March 2021. We'll only have our feckless,  complicit Republicans to blame.
1301591531757989888 2020-09-04 02:42:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, and California passed a law that makes grooming that much easier.
1301563309288755202 2020-09-04 00:50:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> $AYTU 5 positive trading days out of 24 since the beginning of August giving us a 25% discount to what most of us believed to be the "bottom."  If $CIEN is any indication of what can go wrong with "great earnings and revenue ...  https://t.co/xBFK1gOvu8
1301533400625545223 2020-09-03 22:51:58 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> $AYTU with everything else tanking and $AYTU is relatively flat, is this like gaining 5%?
1301485044712734721 2020-09-03 19:39:49 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Ahhhhhh, life when you're young and dumb. You are so sure that you're absolutely correct and everyone else is totally wrong. Then you wake up in your 30's and say, "What the Hell was I thinking?"
1301315394783924225 2020-09-03 08:25:42 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Proof that there is Democrat Privilege. They can say and do whatever they please.
1301314484733181956 2020-09-03 08:22:05 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> A sane person would have said, I'm wearing a mask any way.
1301314212849954817 2020-09-03 08:21:00 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> I wonder how many election clerks across the country have been charged? I know it has been a few here in Michigan.  Can't even count how many votes that counted for the Democrats and NOT for the Republicans.  How do you think Rashid Tlaib got in?
1301313003904798720 2020-09-03 08:16:12 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep.
1301210588614451212 2020-09-03 01:29:14 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> $AYTU A little lite reading from the FDA regarding UV Lighting.  This is NOT Healight, but it does show the enormity of using this type of technology for many applications in fighting viruses and bacterial diseases.  https://t.co/ozNVnf4O2c
1301182814117867521 2020-09-02 23:38:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> So, don't think for a moment this won't happen here.

1300739552630505475 2020-09-01 18:17:30 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> Yep, the same dark shadows that are pulling your puppet strings.
1300737379867688960 2020-09-01 18:08:52 +0800 <Chuckmytaxes> @joshdcaplan @easkelson Can't wait for the Left to start the "We need to confiscate all weapons. It's for the good of the country."
